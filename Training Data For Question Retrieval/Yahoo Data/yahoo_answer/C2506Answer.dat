1404d9070bb3e8dbdfa989926c402b0eaa	"Fast Forward" by Jenny Pausacker?  http://www.amazon.com/Fast-Forward-Jenny...  "A book that builds momentum through fast-paced adventure and catches readers in its wake. Bored with the slow pace of his family's life, 12-year-old Kieran zips over to his Gran's workshop to see her latest invention. What he finds looks like a television remote channel changer, but is instead an Anti-Boredom Machine. Excitedly, Kieran sneaks the ABM into his pocket and soon his life becomes a series of rewinds (that make him sick), pauses (a great way to play tricks on other people), and fast forwards (school is so much better this way)."
8xVGuEDkaa	Phew, ok one thing at a time here    1. I'm sorry for what happen to your daughter, but realize that even though you were trying to do good for him, you made the one mistake a parent should never do, and that is leave your child unattended with a stranger... really? Come on.    2. Reading the letter out loud does give a different effect to it, i also feel when i read something out loud i can catch mistakes that i made or small oversights that i may have missed, which sounds like exactly what you did.    3. Your writing from this story? I would honestly suggest against it, i read about a quarter of it before i was tired of reading, it was choppy and your thought really didn't flow smoothly, you talk about what the boy did, then how you felt, then why you let the boy in your house, back to how you felt.     4. No hook, every writer has a hook, there was really nothing there that kept me interested in the story other then the fact that i have a minor in English and it was an english question.    5. You really wanna write a book and profit off something bad that happened to your daughter?    6.Grammar and Punctuation go a long way.|`|AjqO1aJgaa	I find your writing completely unreadable, I'm afraid. Remember paragraphs? You need to use them.|`|BBfIXcI0aa	Reading something out loud has an entirely different emotional effect from reading something in your head. When words are outside yourself, they seem more real, closer somehow. Reading them took them from a cold, analtical level to a very personal one immediately.  (Breath control also has a lot to do with emotions. I would guess that, unconsciously, you were probably holding your breath through a great deal of the letter when you were reading it silently.)

They aren't printed ahead of time in hard back but with some companies are offered for a limited time print run.  Next with legitimate e-publishers you sign a contract for a percentage of the book sale price just like you would a print publisher only you would get a substantially higher percentage because there is no advance.    ---  Legitimate e-publishers market and sell your book for you, any promotions you do are strictly for you to make more money and increase sales which any author will do.  They will send your book to reviewers and as the author should follow up and see about scheduling interviews and the like.    ---  Most e-book authors I know have varied experiences some love their e-publisher others have had some crappy stories.  The same is true of traditional print publishers so doing your homework is just as important.    ---  Do e-books actually make money?  Anything that can be sold and has a market can make money.    ---   With print authors now crossing over into e-publishing for short stories and out of genre work the market is picking up.  Considering all the venues for e-books a lot of readers are trying to incorporate both into their libraries.      ---  I know with e-authors they generally get checks more frequently than I do (I'm print published) but the checks are smaller than mine (I had an advance and once I made that back I get a small percentage of the cover sale).|`|LddkW0JFaa	Just as with any published book, it's best to find a means of distribution. If you're just selling them on your own web site, you probably won't even break even. However, if you can get your book on the front of the Kindle page you'll make money. Another advantage of Kindle books is that they are encrypted so a person who buys it cannot distribute it on P2P file-sharing networks. (People could download the file but can't read it.)|`|ve4K3rb1aa	e-books don't make a lot of money generally speaking.    unless you write sci-fi,  which seems to do very well in ebook fomat.    however,  with sony readers and kindles and even books for ds,  i can see that they will take off big style.  after all,  you can have maybe 1000 books on one little device|`|cme2Jyqsaa	Hi Dear I am making a living from selling Ebooks, yes you can make a very respectful income out of them provided your website becomes popular. my website http://www.2earn-online.com will help you to know how to create and sell ebooks successfully for free
1zhLI3fsaa	There are open casting calls for Native Americans, but the audition is closed now. I sent in an audition.    As for Jane, they were looking at some well-known actresses to play her. However, keep on looking for "open casting calls" for New Moon. Open casting calls mean that anyone can audition, you don't need and agent or experience.    I find the actingblogspot is good for stuff like this, and I think it's true and not a hoax.    Hope that helped!|`|UMffILKSaa	Dakota Fanning has kinda been confirmed for the role Jane..

32xabB4oaa	What you are talking about is "Long Exposure Photography." This is a photographic technique which can be achieved through various methods but in most cases is achieved the same way. The photographer sets up the camera on a tripod (or any stable surface where the camera will not move). The scene should usually be dark or at night. The photographer then opens up the shutter on the camera (using a long exposure or bulb setting). This is often done using a remote as not to move the camera, but the effect can also be achieved just by being very careful not to move the camera. While the shutter is open the photographer will move a light source around. Anything that stands still will be captured in clarity, anything that moves will be blurred (such as the light).    You can learn more about it by looking up "Long Exposure Photography" I linked a few tutorials and example of this type of photography.    Cheers!  Hope it helps ^_^      Tutorials:  http://www.danheller.com/tech-longexp.ht...  http://www.thinkcamera.com/news/article....    Examples:  http://digital-photography-school.com/lo...|`|7Srd7Pliaa	The mechanics are simple, but performing is where it takes patience.  A long exposure (but not too long) is all you need.  This is one of those applications where digital camera has the edge (over film), because you need that instant feedback to see if you have to redo the take.    First plan out what you are going to do, you can do it all in your head if you are creative enough but I'd probably need to start with a pen and paper.  Unless you have a light you can turn on and off easily, think of designs that you can do from start to finish with one take.  You'll have to visualize the space in front of you as a flat canvas and draw on it.    Check the picture you just took on the view finder, and you'll be able to tell just how close you are.  Do another take, fine tuning your mistakes until you get it right.  I guarantee you that unless the result is just total random lines the light painting you want to do took many attempts.  Above all, have fun, be creative, and be patient.|`|38J8nzhBaa	Maybe use the search term: Light Drawing    This should lead you to more results....  (by the way, search results may vary on different computers, hence your second row/second column didn't really work.)    Anyhow: The trick is using a tripod and long exposure. (and of course moving a lamp in front of the camera :))    Good luck playing around with it :)    PS, you may also want to check: Painting with Light...|`|sEhpGhj0aa	http://i10.photobucket.com/albums/a146/a...    its a long exposure with a moving light source.

0c91b79437b0e602213a070c2fc739d0aa	At the time of the Versailles Treaty signing, Wilson was all in favor of joining the League of Nations, it was Senate Majority Leaders Henry Cabot Lodge who was against it.  He threatened to not support the Versailles Treaty if Wilson had the U.S. join the LoN.  As it turned out, they both compromised.    Dear Bill S.  I did not give you the thumbs down...|`|mDuKVz95aa	Yes. Both Britian and France had notified Wilson that Europe could live with the changes made to the treaty establishing the League of Nations however Wilson refused to accept the changes made by the Senate. In addition, Wilson had done a poor job of selling the war clause og the Lof N charter to the American people which resulted in confusion as to whether the LofN could pull the American nation into a Europen war without Congressional consent.

6pCQTT4saa	I like the contrast on the man's clothing and instrument.  The levels are perfect.  His expression is also very intriguing.    I think you should either pull back or zoom in on the subject.  The wide and close-up shots are the interesting shots in photography.    I think the photo also needs more depth, so maybe blurring the background more would help.  I also have a thing for wide shots, so cropping would be nice.    Here's a picture to show what I mean.  Just for your reference, I will delete it soon.    http://img217.imageshack.us/img217/2912/...|`|vkzkXWfzaa	The background is winning the 'look at me' race.    Try selecting the background and take the brightness level down and add some blur.    As a rule of thumb a good B&W should have no absolute blacks and no absolute whites in it, black and white at the limits of the histogram mean that there is no detail recorded in those pixels. B&W pictures are all about detail.    A picture destined for B&W should be your very best, B&W shows all the faults in an image, but if you work in Raw and open them in 16bit mode you can really exaggerate the tonal values. The start image MUST never have burnt out highlights or absolutely black pixels as they have no data.    There are exceptions such as a high key or low key picture, but even here your results will be better with a properly exposed start image.|`|YwdFUCQtaa	I know this isn't the case, but this shot looks like it's been made in a studio with the background as a back-projection. Totally artificial. This is probably due to the use of fill-in flash. Also, the figure is a little on the overwhelming side; but the main turn-off for me is the lighting.|`|i7o8yC5Uaa	You've lost the background my old mate.

As it is, the monument draws the eye back and forth and decreases the impact of the figure.|`|bp59GQ0yaa	Don't enter it - it will get nowhere.  Don't mean to be blunt but....    The background is too sharp and distracting.  The foreground (subject) is not sharp enough.  TBH it is little more than a snapshot.|`|Bk4eIAWWaa	I feel that you've used too much flash here, leaving the face with very flat light and making the subject appear "cut out". You should dial down the flash so it is just a fill light.|`|95b3c1cab8a1f1f08d03b46eefc17755aa	It's too busy. The statue in the back distracts you from the figure. I suggest blurring the background a lot more.     Otherwise it's a nice shot.|`|MHg9JhEKaa	I like it.     I can't help but feel like I want to step back a bit to see more of the figure - is the composition exactly as you photographed it, or has the image been cropped afterwards?      Also I'm not sure you've quite got the levels correct, there's a lot of mid greys in there. Try slightly lengthening the exposure.     I like the stipes of the accordian concertina off-set against the stripes in his hat.     Very good first attempt :)

7ONKVbbiaa	Ted's reply is accurate as usual... I'll just add a couple of things.   www.rootsweb.com has a tutorial on tracing ancestry. Starting with you, prove your parents. Next, prove your grandparents (and children). Always use documents, even when you "know". The relatives will start falling into place as you fill in the family blanks, as long as you work from present, back.   PLEASE, don't get lost on researching a last name. If your father is a Fisher, and has 5 sisters, none will be Fisher now. You don't need Fishers, you need exact persons who are parents (siblings, etc) to your immediate family. By the time you get to gr gr grandparents.. they are still "family".|`|05bddf168eeb3e8ae67ab005844309abaa	This is the only William Fisher with wife Sally/Sallie on the 1930 census.    Memphis, Shelby, Tennessee; Roll: 2278; Page: 13B; Enumeration District: 126; Image: 577.0.    William Fisher, 30    Sallie Fisher, 28      They are black and do not have any children as of 1930. They have been married for 5 years. He is a farmer.    =================================    Here is some advice you didn't ask for but need.    Consider this:    IF (big IF) you are now 16 and the result of a long line of teen-aged lovers:  You were born 16 years ago, in 1992;  Your father was born 16 years before that, in 1976;  Your grandfather was born 16 years before that, in 1960;  Your great grandfather was born 16 years before that, in 1944.    IF (Another big IF) you are now 80 and the result of a long line of men who had a child by their second wives when they were 60:  You were born 80 years ago, in 1928;  Your father was born 60 years before that, in 1868;  Your grandfather was born 60 years before that, in 1808;  Your great grandfather was born 60 years before that, in 1748.    The Great-Grandfather born in 1944 could have been a 26-year old soldier in Viet Nam in 1970. When he got home he might have gone to a disco in a powder-blue double-knit polyester leisure suit.    The Great-Grandfather born in 1748 could have been a 28-year old soldier serving under George Washington in the American Revolution in 1776. When he got home, he might have danced a reel at a barn dance, in a pair of silk knee breeches and shoes with silver buckles.    Both examples are extreme, both are physically possible, both show why a birth year or even a birth decade help more than the phrase "my (great) grandfather".    Complete strangers who are not related to you at all will help you, but they can't do magic. A list of those 12 children, with birth dates or birth years, would help enormously.    If you add them, send me an e-mail via my profile. Half the time people who post here don't follow up their questions. I usually don't read questons twice.

The cause of the wars was the need for a slave holding society to close off escape routes for its slaves. Slavery needs secure borders.

The flight of so many slaves to the Seminoles became intolerable for the Deep South and that brought on the Seminole Wars.|`|550e4912823fee98e745442e7bdab33faa	Do you mean the Second Seminole War?

HYOQfHbWaa	Freedom is the ability to be absolutely free mentally, physically and spiritually. Freedom means that we are what we are because of our choice and not because of compulsion. Absolute freedom exists. And the more enlightened we become, the more free we are. I believe that the Free Will is unfettered and we are truly creating the experiences in our lives. We are told to face reality before we realize that we are creating our reality.    This world is like a school of life where we have the opportunity to learn through our own evolution that we are free, creative, loving beings.|`|2scdUqkMaa	Freedom is where you get to come and go as you please without someone trying to stop you.

Wright Mills      Freedom is what you do with what's been done to you.    By Jean-Paul Sartre        A right is not what someone gives you; it's what no one can take from you.    By Ramsey Clark        Everything can be taken from a man but ... the last of the human freedoms - to choose one's attitude in any given set of circumstances, to choose one's own way.

However loss and regret and a good heart made him realize the mistakes in his actions and he lived his life from the point of his sisters death until his own trying to make up for the terrible things he felt he did. Voldemort felt nothing but power and greed. he felt he deserved devotion and servitude from everyone. he demanded respect and settled for fear. But what did he do to deserve it? Nothing. He was cold hearted, ruthless, took everything he had for granted, and never learned anything from his mistakes. Dumbledore was the better man because he had the infinite power (the elder wand) he sacrificed everything for and didn't use it for personal gain.|`|OixcAoYxaa	I think Dumbledore is better because he doesn't murder people and he's not power hungry.|`|de80f2126a208e51cdc304e2b8211179aa	dumbledore is better because he is the good one.voldemort is evil.dumbledore has charm and all good qualities that a human being should have.that makes him the best.

1l69CCScaa	I took a logic course last year in university and I can tell you, with certainty (har har har), that logic is rarely absolute.  Logic falls into two general fields, deductive and inductive logic.  Deductive logic is used to discover self-evident truths.  For example:  a) All men are mortal  b) Bob is a man  c) therefore bob is mortal.    In deductive logic, syllogisms go from the general to the specific.  However, they are all contained systems.  For instance, our definition of "man" is that he is mortal.  Therefore it's just taking general truths and applying them to the specific.    The other form of logic is called inductive logic.  Inductive logic goes from the specific to general and often contains new information in the conclusion, is predictive, and has a margin for error.  Note: It doesn't need to contain all of those.  An example of inductive logic would be  a) the sun has risen every morning for the past ten thousand years  b) tomorrow morning doesn't look to be very different from those mornings mentioned in part a)  c) the sun will tomorrow    Pay close attention to how the syllogism moves from specific (observations) to the general (a predictive statement).  Inductive logic is never as conclusive as deductive logic as it doesn't find self-evidence truths within a closed system.  An example of inductive logic is the scientific method.  When we gather evidence we take specific examples of a certain thing.  After collecting and interpreting this evidence we can make a general rule about this thing.  However, we may still be wrong in our general rule because we're moving from the specific to the general.      Fun Fact: Both the creationist idea of "the world is too complex, it was made by a creator" and the secular "the world arose through natural processes" are statements found through inductive logic.  Therefore, both are fallible as they don't express self-evident truths.  Furthermore, can we really say one is more valid than the other if they are discovered via the same system?    Just a fun thought.  I'm a secularist because I think there's more evidence for it but I recognize, logically, that I could be wrong because of the process by which I arrived at my conclusion.|`|eY005pu8aa	Well, if by "logic" you mean human common sense, then there is no absolute but what you say is absolute. Logic is based upon the assumption that everything we think is inevitable is actually inevitable. We are human and are wrong a good deal of the time. Logic as I have come to understand it is based upon assumptions.|`|mXUKca6naa	...logically speaking...YES...  ...good luck...|`|X40Ww89qaa	you need to research i think|`|cJPOs7Tsaa	No.  Logic cannot always prove or disprove things. Often logic can only lead to a hypothesis, therefore it is not absolute. Or look at it this way:    I am often told that I am a highly logical thinker, and I'll admit to that. I am agnostic, which is probably due to this reason. I find it illogical to believe in God for a variety of good reasons. On the other hand, religious people may say it's illogical not to have faith since you risk damnation in the afterlife. You see, logic can often only lead you to BELIEVE in one thing or another, but a belief isn't necessarily absolute.

(i'm 26)|`|411c2df42c526e06e9d5cdbc8f4df48daa	The book Uglies by Scott Westerfield by far was the best book I have ever read. loved the whole saga, which includes the sequels, Pretties, Specials, and Extras. Don't forget Peeps, which is somewhat connected to the whole vampire/love story thing like Twilight is.    Have you ever read Angels and Demons by Dan Brown? Likewise, try Deception Point by the same author.    Definitely read The Kite Runner and A Thousand Midnight Suns. They are set in war-torn Afghanistan and explore the violence plaguing the Afgani people. They are extremely sad but riveting; I cried while reading the end of a Thousand Midnight Suns.    The Host by Stephanie Meyer was really good too. I liked the plot better than Twilight's. It's much more intellectual because it made you think a lot more.    Thrill Ride by Rachel Hawthorne was very cute. I loved every minute of it! It`s about a girl who gets a job at an amusement park away from her boyfriend and meets a new guy. By doing so, she realizes her boyfriend isn`t all that and manages to overcome her fear of heights.    The Chloe and Levesque Series and The Mike and Riel series were the books my friends and I were reading in the eighth and seventh grade. They're a collection of mysteries all solved by Chloe and Mike. I love them because they're so suspenseful and I almost never manage to figure out the culprit until the very end when they finally tell me.    The Prophecy of the Stones was originally written when the author, Flavia Bujor when she was just fifteen! Likewise, The Outsiders (even though you've probably read it) was written by a fifteen year old, S.E. Hinton as well. The plot and writing was well done.    Have you read the Shopaholic series? This is something I've read really recently and I've hit off with them. There's four in all and I've read 3 of them in the past four days.    Shanbanu and it's two sequels by Suzanne Fisher Staples were amazing. The first one is not a romance novel but I suggest you read it anyways. The next two are more loved based and they were all sad. I loved them. They gave me a new perspective of life, you know?    The Dating Game by Natalie Standiford. It's one of those fun books where you learn nothing but is really exciting.    Anything by Meg Cabot would work. Most of her books are heavy on the romance side. There's the Princess Diaries series (I've read those since the fifth grade, and I'm still reading them as they come out). Also, Queen of Babble was really good and funny. There's also Size 12 is Not Fat, Size 14 Is Not Fat, and Big Boned which are all in a series. However, in that series, Big Boned is the only love story in there.    There's also the Alice series by Phyllis Reynolds Naylor that follows a girl named Alice from third to tenth grade (where the last book left off). You feel like you're her friend as you can see the way she grows up without a mother and learns new things about life, friendship, and of course, boys. There's many subplots such as homosexuality (her friend, not her) and child molestation.    Speak by Laurie Halse Anderson is very dark and cryptic. It should be something everyone should read despite the questionable content. It's about a girl who goes to a high school party in the eighth grade and gets raped by a older boy. She calls the cops but doesn't tell them it was her who called or why so no one else knows what happens either. Because she called the cops, the students in high school all hate her because of her phone call. This is a great book about self realization.    The Face on the Milk Carton and its sequels are fantastic. About a girl named Jamie who realizes that she is adopted, she struggles with whether or not she fits in with her biological family or with the family she has been raised with for all this time.    After that, there's the obvious classics:  Jane Eyre by Charlotte Bronte is my favourite out of all of them. It's really well written and I liked the aspect of thinking that Jane has.    Pride and Prejudice by Jane Austen is very good as well. Personally, I wouldn't put it up with Jane Eyre though: that's just me.    Yeah, I'm a avid reader : )    And here's a bit of shameless self-advertising.

T7qgrOJzaa	Yes! But it was never my call to make since I'm not the bossman. I love my job and I love the people, but whenever I hear my boss bragging on how he made a couple of grand by screwing over one of the customers it makes me angry. It's never anything major, but I believe in doing what you say and saying what you do. Anything less than that is lying and I think people who depend on you to do a job should be able to trust that you are going to do said job to the best of your abilities, even if it means you don't make those few extra grand....sigh....Whatever happened to customer service?

I'm not picking on Christians, but this is just an example I have witnessed.    It's also why I find lobbyists detrimental to the political scene.

My position here isn't really one that would put me in a position to compromise my own morals and what I deem to be ethical behavior.  And since there are no jobs higher in my path here, there isn't anything that I can do to "get ahead".    Whether or not you should feel guilt about that behavior depends on the motivation.  Did you do something unethical to further your position in the company or for some form of additional compensation?  Was someone else's job put in jeopardy or was their character called into question because of your actions?  Morality and ethics are subjective, but that would make me feel guilty.|`|2r8iRceQaa	When I did work yeah there were times I knew it would have been right and just to knock this one manager out cold.

ghMJyzsOaa	I would be inclined to interpret this as being a fundamental truth, that clearly stipulates, whatever action we choose to execute will be reciprocated by others with equal or additional measure. We are to respond to people in a sensitive, understanding, respectful and patient manner, that will in turn, render those we encounter to treat us in the same way as we treat others. If we are quick to defame, chide or captiously judge the conduct of those, who for whatever reason agitates our inner-being, and so disconcerting our equilibrium, then we must expect the ensuing consequential reactions.     No one is perfect. I feel the glass house symbolizes the frailty of human kinds nature, and although we often delude ourselves into believing we are much stronger than what we really are, we often forget that we too are subject to weakness. When we live in the illusion that we are strong in some area, we can induce insensitive attitudes towards those who we consider to be weak in that same place, but the person who is weak could be strong in other areas where you are weak. And if we project the wrong attitudes to these individuals in our stronger states, when they see us struggling in our weakness, it is highly likely that they will return the same  attitudes.|`|1TPGdaXJaa	I think its a simple reminder to those who become so focused on themself that they forget about their own faults, yet blatently accuse other people of their faults...|`|NAGiNKFWaa	Well I think the way you have worded it that it means don't call someone something when you are also doing the same thing.  Like you shouldn't call someone a liar, if you have also lied.  Maybe you called someone a bad mother, and you yourself were not the greatest mother.  I think you also have to be careful about criticizing others, because you never know when your world could get knocked out from under you, and you could be in their shoes.|`|AA11951392	People only see in others what they don't want to see in themselves     "Good & Bad Traits"     Judging other people is a curious phenomenon. As we judge others we are actually judging ourselves. If we feel we must judge, we automatically place ourselves in a position of "better" in some way than the other person. Much negativity is associated with judging others, beginning with that essence of feeling somehow better or more worthy, or holier, or less materialistic, or more law-abiding, or less vain, etc. than another. So in this comparison of ourselves and the other, we lose any possibility of connection with the other.

If you're vulnerable (live in a glass house) don't kick *** and annoy people (throw stones) because they may retaliate and you would get badly hurt (because a glass house isn't much protection).    It makes a lot of sense to me, though it does sound like an unadventurous, safe way of living. To avoid the risk of stepping out and being forthright because you're afraid of being hurt by the comeback can be an unexciting and over-cautious way to live.|`|HpWujntlaa	It means that life is fragile and that you shouldn't create problems for yourself.

lPxVt2XYaa	The Brezhnev Doctrine -   "When forces that are hostile to socialism try to turn the development of some socialist country towards capitalism, it becomes not only a problem of the country concerned, but a common problem and concern of all socialist countries."    This was the doctrine that was used to justify the Warsaw Pact invasion of Czechoslovakia in 1968, after the (communist) government began to implement a series of reforms known as the Prague Spring (ironically these reforms, coupled with Lenin's retreat from socialism - the New Economic Policy, would provide the template for Gorbachev's reform programmes, Glasnost' and Perestroika).  It was also the doctrine that was used as a pretext to the Soviet Invasion of Afghanistan - as the (democratically elected) communists there were battling the Mujaheddin.      The doctrine allowed for some degree of local political autonomy, and each country did follow its own path to communism, notably in Hungary.  But any attempt to withdraw from the Warsaw Pact would be met with force.    The reaction of Eastern European countries was mixed: for Romania and Hungary, it signalled that they were able to pursue their own path - with little Soviet intervention.  For others, especially East Germany and Czechoslovakia, the governments clamped down on any non-authorised political expression, Czechoslovakia was a drab, grey and dreary country under Gustv Husk and East Germany was a grey police state.    The West's reaction to the doctrine was also mixed.  In public politicians made a lot of noise decrying the invasion, claiming that the Soviets had no right to intervene in Czech internal politics.  But they were not prepared to go to the country's aid to resist the invasion, and, as many people in the West pointed out, weren't the US engaged in a rather similar task in Vietnam?

The principle was proclaimed by Lenin as early as 1920.|`|DIlNnjf8aa	The "Brezhnev Doctrine" was Brezhnev's rationalization for intervention in Dubcek's Czechoslovakia. The idea was that it was the duty of each socialist country (i.e., communist) to maintain socialism in its own country and it was the duty of each socialist country to protect the other socialist countries. If such a country failed to do so, the other countries would have to "protect" it.    http://www.fordham.edu/halsall/mod/1968b...

dBkEqT2naa	There shouldnt' be a problem being a little idealistic with a hint of realism. But some people out there tend to find the existence of leaning alittle towards idealism as a huge thing because they have control issues. As long as your perspective is not going to sabotage your life, I don't see why there should be a problem thinking a little that way.|`|v2CmpNLAaa	One doesn't have to preclude the other. You can be idealistically rational just like you can be cautiously optimistic. Moderation in all things is the key.|`|KqwloDo7aa	No compromise at all is necessary.  Why ??    The reason there is no need to compromise between being rational and being idealistic is because.....    Perfection and Truth has nothing to do with either.....    As indicated in the reference, "Perfection does not come from projecting our own ideas but from awakening to the knowledge that it is already the established order of things."    How ?? Because neither Truth nor Perfection can change or BE changed.     This is not a matter of belief, either. We can choose to believe that 2+2=5 for eternity until we have acquired FOR OURSELVES the necessary knowledge of the immutable, PERFECT principle that correctly sums the answer. If you BELIEVE that 2+2=5, the ADVERSE EFFECT upon your perception of Truth remains, doesn't it? The correct answer CAN NEVER come out of erroneous perception or operation. THAT'S why it does not matter what we believe. Belief is what we choose to tell OURSELVES is true about Reality until we experience what IS true regardless what we believe. Experiencing what IS true about Reality is knowledge.    The principle that governs the operation of this mathematical equation works perfectly of its own accord and cannot BE altered. ONLY our erroneous perception and application of immutable Principle can.....be changed.     The correct answer CAN NEVER come out of erroneous perception or operation.     Please understand that I am only using this mathematical example as a metaphor for THAT which is not only real, but is also true, and which ALSO cannot change.     We have NOT awakened to the knowledge that PERFECTION is already the established order of things. Nor have we fully understood that neither Truth nor Perfection can change or BE changed.     WE ARE PERFECT EVEN AS OUR FATHER IN HEAVEN IS PERFECT because the Creator created US and ALL the principles of Life out of His Own perfect, Divine pattern whether we know that this is so, whether we do not believe this is so, or whether we are ignorant that this is so. Discovering that whether summed by believer, infidel, heretic, or boor, the demonstration that 2+2=4, perfectly, unchangeably demonstrates TRUTH for itself, doesn't it? The principle that governs the operation of this mathematical equation works perfectly of its own accord and cannot BE altered. ONLY our erroneous perception and application of immutable Principle can.....be changed.    So what does Perfection and Truth have to do with your question ??    Though we were ALL lovingly and perfectly created by our Father with PERFECT qualities, WE HAVE CHOSEN TO UTILIZE OUR FREE WILL TO PERCEIVE AND ACT as if the immutable Principles with which we were created could be utilized inconsistently with their original purpose. THAT is the problem.    This is about G I G O...    Garbage in, garbage out....perfectly !!    Imperfect input, imperfect output....invariably !!    NOT BECAUSE there is inherent EVIL in US!     NOT BECAUSE there is inherent EVIL in God's Creation.     NOT BECAUSE we are flawed or "born in sin and full of sin".    It is because this infinite SYSTEM was created by the same Source Who created perfect principles of Life, such as mathematics which operate undeviatingly to create ONLY 4 as the answer to 2+2. It is because the infinite SYSTEM of which we are an inseparable part operates flawlessly and impartially....    ALL the principles of Life operate that way, perfectly, without variation, deviation, or attenuation for anyone, at anytime, anywhere !! Otherwise, you would not know what electricity perfectly does FOR you when you utilize it correctly. Or you wouldn't know what electricity perfectly does TO you when operated incorrectly, either. If you consider this carefully, what is referred to as, goodness including love, patience, kindness, self-control, faithfulness and gentleness", is analogous to what the immutable principle of electricity does FOR you when operated consistent with its purpose. Conversely, what is referred to as "The acts of our brokenness, hatred, discord, sexual immorality, dissensions, greed, laziness, hatred, jealousy, fits of rage, drunkenness, envy, selfish ambition and the like....." are analogous to what the immutable principle of electricity does TO you when it is operated incorrectly.     The truth about God is the same as truth about the perfect operation of a mathematical equation: the principles by which the equation works and by which Creation works are equally accessible and PROVABLE by any and all, whether an individual perceives these principles or not. TRUTH is, and has been, TRUE BEFORE human beings even invented books, filled with scripture to fight over! TRUTH does not even NEED scripture or our disparate, "after the fact" interpretations to validate it!! PROVING TRUTH FOR YOURSELF is, and always has been, the acid test of validation.....regardless what you believe or what you call yourself.    So what does that have to do with us ?? The problem is all about OUR awareness and ignorance.    OUR OWN ignorance of the unchangeable, eternal Truth of ourselves (that we are perfectly created) is the DIRECT cause of sin and evil, PRECISELY like ignorance of the perfect operation of a mathematical equation ALWAYS and INVARIABLY produces incorrect results. There is an inescapable consequence to this perception, which is, simply, that you remain in error (in ignorance) of the truth, until you realize it AND act accordingly with it.     Dont believe me? Try MAKING 2+2=5. Doesnt work does it? We cannot even MAKE 2+2=4 either.   Why? Because neither Truth NOR Perfection can change or BE changed. THAT'S HOW you personally experience the immutable, perfect Truth of YOURSELF..... by direct experience OF IT (just like 2+2=4 or the "shock" of electricity is true). Then YOU KNOW the Truth, n|`|AA10616062	Rationalism is sufficient as an ideal; compromise is for the bourgeois.

Is there   something someone said that   jumps to mind? A joke you  heard early in the day,   prank, movie you saw, or a   place plays over in your mind?    The last words your co-worker  uttered to you before the day   ended swirls in your mind.    Write about it.    "My neighbor is from another  planet?" She complained.  "She doesn't understand anything  the first time it's explained."    One idea is a neighbor who  changes into an animal at night,  and looks for food to eat. It  could be the reason why the   neighbor needs a re-cap of  the language.     What an interesting plot.    You heard a joke. How many  cats does it take to meow  the first line of Silent  Night?     What could be done with that?    You were dared to prank  someone at work. The person  is your boss.    What twists and turns that   plot would take. The boss is  one of the guys, or stick to   the rules kind of person?    A movie keeps swirling   around your mind. What  view-point are you going   to use. What problem is  there? Make sure what you  write is from your imagination,  or research.     Once you're done, it should   be completely different from   the original.    "Why?" You asked.    It's good practice. Make it   original, avoid the   possibility of the L-word,   litigation. Or, have someone  say you copied it, and you're  not a real writer.    Is there a place that flows  to mind? A dream? It's a  place in the four corners   of your mind. Use it as a   back-ground for fiction, or  non-fiction.    In conclusion, there's no   shortage of where to get   writing ideas. They exist  in the words of co-workers,   jokes, a movie that plays   over in your mind, or a place.  The place may not be real,  but bring it to life.|`|GIsOtCrzaa	Ok, so if you want to write a book you need to be CREATIVE.  That means no asking people what you should write on!

When I was in school, we got to pick and choose a couple of lessons, like drop them or whatever after a certain point, but never got to arrange our own schedule like Edward attempted to.    And we had a weekly timetable that was the same, but not a daily one that was. Imagine having the same lessons in the same order every day. It would've driven me mad. I feel sorry for Americans if this really is the case. How monotonous.|`|SYKGIiQkaa	Yes. Most high school kids in America are on the same schedule every day. In college this changes.    They have one of two formats for their schedule:    a) They either go to eight classes for one hour each.    b) They go to four classes for almost two hours. This is called the block schedule and at mid-term they get four more classes.    Basically you can pick your classes but not your teachers.|`|d267fab7a0b268922f3228351f52baf1aa	I think it depends on the school.  In High School I had a the same classes at the same time three days a week M-W-F then different classes two days a week T-Th then each semester my schedule changed.  I did have an opportunity to change my schedule within the first few weeks but usually nothing major and just so I could fit in required credits for graduating.    ---  The same is true of college as well you select courses to get credits toward your degree.  You have a set schedule a few days a week and then change as the semester changes.  I can't imagine you get the same lessons if you have a different class schedule everyday.|`|nEhDpDMVaa	Yes most american schools are like the are in twilight.

That means we have 4 classes for 90 mins. and then get 4 new ones half way thru the year.  I like this way much better!  We don't have separate buildings for each class like in Twilight.

Most school start between 7:00 and 9:00 AM everyday (depending on the school) and end between 2:00 and 4:30 PM.  A student will have the same classes everyday for the most part--usually divided between six or seven "periods."  A sophmore's schedule, for instance, may be something like this:    1st: English  2nd: Geometry  3rd: Choir  4th: History  Lunch  5th: Spanish  6th: Biology    Some schools are very different (there are many charter schools that have completely different schedules), but almost ALL public schools are like this.    Hope this helps.|`|BZxkDecZaa	This depends on the school. There is no absolute standard schedule throughout any country. The main types of schedules are:    a. semestered--same schedule everyday until end of semester.

Non-semestered can be broken into two types though, subjects that are taken everyday for shorter class periods and having different subjects on different days for longer periods of time.    c. some schools have hybrids where there are both semestered and non-semestered classes    hope this helps!!|`|B63fwyW5aa	I totally agree i LOVE twilight (and edward/rob) anyway thats what i was thinking they always have biology and english etc... good question i really wanna no!!also im kinda suprised that you (as a boy) read it (which is a VERY good thing) !!!!!! :)|`|z81JIycpaa	I think that all of them. It helps them concentrate. I think it sounds a lot easier, but prefer switching subjects each day. I am glad you think Twilight is enjoyable. I think so too, and the other books are even better!  Here is a link to Edward and Bella's timetables. But remember, Edward can use his looks to get around the staff and manipulate them into getting his subjects moved.    Ugh, I cannot find it. But when I do, I will email it to you. Sorry! I think that Edward has the same subjects as Bella, except last period when Bella has Gym.    xxx GG

d267fab7a0b268922f3228351f52baf1aa	Gothic fiction (sometimes referred to as Gothic horror) is a genre of literature that combines elements of both horror and romance.  The effect of Gothic fiction depends on a pleasing sort of terror, an extension of essentially Romantic literacy pleasures that were relatively new at the time.    ---   Prominent features of Gothic fiction include terror (both psychological and physical), mystery, the supernatural, ghosts, haunted houses and Gothic architecture, castles, darkness, death, decay, doubles, madness, secrets and hereditary curses.    The stock characters of Gothic fiction include tyrants, villains, bandits, maniacs, Byronic heroes, persecuted maidens, femmes fatales, madwomen, magicians, vampires, werewolves, monsters, demons, revenants, ghosts, perambulating skeletons, the Wandering Jew and the Devil himself.    Romanticism is a complex artistic, literary, and intellectual movement that originated in the second half of the 18th century in Western Europe, It was partly a revolt against aristocratic social and political norms of the Age of Enlightenment and a reaction against the scientific rationalization of nature, and was embodied most strongly in the visual arts, music, and literature.      The literature of the time embodied classical landscapes, archetypal heroines, quests, and defeat against evil at a time when urban development was taking a firm hold and society was feeling trapped by the actual size of industrialism.|`|qyS1RC2yaa	http://answerr.isimo-spain.com  A very informative website, you can also get much information in website

kkhz2hJEaa	No! Hufflepuff qualities are hard work, perseverance and loyalty. Hufflepuffs are a very important addition to Hogwarts. Ernie McMillan and Hannah Abbott are some fine examples|`|vFF5vwqsaa	Yeah, both hufflepuff and ravenclaw are mediocre and don't seem to add to anything.|`|tZF1FO7saa	sadly yes|`|f01jXc8naa	From what JKR says, Hufflepuffs are Hufflepuffs because they are hardworking and like others say (Slytherin especially), because they are dull.    But yeah seriously, i sometimes think It is that way, but then there's Cedric Diggory.    But Hardworking IS a quality too and maybe they didn't make their choice because they didn't know they could make choices.. Lol    (RANDOM:  Like Ravenclaws have to answer a question everytime, what do HufflePuffs have to do? HARD LABOUR?  HAHAHAHA|`|phH2dVYZaa	Well, Helga Hufflepuff said she'd treat the lot    But if they don't fit into the other houses they still have qualities - hard working, loyal, etc    And RAVENCLAWS DO SO CONTRIBUTE WE ARE THE NERDS. Where would life be without nerds?    Back off of Ravenclaw, man|`|5aLWqRL0aa	Hufflepuff's are really nice people|`|VlzPRzQaaa	Interesting question.  It's funny that two qualities of Hufflepuff help make the qualities of other houses.  Hufflepuff are known to be loyal.  It is loyalties to friends/family that often make people brave.  For example, many soldiers claim they were brave in combat, and able to overcome fear, due to loyalty to their comrades.  We see this in Harry, Hermione, and Ron, often doing brave things out of loyalty for others.  And of course you can't be clever without being hard working.  Again, see Hermione.  You almost get the feeling that Hufflepuffers could have been sorted into other houses.  At one point, the Sorting Hat does seem to indicate that Hufflepuff was almost for the left overs, which seems unfair.  But I think ultimately it was better for JKR to work with four houses instead of three.|`|P9S5wlLyaa	Hufflepuff does have some genuine qualities, like hard work, patience, loyalty. But yeah, if there is a kid who had no bravery, brains, or cunning, he would just be put into Hufflepuff, probably.    Then again, a kid with no brains, work ethic or cunning would be put into Gryffindor.    So, really, to answer your question. Hufflepuffs are sorted there because they don't fit in any other house. But that's why Gryffindors are in Gryffindor, and why Ravenclaws are in Ravenclaw, and so on. Because they don't fit anywhere else.|`|8YumJzcOaa	Yes and no, like many of Rowling's characters and concepts the House of Hufflepuff is both simple and complex.  Simply put Hufflepuff "takes the rest."  However, the legend of Helga Hufflepuff says that she was by far the most egalitarian of the 4 founders of Hogwarts and her one standard for admittance was a willingness to work hard and learn.  To my mind this makes Hufflepuff as interesting a house as either Slitherin or Gryffindor.|`|ZNvterQyaa	no they belong in hufflepuff
vrcxxRr8aa	Meyer is a Mormon. Many of the Mormons I've met don't like hearing swear words much less saying them. As silly as the phrase "Holy crow" is, she probably says it herself, and incorporated that into the book.

Evidently, Stephenie Meyer thought that plain old 'holy cow' was too profanatory, and opted for her own invented phrase.    Epic. Fail.|`|v70p2kgWaa	Actually holy cow is classified as a "bad phase" and not because of anything connected to what comes out the end.    To say "holy cow" suggests worshiping a Pagan deity (it's in the bible that worshiping a cow, ie calling it holy, is against God's wishes).   How that converts to LDS doctrine and why Meyer would avoid it I don't know; however, some christians consider holy cow to be a worse oath.|`|5e352a812d7c8557bf819f8eac70367baa	I agree with the first 2, and I just wanted to say I thought the second person wrote " Stephanie Meyer is a moron" and I thought that was awesome =)|`|uSouun2saa	Actually, my english teacher says holy cow and holy crow.

a79b8a93426576f5d2c9cb6a23ba338faa	Bertrand Russell's "History of Western Philosophy" is one of two very BIASED "histories" of Philosophy that I advise people to stay away from; the other is "Modern Philosophy" by Roger Scruton.     I read Russell's "history" of Philosophy early on in my Philosophical quest, and it biased me against some of the smartest Philosophers - like Bergson, Nietzsche, and Schopenhauer.  I have listed below three fair histories of Philosophy that I recommend instead of reading Russell.      1) "The Story of Philosophy" by Will Durant - get both sets of the audio CDs and listen to them over and over.    2) "Socrates to Sartre: The Philosophical Quest" by LZ Lavine    3) "A History of Philosophy" by Frederick Copelston|`|ETFaQiTzaa	This isn't the first time you've mentioned it.

Wow...I just realized how long it's been since I've covered any philosopher...  Now I want to sit down and re-read "The Fragile Absolute" to make myself feel better.|`|kArshanMaa	Bertrand Russell's History of Western Philosophy is amusing, but suffers from defects ... First, it deals largely with ancient philosophy, and is curt and selective in its treatment of the post-Cartesian tradition. Secondly, it is dismissive towards all those philosophers with whom Russell felt no personal affinity. Thirdly, it shows no understanding of Kant and post-Kantian idealism. It is, for all that, a classic of wit, elegance and resolute idiosyncrasy.    that's what I believe|`|JlVvAkXSaa	It was awesome.  Everyone else I guess doesn't realize that it is an overview of philosophy from Russell's perspective.  It gives you his perspective and you deal with it, you don't just let Russell bias you.  That is pretty weak willed if all it takes is someone saying A for you to assimilate A.

H55nCLqPaa	If I could point to one factor that led to Rome's demise I'd say it was the Marian reforms. The reforms gave Rome a professional army rather than a citizen militia, which was good for expansion but made the overthrow of the Republican system utterly inevitable. The old pattern Roman armies had simply been the Roman people under arms. Now it was a separate entity entirely with allegiance primarily to it's commander. No matter how successful Scipio Africanus may have been as general he could never had lead his legions back after Zama and taken Rome for himself, for the very people who stood to lose from this were the troops under his command. Yet the imperial period is has numerous examples of Roman legions simply declaring their commander to be emperor.     Once this happened the competence of the emperors could not be assured as it takes only a cursory glace of Roman history to see this.  It also lead to abject idleness on the part of the once vigorous Roman people. By 300 AD 80% of the legions were non Italians. In fact some of Rome's greatest enemies such as Hermann and Alaric had served in or with the legions. Training foreigners to fight for you because your own citizens are too lazy is asking for trouble.|`|BfmV2KpUaa	A number of factors contributed to the collapse of Romes Western Empire. Those you already mentioned, wide-scale corruption, and increasing threat from the 'Barbarian' hoardes on the fringes of the Empire.  The monetary system had collapsed and the people had resorted to a barter system long before the Saxons over-ran the city and deposed the Emperor.   The overall cause which led to the collapse of the Roman system of government and its trade empire can be summed up with the phrase "over-expansion and inner-decay".|`|94bc2dec827aab848ba69cb5895f7ba6aa	There were many economic reasons for the fall of Rome. One of these was that she had grown very dependent on slave labor; slaves tilled her fields and worked her mines.  Once the supply of slaves dried up - when conquest was done - Rome should have chosen to adapt to a productive, high-wage economy; where value-adding skilled labor could replace the work done by slaves.  She did not adapt that way, therefore the economy stalled, and this helped lead to the fall.    NB If you're doing research on this, you'll get better results if you search for ECONOMIC reasons for the fall of Rome...'financial' issues would be a much more limited field, limiting you to issues concerning Roman banks and (only to a LIMITEd degree) govt. finances.|`|fSkAXTefaa	It was more of a political issue. The empire had become simply too big to manage at that time in history with poor communications and travel time from Rome to another point taking sometimes weeks or even  months. Rome was already split into two empires by then--the Western Empire with Rome as the capital and the Eastern Empire with Constantinople as its capital. Two empires, two emperors. A nation divided won't last long.    Also there was too often a changing of the Roman emperors because of discontent within the military. The emperors were dependent upon their praetorian guard for protection; ruffle the feathers of the guard and you have an assassinated emperor. Emperors changed sometimes twice within a few year's time.    And don't forget the rising Christian influence. As more and more people turned to Christianity, the less they depended on Rome and its corruption.|`|iJzIIEdfaa	It was generally a combination of many factors.    Territorially, it was too large and had already become so unwieldy that they had to split it into two separate entities. Even so, governors in the Iberian and African provinces generally ruled without thought to the will of Rome/Ravenna.    Militarily, the Western Empire drew heavily on the settled 'barbarians' as troops as well as hiring mercenaries and at times entire tribes (Vandals). Edward Gibbons also contends that the Christian virtues of peace and tranquility were at odds with the Roman desire for combat and conquest and over time diminished the martial ethos of the Roman people.    Financially, Roman currency was very inflated and corruption was rampant. The Germanic mercenaries who were more expensive to maintain than native troops. The increasngly powerful Church (especially after Attila was driven off by Leo) demanded large donations from their nobility at the same time advocating massive charity drives for the poor.    Holistically, the stirring of the Huns and the Mongols in the steppe was driving many less powerful (but still formidable) tribes into the Roman Empires as well as into Sassanian Persia. While the West fell to barbarian hordes, the East persevered for several centuries more before falling to a tribal group from the steppe called (the Turks). Ironically, the Sassanian Empire were later also felled by a 'barbarian' peoples called the Arabs.|`|ip5EWw7uaa	Not sure that is the whole story - but something along those lines.

Well, there is no such thing as someone deciding to 'radicalise' Muslims. The thing is: When the Soviet Union invaded Afghanistan at the end of the 1970s and the beginning of the 80s, the U.S. government saw this as a threat to its interests in the nearby Gulf region, also as part of its 'Cold War' with the U.S.S.R. and its fight against Communism. So, the U.S. decided to support anyone fighting the Soviets.       At that time, tensions between East and West was at its highest, and when Muslims saw the Soviets invading a Muslim country, they got angry and some were calling for 'jihad' or holy war against the Western invader. Some Muslim countries like Saudi Arabia, Pakistan, Egypt, and many others had started to aid financially, and some of its 'youth' wanted to go and fight the Soviets, so the governments didn't stop them. The U.S. learned about this and welcomed this opportunity, since it didn't want to risk sending its on troop which would trigger a third world war. With this, fighters from across the Muslim world and even from the UK went to Afghanistan, of course sneaking from Pakistan. Most of the fighters or 'mujahideen' were Arabs, half of them from Saudi Arabia, and one of them was Osama Bin Ladin, who beside his wealth, he got support from the U.S., too (only at that time). After all, it is said 'The enemy of my enemy is my friend'.       After the end of the war, and the coming of the 1990s, no one knew what to do with the foreign fighters who returned to their own countries, since most of them were unemployed to begin with. As a result, the worst scenario happened: some veteren fighters became radicalised, and some of the younger generations idiolized them, and some were frustrated with the West, and U.S. policy in the Middle East specifically. That's how all this 'terrorism' began, and it all began with Soviet- Afghan war in the 1980s.      The bottom line unfortunately: You reap what you sow.

AA11219693	We all mean to be good in the end. We all intend to do good thing sin the world in own special way. We all like to believe that the way we understand our situation and the reasons we use to get things done better than any one else. And when we manage to assure ourselves against any risk to doing something too bad, we take liberty to use whatever means possible to reach our end goals.     I think there are also people who would deceive themselves about the reality of their intentions. The people who might not allow themselves see far enough into the consequences of things, or the ones too desperate in their needs of an ambition, desire or a dream that they would not see the reality of their so called doing good. We all need certain amount of hope and faith. We all need to know to a greater degree of certainty that whatever we are doing we are doing for right reasons. We all need justification for our actions, and this justification we find first by making sure that our intentions are right to start with and the rest we leave at the discretion of good heavens.     This however is just one critical way to look at things as good intentions can also be refined to be really good, and strong. We can ensure that if we licence ourselves by the authority of good intentions then we remain good throughout until we achieved what we set out to achieve. The saying that road to hell is often paved with cobblestones of good intentions then it is only to highlight the irony of our behaviour.|`|V60mZea1aa	No, it just over emphasizes that it is not good to be a procrastinator|`|TSDQtFpSaa	Not.

I wouldn't have a problem killing what I will eat (well, that isn't quite true, it wuld gross me out but I would still do it).    I do it all the time, with fish.  I love fishing and eat what I catch.  Not fond of the guts and the smells they can sometimes present, but you can,t have everything easy.    people sometimes find it morally indefensible but I figure humans are cornivores, and death is inherent to life, so killing to eat is just the way it is.    And there is nothing that we eat that wasn't alive beforehand.|`|HxlRHy3Daa	well obviously id feel really bad out killing a creature and probably end up getting sick ramming one those bullet things into their skull but  when you think of how nice and succulent meat is i suppose you would block all that out  and from an economical point of view agriculture is one of my countries (ireland) main exports so yeah its kinda needed|`|wBE7MQojaa	Well, i really wouldnt be able to answer that, because I would only make that choice in that situation.

n99NOgHJaa	I really do! I think they are an important way to relay history ( or art) that cannot just be shown in text books.It gives a visual learning experience and makes it more interesting to a wider range of people.Little kids who can't read yet may look at giant dinosaur and suddenly spark an interest in learning about them.

NYU37jfGaa	WEll, it would depend on various factors such as what part of the 20th century you are thinking of, where in Britain the women lived, what class they belonged to etc.  In the early 20th century for example, a lot of girls (and boys) would have left school young to go to work.  Women would generally be paid less than men for doing the same work, and some jobs would not have been open to women.  Married women would generally stay at home if they could afford to, having to work after marriage was not seen as a desirable option for most women before the 1970s.    During World War One, a lot of women worked in jobs that had previosuly been thought suitable only for men.  The women's police force was formed for example, and the Women's Auxilliary Army, Navy and Airforce.  Women over 30 got the vote in 1918, and women over 21 in 1928.    A lot of women worked in domestic service prior to WW2, and anyone who could afford it employed servants to do the housework.  Even a couple on quite a modest income could at least afford to employ a maid of all work.  If a family were well off and could afford to employ several servants, a married woman could lead an extremely lesiurely life.  See for example E.M. Delafield's Diary of a Provincial Lady or Jan Struther's Mrs Miniver.    From the 1960s onwards, the idea of 'having it all' became popular with women, the notion that in order to be fulfilled you must have a career and a husband and a family, and do the lot.  some women with great stamina managed to do this.  Others (me for instance) decided that this was overrated.  There was a decline in the number of people working as servants, but on the other hand households had more labour-saving devices, making life easier for women.    By the end of the 20th century, women had equal pay with men and there were no jobs that were not open to women.  We had had a female Prime Minister for a whole decade.  Women had all the equality they could possibly want, yet still seemed disgruntled, for some reason.  Feminists like Germain Greer continued to write books about the general beastliness of men.    As in any other century and place, some women were happier than others.

There are many - for example, I live in Hotwells, Bristol, and in the last century that was a very slummy area, but it has been well and truly yuppified! Calvert street and the railway triangle in Derby is a similar, now rather twee area. And there are parts of Liverpool and Manchester, Glasgow, in fact most major cities with such a history.    The shameful thing is that the old victorian slums have mostly be turned into rather nice places to live, but we have modern slums, sink estates that rival the worst of the victorian slums.|`|EVnlDpPUaa	Not many left now.|`|DSp8azw7aa	Bermondsey, London is one I can think of.|`|TSAl7ZX1aa	They were known as Rookeries or Stews in Dicken's time, Oliver Twist is based around the Jacob's Island.

Most cities that had docks and got a lot of ships going in and out used to slum areas. So cities with docks would be Liverpool, Manchester, Bristol and Newcastle-upon-Tyne, those just off the top of my head.  They were only slums because the people who lived there were on the poverty line and were living in rented houses.  The landlords would not carry out any repairs to the houses and everything was falling around the tenants ears. No work, no pay and poor living conditions made places slums.

Another option:    You can also try to put plastic over the ride, but be sure you completely cover the cymbal. That way, when you strike it, part of the sound will be cut off in the plastic's lack of oxygen (lack of air), and there will be a lesser sound. Sound travels through air when it is sliced through air. Remember shock waves and sonic booms? You'll get the picture.    Final option: Put something under the ride cymbal to mute it. Perhaps a cymbal cover will do but you need to nail it or rope it to attach it.    Good luck.
U0ouUrQBaa	Basically yes, but in part you have to remember that every time you move back a generation you double your blood line, so you could have anything in there,  Remember that Britain is a miss match of various peoples who have come to our shores over the years, that's what makes us who we are.|`|AA12343309	In the U.S.,  it means some place back down the line you probably have at least one English ancestor, maybe more.   In the U.S. we have blended down through the years.|`|FOTanZ3Faa	Assuming your family didn't take the name of their own accord; i.e. changing their name via Deed Poll etc, then I would assume it's been in the family for centuries.     Try looking the name up to confirm that it is an English name. Sometimes names that are very popular in English-speaking countries are not always English by origin.     http://www.ancestry.com/learn/facts/defa...    If it is of English origin, I would say your paternal line (i.e. the males all the way up), from around the 1100s, were English. That's the approximate time surnames seem to have been dished out, but of course, there were people before then who had them.     Before surnames came along; who's to say wher your ancestors were from? Even if they were considered English, their parents could have been from anywhere. remember though, the women in your family could also be from anywhere. 99% of the time their names are dropped upon marriage.|`|9tMNpFmEaa	unless the name changed slightly over the years, or someone in your family got their name changed.|`|roPhZmskaa	Maybe or maybe not make that genealogy test to be sure http://www.igenea.com/index.php?c=27|`|4J8X1aKkaa	It's probable but not guaranteed.    1. Slaves in the U.S. took the names of their masters who were often British. Ec. Jackson.    2. In the U.S. it was common for immigrants, especially non-English speakers, to be assigned a name. That name might be the same as a name of British descent. Ex. Smith.    3. You may have an ancestor that was an immigrant, fugitive, or ethnically different that changed their name to something British sounding and entirely made up intentionally to either fit in or to hide.    4. Adoption.  Opinions vary on genealogical value, but it's possible you have British adoptive ancestors, but no biological link to them.    5. Babies often take the name of the man the mother marries. This may or may not have been the father. If he was British and mum wasn't this would give a non-Brit baby a Brit name.     1 and 2 are U.S. specific examples, but they happened other places as well.|`|417da37d532bf36f7a772f2a8383b3f1aa	Not always, some people, like myself, have a different surname.

I don't see Santa as "transcending being", so I'd have to say the same about god.    The problem with quotes like these is that they allow for anyone to define god in any way they please.  THink about it, what possible evidence is there that god has this quality?  This is a result of someone sitting around and thinking of ways to ensure that god, who has never been seen, heard, or sensed in any way, can't be defined and therefore "disproven".    You just claim that he is so far outside of comprehension that all u have to do is believe, which is utter malarkey.|`|AkFag8tNaa	I think being can be defined and God cannot be defined (except maybe as love and knowing but those are pretty broad definitions) so God is above being.|`|DSp8azw7aa	He is saying that God is beyond the range of human experience.|`|6AqdyWgzaa	I agree with dude too but leave the tooth fairy out of this because I've got the quarters to prove he's real.

TSDQtFpSaa	I think that sex without love is worse. if you truly love someone sex isn't what you need. it's something that's nice to have. sex without love never completes what we really want. after sex without love there comes a feeling that most deny. there's never completion and every time it happens with another person the emptiness becomes greater. i think you shouldn't have sex with anyone unless you love them more than sex could show. like if you got married to someone you love extremely and they got into an accident and weren't able to have sex anymore. does that mean divorce? Love should always come before sex or don't have sex at all. it is possible to control ourselves. :)|`|2OmMokyaaa	Sex without love, of course.

It's responsible for the spread of the STD epidemics and the death of hundreds of thousands after terrible suffering.    It's also the ultimate selfish act, and the ultimate cheapening of personhood.    However love without sex happens all the time: between parents and children, friends, God and his people. It's the healthiest form. The sex thing can ruin a loving relationship.  Sex has its place but it can never be the main thing. Even great sex doesn't last forever.

bba752d4f64173133e17b4f45bb50355aa	Your poem is one which anyone and everyone can relate to -- i know i can. I enjoyed it because i could visualize all this in my head.     Now, poet to poet. I feel you need to get your ideas across in a much stronger way. I feel once the reader gets to the 5th paragraph your words lose strength. The expression, for a lack of better words, is thin here.     Overall, i liked your poen very much :)|`|dcovK6oqaa	very nice poem i lost a friend when i was nine. he was such   a sweetheart. well I think its a great poem because it helps you get over the death of someone although you never really get over it.|`|2mWjyFXFaa	yup....fine dude...  it is good|`|ih8PG93Laa	i think it's really good, I can relate =)    but you missed the word "sham(e)"
5llBXFF4aa	Many anti-slavery people in the North felt that it wasn't a compromise as much as a surrender to slave powers.  In that sense it was not well-liked, although even those who were against it understood it was the only thing standing between Union and war.  It was the violation of that series of agreements and the repeal of the Missouri Compromise of 1820 that led to the formation of the Republican Party, form on an anti-slavery platform. This, in turn, led to the decision by the slaves powers in the 1850's to begin their plans of rebellion.|`|xQwU590Laa	It had to be hammered out.  As apposed to being a forgery?
9qxUndqFaa	Being a layout artist is good if you want to do something creative, but are not highly educated or talented enough to be a graphic designer or fine artist. It can also be a good stepping stone to these other, higher-end careers, but if they are your goal, you must remain focused on your career path. Many people become layout artists because freelancing is too demanding or they want a steady check or benefits. Another option is to do both. Be a layout artist by day, and do freelance design work at night. (or vice versa)     Being a layout artist can be mentally demanding. You need to know a great deal about the technical aspects of printing, file prep, many different programs and support programs. Work is always done on tight deadlines, and always seems to take longer than the time you have. You must be meticulous in detail, a careful proofreader and precise in your actions. Be ready to keep a very accurate accounting of your time because bosses never understand 'what took you so long.'     Contrary to popular belief, being a good layout artist involves more than putting pretty pictures on a page and choosing a nice font. It does take intelligence, talent, and efficiency, and never gets the credit that a higher level position like art director or graphic designer does.|`|AA11079786	I can't say anything about the salary, but I worked as an amateur layout editor for our school's magazine, and I really liked the work. It's really creative work, and you have the two pleasures of creating your own decorative art, via the more creative pages, and working with a lot of other people's high-quality work.
ZSesESvOaa	I really liked Magic Bites and Magic Burns by Ilona Andrews   The House of Night Series was good but got a bit sexual  I just read Touch the Dark and aside from a few sex scenes it was so much fun for me with all types of magical elements and I just loved Cassandra.  I also liked the Southern Vampire series but that is really sexual too aside from the sex it is loads of action and adventure and more supernatural worlds to explore.    I have a blog where I review what I have read so if you like the types of books I have mentioned you can check out what I thought of them.  http://darknovels.today.com/|`|4f277076c7dd369d5ac6ab9f14e344f6aa	If you go to Amazon.com type in the books you like, they will refer you to a book just like it on the front page.|`|b4WfncIhaa	You should check out Melanie Rawn's Dragon Prince series and Dragon star series, as well as the Exiles series.

If it makes you feel better, bring your dance bag with your taps and such in case they give you time to change or offer a tap portion of the audition.     Just make sure you resume and headshot are up to date/snuff, make sur eyour music is clearly and properly cut and marked, get plenty of sleep the night before, and make sure you're warmed up before you go.

NYU37jfGaa	I would not like to live in the Victorian age, but I would very much like to visit.  I would love to see the Great Exhibition at the Crystal Palace for instance, and Queen Victoria, and go to a Victorian Music Hall.  And I'd like to hear Charles Dickens give one of his famous public readings.  And I'd like to go for a ride on a coach.    If I had to live there though, I would like to be a nanny in an interesting household, perhaps even a Royal nanny.  It would be interesting to be able to observe the Queen and Prince Albert up close.|`|UhAHaOWFaa	I would love to visit but not live, Victorian England was full of cholera, sewage filled streets, abuse in factories, child executions, etc.|`|7ByBv52Eaa	Na it would be way boring and totally super not cool. If i had to go back tho i would be a pimp|`|DSp8azw7aa	I would want to be Mary Poppins.|`|L4z1FI5Kaa	I'd go with Stanley to Australia, if returning was obligatory.  The mortality among the "lower orders" was horrific and not much better among the "nobs".  We dread the word "cancer" these days, but have forgotten smallpox, tyhpoid, cholera, diphtheria, pulmonary tuberculosis, the death rate among new born babies and whole villages decimated by measles, whooping cough and even influenza.  We forget the working conditions with little pay - office clerks having to take their own coal to work in the winter or freeze, no annual holidays, working by candlelight, well into the night.  Domestically it was lttle better, the tin bath hung on a nail in the back yard, having to take a candle to bed (no electricity), a guzunder under the bed - only a privvy down the yard.  Washing in cold water in a bowl or sluicing under a public tap, even having to pump up your water from a well (into the 1950's!)  Making your own sanitary protection from old rags and having to wash them for reuse  One of my Victorian ancestors was a coal haulier from the age of 8 years - he walked 4 miles to the pit and 4 miles back after an 8-hour shift 6 days a week (he did say "the leather girdle didn't hurt him" according to a Government report).  He had learned to read and write a little at a Wesleyan Sunday school.  So I guess with that routine he never had a chance to get into much mischief (especially with the local Bobby still allowed to give a swift backhander without taking a child to Court - I suffered one of those backhanders for nicking apples!).  I would opt for the wide open spaces as far away from Towns and Victorian occupations as I could get.|`|2AJmAD0Xaa	If I could drop in for  a visit it would be great but to be locked in that age with what I know today would fill me with great fear. Medical science has come a long way since then and child mortality would be a real issue for me. There would still be double standards on moral issues as there is today and human beings would still have the same nature that they have today. If I was to find work it would probably be in a kitchen somewhere as people always have to eat and there would be some job security. In my spare time I would probably write a lot of letters. I would do painting and sketching as I do today.|`|H1TZzRBkaa	No! The slums were really bad, disease was everywhere, i would probably move to Australia and make a living there.

P02L0DTNaa	After Hurricane Katrina the US government established a Disaster Response Plan. Basically the plan establishes response teams under the control of one Director. This 1 Director has 5 other Directors reporting into him/her. Those 5 Directors each have up to 5 directors reporting into them. Each Director is responsible for a specific item such as emergency equipment, medical teams, transpiration teams, press relations, communications etc.etc. This assures that there is no   no duplication of services.  It was discovered that one director can effectively direct 5 other directors. After five another Director is set in place and he too get to direct up to 5 Directors.    Basically the team starts out with 1 director and 5 sub directors the team grows as circumstances dictate and on the same hand decreases accordingly.|`|BgBT373Zaa	try studying class X disaster manegment book published by NCERT,India
Bx6xTLRbaa	Getting a dance job is hard enough but getting one that pays really well is super hard. But if you believe in your ability and you know you're good then go for it. Colleges don't offer hip hop classes (very sad), they focus on ballet. But you don't want to be living paycheck to paycheck wondering what will happen if you don't land a job. Make sure you have a backup plan. Why don't you go to college but continue taking classes and training harder than ever. Then over the summer, audition for jobs. Like being in commercials or competitions or whatever it takes to get your name out there. Post vids of your dancing on youtube, get some feedback. If you're completely sure of yourself and you know this is your passion and you truly believe that college isn't the way to go then train harder and harder, get an agent, move to LA and audition, audition, audition! Like I said, it's always nice to have that security like a backup plan. Just be smart, but follow your dreams!!!|`|CAFtF2Uraa	I'm a senior and I too had a hard time picking what I'm going to take up in college. Look at what you're good at and what you enjoy doing. Don't rush things and if you think that you haven't found what you want to do in life yet, there's still time to discover your hidden talents and there's still time to be interested in things you've never been interested in before. Pick carefully, you don't want to have to change your course when you are already in colllege; that would only be a waste of time and money.  Remember Einstein's saying: pick a job that you love and you'll never have to work again in your whole life :)    Good Luck! :)

Much debate still continues to this day as to how Captain Smith died. There were conflicting accounts from survivors. One stated that they saw the Captain walk calmly onto the bridge as the icy waters poured in, another that he shot himself with a pistol, and yet another claimed that they saw him swimming to a lifeboat with a baby in his arms. It's easy to understand that people may have confused him with another ships officer in the general panic.    Ironically in 1907, five years before the Titanic's fateful maiden voyage, he did give the following quote to a journalist;   "I never saw a wreck and never have been wrecked, nor was I ever in any predicament that threatened to end in disaster. My career can be described as having been quite unremarkable."|`|hNa5oHxQaa	he went down with the ship.|`|qDSvOOwBaa	Come on people think--I know absolutely nothing about the Titanic and even I know he was blamed for all the deaths by the British board of trade.

This is an insurance issue.  Once the captain leaves, then the ship is considered salvage, and anyone can claim her.
iJxGAaASaa	rather than fulfilling the requirement to be considered as beautiful, i find it more as the lack of many things such as ugliness, corruption, and yet overall perfectness as well, and many more.  the beauty of it is simple!  of course most of it, if to describe an individual, comes from the inside.  if to describe a feeling, it comes from your inside.  i guess it's the power of something to evoke your feelings.|`|6AqdyWgzaa	It's in the eyes of the bee holder.    Seriously though folks if you want to see beauty, look at anything nature created within the last hour. If you want to see ugly look at anything man created within the last 10 years.    But to answer your question specifically a person is beautiful when they are honest.|`|Q13xObjhaa	Beauty is w/in a person  it is a person;c characteristic n their personality   dat mkes a person beautiful. not lux|`|TSDQtFpSaa	beauty: 1(for a person)someone who carries themselves in a good way; someone who has confidence in themselves 2(for a thing)something that looks wonderful in the eyes of the beholder    i think everyone has beauty but it is sometimes hidden underneath what they think makes them beautiful. we were all created beautiful. everybody. :)|`|TEaVbinlaa	Anything you look and makes you feel good or maybe hungry (not literally).|`|HpWujntlaa	Beauty is when something is the way that it should be. It shows the potential of the world to do right. That's why we look at a flower and see that it is beautiful, but we don't see a trash heap as beautiful. When a square peg goes into a square hole it makes you feel good but when you try to make a square peg go into a circle hole you don't.

Adult content but he's funny tragic works in the gray area of crime and the people who chase down the criminals. Gone, Baby, Gone will blow you away. Mystic River is terrifying in its intensity.    Richard Price is still the better writer. Freedomland is his best work.    Now you said fun. Maybe these aren't for you. I don't want to mislead you. Firestarter by Stephen King is in a lot of ways his most gripping work. But Misery is the better novel.    Finally if want to stretch just a bit try Dickens Tale of Two Cities. Don't be put off by the "language;" it is simply one of the most romantic wonderful books you will ever read. David Copperfield, Oliver Twist, and Great Expectations are all great. They're good for you but they are also great.|`|Pq8gQsl2aa	Try Bras and Broomsticks it was funny and kept me wanting to read more of the seires.|`|lmGx31vvaa	I'm in love with Ian McEwan books at the moment after reading 'Atonement.'    The best book I read in a longtime was 'The Thirteenth Tale' by Diane Setterfield.  That has many twists.  It's very gothic and has several mysteries running throughout.  I couldn't put it down.  It was one of those books you think about all day and cannot wait until you can pick it up and read it again.    My all time favorite book is 'Wuthering Heights.'
BZxkDecZaa	All books teach something. Even the most corny novel involves a moral system which is followed to teach the reader about how the author sees the way in which the world works.   As I do not personally know you I cannot give you motivation which is sure to engage you but there are some universal rules in writing that apply to all writers.    a. write about something that interests you, as Joseph Campbell said "follow your bliss".  b. write about something people will want to read about: an explanation as to why isn't needed.  c. take a new perspective on an old issue or explore a new issue.    Think about what catches your attention and select a topic that is important enough that you will be willing to spend the time to write about it, just so other readers will hopefully understand why you love it enough to write a book about it.     If you want to write a novel, you should visit www.writersdigest.com as it is an amazing writers resource (my personal fav actually!)    Maybe you would like to write an autobiography or advice book as well -if you like reading them you probably understand the style with which they are written. If you want to write an autobiography be ready to spend many, many -hopefully rewarding- hours in a library, online, etc.  If you want to write an advice book ensure that it is on a subject that you know a lot about. The average reader does not want to read an advice book on the opinion of the average person, they want the opinion of a very knowledgeable and informative person.    Other advice is that you have to make sure the way you write is engaging -showing not telling- or asking questions that lead the reader to reach the same conclusion which you have.     Every author spends countless hours brainstorming, do not be discouraged if things don't pop into your head right away, if all authors gave up after days of brainstorming, the vaults of English literature would probably be largely empty.     Here's a list of things I would want to read about right now:  how to write better; writing reference books  the histories on interesting musicians/'stars'  the journey of B. Obama to the white house!  history into important albeit less well known periods of history.  novels about characters that explore the absolutes of the human condition and human nature  fantasy novels  sci-fi novels.  ***however know that for whatever interests you there are probably millions of people who share your interest. All you really have to avoid is writing about extremely obscure things.    Hope this helps and best of luck!  Cheers!|`|LanQdB9Oaa	this may be a personal opinion, but i'm sure i'm not the only one thinking this. i'm not sure what kind of book you want to write, but if it's a novel with actual characters, then here's my advice.    PLEASE don't pull a stephenie meyer. not everyone is lucky enough to win the hearts of teenage girls by putting a little fantasy into their minds.    --make sure your characters have depth -- don't make them one dimensional deflated puppets. often what separates the better from the rest is characters and personalities e.g. gossip girl has imperfect, flawed, yet human characters, raising it wayy above the standards of shows like 90210. spare the happiness and drama and you'l have something worthy of reading.  --be original and creative - originality seems to be decreasing as we speak, so it's really valuable. something atypical is both a change from the normal realm and interesting too  --be funny and satiric -- send ups are always worth a good laugh  --don't write a love story - they are boring, typical. in fact, forget romantic relationships altogether. only a few good ones have ever been pulled off. e.g. shawshank redemption tell stories about the love between friends who meet in a prison, not romantic love. at the same time it carries harsh overtones. it gives the message that in a world such as theirs, with all that happens, there is still something to live for. but it's not so touchy-feely about it either  --real life is good, but make sure it's interesting. don't ramble too much about memories, but interweave your experiences and philosophies into the plot, while your character is developing.  --have some action, movement, pace -- these days, everything is fast-paced, and people are used to that. it gets boring after a while if everything moves so slowly.  --some books tend to be really really loud. loud as in, says everything on the authors mind. try to hold a bit back and let the reader figure it out, spare your dialogue, don't praise your characters directly. it makes for a bit of mystery and intrigue.    with that said, i wish you good luck.|`|d267fab7a0b268922f3228351f52baf1aa	You should start off asking yourself a few basic questions.  Such as what are you good at?  What advice have you offered that has helped others?  What subjects have you studied as well as have taken an active role in?    ---    If you have been a volunteer, cheer coach, dance squad captain, you can offer advice on leadership among peers, commitment, teamwork, and inspiration.    ---  If you have a younger sibling you can write about your role as an older sibling, how your role in the family has changed and become more significant and the importance of family.    ---   It is best to examine your own experiences and pen those as a start.

AA11442722	I've played guitar for almost as long as you've been alive but recently added drums to my list of instruments so it's never too old to add an instrument. Kinda fun actually though conceptially there are some differences.  In some ways it helps with your guitar playing. Drums is so timing oriented that you find your timing on guitar improving from sessions on the drums. It also gives you insight into both instruments seeing it from the other side of the kit.     So give it a try. I suggest an electric kit unless you have a nice soundproofed band room you can go to frequently. With an electric kits it's far easier to record, gives you a wide variety of kits and just throw on the headphones until you get good enough that running it through the PA isn't embarrasing. Plus you can practice at 3am with an electric kit.|`|1ibHGaAhaa	Of course, it will also help your guitar playing as you will see a different musical point of view. Good luck!|`|HpWujntlaa	Yes.

You could just as easily google this and get the answers, but some of this is going to take you actually using your brain to think and put the pieces together.|`|S0KbFkCPaa	I can answer number 1....    This famous "Red Scare" in America started when Americans feared the Soviets around 1952 and a few years onward. Part of the fear was the escalation of the nuclear war race between that country...and ours.  Russia did had Communists in that time...at that time, it was called the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics. Americans feared that Soviet emigres living in the United States could put the United States into a communist revolution....and that means the United States could be a "second USSR." Hence, anti-Communist Americans, with the help of senator Joseph McCarthy, launched a witch hunt on any American who had any spate of Communist ideals or socialist ideals related to Communism. Famous political and educational figures and some celebrities were snatched into the "blacklist trap"....they either lost their jobs or find out that they could not get any of them. The blacklistings continued for 4-5 years before McCarthy ended up disgraced for causing the anti-Communist attitudes.    McCarthyism is described as "fear and unwarranted accusations that lead to invasions of privacy...and seriously threaten such civil liberties as the freedom of speech."

The color of the wood will affect the look of the sculpture. Try to take that into account. Remember also that you can have a variety of quality within a single tree species. Whatever kind you decide on, make sure the actual piece you use is high quality.

0741081782691c4bf15f3f43c93552d6aa	Sudan: There is considerable evidence that slavery is still practiced in a large scale in Sudan -- an estimated 14,000 people have been abducted since 1983. However, the existence of slavery is denied by the Sudanese government. Some western religious groups have attempted to buy freedom for individual slaves. Unfortunately, this has become counterproductive. It increases the profitability of enslavement as a commercial enterprise, and results in more slaves being created. More details.      Niger: Anti-Slavery International reported in mid-2003 that slavery is rampant in Niger, mostly in the southwestern Tillaberry region of that country. 7 This occurs even though slavery is prohibited by the constitution and is being fought by stringent new laws. About 7% of the population -- some 870,000 individuals are condemned to life-long servitude. Many are born into slavery and will remain slaves all of their life.      Programs of near-slavery: Anti-Slavery International (ASI) presented a paper to the United Nations Working Group on Contemporary Forms of Slavery which met in Geneva, Switzerland, 2003-JUN-16 to 20. 8 All of the major offending countries cited have large Hindu or Muslim majorities. ASI discussed the situation in Sudan and Niger as well as describing situations of near-slavery such as: United Arab Emirates -- Child trafficking:  Although it is illegal to employ a child under the age of 15, hundreds of boys between four and ten are trafficked from South Asia to the UAE       India, Nepal and Pakistan -- Millions of men, women and children are used as forced and bonded labor in these countries. Most are dalit or from a low caste, or are from indigenous or minority groups. Laws against the caste system and against bonded labor exist but are not enforced.      Indonesia -- Forced labor and exploitation of migrant workers. "Poverty and lack of opportunity in Indonesia have increased the number of Indonesians seeking work in Asia. Indonesia's lack of protection and the Government's existing system for women migrant domestics exposes them to trafficking and slavery."|`|AA10187097	Myanmar and Sudan still have a sort of slavery,where workers are forced to work off debts but there is no way to account for that debt.  Their term of servitude turns out to be indefinite. Officially,like all other  countries,slavery is illegal there.    There is,of course,white slavery and human trafficking. That is illegal  but becoming a worse problem all the time in many countries throughout the world,including the United States.|`|YD7JDhmyaa	some people are bored of taming animals so they introduce humans in place of animals.|`|MFF61HvDaa	More people are enslaved today than in anytime in history.

That is nearly the most important part. If it has good meter, it reads and/or sings well, like shakespeare's stuff. here is one of my favorite examples of good meter.      That time of year thou mayst in me behold  When yellow leaves, or none, or few, do hang  Upon those boughs which shake against the cold,  Bare ruined choirs, where late the sweet birds sang.  In me thou see'st the twilight of such day  As after sunset fadeth in the west;  Which by and by black night doth take away,  Death's second self, that seals up all in rest.  In me thou see'st the glowing of such fire,  That on the ashes of his youth doth lie,  As the deathbed whereon it must expire,  Consumed with that which it was nourished by.  This thou perceiv'st, which makes thy love more strong,  To love that well which thou must leave ere long.      It looks like it took you a lot of work though. Keep writing, and good luck!
8CCttFS6aa	Try using words other than "anger" or "depression". Despondency maybe?  Also try dropping some commas and cleaning up your tenses.  The meter's off and varies through each stanza, cutting the flow. The vocabulary is a little dull, but the imagery is clear. Creativity is apparent throughout the poem, You certainly are in touch with your feelings, and express them in simple yet eloquent ways. Keep writing, with a little work you can blow minds.

By the time this inept lot came into power the economy was in excellent shape and we were doing better than most of our European partners. Then along came the Dark Destroyer. Gordon Brown took everything he could get his hands on and wasted billions and of course bullion's (gold that is). He gave the banks a free pass to go wild with credit. He was warned by many people at the beginning, that time would show his actions were untenable. However he is still in denial and we are all waiting for the next daft move.

BBfIXcI0aa	I'm reading a book right now called, interestingly enough, "How to Write Dialogue".    The author suggests keeping a notebook and trying a few different exercises:  - write down everything you say for a whole day, without context or punctuation  - go to places, like the mall, and write down the conversations you overhear  * The hardest part about writing dialogue is to make it sound real...without the boring parts. Don't say "um" or "uh" - even though it's real, it's irritating to read. Don't write out when someone has a speech impediment or dialect. ("Well, hel-lo, dahlin'!") Unless you're writing for six-year-olds, in which case you shouldn't be usind those characters, your reader can alter the voice in his or her head.  * Watch your dialogue tags. "Blah blah blah," Mary said, is all you ever really need. It's a big, flashing "amateur" sign when you try to switch "said" up with interjected, interrupted, exclaimed, questioned, etc. If the reader can't tell from the words, context, punctuation, etc. that the person is exclaiming or demanding or whatever, you aren't doing your job right.  * Consider trying action tags, in which case you don't tag the dialogue with "said" at all:  Jack ran his hand across the glass counter - it needed cleaning. "Well, I don't know what I'm supposed to do about it."   Jill shifted the bucket to her other hand. "Just come with me. Please? I don't like being alone on that hill at night?"    A few other little things to watch for:  - Using people's names too often in conversation.  - Overusing slang or cursewords - they get dated very quickly.  - Clumsy dialogue - read it out loud to make sure it sounds natural.  - Inappropriate speaking patterns. A fourteen-year-old in juvie isn't going to wax aloquent, and a well-known lawyer isn't going to say "Hey, Martha, where you at?!"    Hope I helped :)|`|8asG4WCwaa	http://www.sfwriter.com/ow08.htm    Here's a link to Robert Sawyer's tips on dialog.|`|GH75Cn5Xaa	Try Reading Mario Puzo's Books! My Favorite Author! R.I.P|`|vGid3WG1aa	You don't need to read a book about dialogue, you speak with people every day! You are an expert already lol!    All I can suggest is make it believable. You should never use abbreviations in your writing except dialogue. For example, the character is a teenager. He would say "I didn't do it!" as opposed to "I did not do it!" (the first sounds more natural, the second sounds unbelievable). Or compare "I don't know" to "I do not know." Which is the more likely out of those two for a teenage boy?? Give your characters age, class, ethnicity etc. They diaolgues will vary widely. Give each character a quirk.    Once you've written your dialogue, have you and a group of friends rehearse it like a play. Does it sound forced? Is every line necessary? Because you should never use dialogue as a space-filler. It should all add to the storyline in some way.    You can use many techniques. Like punctuation. Add an exclamation mark at the end of a sentence (!) and voila! Your character is shouting! Or if they are nervous m...m...make them s...st...stutter. You can have one characer interrupt another, which people do all the time in real life. It's a very common thing to happen, if you actually listen.    Good luck. Keep you ears open...|`|LddkW0JFaa	Dialog is crucial because that's your opportunity to demonstrate that the characters are all different people who choose to use different words and expressions. The best way to learn how to write good dialog is to read good novels (to give you good examples to mimic).|`|QMbaeva9aa	lemon cake's points are good.  Also, if you're writing a book, try not to add too much slang/ lingo or your writing will become dated very soon.
Lqq09mJDaa	You start at the beginning, with an idea.  What is your book about?  From there, create the characters that are going to be in your book.  The important thing to remember about characters is their personality.  Are they smart, stupid, funny, classy, sassy, confident, have a wild streak, insecure?  Develop the personality in your mind, envision the character walking and talking.  Then thrown them into the plot and see what they do.  Just sit back, watch it happen, and put what you see in your mind down on paper.  Best of Luck|`|ZyJKy9Q5aa	I love to write novels so this is what I do:  1st: I write the characters' names then I write down facts about them on a piece of paper (ex. Their age and stuff like that and the way they think)  2nd: Write down the things that will happen like (ex. How the characters met and how were their lives and what happened in their child hood...) -and write down the plot!-  3rd: I write the first draft and double check the spelling and grammar mistakes and the verb agreement.    hope I helped.  :D|`|6tE79dziaa	Ah, been there. what the heck am I saying I still am!  seriously though.  When you say you want to write, do you mean a story? fiction, non?  there are so many possibilities.  If you are already good at typing and you are decently proficient with grammar then the next step is to figure out what it is you want to say.  Write about something that you are passionate of knowledgeable about.  But do you self a favor and have an Idea, even a vague one of what you want to say.  Fortunately there are a huge amount of resources available.  Just Google the word 'writing'  But in the end? Pick up a laptop and start typing away, lol.  One final suggestion? start small. A book is a huge undertaking.  Don't let that discourage you! But if you plan and execute a short project it gives you perspective for a lager task.  Good luck and hope i helped.|`|uTnJ4o2Saa	Personally, I've found Marcia Golub's book, "I'd Rather Be Writing"  beyond motivational.    She's engaging, knows her stuff, doesn't talk "down" to the reader,  and conversationally inspires with a whole array of angles of thought.|`|ve4K3rb1aa	my advice would be think about the sort of book you want to write.  come up with characters and the basic plot.  once you know where you are going with it then you can start writing.    it's up to you how much planning you do,  but i would recomend daoing some,  espceially if you have never written a book before,  it keeps you on track.    other than that,  have fun|`|Uk9dMYg7aa	brainstorm. you can keep a small notebook wiht you to jot down any good ideas that come to you. otherwise sitting down at a laptop and writing things that come to your head is a good way to go- remember you can always go back and change it!|`|VHn30aWJaa	for sure!! you could be a great writer if you want to!! just start and create file of a new story and keep going, good luck!! uzi nanaj|`|X4A6KlUbaa	Hi. I finished my first novel last march. Invaluable resources are available at your local bookstore.   My personal favorite books are "Fiction Writer's Workshop" and "Writing Fiction Step by Step" both by Josip Novakovich. The books are amazing. He has over 200 exercises in one book alone. The exercises are focussed on helping you come up with a concept, characters, and a plot. He explains the key parts of fiction and uses examples from great authors.     Other than that, WRITE WRITE WRITE. Start light, try writing for 15 minutes a day and  then work up to an hour a day. Writing is always fun at first, but especially for a novel, it becomes real work and dedication. So, keep that minimum one hour a day writing time.
BjBkO0CSaa	First off, your question throws readers off - Hitler has very little to do with scientific advancements during the World War II era.     Second off, I'm going to have to disagree with you.  While I see the point you're trying to make, the Nazis had little to do with the lasting advancements made during the time.  While a German did invent the first "computer," he had no affiliation to the Nazis.  While the Nazis were working on their own nuclear bomb, the Americans were the first to "harness nuclear power" and use it in a bomb (the use of which can be disputed).  Women became a vital part of the workforce in America (hence, Rosie the Riveter).  Israel became a nation with the backing of America and England, and major advances in aeronautics and rockets came post-World War II (the Star Wars were between the USSR and US).      Yes, the Nazis did conduct their own medical experiments - which were torturous and horrible in its own right, but there was nothing of scientific merit that was established.      The world's leading scientists and thinkers did not affiliate themselves with the Nazi doctrine or government.  While Germany may have made accomplishments, I have faith that the world would have made it to where we are today without Hitler and Nazi science.      So I suppose we agree to disagree?|`|3buQDaRDaa	They didn't make that many differences in medicine. In aircraft and other areas of technology they made some amazing progress.|`|qDSvOOwBaa	I would suggest you don't use quotes from sources that are not allowed because they are editable-Wikipedia is NOT a source!    "The world's leading scientists and thinkers did not affiliate themselves with the Nazi doctrine or government. While Germany may have made accomplishments, I have faith that the world would have made it to where we are today without Hitler and Nazi science"    Totally uninformed    Vanbruan was a Nazi and a party member since 1933. It is well known that as part of his negotiated surrender to the Americans that along with his team of 500 that his Nazi membership would remain with the group. Upon entering he was given the Nazi salute to the chagrin of everyone else at his rocket facility at MSFC.  He was made an SS captain by Himmler and hand picked his forced labors for the Peenemnde factory, Without Vanbruan and his team the Saturn rocket would have never been developed and  we would have never gone to the moon-it is doubtful if would have gotten there even now without him.  So, without the Fuhrer,like it or not Neil Armstrong would not have landed on the moon-this simply can't be debated anymore.    s_e_s
ZSesESvOaa	I liked House of Night a lot at least most of the books.     Out of the seven I have read the Southern Vampire Series (sookie books) I had a problem with one being more of a tie it all together kind of book. Other than that be prepared for a lot of sex but great story lines.    Vampire Kisses is cute and fun but not at all in depth there is no violence and the storyline can get kind of silly great for young teens.    I have only read one Blue Bloods book and I have the other two waiting after I get a few more books done. I liked it quite a bit but it is not on my list of favorites.    I barely got through Glass Houses the first in the Morganville Vampire Series I found it very boring for about the first three quarters of the book.    I hope this helps I have reviews of some of the books here http://darknovels.today.com/ but many of them I have not read.

You are not a true vampire fanatic if you haven't read them.  Ignore all the Twilight suggestions as the Vampire Chronicles outshines them all.  It's seductive, imaginative and erotic with fantastic characters.  There are 10 in the series but once you read the first one -Interview with the Vampire- you won't be able to put them down.  No decent vampire lover will accept you if you haven't read them.

People have different thoughts on life.  :)|`|URO3gDXcaa	no one really knows for sure.|`|rsFWSelnaa	if you get really lucky you get my body next time|`|AA12079397	Between creatures (including human beings) and God there are millions of invisible elements. There are divisions too. Human being is a combination of several spirits. We are just robots in flesh created by scientist God. Each of us have memories like that of the computers'. The fed things (data= knowledge=several spirits or invisible elements) are in contact with the memories since childhood. If current (electricity) stopped the memory loses all data. This is with computer. The same thing occurs to all of us. Computers are functioning by electric power but human beings are functioning by natural power. We call this as soul. This soul is nothing but simply a power like electricity. If this is stopped our memories lose all data (all spirits or invisible elements). These spirits scatter and go to different places. No one lives in the form of spirit or anything after death. Reincarnation is a rare phenomena which is not possible to all. If it occurs anywhere it must be either an error or a purpose (least possibility).|`|7zHrBkY2aa	well...idk but that might and might not heppen...|`|TSDQtFpSaa	When death comes you have two choices: heaven or hell.

A lot of women have tender breasts right before their period, a lot of them have actual pain. Its just PMS.There is also a disease called fibrocystic breastdisease, its basically the same pain as PMS and also occurs right before menstruation.  If you're not around that time of the month, you should go and get checked out since there are different causes for sore breast, in the worst case breast cancer ( although lumps occur way before the pain)  And maybe at last, you might still be pregnant. There are many false negatives. A blood test will give you assurance. So, if you're not going to get your period anytime soon, my advice is to go to a doc. Hope this helps!
8dlxCanCaa	You most likely would not be put in a class with much younger students. Maybe find a studio that has a teen beginner class or if you get put in a regular class then most likely the girls will only be one or two years younger than you. Ballet will definatly benifit your musical thetre class because ballet is the base of every type of dance. At my studio, each class is $45 a month so if you plan on taking one class it should probably be around that unless you go to like a professional school. Regular ballet slippers (not pointe shoes) can be relativly cheap. I ordered mine from www.discountdance.com  and they were only like $12. You will probably also need a leotard and tights and you can look for those on that website too. Thats awesome that you saved up all of that money and i'm sure you'll have enough. Just start doing some basic stretches now to prepare you for when you start classes so your muscles don't go into a "shock" lol.

hl4kkvXhaa	I really like Sunset, the Winged Wolf...it reminds me a lot of the older art that doesn't have a lot of professional strokes and perfectionism (please don't take offense, as I've actually known people who spend a lot of time and money learning to draw like this).      Your wolf (I forgot the name...the first picture) is also really good.  The colors caught my eye...and then I think the eyes sort of pull you in.    Another of my favorites is the purple wolf with blue eyes (final picture).  I like the electrical feel it emits...the shock of color.    If you've only been drawing for three weeks now, I'd have to say that I'm impressed!  No need to feel self conscious about your work...just don't get arrogant and believe that you don't need improvements because nobody is perfect, and there's always room for improvement.  My advice is to continue to motivate yourself.  Keep working at it.    And, if you get a negative reaction on here, don't let it get to you.  A lot of people who come here are simply doing so to find people to hurt or agitate.  Generally, the highly rude answers are from bitter people, so I never take much stock in what those people have to say (jealousy can make people mean and nasty).  The only answers I'd pay much attention to are the ones that may seem negative, but give you constructive criticism (ways to improve).    Anyway, I like them...but you do need to continue practicing to improve.  If you love it, don't give up just because someone tries to make you feel like you're no good at it because those are the types of people who usually gave up on their own dreams.  I wish you luck!  :)|`|Rp7VvIOdaa	I like "Drawing of Sarah" best, but that's only my humble opinion.|`|Q9tZu5Xraa	these are amazing!!!  i like the drawing of sarah, moonlit thoughts, sunset, the winged wolf, and flamme, the willful wolf, the best, though.    you've got some talent there!|`|EJ1KWAPbaa	Your very good!

Layout artists usually start off in school as a general Graphic Designer. If you want to be taken seriously, and not just a desktop publisher, you should look into a 3 to 4 year Graphic Design program.    A junior layout artist can be paid around $15/hr to start in an in house design studio or newspaper company. If you are looking into freelance work, you would be setting the base amount per project, or per hour.    If you like working with Adobe products, specifically Adobe InDesign, layout work is great. In the end, you should understand design principles and fundamentals. Print objectives such as color, size and paper.

c06f9e62b2e3de70492245a069ccbf6aaa	UK answer.  I found this for you.  Surname: Lawless  Recorded in various forms including Lwless, Lawles, Laweles and possibly others, this is an English medieval surname. It is said to be a nickname for a licentious man, from the Early English word "laweles" meaning uncontrolled by the law, unbridled or licentious. Whilst this may be true, it is more likely that being a nickname it actually meant the very opposite of what it appears to describe, and that probably it was given as a mocking name for somebody who was law abiding! Very few if any nickname surnames have survived which cast aspersions on the nameholder, and as this name is quite popular it seems unlikely that the nameholders of seven centuries ago saw themselves as lawless. This is also born out by the early recordings, the first being for a member of Parliament, see below, whilst Thomas Laghelas was a Freemen of the city of York in 1360, whilst Richard Lawles appears in the charters known as the Testamenta Cantiana, for the county of Kent in 1535. Church register recordings include examples such as Margery Lawles, christened at St. Mary at Hill, city of London on November 19th 1551, and William Lawless in the parish of St. Michael's Barbados in 1678. Valentine Browne Lawless (1773 - 1853) was the second Baron Cloncurry. He received a B.A. at Trinity College Dublin in 1792. The first recorded spelling of the family name may be that of Huge Laghlese. This was dated 1314, in the "Writs of Parliament", during the reign of King Edward 11nd, 1307 - 1327. Surnames became necessary when governments introduced personal taxation. In England this was sometimes known as Poll Tax. Throughout the centuries, surnames in every country have continued to "develop" often leading to astonishing variants of the original spelling.   Hope this helps.|`|0HAn67yZaa	lawless Name Meaning and History  Scottish, Irish, and English: nickname for an unbridled and licentious man, from Middle English laghless, lawelas (a compound of late Old English lagu law (from Old Norse) + the native suffix -l(e)as without, lacking). Reaney suggests additionally that this name may have referred to an outlaw (i.e. one from whom the protection of the law had been withdrawn), but this seems unlikely.|`|KHNBcsdkaa	It's English. Irish last names would generally have been in Gaelic. If it sounds very much like a common English word, it probably is English.

AA10015648	I'm nervous - the media is scaring people into not spending their money, which is not helping the economic crisis... the government is giving money to in-trouble companies without ANY rules as to how the company needs to spend it, so the money is essentially going to waste.

Z0v6G0Kgaa	Cheesy and very inaccurate:    1.  It depicts the fight by Buford's cavalry completely wrong.  It has them firing muskets, in close formation behind a stone wall.  Buford's men had carbines, were fighting to a great extent in woods and brush, only a few fences and open fields.  1 man would hold the horses, the other 3 would go to the frontline and fight.    2.  Doesn't do a good job depicting the fight for Little Round Top.  It makes it look like the 20th Maine was the only fight there was.  Arguably Col. Strong Vincent was an even bigger hero and had a more desperate fight to Chamberlain's right.    3.  Totally ignores the battle for Culp's Hill.    4.  Depicts Pickett's charge as some gallant, high-water mark when Longstreet had it right all along--it was doomed from the start.  It never gives you a good feel for the tactics of the charge (the oblique left by Pickett's Division, the long distance that Trimble and Pettigrew had to go, ignores that a Mississippi regiment from Trimble's Division and a NC regiment from Pettigrew's division made it further than anyone from Pickett's Division, made the thinks look closer than they were--in actuality, about 150 Confederates cracked the first line at Cushing's battery only to run into the second Union line and reserves (with dismounted cavalry behind them).  The one thing people usually forget that the movie does get right is that about 100 feet from the Union lines the Confederates had to climb/dis-assemble a fence which was a terrible barrier for those troops).    Theme?  The movie's theme is probably doomed but gallant effort.  But I'd argue that the theme of the book (Killer Angels) of brothers fighting each other is probably better.    Least favorite?  Probably Lee.  He was at his worst this battle.  Ill, not feeling well, his decisions and delegation proved to be poor.  And don't forget, Davis wanted to send Longstreet to help relieve Vicksburg.  Lee didn't want that so developed the pretext of invading Pennsylvania (where he'd need Longstreet).  So Lee's strategy was a double-whammy for the Confederacy:  Vicksburg fell without the support (and they lost the war) and after Gettysburg, the South was incapable of serious offensive warfare in the East (which meant they could only defend and hope the North got tired).  Lee was a good man, honorable and a fine general but these 4-5 days were him at his worst militarily.  Favorite:  Chamberlain.|`|qDSvOOwBaa	I'm not much for movies but it is my understanding it is accurate. The much maligned Newt Gingridge wrote a fiction book "Gettysburg A novel of the Civil War.

The 20th Maine piece clearly shows a unit dominating another and breaking them.|`|VBdXray0aa	This is a very good depiction of the novel 'The Killer Angels".  I can't say I have a least favorite character, but the portrayal of Gen. Longstreet has come a long way to gain sympathy for him.  He has always been the scapegoat for Gettyburg and was attacked in the papers by a few obnoxious and unrelenting generals.    Naturally, I have the video in my C.W. collection, along with 'Gods and Generals ".  I will be waiting for the third in the series, 'The Last Full Measure.'    The movie is great, but like most others, the book is definitely better.    Edit:  After seeing a few answers to this, we must not forget that this is a fictional novel made into a movie.  Culp's Hill, and the rest of the battleground could not be shown as the movie would have to take 3 days.  Yes, there were bigger heros than Chamberlain, who some say patted his own back in his memoirs, but the story is not about them.  As a Wisconsinite, I would have liked to have seen another minute or two of the famous Iron Brigade depicted, but as I said, all cannot be in a movie.

AA12181796	No, you apparently haven't.    - Alice's power has been explicitly stated to be based on the choices of people. Why, then, does she predict the weather?    - Edward has no blood, and could not possibly have living sperm. The entire "Renesmee" plot makes no sense from beginning to end. There's also no reason she should have developed so fast and then conveniently stopped when she was eighteen.    - Why is Bella the sole exception to the vampires' otherwise infallible mental gifts? Other than that she's a Mary Sue?    - Bella's phobia of blood magically disappearing.    - All the vampires go insane when she gets a papercut, but tolerate her just fine when she's on her period, or drinking blood like a Slurpee, or whatever.    - According to Meyer, it is perfectly possible to perform a C-section with your teeth. According to all logic and reason, it most certainly is not.    - Before Bella is transformed she thinks she'll never be able to see her parents again, as she couldn't be around them without attacking them. So their plan is... to pretend she's *died*?? How would this keep her parents away? Bella actually wonders whether she'll be able to lie still in a coffin while they grieve over her - no, because they'd still have THE SAME ISSUE.    - On that note, there is no reason why Bella should miraculously skip the rabid new born stage, so why does she?    - Ditto her "graceful even for a vampire" thing? Meyer said human traits were amplified upon transformation, so since Bella's clumsiness was about her ONLY trait, she should just spend eternity sprawled on the ground.    - How are the vampires so clever when they're supposed to be frozen in the mentality they had when they were transformed?    - If Edward knows Jacob is a shapeshifter, not a werewolf, because he's out in the day, he knows that in Eclipse when he's forbidding Bella to go near Jacob because werewolves are so dangerous. This is either a plot hole or proof of what a controlling, jealous lowlife Edward is.    I've barely scratched the surface. Read them again; you can pretty much go through and pick apart her entire story.|`|vFF5vwqsaa	Vampires are mythological or folkloric revenants who subsist by feeding on the blood of the living. In folkloric tales, the undead vampires often visited loved ones and caused mischief or deaths in the neighbourhoods they inhabited when they were alive. They wore shrouds and were often described as bloated and of ruddy or dark countenance, markedly different from today's gaunt, pale vampire which dates from the early Nineteenth Century.    I think the whole definition of vampire creates a plot hole in Twilight.

hl4kkvXhaa	It could, if you aren't holding your pencil correctly.  Holding it too loosely will cause the both your letters and you drawings to look sloppy because the pencil won't stay steady, meaning it will break away and you have to go back and try to catch the end of the spot you were on...giving you breaks in flowing lines.  Holding it too tight will give you unevenness in shading, and you will subconsciously add too much pressure to the paper (tense hands will trick your brain into thinking you're anxious or tense, making you press harder).    It's not always necessarily the case, but I think that has a lot to do with the way you write/draw.  I have a friend who grips his pencil much like a child learning to write (between the middle and ring fingers), and a friend who actually places the pencil in his palm...neither are good at writing or drawing.    But, whether this is the case in your case or not, I can't say for sure.  What I can say is that you should work to improve your writing skills, even if it doesn't improve your drawing skills.  A lot of people think that hand writing skills aren't important in today's world because so much is done with computers these days, but that's not true.  If you are in a situation where you work in a company, and have to make hand written notes for one reason or another, you don't want it to look as if it was written by a child or you won't be taken seriously.  In my job, (which is just an operator in a factory) we have to fill out productivity sheets for both our supervisor and for the next shift's operators.  If it isn't "clean" enough to be read clearly, our supervisor may put the data into her computer wrong, which can not only hurt our pay but also mess up the inventory count for the orders we fill.  If the next shift operators misread, they can mess up inventory by making too many (or not enough) parts to finish an order.  So, as you can see, hand writing is an important skill, even in what some consider to be the "lower end" of the business spectrum.    My advice is to work on your hand writing skills...even if it means taking lessons or buying some of the hand writing workbooks that they sell in stores for kids.  Yes, it might be embarrassing, but it would be more embarrassing to find out later in life that your poor writing skills are hindering your career.|`|wLwNIxPpaa	proper pencil grip might affect both    http://www.drawyourworld.com/grip.html|`|6jN3g0x8aa	In my opinion, they are two different things.

Another thought  could it be to do with your poise when drawing, adjusting to a new lightbox sometimes means that you are hunched over.

The four basic questions you need to ask are these:  1. What does this character want?  2. Why?  3. How does this character plan to get it?  4. What is standing in this character's way?    This is pretty much all you need to know about each of your important characters. Truly minor characters don't need this much depth.     For example, Harry Potter  1. A family and vengence against the one who killed his parents  2. His parents were murdered, and because of this he was raised by cruel relatives  3. By turning his friends into his family, and later by getting married and starting a family of his own. By studying hard so that he can become a great wizard, and by embracing his destiny.  4. His many enemies and others who get in his way|`|8YumJzcOaa	Remember your imagination is your first and best tool for characterization as you begin making notes for your story.  You will be surprised just how well you can envision (and remember details about) your characters once you begin the process of writing.  Just a few simple notes on each character can help trigger all those details you have swirling in your imagination and memory banks.  I would begin by asking three simple questions: Name? Physical Description? Role In My Story/Relationship to other Characters?    Once you have these basics down, you'll find it easier to concentrate on the story you want to write and not on trying to recall every detail of every character you happen to imagine.    Good luck.

vVd8yFdIaa	Depth of field (also called depth of focus) refers to how "deep" the in-focus area of the image is.  For example, if you aim the camera at your cat six feet away from you, you might find when you look at the image that the cat itself PLUS an area a foot in front and behind it are in focus  (moderate depth of field).  On a close-up of a flower, your depth of field may be only a fraction of an inch (narrow depth of field).    If you were to take a landscape photo on a sunny day, you might find that your image is sharply focused from a few feet in front of you clear out to infinity--a very wide depth of field.    How wide your depth of field is depends on the aperture size (f number) you're using, but that's another topic.  Hope this helps.|`|lh6e1OiZaa	Depth of field refers to how much of the shot is in sharp focus    Shallow depth of field is when you have a specific object or a certain portion of the frame in sharp focus while the rest of the frame appears blurred - typical of foreground/background shots.    Wide depth of field is when you have most or all of the frame in sharp focus.    You control depth of field with your f-stop and the distance to what is being shot.|`|yWloDrF8aa	r_rohan's answer is simple, accurate and correct.   Please note that depth of field is not the same as depth of focus which appears to have been Americanised to mean the same.  The original and correct definition of depth of focus is the measurement of a distance behind the lens wherein the film or sensor plane will remain sharply in focus. It can be thought of as the flip side of depth of field, occurring in the camera side of the lens as opposed to the lens to subject side.|`|egeuNalTaa	Hi Audreyan, the smaller the aperture combined with the slowest shutter speed you can manage in available light will yield the greatest "depth of field"  ( greater range of focus within your field of view ).  Consequently,  the slower the ISO of your film, the greater the options of camera settings in order to maximize the focus range.  Have a warm and wonderful day, jb :)|`|6584a2c112e4342d61a5a55cbb9aafd0aa	I think the problem is the use of terms that describe different dimensions. In reality the depth of field should be referred to as being "deep" or "shallow". Wide is not an accurate term to describe depth of field because it implies width as opposed to depth.

m8NUDdiEaa	Any frame where you want to make a change to your object needs to be a keyframe.     1. draw your object  2. convert it to a symbol   3. insert some frames  4. add keyframes at the intervals where you want to move/change it  5. select all of the frames and use motion tweening to animate    This is very roughly what you could try, but best bet is to look at a tutorial|`|WI8wRpYCaa	when you right click on another frame besides frame one, you want to insert a keyframe. especially if your frame count between the two is high (above 20) it is easy to animate things using a motion tween. all you need to do is change the picture in the other keyframe, right click the frame before your final keyframe and select insert motion tween. There are tutorials which are easy to find on google to do this sort of thing.

7CHt3IE1aa	I totally sympathise with you- my current project has gone through three similar breakdowns, and I've now written more that 200,000 words on it. I think this is normal, and as long as you keep working and don't quit, you will eventually break through the block.    I don't really recommend editing current work, but you should be sure that the work is moving in the direction you want to- my last novel hit a wall at 20,000 words, but I pressed on. When I reached 50,000 words, I realised I had taken a major wrong turn and had to go all the way back to where it started getting difficult.    Don't expect to use every single scene you write- I have a book coming out in April. It's 113,000 words, but the first draught plus wrong-turns ran to nearly 190,000 words. Some of the stuff that I pulled out was because it was either wrong or not good enough, but a lot of the stuff that got edited out was perfectly competent writing but just not necessarily relevant.    Keep working. It's totally worth it.    Good luck.|`|Qo7hrm73aa	i had this idea for a book like i'm sad to say 10 years ago, but i never got around the details but the whole plot was there, anyway, it was not  on my high priority list, so, i just let the years roll by i never force myself because i felt there was something missing in it. and just this year, it just hit me, the missing piece came out of nowhere. and i'm working on it right now. so, please do not force yourself. relax a bit and let nature be your inspiration.  and i'm sure the next thing you know your heart is gonna be in it. if that time comes and you need to rewrite, it is really okay, just follow your heart.     i believe that readers can only fall in love with your story if you yourself is in love with it.|`|1qUokeKOaa	the same thing happened to me i tweeked my story a lil bit i went back and added more detail to things and added a few more characters then wen i came to the part that i was stuck on the words came alot faster|`|vFF5vwqsaa	Keep writing and don't stop.  Don't even look back unless you have to or else you will get discouraged.    When you are finished, then you edit.  Until that point, keep writing.|`|WshwHtk9aa	Put the written material away - put printed versions in a drawer, electronic ones in a separate file - and stop looking at it. You will begin to question yourself. You did it, you liked it, don't second guess it, just move forward. You can review it in the context of the entire book when you finish the rest of it. Going back and editing is nothing but a) an excuse not to have to go forward, and b) a form of self-sabotage.     I'd wager that you are fighting less with your story than with your own feelings of self-doubt. All I can tell you is to take a day or two away from it entirely, then sit down, clear your mind and environment, don't look back, and just force through it. you can always come back and edit it, but only if you keep going.     Don't give up!|`|nE9BaUWIaa	Punch the keys. The review comes later.

If you died right now you'd have some regrets i.e.-I should of so gone with my little brother and mum to Cott and had some free ice cream. You said there's so much for you to do still. What are you waiting for? It's time to start taking care of business and cleaning up your life. So if you die today you're not worried about what will happen after you die because you have that all straightened out with God. Having fun is important and who doesn't love it? It's almost like your friends had everything they needed taken care of-teddy bears-but you were unprepared. Get ready. The Bible says to be ready in and out of season. 2 Tim 4:2    Hope this helps :)

d2yShBEcaa	Since you are so unsure how to start a paper about your future.  Maybe you've already answered your question. Honesty works well in a paper instead of BS'ing your way through it.      Use any factors in your life or large events in your past that might construct your future, even if you don't know exactly what your goal might be.   Something like this:    It's January 2009, I might have another 60 years left on earth, or not.  With such a minute time left on this planet, one would think my future goals are solid, set in stone, perfectly laid out even, but they're not.  The very idea of writing a paper on my future left me to ponder...    something like this maybe????    good luck|`|kqnaqakLaa	a thesis or flat out intro?    1.) more school?  2.) after school?  3.) family?  4.) retirement?  5.) afterlife?|`|2AdJStDYaa	Start with maybe a child aspiration.

It may allow 1000 artists and/or musicians in each one of those states to be paid for projects or a performances that they otherwise would have been asked to do for free.  This happens all the time to people in the arts.  For whatever reason communities and groups feel that "talent" is something God given - therefore should be given back.  They forget that artists and musicians have to eat, too.  They have to pay a mortgage, too.  And being self-employed, they are not eligible for unemployment insurance if a gig falls through.  They also pay their own health insurance.  If the NEA is able to fund me for several events that I otherwise would not be paid for, I take that money and spend it right back into my community.  Many events will suffer this year because the businesses don't have the money to donate for sponsorship.  Am I a slacker?  No.  I work very hard at my craft (musician) and have done so for many years.  And yes - I DO pay taxes on all my earnings.

But, still, yes.|`|0N0Zmo0taa	yes of course I dont judge people with no magic blood lol|`|ZNvterQyaa	i like tonkes answer yeah i think i would well i would hang with my muggle friends and if i was a mudblood i would hang with my family why not???
ZNvterQyaa	i would rob a bank or steal stuff of some rich cool people and if Jkr was in australia i would steal her pretty bounded harry potter books and whatever other things she has and so me of  the tale of beetle the bard books the ones bounded in leather with jewels and stuff and i would steal a box set of the whole mcleods series which finished last night and it was really stupid and probally get a few wiis and psp's and games and stuff for my family and friends and loads of jewelry as well..... and whatever else i could think of and i would try to like clone the cloak and in i would also scare people who got in my way just to name a few lol|`|810513944bc1fc28c514a617993b162faa	Go on the rob.  I'm a criminal at heart.|`|tZF1FO7saa	probably the bank or go around and scare people|`|uKCu2sosaa	honestly, i'd go to a bank and take as much as i can.|`|BTkHkkJTaa	i would pretend i was a ghost and scare people.  ah, would that be a great day or what....|`|iEsICA3Maa	Go to JK Rowling's house and get all her valuables, at least the ones related to Harry Potter.|`|uSouun2saa	The way the economy's going now, it really wouldn't be worth it to go to a bank...so, I'd go around scaring people and go to JK Rowling's house and look for new manuscripts. What fun! Or just go to Bill Gate's place and steal all his stuff.|`|Gxn7ltAUaa	rob a bank|`|0N0Zmo0taa	spy on severus snape when he's taking a bath|`|5aLWqRL0aa	Get all of the money i can and annoy and scare people who i don't like
ZNvterQyaa	hopefully really good grades becaue i would love to go there it would make school more interesting and you would actually get something out of it that you actully know straight away.|`|tZF1FO7saa	okay grades|`|uSouun2saa	I'd be a right hermione- all O's then one E. I'd be *devastated*   Yea, I'm very much like her that way.|`|uKCu2sosaa	i would get really good grades. kind of like Hermione.|`|phH2dVYZaa	HOPEFULLY a little above average grades.    I think I'd be better at Defence Against the Dark Arts cause I'm very paranoid and I'd like to know self defence in magic since I'm not good at physical self defence!|`|BTkHkkJTaa	probably okay grades.|`|iEsICA3Maa	I would get OK grade, like I do in school (muggle school)|`|b1cVZbX7aa	I expect to get an Exceeds Expectation. I'm almost good in studies in my muggle school. So, I think I can do well in Hogwarts too. But some subjects in hogwarts feel like really stupid. And I totally oppose the learning styles of Hermione.|`|J3eNQmAJaa	I am a muggle. So I'll have problems at first, but then I'll do good at OWLS.|`|1cAz9coEaa	If I went to Hogwarts I probably would get okay grades.|`|5aLWqRL0aa	okay kinda grades becuz i would be like fred and george, mucking about all of the while with sweets
AA10128644	No,  I would hang around with Hermione.|`|tZF1FO7saa	Yes I would love to read it, wouldn't it be cool if J.K. made a book about it like Beedle th Bard or Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them|`|uSouun2saa	Definitely. Cover to cover, every word there is.|`|uKCu2sosaa	no i wouldn't unless it was recommended or something similar to that.|`|phH2dVYZaa	Yes!|`|iEsICA3Maa	Probably not, I'd just get everything from Herimone.|`|ac89nvFgaa	I would read it cover to cover many times.|`|5aLWqRL0aa	No i'd just ask hermione|`|ZNvterQyaa	probally i would be really interesting|`|VlzPRzQaaa	Oh yes.  I love history, and I would be amazed by Hogwarts.  I would love to get to know the place better.

v70p2kgWaa	It's not quite as straight forward as adding a picture on here.  First off it has to be online.    Towards the top middle should be "profile" click on it.  Then find the white text that says "Modify profile"    Towards the middle of the options put in the url for an avatar  An example say you wanted to use a picture of the cover of interview with a vampire  you would put the url (in this case a url that works would be http://www.sfandf.com/images/3000/2822_v...  then size wise I would probably go with something like 60 for width and  86 for heigth.    After that you scroll down to the bottom and click "modify profile"    Hope that makes sense|`|810513944bc1fc28c514a617993b162faa	You mean an avatar, or sig?

05bddf168eeb3e8ae67ab005844309abaa	If you are using a genealogy program, like PAF (free) or Family Tree Maker ($39 and up) or Roots Magic ($29) you can just add the lady in question and the child, without a marriage fact. If you are doing family group sheets with a pencil, you will have two, one for your brother and his wife and their children, one for your brother, the woman and their child.    I'd reccomend PAF. It (and all other genealogy programs) are to genealogy what "Word" is to writing a novel; they beat paper and pencil handsd down.    Go to  http://www.familysearch.org/eng/default....  for the download.

AA10015648	I Dreamed a Dream is definitely an Alto song, not a soprano song... It's perfect for showing you can sing down to a low G, but not great for a mezzo soprano.    Part of Your World is good for belters, to show off that they can reach an E clearly without transitioning into their head voice, and that they can keep a feminine, innocent voice through a belt.    White Knight is definitely the best of the three.     Good luck!|`|6yZ7uABzaa	I know how you mean, with your range :)  You may remember the following list of songs i recommended to you.   "now that i've seen her" is VERY challenging, but if you'd rather have a good acting song, "I'd give my life for you" (Miss Saigon) is absolutely beautiful!  As for other songs....   "Memory" is great, but is slightly overdone  "Diva's Lament" (spamalot) is very funny, but you'll have to change some of the language!  "Nothing" (A Chorus Line) is my fave song!  "Climbing Uphill" (Last 5 Years) is also very funny, but you'll have to change some language.... hehe  "No-one but you" (WWRY) is lovely, but might be overdone  "Green Finch and Linnet Bird" is very tricky, but if you work at it, it'll be fab :)  "Somewhere" (WWS) is lovely, but doesn't show much range  "Fine, Fine Line" (Avenue Q) is really meaningful, but kinda quirky ^_^  The solo songs from witches of eastwick are brilliant, and will really showcase your acting and singing  "My New Philosophy" (YAGMCB) is a great song for any young girl to have in her rep  "Miss Byrd" (Closer than Ever) is really rangey, and tricky to act, but i wouldn't advise it to anyone age 13 or under ;)    There is also Glitter and be Gay from Candide which is very tricky! YOu might want to look into "poor wandering One" (Pirates of Penzance) but i worked on it with my singing teacher and it's ssooooooo hard!    EDIT: you could look into Lion Tamer from Scwarzt's show The Magic Show. Cheno sings it on the Schwartz compilation album. It's lovely!
lmGx31vvaa	Just because it has magic in it, doesn't make it similar to Harry Potter.    It sounds really good, very detailed and dark.  Continue writing it and put all JK Rowling thoughts out of your head. It's YOUR story and YOUR writing.|`|YlRMabZ4aa	It sounds good. As for similarities to Harry Potter, it is only really the magic and orphanage/school that make it appear that way, and both of which seem to be done differently then Harry Potter.|`|ac89nvFgaa	Not like Harry Potter to me. But if you don't like it start fresh. But keep a copy and come back to it later.|`|BLMh0dG6aa	If your asking the question it probably mean you think your borrowing, that's good for exorcise, most new authors usually start with imitation; but if your asking its better to throw the whole thing out, but save a copy for latter reference, and stat anew in an entirely new vain.

0741081782691c4bf15f3f43c93552d6aa	The steel string acoustic guitar was invented by Guitar maker Christian Fredrich Martin. Martin moved from Germany to America in 1833 and worked as a guitar maker, or luthier. American guitarists wanted a louder and brighter sounding guitar, to play in bands with banjos and other instruments that produced a louder and brasher sound.
agTCqkLDaa	Ryan Gosling:    1. I always remember that he was in certain movies, but I never see him as anyone character.  He is so fluid    2. He is so talented that I feel like even as an unseasoned actress, he could make my performance as though I'm a veteran of the field.    3. He has a certain manly charm about him.    4. He did an entire movie opposite a doll and made me forget that the doll as not speaking.  He is so dedicated to his roles.  So much so that he got fired from a movie for being dedicated because the director is a prick.    5. It helps that he looks like your typical guy, there's nothing outstanding about his physical appearance yet I'd jump him before any actor in Hollyood.    *Yes, I know they dated...regardless*    Rachel McAdams    1. She is down to earth and very cautious.    2. She too is very fluid-it took me forever to figure out that the girl in The Notebook as the same girl who played Regina in Mean Girls.      3. She bought an old house in her hometown instead of living in Hollywood.  This proves to me that you don't aboslutely HAVE to live in LA.  This is comforting to me as an aspiring actress.    4. She does accents better than anyone I know; especially southern accents.  I'm from Alabama, was in the Army, and lived for 6 months in South Carolina-she got the accent of the old south, the accent of the new south, and the particular dialect down to a tee.  I was pretty fascinated.    5. www.greenissexy.org  Enough said.

AA11169105	I find it hard to reconcile the production costs of an ebook versus a standard book. also, what reduction is there for the lack of ability to sell on as second hand? the author only gets about 50p a copy, so where does the rest go?|`|eed326a0722ca2d2c57d8a6bce5110a0aa	ive used ebooks but only really for reference when there isnt another way to get a proper paper copy, although for fiction doesnt make alot of sence to me|`|cd8581c7a80494fd4bdb2cf1069ac931aa	Try this site. http://www.globusz.com/   I have been toying with buying the Sony reader (I wish someone had bought it for Christmas for me!) but it is the price of the eBook that has discouraged me. I might re-think it. Anyway, judging from the spelling in some of the answers to you, a few more people could do with reading a bit more!!|`|b8f0CfSsaa	There really isn't any advantage! Looking at a computer screen for too long can also give you headaches, so a paper copy is better.    If you visit www.gutenberg.org you can read almost any book for free that was written more than 50 years ago as that is when natural copy write expires.|`|AA10645224	THERE'S A SUCKER BORN EVERY MINUTE    YOU SAVE YOURSELF A TRIP TO THE BOOKSTORE    EBOOKS CAN BE COPIED AND SHARED WITH MANY AT ONCE|`|VaA74PCZaa	There's probably some people who are just TOO lazy to turn pages of books.

There's no real advantage, some people just prefer their books to be in file form rather than book form. I suppose it does save a lot of space.|`|AA10015648	When a technology is new, it's almost always more expensive than the alternative. Hybrid cars used to be way too expensive for anyone but the stars to afford - but now they're more and more affordable because of the initial supporting costs that fueled (no pun intended) the industry to find a cheaper way to make the cars. More money at the beginning generates support, and generates income so that the technology can be created more efficiently, and can become more inexpensive in the long run.    ebooks are still early in their conception, and there are still several different ereaders and technologies that are warring for the top spot. Until there is a single unified way to view electronic books, the cost will be high because of the support costs of the technology, not because the book itself is worth that much.    The incentive is to support a new technology. That's why people bought Hybrids at such a high price, not becuase it was necessarily the MOST cost effective or efficient way to spend money, but because it allowed for better technology in the future. If you don't think that the ebooks will go anywhere, then don't spend your money, and buy a real book instead.    Best of Luck!

Hub1UGqPaa	My son is 12 and is interested in it. He is interested in more 'worldly history' than I ever have been.  He has researched and learned more about it than I ever knew.  Of course, he's smarter than I'll ever be too.  I asked why he was so interested, he said - it's a vital part of people's history.  Ours as Americans and our ancestors (he is of German decent) AND the jewish people. It shows just how lucky we are to live in a country where we can freely choose our religion and beliefs.  He has also asked many times if I felt Hilter was forgiven when he died because he doesn't think he should've been.  I told him I honestly don't know the answer to do that; but I feel there have been some people who lived on this earth who worked for Satan and he was probably one of them.     Yes...this was a conversation with my "12" year old!!      I swear, that kid is going to be something big one day and his stupid ol' mom and is just going to sit back and smile.|`|0ZnX6Qjyaa	nope they are the me generation they think they are entitled to everything without doing any work|`|x8Rir2aOaa	I am very interested in the holocaust--im 15    Wow..don't listen to the scot dude above me...  I still believe that studying the holocaust is very interesting, and that EVERYONE should study it, you know, to make sure that everyone understands the atrocities Hiltler did to this group of people, and the destruction it had on the world. I've been to the US holocaust museum in Washington DC., and it was eye opening really, I went there on a school trip when i was 13. I still can't understand the absolutely horrifying things those poor people went through, and i really don't ever want to-have to- experience those, I think we should try to understand it though.That's why i believe that the holocaust should be studied, to prevent history from repeating itself as much as possible.     I read Anne Frank's diary in 4th grade, on my own-no assignments. And when i went to 8th grade, they actually introduced it to us-and we had to do this play about it in english :s. I guess it is being taught still. I really don't know if they go into it in history-I'm in 9th grade american history, and we just went straight through WWII with no mention of it really. But i think that's just because it "american history"- we really just talked about the battles and treaties...    As i have said before, I am very interested in the Holocaust, you can read my first paragraph for my opinion. : )    BTW I'm from the US, and *so far* we haven't gone to far into the holocaust, besides 8th english when we talked about the concentration camps anne frank's family went to and other things. We talked mostly about how the US had strong patriotism during WWii, and the amount of soldiers who volunteered after the bombing of pearl harbor, and the key battles with japan and berlin airlift... and other thigns. But I am sure that we talk about the Holocaust really in depth in world history(10th grade).    Later,    Green Day     edit: Shabo: i understand your opinion as well, but I still believe we should have to study it, I'm not interested in the Korean war, but we still had to study it and for good reason, we helped one country from being taken over by communism, and they now today live in a presidential republic. THe USA is built on preventing more horrible things to people (taxation without representation, spanish inquistition, religous barriers?), we shouldn't forget about these things from history, lest we fall back into the ravine of the scorn of humanity, that we haave made progress climbing out of, through rememberance of history and action. Myschool is fairly interested in history and in current events...which is  a bit surprising...lol      And that's my opinion : )|`|el8yX5q3aa	They should be.  It is history and if you forget history you are doomed to repeat it.  You can learn a lot from knowing about history.    It is like when you live your life.  It is the experience of life that helps you grow and get insight.  Same with history.  History is the life experience of the world ...and if you ever want to know why things are like they are and what NOT to do...you should know that experience.    It is exciting and interesting and you really don't want to sound dumb when you are talking .....You can't talk intelligently if you don't know history.|`|36ukxyZPaa	We were taught about the holocaust from around age 8... Softly at first, but gradually into more detail as the years went on.  In year 10 (About 14 years old)  our school had a trip to Auschwitz.  I found it fascinating, as we did it in quite depth in year 11, about quite a bit regarding the nazi regime.  One of my favourite topics actually.    And yesterday, me and some other friends went to a Holocaust memorial day held by another college (16/17 now).    So yes - learning about the Holocaust is compulsory. Over here at least. And i think it better that way - Im not Jewish, nor do i have any connection with the Holocaust (Except My grandad fought in teh RAF during WW2).  But i believe kids, should learn about it, not only to show respect for the soldiers in WW2, and the millions of people that died,   But to also try and do the best to prevent such an awful thing from happening again.|`|qR7lwYeraa	I'm 22, and it doesn't interest me.....|`|g2QUNwZzaa	they should be interested. it was the second-largest mass slaughter of a people ever recorded. and should never be forgotten for the atrocity of it    (fyi, joseph stalin killed more russians while he was in power than hitler killed anybody, at least he was on our side during dubya dubya 2)|`|d5COR2S2aa	wow... everyone about 50?! but i get what you're saying - most of my classmates aren't all that interested. they just want to know the basic dates and facts and then forget it all right after the history exam =(    oh well, i'm still interested in the holocaust. i'm 16 btw :)|`|F4iwRgISaa	I am still interested in it , I am 21. I agreee with you. My sister is 15 and is in the 10th grade they still teach it and watch shindler's list ( parents have to sign release form tho) and they teach how they did when I was in school.|`|kktoXldiaa	Im interested in the holocaust,it's actually one of my favorite subjects in history besides learning about black history. I became interested when sometime in middle school my mom bought me the ann frank book because were learning about her in class and I became very interested in it.   the book is very insperational and I love watching documentry's on survivors on it so that you can get a real feel for it and what it was like. Im 16 yrs. old and I really enjoy learning about it.|`|WqkOI7RDaa	Okay, our interest (or lack thereof) in a certain historical event has nothing to do with whether or not we work for what we have. But way to get a useless stereotype in there, Scot. I have so much more respect for your generation now.     To answer your question, it's taught in segments between 6th and 8th grade, in both History and English. They get pretty deep in, I remember seeing some pretty disturbing stuff. I don't remember having any particular interest in it. I mean, it was an awful tragedy and I paid attention while we were studying it, but I wouldn't go so far as to take a college course directly about it.    My disaster of choice is the Titanic. Man, I know more about the Titanic than you would think possible.    Most of the younger generation would be more interested in September 11, and the following war, because that's our generation, whereas the slaughter in Germany blends in with Pol Pot's murders and al the other genocides that happened before we were born.|`|BfmV2KpUaa	I should hope at least most people aged 20 have some understanding of it. If they don't, that's really very worrying.  I was told about it quite a young age, I'm 40 now, though when I grew up, my parents worked alongside people that had been in the War. My Dad even worked with a holocaust survivor from Poland who showed him the tattoo on his arm.   History however is a subject I only became more interested in as I got older. so I've read about it and studied it for myself, and I still learn new things about the subject. I found the BBC Documentary on Auschwitz from 2006 very thought provoking and informative.  I wasn't aware for example, that the Auschwitz facility was a large complex of several camps over a wide area, with outbuildings and smaller camps several miles away from the main camp. The Nazis even bought cottages two miles away from the main camp and converted them to use as gas chambers. The main camp even had a brothel.  There were some successful escapes, though few and far between, with terrible retributions on those in the camp when people succeeded in escaping. One time after a mass break out, some 300 or so prisoners escaped. Most were eventually caught, but 4000 people were immediately killed as punishment.  What I find most disturbing today are the numbers of politically motivated people that claim it never happened, despite the overwhelming evidence by way of testimonies from survivors and even SS guards that are still alive today who regret that they worked at the camp.    To people who say history is in the past and has no bearing on today, then I quote them George Santayana, as used in William M.

Besides, can you really trust the answers you're given?|`|YwdFUCQtaa	If you think that 'do your own homework' is a rude comment, hard luck. Do your own homework.

No problem, you wannabe photographer!|`|hl4kkvXhaa	Well, this isn't rude...but you'll probably find it as such.  By cheating on your homework or test, rather than doing it yourself, you're cheating yourself out of an education...and, if you didn't want to take the time to learn a course that is usually an elective (something you chose to take because you're interested in learning it), then you shouldn't have taken it.  If it's your major, then you have to remember that even the theories and history of your subject is important to learn.  When I was a music therapy major, I despised music theory class because it picked music apart...shredded it to bits to examine it...but I realized that it was important to know, so I took the extra effort to learn it.  That's what you need to do here.      You have the book, or the e-book, at your disposal, and you should put it to good use.  If you don't, then take the time to research your answers on google or yahoo. As bored as you might get, you may find something interesting that captures your attention, and helps you learn something new.    In all honesty, after being on this earth 34 years, I can honestly say that I'm fed up with inept people who hold a degree and get paid well for not knowing a darned thing that they went to school for!  You're paying for you education to give you an edge...and it's not fair to those of us who put the time in to learn what we need to learn so we can get a better life for our families, and get stuck with low paying crappy jobs because someone cheated themselves and the system.    So...do your own homework so that you are actually educated in the career you choose!
DVuWsb2raa	I think that in regards to using despair to help with despair-- aka empathy certainly helps. It nice to know someone knows how you feel, or is at least attempting to understand how you are feeling.     I tend to use a mixture of empathy, and brutal honesty with friends when they are experiencing the dark place of despair.     I empathize with their frustration.. and I am brutally honest with them in how despair is a state of mind, and you can either say there and be miserable, or you can adopt a different mindset. This goes with any negative "state of mind."    People relating to you, and then you throwing reality in their face tends to cause a real reaction, and in my experience--- if they want the change, they'll make it.|`|8UP6iQ5Zaa	By referring to the life lessons I learned while there, thereby offering encouragement and comfort and support to others. "We are not here to be comforted, but to be comforters."|`|3908da29f0769fb75937d8093758a4f4aa	I use it to connect with others.  Despair is lonely, extremely lonely.  If someone else is there, the loneliness is not the same.    When people are in serious trouble, if they have someone with them, a "survival dyad", then they are far more likely to get through whatever trauma they're experiencing.   So, if  you're familiar with despair, then the despair of others will not scare you away. You can identify, and that ability to be with that other person can save that person's life.|`|IjuCpH4vaa	Show them that in my darkest hours I survived, I persevered and it really did get better.

hl4kkvXhaa	Well, I'm not sure, but for some reason, this reminds me a bit of the children's show Oswald, though Oswald never wore a monocle and top hat that I remember.    When I try to picture this in my mind (which isn't all that hard since I love creating things like this when I'm writing stories for my little girl) I see a very professional and stately looking octopus...he's in his beautiful underwater mansion, entertaining friends.  The art on the wall would be a self portrait, and a few portraits of mermaids (something similar to Mona Lisa with a flipper...but not Mona Lisa of course).  On the tables and stands, you might see underwater things...sand dollars, a few clam shells with pearls, starfish, and things of that nature.  He's sitting at an elegant dining table with his friends (a dinner party)...and a few of his "arms" are playing the piano behind him.      I'm not sure if this is what you're looking for...my idea would have to be cartoonish...but I just can't see any other way to go about using the theme of an octopus with a top hat and monacle.

The manuscript needs to be thoroughly edited and polished to perfection.  2. He needs to learn about submission guidelines.  3. He needs to learn about how to write a query letter and then write one.  4. He needs to learn how to do his research for his particular genre.  5. He needs to pick up a copy of "The Writer's Market as a part of the aforementioned research.     If you or your friend have not done the research and think publishing is as simple as submitting a draft you both have it all wrong. I suggest you both start getting to work on what needs to be done in order to be published. With the direction he is going now it will never be published.

NYU37jfGaa	I think those numbers are a wild exaggeration.  I have always understood the total killed in the Civil War to be something like 100,000 in England, and perhaps another 60,000 in Scotland.      Of course, that represents a much larger proportion of the population than it would do today.  In 1600, the population of the Uk was only about 6 million, whereas by the time of the Second World War it was about 41 million.  So 160,000 dead in the Civil War would be the equivalent of about 600,000 dead in the Second World War, or I suppose about a million today, proportionally.|`|AA12338492	It would be very difficult to tell exactly as they didn't really keep perfectly accurate details of war deaths back then.  But there seems to be some record of at least 84000 dead and a good estimate in England would be 100000.  Scottish records were not as good but it can be estimated that about 60000 would have died.  It should also be noted however that many others would have died from starvation, disease, and being unable to make a living after suffering injury

47FsMLlwaa	The news is... there is no news. Stephanie Meyer has not started working on Midnight Sun again since the manuscript leaked and put a sour taste in her mouth.      Nothings changed. Stephenie has no plans to move forward with Midnight Sun at this time.       However, all is not lost! Stephanie has quietly been working on another novel.

Wesley - So you're saying Stephenie Meyer is punishing her fans because someone she trusted leaked the manuscript? So we're to blame for that, because we're interested in her books and would like to read the next one. No one (that I know of) personally asked this 'trusted person' to purposely leak it. If she honestly feels that way, then that reinforces my 'drama queen' point.   When she found out it was leaked, she leaked it herself. And to that we're meant to say "No thank you, Mrs Meyer, I think it was wrong that it was leaked and refuse to read it."?  That's stupid.|`|WshwHtk9aa	"drama queen"    Seriously? This is her living. Someone she trusted essentially STOLE it by posting it without permission AND they put it out for FREE (again, this is how she makes her living). And the person did it because FANS demanded it. She's right to stop writing it and to hold her fans accountable for their actions. If the fans had said "that's not right to put that out, we're not going to read it," then she'd still be writing it and you'd all have your book. But the fans didn't. They not only STOLE it, but loved doing so to someone they are supposed to support and respect. She is not being a "drama queen" to be angry about it. What fans and her leaker did is to DISRESPECT her, to INSULT her.    She should stop writing it. It's been tainted by premature release. She cannot write it the same now. As the writer and creator, she is right to stop living in her creation when she can no longer do so due to outside influences.      EDIT: So, to be clear, it is your position Haylee, that STEALING from the rich is right? That it is OK? That if someone stole Stephen King's next book and released it for free without giving him a cent, that is OK? It is not a matter of whether or not you feel sorry for her, it is a matter of what is or is not RIGHT or WRONG. This was WRONG. Maybe she'll financially survive it, maybe you don't feel for her loss, maybe she doesn't care about her art and characters and just wants more money (unlikely), but that in no way changes the ethical basis that it was wrong.|`|BpcAVgEeaa	Dude, Wesley, Stephenie Meyer is filthy rich because of her books AND the movies AND all of the ridiculous amount of fan accessories. I don't feel sorry for her in the least bit. Besides, who wants to read something that is just a rip off of her other book?

pD1mDWLQaa	Well WWI was started over the assination of the Archduke Francis Ferdinand bt Serbians.  This caused a domino effect with treaties and war broke out. Only the US at the start was not involved, it took things like the Zimmerman papers and the sinking of the Lusitania that brought in US intervention.    It was to start the Central Powers vs the Allies consisting of Germany, Austrio-Hungary, and the Ottoman Empire vs Britain (and provinces) France (and colonies) and Belgium, Italy and even Japan fought on the Allied side. The US fought too for the Allies after they entered in 1917 three years into the war.  It was almost a stale mate but it might have changed to a German victory had the US not entered.  When Russia left the war for the Allies and had a Revolution inspired by the Germans, it allowed millions of new troops to the Western front they planned to over weigh the allies, it only failed in my opinion due to the US entereing with also millions of fresh troops and also a new idea to end the trench stalemates.    The war ended in an Armistice and the German army never truly lost the war the Weimar Republic over threw basically the Kaiser who was forced to Abdicate and an armistice was sought and they paid very heavy compensations to the Allies which broke their economy and led rise to a WWI Corporal Adolf Hilter into a rage that one day he unleashes on the world in WWII.    That is what started WWII, WWI never truly ended and it was fought out again by many of the same people who were young German soldiers that felt the Army was not defeated but betrayed!!    Hitler fed on this and is oratory skills took over Germany and the rest we know.    I do not think we have had a WWIII yet. Cold war was not a lg scale war and we are not now so thats my opinion.|`|55vTVIxnaa	Most probably we won't have a WWIII, as the U.S. and Soviet Union are not against each other anymore...    WWI was started because all the European countries and nations were sorta 'angry' with each other..the spark that started it was when Archduke Franz Ferdinand of Austria-Hungary went to Serbia and was assassinated..    As for WWII, it started because of Hitler's greed...he invaded Czechoslovakia when part of it was given to him...yup..    hope it was of some help :)|`|nRnokrwKaa	World War One began because of numerous causes, both long- and short-term, to say that it was simply because of Archduke Franz Ferdinand being assassinated is all too simple (no offense if that was your opinion!).  The road leading up to the first world war was a tense one, in which various minor crises kept the tension escalating and, due to the nature of Imperial mindsets on the part of Britain and Germany in particular (Britain had an empire to maintain, Germany was attempting to create one with her 'Weltpolitik' scheme under the famous Kaiser 'Bill'), no-one would back down. These national contests of military and diplomatic muscle are best demonstrated in the long-running 'naval race' from 1906 onwards (in 1906 the HMS Dreadnought was launched, making all other battleships of the day obsolete because of her revolutionary design, and the British plan to outfit her whole fleet with Dreadnought-Class ships lead Germany, who had it in mind to compete with Britian in empire-building and such, began building their own Dreadnought fleet with copied British designs).  Other crises such as British military insecurity after the disastrous Boer War and the German Kaiser's antagonism of the colonial situation during this war lead to Britain, first, seeking alliances with the likes of France and Russia, to add to her own security while she attempted to build her military back up to Imperial standards. This then led Germany to seek out alliances in case her aggressive expansion plans led to competition becoming violence against Britain and her allies.   In the end it was the Balkans crisis (which was incidentally another long-running source of tension between the imperial Austrians and eastern europe) in which the Serbian nationalist terrorist group 'The Black Hand' shot Archduke Franz Ferdinand of the Austro-Hungarian Empire, to whom Germany was allied, declaring war on Serbia, Whom Russia were involved with, and, in turn, who Britain and France were allied to. Basically the assassination was the spark that set off a whole lot of tension that had been building up for nearly twenty years.    World war two kicked off, again, because of long-term causes, most importantly due to the treaty of Versailles that had 'resolved' the first world war. WW1 ended only because the participants were worn out in terms of economy, manpower and morale, both on the front and at home. The signing of the armistace by the Germans (who had been told by their government all the way through that they had been winning the war even when defeat after defeat were being inflicted on them) angered the German people and resulted in mutinies and rebellions and eventually the abdication of the Kaiser, and his replacement with a Republican government. The Treaty of Versailles then damaged this Republican government's credibility when they, becuase of the state of the German military, were forced to accept the extortionate terms (If WW2 had not have happened, Germany would have been paying the allies reparations until the 1980s!). Therefore Germany's plans of military dominance were crushed (their military was restricted to little more than a home-defence force) and their economy was dependant on loans from the USA. Morale was low.    Elsewhere, in Britain and France, with Germany taken out of the equation, and Russia in the midst of political upheaval with the Bolshevik revolution, pacifism after the massive losses of the war lead to armed forces being ill-maintained and/or disbanded.     The low morale of Germany resulted in numerous crises and minor revolts that eventually spawned the National Socialist German Worker's Party (NSDAP in Germany abbreviation, also known as the Nazi Party) who became popular after German morale hit an all-time low when in 1929 the wall street crash caused America to recall her loans from Germany and hence ruined her economy. Once Hitler came to power in 1933 he began a program of economic and public works that made the German people proud again, and he also disobeyed the Treaty of Versailles and rebulit Germany's military (The allies refused to do anything about it as their pacifism still remained after the war). Hitler knew that Britain and France were no threat with their reduced militaries, and only the USSR in the east posed a threat (he hence allied with them in 1939, promising half of Poland in the event of invasion there). Through 1937-8 Hitler engaged in increasingly aggressive expansions, first reclaiming the territories they had lost after WW1, and then annexing Austria and invading Czechoslovakia, all the time cleverly guaging the allies' responses. However the allies (minus America, of course) finally declared war upon the Polish invasion in September 1939.    Sorry if that was a bit long-winded, but they're not wars that are simple to explain! Anyway, hope that helps!|`|eb7939afceea213fb37cb6c2a376ba3faa	Germans. No.|`|1kZenfZzaa	Germany caused both of them.  Nope, a world war is exactly what it says it is.

cGHQ8BFsaa	The Mortal Instruments by Cassandra Clare. There are two books out right now; City of Bones and City of Ashes. The third book, City of Glass, is on shelves March 24. The romance reminds me a lot of Twilight, and the main male character, Jace, reminds me a lot of Edward. Not sure why, they're not THAT much alike. But he does. The books were also endorsed by Stephanie Meyer. She said, "The Mortal Instruments series is a story world that I love to live in. Beautiful!" There are vampires in the book, but the main characters aren't vampires.    Here is a brief synopsis from School Library Journal.    From School Library Journal  Grade 8 UpWhen Clary Fray witnesses three tattoo-covered teenagers murder another teen, she is unable to prove the crime because the victim disappears right in front of her eyes, and no one else can see the killers. She learns that the teens are Shadowhunters (humans who hunt and kill demons), and Clary, a mundie (i.e., mundane human), should not be able to see them either. Shortly after this discovery, her mother, Jocelyn, an erstwhile Shadowhunter, is kidnapped. Jocelyn is the only person who knows the whereabouts of The Mortal Cup, a dangerous magical item that turns humans into Shadowhunters. Clary must find the cup and keep it from a renegade sector of Shadowhunters bent on eliminating all nonhumans, including benevolent werewolves and friendly vampires. Amid motorcycles powered by demon energies, a telepathic brotherhood of archivists, and other moments of great urban fantasy, the story gets sidetracked by cutesy touches, like the toasted bat sandwich on the menu of an otherworldly restaurant. The characters are sporadically characterized and tend toward behavior that is both predictable and slightly repellentClary finds out who her real father is about 200 pages after readers will have it figured out. Despite the narrative flaws, this version of New York, full of Buffyesque teens who are trying to save the world, is entertaining and will have fantasy readers anxiously awaiting the next book in the series.Heather M.

Her books are about the same length as Twilight and Harry Potter and have awesome storyline's.  She's written The Song of the Lioness series, The Immortals series, and The Protector of the Small series.  All three sets of books are set in the same land and are related but they can easily be read in any order.  She's also written two other quartets called The circle of Magic and The Circle Opens.  One of the reason I like her books so much is because they actually have depth and are written so that older teens and early 20's can get into the story and enjoy it without getting bored.  Her books are extremely well written and I love them.|`|9QDHn5Emaa	Try reading Anne Rice's Vampire Chronicles...it's the bestest of all vampire series...Im not a Twitard so...I really recommend you a book that has  a complete plot...

2AdJStDYaa	how about the lion and the mouse?    if you don't know it:    little mouse was playing in the jungle, and accidently came across a sleeping lion. he woke up and grabbed her and roared, "how dare you wake me?" i am the king of the jungle!" and the mouse said " o i'm sorry great lion i did not mean to wake you! please do not eat me! one day you may need help and i will forever be in your debt, and i will help you!" the lion laughed and said "it is impossible that one as feeble and small as you could help ME. however, you have made me laugh, and i am not hungry." he put her down and she said "thank you great king!" and ran off. a few weeks later the lion got caught in a hunter's net. he roared in anger as he heard the hunters far away coming towards him. the mouse heard his roar, and scurried to his rescue. "great lion! hold still! i will have you free soon!" and the mouse chewed through the ropes, and the lion was free. "thank you little mouse, the lion said." they escaped.    moral: don't underestimate small people, for they can do great things
24c53b4b1408a13afb9de7e22c10a1d5aa	Well, try think about it like this -     How would a beggar act when going into the store? Why did he/she go in there? What did he want to find / get / accomplish? What was he doing right before he decided to go in there? What gave him the courage / will / desire to go into a place where obviously he was not suited for?    How does he feel as people notice him? As they see his clothes, his hair? How do they react? Do they leave? Hug their children and scurry away?    I would approach this monologue as an INTERNAL monologue, as in, describe what he's thinking and feeling. Talk about how he's a person just like they are, just on hard times.     How about someone recognizes him in the store? Maybe he was rich once and one of his old tennis buddies recognizes him? What does he do? Ignore him and leave? Offer help? Would he talk to him?    Your first line suggests that he would come in and start complaining out loud? I don't think that sounds realistic - he'd be booted out by security immediately....    Also, would he walk right into the middle of the store? Try to hide behind clothes racks?  What kind of store is it? How would he feel about not being able to afford what it sells? Would he imagine / fantasize about how amazing it would be to taste that expensive hot chocolate?     Those are just ideas, but I hope that helps you get started.

gb9REJN4aa	I think you've radically oversimplified.    First off, I think the Union position was as much about, well, union as it was about slavery. Some people in the north were fighting for territorial integrity; some were fighting for abolition of slavery; some were fighting to keep their jobs in an industrial northern city when the breadbasket of the nation, the south, was threatening to leave and to stop producing purchasable food for them; and some were fighting for reasons of cultural superiority, believing "Yankee ingenuity" to be simply better than "Southern gentlemanliness." Obviously, many people were fighting for a number of these reasons all rolled up together.    Similarly, in the south, people were fighting for states' rights; and they were fighting to preserve slavery (explicitly--this was a Confederate position too); and they were fighting for economic viability vs. the more prosperous north; and they were fighting to preserve a cultural heritage that had to do with a lot more than slavery, but also with vast estates, "country living," and agrarian modes of production. Obviously, these issues were all bound up together for southerners, too.    I guess my answer, then, is that they were fighting over both slavery and states' rights, that these things were bound up together, and that in fact they were fighting over a number of other things, too. If you took a random soldier, including ranking officers, I think you'd hear a multiplicity of reasons they were fighting. So basically, I don't think the Union position was simply "slavery is bad," and I don't think the Confederate position was merely "we want greater self-governance" with no question of slavery or economic viability, and in the end I don't think the war can be expressed as being fought over any one of those options.|`|xQwU590Laa	Yes!|`|6KaMW1Vzaa	The two aren't really separable, but if it had been about slavery, the thirteenth amendment and reparations for the slaveowners would have been called for before a shot was fired.

The site below is very good.    http://americanhistory.about.com/od/civi...|`|rtsfPQqMaa	The Civil War was publicly fought over regional territories and State's Rights because of slavery-     The succession of the Southern States was provoked by disagreements over whether or not new states entering the Union would allow slavery- debating if slavery fell in federal or state jurisdiction. i.e The Missouri Compromise- which sparks revolts and violence in protest by the anti-slavery side.    Abe Lincoln becomes President, it is now clear that the South's way of life is compromised and with this election South Carolina succeeds.    with these events being in place it is shown that while slavery was the catalyst in the sectional discord.. The fight between State and Federal power became the method of creating a political argument for the succession and ultimately the war. The socioeconomic factors at play with the slavery debate is crucial to the war (not necessarily a persons right to freedom) This is how the South made its money and survived. If slavery began to fade and became illegal all of the free labor would dissolve and the economy of the South would crumble- since that is not a great ethical argument- it became a state rights argument.|`|WYngdeacaa	I think you can't have a single answer because there were so many people involved.  Millions in the North and millions in the South were involved.  Each person had their own reasons and often several reasons for supporting on side or another.    Some people fought to end slavery.  Joshua Lawrence Chamberlain, hero of Gettysburg, certainly said it was his main reason for fighting.    Some fought because they thought they had to support their home people.   General James Longstreet, Lee's favorite subordinate, had little use for state's rights or slavery.  He just couldn't right against his own.  Robert E Lee was of similar sentiment.  He believed session was illegal and he ran his plantation with hired labor instead of slaves.    Some fought out of loyalty to their country and the ideals of the founding fathers.  Union Generals Thomas, Buford, and Scott were all Southern born and raised.  Their loyalty was to the nation and the concept of the nation.    Some fought out of the need to maintain the superiority of the white race.  Confederate Vice President Alexander Stephens argued tooth and nail against secession.  However, he gloried in the way the Confederacy enshrined slavery and white supremacy in their constitution.  He even gave a famous speech on how the Confederacy was the first nation founded on the "truth" (his word) that white men are superior.    Some fought because of states rights.  They believed that each state was a sovereign nation.  The constitution was at most a "treaty of alliance" between the states and like an alliance, could be ended by one side.  Confederate President Jefferson Davis thought so.  In his view, the Northern members of this "alliance" (my metaphor not his) were overstepping their bounds by interfering in the internal affairs of the Southern members.  It would be like, in NATO, the US trying to force the Netherlands to criminalize Marijuana and prostitution.  The Netherlands can just leave the NATO alliance.    Some people fought because of cultural and economic conflict.  Many Southerners saw the North's industrial might creating such wealth and such population that the nation would soon be dominated by North.  Their "pride" in the South's gentile agriculture tradition kept them from industrializing or wanting to industrialize.  In fact many saw the North's opposition to slavery as a trick to cripple the South's agricultural economy and force them to industrialize and become like the North.  They wanted to preserve their "way of life".    At the same time, the North saw the South as backwards and in love with the past.  The industrial revolution was creating wealth and progress on a massive scale, and the South was too stubborn to realize it.  Rather, they were trying to destroy the Union so they could hang on to a fantasy world.    You can't say there was a single reason people fought.  However, slavery was the match that lit the fuse.  In every other area of disagreement, a compromise was found.  Except for Slavery, people in New Jersey could care less what people in South Carolina did.  On the flip side, people in South Carolina could care less about the economic boom in the New Jersey as long as they were left alone.    Slavery was an issue that could not be resolved.  Norther states believed in "states rights" too, even if not as strongly as the southern ones.  Slavery was the only act of "states rights" that became an issue.  The US government of the time was so small and hands off that nothing else came into play.|`|Usk295PHaa	I think it was fought over states rights. To make it look good and pretty they made it seem like it was for slavery, but for how long it actually took to get rid of slavery I doubt is was for that reason.|`|5llBXFF4aa	The Civil war was fought over slavery.  There's absolutely no doubt that slavery was the cause of the Civil War. I could write volumes (as others have done) proving it, but all you have to do is listen to the words of the Confederate leaders PRIOR to the War. Jefferson Davis and the other southern leaders said very plainly that it was the protection of slavery for which they fought - that they fought for the right not only to have slaves (which no one - not Lincoln or anyone else in the government, was trying to take from them), but to EXPAND slavery into more territories. Davis and the other leaders wanted to annex Cuba and other Central American countries specifically in order to expand the power base of slavery.    The so-called "state's rights" argument is weak. The ONLY right that the south cared about was the right to have slaves. The "economic oppression" argument is invalid, because the factor that was keeping the southern economy lagging behind the north was the used of slave labor, which prevented high wages, prevented manufacturing from thriving, and prevented economic growth outside of planting.     It's revisionist history to suggest that it was about anything else.  If you go to the sources of the time - most importantly the words of people like Jefferson Davis and the other slave-power leaders who plotted to seceed for years before they'd even heard the name Lincoln, you'll see that they were focused on retaining and EXPANDING the slavery base, and that's the cause for which they fought.  they used "stae's rights" and "northern oppression" propoganda to mislead the southern people, many of whom were not slaveholders and either disliked the practice or had no strong opinion.      Lincoln was made out to be an abolitionist and dangerous to the southern way of life (specifically to slavery) when in fact he was a moderate who said over ajnd over again that he had no intention of working against slavery where it already existed.  However, he was against the spread of it to new territories, and this was unacceptable to the slave-power minority.
gAWWyDLhaa	First, write your story.    Edit your book several times to make it the best it can be, type it in proper manuscript form (visit http://www.writersdigest.com to find out what is needed), consider joining a local writer's group to get feedback from other would-be writers, and get it proofread by someone who knows what they are doing (don't rely just on spellcheck). Edit it some more.    There are a tiny number of publishers that accept unsolicited manuscripts (those that don't go through a literary agent), so getting an agent first is a really good idea.    At the library or bookstore is Guide to Literary Agents, published by Writer's Digest, or Bowker's Literary Marketplace (or visit http://www.agentquery.com). Look for agents that specialize in your genre, and are looking for new clients. Read, and follow, their submission guidelines. In those books will be something about writing a query letter, which is what you send to the agent, first. It's part synopsis of your book, and part explanation as to why your book deserves to be published. You have only that one-page letter to wow the agent, so take the time to make it a good one. Expect the whole process to take lots of time, and expect many rejections. When you are accepted by an agent, they will send your book to publishers, not you. The whole process is free, except for postage, until your book is bought by a publisher. That is when the agent gets their cut (usually 15%) of the money which would go to you.     Good luck!|`|LYdxypciaa	Find out different addresses of different publishes (from the front of books and online) and send your story to as many as possible i'm guessing and hope for a reply :) x|`|AA10954273	Start by getting an agent.  Stephen King wrote a book called "On Writing" that has some good advice on getting an agent and trying to sell your manuscript.|`|AHuBqplbaa	Go to the bookstore and read the jackets of the books - they all list the publisher.  Make sure to choose books as close as possible to what you have written.  Get as many as possible - you will need them all.    But really to do it properly you need to find an agent - they are the first step in culling out all the junk from the hundreds of manuscripts sent daily, and most publishers will only speak to an agent and not the writer themselves.|`|Xc02z608aa	Well, in this day and age, publishers rarely accept unsolicited material, so first you will need an agent.  Go to http://www.writersdigest.com    That site has great information on getting an agent and getting published.|`|ve4K3rb1aa	it's a bit of minefeild to be honest. what you need to do is finish the book. and edit until it is perfect.    after that you need to get a copy of the writers hand book by barry turner - it lists all the agents and publishers in the uk, us and ireland.    along with the contact details you will find whether they accept unsolicited ms or not, and what sort of material they are looking for.    then you send them a query, some ask for just a query letter, others ask of a query plus a synopsis, some want the first three chapters.    make sure to follow the guidelines to the word because a lot of agents and publishers won't even look at your work if it isn't submitted the right way.    get a copy of 'from pitch to publication' by carole blake. she runs a literary agency and rreally knows what she is talking about. it's the best book on publishing i've read, and it really lays it out and makes it simple.    sometimes they will just reject the work, sometimes they will ask to read more or it. sometimes they will pass on that too.,    it can take years and hundreds of rejections before you get published. it doesn't mean you can't write, it just means that you haven't found the right place for your book yet.    don't loose heart.    but the main thing is to finsih first

dHjjLozcaa	I think that he knew that there was definitely something different about his daughter, like he totally knew that she wasn't human anymore. I think that at first he probably hated Edward and the rest of the Cullen's for changing his daughter, but after he met Renesmee he pretty much fell in love with the idea that he was a grandfather and he didn't care as long as his daughter was healthy, safe and happy.

Huge book about nothing until the last ten pages. I vowed never again but I did. Dolores Clayburn or whatever that was. That was so it for me. No more.

0LgpcOBDaa	You didn't tell us which side of the camera you wanted to be on..?    Or, if your a male or female.    Lets assume your a male and want to be behind the camera. This is where most of the fantasy's start.     For one you have to be able to take pictures. Not just point an shoot kind but real, good looking images have to come from your camera with your BIG head thinking. Ya know, the one on your shoulders with TWO eyes.. Have a gift of gab. Be able to present your self as able and confident. Don't be cocky, smart, rude or with an attitude. Some may be shy and if you make them look good in pictures, you lore than likely have a "friend" and one who will - good mouth you and not - bad mouth you. Understand.?    Of course you need a place to do it, with lights. Many people don't wanna do 'it' with bright lights on, especially a few hundred or thousand extra watts worth. Location is important. Many positions are in the shade down there and you need to light things up. The place has to be safe. Secure. No casual walk in's. Turn the phones off. All of them. Neighbors, will they be looking?    Models. Do you know anyone open and brave enuf to get it down in front of you and your camera..? If so, your part way there but you will need new faces, and often. Places where you can go for a shoot. Indoor or out..!    A outlet. Where are you going to distribute these now taken images, other than to your bed room or bathroom..? Do you have a web site set up and are you going to charge people to view them - PPV, and if so how much and how are you going to collect the $$.Pay Pal. Visa. AMX. Master Card. If you think your going to sell them to other sites, good luck, there are only 10 gazillion other guys in front of you and many couples these days send in a lot of their stuff for free. It's a very horny world out there and many people cant get them out of their digital cameras fast enuf to post somewhere. There are sites that say they buy material. Ask what is wanted or needed. How much do they pay. How do they pay, and are they even on US (or your country's soil). If off shore, forget about it.    Search thru the Yahoo Groups for Adult Groups that do "things" in your area. Here you may be as str8 or kinky or sick as you wish. There are groups into all kinds of stuff from swinging, sun bathing while nude, beaches, camping, 4x4ing, even road trips in motor homes, all while nude. And more. Oh boy is there more. Some can be down right OMG jaw dropping.    Anyhow, if old enuf, join some of these local groups and attend meetings. They have what is often called Meet n Greets, or GT's - Get Togethers often once a month. Go and be seen and become known. Go many time and become a active member. From these groups you may find some of what you seek.     Join AFF, ALT.com, SLS or Passion.com. They are search ready by zip codes and cities. No need looking in Florida if your in Montana.    Advertise in Craigslist for models and you will charge X amount per hour and give them the CD of everything you shot. This opens up doors as well, especially if you don't charge too much.    If you want to be in front of the camera, do some of these things backwards. Answer ads for being a nude model. Advertise for being one. If your a guy, be buff and hung..with staying power! If a gal, be very cute, a good body helps, but attitude is way more important, and most likely, be bi. It is you, the female, that is going to get the pounding, so be ready for that. However, many gals are just as much of a exhibitionist and horny as many guys and love it. The women get the better money and often the guys get paid by just being there, performing..! If your 'contract' is written well enuf you can get roaylities from sales, with the women, who work well, getting even a larger %. Some times your paid then and there. Maybe cash. Maybe not. To take pics, I was paid cash. No muss no fuss.    If YOU plan on doing this all, as YOUR business, keep records. You must comply with - Article 18 USC 2257 compliance form - and if you don't.. Good by Charlie and hello IRS and the Gray Bar Hotel. Google it.. - Article 18 USC 2257 compliance form.    Good luck    Bob - Tucson|`|YgtHaFHUaa	Never started porn, never will.

AHuBqplbaa	Very well done so far, pulls you in and keeps going, with a hint of mystery, and unlike most aspiring writers I read here, you managed to avoid the dreaded amateur information dump.    Couple of issues:     "He grabbed me by the hair and drug me so I was facing my father."  Did he drag you or drug you?  Needs revision.    N-n-no my d-d-dad has just been kidnapped. What He interrupted me.  "He interrupted me" should follow on the next line to keep who is speaking crystal clear.    I'm a little concerned that dad had to debate his own daughters life.  Is he meant to be a character verging on selfishness to the point of even considering trading his daughters life?  If so, it works perfectly.    It also seems strange to go hide in a closet, unless the character is like 8 years old.  Wouldn't you grab the stuff and get the heck out of there?  Maybe it's just me, but it seems off.  Perhaps I'm being too picky now.    Anyway, Keep writing, you've got a talent.|`|38eb78ef54653766c3ca71d79051901caa	My thoughts echo Reign's.    "Drug" is not the past tense of "drag".  It should be "dragged".    Be careful of plot holes.      No police station has "business hours".  They are open 24/7.  If you wanted to convey the idea that they, too, were not answering the phone, then you should just let it ring.    I also agree about the father.  No parent would even think twice in a situation like that.    Josiah is too calm.  That is strange unless that is how you meant his reactions to be.  You may want to add a thought in there.    Enough food for a month?  That has to be a huge closet, with a sink, burner and a fridge.  What would you do with the garbage? What about going to the bathroom?  And where does Josiah live that it would take a month for him to get there?    These are all the plot holes you will need to address or explain so that it would all make sense.    The base premise of the story seems interesting.  Just keep working on it and edit the kinks.|`|MtN2xgoSaa	it sounds pretty interesting, definitely something i would read.

You may be dooming the story to oblivion by even trying to name it because it seems like you're more interested in the final product than the journey it takes to get there, and the journey is the most important part.

I didn't know they switched viewpoints in the movie, since I haven't seen the whole thing, so I really can't answer that part. It's just that Prisoner of Azkaban has always been my favorite of the series :)

Photographers love new gear, but you'll have to know what fits his existing equipment.     If he doesn't already have photo editing software, your Photoshop idea would be great.  However the full Photoshop program is quite expensive, at least in the USA.  Adobe makes a "light" version called Photoshop Elements which costs much less but does 90% of the things Photoshop does.    If he already uses Photoshop, there are tons of books on creating special effects or other aspects of using the software- those would be nice gifts.    A set of filters (polarizer/cross star/neutral density etc) would be awesome- but you'd have to know for certain that he doesn't have them already, and get the right size for his lens. You might need to enlist the assistance of a camera store employee for that- have him bring his camera & lens in for some reason, and they'll be able find matching accessories for you.      If he likes to shoot outdoors, maybe a tripod.  If he does more indoor/home studio shooting, maybe a backdrop, or a CD of digital background images to play with.|`|qGQCLFinaa	I would go to www.shutterfly.com or www.artscow.com  they have some AWESOME photo gifts that you can order & they aren't too expensive, my mom has gotten 6 photo books from there & i think 2 or 3 of them were FREE she paid S & H of course, but they are not cheap!!  I hoe that was what you were looking for, good luck!!  I think another site was www.snapfish.com|`|0MDIw8Yeaa	How much are you looking to spend? Photoshop is an extremely expensive* program -- you'll find CS4 for around a grand in the states. If you're looking for something around the $50 range, I've found the Black Rapid Strap to be worth every cent. It's a camera strap that fits like a messenger bag. The strap connects to the tripod mount of the camera (or lens, if it's a long lens), and the camera hangs upside down at the waist or at the small of your back. This means that you can carry the camera without downward pressure on the neck, which can be terrible with a heavy camera, and it also gives a bit of protection from snatch-and-grab thefts. The action of the rapid strap is smooth and natural for both portrait and landscape orientations of the camera, by my experience. I'd definitely recommend the RS-1 over the RS-2 -- the RS-2 has additional pouches to hold memory cards and all that, but the shoulder pad is much much larger, and frankly, gets in the way when shooting. Yeah, I know it's expensive for a camera strap at $50, but it's helped me be able to carry my camera more often and for much longer each time.        *Kinda makes me wonder how all these kids on answers have the latest version of photoshop...|`|hl4kkvXhaa	Depending on how much you want to (or are able to spend), you could buy a digital or 35 mm camera that has the features the person is looking for...a tripod, camera equipment bag, film (if they have that sort of camera), photography software, or one of those converters that lets you convert your old slides or negatives into digital pictures (I have one and LOVE it!), a decorative camera strap that you think they might like, a book or two on photography (like, the history of, or how to), or maybe a subscription to a photography magazine.    Hope this helps!
7ONKVbbiaa	I think it CAN matter a lot, nowadays, depending on where you are. I didn't change my DL for a while after my remarriage, and (of course), got stopped, 5 days after it ran out on my birthday. When I caught it up and changed it to new married name.. social security sent me a letter that my name no longer matched the 2 records and I was on some kind of red flag list.  So I had to scramble to change that.   Son in law just recently lost his wallet.. and proving his identity is a huge hassle. And he only has the one name.   Moral of the story is that the govt is paying more attention to identity discrepancies. The marriage record should indicate that the marriage happened, but won't necessarily identify you as now being (new) name. I suggest that you make phone calls to your drivers license office on how to change records, and social security as well. If you change from married to hyphen.. it might mean all new records. Be sure they ALL are consistent, to avoid headaches.   And never never lose your wallet.|`|vt76wtBcaa	no, you dont have to change it. i have been married for 5 years and my s.s.card still has my maiden name on it. and i have had to show it for lots of things and never had a problem...you are still that person so i dont think it matters

What is normally called perfect pitch is the ability to accurately sing a note without reference to an instrument, or to name a note without figuring it out from context. <br>  <br>  I think the idea that perfect pitch cannot be learned is an urban legend. I was not born with it, but I developed pitch awareness in high school. Now I can tell what key something is in, and can name and sing notes accurately (95% of the time) WITHOUT reference to other pitches. I don't think this is uncommon in professional musicians.<br>  <br>  I don't know if the Dave Lee pack works, although he does advertise a lot. Pitch sense is very useful to musicians. It is always good to be working on that pitch sense.|`|yOF0ZTaMaa	Perfect pitch can not be learned, and why would you want to when you can learn relative pitch?  People with perfect pitch can't tune their instruments to a piano that has swollen sharp in the humid summer.  It is fingernails on the chalkboard to them.  A well-refined relative pitch is just as useful as perfect pitch and makes a person able to enjoy playing and listening to music instead of cringing at every slightly out-of-tune instrument.<br>  Also, as you age, you perceive pitches lower than they actually are.  This can sometimes really mess with people elderly people who have perfect pitch.|`|l3qoRYfkaa	I have perfect pitch, but it is natural...it didn't come with a David Lee pack...I don't even know what that is.|`|AA11138849	You cannot be taught perfect pitch,only a few are born with it. You can be taught relative pitch only, and that takes some serious work.
ksDompGkaa	I think that the book will be much better theres has been only one movie that i liked better then the book which is Dreamcatcher.   I wish that Cathrine Hardwike i know she picked Nikki Reed to play Rosalie because they are great friends, but extremely bad choice for Rosalie i wouldn't have minded it if she was in New Moon as Leah Clearwater because Nikki Reed is part Cheerokee indian.  I also hate who they got for Lauret I understand if that it appears racist that you  don't have an Afrincan american has a kinda Main character, but you really can't change someones's race from the book.  Did you know that Tyler is black also?   I think Kristin Stewart will do a decent job not how i imagined her, but she won't do a great job because everything i seen her in she acts the exact same in.   Examples Land of Women, Zathra, The messagers.   I think Robert will do an excelent job though.  But yeah the book will be a lot better.|`|Z93I52jMaa	I totally agree with Ecullen.<br>  <br>  anything related to twilight, no madder how bad it stinks, Im loving and buying it.|`|e22d86889cb88baa6ecf401b1f6a584caa	You mean novel vs. movie right? I think people need to go into the theatre with open minds. This movie is Catherine Harwick's interpretation of Twilight, not the actual novel. The can't fit everything we deem important into the film, and I am positive they did their best. I think they did great choosing the actors, so I think it will be really good! I can't wait! Movies never can compare to books, but they do their best to bring something we love to life. I appreciate having it brought to life, so I'm not going to complain about anything, even if it sucks, which I doubt, I will buy it.|`|RQ0c6A8daa	Well, I totally agree on Rob being an *amazing* actor.  Kristen is good too, but not as good as Rob.  Also, I think you mean "Twilight the novel vs. Twilight the movie"  Lol.<br>  <br>  I think the book will always be much better than the movie because it's so amazing.  I love this series so much, it's my favorite, and the best I've ever read.|`|eB8udvNiaa	I am looking soooooo forward to the movie. from the previews, a lot of things are wrong. but I am still going to see it no matter what!|`|AA10997286	I watched the 8 minutes preview of the movie, and it was so different from the book. I remember that the Cullens didn't cook anything for Bella, Rosalie didn't break anything, and they didn't laugh like they were in a soap opera.<br>  <br>  I've always loved Robert Pattinson; way back when he was the cute Cedric Diggory. I don't like the books but I have to watch the movie because my friends are fans of it. (Oh, well. At least I get to ogle at Rob)<br>  <br>  I have three problems with Kristen. 1) Her voice is kind of deep. 2) Yes, she is lacking something. It's emotion. When she acts, she delivers her lines in monotones. Her face doesn't change expression. 3) She looks like an independent and strong woman; a description that does not match Bella in the books.|`|Kh6LI1mNaa	i think the book would be much better but the movie still will be good however there r three people who i didn't imagine them at all 1. Nikki Reed as Rosalie Hale 2. i don't care for Taylor Lauther playing Jacob Black 3. Why is Laurett black he was never black in the books?<br>  but i besides these actors i do think that the movie will be good <br>  but the novel is much better because u get to see what u see them as, in the movie u can't do that <br>  however these r the actors and actresses i do like Rachell Leavfe playing Victora just how i picture her 3. Rob Pattison playing Edward <br>  and all of the cullens but Nikki Reed who is playing ROsalie Hale <br>  its knda half and half for Kristen Stewart i think she will do a desent job as playing bella but i think there r two actresses who i would have rather seen bella as which is Danielle Panabaker her skin looks really fragile and her lips are full but not to big she also has almond shape eyes that r brown and Emily Browning her skin again looks really fragile and her eyes r that almond shape|`|OlzEo9XZaa	*lol, i have yet to see a film that is better than the book|`|EEnRQRJsaa	i think the title of ur ? is wrong u said novel vs. book i think u mean movie vs. book lol|`|LwZPMadFaa	i think the movie will will not come any near to how great the books are but i'll still be at the premiere (or however you spell it)<br>  i think robert will make a decent enough edward, i think he's hot but not enough but of course no one can realistically play edward.<br>  i really don't like kristen as bella, but maybe she'll suprise me. i also wish they would pick a better rosalie and laurent (sorry if i spelled it wrong)<br>  i love the guy (who's name i can't remember at the moment) who plays jacob, i just wish that he would stay with the short hair because with long hair he looks kind of weird.<br>  the characters who in my opinion are perfect by the person who is playing them are; Alice,Emmett, and james<br>  <br>
