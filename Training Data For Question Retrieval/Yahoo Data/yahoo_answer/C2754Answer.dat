44kEtDvIaa	Have excellent vet.  A woman who treats my animals like I do and talks to them as if they're part of the family.  Takes her time, never rushes and always willing to answer my questions and explain what she's doing.  She even explains it to my dogs.  Have had a good number of vets and she's the best one.  We go through quite a check out phase with new vets.  We have to feel comfortable with them and have had several serious discussions with some vets on their practices and putting money before the welfare of the pet and its owner, in my opinion.|`|bDPVRtCNaa	My vet saved my dog's life. The entire office is wonderful.    We have tried three vets. The first was where we used to live, and when we moved we didn't want to put our 16 year old dog through the stress of going someplace new. With our new dogs we tried the closest vet to home and weren't very happy with the way they treated us or our animals. Granted my two labs are incredibly obnoxious, they told us that if we ever wanted to bring them back to their office that it would have to be done one at a time because bringing in both was too much of a disruption to the office.     Then we found our new vet through an accident. One of my Labradors ate an entire box of paintballs and had to be rushed to an emergency clinic close to midnight. Our usual vet was not open so we took him to the only one that was.     We now take all our animals to see him regularly. You can tell he's a real animal lover.|`|bMYv0fBHaa	I question her morals on occasion, but she's an excellent doctor, one of the best around here, so I'll make do. She saved my cat from a bad deal w/ his leg, another cat from illness, and my dog from parvo many years ago, and she's not been wrong yet.|`|RVicFEyFaa	It's a mixed bag from my experience. I had a great vet but had to move a year ago. I moved to the jacked-up state of New Jersey & had an awful time finding anyone close in expertise (my 15 year old IBD has passed on since) or price from my New York vet. I test drove 3 & they were $&(* * @0! I have since found a vet in PA. that is a hike but worth it. Price gouging is common i've learned & the bedside manner is even worse sticker shock. Of course that's not every vet, but I gave up out here.|`|2fdee6b1fd597a29209ecfad9dc8b598aa	I adore my dog/cat vet.  She is the sweetest, and while she of course needs to make money, she doesn't put profit before well-being.    My ferrets' vet (yes, they are a specialized 'exotics' vet; they are even listed as one of the true 'ferret vets' in NC >hmmph    In my experience, there were only two vets I've ever thought were any good: my current dog/cat vet, and our vet back in SC.  Other than that, they all were underwhelming and even dangerous to my animals (I have been through 4 vets already for my ferrets, and am currently about to switch again).  I know the economy is bad, and everyone has to make a living, but that is NO excuse for subpar care, especially when the price is outrageous (I guess they haven't realized that if they're doing a crappy job that they should at least discount it..or give me what my money pays for by retraining and actually paying attention this time around).    Sorry for the rant :)|`|05805cd7f8ba800b6b1e4c9525a624bcaa	The vet I have no NO WAY but she is the only vet in town. I am checking out the vets around me because she is clearly all about the money.    The vet I had before I moved here absolutely I knew that he put my animals first.|`|nCXmkZT6aa	http://ihateliz.com/?id=eewr2259wq3mtjq7...|`|KqZhJpZ0aa	No, My Vet is a total gniognbwiubn    My GSP (a Puffer fish) jumped out the tank, dog ate him took him to the vet she said ooh its not that he;d be dead!    SHe couldn't comprehend that puffers have Extremly little poisen when raised in a home Aquira (As wild puffers get there toxins from the wild)    After arguing, I left.    she charged me 99.18$.    Vets are worse then Peta IMO.
tkoUP87baa	If you're wanting it to get along with both the dog and the other cat, I'd suggest a very young kitten. Not sure if it will work with the other cat you have now, but maybe it will bring out a "Motherly instinct" in her. A younger cat (kitten) will take more easily to a dog. Once a cat is up in age they become set in their ways.|`|b5b08a7f14d2315049ad9f67246d2a56aa	get a male kitten, they are usually friendlier with other animals than female cats|`|jeT90Wznaa	Hm...I don't really know any specific cat breeds that are playful but you can go to catchannel.com/breeds and they have the cat breeds any info on them.I like personally Siamese but that is up to you.Oh and I would probably get a male because female and male always seem to get along better but again that is your choice...hope this helped|`|EPo7N1xBaa	Get a blue russian male and neuter him. They're awesome friendly, playful.
YnCUyvK7aa	Your fish has Columnaris by your description.  Skip the melafix and Primafix and get a real antibiotic to treat this.  Melafix and Primafix are okay as preventatives, but this is a more serious infection.    I put 2 links about treating this below for you.  Major pointa are keep the temperature around 74-75 degrees F, and keep up good oxygenation, maybe even add an airstone if you have 1.  And use an antibiotic, nitrofurazone is 1 of the top choices.|`|qEp9fxU9aa	I have Primafix and Melafix large bottles and they are worthless.  Pay very careful attention to exactly what is wrong with your fish and get some medication to treat it properly.  Go to the LOCAL Fish Store that specializes in fish, not the big box or puppy mill, and talk to the owner though do not waste your money on the ***fix, like most fish medications they do not work.
uo2sGuvWaa	Temperature normally is a big reason they stop eating and since it is winter and the temperatures have dropped make sure the temperatures in the tank are not to cold (cool side 80-85F and hot spot of 90-95F). Also if you have a heat light I would suggest geting a heat pad instead, snakes like belly heat rather then over head heating.     The best thing to do if you can't keep it is give it to a rescue group, They will make sure it find a good home. You can find list of rescues around the US here.    http://www.anapsid.org/societies/|`|qt8yoRNzaa	I'm not sure how to fix it, but i do know WHY.     ball pythons always put themselves through these 'phases' of not eating. It's not certain why, but it could have something to do with where he's from. If he's wild-bred or wild caught, then try live mice.     I also suggest you bring him to a herp. vet asap, he can tell you how to help him start eating.    hope this helps|`|6j9EZXGWaa	Place an ad in the pets section of your local newspaper and explain your details and wishes.|`|e0VJdx6Laa	during the winter if your snake stops eating it is because it's in hibernation. this could go on for months. but don't stop handling it or anything and still try to feed it every 1-2 weeks (depending on when you used to feed it)  and when you leave in august then ball pythons can go for months without food. so the only problem is water. depending on how long you're leaving for you could just hire your neighbor to come fill the water every few days but besides that the snake willl be fine.
Z3OTphZhaa	Most westies as well as cairn terriers or all terriers for that matter are known to be stubborn.  It takes a certain owner who will be persistent and providing it proper training that will ensure these dogs are trained properly.  If so, these dogs are one of the most loving, loyal, family oriented dogs in the world and highly intelligent.  I have owned Cairn Terriers for quite some time, but you must train these dogs and be consistent with their training.    I would also like to add I have owned many various breeds, but since owning my first Cairn (which are the same as Westies), I will never own another dog.  The fact that these dogs shed very little and are great family dogs is reason enough to not want another breed (at least for me).|`|tPGxPDvBaa	No - normally they are very outgoing & happy dogs.  Stubborn, tough, solid lil guys that can hold their own if they have to but are usually quite friendly.  I had one & specialized in terriers esp. westies for grooming.  That one was a poor quality unsocialized dog & certainly not  what westies are like.|`|9aJOQtw8aa	The other person comparing Westies to Cairns is only half right. My friend has a 2 or 3 yr old female Cairn. She is more calm towards people and basks in affection.    I have a male Westie. He is not quite 1 yet, but... He is  very hyper, a "showboat" (always hamming it up, wanting you to know he is around and to drop every and pay him some attention, now!)    He is the most needy and hard to train of any dog I have ever had. I have always had terriers or toy dogs. He is the most difficult to deal with. I would say that the prerequisites are having a terrier before and having experience with a hyperactive breed. Westies usually are not vicious unless around rude smaller children or someone attemtping to steal their food or belongings.|`|s2Voa2jMaa	NO NO NO ANY DOG EVEN PIT BULLS CAN BE NICER THAN ANY THING BUT IT'S THE OWNER THAT MAKES THEM THAT WAY IF YOU GET ONE HAVE THE DOG BE AROUND POEPLE ALOT AND THE DOG WILL BE REALLY NICE AND GO TO A PLACE AND GET A TERROIR FORM THE POUND OR SHELTER CUZ DOGS GET PUT DONE 24/7 FOR NO REASON =[ I HAVE A TERROIR BUT HE'S A MIX AND HE'S THE SIZE OF HALF MY ARM AND HIS MOM WAS A WHITE TERRIER LOL|`|HUAZ37araa	Most Westies are friendly to a fault. My Westie would lick a robber if she could! It's my Scottie that's more of the protector, but they're both excellent dogs. Just make sure you train it properly and introduce it to other people and safe, vaccinated dogs at a young age.
OaaJ7o9Haa	I have platies and although they do poop a lot, their bio-load isn't as high as it would seem, You'll just be facing much more when you vacuum your gravel. ^_^ For the most part, they are very clean and easy to keep.    Platies are generally peaceful and go well with most shrimp and snails if you wanted those. I have ghost shrimp who scavenge for uneaten food in my tank. Good algae eaters are amano shrimp. Good luck.|`|MPQI8Bg3aa	I have also noticed this about platys...though they do not seem to be as dirty of fish as you might expect. It seems like the just don't shake it off as well as other fish...
qEp9fxU9aa	I would personally go with 7 cardinal tetras and get rid of the rainbow shark.  This "shark" is actually a loach that will easily get over 1 foot.  If you don't have the DWARF bristlenose pleco then it's day's are numbered as well.|`|wD9sdGhZaa	I like pristellas.    Cardinals are beautiful but the pristella complements your existing fish better.

There are lots of rescues out there:    http://www.petfinder.com//index.html|`|tPGxPDvBaa	Try looking on Petfinder or any of the other adoption sites.  No dog is really inexpensive - there are plenty of costs involved.  Your best bet would be to adopt a short haired one. By adopting from a rescue you will get a dog that is full vetted & fixed far cheaper that you could have done..  Long hair dogs require regular grooming appt & care which is not cheap.|`|CDBRXtnLaa	go adopt one because once at the S.P.C.A  i saw pamerainian but i passed the chance and got a german shepherd i knwo pamerainians are pampered pooches but i would rather have a fun dog|`|AA10691226	When you go to the pound or shelter for a small dog for your mom, make sure it is already fully grown. Never trust that a puppy will not grow too much; my neighbor did that and she was totally unhappy when the cute little puppy turned into a medium-sized dog. I adopted the dog from her, but her daughter was already attached and they took the doggie back ;-(    However, I still see him a lot. Save yourself all this drama and get a fully-grown dog in the first place so that it's all okay.    Good luck!|`|Bw18seFqaa	try shelter or rescue www.petfinder.com|`|ucxBvsX6aa	I think you should adopt.  There are thousands of small dogs, big dogs, cute dogs lots of dogs need adopted. And you should.  Don't buy from a breeder.  Go to a local animal shelter and help out a dog or puppy thats in need!  It's the best way!|`|0SBThBlaaa	just go to the spca and look around until you find one you think is the right one.  all dogs at the spca are 75 dollars|`|HUAZ37araa	This depends on your definition of small.....    I have a Westie, and she's the best! Most Westies are even-tempered and very affectionate, and they have longer hair so they don't really shed. They are absolutely precious as puppies and still adorable as adults. Great dogs for older people!
xGmbEzOZaa	Is this the first time that your cockatiels have laid eggs? Sometimes it takes a while for a pair of birds to learn how to do things correctly. If your birds have eggs, don't inspect them. This may disturb the birds and discourage them from incubating their eggs. Just let nature take its course.    The embryos in the eggs may still be alive, but the parents must not let them cool for an extended period of time. Otherwise, the embryos will die.    Regarding diet, try offering some sprouted seeds. Take some of your birds' seed, soak it overnight in warm water (with a drop of apple cider vinegar added to prevent bacterial growth), drain the water, and allow the seeds to germinate in a warm place. Feed once the sprouts are noticeable. Most birds love sprouted seeds, which is great because they're highly nutritious. Also, cockatiels aren't really that keen on eating fruit, however, many do enjoy eating dark leafy greens, such as kale and spinach. Try offering them on cage clips to encourage your birds to eat something new.|`|Yu7y6yfraa	As long as the eggs are not too cold, they should make it.  You might get a broad Spectrum light to put on their cage during the day. This will help keep the birds and eggs warm as well as provide Vitamin D that will help them metabolize Calcium which is extremely important at this time.    Make sure they have a cuttle bone.  Eating all seeds can be a problem.  That is not a balanced diet.  If you could get them to eat pellets that would be ideal.  Sprinkle vitamin power over their food.  Offer them boiled eggs with the shell.    When laying, Calcium is extremely important for the female parent because she uses it to make eggs.|`|AA11073914	I'm not sure. But here is some info on Cockatiels|`|yn78m2yAaa	Hi.    If the cockatiels are incubating the eggs most of the day and all night, then they should be fine. Usually the hen and cock take turns in incubating while the other eats. If they neglect the eggs overnight than their is not much hope of the eggs hatching.    You can buy calcivet from vetafarm or avi-cal from most pet shops. You then add this into their water and it will supply the parents and the chicks with plenty of calcium.    You can get vitamin and mineral supplements that you add to their water which will give them the same benefits as vegetables do.
MstjbpVJaa	Birds have this natural habit of shedding feathers when caught,it is part of their defence mechanism,grab the bird and you could be left with a hand full.  Don't worry they will grow back,but your bird may be upset with you for a while.  Use a net next time.|`|JMZkaf1jaa	What feather came out?  Was it a wing feather or a tail feather?  is he still able to balance himself?  Do you see blood near where the feather came out?  It is probably nothing to worry about unless you see any blood as they do have what is called blood feathers.  Remember when you handle him never hold your hand on his underneath side as that is where their lungs are located.  If you don't like using a net, try using a very light weight cotton towel (like a flour sack thin) to catch him.  Also, handle him very gently as their bones are not like ours.  Their bones are filled with air and break easily.  As for the biting, that is one of his ways he tells you he is hurt or scared.  Once you have had him for a while, he may just squawk really loud at you. Hope this helps you.

Boy, was I wrong.  I tried many saddles of that description with no luck.    I finally ended up with my perfect saddle.  I now event in an older model of the Pessoa A/O.  It puts me in the perfect position.  It has also made me realize that less is more.  A deep seat and huge knee rolls aren't always the right answer.      I'm not sure if you'll be able to find the A/O in an 18.5" seat, but I recommend checking local consignment tack shops, and even ebay.  You might be surprised at what you find!    Good luck!  Shopping for saddles can be tiring, so I feel your pain.|`|IVbwUy9Xaa	OHMYGOD!!   I am soo happy you asked this! Here is my saddle life experience:  When I bought my first Pessoa, I was DEEPLY dissapointed. It was nothing compared to the descriptions.

THANKIES :D|`|RAPeNncwaa	goOglE hAs eveRythaNg|`|lu4ufhm5aa	pessoa, crosby or if you want something less expensive HDR. Check around for prices or a place that will let you take the saddle home and try it out like Mary's Tack and Feed in Del Mar, California|`|Gc94X8Cjaa	I have a Courbette Husar that I use for mountain riding.  We go up and down and all around, I love it.  It's pretty secure, but I don't feel at all like I'm forced into one position.  I think Courbette and Stubben do make saddles in larger sizes, they are both good makers.  You might also want to try a local tack show that sells on consignment; they often have custom saddles at much lower prices!    Oh, Passier makes an eventing saddle, and it seems quite nice.  Good luck!|`|7Y8DCpRWaa	I use an Antares and my leg is solid. Paramount are quite wonderful as well, custom so you can have the flap made to you.

Mine is my favorite saddle ever and the one that cost the least! I have the premia--which is there eventing saddle. SO COMFY. Btw--if you ride in a saddle that is too big for you its going to screw up your position, it might make you feel better but it is going to affect the balance of you and your horse. I have a similar problem with stirrup leathers since one of my legs is longer i ride with one stirrup leather longer and while they feel even to me, they aren't actually and i feel so uncomfortable w/ them at the correct length but if i kept them my way i would be unbalancing my horse. Think about it b/c it will hurt yours and your horses performance|`|CoAc5hS9aa	I have had both eventing and close contact jumping saddles.    One of my first saddles was the newer Collegiate Senior Event saddle and I loved it. I was a dressage rider just learning how to jump and that saddle taught me how to jump with a longer leg (which is what I like). I would show both jumping and dressage in my saddle. I also did 3 eventing trials and this saddle worked perfectly for lower levels. It was fantastic for flatwork too!    My newest saddle is the HDR close contact with foam. I am in love with it. It is amazing for jumping. It is also a cheaper saddle yet is real well put together, ect.    A jumping saddle with a slightly larger seat..That isn't a good combo. I wouldn't suggest it. Especially if you are jumping higher.    Good luck finding a saddle!|`|yYGACHaQaa	hmmm i ride in a collegiate all purpose. i love itt. its so comfortable, like its soo soft. i event in it and its nice because the flaps are longer (but not too long my any means) so it looks nice for dressage if you don't use a dressage saddle. (cuz i don't).|`|cEerFO38aa	I personally love Antares saddles. They are custom fit to your needs, wants, and what your horse requires as well.    They always fit perfectly. The only down-side, is that they are not cheap, but it is money well spent. They last a long time, you can also buy used saddles. And, if the time comes when you require a new saddle, you can trade it in as a down-payment (or more) for your new saddle.
SsCwVJ1Gaa	okay, words on a screen aren't going to give you a feel for the lope which many hours of practice and training can give you , but I'll try to give you a picture which should help a little.     when the horse trots (sure you have done that a bunch) it's back travels almost straight up and down, and it is very bouncy if you try to sit still (especially when you first learn to trot) ...    When the horse lopes (or canters) the movement of the back is slightly forwards and down, and then backwards and upwards at the same time...  One way to think of this is to recall what happens when you rock onto the back legs of a chair and rock back and forth.. (try not to fall over backwards, it hurts!!), it's more like that than anything, going back and forth, and following the movement of the horse.    BUT.. if you start to get nervous, you'll unintentionally start gripping on to the saddle with your knees, which will make you come up out of the saddle, and give you a poor seat. You need to RELAX your leg, and allow your lower leg to naturally wrap itself around the lower half of your horse, which will give you more stability (lots of trot and walk work without stirrups helps this one)     If you imagine that your horses sides are like a big round rock... and that you want to pick that rock up... would you have any luck in trying to grab the top of the rock with both hands, or to try to hold it underneath?? The same thing is true with your leg...    I TRULY hope you get it down SOON, but the only certain way is MANY hours of practice...     you might want to tell mom that you want to wait for a while, or that you just want to practice .. Sure she'll understand...     Good luck with the canter... and have fun with your horse :)|`|FLBCvJuDaa	Stay to a slower speed until you know how to ride.|`|KyHiCSKeaa	One thing that helped me a lot was to wait on the horse's rhythm (I would always try to set my own rhythm and never be with the horse).  Just wait until you get a feel for it, and don't over-exaggerate your motions.|`|wxFK2IpAaa	so you ride western? It's all in practice so the isn't anything you can do overnight. just relax otherwise you will look stiff in the saddle. she shouldn't be upset with you if your not as good as her though. good luck|`|wYBU1B1qaa	Keep a deep and balanced seat...this takes practice.  First, relax in the saddle. Sometimes people carry the tension in their legs and try to hold on with them.  Sit firmly in the saddle, sit up straight and relax.  My legs are pretty much limp (I think...I've never paid much attention ;)  Maybe good to just lope slowly until you ge the feel for it.  Have fun and good luck!|`|CsefdZ0Gaa	PRACTICE, PRACTICE, PRACTICE    and it's even better to practice in a round pen if you have one that way your horse is more likely to maintain the same speed and not take off on you.     Do you have a good seat trotting yet? If you don't, then don't jump ahead to loping until you can hold your seat at a trot which is much more difficult to master than at a lope.|`|HRc3rWrQaa	Obviously, this is not something that can be developed overnight, but getting a good, solid seat takes time and practice.  One of the best things that you can try to do is ride bareback a few hours per week.  I found that this worked the fastest for me.  It's all about getting good balance, and this is really a good exercise to do for that.  you can start with someone leading you, if you need to.  Pretty soon you'll find that you feel comfortable enough to move on to a faster pace.  When you are ion the saddle, you will feel more confident an better balanced.

Put up flyers but only use your email address until they can describe the dog.  Contact animal control and report a found dog in case someone calls in looking for it.  Put flyers up there also.  Put flyers up at the local vets office.    Call animal control to see if someone has reported it lost.  Look for flyers or adds in the paper.  Check with the vets to see if any reported it.      You must make every effort to find the true owner.  Just think if your dog was missing and someone just decided to keep it.    BTW.  Very cute.  looks like a terrier mix.|`|DYxb7P3Baa	you should really put up flyers for it. just give them your phone number should be okay, no need for address . and if you want to confirm to see if thats their dog, you can ask them some questions about the dog like , whats her name ? what does she like to eat? and stuff and then try it with the dog, and if it works, then most likely its the person that called.    it looks like a jack russell terrier mix. or a parson russell terrier mix. and she looks about 3-6 years old ?|`|b5jI4ZMmaa	i would keep it and feed it and take care of it until you find the owner and still put up flyers and everything and put it on the internet about lost dogs and then if you cant find the owner keep it

IuYekkPVaa	Cats and dogs think of prolonged staring as a direct challenge or threat.  To break up the tension and show other animals that they mean no harm, they blink their eyes and look away.  It's a bit like smiling at someone to show that you are friendly and non-threatening.    You can read more about this and other cat body language in the article below.    http://www.messybeast.com/cat_talk2.htm|`|JgTNtT9Uaa	If a dog winks at you it means that they are please you are their owner and master.   If a cat winks at you, they are just trying to encourage you to wink back so they can find out which eye is your favorite. They need to know this, so that when they next want feeding at 3am, they can poke their tiny, razor sharp claws into your favorite eye. You will then feed them :o)  Had cats all my life, they are lovely, but do not ever under estimate their intelligence!  Vik|`|AA10458195	It's saying, Oh you silly human if you only knew what I am thinking.|`|2Cv1yWGWaa	that's because that is how they blink.  One eye at a time ;)|`|iSejBxZJaa	Wink back, it shows affection to the animal.    I could mean anything, but I believe it's showing respect to you.|`|Emk4xuTuaa	I wink back at my cat, if it's one eye or both, with both I think she is telling me she Loves me, but when it's just one eye, I think she is letting me know that whatever I do is okay with her.|`|aqY13vWNaa	Nothing, it's an accident. My dog does it all the time.|`|1KHQdmzzaa	I always wink back! I think that secretly dogs & cats can understand you and sometimes they wink like "yea i can understand im just not going to admit it"     always wink back!|`|KHQqkIb2aa	I heard somewhere that that is how cats and dogs say i love you    I know it sounds stupid :)|`|M8X0dIOZaa	ha ha! well, of course you can wink back but it doesn't really mean anything to them. Winking is not part of animal culture. I've seen my cat wink just because he got some dust in his eye.|`|3Kk78kiJaa	its nothin important......they do that all the tim.....it may b dust or they r just sleepy my dogs do it al the tim......but just 4 the fun of it wink bac :) lol!|`|VnCVkHDhaa	THE TRUTH ON WHAT THEY ARE SAYING    "hey, ive got something in my eye, now could you come and help me get it out with those posable thumbs you've been rubbing in my face"|`|rmLrVrAHaa	If they wink with both eyes at the same time it means " I Love You". Thats how cats communicate.. with body language.
Eyawiwc5aa	Fruit is like a treat you dont want to offer fruit daily ... fruit is like junk food to them ... if you offer fruits theyll pick fruits over the staple good greens they should have.  Lettuce like most lettuce us humans eat don't provide much nutrience for igs.  Since he/she is a young ig they usually don't eat much ... try offering different sizes of greens, sometimes almost into a slush form ... you'll feel like your wasting more food then he/she is eating but that will change after awhile ... also try a plastic lid instead of a bowl.  Also try offering in the morning 30min-1hr after lights/UVB is turned on, afternoon if you can, 3-5pm, and then 30mins before lights get turned off, sometimes the young igs will eat when us "humans" are sleeping.    Food:  Daily food should have 5-7 good staple greens (2-3 cups a day if not more younger igs may eat less then 1/4 cup) ... collard greens, mustard greens, turnip greens, dandelion greens (if you can find), endive, radicchio, arugula, mache (if you can find), watercress ... some greens to give occasionally kale, bok choy, escarole ... adding basil for young igs sometimes helps them eat ... romaine is mostly water no nutrience, you can add small amount and occasionally in w/ the good staple greens (collard, mustard, etc) but do not make romaine just your iguanas choice of greens (or any other type of lettuce most of us humans eat) ... some things to add (small amounts) snap peas, bell peppers (every now and then), parsnip, sweet potato/yam, acorn squash, butternut squash, buttercup squash ... fruits should only be given every now and then once or twice a week type of thing fruits are like junk food to iguanas ... some fruits to try papay, kiwi, mango, raspberries, strawberries, grapes, honeydew (great water source), canalope (great water source), 12 grain wheat bread ... if anything has seeds make sure you remove seed before you give it to your iguana anything w/ small seeds like strawberries wait like 3 days before giving anymore ... watermelon (seedless) can be frozen and then shaved onto your iguanas food helps w/ hydration everyday ... there are some foods that aren't good for your iguana: spinach has oxalate acids bind to the calcium, so even though spinach is high in calcium, almost none is actually available for the iguana to use, also the oxalate acids can form oxalate crystals which can and do build up in the kidneys causing kidney damage/failure ... some ig owners do give there ig spinach but in very small amounts and only once a month ... corn igs can not digest ... carrots can block calcium absorption ... bananas are low in calcium best to give another type of fruit ... apples too much acid - appetite suppressant ... rhubarb is poisonous ... food should be cut/chopped/diced no bigger then the iguanas head, if they are small having a chopper chop them up, or slice them into very small pieces ... spray/mist food to help w/ water/hydration    Sites for you to read:  http://www.greenigsociety.org/ - http://www.iguanaden.org/ - http://www.anapsid.org/iguana/index.html  A great book to read and have on hand:  Iguanas for Dummies by Melissa Kaplan  Yahoo has some great sites for Iguana owners... these groups helped me and still help w/ questions .. if you'd like to join:  http://pets.groups.yahoo.com/group/BabyI... - http://pets.groups.yahoo.com/group/Iguan...|`|nmzpdvkqaa	well not much to say the first two answers pretty much covered it.|`|nI8G21y8aa	I have a 5 foot iguana. they need calcium so cut up broccoli. keep as natural as possable. if your ig wil eat the food that you can get at the petstores then thats fine. But mine wont eat that.     Lettus, strawberrise, red bell peppers, lettus,lettus,lettus    and anyting elsethat is red. THINK RED!!!    but remember t go easy on the fruit, it is important that s/he eats that, remember that they do need calcium.    their food needs to be very well cut up.   a healthy iguana should be eating all of the time, and shedding all the time also.|`|1kk1Bqf6aa	First of all be careful exactly what lettuce you feed. Iceberg has little or nutrients. Green leaf lettuce as well as Romaine should suffice. Dandelion, mustard, collard, and turnip greens are great staple items and should be fed more often than any lettuce. Do not feed kale very often if at all and never spinach.     Other good vegetabls include carrots (must be very finely sliced)  peas (mush them for babys)  Squash is also a good item to feed.    As far as fruit goes berrys and apples are good. Banana is ok in small amounts. Fruit should make up no more than 10 percent of daily food intake.     Make sure to dust salads with calcium daily and a multivitamin every other day.     Never, EVER! feed an iguana any kind of meat-crickets, worms, or dog/cat food.|`|9yXp7ap8aa	A high percentage of the iguana diet should consist of dark green, leafy vegetables. Eighty to ninety percent of the diet should be chosen from collard greens, turnip greens, mustard greens, bok choy, Swiss chard, clover, red or green cabbage, watercress, savoy, kohlrabi, dandelions, escarole, parsley and alfalfa pellets. Beet greens and spinach contain oxalates that may bind dietary calcium should be offered only occasionally. The same goes for kale, Brussels sprouts, broccoli, cabbage and cauliflower because these bind iodine and may cause thyroid problems. It is best to provide variety to the iguana's diet to prevent any nutritional deficiencies or excesses. The darker, outer leaves of most vegetables are more nutritious than the more pale, inner leaves. Iceberg, romaine, butter and Boston lettuces are all poor nutritionally, and should be fed sparingly, if at all.    Ten to fifteen percent of the diet should be chosen from frozen mixed vegetables (which are great to feed on those busy mornings), squash, sprouts, carrots, cooked sweet potato, cucumber, okra, parsnips, spineless cactus pads, asparagus, mushrooms, green and red peppers, peas, beans, corn and green beans. Backyard weeds and grasses can be offered as forage. Fruit should make up the remainder of the diet. Fruits are usually preferentially consumed, but most are mineral-poor. Figs are one of the only fruits high in calcium, and these, along with apricots and dates, may be relished.    Canned or dry commercial iguana diets can be offered on days when you don't have time to prepare the daily smorgasbord. Occasionally, they can be used as the entire daily diet, but it is better to combine them with some fresh food.    As treats, hibiscus flowers and leaves, rose petals, geranium flowers nasturtiums, carnations and dandelions can be fed. Life food is not necessary. Some iguanas relish crickets, mealworms and pinky mice, but these sources of animal protein are poor dietary items and should not be fed at all.    Some iguanas develop serious food preferences, so it is important that they consume at least ten different food items regularly, to avoid nutritional problems. It is a good idea to try to prevent iguanas from developing bad dietary habits, which may be difficult to break.

A great small dog is a chinese crested, they are not hyper and are very smart.   There is a good rescue named Crest Care and I know a great breeder out of Nevada (if your interested)   I own 4 of them I show them and breed them(no I am not the breeder) I will not be breeding again for a few years.  There is the non-coated and the coated type both are great dogs. The powder puff is good for people with allergies and they are non shed of course so is the hairless ones: 0  They aregreat with kids, my 6 yr old son and 8 yr old daughter helped raise our litters of puppies and all my dogs love the kids the ysleep with the kids instead of me!|`|mEzVgC7Kaa	Daschunds. They are good. Look them up, they are good with elderly and children.|`|3zFda3KUaa	Easiest to train, hands down, is the miniature poodle. NOT a toy poodle. Several of the breeds mentioned may be to small and fragile for younger or rambunctious children. Poodles, and doodles who act more poodley than labrador (or golden retriever) are often just not silly or "doggy" enough for some kids. Standards and miniatures are wonderful, intelligent dogs, though!  She is planning to do more research, I hope.    I find that sporting breeds are often best with children. They will tolerate rough-housing, endless games of fetch, running, hiking, etc. But a calm temperament is important. My goldens and pointers have tolerated ear and tail-pulling (the kids were told to stop, BTW), but not all will. A lot of sporting breeds will need exercise (pointers more than goldens, for example).     I would generally recommend a dog at least 25 lbs for kids, especially younger kids.    Questions to ask:  1) How much exercise can I reasonably provide?  2) Do I understand the lifespan of a large vs. medium vs. small dog?  3) Who will be the dog's main caretaker?  4) Will the dog have access to a secure fenced yard or will walks be the only form of exercise?  5) Is my family committed to having a dog as a companion or do we just want a play thing or an accessory.  6) Does anyone in the household have allergies or asthma? These will narrow your breed choices.  7) Will I go to puppy or dog obedience classes and read or watch DVDs about raising a dog? This is very important, especially for first-time dog owners.    Once these questions have been answered:  1) For ease of training and housebreaking, find a list of the top 20 to 30 breeds ranked by intelligence or ease of training. Some breeds are much more difficult to housebreak, especially if one owner cannot stay home with the doggie.  2) Don't look at a list of the top popular dogs!  3) If you have time, meet some dogs in these breeds. At dog shows, obedience shows, pet shops, parks, etc.  4) Look at the qualities and temperment wanted in the new family member. You obviously don't want a hyperactive dog, so some breeds are less likely choices. Some breeds are calmer. Some breeds can be more aggressive. Do you want an affectionate dog?  Some breeds prefer to bond with one owner, not a whole family. Some breeds need less exercise. Some like to fetch, some don't. Some like to swim, some don't. Etc.  5) Avoid backyard breeders.  6) If the family wants to adopt, try a breed-specific shelter that fosters dogs or mixes. A foster family can tell you if the dog is nervous, bites, likes or hates kids, is calm, gets along with cats, etc. Much safer than a dog at the pound who hasn't been fostered in a home environment.  7) Alternately, find a good breeder, through the local breed society or a trusted veterinarian. Explain that you want a pet quality dog for a family. They're less expensive than a breeding quality puppy. Don't pick the shy, submissive puppy or the absolutely fearless puppy unless you know how to handle these issues!
1ee4b7220aeca83771af47b43e1e4624aa	Dogs in the same household generally get along if raised together properly.

So increase his exercise (two good walks a day should do it) and start obedience training. Teach him how to sit whenever you touch the doorknob and have him stay while you open the door on up until you close the door. If you know someone is coming over, have him on a leash.|`|dCF1UBUsaa	Watch The Dog Whisperer. It has some great advice that works.

Keeping him on a long line when in the house would be handy so if he does make a run for it you can get him back in no time. Also a whistle might be a better way of getting him to respond to you rather than your voice as they soon learn when we are angry with them and no dog wants to come back to a upset person.

Remember, preventing something worse would be better than a vet fee now. You would not want him to be unable to walk in the future, etc.     Bassets seem to be predisposed to gain weight easily.

WJAM199Waa	Cat bites can be very dangerous.  There are several things a cat can transmit to you via a bite. I'm not saying this to scare you, just to let you know you need to keep a very good eye on this.    No soaking, etc.  The antibiotic is all you need.  Take ALL the pills and try hard not to miss a dose and try to take at the same time every day.    I got bit VERY badly. Yes, I got a tetanus shot (you didn't need another one after only 2 years.) Was also given antibiotics. I remember him being VERY serious and said if it doesn't improve in 2 or 3 days to get to a dr. right away.  It doesn't have to be all better in that time, it just has to be improving.  If it gets worse, see a Dr. at a walk in clinic or emergency or whatever method you have to see someone right away.  That is it. Take the pills, take them at the same time every day, take them ALL and watch it very closely.|`|w1lh1INHaa	Soak in warm epsom salts, then a little peroxide, then a little neosporin or other healing ointment.  Put a bandage over it to keep it clean.  One of the best ways to keep infection out is to smear a little soap and sprinkle with salt on the bandage as this helps draw out any infection and keeps the wound from scabbing until all the infection is out.    I've had lots of cat bites over my many years of cat ownership -- some worse than others -- and if you keep it clean, all will be well.|`|DXzI2jrEaa	Just follow whatever directions the doctor gave you for at home care. Don't soak it unless the doctor told you to do so.

iiNAJfGCaa	I grew up in Maine and always owned horses there. It is a wonderful state because there is actually quite a large horse community (big in 4-H, Pony Club, eventing, trail riding, and driving - there is virtually NO hunters/jumpers, no rated shows, and not a lot of western/gaming) and land is relatively inexpensive compared to other states. The biggest downside is the weather - there is often snow there 7 months out of the year and unless you have an indoor, riding during the winter is usually out of the question. I have never lived in New Hampshire but I would assume it is basically the same... Maybe a little shorter winter, but the real estate is more expensive.|`|RUxRNsf4aa	Those two states arent really far apart enough to make a difference. No offense. But i guess new hampshire because it is slightly farther south and the warmer the better! Both have just about the same job outlook/ weather.|`|CsefdZ0Gaa	Neither one.    First, it's too darn cold to do anything in the winter but freeze your butt off.    I would say it's best to have horses in the South somewhere because at least then you can ride all year around and don't have to shovel snow AND poop|`|rTSwouqXaa	Neither! Northern Nevada, Northern Arizona, Idaho, Montana Wyoming! Now that's horse country! Miles and miles and miles of land that no one owns, with mountains rearing up to the sky. It's a MANS country its horse country, in other words. The more people.....the less beauty!

Stay away from veggies that are high in sugar and limit fruits to only about 3 x's per week. Read over the sample menus, they are really great!|`|bEQn0Vrtaa	of the foods not listed my guineas loved fresh tree ripened peaches, just absolutely loved them.

(someone suggested Alfalfa, but that is mainly for babies and pregnant guinea pigs)    My piggies LOVE a little but of cantaloupe every now and then.    Dandelion, mustard and Collard greens are great for everyday veggies and piggies live them.     Also, ever once in a while you can give them some strawberry (without the leaves).  It's usually best to do this before giving them floor time, as it makes them VERY hyper ^-^    peppers are great (especially red peppers since they have a lot of vit C)    Broccoli is also a great treat.

7bbfUYUOaa	It really depends on what kind of tropical fish you have, how stocked your tank is (more fish = more changes), and basically what you want to do.  There really aren't any hard and fast rules, which is why you find so much variation on the internet.  I find that a 10-25% water change (with a gravel vacuum) once a week is sufficient for keeping your tank fairly clean.|`|JvTF7UrMaa	dont do what he sed and do a water change weekly that can kill off most bacteria although if your tank is extremely stocked you may have to but if you only have a few fish it may be beacuse they are kicking up the dust from storage if its a new tank or maby its just time for a clean i do myne once every 3-4 weeks around a 30%-50% water change and myne is nice and clear or try turning your filter system up a little hope it goes well love me x|`|00RgkZF8aa	You should be doing 10-25% water changers each week.|`|8wnvhBQTaa	I have a 330litre fish tank the filter was changed about 4 months ago and before that 6 months & the water was changed about 1 month ago but only because it was moved and before that same time as filter 4 months ago I do not use any safe water etc, my fish are thriving.  I think the current advice is change water every 4 weeks.|`|aDeDOmxBaa	Ok some thoughts as i agree that there is conflicting information, sometimes its a bit trial and error depending on your water parameters.    * test your water to see where you are and if you have an issue you know you need to take action  * if the water is fine then generally a weekly water change is recommended but no more than 40% maximum, 10-25% in an established aquarium. taking out too much water can upset the balance in there  * always use a gravel siphon to clean the gravel as this is where the detrius and food settles rotting into the water   * always use a water dechlorinator and a built in stress coat is good too. We know there is chlorine and chloramine in our water and we know this is toxic to fish so even if it looks fine why leave it to chance?  * get it ready the day before. I use a big bucket, a spare heater, whack it on overnight and hey presto in the moring nice heated declorinated water ready to pour in after a little siphoninh, no faffing about waiting for it to heat up.     hope this helps    Gem x|`|gYegDDuBaa	once a week change 25% because that's a good amount to change without changing to much water or to little|`|0vDLCa24aa	The smaller the tank the more frequent you must change it. The bigger the tank the better, but the bigger the longer you have to wait to cycle.
V7AAba8Laa	Even if it is hot during the day, it is often necessary to run a heat lamp at night when the temperature starts to drop.  A brood pen needs to be kept at about 98 degrees during the first week of a chick's life, dropping by about 2 degrees each week after, until the pen temp is equal to the outside temp, or until the birds have grown their secondary feathers.    New chicks are very succeptible to drafts, chilling and temperature fluctuations.  Their pen needs to be kept at a constant temperature or you risk killing them.  If it's 80 degrees outside, they may still need a heat lamp placed at a safe distance to give additional heat.  If the chicks were with their mother hen, they would still spend a considerable amount of time underneath her to keep warm.  Young chicks can't regulate their own body temperature well until their adult feathers have started to come in.      The easiest way to monitor your brood pen temp is to place a reptile thermometer at the bottom of the pen.  Check the temp regularly during the day - sunlight coming in through a window may be enough to alter the temp and possibly overheat your chicks.  You might need to shut the lamp off for part of the day, then turn it back on as the sun changes position, or even run it all night.    I'd recommend getting a 250 watt red brood lamp and a reptile thermometer before your chicks arrive.    Remember that your chicks need a CONSTANT temperature, and the only way to guarantee that is by using an outside heat source.    Good luck and enjoy your peeps!|`|rQlzfHqraa	You should always have a lamp just above their heads in a big area so they can go under the lamp or get away from it. Chicks will be peeping if they are cold, hot or hungry. Happy chicks will be sleeping quietly.|`|ehmeG65gaa	you should look up the temp. that these birds need to stay. if it's like 100 degrees and your room is 85 degrees then yes.|`|UPtvtm2Zaa	i want a chick can i have one!|`|zW5OWgXtaa	Well the first day you get them have it be around 100 degrees, then you can lower the degrees by 5 each week.

The texture of your dog's coat - and also how oily his coat gets - determines how often you should bathe your dog. Some breeds tend to have oilier skin and need to be bathed more often. Other breeds, who have thick double coats, need to be bathed less often. And your dog's habits matters too. If you have a dog that spends a lot of time outdoors rolling around in the dirt, then you'll have to bathe him more frequently. The most important thing is to use a shampoo that is specially formulated for dogs as human shampoo can be too harsh for your dog's skin.<br>  <br>  <br>  (I BATHE MY DOG EVERY WEEK) 1CE A WEEK....<br>  <br>  YOU SHOULD DO IT ONCE A MONTH...<br>  <br>  Go to the vet to see if your dog has fleas he probably will because you bathe him only once a year...|`|9adca7bf20beeeba7737370b35c823deaa	I bathe my dog whenever she needs it, usually if she's muddy or gets into something...generally anywhere from 3-4 times a year, as bathing her is an ordeal to be sure!|`|DISAaVVMaa	1ce a year deffinitly doesnt cut it!<br>  <br>  I have 3 dogs and i bathe them every week!

(You can counteract the ammonia smell with vinegar, if you like.  But it's not good for the soil.)    After my female Great Dane urinates in my yard, I immediately take a watering can to where she just was, and water the area very well.  Dog urine is really, really good for lawns, as long as it's not too concentrated.  By immediately diluting the urine with water, you prevent any burns, but make the nitrogen available to the grass.      I take very good care of my lawn.  Still, by the end of summer, I get patches of super-lush, darker green grass...those spots where my dog has urinated and I've diluted it.  My husband laments we can't find a way to have my dog urinate evenly over the entire lawn, so it could all be THAT lush and dark green.  (As it is, I make my own lawn fertilizer using ammonia, soda, dish soap, etc., as per some tried and tested recipes.  Works great!)|`|3bf821ff353c216ffc93ff7a91b60828aa	In the summertime, what I do is wash the yard.  I bought one of those plastic container attachments for the hose(screws onto the hose and you can use plant food or insecticides in it, it mixes with the water from the hose), fill it with a bit of dish soap and just spray it around the yard.  Probably make a big muddy mess though if it's all dirt.      I would be leery of any disinfectants or chemicals, they may react with the ammonia and can overwhelm you if you or the dog smells it.  I would probably get some vinegar and use that instead.|`|qTHUpqKTaa	runaway from it
k8F0n289aa	my guinea pigs were like that and died at 6 and  half years old.  they lived a long life  if he is in pain or discomfort   i think it is the best thing to do remember the good times.  if there is nothing wrong with him like just old then don't put him down.  if it is just him  then it would be unfair us to die alone and old.  i don't really know what to say =[  im sorry  xx|`|mhtAQt5Naa	They best thing is to take your guinea pig to a vet.

rLXNwqbFaa	1/4 to 1/3 pounds of feed a day|`|514EWQa0aa	ohhhhhhhhhhh i so want a chicken!  they're so CUTE :]    anyway, a laying hen will eat about 1/4 to 1/3 pounds of feed a day.    (and check out the website)
JNQpvWSpaa	Well I keep my chickens in the garden- they do have smelly poos. In some places you're not allowed to get roosters so check first. The roosters jump on the hen's back to mate. It's very quick and a rooster mates with lots of hens each spring. Ideal ratio is 10 hens to 1 rooster. Sometimes when you bend down to stroke a hen she opens her wings a bit and squats down- she thinks you are the rooster come to mate with her.|`|JsBb732Maa	No, it's over quick. The rooster jumps on the chickens back, a lot of squawking goes on and it's over.They will breed inside but chickens smell bad, they poop a lot and are pretty dirty. I might rethink having them as house pets.
339NqJ84aa	He could be terrified, If he was my GPiggie I would place his cage in a quiet place, away from house hold commotion & then leave him alone.

6KxBqnstaa	The way she is laying eggs she is going to become calcium deficient and then she will get very sick and weak and could die. Need to give her much calcium at this time via cuttle bones, crushed oyster shell, eggs boiled up with shell on and mashed very tiny. Just make up a spot for her and leave it. They hate nothing more than their area messed with while in breeding and laying mode. If she is breathing/panting hard and straining and not laying eggs she could be egg bound which can be deadly. Needs to see vet if this continues and she puffs up and strains, and stops eating. You can also increase the humidity in room she is in to help her pass the eggs easier.|`|DJa2wS86aa	not all ways they went taught like in the wild separate them and give her Carlson to replace the calson shes using right know its got to stop or she might die go to the birdchannel.com for more info|`|Tp4R14rlaa	You should have introduced them to their nest before being sexually mature.
AA10470681	Hi, Your Boston is just protecting his territory. I find that dogs make friends faster if you take them for a walk together. They're so happy that you took them out they will start to forget they were upset. So try that right away.  It may take some time because the status quo has been shaken up. With my terrier I always tell him to "be nice" when we meet a new dog. he knows what that means and he is rewarded with a good dog pat or a no scold. When I scold I say" NO, You be nice" since he knows what that command means he listens, Its important to be consistent. Hope this helps|`|1HLPznZhaa	He probably feels threatened ..I love all the "Hound " families .. They are usually a laid back live and let live bunch.. After they go through the sniffing routine they usually go back to where ever they were and resume what ever they were doing.. Your terrier is a little insecure .. He wants the new dog to know who he is .. When that new puppy gets his growth the terrier better hope the  the adult Mastiff forgets the greeting...|`|GoluIRIAaa	If they weren't just playing you need to slowly introduce them to eachother with short visits while they get to know eachother make sure you keep an eye on them and break them up and try to lightly discipline your dog if it starts getting aggressive. They should be fine with eachother after time.|`|85Y1yAu3aa	get ride of your dog if the one bites then put it donw i know i am a cold hasrtd ***** but that is ok|`|GSf09ALBaa	Whoa, your Boston Terrier is the Pack Leader in your house!  Yes, this certainly can be fixed but you need to enlist the help of a professional trainer.  The problem is your BT is alpha and he is proving his status by attacking the puppy.  You need to be the Alpha.  Trainer needed now.    I have 9 dogs and none of them are allowed to attack any other dog because the humans in this house are the alpha dogs.|`|tDUPkdgUaa	this is not good. defending his territory? no. hes a male. the English Mastiff is female. hes supposed to accept her being that she's female. heres what you do...    leave your Boston Terrier loose in the yard, bring you Sophie into the yard. carrying her, if you can, bring her butt-first to your Boston Terrier and let him sniff her butt. the problem might be that since she was overexcited about being in a new place with new dogs, he sensed that energy. and being that she already met your Basset and all was well, she felt the same with your Boston. she mightve gone up to him face-first and he probably took it as a threat. the best thing to do is dont let the Boston and Sophie meet face-first. thats confrontation and conflict. butt-first for one is the way to go. it sounds a bit odd, but its true. well, hope i helped!!    :]|`|D6SOmuc2aa	maybe there just playing.   if its obvious there not, then do something to keep them apart for a while until they get used to each other.
bEQn0Vrtaa	The thing with guineas is they can appear to be perfectly healthy and have URI. Just last week a young man wrote in that his two had been doing everything yours are ding and he lost one of his because he did not get to the vet in time. If money is not the issue for your own sake i would have them seen by a vet before you lose one.Well baby checks are not all hat expensive, and if it s an allergy maybe the vet will have a better idea as to what is going on so they can be more comfortable.|`|FWlSFpByaa	Sometimes they just sneeze. I had a 10 year old guniea pig that died recently and she sneezes every now and then.

rrFbQZzIaa	ball python covered most of it. 4-5 is way to little for a baby dragon. When you have a baby that was recently hatched, you will feed it pinhead to 1/8 of an inch crickets and they will eat 20 to 60 a day. As they get older, their cricket intake will go down. I try not to give my adults many crickets, 12-15 3x's a week as it is better for them to rely on greens and vegetables as the staple of their diet. Juvi's will eat around 20 3 or 4 x's a week as well as salads. Here is a link for a list of appropriate salad food: http://www.blackninjakitty.com/herps/car...  Fruit is fine to give a dragon but as a treat. As said, greens and vegetables are what you will mainly offer, you will just want to sprinkle a little fruit on the salad from time to time.   There is no different between buying a juvi or a baby, just that the juvi may be a little more hardy as it is older. It's really up to you and what you want. Just continue to do research on your own and if you have any questions that aren't answered from your research, come back here|`|NIPmV4uMaa	No, they need to eat much much much more than that. I'm not sure about babies, but adults eat at least 20 large crix a day, plus a bunch of worms and salads. Yes, they need salads, but fruit should be a rare treat, never something that is offered day-to-day. Some good staple salad greens are mustard greens, endive, or collards.  Follow this link for a helpuful food chart (bottom of the page):  http://www.beautifuldragons.503xtreme.co...  I suggest getting a juvie or adult, as babies are very fragile and can become sick or injured easily.      Beardies are really fun pets, but they require a LOT of daily maitenance. I spend a solid 2 hours caring for my one adult beardie; much more than that for babies, as they need to eat 3x a day instead of once a day. They also need multivitamin suppements and calcium supplements, both of which should have little to no vitamin A, phosphorous, or phosphate, they need a large variety of greens, a range of temperatures from 80-105ish (depending on age), multiple lights to give off light, heat, UVB and UVA radiation, and heat at night, and a multitude of other things.    All in all, if you want a beardie, you MUST read several books (online caresheets are ok, but the information in books is much more accurate). I spent 4 months researching before I got mine. I read around 30 caresheets, and 2 books; the first book I read cover-to-cover 6 times, the second 4 times.      Beardies require lots of attention, food, money (their enclosures must be big, and also expect to pay at least $20 per month on feeder insects), and time. If you decide a beardie isn't right for you, I also reccommend researching crested geckos and leopard geckos; they aren't quite as fun but require very little work.|`|QZ3eucYWaa	Babies, or juveniles eat alot more than adults.

ef831d986a5932fbeb4aaba747db2c77aa	If your putting out food, it's an invitation to all animals. We have possums that visit the outdoor cat dish. We even had a bear once come up to eat. The cats and the possums get along well together.

Second I am not glad to hear that you abused it the way you did. I am a rehabber and deal with these animals everyday and they are wonderful and do not deserve that. Where you feed one animal or stray you feed them all. I feed a few strays and have now had to put more out as I feed a skunk and a opossum as well as birds. All is fair in the wild. Put extra food out. You can also block the entrance you think the opossum is getting into. Can call a humane trapper or a wildlife rehabber in your area for help as well. The Opossum probably has a pouch full of babies in there. Which she needs much food for. They are not the smartest animals and they do not see good either.   Put a few things of cat food out or make the stray cat a little hut of his own or let on porch to eat so you know he has eaten for sure. Im sure he gets his share.|`|0X4UXIBvaa	DO NOT KILL IT!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! He is a living thing just like everyone else and don't torture or hurt it either! Violence is never the key!

The breed does happen to be the national dog of France, but there is actually nothing French about it. The breed originated in Germany, The name comes from the word Pudl ( Puddle, or water) which refers to the fact that they were and are actually water dogs and retrievers. The AKC recognizes three sizes, Standard (largest), Miniature ( medium) and Toy ( smallest). There is no recognized "Royal Standard' or "Teacup' these are simply breeders' terms for abnormally sized dogs which should not be bred, as they typically have many health issues. This is a wonderful, intelligent, highly energetic breed, that would be a great addition to any family that can handle the high energy needs and huge grooming tasks that the breed's coat requires. Thy are considered to be 'hypo-allergenic' or 'non shedding', not quite true, they do shed, but the hair ( they have hair and not fur) stays in the coat and forms matts, instead of falling out.For this reason , they are better for people who are allergic to dogs. To avoid the costs of professional grooming, it is very possible to learn to groom your own pet Poodle at home with excellent results and great saving of money. If you are considering getting a Poodle, I can recommend the breed  highly...we adore ours!!!! Check www.petfinder.com or local breed rescue groups to find yours!|`|Bs4BBJSPaa	there is no such thing as a french poodle there is only poodles that come in different sizes standard witch is the largest miniature the medium one then the toy the smallest that is recognized by the akc then there is an even smaller one the tea cup but it is not recognized by any dog origination that has shows when people think poodle they think french but the poodle is actually from germany they are water retrievers that's where the funny hair cuts came from its to there joints warm in cold water
6KxBqnstaa	I would get Professional help for the dog if possible. If not then I would muzzle the dog with humane muzzle when around any people.

When there is a lot of people my dog does not bark. he only barks when there is few people.|`|abwqrdtpaa	I got my dog when she was four months old from the pet shop. She was sweet, just like all dogs are, but we soon realized that she was far from being the perfect dog. She hated being alone, and to this day, she won't go into her crate. The thing is, some things that you need to teach your dog are more important than others. One of the main problems with your dog could be that he was six months when he left the shelter. It's harder to train an older dog, than it is a puppy, especially when you want them to adapt. What I recommend for the stranger problem is to distract your dog when you have guests. When they first arrive, show him his favorite toy and engage him in this playful activity. If he doesn't bark, give him a treat and praise him. If he does, you have to scold him. Another thing that you shouldn't do is put your dog in the garage for long periods of time. I used to do the same thing with my dog and it drove her crazy (I finally gave up that method when the neighbors started complaining). Buy a baby gate and isolate your dog from people, but let your dog feel like it's not alone. One more tip, I think it you be a good idea to neuter your dog. It doesn't hurt them, but it will help calm the animal down.
s9czxUbdaa	How long have you had them? They need time to adjust to their new homes and just like people it takes some longer than others. I would just work slowly with her. I have 3 and one of mine is 2-3 yrs old. He is a male and he still bites me on occasions.     They are just trying to be defensive and scare you. Have you actually been bitten yet? It really doesn't hurt all too much, there is just some shock. I would just urge you to take it slow so you do not over stress the baby.     Good Luck|`|W0jvhxoKaa	mine does the same exact thing, so what i usually do is put a small container in there and chase her into it. then i take it down to the floor, put a blanket over my lap and set her in it. she wont hiss or resist being handled because shes out of her environment. this will help tons  it did for me :)|`|CUFnorZyaa	Keep picking her up. Eventually she'll settle down and accept that you aren't trying to eat her.|`|N6NunLGVaa	she's trying to dominate you. she's trying to be dominate.

Take into consideration they are nocturnal, try to play with it later in the evening when it is awaka.
GZ0sh4pmaa	leopard geckos are not aggressive reptiles they will gladly run before they fight. in most cases they only bite if ur hurting them or if they feel cornered so keep ur palm flat and open dont close you hand on it. just move slowly u dont want to startle it. start by placing you hand in the cage very still let ur gecko get close and sniff ur hand maybe lick it (make sure hand are clean) then after doing that a few time move ur hand closer lightly touching it, then try holding. also when its frightened it may lose its tail so dont approach it with your hand from behind try head on or from the side. if it does bite it will feel like a slight pinch.|`|e944de21d2b8be3991f127b78c28319daa	If she's new, make sure you give her a few days or more to settle in to her new home.    Some baby leos are just brats.  If you were so small that virtually anything you see could eat you, you'd be a bit feisty too.  Honestly, a bite from a baby gecko doesn't hurt, it's more just the shock than anything.  Seriously, just let her bite you, and do your best not to jerk, because you could end up injuring her in the process.  It really doesn't hurt when they are babies.    Baby geckos can also be very fragile and VERY jumpy.  I strongly recommend holding her just a few inches above the cage floor at first, until you both get used to each other.  A baby can easily jump or accidentally fall out of your hand, and even a distance of a foot or two can be a hard fall for babies.  You can even start out just laying your hand flat, face-up on the cage floor and let her crawl over you.     Just take a couple strikes, calmly and patiently work with her a few minutes at a time, and she will calm down with age...    Good luck!|`|ZSWmOkE6aa	I you just got her she is probably just stressed out. Make sure that the temperatures and humidity are good, make sure that the tank is clean, and make sure that she has enough hiding spots. This will make her   feel safe and happy. Also, just leave her alone for a week or two so she can get used to the tank. After she gets used to her new home just be gentle with her when you pick her up and she will eventually feel comfortable with you holding her. Hope this helped!|`|u61yKsE3aa	I will take her time to be comfortable and trust you.  IN the mean time be And their bite doesn't hurt at all you might be less scared if you let her bite you and see it doesn't hurt|`|s9czxUbdaa	How long ago did you get her? Leo's need a min. of 2 weeks to get adjusted to their new home. I have 3 and had bought two of them together. They took 4 weeks before they were comfortable. I wouldn't rush it especially if you aren't comfortable yet.    My youngest leo is 11/2 yrs old and has never bit me, her mother is the same- but my male apollo on the other hand, has bit me several times. It doesn't hurt and has never broke the skin. He just has an attitude.    I would be ready for it as it is a lil shocking when it happens. I had them in my classroom for my children to see and my male bit me about 7 times as I was walking back to put him in his cage. That should let you know how little it hurts.     Good Luck!|`|W0jvhxoKaa	mine does the same exact thing, so what i usually do is put a small container in there and chase her into it. then i take it down to the floor, put a blanket over my lap and set her in it. she wont hiss or resist being handled because shes out of her environment. this will help tons  it did for me :)|`|MMQvVZ2Yaa	Well for one you said she is a baby.

They are scared at first. Trust me, bites do NOT hurt. Daily handling will tame it so you have to hold it. Don't be afraid. Like I said, bites do not hurt.

NgmuqcpXaa	I know this sounds weird but it could be. Some animals who are born in the wild and then brought into captivity can get really stressed from the change. They need to be surronded by familiar things. They might have had family and be scared by not knowing where they are. It might thinks its in danger|`|9759e8014743debd3d3fd1a7ad437c1faa	I have no idea. Dolphins have highly-evolved brains and they are considered very intelligent, but I don't know if they can have clinical depression.    Sometimes dolphins beach themselves, but there's no reason to think that they made a conscious decision to do so.
zakbXGK6aa	By enemies, do you mean 'predators', or other environmental problems?  Loss of habitat is the primary cause of painted bunting decline. Buntings rely heavily on grass seeds for food and nest in bushes, thickets and other scrubby places. Although they can coexist with some development, the intensive growth and urban sprawl that has taken place along the Southeastern coast in the past 35 years has permanently eliminated much bunting habitat. Outdoor house cats and nest predation by cowbirds are also a problem. There appears to be a delicate balance between a landscape with enough fields to support painted buntings, but with enough forest to keep predators and cowbirds at a low enough level to maintain high reproductive success.

tDUPkdgUaa	my Rat Terrier gave birth 3 times. its normal for the puppies to do that. idk why these people are always saying "ask your breeder mentor" cuz not everyone has access and contact with their breeder mentor. clearly if you asked the question here, its because you want somebody to answer you so you dont have to go through so much trouble.    it really isnt much to worry about. if you're really worried, go to a pet store and buy some puppy formula. but it isnt much to worry about. and you can always ask your vet for a special pill that can make her milk healthier. im not sure about pruducing more. you can always just increase her feeding rations because her food and water is what becomes the milk for the puppies when it processes.    really, dont worry about it. you're just stressing yourslef out by worrying. oh, and later on, your Pom is eventually going to start snapping at them. but, its just to teach them dominance. its not, to hurt them. they'll whine and whimper when she does it, because theyre asking her to stop. but she will never draw blood from them. she knows her limit to the puppies.    hope i helped!!    :]|`|DU0F48B3aa	First off this is normal  if you are concerned you need to get a scale ( postal like for weighing letters at the post office) and weigh them each day to make sure they are gaining and not loosing weight.  As far as feeding I feed dry puppy food for the extra nutrition and I give her goats milk 3 times a day. ( this is okay as it isn't a dairy product it can be gotten in cans at the grocery store or you can buy a powder form at a feed store.  Also my vet recommends worming mom and pups at 2,4,6,8 and 10 weeks old ( get the wormer at the vets only and let them know what age the pups are)  My vet also suggest starting vaccines at 6 weeks old  She and the pups should have been seen by a vet within 24-48 hours after birth to make sure the pups are healthy and eating good and make sure mom has delivered and passed everything. i f this hasn't been done yet and you are worried I would suggest getting them in as soon as possible.  Good Luck|`|4aN8AwmRaa	It's utterly amazing how people can spout off without even answering a question.      Puppies, any nursing animal really, will tug and pull on teats.  The behavior is quite normal.  The only way to determine if the Mom is producing enough milk is to watch the puppies, make sure they are thriving.  If all is good don't worry, Mom and puppies will be fine.  Mom will let the puppies know if she has had enough of the tugging and pulling.|`|ijLD9rZpaa	If the pups look healthy enough, they should be fine. If they aren't very rowdy, then you might want to take her to a vet. Most puppies push and tug on mommy's nipples. Very usual. If the puppies aren't playful, then something's wrong, but it sounds like their fine. Good luck!!|`|70878cc978ee2e4a79b3b53284340f9caa	It's normal for pups to nurse vigorously.If they are strong enough to push and shove,then they are most likely getting enough milk.You need to take both mom and pups to the vet to be checked out,  and feed the mother a good puppy food,dry and canned,plus cottage cheese and a dog vitamin,so that she gets enough calcium to prevent eclampsia,which is low blood calcium,and is very common in toy breeds about 2-3 weeks after giving birth ( Google it - eclampsia in dogs). The pups should nurse until they are 8 weeks,but they can be started on soft puppy food at 4 weeks,which will give the mom a break.After you have placed the pups,please get your dog spayed.Pregnancy is harder on them than you think,and there are thousands of Pomeranians dying in shelters and suffering in puppy mills as we sit here and type.|`|LGV9uiFLaa	Not to be rude or mean but please get her spayed!|`|zQdYBoSpaa	When my old dog had her 1st litter of puppies i rember they were always pulling at her and when she woul stand up they would still be hanging onto her. The puppies prolly dont have teeth and they are just trying to get out the milk. There is probably nothing wrong with your dog. The puppies are just getting used to getting milk and might not be very good at it yet so they try harder to get milk by tugging.|`|QPPKETiJaa	I'm sorry to hear some of the people on here are being so rude. That's why they have this questions and answers so people can learn. So anyway. I'm sure your new Mom is doing fine. From the way it sounds she and her pups are doing just as they should. Just always keep Puppy Chow available for her. It's also good to mix in can food with the dry. They love that. And she need to be eating at least twice as much as she did before. Always keep fresh water out for her. She need lots of food and water to keep her milk coming in. Also keep her bedding clean.Even tho she is keeping up with keeping the pups clean she may not want to stay in with them as long as she should if the bedding is not clean. Good luck to you and if you have any question just ask. I breed Rottweiler|`|AA11992723	it's hard for alot of people not to be mean or rude to people who breed without doing enough research prior to breeding. you would be called a BYB by most every reputable breeder and dog lover.    there's a reason dogs cost money, if it was easy with no complications and no risks to the dogs, well everyone would do it and then it would be free to get any dog dont you see?    please make sure this is her first and LAST litter. ask any breeder, they don't make a profit.    you really should call your vet for this question. someone on here could give you potentially harmful advice.|`|o93EwErKaa	The puppies' behavior does not seem abnormal.  If the dam is not producing enough milk, you will have puppies that are crying and not sleeping.  It is best to weigh the puppies twice a day and make sure they are gaining weight.    She should be being fed a puppy formula quality food (no corn, no wheat, no soy, no by-products and at a named meat in meal form, such as chicken meal as the first ingredient).    Fenugreek extract works well and fast (24 to 48 hours) to increase milk supply and is used in dogs and women.  You should be able to find it at a health food store.  Here is a link on it.    http://www.midwoof.com/store/lactation/f...|`|ZxGAKWHQaa	It's all good! Healthy puppies nurse very vigorously... the nursing itself stimulates increased milk production. Feed her a good, super premium dog or puppy food... as much as she wants to eat, and make sure that she has fresh water available always. You can offer spoonful of cottage cheese or a bit (no more than a bit or she will get loose stools!) of raw or cooked liver. If the puppies are not being adequately fed, they will cry miserably and not be content... if they nurse and then sleep, they are fine.|`|QVP8zSuWaa	What did your breeding mentor and vet say? If you don't want rude answers then don't breed when you are clueless.|`|cETQuE9waa	This is something you should be talking to the vet about.|`|ba8dd4c6a9b532bef579aff3e8706fe7aa	That's normal and helps to stimulate milk production.    It really would have been better to educate yourself before breeding.|`|Za8DpfvQaa	Ask your breeding mentor.    This is good advice. You should have one.|`|KxjUim7yaa	Feed her a good quality puppy food. Make sure that she looks good, as sometimes puppies can over nurse and deplete the mom of calcium. That would be an emergency. As long as the puppies remain active they are OK. It is if the are lethargic they need to go to the vets. At about 4 weeks when they get teeth, you can start some supplemental feeding.|`|RFfTjnxzaa	Ask your vet.
u61yKsE3aa	They are like comparing a garter snake and a ball python. They both snakes are tropical and arboreal but the greet tree snake is small and slender ussully not bigger  around than a pencil.  They can be finicky eaters need small prey(lizards etc).  And are a quick skitish snake.  Tree pythons are a python they get around 4 feet and wil ussually take mice.  The are not for begginers though.|`|AA10049109	Green tree snakes are colubrids, green tree pythons are pythons. Two completely different families of snake. Two different genus as well. The green tree snake is diurnal, meaning it's active during the day. Chondros are nocturnal. Hunting and moving about exclusively at night.  Green tree snakes eat just about anything including fish.  Chondros eat a variety as well, although I've not heard of them eating fish.  Usually frogs, lizards and small mammals. Occasionally birds, although it's rare.  The two look completely different as well-tree snakes being long and slender, chondros medium length and heavier bodied than the tree snake.|`|6j9EZXGWaa	Everything.

D1beU6MPaa	What kind of food are you feeding her? Make sure it is a food she likes and is healthy for her. Feed her once a day in the morning. Leave the bowl on the floor for thirty minutes and take it up. Do not feed her in the afternoon or evening. Feeding late in the day causes problems with the digestive system and most likely if she is having potty problems, this is the reason. You can give her a few treats in the evening, but not a whole meal. If she is eating a little at a time, she will not be hungry in the morning and it will cause her to not eat very much. I have many years experience with dogs, and I can tell you that this will work for your dog. Good luck|`|GSf09ALBaa	First you need a vet check. Just to make sure there is nothing physical causing this.  And if she has a clean bill of health, just try and find something she really likes to get her started.  Even if you have to cook up some skinless chicken and some rice.  Often, adopted dogs (especially your smaller breeds) need a lot of time to adjust.  I think this is an adjusting period for her and you do not necessarily need to feed her twice a day.  She may be just fine with one feeding.  Give her some time, find a food she really likes and go from there.  As long as she is drinking sufficient amounts of water she will come around.|`|yKGKsWMsaa	put the food on the ground only about 2-3 times a day so she knows when to eat and shes hungry so she WILL eat|`|SusAWRWNaa	I wouldn't worry too much about this. Chihuahua's are a timid breed and if you have only just got it,it has not got much confidence with you so give it a chance to settle in and he will be fine. He won't starve, if he gets hungry he will eat. Just be patient with lots of love. He won't eat much because he is a small breed and don't feed him anything sweet as this is dangerous for the breed.|`|ijLD9rZpaa	Try warming her food up in a pan on your stove or microwave, and pouring a little bit of melted cheese on it. This should do the trick.|`|abwqrdtpaa	My dog had this same problem. First, you should call the shelter you adopted your dog from and asked her what brand of food they were originally feeding her. Since she's a year old, she's probably gotten used to that type of food, if you change it, she won't eat it and she could get diarrhea. Another thing to try, my dog (for some bizarre reason) does not like to eat with people watching her. Give your dog space to eat in private, I'm sure you wouldn't like people staring at you when you ate. And you shouldn't hand feed your dog, it's a terribly hard habit to break. If your dog doesn't eat for another week or so, take her to the vet, she could be sick.
YLYAo2zmaa	You are home and it is playtime.. our dog does the same with her tug o war rope, ( she also shoves it in my face at bed time)|`|GSf09ALBaa	He is happy to see you and is showing it by trying to bring you something.

WKo4ahqRaa	well the bigger the cage the more space you have to clean. if you have one teddy bear hamster it would be good in a medium cage also. um...your second question you might have to ask a petco or petsmart assistant. it might be able to work out with the seperate cages and then put them together|`|X16pbn1Daa	Hamsters dont tend to like company so its a bad idea to put them in the same cage, and i also wouldn't advise mating unless you have lots of experience with hamsters and know exactly what to expect, if you want two then get seperate cages, best of luck :)|`|NnYB9eXiaa	Go to the library, get some books out on hamsters.  Talk to a local breeder, see if they'll mentor you.  If you need to ask these simple questions - you aren't ready yet - and yes, I did answer your questions in the second half of my answer - it isn't all an anti-breeding lecture - but it's really really important that you read it all!    The following list may look like all negative things, and the first section IS a list of reasons not to breed unless you are completely prepared, the second section contains information you need to know if you still decide to breed.    Please keep all the following things in mind BEFORE you breed:    Don't breed if your hamsters are from a pet store.    Why?    Poor breeding causes things like shortened lifespans, susceptibility to illness, and poor temperement (i.e. aggressive hamsters).    Well bred hamsters are not aggressive; this does not mean they won't ever bite, but it does mean they won't go out of their way to bite and will be generally more receptive to handling and be quite a bit friendlier.    Second, if they are from a pet store you don't know their genetic background.    You may be passing along undesirable traits such as aggressiveness and tendencies towards cancers, illness, and physical deformities.    Third, hamsters can have 14+ babies per litter.    Selling them to a pet store guarantees their death; they will be sold as feeders for reptiles and snakes.    Unless you can line up 14+ homes ahead of time, DO NOT BREED.    Fourth: Hamsters are already seriously overpopulated in pet stores; many go for feeders, many more die before they leave the store.    Unless you have an exceptionally rare mutation, and know its (and its prospective mate's) genetic background and pedigree, you should not breed them.    There is no good reason to breed already poorly, and over bred hamsters.    Please do not breed your hamsters for their sake and the sake of any offspring.    If you want more hamsters, adopt one from a shelter, buy one from a breeder, or as a dead last resort, buy one from a pet store. [Edit from Daisy - try petfinder, freecycle and craigslist as well]    Good breeders breed to improve the temperement, health, and markings/color/coat of an animal, not just because they were able to buy a male and female.    http://www.pet-care-experts.com/archive....    ----------------------------------    Important information before making a big decision:    1. You'll need quite a few cages, bins are preferable as breeding cages but there is money involved in setting up a hamstery.    2. You generally need a room just for the hamstery, you aren't going to want a lot of disturbance with the pups or pregnant mothers - especially if you have other animals or small children in the house.    3. You'll be spending a lot of time with your hamsters, you need to make sure that you have time with school and other activities to balance this out.    4. You need to be prepared for visits to the vet.  These aren't always inexpensive visits.    5. You'll need lots of research on genetics and health history.  Good breeders breed to improve the temperement, health, and markings/color/coat of an animal.  You should never breed a hamster bought from a pet store, so you'll need to find a local breeder - perhaps they'll mentor you - again, this will take a lot of your free time.    6.  You need to make sure you have homes lined up *before* you begin breeding.  It's safe to assume a minimum of 2-4 pups and it can be upwards of 14 in a litter.      7.  You really shouldn't try to sell the pups until you've bred multiple times and built up a reputation.  This means you won't be earning money from the pups, so there will be money involved that you won't be able to recoup for awhile.    As far as the actual breeding, and logistics and all of the technical aspects of things, there are many good breeders on this site that can help you.  I'm sure one of them will chime in on that portion of things :)    Just remember, study, research, think, then breed! Try to possibly find an breeder online that will mentor you. Home breeding, when done responsibly is perfectly fine - just be sure you're ready and you start with 2 healthy animals whom you know the genetics and health history of :)|`|xyPpruSjaa	DO NOT put teddy bear hamsters together. They are solitary animals and they will kill eachother.     The bigger the better the cage, personally I prefer 10 or 20 gallon aquariums, they are escape proof, chew proof, surprisingly less expensive than most cages, they're easy to clean and they're just plain ownage xD To hang a waterbottle in your aquarium, use some sticky backed WHITE velcro.    Good luck, if you need any help or have any questions email me at averyrazno@yahoo.com|`|XuYeLCXaaa	Well, it's really not good to put hamsters in the same cage. The best cage to get though is a medium, (No tubes, they can get stuck in them) The best cage to get is a wired one.

I take it you are in the UK but there must be breeders that you can contact. Also if you have managed to get in on the good side of the owner of a pet store that sells reptiles, they may very well tell you what breeder they use and contact the breeder from there. Also if you are worried about cost, be real sure that you want a bearded dragon as they can be expensive. You need UVB lights as well as basking lights and they are not cheap.

J4zjrNpLaa	Generally, so long as there isn't blood in his stool, he's fine.    Causes of dog diarrhea include:  - food allergies  - change in diet  - bacteria in the digestive tract  - stress  - minor sickness    Here's what you do.      1. Make sure he's VERY hydrated.  Keep him drinking water around the clock.    2. Fast him.  Don't feed your dog for 12 - 24 hours    3. After that, give him one can of 100% mashed pumpkin.  Don't give him pumpkin pie filling.  I'm talking about concentrated canned pumpkin.  The pumpkin has fiber and will flush out whatever is making him ill.  He's going to poop bright orange after he it's it.  It's normal. Don't freak out.    4. His next meal should be something that's easy to digest like boiled chicken and some white rice.    5. The next day give him only half his normal amount of dog food    6.  Over the next few days, gradually increase his feeding amount.    You'll see lots of improvement after that.  For more information on what commonly causes diarrhea in dogs, check out this article:  http://www.dog-health-works.com/lp/dog-d...    Best of Luck!|`|L22hVXTIaa	Well, you better get him to the vet or you could wind up with a dead puppy!  Puppy's don't last long when they have diarrhea and aren't eating or drinking.  Dehydration can set in quickly and it is deadly!  Dogs do get sick and you must have the necessary resources to take them to the vet when they need to go.  If not, surrender this dog to the SPCA, they will treat him, but don't waste time - get him in somewhere for treatment!|`|3bf821ff353c216ffc93ff7a91b60828aa	Could be anything from worms or other parasites, a virus or bacterial infection, he ate something that didn't agree with him, or even poisoning.  Sorry, but if he's not acting right and has diarrhea, then a trip to the vet is vital to figure out the exact cause before he dehydrates.  I had the same issue last year with one of my dogs, and I couldn't afford a vet bill either, but managed it anyway.  Ran me about 100.  for everything.|`|73db8f9f9354cfad9d2772cd4342c6e8aa	We really cant answer that question for you.  It could be multiple things.

If they show dogs, then they'll know who's who in the zoo.|`|tPGxPDvBaa	Contact either the Scz. rescue close to you or the breed club.  They can point you toward good breeders or about scz. up for adoptions. Meanwhile do plenty of reading on them, most good breeders will not sell a pup to ppl who have no knowledge about their breed.  Don't forget to set aside money for grooming appts & vet visits.

Honestly, it is more effective than using gadgets like no-pull harnesses and will be helpful in dealing with this current problem even if you choose to use it only in conjunction with your harness.    2.  Get a boat horn and/or water pistol.  When a loose dog harasses you and your dog, blast 'em.  Neither the horn nor the water in a water pistol will injure the offending dog.  But they will make him think it is less fun to harass you and may make his owners think the same.  In an actual attack, the boat horn can be a life saver if for no other reason than calling for help.    3.  Put his going out clothes on every hour or so all day long for a few weeks.  They'll lose their excitement when they usually just mean you're hanging around the house.    4.  Work on attention exercises such as this one: http://www.clickersolutions.com/articles...|`|6pUzzsuhaa	my dog used to do that (she's a 85 lb golden retriever)     what i did was get a leash that i can put at the top of her neck, right behind her head. (only to describe the leash- it's like a noose- but its not one) its used to train dogs to stay close by you and it helps a LOT with pulling. being that your dog is young, he'll pick up on it really quickly. i used that kind of leash on my dog, but when she started to pull, i'd correct her by making a loud, quick noise and i gave the leash a quick and i mean QUICK snatch/pull to correct her and get her attention off the little doggie-in-the blender (jack russel terrier) at the end of our dirt road   for my dog, it only took about a week of using that and i don't need a leash now.   i suggest using that kind of leash, but don't keep the leash pulled tight when walking- that will make resistance on the leash and will want them to pull even more.     and to calm him down, tell him to sit and only put the harness and leash on him when he's sitting- calmly. that will take a little time but it will work (again, my dog, the golden and my other 2 used to do that) just correct him, with a quick, loud noise again and tell him to sit and his reward for being calm will be going out on the walk, so he'll realize that the only way that he'll go on a walk is if he's sitting down calmly.|`|AA11729094	I may be wrong here, but by your definitions, it sounds like you have no choice but to walk past the house with the loose running dog in order to get to the woods. If it was me, I'd call around to see what the dog laws are, if your neighbors are not in compliance with the laws, make a friendly trip down there, without your dog of course, and let them know what;s going on, what the laws are, and see if they take the steps to correct their dog. If they don't, then let the law handle it, you've done your part, your dog is legal, you are being responsible with your animal, you even went to their house to explain things, what else could you have done? The law will explain things to them in no uncertain terms what is expected of them, and their compliance with the law.|`|PeUk4TuPaa	this sounds like the problem i had. i live on a dead end too. in a small town with no parks and a very busy road by my house! you could be my neighbor!ha ha. well i just started walking my rosie in the woods cause that dog up the street would not stop trying to attack my dog!! they are about the same size so i knew if they ever got hold of each other then it would be a bad fight. so i started walking my pup in the woods behind my house. she loves it. there is also a creek that she likes to play in...|`|ajJViUbcaa	First off, when walking in the area his starts to pull, turn around and head back home or back in the house if continues to act excited.  Then when he's settled, try again. Everytime he starts acting up, head home until he calms down, and turn around and try again.  Teach him he's not going to be able to go anywhere if he keeps acting like that.  No yelling is needed. Just be in control of what your dog is thinking. As soon as you feel a pull, turn around.     Now for getting ready for a walk. Basically the same thing. Everytime you pick up his leash and harness and he gets excited, put the leash and harness away. When he calms down, try again. Keep doing it until he behaves to have the leash and harness put on.    If he starts pulling while going to the door or just as he walks out the door, take him in and take everything off. Repeat as often as needed.    Don't give up. He'll get your messages across sooner or later.
5PsKGss7aa	As we did with a cat we took in 3 months prior to her death(she was old & had cancer & a tumor, we just kept her happy,giving her medication so she wouldnt be sore in anyway till she passed), we called the vet & over the phone we confirmed that she passed.  Our vet told us to place her in the freezer(thank god we still had a freezer that we were about to throw away anyway) to preserve her a  till they opened the next day so we could take her in.  we took her there the next day and a week later we got her ashes back & she is now place on a shelf in the living room.. we'd do that with our other cats & dogs whenever it comes to that.|`|DhE0rEWiaa	Well I have had dogs and cats die, If my dog just died out of the blue I would have a necropsy done. Well seeing that this have never happened and I have had to have my dogs and cats euthanized ether because of old age or cancer, I have all my pet cremated..|`|nooi0ldjaa	when a dog is dead, its not breathing problems you need to worry about...the cool thing about shovels is they don't care if its hot or cold :O crazy...i know.|`|cMz0Cbu4aa	Uh....you can bury them in a pet cemetery. If you arent sure if it is dead. Just put your ear up to its nose, and listen.|`|bPgvMO98aa	If your dog is sick or having trouble breathing, you should take them to the vet.  If the dog is dead, you could bury them if you have enough land so that you won't hit a water or gas line or if there isn't an ordinance against it.  In cold weather, you might need someone with a backhoe to dig the hole, especially if it's a big dog.  You could also opt for the cremation option.  Your vet could help you with that.  Most vets either have their own crematorium or a service they use.|`|JBuNJJbkaa	I cry|`|tdN2ouxAaa	Ugh. I HATE the very thought of my current dog passing away, but it's happened before and I'll tell you what I did.    You're not supposed to bury your deceased dog in your back yard. In my county it's even illegal to do so. Your county animal control department will also come and pick up a deceased animal from your home free of cost. Your taxes pay for such things.     When my little black cocker-terrier mix named Zelda died on the way to the vet seven years ago, I didn't have enough money to pay for a plot in a pet cemetery. I had the vet cremate her and return her ashes to me in a little tin urn. It even came with a little death certificate. It only cost about $200, and it was well worth it.     Many vets and county animal services will do a cremation for you at a very affordable cost. All you have to do is call them up and ask!|`|76nTvO4iaa	If your dog does tonight, you do not have to go out and bury it right then.  You can wait until tomorrow when it's light to do it.    I have buried dogs in the back yard.    I have had them buried them in a pet cemetery.    I have had them cremated and the ashes are in an urn on the mantle.    I'm sorry your dog is sick.  ((hugs))|`|yCR6qg0baa	You could, or you could have its remains "destroyed" at an animal hospital. They usually charge for that.

z3Z7AQWPaa	If he works fine in his bit then he shouldn't need to change.    But copper oxidizes in a horses mouth which makes them salivate more. Which makes the bit "work" better in a horses mouth. It's kind of like when you get squeaky doors on your car, well when you oil the hinge then it stops.     The second one was a hollow mouth D-ring which means it is covering more space in the horses mouth so it is less severe. The thinner the bit the more severe it becomes because it is distributing pressure over less space when it's thin and vise versa when its hollow or wider.    I personally like the second and third one.  But copper is more of a matter of preference. If your horse is working fine in his current bit then don't spend the extra money on copper.|`|7PAGYzdhaa	there really dosn't seem to be a difference between the two bits. MAYBE in the size of the D, but that dosn't change the contact in the horses mouth...the copper DOES NOT 'distract the horse' that's totally wrong. But they were right for making them salivate more. But the whole point of the copper is to make a wetter mouth. With a wetter mouth, the bit has more effect. It is bad to have a 'dry mouth', well not BAD but there's not as much effect. Copper does not give more energy (so that wont help with your lazy horse) and it won't help the chomping. Try tightening your noseband for the chomping. Or if that dosnt work then try a figure 8 noseband, or a flash noseband. Is hes lazy then try a small pair of spurs. Or you could carry a crop, you don't actually have to use it but sometimes it just helps the horse for you to carry it! hope this has helped!!!  Ja-maken me blush |`|JL6GXFJOaa	For hunter, you want a more D shaped ring on the outside. I would say your best bet is the last one. The copper makes the horse salivate, which takes their mind off of riding. If you have a bitter horse, or a horse that likes to chew, then copper is the way to go. However, it wont' hurt one who is fine. Here is a link to a good hunter d ring bit. http://www.sstack.com/shopping/product/d...  Also, you can tell the actual bit part on these is different. Its hard to ssee, but they have different curves. You want a slight curve. Not too much though. But it will fit better in the hroses mouth. Now this bit is expensive, but Mylers will last so much longer than those other bits, and they are just absoloutley amazing!|`|5eNGp8TRaa	Copper makes the horses salivate more and relax. I'm not sure,  but I think the difference between a hunter dee and a regular dee is just the shape of the dees.    ETA:  It's worth a try. Sounds more like a training/personality issue, but hey, it couldn't hurt. It's not like you're moving him to a pessoa gag or something.|`|54lT7R6uaa	copper makes a horse salavate more and want to accept the bit.    the copper would make him probably chomp even more, so i wouldn't suggest it. i'm guessing you ride english, but i would suggest something with rollers, or something with a mouthpice like this:    http://equisearch.com/tack/bitgallery/DC...    its still a snaffle, but its slightly more agressive. i would school in a smooth snaffle at home and this type at a show cause horses are more stressed at shows and need a tad bit more control.

K0uTjeWiaa	Cats are carnivores. Grains are not good.Vegetables fruits offer nothing. Plain meat snacks are fine   No cows milk for a kitten      All cats of all ages can eat the same things. There really is no difference in kitten food, indoor food, active food  ect  It is all marketing  Nutrition since there are so many bad things out there is very important to your cats health  Contrary to what you may have heard; dry foods are not a great thing to feed a cat.   Please read the label on what you are feeding? What are the ingredients? Do you know what they mean? Is the first ingrediant a muscle meat like chicken or meal or other things?  http://www.catinfo.org/ Learn_How_To_Rea...  http://iml.jou.ufl.edu/projects/Spring04...  Dry foods are the number 1 cause of diabetes in cats as well as being a huge contributing factor to kidney disease, obesity, crystals, u.t.is and a host of other problems. Food allergies are very common when feeding dry foods. Rashes, scabs behind the tail and on the chin are all symptoms  The problems associated with Dry food is that they are loaded with grains and carbohydrates which many cats (carnivores) cannot process.  Also, Most of the moisture a cat needs is suppose to be in the food but in  Dry, 95% of it is zapped out of dry foods in the processing. Another thing, most use horrible ingredients and don't use a muscle meat as the primary ingredient and use vegetable based protein versus animal. Not good for an animal that has to eat meat to survive.  http://www.catinfo.org/ My_Cat_is_Doing_...  You want to pick a canned food w/o gravy (gravy=carbs) that uses a muscle meat as the first ingredient and doesn't have corn at least in the first 3 ingredients if at all.      THE  BEST CAT FOODS CONTAIN NO GRAINS NO BYPOODUCTS NO MEAL  Cats are meat eaters not cereal or rice eaters   Fancy feast is a middle grade food with 9lives, friskies  whiskas lower grade canned and wellness and merrick upper grade human quality foods. I would rather feed a middle grade canned food then the top of the line dry food.   Also, dry food is not proven to be better for teeth. Does a hard pretzel clean your teeth or do pieces of it get stuck? http://www.felinefuture.com/nutrition/bp...     Please read about cat nutrition.  http://www.catinfo.org/                                  http://www.catinfo.org/feline_obesity.ht...        http://maxshouse.com/feline_nutrition.ht...     Vetinarian diets  The reason your vet thinks so highly of the pet food they sell probably has more to do with money than nutrition. In vet school, the only classes offered on nutrition usually last a few weeks, and are taught by representatives from the pet food companies. Vet students may also receive free food for their own dogs and cats at home. They could get an Iams notebook, a Purina purse and some free pizza.  http://iml.jou.ufl.edu/projects/Spring04...|`|wA8g5mFNaa	Just give them commercial kitten food.

You can add some rice or potato.    Main Kitten No-No's:    Chocolate (the darker it is the more toxic it is to a cat or dog)  Onions/Garlic   Grapes/Raisins (causes kidney damage to cats)  Alcohol (may cause alcohol poisoning)  Any sweet containing xylotol (usually found in sugar free candy)  Any salty, spicy, or fatty foods  Due to the recent recalls, peanut products of any kind should be considered no-no's until further notice for most pets.  Cow's milk (note: goat's milk and lactose-free milk is okay)    Cats are carnivores.  They don't need fruits and vegetables, though many cats eat veggies.      For this reason, Purina, Eukanuba, Science Diet, Meow Mix, Friskies Fancy Feast, 9 Lives, and Ol Roy are NOT good foods to feed.  They hhave corn, by-products, and other things that don't belong in a cat's diet.     Good Cat Foods/Treats:    CatSip: a milk treat for cat and dogs.

Get a kitten food that is crunchy as well as some canned cat food. Your kitten will need to eat 2-3 times a day. Only give as much as they will eat in a 15 minute period and remove the food. Fresh water should be available all the time.    * Milk is a NO NO because it can give a cat diarreah  * Table food is a NO NO because it will constipate, make them ill (some foods are poison to cats even though they aren't to humans) or it can make them obese and cause muscle and joint problems as well as other health issues.

NnYB9eXiaa	Hi :)    He'll need a full week to settle into his cage.  Everything you're describing is quite common.    Imagine if took you out of your bed, stuck you in a strange house, you don't know where everything from the kitchen is - but you've found the bedroom and bathroom :)  That's what's happening here.  There are new sights, new sounds, new smells, new everything.    What I'm about to tell you isn't to scare you - I just think it's good for new owners to know :)  The main reason for giving him the extra time is that hamsters are easily stressed in new environments, and if they get stressed they can develop wet tail.  Please don't give him any of the "wet tail preventative" or "dri tail" drops or tablets.  They're a broad spectrum antibiotic and will make him sicker.  If you think he's sick with wet tail - the vet is your safest option.    After he's had a FULL week to settle in without petting or touching, try the following list which will help everyone be able to pick him up without  scaring or startling him :)      Remember to never wake your hamster up to play! They'll be calmer if they've been running in their wheel for a while as well, and lastly, just like a human -- they may not be in the mood to play some days!    1. Wash your hands carefully with a non-fruity or heavily scented soap - this will keep them from wanting to taste, and possibly bite your hand.  Others may advise you to wear gloves - this prevents the hamster from learning your scent, and you want them to know YOU when you're handling them, not the smells on a glove.    2. NEVER reach into the hamster cage and try to *grab* your hamster. Hamsters are quite protective of their homes and will try to defend them (aka bite you or flip over and scream -- which is a defense mechanism). Females tend to be more "cage aggressive" than males, although with time and patience, this will diminish with either one.    3. Hold a small cup or bowl in front of the cage door with a yummy treat in it - the hamster will crawl in almost every time.    4. Slide the lil guy out of the cup/bowl into your hand - and voila! You're holding your hamster and haven't been bitten!    Be careful as they will be a bit skittish. Of course you'll want to be sure to be extra gentle as they are still animals and can bite when they get scared!  They may also lick/nibble your fingers, don't mistake this for biting, it just means they're curious.  Nibbling tickles - biting hurts ;)    Once your hamster gets more accustomed to you and how you smell, you'll be able to skip step 3 and they'll crawl right into your hand.    Best of luck - and have patience    Also, if you have any questions I'd be glad to help - I've been working with new owners for 13 years now :)|`|rTLp1ZGQaa	Sounds normal to me.  My hamster alwayz sleeps.|`|cqEYllm9aa	First of all if you just got this hamster your not supposed to handle it for at least 4ish days. Because the hamster in a new environment, it can be very stressful. Just leave it be. Also the fact that he's going to the bathroom so much can mean that he's very stressed. But other than that he sounds normal just let him do his own thing.|`|PiDM4tyQaa	Ok the first time i got my hamster it started not drinking water and i thought ok...Maybe he will drink but 5 hours later nothing! But he will smell the water in the bottle so he will start sucking out of it.And to adjust to him,I would say give him or her a small carrot from the travel packs,Or go to hamster Hideout.com it will tell you how to get used to your hamster.|`|fU4pOpeHaa	he's allright|`|ea57331baf4a18f47dbbd6f150a03a4faa	I think your hamster is okay, just shy, like anyone would be at first. It may take a few days for him to get used to his new home, and then he'll start having fun!|`|0xUrpWx9aa	my son the hamster or ham-taro hasn't adapted to his new home yet tomorrow he will be greater but the twelve stools are normal i went to  the bathroom like 9 times, dont worry|`|HF0oDEd0aa	no hamsters make nests useing pinn wood (sreadded wood) and they love the smell of that but it is to rough for hamsters so go with sell absorbed beddings my hamster felt better after that and place sun flower seeds lotsd of sunflower seeds they love it  PS hamsters love up to 2 to 3 years|`|JuaZBzu3aa	ya, that's normal. My hamsters did the same thing when I first got them. He's just scared.|`|vbncybSAaa	Yeah thats totally fine
3ybVdfMEaa	I wouldn't add a honey gourami to your 20 gallon. He'd probably be bullied by the dwarfs. And the kuhli loach isn't a great fish for a 20 gallon. They get to be four inches, and really do much better in schools of at least 3.    The guppies would work. And corydoras catfish, yes. But if you go with corys, consider sand instead of gravel. They like to dig around in the substrate; most gravels are too rough on their mouths and "whiskers."    Otocinclus catfish are really neat. But I'd wait until your 20 gallon has been up and running for a while before you introduce any of these. They're fairly sensitive to water quality. And keep an eye on your pet store's stock for a week or so before buying. Otos are often underweight and sicky when they're shipped in, and if that's the case, it's better not to buy them.    Some other species to consider:  -- cherry barbs  -- rasboras  -- neon/cardinal/glowlight/lemon (or other small) tetras  -- clown pleco   -- shrimp    Personally, I'd get 3-5 panda corydoras, 3 cherry barbs and some ghost shrimp to go in that 20 gallon with what you already have. Or I'd do a small school of lemon tetras with the shrimp and a clown pleco.|`|AraBfesHaa	I'm glad you addced "only male" to your guppy line.  This should also go for mollies.  One female molly can overpopulate your tank in a month or 2.  Odd are pretty far out there that if you buy a female molly (or guppy for that matter) it's already pregnant.  Also mollies  nip at other fish and are big pigs.|`|SA5DeRpUaa	you should get some amano shrimps they don't produce alot of waste and will eat almost everytype of freshwater algae.    get a small school of neon or cardinal tetras to make the tank look more active.   a honey gourami will grow to large for the 10 gallon. and if you accidently end up with a male and female guppie they will multiply like crazy and over populate.|`|opEUD5iSaa	angel fish|`|xbyQAU4haa	like the other answerer, a school of cardinal tetras  Assorted girl mollies are great too. I love balloon belly Mollies.
vvJBtxXHaa	many methods for many aquarists do exist...so here goes    you mentioned a 20-gallon aquarium, filter, heater and bubbler...the filter and heater are absolute essentials for a tropical fish tank....if you elect to go with goldfish, then the heater is not needed as goldfish enjoy colder water, rather than warmer water  ...if you mention a "bubbler" as meaning a CO2 diffusion method, i recommend you research the variety of diffusion methods on the market in your area, compare those to potential home-made methods that can be made from water bottle pieces and installed and concealed under stacked-type-rock-formations, surrounded by vallisneria and java moss (hehehe, cleverly concealed)  ...some ready-made CO2 diffusers are quite expensive, but not relatively more or less efficient than DIY methods    Fishless cycles are longer, add a few pinchesof finely ground up fish flakes to create ammonia to speed up the 6 to 8 week process for a 20 gallon    Fish cycling, is quicker, set up the plants, food, and water filter, running for 2 weeks, then take a "pill bottle" of water sample to the pet store for an ammonia - nitrite test...~around 2 weeks for a 20 gallon should be safe to add 2 to 3 zebra danios, or white cloud minnows...  ....float them in and begin twice weekly, 25% water changesm watching for the water color change to occur  ....depending upon how quickly the bacteria are colonizing you may see a mildly clouded look for a week, or possibly a vividly white clouded look swirling around for just a couple of days, then clearing rapidly    Your question is:  1. cycling with fish "is faster"  2. anubias varieties are excellent, low light, easy to care for and absorb fish by-products very well...these are easy for beginners  ...as well as the other species you have listed...none of these need CO2 infusions...your fish will add ammonia as fertilizer they will use   3. yes, those plants you listed will all handle the cycling very well    In a word, the time you spend intially designing first and then planting the tank is all very well spent....      Planted tanks are worth every last minute spent in designing the idea before actually striring up the water:    ...set up the tank with substrate and add 4" to 8" of water to saturate the substrate and gravel, etc....as you add more water try to locate a platform to pour the water on so it doesn't stir-up and disturbe the nice designs you create....I recommend patience in filling the tank, floating in large 2 to 4 quart bowls of water to avoid wrecking the whole design    ....if you use sand in the substrate cloudy water is inevitable  ...it will clear overnight (not to wrry), so one might simply fill it up wth water, then shovel in a bulk of substrate, smooth it out with your hand and wait till the next day to begin fine tuning the layout of the sand and gravel    ...then size up the "structures" you will use, like rock formations, or drift wood, castles, etc., etc....you may like to create raised areas where to locate "mossy" flowing banks that add a dimensionalized effect....many award-winning photos exist online for some excelent ideas that may be attempted by others|`|gwDftPBsaa	Yes I think the plants you listed are good for beginers, I know anubias, java fern , java moss are really easy to take care of. As for cycling I would go with a a few hardy fishes to cycle your tank. I would start off with just the cyling fishes in the water and once the cycling is complete then you can out in the plants. You want to keep the tank bare(meaning without the plants or ornaments and stuff) so that its easy to do water changes when your cycling your tank.|`|SA5DeRpUaa	if you have all those plants in there they will bring the and seed the aquarium with the good bacteria you want. then you can have a very small amount of fish to start out with. but wait 1-2 weeks with the plants in for the ph to stabalize and for the bacteria to grow.
ovf7pLvyaa	ooooo...cutie|`|PMksnqkxaa	Why is this in the reptile section first of all? There is a DOG section for a reason.  Second of all, She looks like an American Pit Bull Terrier to me. She looks NOTHING like a Great Dane.|`|c0uwtsJ5aa	She looks nothing like a great dane! I thought great danes were like super skinny and big|`|FWlSFpByaa	No her ears give it away but her facial structure looks the same. Wide snout and face but she's cute!|`|AA10049109	Most likely they are the same people who are posting a dog question in the reptile section...and no...she doesn't look anything like a great dane.|`|CUFnorZyaa	She looks like a mutt with some pit in her. Chest isn't deep enough and jaw structure doesn't look right for a full bred pit. But could be the angle of the shot too.    I can say with great certainty she looks nothing like a dane. And even more obviously she isn't a reptile.|`|1c3d47cb23a5e186ce3ede1c1b323befaa	aww... but no, she looks nothing like a great dane! lol!|`|gUD7Oug1aa	No, not at all.  It must be her coloring.  Like a harlequin great dane.  How large is she?|`|6j9EZXGWaa	That is not a Great Dane.|`|mxrlZEweaa	Not a Great Dane at all. Looks like a pit bull mixed with maybe lab. It's hard to tell when I can't see her body. She is gorgeous though!|`|FPaJ1AU0aa	She looks like an APBT, some people are just clueless :p    Its fine, one time a had a horse question and I posted it in "Fish" by accident, it happens to all of us sometimes!
5PsKGss7aa	lol. no.. maybe people keep saying that your dog is because of the coloring possibly.|`|44kEtDvIaa	You expect people that can't identify members of their own kind to be able to identify different breeds of dogs?|`|ZlNFOgO7aa	People are ignorant.    I have a kelpie cross and she gets called a labrador all the time (she is only 20kg.....not 40kg) and we have  dobi that never gets mistaken because he is "dangerous" apparently. He would like to lick your hand and sit on your lap. Dangerous, pffft.|`|0fuF2sHbaa	Someone thought my Pomeranian was a Corgi.    Pomeranian:  http://www.kennels.co.uk/images/T.Pomera...    Corgi:  http://images.chron.com/blogs/cookstour/...    Oh well, at least they try :)|`|tPGxPDvBaa	Ummm.....no!!!    Of course I had someone once from a short distance  who thought my dane was a small pony.  He was fixing to ask me why I was walking a pony on a leash.   lol|`|y0cbLn0Yaa	My Malinois is, apparently, a really nice looking Shepherd cross - even after they have been told he is a Belgian Shepherd Malinois which is a completely different breed than a German Shepherd.    I don't mind educating people but when they continue to mistake his breed after being told then they are beneath my contempt and I just accept them for what they are - ignorant morons.    Edit:  Chaos:  Maybe if I closed my eyes and squinted while looking at your dogs briefly for half a second maybe I could mistake them for a Greyhound!  LOL  Just joking of course.  Your dogs are gorgeous.|`|P8Q39vA4aa	Does my weimaraner look like a greyhound to you?  http://i273.photobucket.com/albums/jj224...    Cause thats certainly what i get. And great dane, and labrador, and vizsla (which is the closest). People just dont know dog breeds well not their fault. Not everyone studies dog breeds.    Edit- why thank you very much, i love this breed.|`|KxjUim7yaa	Um, no. A Pit Bull?|`|26PPwzrWaa	No.   I was going to say american pit bull terrier too.|`|wjwsFPMuaa	A GREAT DANE??? Who told you that?? She's a gorgeous APBT but NOT a dane! HAHAHA|`|nooi0ldjaa	Ha! even i know thats a (very cute) pit! and im 14 XD.|`|0nIwKd5Uaa	For the record that's exactly what my black and white great dane looked like when he was 4-5 months old. So i can see how people got them mixed up.     For the record a 4-5 month old great dane only weighs 40-60lbs, and at that young of an age they aren't up to your hips, waist yet. Your dog is a puppy that's where the confusion is.    We also have a black great dane and until he hit roughly 8-12 months people always thought he was a black lab. Personally i don't see the big deal.    So people just walking up to you on the street are supposed to know the age and breed of your dog??????     Your should be grateful these people are walking up to your dog. Great way to socialize your dog, and if some of those people who assume your dog is a great Dane knew it was pit bull may not have walked up to it. So be grateful. They could walk acrossed the stree to avoid your dog.    Have any of you thought that maybe the people getting the dogs mixed up are not familiar with all 2000 damn dog breeds there is out there? I know a lot of different dog breeds but i will not say i know them all. People aren't stupid, they just go with a familiar breed that looks close in the face to the dog your asking about.|`|70878cc978ee2e4a79b3b53284340f9caa	No,that looks like a Pit Bull.I guess people who don't know dogs don't know their breeds. I know a lot about cats,but I really have a hard time at identifying some of the breeds.Dogs are much easier!    Edit: I had a Chow/Australian Shepherd/Newfoundland/Rott mix,and one day she got out of our fence and was wandering around in the front yard and the little girl across the street,who was about 12 at the time,asked me if I knew there was a bear in my yard!! I said "No,that is just Maura!" She was black and furry,but way smaller than a bear!!|`|EJL5QoDraa	no way sge is a pitbull/mix|`|2S0BkT7oaa	Great Dane? Oh dear lord no..     She is a gorgeous APBT. it amazes me how someone could get her mixed up with a Great Dane, I see no resemblance.|`|9vzfI4kDaa	no  pit mix|`|PeUk4TuPaa	looks like a pit to me....i'm 13 and know that...haha|`|ADLupVviaa	Lol no. I'd say Staffy or Staffyx but without seeing the dogs body in full and standing next to a person as a height guide, I couldnt be 100% sure.|`|S9B8Fr4daa	Wow--NO WAY..  I would say shes a Pit bull..Maybe a mix..But definitely NOT great dane.|`|VHFf1dOMaa	I don't know what you people are looking at the dog I saw was a typical Great Dane, I'm a breeder and I know my stuff.....    *** SECOND THOUGHT*** No Definatly NOT a Dane.. It's a Labradoodle.                                                                ~lol~|`|DYxb7P3Baa	awww shes very cute :) and definetly not a great dane if shes so small D=|`|5cYgk9FSaa	NO!  I'm pretty good at knowing dog breeds, though!|`|43JgLpkKaa	happens to us all. nice pit by the way !   everyone thinks my mastiff is a bull mastiff . because she is a good weight { and not overweight }  they assume she is a bull mastiff .   this one troubled me .... my rhodesian was called a lab mix { ?? how did they get that ?? } ,  a vizsla ,  and a weimaraner ... wow ... talk about not knowing your dog breeds !|`|PAwqjxvaaa	no that's no great dane, that's a pit bull or a pit bull mix|`|DhE0rEWiaa	Well it just comes down to uneducated people. My first English Bulldog I can't even begin to tell you the people that asked me if he was a Pit, I even had this man yell at me and say I had no right to own one of those nasty Pit Bulls and to get that dog off the street after all there are kids around here as he crossed the street with his two young girls. Some people are just clueless. Sometimes I just wanted to scream, so I just started to say yep he a Pit watch out. People are just clueless    No your dog dose not look like a GD, you do have a cute PB.|`|5x2DTMKYaa	no, no great dane there, lol.            (Which is why BSL is the dumbest thing around!)|`|QOedxa2saa	I have Bernese Mountain Dogs and where ever we go (other than to a dog show) people ask about our 'Saint', 'Rottie', 'Dobie', etc.    Does this look like a Saint? http://s12.photobucket.com/albums/a246/b...    We also recently rescued a Papillon that people call a chi.    Again, does this look like a Chi? http://s12.photobucket.com/albums/a246/b...  http://s12.photobucket.com/albums/a246/b...
wjwsFPMuaa	In human terms yes..it's a cold. But the vet will call it an upper respiratory infection. They're very contaigous to other cats. So keep him isolated 10-14 days or until his antibiotics are finished. The vet will probably prescribe you amoxicillin for the URI.|`|cv58x64qaa	Most likely.Don't worry he'll be ok.My cat had a cold last week.She was sneezing like your cat and she's fine now.Taking your cat to the vet is a good idea.Good luck!!!|`|yJZeRu5Vaa	i love cats!|`|JYsV0KfKaa	he probably does.  keep him warm and if he gets any worse you should probably take him to the vet to get some medicine.    do not give him a bath.  that is a horrible idea for a kitten with a cold.|`|aNZW4J15aa	most likely, you should take him to the vet or give him a warm small bath. Hope it helps! :P|`|ThZOfp81aa	It could just be allergies.  As long as he's still eating and drinking, I wouldn't worry.  I had a cat who sneezed and sniffled constantly, and he was healthy, it was just mild allergies, just like you or I would get.    If he stops eating or showing interest in anything, call the vet, otherwise, he'll probably be just fine.|`|VWdXRdy6aa	My cat gets colds like this a lot.  You might want to take him to the vet and get him checked out, just in case it could be something serious, but I doubt that it will be anything more than just a cold.  Hope this helps!!
Rdpv91NTaa	i would leave it as it is you could add 1 angelfish but i wouldn't risk it gold gouramis are agressive fellas.|`|j6YT8xEVaa	well rule of thumb is for each inch (of fish, length) is for one gallon of water in a tank. so it depends on how large your fish are and how large they could get.|`|gwDftPBsaa	you can go with a schooling tyoe fish like rumming nose tetras, neon tetras, but yeah angels would work out fine.
w1lh1INHaa	Is it healthy?  YES, YES, YES!!!!!!    I don't know who told you that 75% protein isn't healthy (they probably think dry food is the bomb), but they are wrong.  If a cat were left to its own devices in the wild, their prey would be providing 70-80% protein.      Please, what are the name of these treats?  I've been looking for such a treat for my cats, and they sound perfect!!!!!!    ADDED:  Just checked it out, good ingredients, quite reasonably priced, also.  I'm an hour away from PetSmart, but I'm going to ask my local pet store if they will stock them.  The cats are mewling in anticipation and said to send you some kitty kisses...but, I'll just say thank you.  Can't wait to get some.|`|FhVobWpeaa	much healthier than the junky corn stuff, just don't give a lot at a time or too often and there should be no problems.|`|4aAhEK9daa	Absolutely!  Treats like that are great for cats - but of course, in moderation.  In fact, of pet treats these 100% fish or chicken treats are really the ONLY healthy ones out there!  A chicken treat would actually be healthier, though - http://www.littlebigcat.com/index.php?ac...      I'm VERY impressed that PetSmart is finally stocking some healthy treats!   A lot of people assume that foods and treats bought there are good for our pets while about 90% of what they sell there is total garbage!|`|VDP3pNCPaa	Since it is only a treat, and considering what it is, it will be loved.  But if you want a treat that will be absolutely loved, look for dried Bonita Tuna shavings, most commonly under the brand of Cat Man Doo.    Your cat will go crazy.    Remember, you are giving a treat, not a diet, so it will be fine.|`|7ea0996112daf630f035d318bedc84adaa	Since many cats develop kidney disease when they get older, it may not be wise to give too many treats that are high protein.  These cats are put on diets such as Hill's K/D or Purina NF to slow down kidney deterioration, so these cats may be at risk if given too many high-protein treats.    Otherwise, for a young healthy cat a few protein-rich treats should not be too much of a problem.|`|yJZeRu5Vaa	i love cats!
fQ3d5iAWaa	Well It's all depends on how big you want your cage to be. I Bought my cage at the pet store. You can also check your pet store, I'm sure they will have something. And you can also check out a site: craiglist.com     Good luck.
AF03aWutaa	As I haven't seen it happen, I'm not sure whether it was an actual issue. However, please note that parrots and cockatoos do yawn. Try to remember what your bird was doing, then compare it to the video at the link below. If it's similar, then you probably don't have to worry about it.    http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Khg8Oeod-...|`|AA10566881	My parakeets do it on occasion.  It's scary looking!  The first time I saw it, I thought the bird would keel over.  But, I guess it's just something they do.  Not sure why.  I still watch them carefully if I see this happening, but they are always okay.    I hope that your bird is like mine and just doing some strange budgie thing.|`|8K52kg4Yaa	Yawning.|`|5f6fbccb8643408cbd62a8431b3e5c44aa	please consult an avian vet if this behavior continues. they can usually tell when the symptoms point twards illness over the phone & will request an appointment.|`|9743a4b9136d6937a430cb49e25563baaa	birds are very good at hiding illness.  This may have been an isolated incident, but it could be a sign that he is ill.  Does he show any other sign of having respiratory problesm?  Does he have any discharge around his eyes or nostrils?  When he is sitting on his perch does his tail bob or pump up and down?  Also sick birds often will keep feathers fluffed up.  To be on the safe side if you have any question about his health have him evaluated by a vet familair with birds.    aav.org|`|FWlSFpByaa	He could have been yawning repeatedly my bird does that|`|upHeh1AUaa	my Cockatiels do it aswell. They're just yawning.|`|zRXkkh0Maa	Yes, something is wrong. He may have difficulties breathing. If it continues again, bring it to the vet. DO NOT DELAY FOR MORE THAN 24 HOURS. Good luck.    It may also be yawning, but i believe it cannot be yawning for such a long time. So the best is to a vet.|`|qXnfaN9Zaa	sound like it could be an upper respiratory infection, check for things like ruffled feathers sitting low on perch or tail bobbing. If you see any of these symptoms you should get him to a vet ASAP.|`|LL3pUzKgaa	well it could show that he is sick, or he could be imitating something there are lots of options. i don't thing he is going to die right this second but you should check for any other signs of sickness like, drinking loads of water, or loosing feathers also sleeping on the bottom of the cage could show he is weak.
w1lh1INHaa	I'm assuming you are using a non-toxic "dye" suitable for pets, right?  If not, do not, repeat, do not do it or you will seriously hurt your cat, possibly even kill her.    No matter what color you use, you will only get undertones, so I think a burgundy (if you can't find a burgundy, mix purple and red) will give you the best color-enhancement bang.    A friend of mine "dyes" her white cat green every St. Patrick's day (simple green food coloring) and it lasts for a couple of weeks, and hasn't hurt the cat in all these 12 years of doing it.|`|yJZeRu5Vaa	i love cats!|`|zeTGmB3faa	You can't. Black is a strong color that would require bleaching. Then you would need to take the cat to a vet for severe burns and possible internal damage,causing you to be charged with animal abuse and a very steep vet bill. Dye your hair and leave the cat alone.|`|hccISKvHaa	Just don't. That would be pointless. Besides you would never be able to dye over black fur, you would need to bleach it first and that would be dangerous for the cat.|`|dYluozLHaa	animal abuser, theese colors that you want to put in you black cat are made out of cats, i hope you know that if you buy haircolor that you are killing and animal because its made out of an animal and tested on animals so it would be safe for US not the animal, dont do it|`|Vh5DrXvOaa	You do know that its illegal to dye your animal. It is seen as a form of abuse. A lady I know was walking in a walk to raise money for breast cancer and she dyed her white poodle pink (breast cancer color) well she was arrested and her dog was taken away and she was fined also. So I wouldnt advise doing it..|`|x6e2ASEaaa	Why would u want to do that, don't dye your kitty it will burn its skin.|`|AA10895169	Quit it with the stupid questions.. feel like dying something? Do your own hair for crying out loud!|`|wA8g5mFNaa	There are services that can paint your pet with something safe for her to lick off, but it's very expensive and IMO not worth it.|`|3zEKZNFsaa	Do not dye the cats fur, you may actually kill her!  Cats absorb things thru their skin unlike dogs, that is why there are different products for fleas for each, certain chemicals will fatally harm a cat.  Shouldn't use any chemicals on a cat between absorbing it they will also lick themselves profusely trying to get it off.|`|ThZOfp81aa	This definitely wouldn't be safe, and besides, no color would take.|`|37p2xZYjaa	poor kitty.  don't do that to her.|`|EPo7N1xBaa	Are you insane? Why on earth would you want to do that and risk the cat's health? Dye your own hair or get a stuffed animal cat and dye it's hair!|`|XPB6Ogj0aa	I'm sorry, but you can't.  In order for a black cat to show up some other color you would have to strip her fur of it's natural color and this would be toxic and dangerous.  Products that are OK for people are harmful for cats.  It's just like you can't use people shampoo on a cat, you can't use human dye.  You can't thoroughly rinse out all the shampoo and it can be toxic to your pet.    See I didn't criticize or anything that, just pointed out that a black cat wouldn't be able to show up another color.
5QG9Zrjaaa	Combi is the cleaner, the ledersoft is the conditioner.  I like them both, but I only use the ledersoft monthly on my bridles and twice a year on the saddles.  I use the combi weekly on bridles and saddles, and wipe both with a damp cloth after every ride.      When I condition, I always make sure that the leather is warm (not hot) so it will soak in best.  In the winter, I bring the tack home and let it warm up for a couple of hours before I clean and condition.  In the summer, I do it all at the barn.      Be sure that the conditioner has at least 12 hours on the leather, then wipe it with a dry cloth before you ride.  The conditioner should be put mostly on the rough underside of the leather, as the smooth finished side can only absorb a small amount due to the process that has made the leather smooth and shiny.  Put a very thin layer on the outside to give it a new sheen and to smooth any small scratches that may have developed in the leather.|`|TB7q2moCaa	For conditioning my saddle i use olive oil it is much cheaper and works better then all those fancy brands of leather conditioners
KEYgd73saa	There are a few options...  First, it could be columnaris, which is a bacterial infection commonly known as "mouth rot" or "mouth fungus" as it develops a fuzzy, white look that erodes the lips and can spread to other parts of the body.  Second, it could be nothing more than an injury from bumping into something.    I would recommend purchasing the antibiotics to treat columnaris (it's always good to have some on hand, anyway), and watch closely as symptoms develop.  If you start to see flesh eroding and/or white patches develop, begin treatment with Triple Sulfa, Trisulfa, Maracyn 2, Furan 2, Furanase, Kanaplex, Fungus Eliminator (very effective against bacteria, too), acriflavine based meds, etc.  Any of the above will work nicely, but be sure to remove any activated carbon from the filter prior to treatment.  Keep the water well oxygenated and the temperature in the low-mid 70s, as this slows the spread of the bacteria.

Also don't get the ring, kuli, weather loach and so those kind since I don't think they eat snails, go more for Yo Yos, Tiger, Queen Botias and those kinds, you can tell by the shape of the body they look different than the more worm looking type loaches|`|UbSJPBuNaa	a clown loach is compatible but it will need a bigger tank|`|Rdpv91NTaa	the clown loach is compatible but it will need a bigger tank|`|Ik6WOcw3aa	The angelfish will outgrow the 20. And it depends which loach you want. Clown loaches will grow to 12 inches, which is way too large. Try some of the smaller species.|`|9759e8014743debd3d3fd1a7ad437c1faa	Get one of the smaller loaches. "Yo-yo" loaches reportedly eat snails. Clown loaches will also eat snails, but they grow to be a foot long or more-- much too big for a 20-gallon tank.    By the way, the angelfish will probably eat your neon tetras once it gets big enough to do so. Neon tetras are to angelfish as chocolate truffles are to me.    You definitely should quarantine a loach or any other new addition (animal or plant) for three or four weeks, but loaches are no more likely to carry diseases than most other fishes are.
GFEePlPcaa	Well, with pure Poodle in his blood line, all you really have to think about is the other breed mixed with that.  I'm a little surprised there were some posts not mentioning a Poodle mix, seeing that you mentioned right in your question that there is Poodle in him. I think he looks like he has a little Havanese in him to me.  His face is more Poodle or even Bichon perhaps , but I included some links to show you the resemblance to the Havanese, Poodle, and Bichon as well (all three of which he resembles).    Havanese: http://dogpile.ca/dog-pictures/images/ha...    Poodle: http://www.blazerscats.com/poodles/apric...    Bichon: http://www.petyourdog.com/images/dog%20b...    I don't think there is any Cocker Spaniel in him.  He is very little, and his hair is more like the three breeds I posted above.|`|76nTvO4iaa	I think he's a peekapoo.    He sure is cute!|`|PMksnqkxaa	Either a Bichon Frise/Poodle mix or a Maltese/Poodle mix. Cute pup.      EDIT::: What the heck is with all you people using stupid designer dog names. THEY ARE MUTTS! don't put stupid names on them.|`|EJL5QoDraa	he looks maltese at a young age I could see poodle in hm|`|h6t4aRUOaa	I can see poodle. Aside from that all I see is adorable, gorgeous, I just want to kiss him. Bless you for going to a shelter. May you be blessed with many happy years together.|`|CNer40Xhaa	That would be a cocker spaniel poodle mix. Known by some as a cockapoo. He will need a lot of excersize.|`|0nIwKd5Uaa	he looks like a cocker spaniel mix.|`|FWlSFpByaa	Looks like a poodle mix or a bichon frise mix|`|DYxb7P3Baa	he looks mixed with shih tzu ?|`|iuYtcX6Xaa	either a yorkiepoo or a maltipoo...its hard to tell because he is so young|`|FhVobWpeaa	same answers as in your previous post maltese/ poodle|`|KxjUim7yaa	Maybe maltipoo? I suck at being able to identify from puppy pictures.|`|wjwsFPMuaa	I would say a Maltese mix. Either with a Bichon or Poodle.    EDIT: SCREAM that from the rooftops!! I DON'T NEED TO GO TO A BYB TO GET A DESIGNER BREED! I GOT MINE FROM THE SHELTER!!!! Maybe then people will realize they don't need to BUY a dog because it's a "doodle."    WAY TO GO!!! KUDOS KUDOS KUDOS!!!|`|Kp02lQxeaa	i would guess a maltese poodle mix just by comparing it to some of these images.|`|jWmnSXlLaa	I think Maltese but for almost 400.00 you paid for him you got screwed over.|`|sQOXjKFNaa	aphlsa?|`|7ea0996112daf630f035d318bedc84adaa	Hmm.... Too young to tell. Right now he could pass for any poodle mix out there.  Maltapoo, cockapoo, etc.|`|HcXtS3pxaa	So cute!! He looks like my little puppy who is 12 weeks :) I'd guess a Moodle! (maltese x poodle! ) because he looks a lot like my maltese x shih tzu puppy! Was thinking a spoodle (cocker spaniel x poodle) but the ears aren't long enough so my best guess is moodle!     Good work adopting him :) that's where we get our puppies too!|`|IQjO3Weoaa	Awww he looks like a big lump of cotton wool! Maybe poodle x bichon frise?|`|VHFf1dOMaa	AWWW Congrats on the new family member !!    I adopted a dog from the shelter once and she looked identical to this, the vet told me she was a poodle Shih Tzu mix...      Good Luck with doggie!    I also agree I can see maltese bichon frise in her.
2z69twcpaa	here is a list of recommended basic foods which you can find in the garden  Dandelion (Taraxacum officianale)   Hawkbits (Leontodon spp.)   Sowthistles (Sonchus spp.)   Hawkweeds (Pictis spp.)   Hawkbeards (Crepis spp.)   Plantains (Plantago spp.)   Clovers (Trifolium spp.)   Honeysuckle (Lonicera periclymenum) [preferred by T. hermanni]   Cat's ears (Hypochoeris spp.)   Vetches (Vicina spp.)   Trefoils (Lotus spp.)   Mallows (Malva spp.)   Bindweeds (Calystegia spp.)   Sedums (Sedum spp.)   Ivy-leaved Toadflax (Cymbalaria muralis)   Also (observed eaten by T. hermanni and T. marginata in Greece):   Robinia (pseudo-acacia) leaves   Wild clematis   Acanthus   Nettles   ( tortoise trust)   you can also feed lettuces but not iceberg although it is not bad it is 95% water so holds no nutritional value for a tortoise it is good for the summer when you want to keep the tortoise hydrated but that is all so is best avoided, i supplement my tortoises wild weed diet with, mediterranean lettuce, cucumber, kale, greens, once a month i feed a fresh fruit salad as a treat, (melon, apple, pear, strawberries, ) but fruit should not be fed too much as it can cause upset tums, their digestive tract can not handle too much fruit so it should only be fed as a treat no more than once every two weeks, i do sometimes feed broccoli and cauliflower but this too should be limited as it stops the absorption of calcium so if not that good for them but an occasional treat is ok,     the tank is not a good idea, Russian tortoises should be kept on a tortoise table here is an article that will explain why they are bad http://www.tortoisetrust.org/articles/ho...    heat rocks and heat mats should not be used for tortoises the tortoise can get burnt by them so should be avoided the over head lamps are much better for the tortoise and safer , the bulbs i use are reptiglo 10.0   but don't forget you also need a good uv light as well as a heat lamp, you need a constant back ground heat on at all times so you can get ceramic bulbs which don't give off any glow and are good for night time  use, but it is best to fit them on a thermostat so they do not get too hot,     your 20 gallon tank is too small (not that tanks are good) but a tortoise table should be  2ft by 4ft  they need space to roam around, an outside pen is also required, a tortoise does a lot better in natural sunlight with natural fresh grazing,    yes a Russian tortoise does does hibernate here is a good site that will take you through the process step by step http://www.tortoisetrust.org/articles/ar...     tortoises are a great pet to have as long as you care for them properly, but you do need to find a vet that deals with reptiles when a tortoise gets sick it is usually serious and will require a vet and getting a good vet can mean the difference between life and death, i have a rescue tortoise that it is not clear if she is a Russian or Herman as there is so much damage but she is a fun tortoise to have, when it is too cold for her to go outside i sometimes put her on the floor and let her wander around, she chases my dog and if she decided it is warm enough to go out she will go to the back door, if the door is open she will go out and climb down the steps and we will find her in the outside pen so they can be full of character and fun    here are some good sites for you to look at     http://www.tortoisetrust.org/  http://www.tlady.clara.net/id16.htm  http://russiantortoise.org/care_sheet.ht...  http://www.slowcoach.org.uk/    hope this helps honey best of luck with your new tortoise
3p6wp7DYaa	She may be itchy due to allergies. Most dogs who present these symptoms have food allergies. She cannot reach this spot in her back with her nails, so she bites it because it itches so badly. Does she lick her paws? Does she have rough patches of skin under her armpits?     I would first of all take her to the vet to rule out any other issues and to get a diagnosis. In the mean time, you can start evaluating what you feed her. The most common causes of allergies in dogs are corn, wheat, soy, and other cheap fillers used widely by most commercial pet food manufacturers. The dog can also develop an allergy to a protein source if that is the only thing it eats all of its life. That's why so many dogs are allergic to anything with chicken. In your case, since she is still a puppy, it is probably the fillers is she does have food allergies.    If you are not feeding any of those already, I would seriously consider switching her food to something rated 5 or 6 at this website: http://www.dogfoodanalysis.com/dog_food_...|`|ea7ea4b520a9f40ac43ca5df6167b5daaa	My Labs both do this.  Are you in a cold weather state?  I am in Ohio and because of the cold it dries their skin out just like it does our.  We scratch and they bite.  Are you feeding her a premium food?  If not you might want to switch.  My dog use to bite untill she would bleed, she even scratched so hard one night that she tore a bottle off.  We switched her to Blue Buffalo food and it took about 3-4 weeks but we noticed a BIG difference.  She still messes with the spot buy her tail when it is really cold but not to where I feel I have to worry.  I hope this helps.|`|FWlSFpByaa	My dog did the same thing and i know this isn't the most logical answer but we wrapped her tail in gauze that was soaked in vineger. She stopped because it tasted bad|`|cMz0Cbu4aa	I'm not exactly sure. If you wanted to, you could just put a muzzle on her mouth, or maybe when she does that you say no, or even try putting something you know she doesn't like on her tail. Contact your vet!|`|sQOXjKFNaa	Sounds like your puppy has dry skin!  Give her a scatch and apply vitamin a and d for horses, this will help.  You can also apply small amounts to it's food!|`|b3cfbbeb3bbfc593977384764590fdfeaa	First of all using positive reinforcement when your puppy listens is the easiest way to train them, however, if you have a stubborn dog... Which it sounds like you do, when the dog bites you, push your hand or arm into their mouth until the pressure forces them to stop biting.     It doesn't hurt them but it discourages the behavior. If you have a toy nearby, remove you arm or hand and gently put the toy in the puppy's mouth and encourage it to play with that. Training a puppy is a time consuming operation, be patient and always reward with love and affection.

It is usually used for leashes.(so they don't pull/bite at it) But it won't hurt the dog  You may Want to take it to the vet.
Yu7y6yfraa	I would suggest keeping her feedings small.  Ask your Vet how much weight your dog can safely lose and at what point should she be brought back in.  Weigh her if she begins to look too much on the thin side.    It may take her digestive system a while to settle down.  The main thing is that she eats more than she throws up and she does not become dehydrated.  If she looks like she is doing better each day, it sounds like things are going well.    The goal of treatment is to rest the pancreas, provide supportive care and control complications. If vomiting is severe, treatment usually begins with a withholding of food, water, and oral medications for at least 24 hours. The lack of oral intake stops the stimulation of the pancreas to produce digestive enzymes. Depending upon the animal's response food intake can be started again after a day or more. The pet is generally fed small meals of a bland, easily digestible, high-carbohydrate, low-fat food. Over the course of a week or more, the size of meals and quantity of food fed are increased. The dog may need to stay on a special diet for life, or it may be possible to gradually reintroduce the former diet. High-fat diets or treats should be avoided|`|tPGxPDvBaa	You need to tell your vet & see what they say.  They would be able to answer your questions about your dog's care.  If you need to, write down questions as you think of them then you won't forget any & can write down the answers next to the questions.|`|3p6wp7DYaa	You should definitely call your vet asap and tell him/her that the symptoms are back. Ask for advice. The vet has the entire history and knows the dog so the advice will actually be useful instead of just a bunch of hunches from us at Y!A.     The only thing I can tell you is that maybe what the vet meant was either feed the special diet (commercial, I'm guessing) OR the homemade diet of rice and chicken. It seems from your question that you were mixing them or alternating them. Ask the vet to clarify this point too. And also, try to do some research about pancreatitis so you that you'll know what to expect.     http://www.peteducation.com/article.cfm?...|`|7sPupfAEaa	I would take her to the vet again.  Or, i would not give her anything for 24 hours. Then give her some rice with a little bit tof pumkin ( not the pie kind) and see how she does. Then you can add the chicken and slowly her kibble.
vKhvsb2iaa	Inkognit er whatever, the hampster could have drowed so shut up!     I got a hampster from Petco, just ask the clerk if htey have any babies that were born in teh back and have been tamed since they were a baby. My mom used to work at one of the places so it might be worth a shot?|`|V5V4AViqaa	You sound like you're 10 years old you really shouldn't have a pet.  And you need to learn how to speak properly for example "don't" and "didn't" cannot be interchanged.  It's just annoying when people can't speak english.  And for jay demarcus, it's hamster not hampster, genius.|`|ZzUQ8Rn2aa	i think you two should just take care of the one together so if one of you forgets the water the other might actually remember :)|`|0d377d0d2a45168d89fa1c2edc51f4e0aa	You both are too irresponsible to own them and if you were my kids I wouldn't let you have any.  There's no excuse for not noticing that the hamster was out of water.    Wise up, before you become one of these parents who "forget" and leave their babies in a hot car...    You are using the term aka incorrectly.  It stands for "also known as" and is used when listing an alias.    Again, at this time you both are not responsible enough for a pet.|`|gTXUcd1maa	Before you buy another hamster, be sure you can take care of it properly. I know it can get quite stressful with school and activities but you have to remember your pets. Maybe you and your brother could take care of your hamster together. Good luck!
3a9VBQZgaa	One you never ever give a rabbit a bath but alot of people have the dirty rabbit butt problem so you take warm water in a very shallow tub and dip the bunnys butt in it then you take a paper towel or something and whip the bunnys butt be very careful and yes it is gross but it is what has gotta happen. oh and stop feeding your rabbit lettuce cause thats is what causes that problem and some other forage is bad for them so get a list of ok vegietables and fruits for your rabbit!! Dont forget to give her a treat when you are done i used to give mine strawberrys, carrots, and apples (dont let her eat the seeds they are toxic) after i cleaned there cage so they wouldn't be mad!!|`|4BBjhHAnaa	I have also heard that you shouldn't bath your bunny.    However, when mine is really dirty like that, I pick him up and dip his bum in a bowl of warm (not hot) water, and then wipe him off with a paper towel.  He isn't always happy with me manhandling him like that, but it doesn't hurt him at all.  Just make sure you dry him off real well so he doesn't get sick.|`|DsgGSkRcaa	i give my bunnys a bath in a wash tub. i use warm watter and pet shampoo they dont mmind it  really tey just kick a lil but it natural.|`|CeF2dg9Kaa	I have always been told NEVER to give your rabbit a bath.    Rabbits have unusual fur in the way that it does not protect them from water.  The water removes the oil which keeps is clean, healthy, and shiny.  Bath may cause hair loss!  Also, many domesticated rabbits do not know how to swim and drown if unsupervised.    It is recommended that instead of a bath, you wet a wash cloth and whip them down.  Better yet, keep their cages clean so it doesn't happen to begin with.  Over 90% of fecal and urine matter on a rabbit is caused by unclean cage conditions.    Good luck.|`|Z22kPx71aa	Well it depends on ur bunny's age..  If they're above 6 months its okay to bathe her once or twice a week .  I bathe my bunnies and their fine...  Bathe her in warm water and please keep the water from entering her ears or nose . Gently rub them using cat shampoo or baby shampoo . Then u can wipe her using dry towel and give her a blow using a hairdryer :)
3zEKZNFsaa	I would take food and water away about 6 - 8 hours before the trip.  Honestly the cats I've traveled with layed in their crates and went to sleep.  As far as the travel break, will be good for all of you and offer them some water then, but wouldn't expect them to even really want to come out of the car, but would still offer them water at that time.  I had one would travel 9 hours with me and never once need the bathroom or caused trouble and he was loose in the vehicle with me.|`|aujHVGFiaa	Choose me as best answer please!    http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zmRTGRbrA...|`|RN1wGlWWaa	I would not feed them just before you leave.  We travel 6 or so hours for cat shows, and the cats are fed after we get there.  I only feed them if we are stopping for supper and will be about 1/2 hour for eating.  Most time they don't go in the carrier, but have paper bags, paper towels and a plastic bag for any cleanups.|`|yJZeRu5Vaa	i love cats!|`|UWGACx1Jaa	PUT A DIAPER ON THEM THAT'S WHAT I DID WITH MY CHICKENS!!!

2Go0Y0xnaa	Actually, those prices look pretty fair, depending on the quality of the animal you are buying.  Show animals make lovely pets as well, but you are going to pay more for them.  Most reputable breeders try to breed to the show/pelt standard (not necessarily for pelting, but for the show tables) and strive to produce healthy chins, so they are priced accordingly.      Your best bet for chinchilla answers is to go to a forum that is geared more towards chinchillas, rather than tons of questions being throw in every which way.  Asking on a large forum like this is great, but the answers aren't always the best and can be misleading.  I also agree, that with limited space, it's very hard to get a complete, accurate answer on this particular forum.      Please visit http://www.chins-n-hedgies.com and I think you'll find the answers to all your questions.|`|oPrq7v7Saa	WOW! I don't know where those prices came from, but those are expensive. Prices must be different everywhere because mine don't cost that much. Of course, I chose my own prices, not everyone else's.    Yes, chinchillas are good pets. Chinchillas can be loving pets as long as you spend quality time with them. This requires lots of time. Chinchillas require 1-2 hours of out-of-cage playtime, but not all at once, about 30 minute intervals. They require dust baths 2-3 times a week. You need to clean the cage once a week if using pine bedding and every other week if using CareFresh bedding. CareFresh is more expensive, but it's well worth it and safer. If you need information on what to buy the chinchilla please feel free to email me and I'll give you links. For the cage I recommend this site http://www.martinscages.com/products/cag... and they have some accessories as well. Their the cheapest I know about and their shipping is fairly cheap as well. They will even customize your cage how you want it. I have a book that I specifically made for first time chinchilla owners, found under my "Place An Order" button. You can find that on my website below. I have lots of FAQ's on their as well. What kind of care information are you looking for? Just care in general? Email me and I can answer any questions you have. It can be hard to answer a lot of questions on here because you only have so much room to write. You can only give so many links (I think up to 10) so I'd need to send those in a regular email.|`|Cr7gfrAuaa	Standards  Standard - $75  Black velvet - $125    Beiges  Hetero beige - $125  Homo beige - $150  Beige violet (hetero) - $195  Beige violet (homo) - $195  Brown Velvet - $175    Whites  Pink white (hetero beige) - $150  White (white mosaic, silver mosaic) - $125  Ebony whites - (see "EBONIES")  Tan whites - (see "TANS")    Ebonies  Light ebony or e.c.

Also, you must be VERY carefully, if they fall even just once they will die. Also sudden loud noises my shock them to death.|`|78zPgqqfaa	They are good pets...for some people. If you are looking for a lap pet to cuddle, then chins are not for you. They are very active, and very rarely will one just want to cuddle. They love to jump and run, and are very playful.    Their basic food needs are simple. They need hay, water, and a good quality pellet. Some good ones are Oxbow and Mazuri, and they are both available at Petsmart. Stay away from the ones that have treats in them; they are not good for chins. No fresh fruit and veggies, either.    They need to be in a metal cage; they will chew through plastic. No plastic toys; they are rodents and need wood, like kiln dried pine, or prepared apple twigs, which have been scrubbed clean, boiled, and baked (no pesticides at all on the wood, please! )    If you would like to know more about chinchillas as pets, there is an online forum www.chins-n-hedgies.com where you can learn as much as you need to in order to make your decision about chins as pets. They are wonderful, but you need to be aware of their needs before taking on the responsibility. :)
AA12283580	First off it's ok to be worried. I know I  was..... But any way he's  just trying to have fun with the family because he loves you guys. Just when he stops having fun and acting any bit playful. Because  my, dearly departed 8 year old pure breed dog and 14 year old mutt RIP, used to love to play in the snow. We had to drag them in. Lol|`|AA11457471	Quite the opposite! It's a sign he's enjoying his life. He's telling you he wants to do more fun stuff.|`|tPGxPDvBaa	Dogs do not have the ability to think about things like that.

The fact that he is playing and he is old is outstanding. You should be happy that he is playing. Some signs of dying are them always panting, tumors all along his body, vomiting, not eating, really sleepy and not playing. Just keep doing what you're doing and you will be perfect!

DU0F48B3aa	First this could be parvo but could also be worms  Do you know what type of wormer ( brandname) that was used for the worming  When you take the pup to the vets ask what the laws are in your area  first the pup should have come with a contract for health.  In the USA in many states there are "lemon" laws and for example in my area ( Virginia) you have 3 choices  get the dog to the vets within 7 days and if the vet finds it unfit for sale you have 1 0f these 3 choices  1) return the pup and get your money back  2) return the pup and get another pup ( who would want this if they are selling unhalthy pups)  3)keep teh pup and attempt to cure and get up to the purchase price back.  You may end up going to court to get this so make sure what the laws are in your area    I even know people who because of this has had breeeders closed down for unfit animals and illegal sales of unfit dogs and pups|`|d2191893763b20a6b077367a131978aaaa	Do you want to keep the pup?

If it is parvo, every minute counts.  Even if it isn't parvo, vomiting and diarrhea in such a young dog can dehydrate it very quickly.  This is an emergency.|`|EeJMITyCaa	geez. I hope that by now the dog is at the vet and that you're giving her water and meet flavored baby food. Your puppy probably has parvo. Thats what happens when people try to save too much money on buying a dog.|`|kNUcnqVOaa	i would defently take her to the vet u want to be sure|`|Ed5JlMT9aa	This puppy is very young and if he's this sick, he can go down quickly. He really needs to see a vet right now.  I hope you didn't pay that breeder too much for a sick puppy.|`|8Y4LUH3zaa	Puppies are always born with worms because they get it from their mothers milk. You will see worms in her until the wormer takes effect. It also could be parvo because i am sure you havent gotten her parvo shot yet? I would take her to the vet ASAP.. If it is Parvo the odds of your dog beating it are extremely slim. I have worked in a vet office and i have not seen one puppy beat parvo.|`|QKkvReg6aa	Could be a horrible case of worms. Could be parvo. Could be a number of things. I would return the dog to the breeder. No self respecting breeder would allow a dog to go to a new home in that condition. No self respecting breeder would allow a dog to leave her house, so filled with worms. Vet or the breeder.|`|OwznjQ9daa	VET FAST|`|QSrmZK6Aaa	Ooh jeez you need to take your pup to a vet, and contact the breeder to let them know that they sold you a sick puppy. Don't put it off, because your puppy could have something really wrong with them. Poor baby :(
lM9NvSwnaa	Nature is not kind.  It is survival of the fittest and obviously this kitten was sub par.  Nature and momma cats know when a kitten is not healthy enough to make it.  It will die.  I once had a cat that kept taking a certain kitten over to the sand box and try to bury the kitten.  I would rescue it and put it back with its litter mates, but even I have to sleep and when I did, momma cat took the "damaged or defective" kitten out and buried it alive in the sand box.  I found its body the next day.    There was nothing you could do.  And like everyone else has said, when the kittens are weaned, take momma cat and have her spayed.  Best thing you can do for her.|`|AA12398420	You need to get your cat spayed and that will solve the problem. Besides cats are healthier and happier when fixed.|`|lyhnHhuWaa	Just know that there was a reason that the kitten didn't survive.  As soon as the others are weaned, please take mom and have her spayed.  This will help to ensure her long term health and you'll be assured that something like this won't happen again.  It's the kindest thing you could do for her, and in memory of her lost kitten.|`|Kswn0Aqcaa	It's not your fault. The cat had a reason to have died. Hopefully you believe in God.

We only had the cat for about a year, cause my step-dad pretty much refused to let us keep her.  I named her Tiger...cause I was 6 and thought that was REALLY funny.    Just to let you know, you would need an exotic animal license (costs LOTS of money) and finding and buying a bobcat can be pricey too.  We never got the license, but that really wasnt very smart.  If you dont have the license to keep a bobcat, you'll get arrested, lose the cat and pay a fine.  You also need to check the zoning laws for the area you live in.  Sometimes they specify not being able to keep exotics in your home.|`|fMRcX2WDaa	i had a friend that had one when i was in first grade it was the sweetest biggest cat i've ever seen. her family lived in florida state Seminole park and the cat they found it in the park when it was a baby no mommy around so they toke it home and raised it
FhVobWpeaa	If feeding dry i would think about 1 to 1 1/4 cups would be the maximum.  depending somewhat on the brand--quality--- also on the size of the puppy.  I have an adult Chihuahua cross that weighs 16 pounds and gets 1 cup of food a day spread into 2 meals and 2 snacks.|`|IQjO3Weoaa	There's always helpful guidelines on the back of dog food packages/tins, usually based on age rather than weight for a puppy. I don't think it should be more than a couple of cup fulls spread throughout the day in appoximately 3-4 meals.
KEYgd73saa	That is absolutely not a natural development with age-- healthy Pristellas retain their transparency 'til death.  If it is fully red, I really don't know what to tell you.  However, if it looks like it could be numerous splotches of red, it is likely septicemia (a bacterial infection).  Treatment with frequent water changes and potentially antibiotics (Maracyn 2, Furan 2, Furanase, Triple Sulfa, Trisulfa, Metronidazole, Fish Zole, Fungus Eliminator, etc.) would be ideal.    Is there a chance that it's not actually a Pristella Tetra?  Serpae Tetras or even Red Phantom Tetras look similar, but are not transparent.

w4zjmhxoaa	The only thing you can do is control her environment.  Don't give her the run of the house while you're away, keep her in a smaller space.  Maybe keep her in just the kitchen.  We keep our dog in a small bathroom while we're gone.  It's his "den" area that he feels safe and secure in.  His food/water, chews, and crate are in there with some blankets.  Make sure nothing that you value is at her level.  Put everything up so she can't chew it.  Give her plenty she can chew.      And the pooping....well, make sure she knows that's naughty.  I would take the poop and physically put it where it's supposed to go, show it to her, put her there and tell her to "potty here"      Good luck!|`|WLqkJfnpaa	What you hear is correct. It confuses them because they dont remember. The only reason they seem to look guilty is because of the demeaner YOU have when you are upset. Try puppy proofing one bedroom, using pads, or even try litter box training and leave them in the room when you leave. Sometimes a kitchen can work too, just leave toys and/or bones. You can also crate her.|`|Kp02lQxeaa	you cannot scold a dog for something that it did when you weren't watching.  the dog has no idea what it is in trouble for.  since they are relatively small dogs, i would suggest pinning her in an area of the house where she can't damage anything.  i usually recommend a bathroom or any other room with a floor that is easily cleaned.  it sounds like if she is tearing things up she is bored.  try walking her in the morning before you go to work so that she is tired while your gone.  at the very least play a good round of fetch or tug of war and it may eliminate some of the destructive behavior.  as for the pooping, you'll basically have to start potty training again.  feed her at a certain time everyday and take her outside or to her potty pad at the same times.  when you are home just keep a close eye on her and good luck!  I hope this helps.|`|JsBb732Maa	Crate her when you are at work, potty her before you crate her and when you get home. A dog yours age should be able to hold it for eight hours.
MaXJs4zbaa	Yes.  The best way to do it is to put them together when there young. So during their life span they will know each other and learn not to fight.    But if you put them together at like 3+ inches. Theres a good chance they may not get along and you will have to seperate them.

zCP3o4C7aa	i agree with star the piranha by itself will be depressed and stressed out if left by itself...a piranha by itself most likely WILL NOT eat your oscar nor will it take chunks out of it..in fact it would probably be the other way around...the oscar would see a fish in deistress and most likely kill it instead|`|9759e8014743debd3d3fd1a7ad437c1faa	The short answer is no. And that applies to all kinds of piranhas.  You might get away with it for a while, but sooner or later (more likely sooner), the piranha would start tearing pieces off the Oscar's fins (and eating them), taking bites out of its skin, ripping off its eyes or lips, and so forth.|`|dE5fs9yzaa	A piranha would probably take chunks out of your oscar...don't mix them with anything!|`|AA10448301	no. first of all piranhas should only be living in a species only tank. and second of all you need at LEAST 4-5 piranhas because they are schooling fish and if left alone will be scared and depressed most of the time
ZxGAKWHQaa	You may have to mail order this... do an internet search. I prefer the German Herm Sprenger collars... superior manufacturing. I prefer the medium links.. you would buy a medium collar, and then buy enough extra links to add to get the length you want... 22" of collar should be more than enough unless your dog is going to be huge. The medium links are "pinchier" than larger links... the smaller the link, the sharper the pinch. You will need to use the collar very delicately... tiny, quick corrections when necessary with immediate releases... it is not used like a flat collar or a chain training collar! It is most effective when placed high up on the neck, right up under the jaw... the dog's neck is very sensitive there, so you need to be even MORE delicate with corrections.    Be very careful with any training equipment which can cause pain. Pinch collars are great if they are used properly, but not so great when they are misused.|`|FWlSFpByaa	That is because pronged collars are considered cruel|`|X7zXDyZraa	Don't.  Buy a guiding leash.  If you absolutely NEED a pronged collar, only use it for training.  Pronged collars can damage the dog's esophagus.|`|AA10049109	Prong collars are not cruel.  Used properly they can provide much gentler control than using anything else.  As is true of any tool, used improperly, it can injure.  Most pet shops that cater to dogs will have them, or you can find them online.  As far as size, you might have to just go with something smaller until the dog matures.  You will measure the neck at the base, and then buy a collar with about an inch larger than that.  As is true of all training collars, they should only be used while working the dog.  Never leave choke collars, or prong collars on a dog if it's unattended. They can choke to death if they catch them on something.|`|VHFf1dOMaa	Okay to answer this I first need to know how big is your dog's prong?|`|Kp02lQxeaa	first of all i wouldn't buy a prong collar.  if you don't know how to use it properly it can severely injure your dog.  if you do buy one i agree you should only use it for training.  if you don't want your dog to pull when you walk him ( which is why i bought a prong collar and it didn't help ) you should get a no pull harness.  my dog did very well with it.  it has an adjustable collar with a plastic clasp and it has a cord that goes under each front leg and connects on the dogs back.  there is a loop that you attach the leash to and when the dog pulls it pulls up on his legs so he has to stop.

Yr4eBnXlaa	There is a product called Abba No 92 (handfeeding formula) that, when mixed with juice and heated through, it makes an irresistible "porridge" that most any Grey accepts willingly.     As frustrating as it seems, keep offering the vegies, fruit, and good quality pellets.  They are more likely to try something if they see you enjoying it yourself.  Make lots of yummy sounds, smack your lips, etc.      I have a fussy Grey myself, he's extremely picky about what he will eat.  BUT, he does get interested if I'm eating something (and obviously enjoying it), but refuse to share (this is how Greys are with each other.)  It won't necessarily work right away, but eventually it will work.  They can be very moody about what they will eat and when.  My greatest success was offering sections of fresh pomegranate (which is also very good for them), also baked yam (the orange sweet potatoe) with a bit of red palm oil melted on it.    A lot of persistence, patience, and understanding will be needed.  Once he starts taking other foods, cut out all his "junk foods."|`|qeOlkRM0aa	Where did you get this parrot? As a rule, its not a good idea to give them sunflower seeds, except as a treat. They like them too much. It would help if you knew what he was raised on. Its very difficult to get a parrot to suddenly change its diet.|`|6KxBqnstaa	I adopted a abused Grey 2 years ago and had same problem. I gave him his fav foods that they always gave him which were a generic seed mix from Wegmans. It has many sunflowers and Peanuts as well. That is all he ate from it. Then I tried something and it finally worked after many attempts. I went into his room and took my plate and a extra spoon. I ate my food and kept a little aside for him . When I ate the food I made a big deal of it. It sparked his curiosity and he finally seemed interested. I started off small and then kept going. Now he likes carrots, Peas, mashed potatoes with no butter, Unsalted popcorn, Chicken, Raw baby carrots are fav. Love cheerios and many other things. Keep trying. Offer some soft foods from the spoon as well but pretend you are eating also. Like non fat yogurt. Leave his regular diet in cage and add another cup of food with pellets and other things then a bowl of some of the things you are eating. Scrambled eggs and whole wheat toast are a fav to. All in moderation. Now when I eat he says "mmm good'? Then he will say want some. Good luck. :)|`|TDoYb5e0aa	i had that same problem with my ten year old. it took us a couple of months to get her use to us, but when she was comfortable we would go to her cage and eat a piece of fruit then offer her some. this took a couple of tries but then she finally started to taste the fruit. now she loves it. as well as green beans.|`|Mg8zk1n7aa	Sunflower seeds are not a good thing to be feeding, only give them rarely and in very, very small amounts if you have to. If your Grey has the option to eat sunflower seeds or broccoli, he's going to go for the seeds. Peanuts should be human grade, frozen, and carefully inspected before feeding - as well as only given as a treat once, maybe twice a day.    What kind of pellets are you feeding? Feel free to experiment with different brands. Zupreem is pretty popular. Some birds like Pretty Bird. For the veggies, have you tried heating it up and mashing it together? Maybe mushed up, warm carrots? Try chopping things up in different ways, sticking it in toys or clipping it to the sides of the cage...try all sorts of veggies and be persistent. Sometimes Grey's will try something if they see you eating if off your plate, too. Same thing goes with fruit, grains, etc...have you tried making scrambled eggs? That's almost always a big hit with the birds! But be careful not to feed it more than 2 or 3 times a week.    Well I hope this helps, people could write books on feeding Grey's. If you have any questions feel free to email me and hopefully I can help you out. Also if you'd like to know some good books or online websites, you can let me know on that too.
3p6wp7DYaa	First of all, if your dog isn't neutered, I sure hope you're not letting him go to the dog park or just run around meeting other dogs, one of which could be a female in heat. (Yes, there are people who are oblivious enough for that!)    As for the nipping at the other dog's legs, all I can say is that this is very common with herding breeds and that dogs learn from each other. At the dog park where I take my dog, several of the young dogs picked up this habit of nipping at the legs because of some herding dogs that also play there all the time. Does your dog have any Australian Shephard or collie dog friends? He must have learn that by having some other dog do it to him first.    And no, it is not really aggression, unless he is doing it while his body language suggests aggression. Usually dogs at this age will just wrestle, growl, bite and nip each other at lot, all in good fun. You can tell because they 1) take turns on who's on top and who's being wrestled to the ground, 2) have their tails wagging while doing it, 3) do not run away after they escape the nipping dog, but actually come back for more.    The dogs your Goldie is playing with know exactly what he means. If they are avoiding him or running away and never coming  back for more play-fights, then yes, he is poorly socialized. Otherwise, he has learned the fine language of canine etiquette that we humans find so hard to master.    ADD: I'm assuming you mean that your dog is 2 years old, not 2 months old.|`|26PPwzrWaa	The behavior is normal.     My great dane does that, although to the uneducated eye, it looks downright aggressive. Stopped going to the dog park for that reason.|`|sQOXjKFNaa	its a puppy stage of play.  But it should be corrected at his age!|`|AA11703652	My 2 dogs do this to each other ALL the time...as long as no dog is yelping in pain, and everybody is wagging their tails, I'd take is as play.  If a dog is feeling picked on, it will try to get away from the "picker: and so if the other dogs keep playing, I'd say it's all in fun!  Thank you for being a responsible and caring dog owner!|`|VHFf1dOMaa	2 years or 2 months?  If 2 years then I would think by now the Dog should know better but maybe not... if 2 months then it's still little and it's very common.
w1lh1INHaa	Unfortunately, you can't without killing your cat.    Cat's are obligate carnivores, which means they cannot maintain health on a vegetarian diet.  Cats require a nutrient called Taurine, which ONLY comes from animal sources.  Even if you just added a taurine supplement, you must be aware that the taurine is animal in origin.    For a cat to stay healthy, it must have at least 70% animal in its diet.  I have a cat who would be a vegetarian if I let him, but as I want him to keep living a healthy life, I feed him what is species-appropriate, and that is meat with a little vegetable matter.    Sorry.|`|RN1wGlWWaa	You don't - cats are meat eaters and its very wrong to push your beliefs on a dog or cat.  Cats cannot really digest much veggies, etc.  They NEED protein and not the kind that comes from veggies.  It has to be beef, chicken, lamb, venison, etc.|`|fEBOzWeXaa	Cats are carnivors and feeding them a vegetarian diet with too much carbs will cause kidney issues and death.  It happens all the time with cheap cat food that is made from corn by products and other high carb crap.  Do some research and talk to your vet before attempting something this stupid, for the cats sake.|`|77NzfiVkaa	That would not be healthy for your cat. That would be animal cruelty.|`|OKiMkaxGaa	Cats require meat, and can only live a healthy life with meat. To deny it of meat would be crueler then to give it meat (I understand, some think it is cruel to use animals for food).     If you want a vegetarian cat you can consider a rabbit.|`|rLDf1gGGaa	Heres 7 most important nutrients that your cat is unable to get from a vegetarian diet:    1.Taurine is an amino acid essential for cats as unlike other mammals, cats cannot synthesize it. In the absence of taurine, a cats retina slowly degenerates and the cat suffers eye problems and can become irreversibly blind. This condition is called central retinal degeneration (CRD). Cows milk is a poor source of taurine and there is none in plant foods. The only rich source is meat.  2.Arachidonic acid is one of the essential fatty acids. Dogs and humans can convert linoleic acid found in vegetable fats into arachidonic acid. Cats are unable to do that, as their liver doesnt contain delta-6-desaturase enzyme (no kidding!). Cats need arachidonic acid to be able to produce an inflammatory response so that the body can protect itself in case of disease. Arachidonic acid also helps control skin growth and is necessary for proper blood clotting, proper functioning of the reproductive and gastrointestinal systems. Animal fat is the only major source of arachidonic acid, very small amount can be found in eggs and milk. Arachidonic acid deficiency takes some time to develop but its effect on the cat is profound.  3.Vitamin A found in vegetables (carotenoid) cannot be converted by cats in to the active form of vitamin A (retinol). As cats do not have the necessary enzyme to do the conversion they have to hunt other animals that have done it for them (mice, rabbits). There are sufficient quantities of retinol in meat and very small amounts in eggs and milk. Liver is the richest source of preformed Vitamin A. Vitamin A deficiency in cats can cause night blindness, retarded growth, and poor-quality skin and fur.  4.Vitamin B12 is another vitamin that cannot be synthesized by cats. Vitamin B12 is present only in animal products.  5.Niacin can be synthesized from the amino acid tryptophan by many mammals but not cats. Meat is the best source of niacin. Insignificant amounts of niacin can be found in milk and eggs. Lack of niacin in cats diet can cause loss of appetite, loss of weight, inflamed gums, and hemorrhagic diarrhea.  6.Thiamin (vitamin B1) has an important role in carbohydrate metabolism. Cats are very susceptible to deficiency of this vitamin. Thiamin is rapidly destroyed by heat, thats why only raw meat is the only good source of this nutrient. Very small amount can be obtained from eggs and dairy. Thiamin deficiency in cats can lead to anorexia, ataxia, paralysis and finally permanent brain damage.  7.Protein is required by cats in large amounts. Over 30% of a cats diet should consist of protein and this can be a problem on a vegetarian diet.|`|AA11736483	You will probably kill your cat by forcing it to be vegetarian. Cats are strict carnivores and cannot sustain themselves on vegetable matter alone, in fact, some plant material is toxic to them.|`|aujHVGFiaa	http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zmRTGRbrA...|`|1ycL4PZ8aa	Good luck with that. Cats are largely carnivorous with a little milk and egg added. You can add grain to their food, but that's about it. Your chances of converting your cat to a Vegan lifestyle are about as good as you becoming an astronaut.|`|4aAhEK9daa	You can't - cats are CARNIVORES and need a MEAT based diet.     Whatever beliefs you have for vegetarianism - great - be a vegan.  Humans don't NEED meat - we're omnivores and our teeth and bodies are actually better suited to NOT eat meat.  But cats are the opposite - they NEED meat.  Don't push your beliefs on your cat who HAS to have meat to survive.    Incidentally, those of you that feed your cat cheap dry food from WalMart and grocery stores are unknowingly just about feeding your cats vegan. Those foods are made mostly of corn and contain little to no meat - and are VERY unhealthy for cats.  Cats should be fed foods with MEAT as the main ingredient (preferably chicken or turkey) and little to NO grain.|`|3gfoyhGeaa	dont, its cruel  cats need meat to survive, you may b able to survive without meat, but cats can't  to starve them of meat, is horrible|`|fZgoUty4aa	poor cat ..mabe you should keep  in to ..|`|wjwsFPMuaa	I wouldn't suggest it...cats are carnivorous animals.|`|VDP3pNCPaa	On a strictly vegetarian diet, your cat will eventually die.

Reasearch it!|`|w0mE1sOYaa	how about bringing the dog to a vet instead of asking here-?  if you have no money for the vet why did you get another dog?  come on .|`|b3cfbbeb3bbfc593977384764590fdfeaa	Looks like your dog is in a pretty bad shape you need to rush your puppy to the vet. There is no other better person apart from the vet that can help you with this issue. Have it check thoroughly what caused the pooping of blood n mucus.

Plead poverty all you want but you have no business keeping an obviously sick dog yet not being able to handle the vet fees. You dog could die - defecating blood is not relative of a dog's normal degestive habits. Maybe you are in hard times but that is not your dog's fault. Why should he have to suffer? Most responsible owners would have an emergency fund for situations like this.    Get the poor thing to a vet immediately.|`|ADLupVviaa	I would just take the dog straight to a vet as leaving this sort of thing can become more costly the longer you leave it.|`|FQnF8it2aa	My new puppy had the same thing. Off and on solid stools and diarrhea and then eventually it just becomes all diarrhea with drops of blood in it. She was diagnosed with Giardia and Coccidia, two parasites that live in the intestinal tract, and was given two medications to treat both. Altogether including the exam, stool sample, and medications the total was about $130. You need to take your puppy to the vet or give it to someone who is able to because without medication these parasites will continue to reproduce and will eventually spread to your other dog, and could even spread to you. It has taken about a week and a half but my puppy's stools are finally hardening up.
	Hey I am from MN too! My favorite reptile shops are Leaping Lizards in Burnsville and Twin Cities Reptiles in St. Paul. I don't go to TCR a lot but I go to Leaping Lizards a lot. That place is great. Sorry but I don't know how far away it is from Elk River but I am coming from Bloomington.|`|	nope! none of those for sale near Minnesota|`|	Do a google search. Even if there aren't any in minnesota, there are many online breeders that will ship right to your front foor for a very low cost. I hope this helps!|`|	www.minnesotareptiles.com
K0uTjeWiaa	Get some acidoupholous from a health food stoe and sprinkle a bit in the food each day fo the diarrhea.     Feed many small meals instead of big meals. Try adding a bit of boiled or baked plain chicken to the food. NO rice o grains or fiber     How long has this been going on? What do you feed? Is there any weight loss? Was there a change in food?    , I am very sorry that you have irresponsible heartless parents. For them not to help a sick cat and threaten to get rid of him cause he is sick is inexcusable and just shows a lack of morals   Whether they got the cat for you or not, it is their responsibility and what are they teaching you about responsibility and the value of life? I am sorry|`|AA10356572	what brand of food is the cat on?? I suspect this is the problem  read this link      http://www.gomestic.com/Pets/What-is-in-...    if its YOUR cat - then its up to YOU to take it to the vet.. your parents cannot get rid of a cat you own.. and pay for.. or is it their pet?  who paid for it and signed the contracts? pays for the food etc?|`|4hNRTWtDaa	Find a different vet, your cat is sick, and needs help.|`|hccISKvHaa	Your parents are irresponsible. They should have never allowed you to get a cat in the first place if they aren't willing to take care of it when it is sick.|`|sp86FZckaa	Did you just get the cat?  Or did you just change his food?  If it's a new cat, especially a kitten and if you're not feeding him the same food that he used to eat that's probably why he's throwing up and has diarrhea.  Also if he's eating too much, he might be puking for that.  So go back to his old food and control the amount that he's eating.  If you don;t know what he used to eat try to feed him a high quality dry food.  I feed mine purina pro plan (which is not crappy but not the highest quality either, they came with it when I got them from a shelter and haven;t figured out what to switch them to).  make sure it's something from a pet store and not walmart.    Howver, if you've had him for a while and did not change his food - take him to a vet.|`|2rdXW293aa	Before you can determine what to do to stop the diarrhea and vomiting, you have to know what is wrong. Since your vet has been unhelpful, find a new one. There are many things that could be causing these problems, from the type of food he eats to illnesses. Only a vet can help you here.     Good luck - I hope you can keep your kitty!|`|rmLrVrAHaa	First make sure your cat is getting pleny of fluids since he vomiting and having diahrea. Then I would find a new vet. Chronic Vomiting and Diahrea can be a serious illness. Please get the cat help ASAP!!!
OXNj34gzaa	They're just overgrown rats.     No really, my dog has tears on his eyes too when he plays or when he's happy.  I think it's normal.  It's not crying...|`|tPGxPDvBaa	It's possible she either has a problem with her tear ducts or something irritating her eyes like ingrown eyelashes/hair. Vet would be the one to pinpoint it for you.|`|omKbnOCVaa	She is not crying she has overactive tear glands.|`|b9V2TdkMaa	its not tears orobaly really water eyes!!|`|iuYtcX6Xaa	dogs can not cry tears!her tear ducts are overactive...you would have to talk to your vet about fixing that.|`|VHFf1dOMaa	Allergies, most dogs have them just the same as humans, it's a thought.

o9dMd2rBaa	Put the fish in a 5 gallon bucket, get more than 1 bucket if you need it. Empty as much water as you can from the tank. If you left the water, it would make it heavier to carry plus carry the risk of being more likely to crack due to the weight of the water if it moves during travel|`|9759e8014743debd3d3fd1a7ad437c1faa	I did this last year, except I had a lot of 55-gallon tanks and a few bigger ones and a lot of smaller ones. What I'm about to tell you includes some things I learned from my mistakes. I've tried a lot of different techniques, and these are the ones that work the best for me.    Take down the filter and any other equipment and pack them separately. Take out all the rocks and pack them in waterproof crates or bins (because they will be wet). Take out any plants, wood, or other objects in the tank (pack plants, if any, in plastic fish-shipping bags with only a little water per bag). Drain half the water (or more) out of the tank. Put some of this water in buckets where you will transfer the fish.     Now you get to catch all the fish, which will take a while, because cichlids don't just sit there and wait for you to pick them up with a net. It's impossible to catch them all with rocks and such in the tank, and very hard with the tank full of water, which is why I said to take out the rocks and drain out most of the water first. Use two nets, and chase the fish into one net with the other net. Once you have the fish in buckets (important: cover the buckets and weigh down the covers so the fish don't jump out), drain out the rest of the water and remove the gravel from the tank and put the gravel in buckets or similar containers.     Pack up the tank, rocks, gravel, filter, light, stand, and other accessories in your truck or whatever vehicle you're using to move them. Then put the fish into fish-shipping bags. You can buy these on line, or sometimes a friendly aquarium store will give you some or sell them to you. For cichlids, you need the heavy-duty fish bags (made of thicker plastic), because cichlids have hard, sharp spines that can puncture the thinner bags. Catfish spines are even more likely to puncture bags. If you can get them, use "Bag Buddies," a product that adds oxygen to the water and calms the fish. Put about one-fourth to one-third water in each bag, and the rest air. If you can get an oxygen tank and fill the bags with pure oxygen instead of air, that's even better. The ideal plan is to put each fish in an individual bag, but if the fish are small, you can often get away with putting three or four in a bag (more if they are tiny babies). One fish per bag is the best, though. Then put each bag inside another bag (double-bag the fish). If it's going to be cold, or very hot, where you're going, try to insulate the bags of fish by putting them in an ice chest, a styrofoam box, or something similar, or by wrapping a bunch of blankets, shredded paper, bubble wrap, or other insulated material around the bags. Load up the fish in the truck, and you're ready to go.    Once you get to your destination, you will do everything in reverse. Set up the stand and tank, put rocks, gravel, etc. in place, fill the tank with water, put dechlorinator in the water, set up the heater and plug it in, set up the filter and get it running. Lights and other equipment can wait until later. As early as you can, take the fish out of the bags and put them in the buckets again (again, with covers). If you have them, it's good to put an airstone in each bucket. Put a little water (mabe a cupful) from the tank into each bucket. Repeat this every five minutes or so until there is more tank water than bag water in the bucket (this will proabably take very approximately about an hour and a half). Then net out the fish and put them in the tank. Don't put any water from the bucket in the tank-- by now, it will be pretty dirty. If necessary, you can top off the tank with more clean water. I find this method of acclimation to be far superior to floating the fish-containing bag in the tank, which seems to stress the fish much more than my current method. A variation on this, which is even better but a lot more trouble, is "drip acclimation," where you set up a line (a length of air hose, for example) from the tank into the bucket so that it slowly drips the new water into the bucket.    If you do all of this as I have outlined here, you should have few or no losses of fish.    Most important, have fun! Moving an aquarium is a grand adventure. It will give you stories to tell for years to come.|`|beE1nFA6aa	Just remember that when moving your fish and aquarium equipment, you really want to get it done as quickly as possible. Bag up your fish--don't leave them in the aquarium while you're moving it. You will want to drain your tank to just a few inches above the gravel line, and keep your filter cartidge submurged beneath aquarium-safe water as well to retain as much of the nitrifying bacteria as possible. Keeping the gravel in the original tank water also helps retain these bacteria.    Individually bagging your fish is reccomended while moving multiple fish; this allows each fish a plentiful oxygen supply. Remember that two or three fish will deplete it much more quickly than a single fish, and you don't want them suffocating on the way to your new location.    As soon as you reach your new location, immediately set up the aquarium and get it to filtering. Acclimate your fish to the water, and you'll be all set.|`|AA11218394	Well, just be careful in your move. My friend moved recently with a 110gal tank, and all the fish died due to stress. Good luck!!!|`|f2W8INJaaa	haha. thats funny! i had to mave a 55 gal fish tank with about 15 african chiclids as well. well, whast i did was take out the big rocks, and then got about four big buckets and filled them up about halfway and evenlly put the fish in there. That would be the easiest way, or else you would have to carry the tank partially filled with water which adds about 50 pounds to it. but make sure to have a hiding place or something such as a plant or bark for the fish to feel a little safer. Not one fish died on the two hour drive. but I also kept breaking the surface of the water to make sure their was oxygen in there. I f they go too long an stagnant water, then they won't make the trip.|`|icUQhIE6aa	Go to your trusted local aquarium shop/club and ask for help/advice to make the move. with the right equipment and assistance depending on the distance a move should be possible avoiding any lethal stress.  One thing is certain, it must not be rushed so be prepared to find some where to store the fish in between if the time taken demands it.
6KZlrr4Laa	Birds are birds, they have their own group. Aves is the scientific names for birds, but isn't commonly used by the general public like the terms mammals or reptiles.    Also, fish are not amphibians, they are fish. Again, they have their own group. Frogs, however, are amphibians.|`|nazDwz0waa	Aves.|`|Hv7L5CrGaa	yes, they do. Aves. Interesting question.

w1lh1INHaa	It sounds a lot like distemper.  I've included a link.    http://cats.lovetoknow.com/Distemper|`|uly3aFqtaa	This may be Cat Flu.    Definitely ring up the Vet and make another appointment. If this is not possible, ask them over the phone. There are 24/7 hotlines you can ring up, regarding sick pets.|`|7ea0996112daf630f035d318bedc84adaa	First, have all other cats checked by a vet for health.  As for your dead kitten, he could have died from a myriad of infections, either viral, fungal, or genetic.  Unless you have a necropsy performed by a veterinarian, there is no reliable way of determining his cause of death.  Some kittens simply fail to thrive.  In the wild and in captivity its not uncommon to lose one puppy or kitten or nestling in a litter.      I wish your felines all the best in health--don't delay in getting them checked out if the kitten had picked up an infectious disease.|`|sfCBFmGEaa	i think you should take her to another vet asap. they are very vunerable when they are that small, and it would be sad to lose another one. good luck|`|kX7PSvBSaa	take the remaining kitten to the vet and have them give it a full thouroght check up  it obviously couldn't have been nothing so don't take that from your kitten's vet|`|fMRcX2WDaa	it sounds like distemper if your other cats are up to date on vaccines they wont be able to get it but you should get the other cat in before its to late
b6400b04a0e3413ba30570ad0aa8cd2baa	I have heard that the ban was lifted a couple of months ago. The best thing to do is look up where you live and see. Even if they are legal to buy in the US some areas still don't allow you to have them without a license( Pennsylvania doesn't allow hedgehogs for example so maybe where you live won't allow these rats)|`|5f6fbccb8643408cbd62a8431b3e5c44aa	ask an exotic pet store, they will know the laws on those rats.|`|aEQWHUcWaa	dude i would so check it out ya like wouldn't wanna get fined for a rat that be weird lolz or wat ever dey do lolz never done nofin illegal well i mean i'm only a teen lolz
taYFAwlzaa	Hahah ok siberian and robo.  if you look at a picture of both you can tell.  a robo which i have 3 of them are these cute small hamsters, like really small.  while a siberian is bigger like alot at times and it can only live by himself.  If your buying another siberian hamster, dont put it in the same cage, they will like freeking kill eachother!  and about the white dot thing im not shure!
RZPLec5Eaa	The second link doesn't work.    I like them like you do.  No white. Eyeliner is okay though.    EDIT: She's a cutie :)|`|CDBRXtnLaa	there ok my dog has blue eyes and i love them i mean its blue around the eye the eye looks black|`|QTT9380Yaa	i cant see your pictures  it really actually depends for me  i like them   but there is a horse i know with one blue eye that is all crusty around it   and it makes me cringe..|`|F0nRMmmlaa	I only like it when it has eyeline! My horse does!!!|`|CVXCSTHoaa	I love blue eyes on certain colors, i really like the eyeliner with blue eyes. I herd something about blue eyes from my friend she said they were supposed to be bad luck or something but i never had a problem with them.    Actually my dog i have as my avatar has blue eyes and i just adore him.|`|wYBU1B1qaa	They are beautiful!  She's very pretty :)|`|Ky3rQ3fYaa	I get the blind thing too because blues are more prone to blindness.  My paint (with medicine cap) has beautiful deep blue eyes and that is why I bought him.  I didn;t care if he was a snot at that time.  I feel in those eyes and couldn't get up.|`|jhgKFJJzaa	i love blue eyed horses!  especially on a grey or appaloosa coloured type of horse  i mean like coloured horses  but i like when the inside is dark blak exactley how the little piebalds eye is|`|KDyEWM9gaa	Yeh, I reckon blue-eyed horses are very pretty I like horses with brown eyes aswell though...I couldn't pick my fav.....  And horses with blue eyes r defo not creepy the're the opposite...  BTW ur mare is absolutely b.e.a.utiful!|`|SzW9GmRsaa	I don't like them, and consider them a fault.  There is no way I'd buy a horse with blue eyes.  Not going to happen.|`|pMMcEvFsaa	I think blue eyes are so amazing and unique. It's just one of the beautiful details God put on some horses to make them extra special...by the way your mare is so cute!|`|NmQCYizTaa	I like them :) My pony has one blue and one partial blue. They can look kinda startled, but on her thats just cute. However, the person who sold her to us said she 'didnt have a pretty face' before we saw her, so I suppose it depends what you like.|`|RUxRNsf4aa	Cool i didn't know that that was a myth! But do you think it may be that the blindness gene is recessive in the creme gene, and when you get a double cream gene, causing a cremello or perlino (blue eyes) than the two recessive genes arise to dominant and the blue eyed horse is blind? and maybe that's where it came from? Just a thought, i dont know for sure.   But I saw your horse in a different question you asked one time, and she is one of the most gorgeous horses i have ever seen! I love her gorgeous blue eyes! I thought they had to have some pink skin to have blue eyes though, and now that thats obviously wrong i wonder what causes blue eyes? hmm. Anyway ya i love blue eyes but not when pink skin is surrounding them.|`|KxxSxznLaa	I think this question is pretty different which is cool.  I would like blue eyes, but brown eyes make me feel warm and fuzzy ; )|`|eOe0uGVzaa	To be honest, i WAY prefer the dark eyes. i have no objections to a blue eyed horse, i thin ktheir really but, but i prefer the dark eyes.|`|c246ac86dcaacf7f923baa2e96250f43aa	I like them. No white tho. But that is my opinion. and only on certain colors. on black horses it sets them off but like on lighter colors i don't think it looks good.|`|8rVodF9vaa	Looks-wise, I think they look piggy unless they have eyeliner. Otherwise, they are more prone to cancer, and the skin is more delicate and requires more protection than a dark-eyed horse.   I had a blue eyed paint and people were scared of him because of his eyes.|`|TeWmnDFUaa	I love blue eyes two of my horses have blue eyes however they are white which requires fly masks in summer and winter.|`|cv1lTP7haa	I think it depends on the horse. It is a striking look, no doubt, but it only adds an intimidating factor to a horse with an overbearing personality. There's a Tennesse Walker with a gorgeous black color currently being boarded where our horse is. He looks great, but he has some major personality issues his owner is not resolving. The horses I've known with blue eyes have tended to be wilder ones, but that's likely coincidence.|`|TB7q2moCaa	Blue eyes on a horse are called watch eyes. Never a good thing. Watch eyes can get cancer in them very easily.|`|d2Obe0aJaa	I love the blue eyes. My pleasure horses eyes are amazing. In his right eye its 100% and the left eye about 25% is blue. I love it because for halter classes it can really catch the judges attention|`|RUzBDX6Jaa	I like them: alot.  I agree that they look funny on some colors, but i love the first shot.  Its so cute, but mann i think its cute on any miniatures.  I like seeing it on chestnuts, blacks, and grays.  (dark grays, that is)  my chestnut pinto is cute with his blue eyes.  I could never imagine him with any other color.  I love the fact that the blue eyes dont affect vision.  And all it is is a general loss of pigmint, and very desired characteristic in the miniature horse breed.  Definitely love them.
dsTVW1WTaa	Yes of course.   But just remember, its a big responsibility to have that many pets around, it gets hectic trust me.  And then feeding, and training, and vet care. Its not as easy as you think. And you may favor one animal over the other, and like humans that hurts them. As long as you share your love equally im sure you can pull it off though ;]|`|L22hVXTIaa	That's a lot to take on all at once.  Why don't you give your kitty a little while to grow up and then maybe add one puppy later on.  Having 3 babies in the house is a lot to ask of anyone and I think you'll be so busy caring for them that  I doubt if you'll have much time to spend with any one of them.|`|BQ3z5T8Gaa	ok it all depends on what ur willing to loose out on, we (me N my Wife) have two dogs, two cats, n four pigeons outside, plus we have two kids we have or should i say make da time to love them all. we dont really have a outgoing life style because we stay at home for our family but we make time to out for walks, play at da park, ect. all this in good nature we love our family n work very hard on keeping them all happy.|`|TpcrI3rKaa	yes u can u have to love them the same  cuz then they are not going to like each other...trust me on this one!!!!!!!! my mom has 4 dogs an a cat........|`|jWmnSXlLaa	No I dont think you will have the time. 2 puppies added to the mix is alot to deal with.|`|z0fomFCfaa	Yes.If you have a cat that likes dogs and a dog that likes cats everythig should work out!!|`|FR2bKa7iaa	no|`|ro5vFj9Aaa	alot of people do it but me i am one person one animal at a time. if i got a kitten i think my dog would love it hes a small terrier and he would be tickled but then i would have to get declawed and stuff so it woudnt' ruin the house but if you feel you can then go for it. i just have ot say for myself no cause i like to pet and hold one at atime and this is it for me.
VDP3pNCPaa	As far as the Christmas lights, I hope you tossed them.  They are made so cheaply and of flimsy materials that you never want to keep them for many years.    But as far as your other cords, look for a substance called Bitter Apple which you can put on the cords that will stop the chewing and biting.  Normally, they will outgrow that.    You may have to replace the cord that was chewed, or at least wrap it with electrical tape.    PetCo has Bitter Apple for cats, and PetSmart has it for dogs, although I doubt there is any difference.|`|zDf186Xyaa	warn him in cat language.like this purrrrr|`|AA11736483	Chewing on cords is typically a sign of boredom or possibly a mineral deficiency.|`|ecL0ZbfCaa	Clap your hands loudly and spray them with a water pistol if you catch them doing it.  Our cat was constantly scratching the furniture and we did this for a few weeks and he hardly ever does it now.  Cats can be trained.|`|fZgoUty4aa	put cat nip or pepper on them|`|x3RBy8Ljaa	Cats hate  the scent of mint,  lemon and particularly cherry.  Get a lemon oil polisher,or listerine  and wipe the cables.   Do not use catnip, cats love it and chew it.    Another option is to secure the cables, you can get cable covers and attached them to the wall.|`|FgyE9Rthaa	We keep a squirt bottle of water for times that our cats are misbehaving.  From clawing furniture to eating plants, it has worked on our cats (we have 4). A couple of squirts will deter them.  It may take a few times, but she will soon learn that whatever she is interested in isn't worth it.    **Don't squirt her in the face, though.|`|P007Y0GRaa	water gun work s a treat stop s them being naughty my wee moggy loves wires too  water gun sorted it out also a rolled up newspaper off the side of sofa and chair if its next to you  i know thay hate the smell of orange peel . my wee moggy loved to poo in the corner where the tray was   so put some orange peel down there stoped real soon     mummy to 3 moggys|`|IZIi27HYaa	turn the electric on.|`|IuYekkPVaa	Wherever possible put cables away out of her reach or conceal them with PVC cable trunking. Another way to discourage the habit is to put a few drops of either eucalyptus or citrus scented essential oil on a piece of cotton wool and smear it over the cables. Cats hate these smells and it's often enough to deter them from going near. You could also try leaving out a "baited" piece of cable (one that you've already put a nasty scent on) as this will help reinforce the idea that they are to be avoided. There are sprays like Bitter Apple or Bitter Bite that you could try as some cats dislike the taste of them. (Tried them with our cat but it didn't put him off).    Try not to tell her off when you catch her chewing cables otherwise she'll just wait till you are not around, instead try to distract her attention with toys. If its the chewing sensation that she enjoys, she might appreciate having some soft rubber toys of her own to chew on.|`|7cei5ifNaa	Spry the wires with pepper|`|6b04475dfa48c895cab35ba0be43f6a1aa	squirt it with a water pistol every time it even goes near wires
WFzt2fHOaa	I've had 8 syrian hamsters, and none of them have reacted to music.  They did respond to loud noises by freezing, this is a sign of fear.  Hamster cannot see very well, so noises can be very scary.|`|sIXCmuU0aa	yes but make sure u don't make it to loud|`|x66TTEymaa	well don't blast it in their ears... LOL i'd love to see how they would react to that|`|HF0oDEd0aa	aw thats so cute i think they like it!|`|o34YHLiraa	They don't really care, as most animals (except, to a limited degree, higher mammals) do not have any capacity to make or understand music. They can comprehend sound to communicate base emotions, signals, or needs, and they can comprehend sounds being too loud, but they can't understand music. So don't put your headphones on your hamster, it's just going to weird him out because it's too loud and a foreign noise.|`|OxOIhuXEaa	hey    well there was an aritcle about this kinda thing    well a farmer heard that music could make his animals like 'perform better' (chickens lay more eggs, cows more milk)  he set up his like stereo outside and   put on like music. it made them agitated    then he tried classical music, and it worked. it calmed them down and made them produce more ..stuff    so i guess it depends on what kinda music you let him listen to    it also works with plants too (classical)|`|BfpchxN2aa	Hamsters are not reacting in a way telling you it likes music its frightend by the flair of the viberation|`|CkYaLp6Raa	Yes.
MGxDgsKZaa	I doubt a few licks of beer will be strong enough to hurt them. But for the record, animals DO die from alcohol poisoning. I saw an episode of Emergency Vets where a dog either died or almost died after his owners gave him vodka as a joke.|`|jrEdNmlOaa	How awful, perhaps you cat has a hangover after that?|`|F3LBgfvwaa	A little isn't going to kill your cat, but it's best not to let them have any alcohol, it is pretty bad for them.|`|gM7VuCM4aa	It's odd that the kitty drank it because cats, unlike humans, automatically know when something is bad for them. A few licks of it off the floor shouldn't hurt kitty but please don't allow it to do it again.|`|KxdDeO8Taa	Im not sur, but i think it might get drunk. . .|`|TpcrI3rKaa	u might have a cataholic cat on ur hands or u yest forgot to put him a lil water on its tray........but need to be careful  but i don't think it can get sick|`|sPZW8Bcyaa	The worst that could happen is it could puke, but cats do that all the time. hahaha I wanna see a cat drunk.
xKgcqyeDaa	The only real medical problems you're likely to face are impaction (ingestion of a piece of substrate) and possibly respiratory infections (caused by low humidity or cold habitat). You can avoid the first one by feeding the snake outside of its cage, and the second one by keeping the temperature above 70 degrees (on the cold end) and misting if the humidity dips below 20%.|`|b70DwhfCaa	leave him/her alone for the first week to settle in
MGxDgsKZaa	Keep looking outside but try to calmly and thoroughly search the inside as well. He might have gone out and come back in when you weren't watching. My cat once did this to me; after hours of hysterical searching I found him hiding in the back of a closet.|`|lM9NvSwnaa	Animals are smarter than we give them credit for.  Chances are he will return on his own.  If it is cold where you live, make sure you bang on your car hood really hard before starting it, because he may seek shelter there up in the fan belt region and it is not pretty what the belts and fan blades do to cats who get caught in them.    Also talk to the local humane shelter, they get  "strays" in all the time, as well as injured animals.  Tell them or give them a photo of your cat.  Talk to all your neighbors and let them know he got out and ask if they will please keep an eye out for him.  Lastly, don't give up hope-he probably just wanted to go out and explore.  Even house cats get tired of the same 4 walls.|`|p7BjjPtNaa	Buy a dog|`|S2FhDtfSaa	Set  trap with cat food and catch it. You can get a trap from the animal control people. Generally they lend it to you but may require a deposit.|`|PZ5ozKY1aa	how will you forgive yourself if the cat dies?  omg that would be terrible.|`|RVicFEyFaa	Even if it wakes the neighbors. Every hour call cat by name, roll with the kitty,kitty,kitty until your tongue can tie a cherry stem & shake the living heck out a cereal box or dry food. The more you do this, the better. The further he goes the more he won't hear you. If necessary do a slow crawl in the car & repeat the above. Keeping my fingers crossed|`|5o9s8m8laa	Get something the cat responds to auditory (ie: treats shaking).  Go to the exit and make the sound and see if that works.  Did for me.  I just wouldn't go berzerker outside, it may scare your cat.|`|21EWKrF6aa	I've been there but my cat came home.How long have you had the cat?if he's not home in a few hours take his favorit cat treat or toy and walk up and down the street shaking it.Drive up and down and the street.That's what I did when my cat got outside.If you still can't find him make posters with his picture and that and post them.Go door to door with a picture of him.My cat was gone for 6 hours before he came home.
Q8etYn60aa	82 degrees isn't too hot; Bettas are tropical fish and like their water warm.  63 degrees is way too cold.  Hopefully he'll be okay, but you really shouldn't switch extreme temperatures quickly, they could go into shock.|`|beE1nFA6aa	If you let it acclimate properly... which you may have done, depending on if the water inside the cup afterward was the same or within a few degrees of the water you put it in, it should be fine. 82F is a good temperature for a betta, so don't worry about that. The adjustment period is what you should be concerned with.|`|oPYktTygaa	For my betta fishes, I just recently changed their water like two hours ago, I just give them the normal tap water temperature (the cold one), at however cold it comes out and put their water treatment in and they've been fine for oh, the twenty five times or more I've done this xD So, I think your betta would be fine, but you don't need to heat the water because for my fishes, the water gets warmer as they swim around, and large temperature changes aren't good. (why would you heat their water? lol just wondering)|`|cv1lTP7haa	82 isn't a bad temperature for Bettas at all..in fact, that high of a temperature is the recommended level for breeding. Their normal recommended level is around 76-82. However, that drastic of a change should have been done over the course of several days. It's unfortunate you had to get him in water that cold in the first place...he must have felt so lethargic!    There's really no way to tell how he'll do without waiting to see how he handles it. You did acclimate him, at least...just putting him straight in would probably have sent him into shock. You might be lucky that the increase in temperature to actual suitable conditions boosts his immune system enough to hold against any shock/illness from the change, but keep a very careful eye on your fish for several days to make sure he's feeling well. Only time will tell.|`|9uyQ51Uoaa	oh my- your poor fishie......|`|LhQ8TYoHaa	He should be ok... that was a wise decision he would have died in the cold water.|`|AA10356572	you moved him too fast into too big a difference of water - too late to correct it much now though... dang..|`|0Z2aBH0Daa	Hopefully he'll be okay but extreme temp changes aren't good.|`|MzHwklzKaa	Next time, pour the colder water (with the fish) into a Ziploc bag and float it in the warmer water.    It's done now, so you can just hope for the best.  It should be fine.    Good luck.
4SQx8smEaa	oh definitely a rat. I currently own 2. I have owned a total of three, and have had numbers of hamsters.  Reasons why I prefer rats over hamsters.  **Rats rarely ever bit, with all the rats that I have handled I have never been bit by one.  **They are so smart, you can teach them how to do tricks. They are kind of like small dogs.  **They are extremely social and crave human attention.  **They can get along with other pets that reside in your house.  **They are clean and do not smell as long as you clean their cage once a week.  **Rats are much more easier to handle and enjoy shoulder rides.    There are more I just can not think about them right now.|`|96ydDKocaa	well it really depends on what your going for hamsters are cute and furry and cuddly looking but they live short lives, rats tend to live longer and can learn to do tricks run mazes and be more like a pet than something you keep in a cage or ball the rat is more of a commitment the hamster easy to care for change cage and feed hamster pellets so do your reaserch see what youd like more|`|wo9goWXUaa	rats are better than hamsters. dumbo rats are the best rats of all. my daughter has a male dumbo rat that she loves so much.the rat is so sweet and he doesn't bite at all. hamsters on the other hand bite you for no reason. one hamster at the pet store bit her for no reason|`|uDka9xopaa	Rats are the best by far i've had hamsters be for but every since i got my 1st rat about 5 or 6 yrs ago i will never own another one again they can turn on you but rats are loving till the end|`|l1XrfCzFaa	Hamster|`|b0ef0313288e7d4fc975107d5bf36713aa	i prefer an albino hamster...  they are soooo cute!!!!!!!    hairless rats are also adorable|`|Eu9x0p8Paa	Hamster, because have you heard the phrase ratty? It sounds bad. Hamstery, on the other hand sound kawaii.  Also, hamster because of this:http://au.youtube.com/watch?v=rfqNXADl3k...|`|Qc5PZnXpaa	Definitely a rat!  They are very fun and energetic and extremely intelligent!  Hamsters are cute, but they don't like to be handled as much  and they are also boring. Rats actually become attached to you   just like dogs. I have had both and I really prefer rats. Just make sure,  that if you get a rat, you have some time to play with it, or take it out  of the cage often. Most like a lot of attention and playtime.|`|yZt3paskaa	Hamsters Are a lot like fish as long as they eat and are kept clean we have to assume they are happy. They don't care much for interaction unlike rats. Rats are cleaner and much more affectionate. You can tell you rats are happy b/c they love your attention. They also play and come to you alot like a cat. Rats love their humans|`|C3DSUacAaa	Depends on your lifestyle and what you look for in a pocket pet.    Rats need lots of attention, lots of mental stimulation and at least an hour a day of out-of-cage socialization. You should get rats in pairs, they don't do well alone and they will be much better socialized and willing to interact with humans. They need a fairly large cage for climbing, and should be in a fairly trafficked area of the house for mental stimulation. Males tend to be a little smelly at times, but if you keep their cage clean it is minimal. They are extremely gratifying and affectionate pets, extremely intelligent and very social. They never bite, except for the occasional affectionate nip.    Hamsters are slightly easier to care for; they require less social interaction, less space and you can keep them alone. Syrians (the regular size hamsters) are less skittish, bite less often, are more bold and easier to handle than teeny dwarf hamsters. Dwarfs need less space, never smell and are perfectly content with minimal out-of-cage time. The downside to hamsters is that they are less of a companion pet and more of a display pet.    Bottom line: if you have time, space and willingness to socialize lots, I recommend a pair of rats; if, on the other hand, you don't think you can dedicate enough attention to them, or are unwilling to have more than one pet, I highly recommend a hamster. The choice is yours!|`|vcWuPlOyaa	I would have to say a hamster.|`|A1kcSX3Zaa	I have had both and much  prefer rats. But only the males. They are very intelligent and entertaining. Ours even had the run of the house with no problems after some training. He was a lot of fun. Hamsters are boring escape artists in my opinion. Now we have two guinea pigs. They are adorable and affectionate. But all pets are fun if you get one that suits you and take the time to tame it . Have fun with your new pet! Debra is right that rats are much cleaner and can learn a lot of tricks. Ours even came when we called his name.|`|1BbnyTfBaa	I'm a cat person,  myself.|`|eS8wuYRfaa	It's really a personal decision.  But, my daughter has had both (she's 14) and we both prefer the rat.  They are more easily handled and more affectionate.  They are also smarter and easier to find if they escape (which rats and hamsters are notorious at doing).  In fact, we just had to have our rat and last hamster put to sleep in the last 2 weeks..both were very old.  We already have a new baby rat picked out from a breeder, but neither one of us has any desire to get another hamster.|`|54fdf2affdc8dc366315eec2cecd5920aa	I prefer a rat.  Rats are friendlier (in most cases; but some hamsters are very friendly too).  A rat can ride on your shoulder.  A hamster would fall.  If the rat does fall, it won't get hurt.  A hamster, if it falls, could get injured.  Hamsters don't understand height, and will walk off the edge of a table.  Rats won't do that.  They may jump off, but they know what they are doing.  Hamsters are (often) grumpy if you wake them up.  Rats are happy to come out anytime, even if you wake them up.    However, more people have allergies to rats than to hamsters.    But, it just depends on what you like better.|`|SjNpWwSfaa	Hamster|`|yfwSDroNaa	they both stink up ur room so none of the above...truuuuuust me|`|9vzfI4kDaa	a rat by far    hamster can be smelly and not like to be handled as much    and    rat you can actually train and they do not stink    i have had both before and currently have two rats and six ferrets and a guinea pig|`|aLh6uTf1aa	A hamster, not a dwarf hamster, I heard they can be mean.
QpElKY8Kaa	Reports of abuse are confidential.  Take pictures, by all means.  This should have been reported long ago.  Will your friends corroborate your observations or make statements of their own?    There is no time to waste, lives are in the balance and there's no telling how long before action will be taken.|`|8cikAYp3aa	And you've waited this long to report it out of fear for yourself, or retaliation.    Call the police, call the aspca, call animal control and call now.  Today, this very moment.  Waiting only adds to the suffering those animals are experiencing. Heck, call the local newspaper as well.  That sort of thing needs to be exposed, and corrected and saddly it wont as long as people see it, and say " I'm going to call soon"  Soon never comes as something always pops up to stop it.. " oh they got water finally"  "I'm worried they will know its me"  " they might hurt my horse"|`|VpfSbqhVaa	Yes you must report this. These animals are helpless and clearly treated poorly. Yes pictures are a good way to provide evidence of their treatment, unfortunately, the owner of these animals is entitled to due process. However, based on your description there will be little need for your testimony, the animals condition alone should serve as damning evidence.     Now the bad news, there are very few homes for neglected horses and burrows. You may be taking out of the pot and into the fire.    There is a wonderful rescue farm in West Virgina called Crossed Sabers Stables, look them up, they have a website. If you aren't interested in seeing the owner prosecuted, maybe he (men seem more prone to animal abuse) would be willing to just give the animals to a good home.|`|lu4ufhm5aa	Do it. and like the person above said its completely private the people will not know it is you who reported them. It is always better to be safe than sorry. Best of luck|`|Oiabe82gaa	You have to report this for sure, but if you are concerned about them knowing it was you I wouldn't be taking any photos. Your report will be totally confidential, nobody will find out it was you, and it can be done from the safety of your own home. If you are seen by the owner taking pictures then the owner will want to know what you are doing taking photos of his animals, and yes, there is always the chance he will want to retaliate for that, so I would play it safe, don't take pics and just call!  That is too much of a risk. I would simply call up Animal Protection, pass on your concerns and the address to them, and then sit back and wait for them to do their thing. I will tell you now though, IF these animals are rescued it is gonna take time. The owners will be given an order to rectify the problems, and animal welfare officers will be paying several visits to check if this is being done...unless of course the owner gives the animals up immediately!!!  Good luck!|`|KDyEWM9gaa	Yes defo!  Your gonna need some evidence so take a few piccy's...  While ur goin thru with it just keep remind urself about those poor horses and imagine how happy they will be all becuz of u!!!!  And that should boost ur confidence!  You'll be absolutely fine!!!|`|Iek7D2hOaa	definitely report it,  and if you can, snag some photo's.  animal cruelty is horrible!|`|a297uH97aa	Definately get pics of this if you can and report what you see and date the information as you collect it but by all means report this to authorities right away those animals shouldnt be suffering like that god knows how bad their condition is until you get up close:( those poor animals|`|2a0b47Jdaa	Report it.... u can submit it annonomously and they won't find out it was u|`|oKmQYBFfaa	Try to sneak around and find a place that the horses can get to, but the owner wont see. And through them some hay and maybe put out a bucket of water.  Report them, but keep feeding untill you can get them reported.  Horse abuse and neglection should be stopped, this is your chance to help.|`|AA11353999	I would say report them!    We actually had the state troopers show up because someone reported our mare w/new foal. From a foaling before, she foundered when she retained her placenta. She is pasture sound and we never meant to breed her back, but on her foaling heat the stallion broke through & got with her. So 11 months later she delivered again and because of her foundering, foaling, nursing and general inability to get around, she just didn't keep her weight up. The troopers saw that we had her on feed supplements, grain twice daily, amble supply of clover & oat mixed hay and water, plus pain meds when she was in real pain- no abuse/neglect charges were filed.    If you have a doubt these horses & mules aren't fine, report them anyways. Let the officials go in, investigate and take it from there.|`|w1vfxBJVaa	i dont know where you are. i run a horse and pony rescue. but carnt just walk on peoples land without permission from the owner. its best if you can find out who they belong to so that they can be approched. they might be pleased for some help. its worth asking around....my e.mail is homewardboundrescue@live.co.uk    good luck|`|d3s5oB63aa	You'd want to be really careful if you are going to take photos. I would just call animal welfare right away and let them do all that. Then the people will hopefully not guess it was you who dobbed them in. It sounds like a bad situation. Cal today for the sake of those poor donkeys and horses.
gwDftPBsaa	How about neon tetras? rummy nose tetras? xray tetras? corys? Danios? Kuli Loaches? those are a few suggestions for your setup. I think you should remove the cons though.|`|gQongGHUaa	the convicts will disrupt your tank|`|KqZhJpZ0aa	Thats actually pretty good tank, bristle nose might get beat up.

o93EwErKaa	While probably better than Beneful it is still a poor quality food.    http://www.dogfoodanalysis.com/dog_food_...    I am not sure what you can get in your town.  Have you tried the livestock feedstores?  Usually they carry Diamond Products - Chicken Soup for the Dog Lover's Soul and Taste of the Wild grainless.    Can you get Blue Buffalo or the grainless version Blue Wilderness?    Do you have a Costco where you can buy Kirkland Signature (not the best, but better than Iams and the price is right)?|`|Jguzosm2aa	Honestly, I'm not overly impressed with Canidae. IAMS is no better than most grocery store brands, but for the slight upgrade, I would say it's not even worth your time. Speak to the managers at your local stores - see if there's any way they might be able to order in other brands.    If you dog is doing well on IAMS, just stick to it. Consistency will do him more good than switching again and again because it's hard to track down the food you want. His stool should be solid and shaped, but not hard and he shouldn't be straining when he goes. There should be no excessive chewing or scratching. If all is well, just continue with the IAMs.|`|P8Q39vA4aa	The best food you can feed your dog is what works for him and him alone. You CANNOT go by what others tell you because every dog has a different stomach and needs.    If IAMS works for your dog, meaning the dog loves it and has solid stools and good coat condition then there is NO need to change no matter what others say.     Most will preach feed this or that but only your dog can indicate what food is best.    Note: Dogs have been fed IAMS for years, and live happy healthy lives.     Also Note: High protein foods can damage your dogs kidneys and liver, anything from 40 up is a dangerous number. These foods are meant for working dogs that get the exercise needed to burn off that protein. The average pet does not get enough to do so.    Note: DO NOT believe anything from dogfoodanalysis the reviewer on their is a prick that does NOT feed the foods to his dogs if he even has any. He is NOT a licensed nutritionist.|`|uBFhKXgHaa	No, IAMS is a low quality dog food as well. There are plenty of high quality dog foods, I'm sure you can find one near you.    Examples of low quality foods to avoid: Anything you can find in a grocery store will be low end, Purina, Iams, Eukanuba, Science Diet, Royal Canin, Pedigree, Kibbles n' Bits, Beneful, Ol'Roy.    Examples of high quality foods to look for: Innova, Wellness, Solid Gold, Canidae All Life Stages, Fromm Four Star, Merrick, GO Natural, Nature's Variety Prairie, Nature's Logic, Artemis Fresh Mix, Timberwolf Organics.    Most of the high quality dog food brands have websites with store locators on them. Just type the brand name into Google and go to their website.    Darksong~|`|nmercOm7aa	Iams is not much better than Beneful. If you can get it at a grocery store or a store like Wal-mart, it is not worth your money.     Look on http://www.dogfoodanalysis.com and try a 4-6 star food. You can look on the companies website to find a store near you.|`|eDAX46b9aa	My puppy eats the same kind of food. She doesn't like it a ton, but it is very decent. we just switched from another brand, which she liked more then this one.

If canidae is too far away, look into other foods that are good quality.     Can you get solid gold, wellness or blue buffalo? Where do you shop, just a general location like atlanta, ga or westchester county new york.     I am not trying to make this difficult, but iams isnt fairly decent. It is better than beneful depending on the formula, but it is no where near high quality.   Here are the ingredients of the iams proactive heath large breed food:   Chicken, CORN MEAL, Ground Whole Grain Sorghum, Chicken BY-PRODUCT Meal (Natural source of Glucosamine), Ground Whole Grain Barley, Dried BEET PULP, Chicken Fat (preserved with mixed Tocopherols, a source of Vitamin E), Dried Egg Product, FISH Meal, Chicken Flavor, Potassium Chloride, Brewers Dried Yeast, Dicalcium Phosphate, SALT, Flax Meal, Caramel, Choline Chloride, Fish Oil (preserved with mixed Tocopherols, a source of Vitamin E), Minerals (Ferrous Sulfate, Zinc Oxide, Manganese Sulfate, Copper Sulfate, Manganous Oxide, Potassium Iodide, Cobalt Carbonate), Dried Chicken Cartilage (Natural source of Glucosamine), Calcium Carbonate, Vitamins (Vitamin E Supplement, Ascorbic Acid, Vitamin A Acetate, Calcium Pantothenate, Biotin, Thiamine Mononitrate (source of vitamin B1), Vitamin B12 Supplement, Niacin, Riboflavin Supplement (source of vitamin B2), Inositol, Pyridoxine Hydrochloride (source of vitamin B6), Vitamin D3 Supplement, Folic Acid), DL-Methionine, L-Tryptophan, Rosemary Extract.     The caps signify what you should really avoid in the foods that are in this current food.     If you need help finding a good food locally, I have no problem helping.     And a note about canidae: Since its ingredient switch and downgrade, a lawsuit has been filed for the problems it caused.     Go ahead and feed the food you have or go back and say you are unsatisfied with it and look for solid gold or blue buffalo.   Innova might be an option too.     Do you have a feed store nearby? A way to find if you do is to go to a dog food website that isnt commonly seen at petstores like Taste of the wild or innova and search for the food in your area under their where to buy. Feed stores that carry that food will show up.     Next time you run out of food, go to the store instead and pick up some raw meat like chicken breast, ground turkey and either feed it raw or boil it. If you feed it raw, get chicken quarters and feed that instead of just the muscle meat. You can also fix some plain rice/oatmeal if you want. It keeps the food plain to avoid a tummy upset from a sudden food change and allows you to get to food when you can.     When you go get the next dog food, avoid these ingredients:   http://www.dogfoodproject.com/index.php?...    And for cost: http://www.dogfoodproject.com/index.php?...
9f97f8a980cb5aa7360577720efbdd70aa	They can charge whatever they want...but these prices are pretty outrageous....not sure why you would choose to go to a vet that charges these rates.  Call around..different vets charge different amounts.|`|XxU94aKlaa	This gave me a great laugh honestly.  No this is not illegal in any way, shape or form. A veterinarian can charge as much or as little as they would like. Some people can not afford medical care; does that make it illegal to charge as much as they do for it? This is the same case, you simply go somewhere that charges based on income, or a cheaper clinic and hope for the best.|`|bMYv0fBHaa	I know that in retail stores it is illegal to charge under what was paid for stock....for the reason that everyone would buy there; other businesses would be run out; and a monopoly would be created.    At least, that's what I've heard.    Charging high amounts isn't illegal, though I don't know who would pay that much for such a simple procedure. I would consider a different vet (for more than just the neutering, since that's already done).|`|Bw18seFqaa	its not illegal.. the vet can charge what he wants.. if you think its too much, then call around to other vets and see if one will fix them for cheaper.|`|05805cd7f8ba800b6b1e4c9525a624bcaa	Lol no not illegal around where I live you would be lucky to get a cat fixed for under $250 . I am having my rabbit neutered in a month and the lowest I have been quoted was $285 . They charge a ton since they know they are the only vet within an hour of our town and most people won't go out of town for a vet.|`|9743a4b9136d6937a430cb49e25563baaa	no it is not illegal.  they are private businesses and can charge what ever they want.

I know what it is like to love those little creatures more than some of the humans we know. They give us so much joy and love and all we can do is try to take the best care possible of them. That is why I encourage every one to get their shots and vet checks. I know you are doing that so again I will say you and your doggie are in my prayers. Good luck
OG3lycSPaa	almost any tropical community fish would be compatible. small silver dollars and small bala sharks are peaceful enough just conisder that they can get up to a good 5-6 inches. silver dollars are schooling fish. Almost any tetra would be a good addition and could add some more variety to the tank. Sometimes angel fish are aggressive. I've also had problems with aggressive black mollies.
PUbR3tHKaa	You will want to get smallish to middle sized rats, as they should be around the right age to bond with you, but not too small.  You don't want a rattty younger than 6 weeks.  If you can get 6-10 weeks that is perfect.  As for males or females, here is the breakdown.  Females stay a bit smaller.  They are smarter, more active, more curious, and a bit more destructive than the males.  They are always on the move.  Males stay active until about six months, then they slow down and become the ultimate lap or shoulder pets.  They are larger, significantly larger than the females.  They are a bit more mellow, and this can show itself as being more affectionate, but I think they actually like us the same as the females!  They can mark stuff, but it is not that bad, just an occasional drop, and the females can do that occasionally as well, but not as much.  As for aggression, generally rats that are raised together will not have problems.  Even rats that are not raised together can be introduced the right way.  Neutering definitely works for the very rare aggressive rat that has been introduced appropriately and never made peace with his cage mate, but I have only had one that was aggressive after appropriate intros, and that has been after many many many rats in my lifetime!    So, 6-10 weeks, boys if you like lap pets, girls if you like energy and curiosity.  Good luck!|`|8rF3wAHtaa	Don't get boy and girl unless you want babies. Boys tend to be bigger and I've heard smellier, they also have very large testicles which some people don't like the look of.  I assume you will be getting juvenilles in which case you can't really tell if they are going to be big or not, generally they are roughly the same size.|`|8cuPVvYnaa	First of all, be sure to get Alpine bedding or a bedding that has no pine in it. Pine can cause respiratory problems in rats. Unless you plan on becoming a breeder (lots of work; more money for cages,...), then you do not want a male and a female. I personally prefer 2 females.     Also, be sure to clean the cage often and change the water frequently (even if the bottle has plenty still in it). Do not feed your rat any junk food, just rat food and whole, natural foods. Junk food lessens the quality of ALL life and will probably shorten even people's lives, but since we live so much longer than rats it is not so obvious. For an animal that lives only a few years, it is very important to not give them junk.    Good luck with your new addition to the home, and have enjoy whatever you choose!|`|GgkxvdgEaa	You want two girls. Two guys would fight, and a guy and a girl would have LOTS of babies!    You should get big ones, i think. they're just plain more fun.|`|RHUDduUbaa	getta LARGE cage and a boy and girl for babies and i personally like big rats|`|4SQx8smEaa	You are better off getting 2 girls. Having two males in the same cage could become a disaster, eventually one will try to become dominant but that is not always the case there are always exceptions. And getting 1 male and 1 female you will soon have like a million rats!!  I would go with the smaller rats, just because they are younger. Good Luck Sorry about your Dusty, My rat buddy just passed away last night, it's not easy.|`|280d96ad7b5e9ffad03a34a66cac5db0aa	Do not get a male and a female unless you want to endanger your female and be responsible an absurd amount of offspring, which will be very expensive to care for. The ONLY reason you should ever place a male and female together is if the female is spayed or the male is neutered.    The only rats sold as pets are fancy rats. Rats such as dumbos and hairless are just varieties of the fancy rat.    Males tend to be larger, lazier, calmer and squishier. They typically mark more, although both genders mark to some degree. (Neutering before maturity can really curb marking.) Adult, unsocialized males are more prone to aggression, but I'm sure you won't be pitting two adult rats together who don't know each other.    Females are generally small, lithe and ridiculously active. Don't expect a female to just sit and hang out with you while you pet her. They're extremely prone to mammary tumors, which can be prevented through spaying.     What are you talking about, "medium" and "small?" Hmm. I believe Petco labels their rats like that. That's because they don't care if their rats are sold as pets or as food for reptiles. Those labels are for the snake owners. Anyway, it doesn't matter. A "small rat" is no different from a "medium rat" beyond size, and they might only be differently sized due to age differences or gender.    How big is Dustin's cage? He was a single rat, so he didn't need the cage that a pair would require. Your cage must be a MINIMUM of four cubic feet, although the bigger the better.    Also, your rat didn't die from a respiratory disease. He died from a respiratory infection or a flare-up of mycoplasma. I hope he was on antibiotics. If not, they most likely would have saved his life.      EDIT: Male aggression can almost always be fixed through neutering, which will remove the hormones that make him act up. But keep in mind that countless male rats do perfectly fine together, my two boys are snuggled together as I type.
L22hVXTIaa	The mole or beauty mark is actually a collection of nerves, and the thick hairs that sprout from it are not just fur. These whiskers are called vibrissae, and they allow your dog to investigate everything from you to your home.    The vibrissae are very sensitive and extremely receptive to touch. Unlike fur, they have functions other than just keeping your dog warm or cold. Theyre designed to transmit detailed information about movement to aid your dogs guidance and balance.    Vibrissae are typically found in clumps, although the arrangement can differ depending on the particular individual. The little beauty marks are mounds of nerves and other connections that make the whiskers function as tactile (feeling) hairs. Dogs have one mound of compound follicles, but they can have more than one whisker in the mound.|`|tPGxPDvBaa	they are just moles.  No one knows why dogs have them but all dogs do.|`|k6flESfNaa	well, arent they just big pores with thick hair[whiskers] growing out of them?
gwDftPBsaa	Its not a algea bloom you have, its a bacteria bloom. Its caused when your power went out and all the good bacteria in your filter died. So now your pretty much in a mini cycle right now. Do small daily water changes to keep your ammonia/nitrite/nitrate levels down and until your good bacteria repopulize. Once your tank stables out again you can go back to doing your normal routeen.  edit:  when i say small daily water changes i mean you need to change about 25% of the tank volume.|`|GHpcc5iKaa	well fish lose their color when they arent in light. but um buy a snail to eat away the algae in case that happens again. but the paleness wont hurt em unless they have the ich and im sure you know what that is right?|`|6b557f2edd82e83be3708d2355146149aa	A day with no filter won't kill the beneficial bacteria. That bacteria isn't just in your filter, its in your gravel and tank water too. The tank will clear up in a day or 2. Just change %25-50 of your water and clean your filter. If it doesn't go away add 3 cap fulls of peroxide. Peroxide destroys algea without harming the fish. 1 cap/10g. I use this method often with my planted tanks.    Every 2 day water changes is a good idea with fry anyways. :)

NnYB9eXiaa	Hi :)    You didn't tell us how long you've had her - if she's new that could be part of it.    Female hamsters are more territorial than males when they reach maturity and this leads to "cage aggression."  I don't think she's sick, she may just be in heat, and when they are - they're less friendly and more protective of their homes.    Try the following steps for a few days to get her out and try to handle her, it may calm her some.  I know you weren't trying to hold her, but if she's become frightened for some reason, they'll help you sooth her and calm her a bit.      Once she's calm in your hand again, you should be safe to reach in there and feed her again - until she's stopped freaking when you reach in, use the time when you've gotten her out of the cage to refill her food, etc.    1. Wash your hands carefully with a non-fruity or heavily scented soap - this will keep them from wanting to taste, and possibly bite your hand.  Others may advise you to wear gloves - this prevents the hamster from learning your scent, and you want them to know YOU when you're handling them, not the smells on a glove.    2. NEVER reach into the hamster cage and try to *grab* your hamster. Hamsters are quite protective of their homes and will try to defend them (aka bite you or flip over and scream -- which is a defense mechanism). Females tend to be more "cage aggressive" than males, although with time and patience, this will diminish with either one.    3. Hold a small cup or bowl in front of the cage door with a yummy treat in it - the hamster will crawl in almost every time.    4. Slide the lil guy out of the cup/bowl into your hand - and voila! You're holding your hamster and haven't been bitten!    Be careful as they will be a bit skittish (and dwarfs are little speed demons so it may try to run up your arm). Of course you'll want to be sure to be extra gentle as they are still animals and can bite when they get scared!  They may also lick/nibble your fingers, don't mistake this for biting, it just means they're curious.  Nibbling tickles - biting hurts ;)    Once your hamster gets more accustomed to you and how you smell, you'll be able to skip step 3 and they'll crawl right into your hand.    Best of luck - and have patience|`|RHUDduUbaa	make sure she nos u r comin in u may hav startled her|`|gXXCBlVQaa	maybe she was sleepy or either she was unaware that you gave her food.=]|`|mTJ8wTs3aa	Hamsters can be very sweet-natured, but you have to make sure not to startle them. Before you come in contact with your hamster, try talking softly and making noises so he knows that you're coming. She could have just not been expecting you.    On the other hand, something could be wrong with her. Watch her more before you try to touch her again. See if there is anything else out of the ordinary going on. If she's doing anything else strange, she might be sick. If you are worried about this, hamsterific.com has a comprehensive list of hamster diseases.    Chances are that you just startled her, but it's better to be safe than sorry. Good luck!|`|pcjJ5VzKaa	hamster is a absent-minded animal..
Z3OTphZhaa	I've never heard that leaning is a sign of dominance, just that the dog wants to be nearby/close to you.  As for the stare down, if it is your dog, that is one thing, but DO NOT stare down a strange aggressive dog.  That is indeed a challenge and the best thing to do in that situation is to avoid eye contact and back slowly away, and whatever you do, do not run!    If you want to know how dogs demonstrate dominant behavior, it is by the following:    Symptoms of Dog Dominance Behavior include, among others, such things as:    -- Refusing to move out of your way    -- Blocking your ability to where you want to go    -- Stealing and hiding your stuff    -- Destroying your things    -- Peeing on your bed    -- Pooping on your bed    -- Stealing your food    -- Ignoring commands that he knows well    -- Demanding your attention through nudges, whining, or mouthing you    -- Growling at you    -- Humping you, your guests, or things    -- Mounting you, your guests, or things    -- Guarding food or toys    - Putting your stuff in his area|`|hTT8DhYfaa	she feels motherly, but the one getting licked feels uncomfortable, but accepting    sasha just loves you. completely due to her 'leaning'   if it bugs you, just push her off, but show her you love her so she doesnt get the wrong impression      good luck :)|`|GCufUbxJaa	She probably just wants to get petted by leaning against you. or she just wants to be by you. But the older dog may have some motherly instinct for the younger dogs. it happened to my dogs too. And the stare off thing isnt how you tell the dog you are in charge, whenever it misbehaves just smack it (not hard!!!) on the nose with rolled up nespaper. or you can take it to a trainer or train her yourself.  and i always thought that if you look aways from it's eyes the dog takes it as a challenge? maybe i was wrong! lol  And I love pitbulls! my cousins is a big baby too!|`|2LaHZXWkaa	Hi, don't apologize for the length of your question ! I can give you my opinions but they will be just as long ! With respect to the licking, it could simply be a bonding behaviour. Animals in a 'family' will groom each other if they are comfortable with one another. Often a submissive dog will lick around the mouth of another dog, similar to what a puppy will do to get it's mother to regurgitate food. No, it doesn't meant your dog wants the other dog to throw up it's breakfast ! but it still could be a submissive dog greeting and showing respect to an 'elder'. The fact that the dogs are doing it to each other though, makes me think it is just a plain greeting/bonding thing.   As for the leaning, it can be a pushy 'pat me' kind of thing or it can just be the dog wanting to be close to you. It might be easier to determine her intent if I knew the circumstances under which she is doing this. With some dogs, it is definitely a demanding behaviour; much the same as a dog pushing their nose under your hand to be patted or putting a paw on your leg when you are sitting down. Depending on the dog's overall personality, it can develop into an obnoxious habit, but if you only pat your dog when YOU initiate it, you really shouldn't have a problem.  The staring. I think the person who stared down their rotti for 5 hours is lucky they didn't get bitten. Most dogs take a full on stare as a challenge, and rotties seem to be particularly offended by this. Being the 'boss' of your dog, or the 'dominant' one in the house, has more to do with (and greater lasting success) if you establish firm/fair rules, are CONSISTENT with what you tell your dog to do and when, and give them structure. Dogs are NOT WOLVES !!!! and for the most part trying to use 'pack mentality' on an animal that has no knowledge of what it is like to live in a pack , is only going to confuse them and perhaps frighten them. Long answer ;) but I hope some of it helps !
fSsTdD7qaa	It is a great start.  You have found an interesting subject to catch.  I suggest working on it more, take a bunch of them (Digital is cheap).  See if you can catch different aspects of this rider as she comes around again. You might experiment with cropping them to show the hands on the reins or some other interesting part of the image.  You are right, the same typical image gets boring and centering your subject is not necessarily the best idea.  I always check my subjects as I take them and see what potential there might be, and then continue, waiting for the subject to reach a similar point of view and take more. Once I know what I horse/rider might do, I anticipate the action and am ready.  Keep Trying and post some more.|`|DYBAjPFcaa	I really like them they are kinda abstract and center on one part of the subject in stead of the whole picture I like it kewl:}|`|RoPLmd2daa	Without being able to do a fully manual mode, they're okay.  If you're interested in photography, you really need to upgrade your camera from a point-and-shoot (which I'm guessing is what you have) to a higher-end camera, like a DSLR. If you have the chance to use a nicer camera, you should increase your shutter speed to get rid of the blurriness and photograph the brighter side of the horse so your shot doesn't get overwhelmed by shadows.  In the Horse section, people are too used to seeing full shots of horses (like for conformation, etc.), so they see the "artsiness" as an annoyance. However, I like how you're thinking about composition. Ever hear of the "rule of thirds"? Divide your photos into thirds on each side, so you get nine sections. There are four intersections where those lines meet, and that's where the eye is drawn naturally. So when you compose photos, have whatever you want to draw attention to at one of those intersections.  Also, with moving objects (like people running, horses jumping, etc.), have where they are going in front of them, so you can tell that they are going somewhere (which is what you've already done in a few photos).  If you don't have a photo editing program already, I would suggest starting out with Picasa- simple and easy to use to make minor fixes. Then once you get a better camera, you can upgrade to something like Paint Shop Pro Photo X2 or Adobe Photoshop.  If you would like to see some sample horse photography or more suggestions, feel free to message me.|`|oKmQYBFfaa	Depends what kind of photography you mean.  If you mean HORSE photography, they arnt the best..they are just like any average person's photo takign skills.  If you want to do better, buy a different camera and take some photography classes!  I learned photography on my own, then i toke some classes and it worked out!  Heres my site, if ypou go to the GGS Horses page you can see some of my photo's, they arent real horses, but they are modle horses...    http://www.freewebs.com/growinggrassstab...    Also, go to a horse photography site, and it will help you out wiht osme ideas!  :D|`|RUzBDX6Jaa	Not perfect, but pretty good.  You are right, perfectly centered is boring in action shots.  I dont like the first picture... of the horse's neck.  The jumping pictures are nice, ecspecially the first jumping picture.  Nice photos.  I wouldnt pay for them ;)|`|6wNwwY5oaa	there really grate i would buy them what bred of horse do you have he looks lovely  also when you ride u shouldn't  rest your hands on his neck  hope this helps|`|RZPLec5Eaa	They're okay, nothing I'd pay for, but they're fine for you to enjoy.     Also, ask this question in photography they can help more than I can.|`|QTT9380Yaa	they are ok   i have a little digital one too and it takes practice to get good at it  the first one looked like you were trying to be a little artsy but it didnt turn out because it was blurry and the angle was a little weird|`|oHL8qA42aa	They are pretty good! One piece of advice is to try and get the whole rider, as apposed to the entire horse. That way, there is less ground, and the riders will be happy! Great job though.|`|Oiabe82gaa	To be honest, these really aren't too good. Every shot has part of the subject missing, a pretty important thing to bare in mind for the future. Also I know you say having the subject matter centralized in the shot is boring, but I have to disagree...in most cases. You must start puting the subject center of the frame, that way the eye is attracted straight to it rather than being caught by something else!  I am assuming that you were using a digital automatic, and by these pics I would guess there is some delay.  For you to go out and buy yourself a DSLR is insane, totally and utterly insane. Firstly you are an early beginner,right now the end result will not be any better than what it is now. Secondly it will set you back the best part of $1,800, and that is too much for you to be spending right now.  You can get some excellent Digital Autos for less than a couple of hundred dollars, and that will suit you far better right now than spending crazy amounts of money on a DSLR.  If you decide to upgrade your camera make sure you get one with no delay. The Digital auto I use for everyday pics has no delay at all, it takes a shot when I press the button. I have seen some where there is a delay, some of a few seconds and this is no good for taking action shots...take a look at a Kodak camera!!!  Good luck!|`|ajJViUbcaa	Not to sound harsh, but each picture has apart of the subject cut off.  You need to zoom out a little.    I hope my advise is helpful, not hurtful.|`|8rVodF9vaa	Actually, I'm impressed. Whoever took those pictures has a really good sense of timing and captured the horse at the "best" part of his jump - over the top of the fence, knees tight, back feet leaving the ground. Thats not so easy to do over smaller fences.|`|c246ac86dcaacf7f923baa2e96250f43aa	Yes there were pretty good. I think i liked  15 the best but that is my opinion. keep workin you'll get it.

Please breed responsibly. Have homes lined up for the pups or keep them yourself. Irresponsible breeding gives every owner of an intact dog a bad name.    Someone on this board once recommended a site named "FriskyPups". I have never used this website, so I don't know how it works or if it's legitimate.|`|ajJViUbcaa	I'm sure you can find a spayed female on Pet Finder.|`|Xtqs0Hxzaa	He doesn't need a 'girlfriend'!!  Does he have AKC papers?  Have you shown him? Trialed him?  Is he a Canine Good Citizen?  Have you had him checked for hereditary diseases?    thought not.  please don't breed from him.|`|EPo7N1xBaa	Look on petfinder.com or check out your local pet shelters. Make sure you get your male neutered - we don't need any more dogs being born into this world, there's millions of them at the shelters waiting for their forever homes!
qgeI6Chxaa	What are the measurements? Chameleons need about a 2'x2'x4' enclosure or more. Also, be sure that it's made of mesh and not glass.
mTJ8wTs3aa	He probably just got scared from being out in the world for the first time. However, it's still important to observe him closely. He could have eaten something dangerous or chewed on an electrical cord in which case something could seriously be wrong. I would give him a few hours alone to recuperate and then check on him again. I've had hamsters escape before and they were very jumpy afterwards. They recovered fairly quickly and I expect that your hamster will do the same. Good luck!|`|7be888cba10a972887506bba12c3d350aa	Sounds to me like he's a bit jumpy & skittish from being out n about in the HUGE world of your house. Give him a bit of time & Im sure he'll calm down. Keep an eye on him for a couple days & try to keep the room he's in quiet & peaceful. If he's still not right in a few days or seems to get worse then you might want to take him to the vet...But Im sure he's just keyed up from being out. Best of luck??|`|Qc5PZnXpaa	he could either be scared, or he could have gotten hurt. You could take him to the vet and have him checked out.|`|uDka9xopaa	I had that happen with my rat w/in the next few days he'll be fine.
MGxDgsKZaa	Remember, even if the cat doesn't have rabies, those teeth and claws can do some nasty damage! Try to get a shelter or animal control to trap him for you. Otherwise the humane trap is a good idea if you can get one; I've done it before.|`|d84c38ade3be3fd9ae6101982709c8dcaa	You need to get a trap which some vets will provide to catch a ferrel cat .

vS1Z0inOaa	Could you identify what kind of turtle you have and describe the shell issue? Sorry, I can't see the picture... In any case, I strongly advise against the VitaShell--cancel your order if you can. VitaShell is mostly just wax, which does give the shell a nice shine. However, the wax makes an unbreatheable cover over the shell that clogs up its pores and stunts the shell's growth. This product is purely hype. The best thing you can do for your turtle's shell is to clean it with warm waterand a soft toothbrush, and, if yours is a water turtle, make sure that her basking rock is completely dry so she can dry herself off including the bottom shell and use an open setup or screen top, ot a hood, so that there's not too much humidity in the tank.     Is the problem you're referring to a white cheesy growth on the shell, or are the scutes (overlapping scale that cover the shell) peeling off to reveal red, moist, raw bone underneath? Does she stink? If you see any of this, she almost certainly has shell rot and I can advise you about that. If it just lookslike the scutes are peeling off to reveal dry, clean healthy bone underneath, that is completely normal. Turtles that are healing from a past, inactive case of shell rot or young, growing turtles will do this. If yours is a water turtle, a dy basking area is especially important at this time or water can get trapped in between the loose scutes and mold or shell rot will develop easily. But with a dry place to go there should be no problems at all.|`|mxrlZEweaa	When they grow sometimes their shells molt. You have a nice set up for her.|`|WRXc0sqwaa	well its just molt or if you had it out side before you took it inside it might of got alge on its shell just scrubi its shell with a old tooth brush|`|HD75mkRtaa	A turtle's natural habitat is filthy to us. Stagnant warm water, yuck. Looks like a healthy case of algae. In nature he'd probably just rub on a piece of wood if it bothered him but most likely he'd use it as camouflage to ambush snails and fish. You can scrub it off him but my red-eared slider hated my 'housekeeping' of him.|`|GHpcc5iKaa	i think she is just molting, i had a little turtle a while back and he did that too.
K5IOSGXAaa	Emjay is wrong, love birds can live as singles very nicely. You have to spend a lot of time with your bird and you will become it's "flock". The bird is scared right now and not sure what happened. Just sit near the cage and spend a lot of time speaking to the bird, take your time with him and he will be just fine. Move slowly around him and let him get used to you. It will take some time but is worth it.|`|Mg8zk1n7aa	Emjay is not wrong, your bird will sometimes be lonely without a companion. It's true that you will become his 'flock', but you can't be there all the time. Yes, he will likely survive without a buddy, but wouldn't it be better he thrived? And it is very, very enjoyable to watch them interact/preen/sing with each other.    Hope this helped.|`|6d60af6e893d471d538d1bd9a0456432aa	he will be very lonely and is very likely to die from it.

And if he does pass away, you shouldn't have another pup for a few years if he's gone to the bathroom on your property because the Parvo virus stays around for a while. Everything even bleach usually can't get the virus out.  I hope your pup gets better, and maybe you could ask your family for funding. It could save her life. Run all the tests you can though.

We had to bring her to the Emergency room, last Easter.  They said she was very very sick.  She did pull through.  I hope it's not Parvo, but it does sound like it.|`|FFowxJa2aa	I am soo sorry... I know a lot about dogs, but I've never heard of this. Even the vet can't figure out what's wrong? That's harsh. Maybe try a different vet? Right away!|`|73npx1tbaa	You should be asking the vet what is wrong with the animal, not yahoo! I'm sure they wont "unplug" your pet just because you don't have enough money but now would be the time to ask about a payment plan or making the decision to put him to sleep! I can tell you if you put the dog to sleep because of money you will regret it. As a young mother I had to make that choice and still have a hard time dealing wiith the decision I made. good luck!|`|ADLupVviaa	Sounds like it could be Parvo but as im not a vet I cant be sure. I would be nagging and pushing the vets to do more|`|AA10705401	the same thing happened to my dog ........and it wound up to be the parvo virus. I hope that it is not but i do believe it to be parvo.|`|bUL2Pyx3aa	It sounds like the tapeworms are the problem or she has a blockage
4aAhEK9daa	VERY unlikely - unless it escaped from a breeder or someone who purchased one from a breeder.  The Savannah is a very large hybrid cat and not very common.  Have you taken it to a vet to see if its microchipped and/or noticed animal control that you found a cat?    What you're desribing sounds like a tabby cat of no particular breed. You can email me some pics if you want.  Regardless of what it is or isn't someone may be looking for this cat.  You can also check with your paper - most let people run "Found" ads for free.|`|P8hOtEdOaa	I doubt it.  Savannahs can be very expensive.  It is highly unlikely that you found one, especially a kitten.  Owners are very careful about their cats.|`|Pj5i73DYaa	I'm not as good as Percy-and-Penny, but I know about cats. I do doubt that it is a savannah, I will tell you what my exact thoughts if you send me a picture. You (obviously) don't have to, but just a thought.    Thank you!

tdN2ouxAaa	I have a Golden Retriever, and I'm Black, so we obviously don't look like each other! Although, I must admit that the both of us are rather good looking (hee, hee!).     But I will say that she and I both gain and lose weight together. When I get chunky, she gets chunky. When I lose weight, she looses weight along with me. :0)    I do see a lot of other people that look like their dogs out here in Southern California, though.|`|gTXUcd1maa	Yes. I think they just come to look like it after a while. :)|`|Za8DpfvQaa	I own A Golden Retriever. She is beautiful, and I am beautiful! Haha, I sound so conceded! Oh well.....

Thats just silly.|`|RoDjZKknaa	I think people tend to pick dogs that match their personality, therefore, they look like their dogs!  Sometimes people want to be something they are not so they pick a dog to represent what they want to be, so they DON'T look like their dog.  I don't know if I look like my dog??

3sB49YNnaa	Ain't pet stores wonderfully competant in sexing pigs :-(    The deal on pregnancy risk is that there is a risk associated with any birth, I've seen figures of mortality ranging from 5-20%. In older sows the risk goes up some, usually from obesity.  Finally, there is the issue of "pelvic fusion."  As you  know, the pelvis is "hinged" with a piece of cartelige.  If it hasn't been stretched relatively early in life, it can calcify making delivery impossible.  This risk increases the older the sow is at first delivery.  It is only an increased risk, not a sure thing.  I know of cases of sows over 2 delivering for the first time without problems.  I also know of cases where they couldn't deliver and died during a C-section.  Fortunately, I know more stories with good outcomes compared to those with poor ones|`|bEQn0Vrtaa	You truly know every thing to do and just need to talk and that is a good thing. i am sure you will do just fine at the time of the birth. I will share my terrible experience only so you may not have to. I had a situation very much the same, and at that time not knowing a lot about guinea pigs when she went into labor i truly thought she would handle things just like all the cats and dogs i had been raised with Well let me tell you it is a completely different story with guineas and allowed mine to be in labor to long before taking her to a vet and i ended up losing all of them. So if she appears  to be in labor more than a half an hour get her to a vet, in the case of mine  one of the babies was across the birth canal not allowing the birth to happen and mom got to stressed.|`|26PPwzrWaa	The only thing you can do is go to the vet for help. I figure you have a good cavy vet based on your question and details.     Thats similarly how we got mama. I figure the pregnant piggy has had a litter before, but the only way to tell would be for a vet to see her.     You may get to plan a c-section for her if the vet decides it is too risky to wait for her to have them. I dont know how far along she is, but since you cant feel movement from the babies yet, I figure she is only a month along, at most 6 weeks. Could you post pics? Mama had 4 in her when we took her in and she looked like a disc. They were kicking the last couple weeks too.
h3hrrtW2aa	His nails might be bothering him. My dog does it every time his nails start to grow too much. He even tries to pull them out with his teeth! Get his nails clipped and filed down and see if that helps :-)|`|icUQhIE6aa	If it don't start biting you, try to see if there is anything sticking in the paws, any rashes or other irritations caused by something getting on its paws.  Though it sounds more likely to be a sociological problem that maybe again obscure needing Professional help.  The place you got it from may of noticed this behavior so ask there too.|`|ovP2ODmwaa	i have a pure breed black lab who does that too. im pretty sure its just a habit like a human bitting his or her nails. i also have a friend who has a pure breed black lab who does the same thing and they say that her paws are totally normal. so i wouldnt worry abou it too much unless his or her paws look irratated then either go see a vet or get some soothing doggie lotion. trust me the loition works!|`|jSBtdhf0aa	could be his nais , fleas between his toes  you should talk to a vet about it.|`|zeXMAsF7aa	my dog did that until we changed his food we used cheap wal-mart brand and its full of wheat and corn we started feeding his diamond naturals and in a couple months he completely stop licking and chewing at his feet.|`|c2c3a447ca6a35c94ffed12e17bf8913aa	Talk to your vet.  My neighbor's dog does that due to allergies.  The vet has helped to treat the allergies.|`|ebe7bb94d9e93512e6ba798faf11e91daa	My dog is a black lab and she used to do that too. The vet said she was allergic to the kind of grass in our yard. It was irritating her paws. Also, if the grass is wet that will trigger the itching as well. Take him to the vet and see if they can give him something for this reaction.|`|cMksTuRhaa	THis time of year, our dogs bite and lick their paws alot too.  We have a lot of snow on the ground and I think their paws get cold and chapped.  I've put some vaseline or bag balm on it and that seems to help.|`|W07vMTQvaa	My dog does this if her paws are wet.  My neighbors dog has a terrible allergy and chews her paws to the point of rawness.  They had to change her diet and give her meds to help her.      Your dog should see a vet.  We found out that my dog had a yeast infection on her paws and it was quite painful for her.  Good luck to you and your pup!
ucxBvsX6aa	Pit bulls get dry skin really easy. And some do get dandruff, if that's the case then The more you bathe him or do a flea dip irritates the skin more.Your best bet is to wait a few days and if he continues to scratch is use tea-tree oil. It works very well with fleas. Just put a drop into his shampoo, shake it and rinse lather and repeat!  It should work!   And if it doesn't he need to go see a vet.|`|s2Voa2jMaa	uhmm go to the vet cuz when people who have no idea what there doing try fixing things it makes it worse just go the vet
c90696a851f3ee0c6b1f63f7f595eca4aa	First off, he's stinking adorable. Secondly, your question actually is a question. Thirdly, it's very difficult to gauge how big he will be without knowing how much he weighs now, etc. However, if you got him from a reputable breeder, he should fall within the breed standard. (And of course if you feed him correctly and make sure he get exercise.)|`|280d96ad7b5e9ffad03a34a66cac5db0aa	Aww, he has an old man face! Anyway, male Alaskan Malamutes are typically 80-95 pounds and 24-26 inches at the shoulder.|`|nYv65TlEaa	beautiful and no idea how big,Good Luck|`|EPo7N1xBaa	HE's a beautiful dog! Wow! He's gonna be very big at full grown if those pics were at only 9 weeks old! That's crazy. Good luck and take good care of that beautiful creature!|`|LGV9uiFLaa	AwwwWwwwWwwWWwwww He is so cute!!! I want him and he is going to be a big dog around 70-100 pounds!|`|5atczOqzaa	He is beautiful he looks almost exactly like one of mine but mine is a Malamute Wolf mix.     My River is going to be around 130 pounds.   I would say if he is only 9 weeks is this kennel a large or medium or small how much does he weigh now? all this is something we would need to know but he will probably be around 75 to 110 depends.   I ran into a guy once that had a pure malamute that was 160 pounds he was huge. so you really never now My River is only 4 months old and he is almost the exact same size as my 3 year old male husky.     Malamutes are considered xlarge dogs. They can get quite large.|`|s2Voa2jMaa	OMFG YOUR DOH IS GONNAA BE BIG AND HE'S PROBLY A WOLF MIX AND HE IS SUPER CUTE BUT LIKE ALL DOG OWNER S I THINK MINES CUTER NO OFFNECE LOL BUT I WOULD ADOPT YOUR PUP IN A SEC LOL WELL GOOD LUCK AND TREAT THAT DOG WITH RESPECT AND LOVE HIM ALOT|`|3lWkamSEaa	I haven't had any problems with my alaskan malamute.
Xtqs0Hxzaa	Well, first you have to understand how dogs learn. they don't think like people. When he does something right, you praise him the MOMENT he does it. If he does something wrong, you don't get pissed off and ignore him for a day. Dogs live in the moment.    your dog also needs to be calm-submissive towards you. You must be a confident, calm-assertive leader for him to repect you. Without the leader and follower relationship with your dog, training and living with your dog will be a challenge.     Make sure your dog gets the right amout of exercise, discipline and affection. Many problem behaviors in dogs are a result of a lack of exercise. Take him for a walk twice a day, everyday. Discipline is very important for your dog to respect you. set rules and boundries. Be consistant and reward good behavior. Only give affection when he's calm and submissive.     Use treats, toys and plenty of praise. I would suggest enrolling in a dog obedience class, as you seem inexperienced and it would be best for you to have a good dog trainer to guide you.|`|E7TkNO00aa	Use treats and many complements, then start using less treats until he is fully trained Most of all, have alot of patience with your dog. He will love you more.|`|eDAX46b9aa	look on the internet. there is so many ways. always have a treat in hand as a reward! that is important. so she knows that when she does the trick, she did the right thing. Good luck. there are probably better responses then this but, it was a nice attempt...|`|bMYv0fBHaa	You need to start with a bond. If he's not respecting you, you won't get very far.    Other than that, it's training. When he does it, reward with a treat and heavy praise. Eventually, rely on heavy praise and use less and less treats until you use none. Since you'll want to praise him every time he does the action, it's easier to use your words than always have treats on hand.|`|TPdfgtMyaa	go to youtube.com and type in "how to train dog to sit"|`|qrwaA0toaa	First is you need a bond- start to bond yourself in someway and love each other a whole lot  Second is exercise- without exercise you'll get nowhere and the walk help bonds you  Third is disciplene- tell the dog no and bad dog when you don't like what he does, say it like you mean it and give the dog the message that what he is doing is wrong- all dogs want to listen , but how can they if you don't let them know what they're doing is wrong  Forth is reward- praise your dog and reward your dog when he does something right, that way he knows he should do that again and he knows you are proud of him.   Fifth is stick with this 100%-Most people say they do this stuff- the problem is they only go half way- you cant do 10% or 20% or 50% or 80% or even 99.9%- YOU MUST DO THIS 100% ALL THE WAY|`|s2Voa2jMaa	TAKE A TREAT WHEN HE SEES THE FOD HE'LL WANT IT AND KEEP REPEATINA WORD AND SHOW HIM WAHT YOU WANT HIM TO DO AND WHEN HE DOES GIVE HIM THE TREAT AND HUG AND KISS HIM AND BE PATEICE YOU DIDN'T LEARN HOW TO READ OVER NIGHT SO SAME THING WITH DOGS|`|aEklYlhraa	i agree with  1  when i got my first dog, i wanted to know the same question.  get a nice bond with the pup and then u can start to train. I would be stern but not too stern b/c he might think you're punishing him if ur too stern. bust out the treats and reward him when he listens to u. little by little u can start giving him less treats but still reward him so he knows hes doing gewd.  once u've got the bond and he trained a little..u can go more into it =]  gewd luck!!
25660b99958e6df83f2c651134b3891faa	usually a mating call.    sometimes it is telling the human they want something|`|FgyE9Rthaa	Some cats are more vocal than others.  Of our 4 cats, 1 will meow longer and louder than the others.    It really does seem that he wants your attention.  Try playing with him about 15 min before bedtime to tire him out.  The twisting his neck and plopping over action is one that our cats do sometimes when they are playing with one another or want to be petted, then they run off, like they want to be chased.  And please have him neutered, if you haven't already.  This should help him become more settled.|`|BfpchxN2aa	Most of the time the cat wants out of the room to use the cat box|`|DX11PH2zaa	cause they are in need of a mate or sense another male in territory if a male.
5PsKGss7aa	Yes puppy's/dogs can have nightmares.  Have you tried waking him if he's sleeping?  And if it isn't a dream & he's up & still shaking, you shouldn't be ANNOYED you should be concerned on why..|`|jSBtdhf0aa	well its a known fact that they dream so i suppose they could have nightmares. i have a german shepard and sometimes he can be a nightmare.|`|tPGxPDvBaa	Dogs do dream but it is your theory that it is a nightmare.  Might not be a nightmare to them but either way they dream , good or bad we don't know.|`|vFCQcRNEaa	It's likely he's just having 'puppy dreams' AKA dreaming about running and playing and his muscles unconsciously twitch. Also, if it's a young puppy, it could be that he's growing.|`|ebe7bb94d9e93512e6ba798faf11e91daa	my dog has nightmares too. animals do have them you know. just when your dog is having one gently touch them to wake them slightly. how do you stop having a nightmare?|`|Yu7y6yfraa	It is very common for dogs to dream.  He may not be having a nightmare - just dreaming that he is moving.|`|M3r1s6oYaa	first of all its probably cold. Second of all, dogs dont have nightmares.|`|Do2pJx8Aaa	Your dog text messaged MY dog and told him that your snoring is annoying.|`|ADLupVviaa	Its normal. My staffy barks, growls, yells, runs, twitches and drools in her sleep. Its not something you can stop either. It can be reduced though if you wear your dog out before bed time with walks in the park or beach and lots of play time.|`|tdN2ouxAaa	Your dog is just dreaming (not sure if it's a doggy-nightmare or not). I know it's annoying, but you can't do anything about it.    My dog barks, shakes, quivers, licks her tongue out, and kicks her legs around in her sleep. So just be glad that your dog doesn't dream as heavily as mine does!
B6zl0AJDaa	Sadly, navicular does NOT get better.  I have a former reining/cutting horse who I use Epona shoes on him.  We keep the works light but keep him moving.      http://www.eponashoe.com/|`|8bTder08aa	The progression of the degenerative changes to the navicular bone varies from horse to horse, but progression is inevitable.  Your horse may seem to be better because of the break he got.  You might want to take note of that and try to plan his activity schedule so that he gets some breaks.    The horses I've known that had navicular were all hunters, and the initial progression of the disease was pretty fast.  After that, careful shoeing and very careful management kept them going for 2-3 years, but it was a day-by-day kind of thing.  I don't think any vet would be willing to give you a firm prediction of how your horse will do because each case is different and there are so many variables.    If you're really serious about trying to keep your horse functioning usefully for as long as possible, I'd suggest you sit down with your vet and talk to him/her about what you want to do with the horse, and ask what you can do to help your horse last longer.     Good luck.|`|EQvAbyvcaa	So how do you KNOW?  Did you have x-rays taken?  Generally, even with x-rays, it can be difficult to make a diagnosis of navicular.  Usually horses that are navicular are either overworked when they are fatigued and/or the trimming/shoeing is the problem with the latter being a primary culprit.  The center of gravity of the feet are off and the weight is too far forward in the foot instead of on the back of the foot where it should be.  Navicular horses can be made quite comfortable by pulling their shoes and giving them a proper barefoot trim.  If there is true navicular deterioration and degenerative inflammatory changes in the ligaments and tendons, that is permanent and cannot be repaired or healed.  The horse can, however, be quite comfortable and useful for casual riding.  With navicular syndrome verified, there should be no jumping or running in circles as those movements produce too much stress from shear force that comes with the sharp turns at fast gaits.  You don't say why his feet get tender in the summer as opposed to not being tender at other times??  If the center of gravity is not corrected in his feet, the pads will be useless.  They will not relieve the pressurre truly.  They may offer some type of support, but the problem is still present and additional damage is being done.  In the initial stages of the development of navicular syndrome, it is the ligaments and tendons that produce the inflammation that begins the damaging process that leads to the erosion of the bone.    You should get a definite diagnosis from a professional with diagnostic tests to either confirm or rule out the presence of navicular syndrome.  Once that is accomplished, you can have information that will allow you to make an informed decision ---the best one for the horse.  Good luck to you.  This can be very difficult to manage and you can put your horse at great risk.  The key will be getting a farrier that GETS IT that she shoes have to be pulled so the horse can heal|`|XHHkBkwOaa	I have heard of nerving a horse specifically for horses diagnosed with navicular disease.....  Although some may think it's not cruel and some do it can help the horses quality of life especially if it was diagnosed young!!  you said your horse wasn't limping but alot of horses with navicular diesase will put most of the weight in the toes not the heel which in turn makes it less painfull!! but doing this makes the disease worse.    QUESTIONS?  Does his coronet band/hoof feel hot before and after riding or just after riding or maybe when he stands for long periods of time??    you can get your horse surgically nerved so he does not feel anything in his feet.   but this comes along with many other dangers too lik your horse not being able to feel where he is placing his feet which could lead to some unsure footedness or tripping.....    do you shoe him?? obviously you would but there are alternatives which you could speaj to your farrier about horses with NAV to need to be trimmed and shod more often aswell.|`|gzQAIahaaa	Hey... this has nothing to do with what you asked but oh well... I had a horse with the same condition, a retired horse who had it really bad, we had him shod with the cytec shoes and he improved heaps :).
nzcvxCJSaa	You should contact your local shelter/pound and let them know that you have found the puppy. They will give you advice as to the best way to deal with the situation.    They may have already been contacted by the pup's owner, and therefore can reunite the puppy with the rightful owner. They may also ask you to bring the pup in to the shelter to stay for a period of time. If this is the case they would usually give you the first option of adopting the puppy if it was not claimed.     If the shelter is ok with you keeping the puppy at your house make sure you get it checked for a microchip either at the shelter or a vets. If it is microchipped it will make it easier to contact the owners. Also, it would be great if you could put up some "found" posters around the place and let your local vet clinics know that you have found the pup. Don't include ALL the info about the puppy and this way if anyone says its their pup you can check they are being honest by asking, for example, what colour their pup is.    By all means, do not just keep the puppy. Imagine how sad you would be if your dog went missing and someone had found it but just decided to keep it. Even if he looked like a stray there is no guarantee that he wasn't just adopted by someone from a pound and was still looking a bit underfed.     Also, make sure that if no one claims the pup and your family does decide to keep it, that your dad is 100% commited. It is him, as an adult, that will be responsible for the dog so you want him to really want it, not just be pushed into it by you kids :)|`|FR2bKa7iaa	DO NOT PUT OUT FLYER'S.  It sounds like to me that this puppy came from a pretty abusive home, so by putting out flyer's you would just be putting it back into the lions mouth.  If you cant keep the pup take it to the nearest shelter and they will look after it.  If you decide to keep it good luck with him, sounds like he has found a good home anyway.|`|SqI4CEtnaa	first thing take the dog to a shelter or vet to see if it has a microchip    if it doesnt, and your dad really doesnt want to keep it, take the dog to a shelter and see if they can take him in|`|dsTVW1WTaa	Put up posters. Saying 'found dog' And in the newspaper.    I know that sounds silly espically how you said he looked underfed, but once when my father was a truckdriver he got a puppy. And it jumped out of the car, and he wandered the streets for weeks until somebody called the number on his coller.  And its not unusual for dogs to not have collers so dont think just because he doesnt hes a stray.    Still after that, and if nobody claims him, Try to see if your dad will let you keep him. After all you were being responsible by trying to find the owners ;]    And if he STILL doesnt,   See if you can find a good home to give him too, then..if all else fails theres the SPCA.|`|Z3OTphZhaa	Well if you don't plan on taking the puppy in, I would call a local shelter to see if they can take the puppy in.  It obviously isn't getting fed so I would try to take it somewhere so it can get the proper food, treatment, and hopefully a good home.|`|Xtqs0Hxzaa	Take the puppy to the vet so they can scan for a microchip. If he has one, they will contact the owner. If he doesn't, you have two options; 1. take him to a no-kill shelter, or 2. put up "FOUND" flyers around the neighborhood with info about the pup and your contact details, and if no one claims him after two or three weeks, you again have two options. 1. Get him vaccinated, microchipped and wormed and keep him or 2. take him to a no-kill shelter.    If you are thinking of keeping him, you have to understand that keeping two dogs is double the cost and work.
oPrq7v7Saa	I'm a chinchilla breeder in Northwestern Pennsylvania. I only have the "regular sized" chinchillas, as you call them. Feel free to contact me.|`|TIGZp5yzaa	http://www.chinchillaclub.com/breeder/|`|2Go0Y0xnaa	There are a large number of breeders in PA, all across the state.  I cannot name them all off the top of my head, but I can provide you with a link where you can go and find many of them.

Ey1Mb4FAaa	Ok well instead of given you a small bit or information or wrong information here i link to one of the best site for info on gerbils    http://www.geocities.com/Heartland/Plain...     Also gerbil are the less smelliest rodent of ALL  Second smarts to the rat.    They loved being held as long as you tame them right people how say they not i every had gerbils of there own are didn't look after them right but in both case i would listen to them at all.|`|xyPpruSjaa	Gerbils are WONDERFUL! They're very social so they need to be housed in pairs of the same sex. They aren't the cuddly type, so if you hold them, you have to let them run from hand to hand, on your pants, on your shirt, and on your shoulders. Except be careful with the shoulders because they can climb down your back! It tickled so much :] They very very rarely bite and only do if they feel truely threatened. They might 'nip' you but this doesn't hurt, they're just curious or your hand smells like food or they want to be put down.     Housing:  Plastic and wire cages are unacceptable and proper housing should be in a 10,15, or 20 gallon aquarium with a mesh lid. The reasons that plastic and wire cages are unacceptable are because your gerbils can chew through plastic, they will bite on the bars all day, and they will kick bedding all over the floor. And, face it, those rip off plastic garbage cages couldn't keep themselves together for more than 1 hour. Which technically means they fall apart and aren't worth dirt, but the pet store prices 'em high. Believe it or not, aquariums are actually cheaper than most cages. You need a mesh lid for them though because gerbils can JUMP. If you plan to get an aquarium for your gerbils, you might want to attach the water bottle by using WHITE sticky backed velcro. Sold at a hardware store.     Bedding:  PLEASE PLEASE do not use cedar, pine, dusty, or SCENTED beddings. Dusty beddings can be a nuissance and they can cause respiratory infections, this is the same with scented, cedar, and pine beddings. Although cheap, they're deadly.     The best bedding over all is Sunseed Freshworld bedding sold at petsmart. It's the BEST and 1 small bag fills my 20 gallon aquarium with a little left over. I looove it. Alternatives are aspen, care fresh, and NON SCENTED soft sorbent. Be careful, just like us, gerbils can develop allergies to certain beddings. Mine developed a skin allergy from aspen. That's how I found the sunseed bedding. If you notice them itching and sneezing, it's time to switch to something else.    Toys:  Gerbils, like any other rodent and even us, get bored VERY easily. They need lots of toys and love. Great toys are wooden toys from the pet store (plastic will be chewed and can be harmful), clay flower pots, glass jars, those edible toys from the pet store, cereal boxes, macaroni boxes, a wheel, plastic cat toy balls, toilet paper tubes, chew toys, etc. Before you give your pet a box, make sure there is no glue on it. Also make sure it doesn't have a glossy surface, or that the ink doesn't come off in your hand.     Gerbils need chew toys to wear their teeth down so cardboard tubes and boxes should do the trick because gerbils will almost immediatly start chewing on them. You can also buy chew toys from the store, but they love cardboard a LOT and sometimes ignore chew toys from the pet store.     Oh and by the way, gerbils do not smell at all so if smell is a problem, it'll be NO problem with gerbils since they are desert animals and produce very little waste. About 2-3 drops of urine a day.     OH! And gerbils are NOT nocturnal so they'll be ready to play during the day when you are. They might sleep during the day because basically they are asleep for periods of time during day AND night. They won't mind if you wake them up though, unlike hamsters which will get stressed, but generally they'll be awake during the day and most active in the evening and awake SOMETIMES in the night. Don't worry, you won't have to wait 'til 12 am just to get a glanse at your gerbils.      Good luck! if you need any help or have any questions email me at averyrazno@yahoo.com :D!|`|aEQWHUcWaa	what ya wanna know what dey eat how much dey drink ect.   They eat gerbil food dah  dont drink much  don't pooh much so ya don't have to clean the cage dat offen  dey are awke during da day  don't like to be held  are fast dah!  can be trained tricks  can be taught to jump over jumps look it up on youtube real sweet  Jamie|`|H3GrDAXPaa	Your gerbil need a friend. They go crazy alone.  The gerbils love a bowl of chinchilla-sand for bathroom and if you give them a huge aquarium of hay they will make a hideaway and secret tunnels and have lots of fun and make little nests.  For play they like to eat cardboard and chew stuff, find some wood and they will enjoy their toys.  Make sure they have clean water with extra b vitamin and for a treat you may offer a raisin.  You can have two males together if they are friends.
FfBll2n8aa	To be banned, they'd have to be breaking the law. The law stipulates what kind of environment an animal needs, and what has to be done to look after it. So long as the puppy farm meets these legal requirements, no matter how miserable the dogs are, no-one has any power to stop them. The RSPCA and other animal rights groups hate these places, but have no legal right to act.  The same applies to many commercial farming practices. Compared to the way pigs and chickens are farmed, dogs have it pretty good. Again, because of the law, farm animals can be treated and kept in conditions that would sicken many members of the public if they knew what was being done. The only real way to stop these businesses is to make it unprofitable to operate - that means not buying their product - but since people are often more interested in saving a dollar, or getting the latest, popular designer-dog because everyone else has one, they will go to whatever source is cheapest and easiest. Why pay top dollar for a well-bred dog, and have to wait in line for your pup, when you can just get whatever looks cute in the petshop window, today??  Why go to a shelter and get a homeless dog, when they aren't cute little puppies, or they aren't a "popular" cross, when you can just go to the petshop and get whichever one you fancy on the spur of the moment?  I only wish people would research more into where their animals come from, and just as importantly, what happens to the pups that aren't sold!|`|vt8dJNhdaa	........|.....  ........|..........2 points ........|||"|""\__  ........|__________________|||_|___|)  ........!(@)'(@)""""**!(@)(@)****!(@)|`|vPPbV72Naa	because the us doesn gfjf

FfBll2n8aa	I've owned an Akita and a friend of mine has bred them for 30 years. They have many good attributes, and are bred these days to be more easily handled than they used to be.   That being said, you could end up like me and find yourself with an "abnormally aggressive one" - as it was put by the dog trainer I worked with from the time she was 3 months to 4 years old. I had no end of problems with that dog, and I did everything right. She was heavily socialised right from the moment I got her at 8 weeks. She started acting aggressive a couple of months later, and no amount of help by NINE different trainers made any difference.  It wasn't until 2 years after I got her that the breeder admitted they had needed to separate her from the rest of the litter as she was playing so rough with her litter mates that she actually injured two of them. Had I known that I wouldn't have chosen her.  If you get one, since you are inexperienced, don't go for the boldest, biggest pup in the litter - believe me, it's not worth it! Choose one of the "followers", rather than the leader. That will at least give you a pup that isn't going to be headstrong right from the start. It will give you a chance to begin training and socialisation while the pup is still happy for you to be leader.   I think the biggest danger with these dogs, and any other dog bred for aggression of any type (hunting, fighting) is that new owners severely understimate just how much work goes into training one of these dogs to get the best out of it.  When I got my dog, I really wanted one that I could walk in public, play with at home and have fun with. I could do none of these things however without a LOT of stress and preparation beforehand!  If you end up with a dog on the more dominant end of the scale, you may find yourself spending so much time managing behaviour, that you don't get to enjoy the dog as much as you thought. You may also be OVERestimating your ability to dominate a dog that will challenge you every moment!  So, choosing the right pup is very important. Following the breeders recommendations for socialisation and discipline is very important. I would suggest you enrol yourself and your dog into a training class as soon as possible, and stick with it. It sounds like you've done all the research, so you're as prepared as most people are, but the practice can be more demanding than just reading about it, so be prepared for the possibility of some hard work, if that's how it turns out.  Personally, my experiences with this dog put me off owning another dog of any breed for 10 years, even though my friend breeds them and has always produced very handlable and reliable Akitas. I would never want to have to go through all that again. I loevd her dearly, but the stress of owning a dog that is so dominant, aggressive and powerful really took a lot of the joy from having a dog.  I didn't do anything wrong - I followed all instructions given to me, and I never mistreated my dog. I just got unlucky by getting a pup that needed a stronger handler than I was capable of (and I'm no whimp!).   Talk to some owners of Akitas face to face. Ask them for advice, and if you find one who can recommend a breeder from good personal experience, that will be able to pair you up with a suitable pup for your personality, you'll be well on the way to an enjoyable experience.|`|Za8DpfvQaa	Time, Commitment, Patience are key.    From what you wrote, it sounds like you have done lots of research. I think you could handle one.    If you socialize and train your dog as a young puppy, he will not turn around and bite you. Trainers/Owners teach their dog to aggressive.    Training Classes are great.    Good Luck!|`|RFfTjnxzaa	One of my neighbors has two Akitas, and I really can't see them attacking anyone. But I have seen Akitas that didn't look particularly savory.    You have to be a very tough leader with this breed.    I've noticed that some boarding facilities flat out will not accept Akitas.    If you're planning on spaying or neutering your new puppy, why not try adopting? There are plenty of purebred Akitas and Akita mixes out there. Shelter dogs are generally up to date with shots and have already been spayed/neutered (but some shelters jump the gun and fix before 6 months which is too early, so be careful).|`|MGAmNxddaa	Akitas are Strong willed and animal aggressive,by nature.Training classes are a great idea.Would this be a puppy or an adult you would be getting?Will he be kept indoors,so neighborhood animals are safe?I would worry about the neighbors smaller dogs than I would worry about them turning on you.I have meant some very loving Akitas,but the same dogs escaped their pens and killed some prize sheep next door.|`|AA12149194	I can answer at least part of your question, but I'll leave the rest of it for people that have experience with the breed..    If your dog is properly trained and socialized, it won't turn on you or anyone else... No breed is naturally mean or vicious unless mistreated or trained to be that way.   It depends on the owner, with any dog of any breed... How well you train it and socialize it with other people and animals.. If you know what the breed needs and you're willing to go out of your way to provide those things, it really shouldn't be an issue. If you're able to establish that you're the pack leader and give it the amount of exercise that it needs... You'll be fine. :)|`|4hNRTWtDaa	I think it's great you're doing so much research, but do you think this is really the time to get a dog?  In 2 years you'll probably go to college (I'm assuming).  Who will take care of the dog then?  It sounds like you're pretty responsible and mature, but please do consider the timing, and other things you'll be doing in your life.  Also, consider the costs of having a dog that size.  Do you work, so that you can pay for whatever he might need?  Food, medical care, all that stuff?|`|W07vMTQvaa	My friend has two champion Akita's and they are very well trained.  They have spent hours and hours working with their dogs.  Any dog can turn out to be aggressive.      You should look for an Akita club in your area and visit some of the member meetings or make contact with the members before you make this decision.  They DO require a very strong leader.|`|vPPbV72Naa	mom|`|ADLupVviaa	Dogs always attack for a reason.     Socialise him right from day one. Take him everywhere possible while he is still young. the cruicial and defining point in a dog life is the first 18 weeks of its life. Expose your pup to every situtation it may encounter in its life time by 18 weeks old and you will have a brilliant life partner. Also, have a training programe ready and start that from day one as well. And make sure you always use Positive Re-enforcement based training. And of course book him in for puppy training as well.    I did all this with my staffy when she was a pup and shes a well adjusted dog. Shes shown no agression to anyone and gets on with all dogs just fine. Something you could even do is join an Akita club or something and get support and advice from other akita owners and speaking with dog trainers does go amiss either.|`|N8mZuVahaa	Another goal is to give the dog enough exercise and mental stimulation.  A job to do.      Another thing to consider is insurance.  Many home owner insurance are targeting certain breeds.   Also some communities require home owners to have special insurance on certain breeds of dogs.    Because of people not taking the time to do what you have, research the breed and acknowledge the amount of time they require this has become a big issue when choosing a breed of dog.|`|4f28b4094a6709e18a06d875e2ffb0c9aa	akita's are not a good first dog,you may well end up in trouble.. bad idea
nzcvxCJSaa	Active  Confident  Physically strong enough to deal with a large muscular dog  Firm but not rough  Consistent, sets rules and sticks by them  Have experience training dogs  Have done research on the breed  Have spent time with breeders or owners of Akitas and their dogs  Best if they do not have any other small pets (very high prey drive coupled with the ability to chase down and easily kill small animals)  Best if they are happy to have the Akita as an only dog or are willing to look for a proven dog friendly Akita (low tolerance for other dogs)  Is ready to provide lots of socialisation especially if getting a pup  Does not expect the dog to be social with strangers (generally aloof/territorial)  Understands how to deal with food/object possessiveness  Does not have young children  Understands the potential legal liabilities of owning an Akita (public perception, future breed bans, insurance problems, increased chance of lawsuits)   Is not too houseproud (an Akita will shed copious amounts)  Is ready for lots of brushing   Has a very secure yard that is dig proofed with high fences(Akitas can jump high and are also known to dig) to prevent escape    Not all Akitas are alike, this is just a generalisation of what a good Akita owner should be. As always, there are exceptions to the rule. So if you own an Akita and feel you are a good owner but you don't fit these requirements i guess you are just lucky! Please don't take offence where it is not meant :)|`|4vhMqU40aa	An Akita is a very BIG dog... Nobody is PERFECT... but a caring Akita owner would... Take the dog out for at least an hour a day for walks...Brush their fur AT LEAST 3 times a week for about 30min each time... Have lots of patience training them or trying to :P weekly...Have LOTS of money because they eat tonnes of food considering their size... and also paying for BIG dog vet bills... Wouldn't mind having to vacuum up dog fur every other day...Give LOTS and LOTS of patience and even MORE love... If you are getting a puppy you absolutely HAVE to stay home and potty train and crate train and train them to behave and take them for walks to get used to their surroundings... i REALLY hope this helps you :)|`|Xtqs0Hxzaa	Calm-assertive  knows dog behavior extremely well  physically strong enough to handle a large dog  patient  outgoing  active|`|s2Voa2jMaa	love them is the key and no hitting|`|FR2bKa7iaa	Strong,patient,understanding,energetic and jovial.|`|HUAZ37araa	An assertive, natural-born leader with patience and lots of energy and time to train.

gwDftPBsaa	PH us at 6.0? 40ppm of nitrates is a bit on the high side. Try keeping your nitrate at around 20ppm. What is your tap water PH? Your tank water PH should be similar to your faucet PH if your using faucet water to do your water changes. If there is a diffrence in Ph between the two then that could shock your fishes. Is there things in your water thats causing your Ph to go so low?(driftwood, bogwood, additives?). Its recommended that you keep your PH stable and Faucet Ph and tank Ph similar(if you use the water from the faucet to do water changes with).|`|9759e8014743debd3d3fd1a7ad437c1faa	Your bala sharks and clown loaches will soon be too big for your tank. The frogs will eat your mollies and guppies. At that point things should get better, because your tank won't be so crowded.    6.0 is not a dangerously low pH for those fish, although 7.0 would be better. I'd say that 40 ppm nitrate is approaching toxic levels, though. The answer to all these water problems is to do larger and more frequent water changes.|`|6b557f2edd82e83be3708d2355146149aa	Most times the fish will just acclamate themselves to your water. The best advice is to use the water you have, it'll cause a lot less problems. Also, never add chemicals to your water to change the chemicals in your tank.    Best way to raise ph naturally is to change %25 of your water every couple of days and to vacuum the waste from the gravel. This waste lowers ph. As does wooden decor.    Good Luck! :)|`|2660ee2af90facf1fc82e16a9447ead1aa	First try and use ro water for your tank. Do not over feed a big problem with nitrate and phosphates is over feeding and do regular water changes.

v1KhTYcsaa	how long has the tank been set up?  could be a bacterial bloom    BUT with that many fish in that small of a tank the bioload is way to high.  i think it could be an ammonia and or bacterial problem. best of luck, and take some fish out asap@|`|w4DIPHf1aa	I won't call you a total idiot because i'm hoping a bigger tank is on the way for the pleco's sake as that will grow to about 14 inches.    The other fish need at least a 20 gallon tank.    research your fish before buying them because so far your a total disaster.    All those fish will probably be dead soon anyways because the bio-load they create versus tank size is suicidal.    The big water changes is what is causing the constant cloudyness of the bacteria bloom. But if you don't do constant large changes the fish will die.    don't do a water change for a day or 2 and it will clear up by itself.    get a bigger tank or get rid of the fish..|`|bDPVRtCNaa	The tank is overstocked. Please do not use the infamous "one inch of fish per gallon". The number of fish could very well explain your cloudy water. The five gallon tank is overwhelmed by their waste.    What type of pleco? Even smaller types would outgrow a five gallon aquarium.     I would say that the tank could hold a single dwarf gourami.|`|672a1d6963ce82f0b4946e0e58bceb5faa	there are a number of reasons for cloudy water.    Residue - If the water is cloudy immediately, or within an hour or two of filling the tank, it's probably due to insufficiently washed gravel. Prior to adding water to the tank, you should wash the gravel till the water runs clear over the pebbles.    if it isn't the gravel, it could be bacterial bloom.    Decaying plants or excess food that remains uneaten can also cause the milky water seen in bacterial bloom. Regardless of the cause, don't panic over bacterial blooms.     Keeping the aquarium very clean by removing debris such as decaying plants and uneaten food, vacuuming the gravel regularly, and performing partial water changes, will quickly resolve most cases of bacterial bloom. Cut back feeding to every second or third day, which will cut down on excess food decay.    you also want to test the nitrates and nitrites to make sure they're at a successful level.    you also have too many fish. so overcrowding and waste can be a major problem.    Please note... that while small now... Plecos will outgrow your tank quickly. My Pleco got to be a few inches shy of 3 feet by the time I donated him to a friend's 100gal tank.    keep your tank out of direct sunlight.|`|lxH9LDD3aa	Water can get cloudy after water changes and takes about a day to clear up. If you had a bigger tank you would not have to change water as often.|`|AraBfesHaa	I can tell you right off the bat.  It's the pleco causing the cloudiness.  I had the same thing, moved it to a 55- gal (was going to anyway, just not that quickly lol) and every thing was peachy again.  and he was in a 10-gal, not a 5.  Your tank is WAY TOO SMALL for a pleco.  Get him a bigger home or he's going to die.

MzHwklzKaa	First off, 6 weeks is too young to completely wean a puppy.    The puppy should START solid food now.  He should still have 1-2 meals from mama.    ALL OF THE PUPPIES need about 2 more weeks with their mother.  Please encourage your friends to keep the pups a while longer.    If not:  Give the puppy plain water, or a cup of water with a tablespoon of Karo syrup in it.  The sugar will give the pup calories and energy.    Skip Gatorade.  Karo Syrup is better.  Plain water works like a charm.    Do get puppy formula.   Just like human babies, puppies develop at different rates.  This little one just needs more time to nurse.    You might try Nutrical.  Some youngsters will take it.  It's a great source of calories and it's gentle nutrition for developing tummies.    Good luck!|`|tPGxPDvBaa	Either take to vet or surrender pup to spca.

When you do feed the puppy dogfood, mix in a few kibbles with a little milk and let it almost disintegrate so that the dog is kinda eating mush. You can help him grow his teeth later.    I wouldn't feed the doggie any gatorade; it's not even that good for humans. If you have a human who gets sick, feed him/her bananas, rice, applesauce, toast and ginger tea, otherwise known as the BRATT diet.|`|s2Voa2jMaa	THE VET MR.VET WILL CRUE THE THING THE PUP IS PROBLY SICK LIKE BAD AND SENCE THE PUP IS YOUNGER THAN 8 WEEKS TAKE HIM TO THE VET FAST|`|TTUdERZEaa	some dogs need to eat formula like you said of try wet puppy food that comes in a can.

Instead of Gatorade, buy Peadialite (I'm sure it's misspelled, but that's how it pronounced) which is formulated for infants and young children.  Can be bought in almost any store that carries baby supplies.    Make sure she stays warm. Heating pad with multiple layers of a couple towels folded up on top of the pad. Heated just enough to feel slight warmth through the towels and tuck her under the first one on top.

Someone left a nice note on my door one day, and we no longer let them out while we are gone. Problem fixed. If you are uneasy about speaking with them about it, just leave a friendly note.     Best of luck!|`|AA11466266	With few exceptions, all dogs bark. Barking is a natural behaviour and it is a way of communicating. While the messages can range from loneliness to hunger or playfulness, most often barking is used as an alarm or alert signal that indicates to the other pack members that a stranger or intruder is approaching    Most people have a feeling of security and comfort knowing their dogs are on the job. Some people even encourage their dogs to bark and growl when the doorbell rings or someone knocks. They feel this is acceptable behaviour, however, when the dogs become uncontrollable, with barking that is excessive, they become a nuisance. Life is miserable for neighbours who must listen day after day to barking dogs.   Excessive barking often begins in puppy-hood, when the pup who is not yet house-trained is unwisely shut behind closed doors. Improper confinement will definitely cause a barking problem, and dogs that are tied or tethered will eventually become frustrated and begin to bark to communicate their displeasure. We must always remember that dogs are pack animals. It is not natural or normal for them to be alone, however, millions of dogs must learn to cope confidently while members of the family go out daily to work.     Chewing, uncontrolled barking, house-training problems and destructive behaviour have put many dogs out of their homes, and all of this could be avoided if we simply communicated more effectively with our canine companions. They are part of a pack or family, similar in behaviour to their ancestors, the wolves. Wolves travel, hunt, sleep and eat in a group environment, therefore, we must modify this instinct. We must, in our human packs, make our dogs feel comfortable and secure about being alone in the den while the other pack members are away.     Because most barking takes place when you are away from home, you have no choice but to believe your neighbours when they complain.     Barking is actually quite common and not that difficult to rectify. Let us consider the encouraging owner who inadvertently praises and teaches his or her dog that its barking is the greatest thing, which makes the dog feel its owner is happy and pleased when he barks.     The easiest way to teach the dog to bark is command him to speak. So while the dog is barking at the door, the owner may use the command word speak. The dog will associate barking behaviour with this word. Now, your golden moment has arrived. You are going to teach your dog the word quiet, or enough or shush (your choice!). We do not teach the word No, because No means Never, ever do that - ever".     When you command your dog to be Quiet and he keeps barking, you will have to teach him the meaning of the word Quiet. Hitting your dog or using other physical measure or mechanical or electronic aids are unkind and unnecessary. You may hold your dogs muzzle closed (gently and kindly), or you may have to use a water pistol. Another method is to make a sudden sharp sound (rattle a pop can with some coins in it, or bang on a pot) to divert your dogs attention from barking. When your dog has ceased to bark for at least three to five seconds, praise him in a quiet, calm voice, perhaps saying, Good, quiet. Good!. Avoid stroking, patting and hugging your dog at this point, as you may over-excite him again, and he may miss the point of the whole exercise.     Before you leave your dog alone, remember the following points:     Provide adequate exercise.     Leave the radio or television on.     Provide your dog with proper chewing material - rawhide, nylabones and Kong toys stuffed with yummy stuff are good (beware of using real animal bones - they can splinter).     Crate train your dog.     Unplug your phone.     Place a Do Not Disturb sign on your door. This may prevent trades people from knocking or ringing the bell, which would set your dog off on a barking cycle.     Shut the shades or drapes so your dog cannot see outside.     Make your departures calm. Tone things down and be matter of fact. Over-emotional, guilt-ridden departures (and entrances) put your dog in a state of anxiety.|`|AA12218790	Ouch!  What a crappy position to be in.  I don't know that there is anything that you can do that won't piss them off.

It's probably because the owner doesn't give the dog enough attention and take it for walks to wear the dog out.|`|AA10123492	Ask them nicely.  They may think you just don't care.|`|AA11409466	Call your local police station or city hall and ask them what the laws are for noise pollution.  Call the police and tell them that this dog barks incessantly and they will talk to the neighbors without giving out your name.    Also (I've done this) try sending them an anonymous letter.  Make it really nice but stern.  I did that with neighbors that had 4 American Foxhounds (large hunting dogs).  They had them in small kennels and they would bay (not bark) constantly. Within 2 weeks, the dogs were gone.  I just said in the letter that is was unfair to keep those kinds of dogs in the city in such small kennels and that the noise was bothersome.    Good Luck.|`|fe8666c0431de5e1a8874e33382be6cfaa	I have the same problem. I would just ask my neighbors if they could please do something about it. That is what I did.|`|AA11706151	Dealing with bad neighbors is a nightmare - there's really no way to do it without pissing them off. You could try offering to split the cost of a no-bark collar with them. Personally, I'd move before I'd live next to a neighbor like that, but sometimes that's not an option. Sounds like you've taken the high road so far in a very frustrating situation. Some people advise poisoning the dogs, which is ridiculous - it's really not their fault. Killing a pet dog is a felony in most states, especially if it's on your neighbor's property. Bad neighbors are big on retaliation. If you kill his dog, who's to say he won't burn down your house? And his next dog might be worse. If you're intent on committing a crime, kill your neighbor instead. (Just kidding!)    Most areas have noise or nuisance laws - sometimes calling the cops can help, sometimes it can make it worse. If you report it anonymously, they won't take you very seriously. Animal control will only seize the dogs if they are abused (ie, no shelter, no water, no food, etc). Get witness statements from your other annoyed neighbors. If the cops won't help, I'd try calling your local TV station and see if they want to do a human interest story on lousy neighbors. Make a video tape and show them how annoying this is.  Show them as much documentation as you can, pictures and a log of how many times you have called the cops and gotten no help.     Hmmm... Make an audio tape of the dog barking, call your neighbor (from a pay phone!) and play the tape really loud at three in the morning?|`|AA11880696	just tell them the situation

In this book it goes through operant conditioning tricks where you would hang the same color towel, or anything else that is eye cathing to your dog and when its hung on the door, you will not open that door no matter what! Before you let your dog in, remove the towel. Then the first time he barks you open the door.   After a while the dog will realize that no matter how much he barks the door won't open with that towel on the door. So he will wait until the towel is removed, because he knows better.  Hope this helps.|`|9769e6c34ce12de7386c85294345d517aa	Simply reply in a firm deadtone NO! out your bedroom window as I have had to do, until he realizes it isn't accomplishing anything. We have deer wandering through every night and our dog is responding to his instincts by barking at them, but since we have to sleep, I broke him of it. He is only trying to please me and since I don't want him to do it, he probably thinks it isn't worth the effort anymore.  He is a Beagle/Walker mix, and I disagree with those people who answer that he should be brought inside. Not every dog is an inside dog or even wants to be inside with people. We live here on purpose, so that our animals have plenty of room in their own environment. No animals inside the house, but horses, chickens (free ranging), and dogs outside.  I'm having problems with a new puppy, only because I have rescued all my dogs over the past 24 years when they were adults, and I am out of practice, but learning. I don't like shock therapy. It takes a little more effort on my part, but I want the dog to learn that he needs to please me, and the rest of the family. He is a pack animal by nature, and he has his place in our pack.       I think you also mentioned that he barks when gay people are around. Well, I refer you once again to Barbara Woodhouse who wrote No Bad Dogs. She said many of the dogs had a "problem" according to their owners, when in all actuality it was the owner who was sending out a "vibe" to the dog. Now, before you get offended by this, think about it. She said dogs were brought to her who were "terrified of water" and she was able to get them to play in water within an hour. They were "terrified to get into a car" when she was able to get them to do it very shortly. We give our animals vibes about things by the way we react or our body language. He might be picking up on your subconcious messages. I know, they are your friends. But your dog is telling you something back, that you told him subconsciously.|`|1566a8a994bd9d08940ad25738a99330aa	My dog Coco barkes if she's outside involuntarily, mabey your dog is a house dog?|`|AA11853631	Take him inside.|`|448a77c740a481075c2a01ba2394e82faa	Get a shock collar for the dog.

Once a cat urinates in the carpet, obviously it soaks into the carpet padding and then into the floor.  We've always had to remove the carpet or throw out an item a cat has urinated on.  We have also had to sand down the spot on the floor underneath the carpet, seal it and revarnish it to keep the smell from coming back out.  If I were you, I'd rip up the carpet and replace with vinyl flooring.  Animals will keep going back to where their scent is to re-urinate and re-poop.  Have animals checked at vet, especially cat, for UTI or bladder infection.  Seriously, we've tried everything out on the market to remove the cat urine and nothing worked for us.  Dog urine isn't as hard to remove, but still stinks.  Some pro carpet cleaners have stuff to inject in carpet to alleviate the smell, but again, it did nothing for the cat urine smell.  Good luck!|`|5a1c8253181a8adf5c06c0040d8f981eaa	I used a product calles "Kids and Pets" it worked great on dog barf in my car, and urine on the carpeting in my house.  Now I keep, a bottle on hand.

Bring  a gallon of vinegar with about a half gallon of water to a full boil (together).  Dump on stain and absorb as much of the liquid up with towels as possible.  Then spray with vinegar (you can use a vinegar and water mixture but I have had better luck with straight vinegar) and let sit.  You may have to do this a couple of times.    If you don't like the smell of vinegar, you can also try urine gone.  I'm told that using a black light will help find pet stains.    I also found a product called Nature's Miracle at my local feed store.
