Such exercises as squats need a couple of days to recuperate between workouts, if you do them properly, so about twice a week is good.|`|SM6qHDKeaa	maybe once every other day, or once every three days, depending on your level of intensity. remember, muscles rebuild as you rest so you're going to need lots of it|`|ETurhACOaa	not everyday but more than once a week, dont lift any weight you cant lift atleat 5 times and do 3 to 5 reps 3 or 4 days a week|`|KbxPl1oYaa	If you go heavy, and use proper form... you won't be able to do them daily.  Try once a week... after a thorough warm up.

c4d3e30573f7765b16b9bbddef2168d6aa	first, someone stated bokkens are safe way to practice.  NO they are not safe, that was not why they were created.  bokkens were created because the samurais did not want to damage their swords in practice, so they got bokkens as replacements. (the added bonus was that there were no cuts from light accidental hits)  But bokkens have been known to kill and kill well.<br>  <br>  bokkens are not restricted by any rules so it could be any length, but usually people would like to order in the authentic sword's length.  Shinai however is restricted by rules and it's for a competitive purpose.  Because it's for a sport people would like every advantage that they could get thus they go for the longer shinai.|`|bb75c006e5dfff116ffb27872ce76d0aaa	Shinai are actually bought according to your height (like iaito in Iaido).<br>  We use the International Kendo Federation guidelines to issue your shinai for use.

Shinai are standardized in length and are used in Kendo.|`|6sTsDvKmaa	Malcolm D's got it right.  Bokuto are designed as wooden replica of the katana, so are similar in size.  They are used as a safe alternative to using a live blade.<br>  <br>  Shinai are designed for Kendo.  Due to the nature of the strikes (launching type strikes) used in the sport, it makes more sense to have a longer length weapon.  Also, a longer weapon has more flex in the "blade", which is probably safer for the person receiving the hit.  <br>  <br>  Though this is purely speculation, it may have something to do with it also being more aesthetically pleasing.  The bigger the weapon, the more dramatic it is to the viewer.  Kendo's big on making everything 'look good' as part of etiquette, so someone at some point may have decided that a longer weapon would look better flying through the air than a short one.|`|1fac5a761af3a94ccdce3f25d3999768aa	Hi there<br>  <br>  Some good answers so far and i would have to agree that the shinai was given a standard length because its a sport and the odds must be the same for each competitor. The boken can be any length. It depends on which type of sword it is trying to emulate. There are loads of different lengths of samurai swords of which the length may be ryu specific. But then i would also argue that bokken is a bokken and doesnt replicate a real sword anyway! A katana's length was also standardised at a certain period in japanese history for reasons i wont go into here.<br>  <br>  The common jo is my faveroute modern cock up. Its not the correct length either.<br>  <br>  And they say size matters! ;-)<br>  <br>  Best wishes<br>  <br>  idai|`|13360f8150c9715c66a1ecb9c2002c6aaa	but generally the shinai is longer and the shinai represents a battle feild weapon while the bokken represents a samurai personal sword suitable for a fast draw in non battle feild situations.|`|rNqF4gIVaa	Because the shinai was developed for the sport of Kendo and is not intended to be representative of real swords.

His ability to kick the ball 80+ metres is amazing. <br>  Back in 2005, when I began to watch AFL he was the one player that stood out to me, he went on to play in a premieership and be the clubs leading goalkicker twice in a row since then, and also winning the runner up of the eagles best and fairest.

xCoG2Qgyaa	The rule is a great idea, ONLY if a defender is allowed to knock the ball through while in a marking contest and isn't called for a attempt to do it on purpose. But i feel there are going to be to many matches where commentators, supporters are going to say this cost us the game by 1 or 2 points because this was called and this wasn't.|`|7Ek9YkUhaa	I agree with what woosha said on the rule after the eagles vs freo game.<br>  <br>  Eagle Scott Selwood was penalised by umpire Brett Rosebury for punching the ball over the line in a marking contest with a minute-and-a-half remaining.  The result was Ryan Crowley having a shot directly in front of goal. Fremantle then won the game 5 points.<br>  <br>  If that was paid a point then I think it's a good rule. But if that's a shot at goal then I disagree. I'm not supportive of the way it was paid, but I'm supportive of the rule. <br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.westcoasteagles.com.au/news/newsarticle/tabid/7155/newsid/72976/default.aspx" rel="nofollow">http://www.westcoasteagles.com.au/news/n...</a>|`|M2hrodq5aa	i dont mind it|`|xmg9CBnCaa	i don't like it. what hope does a defender have nowadays|`|NzJC7jQxaa	i think it's a great idea, since rushed behinds arent a part of the game - it's an easy way out for them, and it shuldnt be tolerated.<br>  eg: Joel Bowden... shall i say more?<br>  i am a supporter of Richmond, but i didnt like the way he handled that play.<br>  Fantastic rule, shuld be kept!|`|Qi2vE8wwaa	I like that rule. That decision someone else mentioned was wrong in every other pre season game this year it would have been called a point.Deliberate rushed behinds are Dirty tactics just like flooding.|`|2s244jGgaa	When the umpires are at the incorrect angle/view of the marking contest or play, and they judge it incorrectly, the rule will be a failure. The umpires need to assess the fact that they need to realise that <br>  - The player may be under pressure<br>  - The player may not be focused enough to realise how close to goal they are, all they want to do is get the ball away from the opponent, regardless of what way it travels<br>  - The ball may not go where the player intends it to go<br>  <br>  These factors are what make umpiring this rule so hard.<br>  <br>  If the rushed behind is obvious, then a free kick is a good rule. <br>  People may tend to disagree with me, but i prefer the 3 point rule. Just adds less confusion and avoids bad decisions like in the fremantle v eagles game, where the eagles lost because of this decision. And even if the eagles had won and the decision was against fremantle, i would have the same views. It would have been an unfair win.|`|4wRyTY9Raa	It doesn't bother me either way to be honest, as you say the interpretation would be the key, so far i've seen blokes punching the ball through the goals/behinds deliberately but no penalty, what's the point of having th rule if it isn't enforced, it makes no difference if a player walks it over the line or punches it through, both are designed to give a point away so they can keep possession.
yWwQoahGaa	If i were a Galaxy fan i would feel let down by beckham. But i would also realise what a great things he has done for the club and the MLS. <br>  <br>  Beckhams is THE most famous footballer in the world, most possibly EVER! And i think hes done the right thing moving to AC Milan, and paying for some of it himself. He moved so he can play for England in next years world cup, and i think thats fantastic.<br>  <br>  Dont feel embarrassed to wear your Galaxy Jersey, he's back there soon for a while. And anyway...it could be worse, i once had a jersey and the players name was spelt wrong, thats surley more embarrassing? haha|`|Q11YuqKkaa	I really didn't know much about MLS until Beckham came aboard, it was the first time I've heard about Galaxy. So there was publicity for sure. And remember, one great player doesn't make a great team, especially in soccer. Take Man City for Example. It is a team sport. <br>  <br>  Also, promoting a sport takes time. <br>  <br>  USA loves AFL, Basketball and Baseball. It was a huge task to promote the sport when most of the population are already so involved in other sports. But the sport is growing, and it does take time.<br>  <br>  He is just on a loan to Milan and doing quite well.He has to keep up that high intensity football for the selectors, because he would really like to go to the World Cup next year.<br>  <br>  And even though America plays good football, their leagues aren't as competitive as the ones in Europe.<br>  <br>  I wouldn't be ashamed to wear a Jersey with his name on, He has only played for top teams over the years:<br>  <br>  Man United ( One of the best teams in England, top at the moment)<br>  Real Madrid ( One of the best in Spain )<br>  AC Milan ( One of the best in Italy )<br>  <br>  So to have him on your team already says a lot. <br>  <br>  I felt the same as you when Becks left Man U, but it is a Professional era, and he has his own life to consider as well. I don't think he will leave LA Galaxy. But whatever happens, I think one should wish him well, and savour the great times! He remains a great player!|`|FriWfohwaa	i dont see it like that but in a way i feel betrayed but not that reason hes still a mad talented player for milan he still gets the job done|`|c6d39e78cfedb00968db18e9aaafac51aa	Its hard to feel betrayed when Beckham is not doing it for the money. We can compete at a high level and wants to take advantage of it. <br>  <br>  The USA youth soccer system needs to do something about the fact that soccer is the most played sport for kids from the ages of 3-13, then participation drops significantly. If we had all our best players in soccer instead of football and basketball; the MLS would demand more respect and players would want to play here in their prime and not just looking for one last paycheck.

18oY8vt6aa	Anytime that your job is in the spotlight of the public (Rugby, Soccer, Acting, Models etc), then you undoubtingly accept you profession and the ground it covers.  How can you say that they are not role models, I think "manly 4 life" has been boozing a bit to much with Stewart and co because you've lost your knockers.  When they do all of these PR stints and adverts (you know which they get paid for), then why do you think the public would not look up to them?.  You say they play for the love of the game, well I say they should think of that when they are consuming alcohol and making a mockery of the sport who pays them.  FYI they were attending a League Function when this all occured so they were by all means doing there jobs, can you get away with this behaviour at your job?<br>  <br>  Wrong is wrong and until people compute that through to your brains then people will always make excuses for mongrels like this.  You either say it's acceptable or not and there aint no half ways about it.  He's a man as already pointed out he should be treated like one.|`|uKoAMJQvaa	I think it is very sad that we expect young boys many under 20 to be role models. Parents should be the role models as well as other family members. school teachers etc. the media puts these players there.<br>  If a kid goes wrong parent s should be looking at themselves not a footy player to blame.<br>  People in every other line of work(yes and this is work for them) have people who abuse alcohol, people etc. we never hear about that.<br>  Everyone is free to make their own decisions. I see the problem is their is no consistency with the punishment if they abuse the alcohol and the resultant problems that occur.|`|CZvrFqZ1aa	Take a chill pill mate.<br>  The players really cant be ''banned'' from drinking, whatever they do in their free time is their problem and they should know the consequences.<br>  <br>  The role model part is false. They do not want to be role models. They are only doing their job. They play for the love of the game. And if you're a kid or a teen who looks up to someone, you should look up to them for their abilities and skills on the field only, and not what problems happen off the field. <br>  At least, that's what I think.|`|Uyz6iZwKaa	Because it would be too much of a restriction on players. Why punish players that can have a social drink and be responsible. It would be too resticting on players and too hard to control. That is why only certain players (like Todd Carney of Canberra) have bans on alcohol consumption because they abuse it - and when they do they are sacked! They are men not babies.|`|PrKLoajAaa	men are men darl, big bucks for a short career span, these guys are a individual and they are in titled to their privacy and treating women badly most but not all deserve it... I think what happens on the Field stays on the field|`|8AE5AForaa	Over the past several years, a quite high number of these alcohol related incidents with NRL players have been as a result of drinking at club sponsored events. Perhaps the clubs should look more closely at what they allow or encourage their players to get up to at club sponsored events. This is a prime example of someone with a previously squeaky clean record going to a club event, and due to peer pressure ended up drinking way more than they would normally, and then doing something they may end up regretting for the rest of their lives.|`|nR8c8xK4aa	agreed!!!! they may claim that they don't want to be role models but like it or not these men once accepting the pay and status that comes along with their profession become role models. <br>  <br>  They need to realise that they are not just one of the boys from their local club who can act like a clown and get away with it. They are commodities that belong to large organisations that are traded and re-traded and should be made aware of this. <br>  <br>  Rugby league has had a culture of thuggery both on and off the field for a while now which makes me sad as an ex-player to say that my kids will not be involved in rugby league and i will probably involve them in rugby union or AFL|`|IgaEN2Cuaa	They're are plenty of others out there who drink alcohol and treat women badly. They're are also a lot of women who drink and abuse the men. Whatever the case, players are often the victims of false allegations and, until proven, that's all it is...an allegation.|`|peeEqGTzaa	The prob is the Team management encourage it - its almost like they love the media coverage!<br>  <br>  Why is it in most oter elite sports the athlete will refrain from drinking as it affects their performance? Why are football players exempt?<br>  <br>  Are they so fit they can eat junk and drink up booze weekly and still perform???  Look at Riddell and Widders. Slack = FAT EMBARASSMENT|`|f9hiPMDxaa	The problem lies with the clubs, the NRL as well as the players. How often have you seen a big name league player actually dropped (excluding Bird, who has still not been charged with anything). That dustup at Charles Sturt Uni when the players went around breaking into students bedrooms. Who got shafted. An unknown 20 year old prop. <br>  <br>  Had the Stewart incident happened with an unknown 21 year old, he would have been stood down on the spot.

1a17e73a07a2c5ebb65e5750cb7c97faaa	Several of those events are real close to me.  Hayward is only 25 miles away and they just had a snocross race there this last weekend.  They are fun to watch, especially if you are sitting by one of the landings off of a jump.  After awhile a hole starts to form where the majority of sleds are landing.  So, instead of landing softly they start slamming into the hole and some of them get thrown over the top of their snow machines.  Very fun and different to watch. it's neat to see the different lines that guys take.<br>  4's FINE N 09!!!!|`|Q2sZhNmJaa	I have enjoyed watching it.  I watched the winter x games and they had it on and it was fun.  Amazing too.  I watched last night “Greatest Crashes’ and they had a guy riding a snowmobile who went off a ramp.  He over shot the ramp and crashed and that was sure something to see. I saw too, I can’t remember but they were doing snow mobileing on a rubber snow track once for something.  That was pretty exciting too.  They soup up the snow mobiles, just like they do a bike.<br>  <br>  When I go out to CO usually every other year to ski, we spend a day renting snowmobiles. It is fun but no jumping allowed on them.|`|u4liwDhAaa	Yes and boy is it fun! <br>  <br>  We use to have 2 snowmobiles.  You haven't lived until you've run your snowmobile up a tree!  That is my extreme sport!  LOL (That's probably why Tony Stewart would never let me drive his race car!  LOL)|`|7B3TwoaSaa	I think they have this sort of thing during the Winter X-games. Its pretty cool to watch|`|ndX4Je5Oaa	its great, but not greater than nascar|`|8ivnzNi5aa	I used to ride like that, until I figured out how to use the brakes on my snowmobile.|`|U3ZBUOWaaa	Yep, they held one of these races in Farmington this year. I got to see the first few races and then headed home on Saturday night to watch the Daytona 500 on Sunday.    Its a lot of fun...very exciting...and its amazing what these guys (and gals) can do with these machines.  If you ever get a chance to attend one...go for it.

1a17e73a07a2c5ebb65e5750cb7c97faaa	They have pictures of me fishing off of a dock when I was 2 and I have done it for as long as I can remember.  My grandparents had a cabin in northern Minnesota while I was growing up and we went there for several weeks every year.  Some of my happiest memories are of fishing and summers up there.|`|crS1HZ9vaa	I was in the 9th grade when the teacher asked the students to bring something for show & tell and I was so impressed with a friends tackle box that I begged my grandmother to buy me a rod & reel but coming from a poor family they couldd not afford it so at that time stores had the "green stamps" where you would collect stamps from a store where you would buy groceries the stamps were then glued to a booklet and every booklet counted for so many points. welll lo and behold that magazine where you could turn in the stamps for prizes had a Zebco combo kit I completed the amount of books to be turned in and ordered my rod and reel my grandfather took me to the river not knowing nothing about rods or reels I just used what it came with some spinners,bobbers etc... well I tied a small spinner and about the third cast I caught a 2lb catfish and landed him too. And that is how I got hooked|`|KH3kbRjgaa	My ex-husband got me interested. We were stream fishing and I caught the only "Brown". What a boon - it tasted good too. Have loved trout ever since. ?<br>  <a href="http://www.dnr.state.md.us/fisheries/art2005/0218album/0205browntrout.jpg" rel="nofollow">http://www.dnr.state.md.us/fisheries/art...</a>|`|dqxW1W0eaa	Stringer has the right answer !|`|95SpYY2yaa	I got hooked on fishing when I was 5 years old. My dad took me to a little pond and I had this tiny little ultra light rod and reel and I caught my first bass and a good sized bluegill. That was the start right there. Ever since that experience I have been begging to go fishing but now that I am older I can just ride my bike down the rode and use my little boat and whala I'm catching the big ones!|`|KJWxqQHiaa	ONe day our class took a field trip to a local lake, to fish. I had never fished, never cast a rod/reel, and never baited a hook. My dad fished a long time ago before this, when i was just a baby. When i went there to fish i had no idea what i were doing. I MAY have knew what a bobber was but, i am unsure. We was fishin w/ bobbers & worms. I didn't catch a fish but, i seen other people catch 'gills and you should have seen the smiles on their faces. Right when i went home i told my dad that i wanted to go fishing, quickly. The next day we cleaned up his OLD reels/rods. I didn't have any equipment but what were already on the line. Half rusted hooks, and old split-shot sinkers. I caught 2 small bass back to back at the local creek and from then on me & him were hooked. (Him being hooked again.) Greatest moment of my life.<br>  <br>  Hope i helped ya out.|`|uic7O5bFaa	fishing is really relaxing, even though you dont catch any fish!<br>  and when you actually DO catch a fish, you want to catch another one! =D|`|CVTXc09jaa	-Quiet environment, clear water, cheap sport<br>  -No work, no wife, no children<br>  <br>  And the feeling to catch a big one is truly the reason that will hook you up!|`|155d0ecdf11afeeeadf9b3048aac99f9aa	I have fishing so long i have no idea on it.

48846255239e6cfd4e8b805cbae9c844aa	It depends on what you are fishing for, I fish for Crappie and Bluegill, early morning and evening is good, for catfish, I fish on the bottom at night.|`|Ks6Ac9SSaa	I fish whenever I can get someone to go with me and we never catch any fish until dusk when we are ready to go home.|`|dqxW1W0eaa	I fish more in the daytime really,but I do like to fish at night .If I am already at the lake when it turns dark the fish seem to start biting a bit better as it turns darker,I should be down there tonight with this beautiful full moon and all.I catch about the same amount of fish really,maybe a few bigger ones at night.It is a lot of fun to make a fire and fish from the bank,also fun to just paddle out there a bit in the boat too !,also fun to take a  dip into the cool spring fed lake........hardly ever see a gator in this lake........once in a great while|`|eWEqGHvJaa	It will depend upon the spot and what kind of fish you want to catch.  Usually the early morning and evening are the best becausee there is more insects out and it is not hot.  Mid day is the worst time to fish.  Night fishing is fun if you are going after the big ones that come up from the bottom to feed.  Good luck and may your net be full.|`|1a17e73a07a2c5ebb65e5750cb7c97faaa	It depends on what I'm fishing for and what time of the year it is.  I mostly ice fish for walleye at night.  I mostly fish for panfish during the day but I like to trout fish early in the morning and late afternoon and into the evening.|`|7royFhIgaa	I  mainly fish early in the day and have the best luck.|`|SEpHGcnKaa	I fish from dawn to the time when boats are supposed to be the water, usually about a 1/2 hour before sunset.<br>  <br>  I usually catch fish all day, but mornings and evenings are best.|`|bUDOZFDAaa	it depends where you go, i have a spot where i catch a ton at night and very few during the day. but most will say early morning or evening. this is becouse of insect activity. mid day is the worst time|`|mqJnctPeaa	i catch more fish in the day
KFagjt8Jaa	I cant wait its should be brill with Eddie Jordan David Coulthard and not forgetting Martin Brundle doing the pit walks <br>  check out the new bbc f1 web site its starting to look good<br>  <br>  <br>  <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/motorsport/formula_one/default.stm" rel="nofollow">http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/motorspo...</a>|`|DY8YYluqaa	Oh hell yeah. They apparently have Friday practice on red button. Also on red button during the race you can change camera's. No ad breaks. A Brilliant team, with the return of MURRAY WALKER doing a small part of the Sunday race show.|`|d720cd234b26aec0b10b06cc2d725085aa	I only thing for certain that I'm looking forward to is that there will be no advertising.<br>  The Beebs coverage last time around was good. But I think they main not be as good as everyone is probably hoping.<br>  I hope that they replicate the through appraoch they have taken with the wesite and not the basic approach they have choesn with their mobile coverage.<br>   I agree with Dan about Irvine. I will certainly miss him, he fitted F1 like a glove.|`|bqpdjkRoaa	I am looking forward to not having add breaks, there was nothing wrong with the ITV coverage though, I thought that they did a great job, I am really pleased that Martin Brundle is included but I really cant understand why they have brought back that silly old man Murry Walker, I was really glad when he retired and I wish that he had stayed retired.|`|d1b38b13b953ba1dbaf4d9bcd50f9de4aa	Now that I have BBC again after a break of several years (it just became available on cable here) I will have a look at what they are doing. It'll have to be very, very good to make me turn over from RTL permanently though. I may just put the BBC on for "The Chain" to get me in the mood at the start before going back to the German coverage...|`|wBzv5awkaa	Hi hon, yeah I sure am, no adverts woop woop. i've had a look at the website too and it doesn't seem to bad. not as slick as itv but hopefully that will come|`|f1Hhl3Beaa	I'm looking forward to it, as the Beeb have in recent years led in the way in making use of interactive features, and look to be doing so now with split-screen coverage and other features. They've also tried to retain the best parts of ITV's coverage but updating it with their own people... Brundle was essential, as was having a pit lane reporter (Kravitz has done well to give as much info as possible at each race), and although I haven't heard Jonathan Legard's commentary on 5 Live, he is held in very high regard. Having Murray involved in some form shows that they recognise what the fans like, and it was wise not to coax him into commentating again... This new role is much better for someone of his age.<br>  <br>  I think Jake Humphrey who is taking the brilliant Steve Ryder's role (poor Steve, he moved to ITV mainly for the F1 only for it to go to the Beeb) has done well as a sports presenter after moving from kid's tv. From his blogs on the bbc website I can see that he's very excited about this job and that's good to hear. All in all I think it will take a lot to improve on ITV, but the Beeb are in the best position to do so.<br>  <br>  PS. I can't wait to hear The Chain on the first show. I grew up with that music and it always gives me tingles!|`|pLoCn8dWaa	Definitely!<br>  At last, a reason to pay the license fee.<br>  No ads will be great, but i can see a problem in choosing the right time to fetch snacks :S<br>  I am always impressed by their other sports programs. High budget, that's the key.|`|KTxxd700aa	The beeb will be far better than itv, it always is on football and the Moto gp bike coverage is pretty good. If it is as good as it was in 1995 It'll do for me!|`|3rpMN1nXaa	Sure, It should be a great coverage, no ads almost completely undisturbed viewing  so it should be great, I can't wait to see it myself.|`|FPJSoxYwaa	Yes.  I'll still be watching the live broadcast through Star Sports but i'll be downloading the BBC one later since we don't have that channel here.|`|1evqSw67aa	yes, have missed the beebs coverage, in fact the bbc is far better for all sports|`|UYERqaRQaa	god bless the BBC and their no adverts coverage|`|NgZlz5K7aa	No ads, no Mr Allen BRING IT ON|`|2dc7b2e89b81ba616f21eb2b9e6a2d78aa	ITV did a fantastic job. From day 1 their coverage was light years ahead of the old BBC coverage. ITV was exciting, fresh, innovative, dynamic, and also very knowledgeable and informative. The fact that the BBC are bringing back 'The Chain' as the theme tune tells me everything I need to know. Their coverage will be old fashioned, and stuck in the past - like most BBC sports coverage. Checkout their F1 website - bland in presentation and very weak in content. It uploads new content days after it appears on the ITV and PlanetF1 websites. They are just nicking the content and then they are not even doing it quickly! Pathetic!<br>  <br>  I despair of all the boring old farts on here and other F1 websites who just keep harping on about how the BBC "must bring back Fleetwood Mac's song 'The Chain' " and resurrect Murray Walker! For criminys sake don't these people ever move on from the 1980s/90s?! I'm sure they still watch the races decked out in their Williams Rothmans 'official merchandise' t-shirts! Saddos! <br>  <br>  The only reasonably positive thing about the BBC is the lack of adverts, but I never had a problem with the ads - you've gotta have a pee break and tea break in a 2 hour race anyway!|`|INZb6pApaa	I hope it will be an improvement on ITV, but remember that when it switched to ITV in the first place their coverage was light years ahead of what the BBC had been producing up until then. <br>  <br>  Never mind no more ad breaks, there's NO MORE JAMES ALLEN!|`|jAQsHjZQaa	I think it will be brilliant!!! The best thing about it is that there won't be any ad breaks anymore so that's always a good start. Also BBC are well known for giving some of the best Sport Coverage in the world.|`|yjVSqG3baa	I am much happier with it going back to the bbc! No more adverts when something good may be happening!|`|bU6PFSq3aa	Yeah i am 4 sure,no more annoying add breaks 6 laps from the end;-)

4l0yGuE9aa	2 things<br>  <br>  1) The restrictor plates caused the cars to race in groups bunched up <br>  <br>  and <br>  <br>  2) The design of the cars made the rear of the cars loose and the rear spoiler was not enough to keep the back of the car down when other cars were near the rear of the car. <br>  <br>  As cars pull up to the rear of another car the way air flows over the cars makes the wind lift the air off of the rear of the car which caused Dale Sr to start swerving and wreck. Nobody tried to kill Dale Sr. Sterlin Marlin or Rusty Wallace was not at fault. The new rear wing "helps" prevent that kind of accident from happening again.|`|b9uOax0aaa	He did.  He was blocking for JR. and tried to cut off Sterling but did not clear him.  Many things contributed to the accident but if Sr had not been blocking the whole thing probably would have been avoided.|`|XNdDrXAzaa	that's part of any type of motorsport<br>  the cause: "severe competition"|`|OnXX13yCaa	if sr had been racing straight up instead of trying to block for his 2 cars that he owned the accident probably never would have happened. i feel that it was a poor choice on his part. if the shoe had been on the other foot sr would have found a way to boot the blocker out of the way.|`|EHtFxGxMaa	The key word here is.....<br>  <br>  Are you ready.....<br>  <br>  Wait for it.........................................<br>  <br>  It was................................<br>  <br>  An.......................................<br>  <br>  Accident.|`|5d77c66b171b12a5932576b2dc7b7dd3aa	Restrictor plate racing.....................IT SUX!|`|OAh9TDlDaa	How was Sterling being a idiot??

No one ever imagined a driver would die with that hit back then. That is why they developed the hans device. It keeps the drivers heads still to keep it from banging around and getting a broken neck like SR did.  You never know what happened in that car that day, so we may never know.|`|c16PCaCmaa	Just a product of restricter plate racing.  A bunch of cars wadded up real tight, going 190 MPH, and the drivers being aggressive going for the win at the biggest race of the year.  Although it has been rumored that he wasn't wearing his seat belt right.  Can't confirm that though.|`|TYc6nAUsaa	Earnhardt and Sterling Marlin got together and the 3 car his the wall|`|QhD4zYbuaa	blocking,and i think sterling hit him,i also heard belts were not fastened properly|`|ec96a7005525b280dafea257208badeeaa	hard racing caused that crash!|`|JfGVUh9aaa	I say he was trying to block......|`|aBVOHkRTaa	one word: G R E E D !|`|1IWEKwznaa	Many cars, little room.<br>  <br>  What's with the thumbs down trolls?|`|hB85TJAPaa	Dale Earnhardt Sr.died the way that he wanted to. The accident happened because of the way he was blocking the field so that his team could finish 1-2 for the 500. When the cars went into turn 3 Sr. was stuck in the middle groove with Kenny S. up high,Sterling M.down low and Rusty W. came up behind Sr. and then the wind was taken off of his car and Sr. got out of shape just enough that Marlin tapped him and he crashed into Kenny and into the wall. In racing terms it is call a racing accident in which it means that no one is at fault and everyone did everything that they could have done to avoid it. An Act Of GOD!|`|9vcZjFl6aa	calling sterling marlin a idiot is asinine he felt as bad as n e 1 on that day it was a racing accident. it was the way dale sr. raced HARD
vP6ymargaa	Found the Heli Pro was a little shy on capacity when it came to school books. Definitely comfortable though.<br>   I guess it depends how much homework and studying you do!|`|VBSURuKtaa	Yeah, go ahead and use it. I use my Heli Pro 20l everyday for school, and it has not shown any type of wear. I usually carry quite a bit of weight, so I think you will be fine. <br>  With the waist strap, I just let it hang behind me.

kJ4g1vujaa	I doubt it - because  Ryan although has passed Bobby on "caps", Ryan Giggs would have been a substitute and would have been substituted in many of those games.  Of course that figure might be slightly offset by extra time played.|`|dT3xJ9GWaa	yes|`|KOM1Bki8aa	probably not, i tried to look for a link, but in SIR BOBBYS day subs were rarely used if at all, some of ryans appearances have been 1 or 2 minutes.|`|hLjz63N5aa	yes ryan giggs broke booby Charlton's record earlier this season|`|zyzVSQfgaa	possibly but bobby still plays watched him heading ball during game last week|`|dUwl7Gn0aa	I would say so, seems like ryan giggs has been there for decades
lPDHMOVZaa	You bet... just like he has done well everywhere he has played. Despite all the criticism against him and being a so-called "cancer" in the locker room, Owens has not only put up individual numbers, but he has made the offenses that he has played on better as a whole. <br>  <br>  Owens will be just fine in Buffalo and because of his presence, Lee Evans, MarShawn Lynch and Trent Edwards, will have the best years of their careers.|`|5gKGtSriaa	Yes. Since they don't have a runningback, they'll diffinetly throw to him more often. But Edwards and Marshall (they have those 2 right) will still be used. Since he'll be a their good WR, he'll get more catches. Now if he makes those catches for yards is another story. <br>  <br>  It's up to him if he wants to be good or not. He'll just get many recptions most likely.|`|ib5nNdsWaa	It may not be a step up but perhaps the dynamics of the Bills team will work out better for him. I wish him well and look forward to not hearing his name mentioned in regards to the Cowboys.|`|WaaFCtuOaa	I say he puts up good numbers as always & sooner or later, he will run his mouth & be a distraction yet to another team|`|G1r4Go1Taa	He will lead the Bills to the playoffs. All they needed was a key wide receiver, but it depends if he stays out of trouble.|`|vJ20fTZWaa	yes he will but I think only because it's a contract year for him|`|DZPCCIgEaa	He will create a bunch a drama. That is what he is good for. NO ONE should have signed him. Bad call on Buffalo's part!|`|ProDw5xAaa	He will be fine.|`|pUtkSPLbaa	I think he will the Bills have a good-great QB (depending on the day) a good rb, an ok TE and an ok WR now that they have T.O. they have a phenomenal receiver he should do pretty well|`|AA11105507	In his first years with SF, Philly, and Dallas, he did very well.  After that though, his on-field antics and locker room attitude problem started to affect the teams he played for.  I think Buffalo did a great job in signing him to a 1 year contract with NO guaranteed money.  He'll make a significant difference in the Bills offense, and maybe even help them win the AFC East next season.  After that though, the Bills would be smart to let him go.|`|hfEGHKePaa	59 catches, 813 yards, 6 TDs.|`|sPiwb8Hraa	I predict that he will try, because of the behavior clause that I heard they put in his contract. Also at his age and experience, he should be working to improve his image. But he may not. He may not have learned. If that is the case, that is the end of his career.|`|yg3Pveakaa	I think the bills doing good this year will defend on marshawn lynch's game, if in fact he can be back this year..They have a great running game with him and with TO in the wins the holes can be bigger for him..|`|UgnMjtYDaa	It doesn't matter..... the team is better with him than without. They will win some extra games because of him. As a dolphin fan I have to worry about him now. Big time receivers always play well against miami.|`|a4f17786434be41d57b2e22017646256aa	No.

I mean last week I heard McDonald going on about how we wont lose the the top spot again, yet 3 fvckin days later we lose to fvckin St. Mirren in the cup. Players need to shut their mouths and just show why we pay them thousands of pounds each week instead of garbing on about stuff they cant possibly know or predict. And as for ex Old Firm they really need to shut the hell up tired of listening to their cack also.
OdMZtz7Zaa	Bill P is right. Aus were loosing there spot . But i think they r bouncing back. i was thinking Aus will take time to revive themselves.

They worked as Unit .|`|JC9wAaOsaa	When Australia went into the series we were the underdogs, we didnt have a full strike attack with our bowlers and our batters are relative new...

Yes they are in the rankings but that is over a long period of time. South Africa came to Australia and won so I think that makes it equal between the two.<br>  <br>  Also Australia were destroyed in India and I think quite possibly both India and South Africa are better than Australia right now.

Perhaps its because we have just demolished the pretenders to the throne? <br>  <br>  South Africa have just shown that they really after all are the biggest chokers in world cricket. The Aussie pace attack is not looking as ordinary as many were suggesting it was a couple of months back. We have a gem in Phil Hughes, Marcus North is going to be a very handy player, Haddin is batting and keeping well.

im8xN545aa	I suppose, looking at remote possibilities, England could bat as if they were playing a one day game, get some kind of total on the board and then put the Windies into bat and try and bowl them out again to try and force a result. Though they could be in danger of trying too hard as Strauss and Shah are already out. So maybe there's a small danger that the Windies could bowl England out cheaply and then overhaul whatever total England make and win.<br>  <br>  But I'm sure that is too much of a remote possibility and it'll end up as a boring old draw.|`|wPlfPc0gaa	Nothing special is going to happen on the runway of Port-of-Spain. Another dull draw is on the cards. <br>  A miracle? Say, England declaring the innings after getting a lead of 150 by lunch, and bowling out West Indies  in the last over of the test match. That would be a spectacular finish. But that is unlikely to happen.<br>  <br>  The difference between the two teams is that one innings where England were bowled out for 51. Once WI went 1-0 up, their intentions were to win the series 1-0.<br>  With the Ashes around the corner, the Batting looks promising for England. Needs to be seen how they will fare against the likes of Johnson. Bowling looked better in the first innings of this test match, even though the outcome was anything but desirable.|`|gfxXikenaa	England losing a test series to West Indies, the worst result that Strauss could ever expect in his first series as captain.<br>  <br>  1-0 is the only possibility now.<br>  <br>  though if each match is analysed you would find that England could have won the series but they didn't grab the chances which they got at various stages.<br>  <br>  Conclusion=<br>  A boring but still a series full of twists. lol<br>  <br>  @the user below: well 4th day is about to end and still each team has only played their 1st innings.<br>  hopeless situlation on such a flat track!|`|8T0Z0Y17aa	There's all this talk of England scoring quickly and then employing a risky 'Sobers declaration', as refered to on TMS.<br>  <br>  That Sobers declaration being refered to, was in this game: <a href="http://uk.cricinfo.com/db/ARCHIVE/1960S/1967-68/ENG_IN_WI/ENG_WI_T4_14-19MAR1968.html" rel="nofollow">http://uk.cricinfo.com/db/ARCHIVE/1960S/...</a><br>  <br>  Sobers declared mid-afternoon on day 5, setting England 215. They knocked them off for three in 52 overs. Even Boycott made some quick runs!|`|uuHrf7cGaa	We have seen remote possibilities now and then. Yes any team even though the first innings has yet to be completed - can only hope for a draw at the end of 4th day's play. Even though I am not watching this game right now, from the commentary I see the ball is doing a little bit of trickery - reverse swinging. With Gayle injured and if England can score at a brisk rate 6+ rpo ( before that they still need to take 2 more wkts) for about 30 overs and they have a good 60 overs to deal with WI. In order to take those 10 wkts England bowlers need to elevate and so is fielding.<br>  If neither can be accomplished - go ahead and fix the match and pay WICB a hefty sum of $1 million or more and win the game to tie the series. I am sorry to state this - but unfortunately many games are still being done this way. Bottom line is $$$$.|`|Qr9UFnIuaa	Y not? As a real fan of cricket, I can say that v can't predict the result so early because still more than 4 sessions left and scores are almost leveled. Who might have guessed that England will be bowled out for a cheap score of 51 in the 2nd innings of 1st test. Y can't we expect that to happen again or an West Indian collapse. Having said that as every day is not a Sunday, but at the current situation of match and pitch, match is heading towards draw. Lets expect some thrilling finish on the final day.|`|SzBlX4Vpaa	I answer this as England are 5 for no loss - a solid start through to stumps, then put the footdown, leave 220 off 70 overs tomorrow and there is a great chance of a result.<br>  <br>  The key is England being prepared to risk losing the match in order to try and win it.....|`|RdWTvI2raa	Buy a large inflatable sumo wrestler suit.<br>  <br>  Take a plane to Port-of-Spain.<br>  <br>  Get a ticket for the match.<br>  <br>  Consume large quantities of alcohol.<br>  <br>  Use your drunken imagination to make something interesting happen.|`|i8QoeiNyaa	No.<br>  You can't associate the word interesting with this series.

5bf66864f5e85f953cdb3ff01887ae4daa	YES! I have to, when your fly fishing its not only for protection against the sun but from the artificial fly which can get lodged in the back of your head if there is a slight breeze.<br>  <br>  I do wear sunscreen as the UV rays will reflect from the water and can cause you to burn if you stay out fishing all day. they can damage fly lines SO its important NOT to get the sunscreen on the fly line!|`|cpLYxlhBaa	well if your a serious fishermen then most likely u are goin to wear a hat of some sort.. manly because it keeps the sun out of your eyes allowing a little more visablity and also like they said it will protect u from being burnt...<br>  <br>  also i have had the rare occasion when i hook a limb and snatch it off and the lure comes zooming at your face at 20 mph lol if this ever happens just look down and let the cap block the lure|`|91nAPOLtaa	uhh well, i wear a baseball cap all the time. when fishing is no different. its just something i wear. if i didnt wear one and i went fishing i probably wouldnt wear one then either unless i was afraid of getting sunburned. and then id probably wear sunscreen too if I had any. I wouldnt wear one just because im fishing so i need a fishing hat, thats kinda silly to me.|`|crS1HZ9vaa	yes,I wear a fishing cap along with sunscreen rated 75 along with polarized glasses. I must tell you I wish I had worn my sunblock along with a cap or hat some 20 years back. A day don't go by that i see myself in the mirror and regret all the sunspots that I now have thanks to Mr.SUN.  caps and hats when worn with polarized glasses also help you see into the water and help you see fish better than without these two items combined.|`|1a17e73a07a2c5ebb65e5750cb7c97faaa	I always wear a hat when I'm fishing.  Sometimes it is for keeping the sun out of my eyes, bugs out of my hair or rain off my head.  I wear a stocking hat most of the time when I'm ice fishing.|`|SEpHGcnKaa	Yes, and yes. And bug spray too.|`|ec2Lhkbwaa	yer course i do and shades|`|Ks6Ac9SSaa	I wear one when the sun is shining in my face to keep the sun out of my eyes so I can see the bobber.|`|qB4KvbDiaa	no don"t like to wear a hat,i put my hair up .and wear sunglasses|`|dqxW1W0eaa	I have a special Florida Gators football hat I wear sometimes for good luck,and shades.A hat makes my head hot though,and I have to take it off usually before long .My Dad used to say some of them fish ain't Florida Gators fans and they could see my hat and ain't gonna bite.|`|RxTIzsyhaa	Got two that myself and fishin' gear don't leave home without ~<br>  Summer = Straw Resistol (shade) and winter = Beaver/felt Stetson (warmth) ;)... <br>  < ' ( (( > <<br>  <br>  Note: Nope, no Sunscreen...<br>  <br>  Added: Basically I wear them all the time ie., I'm n' old cowpoke;)...|`|lvJUDy78aa	How have you been going fishing and not gotten a hook stuck in your head a time or two (or very close calls to it?)<br>  <br>  I wear a hat for sun but the number one reason is for safety purposes.|`|7royFhIgaa	I wear cap most all the time.

CeRof6draa	I've used them before but only on catfish. They are legal for use in Oklahoma but they have to be checked every 6 hours and you can only have 20 out at a time. Be sure to check your local regs|`|IEjc4R3Raa	First thing is to check your local regs. Yo-yos are not legal everywhere. And I don't know any place where they're legal for gamefish. <br>  <br>  That said, I have used them, in the past, quite successfully. Most of the time you'd use them for the same fish that you'd  set a trot line for. For most of us, that means catfish---which is what I've used them for. <br>  <br>  If the places you fish have overhanging brush, you can achieve the same thing without going to the expense of buying the yo-yos. Tie your fishing line to a thin, limber branch, and you'll get the same effect.|`|aEadwhXQaa	They are illegal in most states.  Commercial fishers can use them in ocean waters.  Most of the fellows who go for near shore fish will use bar gear.  That is a piece of concrete re bar with several baited hooks attached.  A rope and float are tied to the bar.

Work on your jumping, dribbling and shot selection. Know what you do well and work on it, know what you don't do well and work harder at it. If you are right handed work or your left hand, practice defense more than anything.

BA1TOMr9aa	Yes they would, so far this season Torres has been injured alot but Gerrard has played, we havn't really seen Liverpool without these 2 players playing, either one of them is playing while the other isn't or there both playing, but Liverpool would be useless without these 2, they wouldn't have a midfield, or any attack.|`|qO7nbSQVaa	When you take the two men out of a two man team you are basically left with rubbish, a team where your star man is someone with the qualities of Dirk Kuyt so yes Liverpool would fall apart faster than Humpty Dumpty.|`|2zwd4FCRaa	You mean like they did when they played man u earlier this season without either player?|`|3a9fab97f268dfb84b622bec18cc0cd5aa	both over rated i say|`|6KZA7D97aa	of course!|`|7Tw7s6HSaa	yes, most defo|`|PwHQSAxvaa	In fairness, they aren't that great WITH them, are they?|`|3ZrTiVFCaa	Nope<br>  As Good As a Team As Liverpool Are No Player is Bigger then the Team As (Phil Brown said). Liverpool Fc Will Probbably Not Play As Good As They Would With Torres & Gerrard But They Got Money So They Could Buy Player With It. But It will be very hard to replace Gerrard & Torres.|`|40kCOPicaa	yes, also Man U without Rooney and Ronaldo will fall apart too|`|QDXnM1l6aa	YES|`|UmWfQ6u7aa	they would b worse than arsenal
0da6ab3c6b462dc6d34ee0177bdc0459aa	Extremely good for heart rate and endurance. Don't just jump up and down move your feet and set up the foot work.  This increase you agility dramatically|`|aHQRwZ3Laa	Absolutely yes, it is fantastic exercises, it tones your abs because it tones your core with balance and cardio, so it's one of the best exercises you can do|`|yv0N5w0baa	yes|`|5yZICXImaa	Jump Rope is a great exercise. It involves little arms to swing the rope and your leg get targeted a great amount. Yes it can tone the abs because abs isn't all about ab workouts but losing fat and jump rope is a great way to lose that.

India still have good players like Gambhir, Sehwag, Raina, Yuvraj, Dhoni etc so Sachin won't be missed as badly.|`|AA11088802	they win by 10 wickets :O|`|b7f6b1292b666a974a7a9c247d278b21aa	No.  On the contrary it gives an opportunity for youngsters to make a loud statement of their potential, which is good for the future of Indian cricket.<br>  <br>  I am glad I was right and Gambhir has grabbed the opportunity with both hands!|`|HSXxRjysaa	Yes,definetly, and i'm 100% sure that rohith Sharma will be given another chance to prove himself...what a lucky guy he is!!!!|`|561a42dcf730fd97fc3a2ebd788ea961aa	No i don't think so, Gambhir and Sewag will make good runs~|`|e7f9613d5b480e9758d037bfe66ac6b9aa	no|`|9PrmiWWjaa	It depends.If Gambhir&Sehwag have a good opening,then Sachin's absence will not affect our performance that much.But remember Sachin's presence has always improved our team morale.|`|m29y4kCYaa	No i don't think so, Gambhir and Sewag will make a flying start and note the grounds in New Zealand are very small, even bhaji can score a century if he opens.|`|IxQzS9SEaa	It will effect for sure but very slightly. If Yuvi or Raina makes it a memorable Innings India can Win the match|`|r5Lqi2cMaa	Undoubtedly. Without Sachin's 160 last game NZ would of won easily.|`|0ac3af7f05344feefbb618ff09a3b896aa	I think yes!!!<br>  Because Sachin is in form and if he miss India will miss a great player from their side.|`|W5WoSQeeaa	no

2s244jGgaa	That one about the South Australian being homesick, is probably Matthew Pavlich or Brad Ebert. Both are south australians, and whilst they both have had alot of success at their clubs they are homesick. Brad Ebert was a rising star nominee last year and i think he was in the top 20 picks, and we all know how good matty pavlich is.<br>  <br>  Another rumour is that John worsfolds job is in alot of jeopordy, aswell as Eddie Mguire. Both were under the pump alot last season and their futures wil be determined this season, in 2009.|`|VLCUDZlcaa	none so far .....love your avatar pic though ;)  Freddy rocks!|`|kIEUTLIdaa	Don't know whether this is what you're after (maybe slanderous!) but I heard Buddy has been done for rugs on the three strike policy and is not playing this year but it will be reported as an injury.

Q2sZhNmJaa	How about a fun little side shooting game called 'get digger.'  Arm the cars with little guns and have them fire at digger & friends on the track and then go down into Diggers hole to get him.    Just think how much fun that would be!|`|mfvtpCpCaa	I think they should add some commentary. Like for the Cup racing, have DW, Larry Mac, and Mike Joy commentating, for the Nationwide races have Jarrett, Punch and Petree and for the truck races have Rick Allen, Phil Parsons and Michael Waltrip. I think that would be awesome. Also, they need to drop all of the fake drivers and add more real ones. <br>  <br>  My opinion, If they merged Nascar 99 and 2000's commentary with Nascar Thunder 2004's racing, it would be awesome.|`|vrXiRA94aa	I think the new game (whenever it'll come out, not this year though.) needs a whole new game engine. You know, a new graphics engine and physics to really let the game stand out. I for one don't mind playing on my Xbox 360, and some people complain that the games are too arcady, but I don't mind one bit. Hopefully the new NASCAR game is released on console. I'm not much of a computer person. <br>  <br>  Here's just a little wish list for me.<br>  1.) Better physics. You know, when you tap the car in front of you heading into three, they should spin out, not go faster. <br>  2.) More realistic damage. When I play NASCAR 09 and smack the wall hard, generally I can keep going without problem. But do that in real life, and you've got some pretty hefty damage that'll put you a few laps down.<br>  3.) Smart AI. It's almost like the AI is on the specific line as if there's no tomorrow. I want to see them so they can run up high, down low, anywhere to fight for position. <br>  4.) More licensed drivers. I hate seeing guys like Ron Hornaday, Johnny Benson, and Todd Bodine left out of the game. I mean, for Pete's sake, the top driver in the truck series is Colin Braun! He's the only main dude in there! I think NASCAR 05 had more drivers. And I hate how they use multiple drivers for each car, in the Nationwide Series. And where in the world is Brad Keselowski??<br>  5.) Realism. I expect long, spread out lines racing in Fontana. I expect crazy packs at Dega. Not seeing either. And better visuals and lighting. I want to see day to night transition, darn it! Even the Nintendo 64 games had that.<br>  6.) Licensed manufactures. The generic cars bore me a little bit.<br>  7.) A better career mode. Where I can driver for an actual team,and purchase teams, release real drivers, etc. Probably won't happen with the releasing the drivers, but still, I thought NASCAR 07 had a great career mode. You could purchase DEI, Hendrick, etc., and run a new team with them. That was really neat. <br>  <br>  And last but not least, leave out the alcohol sponsors. I could care less and would rather not look at them. For those of you who are so desperate to have alcohol sponsors on your car, I find no point in it. Having the driver's name on the car is fine by me. And plus, do you really want a video game with alcohol sponsors that kids could see? Think about that.|`|Cf7rZsyzaa	ability to drive down pit road. that would be awesome. im still not sure why they dont make that an option, if they think its to complicated for people than just make it a choice were you can turn it on or off. Also stop the generic crap, i know it doesnt make much of a difference but if dale jr drives a chevy i want to see a chevy, if da 'biff drives a ford i wanna see a ford, if kasey drives a dodge i wanna see a dodge, and if reutimann drives a toyota then god dangit i wanna see a toyota. lol just a thought.<br>  <br>  oh and also what storm bandit said LOL!!! that would be amazing.|`|0MuRCU5paa	The previous games did if I remember right. The game that had total team control had it for sure. What they need to add is the ability to sign other drivers to your team, like getting Gordon or Labonte to drive for you, not just the generic drivers, which never changed I think.|`|a8EndhDmaa	2 player for people that do not have online game play <br>  i miss racein my old man it was fun|`|2cbxsEVlaa	The ability to drive three wide at places like daytona and talladega for the whole race, countless times i have finishes at those places that remind me of when they did not run with rerstrictor plates at all. Also i want more on track action like wrecks to dodge, i always here the same thing after my race "The race went by without any cautions," "Wow, that doesnt happen very often" Well apparently it does!!! Going in the pits would be cool and changing paint schemes and having old drivers (Dale Earnhardt)be able to be unlocked would be nice too. Nascar Thunder 2004 really was the best game from EA sports, they need to combine that with this years edition.|`|ZMPvSH7uaa	Catfish loves women and thinks that maybe the should have some virtual nascar girls and you get to do something with them in the game.   have them be spotter and the see a blonde with really big boobs covered in a bikini talking to you.  but she is smart and knows her nascar and is hot.  Just something with women catfish loves women.|`|smDClNDkaa	WE drive the warm up laps<br>  WE drive in the pits<br>  WE drive under caution<br>  WE drive after the checker flag waves<br>  REAL cars.  They are all the same. No makes or shown. Same goes for the Trucks. Forget if busch was all the same or if they had the makes.<br>  No fake tracks in the season.

caecd9e3d614f2b68ccbea2108f571efaa	I shot lots of rabbits and a few squirrels with a Crossman 1377 when I was a kid.  Rabbits are pretty easy to kill compared to squirrels, in my opinion. I almost never had to shoot a rabbit twice, squirrel got shot twice pretty often and sometimes more than twice. I'm a little ashamed to admit it, but some squirrel got away crippled.<br>  <br>  I believe that a pellet gun that can produce a minimum of 500 fps. muzzle velocity with an 8 grain pellet should be o.k. for rabbits inside of 20 yards. The Crossman 1377 is one of a very few pellet handguns that can achieve that kind of velocity for under $200.|`|39d77d396b6018aac260eb632b7665f9aa	Pellet pistols are difficult to hunt with, because for a clean, humane kill you have to make a head shot..<br>  <br>  The Crosman 1377 is capable of taking small game(squirrel) at close range, if you are capable of making that shot.<br>  <br>  It takes a minimum of 2.0fpe at impact to hunt a mouse or sparrow, 3.0fpe for squirrel, starling or pigeon and 5.0fpe for rabbit. <br>  <br>  Domed pellets are "generally" the most effective for hunting purposes, but always use the pellets that are most accurate in your gun. <br>  <br>  The 1377 is pretty accurate, you can expect 1/2in - 3/4in 3 shot groups at 20 yards<br>  <br>  A 1377 also does fairly well with average weight pellets. 525fps with Crosman Premier(7.9gr) and 500fps with RWS Superdome(8.3gr)....This gives you a muzzle energy of around 4.6fpe-4.8fpe|`|rbaneMrOaa	no dat gun is a ball of ****|`|tAayZbTZaa	maybe a sparrow but not a deer fo sho
ModuhBDIaa	Statistically it is possible to get autograph and jersey cards from packs at retail stores like Target but the chances are slim.<br>  <br>  Also there are people who searches pack by feel (which damages the cards) and by weight, so often all the best cards have already been bought.  I have heard stories that these pack searchers are even friendly with store employees who give him first shot at new fresh packs.<br>  <br>  All in all retail stores are only good if you are looking for commons to build a set.  A hit happens but it is rare.  You are better off buying from a card specialty store or online.|`|UWJinEbIaa	No you have to go to a specialty store for those items.

AA12172407	Terrible move. The message you send the players by firing the coach this late in the season is either "We pack it in" or "STEP IT UP"...most of the time this backfires and the team goes down the tubes. This (from the outside) doesn't seem like a positive...the last months or so the team has been in ruins.|`|ULw1777caa	This late in the season?  Bad move.  Sounds like they are throwing in the towel.|`|w4DIPHf1aa	Carboneau lost the room, he had no choice.|`|LEQowzHCaa	This is a move that had to pain Gainey greatly. He and Carbonneau have been friends since the early 1980s, playing together with the Canadiens until Gainey's retirement in 1989, then working together in Dallas with the Stars when Gainey was that club's general manager — up to Carbonneau's hiring by Gainey, first as an assistant coach in 2005-06 and then taking over as head coach in 2006-07.<br>  <br>  Carbonneau would receive a nomination as NHL Coach of the Year, guiding the Habs to a first overall finish in the Eastern Conference in 2007-08.<br>  <br>  Expectations were high for the Canadiens this season. The team was celebrating its centennial and many experts (including yours truly) not only saw the Canadiens as having the potential to finish atop the East again, but also as legitimate Stanley Cup contenders.<br>  <br>  Unfortunately, the season hasn't panned out as expected for the Canadiens and their demanding fan base. Following a strong start to the season in which the club was fourth overall in the conference by the All-Star break, the Canadiens have struggled through an 8-11-1 record in their last 20 games.<br>  <br>  It does suck seeing Guy Carbonneau gone.... but he did struggle a bit after the all star break and i think it was a good move.|`|AA11051192	The Habs are heading int he opposite direction right now. Their star players (*cough* Kovalev *cough*) aren't performing and the coaching is overusing players and tiring the team down. A coaching change is the best for the Habs, especially with all this pressure on their 100th anniversary to do good. Heck, before the season they were Stanley Cup favorites, now they are just a loss or 2 from falling out of the playoff race completely. I guess we'll hafta wait and see what happens down the home stretch now.<br>  <br>  <br>  GO B'S!!!|`|m2k4yaOaaa	I thought it was hilarious!  Go Sabres!|`|yVZR0N0Haa	Very good move.  The Habs need a kick in the butt right now and I was never a Carbonneau fan to begin with.  I don't think he had his players focus or respect.  Go Habs Go

The best strategy in conflict is....  Not to play by the "opponent's" rules.  When you let another set the rules, then you limit your options.  That's a good strategy no matter what level of conflict you find yourself in.  <br>  <br>  Just don't play their game.  This both helps you to save face AND creates a strategic advantage for you because the opponent doesn't know what to expect.  See, he has created a script about how things are suppose to go.  If you don't follow the script, his confidence will be shaken and he will get more desperate to get back on script.  You will either frustrate his efforts to the point he will give up or he will show his own weakness.  <br>  <br>  "Hence that general is skilful in attack whose opponent does not know what to defend; and he is skilful in defense whose opponent does not know what to attack." <br>  --  Sun Tzu, The Art of War|`|wFXknE2aaa	Follow through punch him in the tummy.

eac78f41a64d286478c23785cf30be23aa	"Ruby" had the misfortune of not being discovered until his 20s.  He was 25 when he made his major-league debut and, because of his lack of defensive versatility, was always second or third man down on the depth chart at 1B.<br>  <br>  As a bench player, he teased with his sweet swing and occasional power.  But the fact is that left-handed defensive liabilites in their mid 20s, even those with 20/80 potential, are often pigeon-holed as pinch hitters and back-up First Basemen.<br>  <br>  When he finally got his shot with the A's, he had a very good year followed by a pretty good year followed by a complete drop-off.  In those two big years, he averaged over 520 at-bats.  He had never managed to get more than 222 at bats in any other season.<br>  <br>  Age seemed to catch up with him quickly after '04.  He kept getting passed over on the roster by guys who were younger and/or had more defensive versatility.  Once injuries robbed him of his former power, his marketability was pretty much gone.<br>  <br>  Even though he was still hitting homers in the Mexican League as of last fall, his time has pretty much passed as far as a Major League career is concerned.|`|0f213e569404219f01d20decc3749462aa	Injuries, he's been invited to a few different teams spring training squads over the past 4 years.

Even on TV!<br>  <br>  I'd also like to watch Baseball, on TV it's really boring to watch. But it looks fun to watch it in real life.<br>  <333|`|0fdea5c7c4c63ee0b9a5aff838c155c7aa	1st--baseball--love the atmosphere<br>  2nd--hockey--more fights!|`|85vDqn6naa	Baseball and Hockey, i love how ruthless the hockey players are and the vibe is great!|`|RQc8fbjbaa	Baseball and then Basketball. The only two I really understand. ?|`|dblnhz6Caa	Hockey!!  It's great to sit by the glass and get to see all the action.  There is fist fitting and everyone loves it when the guys get knocked into the wall.  I've gone to games since i was 5 and always enjoy myself.
oNR7il8baa	Shut it... He's a smart Cabinet he wouldn't move to a dirty place lol jk|`|MjPd9vyYaa	Haha...he would breakdown into little pieces. You know because he's not used to ALL that weight! :P<br>  <br>  Shame on you Stefy! vv :P Your Aguero lives in that country! :P|`|3yqCKPzVaa	it's "exiled" darkie... exiled...|`|WdOAxQmoaa	what kind od name is that "Arsenal trophy cabinet".<br>  <br>  <br>  get a grip.

IJvwYe1yaa	Inzaghi, Del Piero, Totti.. any good Italian player who is underrated on this site.|`|Vjan4Vq2aa	Steven Gerrard. Some people thinks he's overrated because they say his team isn't good and he doesn't score much. Actually, Liverpool is the second best team in England and have won Champions League with him as captain. The reason he doesn't score as much is because he a passer and one of the best team players in the world. Also, he has 5 goals in the UCL, tied with Messi and Benzema, so he does score goals.|`|PsCS0GK3aa	I don't know, but back me up on this:<br>  <br>  <a href="http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index;_ylt=AmhfhUR5qj6tiXrFD9SRn8Dsy6IX;_ylv=3?qid=20090309084804AAHGicL&show=7#profile-info-lklLABq6aa">http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index;...</a>|`|cOPCNP7Laa	Inzaghi!!! He scores a hat trick and u immediately see people dissing him. U then prove he scores nice goals, which was the pt of the Q, and no one even bothers to acknowledge that. Headasses!|`|cf4d6d60fab75efc136a4d66dd5c03b4aa	Ronaldo, kudos his diving skill
6qngoElyaa	Crynaldo.. his celebrations are over the top|`|Veit7Oa2aa	Easy, Ibra<br>  <br>  Never really proved his hype.<br>  <br>  Ronaldo has unfortunately proved how good he is countless times.<br>  This does not seem to stop him being such an arrogant little ***** however.<br>  <br>  <br>  Probably best suited to prem also for his speed on the counter, game is slower on the continent.|`|Avcf6iKuaa	they are both kind of overrated.  ibra was really overrated in the beginning of the season but he is now improving.|`|SjLDdUh7aa	Ibra|`|IJvwYe1yaa	I'm gonna say Ibra because he's the highest paid player in the world.|`|v6sIDvMoaa	i'd say they are evenly rated. but crynaldo is just a fag|`|cOPCNP7Laa	Ibra. His nose is underrated :P|`|cf4d6d60fab75efc136a4d66dd5c03b4aa	Long-nose-ovic|`|wrhqkEiMaa	Nobody is more overrated than Ronaldo at the moment.  At least Ibra has some skills and can score nice goals or set up his teammates for a goal, Ronaldo just knows how to do that stupid stepover sh*t and dive.|`|Wv0UKUdiaa	Every Inter's player is overrated!!!!|`|VpiYSQVnaa	Ibra's nose is overrated!!|`|3yqCKPzVaa	<a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/41831834@N00/176871173/" rel="nofollow">http://www.flickr.com/photos/41831834@N0...</a>

vNwgUggyaa	Track teams require track shoes, these usually have cleats in them. Now, if your looking to run a cross country team could be a better sport for you. A pair of nike runners could be found cheap if you look long enough, and you can even use them after the season. If you decide to get more serious in the sport you should go to a specialty store where they can watch you run and see what kind of shoe is best for you, depending on if your neutral, overpronate or underpronate, but thats complicated and something you probably wont need to know unless you get serious about it.|`|ojNHRsj7aa	yes theyre fine. read the reviews.|`|4REeX6lbaa	those shoes wouldn't be good because they dont have any support whatsoever and they dont have spikes, or aches. You need better ankle support and those shoes will leave you with a sprained ankle or shin splints... i highly suggest you getting better running shoes..yes they are expensive but they will help you do better and you wont get hurt (witch will cost a lot more money in the end if you get hurt)
595902780e2c09920890743b229c9c08aa	<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<< Yes I am! I was having nervous breakdowns every week. Heck, I may not change my underwear until he loses. J/K LOL ;) The Misses would have none of that.|`|ajnGHNr8aa	It was nice to see the other Busch brother win one.  Kurt has grown on me over the years as he matured.  I am not sure about that backwards lap though LOL. He needs to get with Carl's victory trainor.|`|mIdcJEJNaa	I was happy to see Roger's car win, and a like Kurt more than I did at the time Jimmy Spenser punched his face in..<br>  I don't exactly root for him, but he can be a good driver to watch..|`|XNdDrXAzaa	We needed someone to put Dodge in Victory Lane<br>  I thought it was so cool for Kurt Busch to do that.<br>  As far as i'm concerned, he can keep on winning.|`|0829df852fa519b2e4acb82ff156a13eaa	Yes it was fun to see Kurt win, and I liked the originality of his victory lap. Takes more skill to drive in reverse around a track than roast the tires of a car other guys will have to work on when you're done playing....|`|PGlZn1wEaa	It was cool to see him win.  Both him and Penske deserved the win.  I still think his car is the best looking car on the track and it was nice seeing it in victory lane.  That blue is just unbelievable to see up close.|`|2BRZy8Mfaa	I was happy, not only for Kurt, but for DODGE. They really needed a pick-me-up, hopefully this will encourage RPM to get that new DODGE motor in his cars.|`|NC2BfEvLaa	I wanted my boy to win but Kurt had the car and that dude drove the wheels off of it !

And he signed a die cast for me last week at Las Vegas.  I wish he had done better at Vegas, but worth the wait to watch him win at Atlanta.|`|54d87ada5cbd610e99a576802ad52e06aa	Yep how awesome was thta. I saw he had tears of joy. Great for him|`|9vcZjFl6aa	wish it  was dale jr. but he deserves to win one i think he paid his dues|`|nlpPYkHkaa	no|`|JSryPP8faa	Yes and thank's for asking and a special thank you to Superdave in his decision making process.|`|S2vI4VEXaa	Loved it!! <br>  Kurt's a pretty close 2nd to Kyle for me...I'd love him to get himself another championship.<br>  Kyle needs one first, Kurt.<br>  Share the wealth boys.

e3m3rdNYaa	I would be so ******* happy!! I would probably go out, buy an Italian Flag and fly it over my house just to show how ******* happy I really was! <br>  <br>  I would grow a Unibrow, to show my dedication!<br>  <br>  I would Distort all if my friend's names!|`|rH3ylNuYaa	well if santino started sleeping with the bosses daughter and triple H broke up , yeah santino would be world champ and triple h would be out of a job or be a jobber in ECW.|`|1z7M3Tntaa	wow....errrmmm well i don't know what I'd do actually that would be interesting, maybe all of a sudden he'd turn very serious and we'd find out he's an actual good wrestler (which he is).|`|Xkm4PstOaa	I would rather Santino hold the title for the first time, then HHH holding it for the millionth time!<br>  Santino does have some wrestling ability; the WWE just doesn't showcase it properly!<br>  As you said, I'm sure it will never happen.. but if it does, I would just be happy that HHH doesn't have the belt!|`|ZbNXVQu7aa	If it ever happens, I might actually die from laughing so hard and so often that I forget to eat, drink, and/or breathe, especially if I heard Santino give a victory speech.|`|smcDn76jaa	Exactly what you said. Laugh. Then I would realize all prestige from the WWE title is gone, and sigh shamefully.|`|iOICjcZcaa	lol well I'd be happy. ANYONE but Triple H.|`|hL3eS2zKaa	Haha, I doubt that'll happen, but as you said, for fun.<br>  I would slam the TV on the ground, then go on the computer, look up Santino Marella, and it'll say he won the Divas Championship instead.<br>  <br>  But in all seriousness, I'd be happy for him. Finally a breath of fresh air, not sayying HHH isnt a good wrestler, but he's a boring champion. And the title should belong to someone else.|`|R4dXxh6paa	I would lick your butthole.......watch "Weirder. Blacker. Dimpler" to get that jokes. <br>  <br>  I would love that. I think it would be the coolest thing WWE has ever done since the Attitude Era|`|95uXmC94aa	HAHAHA OMG. I'D PISS MY PANTS. and unplug all my phones. I placed a bit that Santino would never win it from HHH.<br>  I LOVE MY HAIR|`|lHAKRQaqaa	the next night undertaker would win the womens championship|`|mJvZhdAuaa	I'd probably swallow my tongue.|`|h5lOMoqBaa	I would just be happy that it was not Botchlov or Botchtista|`|NG5mOGsUaa	He would lose it the next day on RAW|`|L3MkAG6Qaa	Cheer. Santino loses tons of matches, and looks like an idiot, just for the comedy factor of the business. He's actually a great wrestler, if you pay attention to some of his serious matches. And I don't respect Triple H at all, so I think Santino would be a much better champion.|`|raSr9PYhaa	hahahahaha thats so funny I s.h.i.t on my pants. and fart on my my classmates face. and I took of my mammas pants of and started flying around the house for babies. I also holded my mamas b.o.o.bs and swing her around the world. HAHAHAHAHA DUDE your so funny. AND I would get my dads ciggaret packet and chew it to hell. THANK YOU FOR MAKING ME LAUGH TO DEATH!! HAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHHAHAHHAHAHHAHAHAHAHAH... santino marella sucks!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!...|`|7ImGw976aa	Most likely be laughing for the rest of the day, just can't ever take that character seriously. He'd just be comedy if he won really any title, like when he held the IC.|`|lz7oTQNXaa	i would say wow fair play to santino, we get to see more santino marella more often which would be great because hes probably the only interesting part of raw.|`|qAmO4803aa	If Santino Marrella Won The Title I Would LOL!!!  The WWE Would Have The Third Funniest WWE Champion Ever!|`|9vuf0TCSaa	I think santino marella will end up the next day to santino mozarella|`|rt8E2JhKaa	The WWE would have gone so low if they do that, but it would be so funny, the fans reactions and stuff. LOL!!!|`|OuFhcdX9aa	well for one i will not take this question the least bit seriously.<br>  santino will never win a world title.|`|f2d3d8edde822210301b7dc5946235ecaa	HaHa That would make my day. Imagine they did make that happen that would be funny lol.|`|1JywgkyMaa	he'll lose it the next day,but first he would say,"I AM THE GREATEST CHAMPION,OF ALL THE TIMES!!!!!"|`|hOTx5lbeaa	i'd laugh then EVENTUALLY get tried of him and wait fo triple h to become wwe champ again|`|hVCiSk4Raa	That would be the best thing to happen to WWE in awhile|`|VlvektSJaa	That would be awesome!!!!<br>  <br>  <br>  A change for once.

CrWcnQx7aa	honestly, loves his trickery and simply one of the best player in the world when on form... sadly, too arrogant and big headed...|`|7KZepeq3aa	I am not saying Ronaldo does not dive, but alot of tackles are genuine fouls.<br>  Because of the speed Ronaldo runs at defenders it does not take much a knock for him to go down, and lets face it, he is that good that for most players its the only way they can deal with him.<br>  <br>  And the answer is YES, you would all love him to play for your club.|`|cf4d6d60fab75efc136a4d66dd5c03b4aa	Ronaldo is simply the best.<br>  <br>  Dude- Dark Mistress is a girl.|`|MxfjoVrMaa	If Cristiano Ronaldo did sign for West Ham United, which he won't, I would be happy that he had joined because he is probably the best player not only in England and Europe, but in the world. Ronaldo does sometimes cheat because he dives but if West Ham United did buy him then I would not be moaning about it anymore.|`|MUERDKyzaa	Some man u fans don't even like ronaldo, so that says alot.<br>  If Torres dived ridiculously, kicked out at players when the ref wasn't watching and fueled transfer rumours, he would certainly loose respect among fans and everyone else. Especially if the latter happened alot of fans would be calling for blood and for him to be sold.|`|svU3xeotaa	i was gonna post the same exact thing, people, fans, players. all diss ronaldo but still want his autograph, picture, and they wish they had him. seriously ppl these days are such h8rs. who cares if he dives, thats the way he plays.|`|ojHN65J0aa	I honestly would not want Ronaldo at my club. <br>  Not for any B.S reasons, he's been our competitor, he was/is the enemy and I dont want him in my fold.|`|Vjan4Vq2aa	I agree. The only reason they hate Ronaldo is because he's too good and have to pick on stupid stuff he does, like diving, which is what all footballers do, so you can't really say he's the worst diver in the world. If he went to any other club, their fans would shut up and cheer for him. It's hypocrisy.
VoKx0929aa	alright this is an easy question. i would get the FIT TRL 3 because its manufactured by S&M and also its a great bike.<br>  Pros<br>  - Made in the USA!<br>  - full chromoly frame, fork, bars, cranks.<br>  - Fit FAF tires (very nice)<br>  - Odyssey Monolever medium <br>  - Alienation Black Sheep rims<br>  - Fit ECCD seat<br>  - Fit seat post<br>  - Intergrated Headset<br>  - Mid BB<br>  - 25/9 T gearing<br>  - 8" bars 27" wide<br>  - sealed rear hub<br>  - Fit is the best company out there<br>  - Fit Bike Co's team is packed with all good riders like Mike Aitken,     Tom White, Edwin De Larosa, Chase Hawk, Chase Dehart, Eddie C... <br>  <br>  The best gyro is the Odyssey GTX-R aluminum for $45 on danscomp.com<br>  <br>  but then u'll need a bunch of other cables and stuff like an Odyssey london mod, and gyro cables. get the Odyssey M2 lever its the same as the moonolever but made for gyros there is also holes on the headset drilled for gyro tabs dans comp has tabs for ur frame<br>  if u decide not to get a gyro upgrade your cable to a linear for the extra braking power and a smoother pull <br>  <br>  By the way if you want a We The People bike i would get the ENVY.<br>  also if you plan on not using brakes buy the Fit STR3 or Signature.<br>  the TRL bikes do not come with pegs so if u intend to grind but use pegs ull need to buy them|`|bi7Wubx4aa	i personally own last years version of the wtp trust it feels amazing its top quality and this year they only made it better, so thats where my vote falls<br>  <br>  the fit's are also very good bikes but the eastern and norco arent good so i'd stay away from them
4L69Jqzkaa	Seems to me like you have to work on your cardiovascular/stamina. Just cause you can bench 300lb doesn't mean you can run, two totally different things.<br>  <br>  Try using LSD or Long Slow Distance, run long distance in slow speed. I know you're under time constraint but I'm sure you're capable of working your stamina up to speed.
mIdcJEJNaa	You can't address the haters, they don't care if he wins all the races..<br>  Talk about percentages, and lap times, and they are lost..<br>  Not too many drivers could do what Jr did, by having his stats hold up,<br>  even after two, or three seasons running in inferior equipment, and the<br>  conflicts, and problems of changing teams..<br>  He met his goals last year (a points race, and The Chase), and even<br>  exceeded them by winning two non-points paying races..<br>  At this point he's only sixty points behind Jimmie, and considering how bad a start they have had, it isn't too bad at all..|`|739f14d79f8285fdffb364bed6c305feaa	He could win the next 32 races Lenny and it wouldn't be enough, there will always be haters as long as Junior drives a race car and is popular.|`|595902780e2c09920890743b229c9c08aa	Jr is a good driver just not one of my favorites. No hatin behind this computer.<br>  <br>  <br>  Nice avatar Steffy!  : ) Your a great sport!|`|0093382286e191b54fe019326d1aa456aa	Infinite is not a number.|`|XNdDrXAzaa	educated people don't hate|`|E4bbO2Cdaa	For the publicity and fan support he has, you'd think that 2-3 PER SEASON would be a minimum requirement.  Throw in a championship, or even being close enough the last race of the season to smell the champ's exhaust and that would help too.<br>  It may sound like I'm a "hater" but I really like the guy!  But you have to admit, for his limited success, he's really got a lot of folks taking off the red and donning GREEN.  I hope he lives up to what all those fans are hoping for.  I know my driver finally did (#48) and it's cool to see them run off with wins like that.  I wish the same for Jr. and think that with a good (Hendrick engine) "TEAM" around him, he'll do even better this year.|`|XJv0wTsDaa	Look i like Jr and yeah he is a good driver ,but to hear alot of his fans talk hes the greatest out there which is far from the case dont get me wrong i like Jr and even hope he does well to get alot of folks off his back ,but you gotta admit a few of the JR fans have caused alot of the JR bashing with the way they act , if you dont belive me go to a race and you will see what im talking about|`|50e3b0849b4360114052f91433a42927aa	for me...............he will have to be a contender EVERY week.<br>  right now he is a good driver,but like i said to get to the next level,he needs to contend every week,like rowdy,johnson,edwards.these drivers are top notch............i think that if changes are made within the hendrick organization,perticularly the 88 team.........like new crew chief,he can reach that next level.i would like to see him get there.<br>  <br>  might i add............people expect him to be like his daddy,which i think will never happen,and for that i think that this causes alot of disgust with fans of nascar.<br>  <br>  that brings me to the waltrips...............one was a hell of a racer and won what,82 races i think.the other has what 4 i believe.<br>  <br>  some people have what it takes and others dont.|`|bJn83u7Oaa	i thought one every 18 was good...but i guess you need to win 8 races a year and then suck in the chase so you don't get bashed...<br>  <br>  honestly, i think he's going to have to win a championship before the haters even get close to stopping...i'm pulling for him just so everybody will leave him alone|`|O45zWBesaa	Until he matches his father in wins and championships, there will be haters. <br>  <br>  He is a good driver who is getting better.<br>  <br>  Only time will tell.|`|a8EndhDmaa	jr. is one hell of a driver <br>  he needs to prove nothing to me<br>   <br>  <br>  LEAVE DALE ALONE LEAVE HIM ALONE <br>  lol <br>  people are ignorant|`|yyJo3ybBaa	2 - 3|`|4672d43d9179b437a11c03398bfe9cf4aa	37|`|lDHBJF2Naa	damm he had to go take out Hamlin and Busch in daytona, thx jr learn to drive you were a lap down.

But there is no doubt this years it's between Kobe and LeBron.|`|C4mzZwiWaa	kobe and lebron is 9999999999999999999999 times better than wade.<br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  BUT wade is a great player, i respect him.|`|GBGcI509aa	Son ive been saying hes gonna be mvp before the Summer started.|`|AsIGEd2daa	He's basically on the same boat LeBron was on. Puts up crazy stats but his team can't pull out a win. LeBron has half-decent teammates now and he's got a winning team now. If the heat do the same thing for Wade, there would be no doubt that he would be in the thick of the MVP race.|`|IlsXc1KDaa	I'm jumping on the Speedy Claxton bandwagon.

mYmh4a7Zaa	I think the most forgotten team in the AFL would be The Fremantle Dockers. I have also noticed that though my 14 years of living I've never met a port adelaide supporter. I have heard off other people being to the middle of Australia saying that there are heaps but i don't think More ethan Fremantle supporters.

Always slip under the limelight.|`|mXFOru11aa	i always forget about Saint Kilda they are always laying low with no contraversys|`|90907b7c487c66bf81c4bee8fda1d645aa	I came understand years ago, that all clubs are basically the same after working at 4 AFL clubs, just different faces doing similar jobs, and players wearing different colours.  That means I don't mind all AFL clubs, with Freo the one exception !   I cannot stand their colours, jumper design, and that abhorrent  theme song.  Similarly l am not trying to offend the club or their supporters, but honestly whoever selected purple, red and green and agreed to that song, Freo heavo ! blimey, they could not possibly be from  the real world, or at least the football world.  If they used marketers, they should be sacked and closed down, and launched back into outer space where they obviously came from.!   I will admit though,that their away jumper, the white with Purple anchor is reasonable, but in all honestly, if Freo are playing in a game on telly, i am usually happy to FORGET them and to be doing something else,|`|mj1bC73gaa	Well quite often I need to jot down the 16 teams and it always seems to be either Melbourne or St Kilda that I write last.  Last time I did it though, it was Essendon who haven't exactly been memorable in the past few years.<br>  <br>  I suppose I always think - two from each of the non-Vic footy states, one from each of the Latte states and ten from Vic, so the Freo, WCE, Power, Crows, Swans, Lions bit always comes first.  Inner Melbourne is the problem!|`|ZlFZtTlmaa	Port, until my aunty reminds me when they beat Essendon. :(.

NC2BfEvLaa	I would say all of them except C. ! It would be nice for him to win there !|`|Aw2oxQnuaa	I look for him to have a good run at all of these tracks. He has always struggled at Texas, but he has turned around this year, so I can see him still leading the points after Phoenix with 1 or 2 wins thrown in. I think he has a pretty good shot at a win at Briston and Martinsville, if lap traffic stays out of his way and doesnt get caught in any wrecks.|`|YHYT8qMKaa	His best chance is probably at Martinsville. His record there is incredible: seven wins and seven poles. But he has a great chance at Bristol and Phoenix as well. He is doing well and is bound to be in victory lane soon. Hopefully he can win at Thunder Valley in two weeks!|`|0829df852fa519b2e4acb82ff156a13eaa	Dead heat between Bristol and Martinsville. Jeff is hungry and knows how to grind by someone without taking out a bunch of cars. For an example from recent years, ask Rustbucket Wallace. Now if he can just do that to his own car..(Jimmie Johnson)|`|3e1ELOgnaa	I think Bristol or Martinesville and I really hope he wins Texas, so he can mark that track off his list of ones he has won at!|`|op9iJRvBaa	I think he will come in 2nd or 3rd in Bristol, but 1st in Martinsville.|`|AA11971891	A. Bristol|`|jpyy7Rjbaa	i'm only sure thing is ,that he will be sitting on a pole every weekend....|`|tzW8AWJEaa	I think he has a great chance to win at any of the tracks, but his best chance is definitely at Martinsville, with Bristol second, Phoenix third, and Texas fourth.|`|gXIA9yHJaa	I think he wins the next race and if in fact he does there is a very good chance of him winning 2  in a row bristol and martinsville!!|`|5FgfNndWaa	a and b bristol and martinsville and d phoenix texas less likely|`|wmgA0b1yaa	Bristol or Martinsville should provide him his next best chance to finally break his streak.

He is awfully good there just like he is good at Bristol. I wouldn't mind seeing another #2 & #24 battle at Bristol like the old days of the 2 and 24. Good luck to Jeff, he is going to win one here before you know it.|`|mIdcJEJNaa	It has to be Bristol, or Martinsville..<br>  Texas always turns into an embarrassment for Jeff..<br>  Phoenix is not much better, and Jimmie is going to<br>  win Martinsville, so it has to be Bristol..|`|l4ZQchFkaa	B.<br>  D.<br>  A.<br>  C.|`|aRy2ZvT9aa	I'm gonna say Martinsville.<br>  <br>  Go Dale Jr & Hms

ePFdhsCYaa	The reason they play four times a season is that the broadcasters demand it as they make the most money. Loosing two Old Firm games a season and reverting to a 16 team league its just not going to happen unless the financial situation in scottish football changes. They still are very big occasions in the SPL calender.|`|BdiQPKn0aa	No i don't agree|`|SjVukApqaa	I think the Old Firm meeting four times a year in the league is too much.

Why it was Kofi though, I dunno.<br>  I'd rather see him than Knox.|`|UWJinEbIaa	Comparing the 3 is like comparing action heroes from the movies.....let's use Gov. Arnold, Bruce Willis, and Christian Bale.  They all have their positives and negatives and draw huge in the box office but only one gets critical praise from fans and journalists.<br>  <br>  For instance let's examine Jericho who copied the classic Piper's Pit to perfection line-by-line everything looked great on tv....and got heel reaction it was suppose to receive.   Christian Bale was praise for reviving the Batman character for modern audiences in the movies as directed by Christopher Nolan.  Some would say that The Dark Knight is as good as the Batman from 1987 if not better!<br>  <br>  Now RKO is the typical character from the past who follows the specific path much like every other generic Gov. Arnold movie.  It maybe called The Running Man or Commando or Conan the Barbarian you know what to expect and is nothing but mindless entertainment.....aka generic summer popcorn movie.   Often mocked for being type cast and being unable to work outside the action genre. <br>  <br>  Edge is the Bruce Willis type......been in a couple of stinkers like the Jackal and The Kid but he always comes back to what made him famous that being the anti-hero of Die Hard movie fame.   You know he is going to walk into the match......something might go wrong....i.e the Elimination Chamber but at the end of the day he walks out as the champion....yippie-ki-ay....mofos|`|sqfjfR3iaa	1) I thought, this is going to be interesting to see this storyline continue! What twists and turns will it take the rest of the year.<br>  2) I thought this storyline is building toward Wrestlemania XXV. Which legend will he attack next week?<br>  3) Not only is Edge the "Ultimate Opportunitist", but he creates his own opportunities. Who loses one world Heavyweight Championship and wins another one in the same night. Edge is one of hte few wrestlers in the WWE with the stamina to wrestle in two Elimination Chambers in one evening.|`|WQGvE60waa	I laughed and said<br>  <br>  "Get Stephanie Next".<br>  <br>  I hate the New Jerichjo<br>  <br>  His new story is copying Randy Ortons "Legend Killer" one.|`|T13xM9iJaa	Punting Vince-Shocked<br>  Jericho attackings-Was like you suck<br>  Edge winning EC-P.O'd|`|ZbNXVQu7aa	That kick was the moment I liked best out of Orton's career.<br>  <br>  I understand why WWE is having Jericho attack all those legends, but that doesn't mean I have to like it.  I can only hope the next legend Jericho attacks is one I didn't like when I was growing up.<br>  <br>  I was disappointed when Edge took Kofi Kingston's place in the Elimination Chamber because that's when I knew Kane wouldn't leave the match as champion.  We all have our favorite superstars, and on RAW, Kane is mine.|`|d9tCS7BPaa	I think I yelled "OH SNAP!" and started laughing really hard when Orton punted Vince McMahon.<br>  <br>  I didn't see Jericho atack Snuka. But I did see the attacks on Piper and Steamboat. I was kind of indifferent to it really. I mean I already accept Jericho as a great heel...and I didn't think he needed to go around attacking legends that won't lead to any future feud. It was good to establish him as a jerk but other than that it was kind of pointless.<br>  <br>  When Edge got into the EC match, I thought it was bullsh!t. The guy is starting to be a title hog like HHH.|`|8gEMrNSBaa	1.

5W9KNNk4aa	In a world by yourself, you should keep Teixeira.  He will outpreform a 4th round draft pick, which essentially is what he turns out to be.  If you knew for a fact - 100% certainty - that everybody else in your league was going to keep 4 players, and you do get the first pick, there is no harm in NOT keeping him.  You may be able to pick up someone better than Teixeira if they are not kept.  Worst case scenario, you would be able to draft Teixeira back as your 4th round draft choice.|`|69BwydjVaa	Personally I would keep Texieria.  He is going to have a great year in New York.  There is plenty of pitching out there to draft later.  i wouldn't keep Quentin because you are already keeping Sizemore and Braun and they play outfield.|`|xQFWjFyZaa	I agree, you should keep Texieria. He would probably be the first pick in the draft. You can always re-draft Billingsley because I doubt he would be taken in what is really the 5th round.
HxwCiCH6aa	There is A lot that you have to do to get prepared for a competition.<br>  First, You should go to skateisi.org or talk to your coach about joining ISI. <br>  Next, you and your coach should talk about getting your routine together. It sounds like you are doing a Compulsory event, since there is no music and you only do 3 elements. Your coach will help you get all of this together.<br>  Your dress would be fine, but you can get a fancier dress if you really want to. Just remember, the judges dont judge you on your dress.<br>  They usually give out medals or trophies to the first 5 placers. It may vary at different rinks.<br>  As long as you have passed levels in group lessons, you are fine.<br>  Remember to have fun and skate your best!<br>  Good Luck! :-D|`|IsQckOXraa	hi!<br>  It's great that your thinking about doing a competition, they're really fun!<br>  (q's answered in order)<br>  - That just means that you need to be a member of the ISI, you'll need to fill out a member form and pay a fee, about $10- 20, sometimes if you registered in the Learn to Skate program you are already a member.  Ask your coach if you aren't sure.<br>  -  for the highest test registered means that the last test that you toke for the ISI or the last skating test of yours that you tested out of in class.<br>  - making a program can be difficult, but your coach will deal with this and ask for your input on ideas on what you want in it.<br>  - Your private coach would be with you there.<br>  - This is more of a "awards test", so there is no need of having some fancy dress, the blue velvety dress will work fine.<br>  -  They will give out a 1st, 2nd, and 3rd awards and particitaion awards as well. <br>  -  Get rid of all your nerves before you step on the ice, preform for your self and smile at the judges, don't have stiff or noodle arms when you skate just relax.<br>  -  Deep breaths are good too when you are about to go on.<br>  -  Don't think about falling and if you do, get up like nothing happened.<br>  I hope you do well!<br>  :)<br>  EDIT:  If you are not a member then you need to ask your coach for the ISI papers, they will tell you where to get them.<br>  Or ask the people at the front desk.<br>  I really don't know about the rest, i've only taken 2 ISI tests and what I've told you is all that I remember, I'm part of USFSA now.<br>  Sorry!

rNUyV1EYaa	T.O. is boom or bust. He is still an elite receiver; but his reputation precedes him- three teams; three forced exits. That's hard to get around; no matter if you like Owens or not.<br>  <br>  As for J.P. Losman, Trent Edwards is the starting QB anyway. And the Bills signed a new backup in Ryan Fitzpatrick.|`|P8CBDLiKaa	I think it's gonna be an ugly season in Buffalo.  T.O. is used to being the center of his own attention on a big market team, and I'm sure he'll continue to be the center of his own attention in buffalo, but it's a small market team, it's a very young team, and T.O. is starting to slow down.<br>  <br>  Combine that, his mouth, and the increased opportunity to pi$$ people off through his new "reality" show...yeah, this should be a pretty spectacular act of self immolation.|`|ZvU093GPaa	I think if the bills could keep terrell`s mouth shut and keep him concentrating on his game they will do great. however there has not been a team in the NFL that has been able to do that so I think its going to be a public relations nightmare for buffalo|`|yuGhmhGuaa	They had nothing to lose, and Owens is the best receiver that was available this off season.|`|G15dXNlKaa	They will be better than their 7-9 record from last year.|`|doFdrgfKaa	I just hope TO keeps his mouth shut because if he doesn't, the Bill's young QB Trent Edwards is going to have his moral wrecked.  Since he is a young QB, even just a little complaining from TO might rattle Edwards.  <br>  <br>  If TO keeps his mouth shut, the Bills have a realistic shot at a 9-7 season and possibly a playoff berth.  Something around that.<br>  <br>  If TO doesn't keep his mouth shut, I can easily see the Bills going 5-11 or worse.|`|KzlyHEgraa	TO takes the pressure off of Lee Evans but Trent Edwards dosent have that strong of and arm so i dont know how much he can help with the long ball. But overall he should make the team better. The loss of Lynch for 6 games dosent help though because that puts more pressure on the pass.|`|9s9mUUubaa	Well, Terrell is a trouble maker, he has a bad mouth, he has too many locker room altercations. He's a big hassle, but if he plays good I can't be surprised.|`|nY5RxT4Saa	It gives me yet another reason to hate the Bills.|`|EeGJgwkWaa	i love the bills and think TO will help us win. i cant see how it can hurt us that much.|`|AOA8TJraaa	its good|`|ga4ZWsuZaa	The bills screwed themselves, just watch, in about week 6, to will start this sh*t about how he is not getting the ball.

BK1GjPT6aa	I'm about to save you some money for bait! <br>  <br>   It's gonna take some hunting but worth the effort. The type of fishing you want to do is is perfect for a med/med hvy action rod.  For pier and surf, the longer the rod the better but depending on your casting skills, you can get away with a 9-10 footer easy.<br>    For an example of what I'm talking about, I bought a 12 foot  Shakespeare Tide water rod for 20 bucks ( on sale @ wally world)  and bought the matching reel ( shakespeare Platinum) for 32 bucks. 52 bucks of work horse fishing system and the only complaint I have is of the stupid rod tip that came with the rod. I changed that quick and bought a new tip ( 3 bucks) and replaced it myself. I added line... 255 yds. of 17#  test  line ( Ande on sale @ 5 bucks ) and now I have a system perfect  for just about the same fishing you do and more. <br>   I'm not trying to brag, believe me, I'm trying to make a point. A lot of people over look the work horse systems available to them and go right for the name brand and pay out the nose (putting it kindly.)  If you shop around and control that impulse shopping, you come across great deals in the most unlikely places. Sports authority, for example. Did you know that the one in Homestead has several 9-10 footers in the 20-30 dollar range? All med/hvy  and a few with the Penn Brand. Wally World is seasonal and change out their fishing section accordingly and place alot of the items on sale from .10 cents- 5 bucks on higher end stuff worth 2-3 times more ( best time to stock up is 3 months before and up to Spring around here) . I actually bought a shopping cart filled to the top with sales items and only paid 50 bucks! That was years back but it's true.<br>  I know I'm ranting here a bit but I'm trying to help you out. If you're looking for a work horse system good for pier and surf, go with a shakespeare tide water in the 12 ft. ( med action..35 bucks reg. price) and the shakespeare Platinum ( heavy reel..32 bucks) and you'll have a great  system for your style of fishing. You could go for the more expensive stuff but why?  I've dogged out this system and it hasn't failed me yet and besides that, if it ever goes into the ocean I won't cry as hard as I would for a more expensive system. That's just me, I look for deals and prefer the under dogs . I wouldn't have it any other way. ~good luck catchin'.|`|q8dX0MsNaa	you would probably do better using light lures with a spinning outfit. an 8 footer would be good for the pier but a 10 or 12 foot rod would get you better distance in the surf.<br>  you can get an entry level outfit at basspro, cabela's or walmart as previously stated but if you double that budget, you could get a much better outfit that would last longer and give much better service.<br>  get a sand spike for surf fishing. don't get your reel near the sand. that will ruin the most expensive reel. <br>  good luck, B|`|c81fa0395c7807a69ecfa0cdd3674cb1aa	<a href="http://shop.oysterbaytackle.com/product_info.php/cPath/73/products_id/801" rel="nofollow">http://shop.oysterbaytackle.com/product_...</a>|`|TE4W3k8Xaa	check basspro,cablelas and gander mountain for combos, a nine or ten footer should do the job reasonably well,I use PENN,they've been around forever,and have an old one from the forties that's as good as anything you will be able to get today.It was made in the USA,by fisherman,for fisherman.Maybe you'll have to bite the bullet on the cost,but you'll never have to buy another one.They last forever if you care for it regularly,keep it clean and lubed well,wash off the gunk and salt,etc.you can find good condition ones in ebay  or craigslist for real  cheap as well,check yard sales and flea markets,estate sales,and consignment shops sometimes have them when the widow brings one in.I paid $ 100.00 for mine quite a long time ago,now and I've had no complaints about it.Shakespeare also makes a wide range of gear for this specific purpose,and they too have been around forever,you can get one with a lot less money,I think their's are made in china now.
AA10043476	The TNA roster has better wrestlers. The 6 sided ring offers more to a match. I know many WWe fans say that TNA has bad storylines and characters but they have said that about everything that isnt WWE related. TNA and WWE both are lacking in the storyline department. I have not seen an original idea in some time. <br>  <br>  The thing that is exciting about TNA is the rate of thier growth. They are growing so fas it's crazy. You would think that with the bad economy and all that a upstart company like TNA would fail but they are making a killing. Last year alone their revenue quadrupled. They are broadcasting in 130 countries. They are actually beating the WWE in ratings in most of those countries except the in the States. <br>  <br>  TNA is 6 years old, has no debt. Has some of the best young talent in the business and is built to flourish and truly become a contender. They have done this with almost no advertising. Not even the WWE grew this fast. The WWE is 56 years old. TNA is 6 years old. What does this tell you? It tells you people are dying for something other than WWE to watch. Soon TNA will be ready to go head to head with WWE and the Wars will be back on and the business will be even bigger than it was back in the WCW vs WWE days.|`|1WgOj89kaa	NNNNOOOO, i have watched WWE and TNA, and trust me, WWE have the better wrestlers.

A4tps9Klaa	I think her trademark "EXCUSE ME" followed by an enterance theme would be awesome!

Shop both around, and check out the offers you receive.|`|HbTC1BBIaa	depends on how good of a pitcher you want. broxton will probably have toi be packaged with some other guy for you to get a good value, where soria can probably get yuo someone good by himself.<br>  <br>  i personally would try and shop off broxton. inconsistent|`|L17g2h7Naa	Soria has bad pitching sometimes. Broxton is very good. So keep Broxton but trade Soria|`|MGVaHFwgaa	You'll catch more flies with honey. Soria will fetch a better starting pitcher than Broxton|`|69BwydjVaa	Trade Soria, he is on a worse team.

But Tendulkar does play long innings quite often. And physical qualities vary for each individual.|`|9Ze9pFX6aa	What do you expect??<br>  Sanath,a player who is not a part of the team of that form of the game which requires the max. stamina,that is,tests,should advice the God of Batting??|`|AQrjyQZzaa	no little master knows better what is best to do at what time, if he cant sort out this individually,  then he will take his wife's advice.|`|i8QoeiNyaa	Yea Sanath should share some fitness tips with the batting maestro.|`|Qr9UFnIuaa	To be frank, comparing the age b/w Sanath and Sachin is not fair. Santh is completely a different kind of player compared to Sachin. He is most like a dashing kind of batsman and the time he spend at the crease is less than Sachin. Also consider the number of years Sachin has been playing. Compare their careers as an openers, Sachin is 3 years more experienced than Sanath. Having said that need to Praise Sanath for his fitness.|`|29mCE3V7aa	nobody can advise sachin only he should rectify his mistakes|`|558ff4ba8e7d33a8220d4cc8b1701f56aa	Nothing could help sachin and he knows what to do!!|`|3QUAl4cVaa	ahh ahha ahhh...stupid man!!italy 4 ever!|`|iDmjwU26aa	no..........

R0NfdgzLaa	i've been watching the women's world cup (so have you i'm guessing) and even the female commentators are saying "batsman".  i've also heard them say "twelfth man" and "fieldsman".  one of the female commentators jokingly chastised wasim akram for using 'manly' terms, although now all commentators seem to use them.  it's common sense, really.|`|fsLMFIpgaa	I never thought about that before, but I guess they would follow tradition & call them batsmen. Good Q|`|M8XmhqIhaa	I don't think its right to call them 'Batsmen'. Batswoman would be the right thing to call them. But I've got no idea.|`|im8xN545aa	Batsman or Batswoman are the accepted terms. When I played we were Batsmen though as it's seen as a universal term nowadays rather than gender specific and the term Batswoman is becoming less common.

How about alternatively as "Ms. Batsman."<br>  Thinking of it - we use almost neutral gender for all other positions - such as  -<br>  Fielder<br>  Bowler<br>  Umpire<br>  Wicket Keeper<br>  12th man (what do we call this one - 12th woman?)<br>  Commentator<br>  Cricket fan<br>  So - this makes me think we should have a neutral gender for batsman as well.

GbLz9tVqaa	okay i correct part by part you should walk to the park then stretch secondly i think yiu might be a beginner but you should have smaller breaks between the runs, i used to jog/run for 5-10mins then take a 2-3mins walking break. You also shouldnt drink water in between the jog unless you're extremely exhausted. <br>  <br>  You should also make your routine more harder unless it already is if it is (make it more intense)- ive taken that piece of advice and every time i ran i challenged myself and i saw more result in shorter time.
4gZYucHMaa	It takes time to build up. Be sure to be stretching them out before and after a workout and drink plenty of water thru out the day. But it really takes time to build up and get to a ''comfortable'' level of running. When I first started I coudn't make past 10 mins for about 3 months and then suddenly it just hit and I've never looked back.|`|264GS7s7aa	I would stretch more.  It may be because you arent used to running.|`|a3a7bf4984b76fafcf772b15ba32eb00aa	I'm probably the worst person to answer this cus I don't run, am on my feet all day at work and I hate exercise! But from what I've learned from friends that DO run, I would say you might want to start with stretching exercises and warm ups before you hit the road. And cooling off after a run is important [so I've heard!] 'Walking it off' is a phrase my friends that do running say...Good luck to you!|`|xXDkTJcWaa	You could just be getting cramps from lack of oxygen. Try when you run breathe in through your nose and out through your mouth. Keep water handy so if you feel it coming to drink it! If you start having the pain put your hands on your head and if you need put a little pressure on where it hurts. IT should go away. You also may wanna just take your time building up the time you can run!<br>  Hope this helps and good luck!|`|Z57NgmxHaa	run faster

It works plus re-work what you eat-you have to eat less!|`|Jr9j5f6naa	you hate it because you're not good at it, I'm guessing? the only way to get better at it is to work on it. <br>  <br>  but if you really refuse, swimming is great, and it's a whole lot better on your joints and bones than any other sport. it's also a great cardio work out. but I really would suggest running every now and then, or even just fast walking.<br>  <br>  **EDIT: the lady above me is wrong about the eating less part. eating less isn't going to nesiscarily make you loose weight. if you don't eat enough, you won't have enough energy to work out and loose weight. and you might have heard this before, but not eating actually makes your body go into 'hibernation' mode, and so it holds onto every calorie and ounce of fat that it can.

Move yourself as far from the confrontation as quickly as possible.|`|65PS8shGaa	take them down|`|BLWxEdrMaa	I have to agree with the answer to go for the nose.  Hit as fast as you can and as hard as you can the head every time it's possible.  Don't stop with one strike, if you can manage several.  Strike eyes and nose as much as possible, and move out of the enemy's line of sight as often as you can.  Blindsiding is important, and avoiding their grabs or lunges is also important.  The more often you can strike upward the more effective you strikes will be, and aim for the center of the head, as if a pole existed through it from the neck for maximum effect.<br>  <br>  However, there is no one good answer for this one except for one I've seen several times already - don't get yourself into the situation in the first place.  Avoid places where you may end up in a fight situation if you can, and walk away or run if you can't walk as often as possible.<br>  <br>  The consequence for running is someone may think you're chicken.  Oh, well.  The consequence for messing up a guy's face could be jail time.  The consequence for killing a man could be life in prison or even execution.  The consequence for failing to defend yourself well enough is anything from being beaten badly to being killed yourself.

6LMeXaTeaa	If there is a team that gets berkman, mcann, and dunn, they are LUCKY!:) Harang did not have a good year last year, Napoli is average, and Zambrano is either good or bad, no inbetween. Hope this helps!:)|`|4SKmjYrsaa	awful trade! Whoever gettin Berk McCann Dunn wins HUGE i'm in 4 expert leagues right now and Napoli if a free agent in 3 of them, McCann is the best fantasy catcher there is! Berkman is a top 5 first baseman, Dunn k's a lot but hits bombs and walks a lot so his OBP is amazing! Zambrano is set for a down year unfortunately and Harang was miserable last yr! maybe a good comeback yr???   maybe not|`|3XLEQQI6aa	which side do u get?<br>  If you get berkman mcann and adam dunn, yes<br>  If you get zambrano harang and mike napoil, no because a catcher is important and napoil isnt good, plus zambrano is alway hot or cold.

Mambo music was invented in 1930s Havana by Cachao and his contemporaries and made popular around the world by Perez Prado and Beny Moré.

Keep up the good work.|`|N8wNmQShaa	There are literally hundreds of things to do here in LA. Here is my list of “must sees”. Visit as many as you have time for.:<br>  <br>  Disneyland: The Happiest Place on Earth. Half a billion visitors can’t be wrong. #1 Destination in SoCal.<br>  Universal Studios: A theme park that grew out of a studio tour. #2 Destination<br>  Even if you don’t visit Disneyland or Universal Studios Tour, Downtown Disney District and Universal City Walk are very fun places to visit for shopping and eating. And they’re free to visit. <br>  <br>  Hollywood: Enjoy the Walk of Fame, Entertainment Museum, Chinese Theater and more. You can see a lot for free. The Hollywood & Highland complex is AMAZING. It has lots of shops and restaurants, and the Kodak Theater (home of the Academy Awards). I also like the El Capitan theater, right across the street. And the Hollywood Bowl is a GREAT place to listen to concerts outdoors. <br>  <br>  Rodeo Drive, 90210: Packed with exclusive shops, full of gawkers. They all came to enjoy the excess. Free, unless you intend to buy something.<br>  <br>  Venice Beach: Los Angeles kitsch and over-the-top culture at its best. Here you'll find Muscle Beach, street performers and tacky shops galore. Fun, VERY interesting, but I avoid it after dark, when it gets a little TOO interesting for my taste. <br>  <br>  Santa Monica Beach and Pier: Great beach scene and a classic seaside amusement park, complete with antique carousel that has been in a lot of TV and movies. <br>  <br>  Santa Monica Third Street Promenade - Downtown Santa Monica's shopping promenade is often the scene of movie star-sightings. <br>  <br>  Sunset Boulevard: Perhaps one of the world's most famous streets, it began as a route between the stars' posh neighborhoods and the Hollywood studios. It runs from downtown to the ocean, passing through the "Sunset Strip" on its way. It makes for a fun drive. When you get to the ocean, stop at Gladstone's for Fish.<br>  <br>  Queen Mary: Once the largest ship afloat, she's been docked in Long Beach for longer than she sailed, and her elegance never fails to impress. Free to visit. You can actually stay on board, for a price.<br>  <br>  Farmers Market and The Grove - A new shopping complex right next to a Los Angeles landmark, The Grove and Farmers Market coexist. Enjoy a movie or shopping, and then take the trolley to the Farmers Market for lunch or dinner. It is right next to CBS, so walk across the lot to see if they are taping "The Price is Right". You might even get in.<br>  <br>  TAAB: The Americana at Brand- The newly opened TAAB, developed by the same group that gave us The Grove, breathes new life into Glendale, and gives all those hip people in Eagle Rock and the eastern half of LA a great place to go. <br>  <br>  Griffith Park - Home of the Los Angeles Zoo, Griffith Park Observatory, Travel Town, the Greek Theatre, and Gene Autry Museum of Western Heritage.<br>  <br>  Getty Museum - The Getty's architecture is so beautiful that it keeps me fascinated. No matter whether you like their art or architecture better (or maybe you'll just enjoy the view), the Getty is sure to please. Free.<br>  <br>  Attend a TV taping - You can get free tickets at audiencesunlimited.com, tvtix.com, or see the booth at Universal City walk. It's very interesting to see a show being taped. The most popular, by far, is the Tonight show with Jay Leno. Check the NBC web site for all the details there.<br>  <br>  Places to eat:<br>  If you're from Texas, I wouldn't go to a steakhouse here. You'll only be disappointed. However, LA is the home of the hamburger, as evidenced by two listings below. Also, you want to find a goo local Mexican food restaurant, since we have great Mexican food here (and Taco Bell is NOT Mexican food). <br>  <br>  In-N-Out Burger: Multiple locations, best burger in LA, ask anyone.<br>  Pink’s Hot Dogs: 709 N. La Brea, just north of Melrose. You might even see a celebrity. Maybe.<br>  Tommy’s Chili Burgers: Look for the shack, an LA tradition. The original location is at Beverly & Rampart, a couple miles west of downtown.<br>  Canter’s Deli: 419 N. Fairfax, between Beverly & Melrose. Near CBS, you might spot a celebrity.<br>  Phillippe’s: 1001 N. Alameda. Great roast beef sandwiches. Near Union Station and Olvera Street. Watch the mustard, it’s hot.<br>  The Pantry: Corner of Figueroa and 9th, downtown. Huge portions, they never close, GREAT steak and eggs.<br>  <br>  Places to Stay:<br>  Since LA is so spread out, there is no single place that is close to EVERYTHING. Most people who come here tend to stay in Hollywood, Santa Monica, or Anaheim.<br>  In Hollywood, I recommend the Renaissance Hotel at Hollywood and Highland, the Best Western Sunset Plaza, or the Holiday Inn Walk of Fame. <br>  In Santa Monica, the Holiday Inn Santa Monica is close to the pier and reasonably priced.<br>  In Anaheim, I recommend the Howard Johnson (HoJo) Anaheim, and the Candy Cane Inn.<br>  <br>  No, A-Rod should not be banned from baseball.|`|denyKCABaa	-b +/- sqrt(b^2-4ac) / 2a|`|AA10466579	Rajinikanth (Tamil: ???????????; Kannada: ?????????; Marathi: ????????) (born Shivaji Rao Gaekwad on December 12, 1950 in Bangalore, Karnataka, India)[2][1] is an Indian film actor and one of the most influential and bankable movie stars in Indian cinema. Rajinikanth's mass popularity and appeal is largely drawn from his mannerisms and stylized delivery of dialogue. He received India's third highest honour, the Padma Bhushan, for his contribution to Indian cinema.[3] Apart from his film career, he is a well known philanthropist and also serves as a notable influence in the politics of Tamil Nadu. Other than acting, Rajinikanth worked as a screenwriter, film producer, and also a playback singer.<br>  <br>  Popularily referred to and credited in films as "Superstar" and often called as thalaivar (meaning leader in Tamil), Rajinikanth debuted as an actor in 1975 under the direction of K. Balachander in supporting roles. He was later favored in portraying antagonistic characters and gradually rose to acting in lead roles. Being a well known film artist to several regional film industries of India, he also appeared in the cinemas of other nations, including American cinema. He was reportedly paid Rs. 26 crore (about $5.3 million USD as of January 2009) for his latest blockbuster Sivaji: The Boss,[4] making him the highest paid actor in Asia after Jackie Chan.[5]|`|AG3Ix2qmaa	I'm not sure what's up with the other answers, besides the last one.

d06cab42016bd85292d8c35998cc1551aa	Get a clue Paco.   If someone says they think Jr is overrated, then they will be the most attacked person on here. Period.   When Kyle Busch spun out Jr, The tracks were covered with trash from Jr Nation everytime Kyle took the lead in a race.  Bad thing is, Kyle was going to pass Jr anyway in the next 2 laps before he made contact with Jr....he was definitely gaining ground, and Jr was definitely trying to block him.   I was watching the Yahoo live chat during the Vegas race, and when someone asked the moderators how they thought Jr would finish, and Jay Hart said "maybe in the top ten" he was instantly accused of being a Jr hater, by several posters.   And They don't even show a tenth of the posts.   Several Jr fans said they wouldn't be back in that chat....all because A professional journalist said Jr wouldn't win.    And for the record, Jr finished 10th in that race, so Hart was absolutely correct in what he said.   But he was turned into a bad guy for giving his professional opinion.   <br>  Don't try to say that Jr nation isn't every bit as guilty of keeping the rants going as everyone else.   its a 2 way street.  If you want it to end quit answering questions that relate to Jr in ways you don't like.|`|63e6fbd5b85357a27d660c7d5c0b9ee9aa	there is some drivers i completely despise .. i rant for a bit then its over|`|mIdcJEJNaa	He pains them, and I love that..<br>  I just read a "resolved" question that talked about Sr..<br>  Some possibly six year old, said the only driver they<br>  would compare to Sr would be Kyle Busch.. rotflmao <br>  Why don't we just give him the Cup, and maybe they'll<br>  (some, not all of his fans) will go away..<br>  The same kind of thinking seems to affect them all..<br>  The world didn't exist before they discovered it..|`|YHYT8qMKaa	I definitely agree with you. I don't hate him, so I don't have any reason to complain. I can understand why his fans get upset if he gets insulted. But that happens to anyone that is famous. Kyle Busch seems to like getting boos. Jeff Gordon said that getting boos is better than getting no attention at all. I don't get upset when people insult my favorite. I think everyone needs to just move on.|`|aRy2ZvT9aa	Yes I am but, theres freedom of speech in this country. So I do not see the haters and doubters ever stoping. Heck if he wins 5 races this yr they will rant and complain. I just ignore it.<br>  <br>  Go Dale Jr & Hms|`|XNdDrXAzaa	I like when people talk about Junior. <br>  Good or bad.<br>  I'm amazed by peoples fascination with the guy.<br>  I think it's fun.<br>  I like Junior fans.<br>  They're kicks!|`|45808d8ed5ebcfa6c92967923af9943eaa	The reason there are so many haters is because he is popular with the fans. I myself do not know why or will I second guess their chioce. I will admit that I do not like the TV coverage that he gets and all the hype that is put on for him but I understand it is for the TV audience and there are a lot of fans. Don't say I am Jealous that is also a comment that I see a lot on here it only promotes more hate. I tend to dislike him because he has never shown why he has so many fans. He is not good looking and is a jerk on the radio to his crew He has no championships in Sprint cup and I undersand that he won some busch championships,but if he were in the busch series now he would go no where with all the cup guys coming in running the busch series. The cup guys dominate the busch series and it is boring to watch a young star trying to make it against these guys. It is like a major league baseball player going to the minors to beat up on them. But questions like this only support people to add their hate mail, to them it is like a invite. I can sure see both sides of this tale though|`|864ff4f1d2bae073545b71e755caf090aa	Hate is a hard word to use..in my opinion the Jr. Nation created a lot of this mess. - put on a terrible display of sportsmanship with the beer throwing, then all the negative print here on yahoo about Jeff Gordon, a fine person and a great driver..if your driver can't run constantly with the big boys, no need to get upset..the last race I attended, my 6 yr old son and I got drenched with stale beer..so never again..at first NASCAR seemed to welcome all the debris thrown in hate..good luck to Junior, and I don't think he really appreciated the debris thrown at Jeff..and Kyle.I still have the video, and it is unbelievelable to watch..all the drivers put their lives on the line for our enjoyment..we should all be more respectful, me included..|`|i8soZLfRaa	I'm sick and tired of both the Jr uber fanatics & the haters. You are free to like, dislike or be neutral about him (like I am). I have a different favorite, and naturally I promote and pull for him, but I'm not out there hating on anyone that doesn't see it my way. I have my favorite, you have yours, and we all watch at the same time to see what happens. When the race is over, most of us cheer or say aw shucks, and look forward to the next race to do it all over again.|`|50e3b0849b4360114052f91433a42927aa	you know i cant stand Rowdy Bush,i will vent for a little while and then i am done.some people just dont know when to let it go.they cary on and on about one paticular incident,something said or done.<br>  <br>  but hey i totally agree with u about it.there will be alot of questions on here about the same thing..........this about him that about him.........it does get old|`|BD78ZzYkaa	Truthfully yes I am.

50e3b0849b4360114052f91433a42927aa	hey check out the folloeing link,ther is alot of info....................................... right-front camber change is a little different. We can design our car so that the right-front camber does not change after dive and roll. This is actually exactly what that tire wants for most short-track applications. The reason for this is that as we enter the turn, the right-front tire takes a set fairly quickly. If the camber continues to change after that initial set, then the tire will give up traction and the car will usually push.|`|XNdDrXAzaa	Camber is increased as banking is increased.

BLWxEdrMaa	I'm afraid I must agree with the one who says definitely call the police.  You need to involve them immediately.  Even if the guy catches you, you'll at least have a report in place, and he won't get ahold of you for a second go if he does hurt you once.<br>  <br>  Secondly, you don't have much of a chance if you have no fighting training.  If you were near me, I would help you by coaching you.  I'm in East Tennessee.  If not, I'd say if he catches you there will be a lot of pain and possible permanent injuries.  Do not let him catch you, simply put.  Running is your best bet if you see him.<br>  <br>  Now, if you have reported these things to the police, avoided him to the best of your ability, but he still catches you, here's a tip from the Navy Seals:<br>  <br>  Aim for his head, continue hitting his head all you can, possibly even stomping his ankles if you get the chance.  Everyone tries for groin shots, and sure - sometimes they work for you, but often they only anger your opponent.  Chances are you had better try and talk your way out of it, and if you think he's going to attack anyway, go for the eyes immediately, also striking the nose if you can.  Back away and keep distance as much as you are able, especially if he's hurt.  If he gets distracted enough, make a break for it and call the police again - and report that you were attacked and defended yourself to the best of your ability - and that you are being pursued at the moment.  Tell police to meet you somewhere further than where you left him, hang up and run there.  You really need caution as much as possible here.<br>  <br>  Grandmaster David A.

If it does come down to a fight, then aim for the weak parts of the body like the groin and eyes and also try use what may be in your environment as an improvised weapon such as a chair maybe.  It's not a boxing match, no rules, just do what's necessary.|`|DeLBm2V4aa	ur gonna die especially if he actually does know muy thai and ju-jitsu...move to a different state.|`|ECRILCiOaa	Dude, screw these other people and listen to me. First off, do you have ANY experience in fighting? Since he trains in bjj and muay thai, he is going to want to get up close to you so he can put his hands on you to throw elbows or to take you down. THis is were you need to not let him get. As long as he is in your kicking distance and not in your punching distance than your good. Use kicks to keep him back. Roundhouse followed by a punch to his face. Basically, once u start, dont stop until he is totally spent and can go anymore/ask you to stop. Its always best to avoid these fights, but if you cant explain it to him(which this seems like the case), then you need to protect yourself. Besides, he isnt a pro in any of those styles, he has only been training for 2 yrs.|`|Piflb3QBaa	I'm assuming you have no training in fighting.  You will get your butt whipped.  Here is how I see it going down.  He uses the muay thai to cut your face open with some sharp elbows, then probably some knees to the gut.<br>  <br>  If you some how use your size to get in close to avoid the muay thai, then you are in more trouble.  The entire point of BJJ is to neutralize a larger opponent by controlling their body and then breaking their limbs.<br>  <br>  Wacth any Royce Gracie(BJJ god) fight on youtube from back in the day.

Take a pipe wrench with you, have him approach you, then Ko' his a$$ out.

He was found ill and running a fever on April 5, 1932, and died. The officicial cause of death was colic, but tests revealed the presence of arsenic in his system. The arsenic source was found to be from a nearby field sprayed, and spread by the wind into his paddock. <br>  <br>  <a href="http://museumvictoria.com.au/pharlap/museum/mn007397.asp?URL=http://www.museum.vic.gov.au/pharlap/museum/index.asp" rel="nofollow">http://museumvictoria.com.au/pharlap/mus...</a>

So I'm a sophomore at my high school and started playing tennis about my 7th grade year. Freshman year I posted a question similar to this because i wanted tips on how to make varsity. Well I did and played at #6 for a good school in SoCal (best division in the U.S) and my team this year won our whole division. So take this next bit of advice to heart.<br>  If you haven't played tennis, you can't play tennis. I know that sounds harsh but hear me out, tennis takes time and lots of practice, it's one of the hardest sports there is. Practice, practice, practice. You said you were going to hit a with a friend, i recommend doing it a lot. Be the first one on the courts and the last one to leave. make the coaches think your a coachable kid and show them how much you can improve and listen to what they have to say. ask other players if they want to hit with you over the weekend and maybe see if there are any tennis clinics you can try around your town. Chances are by the end of the season you will be playing much, much better and will still have a LOT of fun. also something I have learned.... sports like football or basketball you stop playing seriously during high school unless your going to play in college and few make it big. Tennis you can play your ENTIRE life!! If you ever goto a tennis club there probably old men playing doubles together and still having a blast! You have your whole life to play tennis and you will grow to be more and more experienced.<br>  hope that helps|`|t4BqZx0paa	well u say u know a bit bout tennis? first of all, pros like i see on tv do their forehand and backhand swing *perfect* so try to get the steps and remember to always balance.... for forehand step with urleft foot ( i think) and backhand with right foot. also when ur serving, make sure the racket is on ur back like a backscratcher and ur arm follows. hope this helps at least a bit. remember that practice makes perfect :D

0da6ab3c6b462dc6d34ee0177bdc0459aa	Gatorade will help, but if you notice boxer mostly use water.  But Sarah is right not much to say, about offensive tips and defensive since your fight is tomorrow.  Just remember to focus on your shots, don't flinch and do fakes.  Remember to step in each hit and don't lean forward or reach to hit opponent. For the breathing part, Sarah is right, don't breath with your mouth or breath out too much air.  Short breath out each hit but don't breath too much in either.  Breath with your nose. #2 tip is don't tense you whole arm per hit, this is how most fighter loose there energy and endurance, let you hands go and only compress your knuckles during impact.|`|KR9bjky2aa	I know this is a typical answer.. but I recmend putting some ice on it :) it usually is the best remedie.. And some tipes i can give..(dont forget im not an amazing boxer) is to just breathe slowly. i know it sounds stupid but it helpss alot! just concentrate on the breathing and you should be fine. breathe in through your nose and out through the mouth. Just try pracitcing your breathing techneaques. For the defensive and offenseive im so sorry but im not reallyy sure what to say. All i know is that if you stay focused you will have a good chance of winning... well i hope this hels alitle...byee!!

4ngAA7IUaa	I wear over the boot tights so my laces don't catch on the hooks and trip me up|`|dCvZXtMOaa	When skaters skate, their skates end up getting beat up.  If you look at my skates, they are covered in scuffs, dents, and scratches.  When I compete or am in a show- I wear what are called 'over the boot tights' so you can't see my skates.  It just gives a cleaner look so you aren't' distracted from the skating.|`|PNFnZGrpaa	There are countless reasons why skaters wear tights over their boots.  Here is why I like to wear them:<br>  1. They tend to be a bit warmer, because the space between the ankle and the boot is covered.<br>  2. Most competitive skaters have completely beat-up skates, and they help keep the skates a bit more “alive”.<br>  3. In competition, I like to wear them because I wear them for practice.<br>  4. They help keep the laces from becoming undone.  Many high-level skaters only tie their laces with a single knot at the top, so that they can easily untie the skate in case they need to retie them (in competition, some skaters only have about three minutes to fix their skates.  They can’t waste all their time trying to untie the knot).<br>  5. For some people (including me), they help the legs look a bit more elongated.<br>  <br>  That is all I can think of right now.  I hope that helps with your daughter’s assignment!!!|`|akA3oJx6aa	They don't really keep you warm since they're thin, but they're just for looks. In competitions and tests, judges judge how well you present yourself to them. It's a sign of respect. We also wear them if our skates are scratched up and such, but as I said, it doesn't really protect it, it just makes an impression on the judges.|`|S5fJrwGkaa	1) elongates the legs <br>  2) hide scuffed up skates for competitions<br>  3) preference for practice w/skirt<br>  4) protects leather from moisture and dirt<br>  5) fashion<br>  6) requirement for testing/competitions<br>  7) show off skirts<br>  8) for fun|`|lK4dOcjJaa	It makes your legs look sleek and good.

THe only other GM that has done something really good is Houstan's, signing Artest and getting rid of Alston so he could start Brooks and trade for Lowry.<br>  <br>  I mean wow... Mo for Damon.  Cancer for probable championship.  It's great.|`|1Z0Lmrk1aa	He's been playing great all year. Its the market he plays that's causing it.|`|kjtF4kjjaa	What a season for Mo and the Cavs...Ok Lebron is great and probably the stats of Mo are so good thanks to his presence, but Williams is making the difference between a first round team and a contender...give him to D-Wade and i beg that Miami can compete too...good job Mo and especially Danny Ferry that makes a great deal|`|P93I8CHtaa	i think he should get the executive,he led this team from being great to one of the best in the east,with all those moves he did,he has to get that|`|ZFTkBTvvaa	yah, that guy needs to be traded because right now people think he is the guy lebron passes to when he cant get open.|`|YQLNqgnWaa	yah, he will be the go to guy besides lebron|`|6Efhd6lNaa	62% is just insane...<br>  <br>  You're right he doesn't get enough credit.

But Ferry should definitely be in the running.|`|QtPdrKfuaa	The PG that Cleveland has wanted for so long.  Mo deserved to be an all star when the coaches picked and i couldn't believed when he was almost snubbed.

Joe Smith really wanted to come back to Cleveland anyway.|`|AA11605074	definitely!

Let Him Make a random Unannounced Return.<br>  Christian is Gonna Win the ECW Championship Anyway...|`|rseD4OG2aa	I would much rather see Kennedy in Money in the Bank than Christian. I'm a big Christian fan as well, but between the two of them, Kennedy is my favorite by far. He's one of the the most talented, and underutilized, stars in professional wrestling. <br>  I don't think that Christian will compete in Money in the Bank this year, he'll probably have something to do with the ECW Championship at Wrestlemania. Jack Swagger against Finlay wouldn't be a good sell on such a big stage, so they have to have Christian involved somehow to boost credibility.<br>  As for Kennedy, I have no idea where he's going to fit in. I kind of think he'll be transferred to ECW at this year's draft, but as for Wrestlemania, if he's back in time, Money in the Bank is a good bet. I don't think he'll win it, MVP is the front runner right now, it's just to early for him to get such a huge win so early on after an injury. Before Kennedy gets a major push, he needs to re-establish his credibility with the fans. I'm a little worried they'll forget about him after such a long time.|`|a45ffb40e1ff08eda37fb35f65c6eecaaa	they have one ecw guy 3 raw guys (CM Punk Kane and either Kofi or Jericho, though it probably would be Kofi) 3 Smackdown guys (MVP Finlay, this week, and Shelton benjamin) and 1 ecw guy (Mizzark Henry) so id LIKE to see Christian, i could go either way on kennedy or Christian though|`|SJJEF5Vyaa	I hope Kennedy, he needs it more, and i wanna see a title run from him.<br>  Christan should win another one like you said, but this time Kennedy should get this.<br>  He would have 2 wins in the MITB.|`|lGIL36faaa	i think christian wud win coz he is more talented not that kennedy isn't but christian is a little bit more talnted and he has more charisma and is more athletic....<br>  <br>  i wud like 2 see christian win|`|GJ9z6K1Baa	both ...but kennedy deserves it..injury bug always seems to haunt him when his push comes around so <br>  <br>  KENNEDY!!!!<br>  <br>  <br>  KENNEDYYYY!!!|`|lRrsdvJdaa	Mr. Kennedy|`|qWNcOhJJaa	Mr. Kennedy.  If Christian was going to get respect in the WWE, then he would not have debuted on ECW|`|rt8E2JhKaa	That would be a cool match.Two great wrestlers fight in the same ring. I would say Mr. Kennedy would win because deserves it more. Christian has just returned and is looking after the ECW title. Also, i don't think that Vince would let the Winner of the MITB to go after a not such important belt in the WWE like the ECW, (not saying its bad either) but i think that he would like them go after the WWE or World Heavyweight Championship.|`|b7JS16dyaa	This match could go either way, but I think management would let Kennedy win over Christian, because they've shown that they like to push the latter much more.<br>  <br>  Kennedy's defeated: Batista, Rey Mysterio, Undertaker, Shawn Michaels, Chris Benoit, Booker T, etc. I think he could beat Christian...<br>  <br>  They've been making Christian job to a newcomer like Jack Sawgger. Don't get me wrong, Jack is good, but WWE usually likes to put Christian down. Hence why he left for TNA.|`|AA12394248	well since christian is going to smackdown in the draft and kennedy is not coming back till after wm25. this match well never happen but if it did happen i would say MRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRR. KENNEDY.............KENNEDY   but if christian where in mitb he would win most likely for 2 reasons. one its a ladder match and two he only started off on ecw because every one was expecting  it was him that attacked jeff hardy. so vince made it matt as a surprise. other wise he would be on smackdown now getting a push. instead of ecw losing to jack swagger.|`|wum4X78maa	I have to go with Kennedy because Christian is in a storyline for the ECW Championship right now.

She should have gotten so much more. She should have had just as many, if not more title reigns than Trish. Trish was great, but so was Victoria. Victoria had a lot of talent and it wasn't used the proper way. She should have had a nice send off. She should have been the first Woman's Diva Champ, or at least took it from McCool and did something great with that Title. If she had it, even for just a little while...that title would have so much more meaning. She should have been the leader of all of the Diva's (so to speak). Like a Taker of the Diva's.

I think starting out he won't be as good as a player but he will accomplish great in Boston. I think that it won't be a negative experience and him playing might make the team better and get the team more aside a few bad trade offs. One thing that would kill him in Boston is if he has bad team chemistry, because without a good chemistry with the team he won't accomplish much and won't get much playing time. The second thing that could affect him is that he always wants his way and in Boston that isn't going to fly like it did in New York. <br>  <br>  Overall we don't know how good it will make him or change him or the Celtics. He could change the Celtics and make them better but he could just ruin there chemistry by being a big pull down to the team.|`|50PfC3OIaa	I thin he'll do alright. He'll be a good back up and can occasionally fill it up, He just has to be a good locker room guy, and understand he's not the star of the team. He has to be a real team player.|`|tP1CwcWoaa	It will make celtics better!<br>  Marbury will be useful down the stretch.. being a clutch shooter..<br>  And his experience as a point guard in the league can be useful to teach rondo and so on.<br>  <br>  Anyways, Lakers also has Gasol, Odom who are really Good.|`|I71ePk4Haa	He's only going to see limited time anyway...like Cassell last year. He might play a little bit more in the short term because of injuries, but he won't get much court time in the playoffs.|`|Ysj10nVTaa	He will do something stupid off the court and get suspended.|`|0Bxmxirsaa	who cares BOSTON SUCKS<br>  <br>  we will kill em in the finals! <br>  <br>  LAKERS RULE!

k96aZXY2aa	at Iowa State you need to be a level 10 or higher, I think that is pretty common for most schools. But you could always focus on 1 event and then try to walk-on the team when you get there.|`|3k2NjOWsaa	College is generally a very high level 9 and up to elite level girls.  For example take Georgia.  They have Courtney Kupets and she went to worlds!! and her sister Ashley did gymnastics there last year.  To tell you the truth, collegiate gymnastics is very tough to make it.  but, you can set a goal and hopefully accomplish it!!
7nDpz7vyaa	I rolled out of bed at 8:30 last night and watched the 2nd half.  The Hawks played great.  JJ was awesome.

AA11605074	its not that he is a great pitcher, its that he is a great knuckleballer. you almost have to put them in 2 different categoies. he throws a fastball in the low 70's which is like high school level, but that "knucklah" is so strange to batters that if they arent used to it, it totally throws them off. the only problem with that is because the knuckle has no spin to it, its very hard to pinpoint a location to throw to, so if its a windy day or something like that his control wont be as great. but he can probably pitch into his mid-40's cuz its not like he's ever gonna throw out his arm. he's like Tom Candiotti. Wakefield is a decent pitcher, and a good knuckler. its hard to be consistent as a knuckleball pitcher|`|kmysJBb4aa	Depends who he's facing. The Yankees and Angels and most teams who see him often light him up. His change up and knuckleball are still some of the better ones in the game, but because he doesn't have anything resembling a power arm anymore he can't fool anyone. He is an  average pitcher but on the steep decline|`|tFK2gI8Saa	No i do not think wakefield is a good pitcher, the only thing good about him is with that knuckle ball he can pitch more then other guys, so you can bring him into the game in a critical moment even if he pitched a few games before, and because normally people can't hit the knuckle the first time they see it that game he can get some outs, until of coarse aron boon hits a home run...|`|UAdBIO8Gaa	depends. i would take him on a late pick because he is a good .500 pitcher|`|iPWKzzQtaa	He is a good pitcher, but at 42 you can't expect any upside. His biggesr advantage is an element of suprise, after a team faces Lester, Dice K and Beckett, they are confused by the slow delivery.<br>  <br>  This time I don't think he will win 15...he got only 10 last year. Despite being a 5th starter, he might not get as many starts as you expect.<br>  <br>  This will probably be his last year and I see it as a reward for loyal service. As he's a New England native, he's not going to go elsewhere.|`|kGXU1Dotaa	He was in his day not anymore.|`|AA11588942	Really, he is average. As a Sox fan, I cringe everytime he pitches a game. Last year he had 10 wins and 11 losses, which isn't horrible, just average. For sure, over the years he has done well. But personally, I think his career is almost over. I would chose Dice-K, Lester, Beckett, Sabathia, Peavey, etc. over Wakefield.<br>  <br>  So, for a fantasy team? No. For the Red Sox? Sure, keep him another year or two.|`|1653f4ba4264154cda51126bd5ac4bb1aa	Anything that can get the captain a day off every once in a while is a good thing. I think the Red Sox having Wakefield has extended Varitek's career by seasons not just games! If he can pull out some wins at the same time, Even Better...|`|Fx2lB9LYaa	he is a dinosaur but knuckleballer can pitch for yrs look up hoyt willeham i think he pitched from 1948 to 1972 some yrs a knuckleballer can have a great yr other yrs they can have a not so good yr its just the way they are tricky pitch|`|3mZyMnjfaa	yeah about 30 years ago he is old and i wouldn't waste a pick on him

Do that until it's easy and then start picking up the pace. When you get faster, make sure you run for the same amount of time.|`|J7k4xJtoaa	just start slow and do a jog and every time increase the time and speed you will build endurance|`|utsBDoffaa	just keep running|`|nOU8WvmDaa	Do yo have to stop because your legs give out or because your winded? If you cant catch your breath then sprints can help on that but if your legs get tired then jog more...<br>  <br>  Try and run a reasonable distance 2-3 times a week if you get tired after 15 minutes then jog around 12 minutes then next time jog a little more

What happens when Sting retires then Booker leaves, then Nash leaves to have his retirement. then Angle finally decides to hang up the boots.

I don't go freshwater too often (and to be honest, when I do, I'd rather bring home a few softshell turtles than bass) but when I do go freshwater fishing, I always take a pack of Senkos, won't say I never get skunked, but when the fish won't bite, the turtles usually will. Mmmmm....<br>  <br>  <br>  Bonus: Watermelon/Green, gotta agree
BK1GjPT6aa	In my area, the pumpkin seed lizard. It's like candy (fresh water.) The Hank brown's hook up jig head with a live shrimp ( saltwater)  Straight lined. <br>  <br>  The first lure...dang, son, you brought back a memory I almost forgot.  The first lure I can remember was a shoe string. My dad took my shoe string, cut it down and added a split shot and a hook. We actually caught fish using this and we caught some big bass while fishing a canal that was pumping water right out of a fish camp on highway 27. Man, I'm getting teary eyed here because I remember that my dad would improvise and made a popper for me out of a marshmallow and it worked. We didn't have money back then and we did the best we could with what we had. Sad to see that many of today's youth are not equally creative for the better. Those were the best years in my eyes.~good luck catchin'.|`|tFK2gI8Saa	Zara Spook - it walks back and forth, not only does it catch a lot of fish there exciting to catch this way <a href="http://www.basspro.com/webapp/wcs/stores/servlet/Product_10151_-1_10001_2909?cmCat=CROSSSELL_PRODUCT&cmid=PP_P2_2" rel="nofollow">http://www.basspro.com/webapp/wcs/stores...</a><br>  <br>  <br>  also i learned to fish with a old fashion spinner|`|CBTAgeu4aa	7" Berkley power worm, in red shad, texas rigged <br>  <a href="http://www.basspro.com/webapp/wcs/stores/servlet/Product_10151_-1_10001_38256_100007001_100000000_100007000_100-7-1?ordProd=Y&CMID=BOTTOM_selectitems#itemDetail" rel="nofollow">http://www.basspro.com/webapp/wcs/stores...</a><br>  Bonus Q, In-line spinner|`|SEpHGcnKaa	Texas-rigged plastic worms.

Now I cannot say my single best lure and nor can you it all depends on timing where how you fish it etc, but the best lures I have ever used are definately the Kelly Worm, Purple with white stripes and dots.Then I use topwater baits a lot. The best ones I use are definately rubber. You want to buy the packages that come with more that one and the best are usually things like frogs, salamanders, and worms--sometimes--what you want to do is put the hook through them like you would with a Texas Rig so that the hook can only be tooken when bitten on. Mice also work very well. Now you want to cast from the water onto the shore so it does not desturb the shallow large bass. Then you pull it onto the water and you want to start making noise but dont just reel it in. You want to pop it as loudly as you can for a foot or so. Then let it rest like a little animal would. Then you continue doing this you want to let it sit on the water a little bit where there is no lily pads in between because the Bass that are following it will see it slowly going across the water and will destroy it. If they strike your lure when you are still moving it across the lily pads you have to learn to be a little patient. If you immediately try to snap the lure you will simply just pull it out of the way. Its not like on open water the second you see the explosion on the water it means that the lure is probably in the fishes mouth. When fishing lily pads the explosion just means it broke the surface it most likely hasnt even bit the lure wait only like a second after it breaks surface then snap the rod and do not let it run you must keep it with no slack at all times and just keep reeling in trying to pull it above the lily pads or it will succeed in getting away which will happen often until you get used to this type of fishing. I know this is a lot to read but I definately think it should help so good luck.|`|2Aje1yGWaa	tequila sunrise worm. has always worked when other " fad " baits fade out year after year.

It's simply awesome! But many lures such as tube baits or zara spooks, or grub/worm type plastics have always done well.<br>  <br>  Bonus: The in-line spinner on streams and small lakes. I caught one of the biggest bass ever on a spinner fishing it real deep on a lake and hundreds of trout as well.|`|AA11016927	My "go to" lure is a Texas-rigged (no-weight) Berkley worm. You can always catch fish with them. <br>  <br>  The problem? You have to weed through a number of pan-fish to get to the Bass. And no-weight, Texas-rigging, is a SUPER slow way to fish.....which is usually not conducive to tournament fishing....   <br>  <br>  First lure I learned to fish?- 1/8 OZ Beetle Spin, (with a curly-tailed grub body). To this day I still fish this combo and it catches fish. <br>  <br>  At the same time I got my first Hula Popper..........I must have been 7-8 years old....<br>  <br>  Funny, that's all you really need- an 1/8-1/4 OZ Beetle Spin and  some kinda topwater lure- WAIT! WHAT am I SAYING! (lol)  <br>  <br>  Chimp- That Strawberry story was very cool! It's good to have you back in YAnswer's; your story's & answer's are always interesting and fun to read.......Thumbs UP! <br>  <br>  Thumbs UP to Pheasant- I didn't think they had lures when you were a kid PT.

QjS3zl3Yaa	NO NO NO NO NO NO NO<br>  <br>  Never quit what you have started, Track on the first day will seem insane, its normal, really if you did not do anything during winter. The worst thing you can do is quit. Doing track brings you some kind of satisfaction when you compete at an event. I just got home from my first day of practice, and the first thing the coach said after we ran hard was not to give up never give up, it will be hard the first two weeks. You need to shed some weight. If you quit, what will happen? Track will help you shed weight, Track is a Beautiful thing, just cause the first day was not wack crazy fun dont give up. Let me tell you something, giving up will make you a fat loser, Im not trying to be mean, you quit, your friends thinking this coach's maybe, who knows. Trust me you dont want that. Now I understand Track is not for everyone. But give it some time, after like 4 weeks if you dont like it, just go to a coach and say I dont know if track is for me, they will understand. But like I said take a deep thought about it. <br>  Track can be fun great and exciting, along with that comes hard work and motivation.<br>  <br>  Last thing I have to say, Good luck I hope you have a great season.<br>  My main concern is that you read this and take things into thought :)|`|NJUhQn60aa	if it's something you enjoy - then stick with it.<br>  <br>  If you are a beginner - then it will come.  But if weight is a problem, running isn't by itself the solution.  It is a helper.  Work on your diet also.<br>  <br>  A warm-up is exactly that - a warm-up.  I ran successfully in high school and in college.  Many runner "won" the warm-up, so.....  A warm-up is for stretching and getting the kinks out.<br>  <br>  The only way to get better is to give it some time, think big picture and don't expect overnight miracles.  Impossible expectations will give you impossible results.<br>  <br>  I raced for 12 years and am coaching now, and when I started out I was barely on the varsity team of my school, it took years before I got any good.  By my junior year I was #1 on my team and even went on to big successes in college track.  It just takes time.|`|x0qGAZMNaa	Track is really difficult for chubby, people trust me I know (lol).  I didn't do track cause I was too lazy but I would have liked to do some of the other events in it like shotput or discus.  Track and running are two things that automatically go together.  A mile for warm-up Holy Crap!!!  Really you just need to do what you think you want most.  I know I hate when people say that to me too but it is the total truth.  I hate when I can't make up my mind lol.  <br>  <br>  GOOD LUCK!!!! I hope you figure out what you are going to do, sorry I wasn't much help d: | > lol <br>  <br>  P.S. I would probably quit, but that is just me, I probably wouldn't even have started lol (I'm a quiter) :(|`|qAGeCYVlaa	Do it. :]|`|aOxSjCxVaa	fat people shouldn't run for the same reason that black people don't play hockey|`|AIzm7bXEaa	You should do whatever you feel comfortable with but I would stick it out for a week before making your decision, running is always hard to start with and it will be a little more tough if you are on the heavy side but I don't think you will regret because as the season goes on you will get better and it will become easier, and there is the added plus of losing a little weight.|`|l0tKMC50aa	yea|`|WST15Sm5aa	Nooooo, dont quit. It's hard to run a mile for many in-shape people, so you should just stick it out. It will get easier if you push yourself, and if you want to lose weight, this is a great way to do it. My friend is in the same situation as you, and she is doing really well. Stick with it and you will definitely see an improvement!!!|`|GZonOcBhaa	i think u should stay with it. even if u was to have come in last dont worry bout it. :-) believe me it will get sooo much easier for u. even as u lose a few pounds. if u like it im sure u will stick to it and prove urself. who nos? u could go to the olimpics one day!!!|`|yQetxSD0aa	Keep going!<br>  track started for me too today :P<br>  <br>  It will get easier and when you start running the pounds will drop off.<br>  just stick with it, don't give up, take it slow if you want.<br>  It can be gradual but never stop!|`|d385a8d8c7fb7864f805ea62eecdc7caaa	Keep doing track, but switch to field events. - That is the best way to go, you still run some, but not like a normal track runner.

I ran track for 2 years in middle school - i wasn't terrible, but i was no athlete either! I only have good memories from it.

Just practice running and stretching and practice and you could get it soon if you want it enough!<br>  <br>  Good Luck Good Luck|`|3nyoCTBxaa	I like track. But if you don't like it. Then that's your decision. Don't do it. It would be a good excersice though.|`|9Pyzw2Zxaa	Track can get pretty intense, trust me i know! I think its awesome   challenging yourself. I also think that its good that you are trying to keep you're body in better condition, but if you are not enjoying track and you dread doing it, then stop! don't force yourself to do something you don't enyoy. If you don't like track but want to do something physical, try something like swimming, soccer, basketball, ect. there is tons of options besides track, i hope i helped PEACE|`|fac02e73d704362ef8a06b52d3b05b0baa	This all depends. Back in the day when I was in school the runs (from one lap around the track to the full mile) in gym would kill me because I was overweight and extremely out of shape. There's a difference, I know. You could be like I use to be and all I did was sit at home and really only got out of the chair to eat lol or you can be active and still overweight (yes, there is a such thing). <br>  You'll have to ask yourself if you enjoy it. It might be hard but if you do "drop a few pounds" would you find it more enjoyable? If so, stay. They accepted you on the team for a reason!|`|R5ZHTrqUaa	Well i kno wat your going through I started track last week and it is sooo hard. I used to do it in seventh grade so my mom and the coach are like you should do track your fast and crap. <br>  <br>  But my coach is making me hate track the practices is harder than the meet itself.<br>  <br>  I guess cuz i'm on varsity but I really want to quit but my mom's like you need a scholorship and stupid stuff.

I was overweight a at the beginning if the school year and i did a sport(soccer) and lost like 20 stick it out and you will be allot happier with your decision:) :) :) :)|`|dHphG4hxaa	stay :] it would help you alot.<br>  i would stay|`|jLHkM5ijaa	I think you should try it for a week and see how you like it. don't give keep trying|`|7Sa4fkUlaa	If you continue you track you WILL lose the weight. Anyone who insults you here or at school is a jerk so don't care what others think and keep on running. Getting in shape now while you are young will help you the rest of your life. Who knows you could become a world famous marathon runner. Take it from me I was a little chubby when I started track in 7th grade I have dropped 20 pounds since and I run 6 miles a day! I love it! Stick with it and so will you! Good luck and kick butt in the meets!<br>  <br>  Oh, yeah and If you choose to get in shape on your own, you won't. You won't have anyone next to you to push you! It is so much better to have a friend.|`|E4nJBjynaa	I think you should base it on do you have any friends there that you can really hang out with? If you need to lose some weight then you should stay because just think working out at the gym is hard, costs money, and with the food temptations, isnt enough. It is a great way to lose  weight, make friends, and compete.  Competing is fun and stand up for your school!|`|J4CMYwACaa	definitely dont quit, youll be better off if you practice your running, who knows, one day you might run into some person who wants to do some pretty bad stuff to you and unlucky for you youre not in your car, but you decided not to run well look at you now you got caught and now youre in some wackos basement getting some pretty strange stuff done to your dead body.|`|wfKaV6Ooaa	I think you should quit and lose weight on your own.

If you lose a few pounds and exercise more you could even someday be a track star|`|oXnlk1yOaa	running a mile just as a warm up for someone who is just starting would be kinda hard. if its hard for you i would say quit and work at it this year and join again next year.<br>  <br>  but if you think you can do it, an you really need it.<br>  id say do it.<br>  nothing bad can happen.|`|vN6J6nELaa	If you don't like it, don't do it.|`|juWJ47hXaa	Instead of dropping those pounds, why not tone them up by lifting a few weights, and try out for the shot-put, or discus. Everyone, no matter whether they are runners, jumpers, or throwers have to warm up by some distance of jogging, so I wouldn't worry too much about coming in last in a warm-up.|`|5xAu3RAZaa	NO DON'T QUIT<br>  trust me the first week is ALWAYS the worst. ALWAYS. <br>  all they do is conditioning aka running til u puke.<br>  once u get past the first week, it gets soooooo much better.<br>  trust me.<br>  in winter track, the first week we ran 2 miles as a warm up every day along with push ups crunches and abs. after that, we did a light jog around the track and just worked on our events. everyone who quit regreted it.<br>  coaches do this so that all the people who can't handle it leave early, and everyone else has a memorable season. please, dont quit. in two weeks, people will be telling you how less harder it is. once the season is over you DEFINETELY WILL regret it. dont quit, the first week is alwayss the toughest.|`|AwyL5nBuaa	stick with it.<br>  if you say you need to lose pounds then this is the PERFECT opportunity to do it. <br>  watch, at the end of the season, you will be so happy for yourself,.|`|fA42bQHraa	Stick with it, you'll be really happy you did.<br>  <br>  You'll be amazed how much easier it gets by the end of next week.|`|w5GMjQndaa	Its just practice, you'll get better as the season goes on.

Remember, its not about what place you come in, its about how well you do personally, so if its your goal to loose wait, and survive track, then you should do your best to accomplish it, you'll be glad you did.|`|LenfoJSRaa	Here is the deal. You should do it because you need to push yourself, it will teach you not to quit and to be persistent in life. Especially when it comes to loosing weight, things that are worth doing are never easy.  So don't quit now, push yourself as far as you can.<br>  <br>  Then again I never understood why people would choose to run...|`|rP1WwvnVaa	i think you should stick with it for at least a week or two before you decide to quit.  Once you give yourself time to get into shape, you could be an amazing athlete.  You won't know unless you try.<br>  <br>  Plus, there are other events in track (jumping and throwing) that don't require you to be able to run.|`|c0AhQHfQaa	Talk to your coach and tell him that you dong want to race you just want to practice with them and maybe if you could take it at your own pace.<br>  <br>  My friend was 165 pounds and during the summer he dropped to 115 because he ran every day. He is now joining us in track and Cross Country.<br>  <br>  Stick with it and I guarantee you will see improvement.|`|8to6MsWuaa	You have to decide what is best for you. If you are misserable, then maybe you shouldn't do it, but give it at least a week before deciding. It will get easier as time goes on.Plus if you don't like the running part, you could try throwing discuss, javelin or shot put.

JXVdYVJjaa	Well, back in 1989 Greg Lemond averaged 34mph over 15.5 miles so a pro cyclist would beat a horse.|`|c2b4f2c9fe643129d284d8728194ae6aaa	Horse Speed in MPH - How fast is your horse going?<br>  <br>  Horses speed varies with their stride length, body build, and other factors, but here is a basic idea of how fast-- in miles per hour-- horses move at their various gaits:<br>  <br>  <br>  Walk: Roughly 3-4 MPH. A pleasure show horse can go as slow as 2 mph. Gaited horses-- who do not trot-- can do a 'running walk' as fast as 15 mph.<br>  <br>  Trot: The trot is roughly 8-10 MPH. Again, a shorter striding horse could trot slower, and a horse with a long stride could move faster.<br>  <br>  Canter/Lope: 10-17 MPH.<br>  <br>  Gallop: This depends on the horse's condition and athletic ability. Some horses are not built to run fast an may only do a fast canter at their best; however, the gallop is about 30 mph. Thoroughbreds, which are bred for running distance but not speed, have been clocked at over 40 MPH. Quarter horses, bred and raced for short distances at speed, can reach 50 MPH in short bursts according to the AQHA's website.|`|G3hTM9qeaa	10 miles? No horse on the planet can run for 10 straight miles without breaking their stride. That would be 8 laps around the track of the Kentucky Derby. A cyclist would have the mechanical advantage of the bike/gears. The cyclist would win.|`|Z5xgSATSaa	Over 1 mile, the horse would probably win, but over 10 miles the cyclist would overtake the horse and win easily|`|DOVbF4Piaa	A pro will out run a horse for ten miles.  In fact most cyclists can out run a horse for ten miles.

Go for the bigger bike. Standover is not a factor with this design. I'm sure your reach is enough.<br>  <br>  It's always best to try on bikes first before buying. You can do this at a LBS.

uS8hK7Zhaa	Because they had an understanding that the match at WM 24 would be Ric's last match. Shawn Michaels has the honor of facing him in the last match of his career. So if Flair were to compete in another match, some of the prestige from their match would be gone.<br>  <br>  So he would only wrestle a match with Shawn's blessing because that would show that Shawn is ok with not being the last man to wrestle Ric Flair|`|qypwWxuVaa	very good question idk maybe retiring from wwe idk but if u think about it every wrestler retires and wrestles again too but not in 1 year very good question|`|D5cOFZdwaa	i would imagine it is because hbk is the one who "retired" him. hbk and ric flair were also good friends outside of the wwe|`|WyPOnZdSaa	Because He Doesn't Want Any Disrepect Towards Him,After All He Did Have His Last Match With Him.|`|AA10576425	Though wrestling is all storylines, Flair does not want to disrespect HBK.. The match between Ric and HBK at WM24 was his last match.. If he is going to fight again in the ring, then that match loses its significance..|`|mJvZhdAuaa	Because he and Shawn Michaels are friends, he requested that Michaels be his last match.  It is in the history books that Michaels vs Flair at WM 24 was Flair's final match, this adds to Michael's legacy as much as it does Flair's.

8to6MsWuaa	to answer your questions:<br>  <br>  You can leave the spikes in. It won't harm the shoes at all, but it might put a hole in your spike bag.<br>  <br>  The longer spikes are illeagal because first of all, you get a advantage on everyone else, and the are probably made for cross country hills, and not a track. <br>  <br>  And no, you don't need to replace your spikes that often. I get new ones every season. You only might want to replace them if they are starting to wear out. <br>  <br>  hope that answered all you questions. btw good luck this season ( im a distance runner too)

GH0g7m4maa	a team clinches a playoff spot when they are assured the 9th place team can not catch up to the lakers need 8 wins to clinch or any sort of combo of 8 wins/phoniex loss|`|tzrLDbHWaa	Clinching means that there is no possible way that you can miss the playoffs.  If you lose every game the rest of the way you can not finish out of the playoffs.<br>  <br>  Given the current standings in the west, the Lakers are 50-12.  If they lose EVERY game the rest of the way, they would be 50-32.  The Phoenix Suns, who are 2nd in the division and currently the best team out of the playoffs is 34-29, meaning if they win every game they would finish 53-29, which is better than the Lakers.  Granted, every other team above Phoenix would need to win enough to all be above 50 wins, but it is technically possible.  Any combination of 3 Laker wins/Phoenix losses will clinch it for the Lakers.<br>  <br>  In the East, Boston is 49-15, meaning they could lose out for 49-33.  The #9 seeded Bucks are 30-36, so the best they could possibly do is 46-36, which means theres no way they can catch Boston.  Cleveland ar 49-13 can also lose out to be 49-33, so thats why they are in as well.  Orlando is at 46-16, which means they can lose out to be 46-36, the same as the Bucks can win out for.  This means that the next time either Orlando wins, or the Bucks lose, Orlando will clinch a playoff birth as well.|`|2db7f31f8de2a63df2848a630426eea7aa	Cleveland and Boston both clinched playoffs spots, because of their record, and how ahead they are of the number 8 seed. Chicago is the number 8 seed and they are 20.5 games behind. So Cleveland and Boston can loose all of their remaining games and they will still be in the playoffs. Things are closer in the West.|`|GY3QTszgaa	when there is a 0 percent chance they will make the playoffs they clinch. say the lal lost all there games and the suns won the rest of theirs then the suns would get in, but that wont happen. still it wont be official unless their is no way that the team can miss the playoffs, even if they lost the rest of their games. if the lakers win just  a few more games theyll clinch. the suns are 16 games behind the lakers but the lakers have 19 games left so mathimatically their is still a chance for them not to make the playoffs. but the lakers wont lose 17 games. if they did they would not make it if the suns won 17 games. when their is no chance that the lakers cant make the playoffs they'll clinch.|`|63e6fbd5b85357a27d660c7d5c0b9ee9aa	its just a matter of time<br>  they clinched a spot because the 9th place team can not catch them when you add their games won to the games they have yet to play and it adds up less to what Boston and Cleveland have all ready won|`|qtwYHyH5aa	Cause things are tougher in the West, and for exampla if the Lakers loose every single game from now, they'll be out of the playoffs. Cause the 8th seed in the WEST is way better than the 8th seed in the EAST, so think about it bro.|`|Tgy7n4HLaa	A team clinches a spot by there record meaning they can lose every game and still be in the playoffs. But the western conference teams have better records so it will take each team longer to clinch a playoff birth.|`|Kx6W1or7aa	Since the east is more "top heavy" than the west, the Celtics, Cavs, and Magic will be clinching playoff spots before any team in the west (besides the Lakers). After those 3 teams, the eastern really drops off.<br>  <br>  As for the west, the Lakers should be clinching a playoff spot soon. However, since there are more good teams in the west, it will be a while before the Spurs are able to clinch. I believe there are only 3 games separating them from number 8. It is definitely still no guarantee that the Spurs will finish number 2.|`|mfeBND6Saa	The west has a better 8th seed in dallas (38-25) while <br>  the east has a worse 8 th seed in chicago (29-34)<br>  Chicago is 20.5 back of Cleveland and Cleveland only has 20 games left so they clinched<br>  Dallas 12.5 back of L.A. and L.A. has 20 games left<br>  so they can still catch them
v5MP0KJ8aa	30 teams qualify automatically by winning their conference tournaments(automatic bids). The Ivy League champ qualifies by winning their conference regular season championship because they have no conference tournament. A selection committee chooses the remaining 34 teams(at-large bids). Teams in the top 25, who didn't receive an automatic bid, will usually receive an at-large bid. The remaining teams are selected based on overall record, conference record, record vs top 50, record vs top 100 and RPI ranking.|`|7gnRezZEaa	A team gets an automatic bid by winning their conference tournament and the remaining teams I believe its 34 receives an at-large bid by being selected by a NCAA selection committee.|`|Tgy7n4HLaa	I'm pretty sure it's by there record.|`|dI8PlgEqaa	for the smaller conferences it does b/c they tend to have weaker schedules. if you're on the bubble it goes by rpi rank, wins against top 50 in rpi and strength of schedule. im sure if u an insanely good record you could. but for the smaller conferences there only chance of getting in is pretty much by winning the conference tourney, if they lose their chances are much slimmer than the basketball powerhouses in SEC,ACC,and Big East|`|GY3QTszgaa	by being a good team

ko9Zy9k7aa	Agree with Edge and Orton but not Jericho.<br>  <br>  They're not my fave wrestlers, but definatley each of them are big and do a lot for the WWE. And they have all contributed to the WWE to make it what it is today, for sure.<br>  <br>  Chris Jericho is the weak link out of those three in my opinion, and I think that as long as Edge and Orton were present then the WWE could still look good and make good TV without Chris Jericho.<br>  <br>  Xx|`|gXHxf2G9aa	You're right.

Out of all 3, Orton is the most essential.  He is the youngest and is connection to the route the WWE wants to probably take.  Edge is nothing without some kind of lame gimmick to make him champ.  How amany more matches will the WWE make showing Edge winning by coming in at the last secon and stealing the Championship.  It is getting old, like the sock in mankind's underwear.  Jericho on the other hand, hasn't had time to get back to his original stature.  Before Jericho left to start a band, he was so cool and probably could have been the John Cena of today.  It is no way in heck if he stayed that John Cena or even Randy would even Get numerous chances to touch the Championships.  I rather have Orton out of either.  You have a Star making you money, controversy, and young.  No way that Edge or Jericho can even touch 2 out the 3.  Edge and Jericho have controversy but aren't  big income stars.  Plus who is to say Jericho will be with the WWE in 3 years.|`|srP47FC7aa	No not really. Jericho's been out before and Edge and Orton have both been injured many times and the company still went on.|`|w1gL0kiZaa	yahh because they are one of the best superstars in the WWE!

And Triple H is backed by management.. This storyline is more personal and powerful.. Undertaker would always beat up Edge or Chavo.. He did not do anything worse to Vicky.. But here Orton really got it hard on McMahon family (i mean in the storyline!!)|`|PniPsDmGaa	i was just noticing that!!! I think Triple H will get close to winning the match hitting the pedigree, then rhodes and Dibiase pull the referee out of the ring. They attack HHH, HHH get out, and Throws them out of the ring. Orton comes from behind and hits the RKO!!! Orton gets the pin and new champion!!!<br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  it seems like the same thing as what happened between Undertaker and Edge in there TLC match, and the same storyline. Undertaker and HHH do whatever it takes to win, but get beaten by more people.|`|b7JS16dyaa	It actually kind of is, but probably only because it's one man against many. Legacy doesn't use management to screw people; Legacy takes out management. I liked the La Familia/Undertaker story more though.|`|1JywgkyMaa	no,not even close,legacy is actually watchable, legacy has a great commander and leader like randy orton,where la familia had a cow like vickie leading the thing|`|OfutBhxYaa	no|`|qAnVAp10aa	yes|`|OHBvEYKHaa	yeah wwe creative team  sux

One day I will get there. <br>  <br>  #1 Rockets Fan|`|i5MInqeMaa	Bonds and A-rod are professional athletes that get payed big money to do what they do.  You don't get any money for getting best answers in the y/a basketball section.|`|tzrLDbHWaa	Nope|`|Nuj1eScCaa	Personally I don't think that best answers determine whether someone is smart in a category or not. Someone can get a lot of BA's just by being popular. I've seen a lot of MC's answers and he does know basketball well, whether he gives himself BA as an ego boost, that I don't know so I can't comment.|`|o6KAdVUSaa	yes i would bonds is the best home run hitter in history and a-rod is the best player current at the time steroids were legal and all the pitchers were doing them|`|Tgy7n4HLaa	Nope especially MC.|`|dfTMaV58aa	Get a life...<br>  u prolly cheat too...|`|C4mzZwiWaa	wheres the question????????????????????|`|DIQSP48caa	Cheating is only cheating if you get caught. ;-)|`|qtwYHyH5aa	Get a lyf, is only yahoo

I still don't understand how he gets such a huge pop when his music hits, compared to HBK his is sort of dieing down. Its amazing how someone who has been in the WWE since it debuted on TV, and is a great in ring wrestler gets a lower crowd reaction then a guy who cant wrestle, turns the WWE title into a wanna-be gangsta belt and holds it for 6 months beating the likes of Triple H|`|b1bb1949f6bd80a6b260437ca822b177aa	teaching his fan base their numbers.  next week will be brought to them by the number 8.|`|nep4Jl8naa	i think its 3 fingers on each hand for HUSTLE LOYALTY RESPECT|`|b8568740e59872f29e957e1ca020af9caa	Age limit  to be in his  fan club|`|19KqIxWjaa	He can't wrestle so he decides to come up with hand signs instead of trying to improve his wrestling.|`|rt8E2JhKaa	I did notice that too, but i think its the things on his shirt.|`|a45ffb40e1ff08eda37fb35f65c6eecaaa	how many wwe/world championships has he held? that could be it if he held 6. but im not sure he has|`|lGIL36faaa	just his new style basically<br>  <br>  i haven't noticed that tho|`|wum4X78maa	It's for Hustle Loyalty Respect. His new motto although I liked Word Life better.|`|qWNcOhJJaa	It's the number of people who think he is a good wrestler|`|1JywgkyMaa	its the number of fans he has|`|Pu1PM7Mnaa	im not really sure bt mayb he's just doing that for fun??? or maybe his new style IDk lol hope i helped
utTFiz3gaa	Honestly i always thought of rivalries as a fan thing, i didn't think that players took those kind of things to heart. Like with the whole David Wright and Jimmy Rollins thing i'm sure they are absolutely fine with playing with each other i don't see what the big deal is.. yeah the fans and media are the ones making such a big deal out of it and the interviewers constantly asking those kind of questions.. about Derek Jeter being the mediator and the whole truce thing ;)<br>  <br>  I think, as numerous articles have already said before, that this USA team was utterly embarrassed by their 8th place finish two years ago so they will put egos aside and unite together (they seem to have great chemistry its a great team!) to win the Classic. I was watching the Venezuela USA game and the announcer said that two years ago the USA team was like an all star fraternity party LOL! And i can see where he was coming from i mean i saw the WBC two years ago.. it was more about showcasing than playing hard and winning|`|tzrLDbHWaa	Not really.  I mean, to take one from Herm Edwards, you play to win the game.  Thats all that matters.  Look at someone like Johnny Damon.  He was totally HATED in NY when he was in Boston, then they embrace him when he signed with them.  That just goes to show you that players can get over the rivalry pretty quick if they need to.<br>  <br>  In the WBC its the same thing.  They're playing for their country.  As much as Pedroia and Jeter may be bitter Rivals, they're now Team USA's DP combo.  The man thats your biggest rival is now your teammate, and the guy who's your best friend and teammate can now be your rival.  You have to put all feelings aside when it comes to competition and just play to win.|`|gVYfFSpRaa	That's a good point.  I mean, I'm sure there's no full-out hostility, but I can't see players like Rollins and Wright getting along or being buddies.  But I do think that these guys want to win.  Their hearts are in it (and this time it's NOT for the money), and they're going to play their best and cooperate with the team no matter what it takes or who they're playing with.  They are there to represent their country, and they need to set aside whatever hositlity there might be and just play the game.|`|5Wo8cvrzaa	No, these guys are PROFESSIONALS and they dont HATE each other. Yes, guys have bad fights and arguments but most players chat before games and joke so I wouldn't think it would be a problem. Pedroia and Youkilis aren't going up to Jeter and saying "The Yankees Suck!" These guys have some class.|`|IRruNruhaa	no look at team USA redsox/Yankees mets/phillies they accept eachother but after the classic its back to hating jeter said tahat he got along well with his former rival team he said that after the classic when baseball actually starts its back to being rivals the classic is like the all star game in a way. people from every country on all teams make one team so its bonding by race and you got to work as a team to get your own country on top|`|3pLv7KBvaa	no... not at all they even talk and laugh togather when there on bases at the ballpark.<br>  <br>  just cause the team is a rivarly.. dosent mean the players arent friends.|`|kyEPS7xCaa	Nah, it's like the all-star game.<br>  Remember Piazza and Clemens.  <br>  Only fans really care about the rivalry.|`|GMQe88aaaa	Yes because they dont know how the other players play and it is hard for them to "Get in the Vibe"|`|ZVSZZ6qHaa	I don't think so.|`|xHc3KGDmaa	no I don't think so they are playing for their country|`|xIfvXy4waa	I'm sure it gets a little difficult, the guys you live to beat up on now your teammates. But more than teams they have one big thing in common, their heritage. That is what the WBC is about, and I think they are very mature for not making a fuss.
4284e409c8e26999c7eb4ffd92352976aa	I thought WWE could have sone something more innovative for the WM 25 logo.As it's a celebration of 25 years of WWE and Wrestlemania, they could have maybe used the green spraypaint logo like D-Generation X, in recognition of the hugely popular and influential Attitude Era.|`|Jd04Z1ISaa	I think that it looks kinda bad, and maybe old fashion, however I can understand the color of it and the sun in the background, because it is in a hot sunny desert state, like Arizona.|`|2FKHNIB2aa	I like it its not the best but i think its still a good design, i currently go to school for graphic design and that's something my teacher would give an A for, its simple but it dose not lose its feel of epic, plus it fits Arizona so well its very native american/ western feel to it.|`|Q1MI6L96aa	The spread-out font looks like something from WCW, but since WWE owns that company...I guess that cannot be a complaint. It is not "busy" and the colors will make for solid marketing concepts that will be visually appealing.|`|qNHMcRL4aa	i think it looks good, not as good as wm24 but that was a really good one. The colours are quite ood i think.<br>  Its gonna b at a big stadium though isnt it? so it needs to be big and noticeable.|`|Pvg6djVSaa	it looks pretty good to me|`|sqfjfR3iaa	The imporant thing will be the matches on the card. The Logo will be on all the Merchandise we buy, but I will be more concerned about the matches, the 2010 Hall of Fame Induction, WWE Fan Fests, Ring of Honor Shows and other events.|`|80b2d9dd1b346a0b0eaa4df0197bee14aa	I think it is pretty cool! It's bold yet traditional. As for the colors, not bad. Oh, please don't reference the colors to Arizona. Trust me, we do not have colors like that here.|`|XNbKc7Rzaa	I think its pretty good.<br>  Obv not as good as WM 24 but it has a nice look to it.|`|1WgOj89kaa	Its not bad, isnt the worst logo WWE has come up with.|`|DUJnkYDzaa	Its ok, not that bad.|`|T13xM9iJaa	Well it is a BIG stadium I mean they had Superbowl42 there so you know it gotta be BIG|`|VBfhoqS3aa	Its brown :||`|T8IFOfHCaa	its ok|`|QB3LvbVaaa	its cool<br>  <br>  please answer my question|`|5DhAgWgwaa	I don't think it looks bad at all, for the past few years the logos reflect the location that its in.|`|An10In6daa	It's alright,but not one of the best.
fbe8face4c64fd238c4d4c3fd28046a7aa	Everyone probably has the same fear. Just go in with a couple of friends to stand by and just try and relax and act like it doesn't bother you. Pretty soon you will feel comfortable and you will just laugh about how you were so nervous. Good luck.|`|nhfaPN0Iaa	yes it is very embarrassing|`|IGCZq7BXaa	umm yea i dont take showers after gym but it would be nice swinging my johnson around after a shower =)|`|hZLkzuuiaa	I only needed to shower after swimming, and then everyone rinsed off in their swimming suits! It seems highly innappropriate to me that being naked in a group of people you don't really know should be part of your grade. I would talk to your parents and your school counselor or principal about the matter. I wouldn't want to be in that situation, and I definently wouldn't want my daughter to either.|`|cp7fjeJhaa	hi there, <br>  <br>  everyone feels the same way as you do, at first you will feel awkward and no one really looks at each other, every girl is going to feel weird being naked....all i can say is you get undressed fast, shower fast and boom done......feel the fear, feel the embarassment and do it anyhow.....maybe start now at your house, walk around your room naked to get used to it, when no one is home, walk around naked.....you will slowly feel less embarassed......|`|8Bv8SNSeaa	Wow , i didnt think girls had a problem with that.|`|Q6jOWIN2aa	nope, as long as you don't mind showering in a swimming pool it should be fine|`|YFmtHNkiaa	well guys probably have other stuff to compare lol. im 9th grade in high school and its not necessary. when i had to go to camp though and shower with a bunch of chicks i hardly knew it was really embarrassing! i was sooo flat-chested and these girls i didn't even know teased me horribly about it!!! also, its not exactly like you WANT some of your class enemies to see every flaw on your body. i used to ignore other people and eventually got over my shyness because i figured our that their opinions of me weren't really worth sh*t|`|C5OfG88Waa	yea<br>  but most people are equally embarrassed and after a while its better.|`|VkVyuq5baa	It's just the same for guys. My willy slipped out once and I got this awkward glance from the fat kid in our year! It's not really something you grow out of, I just started avoiding games altogether. How? Lol I took the day off when we were meant to be placed in the games groups. I guess everybody feels it though, you have the reassurance that you are not the only one x|`|3Fma3URSaa	Ya.<br>  At first everybody makes a big deal about it because that's how they think they should react to being naked with a lot of girls around you.<br>  <br>  Soon it just gets old and showering is just another thing you have to do.<br>  <br>  Doesn't make a difference. Same parts so.. ya...|`|btYjw5wQaa	well it not embarresing if they have curtians but if not wear a swim suit|`|oXnlk1yOaa	in the middle school i went to thy had like separated showers.<br>  idk about high school cuz i never had a gym class in hs.<br>  <br>  but im sure they are separated too.|`|dUglyCKDaa	Just act like your perfectly fine and comfortable with taking a shower. Then you'll eventually get over it.|`|3wYb6bfiaa	Id rather pee on myself a thousand times before i take a shower in front of people lol|`|2bkV73gpaa	It's also embarrassing to smell in class.<br>  <br>  Believe me, there are worse things than showering with your classmates. Just try imagining most of the guys in your high school seeing full-frontal nude pics of you taken without your knowledge.<br>  <br>  Just avoid eye contact with the other girls if you feel embarrassed or shower with your friends nearby.<br>  <br>  If many girls feel the same way, try to get the school to put up individual shower stalls.<br>  <br>  If the boys locker room has them, get the school newspaper to write about how sexist the school is towards girls.<br>  <br>  Anonymously spread a rumor that a hidden camera was found in the ceiling? That will cause an uproar, no one will want to shower and maybe the stalls will be put in as a compromise.|`|W97g4Kwgaa	I'm not in highschool but i bet taking a shower infront of people is embarasing|`|H5tvzBoGaa	so you're saying guys don't have to worry about having a tiny weiner??<br>  <br>  basically there's nothing you can do about it, so you just have to learn to be comfortable with it. you'll probably never see those people again after high school anyways.<br>  if they give you crap about it, let everybody know they were checking out all the other girls...|`|PkeY5PlCaa	hmmm thats a bit rough isnt it!<br>  well i live in australia, and im out of high school now. but we didnt even have showers after our 'gym classes' we call them 'p.e' <br>  we have whats called src meetings where parents can go to meetings and bring up any concerns, maybe if you get a few mothers together at a meeting and get them to voice your opinions. if it is essential for you to shower, which would probably feel alot better anyways they should have sufficient privacy for each shower.<br>  i hope you work it out, goodluck.|`|kuFAx4ymaa	send me some pictures and I'll tell you if its embarrassing or not.<br>  <br>  (kidding of couse)<br>  <br>  also, uhhh...  Guys do have the equivalent of 'boobs' to compare...  And for some guys its a lot more embarrassing, 9th grade guys are still at various stages of adolescence sooo...|`|70fvxvj0aa	Uh... kinda weird that your school requires you to take a shower. <br>  <br>  You could probably get out of it by getting your parents to make a note saying it's against your religion if you wanted. <br>  <br>  I'm pretty sure they couldn't force you to take a shower and fail you if you refuse. Sounds a bit illegal actually. Do you live in Canada or something?|`|574ab5e3e9cbff7d5675fc7b90b40e05aa	lol, how will they know if youve showered??????????|`|z35zX9FFaa	you sould bring a water bottle and just wet yourself all over with it|`|LpsnLhVSaa	do they seriously grade you on your personal hygeine? thats pretty dumb. If your really that nervous, talk to the counselor and i am sure that they can do something about. Other than that you can just wear a swim suit.|`|DEIxwvKPaa	its fun for guys<br>  just chill and thats it<br>  girls are weird and different about their showers tho<br>  doesnt make sense to me|`|ndVPHfmaaa	I promise you will get over it.  Everyone feel awkward about it, but eventually it will just be easy, make it quick and have your towel ready and don;t tare at anyone else, you will be fine.|`|Dvx1f743aa	guys have other things to compare tho haha<br>  <br>  most girls locker rooms have shower curtains in them unlike boys locker rooms where they dont|`|ECaqY67Iaa	thats right. they have d.i.c.k.s. and they speak there mind about it im sure! lol and really. i really think you will get used to it.|`|uZo5cLscaa	well i would think if you are having serious self esteem issues with this, you could talk to a trusted teacher or parent and see if you can get out of it.|`|PvSGrtzJaa	your right, guys don't have boobs. Guys have penises!  There are alot of guys who like small breast!  Never met a chick who likes a guy with a small penis.|`|XaODPwvNaa	ok first if you are embarrassed to show ur Body wear a bathing suit or a bikini|`|ucfR5uHwaa	people wont think you're weird if you just want to put on a bathing suit while you shower<br>  <br>  girls do it all the time, no big deal<br>  <br>  :)|`|eySOuiOlaa	yesss creepers are always wathcing and the gym teacheers are lesbossss|`|I8g1QDgwaa	wow thats weird that you would be getting graded on bathing. at my school it isnt necessary so really no one does, even though we have curtains.|`|cF2Wa1tqaa	guys have penises to compare so its even worse, ovcourse i didnt have that problem|`|x9FGHC8Zaa	I just didn't take showers after gym. If the want to take away from your grade ask about making it up somehow else. Don't  be afraid to tell them no. They cant force you to. If your teacher gives you a hard  time talk to the vice principal or principal. that's what i did.|`|5oQbDhl2aa	ugh...boys...but i didn't have to shower for gym in high school, but it shouldn't b tht bad. u dont need to compare yourself, just b comfortable in ur own skin, there's a chance tht other girls are gunna b comparing themselves to you and feeling bad too. it's just life, and if someone says something mean or anything..just accuse them (really loud) of staring at ur boobs. lol.|`|3IdZfdsQaa	I think so.|`|dUwl7Gn0aa	even if it didnt require me to take a shower i would still take one, i would not want to stink for the rest of the day during school. Its a shower i go in there to have a wash, not to look at everyone else.|`|iO9qB0Cuaa	im not in highschool yet im in middle school but we can take showers at first you get a little nervous but then after a week you get used to it and its only girls in there and so its not like anyone is looking at you|`|tOp7S0xpaa	yeah we don't have boobs. but we have something different|`|htcfyWblaa	it's really not that bad! <br>  don't worry!!!|`|dr6rdPGkaa	don' worry, there not as bad as they seem. i'm in ninth grade too& everyone is just trying to shower, nobody is looking at you. some people wear bathing suits, so it's up to you. nothing to get stressed about.<br>  <333allison|`|bJDDSIObaa	at my high school you don't have to take showers after gym only if you want to i think that it is wrong that they enforce it|`|KfQKvToqaa	I wouldn't know because I've never gone to a school that required it. However, I know for a fact that if my school did, there is no way I would do it. I really don't know if its that embarrassing or not, my mom said it wasn't, but I know I wouldn't want to do it. I would simply refuse to take a shower. Try not to get stinky. People don't realize how much power they have. You don't have to put up with anything! You do not have to take a shower if you don't want to. If you stand up and say you don't want to, I'll bet a bunch of other girls will appreciate you for it. I'm sure a ton of them don't want to do it either.<br>  <br>  I'm in high school, and, to be honest, I don't even like changing in front of others. <br>  <br>  But if you do end up having to do it, or you just don't want to go through all that rebellion drama, then don't worry too much about it. Everyone else in that room will be just as uncomfortable as you are and in the exact same situation. No one will stare at you or anything. Everyone's in the same situation. <br>  <br>  Good luck! :D|`|BDp329Rcaa	They require you, lol.<br>  <br>  Just hope you aren't the ugliest one or just don't mentioned anything, show confidence. The ones that talk are the most insecure.<br>  <br>  But I am a guy|`|pa3no76eaa	I know you want a girl's opinion. But I'm a guy. You know what the guys do, we strip down to our underwear then change into different clothes in a toilet stall. Best I can think of|`|5AoUCTMLaa	just relax<br>  <br>  most girls are probably as nervous as you are.<br>  if you don't stare at other people, they wont look at you.<br>  <br>  just remember you all have the same bits and your all still growing<br>  <br>  hope i helped <br>  xx|`|muqP7zzIaa	going to 9th grade next year, and I'm a guy, so I have no idea, lol.<br>  I'm sure people get over it though, aside from those immature enough to not get over it.|`|yvugbHpRaa	I took gym freshman year. Showering was noooot that big of a deal.<br>  At all.<br>  Everyone has the same stuff, it might be different but its all the same.|`|t4BqZx0paa	awesome! showers!...i take showers all the time but theirs this very ugly ***** in my class and she smells so ******* bad just because she doesnt like showers. she says she has somekind of phobia xD im gonna celebrate :3
muqP7zzIaa	Depends. <br>  If he shuts up and plays football, then it's all good.<br>  If he causes disruptions and divides the locker room, he's out.|`|tOp7S0xpaa	I don't think he'll fit well in the buffalo offense. he complained last year about him not getting the ball. part of that reason is that dallas developed a great running back in marion barber. i don't think he'll get the ball that much with marshawn lynch in the backfield. plus, trent edwards has terrible accuracy|`|54OvilHuaa	its a 1 year agreement ,yea ,so<br>  i thnk hes gonna turn out helping the team of the bills<br>  then theyll sign him longer.<br>  hes still a really good player<br>  and he deserves more money<br>  cowboys ********* it wasnt his fault<br>  people used him for an excuse<br>  watch him with trent edwards hell do way better<br>  tony romo sucks balls|`|acff4bbcffd769f78d77467433841c67aa	he'll last for a year until buffalo realizes the mistake they made.... theres a reason he's never won a ring and its not because hes not talented ( B/C he is) it's because he doesnt know when to keep his mouth shut... its a shame so much talent has gone to someone with such little class...|`|1601c0d5bd9255f647b213a7868f1d06aa	i say short -term. T.O. is a one-man team wreck-machine.|`|ywRowtA1aa	Really.....you really have to ask this question....has he ever lasted long term with anyone without disrupting the team in matter of a few years.|`|ofC4JQIhaa	he is there for one year 6.5 million|`|51e7baee76cfe5758f817c35c038f4c7aa	He'll do fine in the short term.  He usually loses his mind sometime in the second or third year with a team.  So long as they only use him this one year, they'll be OK.  <br>  <br>  What will happen is what happens with everyone.  They will think he changed and is doing better after the first year, then offer him a multi-year deal.  Then they'll be sorry.|`|5gKGtSriaa	One year is the agreement. <br>        They'll probably see if he's good for the team, and if not they'll not resign him. I think that the teams not ready for him. They need a maybe 2 years to reconstruct.|`|a7bfee8f94afdfd3ac16e448849ea19faa	personally, from a team QB to reciever fit i think it will be really good.

onvpwieHaa	O percent chance. <br>  <br>  Kobe and Shaq have a better chance of teaming up than a duo of LeBron and Kobe.|`|i5MInqeMaa	Maybe when there both outta their primes and are nothing more than role players.|`|khbLZQHIaa	Even if they did put money aside, the team would never win a ring.<br>  <br>  It may be a good regular season team, but no way will it be good enough in 4th quarters and playoff games.<br>  <br>  With Kobe and LeBron, you need to be carefull.  If both are on the same team there's going to be too much "Hey let me shoot the last shot!" or "I want the ball now!" "You're such a ballhog" "I want out of this team me and *other* can't work together!"<br>  <br>  blah blah. yadda yadda.<br>  <br>  That much talent isn't always a good thing.  In most cases, it's a bad thing.<br>  <br>  LeBron + Kobe = Good on surface + emotions + skill + selfishness = Regular, dissapointing team.|`|tzrLDbHWaa	100% chance, at the Olympics, thats all.<br>  <br>  Why don't they set the money aside?  Simple.  Who's going to do that?  How would they decide who's going to make the money and who's going to make jack?  Both think they're great, and neither would want to concede the money.  <br>  <br>  Also, setting the money aside screws you for the rest of your career.  Its not like baseball where LeBron could go to LA for $5 million, then sign a big deal later for $20 mil.  Basketball contracts have maximums.  Once you're over that max, you can still make more money, as your new max contract is based off your old contract, with certain percentage raises.

4TLlrJnuaa	Well, that is a very good dove load. But, you said it is not for hunting, so yes those loads will work in your gun just fine, but dove and small varmints are the only thing you can really shoot well with them. If your gun is for home protection, next time you should try a #2 shot or buckshot, something with more substantial pellets. If it is for recreational shooting, that load is fine, it won't kick very hard. Make sure you have the right guage though (i.e. 12, 20, .410 etc.)|`|ZDMgrUcKaa	as long as you got the right gauge shell if you have a 12 gauge make sure the shells are 12 gauge shells. just make sure you have the right shells for the gauge of your gun.|`|8ivnzNi5aa	If the gauge size of the shells is the same as the gun, they're right.  That sounds like a serviceable home-defense load.|`|mFa5ZDtcaa	That shell will work for rabbit, dove, quail and 2 legged skunks. You might want a #4 load for squirrels. They have a thick hide.|`|AA12274507	I use those for shooting trap. They wouldn't serve well for home defense. I use #4 Nitro for home defense.

Ballistic rated goggles do make things a whole lot easier if you want to use a cheek rest. Although nearly every field that i have played at requires people >18 to a full face mask.

Me, I need to train now, at 14, because I'm natural, and I don't take protein shake **** and all that, but at your age, if you're out of shape, GNC products could help you out. Get Acai berry juice from the internet, it increases stamina, helps recover, and has lots of antioxidants. I heard its pretty good because I read the label of what's inside, this one heavyweight boxer uses it so he can maintain his bigass size and train every single day, and T.O. uses it.<br>  <br>  <br>  If a trainer isn't a complete ******, he will train you for free because he sees something in you. The trainers that charge money are the ones who scam fat people who want to get in shape. Learn Mike Tyson's style from youtube videos, copy it, and just get in shape - so when you do find a trainer, you can blow him away. Do lots of pushups, dips, situps, handstand pushups on a wall, shadowboxing, dodging an invisible fist coming at u, etc. Run, jumprope.<br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  You could move to Catskill, New York, and train at the gym Tyson trained at, or find kevin rooney.

Blade irons have a very small head and typically a smaller sweet spot, BUT blade irons when hit right are easier to work the ball (i.e: draw or fade)<br>  <br>  Cavity back irons are just a smidgen harder to work the ball, BUT cavitiy back irons are more forgiving!<br>  <br>  So you actually have quite a few options for cavity backs:<br>  Cleveland Golf have some nice cavity backs, as do Callaway, Titleis, and Ping.<br>  <br>  Blade Irons: Mizuno, Titleist, KZG (brand that everyone is waking up to)<br>  <br>  Check eBay for used stuff etc. Beware of new irons sets (occasionally you'll run into "knock off" stuff that pretends to be the real deal.  Make sure the seller is reputable)<br>  <br>  OR you could just support your local golf pro and buy new from them.  :)<br>  <br>  Good luck with your Game!!!|`|EgiCy9mdaa	I have the titlist AP2's which i love and hit amazing, so if i could recommend anything, i would recommend getting those!|`|BPDvvryraa	If you want to go a little bit lower for a great set of clubs I would recommend a set of gradule irons that are forged.  I'm pretty sure most club makers have a set.  It is where the 3-6 are more of a cavity back for more forgiveness and the 7-PW are blades for more control.  I never played anything but blades but I bought a set of Hogan FTX irons and loved them but they are about 5 or 6 years old.  I then went to the Nike Pro Combos about 3 years ago and still hit them to this day.  My friend owns a golf store so I get to test out the latest and greatest.  There are some irons that I really like but can't get away from my Pro Combos.  Most new irons will run about the same price tag between 800-1000 for forged and 600-800 for cast with Callaway as the exception with a normal tag of over a 1000.  I highly recommend a gently used set that will normally run you 300-500.  The best way to tell is to go to your local golf store and most of them have an indoor hitting range.  It is best to buy the bigger name brands but you have to make sure they feel good to you.  A couple others I like are the Cleveland Pearls, Nike CCI, any Mizuno forged blade, any pre-Callaway Hogan irons.|`|0Hrn3fIuaa	This question seems like an open inquiry based on opinion. We usually get clubs based on what aspect of golf we want to improve. That being said, find out which club will improve your game the best. Are you a dead pull hitter, fader, short? I agree with the first poster that you don't necessarily need brand new clubs, but the old addage is: it's the Indian, not the arrow.|`|eENOmz5Laa	Callaway 2009 Big Bertha Irons<br>  Callaway X-22 Tour Irons<br>  Taylormade 2009 Tour Preferred Iron Set

bua3rhAoaa	I like the trade for you. Lilly has been solid for a few years now and Devine has great potential. <br>  <br>  If Chipper stays healthy you should be in the running every week in a head to head league. I would clear out some of that bench and pick up some more pitching. 3 closers is fine but you can get a couple of more starters to help with wins and strikeouts. Drop Ellis and Crisp, they are not very good fantasy players, for some SP on the waiver wire. You can always get a fill-in off the waiver wire if someone gets hurt but you can't make up for only having 4 starting pitchers.<br>  <br>  You've got some tweaking to do but with the right moves you could still be playing in the first week of September.|`|dg7bNDrFaa	Below average.

X7O0Uxqxaa	Brett Favre is by far the greatest football player ever, period.|`|hCLmczgMaa	Joe Montana. Never seen him play in my lifetime but i see his films. he is a legend and an icon... looks at his superbowl victories|`|c03a1e29209b69a15065f8edab5c54daaa	I hate the man with a passion, but I think it's John Elway.  5 Superbowl apperances, 2 wins, 1987 NFL MVP.  Some will argue that he lost 3 Superbowls so he isn't that great, but the teams he led to those Superbowls were in reality bad teams that had no business even making the playoffs, let alone the Superbowl and he was the one and only reason they made it as far as they did.|`|0f5cc27a5aca75cf6162b2cbb88fc13caa	personally I will say John Elway.  Championships an all that are overrated in my opinion.  Sure the QB is the leader but come on, if your on a talented team, your gonna win. Aikman was good but he isnt better then Dan Marino who hasnt won one!   I say Elway because he did more with less then anyoen did.  Can anyone name a great WR he really had?  Rod Smith was good but in reality he came on in Elways later years!  Elway really never had a great running back to play with either.  In my opinion that is exactly why they got smoked in those early Super Bowls.  Teams knew they could just key in on Elway an they would win.  That what happened an the Broncos got routed.|`|fxqA5EMvaa	Montana or Graham..i mean greatness and leadership wins championships not always stats|`|dXblgZEzaa	Tom Brady is the GOAT|`|KzlyHEgraa	Joe Montana or Otto Graham <br>  Even though no QB will even match the greats like Montana, Graham, Unitas, Starr. Tom Brady if he comes back healthy and continues could be in the same sentence with some of the greats. The only reason i pick him over Peyton Manning is because the greats are remeemberd in a different catagory if then have multiple rings.|`|Jp7qZKfMaa	Its Brett Favre it may be a surprise but Brett Favre has most touchdowns most int. but it doesn't have any affect of suction or anything to take away Brett Favres Brett Favreness or greatness but he still is amazing and but ya got the Brett Favre running around in the superbowl like a kid it reminds you of chips and dip and it makes you feel happy inside and that's what Brett Favre can do|`|ABoo1doVaa	Otto Graham. 6 years in the league, 6 championship game appearances, 3 wins.<br>  <br>  Tom Brady and Peyton Manning should be on anyone's top 10 or top 15 list, and Drew Brees has a chance to put his name on it.(I am assuming we are counting Favre as retired this week, of course he is on it).|`|yVBvY4P5aa	Now: Peyton Manning or Warner all-time: Marino or  Johnny Unitis|`|Dvx1f743aa	donovan mcnabb|`|NiMluxNDaa	definately joe montana and otto graham<br>  they just dont know how to loose|`|1i9mrq5Yaa	there really is no greatest qb of all time <br>  all of them were great in there own ways|`|yWcPOTsAaa	Joe cool of SF|`|GZMKb8plaa	I think that as of now, Joe Montana is the greatest quarterback of all time. He had the flashy regular season numbers and 4 Superbowl rings to go with them.<br>  <br>  FYI, rings are not the most important thing in judging a quarterback. Ken Stabler has three and Peyton Manning has one. Who's the better all time QB? Exactly. <br>  <br>  And if Peyton wins another one, Montana's gonna have to move over.|`|G5QqijG0aa	The only one in the league right now is Peyton Manning. No other QB in the league has as much freedom, to call his own play at the line, as he does.  Best QB ever is hard there are so many out there, Montana has got to be the guy if you are down in the 4th quarter or Dan Marino if you want a QB to stick with for a whole season.|`|muqP7zzIaa	How about One retiree you left out? <br>  Brett favre. period.<br>  Started the most consecutive games (once he got the starting role, he kept it, and didn't let injury stop him)<br>  Has broken almost every record known to the NFL QB.<br>  He might only have one ring, but he's been to the playoffs lord knows how many times (well, i could look it up, but oh well).<br>  He turned the Packers from a loser into a contender.|`|5K43n7ieaa	Otto Grahm is the greatest quarterback of all time NO Question.  I was not around to see him play, but he was in 10 NFL championships and won 7.  He was the greatest winner and therefore, the greatest qb of all time.<br>  <br>  Peyton Manning and Tom Brady should be on this list.|`|54OvilHuaa	sage rosenfields<br>  sike <br>  <br>  joe montana or this generation it would be benroethlisberger, hes so underated<br>  he has more sb's them both mannings and they still say hes not in the top 3<br>  whatever<br>  1.big ben<br>  2.tom brady<br>  3.p manning|`|sMkJGmXaaa	its an opinion thing.

9b5QUw2eaa	Yeah.  Judo is one of the most effective sports that can be converted to combat.  Even more important than being able to hurt someone by throwing them on the ground, is the ability to put them in a vulnerable spot and control their limbs.|`|5bzJUmh4aa	A judo blackbelt would easily be able to throw someone who was not trained in judo or another grappling style.  Dumping someone on their head, especially on concrete or another hard surface, would definitely hurt!  A throw wouldn't necessarily end the fight, but it would at the very least give you the opportunity to escape.  Judo also teaches chokes and submissions, so once you threw your attacker you could subdue him or finish him off.|`|Yslq4OYhaa	Consider this: the average person doesn't know how to fall. If you don't know how to fall you risk being injured, maybe permanent. You will have a tremendous headache. After being thrown you are in a very vulnerable position. If this is an experienced judoka they will often increase the effectiveness of the throw by landing with all of their weight into the opponents chest. This will take the wind out of most people. Then we will finish it off by choking you out. If we choose we can break a few joints. :-)<br>  <br>  How is that for effective?<br>  <br>  Edit:<br>  <br>  Originally judo was designed for combat. It is still a martial art. It is great for self defense. If I were in a bar and a fight broke out I would be very confident that if all I knew was judo that I would survive the attack. I know I could defend myself against any level of attacker (average and above average).<br>  <br>  I have personal experience and know of others that used their judo to defend themselves or to defend others. A good friend and team  mate of mines in high school threw an adult through his own corvette's windshield to stop him from abusing a girl.|`|5KjvNg2oaa	one time a big guy charged at me and i used a judo throw to flip him on the ground and held him in a headlock and punched his face until he submitted.

HxluJK2Vaa	Good question...<br>  <br>  When I first started playing senior footy as a kid I couldn't sleep, I'd run out of gas at half time. A thing that I did was to get a footy the night before and before the game and stand about five feet from the ball and bounce the ball off it. Not only did it calm my nerves it helped me concentrate on the seams of the footy and develop greater hand speed. Concentrating on the seams of the footy helped my marking and quick hands are essential these days, we can thank Diesel Williams for that.<br>  <br>  The nerves will ease the more you play. Don't worry about the pace yet, get your hands on the ball the pace will come... not all of the good players have pace, they have the ball!|`|4wRyTY9Raa	G'DAY, it's pretty normal to get nervous, i played footy from the age of about 8 untill i was 41, some of the sights i used to see in the rooms b4 a game.   I can only speak for myself but i used to have a good breakfast, and whack on Elvis in concert, every saturday morning, i'd try to stay busy by reading the saturday paper or whatever.<br>  <br>  I guess i wasn't your nervous type, not like some, but when i'd get to the ground i'd try and get a space where i could chill out on my own b4 a game, i guess every one is different mate, don't try to change too much, just relax ,if you can't, you need to learn some relaxation techniques, just remember it's only a game, main focus is to enjoy your self and try to get better every week.|`|Dn1VnPmFaa	I suppose It's all a question of how bad year nerves are?<br>  <br>     A couple of hours before a Big Game I like to do nothing better than to play some of my favourite music (AC/DC LOUD) and to slowing feed off my nerves.<br>  <br>     Believe me,at the start of the game I still had them (ever so slightly) but I was totally focused on what what I needed to do!<br>  <br>        Try it out, if it doesn't work for you ditch it!!!|`|W8SgRKo7aa	don't get rid of them use them to your advantaage your obviously excited to play and don't wanna screw up but nerves is what makes you better.<br>  Use them as an advantageto your training and put your mind to different things before you play|`|AA11615225	Rather than settle them (nerves).... focus them on what you need to do.<br>  Remember being nervous has a chemical purpose. If you remember that the reason you're getting nervous is so that you body can start producing adrenaline so that you can preform better, being "nervous" ceases to be less feeling "nervous" and more a feeling of a heighten state of alertness.|`|HtZL4oZaaa	Pre game nerves are a good thing, it shows you are into your footy and want to do well.<br>  Get to the ground, mix with your mates, have a laugh together.<br>  Try to avoid changing as long as possible.<br>  This is from 20 years of experience.<br>  As Romper said, it is only a game.<br>  The most important thing is enjoy it.|`|mXFOru11aa	kick the first goal|`|JEMtVVkBaa	there isnt much you can do about it.<br>  <br>  Let yourself be nervous. Then if you play an excellent game, then do the routine that you did before that game.<br>  <br>  I was at a conference (an umpiring one) and the guy said that you cant help nerves. But you can change what you do. If you do things before the match and it works, then stick to that.<br>  <br>  When he sees people and they are in nad form, all he says is "what did you change?". <br>  <br>  It may sound superstisous, but all you can do is give it a try.<br>  <br>  When I am nervous before a big game, all I do is get out there and go my hardest for the first three minutes. Then the game starts to settle in and it all becomes normal.
sg3YsDC6aa	this is a very tough fight to choose for. i would put money on on the veteran and more experienced boxer. diaz is a great fighter and i respect him hundred percent but marquez is too smart of a fight|`|BNqbOfBsaa	I am in the same shoes!

Diaz will be tough though as he is a very busy fighter.|`|NytiQ9nJaa	idk its gonna be close but ima goy for my boy diaz i know he train hard an i like his stamina alot i think thats gonna help him...an diaz is real mexican dnt hate on him|`|5efx3NcSaa	You can watch the fight live and for free on <a href="http://www.LiveStream.us.tt" rel="nofollow">http://www.LiveStream.us.tt</a>
Ucbnl7VJaa	Are you SURE you will be able to find the same dive site & be the FIRST divers there the next day? If so....<br>  <br>  Is the box too valuable to drill a hole in one end and mount an eye-bolt to the box? If not use a fender washer on both sides of the box to spread any pressure from the bolt. Use the eye-bolt to attach a small anchor to secure the box. Put a few rock inside still to minimize buoyancy and the anchor will prevent any kind of shift in position overnight. Don't forget to scrape up the sand a bit and bury the anchor to get the best hold.<br>  <br>  btw this is one seriously creative idea. Good luck and I hope she says yes to your proposal.|`|VXcp8hvHaa	don't take anything in the water with you that you don't want to lose, especially at night. Surely you can think of something else|`|FKJaQXQLaa	Just buy a lead weight from a sporting goods store or dive shop.  Put the weight in the bag instead of the stones, it will hold it on the bottom.  A five pound lead weight ought to do it.  If the guides will help, maybe they will let you borrow a weight.  I must say, that is a very unique way of proposing.  Great imagination and good luck.|`|nGMJhroEaa	Try covering it with an old fishing net weighed down with a few rocks|`|LebbFTpeaa	Perhaps you could have the guides find a 'treasure chest' and fill it with sand, rocks as well as your water proof pouch. Depending on currents, they may have to stake it to something - that might be tricky in an environmentally sensitive area.   If they put a weight belt around it, that may keep it in place. Or maybe they could put it in place before divers leave the boat for the morning dive.<br>  <br>  Anything can happen with shifting sand and tides. It's a wonderful idea. I hope it works out for you.
1Ihf8Ixeaa	First of all, that is so cute! nice idea!<br>  <br>  As far as the box...<br>  it depends on how far down you will be going.  If you are going shallow and can reach the bottom, I would say put it on the sand. If the box is tall enough, wrap a weight around it (the dive shop should have a weight that looks like a bungee cord, they usually clip them around the ankle.) and half bury the box in the sand...and leave it so you can still see the top. So that way, you can swim around and...suprise it's like a buried treasure box.|`|fHJqqMzLaa	Have the divemaster attach it to the mooring line or anchor line of the boat.  15 foot safety stop would be ideal.  This way it will less likely for your surprise to drift off.<br>  If you want it to be found during the dive,  they can attach it to some lead weights to keep it in place.  Once planted, the divemaster could get your attention as if to show you a cool fish or something.  It would be cool if you attached a slate to it as well with your proposal written on it (leave room for her to write her answer on it).  If she says yes, the slate will make a great memento of the event.<br>  I like your creativity and hope you don't mind me sharing your story and idea when I teach scuba students.  I am a scuba instructor for <a href="http://www.visibilityunlimited.com" rel="nofollow">http://www.visibilityunlimited.com</a>|`|16vMIGPiaa	rjamason and Katy are on it and so are you.  Work with a dive guide; they've heard of or done stuff like this before.<br>  A few stones won't do it.  Remember Archimedes.  You'll want to use at least 20 pounds of lead to be sure this package doesn't drift away.  Maybe more since it's just neutrally bouyant.  Too much weight in an anchor is never a bad answer; too little is definitely not good.<br>  <br>  You'll also want to get careful bearings (oh goody - Underwater Navigation) so you don't lose the thing.  Since this is supposed to be a "find", putting a marker light on it is probably right out.

MuuTGyGSaa	Here is how I look at it. As a scoring point guard, Mo is better. He has really developed his game this year to the point where people need to watch Lebron and HIM on the court.<br>  <br>  But as a true PG, go with Nelson, because he averages about an assist and a half more than Mo.<br>  <br>  Mo scores more, but if you think about it, he does not score that much more. Sure, as of when he started to become very good, he has been averaging twenty points a game. Nelson averages 17, which is also pretty good for a PG. They are both excellent FT and 3PT shooters, but Nelson is has a higher field goal percentage- it is above 50 percent (which is extremely high).<br>  <br>  Not to take anything away from Mo, but Nelson takes more quality shots...<br>  <br>  so if I had to choose, I would say Nelson|`|GY3QTszgaa	ill go with moe. look at what he has done with the cavs. he changed them from a eastern semis team to a pssible title contender. he is capable of putting up eye popping numbers like 43pts and he has scored 40+ 2 times this year. he takes over games in the 4th and he is clutch|`|GH0g7m4maa	Jameer Nelson he has more handling skills nd plus he was an all star Mo was a substitution for him but da best young point guards in the league will be against 3 people would be <br>  Devin Harris Jameer Nelson nd Derrick Rose|`|TbPyTIXpaa	nelson|`|AsIGEd2daa	I really don't think you could go wrong with either...|`|AA10554563	Jack Daniels|`|qtwYHyH5aa	mo will|`|o6KAdVUSaa	mo williams|`|dfTMaV58aa	MoE...|`|7gnRezZEaa	Jameer Nelson is because he means more to his team beyond the numbers.He is the glue of the team and is the difference between the Magic reaching the 2nd rd. or possibly reaching the Finals.|`|C4mzZwiWaa	jameer|`|6yoQhXsOaa	If Jameer wasn't hurt he would be better.|`|Tgy7n4HLaa	I say it's a tie.

3d3d2a18b838d322464051559bd8c0e3aa	It actually depends on how much points your opponent scores.<br>  You need to get two more points and two more games than your opponent to win a game and a set, respectively.<br>  Example : You won six games and your opponent won 5, you need another game to take the match, making a set consisting of 7 games.<br>  <br>  Try "It depends on the points the opponent have" to your coach.<br>  I am also curious to hear what the correct answer is.<br>  <br>  EDIT : Or maybe, "You need to win more sets than your opponent. Points does not determine the winner."|`|qnbImhmbaa	You should have said, simply, "I need at least 48 points to win the match."<br>  <br>  There is absolutely nothing analytically wrong with that statement.|`|12cYuQ5haa	this is a stupid question because if it goes into many deuces there is no stopping how many points you have to win.

If you need 2 sets to win a game, that means that you already won either 1 set, or 2 sets, or 3 sets.  In order to win a match, you need to win either 2 out of 3, or 3 out of 5, or 4 out of 7 sets.<br>  <br>  Your answer is correct if the match is a 2 out of 3 sets, but if the teacher said you are wrong, you have to assume the other two; either a 3 out of 5, or 4 out 7.  <br>  <br>  If you need 2 sets to win a game and your'e on a best 3 out of 5, you need 72 points.<br>  <br>  If you need 2 sets to win a game and you're on a best 4 out of 7, you need 96 points.

Trajectory is going to be somewhat of an issue, if you go with heavier pellets it will become a major one. <br>  <br>  With any airgun you need to try as many pellets as you can, to find the one that's most accurate...<br>  <br>  **With a 25.0fpe custom model you could use a much heavier 20gr pellet and still get 750fps.|`|wdR8pPH3aa	I like Beeman ramjets myself in my Benji 392.

AA12274507	Any of those is fine. My own personal preference is the Tactical Stock. I ordered a pistol grip for my 500 and I didn't like it at all. I occasionally do perimeter patrols of my property and I found it very uncomfortable as far as trying to control the weapon while doing something as simple as walking in the "ALERT". <br>  <br>    A tactical Stock with a tactical sling and you will be fine. If you are looking for something to pull out from under your pillow and make big holes in your bedroom door with, then the pistol grip will work for you. I found the only use for a pistol grip is if I wanted to make my weapon double as a cane. It is really a matter of personal preference with the grip/stock. Pistol grips are readily available on e-bay for next to nothing. I would get the tactical stock and buy just the grip and put it on and see how you like it. You will easily be able to recover your money on e-bay if you don't like it. Good Luck!|`|YrxLbfiIaa	The best in my opinion is the shotgun with the least amount of add on's and features......<br>  <br>  Pistol grip onlys are not accurate --- They look great in the movies but in reality they are not accurate....<br>  <br>  Tactical stock? -- Those seem a little silly to me -- You aren't doing anything tactical - just trying to take out a couple of home invaders.....<br>  <br>  The road blocker -- Very kool looking but that thing on the end of the barrel can get caught on something.....<br>  <br>  Stick with these 2..... Either the 6 shot regular Cruiser - or the 8 shot Persuader.... I have both and these are reliable and fun to use......
lcpLAS3Kaa	Well a lot depends on how easy going your coaches are. My coaches are very relaxed so the ones who just want to fool around are slower and the ones who work hard win. My friends from other schools say their coaches make them run at least one running event, so they can't do field events only. At my school you can do as few events you like and you get to choose what you want to run/jump/throw. You'll have to practice for awhile to see your running strengths. You could be a sprinter (100 and 200m) a mid-distance (400m and 800m[half mile]) or a distance runner (mile and 2 mile.) If you have good arm strength you will probably have success in shot put and your strong legs may help you in jumping events. Yeah, basically you could be good in any event but you are going to have to try many different things. Do you mean the longest event there is? If so it's the 2 mile or 3200 meter. If you mean in practice it all depends on what events your in. But let me tell you don't say you'll run the 100 meters just so you have less mileage to run in practice. Yes, it may be less to run but sprint sets are tiring. For any event you will most likely run hills to gain leg strength. For the mile district qualifying time in my area is 6:25. I'd say 6:00-6:45 is good. Below six is very good for a Jr. High girl. Just post another question if you need to know anything more!|`|4950a38055e3a23487ed7959fc7378b5aa	Junior high track should be designed to get students interested in running, give them a basic idea of things like form, and help them enjoy being part of a team.  To that end, the expectations of you should be to show up, try hard, and have fun.<br>  <br>  The longest distance in junior high track meets will vary from area to area.  The most common longest race is likely the mile.  Where I grew up, 7th graders only ran the 1200 (one less lap).  Some places may have a 2 mile race.  Talk to the coach.<br>  <br>  As for events, feel free to try them all.  It sounds like you think you would be a distance runner, and that is fine.  But feel free to try a hurdle race, or go throw the discuss.  Some coaches may require you to compete in a field event just to encourage you to try new things.<br>  <br>  Good luck.|`|ZUJ43fGsaa	I'm sorry, I don't really know.<br>  <br>  I'm in 7th grade, I was going to join my schools track team last year but I twisted my ankle right before the day I had to try out but I couldn't.<br>  My walking is a little slowed now so I couldn't try this year.<br>  I suggest you go ask your schools coach or some people who're on the team.|`|M9JESPF9aa	Alright - it was my first indoor track year :D - 10th grade - i got dragged out of marching band to run cause i ran for fun over the summer like crazy- well when you go to high school do cross country- but for now-- the mile is my main event and its around 4 45?  for a girl it should be anywhere from 5 10 to 6 10--- running is hella fun the longest distance is the two mile but idk if they do it in middle school.. try it out it helps out with everything|`|7a4be0ccfeaad7f23fda8c4df26efe8daa	i don't know what events you should do because i don't know your times but try everything and see which ones you are good at or like, the longest depends for me in jr. high it was a mile by it varies<br>  <br>  the expectations aren't as high for jr. high <br>  <br>  <br>  you should do track it is fun|`|1w6m03RNaa	I would say a good mile for an 8th grader is around six minutes. the longest distance is one mile. Because you have strong legs you should try the 100 meter sprint but distance is more fun just try all of them and see which one you like.
nGMJhroEaa	It's great. I've done alot of Kayaking on the Florida Gulf Coast, it's quiet<br>  the water was like glass, you can get out and swim, you really feel like you're part of it and not just watching from a distance and it's a nice workout too. I've also gone with a guide in the Florida Keys which was also great. The guide knew alot and pointed out things I may have missed.

EGe0k8P6aa	To hunt you generally need a license, which means you need to take the hunter safety course in your state/province/shire/etc... There are a couple exceptions to that, but they vary by state to such a degree that its best to just take the hunter safety course and get a license.<br>  <br>  As far as hunting with airguns goes Pyramid Air has done a number of articles and podcasts about airgun hunting:<br>  - <a href="http://www.pyramydair.com/podcast/2007/08/issue-4-hunting-with-airguns-part-1.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.pyramydair.com/podcast/2007/0...</a><br>  - <a href="http://www.pyramydair.com/podcast/2007/08/issue-5-hunting-with-airguns-part-2.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.pyramydair.com/podcast/2007/0...</a><br>  - <a href="http://www.pyramydair.com/podcast/2007/09/issue-6-hunting-with-airguns-part-3.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.pyramydair.com/podcast/2007/0...</a><br>  - <a href="http://www.pyramydair.com/site/articles/" rel="nofollow">http://www.pyramydair.com/site/articles/</a> (mainly dealing with specific guns but it will give you an idea of what people can use for hunting)<br>  <br>  In addition, Jim Chapman maintains a site dedicated to airgun hunting: <br>  <a href="http://www.americanairgunhunter.com/airgun_hunter.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.americanairgunhunter.com/airg...</a><br>  He also writes columns for a number of hunting magazines which have articles about using airguns to hunt various kinds of animals. These magazines include Fur Fish & Game and Predator Extreme.<br>  <br>  Finally American Airguns has a section dedicated to the field use of an airgun (IE hunting) which talks about power levels and offers some suggestions for pellets and equipment: <a href="http://www.airguns.net/general_field_use.php" rel="nofollow">http://www.airguns.net/general_field_use...</a>|`|AA12274507	In most states you need a hunting license to hunt anything. And there are seasons for everything you hunt as well. Like Gray Squirrels can only be hunted Sept-Nov and Oct-Jan. Go to your local wal-mart and see if they have what they call here a Abstracts book. It gives all the hunting info for your state.|`|hBAlVJQaaa	I would go for a 22 cal as the ammo can be purchased easily. Most states require a minimum of 20 cal for hunting small game. You would want a rifle that shoots around 800fps. A scoped  gun is really helpful and a confidence builder. you should be able to pick up a combo package for about $200. Don't forget a hunting license.<br>   Good luck and happy hunting.|`|kEfGVCieaa	the laws in countries differ from place to place but all i know is that in canada the legal limit of your guns velocity of a airgun has to be under 500 F.eet P.er S.second (fps) and if its any faster you have to have a non-restricted license.|`|t6sDVUI4aa	Well the first thing I would say is go take a hunter safety course. And they will tell you the other advice I would tell you is practice airgunning requires extreme accuracy. So practice practice, practice. You want to anchor your quarry with one hit so the Animal does not suffer.

pdQuOHngaa	It is essentially a life vest-- it doesn't matter the size. Sounds like you would be a womens XS or S.|`|92df82e95b3b1086d69d36994ca2effdaa	Snorkel vests are not meant to be life jackets.  They are more or less 2 sizes (adult and child).  Your body will naturally want to float when you are in a snorkeling position.  The vest does two things, when inflated it keeps you a bit higher our of the water (providing a level of comfort) and second gives you that high visibility so that you can be spotted easier.  There are different styles of vest, so are just a bib and some have a little more wrap.  If it feels big, look for one with a crotch strap.  This will run from the bottom of the front between your legs.  This will keep the vest from riding up and makes it feel more secure.  Remember that these are only to add a little more flotation, so one or two breaths of air make a difference.  There is no need to inflate them 100% as then they will be uncomfortable as you will be suspended much farther out of the water than they are designed for.  <br>  <br>  Good luck!

The gun and the ammunition for a 12 ga. is about half what a 10ga. gun and ammunition will cost. Also there are hundreds of different 12ga. slug loads and only a few 10ga. slugs. The 10ga. will not offer longer range than the 12ga. when loaded with slugs. Sure the heavier 10 ga. slug will have more downrange energy, but a 12ga. slug gun is usually more accurate than a 10ga. waterfowl gun loaded with slugs. <br>  <br>  I have a 10ga. NEF single shot. The 10ga. is good for throwing size BBB steel shot at geese that seldom come inside of 50 yards. The 10ga. slug is overkill for whitetail deer and even elk.|`|dpSr0icwaa	I'd go 12 guage.<br>  <br>  The new 12 gauge 3 1/2 inch shells can be loaded to a higher pressure, this makes them equal to the 10 gauge which is forced to operate at lower pressures.<br>  <br>  besides, most hunters who have 3 1/2 chambered 12 guages don't bother with 3 1/2 inch slugs (I don't think they even make them) they just use plain old 2 3/4 or else 3 inch slug loads.|`|DIG1mNzFaa	Hopefully you have strong shoulders that gun will make you wish it was a BB gun prepare for some sore arms & shoulders|`|Ui2WJH4Iaa	20 gauge slug will kill any deer and it shoots flatter.|`|X3tyGKcBaa	A 10 gauge is one hell of a goose gun it well bring down deer but then again so well a howitzer cannon. Back when I was 15 I modifed a singleshot 16 gauge for hunting deer in heavy brush & used slugs <br>  it worked quite while. I don't know where your hunting but diffrent terrain calls for different weapons. I would put the ten gauge at the very bottom of the list but if you have to dubble ot buck mite give you a advanate for a kill in heavy brush. I have found 30.06 to be a good alround gun up to 500 yrds & thats a reach 30 30 not bad brush gun <br>  as 44 mag  hope this helps a little|`|VCPrxDecaa	You are going to bust your shoulder with that gun and probably not enjoy shooting it.  12 gauge is more than adequate for deer and you'll find the ammo sold everywhere, cheaply, and in good variety.  10 gauge ammo is hard to come by and when you find it, it's expensive and might only be waterfowl loads.

sm2RK9Nxaa	Your link isnt working but, i assume that it is the template for next seasons kit, white with the red v??? If it is then its a throwback to the 1909 kit, its commemorating 100 years since Manchester United first won a major trophy.<br>  <br>  Edit. I just saw your link and if that IS the shirt....well i LOVE it, thats the best example ive seen yet as some of the others were down right awful. its nice to see that Nike have actually made a half decent effort with the shirt as in my opinion they have not made us 1 decent shirt yet.<br>  <br>  edit edit!! What do you mean by more consideration??|`|xLyNsywiaa	You should have put a little research in before posting or at least read the comments on the second link. If true, its meant to be a retro- shirt for the 100th anniversary of our first FA Cup win...|`|YrL1xSEOaa	Dear me!I liked the 1909 shirt in the pic but this one looks like it was taken straight off a waiter.I don't think that's real.|`|fLpnC8qtaa	Our shirt shouldn't bother you. You guys didn't put too much thought into your grey kit..lol<br>  <br>  <br>  Commemorative shirt we believe..great idea. I love it :)|`|zmBSnT6iaa	manutd rule|`|EIsnATLxaa	HAHA the designers must have been arsenal supporters|`|duJgBxUoaa	Oh god put it away.!!<br>  <br>  Edit..It was working a minute ago its horrible!!|`|wurimjbnaa	Oh come on, at least make the link real...or are you implying something on United!?|`|uXXbegw5aa	Link don't work<br>  Hahahaha I wonder why|`|bzwSCm6taa	jeez rooney will be even better looking with that on|`|xvuAQ0DAaa	Why should they they know loads of idiots / poseurs will buy it anyway....

John Terry may still turn fit one day!!!!!!!!!!!|`|wurimjbnaa	No, because watching Arsenal makes me sick. I think its quite weird and strange to get sexually aroused by a ball made out of plastic and air. <br>  <br>  Does watching Chelski make you sexually aroused?|`|QDXnM1l6aa	DO YOU REALLY SUPPORT CHELSEA OR ARE YOU JUST WATCHING FOOTBALL BECAUSE YOU LIKE THE PLAYERS AND NOT THEIR SKILLS?<br>  <br>  GROW UP.NO OFFENSE BUT REALLY..........TAKE THE SPORT MORE SERIOUSLY|`|d99GIH9Uaa	Men in shorts :P:P<br>  <br>  Lol,, there's not really any fit lads playing for arsenal though<br>  I sure would if there was though ;P Only Messin lol|`|tIBZ9Gi3aa	I'd freak out if men made me sexually aroused.|`|ojHN65J0aa	hmmm.........<br>  and you call yourself a Chelsea supporter.|`|8yMkjeDdaa	thats why watch them play|`|bNykcEVXaa	NO...You should watch Chelsea more...<br>  <br>  dR bad|`|USuUMIlHaa	They don't<br>  theirry henry's left,I've discovered a lost love-Barcelona|`|WdOAxQmoaa	if you are sexualy aroused...you know where the phone is ;)|`|uUitKmJMaa	Amie you gave me Wilshere syndromme.|`|8QxVjXUxaa	???|`|1WgOj89kaa	Thats kind of strange.

If he doesnt slip he can make it..|`|wurimjbnaa	I think he should try aim for Hiddink's head.|`|d89nMnu6aa	at the end of the day dearest JT had the balls to take a penalty, he missed but if he had to do it all over again he'd be the first one to the manager to say i want to take a penalty, cos he's a great captain<br>  i hope ronaldo gets IBS (irratable bowel syndrome)<br>  <br>  SUPER TERRY, JT number 1|`|zmBSnT6iaa	i think he's gonna score next time|`|RSJbqioUaa	*evils* wanna shut it about JT yet?<br>  I'm one of those who doesn't take criticism well.<br>  <br>  Edit: And I thought you were nice!? I can handle the Chelsea Post Mortems. But not this...not the 21st May 08. Making 15 year old girls upset. I HOPE YOU'RE HAPPY.|`|XU1KaWXwaa	yep about ￡200m strike force and have to win everything on pens...
LReOvHEdaa	Even if Peter Cech and the reserve goalie weren't on  the pitch chelsea would win ?.|`|HKVFVS4qaa	Chelsea would win. But they wouldn't even get to penalty kicks without Ballack. ;-)|`|ZdpaUoteaa	IF?.........well it did"nt!!......and spurs won!!|`|7Tw7s6HSaa	Spurs, they would get their defenders and young boys to miss, again|`|c1wYc2syaa	judging by last week, i agree.|`|tfotPdeZaa	Chelsea would lose.. :)<br>  Terry would slip.. <br>  Spurs can do penatlies. Its just during the Carling Cup the players who usually do penalties werent aviable and Modric chickened out. So if we had Pav, Keane, Defoe, etc. up there then we wouldnt have lost.|`|6aKd0Kcjaa	chelsea can score in a brothel though,but i got to say if they both played in any cup final against each other even the f a vase trophy,it be a sad day for football all over|`|1hvrQYWiaa	Al the finals I remember of Spurs v Chelsea, Chelsea lost<br>  No Keane or Defoe last week, they would have put their pens away|`|2ULsgkVfaa	chelsea|`|wurimjbnaa	Chelsea would win, Spurs can't even score an open goal....|`|oPiDdetWaa	spurs would win|`|zmBSnT6iaa	i would say manutd from out of nowhere because the others are crap|`|oPYw0QYqaa	sigh|`|UZUl0vG8aa	Thats a big IF
6aKd0Kcjaa	1 defeat and it will have the domino effect|`|MUERDKyzaa	Sorry mate, but best manager in the world bounce lasts till end of season lol. But we shall beat them hopefully, somehow if we get past hull in the fa cup.|`|RSJbqioUaa	Hmm...<br>  I'm sure I can find a way to put the "bounce" back into the squad.<br>  I suggest I try it on the newly single Frank ;)|`|wurimjbnaa	Well they said they will aim to win all their remaining fixtures. But they are starting to show weaknesses, so they might start to lose in the FA cup. If not then they might lose the CL.
wurimjbnaa	Oh that video title is wrong because we lost 2-1 and not 2-0....<br>  <br>  And yeah and we will be the next team to beat YOU! Just watch out for us.<br>  <br>  EDIT: Sorry, my bad.|`|Oj9ITMSFaa	Nice one.|`|bNykcEVXaa	We look forward to you beating us at OT.... then mounting a late title challenge... <br>  <br>  dR bad<br>  oh... wait|`|sCehoTIsaa	How dare you bring such shame to answers with such a horrid clip of the great united falling at the emirates|`|4BppP7Mkaa	Good times. Samir Nasri(Y)|`|c1wYc2syaa	So desperate for glory youve got to dig up this old sh1t!|`|LALDdLkNaa	Well technically we have lost to Derby in the carling cup since but as we won on aggregate then yes it was the last proper defeat.<br>  <br>  Nasri scored 2 good goals in that match but I wonder why can't Arsenal play like you did then every week.You lot would be higher up the table for sure if you kept playing like that.|`|AA10997025	I think these two were good too<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TrSZpSHU7Bk&playnext_from=PL&feature=PlayList&p=9B01478A6FC83B41&playnext=1&http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qodg-csJI8Yindex=16" rel="nofollow">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TrSZpSHU7...</a><br>  <br>  and<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VY1IF3zImlY" rel="nofollow">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VY1IF3zIm...</a>|`|uWUyrRFxaa	Yes, I do.

6KZA7D97aa	or.... has barca learned from man u's semi with arsenal that man u  are strong and they need  to do something special to win!! i hope barca win now|`|3JhDWgeHaa	If its anything like the 2nd leg of the semi finals it will be the most boring final ever! I think they will but with man utd attacking power they will want to attack them as well, I think man utd can win the midfield battle, and their attackers ronaldo, rooney, with a bit of pace will cause barca defense probs, with out barcelonas first choise right OR left back, I would have to say I think Man utd have the advantage.|`|v8Q9bs8jaa	i agree....<br>  <br>  well done chelsea you can hold your heads up high and not be ashamed of anything(well maybe underestimating YOUR OWN ability-i'm 100% sure chelsea could have gone to the camp nou and scored)<br>  <br>  i'm not sure but if barcelona play the way they did yesterday man u only have to fear the ref|`|7x4VtGtFaa	Probably Man Utd will use the same tactics they used against Barca in the 2nd leg of semi-finals tie in the 2008 Champions League.|`|eX0YwBA2aa	Go and lie down in a very dark room you're obviously  an idiot!!!|`|UmWfQ6u7aa	thank u for that<br>  yeh i'm disappointed with the ref but he has admitted wrongdoings but its too late now.

6KZA7D97aa	Gallas is better i reckon but i really like Toure, ok i say keep Gallas in|`|QtQoxLkbaa	Tough question. Toure has not played his best this season and Gallas is past his best, although scoring some important goals. I think Wenger really needs to buy a central-defender, otherwise we will be where we are again next season. However, having said that, Senderos is still an Arsenal player and can return to the Emirates. It's quite hard to find a world-class defender now, but we will see. <br>  <br>  Talking about speculations about a transfer that is possible to Arsenal, is Daniele de Rossi (an Italian central defensive midfielder), despite that 40 million pound price-tag slapped onto him. Roma do expect a few players to leave, but I really doubt if Wenger would pay that much.|`|0vzFGWF6aa	i would leave that new defender on bench!!!! Toure and Gallas are great....|`|qwDtjcWkaa	I vote gallas but that's just me|`|UmWfQ6u7aa	gallas<br>  toure is worth 3 of him|`|N7fNwIQSaa	You mean when we buy Per Mertesacker like i said at the start of the season...<br>  <br>  I love King Kolo...but Gallas is better than him but whether Gallas is staying is another matter

795nSfFiaa	HI<br>  <br>  I would simply request that players must serve the entire 2 minutes of a minor penalty regardless of the other team scoring or not.<br>  <br>  It would help with increasing the offensive element of the game that the NHL is currently trying to promote.<br>  <br>  I do love a good  hypocritical answer, guy says go with no touch icing then says stop changing the game. Guess he better hope they approve all his recommendations before the no changing the game one. <br>  <br>  Thank You|`|zzvDybEiaa	1. request Automatic Icing.<br>  2.

a5hNA3Kxaa	These were all business moves, and I will tell you how.<br>  <br>  <br>  WWE going PG- That is a genius idea, sure we may not like it, but with big business like the WWE you have to do what is best for business. The WWE going PG is partially John Cena's fault, he is WWE's top merchandise seller, so once they see these parents buying his merchandise and once they see little kids at live events, they think..."Well our fans over the age of a certain limit know this guy cant wrestle, but a bunch of kids buy his merchandise and we are getting a lot of money" so them going PG is more suitable for parents to let there kids watch.<br>  <br>  Christian's ECW return- This is partially everyone on the Internets fault, Vince knew that it leaked online that he was suppose to be the attacker, and there were Christian chants at Royal Rumble. So Vince had to make his return unexpected, and by that he sent him to ECW, which will also raise its ratings.. so that is smart by the WWE<br>  <br>  ECW-  I heard about ECW being changed to Entertainment Championship Wrestling, since WWE is PG, they cant be extreme, there cannot be any weapons, any blood or any bad language, but instead they made it a place to start off the youngsters and give them the right path to succeed in this business.|`|a45ffb40e1ff08eda37fb35f65c6eecaaa	the pg era is due to all the kids watching wrestling now. i think its due in part to john cena. i am not a cena basher but thats how i feel. the kids have become a huge fan base for wwe, perhaps their biggest. if there were more adult content they would lose that demographic then their parents wouldnt spend the money they spend on wwe stuff for their kids. christian returning is good for ecw. i think ecw wouldve been better if all the originals had not left.|`|b1bb1949f6bd80a6b260437ca822b177aa	yes.  buy t-shirts and video games.  next question...|`|WyPOnZdSaa	WWE, Well Mr McMahon Loves To Piss People Off!|`|b7JS16dyaa	Well, Vince says he knows what we want more than we do... >_><br>  <br>  Christian will likely be drafted, they had to do the PG stuff because of the media's constant attacks, and if anyone expected the old ECW, they were dreaming. There's no way WWE would have done what was done before, they just used it to breed more stars and gain more ratings/money. <br>  <br>  Of course they did all of this on purpose, because "It's all about da MONAY"...|`|19KqIxWjaa	WWE finds it funny that they can do all sorts of stuff to piss their fans off yet they continue to watch.|`|qwdh7N6saa	Christian should be on raw.|`|GJ9z6K1Baa	chrisitan won't be on ecw long..calm ur hormones bruh|`|JiCfYfLraa	i understand like come on wwe get real but i am happy christian returned i dont know whats wrong with you.|`|FNwxcBPpaa	WWE hasn't pissed me off yet.

nBUDjyhgaa	" I "|`|AA11694178	I agree.  I believe the war on  our liberties and freedoms began long before the war on guns.  The war against our Second Ammendment freedoms is only the latest battle in the war to make America a socialist state.  We have won some battles but we are loosing the war.  American is so close to being a fully socialist state that it is almost impossible to tell US from THEM.  Obama will finish taking us there.  Unfortunately, America is populated with the spoiled kids of the 60s, 70s and 80s who think the government should do everything for them and is more than willing to let it take care of them.  They do not want to stand or fall on thier own as our parents and grandparents did.  They want the freedom to do as they please but want the government to be there to catch them if they screw up.  They are willing to surrender the right for which their forefathers fought  and died just to have to government take care of them from womb to tomb.  It is the recipe for socialism and socialism is what we are getting.|`|mOTCr8Pxaa	They have been after us for years. We will not disarm. <br>  <br>  But you voted for obama. Do you regret it yet?

The freaking Chinese and Islamic Fascists don't need to bomb us, all they need to do is mutually plot to put a stranglehold on our petroleum supply; rapidly dump their stock holdings causing a massive drop in the market; drive the economy so far into the ground that it will take years to recover, and then buy up real estate inside the USA. All with some help from the Democrats (circa mid-90s) who passed all the laws allowing for irresponsible credit limits and the GOP (circa mid 00s) who let the corporate gangsters sell out their own countrymen in the name of greed and globalization.<br>  <br>  It's coming folks and the Democrats and Republicans are both steering us toward one big happy planet.|`|bIbyAkHPaa	Yes, and the election of Obama.<br>  <br>  The more you have to depend on the government, the more the government controls you!|`|vuw7xwnbaa	I'm going to get a bumper sticker that says "Told you so".

One of the main political goals of the Liberal political machine is the disarmament of the people. First they start with "assault weapons bans", then bolt actions and scare people by calling them "sniper rifles", then handguns, and finally they will ban rimfire .22's, and finally BB guns and knives. They have succeeded in the UK, Australia, Canada, and many other countries.<br>  Our freedom is at stake, you cannot successfully fight an oppressive totalitarian government with BB guns. The Assault Weapons Ban, federal firearm registration, and the microstamping of all ammunition are their number 1 priority here in America, we must stop them at all costs. Write letters to you Congressmen, your Representatives, donate and join the NRA, and refuse to register your firearms.|`|BGIxDWkZaa	I do agree that an assault on the Second Amendment has been under way for years. I do agree that our police are becoming more para military and less servants of the people. "To protect and serve", my *ss. We as a people are under assault on so many levels it will be hard for us to protect ourselves from all of them. <br>  <br>  Not just the Second Amendment. Personal Freedoms and Liberties are under attack. <br>  <br>  For God's sake they are trying to outlaw tobacco use in your own car and/or home these days. <br>  <br>  The "fat" tax is on it's way to being a reality.<br>  <br>  It's illegal in California to use your fireplace.<br>  <br>  Those clowns in D.C. pass these laws with their own personal agendas behind each one.

I live near Toledo Ohio. Recently the people voted against a levy for the public libraries. So, the fascists in charge just re-evaluated every ones homes. Thus raising the amount of property taxes, without actually raising the tax. Cause they did that the previous year.<br>  <br>  We used to have a work farm/jail in a near by county. A new facility was built. The people were then told they couldn't afford both. Enough people wanted it on the ballot. It appeared on the ballot. The citizens voted to keep both open. The politicians decided the will of the people should be ignored. They closed the work farm. Which of course they still own, and pay taxes on. Which means that part of my tax dollar is still funding something we supposedly cannot afford.<br>  <br>  Get your houses in order. The worst is yet to come.|`|H4dswqRlaa	As I begin typing, the first 5 answers are good, but nobody has yet mentioned that Hitler first registered the guns of hunters, shopkeepers and in locked night bedstands. Then they went around and murdered anyone who had sold any of their guns and couldn't find the receipt in the middle of the night, confiscating everything still in possession. Then nobody could resist the march on Poland, etc. A midnight takeover of a highly developed country in modern times, and nobody speaks of it, much less mention that the same Gnostic Axis Cult is behind the Mafia here and everywhere, and is behind the attempts to disarm America, planning a midnight takeover here as soon as it will work.|`|d718e68db0e03feea7b7b84e8684264daa	This country has been battling gun control since April 18, 1775.

When a select militia is formed, the people in general may be disarmed."<br>  <br>  -John Smilie<br>  <br>  Remember that Mao stated that political power comes from gun ownership, which is why the Government needed to impose gun control, so that the government would control the people and the people could not control the government.<br>  <br>  ALSO, the right to keep and bear arms is one of the defining rights of a free citizen, and the Constitution was amended to prevent that, and the other defining rights, from being taken away from a class of people.|`|Pp3WHtSFaa	The People are the Masters of Both Congress and the Courts not to Overthrow the Government of the United States, but to Overthrow the Men Who Would Pervert it."..<Abraham Lincoln><br>  <br>  hopefully there are enough gun owners left to take a good old fashion stand if need be.

H4dswqRlaa	One old fart to another (I assume), times have changed. Lately generally only handloaders and bulletcasters (hint hint) have or use LSWC. Bulletcasting is fascinating, and if things go wrong politically, it may become our only significant source of bullets. One might even put aside a complete casting setup, even if one has no immediate plans of using it! Perish the thought, but such complete setup kits in nice surplus ammo boxes in the most popular calibers might be an excellent investment. Or a hot sale item this week at the local gunshops. Regards, Larry.|`|itHj9wE9aa	They have  pretty much been replaced by JHP.....your best bet is a gun show.|`|8ivnzNi5aa	I'm just guessing, but maybe it's because so few people have .38's any more, compared to the 9mmP's and .40 S&W's.|`|CFm0u13Paa	There's lots of ammo for sale on GunBroker.com. <br>  <br>  I just bought a case of Federal 38 Special +P Lead SWC HP.|`|AEzJHIz7aa	I think it's just a question of trends and popularity.  Everyone wants to buy "self defense" ammo, and it just has to be jacketed expanding or jacketed frangible rounds.  The gun magazines and tacti-cool idiots with more money than sense have succeeded in altering the market.  Why would you, as a gun store owner, waste shelf space on ammo with a 30% markup, when the masses are standing in line to buy fancier ammo at a 75% markup?|`|K5AeQuSNaa	As the other posters have said, JHPs have more or less replaced it as the standard .38 Special load.  The LSWCs were noted as being poor man-stoppers.  And since people want to practice with something similar to what they would be carrying, the play with JHPs instead of LSWCs.<br>  <br>  That being said, a good LSWC load is hard to beat in terms of accuracy, and they are great for plinking and popping small game.  If you can't find any for sale online, you may have to start rolling your own.  Either casting your own or buying bullets, and then getting a reloading set up to do it.  It isn't rocket science.|`|KDOIKIq2aa	LSWC is still made, but many retailer don't bother to stock it.  Cabela's still sell .38 Special 158 gr LSWC by HSM in bulk.

Since its a east coast show of course there going to have more on the teams from there to.

Start with speed...he has great speed in the outfield and as well as on the bases.  Recovery speed, footwork, and angles are three important things when playing the outfield.  Lastly, he has a cannon for an arm...its hard to believe because he is so small..but he plays right field for a reason...his arm.|`|O45zWBesaa	Ichiro is a solid outfielder with a great arm. He deserves his gold gloves.<br>  <br>  You don't need to be on "webgems" ti be a good fielder.|`|b30195e932765839f31a572f8d05c0f8aa	Ichiro is one of the best defensive outfielders in the game today with a strong and accurate arm from the outfield.|`|6Nw8VnZBaa	he is good he can dive for a ball clim a fence and has a gun for an arm|`|2N6oTOLQaa	Ichiro catches a lot of balls that other outfielders wouldn't get to because of his speed. That's why he wins gold gloves.<br>  <br>  Web gems focus more on diving and sliding catches. You won't see a "web-gem" when I guy is really fast and runs down a fly ball that would usually go for a double, but you might see a web gem where a slow fielder just barely gets there in time to dive and catch a ball that someone else could have caught without having to dive. <br>  <br>  Ichiro also has one of the best arms. He throws really hard and is typically very accurate with his throws. Runners often hold at a base when Ichiro has the ball in situations where they might have tried for the next base if there was a different outfielder, because they know there is a good chance that Ichiro will make a strong accurate throw to get them out if they try.

jK9H6PHiaa	hunting with a gun is a big deal. i can't do it i don't have the patience. but it takes patience and skill. alot of hunters miss totally or when they miss and they hit the deer it's wounded. growing up with my father and brother i was taught even if you wound a deer you have to track it down and put it down so it doesn't suffer. i was also taught not to take a shot unless i knew i could put the animal down.<br>  <br>  the reason for my family not shooting small animals is because a small animal cannot feed a family of 5, a  big deer can. my father just recently got a scope and he still isn't sure of it, he uses it sometimes but other times he doesn't. <br>  <br>  killing an animal is close combat would hardly be successful for most hunters. then we would face the risk of over population. while some people take pride in killing an animal for it's horns i grew up where the body was what counted, the more meat, the longer it would feed us for.<br>  <br>  we're alot like the indians we use every piece of the deer, my dad reuses the horns to help get the attention of other deer when he's hunting, (he rattles them i don't know the term used, kind-of like they're fighting) we use the hide as rugs and blankets and of course we eat the meat. and nearly all of the meat. other people do kill for the horns only and i don't think that's something.

In college football and some high school football leagues, a forfeit is recorded as a 1-0 game.|`|rU7ZjIHKaa	I only know of the "extra point," which is a pinned kick of the ball between the goal posts after a touchdown.|`|51e7baee76cfe5758f817c35c038f4c7aa	A field goal or a safety on a try.<br>  <br>  The safety on a try is extremely rare.  It requires a team to put the ball into their own end zone where it does out of bounds or is declared dead.  Complicating matters is that in the NFL and high school rules, the ball is dead if the defense gains posession.<br>  <br>  Actually, there is a third way.  A forfeited game is recorded as 1-0, unless the winning team is ahead in the game when the forfeit is declared.|`|DjF6Uytuaa	No, only one.<br>  <br>  In the NFL, if the defence recovers the PAT attempt then the play is dead.
8g06tQ61aa	The stereotypical face can be annoying sometimes. Wrestlers like The Rock and Stone Cold went from face to heel and back. Even when they were face, they would sometimes use low blows or eye pokes.<br>  If one of the main faces went heel for awhile, it would be better because it would be a cool plot twist. That is sort of like what they did with Matt Hardy, recently.|`|WQGvE60waa	Good Question.<br>  <br>  I feel that the attitude era made the heel more popular..<br>  <br>  They are not attitude faces.<br>  <br>  The poster boy for the Attitude face is Stone Cold Steve Austin, you can even say WCW had an influential roles in creating a "Good Heel" with Hogan defecting from a baby face to a heel a ot of his loyal fans followed. ...<br>  <br>  Orton and Edge have a good following becuase WWE is over doing the Babyface thing with John Cena.<br>  <br>  People are tired of the babyface now days|`|475ca662f051679937b7c94c642a9d64aa	I know what you mean, these days being a face is all about being really good and not doing dirty moves like a low blow, that you would have seen from the faces back in the attitude era. Being a heel at the moment now is better as you can get to anything and get cheered for it, as it is like having the freedom that you wont see from faces|`|T13xM9iJaa	Well I see what you mean I think Attitude Era  made it cool to be a heel and that is why some heels get cheered like you said me I like a few heels and the few I like are really good at being a heel And just to let you know the heels I like are Randy Orton and Matt Hardy. But only because they make it cool to be a heel.|`|iWcTmuhAaa	Stone Cold and Rock : The both were "Antiheroes" (a line between heel and face).

dBsOqHjsaa	Ahh first to the two obviously female deprived people, Get one thing straight right now! If all our players (American continent) that is north, central, south included were able to make the same money here than in europe believe me all those leagues would suck anal linings. Your players are boring they can run and play the long ball but the majority could not dribble through a defense (pele/maradona) to ease their athletes foot. They are machine like and have uneducated feet, Which is why romario, batistuta, ronaldo (brazilian), kaka, pato,suazo, zamorano, dinho etc... are all  idols in those leagues. I can go on and on with names but the bottom line is european clubs are bloody poachers that exploit countries financial troubles and offer more money to our players. So please do not compare mls to other leagues that have been around for more than 100 years.  Now galaxy fans we have to send our league a message! And that is we will not tolerate benedict arnold type players no matter how much money they or the player make. I rather them pay a young talented no name prospect that can  play above a rich semi retired greyhound. F him and horse he rode in on. He must get booed out of our league and to all those people who just go watch for the name F them too stay away and watch desperate housewives or the jonas brothers instead your money is as filthy as his armani underware. So every true G's fan show your contempt for this prick boo him back under the queen's skirt!! Oh wait dudes wear skirts there too WTF! I know it is a kilt or however you spell it and I mean britain as a whole scotland,wales, england etc!|`|CEoGkoLZaa	the problem is beckham signed for galaxy because  he thought his football career was on the downward slop and like alot of english players when your close to retirement thet go to the like of u.s china and Kuwait to get a last big pay packet and see out there careers in country were the football is of a lower class to the english premiership or la liga in spain or serea in Italy the main reason why beckham went to galaxy was because he retired from INTERNATIONAL football and thought his career was on the way out now he has been accepted back into the england team he need to play and train in a Higher class of football which galaxy cant offere because the skill and level of players oppotion teams and training is in a lower class than the type of football played in Europe and regardless or what you think beckham has given your crappy 3rd rate team la galaxy international publicity which you wouldn't of got without him as the rest of the team wouldn't even rate to semi pro saturday league players in the uk|`|c6d39e78cfedb00968db18e9aaafac51aa	Yes...I will definitely boo him.

UVYEu5Gqaa	I'd go with the Springfield 1911, they may cost a little more but I've never heard of anyone having a problem with them. I bought a Taurus PT1911 and after two sessions of shooting the finish on the grip had worn off, you could see where my fingers had been resting. I took it to the shop where i bought it and they sent it back. I got it back a couple months later with the wrong stuff changed out and it had since RUSTED.<br>  <br>  The accuracy of the PT1911 was lacking compared to the Springfield as well. I don't know what it was, but with Taurus it's almost always hit or miss, and god help you if you have to send something back to Taurus to fix.|`|6f632b3efccb35d4ed39a16093f7a404aa	I'd go with the Springfield if I was you.  They also have a lifetime warranty.  A previous post said that Taurus has one but failed to mention that Springfield does as well.  <br>  <br>  As for whether or not the warranty carries over to a new owner - who cares?  As long as you buy the gun new it makes no difference to you.  Lifetime warranty or not, you can never be sure what you're getting into with a used gun.  Did the last owner care for it properly, who knows?<br>  <br>  That aside, Taurus has been improving in quality, but Springfield has always been up there.  I own a Springfield XD and a good friend of mine has their 1911 GI .45.  Very cool gun.  It looks just like the .45s used in WWII.  He has had no issues whatsoever with his, and my XD has been absolutely flawless - not a single malfunction of any kind.  <br>  <br>  Even though Taurus is improving, they are being noticed for their newer model guns, such as the 24/7 Pro and 24/7 OSS.  So I'm not too sure their 1911s have gotten much better from what they were previously.|`|XnZvlYXWaa	I too think that Taurus is making better pieces today than they were a few years ago.  However, I have two Springfield 1911s.  The only issue I have seen with mine is the screw that holds the Novak sight on would loosen up from the recoil every box or two.  Just a little locktight solved that problem.  Haven't had any other issues with mine. That being said, I still think I would buy a Springfield again before a Taurus.  Hope this helps some.|`|GHD8JicSaa	If you got the training to use a 1911 it really does not matter.   However I think the Springfield XP 45 is the way to go.  Same round as the 1911 but it can carry twice as many.   <br>  <br>  (I do have a 1911 and it is my favorite open carry gun but when it comes to concealed,  having a cocked and locked 1911 just does not work.)|`|wbhqShh6aa	I was thinking about getting a 1911.  I ended up getting a Taurus 24/7 OSS.  It looks similar to the 1911 but I liked the grips better.  Taurus is going to be better price than the Springfield.  I find the quality of the Taurus to be excellent, and anyway they have the lifetime warranty to back it up...lifetime of the gun by the way...even if the gun changes owners the warranty is still good, you cant beat that.  Its all about your personal taste what suits you best.  Sprinfield definitely has a good name and for a reason, but for me personally I couldnt seeing spending extra $$$ when in reality I liked the Taurus better anyway.|`|oX2KsnOQaa	Springfield<br>   Taurus makes excellent revolvers but their semi autos are of poor quality.|`|8MUj24s6aa	Taurus by far....All the bells and whistles without the price.<br>  Lifetime warranty on the gun...Your great grandkids will be able to send it in for repairs. Anybody knocking Taurus never owned one....|`|f3f63c87e27f64c3e9f1679c165409b8aa	In the 1911 frame I'd go with the Taurus.  I have no personal experience but I've heard from numerous people that even though Springfield makes really good guns there 1911's  are some of their poorest quality.

50e3b0849b4360114052f91433a42927aa	yes u can catch monster flatheads in rivers,given the right conditions.i have caught them up to 40lbs.<br>  <br>  i reccomend heavy line 40-60,big hooks,atleast 5/0,and heavy to extra heavy action rods in 7-8ft.i use nothing but penn reels,either 209 or 309<br>  <br>  creek mouths and below damns,as well as laydowns seem to be where i catch most of mine.<br>  <br>  as far as bait,i like to keep it natural.i cast net my own shad and catch bluegill the day before i go.normally i just use the heads of the bluegill,sometimes i will use the whole fish,but i will make cuts in the fish from dorsal to belly.<br>  <br>  good luck,let me know how u do.|`|IEjc4R3Raa	Although there are a couple of exceptions, if you check the state- and world records you'll see that the vast majority of really big cats come out of rivers. <br>  <br>  Trophy catfishing is not the same as going for the everyday-sized eating cats. It takes specialized equipment and know-how. But the results can be very worthwhile.<br>  <br>  For some tips and techniques about catching wall-hanger catfish, check out:|`|KJWxqQHiaa	Rivers are where most trophy flathead's are caught, and lake's don't have small ones either. It's common for flathead's to be 0-20 pounds, and they can get well over 100 lbs. Use a heavy action rod with about 50 lb. test, on a large spinning or baitcasting reel, maybe even a surf reel. Look for deep holes, running into creeks, in heavy brush, that's where the big un's are. Now, the link to Bass Pro's article about catching lunker's is a very good guide. <br>  <br>  For bait, try whole live bullheads, shad, bluegills or small carp.<br>  <br>  Hope i helped ya out.|`|amlmhoUuaa	Try fishing around the dam and use either cut bait or a stink bait.  The reason I say cut bait is because bait fish are trying to swim up stream and they get caught in the current and pulled back through the blades of the dam and it cuts them to pieces and those big catfish sit there and wait for it to come to them.|`|Ok3XlTV3aa	Definitely rivers|`|Rq0Ni0Ncaa	Most definitely in rivers. Try to look for a dam because all kinds of catfish hang around there. I would use a large circle hook with some beef or chicken liver that has been left out for a while to give it a certain smell if you know what I mean. The catfish will go crazy for it. Good luck fishin'!

In the past, there was a 15-over period at the start of an innings when only two fielders were allowed outside the 30-yard circle. This meant that attacking batsmen were likely to score runs quickly in the first 15 overs, because they were able to play aggressive shots likely to result in a boundary at a lower risk of being caught out, but would become more watchful after the end of the spell.<br>  <br>  In an effort to keep the game more exciting during the middle overs, this rule was amended to apply not only to the first 10 overs of every innings, but also in two blocks of five overs, Powerplays, of which one may be used by the fielding captain, and one may be used by the batting captain.<br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  To be more simple, <br>  The first 10 overs of a match are mandatory powerplay overs.

4VoQduaZaa	For any batsman, it is very important to know where his off-stump is. That is the most basic explanation about taking the guard. Everything that he does there onwards is dependent on the guard that he has taken and how accurate that is. He can judge which deliveries are to be played and which ones are to be left alone. Different batsmen are comfortable with different kind of guards. So it is entirely upto an individual as what he wants to do.<br>  <br>  It does not directly relate to conditions on ground or nature of pitch to start with. But many a times, you will see batsman changing the guard to counter odd bounce, direction of bowling or sometimes even based on the field positions and what batsman wants to do next. But the basic purpose is same. To know where your off-stump is.<br>  <br>  When you mark the guard, you obviously are not in position to judge it yourself being so close. But the umpire standing exactly opposite to you can tell you if the stump and guard you are asking for fall in same line or not. Hence, you specify what stump you are planning to take your guard on and then ask the umpire to help you out in taking the correct guard.|`|gIx9Zs2haa	When you arrive at the crease you ask the umpire for a guard. You typically mark the ground with your shoe spike. This is something that you as the batsman use as a reference point. It enables you to understand where your eye is as the ball is delivered. <br>  <br>  When I used to play I would ask for "middle and leg". Others ask for "Leg". It is rare to ask for middle or anything further to the off because that makes you a candidate for LBW decisions because your legs are more in front of the wickets.|`|AA11088802	they ask about stump.. where he would place his bat blade|`|SWxnbKyyaa	From my little experience of playing cricket, marking guard means marking a line on the batting crease,a line drawn in line with one of the wickets(off,middle and leg) or in between them, which enables you take you initial stance<br>  <br>  So there are different spots of marking-- leg stump,between middle and leg,middle,of course between middle and off and off is not usually recommended as it could expose you leg stumps as you play<br>  <br>  While marking your guard, you are not in the best position  to judge and mark such a line,only the umpire is in the best position to say, so you use the help of an umpire to mark your guard

HysoZOT1aa	Hi Nory,<br>  <br>  When asking others for recommendations for summer camps, you might consider adding what you think is fun.  Do you like horseback riding? Swimming? Arts & Crafts? Rock Climbing?  Other people might think something is fun that you don't.<br>  <br>  Also, do you want a camp near you or are you willing to travel?<br>  <br>  The American Camp Association is a large non-profit group that accredits camps and has a great web site that you can use to search for camps.  You can ask their search engine for a list of camps in your area, if you want to limit your search to camps close by.  You can also ask it to find camps with the particular activities you find interesting.<br>  <br>  Their web site is www.ACACamps.org<br>  <br>  There are also other directories.  I personally don't like them quite as much because generally they sell listings to camps.  If a camp (possibly one you'd like) doesn't pay, then it might not be included in their directory, or be at the end of a very long list.<br>  <br>  I've written an article on how to choose a camp that's right for you, if you're interested.  I'll put the link below.<br>  <br>  Lastly, a little self promotion.  If you like wilderness adventure activities, please take a look at my camp.  We're in California, so it might be too far away.  Anyway, we have a rather unique guarantee:  if you don't have fun, we'll refund your tuition!<br>  <br>  Hope that helps without being too spamy!<br>  <br>  Scott|`|nj5uqFFLaa	in the midwest, there is a camp called Miniwanca.

I heard of this comparison earlier and saw Campbell fight for the first time during his most recent match... I don't think so.  I think Pac vs Kirkland somewhere between 140-150 would be more interesting.<br>  <br>  Pac will be too much for Hatton.  The only way Hatton will win is if he can cut or outlast him, but I don't think Pac will run out of gas or sit there and get hit.  Pac's MUCH too fast..that's the advantage of the speed.|`|0S0wRN0haa	Manny is too much for Nate, He is too fast to strong and would be able to handel any shot nate would dish out. and I think Pac man wins by just a lil over Hatton.|`|sMoAqV7Jaa	Manny would slaughter Nate.
tTVS5oYzaa	No Hossa is not out for the season.  His knee was actually more of an issue in the days after the collision into the boards than his neck.  His knee stiffened up on the plane ride to Colorado but felt better a few days later.  He was at practice today and hopes to back for Thursday's game against Calgary.<br>  <br>  And to all those Pens fans calling him a traitor....come off it.  You had the guy for only 12 games and the playoffs.  Its not like he was a long time Penguin, he was a hired gun and the team new that.  Thats why Atlanta traded him because he was gonna be a free agent.  Its just sour grapes that your team isnt as strong without him or the other players lost to free agency and that Crosby and Malkin cant do it all.|`|x7NtYD8Aaa	Wow, to think some people can be so cold hearted to hope a guy is paralyzed.Thats pretty cold.

v2BC30KAaa	Honestly, I think that as much as you think you are better than people, it's ultimately the coaches decision. As many times as you say you are better than them, it doesn't mean it's true. I think that if you love it, keep playing. Try out elsewhere. As for the 6'4 person, the coach ultimately saw potential in them and decided that they could be changed into someone reallly good. My apologies for the harsh comments. Good luck.|`|3lsL9YWHaa	you should try again, and then if you have an ishue, like you didn't get on the team, see if the other kids or people, could sign a paper asking for the prensible to show up at another try out thing so they could see if there is something going onish.|`|PJQ1Nm1Oaa	When coaches pick a team, they do not just look at how good you are.   Making cuts is one of the hardest things a coach can do, trust me.  I used to hate when coaches said that, because I never believed them.  When I started coaching, I realized that is sucks to cut someone from the team.  <br>  <br>  Your attitude and potential, among other things are looked at.  If you went into tryouts thinking that you are better than everyone else, I'm not saying you did, the coach may have picked up on that.  If during a drill the coach tried to tell you to do something differently and didn't, the coach notices.  <br>  <br>  The coaches notice a lot of things that go on in practice, maybe you weren't getting a long with a lot of the other players in tryouts, maybe the coach knows that you are not that great of a student. Again I don't know you so I am just trying to think of some reasons why coaches cut players.  Ask the coach if there is anything that you can work on for next season so that you can get better.  <br>  <br>  Remember playing a sport for your school is a privilege and not a right, go in with a positive attitude, listen to the coach, make sure you get along with the other players, and most importantly you are a student-athlete.  Academics come before any sports. <br>  <br>  As for the 6'4" guy, you can teach someone how to hit, pass, set, block, etc... But you can't teach height.  That is why he was asked to play.  If the coach knows him from another sport or gym or just around the halls and tries to get him to play is perfectly OK.  In fact some schools need to do that just to get enough people to have a team.   <br>  <br>  Good luck, ask the coach what you can do for next year and keep practicing.|`|pkRtoJruaa	Okay first off,<br>  Even if you are as great as you say you are,<br>  Do you honestly want to be on a team, where the coach hates you?<br>  NO!! you'll hardly play!<br>  <br>  And the 6'4" guy, they wanted him for his height.<br>  TRUST ME!!<br>  <br>  What grade are you in anyway?

hxQaqSvkaa	Decide which type of team you want to have. High school teams are the most common and are typically used to support the school's sports teams at games, pep rallies and media events. Collegiate cheerleading includes supporting school spirit but also adds a greater level of difficulty. <br>  Step2<br>  Join a cheerleading association. You have a variety of options to consider as most associations host competitions and summer/holiday camps for their members. Most squads join associations to gain access to the latest safety guidelines and regulations. <br>  Step3<br>  Purchase the essentials. Cheerleaders need uniforms with a school or team logo on them. Part of the uniform is a short skirt with matching bloomers (or briefs) underneath, a sweater or shell top, cheerleading shoes and pom poms. <br>  Step4<br>  Develop your routine. The easiest way to begin is to create a series of chants. Chants follow a rhythmic counting like "1-2-3-4, 1-2-3-4" or "1-2-3, 1-2-3". Each count can be an arm movement, a clap or a leg movement, so listen and watch other squads perform chants to get a better idea of what they sound and look like. <br>  Step5<br>  Start a newsletter for parents to stay up to date on plans and upcoming events or changes. An economical solution would be to start a team website. <br>  Step6<br>  Purchase a cheerleading video such as "Cheer" at Amazon (See Resources below) to learn basic cheers, chants and moves. <br>  Step7<br>  Read "The Ultimate Guide to Cheerleading" for steps needed to start your own team (see Resources below). <br>  <br>  Tips & Warnings<br>  Ask family or friends to volunteer their services to maintain the website or produce a newsletter.|`|ifdPm7dbaa	you can go talk to your counselor or talk to your principle about it and ask a teacher to coach it or supervise and post a poster up so people can sign up.
bT2J0tK0aa	definitely rollins hes the better overall player.|`|0dg9JtfNaa	teixeira will get you better numbers, but i would take rollins. he should be the #2 ss. and there will probably be a reasonably sized gap between #2 ss and #3 ss. where as with teixeira, there a plenty of good 1b/3b out there that will give you comparable numbers.

UEA28FiGaa	i ran the 400m a couple of years ago which is like the toughest race. try and build up your stamina by going for regular jogs around ur neighbourhood, and it should get noticably easier quickly. Then try running round a field or track thats about 400m by pushing yourself and timing each time you do it. always make sure you run at an even pace and practise with a sprint finish in the last 50m. you say that by 150m you slow down so why dont u try running slower but saving a burst of energy for the last 40m or so and sprint. just push yourself as hard as you can, even if you do feel rough afterwards. i hope it all goes good for you, just remember it's totally worth it.
iereIxUhaa	Hey I run the 200 hundred too and the # 1 trick to that race is beat the turn but dont kill it. You wanna really angle your body toward the middle of the track when running the curve and when you do that open your lungs and fill them up because everything after the turn you just have to pushh and even go past the finish line. <br>  <br>  Okay uhm train on your legs mainly and your body strength to gain stamina and its better for sprinters. Go to the gym every 4 days or 3 days a week and go to the track every 5 days. Its just a matter of how bad you want it. TRAINING IS THE #1 THING.

vi1bbvCXaa	kickboxing has not grades or belts in it. u may see it a lot of places have their own grading system and belt but traditional kickboxing does not grade or get belt. people make it up to award their students and also to classify which level they are at. there is step to step but different academy has different belt. what i know is it usually start with white and end with black.|`|LPO8RlVdaa	I have said this before to many people, kick boxing is a sport, it is not an art in and of itself, so does not have a ranking system like karate or jiu jitsu for example. If your club teaches 'kick boxing' and offers gradings, then it is likely it is something your 'teacher' has added to his syllabus, it is not a traditional dojo.|`|dc6f042f0a1f241b0647713f95aefc3aaa	You do realize that if you are earning belts in kickboxing then you are being misled right? Kickboxing does not have a belt system and anyone who put one in is lying to the general public because kickboxing is just another sport using some martial art techniques. It is not a martial art all. Go back to your instructor and give him the belt back, leave and find a real martial art school.|`|KzXv8ZKEaa	kick boxing IS NOT a martial art.|`|AA11066099	Hi, ask your Kru.x

nNRRNlPcaa	I was reading this and this made me log it. To you people above me SHUT UP about the animals.<br>  <br>  <br>  12 is good. Remington 870's are great shotguns.|`|Ok3XlTV3aa	12 gauge is the most versatile but if you want to shoot high volume get a 20 gauge, you can do all the same things with it but the lessened recoil makes it easier to shoot a lot.|`|N6rHtZ4qaa	any good quality 12bore. Important is your own skill and instincts. and how you train yourself and stamina etc.|`|PnS3wHQiaa	Depends on what you're using it for.|`|TBAfpnmgaa	The 12 gauge has the biggest selection of loads and shot sizes, has more punch, and can reach further. The 20 gauge is a good alternative for smaller or younger hunters because the recoil is less. The .410 is a great gun for kids from the standpoint of low recoil, but the small loads and limited range make it harder for an inexperienced hunter to make a kill. I have both 12's and a .410 (as well as a 16 gauge) and I like to hunt doves. I use the 12 when I'm serious about putting doves in the bag, but I also like the challenge of the .410.|`|AVQzBE0daa	Each guage has a purpose for which it excels at.<br>  10 guage is often a waterfowlers choice, 12 is the most common shotgun guage for slug hunting deer, 20 guage is a great upland guage, and .410 is a great gun to start a youngster with it also makes a great small game gun.<br>  That is not to say you cannot hunt geese with a .410 (do they make non-lead .410 shells?), it is just not the best shot gun guage for the job.|`|Ucbnl7VJaa	Overall the 12 is the most versatile. A good shooter with a 20ga 3" Magnum with different barrels/chokes can do at least 90% of what a 12 3 1/2" magnum and over 95% of a 12ga 3" can.

If you will use it to hunt and for self defense...then go 12 gauge. With the right ammo and choke tube you can do anything you want. If it is only for hunting then go 20, the ammo is cheaper and most 20's are actually designed fro hunting. As for .410 that's really more of a varmint round and not much else. So look at what your needs are and then go from there. I use a modified Mossberg 500, it was cheap and it's a work horse its not pretty but it gets the job done.

Although they are still a pretty good team they aren't as good as the past<br>  <br>  This is a tough one, but I would have to go with San Antonio, because they might be one of the oldest teams in the league, but I think they could win a playoff series against the Denver Nuggets. Denver is a good team but they are inconsistent, and have players that I think can't take on the Spurs<br>  <br>  Houston Rockets because this is my team, and because we have more experience than the Blazers. The Rockets have more veterans than the Blazers and I think they could win a playoff series against them, even if it does mean to get out of the first round. They need to suck it up and stop choking and make their fans proud.<br>  <br>  Even though it kills me to say this I think the Utah Jazz will win a playoff series against the Hornets. Simply because the Jazz are a better team. I like the Hornets and Chris Paul, but I don't think they would last a playoff series against Utah. Utah is a very deep team, like the Lakers, Rockets, and Cavaliers. <br>  <br>  That was very hard to do because I admit I'm pretty biased.<br>  <br>  Rockets 2008-09 Champions|`|WlTTrx8aaa	lakers:4-0series sweep( T_T and im a deep mavs fan)<br>  nuggets:4-3<br>  blazers:4-2or 4-3<br>  jazz:4-1|`|Vi5gtdQ4aa	Lakers<br>  Spurs<br>  Rockets<br>  Hornets<br>  <br>  ---------------<br>  <br>  Spurs<br>  Hornets<br>  <br>  ---------------<br>  <br>  Hornets|`|nn23p1pSaa	Lakers<br>  Spurs<br>  Trail Blazers<br>  Hornets|`|XDTNSPO2aa	lakers|`|spKtknvAaa	Lakers <br>  Spurs <br>  Blazers <br>  Jazz|`|7ADHptSaaa	Falcons....i know but home team!|`|21J0IIZbaa	Lakers 4-0<br>  Spurs 4-2<br>  Blazers 4-3<br>  Hornets 4-2|`|VHphDgrhaa	Lakers<br>  Spurs<br>  Blazers<br>  Hornets<br>  <br>  then<br>  <br>  Spurs<br>  Hornets<br>  <br>  then <br>  <br>  Hornets|`|MPz9APZDaa	LA Lakers vs. Dallas Mavericks- I say Lakers, the Mavs haven't really played us well this year, plus they got no one that can at least hold Kobe down for tough shots. Plus Bynum should be back by then and Mavs can't guard the twin towers. <br>  <br>  San Antonio Spurs vs. Denver Nuggets- I say Spurs, this team is really experienced and is still really good defensively, if Nuggets had AI this series would be done for the Nuggets, but since they got Billups I think they can make it tough on the Spurs because Billups brings the playoff experience and has really helped the Nuggets play defense. <br>  <br>  Houston Rockets vs. Portland Trail Blazers-  If this is gonna be the match up I finally beleive Houston will come out of the 1st round this season. The Rockets are a really good defensive team and they are going against a very unexpiernced team, but it will be interesting, the Blazers are a really good team. <br>  <br>  Utah Jazz vs. New Orleans Hornets- Wow, this would be great! Chris Paul versus Deron Williams at he point guard position. Utah has home court advantage in this one right? So I'll take the Jazz in seven, since it's really tough to win @ their place. <br>  <br>  This years NBA playoffs will be so interesting. Since all the teams are really scattered around this season.

There wasn't much down time at all.<br>  <br>  I had Jackson losing the first round, because Jardine was landing a lot of kicks and really controlling the direction of the fight.  <br>  <br>  In the second round Rampage backed Jardine up several times, then floored Jardine with a really hard left hook, much like the one he knocked Wanderlei Silva out with.  Rampage took an accidental groin shot from Jardine, but he came back and finished the round strong scoring the better of the striking exchanges.<br>  <br>  In the third round Jardine looked a little tired, but he still got some good shots in on Jackson.  Jackson had two really nice looking double leg take downs, that both awarded him grappling points and gave him an opportunity to punch Jardine on the ground.  Towards the end of the third, Jardine knew he was behind and started landing some pretty good punches, but he missed with an exhausted leg kick.  Jackson finished strong landing a barrage of combos in the last seconds of the fight.<br>  <br>  I was really impressed with how confident both fighters were, how active they were, how aggressive they were, and how hard they worked.  Jackson's timing was impeccable and I was impressed as hell with Jardine's ability to take probably a dozen different shots through out the fight that would've knocked another opponent out.  Jardine really came back and answered some of the older concerns about his chin by surviving the whole fight.<br>  <br>  Rampage definitely deserved the unanimous win.  Had it been five rounds, I think he could have finished it.|`|0918eb31ce1520001d965c6085d6abc5aa	Rampage BARELY pulled out a decision.

HkMhWvtgaa	Well, for one thing, there are a lot of things that can go wrong in the wild besides snakes, so I think you'll find that this trip requires more preparation than you might have done already.<br>  <br>  If you had just said, "I'm lucky enough to have a summer when I don't have any responsibilities, so I'd like to enjoy it by doing a lot of camping," I'd probably say, "Lucky you!  Make sure you know what you're doing, and have a good time."  The fact that you mention wanting to write a book about it,  however, makes me want to point out something else:<br>  <br>  Most writers want to sell their book to a publisher, especially after investing months of their lives just in preparing the journal from which they'll later take more months (or years) to write the book.  Young men who want to write books about their "fascinating journey of self-discovery in the wilderness" come a dime a dozen.  This endeavor is fairly meaningless, and not even very unusual.  In other words, your book proposal is nothing special, and is highly unlikely to sell.<br>  <br>  Instead, I suggest you think of the men of the past who wrote books about finding themselves in the wilderness.  For most of them, camping out in the wilderness was only incidental to a bigger adventure in pursuit of some specific goal, such as surveying unmapped territory, preaching a religion to "savages", escaping persecution, or even something as crass as searching for gold.  They didn't necessarily achieve that goal, but the goal gave shape to their journey.  It wasn't simply "go out in the woods and survive."  That's just, well, "being a bum with no responsibilities for the summer."  Great for recreation, but nothing anybody wants to read about, let alone pay their hard-earned money to read about.  (Do you want to spend thirty bucks for the hardcover edition of your uncle's golfing vacation in Florida?)<br>  <br>  What can you ACCOMPLISH this summer?  These days, a search for gold is not what sells.  People like stories of generous souls and self-sacrifice.  Start a basketball league for inner city teens?  Hike across a depressed region of the country collecting enough aluminum cans along the roadside to sell to a recycler and stock a church's food pantry?  Log wildlife sightings for a grad student's doctoral research?  Organize camping trips for disabled kids who otherwise would never have seen the wilderness?  Make a plan, and make an effort.  You may not accomplish everything you set out to do, but in the process, you'll have learned a lot about yourself, and if you've kept a good journal, you'll be able to get a book out of it.  I'm not promising that it will sell, but it will certainly have a better chance than the story of yet another kid who thinks anyone else cares about his summer vacation.  <br>  <br>  By the way, one of the many young men who had your exact same plan (spend the summer "surviving" in the wilderness, keep a journal, write a book) really did get into a book, though not one he'd written:  "Into the Wild" tells the story of Chris McCandless, who starved to death in an abandoned school bus not terribly far into the Alaskan wilderness.  Kind of a big price to pay to make the book interesting enough to sell!|`|LjqoMHMJaa	The only time I was really scared was at Philmont Scout Ranch in New Mexico. I was in the most populated canyon of pumas in the US. I didn't see one cat that entire trip and it was 14 days long.|`|qyATAaeXaa	LMAO...I love this whole "Survival" need people seem to have. OK...Illinois...The Shawnee National Forest...right? You're like what, no less than 5 miles from any highway when in the designated Wilderness Areas. And you are worried about snakes....Hahaha. <br>  <br>  Did you drop out of Cub Scouts? What do you propose to do about the snakes anyway? Kill one? Do you even know which ones are poisonous? Can you identify them? Jeeze...if you can identify them then you must have some sort of guidebook or webpage that also tells you about their habits and what to watch out for as well as how to act.<br>  <br>  Do us, and yourself a favor, do some research and get some basic experience before you go out and plague the wilderness. Speak to one of the Forest Rangers when you go to tell them where you are camping. They'd like to know in the event there is a forest fire and they have to evac you out...or you get eaten by a coyote and don't come back in 2 weeks...that way they at least they know where to look for your body. Maybe the Rangers can tell you exactly what to do when you encounter a snake.<br>  <br>  Failing that...why don't you look up info on the web or get a book. Too many people overreact to snakes in general then when they see a poisonous one they really freak..that's usually when they get bit as well.|`|mMFJrPbvaa	Well I`d suggest knowing the skills in the BSA Field Manual like the back of your hand before you go to "survive" in the "Wilderness".<br>  <br>  Also, before you get your gear together and strap on your boots I`d read "Into the Wild" by Jon Krakauer It`s about a young man, Chris McCandless aka Alexander Supertramp, who drops out of College and decides to leave society and live in the wilderness of Alaska. Jon wrote the book based on Chris' memoirs found in his shelter and based on interviews with people who Chris interacted with along his travels.<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Into-Wild-Jon-Krakauer/dp/0385486804" rel="nofollow">http://www.amazon.com/Into-Wild-Jon-Krak...</a><br>  <br>  As for the snakes, I wouldn`t worry too about them.  I`m sure you are quite capable of doing research on the evil and dangerous snakes in your neck of the woods.<br>  <br>  I laugh when I hear "wilderness" spewed on here as if one can get lost for weeks or months.  If you follow woods sense, common sense but for the outdoors, then any "wilderness" wont be daunting.  Did you know that the most REMOTE spot in the lower 48 states is only 22 miles from any road or civilization, and its inside Yosemite Nat`l Park.  So you will not be more than 22 miles from any form of civilization if you stay within the lower 48 states. Just let the rangers know where you are planning on going and leave your itinerary with a friend or family member. Do yourself a favor an purchase a map of the area and learn to use it with a compass.  This way you can get yourself out and hike the few miles out of the wilderness. Here is the article on it, click the link for the extended version to view the stats containing the 22 mile quote.  <a href="http://www.backpacker.com/september_08_destination_nowhere/articles/12566" rel="nofollow">http://www.backpacker.com/september_08_d...</a>|`|3Twg9Uuuaa	Go young man, go and experience it all.

Don't let what other people say divert you from your dreams. You are very lucky to have the chance to spend the summer in the woods. Just be smart about it an research what you are planning to do. The fact that you are asking a question here about a concern you have is a good start.<br>  <br>  To answer your question about snakes... I'm with you I've been terrified of them for as long as I can remember. The key is exposure. I've gotten to where I can see a snake on the trail and kind of detach myself and just observe it. After the fact my skin kind of crawls but I deal with it. Just leave the snake alone and let it go along it's way and then you can go along yours, and for God's sake don't go acting like Bear Grylls, the man's going to get himself killed someday.|`|FgTkF31iaa	Snakes are the least of your problems.If you aren' t stupid snakes won't bother you.If you are going to try survival camping best if you do a lot of weekend trips first to learn your needed skills, also read read read  everything from the Boy Scout Field Manual to how to fish and hunt and trap also find out how legal it is to take game other then fish where you will be going..  Next read up on plants eating wild food is a dangerous business you really have to know  I mean really know what you looking at or you will end up  sick or DEAD!!!  If you are going by yourself make sure the rangers know you are in there and how to contact someone to make sure you made it out.This type of trip isn't a lark enjoy but  go in prepared.|`|RqKh8ztQaa	you should be fine...<br>  snakes don't attack unless provoked or threatened so as long as you don't do anything stupid in the off chance that you do encounter one nothing will happen. If you do encounter one just remain calm and don't make sudden movements and it will pass eventually.<br>  <br>  also if you stick to predetermined camping locations the likelyhood that you will encounter a snake is even less...at that poisonous ones.|`|CFQbdDRNaa	Look Dave, when it's your time , it's your time..O.K. in the mean time just be carefull...it'll be ok!|`|wxEqpMrEaa	Look, I'll be easier to you than the rest of the guys.

qyATAaeXaa	If you collect firewood on a daily basis instead of stacking 2 weeks worth in one shot you can avoid snakes from taking up residence in your woodpile. Since you are going to be in the woods 24/7 for 2 weeks I'm sure you can carve out 45-60 minutes a day to scrounge up the wood you need for the next 24 hours. <br>  <br>  By the way, it is you who are in the snakes' home. They can go wherever they want.|`|3Twg9Uuuaa	From a famous line in Indiana Jones;<br>  <br>  Snakes! I hate snakes why does it always have to be Snakes!?|`|HkMhWvtgaa	Willie D makes a good point about not keeping too large of a woodpile all at once.  But even apart from the woodpile, if you are going to be in the woods, you need to be aware of the possbility of encountering snakes.  Look before you put your hand (or any other part of your body) into a space, and when you see a snake, move away slowly.  Snakes don't bite an adult human because they think they can eat it.  They bite because they fear they are under attack.  Sudden, jerky moves may scare the snake into biting you.  If they're not scared, you're going to be fine.<br>  <br>  I am curious:  I noticed in another question that you mentioned having done a lot of "survival-style" camping, but you also sound disproportionately worried about snakes.  After all, there are many other dangers in the wilderness, some far more common than snakebite.  Have you had a recent bad experience that has made you especially concerned about this specific danger, such as a close encounter with a cottonmouth in an area where you plan to camp soon?|`|wxEqpMrEaa	The best thing you can do is probably clear the area that you will be camping in. "Sweep" the leaves and sticks out from around your camping site so that there is only bare ground. I don't know why, but it seems that snakes would rather go through leaves than open ground. I'm not saying that this will stop them, but it's one method. Stack the wood away from camp, maybe the end of it where you won't be going near so much. At any rate, have fun and enjoy.|`|mMFJrPbvaa	Mann snakes are my last worry when I`m camping.  As long as you don't startle them or harass them they wont bother you.  I`d be more concerned about knowing wilderness 1st aid, orienteering skills, how to hang a bear bag, and how to handle larger predators. <br>  <br>  If I`m not mistaken hypothermia kills more people in a year than snake bites.  Which should you be more concerned about?  <br>  <br>  If you are really that worried you can do some extended camping in Ireland and stack a months worth of woods without having to worry about snakes, but then there are those leprechauns|`|O3Yx21WMaa	Usually snakes are attracted to areas where there are allot of rodents - that's usually there natural food - be careful with the food you bring in which would attract rodents.|`|8NEigOSMaa	It would depend on where you are, as well as the time of year. In some places there are few to no snakes. In others, there are many snakes. I would say keep some Kindling nearby, and some larger stuff a little farther away. Also, a nice fire may just keep the snakes away. Personally, I don't have much snake experience, mainly because of the places  and time of year I camp, but that is probably what I would do.|`|rV4uJVWmaa	Circle your camp with a small line of sulfur, with a mothball here and there. Ive even seen snake nets at sporting good stores. I really wouldnt worry to much about it though.

Actually, you will be able to better slide across the wave if you start swimming, and swimming fast, right in front of where you think the wave is going to break  Some guys wear swim fins to help add take-off speed. Body surfing, body (or Boogie) boarding and surfing all use the same principles.

e26a6d1bc492d2de7a8edcc3478c5300aa	As I've stated on Martin Rogers Blog: They should forgive those for they not know what they do and forget about ever playing this event again in life.  And y'all crack me up throwing in there how blacks need to let bygones be bygones.  No we need to hold grudges like the Holocaust Survivors and like the Republicans outraged at Obama, and we need continue to be unrelenting until change for the better appears and becomes something one can rely on.|`|HNnVrvCfaa	I think that the sisters forget that it wasn't the tournament that forced the crowd to react in the way that they did - it was the crowd on that day.  I don't blame them for being mad (the crowd) and booing and I refuse to believe that it was in any way racially motivated.  I do think it must be awful to have that many people reacting badly towards you though BUT the sisters are so much older now and have developed thicker skins.  They should go back to Indian Wells if only to settle their inner selves! If they don't go then I sincerely hope that they are penalised - any other player would be and they have no real reason not to go.  It's a farce.  <br>  <br>  As an atheist I don't really see what their religion has to do with the matter - it is not a matter of forgiveness or humility, it is a matter of stubbornness.|`|MIAbLr4Vaa	i know that i will get a lots of thumbs downs or my answer will be deleted but i will answer:why you guys even cares if this girls plays in Indian Wells or not?i don't know how many times i saw questions here on Y/A from people saying that they don't like the williams sisters, the are unpleasant,they are never humble,they want them to loose if they play...Sometimes i don't event want to hear the comments of some women commentators (like carillo,pamela shriver,tracey austin) because they always take this girls down,so why you Guys even care?i am more a fan of venus but it doesn't bother me if they don't play in Indian Wells because i know that they will play some other Tournaments..Now it's up to WTA to punished them or not and i think that they lost some points this week in the WTA Ranking|`|9hC7bbf7aa	I agree 120% with abdiver1. Yes, the booing from the spectators was not motivated by any racial intention. They were unhappy about Venus' late injury withdrawal from the tournament. And they expected to see a great match which they had paid for ? There are always two sides of the story, depends on how one perceives.  Mr. Williams, Serena, Venus had received it as a racial, it's absolutely biased opinion of them.  Both Venus, Serena were very young, but Mr.Williams ? Nay ! Whatever..it's been a way over due for the sisters to forgive and forget for they are ADULTS now. Now,Larry Scott made a soft deal for the sisters to participate in promotional events so they will not be penalized ? Come on !! Jehovah or true sportsmanship will say, FORGIVE, IMO. Look at what the Israeli team had done in Sweden ? against all of ridiculous bigotry ? They played in front of 100 some invitees only, and they won the tight 5 set matches against all odds.  I'd call that a true sportsmanship ! Pardon my long winded answer...|`|vFX2DPdIaa	My Lord Jehovah ask us to be meek, not WEAK.  He did not give them a spirit of fear, but of love and a sound mind.  They have a love for the game and will not be tricked into thinking that Indian Wells give a good damn about them now.<br>  <br>  for abdiver1:  Venus and Serena have shown maturity and class.  They try to forget about the past at Indian Wells and every other place they played when they were younger and <br>  ostracized even by players.  <br>  <br>  But how can they when there is a microphone stuck in their faces 24/7 about Indian Wells.  And it is bleeped on these posts constantly.  They probably don't even think about this.  Is it too much to believe that they have so many other things going on in their lives, they don't dwell on the past as we do?<br>  <br>  <br>  and oh yeah,  Wtf has this to do with a black president who is half white.<br>  <br>  Budda on the move-------I'd give you high fives|`|aTBs7pJ4aa	yes i agree they should forgive and forget.. but in regards to what? what kind of a question are u asking here?<br>  <br>  in regards to religion i assume johovah would want the same..|`|CnNAOoWgaa	I agree, they should forgive and forget.  Its been 8 years now, how long can they hold a grudge for?  And is holding this kind of vendetta really in the best interests of the religion they profess to follow?  That teaches forgiveness of others and turning the other cheek?  BTW, that alleged racist incident was confirmed by absolutely no one but them and their father.  It may just completely be in their heads.  Nevertheless its time for them to show some maturity and class, forget about the past, and move on.  This country has embraced black people by electing the first black president.  Its time for black people to do the same back and let bygones be bygones.|`|pYieTvDqaa	I agree with Venus and Serena needing to forgive and forget now after eight years, there not kids anymore there adults and they should know now at their ages that there will always be people with something to say about them, but their opinion of themselves is what matters most. I do not remember seeing them play Indian Wells eight years ago when they were booed, but from what I hear them and their father believe it was racially motivated, others say people were upset because I believe Venus pulled out with a last minute injury and people paid good money to see a great match and probably were upset and felt their money was wasted. Honestly I believe part of it could have been racially motivated and the other is just anger for money wasted. But either way now the sisters are required to play Indian Wells and even if a couple of idiots boo them they have far more money and talent than any of those moron's booing them will ever have in their lifetime so if I were them I would go there with my head held high and ready to play and get it over with and I hope they meet in the finals and give the people their money's worth so we can all move on.
VBSURuKtaa	Dear "Lt. Undersecretary Brian Howell III",<br>              This was not an "Inquiry into the piracy of movies." there are a lot of places on the internet where you can download snowboard movies perfectly legally, for example, one company put an entire snowboard movie up on its website for free download. He was simply asking where he could watch snowboarding movies on the internet or download them. He made no specifics into how that was to be done, or whether it would be illegal. It is my belief that with a halfway decent defense lawyer, your complaint would not hold up in court.<br>  <br>  I am going to have to add that it is unlikely that you are a true FBI agent, due to another answer post that you have on this site, namely this: <a href="http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index;_ylt=AhXYmL6uQgiLeNc3N84XvtDsy6IX;_ylv=3?qid=20090309170707AAoR91X&show=7#profile-info-BqSQQF0jaa">http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index;...</a><br>  <br>  I find it hard to believe that the FBI would commission one of its agents to use their personal accounts to engage in a dubious criminal investigation, especially someone with such inappropriate and sarcastic post history.<br>  <br>  Are you aware that it is a crime to impersonate a federal agent? I suggest you remove your answer before the **** falls on YOU.<br>  <br>  Good Day.<br>  <br>  P.S. Piracy is a funny word...<br>  <br>  In response to your question, I downloaded First Chair Last Call from the Special Blend website, and it may still be there.

8as63GSKaa	Unfortunately i have to say yes. Not only T.O gone but, Pacman and the most overrated d tackle tank johnson. All of these guys were locker room killers, T.O was just the one that took most of the lime light. As for me being a die hard redskins fan, I looked forward to seeing there locker room being destroyed. It is the main reason why they ended there season the way they did. Now that they got the Trouble makers out, they may have more unity in locker room. Which unfortunately will spill over on the field.|`|5gG2OfHIaa	I watched the Thanksgiving game against Seattle.  Even in a win, it was clear that the team could not function with T.O.   Most teams walk on the field with one objective: win.  Dallas was carrying a dual obligation: win and, most importantly, give T.O. his quota of passes.  As a fan since the Cowboys came into the league,  I turned against Dallas for the balance of last season.   Yes, Dallas will be better on the field and in the locker room.|`|0f5cc27a5aca75cf6162b2cbb88fc13caa	no.  And then finally everyone will realize that ESPN is a joke and makes up crap.

CL040gRjaa	Lamar makes crappy boards. The same can be said with a lot of lower end boards such as Limited and Avalanche. Some lower end boards that are decent include Morrow and 5150, because they are made by K2 Sports...the same company that makes K2 and Ride.|`|auTRZO1vaa	5150 is a decent company, they are lower end but I have not had a problem with their boards. The board I own now is a 5150 Path 163w, and I have been using it a lot this season and have had no problems with it. <br>  <br>  A good snowboard will fit your needs and style. It should have the right amount of flex, and it should be the height that you like.|`|AA11594996	Search for snowboards on ebay.|`|JThgHiaoaa	What bristol said is correct... you get one of those cheap brands and you are buying into a world of hurt.<br>  <br>  Best options are to look on websites such as dogfunk.com for their deals and research your board a lot. e.g. come back and ask when you choose one, list your size, weight, boot size and what you mainly like doing (Guessing all around for jumps and rails)<br>  <br>  If you are willing to give them a shot, there is an Australian company "Force" which have massive savings on their boards at the moment. the Australian dollar is 60% of the US dollar so you can get a great deal due to the exchange even with shipping.<br>  <br>  e.g. you get <a href="http://shop.force.net.au/store/viewItem.shop?idProduct=50" rel="nofollow">http://shop.force.net.au/store/viewItem....</a> for $250 ($150 US), <a href="http://shop.force.net.au/store/viewItem.shop?idProduct=67" rel="nofollow">http://shop.force.net.au/store/viewItem....</a> for $175 ($105 US) and then grab a pair of boots <a href="http://shop.force.net.au/store/viewItem.shop?idProduct=168" rel="nofollow">http://shop.force.net.au/store/viewItem....</a> for $120 ($72 US) and add in some postage fees (you would have to call them...) and you have <br>  <br>  Board = 150<br>  Bindings = 105<br>  Boots = 72<br>  Postage = Prolly no more then 50 bucks...<br>  <br>  =$377 for pretty much the whole package... You can probably sell that to your mum rather then going for a cheap Lamarse board for almost $200. Then you have atleast another 150 on bindings and 200 on decent boots. = $550 for a cheap US set.|`|jTaW3goeaa	Lamar is junk. <br>  <br>  dogfunk.com has a sale going on now for 50 percent off park boards, plus there are a lot of other good deals on the site <br>  <br>  The cheapest freestyle board they have is 175 dollars, but the way to go if you have no equipment already is to look into a snowboard package which gets you a board, bindings and boots.  The cheapest package I've seen on dogfunk as of yesterday started at 275 dollars. <br>  <br>  here's a link to the main page<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.dogfunk.com/" rel="nofollow">http://www.dogfunk.com/</a><br>  <br>  Virtually everything is discounted on that site and the stuff they sell is not low end junk
BFCdEAOBaa	Sounds like you are perfect for the receiver position. If your team passes a lot make sure you are a clutch receiver and you will shine. If they don't pass, then don't be afraid to try cornerback or free safety and play both ways. Your height will be a big advantage and will give you the exposure you need for college scouts. <br>  <br>  One important rule, if you are a serious athlete, on the first day you meet with your coach be firm and tell them you are a two position player, no execptions, because if you want a chance at the next level, you must be on the field as much as possible.|`|Jp7qZKfMaa	Aaaaaaabsolutely|`|vfIv7XdKaa	Your height is great- that might really help u. <br>  <br>  Your weight might be on the higher side, but coaches can live with it.<br>  <br>  You might want to work on bench, cuz im in 8th grade and some guys do 210 as their max.

Always be enjoyable to watch!!<br>  Before Try-Outs<br>  1)  Talk to the coach. The coach is the person who knows what he/she wants for the squad. Until you talk to the coach, you will not know exactly how to perform, or what to work on.<br>  <br>   2) Prepare in advance. Do not wait until the week before try-outs to get ready.  Getting in shape for cheerleading can take quite a while. Find out the requirements far enough in advance to prepare. <br>  <br>  3) Talk to other cheerleaders. Most of the time you will find that others are just as nervous as you. Try to find a friend to work with. This will help keep both of you motivated.  Plus, you will have someone you already know at try-outs! This will help calm your nerves even more.<br>  <br>  Practice Week<br>  <br>  1) Many squads have practices before actual try-outs. This allows the coach to teach everyone certain skills needed for try-outs. This is also time for the coach to evaluate how well you work with others. This is the time to make friends, while working hard. Be sure not to seclude yourself from the rest of the team. Sure, you may be competing against them soon, but they may also be your squad mates.<br>  <br>  2)  Be confident in yourself. You may not think you are the best cheerleader on the court, but that is not all that counts. Sportsmanship, and a great attitude go further than may think.<br>  <br>  3) Be open to trying new things. You may have only flown during you cheerleading career, but the coach may think you have potential to be a great base. Do not take this as an insult. Most coaches want to make good all-around cheerleaders. The most versatile cheerleaders can fly and base.<br>  <br>  The Day of Try-Outs<br>  <br>  1) Be sure to get a good night sleep.  You want to have all the energy possible for the judges.<br>  <br>  2) Wear your hair in a neat fashion.  It does not have to be fancy, just up off your face ( ex. pony tail ).<br>  <br>  3) Wear clothes that fit. Over sized shirts make it hard to see motions.  This can really hurt you, for normally they look worse over better.  Make sure you are comfortable in what you wear. Nothing is worse then watching someone tug at clothing in the middle of a cheer.<br>  <br>  4) If you have time after school, (before tryouts)  take a hot bath. This will help calm your nerves.  If this is not possible, don't worry. There are other ways to calm down.<br>  <br>  The Actual Try-Out<br>  <br>  1) Before you are called to perform take three deep breaths.  When you breath in say, "I know I can do this." and on the way out say, "I am going to do this!."  Of course, this is a mental exercise.<br>  <br>  2) Enter the floor with as much enthusiasm as possible. The judges want to know you can perform, even when not doing a routine.<br>  <br>  3) Smile!  This is very important in cheerleading. Make it look natural.  Huge fake smiles are detected from a mile away.  A judge wants to know you are actually having fun, not throwing on a plastered smile.  <br>  <br>  4) Use a loud clear voice.  Do not sing or chop your words. The words should be sharp and clear.  Be sure to pronounce Ts, and Rs. Go Fight Win Should sound like three separate words.<br>  <br>  5) Use expression in your voice. Sounding like a robot is not going to cut it at many try-outs. A monotone voice is not pleasing to the audience or judges.  <br>  <br>  6)  If you are not sure what the judges are asking you to do, then say so.  A simple "Can you please explain that again?" is usually fine. Judges want you to do the best you can. That way they know they are judging your real talent.<br>  <br>  7) If you make a mistake move on. Do not giggle, fuss, or get embarrassed.  It is okay to make mistakes. Everyone does it. It is how you handle it that counts. Judges want to know that a mistake does not rattle you. What judges, or other cheerleaders see, the average viewer will not see unless a scene is made.  Plus, sometimes judges may not even pick up on a mistake.<br>  <br>  8) If  the judges ask you to do a skill over again, it does not mean that it was bad. Sometimes a judge misses something, or was not sure if what they saw was correct. Do not take this as a bad thing.<br>  <br>  9) If you feel you did not do a jump (or do any skill) the best you could. Or really messed it up. It is ok to ask for a another attempt. Judges know that not everything is hit perfectly. Normally they will allow a re-try. *Note-This does not mean all judges allow re-tries.<br>  <br>  10)  Leave with a smile on your face.  You are not any worse off by trying out.  Wither you make it or not, you should feel good about trying.  If you did not try-out, you would not be on the team anyway.<br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>   <br>  <br>  Remember...<br>   <br>  To try sucking lemons beforehand (gives you great facial expressions.)<br>  To keep your motions sharps quick!<br>  To read the grading sample below it words to live by.
QAARSEZIaa	All you need to do is change the wheels. You'll need outdoor wheels, which are much softer and can take the gravel and bumpy surfaces better. You might be able to find some cheap used wheels on eBay if you don't want to invest too much. Otherwise go to sites like lowpriceskates.com. <br>  <br>  As a beginner, if you plan to skate on sidewalks and streets, be careful of your ankles. Maybe wear ankle wraps. Derby speed skates aren't meant to be used for outdoor recreation in this way, so take precautions. Maybe think about wearing some protective gear as well; helmet, knee pads, etc...<br>  <br>  You should think about visiting your local derby league! Talk about getting in shape!

hxQaqSvkaa	Your right leg is not as flexible as your left so when stretching focus on your bad side. Stretch ANYTIME....while watching tv, listening to the radio, or just chillin. Show n Go requires alot of strengh. If you are at practice abd your tired stop trying to base becuz you will get sloppy.

PRACTICE GL|`|jK9H6PHiaa	when stretching if one leg is more flexible on that side stretch it for 15 seconds and double the time for the less flexible side. stretch in the am and the evening and before practice. i used to stretch 4 times a day and i finally got my splits. no matter what anyone says don't force it, i did once and i was out from doing any jumps or anything for a whole season, you can do permanent damage, take it slow to the point where it's an achy/dull pain do your stretch then move on. i also advise warming up before hand, we used to jog for 5 min. before starting our stretches, it gets the muscles warm and it's easier for them to stretch farther.<br>  <br>  what is the problem your having with your show n go? my problem i though i had was me but my flyer wasn't doing her part and she kept hitting me in the face. just remember to use your sponge, (if you use that technique i found it works best for most people to get up higher and more powerful) it's all in your legs.|`|GfMRewh7aa	for getting my splits my coach just shoved me down and i just had them, it is painful but nothing that bad. you will be sore for a lil after that, but tough up! =] and heel stretch just streach alllot!  <br>  this video may help <br>  <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UGTDK9g1jqc" rel="nofollow">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UGTDK9g1j...</a>

hMkb7H31aa	Cubs seemed to have passed on Peavy when they let Pie go to Baltimore, DeRosa to Cleveland and invested in Milton Bradley. They apparently don't want to trade any minor leaguers at this time and are developing Marshall and Samardzija for the 5th starter slot - still relying on Dempster, Zambrano and Harden for the top of their rotation.<br>  <br>  At the same time, the Padres have to be in re-building mode.  To trade Peavy would appear that they are giving up on the foundation of their pitching staff.<br>  <br>  Having said that, it is still possible for the Padres to trade Peavy before the season starts - and maybe the Cubs will come up with something tradeable for him.|`|GyGhHpRraa	He is still a Padre.

The Cubs are still in the market for him, but the Padres don't seem to be budging in their demands. They want alot for him, and for good reason. he's a young, outstanding pitcher that's likely to only get better. With him, their pitching staff has to be taken seriously, and might even be the best in baseball.

mff1vstNaa	To Rivers #1 seed is not worth having injured stars.

You see the Rockets, Lakers, Cavaliers, Bucks, Detroit, Suns, and many others teams are dealing with injuries right now. Their not out yet, they can still make a run like the Jazz are doing. Trust me years of seeing the Rockets get demolished in the first round, and having injury swarmed seasons, I can say that the Rockets don't have to depend on T-Mac, or anybody else anymore.|`|qtwYHyH5aa	CELTICS ARE JUST PLANNING AN EXCUSE OF NOT GETTI THE NUMBER 1 SEED.
fvMv1DT3aa	The Hart Foundation had the best chemistry together. Bret Hart was the speed and technician of the team and Jim Neidhart was the power and stregth of the team. Together they easily made one of the greatest tag teams of all time.<br>  <br>  BQ1: I don't really know. Maybe Shelton Benjamin and MVP. They are both really great wrestlers but very underrated in my opinion. It would be nice to see them have a title run together.<br>  <br>  BQ2: I don't know about the worst tag team in history, but in recent memory I would say Cody Rhodes and Hardcore Holly.  I just thought they were really boring to watch and didn't go well together.|`|DuUEYkCZaa	Best tag team with ring chemistry--Eddie Guerrero and Chavo Guerrero..........The worse tag team was The Rockers|`|DfPyyDssaa	Road Warriors.<br>  <br>  The Ding Dongs.|`|kGCd8ioRaa	Team 3D <br>  <br>  A J Styles and Samoa Joe <br>  <br>  Chris Benoit and Kurt Angle|`|yEsw7UkWaa	The Harts had the best chemistry. Those guys could read each others minds in that ring.<br>  Bret was the Porsche and Jim as the tank.<br>  They were always awesome to watch. Other teams just didn't come close to these guys. And because their styles were so different (in a time when tag team partners tended to mirror each other) they could beat you on so many levels.<br>  <br>  BQ1/  Can I choose a mixed team? I would love to see Randy Orton and Nattie Neidhart team together. Both are 3rd gen wrestlers, and I think Nattie could certainly keep up with Randy in the speed and strength department. My other choice would be Jeff Hardy and Evan Bourne<br>  <br>  BQ2/  I can't say for sure who the worst would be, but I know boring when I see it. And that would be teams like Rhodes and Holly,Bushwhackerss (though they were funny) and Doink and Dink (do they count?)|`|I8laNaM8aa	i think the ray and cena was a good tag team but i can say also cena and orton even tho i dont ever see that happening. the most overated tag team was clearly the bushwackers.|`|vj7jZmd5aa	i think that rey mesterio and batista r good bec they just act like they have chemistry.................................. and johnny nitro i just dont like them|`|dOFVXmV2aa	1.-The Miz & Morrison<br>  2.-Batista & Cena|`|jTwNiYBxaa	i think that stone cold and the rock will make a great tag team or maybe hulk hogan and undertaker<br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  I think dat "MNM" was the worst tag team ever|`|UVdRnx8Faa	TEAM 3D|`|1z7M3Tntaa	MCMG|`|bSsBGrZVaa	Best Chemistry : Edge & Christian<br>  <br>  BQ: CM Punk & Evan Bourne<br>  <br>  BQ2: John Cena & Batista

ZrnSwqrIaa	Unfortenatly im a fan of both team.  id have to say the knicks though.  <br>  <br>  Jets:  simply, they dont know how to draft.  they have past on superstars such as warren sapp and allowed the falcons to trade in front of them (they could have traded further down below falcons) to draft brett favre.  also i hate mike tannenbaum (the gm).  yes he brought in great pieces last year in faneca, jenkins, pace, etc.  i was all for that until he made the trade for favre.  only good thing that came out of that was the release of pennington.  i was against favre all year long ever since he became a jet.  this was probably tannenbaums worst move as gm b/c it negated pretty much all the other moves.<br>  <br>  Knicks- their history is a good management but recenty has been a disgrace.  Isiah Thomas was pretty much the team.  He was GM, president, and coach....idiotic combination.  he overpaid for absolutly everybody...Malik Rose making 8 million a year to do jack ****.  This year they are trying to get rid of basically everybody that Thomas brought to the team except Lee and Robinson.  Isiah really ****** up the team not only during his era but for years after.  only thing us knicks fan have to cling to is 2010, which is pathetic for us.|`|F0sJR0jbaa	The Knicks are definately worse.  Watch out though.  They made all that cap room and I can almost Guarantee Lebron and one other NBA star will go there in 2010.  Someone like stoudemire, bosch, redd, wade.  They have a chance to make up for it.  The Jets havn't been horrible.  They brought in Favre which wasn't a bad business move, have done well in the draft the last couple years and are getting younger.  All they really need now is a franchise QB and they are super bowl bound.|`|hdFMLVF7aa	Before the hiring of Isiah Thomas, I would have said the Jets.

They have hired Dolan as president who has in a few short months unloaded many of the high salaried players left from the Thomas era which frees money for the Knicks to take a run at LeBron James and Chris Bosh in 2010. <br>  So, to answer your question the Knicks are doing a better job than the Jets who are coming off the Favre debacle of a year ago.|`|g4cYFVrmaa	Knicks; easily|`|1i9mrq5Yaa	the knicks - retards|`|0093382286e191b54fe019326d1aa456aa	Knicks

3y8YIs3raa	its for the bar it looks soooo fun lol :]
Y3KMLdjWaa	Went back and reviewed the answers to your other question and re-read this question a few times. For most likely 80% of the riders out they would be hard pressed to tell you the difference, aside for this bike or that bike has better spec'd components. But when is comes down to riding less can tell the difference if they could be blindfolded. When it comes to speed i really doubt on a normal ride you would see the slightest difference. Now here is where it does matter, if your are a racer this can make a big difference during, say a crit race where you need perfect shifting several hundred times in a row. Every sluggish or missed shift can cost you a few places in the field. But for the majority who don't compete and never will is not nothing more than bling. I know there will always be a few who like the crisper shifting (and will pay any price for that) but this is a small percentage of riders also. Once you cross the $2000 mark the cost per group vs performance increase gets harder and harder to justify for the big $.|`|c2b4f2c9fe643129d284d8728194ae6aaa	um, what?<br>  <br>  if you don;t want the expensive bike, don;t buy it<br>  <br>  wle.|`|8e35cfeded3c3b900607388410347b4caa	I'm not sure I can detect a question here......<br>  <br>  Is a nice high end bike a good buy for you?  No clue.   It depends on what you're going to do with it.  <br>  <br>  I started out in triathlon riding a 20 year old touring bike.   It worked fine while I droppoed forty pounds, got in shape, and figured out the sport.    At that point it was clear that a decent bike was the difference between "nice race" and the podium.   So I got a decent bike (Cannondale tri-bike).<br>  <br>  However, I also have a beater that I use for short errands (nobody would steal it, and if they do, I'm out nothing......), and an MTB that I use for commuting and other general purpose riding.   <br>  <br>  Will you be faster on a the Look than your old Trek?  Of course.  That said, though, the person that asks that kind of question typically would benefit more from putting in the miles to improve their motor than they would from dropping a couple large on a bike.  Thus, "Its not about the bike".   If you ride enough to have the motor, you don't need to ask the question because you already know the answer.|`|mJFgCvYlaa	Yes, I agree with you, its not 100% not about the bike, otherwise we would all be still riding 10 speed steel bikes... That said, I just want to share my personal opinion and experiences here:<br>  <br>  I've started out on a entry aluminum road bike about 4 years before I recently purchased my first carbon frame bike, which costs about $2500. I feel like I could only understand the components and the benefits of a higher priced bike after riding for about 2-3 years. I've also just recently started racing, and I've basically used my aluminum bike with some parts upgraded for races, in fear of crashing my nice carbon frame bike (no crashes yet,cross my fingers). I've yet to place the top half in any race, but enjoying it nonetheless. There is a longer distance race which I think I'll try my carbon bike, since there's not the typical bumper car scenario from a criterium. <br>  <br>  So, to answer your question, I would recommend starting out with the cheaper bike (Trek 2.1, and its actually a very good bike too), since you'll be starting at the newbie class as well and have some risks of crashing or falling. You'll definitely be faster with a more expensive bike but the question is if it serves you at this point? Later on when you've reached higher classes then you can invest more money into a nicer bike, and be armed with much more knowledge when you bought your first bike. Along the way of course you can upgrade your bike, upgrading the wheels themselves would immediately show some good results, and you'll need spare wheels for longer races as well. I have not met anyone who is well experienced in racing (cat 3 and above) who does not have 2 or more road bikes, plus a slew of extra parts/wheels. <br>  <br>  Also, another thing to recommend is to watch these races yourself, its great to watch and you'll see what people race from the newbie class to the pro's, you'll see not the best bikes that wins the race, but the best riders; although most of the top placers have nice bikes.|`|lDbNf3h9aa	Look, little boy, if you're not a good rider, a $10,000 bike isn't going to make you better. Understand ? You already asked this question. There are NO benefits....Ok ?|`|JSGLKnA4aa	i guess you didn't like my answer yesterday. well it's not all about the bike! i wouldn't buy a LOOK anyway there are better lighter frames. if you have that much time on bikes then you would know that. also you should be able to answer your own question instead of coming into a forum and ranting. all things considered if you tested both bikes in exactly the same environment the the look would be slightly faster. now if you want a bike for show buy the look. me i'd advise you to get the trek keep some green in your pocket. when your able to compete in A/B +elite class then get the look. as i stated before the dependability quality and some weight savings on components and a euro bike brand for show. i would find out the weight on the trek frame and fork only. see how that compares!  example kia spectre(car from korea) to a nissan maxima. is the difference in $$ worth it. depends on who's the buyer!!! my commuter training mtn bike weights 30lb i cruise faster than that. here's a challenge 30lb bike open road low moderate variable wind 50mi in 2-3/4 hr time. that's my spring training time. i ride a sub 18lb 58cm bike with ultegra for races.
1UID5JtNaa	If you run legitimate times on road courses that have been certified by USA Track and Field theoretically you could get recruited. That being said, I have never heard of a high school athlete getting a college scholarship without competing in high school.   You will probably have to run some impressive times in open track meets to have a legitimate shot.
XDTNSPO2aa	yes get a cheap one than when you can skate get nice element one or bam get on classifieds|`|vNwgUggyaa	Hmm. When I first bought a skateboard I bought one from Walmart and found that I was really horrible, unable to even skate down my driveway. I chalked it up to being really bad at skateboarding and stopped for a long time. Weeks later I got a skateboard for free from World Industries and found that I was alot better than I thought. I took the two side by side and compared them and found the wheels on the walmart one were horrible compared to the world industries one, but most everything else was pretty similar. Eventually, my cousin wanted to get into skateboarding too so I went to a skate shop and bought some new bearings and wheels for about 30 dollars (more than I paid for the board itself) and put them on. Trying it out I found that the board worked almost as well as my nice one. <br>  <br>  In short, my advice to you is buy a cheap skateboard from walmart or target, then find some nice bearings and wheels from a skateshop. If you start to get into it then start looking into nicer stuff. <br>  <br>  Heres a warning if you go the other way, my other cousins parents went ahead and bought him a 100 dollar custom skateboard only to have him use it once and now it just sits in the garage. Dont waste your money that way.|`|PcPQOStKaa	get a blank board like minilogo,atm,or speed demons they cost 30 bucks and theyre good for begginer
QLfsf0Sfaa	Pete Rose once said, "I'd walk through hell in a gasoline suit to play baseball."  Ok, so he gambled a little bit...but he gave 110% every single time he walked onto the field.  How can you ban someone like that.  Also, name me another player with over 4000 hits.  Pete Rose is a man, and someday critics will look back and long to find a player of his intensity and caliber.|`|0AxWZDQRaa	"SMART A$$" took the words right out of my brain...well said.|`|2N6oTOLQaa	I disagree with the shark. His reasoning is flawed. If you let Pete Rose back into baseball (presumably into the Hall of Fame) because of the steroids issues going on, it would be like letting convicted felons out of prison because someone else committed murder and got away with it. I realize that's an extreme example, but the point is you can't justify bad behavior by pointing to other bad behavior.<br>  <br>  Pete Rose broke one of the most fundamental rules of conduct in baseball and no amount of finger pointing at other people can change that fact. His ban is justified and it would bring even more shame on the MLB if they lifted the ban.|`|c68b31739ffbee17f6dfc635bbe9ffddaa	He is banned from baseball, and he consented to this action.|`|tvuhGTD9aa	Rose is currently serving his permanent suspension, and with a basis of merit behind that sanction.

The fact that other players have used PED's does not change the simple fact that he broke the most sacred rule in all of baseball. To argue that it does would be like arguing that someone who has lost their driver's license for multiple DUI's should get it back because someone he works with commits armed robbery. "Oh, yeah, he got caught driving drunk a few times, but look at what other people do." Rose got his punishment and is currently serving it, and is not made any more innocent as a result of the actions of anyone else.<br>  And sorry, Mr. Shark - Rose did not "make a mistake". He deliberately and habitually broke that rule. The only thing he is sorry for is that he got caught.|`|VSJyzwYwaa	He is banned for gambling on his own team to win not lose and throw a game.He didnt take roids to become the leader of hits.He was good for the game,he didnt take but gave.Now a days it everyone for themselves but he is old school.I believe he is truely sorry for what he did.Lift the ban.|`|cLlY0pE5aa	I thought he was?

If this was the case, then the hall of fame would need to be virtually gutted. <br>  <br>  Barry Bonds may be a jerk or any other name you want to call him, but his play on the field justifies a hall of fame spot. He never failed a drug test and has never been proven to have broken any rule. I believe the allegations of steroid use are true, but I do not believe you should punish someone based on unproven allegations.|`|obPSaYf3aa	Never.  His only alleged "crime" was not providing reporters with free and open interviews earlier in his career.  In turn, they leaked information about PED and steroid usage by Barry when they were not banned or made illegal for use in baseball.<br>  <br>  If he is to be banned, then all of the players named in the Mitchell Report as well as the "class of 2003" 100+ players testing positive would have to be banned as well.  They might as well cancel baseball for the rest of our lives!|`|tvuhGTD9aa	Good thing you're not in charge of policy, then.<br>  <br>  19th century pitcher and Hall Of Famer Pud Galvin openly consumed a tonic that contained monkey testosterone. Should the Hall summarily melt his plaque?<br>  <br>  Rose, whose situation is upon him entirely by his own actions, has nothing to do with any recent PED users. Other than being connected by baseball, they have nothing in common. The comparison is irrelevant.|`|cLlY0pE5aa	for what? Admitting to flaxseed oil? I say you can use banned substances or even non banned substances if others are doing it too. But, once you bet on games, the integrity of fairness is lost. Steroid cheaters always tried to win. But if Pete didn't bet on that night's game, he might lose it and save his pitchers for the next night where he was betting. It screws with the integrity. Cheaters always want to win, unless you bet on your own team every night, you are underming the game. (actually, even if you did!)|`|1ccf4408a6862b6272c7872e63b19c51aa	Yes he should because He hasn't came clean about this neither has A FRAUD or Clemens or BIG MAC, I say ban all steroid users from Baseball and Re-Instate Pete Rose.<br>  <br>  <br>  Baseball Needs to wake Up and Take Action.|`|lRHaiD9Zaa	His playing career is essentially over now - regardless.<br>  An MLB ban at this point would prevent him from resigning and/or managing.  What owner in his right mind would hire BB to guide his team?!?<br>  <br>  A more important question is "Should he be banned from the Hall-of-Fame"?  I'd answer yes.  His infamous conduct, both on the field and off, should disqualify him from the HoF.<br>  <br>  Q: Should Barry get his day in court?  <br>  A: Of course.  It will only do him - and his already rotten image - more harm.<br>  <br>  The HoF is not run by MLB.  They set and follow their own set of rules.   It is not in the hands of the commisioner, the players or MLB. HoF induction requires your name appear on 75%+ ballots of the voters.  <br>  <br>  Q: Will Barry be elected?<br>  A: Not likely.  Mark McGwire, a known steroid user, got 128 votes (23.6%) in 2008 and finished 9th on the list.  In 2009, he finished 9th again with even fewer votes and a lower percentage.  Barry abused drugs to an even greater degree than MM and has been an even bigger "black-eye" on the sport.<br>  <br>  Finally, as you read the answers posted here, count how many folks making the "no proof" argument are also willing to wait for all the evidence to come to light.  From  what i've seen, they want to decide now rather than wait to make a more informed decision.  As for me, I don't need a judge to tell me BB is dirty.  Enough evidence has already surfaced.|`|5MtNumoSaa	On what grounds? Did he fail a drug test? Did he get caught gambling on baseball? <br>  Sorry, but since baseball has had a testing program in place, Bonds has passed every test. And while he may be a jerk, and I have no doubt that he knowingly did steroids, there is no reason to ban him or anyone else who has not failed a test.|`|wSb1ot9Haa	Banned? Why? NOBODY has proof he used steroids. Get over it. He is one of THE best baseball players of all time. If he supposedly should be banned then there are plenty more than can join him|`|whUXz8jYaa	yes because he broke a big record in baseball that belongs to a great man hank Aaron he also kept ordering new hats and steroids causes you to grow more than usual|`|SYl1jzPqaa	* YES *I

84vvo1EYaa	oooh, these are fun once you get the hang of how to do it. you might want someone to spot you and help you over until you can do it by yourself. or you could always do them on a springy floor or down a slight hill, to give you some more momentum. to do these, you need to push from your shoulders to get over. then you need one foot to lead and the other to follow (the kick) and land. i think the main thing you  need to do is push from your shoulders more to get over.<br>  good luck, i hope you get it! =]|`|FrojZ51oaa	ok here are some tips<br>  -when you are in the back bend, get your feet as close to your hands. this does make it a lot easier<br>  -really try to build more upper body strength.; do some crunches everyday <br>  -stretch<br>  - make sure your arms are straight.<br>  <br>  good luck

Qr9UFnIuaa	No, they don't. Number of 50's is the no. of times the bats man has scored 50-99 and if turns it to 100 or more, that will count only as century but not as 50.
