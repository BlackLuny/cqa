20090226091011AAbtHmf	Local Businesses;United States;Other - US Local Businesses	Does anyone know where this store is in El Paso, Texas?	I've been getting random charges on my credit card from a place called "Millenium #8629"...      I've already called my credit card to dispute the charges and order a new debit card. they said there is absolutely no address or phone # for this compnay! They said it is a person who has my card # and is withdrawing funds from my account!!      Anyways, Now that i've cancelled that card, i DO feel relieved, but I would like to find out if anyone knows/or has heard of this place so I can rip them a new one!!!      The bank gave me information saying it was Womens' clothing and sales place....hmmm......      I've already googled it, and already called 411 and already done the phone book, so those are not options...      I was hoping someone who lives in el paso, or who has been here can answer this maybe??
