Every 8 year old boy needs to see that!!!|`|rwVqMChyaa	No...but I once got into an elevator with people in it and discovered that my purse was on fire!  I thought it was the trash can a janitor was toting...then I looked down and my purse was smoldering!  When I had gotten out of the car my cigarette had brushed the roof of the car and dropped the entire ash into my purse, starting the entire process.

So I am very much sleep deprived.|`|1SKN7SoDaa	I don't think...I KNOW I should be going to bed earlier.....and yes I always wake up tired in the morning.... ;)|`|6yZ85EY5aa	No. I learned many years ago, that if you go to bed at a regular time, get 7-8 hours of rest a night, sleeping is more efficient. Set your body clock and you won't need naps.|`|n7vsfdplaa	Yeah most days I think that I should go to bed early.|`|Q8yTJWTXaa	Yeah, like every day.

And save a cut class notice for when you really want to skip school.|`|4KUFvFp0aa	yea i always think dat but i never go 2 sleep early and its usually because i'm very busy|`|MyIobIEaaa	Sometimes yes sometimes no, it all depends on if i went to bed at a decent time and if i actually slept that night instead of tossing and turning which sometimes happens.

3bac23d54097847adbb974c981d33deaaa	I prefer the slow zombies.  They seem more menacing and scary.

It's not a real zombie if it's fast.|`|oPRmgyXzaa	fast, so they can catch the people|`|5VeXOv5Aaa	slow and steady wins the race|`|Qo6x1ju1aa	fast, more action :)|`|lSaCUg0yaa	Real zombies can't run and all you have to do is knock them over as they can't get up.|`|KlkTfv48aa	It depends on weapons available for the heroes, day or night, if they're traveling in a group or alone, and whether or not they have stealth.  Slower zombies tend to have a more dramatic effect but faster zombies are more lethal.|`|MdSiSwtkaa	Fast and big. Even Zombie's can evolve. ;P|`|tLI94qWNaa	I think that a mix of the two is the way to go, I mean every zombie is different.  I prefer the fast ones though, the slow ones just piss me off by being so slow.|`|Pgbwgq88aa	slow adds suspense

3258fd9ca0baa8e13a1a5449e7bdca00aa	Col. Shaw (Broderick) chewed out two people in that scene ...    - Jupiter Sharts (Jihmi Kennedy), the young soldier, to make him realize there was more to combat than just being a good shot.    - Major Forbes (Cary Elwes), to make him train the soldiers properly for shooting in combat conditions.    Cary Elwes played the marksmanship trainer in that particular scene, so his name is probably the one you're looking for.  His other well-known roles (see first link below) include Westley in The Princess Bride, Jonas in Twister, and the "Casanova" killer in Kiss the Girls.    You might also possibly mean John Finn, who played Sgt. Mulcahy, the Irish guy who has the overall responsibility for training the soldiers.  However, Mulcahy is shown as taking his job seriously and doesn't take the same lackadaisical approach as Forbes does on the rifle range.  In the past, Finn has played mostly minor roles in the movies and guest spots on TV, but currently on TV he plays the lead investigator (the bald white guy) on Cold Case.|`|oPRmgyXzaa	denzel washington

21eb1fee7277ed0dfc6c417c0a528dddaa	I can't stand them. Remaking them suggests there was something wrong with the originals. From what I can see from the latest one, they didn't do it right. It looks like they start out with Jason right away. Which everyone knows that it was his mother in the first one. That is what really made that film kickass. The fact that Jason's mom was doing the killing to avenge what happened to him. I'm also not looking forward to the Nigthmare on Elm Street remake. No one can fill Krueger's shoes but Robert Englund.|`|mzH7wV6maa	I do like the remakes, because the special effects and make-up etc. is all alot better now, but you don't get the real scare the old creepy ones give you :(    xx|`|cEuuj70Eaa	I heard a rumour they were remaking Rosemary's Baby.  I cannot wait.  That will be great.  For years that movie gave me the creeps, but with the late 60's style and clothes it's time for a re-make.|`|cBv8bFQ2aa	i like the remakes, but most of the time i prefer the originals, my favorite remake has got to be house of wax.|`|AA11209233	I used to hate them and wonder why hollywood can't come up with any new ideas and has to recycle the old.  Then I watched some remakes (from various genres) and realized that some of them are better, and that I was unlikely to re-watch the old movie and was entertained by the new one, even in cases where the old movie was better.  (Would I have ever watched the old comedy Mr. Deeds if Adam Sandler hadn't remade it--that Sandlers was worse barely matters.)    In horror, I think The Hitcher was a good example.  I remembered loving that movie in the eighties, and when I heard it was being remade I wondered if the remake could hold up to the memory.  When I saw it it was really good and I liked it.  It also made me realize two things--I don't clearly remember every detail of the original, and that I wasn't going to pull the box of VHSs out of the closet to watch the original again, so the movie did it's job--it entertained me for two hours.    That said, I think it is better when a movie just rips off an old movie than when it is actually remade.  I'd rather watch The Faculty than see Invasion of the Body Snatchers remade.  If they remade Invasion, the whole time I'd would watch the new Invasion, I'd be thinking of the old one.  Make a copycat movie and you can just sit back and enjoy it.  That way you don't groan at every scene that gets screwed up.|`|XCVFEAC8aa	I love them!|`|BJIo6twUaa	I dont mind them as long as they do it right and not screw up the original idea.    I am looking forward to the remake of Nightmare on Elm St, they are going to make the dreams more physiological and thrilling according to what i have read.|`|9qymF2xlaa	I think about 90% of them are bad. For instance, the Fog.. the original was great.. the remake was full of plastic looking actresses who were more scared about a bit of hair falling out of place than the fog itself. They should never remake films IMO !

Whenever I think of "epic" bands, this band always comes to mind for me. Their songs are amazing, aha!     Check out; "Pray For Plagues," "Black and Blue," "Chelsea Smile," "The Comedown," "Death Breath," "A lot Like Vegas," etc..|`|8zcD3flPaa	My favorite EPIC band ever - the death metal band...Death. It's really epic, it's really different, their songs never get old (if you're a metal fan),  and they have NEVER EVER sold out even a bit. This was the band that cared about the fans, not the popularity and money. Some examples :  Scavenger of Human Sorrow  http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kdEPnGUPc...

v1hCymAEaa	I would be on L's side. Kira used to be cool until he went all psycho!    :-P|`|vqg6wpCLaa	Truthfully, I agreed with Light's motives. In the first manga, before he killed the L imposter, I thought his intentions were good. I would have sided with him, but once I would have realized he isn't that great of a person because he killed the innocent, I would have sided with L.|`|ivqfhzHXaa	L's , light is an idiot... i hated death note, it was so bad!! i only liked like the first 12 episodes or so... after that it got really horrible and boring eww|`|AA11107214	L's    Kira is a whiny brat.|`|4qVWj3UHaa	who do you think|`|3N2ElzcQaa	Be on L's side and try to stop him. I'd rather go and sniper attack Kira when he doesn't look.|`|KyOP56Xsaa	L!   Why?   Unlike Kira he actually uses what he's got [e.g. he thinks etc...]  But Kira he uses the Death Note and with out the Death Note he can't really kill people that easily.|`|AA11045021	Hmm...well honestly, I always sided with Kira in the manga. It was more interesting to see how Light would rule the world.|`|rNxK7cY8aa	Kira's. I was rooting for him even when I stopped watching the series. It made me sad when I heard about the ending.  >.    I rather like his idea of justice, and I saw no problem with him killing criminals. Although if he actually succeeded he might have taken it a bit too far... like killing someone for jaywalking.  XD|`|d5577f941b3bec324120cbdb948525ecaa	L's|`|olLnjC7Gaa	L is the reason that i like that show, so im totally on L's side|`|DksKPjHsaa	L's Side, Hehe I'm a obsessed L fangirl, I also love beyond birthday though, he's cool lol, I also hate Light/Raito so I'm on L's Side |`|TkPJYlaMaa	L  Kira's kooky|`|bRjq7xZ5aa	I used to side w/ Kira before he started killing innocent people to get the police off his back. Now I'm for L. :D|`|ldGz9UoBaa	Justice is only in the eye of the beholder, therefore the views of the government and police are not necessarily just or correct.  I side with Kira whose view of justice is more conservative than liberal.|`|NJ25E4AZaa	I think that I am on both sides of the argument. I agree that crime should be eliminated, but I believe that Light may have gone about the wrong way with doing it. I truly believe that L and the police should have stopped Kira, though, because he was a mass murderer. He may have eliminated crime, but he kille d thousands in the process. This is why Deathnote is such a great series. It really blurs the lines between right and wrong.|`|2QRQfXM9aa	Well, to be honest, I truly did like both sides. I liked Kira because he was eliminating all crime, and I liked L's, because of his deductive skills and abilities. However, they both had their flaws. L's flaw was letting Light(Kira) get the best of him in most situations. Kira's flaw was going too far in his killing, and getting too cocky, which is why he lost to Near in the end.    I don't know who I truly side with, but I guess L's, since I respect him more, and found his death almost more tragic than Kira's. Especially since, Kira planned his death from the beginning.|`|Ceje1viaaa	Duh it would be L!!!!! L is awesome, if it wasn't for him dying he would of sooooo kicked Lights a**.  Love ya L!|`|Jz4QuEgTaa	Light.  I'd Do The Same Thing If I Had A Death Note, Except Killing Criminals.  I'd Kill Everyone.|`|yhGffwOpaa	I think Light's really cocky...  Judging by most people's answers....  I say I go  L....    but i think it'll be nice if kira killed the bad people first and then L would kill him....

One reason I think that is......"Joe" is all shook up about having killed his "old lady."  And he's intent on escaping the hangman.........even if he has to go down to Mexico.

dfb4a1ebd47e08f0a2763df490af255aaa	It was due to start airing sometime either in January or this month but so far there's been nothing.    The Supernatural page on the TV3 website has been updated with photos from the new season but I've emailed them a couple of times now politely asking if they can tell me when they will be likely to start showing the new season and they never reply.    Apparently, when it does return to TV3, it's due to air on Monday nights around 12:00 midnight.  Sorry I couldn't be of more help - I wish TV3 would quit mucking about and get Supernatural back on our screens soon!!    http://www.tv3.ie/shows.php?request=supe...

dPyfP0ijaa	Well, you go to netflix.com    Sign up.     You will need a credit card, they might accept a bank account, but I'm pretty sure its only a credit card.    The price varies depending on how many you want to rent eeach month, or at a time.    You will also be able to view some movies and video online for free, several hours each month depending on the plan you choose, but their online selection was kinda crappy when I had it a year or so ago.|`|HRJkHuw4aa	go to netflix.com and register, you'll need a debit or credit card. right now they are offering 2 weeks free|`|fb3dd3fee54f8b05cc6ac9ae9d500a06aa	ummm go to netflix.com|`|BrWVBIE4aa	you get internet and type it in the long white box across the top of the screen

This is YOUR life....not theirs!!!  Being respect-ful to your family doesn't mean you have to turn your life inside out to get their approval or love.  If they think that way, that's on them, not you...but if they REALLY care about you, they won't put you in that kind of position....At least I hope not....    God bless you!!!|`|hvghGmzAaa	if you love her stay with her|`|JoOMti26aa	if you love her as much as it seems, what your family think shouldn't matter. and if your family love you enough to accept that love, they shouldn't care.   introduce her. what's the worst that could happen?|`|MzZ1xenkaa	if you love her then stay with her  if your family dont then thats their problem not yours  if they love you then they will see how much she means to you and love her to|`|NH5htkAyaa	Surely your family will be happy knowing you are happy ..

They can't be that xenophobic. Speak to them about it, tell them you're in love. I'm sure they'll be happy for you. Introduce her if your talk with your family goes well. Good luck :)|`|GiHOnv54aa	If you love her introduce her to your family and see what they say. If they don't like her just because she's french, ignore your family. Have you ever asked your parents why they hate the french? I dated an Egyptian guy and I'd heard my dad saying before he didn't like the Egyptians, but when he met my boyfriend he was ok with it. I know he wasn't totally supportive, and it didn't help that my boyfriend was 3 years older than me (I was 14 when we started dating) but when my dad found out he was serious about his studies, he let it go  Good Luck  X|`|AA10971419	if ur n  l uv with her then french n english hav nothin 2 do with it|`|SUR1MHqWaa	Introduce her im sure your family will be nice with her if she is making you happy|`|TEhITkeIaa	Go for the gold,and first introduce a two bit crack-whore to your family,You know they will hate her by all means.

However, Carl is about find out just how much friendship means when Dupree, his best friend has been displaced from his home and fired from his job because of attending their wedding. Taking his friend in, what Carl and Molly are about to experience is that the fine line between a few days and whatever else is after, can be a lot more than they bargained for.

8S8gIJTfaa	Moon in Pisces  When in Pisces, the Moon is in the joint domains of Neptune, Jupiter and Venus and the key word is anxiety. Sacrifice is closely associated with this moon sign. These people have strong creativity and a desire to make the world a better place to live in. It is hard to define boundaries and these people can be accused of getting involved in other's problems,without being asked. The most secretive of all signs, the moon in Pisces is typified by indecision and indolence, sensitiveness, submission and by a negative and receptive attitude. They have a natural aversion to acceptance of any facts in the presentation of which no allowance is made for the element of idealism. It is primarily a placement for a woman.     Natives with afflicted Moon (by Mercury, Mars, Saturn, and Neptune) may be influenced in the direction of mental or elemental obsession. Pisces is the domain of spiritual rebirth. The Moon in Pisces can be very powerful. It makes a great psychic and gives flexibility of emotion. People born in the Sign of the Redeemer are natural worshippers of beauty.     Lunar Pisces are very loyal to their friends. The powerful imagination and impressionability of the lunar Pisces tend to inhibit their emotions. Women natives incline to romantic attitudes joined to self-sacrifice. Lunar Pisces generally succeed best in fields and pursuits requiring intuitive judgement, discretion, assiduity, and detailed work. They do well as entertainers, dealers with liquids of all sorts, promoters, seafarers, and detectives.|`|rnqgiRkWaa	that answer is wrong. your SUN is in pisces   where were you born?  city and state|`|d0sztRa9aa	City and state, and birthtime. http://lunarium.co.uk/sign.php

That is hysterical.|`|AA11618168	Just go in, lay back in the chair, reach over and grab the dentist's balls in one hand and tell him "I won't hurt you if you don't hurt me"    Works like a charm.|`|VFEZFanIaa	Do it! :)|`|RP5NnxgUaa	Haha that's not a great idea!

LrKCLZF7aa	This is a very good aspect for the native but it is a bad aspect for a weak partner. Let's go over the symbolism of each planet first and then you will truly understand.    Venus: attraction, desire, infatuation, the act of making love, money in the short term, female sexuality, fashion, sense of humor, beauty. grace.    Pluto: power, competition and competing, investing, gambling, the corporation, the act of sex (in a non-romantic way, sex is like shaking hands for Pluto), the nuclear bomb and nuclear power, extremes.    Now we put 2 and 2 together and here are some of the possibilties:  1. Desire(Venus) for power(Pluto) and money(Venus).  2. Powerful(Pluto) sex(Pluto and Venus)  3. Attraction(Venus) to gambling and investing(Pluto)  4. Beautiful(Venus) sex(Pluto).    Now the effects on the native are that the native will have powerful feelings of love(infatuation mistaken for love) but will leave if something better comes along because of the desire for power. They may even feel bad about it but it won't change their decision. With both planets in Scorpio, Pluto becomes even stronger and even colder.|`|aOBmcGAZaa	http://www.badastronomy.com/bad/misc/ast...

That letter could have been written by any of your contacts. We all love you! *kiss*|`|V0CV4TJpaa	You give me a b0ner Pablo. I couldn't help myself.|`|6U9b2t4raa	Interesting.  But I must say, I have no idea who could have written this.   Are you sure it was mail you received, and not something you were planning to send to someone?  You have been drinking again, and I'm sure your occasional afternoon blackouts are back on schedule.      The more I read this, the more I'm leaning towards Rey as the author.  It has her tone and feisty attitude written all over it.  Plus we all know about her deep dark desire towards you. ( poor girl, so confused )      But to answer your other question, I have lust/love relationships for one special person, a like/ friend love for most of the rest, and a hate/hate for another special lady and her inbred family.      All the best,       Ted|`|Pksi62wLaa	that was rude! Whoever sent it must apologize to you.|`|FJxnMU9paa	It wasn't me! I swear!    And no. I don't.

Lilly-livered Rey. Rey- the same Rey who apologizes when people punch her in the face.     "Sorry- i was blocking your punch. Please proceed."     No- I haven't got the guts to pull a crazy stunt like that. Ask one of the Camryn's.|`|qdPtCBJeaa	Are you sure it was for "Auntie Pablo"??  Cause that sounds like an old love letter from Ted to Jj...back in the day.  Then again......I'm doing shots of Nyquil.    Or maybe Bob the Camryn....  Or HeyBabe....the big flirt.
gUyBXZYlaa	I like the backwards ones which are from the "bad guy's" point of view.  Maybe do Hansel and Gretel where the lady with the gingerbread (or whatever) house was just misunderstood.  She finds two kids eating her house, and when she takes them inside to feed them they push her into the stove.    The giant in Jack and the Beanstalk was just acting in self defense?  What did the bear's think about Goldilocks breaking into their house?|`|M1OKvcqYaa	How about a typical fairytale but from the princes POV?|`|HxAyoEQVaa	GIRL MEETS GIRL?|`|jdiyEABSaa	What about a fairytale, where you turn everything around.

I really don't see any point in adding frivolous words to the english language - especially ones that sound shoddy and are not... useful, practical, valuable or contructive.|`|0uMLrKAbaa	yeah!|`|VFEZFanIaa	It sounds like a word. So yeah, :).|`|B2OYOhIpaa	yeah it should|`|1Z0Lmrk1aa	No, I disagree.

Q4zl7vRkaa	Jay-Z.   3, IMO.   Reasonable Doubt  In My Lifetime Vol. 1  Blueprint 1    Honorable Mention to American Gangster...I THINK that album was dope as hell.    @Bonnie: I agree with you 110%.

As an MC    Black Thought spits classic material on    Illadelph Half Life  Rising Down   The Tipping Point  Things Fall Apart  Game Theory    I'm thinking "Do You Want More??!?" too.. but i haven't listened to it in a while. So i can't think. When talking about goats etc. I like to have the album freshly ringing in my ears.    As far as Jay-Z goes.  He's no doubt one of the greats...But you're blind if you can't acknowledge that he is GROSSLY overrated. To put into perspective, Is your favourite rapper not Chuck D Bonnie?

I have their 1st two albums 'Epidemic of Violence', and 'Tortured Existence', along with two EP's they released back in the late 80's. A few of the tracks from their EP's were re-recorded, and released on their albums...good stuff!  The bands Malevolent Creation, Divine Empire, Solstice, and Disincarnate were cool too, and they featured drummer Alex Marquez, who appeared on Demolition Hammers last album titled 'Time Bomb'...which in my opinion was not up to their previous two albums.    I answered your 'German Thrash' question a few weeks ago. I'll provide the link just in case others on this page would like to listen to a few of the German thrash bands I posted at that time:  http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index;...    *When I get home from work I'll come back here and edit if that's OK.

gGZz2EGyaa	I agree 100% with you I think that the licence fee should be abolished never mind boycott them.  There is not a lot of programmes on the BBC that I watch its always the other channels.  It annoys me so much when something happens in the world and all the tv channels get reporters out there incl BBC.  The BBC always have dozens of people there and other channels practically make do with a presenter and cameraman, yet still give a good account of whats happening.  I always think that's my licence fee going to pay for all those people turning up at that event and makes my blood boil. They are also on very large salaries, all coming out of the licence fee.  I won't even get onto the subject of repeats, repeats and more repeats on the BBC.  Right off my soap box now, sorry about that, good question though.|`|5RqvVmKaaa	I agree. Using Jonathan Ross as an example here:   Do we really need Jonathan Ross doing that film previous show whatever it is called - I don't watch it anyway? Do we really need shows on the BBC that other channels can make and screen and pay for anyway - like Jonathan Ross' other shows - which I don't watch anyway. If the market wants to pay people over inflated wages then let it but don't have the BBC partaking in it. The BBC should make and broadcast good wholesome and educational viewing, whether for the masses or for niches. The BBC shouldn't make or pay for mundane or superficial programmes. By the way, do we even need BBC3 and BBC4 tv channels? Do we need two BBC children's' channels? Do we need all the BBC radio channels we have?|`|NTK4XLuDaa	i agree. I pay for a licence and don't watch the bbc at all.|`|SUR1MHqWaa	I agree I pay a license and barely watch anything|`|TDVIb4SBaa	I agree,it goes to pay exorbitant wages to talentless people,BBC these days is a mere shadow of its former self.they should be made to be self financing as the other TV stations are.  With having to generate their own income then perhaps we would get some decent programmes,apart from that it is  nonsense  we have to pay to own  a Tv in this day and age.|`|ESKslyfsaa	I agree.

Amityville horror (the new one, the original bored me), based on "true" events  Wrong Turn, the first one is scary  Joy Ride, my fav scary movie after the Exorcist and the Decent lol.  Thirteen Ghosts, I don't know why but I loved this one.|`|7uqAS3Ozaa	monster house?|`|tLI94qWNaa	The descent   The exorcism of emily rose   Bug   Audition  Silence of the lambs   Dead silence   Beneath   When a stranger calls   Jeepers creepers   Day of the dead   The hitcher  Cabin by the lake   The ring|`|PvPPivLJaa	The Changeling (old movie, not the one with Angelina Jolie)  The Descent  28 Days/Weeks Later  The Strangers  High Tension  [REC]  The Mist|`|7XGa9zcdaa	If you want a horror film that is very different from the typical gore-fest, check out Funny Games.  It tries to be as realistic as possible, as in, this could happen to anyone without warning.  It even has no soundtrack, so nothing takes away from the realism.  It has some long artistic shots, so if your not very patient those scenes may be long.  I recommend it though!

Time lords have an ability where they can regenerate 12 times, giving them 13 lives.|`|CCN2PneTaa	Presumably, the show bosses came up with the idea of "regenerating" (or changing appearance) so they could keep the show alive and so Doctor Who would survive actors quitting, thus enabling them to carry on the show's success.
dfb4a1ebd47e08f0a2763df490af255aaa	From season 1 my favourite episode is 'Pilot' - it's probably the episode I've watched most often from season 1.  There were loads of other great episodes like 'Skin' and 'Devil's Trap' but I just love the very first episode where we meet Sam and Dean and we get the beginning of the mysteries of John's disappearance and Azazel.  There were some brilliant moments between Sam and Dean in that episode too like the 'No chick flick moments' line from Dean and 'You smell like a toilet' from Sam - not forgetting the first time I laughed at one of Dean's lines - 'Agent Mulder, Agent Scully'.  It's also the very beginning of when Sam and Dean are basically reunited after four years apart and their relationship just gets stronger and stronger from that moment on.      From Season 2, I love 'Mystery Spot'. It was such a brilliant episode and so funny!! I love the scene in the diner where Sam is echoing everything Dean says - it was hilarious especially Dean's last line in that bit... "Sam Winchester keeps a ruler by his bed and every morning when he wakes up......" It was brilliant. But it was great the way it went from being laugh out loud funny to being pretty dark and serious very quickly and we got a little glimpse of what life would be like for Sam without Dean. Sam was pretty bad*ss though - especially when he was stitching up his wound. He's such a hottie when he's being dark ; )    One that really stands out for me also in Season 2 is 'Born Under A Bad Sign'. It was great to see Meg return and to see a change of character for Sam (even though it wasn't really him). It was a great episode to watch because it wasn't until about two thirds of the way into the episode that we found out that Sam was actually possessed so it was really interesting the way it twisted and turned from "Evil Sam" acting all confused about what had happened, then knocking out Dean and attacking Jo! I thought it was brilliantly done!! It was also interesting to watch Dean's reaction to it all and to see just how far he would go to avoid killing Sam as John had warned him that he might have to.    From season 3, 'No Rest For The Wicked' really kept me on the edge of my seat because all through the episode it seemed as though there might be a way out of the demon deal for Dean. Ruby offered her help and said that they could actually defeat Lillith. Then they got Ruby's demon killing knife as well, so it seemed like even though from the first episode of season 3 we were told over and over that there's no way out of the deal for Dean, there was a little bit of hope right up until the end that Dean might actually escape. So when the hellhounds actually got him and tore him apart - my jaw just dropped - I still couldn't believe that Dean had been killed!!!! It was a fantastic episode from start to finish. The scene where Sam and Dean sing along to Bon Jovi's 'Dead or Alive' is a classic moment and the little girl who played Lillith was fantastic, she was genuinely creepy. Brilliant episode that it was - I still can't put it in my Top 3 because I just can't bear to watch the end of the episode - it's too painful!!!    Season 3 had so many great episodes though, 'Bad Day at Blackrock' was great!! Sam was just adorable when he lost the rabbit's foot and just had all that bad luck come crashing down on him.  The 'I lost my shoe' line is just so cute and we got Dean's immortal 'I'm Batman' line in that episode too.  I really liked the scenes with Dean and Bela in that episode.  I thought there was good chemistry there and it's a shame we lost her character at the end of the season.    From season 4 - I think 'Lazarus Rising' has to be one of the best season openers ever!! One of the best episodes of Supernatural even! There was just so much brilliant stuff crammed into that episode from Dean's resurrection to his reunions with Sam and Bobby to Pamela's excellent seance and the fantastic appearance of Castiel!! What a guy!!  There were so many elements to 'Lazarus Rising' that made it absolutely unforgettable and even though it was dealing with some pretty dark stuff like Dean rising from Hell there were still some really hilarious moments in it too like when Bobby chucked the holy water in Dean's face and Dean's reaction to Sam's ipod jack in the Impala! It was just such a fantastic episode.  I loved the bit when Castiel showed Dean his wings - it made me think of the season 2 episode 'Houses of the Holy' when Dean was saying how you file 'Angels' under 'bullcrap'! And Castiel was just so suave as he did it - I just thought - "Oh my!"   And I just laughed out loud when Bobby chucked the holy water in Dean's face!! Dean's expression was priceless and it was so smoothly done, y'know, they hug, Dean is in the middle of explaining things he turns around and BAM! Bobby just chucks the holy water right at him with a completely serious expression on his face!! Priceless!! ; )    Sorry, I think I've mentioned about five episodes there and you only asked for three.  Oops.|`|aaabb4b462f9af08a07743dbcce15dc6aa	I would have to say that my favorite episode from season one is "Hell House" because it is so freaking funny. I loved how Sam and Dean pulled pranks on each other and in my opinion the best prank in that episode was when Sam glued Deans hand to the beer bottle.  My favorite episodes in season two are "Born Under a Bad Sign" because Sam is so hot evil and "Tall Tales" because the guys were bickering like a married couple and it was so funny.  My favorite episodes from season 3 are "Bad Day at Black Rock" because of the funny factor, "Mystery Spot" because of "do these tacos taste funny to you?", and "Ghostfacers" because who could resist the ghostfacers.  My favorite episodes from season four are "Monster Movie" because Dean in the lederhosen..OMG, "Yellow Fever" because again, the funny factor. Dean running from everything is hilarious, and "After School Special" because the thought of Dean in those shorts...Nice.    Those are my absolute favorites but I really like them all. They all have funny parts and serious parts and just great supernatural parts.|`|VNum3TKyaa	Season 1 funniest moments  http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qcJXUZA_t...  Season 2 Episode 1 In My time of dying it shows their love for each other  http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=khltHeT8f...  Season 3  Dean Dies Sooooo sad I hated Watching this.  http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w2nxSC7oo...  I really liked this episode too I'm not sure what season it's from tho  http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ctfw63ciH...     I have two favorites in season 4  Dean gets out of Hell Yey !!!  http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l598-JoMh...   Funny as Hell  http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ASZkRM1vx...|`|HK4cW2Vcaa	SEASON 1:    1. Skin. It actually shocked me when the Shape shifter( as Dean) started ripping his skin off.  2. Home. It was cool to see the house where it all went down.  3.  Hell House. The episode was funny and had the sibling rivalry thing going on which was fun to watch. Plus, I like the two amateur ghost hunter guys.    SEASON 2:    1. What is and What Should Never Be. That episode was so heartbreaking to watch and I think it showed exactly the emotions and sacrifices the Winchester boys, especially Dean, where going through.  2. Heart. It was nice to seeing something good happen to Sam, even for the extremely brief time before he had to kill Madison.  3. In My Time of Dying. Just the absolute love between Daddy Winchester and his boys were obviously apparent. It kind of put a positive light on him before he died.       SEASON 3:    1. A Very Supernatural Christmas: I think it grounded the show a little. And I love love love the scene at the end where they exchange gifts and are watching the football game. It was bittersweet actually.  2. Dream a Little Dream of Me: I love how it focused alot on Bobby and shed us a little background information on him. Plus the scene where Dean is fighting with his dream self is  a powerful performance and I think it's the first time he came to deal with his dark feelings toward his father.  3. Ghostfacers: I think it was very funny and it reminded me alot of Asylum from first season. Which was a nice little break from the intense issue of trying to save Dean from hell.      SEASON 4: ( I can't really say for the whole season, but out of the episodes so far)    1. In the Beginning: It was cool seeing his parents when they were young.  2. Heavan and Hell: The ending where Anna just went away left a great mystery which I hope they deal with later.  3. Yellow Fever: It was absolutely hilarious! It had me and my dad cracking up through the whole episode.|`|GRB4vt4Qaa	Hi  My favorites are all mixed up lol from all three seasons.    First would have to be The Benders from season 1, it is really sick what the captors do but i love how it shows how protective Dean is for Sam and how he kept saying even when he was caught, "if you touch Sam, i will kill you" definitely an "aaaaahh" moment lol.    SEcond would have to be Heart from season 2, it is so sad that Sam had to sacrifice Madison after finally accepting Jessica's death. It was so good to see Sam so happy but horrible to see him looking for a cure so desperately. And when Dean cried i was but i was really going for it when i saw Sam's face. Sob Sob.    Third would have to be Lazarus Rising because Dean comes back and because we meet Castiel of course, who is a great addition to the show btw. I love how Bobby and Sam both react to Dean the same way and the whole holy water thing was hilarious. And Deans face when he found out it was an angel that had saved him priceless lol.    What are yours, you haven't mentioned them yet lol?  Thanks  Ashlee xx

It WILL happen though.  My theory is that New Line is hanging on to the project until they have a particularly slow quarter, because they can count on making huge profits as soon as they are released.  Just keep checking amazon.com, they are pretty good about showing release dates for upcoming releases.|`|btrMdy5Uaa	I'm sure they will, I think they are on Blu-Ray

NfXeZ00jaa	The money record labels give you is effectively a loan against what they think you're going to recoup from sales.    When you hear of artists signing million dollar record deals, the artist is actually seeing a small fraction of that million dollars.  That million is spent on recording, marketing, promotion, manufacture, etc, etc, etc.  Even so, if that album sells *a lot*, recoups and goes into profit, that's when the artist might start seeing some "living" money.    These days, artists generally make most of their money from publishing and live performances than actual sales.  If your music is used in a tv ad for Coke, for example and you wrote that song, you're talking a lot of money.|`|6eSreyh9aa	http://www.amazon.com/Music-Business-Han...    The answer to you question is in this book.  It's a classic text, and part of almost every top college music program in the country.  If you want to make a living in music, you need to read this book.    And in today's market, don't focus too heavily on a "label deal," look into other means of distribution.  A lot of musicians are connecting with fans and selling music on the internet.  Maybe not a lot getting rich at it, but it's all part of self-promotion.    Basically, in order to land a record deal, you have to prove to the record company (and I mean, really PROVE) that you have mass audience appeal, adoring fans and excellent marketing capabilities.

And i have no idea how girls go crazy over Bill. HE LOOKS LIKE A GIRL!!!! But besides that, I really like thier music.

JXc0O8G9aa	You're probably looking for bands in the EBM genre.    Look at bands like Velvet Acid Christ, Combichrist, Suicide Commando, Wumpscut, VNV Nation and go from there.
dIjLmMYFaa	You are probably looking for the series what we call in Turkish "Menek?e ile Halil". It is the one that K?van? Tatl?tu? stars in, right?  If it is, try searching with the original name.  good luck!    this is an option, but in Turkish:  http://www.diziizleyelim.com/izle-seyret...|`|oZetG3lCaa	http://axisaccess.com They have a lot of series.

You can usually go to a music store and find either sheet music or a karaoke type CD with just the instrumentals on it. You didn't list which song he's planning on singing (otherwise I would have found it for you) or by which artist, so I don't know for sure if that artist will have just their instrumentals available. So just try the music stores or the internet.|`|5pEMrj8Paa	Instrumental i think ^_^

kIwABSTtaa	She was a outright stuck-up b**** on American Idol.  Even when she was about to get eliminated and she knew she was getting eliminated she struck a pose because she knew the camera was on her.  She just wanted to get on American Idol so she could get her name and body on TV because she just gave up on group week and left her group hanging and the other girls in that group had to suffer the consequences of her fame fill.|`|nmn37Uevaa	I think that she was a terrible singer and the only reason she auditioned was 'cause she wanted her 15 minutes of fame.

Not saying that I didnt enjoy it.|`|YkseyT7zaa	I glad she is finally off, although Seacrest will miss her, since he's still in the closet - lol|`|t1VthewCaa	I think she needs to shut her big mouth and not try and be loud to Cara when she's been on the scene professionally and successfully for more than 10 years.           Come to think of it....you're right....besides Megan from VH1, she's the number one slut bag if I've ever seen one!|`|jtjISk6qaa	lmfao. i didnt see it cause i dont waste my time with american idol but i did see a headline about her in the news.|`|CBCEyns1aa	reminded me of this comedy act where someone impersonated bush when he was asked 'what are your initiaves on the situation with katrina' Hilarous...|`|7IVEMAg8aa	Glad she is gone.

9eBruYtqaa	putting others at danger because you are stupid enough to get behind the wheel drunk should be against the law.    first offense: a big fat fine and no license for 6 months  second offense: another big fat fine and 6 months in jail  third offense: a big fat jail sentence.|`|RP5NnxgUaa	I don't think people should be able to drive drunk. You're stupid if you think, people should.   I think you should have to pay a $500 fine the first time your caught.  72 hours of community service and $500 fine the second time.  Jail third time.  I take drunk driving very seriously! Just imagine your significant other or best friend just going out and getting a gallon of milk and is hit by a drunk driver and nearly killed, or killed?|`|046473fd7f160fe7a30e657aa5faaf75aa	1st offense:  revoke license until completion of safe driver class and 100 hours of community service with Mothers Against Drunk Drivers (MADD)  2nd offense:  permanent revocation of license    3rd offense:  5 years imprisonment if no accident or injuries were involved.  10 years plus restitution for accident, 15 plus restitution for accident w/injuries.  Life without parole for accident related deaths.           There is a clear choice:  don't drink and drive.|`|7fe2e12eefd613a85a2294cb674aea83aa	ANYONE who thinks they can get in a car after drinking shouldn't be driving in the first place. The blood alcohol level should be practically nothing....even one drink and your motor skills are impaired more than you think.  Personally i think there should be a ZERO tolerance policy on drunk driving.    First offense - revocation of license for 1 year.    Second offense - 1-3 years in jail    Third offense - 10 - 15 years in jail.       I think that people are far too blase about the dangers of irresponsible driving. Have you ever seen a fatal car accident?  I think everyone should be forced to look at pictures of car fatalities and wrecks on taking their test so that more gravitas is given to the potential risks of mindlessness.|`|NpqAbZqpaa	Fixed fines are pointless because rich people don't care about petty money.      People drive without licences all the time, they should just take the vehicle, whether it's yours, a lease, a rental, a friends.  Then, the owner (if other than you) can sue you for the money.    A fine that has a minimum (not a max) and can be variable to your salary.  Like an income tax.  If you are a football player and make $15 mil a year, take $5 mil of it..    I also think when someone burglarizes your house, while he/she's in jail, they (the police) should go over and do the same to theirs.    Let their stuff get stolen.    Forget about capital punishment, it doesn't work.    Someone kills someone in cold blood, then give the death penalty to that person's MOM.     LOL.  That'd be funny.  The court finds you guilty of first degree murder, you are hereby sentenced to life in jail.  Ma'am, as his mother, you did a crappy job of raising him with morals, he will be putting you to death.    Problem solved.|`|d9cB8yN8aa	If no one is killed, I think attempted murder would suit.

I do think wearing a seatbelt (over 18) should be a choice. Get the stupid out of the gene pool, I say. But driving drunk endanger the ppl in the car with you and everyone on the road.    1st offense I think is appropriate now. I think the fines add up to like 10,000 and your license is suspended for 6 mo.    2nd offense jail time and no license ever.     3rd offense prison. 10 yr. minimum.|`|BIqXrr9kaa	i think the first time should be 1 week in jail 3 months house arrest 1 year probation and heavy fines....2nd offense 1 year in jail 6 months house arrest 2 years probation and heavy fines...with suspended license for 1 year and 3rd offense would be 5 years in jail 10 years probation and 10 year license lost and extreme fines....too many people die each year because of drunk drivers i think people get away with it because the laws are too lenient if they were harder on the time less people would do the crime|`|WWT45CEzaa	your right to bo stupid yes    lose your license for a year   lose your licensen there is no third offense   get court driving drunk go to jail|`|j6SUkE4Raa	honestly if you can drive drunk and not hit anything you fine............ one day i was so drunk i musta been like three times ovr the limit and yes i was swervin but i didnt hit anything and yet i got arrested? and why?|`|PCE7ri7daa	No I don't think it should your right to drive drunk, because if you get in a accident and you hurt / possibly kill someone then it's just not your right your giving up.    If your not able to drive you shouldn't, your getting in a motor vehicle requires stable eye sight and being mature; your putting you and everyone else around you in danger.    I think it depends on the situation what should happen in each offense, regardless though; you should get punished.|`|IizPFrELaa	2nd offense here in Iowa gets your butt sent to prison!    3rd offense, prison and barred for life|`|NY2fpmvPaa	IDK. The penalties are pretty harsh and expensive. But...the limit...is pretty low, if you think about it.They should set the limit to a higher blood alcohol level, I think.  The police here....they find ANY reason to pull you over. Seriously. They make up things, too. So, they aren't looking for drunk drivers. They just follow people who leave the bar and pull them over. I think that they shoul dactually be looking for people who are endagering others with their drunk driving. Not pulling people over for "not signalling". It's happened to me so many times. I wasn't even drinking, either. My work was right next to a bar, so in one month, the police pulled me over 4 times. The fourth time I told the cop I was sick of them making up stories to pull me over and "catch me".|`|ks2oieV0aa	No, it should not be legal to drive impaired!  1st offense $1000.00 fine 5 days jail  2nd offense $2000.00 fine 3 months jail  3rd offense $3000.00 fine 6 months jail  xox|`|G2WgHzu5aa	I drove drunk when I was 19 and thank God I did not hurt anyone or kill myself. I never got pulled over or anything like that but on the same token I was an IDIOT to think that it was okay. It is never okay to drive drunk and I think 1st offense should be 1 year - no license, 2nd offense - Jail with charges being assault with a deadly weapon.     I have no tolerance for it - I have lost too many friends to drunk driving.|`|cE9QIMNiaa	no i don't believe it should be your choice, because your not only putting yourself at danger, but someone else as well.

0bff81ed3d62dee95cf8cc2a3daa55a4aa	Two and a Half Men always leaves me laughing.  Mind you, the humor is crude and there are many references to sexual matters and bodily functions, but it has been rated one of the best comedy shows on TV and has been nominated for and has received awards.  If you like Wheel of Fortune, you might like Jeopardy!  I enjoy several of the current reality shows, such as Extreme Makeover - Home Edition, American/Canadian Idol, So You Think You Can Dance, Dancing With the Stars, America's Got Talent, and The Biggest Loser.  For information, I like the National Geographic shows, Nova, and The Nature of Things (Canadian).  PBS often has excellent programs, if you can put up with their pledge drive intermissions.|`|YCnDnHh5aa	Try comedy central they have a lot of funny stuff.

fjZb4Cp4aa	I personal do believe in fate!|`|VkVyuq5baa	I believe there is no element of choice available to us, and therefore fate subsequently does not exist*. I believe this because we don't actually get to choose what we do, it was already pre-determined. For example, if I wanted to cook my dinner and was to decide between lasagne and chicken korma I will pick one of them because of who I am. Maybe I didn't know what I was going to choose, but that just means that I didn't know myself well enough. Do other people understand what I am trying to say? Does it make me seem crazy?|`|MpYNJB8Baa	nope|`|B812Gknnaa	yes, yes YES! i most deffinitely am!!!!!!|`|j6SUkE4Raa	my fate will show after death........ heaven or hell|`|spo9KBRpaa	yeah... and im pretty optimistic :)|`|rNvXWMOMaa	yes, i am|`|IHa6FxE6aa	No.|`|edIUAbCxaa	no not really. whatever happens, happens|`|EJ3oiAo5aa	Yes fate and karma!|`|pspRQ9KAaa	YES.

FkhFIIsjaa	It is scientfically possible, and here's why:  Eating cookies makes you salivate.... salivating makes you want to have intercourse... having intercourse leads to impregnation... which thusly leads to lactation.. which causes your boobies to squirt milk out at people whilst you are eating cookies.|`|f8d37f51816f93a01c3756a4f407dca2aa	I'm all sort of giggity here about the milk, cookies, and squirting thingie.

No time to see, in broad daylight,  Streams full of stars, like skies at night.    No time to turn at Beauty's glance,  And watch her feet, how they can dance.    No time to wait till her mouth can  Enrich that smile her eyes began.    A poor life this is if, full of care,  We have no time to stand and stare.

LrKCLZF7aa	Chiron to Chiron aspects don't mean very much because everyone born near your birthday will have that aspect with you. When they are one sign away the have to be at least 27 degrees apart for it to have any meaning at all. Chiron makes its trip around the Sun in about 50 years.      There are 4 things to look for.  1. If two people form a Grand Trine with each other, no matter what the planets are, they will compliment each others lives.  2. Chiron points the way to your Soul Mate. There are 2 main aspects. Chiron Jupiter and Chiron Neptune. When these planets for a trine, conjunction, parallel or contra-parallel in geocentric or heliocentric charts you are looking at the soul mate aspects.  3. Watch out for dangerous clashes. There are quite a few to look for. The Chiron square Chiron is called the Separate Ways Clash. It is caused by being born about 13 to 18 years apart. Many times people with this aspect will stay together for many years and still end up going their separate ways. A Saturn Juno clash is also very bad. Saturn Chiron is the heartbreak clash. This can be over come and because Chrion rules the family, many times what we see is the source of the heartbreak might be a family member other than the spouse, but many times it comes from the spouse as well.  4. Most astrologers will disagree with this one. Juno doesn't point to marriage. Juno rules the love affair and increases the chance of people becoming intimate but it also rules spells, and as such, fades away with time. It rules marriage without children and children without marriage. But Juno rules the NEED for sex and is the most powerful of the sexual planets.

VEXKm1Obaa	I suggest somthing that "ties" your other tattoos together.... it never looks that good when you have a bunch of seperate tattoos that are all totally unrelated in one area. If you can find a way to tie that into your other ones then by all means go for it.|`|V8sDPf2Eaa	it looks pretty good|`|kTc3bfrRaa	A  raven  and  moon!|`|4TmN5Dohaa	no|`|FrHVJSB8aa	tom j you are so right.( not the everyone bit)|`|pspRQ9KAaa	Its cool.    Whatever you do, make sure its original. Nobody likes a clique tat or a carbon copy tattoo design.    You know what I mean? Its your skin, so make it your own.      Good luck and be sure to post photos! You seem very creative so I bet itll turn out great.|`|NpT5hbgMaa	get one that MEANS something or symbolizes something or someone you truly care about.

The princess is beautiful, but I don't think it'll look good on the lower back. That looks like a bicep or calf tattoo.    The ram thingy would be okay on the lower back.|`|EVYSvkIraa	hmm honestly idk if that would look too good on a lower back tattoo|`|n8Db77zbaa	separate pieces on your lower back will look too busy.|`|c6eufHUNaa	yes and no depending the price|`|z0gdLgQ4aa	1.What I do is give the artist a general theme and give them the complete latitude to complete the design. 9 times out of 10 they will really exceed your expectations if they are talented. The best part: since they drew it, they'll be able to recreate it on your body perfectly.    2. Be aware that tattoos on the lower back are very trendy and called "tramp stamps"--a very negative connotation.     Go with your heart and good luck!!|`|Bbmt0e1Aaa	that sounds nice... if your looking for other ideas... im thinking of getting one on my ring finger... roman numeral 9...  which just represents the fact that no body is a perfect ten... and nine is the closest you can get to that, so I will ALWAYS be as good as I can get... and if i get married then my ring will represent that one for me can mabey make me that perfect 10.... just make sure your tattoo is something you can explain to people and you Kids..etc.|`|14gi4aTvaa	That sounds cool, why not?

oaVhxc8caa	2 redneck jokes:  Three Dead Bodies  Three dead bodies turn up at the mortuary, all with very big smiles on their faces. The coroner calls the police to tell them what has happened.     "First body: Frenchman, 60, died of heart failure while making love to his mistress. Hence the enormous smile, Inspector", says the Coroner.   "Second body: Scotsman, 25, won a thousand pounds on the lottery, spent it all on whisky. Died of alcohol poisoning, hence the smile."   The Inspector asked, "What of the third body?"   "Ah," says the coroner, "this is the most unusual one. Billy-Bob the redneck from Oklahoma, 30, struck by lightning."   "Why is he smiling then?" inquires the Inspector.   "Thought he was having his picture taken          One Hot Summer Day  One hot summer day, a redneck came to town with his dog, tied it under the shade of a tree, and headed into the bar for a cold one.  Twenty minutes later, a policeman entered the bar and asked, "Who owns the dog tied under that tree outside?"   The redneck said it was his.   "Your dog seems to be in heat" the officer said.   The redneck replied, "No way. She's cool 'cause she's tied up under that shade tree."  The policeman said, "No! You don't understand. Your dog needs to be bred."  "No way," said the redneck. "That dog don't need bread. She ain't hungry 'cause I fed her this mornin'."   The exasperated policeman said, "NO! You don't understand; your dog wants to have sex!"  The redneck looked at the cop and said, "Well, go ahead. I always wanted a police dog."          GENERAL JOKE    NEWLYWEDS  A couple had only been married for two weeks and the husband, although very much in love, couldn't wait to go out on the town and party with his old buddies.  So, he said to his new wife, 'Honey, I'll be right back.'  'Where are you going, Coochy Coo?' asked the wife.  'I'm going to the bar, Pretty Face,' he answered. 'I'm going to have a beer.'  The wife said, 'You want a beer, my love?'  She opened the door to the refrigerator and showed him 25 different kinds of beer, brands from 12 different countries: Germany, Holland, Japan, India, etc.  The husband didn't know what to do, and the only thing that he could think of saying was, 'Yes, Lollipop... But at the bar... You know... they have frozen glasses... '  He didn't get to finish the sentence, because the wife interrupted him by saying, 'You want a frozen glass, Puppy Face?'  She took a huge beer mug out of the freezer, so frozen that she was getting chills just holding it.  The husband, looking a bit pale, said, 'Yes, Tootsie Roll, but at the bar they have those hors d'oeuvres that are really delicious... I won't be long. I'll be right back. I promise. OK?'  'You want hors d'oeuvres, Poochie Pooh?'  She opened the oven and took out 5 dishes of different hors d'oeuvres: chicken wings, pigs in blankets, mushroom caps, and little quiches.  'But my sweet honey... At the bar... You know there's swearing, dirty words and all that... '  'You want dirty words, Cutie Pie? LISTEN UP, CHICKEN ****! SIT YOUR *** DOWN, SHUT THE HELL UP, DRINK YOUR BEER IN YOUR FROZEN MUG AND EAT YOUR HORS D'OEUVRES BECAUSE YOU'RE MARRIED AND YOUR *** ISN'T GOING TO A DAMNED BAR! THAT **** IS OVER, GOT IT, JACKASS?'  And... they lived happily ever after.        RANDOM JOKES    1. You're not drunk if you can lie on the floor without holding on.  2. Time is never wasted when you're wasted all the time.  3. If you're being chased by a police dog, try not to go through a tunnel, then on to a little seesaw, then jump through a hoop of fire. They're trained for that!  4. "I haven't committed a crime. What I did was fail to comply with the law."  5. "The problem with the world is that everyone is a few drinks behind."  6. "Why don't they pass a constitutional amendment prohibiting anybody from learning anything? If it works as well as prohibition did, in five years Americans would be the smartest race of people on Earth."|`|Y1aAGPURaa	It was snowing heavily and blowing to the point that visibility was almost zero when John (not the sharpest pencil in the batch) got off work.     He made his way to his car and wondered how he was going to make it home. He sat in his car while it warmed up and thought about his situation.     He finally remembered his dad's advice that if he got caught in a blizzard he should wait for a snow plow to come by and follow it. That way he would not get stuck in a snow drift.     This made him feel much better and sure enough in a little while a snow plow went by and he started to follow it.     As he followed the snow plow, he was feeling very smug as they continued and he was not having any problem with the blizzard conditions.     After an hour had passed, he was somewhat surprised when the snow plow stopped and the driver got out and came back to his car and signaled for him to roll down his window.     The snow plow driver wanted to know if he was all right as he had been following him for a long time.     John said that he was fine and told him of his dad's advice to follow a snow plow when caught in a blizzard.     The driver replied that it was okay with him and he could continue if he wanted, but he was done with the Wal-Mart parking lot and was going over to Sears next.|`|YBbND7vlaa	Three women: one engaged, one married, and one a mistress, are chatting about their relationships and decide to amaze their men.  That night all three will wear a leather bodice S&M style, stilettos and masks over their eyes.  After a few days they meet again.....  The engaged girlfriend said: 'The other night, when my boyfriend came back home, he found me in the leather bodice, 4' stilettos and mask. He said, 'You are the woman of my life, I love you...then we made love all night long.'  The mistress stated: 'Oh Yes! The other night  we met in the office. I was wearing the leather bodice, mega stilettos, mask over my eyes and a raincoat. When I opened the raincoat, he didn't say a word. We just had wild sex all night.'  The married one then said: 'The other night I sent the kids to stay at my mothers for the night, I got myself ready, leather bodice, super stilettos and mask over my eyes. My husband came in from work, grabbed the TV controller and a beer, and said,...  'Hey Batman, what's for dinner?'

Carly xxx|`|gGZz2EGyaa	My dad used to turn to me and say answer the phone as you are passing.  Hey dad I am sitting beside you not passing the phone.

I used to have a friend who always made sure her hair looked alright before she answered the phone, what for, no one could see her, a friend thing.|`|fHxpycJSaa	Maybe he owes bad people money.|`|MzZ1xenkaa	no no  maybe he is worried he gonna get a call to say you or a family member has been arrested lol  maybe he expecting some bad news  might be his bit on the side lol    could be getting blackmailed   the list is never ending|`|5PatAvshaa	I know people who do that.

Yes the sand paper will gunk up a bit but to keep the quality of the wood good its the best choice. You can also use paint thinner and a scrapper to take it off.

7QFU0sAOaa	Eric - that's a load of crap. You are basically saying that the last 5,000 years of astrological study was a waste of time.    While it is true that anyone can be compatible with another, compatibility increases when two signs compliment each other.    Go to cainer.com. He's a UK Astrologist, and he knows his stuff.|`|S5H0NmEWaa	All I know is, if I were a girl and I had the chance to go out with a guy called "Cancer man", I'd think twice.|`|aOBmcGAZaa	Signs mean nothing. People have an equal chance of compatability regardless of what time of year they were born.    http://www.badastronomy.com/bad/misc/ast...    That should answer any of your questions.    jbrad - Yes, it is a load of crap. It's no better than religion. Astrology doesn't mean anything. There's no scientific basis behind anything astrologers say. At all. It's all been disproven. I'm sorry if it offends you, but it's the truth.    Edit 2: Topic starter - It's an article proving there's no basis what-so-ever behind astrology. I'm trying to save you from being one of those vapid, shallow girls who thinks reading tea leaves or having some charlatan tell you that there's a meaning in where the stars are aligned. If you want to be fleeced by those type of people after geting educated, that's your perogative. I'm just giving you the option of knowing for yourself.

oaVhxc8caa	JOKES    2 REDNECK JOKES    Three Dead Bodies  Three dead bodies turn up at the mortuary, all with very big smiles on their faces. The coroner calls the police to tell them what has happened.     "First body: Frenchman, 60, died of heart failure while making love to his mistress. Hence the enormous smile, Inspector", says the Coroner.     "Second body: Scotsman, 25, won a thousand pounds on the lottery, spent it all on whisky. Died of alcohol poisoning, hence the smile."     The Inspector asked, "What of the third body?"     "Ah," says the coroner, "this is the most unusual one. Billy-Bob the redneck from Oklahoma, 30, struck by lightning."     "Why is he smiling then?" inquires the Inspector.     "Thought he was having his picture taken      One Hot Summer Day  One hot summer day, a redneck came to town with his dog, tied it under the shade of a tree, and headed into the bar for a cold one.    Twenty minutes later, a policeman entered the bar and asked, "Who owns the dog tied under that tree outside?"     The redneck said it was his.     "Your dog seems to be in heat" the officer said.   The redneck replied, "No way. She's cool 'cause she's tied up under that shade tree."    The policeman said, "No! You don't understand. Your dog needs to be bred."    "No way," said the redneck. "That dog don't need bread. She ain't hungry 'cause I fed her this mornin'."     The exasperated policeman said, "NO! You don't understand; your dog wants to have sex!"    The redneck looked at the cop and said, "Well, go ahead. I always wanted a police dog."        GENERAL JOKE    NEWLYWEDS  A couple had only been married for two weeks and the husband, although very much in love, couldn't wait to go out on the town and party with his old buddies.    So, he said to his new wife, 'Honey, I'll be right back.'    'Where are you going, Coochy Coo?' asked the wife.    'I'm going to the bar, Pretty Face,' he answered. 'I'm going to have a beer.'    The wife said, 'You want a beer, my love?'    She opened the door to the refrigerator and showed him 25 different kinds of beer, brands from 12 different countries: Germany, Holland, Japan, India, etc.    The husband didn't know what to do, and the only thing that he could think of saying was, 'Yes, Lollipop... But at the bar... You know... they have frozen glasses... '    He didn't get to finish the sentence, because the wife interrupted him by saying, 'You want a frozen glass, Puppy Face?'    She took a huge beer mug out of the freezer, so frozen that she was getting chills just holding it.    The husband, looking a bit pale, said, 'Yes, Tootsie Roll, but at the bar they have those hors d'oeuvres that are really delicious... I won't be long. I'll be right back. I promise. OK?'    'You want hors d'oeuvres, Poochie Pooh?'    She opened the oven and took out 5 dishes of different hors d'oeuvres: chicken wings, pigs in blankets, mushroom caps, and little quiches.    'But my sweet honey... At the bar... You know there's swearing, dirty words and all that... '    'You want dirty words, Cutie Pie? LISTEN UP, CHICKEN ****! SIT YOUR *** DOWN, SHUT THE HELL UP, DRINK YOUR BEER IN YOUR FROZEN MUG AND EAT YOUR HORS D'OEUVRES BECAUSE YOU'RE MARRIED AND YOUR *** ISN'T GOING TO A DAMNED BAR! THAT **** IS OVER, GOT IT, JACKASS?'    And... they lived happily ever after.      Random Jokes:  1. You're not drunk if you can lie on the floor without holding on.  2. Time is never wasted when you're wasted all the time.  3. If you're being chased by a police dog, try not to go through a tunnel, then on to a little seesaw, then jump through a hoop of fire. They're trained for that!  4. "I haven't committed a crime. What I did was fail to comply with the law."  5. "The problem with the world is that everyone is a few drinks behind."  6. "Why don't they pass a constitutional amendment prohibiting anybody from learning anything? If it works as well as prohibition did, in five years Americans would be the smartest race of people on Earth."|`|2a9jRZGRaa	Little Sunshine    Little Sunshine comes home from first grade and tells her father that they learned about the history of Valentine's Day.     "Since Valentine's Day is for a Christian saint and we're native americans," she asks, "will God get mad at me for giving someone a valentine?"     Little Sunshine's father thinks a bit, then says "No, I don't think God would get mad. Who do you want to give a valentine to?"    "Osama Bin Laden," she says.     "Why Osama Bin Laden," her father asks in shock.     "Well," she says, "I thought that if a little American Native girl could have enough love to give Osama a valentine, he might start to think that maybe we're not all bad, and maybe start loving people a little bit. And if other kids saw what I did and sent valentines to Osama, he'd love everyone a lot. And then he'd start going all over the place to tell everyone how much he loved them and how he didn't hate anyone anymore."    Her father's heart swells and he looks at his daughter with newfound pride.     "Little Sunshine, that's the most wonderful thing I've ever heard."     "I know," Little Sunshine says, "and once that gets him out in the open, the Marines   could blow the crap out of him."|`|hpxc5szsaa	I got the best joke...why do they call afroturf afroturf?...because all there is black men buried with afros...|`|aahbhllNaa	There was an old preist and he was teaching a new preist how to do the things preists do.

'I mean you shouldnt slap you leg and say 'nooo, what happened next?''|`|G26O8ecfaa	Dad, you're drunk!"        Three guys are drinking in a bar when a drunk comes in, staggers up to them and points at the guy in the middle, shouting, "Your mom's the best sex in town!"    Everyone expects a fight but the guy ignores him, so the drunk wanders off and bellies up to the bar at the far end.     Ten minutes later, the drunk comes back, points at the same guy, and says, "I just did your mom, and it was s-w-e-et!"    Again the guy refuses to take the bait, and the drunk goes back to the far end of the bar. Ten minutes later, he comes back and announces, "Your mom liked it!"    Finally the guy interrupts, "Go home, Dad, you're drunk!"|`|8XpaW67Uaa	"Could I have your number?"    It's not much of a joke, but all the girls I say that too can't stop laughing.

31oOryfoaa	Pink wrote this song at a party hosted at her home, where everyone was drunk or drinking except for her, and she wanted them all to leave. She went to the beach and had a line in her head saying "How do I feel so good sober?". Eventually it had nothing to do with alcohol but with identities. "How do I feel so good with just me, without anyone to lean on?", Pink says in an interview. She also stated that the song was one of the darkest she wrote for the album. Claiming that it is one of the favourite songs if not her favourite from this album. "Sober is a dark, kind of sad song.

dPyfP0ijaa	Google "where's my refund?    or just type it in your browser. It should take you straight to the IRS, I think they will just give you a roundabout date, if it's direct deposit, it will just come when it comes.    Some banks don't update right away, so I would suggest you call your bank use the automated system to see if it's been deposited unless you know your bank updates immediately.    Still check online for your return, the most info you can get is through where's my refund to the irs site.    Sorry.    Last year I got my return direct deposited like 2 weeks before the site said I would get it.    go figure    Oh and check your papers again to make sure you put the correct account and routing number

I wanna feel, all the chemicals inside I wanna feel  I wanna sunburn, just to know that I'm alive  To know I'm alive    Don't tell me if I'm dying, cause I don't wanna know  If I can't see the sun, maybe I should go  Don't wake me cause I'm dreaming, of angels on the moon  Where everyone you know, never leaves too soon    Do you believe, in the day that you were born  Tell me do you believe?  Do you know, that everyday's the first of the rest of your life    Don't tell me if I'm dying, cause I don't wanna know  If I can't see the sun, maybe I should go  Don't wake me cause I'm dreaming, of angels on the moon  Where everyone you know, never leaves too soon    This is to one last day in the shadows  And to know a brother's love  This is to New York City angels  And the rivers of our blood  This is to all of us, to all of us    Don't tell me if I'm dying, cause I don't wanna know  If I can't see the sun, maybe I should go  Don't wake me cause I'm dreaming, of angels on the moon  Where everyone you know, never leaves too soon    You can tell me all your thoughts, about the stars that fill polluted skies  And show me where you run to, when no one's left to take your side  But don't tell me where the road ends, cause I just don't wanna know, No I don't wanna know    Don't tell me if I'm dying  Don't tell me if I'm dying  Don't tell me if I'm dying|`|ZHJUTlXwaa	Don't Tell Me If I'm Dying 'Cause I Don't Want to Know. - Polyvore

Bikini Girl (aka, Katrina, and flat out annoying) is gone, so, whatever.|`|I5OPmgFKaa	Not to burst your bubble, but American Idol is a show for entertainment. Usually the people that are not very good are there just so that they can kick some people off. Or even some people just want them there because of their looks. It is all to do with what the media will do once that point comes. And if everybody thinks somebody is good then American Idol will vote them off. Because that is what keeps them watching. I don't watch it anymore plainly because of what happened 4 or 5 years ago with Constantine and Bo Bice.    So yeah basically a joke.|`|Av9jeRAkaa	might be, i guess the needed somthing to laugh at..LOL    =]|`|QskM0Mfsaa	please ask your american idol questions in the reality tv section. we have had problems here in P&S in the past. it gets almost as bad as the Jonas brother questions in celebrities.  thank you|`|BwMJ3Jlkaa	they werre keeping them around because they were not ugly.

rYA2KCnUaa	Neither, the show was created by Chris Rock, Chis Rock had invented the show because he wanted to viewing to see he childhood experiences were like, and that was being mischievous and getting into trouble all the time.

gGZz2EGyaa	It is a bit annoying but it must be in their nature to talk like that all the time, Philip Schofield on Dancing on Ice does the same thing.  They both seem to shout all the time, you feel like tapping the screen and saying excuse me I wear glasses because I cannot see not because I cannot hear!  (well I would seeing as I wear specs)  Ricki Lake always did have a good show, I have not seen her for a while, it just amazes me where all these weird and wonderful people come from with their problems.|`|qHEpR92Gaa	Well I have never watched Ricki Lake in my life sorry but click here  http://www.youtube.com/results?search_ty...|`|EQdDkSw0aa	LOL not really cos all new yorkers are like that...i just get anoyed at the dumb people who go to the show and expose their stupidity in fron of internation audiences :-)|`|0VHolTVEaa	I think its a new york thing, then again Jeremy Kyle shouts on his chat show. I loved Ricki Lake, some people were crazy when they came on. I was in shock when a freind came to confess to her best freind that she was sleeping with her boyfreind, then the freind confessed to sleeping with her boyfreind, then the boyfreinds came on and confessed they were sleeping with eachother, then the girls confessed they were sleeping with eachother too. So everyone was sleeping with everyone. I was gobsmacked. Things like that happen in the states|`|hUZc273laa	Bless Ricki Lake its one of the Originals! Her and Jerry Springer! I liked the show as it was not always serious there was always a bit of laughter involved instead of all doom and gloom!|`|nosi3KA4aa	It can be really annoying when they shout but most chat show hosts do it, i think its maybe so they can be heard over their audience because quite a lot are very noisy, with jeremy kyle i think he shouts because he gets really riled up at his guests :)

VEXKm1Obaa	I highly recommend Elixir strings, I use them on all of my acoustics.  They have a great tone to them and they last four times longer (while still sounding good) compired to most other brands. Plus they dont rust like most strings do with lots of playing.    They are quite a bit more expensive than other brands but last 10 times longer.|`|AmPldh1maa	oh my god...i was gonna answer...g-string..  m really sorry...i have no idea..|`|mYeq5AvFaa	if its cheap then strings don't matter
RBW9ZX1iaa	Well sammy, really there is no better saxophone. If by pitch you range then tenor and alto are both fairly mid-range. As far as the jazzy tone goes, it has Absolutely nothing to do with whether your playing alto or tenor. I'd base my pick on my size and what I want to get out of it. ( if you are kinda on the smaller end you should play alto)If your just beginning you might want to try alto. It's smaller bore and body make it easier to play at first. If you want a jazzy tone there are a number of things you can do to achieve that, you can get a jazz mouthpiece, just means that it has a smaller chamber but it gets a jazzy sound. there are also jazz reeds that you can buy.  Btw, buy a yamaha or a selmer horn. BARI, Selmer, Tonalin, Vandorin, and yamaha all make good mouthpieces but remember, NEVER buy a mouthpiece online. find one you like in a store and try it before you buy it.|`|d8YMxrqoaa	Both are just about equally viable for jazz but like someone already said, the only variable is what you want to get out of it.  The pitch of a saxophone is a different matter than something like distortion vs. clean sound on guitar.  Jazz has been played on just about all common types of saxophone: soprano, alto, tenor, bari.  On all of the types the sound can be purely jazz and not on any border lines as long as it's played in good style.|`|OUVC1Xjzaa	The best Tennor sax player in jazz is John Coltrane. The best alto sax player was Charli Parker. Listen to both artists compare the sound and you choose. use wikipedia on your computer I plug both artists in 1 at a time so you can select the album you whis to choose. Ciao.

tuvcxnJXaa	Phish fans experienced similar issues with LiveNation ticketing last week.    The truth is that Ticketmaster doesn't care.    We live in a free market society, and as long as TM sells all their tickets, then they're unconcerned with fans getting their fair shot at them.     And as long as the tickets are being sold somehow, someway, they'll continue to not care.    As long as there is a market for hiked-up tickets, it will continue.   Two years ago, I purchased two tickets for a Hannah Montana show in Chicago, turned around and sold them on eBay for a nice profit.     I'd do it again, given the chance.    I applaud Springsteen's speaking up about the issue, but I don't expect much to change.    It has never ceased to amaze me that Microsoft had to go to Capital Hill for anti-trust issues, but TM has never, ever been subpoenaed for the same thing.|`|LU7WB6Poaa	Hmm that's interesting.  I live in the Pittsburgh area, and I recently bought Avenged Sevenfold tickets from Ticketmaster.com, and while surfing for better prices, I noticed that Stubhub.com does have higher prices on tickets.  Thanks for bringing this to my attention!! =]|`|n6oKAac1aa	I would have to say that the basic priciples of economics apply here.  If there is short or limited supply and high demand, the price will be high.  There is absolutely nothing wrong with this.  Anything is only as valuable as someone is willing to pay for it.

hJP9y6kjaa	Try downloading some ASIO drivers, if you haven't already.    ASIO4ALL is a generic set of drivers that works a lot of the time, although hardware-specific drivers from the manufacturer (when available) would be better.    You might also consider getting a USB audio interface - plugging in to your line in and mic in jacks isn't going to give you the best quality sound, even on many expensive sound cards. The parts used for these jacks are often poor in quality and noisy more than anything (relatively speaking).      Saul

The control room (where the instruments, vox, etc are recorded and mixed).|`|6ZMebqRaaa	I agree with first answer! ia have a lot of studio experience. Basic small studio would have just a control room, and a live room, because you can record vocals in the live room. Bigger studios have separated rooms for instruments and vocal, so they have an extra vocal both.

Y1aAGPURaa	A guy was on the side of the road hitchhiking on a very dark night and in the middle of a storm. The night was rolling on and no car went by. The storm was so strong he could hardly see a few feet ahead of him.     Suddenly he saw a car coming toward him and stop.     Without thinking about it, the guy got into the back seat, closed the door and then realized there was nobody behind the wheel! The car starts slowly; the guy looks at the road and sees a curve coming his way. Scared, he starts to pray begging for his life.     He hasn't come out of shock, when just before he hits the curve, a hand appears through the window and moves the wheel. The guy, paralyzed in terror, watched how the hand appears every time right before a curve.     Gathering his strength, the guy jumps out of the car and runs to the nearest town. Wet and in shock, he goes to a restaurant and starts telling everybody about the horrible experience he went through.     A silence enveloped everybody when they realize the guy was serious.     About half an hour later, two guys walked in the same restaurant. They looked around for a table when one said to the other, "Look John, that's the dummy who got in the car when we were pushing it."|`|C1y4sOfFaa	A guy was having a bad day and as he was driving, he rear-ended a vehicle. Coming out of the vehicle was an angry midget. After approaching him, the guy (who was having a bad day) asked the midget:"You don't look happy, which one of the seven dwarves are you?"  And that's when the fight started.|`|POqwp3Fiaa	A man woke up in a hospital bed and called for his doctor. He asked "Give it to me straight. How long have I got?" The physician replied that he doubted that his patient would survive the night. The man then said "Call for my lawyer."     When the lawyer arrived, the man asked for his physician to stand on one side of the bed, while the lawyer stood on the other. The man then laid back and closed his eyes. When he remained silent for several minutes, the physician asked what he had in mind.    The man replied "Jesus died with a thief on either side, and I thought I'd check out the same way."|`|oaVhxc8caa	JOKES    2 REDNECK JOKES    Three Dead Bodies  Three dead bodies turn up at the mortuary, all with very big smiles on their faces. The coroner calls the police to tell them what has happened.     "First body: Frenchman, 60, died of heart failure while making love to his mistress. Hence the enormous smile, Inspector", says the Coroner.     "Second body: Scotsman, 25, won a thousand pounds on the lottery, spent it all on whisky. Died of alcohol poisoning, hence the smile."     The Inspector asked, "What of the third body?"     "Ah," says the coroner, "this is the most unusual one. Billy-Bob the redneck from Oklahoma, 30, struck by lightning."     "Why is he smiling then?" inquires the Inspector.     "Thought he was having his picture taken      One Hot Summer Day  One hot summer day, a redneck came to town with his dog, tied it under the shade of a tree, and headed into the bar for a cold one.    Twenty minutes later, a policeman entered the bar and asked, "Who owns the dog tied under that tree outside?"     The redneck said it was his.     "Your dog seems to be in heat" the officer said.   The redneck replied, "No way. She's cool 'cause she's tied up under that shade tree."    The policeman said, "No! You don't understand. Your dog needs to be bred."    "No way," said the redneck. "That dog don't need bread. She ain't hungry 'cause I fed her this mornin'."     The exasperated policeman said, "NO! You don't understand; your dog wants to have sex!"    The redneck looked at the cop and said, "Well, go ahead. I always wanted a police dog."        GENERAL JOKE    NEWLYWEDS  A couple had only been married for two weeks and the husband, although very much in love, couldn't wait to go out on the town and party with his old buddies.    So, he said to his new wife, 'Honey, I'll be right back.'    'Where are you going, Coochy Coo?' asked the wife.    'I'm going to the bar, Pretty Face,' he answered. 'I'm going to have a beer.'    The wife said, 'You want a beer, my love?'    She opened the door to the refrigerator and showed him 25 different kinds of beer, brands from 12 different countries: Germany, Holland, Japan, India, etc.    The husband didn't know what to do, and the only thing that he could think of saying was, 'Yes, Lollipop... But at the bar... You know... they have frozen glasses... '    He didn't get to finish the sentence, because the wife interrupted him by saying, 'You want a frozen glass, Puppy Face?'    She took a huge beer mug out of the freezer, so frozen that she was getting chills just holding it.    The husband, looking a bit pale, said, 'Yes, Tootsie Roll, but at the bar they have those hors d'oeuvres that are really delicious... I won't be long. I'll be right back. I promise. OK?'    'You want hors d'oeuvres, Poochie Pooh?'    She opened the oven and took out 5 dishes of different hors d'oeuvres: chicken wings, pigs in blankets, mushroom caps, and little quiches.    'But my sweet honey... At the bar... You know there's swearing, dirty words and all that... '    'You want dirty words, Cutie Pie? LISTEN UP, CHICKEN ****! SIT YOUR *** DOWN, SHUT THE HELL UP, DRINK YOUR BEER IN YOUR FROZEN MUG AND EAT YOUR HORS D'OEUVRES BECAUSE YOU'RE MARRIED AND YOUR *** ISN'T GOING TO A DAMNED BAR! THAT **** IS OVER, GOT IT, JACKASS?'    And... they lived happily ever after.

I hope she's a Christian.|`|cUT7n5gOaa	LOOOOL 1st answer!!|`|9tonO25oaa	Yes she is a Christian! And she also wears a purity ring. And her Best Friend Demi Lovato is too! She also wears a purity ring but she wears it as a necklace!   I'm so happy they are Christian!  :D|`|QRbCnBgFaa	OMG the first answer was LOL!!!!    and why do u care? it's not like ur gna marry her.|`|DHwTtPSEaa	I would love it if she was christian. But then that would make me wonder why she is working with disney and doing a show about witchcraft?|`|kRQlW5uNaa	I believe she is catholic....but im not 100% on that|`|3SWjKcAEaa	Are you asking this everywhere? Why do you care? Sometimes its just a private matter.|`|G9PzMfqgaa	Hi She is Christian,|`|c3nyypRmaa	I am not sure. Does it really matter I mean come on she is a great actor isn't she? She is a beautiful young lady with a great voice! And I think as long as we and the kids keep supporting her she will always will be on the right path!

34ruM1eDaa	Prison Break ROCKS! Then there's Heroes, LOST, How I Met Your Mother, Dexter, Privileged    These all are my personal favourites!     Check out Privileged, I've got a feeling you'll love it :)|`|OWXI806qaa	Watch 24 on fox!  I know that you got a lot of responses to this question,  but this is the answer that you need to listen to.  Trust me!  24 is awesome!  It has everything that you could ever want in a TV show.  Drama, action, romance, suspense & really good plot lines.  But I will warn you, it's addictive.    They just began the seventh season a few weeks ago,  but you could probably find the first 6 seasons at   Block Buster.  I don't know if you know anything about it, but it's all   in real time.  Each season is one day. Each episode is one hour.  There are 24 episodes in a season.  It's basically about fighting terrorism & about a really awesome main character named Jack Bauer.    It's not the kind of show whrere you can just start watching   at any point & still know what's going on.  You have to start from the beginning, or at least the beginning of a season.  It comes on monday nights on fox.  CHOOSE 24!  I've seen a lot of TV shows, & it really is the best.  After you've seen a few seasons, (if it takes that long)  You won't ever like anything as much.   Hope I could help.    (check out the link below)|`|Zgs4RncIaa	House is an AWESOME show. Didn't think I would like it, after watching 2 episodes, I went out and bought all 4 seasons.    Grey's Anatomy another great show! Desperate Housewives, Everybody Loves Raymond, CSI - the original Series, (don't care for the New York and the other copy cat one).    That should keep you busy for a while! LOL|`|fcMBMaqgaa	Seinfeld!|`|rRFiSOxuaa	I love House.  He's a very good doctor when it comes to diagnosing strange illnesses, but he has zero bed-side manner.  It's a drama, but it has some funny parts as well. The secondary personal storylines do continue from week to week.  You might enjoy that if you can get past Hugh Laurie talking with an American accent.|`|vDH7CzZYaa	U.S. of tara is amazing!  and its only on the third episode of the first season so you haven't missed to much if you tune into it.|`|7a9ca1e0d676415430d900245a7c2d25aa	Yeah, House is great. It's a medical drama. It's dramatic, but it has it's moments where Dr. House (Played by Hugh Laurie) is just hilarious. I didn't like him at first, but now I'm addicted. lol. If you used to watch Buffy then you might like Angel (it's stopped now, but there were quite a few seasons of it) and Bones, which is still on and is about a crime scene investigation team who works to solve murders. Law and Order and CSI are kinda the same thing as Bones.|`|JKIWCgbUaa	LOST|`|kF9aHWfUaa	America scariest chasing videos.two and a half man although I rearly watch t.v but those are my favourite.|`|uU22GER7aa	Desperate Housewives!!!

These are all serialized dramas that tend to end each episode with a cliffhanger, making you want to find out what happens next.|`|0jwXUs6Raa	House...and Bones....2 offerings from FOX in the US.    House requires that the viewer be somewhat literate....    great viewing, your reality will be suspended!
q0SenAFsaa	Well...     First, if your dad hates your boyfriend you better evaluate that.  If your parents are usually smart and logical people, then they may see something bad in him that you don't.  If not, then hopefully it works out.    There is a fairly new song on the radio that you may have heard.  It is between Country and Pop.  "Love Story" by Taylor Swift.  It is about a girl and boy who are in love, but the girl's father doesn't like the boy.  Eventually, the father changes his mind and lets them get married.  It's a catchy song.|`|GS20sIkMaa	Leader of the pack by Shangri-la's|`|zOWD8ynyaa	She's in love with the boy  Scenes from an Italian Restaurant - Billy Joel  21 and Invincible - Something Corporate  Whatshername - Green Day  I want to Save You - Something Corporate  Hear you Me - Jimmy Eat World  If I Ever Leave this World Alive - Flogging Molly    And my personal favorite: Fairy Tale of New York - The Pogues    Get that song and you will have an Epiphony!|`|mSgBgpKfaa	Love Story by Taylor Swift|`|1aef5daef405ffd196bed2a338a1225caa	Kelly Clarkson just came out with a new song called "Life sucks without You" something like that.

fESZI0X2aa	ok so all the members of the fray are strong believers but they decided not to be a Christian band because if they sang Christian songs and used Christian languages not everyone would understand the meanings.    look after you is actually a love song he wrote for his wife =]    yes i love their new album!i recommend syndicate,say when,absolute,and we build then we break =]    i love the fray with all my heart =]|`|GS20sIkMaa	Love the Fray  Love the album (self-titled)  and the song  You Found Me.|`|GHOOQB1waa	yes.|`|BSqDYs1eaa	the fray are all very devoted chrisitans and have strong beliefs for instance singer isaac slade believes the world was made in seven days.  The fray do not sing a lot of christian songs though because they do not want to be labelled a christian band and they want everyone to enjoy there songs christian or not.    The new album is brilliant because all of the songs are brilliant    Look after you is from the album how to save a life and is in my opiniont the fifth best track off the album after she is, over my head, how to save a life and all at once.  The lyrics for look after you are great  beeee my baby beeeee my baby i look after you    Hope this answer was good for you   The fray are the best band ever i love them

Now to answer your question:  I wouldn't say I was a "fan" per se, but I found her entertaining.  She makes for good T.V.  Every year I make an effort not to get hooked to American Idol, and here I am once again, addicted. :-)|`|c7c42fcd2fd4b62ba49207bebbdb931daa	NO!  That little skank gets on my nerves, lol.

She had her chance to be young and pretty and now that is over some women are insecure and have to put others down to feel better.  Kara is one of them.|`|QK7ssy2Xaa	Haha no I didn't like her. She was too full of herself and wanted all the attention. I'm shocked Simon and Randy gave her what she wanted. She got her 15 min of fame. Goodbye bikini girl!|`|LLNlyaFaaa	no she just went on american idol to get more attention because she's an Attention Whore!! and you're right she is a diva and fricken fake!!|`|kIwABSTtaa	I don''t like bikini girl because she was stuck on herself.  I'll admit she sorta had a voice but she came off as a stuck up b**** and that is not a person I would vote for.  She was also very disrespectful towards the new judge, she may not like her opinion but she didn't have to be a snot about it and she got to Hollywood and didn't devote the time and energy into group week like she should of and caused some major consequences for that other girl.|`|nztycnvfaa	She's attractive, but cannot sing at all.|`|KmC0K59taa	I thought she was a terrible singer.  The only reason she went to Hollywood was b/c Simon wanted to purposely vote against Cara and Paula.  That's also the reason she made it through to the group round.    I knew she would get kicked off after group.  It was obvious she has a horrible voice (and moved her jaw funny when she sang!).  She was too conceited.  She got her 5 mins of fame.  Let's move on!|`|12Nou1pvaa	talentless hack, just trying to get her 15 minutes of fame|`|1TXJDiedaa	I am so glad that I dont have to sit through one more second of her horrible voice.

They've drilled it into people's head so much that they believe this, and so now that Jessica has put on a little weight and has nice curves, she's going to be considered fat.     She's in no way over weight. And, knowing her and the rest of Hollywood, it'll be gone with a few weeks worth of healthy eating and a exercise routine.

0789e50a1396d5b6b9138ceaad0e64f5aa	It made me mad Whip when Simon changed the goal posts and got rid of Rachel.  He said it was because she had been in the bottom 3 times yet at other times they have ALL said it is based on the sing off.  She sang far better than JLS who were out of tune!  I couldn't believe that Cheryl voted her off too.  Seems the rules change to suit the judges.|`|mcJNBa0Baa	She's got a bad attitude for starters! Second of all, she has been in the bottom two three times now! The public obviously don't care much for her. That's why the judges gave JLS a chance. I'm glad she's gone, she's so bloody annoying!|`|NJyYpYiYaa	Rachel is a good singer but she is not as good as the ones left for the next round.  Now you are probably right and I'm possibly wrong but that's the point.  It ain't us that's judging them.|`|f9e413beb00f2fbe1253d10b7f848b53aa	I'm personally glad she went, I like her voice though I really don't like her as a person I'm afraid. |`|8d3e94d9970184d91991339790b16ce6aa	I have to agree that Rachel's last performance was great! But she's not very consistent, and a good singer should be able to sing anything and make it their own. Let's face it, JLS have a better chance of winning than Rachel ever did tbh.|`|pAn0SSmdaa	personally I preferred JLS's performance.  I think they sang well and were original in their choice of song.  Rachel might have a good voice, but she's the same every week AND her attitude stinks|`|LvpjUQSvaa	I voted for Austin, Rachel and Ruth every week.    Austin went first now Rachel has went.    Were the judges correct?     Not in my opinion obviously but it must be said that for all three not enough people voted for them to keep them out of the final two.    Was it the right decision    Possibly. It appears that as much as they hate to admit it public opinion even if it is from folks who do not even watch or vote for the acts may bear some weight.  I also must state I may be totally wrong and they truly believe that JLS will be a more successful and long lived Boyband than Rachel will be a soul singer.    I did believe that JLS should have been in the bottom two but it must also be said that because of the childish behaviour of Louis who insisted that they hold off and sing Rule The World when Dannii had chosen the song for her act.  JLS only got their song choice on Friday am, not as the rest had at the beginning of the week!    All the judges have turns in first song chioce and it was Dannii's turn this week.    I must say that I do not rate JLS, Diana or Eoghan BUT they seem to have a large following.  I would not take any of their CD's even if they were offered me for free.  I would certainly not attend a concert by any of them.    I would attend a concert by Rachel or Ruth and I would buy their music.    I just take heart that my choice for last year Rhiadon is selling out in the classic charts and Leon as likable as he is will never fill the halls or theatres that Rhiadon does.|`|G032Flc3aa	As Simon rightly said it was the third week she had been in the bottom two so obviously she wasn't getting many votes.  I always thought her voice was flat apart from the bits that she shouted and she doesn't pronounce her words correctly either.  She tried to force her way through to the final but thank goodness she was up against a good act and was finally ejected|`|AA11049667	Rachel got a lot of a stick and she may have come over as 'pushy' but in fairness, she's not a little kid so is likely to be more vocal about what she thinks but I suppose people would be happier seeing a 'yes ,sir, no sir' person.     Vickers should have gone a long time ago, she sounds the same no matter what she sings|`|EKUrKzZAaa	Well its her voice obviously..maybe too drained and squeaky..and not as good as the other contestants. As sometimes she's a FAB singer, then the next week it goes down hill I suppose.   But she's got a great personality!  C'mon why as well wouldn't she get votes.     Anyways, just my point of view..    But she's got a great personality!|`|RyRyAjYjaa	I'm not sure.  She's got a good voice but can be very pushy on the judges.  Plus, she's not that popular compared to JLS.  |`|93MwNxO7aa	Could b,  tho out of the 2 i would have sent JLS home.  But neither should have been there at all.    Edit-ty tallulah.|`|d3E3l5Ynaa	I think in the end Simon did her a favor, although she performed well she is constantly in the bottom two, so isn't favorable with the viewers at home, so he put her out of her misery. I think he made the right decision overall JLS performed the sing off better anyway.|`|Uq2rh0zBaa	I was saying the same thing - they repeat week after week that the decision is made on the FINAL PERFORMANCE yet Cheryl said "To me, it's who's got the better chance in the rest of the competition so I'm sending Rachel home " I liked her if no one else did! xxx|`|wo0Tg9IZaa	It was her third time in the bottom two, they couldn't keep putting her through every time.|`|uuMKRWF3aa	It's becasue the judges try  to even it out so that no each Judge has one act (at least) left    dR bad  Louis would have been out if JLS were voted off|`|hnSLVT0Haa	I don't get her never have done. You can take the girl out of her background but not the background out of the girl. She just doesn't have a sellable personality. And why did she shout her final song down the mic?|`|icGFkr5faa	She didn't have the "like-ability" factor, but in my opinion she was a million times better than Diana.      Who said it was a singing competition!!!!!!!!!!!!!|`|jJuqI1Umaa	no i don't think its coz no one likes her, but because she was in the sing off 3 times and it was just her time.    i think they did her a favour by voting her off, her sing off song was the jennifer hudson song from the dreamgirls movie and look where she is now by getting voted off american idol early. |`|92hLSlJcaa	Hi Whip - Think it's more the fact that JLS would sell more cd's, etc. I think she has a great voice for soul but obviously, they can't sing the same genre every week. In saying that, listening to Diana you'd think it WAS the same genre every bloody week!|`|7eyELj1aaa	she had been in the bottom 2 for 2 weeks running, why keep someone in the competition who has no chance in winning & who the public doesn't like  i don't think it's in the rules the judges have to choose on their last performance, they just say that when they're explaining their decision|`|uXXbegw5aa	She should of gone over Austin weeks ago|`|AA10077992	I'd like to think she only went 'cos I was away for the weekend and didn't have the opportunity to vote for her as I have in previous weeks - so blame me, it was my fault !|`|pjecY1cHaa	I HATE HER SO MUCH IM SO HAPPY THAT SHE LEFT!!!!    she is rubbish   JLS was so better  anyway should of left when it was between her and austin   |`|nOLNYsftaa	Give the girl a break...    And I don't think this will be the end of the road for her.|`|6b8e59fd2fd02ff0fc91538b71ecd4d8aa	I love Rachel - i tend to agree with Simon, the public haven't got to see who she really is - maybe if you gave her a chance you might like her - she did have to put up with a lot of criticism from the media, and her life's been difficult enough without the sensationalism they whipped up (no pun intended lol) ..  You know she could have kept it all quite, but she told the truth - all *respect*  to her.  I thought she looked Serene tonight and both of her songs were *amazing*     If she ever makes a CD I'll but it     : )  ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~    Sweet love the name lol

zs38LPu4aa	How do you know I wasn't making YOU think of an elephant and I was already thinking of one when I woke up this morning and transmitted it through cosmic microbeams into your delicate mind.    My thought cannot be controlled or captured as I wear a tin foil hat lined with fuzzy felt with a plastic duck on the top of it.    The foil deflects brain rays, the felt absorbs any that might make it through and the duck...well that's just for fun really and makes me look dashing, plus if I get followed i can hide in a lake|`|tUrrwplgaa	No, but I thought of giraffe|`|BZ5z5pXqaa	whats an elephant|`|tg4K6bIYaa	no|`|d5d2932031efa991954aa3468bb79f0faa	Betcha Can't!

A certain some one ( not you ) has already made my week for me.
rZVKjTV2aa	She's alright. She got alot of bad press, so immediatly people were only picking out the worst in her. She was one of the most disliked though I think. Benshell? Yes chemisty, as friends. Ben could do much better. *cough* me *end cough"|`|Coy59jrQaa	No definitely not!  I really wanted Verne, La Toya or Mikey.     I think there was something between them but of course Michelle has a boyfriend so they obviously just got to be really close friends.|`|n2LrFlxIaa	Normally i would have just brushed this aside, but you have to know....    ITS OVER.  WHO CARES.    Why complain, just laugh about the past!|`|AA11959240	As soon as Verne was voted off in 4th place, I had no idea who was going to win.  I suppose Ulrika was just as good (or bad) as the rest that were left in.  I think this would have given her a big boost because she hasn't been seen on TV for quite a while, so it must be great to know that people have been voting for you.|`|0KGZVVN3aa	Nope  In my opinion, Verne or LaToya should've won [and not because they're American]. They're really nice, interesting people. Ulrika...well...in my opinion, she only won because she's a household name and she's a family woman.   And no, there was no chemistry between Ben and Michelle. They got along because they're both young and have experience in music in Britain.|`|HL3cm1yGaa	No and no, she was one of the most boring contestants ever............and I hope this is the last we have seen of the fecking slapper!    I hope she enjoys driving the 4x4's she said she was going to spend her winnings on............drive them to the end of the earth PUKELRIKAKAKAKA...........please!|`|9OcEJNQkaa	Yes I think Ulrika was the right one to win ... only because I thought she stood up to the men, at times she was funny and she never thought she WOULD win.     Benshell .... I thought he fancied her but she was only playing with him.     roll on bb10. ;-)|`|KlkUj6uFaa	No..    She was so dull and boring!|`|doLyOac0aa	No, the whole country would agree it was a fix,|`|SHeLdu8haa	I wanted Coolio or Latoya or Ulrika to win so...  Definitely was something between Benshell.|`|0789e50a1396d5b6b9138ceaad0e64f5aa	This is a bit of old news and we have debated both on here many times when it was on!  I say no to both.|`|OuTlT8f6aa	No and no|`|VQpu20kDaa	nope!! i dont think so at all|`|hTrqYiwJaa	Yes|`|CPZe3g74aa	1) No she was boring.   2) No, and is she not married?|`|leneiWBlaa	no it was such a fix she got payed the most to go in as well WTF ive never heard off her|`|0VHolTVEaa	Ulrika was herself in the house but personally didnt deserve to win as she didnt provide any entertainment. I wanted Coolio to win. She got paid 175,000 for going in (the highest paid) so its obvious she was gonna win its all fixed.   There is defintly a spark between Benchelle. Michelle liked Ben more thats why she kept crying|`|6d10196c158f49dbb02649f8773591d0aa	No to her winning and where is she now seen more of the others on television she is more than likley arguing with the agents more fee money lol  As for the last bit yes think they both fancied one another and still do|`|Q7Sy9Cnraa	Yes she should of Won as she was a great Housemate and survived three evictions to stay to the end.    She put up with allot of cr@p from the other HM's and still managed to keep her cool and end up winning as she got the most votes from the British Public.    I am happy she won,..it was a shock,...but a good one! ;)    As for Benshell,...there was definitely chemistry there,..Michelle was just trying to deny it,..but you could tell Ben liked her but didn't know where he stood on the whole situation because of her Boyfriend Hugh,...that she kept going on about it all the time!    Ben is probably better of without her,..she's a bunny boiler,she would make Rabbit Stew out of him Lol ;)!|`|0PoyiLJWaa	yes glad she won :)|`|zZ3Uxllfaa	nope Terri was robbed and yes there was definately chemistry between the pair of them thats why she kept getting upset|`|104c298c569130856f8ea29d45c48c6caa	No and no.|`|QxWLAjcnaa	No, she didnt do anything in the house beside tryin to fit in when it was far to late as everybody already knew her true personality. She even said it was fixed, minie mie shouldve won. She won because all the girls phoned in and voted for her, as Ulrika said, im the alst girl left in the house, this is a man house, so im doing this for the girls, so it was girls vs men, not who has the best personality, silly big brother, never goign to watch it again (fan for 5 years, no longer any more)

AA11404742	In the US, it was a coating of herbs, spices, bread crumbs, etc that could be purchased at any grocery store.  You put this mix in a plastic bag, put in individual pieces of chicken, pork chops, etc, and shook it until the meat was coated.  Then you put it in a pan and baked it.  It was an easy way for someone who didn't cook all that well to make a meal with a little more flavor than a regular piece of baked chicken.    It came onto the market in the late 60's or early 70's, I think.  It's still available, but it's not nearly as popular as it once was.|`|bKtpUETnaa	you put it on chicken or pork or fish to make it crispy|`|JfVxCDb7aa	it comes in a box, you put it on your chicken. Put it and the chicken it a plastic bag , and shake it , and then bake it.|`|lkPYYLiKaa	its from ricky bobby    oh hahahhah you're talking about the bread crumb thing haha|`|vYs5j3Xnaa	I'm irish, But i'm not stupid.|`|IP2suWFTaa	Its a box of crumbs and spices mixed together,that you buy for your meat that you are going to bake.For example,if you buy pork chops,you just buy some shake and bake,pour it in the plastic baggy they provide for you,stick the chop in the bag, shake away and bake.|`|T7qgrOJzaa	It's bread crumbs of a sort in a pouch that you stick a chunk of meat in and shake the hell out of it so the meat gets all covered with it. Then you bake it. Quite fun if you like to shake and bake things.|`|zV0IPFIVaa	Sex Position.    Haha lol joke, but think about it lol.|`|AA11523465	It's a coating for chicken.

wkvrBVMAaa	Rofl.    Isn't that the one you told me about? xD  Wow, "She also makes up these little stories like she will go on brb, and 5 minutes later, she returns telling me she went out somewhere and fell off a cliff and started bleeding and stuff." That REALLY made me start laughing!! Lmfao! I'm telling you, she is really, really desperate, how about you ignore her? Just tell her, 'I'm not sure about who you are." Don't worry about hurting her feelings, you're Kyle, you're as nice as can be, I'm sure you'll find someway to make her understand that you know what's going on. And really, I think what she's doing is worse than you telling her what you think straight up.  Do you have her on Y!A? If you do, I'm sure she'll see this question.    Really Kyle, you should tell her what you think. I'm pretty sure she's an 11-year-old little girl who has a massive crush on you. You should stop trying to pretend and tell her. It's the only way to solve your problem..      :]|`|WNNqvaYWaa	just stop talking to her she just wants attention!|`|d0b19b6e53bf5f04f7ade24285468c28aa	tell her to give you a real pic or its over if she cannot be herself with you then why be friends then again thats the net for you|`|t9qXQI19aa	I think the sunglasses are probably why she thinks you're an idiot.|`|rgA4jIsyaa	well maybe you should stop talking to her bigfatlyingass hmmm?|`|1HSuMc3saa	Play the game and do the same to her..either that or block her..what a weirdo!|`|I5AkYjUcaa	BLOCK HER    Don't trust a hoe|`|pspRQ9KAaa	LMFAO People used to actually steal my pictures and do this sort of thing. I've talked to many fakes through out my time online, and the best piece of advice I can give you is only confront her if you dont care about the friendship. Most likely shes not very attractive in real life, and thats why shes using fake pictures. I can almost guarantee that. So she has a low self esteem and doesnt want to face reality - confronting her will bring the truth to the surface and shell be so embarassed that shell get pissed off and angry at you. Most likely in denial. Its only the internet, so if shes a great listener maybe its okay to let her be a fake. Just dont feed into giving her compliments.|`|y29vSr4Zaa	Tell her to fvck off, man|`|Hw3n0nenaa	OMG someone is lying online !

I think your sunglasses are sweet though.|`|7dGpL4mSaa	I'm guessing she's your contact. More that likely, she'll see this question.    Talk to her about it, or block her. She's weird.

It would be okay if she just talked to you normally because plenty people have avatars which aren't them...kind of lame but they do. But if she mentions the picture a lot and starts making up the stories like that....then who knows what else she is capable of "joking" about. Tell her you know it's not her picture, see what she says.    If she annoys you more, stop talking to her.|`|3YJbVYaHaa	MAN-UP!!!!!!!!!!!!!|`|f6dxZXPGaa	take it easy, Just net friends ;)|`|TxIDLrjOaa	That's horrible someone did that to me.

And HEY, i am still alive .|`|uyQppMYLaa	Food-wise, yes. I eat at least 5 portions of fruit and vegetables per day, often more, I eat lots of brown rice, wholemeal bread and pasta, I drink a lot of water, and I only extremely rarely eat ready meals like pizza. I really enjoy healthy food, and I love cooking, so that's easy for me.     However, I do pathetically little exercise. I know that I should, but I keep making excuses, because the gym is too expensive and at the moment the weather is too bad to go jogging. However, I have been told that there is a swimming pool near my university, so I am planning on going there more often. This time to years ago I did Cotswold Marathon training every saturday and I went swimming once a week, so I was a lot fitter.    I don't smoke and the only alcohol that I drink is wine, and even then it's extremely rare for me to drink it and I never drink more than half a glass.|`|c637ab5fb2b9b7fc33da445cd7cd0d19aa	Yes to some extent.You can eat some health food,but the air we breathe , whose Control we do not have is highly polluted.We do not have control over this no matter how much we would like to live health life.Food we eat is highly polluted with agro- chemicals like fertilizer and insecticide we use.|`|601769880381ed0f6423429080479dccaa	When I was younger, I ate anything and everything I wanted.  As I matured, I just sort of gave up the bad habits.  It wasn't as if I looked closely at myself and thought, "I really need to start taking care of myself!".  I seemed to find that I had more time, (as the kids grew up), that I could spend on myself...More trips to the gym, more time for walking/hiking, more time to read through cookbooks to find recipes that were healthier...Not to mention, that as the kids were growing up, I tried very hard to provide balanced meals, exercise, etc., etc., and that sort of progressed into the person I am today at 48.  I don't drink alcohol (not that I'm opposed, it's just that my husband's family are alcoholics, so we don't imbibe), I used to smoke, but gave it up about 10 years ago (Sept. 17, 1999), and with the kids grown and out of the house, we tend to eat simpler, healthier meals which include more fruits and veggies, we walk/hike more (we live in the mountains of Tennessee where hiking trails are numbered in the 1000's), and that's about it.|`|Zky0yJqCaa	Not me........ although I should be.  But I love all that is bad for me.|`|dd28c22317b4d1a575582b739470bc71aa	Yes.  I am definitely living a healthy lifestyle, because for the first time in my life, I am finally living the lifestyle that is positively in my own world, and my feelings for Tobey Maguire are completely and totally gone for good; now, always, and forever.  I say that because Tobey Maguire is in his own world, being Jennifer Meyer's perfect husband, Ron Meyer's perfect son-in-law, and his daughter Ruby's perfect father, and I don't love Tobey Maguire anymore.|`|aLwrpMPXaa	Well I cook at home, go to the gym three times a week yet I smoke.

So yeah definately the skilled one, that would be kinda interesting!|`|AA10229962	Well, if she was a good carpenter willing to do some work on my house, that would be nice.|`|lq1gXmzyaa	youre gonna kill off all your points Diva.|`|3PBlpQFTaa	beautiful, thatll help me be skilled|`|HnvsbEKYaa	i don't think it matters if your ugly or cute wat matters is wat is on the inside not on the outside|`|a40380daa8f8c7c0761b53d6ecfddb40aa	Ugly person.|`|mggll8dRaa	Need More Choices....!!|`|14gi4aTvaa	Ugly and skilled, but my girlfriend is beautiful inside and out, and very skilled [:|`|s6qgkfLxaa	Ugly person who was skilled, definately. Forget external beauty, that all fades in the end and you're both going to die ugly together anyway.     At least die being able to do something really cool. The one thing I've found though is even if you're not physically attracted to someone at the start, the more time you spend with them the more beautiful they are to you inside and out, and it grows on you.    Now I'm going to avoid the fact that I said something sappy, and go get some water.|`|16rD9k32aa	That depends. What are these "Skills"? Is it fun skills, or just something that's going to support me and my Cheetos habit?  Oh who am I trying to kid?  I'd take the girl with skills. You have to do something, or you're just a burden to society. No matter how beautiful you are. Case in point...Paris Hilton (not that I think she's beautiful, but many do). Other than one low grade porno, and a REALLY bad reality show, what has that spoiled brat ever done?|`|d0b19b6e53bf5f04f7ade24285468c28aa	ugly skilled person|`|jtjISk6qaa	the ugly person. at least i wouldnt be supporting some hot lazy ***

Still history has shown me that your first choice is usually the better one so I try to always go with what I thought first.

IizPFrELaa	Serious answer here copied and pasted from answer bag!    The origins are not fully known, but one common explanation was that when the game was first being played back in medieval times, a clock face was used on court. The clock hand would move a quarter for each point. When the hand moved to sixty, the game was over. Therefore, the scoring would be love, 15, 30, 45, and 60 instead of the traditional 0, 1, 2, 3, and 4. Whoever scored 60 (4 points) first would win the game. However, instead of using zero the word love was used. Since, the word love comes from the French word loeuf, meaning egg which symbolizes nothing, it is assumed that love was used because it is represents zero. Another explanation for the use of the word love is because the egg looks like a zero. Eventually, the 45 was shortened to 40, and people quit saying 60 altogether. Interestingly, while the English mispronounced loeuf as love, the French eventually changed back to using zero, while the English kept love. The term love also implies that someone who plays and scores zero points must truly love the game.|`|fOc6PB2Oaa	There is no definitive origin for the tennis score name for 0, "love". It first occurred in English, is of comparatively recent (albeit inexactly dated) origin, and is not used in other languages. The most commonly believed hypothesis is that it is derived from English speakers mis-hearing the French "l'?uf", "the egg", which was the name for a score of zero used in French, because the symbol for a zero used on the scoreboard was an elliptical zero symbol, which visually resembled an egg.|`|wmBK9uASaa	It`s one of those funny French words|`|sVFkMVujaa	from the french word for egg, meaning round, meaning zero.|`|816d0234ce66aef35ce88055d2729beeaa	The word ' love' in tennis terms represents 'nil'. It means to play for love of the game rather than for anything. Thus the word 'love'.|`|b1294888a8e10ac6a8ff0614d97982ccaa	It seems to have been adapted from the phrase 'to play for love (of the game)' (that is, to play for nothing). Although the theory is often heard that it represents the French word l'oeuf an 'egg' (from the resemblance between an egg and a nought) this seems unlikely.|`|dK0nBUQraa	It was decided that it sounded better than shouting 15-Nowt|`|BMYOukx5aa	comes from the French word loeuf, meaning egg which symbolizes nothing, it is assumed that love was used because it is represents zero. Another explanation for the use of the word love is because the egg looks like a zero.|`|PTXX05dhaa	I like to think it came out of compassion for the losing player.   "I have 15, you have zero....but I still love you"!|`|oSig1lQoaa	In tennis scoring love means nothing, hence love-thirty is 0-30. A common (but unproven) explanation for the term "love" to signify a score of zero is that it originates from the French term "loeuf." Another explanation is based on the idea that to do something for love is to do something for nothing (zero).|`|AA11268100	Here's waht the OED says:    love      ? noun 1 an intense feeling of deep affection. 2 a deep romantic or sexual attachment to someone. 3 a great interest and pleasure in something. 4 a person or thing that one loves. 5 (in tennis, squash, etc.) a score of zero. apparently from the phrase play for love (i.e. the love of the game, not for money).|`|UUKWOWhnaa	It's a shortened version of "No good my love,you're crap.Give up now and go home"

I still have not figured out why it was deleted.    However, if that is the worst thing that happens to us, I consider it a good day.

mlGm0UDTaa	I have only practiced blueberry yogurt|`|mggll8dRaa	Yo-Gi......!!|`|AA11878029	yo|`|s6qgkfLxaa	eh.  Yogurt, the "yog-" meant "to condense" and the word "yogur" means to knead.    it used to be yogurut, from the turkish. (hot right) but then it was like in the 11th century it changed to yoghurt, because apparentally nobody cared about spelling or something I dunno.    Eventually I guess in the UK they still sometimes spell it yoghurt.. cause they're nerds too. American's, we're just lazy so we leave out the H always.    Yoga is like a cool word, it comes from the sanksrit root "Yuj" which means unity or like.. "to join" or some crap.     I just realized I have no life.|`|89FgPZ9Waa	LOL.. Well Done...  Good imaginations. i do agree. they're both good in health..    Yoga is a good exercise.  Yogurt is rich in protein.. Yum..|`|Hzf3QK9faa	I like how you look kid, and yer thinkin'. But I thins the Yaley got yer answer correcta mundo. I like cottage cheese better!|`|edIUAbCxaa	ummmm....yea i guess|`|gWYArJ0Haa	sure..|`|bec16h7Taa	Yoga and yogurt are from two different languages and are completely different things. Yoga can't be the root word for yogurt.|`|oP8blO9Paa	i guess|`|SZdVYrSSaa	No, no!    YOGA comes from Yogacara, a school of early Indian philosophy that sprung out of a more spiritual adaptation of the Vedas during the time when many of the Vedic leaders were turning to Buddhism.    YOGURT comes from an early Turkish word for thick, or dense, which is pronounced the same to this day but spelled much differently. It was re-spelled as Yogurt by French missionaries visiting Turkey to spread Catholicism who found a much different and savory Yogurt than we know today, being served alongside the rice stuffing that was eaten typically with the meat of lambs, and it was filled with fat, and terrible for your body.    I assure you, they are unrelated.|`|jF1xH89Caa	It's all healthy for you! Good eye!      LOVE the cute puppy!!! =)|`|YV2n51hqaa	yuck...I dislike yoga/exercise and yogurt...  yogurt is slimy kinda stuff and yoga...well let's just say I don't like to work...|`|xWqKKp0Naa	mile ? the root word for smile ?  something i do right about now  , all over my face .

TBsVYf8Daa	lol.... way to go...    anyone, just give the question a good laugh and chill.|`|LoGtEsi9aa	depends on the sentence...|`|qhU3PDgfaa	leed...  led..      reeeed...  red|`|mQu7mXHAaa	Yes,just that.|`|dNhgIMIPaa	You can pronounce it both ways, just depends how you use it in a sentance.|`|9xgGd9praa	It depends on what context they are being used in.    I read a book. (Pronounced red.)  I like to read. (pronounced reed.)    That's made of lead. (pronounced led.)  I'm going to lead. (pronounced leed.)|`|D8sN8gNFaa	"The Pencil has lead in it" in that sense is pronounced like [led]    "I took the lead in the race" in that sense is pronounced like [leed]    "I read books" in that sense is pronounced like [reed]    "I read that book" in that sense is pronounced like [red]    for the race sentence you could also say "I lead the entire way" which would be pronounced as [led], the reason for that is because it is past tense.     "I lead" [leed] = present tense  "I lead" [led] past tense    the same principle goes for read    "I read" [reed] is present tense  "I read" [red] is past tense    You must be rusty when it comes to tense.|`|sWCWrvi2aa	Leed- like follow the leader  Lead - like the metal  Read- like you are reading a book  Red- like you read the paper|`|52577eb5bd0b6858ac300a21a42802b3aa	Well Lead pronounced led is a metal and lead is to be followed if you know what I mean.... and read (red) is past tense and read as in reed is future tense so they are different words. I believe that is call a homonym.|`|glaUnXgsaa	what a silly question, are you just seeking attention?    follow the leader and shove lead in your throat as you read all the silly responses to your question who read your question title and clicked it.|`|XfWo7AXhaa	i really like Liana's answer :)|`|9iNCQkWlaa	lead (pronounced as to leed the way)  lead (pronounced as led fishing weights or led as past tense of lead)    read (pronounced as reed)  read (as past tense = pronounced red)|`|c3ed7dc313b7c0181d81e54a991e8038aa	both ways for both.|`|NqxDBO2Xaa	what they are the the same|`|oqUci1MNaa	leed (leads to something)  led (the metal)    red (youve read something)  reed (your reading something)    they mean different things|`|qE8olVtaaa	One is a verb, pronounces as 'leed' & the other is a noun, pronounces as 'led'    & both are verbs, just in different tenses, one is the present tense, which pronounces as 'reed' & the other is the past tense, pronounced as 'red'
wAm2fsztaa	i told you to use the other side of the ruler|`|AA11514493	You can ask...    but I'll just smirk. Time to join the rest of the world in using this idiotic mess called metric eh?!  ;)      I try to put F equivalents when I talk temps...but ya know what? I don't convert. I just remember. Math hurts my head too Pretty Lady.  sigh|`|3LL1Hb7Yaa	LOL yes they should the inconsiderate lumps!!|`|po75JU8iaa	I like metric ... easier sorry    BUTT yes, it is too early|`|rMmVuHEhaa	Everybody else in the world is using metric. It is the latest way of calculation and measurement except USA which is still using the old measurement.   ITs time to change.....    Metric is the new system of measurement and calculation in case you don know

AA11111862	Are you trying to get back with him or something? Or are you really just trying to heal a broken relationship? Unless you did something really really bad ( like cheating) then i dont' see why just going up to him and telling him that you had a nice time while it lasted & wish him a good life. If he is going to be an ex, then why the sappy cards, the constant praise & ego boost ? Hon, just try to win him back as you really want that, its obvious. Go to his door, knock on it & just tell him you made some mistakes & will do whatever he wants to fix whats been done. Be honest & direct. If he doesnt want another shot at the relationship, then atleast you will know and can move on.|`|Wi9nmYIEaa	just be honest  :  )|`|E9ZLxgsOaa	Find you someone new he sounds like a loser.  If he cared for you you'd be together.

0GkhVzh5aa	upfront schmupfront... jealously is the way to really get to a person... *chuckles childishly*|`|fFtBqFB6aa	they aren't trying to make you jealous. They are moving on with their lives.|`|QMMmUWwhaa	i would love if an ex of mine would date a woman that would give me something to think about|`|9BB5H7aJaa	that is so strange  and so is what you're asking about. I really don't get it. Do they think we are trying to make them jealous by dating other men? Because that is not the case, BOYS!!!!!!!!|`|zEp6xHacaa	why are you bothering to keep up on an ex|`|P9oP8CS9aa	To show you, it wasn't them that failed in the relationship|`|fkYQN5Xuaa	maybe hes not trying to make you jealous and has actually started dating again|`|tUrrwplgaa	why worry unless you are jealous?|`|VEXKm1Obaa	We are not trying to make our ex jealous....we're dating because we are single again!|`|82bce41e90ec1a1ebe71a56d61363b42aa	Especially while they're still married to you.

Xkas9BG2aa	I think it's both for most famous people.  It's a blessing when they're busy becoming famous  Then it becomes a curse for them when they want their privacy, and the paparazzi won't leave them alone.  That's what the paparazzi became to Princress Diana....a blessing then a curse.|`|NqcnAnC1aa	The blessing is the money.  The curse is the paparazzi (no privacy).|`|68dae82437ede9e0c39dc1f85e7252a5aa	It would be both.  You get V.I.P. treatment and alot of money, which would be sort-of cool but the downside would be the lack of privacy, anonymity, and not knowing who you could trust or why they would want to be your friend.  The fame, or you?|`|vDSRgHxDaa	Well it depends on your personality. If you like all the attention and things like that, then its good for you. Anyway it's neither a blessing or curse, its more of a choice, if you can become famous then you know you will be popular.|`|IHUS8wsbaa	IT depends. if it  is for bad reasons it is a curse. for good reasons a blessing. If you become a legend, good. if you become known as a twat not good. Everything is fine with it. Just not the tabloids and the dump paparazzi|`|QP4goOPkaa	blessing...nobody has fame thrust upon them everyone apart from maybe the monarchy. most go out and seek it.   its very easy to take yourself out of the spotlight...just remove yourself from the scene and eventually people will forget about you...|`|Udv5e92uaa	i honestly think that if someone, like a young person, really wants to act/sing and has a god given talent at it they should give it a try. and if they make it you could say that its a blessing. but when people who have no talent at anything whatsoever, and they are just out there letting everyone see how they act its neither a blessing nor burden, its just stupid. but on the other hand, when parents put their children in the spotlight from an early age and they end up growing up in hollywood, even if they have talent, it becomes a burden. But the people out there who really care about their fans and really have talent i think that they watch themselves and dont let their personal lives get out there for everyone to see, and that makes it in a way a blessing, but not only for them, for the fans to. and in my opinion thats when you could say that they are truly good people and good role models.|`|6HyFHrfIaa	Blessings for some, curses or just stupid moves for others. If I were famous and rich like Pitt or Clooney, who cares what the paparazzi does, as long as you make YOU happy. That is where people lose and fall off because of bad images in mags or just bad shots of them being "ordinary people", they cannot handle it.

They pale with the Grey's of sadness and longing to end of your sorrows and pains  They burn with the whites of innocence and surrender to arguments and selfish desires.  They Settle into the pinks of comfort and quiet desire of a passionate embrace.   The grow with the greens of the summer grass and the glory of the emerald Isle.   They grow black as night as they find helpless moods od despair as mankind continues it's reckless  torment onto the world we live in.

5QI3I4C8aa	Depending on the band themselves, the length of the album and recording contracts etc it can be anywhere between weeks and years, there's no general limit as to how long bands spend in the studio. As long as the music takes I suppose, or nowadays more like as long as the record company will let them. Very often nowadays record companies only sign on bands for a quick fix of popular music. They have on the contract they have to release say 2 or 3 albums a year. The first album the band has spent years working on, but the other two are forced to be scratched together in months and that's why follow up albums are usually poor and a lot of bands drop off the radar altogether. Imo, the music industry has become the moolah industry - it isn't about the music it's about who'll sell the most, quickest.  Anyway to answer the second part of your question - it used ot be the fashion to record all the band together live and a lot of classic records have come about. Certain bands still around record live in the studio, Iron Maiden being an example. With the advent of computer editing and Pro Tools etc recently however it's usually the norm to record drums and bass together, and then add in everything else on top.  It's all about whatever the music requires, what the band want (read as: what the band can AFFORD), what the soundman wants and what sounds best.  Hope this helps :)|`|bH37fDw4aa	it depends on what band/recording company/etc. but average is probably 5 months maybe? but they aren't in the studio EVERY single day.    and typically they record their instruments seperately

Here's how I would rank them.  I like Randy Rhodes the best.    Blizzard of Oz  Diary of a Madman  The Ultimate Sin  Bark at the Moon  No More Tears  No Rest for the Wicked|`|7qt4aQGYaa	best-either blizzard of ozz or diary of a madman    worst-black rain    best guitarist-randy rhoads    worst guitarist-Zakk Wylde (Look what he did to crazy train!)http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=siF2xLFeC...|`|DibFrwxlaa	Favorite is Diary Of A Madman.    I'm not a huge fan of Bark At Moon.|`|R11zYU4daa	they are all bad, if you are a true musicain, there is no bad or good music... and all his songs are bad.|`|76d0f42b082dd7b4403317013a48817eaa	I am assuming you mean solo albums.    Best - The Blizzard of Oz    Worst - Black Rain       I prefer Jake E. Lee but Rhodes is definitely his best.|`|1eQcq4eZaa	Black Rain, his latest, is very underrated...it is actually one of my favorites    his first 2 with Rhoades have kinda been my implied favorites, and I never really tried to dispute the fact that Rhoades was the best, except one time when I tried to convince my drummer and 2nd guitarist that Zakk was better...I lost the argument and gave in to the fact that Rhoades was the bomb    My other favorites are Zakk's albums No Rest and Down To Earth, and who doesn't like the riff in the song No More Tears and his version of Hellraiser    with that being said...my drummer's favorite album is the Ultimate Sin, and I just haven't been able to enjoy it as much as Ozzy's stuff without Jake E. Lee...I actually like Jake Lee in his band Badlands better|`|ShIBKelQaa	i dont like ozzy. you cant under stand a thing he says. and his music is okay but not great|`|sLTvcDMFaa	Favorite: The Ultimate Sin  Worst: None, just some better than others.  OK my least favorite would be the one with Momma(i'm comin home)  Best Guitarist was Jake E lee in my opinion.|`|4LH9RXtuaa	All of them - Ozzy just needs to stay with Sabbath where he belongs.|`|yS61H04haa	I only like diary of a Madman and Blizzard of Oz. both had bits of genius ( Mr. Crowley and Diary of a madman) . They are equal for that reason.|`|1vCoaf08aa	With Randy, I like Diary Of A Madman.    With Jake, I like Bark At The Moon.    And With Zakk, I like No More Tears.

I am never going to forget this story!    I was 13 and had never seen a box of wine before.  Mom was always bringing in new kinds of teas and so I thought that the white wine was tea.

3nV91UY4aa	Georgia today is a balmy 60 degrees and is projected to reach 70 tomorrow.  Spring is almost here for Georgia.  In March, the trees start to bloom with leaves again.  And the grass begins to grow and don't get me started on the pollen.  Everything is covered by April.  Winter serves a very important function on this spinning rock that we live on.  Those cold temperatures help kill those weak trees that may grow sick from disease and infect other plant life in the surrounding areas.  The cold temps also help keep mosquitoes and other pesky insects' numbers low that can over populate quickly in warm winters.  Many mosquitoes can transmit various diseases if they feed off sickly or diseased animals.  Usually those animals do not survive extremely low temps either.  Many mammals like bears hybernate during the winter to conserve energy and reduce consumption on other animals whose populations take a hit during the winter.   Think of the cold as nature's way of sanitizing the environment and spring helps the cycle start all over again.  We may not like the cold, but it does serve a purpose.  Besides, the birds flying south for the winter make great sky shows and then they start flying back in early spring for an equally entertaining display of biology at work.|`|WXAoSr49aa	YES PLEASE!!!! urggg... here in england where i live sometime its minus 6.. its terrible cant wait for spring or summer.|`|AA10253330	Yes, I'm ready for the cold weather to be over.

HA! HA! HA!|`|AA11892241	Probably a variety of ways for the invitation.  For close friends and family, a classy and creative invitation is desired. This is her day. Her wedding day must be perfect and she will not be happy unless every detail is covered. Quality design, printing and wording is what she wants. Dont spare the expense.  Shes worth it.    For persons she communicates via the Internet forums, text, IM, email etc., use the same process. For persons she hardly knows, like me, invite them to the After Party where they can get wild and crazy, get naughty, and French Kiss the bride. :D|`|oQQ9DF9oaa	No... it should blow out your *** here shortly.|`|KnlIJshEaa	3 looks the best haha. |`|AmPldh1maa	aha...me waiting for her to answer ...  whats her response/views/opinions/comments on this.....    well shes not one of my contacts...but shes a Y!A celebrity!!....  so...i would expect an e-mail...i would go...  and i agree with prodigal son...|`|186deac21531919b3fa042717df297e7aa	an email of course ,and yes 'cos I'd go and it better be a naturists wedding , can I be a bridesmaid xxx|`|lAXtdaHVaa	Oh if & when it happens you will all be invited for sure!!!

ioNTTqKfaa	Buy, he gets way too much hate just for having a clean image. I blame Eminem for that line in the real slim shady. He never puts out negative songs and he's a good role model for the kids. Hip hop isn't about being a gangster. While I listen to more hardcore rap, I respect Will Smith for what he's done. He's also been doing his thing a long time and along with DJ Jazzy,  won hip hop its first grammy. While he's not the greatest rapper on the planet, he's not bad by any means. He's definitely a legend.|`|xUxUwloPaa	Buy.

Will Smith is underrated, when many other wack a**es are overrated. People forget that Will Smith started off a s a rapper, not actor. He has lyrical content, regardless of what anyone says. In response to SPICE above me, I agree. Will Smith actually responded to Eminem and a few others as well with his song "Mr.Niceguy" CHeck it out, its dope.|`|DOShS8q0aa	I respect him but i don't enjoy his music or his flow. Yeah its hard to put out a positive image but i like Tribe called quest better for that. Probably sell cuz he sold out to movies  And Eminem has made fun of everyone so you can't really blame him for anything.  Don't hate on my boy M!!|`|gUYcVXMTaa	Sell!!!

First Grammy?|`|q4XUy0Duaa	To be a Hip Hop legend, he would have had to have mastered all four elements which embody Hip Hop.  I've seen the graffiti he did in his videos, and it was garbage.  He doesn't breakdance, or DJ either.  And as far as rap is concerned, he was okay, but not in my Top 500..    SELL|`|a02180765517a018eecd133f0f7b2876aa	Listen to How Many by Killah Priest  http://www.last.fm/music/Killah+Priest  He doesn't use swear words as filler. . .    Mr. Mef doesn't use them for filler here either  http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wDQP8OS1C...    Will Smith's just not legend material. If you asked me if Jazzy Jeff and the Fresh Prince were a legend, I'd give it some serious though. Hell, I'd have to come back tomorrow.

I mean...it's unavoidable. They are always going to have underage drinking. And...it's not like a consumption ticket is really all that bad. It's not even expensive to pay for it. Pretty lame. My husband got one while he was in the Marines and the judge just dropped everything and let him go with nothing.     I think that 21 is a good age limit. I think the main reason they have that limit is because of drinking and driving and the hope that people at the age of 21 will be responsible enough to not drink and drive. However, I look on the arrests page of my county sheriff's office daily, and most of the dui's are issued to people 21-24 years old.|`|XodbjrAjaa	eat drink and be merry for tomorrow we die|`|4TqhDN9Laa	my view is bad it is scary what booze can do i think that in schools should show the danger of alcohol like showing the vomit scene from team america|`|JOAPnhOgaa	i did not drink until i was at legal age  what you and your mates are doing is so bad  the damage you are doing to your body will be unrepairable    i would also lock up all shop keepers who sell alcohol without proof of id|`|6ubffIyWaa	I went to Camp America last year to work and i went to the off-license, forgetting you had to be 21, to by some vodka, when that asked for my ID i was like yerhh sure!

I usually use chunky mild salsa because then my daughter will eat it.  But I also like it hot when I cook for myself.  Throw the chicken in a pan add a little water and top with a whole jar of mild, medium or hot salsa. Spread salsa over all chicken and cover.    Cook in oven on 375 till chicken is almost cooked through then remove cover and add another half jar of salsa over chicken. Finish cooking till salsa is consistency you like. I like mine to get a tiny bit dry on top. The salsa on the bottom will still have a lot of juice to it.    Cook rice.   Cook veggies unless you prefer raw.  Place chicken and rice on plate and top rice with the salsa you cooked the chicken in.    It's a healthy but still hearty and satisfying. The flavor rocks and the salsa keeps the chicken from drying out.     Another thing you can add is some shredded cheese at the end of cooking time.    I hope you enjoy this meal if not tonight then at some later time.|`|vzWGml26aa	get a can of cream of mushroom soap, put in casserole dish, add a can of water, stir this up, add the chicken breast, cook at 350 in oven until chicken is done.  there you have it. you even have gravy to put on the potatoes that you will want to have.  wow lucky's is good. i want that.|`|iwONPromaa	stuff em..with Australian macadamia's  mango.slices .and some Philadelphia cream cheese..wrap in bacon..cover with jam..and bake in the oven till cooked Papa...so tasty..you can come over and get a bag of nuts or substitute with other nuts...enjoy..Papa.

dzzcLVblaa	43Kg is not fat. I think she has a mental problem. Please get her to a doctor or a psychologist before it is too late. I think she has an eating disorder.   Good luck, it's not easy getting through to someone with that kind of problem but be strong.|`|XS0ltAYaaa	This is a disorder of the mind, you can do nothing. I've tried talking to my own sister about her dieting too. She has done the size zero diet & she looks emaciated .... so I know how much concern you have for your friend.   Talk to her parents, the school nurse & the school counsellor, even talk to your school principle if you have too. That's about all you can do, apart from remaining her friend .... Also explain to her that the actions you have taken regarding her welfare was done out of friendship & the love that goes with friendship.  Good Luck. X :-)|`|pNUtnoC8aa	Get off of the computer pronto, and tell her parents!!|`|2ogFk4Amaa	Tell her parents, they will apreciate you for it.|`|kzoUGdg0aa	Tell her parents that you are really worried about her, then, they will probably contact a doctor who will give her the help she needs.    Good luck. x|`|hIrBZS3oaa	There not much you can do.  Hopefully it's a faze / diet and not an eating disorder.|`|AA11111862	Tell her parents or someone at school ( counselor or teacher), but tell them not to tell her you said something. They could talk to her about how skinny she is getting. But listen, if she starts to get unhealthy & obsessive ( even more than she is) you need to get her help. A small problem can lead to a very big problem. Look up anorexia & bulemia and you'll see. Whether or not she will get mad at you or end the relationship, you have to help if she needs it. If you love her you will help.|`|iqw0k3Mlaa	Tell her if she does not get help...it's over!|`|7nRom97Daa	inform her parents|`|KHUEkyNaaa	IT sounds like she has anorexia nervosa, you need to get her some psychiatric help or she might end up killing herself.|`|rLzN7lkdaa	Have somebody else tell her she's not fat    Being your boyfriend and telling her that isn't helping    But hey - I am the image of starving without dying.

(I can still hear my mother, "Practice restraint with tongue and pen."  where was she this morning???)    So my best advice is don't deal with it while you are angry.  Or if she saw this, maybe your work here is done.      Now will someone please email me what is going on?  I'm just getting here :/|`|AA10943329	I have never been in this situation but I have been in other "toxic" friendships and I have slowly let them drift.

I then told them we couldn't be together because of what I had seen during the reading and that "the universe has spoken and I cannot argue with the universe."  I once pretended to be a crazy person. Every time the person called I had a new, crazy personality. Sometimes I was nice, sometimes I was mean, sometimes I pretended to be drunk or high. This took awhile to work as men apparently like crazy women.  I also once lied told someone I was engaged and getting married.

Well please don't be surprised  when you find me dreaming too    Look into any eyes  you find by you, you can see   clear through to another day  I know it's been seen before   through other eyes on other days   while going home --  What do you want me to do,  to do for you to see you through?  It's all a dream we dreamed   one afternoon long ago    Walk into splintered sunlight  Inch your way through dead dreams  to another land  Maybe you're tired and broken  Your tongue is twisted  with words half spoken   and thoughts unclear  What do you want me to do  to do for you to see you through  A a box of rain will ease the pain   and love will see you through    Just a box of rain -  wind and water -  Believe it if you need it,  if you don't just pass it on  Sun and shower -  Wind and rain -  in and out the window  like a moth before a flame    It's just a box of rain  I don't know who put it there  Believe it if you need it  or leave it if you dare  But it's just a box of rain  or a ribbon for your hair  Such a long long time to be gone   and a short time to be there

Not like in looks, there's a lot going on in this cranium. I'm easy going and a sparky attitude. I don't act up or act out, I don't like to play games and I think I'm pretty smart.     4 And what do you like least about youself (not just looks)?  I am easily distracted and unfocused. I can be mentally unbalanced and sometimes I don't make the best decisions.     5 What if anything, do you think attracts the opposite sex to you when they first see you?

QqdXXGN0aa	Rick rolling/rick rolled is when someone puts a missleading title on a video on Youtube that halfway through switches to the music video "Never Gonna Give You Up", by Ricky Astley.

Bale would be looking at his belt thinking "Alfred, you forgot the lube and Please take off that McEnroe mask, I'm the only one who wears Masks in this household"!
zaMTz8z5aa	Oh yes. I find many Indian and also Pakistani men very attractive. I like dark skin and dark eyes. I am blonde so it is really exotic to me.    I am also very jealous of Indian and Pakistani girls. They are immensely beautiful and the traditional clothes are the most stunning creations. they look like queens in comparison to us Western girls in our shorts and mini skirts!!|`|2Zpf6EUwaa	A lot of those guys don't look typically Indian....more hispanic. Either way, I don't rule people out based on their race. Luke Pasqualino is a cute Indian guy.|`|27OUtdOeaa	I was many time in India and I saw many pretty people!|`|0lPt9xJTaa	Nah..but Dev Patel from Slumdog Millionaire is kinda hot..|`|sZHcfnq9aa	depends on which one, i guess. they don't look too bad.|`|vF4MgUWAaa	As with any man it depends on if I am physically sttracted to them and connect with them. it's not about their race. Though I am half Punjabi I don't feel the need to only date indian men|`|xKNjvVLXaa	are you gay or something??..lol|`|BXVyCQZFaa	Absolutely not. I don't like the way Indian guys look OR behave. I've met some real douchebag Indians and I can tell you that I personally mistrust/dislike them. Almost always.|`|PE0oyIWtaa	No way.  Ew.
7Lmdrxicaa	Glad you like Dream Theater, they're the best band on earth! :D    I don't think they have a song that sounds like panic attack :P  But if you like heavy songs like panic attack, I would recomend:    The root of all evil - from theire "octavarium" album  constant motion - from "systematic chaos"  The glass prison - from "six degrees of inner turbulence    The album "Train of thought" have many heavy songs ;D    If you want to hear more from them, I would recomend the albums "Images and words" and "systematic chaos" to start with ;)|`|d3zT4NFaaa	Dream Theatre???

I have an 11 year old and I like to monitor her time on the computer, (there are weirdos out there) however if you are talking about writing..every girl/women should be free to write in a notebook...|`|Ok5JIcmzaa	11 year olds are a lot more mature these days, I know an 8 year old who has a cell phone! It depends on how mature the child is, and how much the parents trust that child.

c7a131a49422566e416ab0237321f07daa	BoBoBo  is one of the most stupidest anime series that is out there and that I have seen. With that I do have to say that it is not surprising to see one of the characters of the series getting beaten up by teddy bears, especially if the character was Don Patch and the reason why I am saying that is because of the fact that he and  many more characters of the show are lame. Anyways, like I said it is not surprising to see that show have pathetic part like that, but you really do have ask yourself what was the creator(s) of the series on when they came up with the idea.|`|24720de85e2aaf3e0332815f63886b7baa	Yes!

bc2f9034a51968f2b5ca5dec19dc698caa	Well, I suppose all the hippie freaks would rather people be used than animals, but the rest of us call testing on humans "inhumane". Notice the word "human" in "inhumane".      **I realize that people are animals, but the hierarchy of creation exists, and those who do NOT believe in it should volunteer THEMSELVES to be tested, but they don't. They'd rather advocate against animal testing while keeping themselves as far away from the tests as possible. In short: They still believe in the hierarchy. They're hypocrites. Animal testing does a lot of good. Although human testing would be more effective (because the affects vary between species), it is just not ethical. The argument that "humans are animals" just seems ridiculous to me. Yes, it's true, but it's also true that we dont' treat them the same. Animal advocates almost always have pets, but if you own a human as a pet it's called slavery, and generally, people in modern times are against such a thing, so animals and people are obviously DIFFERENT socially and I have no problem with having such distinctions. I will never consider a rat, sparrow, fish, dog, etc. to be the same as my mother, father, friends, etc. and only an insane person would say otherwise...     The labor of convicts is actually used in manufacturing and construction sometimes. I'm not sure I can agree with such testing on convicts, but I'd still advocate animal testing occur before human testing.    (I know there are some tests where humans are used, but if they're done legally and correctly, the products are often already pre-tested on animals and they should be safe. Also, participants should ALWAYS be made known of every single possible risk and side-affect of being involved in such a study. It's definitely a risk, because there may be side-affects that were not detected and not mentioned, so althought I'm not against it, I do believe people who volunteer for such things need to be aware of the risks and take it seriously.)|`|jgKb7YVZaa	for that person who says animals are stupid. if you hadent realised people are indeed animals. but we see our selves as the "top of the world & foodchain" asi f were more important than the animals that are tested on. i believe there is no reason to test on animals.|`|TYl7kmPeaa	there are always good things coming out of animal testing... like disease prevention and other medicinal things  you would never use convicts to test things like that... even if they have done something horrible... they are so much smarter than a rat or something.. and then it could turn into something nazi-ish... i dont even wanna think about that  also rats are easy to duplicate so they are easy to test on  i agree that we need to treat animals like animals and humans like humans|`|oDUuAs9Raa	Well,the pigs do look kinda hot with lipstick on...|`|10knD5g0aa	They can't use humans in testing, thats just stupid.. animals are exactly that, animals.. why people think animals should be treated like humans is far beyond me.. get a grip on life, i mean really

65ebcb119095f2166f0bfe15a1643c61aa	The lyrics?    Is it worth the waiting for,  If we live till eighty-four,  All we ever get is,  GRUEL,  Everyday we say a prayer,  Will they change the bill of fare,  still we get the same old  GRUEL    There's not a crust,  Not a crumb can we find,  Can we beg can we borrow or cadge,  But there's nothing to stop us from getting a thrill,  when we all close our eyes and imagine.    Food, glorious food,  Hot sausage and mustard,  While we're in the mood,  Cold jelly and custard,  Pease pudding and saveloys,  What next? Is the question,  Rich gentlemen have it, boys  In dye-ges-ti-on!    Food, glorious food,  We're anxious to try it,  Three banquets a day,  Our favourite diet!  Just picture a great big steak,  Fried, roasted or stewed,  Oh! Food, wonderful food, marvellous food, glorious food    Food, glorious food,  what is there more handsom  gulped swallowed or chewed,  still worth a king's RANDSOM,    what is it we dream about,  what brings on a sigh,  piled peaches and cream about,  six feet HIGH    food, glorious food,  eat right through the menu,  just loosen your belt  two inches and then you,  work up a new appetite,  in this interlude   then, food, once again, food, fabulous, food, glorious food,    food, glorious food,  don't care what it looks like,  burned underdone crude,  don't care what the cook's like,  just thinking of growing fat,  our senses go reeling,  one moment of knowing that,  full up FEELING    food, glorious food,  what wouldn't we give for  that extra bit more,  that's all that we live for  why should we be fated,  to do nothing but brude,  oh food, magical, food, wonderful, food, marvellous, food,  fabulous, food, beautiful, food, glorious food!|`|f5cffc4ddba536602d74f0f0acd60740aa	SURF ON WWW.GOOGLE.COM OR WWW.AZLYRICS.COM

Mine : Right middle cheek.|`|qXq0nmBzaa	Dimples are caused by a genetic defect. How is dimple formation related to genetics? As dimples are a dominant trait, only one gene is required to inherit dimples.     Technically speaking, dimples are visible indentations formed as a result of the underlying flesh of the cheeks. It is hard to believe that dimples are actually the manifestations of a birth defect resulting from a shortened facial muscle. A dimple is the outcome of a fault in the subcutaneous connective tissue that develops during embryonic development.    So, while dimples can be classified as a genetic birth defect, it's a harmless one and doggone cute!

Nigel got really pissed off and told her that she didn't need to be there if she was going to take that attitude.

When Nigel showed the stick to the girls Caridee made a remark about how the stick came out of Nigel's butt after the last panel.  Nigel was not happy with that remark.|`|AA10935583	You can see the episode on YouTube in its entirety; type in: ANTM Cycle 7 episode 10 in the search box and it should pop up.

He was their photographer for this week's shoot. The photo shoot was in a bull ring with a live bull and they were taking pictures with a stick, and Caridee asked Nigel if he had pulled the stick out of his ***. She was joking, but it was disrespectful, so Jay lectured them about it before the photo shoot. After her turn, Caridee apologized to Nigel.     At eliminations, Caridee read a letter she wrote to the judges and apologized again. She was lectured a little more by Tyra, but wasn't in the bottom 2. The two twins were, and Michelle got eliminated for not being as passionate about it as the others.

4c5412b2e3fc63878d1b7db4daa004a4aa	For ibanez: 8/10 to 9/10. depends on model.  a US fender: 10/10 or else 7-8/10 for anything made elsewhere.  Paul reed smith: 7-9/10 depends on quality though expensive...    for a blues sound, a fender strat is the most versatile.  but make sure its made in the US for a better sound.  single coils tend to hum sometimes so you might consider getting a fat strat with one humbucking and 2 single coil pickups.  an ibanez superstrat style is good as well. (H-S-H)  good luck with your guitar search and band! :)|`|70a58c4d1b7a71956e38d6bca4561d15aa	Fender Americans are great. 8/10  Some Ibanez are great. 7/10  Paul Reed Smith are great. 9/10    Blues sound?

It really is that simple. I could list all the blues and indie rock legends who played Fenders, but I won't.   The advantages to owning one are many. They're easy as hell to repair, and if you want to customize the electronics on it you can do so very easily. They're very light, very comfortable and very sturdy. The neck is really narrow so they're a lot easier to play. I could go on and on -- but needless to say, there's a reason people are still playing them 50 years after they first came out. You're talking about an instrument that has stood the test of time.     Plus, I personally like the sounds of single-coils better than humbuckers. They give a hot, dirty tone that makes chords sound crunchy and makes melodies that squeal.|`|368833aa386edaf17387bcc474b79990aa	OK, LET ME GET THIS STRAIT...YOU ARE PLAYING IN AN ALT ROCK BAND AND YOU WANT TO KNOW WHETHER YOU SHOULD USE A GUITAR WITH SINGLE COILS OR HUMBUCKERS?.WELL ASSHOLEE USE A GUITAR WITH FUCKINGG HUMBUCKERS.U WANT THAT BLUESY SOUND?.YOU WANT A BLUESY SOUND IN AN ALT ROCK BAND?.BUY THE FUCKINNG PRS DUMBASS OK?...THEY ARE A GOOD ROCK GUITAR AND YOU CAN PLAY BLUES ON ANY GUITAR WITH OR WITHOUT HUMBUCKERS......IM SURE I DONT NEED TO LIST ALL OF THE GREAT BLUES PLAYERS AND BLUES ROCK PLAYER THAT USE GUITARS WITH HUMBUCKERS DO I GENIUS?....WITH THE PRS YOU CAN HAVE THE BEST OF BOTH WORLDS..|`|5fd559bb4509db5dd5455570fbcc0632aa	Go for the ones that Steve Hackett uses.

A lot of places have a deal where you have to sell a certain amount of tickets to your show for them to let you play there.  Once the people are at the show you can sell demos (that are easily home made nowadays) and you can get money that way as well as getting your music out. But also sometimes the place wants a percentage of the sales that the artists makes. So be aware of those kinds of things.  Just be sure to put some good music out and people are bound to respond somehow. Good luck.|`|c3e989f33e1d6cfd31fc31b5c72b7b03aa	then thats too bad for you

Usually he will take a collection from everyone except the groom to pay for a wild night. The idea is to celebrate one last night of freedom, which is why they traditionally involve strippers and other bad behavior.

XxiHLifGaa	Yes...when I was in Acapulco. I felt coerced by the salesman, signed up and I was sucked in. Sounded great at the time.

It was like trying to run from a pack of wolves.|`|70OHpjySaa	I wasn't suckered into in but I have to admit that was the hardest thing in my life NOT to be suckered into.  I just wanted a free weekend at the beach but those two hours with the salesman were EXTREMELY effective and it was very hard to resist and not sign anything.  Those guys are GOOD!    The trick is to block your mind, not your head, smile and hear the guy without listening to his words. You need as much mind power as they have.    And of course, never, ever, ever, ever sign anything and remind yourself all the time that you promised to yourself that you would not, ever, ever, sign anything.|`|19nQDjEmaa	Never in my life!|`|d5aa461bdb5fa1bfd8158df539805abeaa	What do you mean by "timeshare"?  I don't know if I would call those people "salesmen".  If you want I guess you could just take the "free" vacation.  Don't worry they will not "sue" you.  Just don't "sign" on the dotted line.

bsJVyFtEaa	....hmmm... i can't even understand myself. Cuz when i have a bad mark i often laugh loudly than i always do ....hmm. .and my friend said that  when i was shock i often get more excited than normal... weird me|`|LWEfc0UOaa	if i did i would drown|`|cAAIw6iraa	Um I think a B is good enough you dont really have to cry over that.  But It's normal to get upset over a D.|`|d7HY7NvMaa	Of course it is.. sometimes we try so hard to do good and when we get a bad mark we break down.  Once i studied ALL night and got a C.. i didnt go to school for two days after that because i was so upset.. so YES its most definetly normal.|`|UIzaamJ7aa	If you're an overachieving samurai, then yes it's normal...although if you were an overachieving samurai, you'd do seppuku if you got an A-...|`|i77cV7Q0aa	yea it hapend with me i didnt enter my dreem colige because of one mark & a halfe i kept crying for a week|`|DVqZ8oHjaa	ok so your a perfect person who expect to get all A's right? you have to be realistic its not bad to be hard on yourself for something but getting a B and crying is sort of out there like wise crying forever of a D is a little insane|`|G8IRX295aa	I see you are very selfish and always want to be the perfect straight A student.

It's not the end of the world though, (even though it feels like it). Study extra hard for your next test, ask for extra credit, and you won't even know this grade was there when your report comes out.|`|ym04vDkcaa	crying no but its normal to feel dissapointed if u thought u cud do better|`|GqTSa85daa	No, because I always recognized the fault was mine.|`|0CET3S3daa	Normal for a (D)  but not too normal for a (B)....... but normal if you are brilliant!|`|e41w1Cmuaa	If you cry over a D then you'd commit suicide if you got the grades that I get....    :O|`|AA10598858	Honestly, you're being a huge baby. A 'B' isn't a bad mark. I'd be happy with a 'B', even though I'm expected to get 'A's. One 'B' isn't going to kill you. Even getting a 'D' isn't worth crying about, because it's your fault you got the 'D' in the first place. So instead of crying, just suck it up and work harder.

hJkM8Lygaa	NOOOOO your never too old! go for it girl...23 is not old. Im a singer and the voice can be trained whatever age! i know a lovely lady who is 70 and she started singing at 67, obviously a carrer looks slim for her but shes brilliant!   You should have some lessons, get a PA system togetehr and go out there and gig!  If your wanting a career, thats not to late either....just practice hard and you'll be ready and at a professional level quicker.  As for dance, this is a different story. im 18 studying acting singing and dance, and I find dance incredibly hard as I never trained as a child. Dancing for two years hasn't given me much of a chance to have a dance career...but I dance for fun mostly, singing is my love :) But thats not to say you cannot be a dancer, you may have a natural talent to dance, start with ballet for disapline.      so go for it chik! :D   if you gotta dream...follow it  xxx good luck|`|lBRud4y5aa	Providing you are not tone deaf, you will be fine. That's not sarcasm by the way. Many tone deaf people don't realise it. 23, you're only a baby!|`|Y5IUse1vaa	If you were considering ballet, I think that you would have missed the boat. Music and dance- you should follow your dream. I hope that you seriously give it a go, you should be able to get many places that are willing to nurture your talents...|`|aGXankr2aa	Why don't you just join an Am/Dram group and get your inner thespian  out in the open.|`|PugkFRRpaa	of course you can. you can do anything to if you put your mind to it, and it seems like you really want too. good luck. :)|`|wQEdey24aa	no way...its never too late, and you're only 23. As long as you have passion, anything is possible :-) Go for it and good luck!|`|h7566ejFaa	no! I dont think your too old at all, You can do anything you set your mind too and yes your voice can still be trained, as long as your willing to work hard and not give up! Hope i helped =))|`|KAYFdLfNaa	you're never too old to follow your dreams love. go start singing lessons and see what happens =]|`|hW9PPCBbaa	No, I dont think your ever to old to follow your dreams :) Your still in your earlly 20's and I know loads of people who started out at that age and anyways you can say your more mature, have lived life a bit.|`|LE7aZ2yvaa	No YOU are not too old! I am 23 and am starting from scratch...I have a bachelor's degree in a non-science. I want to go to medical school, so I am taking the basic requirements...I won't be finished with school until I am at least 30 so if you think you're too old, always think of me and you'll feel better ...;)|`|YCLqFB5Oaa	your never too old!!! i wouldn't tell a 99 year old she was too old to start singing! if you want to do it, go for it!!! honestly, our generation changes careers so much...it's expected of us. :)|`|n8OH7sikaa	No, you're not to old to consider a career in Dance and music. Your adult life is just beginning. Just make sure your career choice is fullfilled by the time you are 30.|`|dv1n6lTmaa	Too old....your funny      Never ignore your dreams you will regret them later.

The entertainment industry is a tough business, I was a model/actress for a few years.    It's not easy, but if you got the talent, go for it!!|`|xsifsRUUaa	23?

I wish you the best of luck and success.|`|qUueClvXaa	you are 23, and still have long life to live!! dont give up,  when you think it is too late, thats when it's is not late to start,  if you truly love music, go for it! even if you were at 40s, its still not late!  I know many musicians who started music later than you and they are successful|`|OR41DcHlaa	If you can dream of something, youre half way to achieving it.    :)|`|VEgv5NhSaa	Of course    you can be 50 and still have your voice trainned!

654c7643984cd6b3f7f0f00356056e81aa	Actually, I think they were pretty much into each other, when no one else was looking!  I think Richie had it going on, with that "good boy" image and all, I'm just saying....|`|rh8m6Wepaa	Potsy Webber.  He was dumb and cute.    Ralph was a redhead with freckles -- they're always the last picked.|`|b455e7e5ef382907322ac029d8e12a86aa	Potsy was an idiot who had a stupid name, but he was kind of cute.  Ralph was annoying and had a very unfortunate shade of red hair.  Red hair loses.  Potsy scored more chicks.|`|VKbCQkTRaa	Definitely Potsy...he was a cutie back in the day|`|YdXhZka8aa	Ralph Malph, who'd even sleep with a guy named Potsy?|`|sVFkMVujaa	heheheh, what a question.  probably ralph, 1-0.|`|GRyFxwTbaa	Tough call.    Potsy (reall name, Warren) could sing, but Malph was funny.|`|YX1ddnXmaa	Joni was just the kid sister right? oh no Roy, she was so much more...lol|`|AA11538538	Potsy...he was so hot...    I need to go change my panties now...|`|9060628d0d127fa2d58c88b3dd3c16feaa	I think Potsy was only friends with Richey to get with Joanie.    "How Big a boy Is YA"|`|aajzynKsaa	Potsy.  He was the singer.  Girls always sleep with the singer.  They're so shallow.
nZCT32XCaa	Actually, if I remember right, writer/director Eli Roth saw a website or something, an offer which consisted about similar things we have in the movie (killing people for money). I remember him saying he still doesn't know if it was real or not, but it inspire him to make "Hostel". However, he also stated (and I'm sure about this) that Slovakia, where the story takes place, is a very nice country and lots of people don;t know about it. That's one of the reason why he made the film there.   Anyways, you'll have no trouble in Europe. It's a very nice and colorful (countries are really different from each other) continent. If things like that would happen, it could happen anywhere. Feel free to go to Europe, and enjoy your trip.    Take care!|`|yqe0I5zpaa	The film is based on a website than Harry Knowles (Aint It Cool News) and Eli Roth found that in which you could pay to walk into a room and shoot somebody in the head.      Here is an interview in which he mentions it.    http://suicidegirls.com/interviews/+Eli+...|`|tLI94qWNaa	Anything is possible.  I have heard that in many places you can actually pay to operate on people.|`|NIUkYdL2aa	I'm sure there has been. But don't let that stop you going to Europe. Are you scared or something?|`|5YTWIfFdaa	after the film was made my friends went out to where it was filmed and stayed there for 10 days. they said it was actually a really nice place. but the locals dont like english people much. but were still friendly none the less.   but yeah, stuff like that happens|`|AA10041941	just recently watched Taken that movie was WORSE but if your not a girl I wouldn't worry so much..as for Hostel that was a damned good movie, and I really think if you aren't on your toes and you don't befriend any weirdo like people and do all that crazy stuff they were doing it WON'T happen to you! GOOD LUCK! hahahaha|`|xqrwDmyUaa	"house" is right, Roth did see something online which inspired the film, it was a video of a man who paid money to kill another by shooting him. But the man who was shot was not kidnapped like in Hostel, he was paid money to be killed, he needed the money for his family and sacrificed himself to get that money. Very sad really. Roth does go on to say that he didn't know if the video and story was real but he used it as a basis for his film. It's not likely that something like what happened in Hostel would actually take place because it would be a hard thing to keep quiet. And probably wouldn't be as lucrative as other illegal activities (like selling drugs for example). Just go on your vacation, Europe is lovely.|`|d76Mz5c0aa	most definately =P|`|cEuFh0T8aa	maybe go to hell if you want

VObbRgQwaa	He actually appears in all but one of the adaptations. He was not in That Was Then, This Is Now. According to her website, this is the only film adaption of her book that author S.E. Hinton was not directly involved in. That being the case, I would have to say that Ms. Hinton had a great deal to do with using him in the other films.|`|8c643a48148981e73f897b3569fc6e5eaa	SE Hinton liked him when he was in Tex. Then they  were in Oklahoma filming the Outsiders and director Francis Ford Coppola asked SE if she had any other books to film, since the crew was already there. She had Rumblefish  (He was only in 3 of her 4 movies)|`|szG8G3V6aa	thats not true he also played in something about mary|`|9BrV6UEGaa	not sure. i never noticed that befor .thank for the info.|`|af1752626c14ff8171394da3e2e59bfbaa	well, he played in The Outsiders and Rumble Fish because the same director did both of them...can't tell you about any others though.

AA12036248	Letters from Home- John Micheal Montgomery  There's 2 versions of Letters from Home.  The 2nd version has husbands and wives of soldiers reading their letters.|`|AA11050196	Letters From Home  John Michael Montgomery  Written by:(Tony Lane/David Lee)           My Dear Son, it is almost June,  I hope this letter catches up to you, and finds you well.  Its been dry but theyre calling for rain,  And everything's the same ol same in Johnsonville.  Your stubborn 'ol Daddy aint said too much,  But Im sure you know he sends his love,  And she goes on,  In a letter from home.    I hold it up and show my buddies,  Like we aint scared and our boots aint muddy,  and they all laugh,  Like theres something funny bout the way I talk,  When I say: "Mama sends her best yall."  I fold it up an' put it in my shirt,  Pick up my gun an' get back to work.  An' it keeps me driving me on,  Waiting on letters from home.    My Dearest Love, its almost dawn.  Ive been lying here all night long   wondering where you might be.  I saw your Mama and I showed her the ring.  Man on the television said something so I couldnt sleep.  But Ill be all right, Im just missing you.  An' this is me kissing you:  XXs and OOs,  In a letter from home.    I hold it up and show my buddies,  Like we aint scared and our boots aint muddy,  and they all laugh,  'Cause she calls me "Honey", but they take it hard,  'Cause I dont read the good parts.  I fold it up an' put it in my shirt,  Pick up my gun an' get back to work.  An' it keeps me driving me on,  Waiting on letters from home.    Dear Son, I know I aint written,  But sittin' here tonight, alone in the kitchen, it occurs to me,  I might not have said, so Ill say it now:  Son, you make me proud.    I hold it up and show my buddies,  Like we aint scared and our boots aint muddy,  but no one laughs,  'Cause there aint nothing funny when a soldier cries.  An' I just wipe me eyes.  I fold it up an' put it in my shirt,  Pick up my gun an' get back to work.

01906611ea65b47a6c6748865a2a7f73aa	1. Zero chili.  2. Nessuno di coloro che si fecero incontro alla guardia, and nel bosco/foresta. Se la guardia andava nel bosco, chi gli veniva incontro ne usciva.  3. Quando i due treni si incontrano sono alla stessa distanza da Milano.  4. La nave non si sposta. Occorre un vento che sia esterno e non interno alla nave.    Ciao.|`|9b5728c105d60adb2c327ac2ff3a240baa	1) non aumenta di niente, iil materiale c' gi  2) solo la guardia forestale (stesso indovinello in die hard 3!)|`|43d7274574610eb8a3170fc4aa79175faa	1)  Non aumenterebbe, i materiali per costruire il muro sono gia sulla terra.    2)  Nella foresta nessuno, erano nel bosco.|`|36db3a201275d0cd5a3a614b29e0f2baaa	1) Il peso del materiale per costruire il muro  gi calcolato nel peso della terra a meno che non si sia andati nello spazio a prendere un asteroide.  2) "Si fecero incontro" quindi nel bosco o foresta che credo siano usati come sinonimi in questo caso ci and solo la guardia forestale, tutti gli altri andavano da un altra parte.  Tipo a casa o gi di li...  3) Se i treni si "incontrano" nel moemnto in cui lo fanno sono alla stessa distanza da Milano  4) Se  una nave scuola  molto probabile che sia ormeggiata e quindi che non proceda affatto.|`|Kq5JuI6Caa	1) non aumenta perch la roba per fare il muro  gi sulla terra....  2) la guardia  andata nel bosco non nella foresta...........|`|Mgf31G92aa	ormai ho risposto a tutti i tuoi indovinelli.....  1) non aumenterebbe di nulla  2) solo la guardia forestale  3)alla stessa distanza da milano  4) se  una nave scuola  ormeggiata    p.s. non ne sapevo una, non ho fatto altro che copiarle da sopra. spero che mi perdoni  ciaoooooo|`|HJAzERAUaa	1) nn credo ke il peso aumenterebbe nell'universo e poi i materiali x fare il muro sn gi presenti nella terra..    2) andranno nella foresta 343 fringuelli e 2401 piccoli di fringuelli.. le 7 vekkiette e le 49 gabbie nn vanno nella foresta.. giusto?     3) se il secondo treno  accelerato nn dovrebbe superare i 90 km/h? bisogna vedere anke l'ora di partenza!    4) le navi nn hanno le vele!!    dimmi se ho risp bene.. ho cercato i + piccoli trabokketti..|`|TyZkLt6oaa	1) 0 kg a meno che non porti il materiale per fare il muro da Marte!! ma anche in quel caso sarebbe la massa ad aumentare e non il peso    2) 0 perch la guardia sta andando    3)si incontrano, allora sono nello stesso punto, quindi alla stessa distanza    4) zero, la nave scuola resta ormeggiata|`|kfUEeawcaa	2)bosco o foresta?|`|ORVvt8XKaa	1) non varia  2) nessuno..ma nn era un bosco?  3) quello che va verso Roma  4) di nemmeno un centimetro...con la bonaccia che c'era!|`|O2DHgTfKaa	Alla prima risposta e' ovviamente ZERO, visto che i mateiali per la costruzione del muro non vengono dallo spazio.    La seconda risposta  un bel NESSUNO, visto che se gli si sono fatti incontro, e la guardia ANDAVA nel bosco, significa che se ne stavano andando, dal bosco o foresta che sia.    Se i treni si incontrano, e questa  la risposta alla terza domanda, vuol dire che sono alla medesima distanza da Milano...    Alla quarta non so rispondere, francamente... non colgo il trabocchetto... :)))|`|NGaVkdKAaa	1. I materiali sono presi sulla Terra?? Allora non pu variare il peso.  2. Non si sa nulla del passaggio x una foresta...  3. Quello proveniente da Milano dato che occupa la posizione sul tragitto in direzione di Milano stesso quando si incontrano frontalmente.  4. La nave scuola in periodo di bonaccia  ormeggiata.|`|DTZ4T8w5aa	1) il peso della terra rimane sempre uguale    2)nella foresta non  andato nessuno perche era un bosco|`|a0ef3ca86a9a6e5f4ff6fdc26d29eda7aa	Mi scuso se ripeter risposte gi date, ma non ho tempo di leggerle tutte    (cmq sei un mito ;-))    1) Il peso dipende dall'attrazione gravitazionale che ha la terra sugli altri corpi: lei, di per s, non ha nessun peso.    2) Nessuno, perch erano gi tutti l    3) Quando si incontrano, sono nello stesso punto, quindi alla stessa distanza da Milano o qualunque altro posto.    4) _credo_ che la nave non potesse avanzare in quel modo, perch i soffietti erano a bordo : insomma,  come se tu fossi su un carretto e spingessi contro le sue pareti, il carretto resta fermo, no?|`|wWXpb4Qtaa	1) penso che non cambierebbe di peso la terra, in quanto la materia prima per costruire il muro si trova gi sulla terra e contribuisce gi a formarne il peso...    2) c' differenza fra bosco e foresta?   Se no la risposta dovrebbe essere 7 vecchine, 49 gabbie con 49 fringuelli e 343 piccoli..    3) quando si incontrano sono alla stessa distanza da Milano    4) Le navi scuola stanno ormeggiate per addestrare gli allievi, quindi  impossibile che si trovi in mare in un periodo di bonaccia...    Mi sa che alla seconda domanda ci sono cascata..se le vecchine incontrano la guardia mentre andava nel bosco  logico che loro non sono nel bosco... forse per questa ha ragione Mal    P.s.: grazie per l' "amica"...|`|62b2d9be4efc5180c052615c77093a03aa	1)2.160.000.000.000  kg spero! mi sono perso con gli zeri  2) stanno uscendo dal bosco non stanno andando   mi sa che sono caduto nel trabocchetto non ci sto piu' dentro...ciao e grazie per la fusione mentale....

DUGZa0Zgaa	28 y/o male.  Doctors must be professional, and very liberal with painkillers or muscle relaxers.  Nurses must be female, cute/hot, and have a good, sarcastic sense of humor, and must be into spanking.  I see a neurologist about twice a year for well-controlled epilepsy.  I pick up my medicine at a pharmacy once a month and it takes about 5 minutes so I don't really consider them a big deal.  Last time I visited my neurologist I brought up the idea of switching to a different anticonvulsant medicine (less side effects) he went over the differences with me and we decided it was a good idea--that worked out very well.  I give the system an 8.5.|`|BuJIQ8Jhaa	Home health is wonderful!  When I was disabled with a stroke RN's and LPNs visited me almost every week.  They helped  with bathing, clipping my toenails, and helping me get out of my chair.   Physical therapists, both PT's and PTAs came and gave me instructions on how to do what was previously hard or impossible for me.    I am now a paragon of good health...I am not worthy .   On a scale from one to ten I would rate the care a solid 9.5
HZxX9ke8aa	sagittarius is both a fire sing and mutable. they are looking for the truth and they don't care if it's gonna be painful.    they are curious about how things works, what's this made of, what's beneath this etc. (ruled by jupiter) they are kind of philosophical in this sense. in short they want to "understand" everything.    and if i know a thing, the more you analize things (keep asking why or how forever and you will come to a point that you can't rationally explain things anymore) the more meaningless they get.    some things are there to feel and live and experience, not to understand.|`|40476bbce9e2f1306244d82795226962aa	Well I'm a Sagittarius too and well I don't  second guess myself I just know that there is always something better out there if I don't feel just right. I guess it's just that I know what I want and at the time that might not just be that.

She is a very strong Sagittarius.  Rising, sun, and jupiter conjunct ascendant. But she is as faithful as they come.  This is something I never understood about her.  She is constantly in need of change and when she doesn't get it she moves her furniture around her apartment to fill that need to change things up.      She detests infidelity so I don't get it. I think she gets scared and feels trapped when she can't change things up around her. I ask her about this a lot and she doesn't know the reason herself.|`|sfHGnvxzaa	I'm a sag rising and I can say that I definitely understand where you are coming from. It's just a matter of living in the presence (in matters of relationships). You can't always base a foundation on what ifs.

Weddings are nice and all, but way too overpriced and it is just dumb to start a marriage out with debt... much better to spend wisely or save and pay cash, but still you spend all this money and then the day is over!

Then at quitting time, I'd get in my car and head to McDonald's for a Big Mac, Filet of Fish and some fries to munch while I drive home.  Once I'm home, I'll grab a quick shower, lay on the couch with the remote in one hand while my other hand is down my pants, and I'll watch some ESPN until the wife gets home from her job to fix dinner.  After dinner, I'll lie on the couch with the remote in one hand while my other hand is down my pants, and I'll watch the wife fold some laundry, and run around picking up the house while I'm trying to watch "Dirty Jobs".  Then I'll get a dish of ice cream, leave my bowl on the end table and head for bed, where, with any luck, the little lady will have enough energy to provide a little slap-n-tickle so I can fall asleep quickly and snore all night.|`|SZGirUZkaa	Sex. And Eat Like A Pig, No One Will Know It's Me :)|`|AEaB7xNRaa	I'd play with myself.

At the moment the only dates they have set are these http://mcflyofficial.com/diarydates/ because they did a Uk and Ireland tour in November and December so they aren't doing much for the time being.    Don't get your hopes down though, they're announcing upcoming concerts all the time and they will probably start to announce any shows they will be doing in summer now so keep an eye on their website, myspace etc at all times. ;)        Love McFly, went to see 'em live in Dublin in November! ^_^  Hope you get to see them too eventually. :D

662f22fee7c2157fde2dcf3a87698f3faa	The traveling incense salesman was walking along the dusty road out of New Delhi when he realized he needed a place to sleep. He saw the root gatherers hut in the distance and headed for it. He knocked at the entrance-way and the root gatherer came to the door and said "Yes". The incense salesman said, " I am a traveling incense salesman and I need a place to sleep for the night." The root gatherer said, " You are welcome to sleep here, but you will have to sleep up in the loft with my daughter." He answered  "OK" and climbed the ladder to the loft. The next morning he came down and squatted down next to the root gatherer and accepted a cup of tea. The root gatherer asked, "Did you enjoy sleeping with my daughter?". The salesman  said, "Yes I did very very much, but I have to ask, why was there rice in her mouth?". The root gatherer replied, "Oh, that is not rice, that is maggots, she has been dead for two years."|`|434eca1c56f6c4e55b372801659866eeaa	Great... heheheh|`|c9fc3f982522379b00de0e9eb8454adcaa	God amazing, cant stop laughing|`|8c5ae382fb0e2a95bba6375bf29232a9aa	Nope.

And now my favorite blonde joke of all time.    Three blondes are stuck on an island, when a magic lamp washes ashore.  Being on a number of e-mail lists for jokes, they knew to rub the lamp.  The Genie appears and grants 1 wish each.  The first blonde says, "I want to be smart, so I can get off this island"  Granted! she becomes a brunette and builds a raft, heading for the mainland.  The second blonde says, "I want to be even smarter than that, so I can get off this island!"  Granted!  She becomes a Redhead, and swims the short distance to shore.  The last blonde says, "I want to be even smarter than that, so I can get off this island."  Granted!  The genie turns her into a man, and he walks across the bridge.|`|bb2e758c975f120b993065ad3d3fa944aa	simple .....just log on to santabanta.com then goto jokes ......that s it  joke r realy good  ......blonde ha ha ha .....|`|e582aca422edcb1cdcbb47f263e2f2f8aa	umm r ur friends blonde?

b8f1b637020bd24cbc5977c2505c5a58aa	They already did a Buffy movie before the series.  I don't think it would be a good move to make another movie (as much as I would love to see the cast all together again).  They might be able to pull off a movie from Angel but I think it may be too far gone for it to be very successful.  I wouldn't mind seeing that cast all together again either but I just don't think it would work.  We'll just have to be happy with reruns and dvds.|`|f639092fc925bbd55e7b6272eeb17334aa	No and No. Time for something new.|`|0184ecde9a6f743ba149bac93e339e2faa	Yes they should have cancelled it they were running out of things to do on the show, But I do think they should make a movie, cause I would like to know what buffy and the scooby gang are up to.   Hey I love the last season of Angel.  but that ending left me with a whole lot of question?  They should really make a Buffy,Angel TV miniseries.

So sad that he convinced her she was too good to do Buffy anymore, and that her career has been on a fast sled to hell ever since.    Boreanez would also need plastic surgery before he could play Angel again.  Towards the end, it was getting harder to believe in that whole "never-aging vampire" thing.

When Lifehouse was scrapped, many of the songs were released on The Who's 1971 album Who's Next. Baba O'Riley became the first track on Who's Next.

155250f6bb490737e555e6bc3d6d5d65aa	U;Nee, (Hangul: ??, born Heo Yoon (??, ) May 3, 1981 - January 21, 2007) was a K-Pop South Korean female singer and actress. Before changing to music, she used a stage name Lee Hye-Ryeon (???, ), which was believed to be her birth name until her death.[1] She committed suicide by hanging herself; she had reportedly been suffering from depression.    Heo was known for her sexually provocative image throughout her short music career. Early in her music career, she attempted to create a sexier appearance through plastic surgery, in order to appeal to a larger fan base. Although successful in achieving a sexy image, the changes were quite drastic in comparison to her previous appearance, and did not contribute to increased album sales. Instead of being known as a talented singer, she became more famous for her unusually large chest, as a result of breast implants. Due to declining music industry in Korea, her record label decided that album sales alone was not enough to produce profit, and chose to market her as a sexy singer. Fans of her music decreased while fans of her new sexy look increased, who often urged the singer to reveal herself in Korean edition of Playboy as well as other adult entertainment publications. Heo, who was soft-spoken and reserved in real life, found this difficult to bear.  U;Nee died at her home in Seo-gu, Incheon, South Korea on January 21, 2007 after hanging herself.    U;Nee was supposed to begin filming her first music video of her 3rd album on the 22nd of January which was to be released on February 1, 2007, the same time as her comeback.    In the morning of January 21, 2007, U;Nee's mother, grandmother, and uncle left for church at 10 am. During that time, U;Nee had hung herself in her dressing room with her bathrobe belt from a railing 2 meters high. Her grandmother found her around 12:50pm and immediately dialed emergency help.    Despite her death, U;Nee's management company has stated that they will release her 3rd album as planned on February 1st.    Several stars and friends came to the prayer service held for U;Nee including Maya, Lee Seung Hwan, Kim Jin Pyo, Lee Hwa Sun, Lee Ki Chan, So Yoo Jin, and Park Ye Jin. Maya stated in a short interview that the day before her death, she had received a text message from U;Nee saying hello so the news of her death came as quite a shock.    Rumor across many Korean sites as far as reason for her death was her bout with depression over her lackluster sales for her albums as well as criticism about her image.    After her death, her body was transported to World Hospital. The family has planned to have her body cremated.    Soon after her death, her mother held a press conference at the hospital in order to squash any rumors. She confirmed that U;Nee dealt with bouts of depression and was on medication for her condition. U;Nee was apparently very introverted and suffered from all the pressure she received even as a young child.

She came up with the idea for the program while considering TV shows that she felt would be educational and appeal to her son. Leach then brought together a team who created a series of home videos, Barney and the Backyard Gang, which also starred actress Sandy Duncan in the first 3 videos. Later, Barney was joined by the characters Baby Bop, BJ and Riff .    Although the original videos were a modest regional success, Barney only became a mega hit when the character and format were revamped for series television and picked up by the Public Broadcasting System, debuting as "Barney & Friends" in 1992. The series was produced by Lyrick Studios (bought by HIT Entertainment). For several years, the show was taped at the ColorDynamics Studios facility at Greenville Avenue & Bethany Drive in Allen, after which it moved to The Studios at Las Colinas, Texas. Currently, the series is produced in a northern suburb of Dallas. The TV series and videos are currently distributed by HIT Entertainment.

A Silvina Luna le pas lo mismo y es poruw no les permiten ingresar medicamentos, al suspender la ingesta aumentan muchsimo de peso, conozco muchos casos de mujeres muy delgadas, que de golpe aumentaron un montn, una no creera que tomaban pldoras porque las vea super flacas...pero eran las pldoras que tomaban.|`|phRJXFzgaa	Si, engordo por estrategia, parece que asi nadie la vota para que se vaya porque quedaria atascada en la puerta por el culo enorme que tiene entonces todos tendrian que hacer un esfuerzo barbaro para empujarla y viste.... si entraste a gran hermano es justamente para no hacer ninguna clase de esfuerzo....  Estan pensado en hacerla ganar para sacarla con un helicoptero diciendo que ya estaba programado que el ganador salia en un helicoptero, y asi evitarse tener que romper la puerto o hacer esfuerzo, tambien pensaban contratar algunos de los que se van quedando afuerda de bailando por un sue?o y se quedaron sin laburo, les tiraban unos manguitos como para que la ayuden a salir con el pretexto de "mira a los "???FAMOSOS!!!" que te trajimos para que salgas como la gran ganadora!|`|Y85pWSRKaa	noooo... engordo por no cerrar la boca cuando tenia delante alog de comida!!!

Como muchsimas personas, seguramente Marianela tomaba pastillas para adelgazar de esas que cuando las dejs de tomar te da el efecto rebote, como pas con Silvina Luna.  Ella tomaba pastillas y al entrar a la casa subi diez kilos en pocos meses, sali y recuper la figura.  Esa suba tan abrupta se tiene cuando se toman anfetas para aadelgazar, Marianel debe haber subido mas de diez kilos, la diferencia es mucha entre lo que se ve del principio y ahora, no es normal, es producto del efecto rebote.  Lo digo con gran conocimiento sobre el tema...|`|Y86Qd4suaa	NOOOOO, ENGORD POR ABURRRIDA Y ANSIOSA!|`|nQLBxaZYaa	no creo engordo porq le gusta la papa nomas!!

VAZBvsoRaa	Caramba, te felicito  por tratar de descargar esta pelicula. Es EXCELENTE, nada que ver con el BODRIO que  protagonizara Richard Gere. No s como pudieras descargarla, pero trata de ubicarla en  DVD. Por tu poregunta me fu a wikipedia a ver si lograba algo , pero desafortunadamente el remake que hicieran en USA de la plicula japoonesa llena todas las posibilidades, las cuales  se la dedican a este "producto comercial".., dejando de lado la original... La plicula original japonesa es del a?o 1996 y tiene un valor  extraordinario  porque se basa fundamentalmente en el convencionalismo de las costumbres japonesas que chocan  con el deseo del protagonista por bailar. Estas situaciones no tienen sentido en las costumbres gringas sino en el japn y por eso ,de la excelente pelicula original  no queda sino una  pobre caricatura  "choreta".Insiste, no desmayes, que algun dia podras lograr ver esta obra maestra.   Por si te sirve de algo, yo tuve conocimiento por primera vez de esta pelicula, hace ya unos 4 a?osen un canal de cable especializado en peliculas  que normalmente  no han tenido   mucha difusin, canal originario de  MEXICO y que se denomina  MULTIPREMIER  SALUDOS Y EXITOS  PD: Agrega como anexo ?Como supistes de su existencia?|`|q6DTrZjsaa	Un par de veces la vi en emule... pero no est siempre, es cuestin de estar pendiente.

In a nutshell, the theme of the theories that run through this book say that it has more to do with the mathematical proportions, distances, and ratios of your features and their relation to the rest of your face.      An interesting study done by social scientists was to take the composite of hundreds of faces, lay them one on top of another, until an "average" or the composite of all these faces is reached.  The result was, surprisingly, an aesthetically pleasing face.  Or I guess, more subjectively, a good looking person.  What's interesting about this is that ironically in this case, a beautiful face is a mathematically average face, in the most literal sense.|`|EWDBjGwTaa	"Beauty is in the eye of the beholder" anyway,haven't you noticed how you might not find someone really gorgeous at first,but after a while you develop a crush and you think they'r the most beautiful thing you've ever seen.no matter how you try deny it,the|`|7rtu5n1taa	I think it all has to do with someones perspective.

Add:  Never mind, just watched it on youtube, she is a blonde, learn something new everyday.|`|i36RpnMVaa	long black hair and playing the piano?  it might be Alicia Keys!|`|WnJgAm9Xaa	That really was a broad description!|`|2WBs0QiXaa	Taake on meeeee..
24e3c53ff3387eb84f27768983042d80aa	I'm sorry but what do the themes of Nightwish's song have anything to do with Tarja's religion?  Yeah Nightwish may use Pagan symbolism but they use christian themes as well, and a lot of their themes are fantasy based, but anyway those lyrics come out of Tuomas' head so I'm pretty sure they have nothing to do with the members' (and in this case ex-member) believes.    Anyway to answer your question I don't think she is, for example in this interview she said "an amazing gift from God to be able to love and be loved"   http://i72.photobucket.com/albums/i168/d...    Someone who might be more informed may be able to correct me if I'm wrong and present you with more accurate proof.|`|azIA2rmRaa	No, Tarja is Lutherian.

P0Fjh59Eaa	Trevor (Todd) is one of those actors that can actually express his emotions in his eyes and subtle facial expression. he doesn't need to SAY much of anything, it's just so powerful.  like when he was on the roof w/Marty and you could see the pain and confusion and broken heart in his eyes and all across his face...on the verge of tears but still fighting them back! OMG he looks like a lost puppy when he does that.    i hate it so much i LOVE IT! lol (if ya know what i mean).|`|nndflDc9aa	Todd I love Todd always and I always. I  understanding why he do what he do even if it turn out to hurt him self or his family. And he always pay the price big and that his loosing his kids and wife.Enought punishment as it is.|`|1WaMTSZvaa	Todd is pitiful and pathetic!  A poor excuse of a human.  There's nothing brave about Todd.|`|721dc6202a3a978496a32f796da9793caa	The Todd character is my favorite. I must admit that I liked Roger Howarth better as Todd. The character lost a bit of it's comical edge when he left. However I do like this guy. I just hate when the writers have him do things that we know go against the character they created. I think the confession was something Todd would have done. He would throw himself in front of a train to save Starr.(I hated when they had him raise his hand to her like he was going to hit her during the time when they were going through their struggles over her and Cole. It was too far out of character for him.) I believe confessing to everyone today was also something that Todd would want to do anyway. It always seems that what he really wants is to be understood. I don't know why they don't just put him and Tea together and leave it there. She gets him more than any other character ever has or will. She's completely loyal (a trait he values) , she's not ready to throw him under the bus over every little thing (like Blair) and she is obviously over the moon about him.|`|NGNeT3rYaa	Yes, it was a little of both! That is Todd for you!|`|Y5jv0ybFaa	The confession scene was awesome!! I actually felt sorry a bit for Todd...............|`|dmxnblomaa	I thought it was trully sincere, everybody is getting on my nerves about Todd, we all know he need help, and he is trying, he is victor lord's son, those genes are not that good. I am so really sick of Natalie awhhhhhhhh! (with a scream)|`|fjNxzd6Baa	One of the best OLTL scenes in months.|`|RVABrMeSaa	Too little too late, however sincere.  I saw Blair goes after Tia about time someone did.|`|d5K8wORqaa	i didnt see it yet  im sure it will be GREAT  i love todd    EDIT    that was amazing. i felt the emotion. and blair, she should not hav hit tea. oh no.

Why, you ask?  http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index;...|`|zVdNQowNaa	MF Doom, Pharaohe Monch    I keep hearing their names but haven't got round to listening to them, I'll see them mentioned on here and think to myself "I'll check them out on Youtube in a min" and forget all about it, then weeks have past and it's not a good first sign, so I avoid the artists because their cursed. Most artists usually just fall on my lap and I have no say in whether I here their song or not....then I check out their albums, then check the wiki, then speak about them on here, then get labeled as a stan, then get posters and t-shirts of them in real life

Most people can't stand her voice,  but I for one, think it's unique and beautiful.

rUVjyzbdaa	anime is any form of animation created/written/drawn in Japan by a Japanese company. all other form of animation (created from united states etc.) would be classed as a cartoon.   anime sometimes gets confused to be only for adults but that is not true, there are many forms of anime for different audiences. for example hello kitty.|`|CInHTKJcaa	i will...  if you remove that ******* bleeding nun out of the picture  come on...don't scare me!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!|`|3N2ElzcQaa	There's no difference. They're both cartoons. Anime is basically Japanese anime.    People just like the cartoons made from Japan (East side).     Some people don't like how the animation is made in America. Its too wacky or something.    I am an Anime fan as well.     These are my reasons for liking anime:    -artwork  -plot  -situations or characters that we can relate to  -I have an admiration and devotion to the creators  -anime has a bunch of genres mixed in, mostly comedy and fantasy|`|6rR7LTl1aa	People will obsess over anything (just look at the Twilight franchise...) but here are the commonly held main draws of anime, vs. other animation styles (a note: these apply generally, not necessarily in all cases):    -More involved plot  -Deeper character development  -More detailed animation style    (EDIT: BM0027: It's actually French -- the Japanese just imported the term.  They do that a lot.)    EDIT2: dvk, my fiance would like to have a word with you.|`|X40Ww89qaa	it must be better than having a girlfriend|`|UHv71AN5aa	The best I can figure is anime characters have big eyes, but I guess if you gave Bugs Bunny big eyes would he then be anime?

I had a friend once... and all she would do ALL DAY was sit at her computer watching anime. I guess it's better than... human interactment.|`|btrMdy5Uaa	Anime is generally made by Japanese I think, things like you would see late night on the cartoon network (Adult Swim) but a lot of its for adults, adult situations, and they have big eyes and small mouths, and cartoons are the other extreme, lol, I personally don't get most of it, theres only ever been one I liked, and now I don't remember whats it called, lol, but I know A LOT of people who watch it|`|AA11090788	Anime is just the Japanese word for cartoon, but in America it means Japanese cartoons. Regular cartoons are usually considered the American kind, where the drawings aren't so great, and the story/plot aren't either.  The reason why anime is so popular is because the stories they have cater to an older audience as well as the younger ones.|`|2zbumhGIaa	Anime is different because although it is animated, it has a deeper meaning behind it. It conveys messages that children wouldn't get. It is actually very mature and meaningful, and serves as an escape from Japanese society.|`|tNVaEig7aa	anime is an japanese produtions and cartoons are an united states productions|`|13ab2eb08c3b29c7e124e905335006c0aa	anime and cartoons   cartoons in the usa are done in only 1 week  very lazy and rush the artwork , vs anime lets say one show is only 30 mins its what they   put in the background lots of moving things cars or clouds   and even lighting.  now the lighting is something that the cartoons have tryed to use that same light and 12 years later they still cant get it  right,   all ways take anime over any cartoons theres more detal in the artwork  anime rules

UbNOv4a1aa	yes. i have. as to whether it is really LOVE or just a creation of the mind trying to make one feel like they matter. i've also wondered what it stems from. if there is like one moment that just makes you love somebody or if it evolves over time.     there are people that you supposedly love 'naturally' like your family. that i do not believe in. your family can be just as good or bad as anyone else.|`|EsufC1qhaa	it is a bit like energy and laws of physics.......love can neither be created nor destroyed  ! it just passes on. no one knows the origin.|`|Wr3l34EUaa	Yeah, and I'm still wondering where it comes from..|`|j6SUkE4Raa	i wonder when it comes?|`|8IzeMTmLaa	It's a biochemical in the brain that induces a powerful addiction/obsession.|`|3yNh5jO8aa	I only have one love.

uUzbqGh5aa	It is gross on too many levels. At this point, the fact that Eric isn't Ridge's bio-father doesn't even matter because the simple fact is that they Rick, Ridge, Steffy ARE ALL Forresters!!|`|A7m8DFgkaa	Even though Ridge and Rick aren't biological brothers anymore, Rick was still raised as Ridge's brother(and sometimes son, stepson, nephew...).  And Ridge was Eric's son well into his 40's.    It's all just a little too close for comfort for me.  BUT.  Technically Rick and Steffy aren't related.|`|lXwIx74xaa	Ridge is Massimo's son. He's not a forrester.|`|Mp9SaP1iaa	Rick and Ridge are not brothers. Rick is Eric's son and Ridge is Mossimo Maroni son    But with Ridge and Brooke being married  then I guess that would make Rick and Steffy step brother and step sister|`|a1Ngi39Xaa	Stephanie had an affair with Mossimo many years ago and it was discovered that he was actually Ridge's biological father, not Eric.  Ridge was an adult when this came out.    There is still kind of an "ick" factor though, isn't there??     Also the fact that Rick's Mom, Brooke, has been married to Ridge about 7 times now.    Rick dated Phoebe (Steffy's twin) and she was killed in the car he was driving.  Yeah, it was her fault because she wasn't wearing a seat belt and she grabbed the steering wheel and hit the gas pedal, causing the car to run off the road.    Rick was also engaged to Steffy and Phoebe's mother, Taylor, until she broke it off.|`|AA11626328	Ridge Isn't Eric's son.  Ridge Is Nicks half brother, he's a Moroni.  So Rick,  and Steffy aren't related.|`|961a9d14e4a795c97013a6c540d51ba5aa	Technically, Ridge is Massimo Marone's son. Ridge was raised as a Forrester. Even though Rick and Steffy aren't related, the fact that Rick's father is Steffy's grandfather (sorta), is just gross. It seems like there is a short supply of men on this show. There  are way too many gross relationships: Katie & Nick (boring), Eric & Donna (pathetic), and of course Ridge & Brooke (played out ).
379adf8ec6ff418678fc28b78cee178baa	I was thinking the EXACT same thing yesterday and today. What is with that girl?? Its annoying enough that her character is a spoiled valley girl brat and the bad acting just pushes it over the edge! That girl has got to GO! There has got to be better talent out there!    And oh yeah, Sharon looked like she wanted to KILL the officer who interrupted her and nicks make out session! And as for phyllis, the look on her face when nick walked through the door...she knew.|`|YJlCKreSaa	I think Abby is the worst actress ever!    Sharon doesn't make any sense right now.  I hope she gets her head straightened out soon for Noah's sake.|`|RqeoCyzYaa	oh my gosh! did you see how she was crying on nasty ashy today? give me a break send her a.. to boarding school.oh yea i think b&b are calling ashy back,, i Wish. lol!|`|w2pctbRWaa	I cannot stand Abby!!!  She is such a spoiled rich BRAT!  Everything with her is like "totally this, totally that"  I just don't like the character myself.  I do think that she could do a lil better on her acting but it may be just me.|`|m5Hp56Beaa	I agree Abby is such a brat!!!  And they can get rid of Eden too horrible actress!|`|O0b9Kiosaa	I enjoyed the younger Abby, but the new one isn't as bad as Eden.  Nick should have never gone to the cabin in the first place.  What responsible parent leaves their bed ridden child alone w/out either parent by their side.  Yes Phyllis, Jack, and other family and friends are there, but momma or poppa should be there.  The writers rushed to get those two back in the sack.  For NENE:  It was Tracy who convinced Brad to go to the cabin not Phyllis, plus Noah would have died if Brad wasn't there.  RIP Carlton, you were the only one who could have beat down the mustache.|`|f5gT8Apiaa	I totally agree Abby and Eden are the worst criers and actresses and Colleen isn't the best either.  I even e-mailed the network the other night when I found out Don Diamont was axed. As for the girls... loose all of the above and hire people that can turn on the water works when it's written in the script!|`|IxoazyHUaa	Abby and Eden share top honors for bad young actresses, guess nobody pays for acting school anymore.|`|rRFiSOxuaa	I think she overacts, but I don't like how they have turned Abby into a snob so I might be taking that out on the actress playing her.    As for Nick and Sharon, didn't you know that sex is the cure for anything bad that happens?  Ya know when you're afraid or grieving in soap land, a simple hug just won't do it for ya.  lol|`|lXwIx74xaa	Is Abby supposed to be a valley girl or something. She reminds me of Ashley's character.    Go head Sharon get your man back. Screw Phylis. If she had never told Brad where Sharon was, he wouldn't be dead.
hZ9omSataa	sometimes it is difficult for them to make the movies exact, but I do get your point, if you want a movie that is like the book watch the "Of Mice and Men" with Gary Senise, the first time I watched it I was able to recite the entire movie, exactly from the book.  I believe it is because the book was written by Steinbeck, who has a very simplistic way of writing that makes it simple to translate into a movie.|`|sjD26raeaa	My daughter and husband both read all the harry potter books and very quite disappointed that the movie of harry potter and the goblet of fire was cut down too much and so many other people i knew were diasppointed too|`|DZCFD0p2aa	If the movie had all the details of the book, the idiots who don't have the patience to read would not have the patience to watch the movie either - the plot would confuse them.     What's bad is when you hear people going to see the movie and don't realize it's based on a book or even worse is one time I saw someone in a bookstore saying, "Oh look! They have the Lord of the Rings on book form"|`|Ou6adNVsaa	The Harry Potter series into movies always lack a part of the book that I expected to see. Twilight was okay. There are a couple of books that I have read that I could just watch for ever if it was on screen.|`|oYQQJa49aa	Books are often converted into movies because first of all, it makes lots of money, and secondly, many people prefer to go out and pay to see a movie rather then to take the time to see the movie because its less time consuming then reading the book.|`|Klb4ZYcVaa	some books converted into a movie can sometimes be a failure.   But i recently saw "The Reader", omg i cried. I'm very glad that novel was turned into a movie, now look how many Academy Award nominations it received this year.     There are some movies that can be turned into films, & still be a success. But nothing takes away the feeling or excitement of reading a book.
8nGZV6ufaa	Nope can't say as though I have...I use either W-D 40, and have before w/ spray paint.|`|cj7sSPZEaa	No because I never have hairspray, but I have use dishwash.|`|u2wR9XFwaa	I have.. couldn't get it any other way.. it kept flying too fast|`|f9sL3WgQaa	No way. I hate them so I break out the nuclear weapons! Screw that!|`|XPrsJBnvaa	Yes, I have.  But mostly I use window cleaner with ammonia now.  Seems the flies always go towards the windows, so I hit them with the window cleaner and then when I wipe them up, I also clean up the window!  I'm such a multi-tasker!|`|Dj3w4uCDaa	No, with spray varnish. They look all glossy and dead.|`|nAK82h6vaa	lol I sure have,Oven cleaner to.|`|rzZXJz0qaa	no, is it possible? lol|`|NBDLUOkiaa	Yes and I enjoyed it too.|`|223ddd171a5a8fff50d94bbbc612c2a2aa	i use cheap perfume on spiders :)|`|f6YsGOynaa	I thought I was the only one who did that.  It's also fun to light the flume of hairspray as it's coming out of the can and torch wasps.|`|7b27127244ac3ec3fd8e90dd6ba85685aa	yeah that was the only thing i had close by for a nasty spider|`|NSKimt1Qaa	I'll admit, I did one time with hair spray, to kill a pesky fly. It was a free can I got from the stylist. I don't use hairspray on my hair, so I figured nothing else was handy - I'd use that.  It works but it makes the walls sticky. ;-p|`|0Pf6yvhwaa	lol. no, my boyfriends killed a bug with spraypaint before though. . lol|`|AA10971419	lol no i used nail polish|`|4UaUJA3naa	Yes, I would use anything to kill a bug.|`|44a5cd95f48d28d2067593562b142b81aa	Nah, use the shoe.|`|AA12093934	Yup I spray the bug than light it on fire =) otherwise it doesn't work|`|HgRYP3cJaa	I'm sure i did.  I'll use whatever's handy.

Are you thinking about putting yourself forward missus?|`|lReSpTijaa	That's news to me Afro, seems like a good idea, but going by last years housemates VT's you don't always get an honest impression of what these people are really like, or how entertaining they'll actually be once they get in the BB house.|`|aKhZNd7daa	Wow didn't know you could do that Afro - I'd better ask my son if I can borrow his Web Cam and sort out my best lippy lol

ZU2nlPGVaa	Thank you Leo, I am so glad it's not just me. My opinion of Natalie started to slide, when she turned on her family, for the likes of Jarrod,....who was defrauding her family. Never in my wildest imagination would I turn on my family like that,.....I mean, we're not the Ozzie and Harriet family, but their my family and I love them. The other thing that sent me into orbit, while thost two clowns were in the basement,.......they proceeded to have sex. My goodness, I could die at any minute, and Jarrod wants to get laid? To be fair, Clint needs to be blamed too; I would never give a job to someone that was defrauding me and my family. Natlie used to have fire, and a spine,....what the hell happened. Did you see today (2/5)?, Jessica finally went off on spineless Natalie.|`|jHDeIPEfaa	I used to like Natalie until she went psycho. She has no right to try and take Jessica's children. I hope somebody tells her off or worse.  Where does she get this holier than Jessica attitude? She's always been a slut and when she first came to Llanview, she was causing all kinds of trouble. Maybe she and Jared will get married and leave town. He is very nice looking but I can't stand him with Natalie.|`|9e2edc13bc584b5dbeead19cad26ffb1aa	I soooo agree with you but I'd like to know where the heck is Vicki in all this? She needs to put Natalie in her place and kick her but to the curb.. LOL|`|vKvNDPbDaa	lol!  yes i am sick of her too!!  she was so sad when the family was mad at her.  now that they have accepted her she is turning the tables on her sister.  she should be supporting her sister and not trying to steel her kids.|`|Y5jv0ybFaa	She went over board today.... and now I am sick of her too,.|`|NGNeT3rYaa	She does and she doesn't. You can't hardly blame her after what Jessica said but she could cut her some slack but then again, no one ever cut her any when she messes up!|`|d5K8wORqaa	im getting tired of jessica and even tireder of viki n clint making excuses|`|P0Fjh59Eaa	lol no actually i'm sick of Jessica and Vicky. Jess is always going off on these split personalities story lines (YAWN) and Vicky always makes excuses for her....(double YAWN).    Natalie is pissed cause Jessica wanted to kill her and Jared. the chick is nuts, and because of it her baby DIED...uh hello! apparently even though no one knows that Chloe is really Hope, Natalie knows it's a danger to leave the girls w/Jessica right now.    at least Natalie isn't repeating the same crap Jess and Vicky have for YEARS!     the only thing that bugs me about Natalie, is that weird expression she constantly has on her face, she looks like she needs to crap all the time. and the fact that they keep putting her in those wrap dresses with her huge boobs falling out all over the place... i mean does wardrobe have a clue or are they just lazy?

Better question is Have you gotten over it or Will you survive it?|`|U55NCXmUaa	yup - my fertility doctor.  during an egg retrieval, he accidentally nicked an artery feeding the fallopian tube.  unfortunately, this caused abdominal bleeding, so i had to be ambulanced to a hospital to have an emergency laparoscopic surgery to stop the bleeding.  they gave me 4 units of blood and drained 2.4 liters of blood from my stomach.  then it was 5 days in the hospital and 6 weeks of medical leave.    yeah, quite a let down.|`|Y5QrpV62aa	some like that but hay i got over it n move on|`|A4qRLVLhaa	My Recruiter from when I joined the army.

uD1S5dYtaa	Those planets are the farthest from the sun, so it takes them longer to pass through the signs.  Instead of impacting people individually, these planets influence generations.  So if those "heavy" planets are conjunct each other it only means something to all people your age.  If they are aspecting your other planets, then it effects you, depending on the planet and the aspect.

Rock and roll and esp. punk was never about being dignified, and I can't think of anything more punk rock than angry old men with something to say.

DooqYRfAaa	I've read S.E. Hinton's novel "The Outsiders" (I think I read it in high school and we wrote a paper on it).  If this movie starred that karate kid when little, and Tom Cruise, maybe I did see it, not sure.  Maybe it's because I thought the book was better as it sometimes is.

He's the president of the US, there's noting they can do about it.he definitely has more on his hands than simpson's weight. It's really ridiculous and if people actually pay attention to the interview instead of finding a way to bag on the president they will see that he just read the headline and is not implying anything.|`|eI5rgLcraa	i saw the clip and i agree with you\      he isn't poking fun, just reading the mag 'apparantly she is having weight issues'    the media always tries to start trouble
F1DviZEvaa	Ive reaserched on the net,    Michael gave the go ahead for rhiana to sing that song.  Free of charge.  BUT  Rhiana said she would like to pay royalties, Micahel did not reject the idea, BUT when rhiana brought out the song she didnt make alot of money, i think in the end the royalties to Jackson were like 34,043. Which was not enough, so he offered rhiana 12,000 to sing another of his songs (for royalties) the song choices were, They dont care about us. Man in the mirror, and P.Y.T, i think that all of them.    She said No, she would only sing, Billie Jean, Beat it OR Bad.    Of course michael said no, as they are his "known song"  or "signature songs",     And then Michaels 3rd formal Lawyer, decided to sue RHIANA for "Faling to pay FULL royalties" this in the end did not go ahead, as michael stopped him, (well atleast that what i understand) and then an african guy claimed the song to be his etc Michael got royalties and he didnt, etc, really complicating. (like people have done before to no avail)  it took him 25 years to realise it! (i smell a lier)    Just remember that,     Michael jackson, is the greatest man to walk the earth, as a boy and a man, as a muscian and a Dancer, and as a Person.     People have and will ALWAYS try to sue him, or will sue him, What those people are forgetting is, YES they might get $21,000,000 from FALSE allegations, and yes they can claim to be michaels kids mothers.    AND YES he may be different from others, BUT thats why we love him,     Ow, did i mention....(u probally know)    a law will be brought out in 2010 (if michael is sued over a certain amount of times) the law will be that, Michael Jackson is EXEMPT from ALL Sueing and Allegations, etc, from Normal (everyone) exept Authorites, with good enough reason.    Great huh?    "Michael when you cry, we cry with you  when you laugh we laugh with you  when you sing  we listen  when you move  we cherish it  when your BAD  We BEAT IT."|`|qrcZQhK3aa	they're sued?? wow no idea|`|cRhkkBAEaa	Well, of course I'm an MJ fan and I like Rihanna coz she loves MJ but I am not a fan of Rihanna songs and her voice and that.    I think that African guy has come a bit too late really - 26 years later. Really makes you think he's lying.    And why's MJ being sued? I thought he'd got permission?|`|1H7Z3Pivaa	It said he got a settlement from MJ, he is thinking the same with Rihanna.  The thing is , the thing with MJ is over and done with, between them it's all clean, with Rihanna, it's a wait and see how she'll deal with it. The press just brought up the thing with MJ once more, as usual. But it's clear that it is settled.|`|tDbBLZrraa	Sound like love...|`|6sAbs2iiaa	it's publicity my dear that 's all to get attention.|`|AA10964483	i think this is wrong, especially wrong for Michael being sued.|`|HXpOui7gaa	Well i think it is well stupid that they are getting sued!!  I mean, i understand why they are geting sued: Cos michael has been taking allthe royalties off of rihanna for using the line of the song, without giving any to the french guy.  At first i thought he was getting sued for using the lyrics, but my dad said it's because Rihanna was giving the royalties of her song to MJ and MJ wasnt passing any onto the french man.  But to be honest i think it is a load of poop that they are getting sued! I mean cmon, the man sueing them in 75 years old,, his life is almost over, or just about over,, what is he going to do with $600 000 ? Well it is just plain selfish if you ask me!  Love lucy x|`|dLZZ06F2aa	I think that it pretty stupid especially MJ being sued for WBSS which was released in the 80's like 20 yrs ago... really pointless people are always after money
29def525b4de3e4f1e95aaabfaa25f77aa	It's so funny. The person who made this remix is hilarious. My only beef is this: does it get Bale off the hook? I think he's absolutely awful and a bully. What he did to that poor guy was horrible. I like the remix, but it makes Bale's tantrum seem trendy when it was downright tacky.|`|Hc82C7Lyaa	I think that Christian Bale is  class act.|`|6YZ74lEOaa	Ha! That fools got some issues to work out! As I recall he once got arrested a year ago because he was violently abused one of his family members but maybe he's just like that because the one chance he got to be famous was taken from him by Heath Ledger who gave an outstanding performance as the joker in The Dark Knight!|`|21eb1fee7277ed0dfc6c417c0a528dddaa	I'm not into techno music, but I did like the song.    Bale just shows what an *** he is. I also wonder what Bryce Dallas Howard was thinking while he was yelling like that. Poor thing was right there while he did this crap. The guy stepped in to check the lighting that is it. Wasn't like he started to move furniture. The director of T4 is also a wimp. He should have stepped in right away instead of letting it go on like that. There is absolutely no excuse for the way Bale acted.|`|4IDgCFWdaa	Cool vid. The "rant" was also hilarious. And btw, what moron walks onto the set while filming? Especially if its a difficult scene. That guy deserved to be yelled at. What if it were like the scene where Jack Nicholson yells out, "you can't handle the truth", but then some shmuck walks in front of the camera and ruins the scene? Anyway, that dude needs to pay attention or find another job.

XstaAKLLaa	good question! :-)     I think it's because when we gossip, we are indirectly escaping our problems.     If for example, I gossip with my friend about another friend's problems, then it's because I have plenty of problems of my own but I feel better discussing others so that I wouldn't feel so bad about my own issues..it's like a kind of escapism from my own problems by focusing/gossiping about other people's problems...    needless to say, gossip is a very negative thing...bcos it might lead to some serious consequences.|`|I13rHn1Waa	cozzzz it makes us express from the inner of heart....|`|Fo9ADQLBaa	For one thing, what comes forth from the mouth, defiles the person.

Of course not... stop accusing me!!!!  1)   Indebt people to me by helping them, so that i will have their support later on.    2)   Appear to be smart (i.e. pretend to know all the answers when in fact I have simply bribed various persons for the correct answers) so that people will think I will make a good leader.    3)   Make many contacts that I can use to gain power by participating in various clubs and stuff.    4)   Never let people know that I'm an evil genius. Muhahaha.  (Oops... I'm not an evil genius of course not, I was just kidding, how could someone as nice as me (see number 1) be an evil genius)    5)   Obtain a foolish but catchy nickname and dance so that people recognize my name and think that I am harmless.    6)  Create a foolish website that hypnotizes anyone that visits and causes them to obey me.    7) Find a way to remember people's names    8)   Secretly obtain blackmail against anyone that could foil my plans, ie YOU.    9)   Argue with potential opponents, learn their opinions, weaknesses and obtain more blackmail.    10)   Exploit the billions of security holes in Microsoft products to spy on people's computers and obtain even more blackmail (yeah, its that important) and learn what to use to bribe people.    11) Create viruses that destroy windows and then shoot Bill Gates and be hailed as a hero.    12)   Make billions of dollars from gambling, thieving and other underhanded methods, and then use that money to get elected president.    13)   Accuse a bird of trying to take over the world and then overthrow the bird and take the world for myself.|`|e41vo46Oaa	dont do it
B6CKyzngaa	I'd personally "LOVE" to leave this woman alone to tend to her own BUT................the fact is that the taxpayers will support this family of 14 and then we wonder why our local, State and Federal Governements are going broke........................because here in the states we take care of EVERYBODY!!!!! ..........even those who are most aggressive and dangerous we lock up for life and take care of them too.  It's never ending and all we ever really do is send the message that nobody really has to be responsible for themselves or what happens to them, the general public will suck it up and heft them on our backs and the backs of our children.|`|ee61e5c9182f80497740aeecc845e0edaa	She's crazy.

RcCJSSMPaa	MA: OK my friend...after a mad search online I found this that I think applies to your question...I heard this guy Chris Duarte in an interview and I LOST MY MIND, I was a fan for good after this. If it weren't for this radio show I don't think I would have ever heard him.  I am not sure if this was the interview that I heard, but he was a guest on this show a few times.  This was the closest I could get to the original interview, if this wasn't it.  SOOOO, this is it, Chris Duarte Group:    http://www.megablues.com/sounds/ChrisDua...    Hope it works!    If it doesn't, here's Chris from You Tube:    http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JKlMlWaFv...    Whew, this was a lot of work! LOL  Good question!        MA2:  The show was good!|`|fcf94fd558c72875735d4fe3f1389736aa	MA: I absolutely love Modest Mouse and this is great show of their early stuff off their first two albums and a performance of "Dark Center of the Universe" which wasn't released on an album until 3 years later. it. amazing. http://modestmouselive.zeromethos.com/sh...    MA2: I finally got a chance to listen to this and I am so glad that I did. Their music is so smooth and so interesting. And while listening to this, I realized that I pick up this radio station from my house here in good ole Gastonia, NC. awesome.The one time that I remember listening to it before, they were doing a session with the Decemberists which I thought was pretty big for a smaller college station. but the music was great.|`|kyEKb3cwaa	You never disappoint me with these. I'm waiting for the day that you provide a show that I'm not that in to lol. I've at least sorta liked all of the shows you've posted so far. This is no exception.    MA: I really really dig that afroskull band you posted the first time you did this.    MA2: It was pretty good. I loved the instruments, different from your every day band and it was refreshing. I especially loved number 4. Kinda even had a reggae feel to it.    - Love and Peace -
I6dcRgD6aa	I know they will not keep whiny boy only the strong minded survive. I think many of the good ones haven't even been shown on camera yet so they just push Castro somewhere & I guess we will see him later. Someone said the Osmond son was kicked off but they didn't know why. I didn't even notice.The black girl who was in whinyboys group was so angry but she thought she was a diva so she kindof had it coming to her but I wonder what others thing cause she did work all night while the other 2 or 3 were crying.|`|CPxmHjx4aa	Castros brother didnt make it..i was told  i was glad when "Bikini Girl" got the boot (she had guts to show up like that in the first place)..

I only pick up people that I am sure I could take down, or wouldn't mind driving into a pole with.

It is good but bad..|`|1PdUecpYaa	gemini/ sagittarius... that's hot. both of them are so much fun to be with...  least favourite is probably cancer/capricorn... boring....|`|QTiTDz4yaa	Sneezy/Grumpy  Dopey/Happy    Both these combinations are horrible to be around.|`|Oc8Dg4gvaa	Taurus/Capricorn  Gemini/Sagittarius  Cancer/Virgo  Leo/Aquarius  Virgo/cancer|`|AA12215623	Least favorite.

DON'T TAKE THE PHOTO. The idiotic actions Miley Cyrus does is bad for her career. She has multiple photos out into the public that people do find offensive, and she couldn't even think twice on the "Slanted Eyes" photo? Her career, is her screw up. Just let it be, I and most people are getting sick of her apologies.|`|B3N388wBaa	People take offense to that. Especially if a celebrity does it. The same thing happened when Mel Gibson said crap about the Jews. Drunk or not, he shouldn't of said that. And with her, she shouldn't of done that. Either way, her career is going down the drain|`|6sAbs2iiaa	She's a spoiled little whore|`|qM9tSVd8aa	That was rude and she is no role model|`|ShIBKelQaa	well, im as old as miley and i know that me and my friends fake faces all the time when we take pixs. and like there is the asian kid i hang out with and we always try to look asin when we take pixs with him|`|ByWBKf6daa	She was with her friends, among whom there was an Asian guy and they were having fun. Honestly, I think she is immature and didn't really mean to mock Asians. Perhaps they were doing it because they were posing with an Asian guy.|`|TfmvWPLLaa	its absoutely ridiculous and ppl need to find better things to worry about. its pathetic that those pics are newsworthy.|`|qFOdHHCDaa	Miley Cyrus is sad|`|tG7n4S14aa	evidently she is once again showing off her lovely immaturity!

Think about the artist that you really like, you effectively stealing from them, they will not get credit for you downloading illegally and they will not get the money that is rightfully theirs.    It is theft, its just the same as going in to a music store and stealing an album.|`|qThmcR1Aaa	Why don't you just pay the artists for their work?

OrjPe9Kyaa	I really love Japanese music, here are my recommendations.    Well, when people think of J-Pop, they sometimes tend to think of this popular music agency called "Johnny's Entertainment". At least.. I do, lol. Ehm, so they produce a lot of popular boy bands.   Here are some of them:  - Arashi (My favourite :D)  - KAT-TUN   - NEWS  - V6  - Kanjani 8  - Hey! Say! JUMP  - Kinki Kids  - Tackey & Tsubasa  - TOKIO  - SMAP  etc.  :3    Here are some other j-pop artists/bands I enjoy  - Utada Hikaru  - BoA (she sings both korean AND japanese i think. )  - Ayumi Hamasaki  - Mr. Children  - Remioromen  - w-inds.  - Do As Infinity  - EXILE  - WaT  - Nakashima Mika  - YUI  - Olivia Lufkin  - Anna Tsuchiya    Enjoy~ (:|`|e9Q51Oxyaa	Excuse your innocence ...

So, who gets me energized the most? Being with a Leo, Aries, and an Aquarius. Aries always is up for an adventure. Leos are just fun period. And how can you be bored around anyone ruled by the house of friends?     As far as earth and water goes:  Virgos, Scorpios, and Capricorns can be pretty fun. Many Caps I know like to socialize and are party goers. A lot of Virgos have a hard time sitting still and you're always in for a wild time around a Scorpio!

wA8Dyhq7aa	Stay where you are and develop a following.  NEVER send an unsolicited tape/CD, it'll be returned unopened to you.    You should also read about the music industry and decide if you REALLY want to be part of that racket.|`|rRCTvT7Saa	Well, first, I would develop my scales as best as I could before moving to Nashville.  Then, after you feel that you can't get any better at what you do where you live, move to Nashville.    Why am I saying that?  Well, in the March 2009 issue of Guitar Player Magazine, Brad Paisley suggests that people who plan on moving to Nashville to pursue a career in music should do that.  And, I know--that is geared towards guitarists, but it seems like it's a good idea for anyone who plans on moving to Nashville.    If you honestly feel that you're good enough, I'd say move to Nashville as soon as you can.  But keep in mind that having a demo is always a great thing to do...just make sure you get all of your songs copyrighted before you share them with anyone!|`|qsuYKa3naa	Check out the Nashville Star for this upcoming event in March    http://74.125.95.132/search?q=cache:j28N...|`|vMT3wWB9aa	OK LIsten carefully!!! I have been there twice and know exactly what will happen. Going to Nashville is a delicate matter. You HAVE to have a job waiting for you when you get there. Otherwise you are on the street and there is no help for homeless wanting to get on their feet. I know, I was there in the shelter a couple weeks ago. And since you are 14, a job is out of the question at the moment. So, you are in a perfect possition to do something great. You need to get a band together. That is the best thing to do. It gets you used to playing music with others and not to a cd. It also gives you a great way to learn stage presents. That is very important to learn.     Another thing you can do is to make some money and find a local studio to record a demo. Then make LOTS of copies and send them to recording companies in Nashville.|`|WIFKeDBgaa	Well, if the last 15 years was the basis for a decision, I'd say: Don't worry about being able to sing or write. Just wear tight clothes (as little as possible) and hire a professional studio vocalist to sing your part from the darkest corner of the stage. Put your microphone volume on about 1, an just back away from it on notes you can't hit. Anymore, it's the video that matters...not the song or the singer. Stay as far from country music as possible....Nashville won't play country. Whenever in public...thank god (loud enough for everyone to hear) and slip as many quotes from "Dukes of Hazzard" as possible.    That should cover it.

I think I have it already, but its difficult to say cuz the sound quality aint the best on the video. Good luck!   Hey, if you do get it figured out, e-mail me! I wanna know it too! =D

GyuSshPhaa	It all depends what you wanna play like most rock bands and metal bands would use power chords 90% of the time, normal chords don't sound good on an electric guitar with a lot of gain/distortion.|`|WJjfrf0Caa	it depends on the song you are playing, but you can use any type of chord on any guitar.|`|TsFG4zLmaa	my son can answer that, but he is at school for 1 more hour  ill get back to ya on that|`|36ukxyZPaa	YOu can use either.    Metal songs tend to rely on Power Chords,  Other songs generally use normal chords.|`|1aUfx70Laa	The electric guitar can be used for either but playing power chords on the electric guitar give a better sound than playing them on an acoustic so generally yeh power chords are played on the elctric ;) xx|`|0rF1be2baa	in most rock song i'd have to say power chords|`|vfXOWjXxaa	ppl use both, it jus depends on the song|`|CaoVS1cdaa	Mostly power chords combined with a distorition pedal you get a really great sound.|`|PIeESmAcaa	It completely depends on what you want to play... I use normal chords a lot but i also use power chords,   Its all up to you =]|`|SVqR4Nebaa	depends on what you are playing. and the style of music, i play mostly bar and open chords when playing electric, unless you are going to play some ACDC or Black Sabbath,,,,it just really depends on the song your playing.. it takes some practice to be able to make it sound right|`|ZUq54bhsaa	You can use either but if you're playing a heavier/metal song then go for power chords to get the desired effect. But both are fine for electric guitar =]

Fsr2Rofzaa	no I am not a fan, and I'd guess NO!  Those shows are are fake as hell.  I do want to say though that those two girls do not have an ounce of class or respect.  I have seen a a few episodes and I found it extremely disrespectful of those two dressed like complete tramps to go meet the parents.  Seriously, I understand it's a show, but even the biggest two-bit whore would never go meet their b/f's conservative parents dresses like that.  My husbands parents would have told me to put some f'ing clothes on if I want to come in their house, or freaking get back in my car and go home..  If I was trevor, I'd be ashamed and embarrassed.|`|qsg8wCBiaa	i'm a definite fan!   i'm pretty sure they are :] well, he did say that he bought a house in cali to be closer to vikki. i hope they stick together because they make a really cute couple & i'm sick of seeing the shows that they find love and don't end up being together at the reunion!|`|CpY8CTwtaa	i love that show!!!! but i don't know who won though??|`|12Nou1pvaa	yea they were seen getting an STD test together

2UDbOpxTaa	Firstly it depends what kind of kit you're after. I don't know a lot about jazz or fusion kits, so the below answers refer to rock kits (the most common kind)    If you can afford it get an Orange County kit, they're incredible, they're the ones Travis Barker uses, although I don't know if you'd be able to get much of that for under 1500.    The Mapex Orion series kits cost about 1200-1300, and are 4-piece and slightly off-standard sized drums, but they look sweet. Here's an example:    http://www.wembleydrumcentre.com/?fuseac...    Tama also have a great reputation. A superstar or starclassic kit would set you back about 900.    Pearl Exports are a nice standard kit, about 450-500 new, although there's probably tons of second-hand ones about. The Pearl Vision series is a little further upmarket, (about 500-800 new, depending on specific model).    I would stay away from Ludwig kits. They have hefty price tags and Ringo Star used to play them, so people assume they're pretty high quality, and they used to be when they were hand-made in the US back in the day, but these days they're not that great, just living off an old reputation.|`|gYThMID8aa	D.W. are the best in the world ( American, meaning Drum Workshop )  but are also the most expensive, even as second hand.  Other good makes are Pearl, Tama, Mapex and Premier.  You can get an idea of prices from e-bay;    http://musical-instruments.shop.ebay.co....|`|TwlXQhLaaa	Yamaha
ETIHOWt9aa	Best show ever    I think sun is trying to kill Ben, but now we know that Jin is not dead so...    gotta wait till next week.|`|SWxcuGlOaa	i don't know, but hey you're a stupid cow|`|c7c42fcd2fd4b62ba49207bebbdb931daa	Oh, man, I'm on the fence with this season so far.  It's getting a little tiring, all this going back and forth.  But at the same time, I'm liking some of the stuff we're finding out - Rousseau arriving on the island, and will we find out if/why/how she killed her group, Penny's father having been on the island, etc.  And Jin - how the heck did he survive the explosion????  I'm thinking that Sun is out to kill Ben, but I'm sure it won't happen...  So, I'm taking it week by week, whether I'll be watching it again, lol....probably will, though....would hate to have put all this time in just to quit now!  : )|`|cE9QIMNiaa	i'm not entirely certain... i'm way confused as to whats going on at this point.  all we found out is that "mr. whidmore" is one of the others and was on the island previously, which would explain why he's been trying so hard to find it again!  thats about all i know at this point.|`|DUg1IkTIaa	The episode last night was good.  I'm glad to see the story line about the return of the Oceanic Six again.    I think SUN isn't sure what to do.  She seemed to be on Widmore's side, so she may attempt to kill Ben.  I'm not sure she realizes it was Widmore's freighter where Jin was possibly killed. Widmore wanted the survivors dead.|`|HUy7ugDUaa	Not sure. every time i think i know what is going on, the plot has a twist. I love it. This show is GREAT!!!|`|667fbb3f5754a94cb0e93724d53755a5aa	Not sure why she has the gun, but I wouldn't mess with her.|`|34ruM1eDaa	She wants to kill BEN coz she thinks its Ben's fault that her husband, Jin, died. So she wants revenge!    Lost rocks, doesnt it? :D|`|e4e6e071fbaff222f423d536811dc00eaa	So far I have really liked every episode this seasons IM SOOOOO HAPPY ABOUT JIN !! .... As for Sun she is obviously going to try and kill Ben if you remember she told Whitmore that she wanted Ben dead and in the package she recieved there was a picture of Ben and gun so lets just keep are fingers crossed and hope she misses when she tries to shoot him

I heard it was good..      in America we have "frog legs" which is literally frog legs. We also have a cake called "better than sex", which is clearly, absurd in itself.|`|XAAF7R23aa	nothing better than steak and kidney pudding with chips and peas, yorkshire pudding is nice with sugar or syrup actually, that is how my gran used to serve it as a desert. Black pudding, my husband loves it boiled i can eat it fried, but not boiled.

yJd1WwF2aa	I don't really care b/c I knew she wasn't going to get passed Hollywood so it's not like a surprise or anything but I am MAD that she got Rose kick out,. I really liked Rose and b/c of bikini girls she out. :(|`|dmxnblomaa	Sooooooooooooooooooo Glad, she thought her looks would get her by.|`|fk9AvB25aa	So glad to see her go. The only thing I'm jealous of her is her body. I was surprised that she had a voice. But her attitude drove me crazy, it's not all about her. The way she treated her group was childish at best. I only felt sorry for her for about a second when she was crying in her room. She made a fool out of her self when posing on her way out and made her group look terrible. In the end group was trying to comfort her vice versa and she didn't want to do that because she look fake. Doing that is more fake looking then accepting a group hug.|`|ojEkgJoqaa	so glad only interested in herself. and what she did to her group how rude and immature. what about simon's reaction to when she left.     and she messed it up for one other good person in the group    so self absorbed and thought she was god's gift to the world.    what was her purpose?    the only reason she got the trip to hollywood because of her looks by simon mostly  did you see her auditon and simon couldn't keep his eyes off of her when she walked in    thank god she is gone    imagine if she tries out again next year. god bless us all    sorry jcam but with her you never know. i seriously dont think she will|`|gp7qmHsMaa	I am so happy she's gone. She made an embarrassment of herself and the show. She thought the show was some kind of beauty pageant. IT IS A SINGING COMPETITION FOR GOD'S SAKE!!!      I agree with Star Shooter. Thanks to the drama she produced for the group, Rose did poorly with the performance and thus was sent packing.    Yes I too think Danny Gokey has a great chance at making it into the Top 12. IMO he already is one of the front-runners of the competition. I also like Anoop Desai.    Oh god pink. If she auditions for next year she might be crazy enough to do it naked. Gosh, why did you have to make my poor innocent mind think about that?|`|uGFzzLYWaa	I was glad she went. I was tired of looking at her and she was wasting air time that could have gone to more worthy singers.   I agree, I really like Danny, and yes, he reminds me of RDjr, too, only geekier. Anoop is awesome, too. he reminds me of a young Jon Secada, voice-wise.  I can't believe they let that "Norman Gentle" through and cut David Osmond. Sure, the whole shtick is funny, but that isnt what it's about.  I liked David O.|`|LU7WB6Poaa	YES!!!!!!! I'm so glad she's gone!!!!! She was soooooo rude!!!!|`|679I210Yaa	She over-did the songs ..  by fluxuating her voice too much. Oh and people only remember her as the 'bikini girl'... nothing more.|`|AA12223250	Could not agree with you more!!! And I love Danny and I told my husband Tuesday night when we were watching that he reminded me of a younger Robert Downey Jr!! How funny that you think that too!  I like David too, sorry he went but I really want Danny to go all the way!|`|r1y8ZSmoaa	haha i liked her|`|6YZ74lEOaa	OMG so am I but not because I'm jealous of her either. Boy if she was going to act like that then it is a good thing that she got kicked of the show! I knew she was conceited from the minute I laid eyes on her! I bet Paula and Cara were more than happy to finally get rid of her! LOL!|`|uUHMg5Szaa	I am so glad she is gone, she was such a snob, and way to conceited, I mean yes she was pretty on the outside but the way she acted made her butt ugly in my opinion, I am pissed cuz her selfishness got the other 2 girls kicked off who probably would have been fine if Katrina wasn't in their group.    I also liked Danny, he has a good voice    (=

32P3hG0Laa	This is not legal in the United States. You are not allowed to discriminate due to race, color or creed, and astrology is a belief system, ergo it is a creed.    Personally, I did not use astrology when I had to hire people for my department. I didn't even ask them their birth dates, but I am a Capricorn and I ended up hiring a Virgo and two Capricorns. So...|`|tuULGJS6aa	That makes no sense whatsoever.|`|gUUtGcbBaa	yea thats descrimination !|`|9ce71ec2e47cf221d521f594f76a23a0aa	No,that's discrimintory.    Plus,not everyone is just the characteristics of their sun sign,that's only the tip of the iceberg...so it'd be really naive to hire someone because their a Capricorn and supposedly hard-working and rational to find that they aren't meerly that what so ever.|`|pmXGhePDaa	i think that is stupid and in a way racist :D|`|8gEMrNSBaa	Funny  and  If i did not like the way my boss behaves, then id just seek another job; in reality they don't harass, humiliate or otherwise beat up people based on the sun sign, they just select employees of 4 sun signs.    Considering that astrology is built around beliefs, i don't expect the majority of Autralian banks to end up hiring only leos and tauruses with relevant data to back up their point of view :).|`|E2VUH8Q0aa	Geez. Well it's a bit extreme, but it's not "racist" (as someone just mentioned) because the zodiac signs are not "races"...    Technically it's not illegal (because it's never been challenged, and the legal definition of "astrology" as a belief system might stand to challeng, only because date of birth is not one of the current"protected" areas of law : race, age, sex, nationality, disability, or religion (1). If taken to court there may be some possible credence to going after the "age" angle, but only a little. (of course, this is the US law, not the Austrian law, which varies only slightly (2)    As for morally, the people doing this are rather short sighted, since other aspects in a person's chart can better determine fiscal responsibility and the ability to conform within the corporate structure. A person with the 8th or 2nd in Scorpio or Taurus might do just fine in that environment, for example.    My personal thoughts are purely practical. The employers here are missing out on a significant pool of talent by leaving out other Suns, and are setting a slightly frightening precedent by implementing such as hiring strategy.      **I wonder if psychics hold grudges. oops. guess so. So much for being a christian.**|`|xpiGWrdMaa	My sign is represented, yes!  Nah, j/k.      I heard japan hires (or used to) by blood type.

How the hell is that racism?    Personally, I find it interesting.  I've always wanted to know how it would be to have people of a certain sign working in different parts of a company.  I mean, there's no law against discriminating because of someones astrological sign.|`|PCAlAoDsaa	No I would never hire some one to work for me based on their astrological sign because it is discrimination.  I would only hire some one to work for me based on their character, references and work experiences.|`|B7WIZdglaa	that's just horrible! I mean, honestly.. if I was a manager who was hiring someone, and they were aquarius like me- and I LIKED them.. that might put them at a slight advantage. But I would never NOT hire someone that showed potential just because of their zodiac sign!|`|KfkmB4X2aa	Well that's discriminatory.|`|CrjozlCjaa	I would hire someone to work for me based on their character, references and work experience.|`|e14b1125c91fafed4795c69469f8b509aa	How is that even legal? That's ridiculous seeing that not all Leos, Capricorns, and Taureans will work and act the same. I can't believe they're able to get away with that kind of thing. Personally, no I wouldn't hire someone based on their sign. I wouldn't even look at their birthday on the applications anyways. If they happened to mention their sign to me and it's one that I get along with I would be a little happy about it but it wouldn't sway my decision. I can't believe there are actually companies out there that hire based on astrological signs. That's crazy!

She acts like SHE was the one judging since the beggining season 1 and shes so wise and great. But Newsflash for her, she's the new judge and Paula, Simon, and Randy are much more wise and better than you.    She' so wierd. I wish they would make her get off the show!    Oh, and what do you think about the Bikini girl they let go into Hollywood? Jwing, lol|`|ja0qW30Maa	Idk I kinda don't mind her. I mean I've never heard of her before, but I think she is ok. She is kinda vain though.|`|sr6kiokFaa	agrreed w/ you! i dont like herr its soo different!|`|4bWUiIVdaa	Omg! I completely agree with what you said! She's a dumbASS! Who's stupid idea was it to bring her on? I hope they kick her off next season!

AA11516222	In Apacolypto they are marching the prisoners single file back to the paramids and as they get close to the big city, someone cuts down this huge tree and it falls and almost hits the raid leader.  He turns to the people chopping down trees and says something in his language.  The subtitled translation was, "hey, I'm walking here!" Just like DeNiro said in Taxi Driver.|`|8HnLYjK4aa	the F word.|`|BAQf7prLaa	Pretty much all of A Knight's Tale with Heath Ledger is anachronistic. The introductions at the jousts in the style of modern day boxing matches is hilarious, and the modern music (We Will Rock You) fits, oddly enough.|`|0b1a38ddb028d9a6c669ad7b4e4f3db8aa	John Wayne, dressed as a Roman Centurion, standing on a rock in 'The Greatest Story Ever Told' (I think...Cecil B) and he says (in a really thick American Accent) 'Shirley...he was the son of God'....    it was shocking...

rRFiSOxuaa	Air time is very expensive, but it depends on what time and channel the ad is on.  Higher ratings mean higher price for air time.    I think 30 seconds during the Superbowl (American Football), cost $3 million this year, but that 30 seconds is going to cost quite a bit less if the ad runs at 3am during an unpopular show.|`|hE7fK4W0aa	Depends on the product and at what time it is aired , prime time is obviously more expensive ...|`|bd55bbe169d91db5d80a19a3cfb1c094aa	I appeared in a certain bread advert filmed in LIverpool and it was rumoured that including paying for airtime for the ad it was around 15.000.000.
Hiasgb75aa	Is this even a question?    Anyways, Pokemon was made in Japan not China|`|hITUqOuhaa	whoever told you that...lied, I'm sorry|`|pTERJdzQaa	Yes you are absolutly right, Pokemon originated in China but then was later spread to Japan and Korea. Then it was released in other places like the U.S.    I know, I was dumbfounded when I first found out that pokemon wasn't Japanese.|`|RuV0pdPYaa	so who told you this? What is this statement based on? Nintendo is a Japanese based company and the game designer was born in Tokyo! So how exactly is it a chinese game? Please explain this wild assumption.
EX6Wds4haa	the answer is  Pacific North west trust    on your cell look at the number shown first (i.e. 7) and click it once. then you get your first letter which should be P.    Get it?    If you look on the Stephenie site *newmoon*  its the money Edward sends Bella while he's away from her. He calls it the Pacific northwest trust.|`|pjbdDi2Oaa	pacific northwest trust    I used the numbers on a cell phone for example go to the number 7 and count one letter (p) now go to the number 2 on a phone and the first letter of that is an a, then number 2 and the third letter is a C etc. I just figured it out i have no idea what the heck you are talking about riddles though.    T9 is when you text on a phone and you hit the numbers but it spells the words for you.|`|w52W5Ch3aa	i think you might be a little too obsessed with twilight. a book you might like is called Blue Bloods.  its a good series.  it has vampires in it :]|`|TZiySTOGaa	right i have just done those numbers on my kep pad on my mobile phone and it comes up with this       pacific nothwest trust try that    EDIT: someone beat me to it lol :(|`|zyfAhhd2aa	pacificnorthwesttrust|`|Va6EInYmaa	Blue Bloods is good. Are there only 3 books?

That, too.|`|3N2ElzcQaa	Ask this question in the Movies category.    This question has nothing to do with Comics & Animation.|`|KyOP56Xsaa	TT.TT   why? oh why?!....    y'know if you've posted this to the right section, i could have bothered to give you the answer.      +_+|`|DEacde81aa	I'm pretty sure he is allowed a haircut.  He is human, after all.|`|wU0c3i7baa	This is why I am angry at Robert. It's not that he looks bad, but his hair HAS to be the same for New Moon. It can't look different because vampire hair does not change or grow. Therefore, if they gave him shorter hair in New Moon under the pretense that he cut it, it would have to be that short in Eclipse and Breaking Dawn.    I'm hoping it grows out enough by March. If not, they better give him extensions. If I don't see that 1950's greaser, dollop of whipped cream bouffant in the movie I will cry my little 20 year old fangirl eyes out.    Why couldn't he have gotten a trim rather than a buzzcut? I wouldn't have cared if it didn't jeopardize his look for the film.|`|eBHQBeF7aa	Even though, he looks better with longer hair.  Vamps don't have to have a licence to get their hair cut.probably|`|bec16h7Taa	Vampires are allowed to get haircuts. Wizards do in Harry Potter. Lawl. And if it really needs to be longer, I'm sure they can just use extensions or something. Relax.|`|pDwdUN8Aaa	hey it doesn't really matter  he can grow it back and what  are you freakin out about god  do you have a problem    STALKER|`|De6n2MaIaa	you can't say that, cerysss.  don't you know all the little twelve year olds think he's a real vampire?|`|K2dxDdyqaa	It's getting shot in March  and they'll probably film the other scenes and wait til it's grown abit, otherwise he'll probably get short extensions or something|`|va4dh98baa	He will probably get a wig or they may just wait until his hard grows out a little bit longer.  They could also make him take lots of vitamins because it makes your hair grow faster.|`|X11j9qe5aa	This is why I don't want to be famous. People keep making thing such a big deal over other people.  Edit:  I'm not trying to be mean or anything just saying.|`|z81JIycpaa	What does it matter? Extensions are a girl's best friend. (Bad pun intended.)    Besides, he is not even there for about 3/4 of the movie. I'm sure that Summit are not worried and the reasons he cut his hair was because:    1) It was good to get it cut now, because you won't see him around a lot on the screen anyway.  2) He didn't want all the rabid Twilight fangirls' to recognizee him.    xxx GG|`|v1hCymAEaa	You will get more answer if you go to the movies category, C&A is more than likely not where you want to be.    :-P|`|VmPkgVPXaa	Well it is true. Humans do get haircuts. But New moon being the sequeal and all it really ruins the movie because Edward is supposably the perfect guy. and in my opinion a guy's hair is important to females. So i hope they will at least use extentions because his hair is too short for Edward Cullen.|`|4De97gB6aa	theyll probably jsut style is hair to match twilight as best they can. They got the best stylists in the world on him imsure they'll pull it off.. plus if he cut in dec... thats 3 months ago now.. surely most of it is back :D.  ... idea of a wig is pretty funny tho lol
XLAxyOEDaa	shes immature  shes spoiled little brat  and shes a slut|`|KcHhLsCAaa	Bad career move.   But she is hot, thats for sure.|`|TfmvWPLLaa	ppl are so dumb if theyre judging by her pics. a slut is a girl who sleeps around. she's most likely a virgin and if not, we don't know about it so can't judge whether she's a slut or not. if she's not known to be promiscuous (much less if shes a virgin) how can anybody label her a slut. besides the pics weren't that bad. google any female celebrity and u can probably find a lot worse.|`|ecmnS63Uaa	of course she is didn't you see her boy friend he is an underwear model and he is 20. so yeah.|`|1eUS84GBaa	she is a good actor but she has taken some photos which are really embarrassing  like the photo almost naked in a bathroom|`|BtxmstTeaa	SHE IS THE BIGGEST SLUT IN THE ENTIRE WORLD>.....i hate miley cyrus soo much..i hope she falls off  a cliff and dies...|`|UNryBT1naa	UM DUH!|`|RxWjhFCtaa	She is cool, but i sometimes do think she can be pretty slutty at times; like the pictures she takes.... not the one form the magazine thing with her dad (which looks like a couple should be going not dad and daughter) lol but the ones in the bathroom. She is like wearing a shirt and underwear and their is one wear she is wearing like a white tank top with a rally bright bra and she pulled down her shirt really low to show the bra..   kk so i thing miley should act a little more her age because she has the rest of her life to be old and nobody can't get any younger; she should just enjoy life being a teenager but not to be too immature   miley cyrus is still awesome though =]|`|t15ch7Gqaa	Hey you, be careful don't ever say that about her   she is nice cute beautiful and she is not slut because these pictures are fabricated by bad people and if u have sources that she made it by herself we don't care because we all make mistakes so don't look at one mistake of her but look at ur mistakes and try to see her good to forget her bad things like me I never look at a person from his bad things but from his good things.  Please don't be mad of me ok I'm sorry but this is my answer and my opinion and I'm not going to change it.|`|9KWVgb9naa	what can you expect when she says her fave tv show is "sex & the city "?|`|qOKFuXfLaa	she's not becoming a slutt ... she is ALREADY a slutt|`|B3N388wBaa	DUH!

They will focus on a certain singer before the audition, and they did that a lot, here's David Osmond, here's Castro's brother , meet Lil, check out Anoop and Jazmin. Here's blind guy. (forgot his name, but I liked him. Did he make it?) But since none of them wore bikinis, we didn't really get to hear them sing much, and all we got were drama hissy fits from crappy singers, mediocre singing, and commericals.

0Ui4NGcKaa	yea lil bit cuz she kind of a shy and reserved kind of person and plus she doesnt know anyone in that town besides dat indian dude and her dad but she hasnt seen him i nlike 15 yrs or so but yea she smiles a  little bit especially wen she meets that guy or vampire.like wen they were dancing at the party she did and wen he showed her he canf ly off trees!hope i helped ya!|`|d334491b0919df3ba6915bd08a255b70aa	Sure she did!  She was with "Edward Cullen"! Who wouldn't smile with him???! haha  No but I do agree, she was a bit depressing throughout the movie (but she did smile several times! for instance, she smiled at the baseball field and when they were dancing!), but she did play Bella really well and I loved the movie!|`|A2gdubZaaa	Yeah, when she got her truck, when edward asked her about the weather, when she was trying to convince jacob to tell her the story about the cold ones, when she said "could you act human?" right before edward said he wanted to take her to his place the next day, when they were dancing in his room, when her dad was trying to talk to her about boys, when she was talking to her mom on the phone and she said she liked forks, right before the prom when she talked with jacob:)|`|K6XZ18uHaa	like a half smile when she first saw edward in science class, then when he finally talks to her but there are not many shots of her smiling.  forget the movie!  the book pones :D|`|5iMja1Meaa	Yes...    dancing with edward in his room...  at prom...  getting out of his car at school...  in the trees...    theyre just off the top of my head (:|`|BCu8rER4aa	yes,she did,..but think it wasnt that obvious,..  like when she was talking w/ her mom,then suddenly edward appear  then when she was riding w/ edward in th trees  during the prom  when she was introduced to the cullens|`|rvBZPIv4aa	Just a little bit, but hardly|`|wU0c3i7baa	Not really, but I did see her blink, convulse and shake her head a lot.     She's a little more happy-go-lucky in the book.|`|rISPXbiLaa	yes...|`|D27mJKmWaa	Yeah... when she was dancing with Edward in his room :)    Also.. when when he was running up the tree with her.    There just off the top off my head! I'm sure she smiled loads.|`|zetxxZWUaa	As much as i love Kristen she could have done better playing Bella. I'm a huge fan of the twilight books and the movie sucked big time. I don't care if your a little girl and your only seeing the movie because of Edward the facts are facts, it was horrible. They missed a lot of the little yet important details and scenes, they mixed up some of the scenes and the guy that plaed Jacob irritated the hell out of me.    People need to stop obsessing over Twilight in general anyway. Everyone keeps on saying it's original and the first of it's kind when it isn't. It's a romantic vampire story.....hello people....the first vampire love story ever written was Dracula.|`|YbwDFvEaaa	Sort of...well, she seemed to grimace more than smile, as if it pained her to even try.    If I had to play such a character, I might have a hard time smiling, too.    Glittery vampires...|`|qhInNXStaa	like once or twice...|`|0adde2725ea90445eb116c6f500bdd2daa	WHO?

I'm a fan for sure.  I don't think a band is overrated just because they are getting more well known...the music is still really good and they are really nice guys.
CsWwecBLaa	Okay, i'll tell you about it  Only if you promise to give me best answer ;]    Okay, so the blues is amazing.  It started in New Orleans by black slaves in i'd say the late 19th century.  Famous blues musicians are Louis Armstrong   and robert johnson, otis redding.  but now as the blues has evolved, a lot more white people are also blues musicians. An important insturment in blues music is the harmonica, and saxiphone although that tends to be more jazzy than bluesy.  It was called the blues, because the musicians usually sang about sad things (their blues)  I don't really know about the chords etc but i suggest taking a look on google, you should find a lot of information.  Good luck|`|2vzj65Kfaa	Aw c'mon now hon,     We can't be doing your homework for you.|`|DnWsMhwLaa	-why is it called the blues? it is a shortened version of duke's basketball team, the blue devils  -who first started it? thomas edison  -what instruments can be used in the blues? any  -are there special notes used in the blues? i think all notes are special, dont you?  -how old is the blues? no one knows exactly. pre-recorded music, possibly pre-historic, but that might just be my speculation  -why was it started? why is any music played  -in what year was it most popular? 1961  -where does it come from? cotton fields, dirt and drawers  -how many people can play blues? 47  -where do you play blues? in my house or in my car, mainly  -what makes it so special? all the special notes  -how many different rhythms are there? 29  -what is a blues scale? a scale used frequently in blues and rock music. prominently features minor 3rd and 7th.  -what is a baseline for the blues? well, the blues play hockey, not baseball, so they dont have baselines.  -what is a chord structure? the way the notes make up a chord|`|dekEk6dAaa	both those other guys answered you already.the wire and string dude hit the nail dead on the head so memorize what he wrote then do what the other guy said(your homework)|`|vKFneEuIaa	Go to Wikipedia.

DVuWsb2raa	could it be agadez??? My Ipod is dead but I do have thier whole collection.....     Here are the lyrics for agadez  I should have always known  Youd scratch that itch  When you asked for safe passage  On my shoulders where we slid  And just before you laid  Dead weight upon its shores  I stung you in the face  For thats the nature of my core    Because  I got distance  Dont let it close  Gotta let me know  You just gotta let me know    Because  Forget which way  Is out now  Gotta let me know  You just gotta let me know  Im nowhere near  This place you wear  Its unforgivable  It knows that I am visible  Im broken mirrors  And useless prayer  This lock is healing me  You know you came so willingly  Waiting is a vessel  That will take me to  Love, it knows no order   When you taste the truth  Because  Im trapped in this cement husk  Gotta let me go  You just gotta let me go    Because  I paid with own touch now  I bought a little cut  There is blood for every month  In the way you used to  Call her wicked answers  Time is a plague  Theres no time for this place  If you dont let me go   Heavens made a cesspool of us all    Im nowhere near  This place you wear  Its unforgivable  It knows that I am visible  Im broken mirrors  And useless prayer  This lock is healing me  You know you came so willingly  There burns a kiss with serpent scales  There is no miracle  I lost your miracle    I wrap myself around  Your buried questions  Through blisters of confinement  I seek to drain  This broken shelter  To refill the pigment case  That I have left    Dont stay long  For teeth nurse  The first wound  Coats revolve  Hope to gain  What if we find  What tongue ties double Windsor  Invoke to no reply  Those that lie  Have froze  At the border  No implies  Close the frame  What if we find  The sunlight draws a curtain  Invoke to no reply  Theres a place  Where this  Depth charge ignites  Where the soul has no purpose  I cant believe you  When your thirst wont let me go  I am the moment you were always speaking of  Because theres no fence will hold  The sentient culprit fall about it  Say where I can enter them  Culprit fell about it  One fell, the other taste wont lie  Make no doubt about it  How many blame  How many cave into the pressure I apply  If you take this breath of mine    try www.projectplaylist.com    You can listen to songs there by artist.. good luck|`|zIKCZi0Saa	The only song that sorta fits that description is Tetragrammaton, especially if it is an older one.

Robert Pattinson plays the part sooo well! And I can't wait for New Moon!    And by the way, at least we have hearts and are capable of love unlike those who (it pains me to say it) are not in love with him...|`|K1oOQqqVaa	You are not in love with him, you don't even know him!

Bella is such a lucky girl. If you haven't yet, read the books. It'll make you love him even more because they cut out a lot of the book in the movie and they didn't really stay to the book.     Edward is amazing, but a little too obsessive and has a temper, but the vampire part makes up for that. Yay Edward! ^_^|`|0GxV0gnaaa	I love the movie/books but I am not in love with a fictional character. sure I have a crush on Robert Pattinson but I mean jeez edward cullen isn't even real, why would you waste all your love on something that isn't real, and to some people who are calling rob ugly, just because he isn't as perfect as his character does not mean he's ugly. Everyone has a different taste, and i'm sure you were expecting Edward to be played by a model.But rob is just good looking in a unique way.|`|K8QRRp2Oaa	oh great......ANOTHER ONE      BTW his name is Rober Pattinson EVEN *I* KNOW THAT!|`|agpYSoobaa	YOU'RE NOT NORMAL!!!!!

5uvTte8Zaa	Thrash for sure. I have whiplash from Killing Is My Business And Business Is Good, listened to it twice yesterday.|`|ObeBvtzgaa	Thrash and death.  MQ: Pantera, Slayer, Cannibal Corpse, Deicide are great for headbanging.|`|1eQcq4eZaa	yes, it is undisputed in my book that you can play and enjoy thrash better when you headbang    death metal is okay, but sometimes you need to do the "head roll" with that stuff    any classic metal is good for a headbang!!|`|S6RfUHuxaa	the metal genre that i find it more headbangable than any other is : HEAVY METAL      and my favorite headbang band is : SLIPKNOT|`|tJpP8VRyaa	Rage Against the Machine is good..    Tool is also good, if you like more a slow build.. from jamming a little to full on headbanging by the end of the song.|`|8RtWoVWiaa	alright.. check out    All That Remains  Powerman 5000  Trivium  Five Finger Death Punch  Fear Factory (Obsolete album)   Testament  At The Gates  The Haunted|`|qz9trhYhaa	Yes. It's called ************* metal.  What do you expect me to headbang to punk? That's "go crazy" music metal is something to bang your ugly head to.    mq: in flames motherfuckers|`|zUi3nIPRaa	thrash   MQ:pantera|`|3RmwBjLwaa	Death Metal    I absolutely LOVE Dying Fetus. Listen to One Shot, One Kill, it's my favorite song ever. Give em a try :]|`|p9Wtbizuaa	Thrash for sure and the best thrash band to head bang to is the thrash kings Metallica|`|cbZdeOSPaa	I would say that Thrash, Groove and all the heavier stuff are more "headbangable".    MQ: Pantera, Metallica, Slayer, Megadeth, etc, etc but mostly Pantera :)|`|T9vf2uU7aa	I have been in and out of a few death metal bands, and they, by far, DEMAND the most headbanging.  Cannibal Corpse is one band I always find myself headbanging to, mainly because unlike a lot of other dm bands that constantly attempt to push the speed barrier, they incorporate much more groove into a majority of their songs.  Though that might also be because most of them are pushing 40.|`|jhYUvRaDaa	Nah! I think someones been telling you porkies lady.   Headbanging is something you do when your enjoying yourself and have so much adrenaline pumping you need a release- you can bang to dc, to purple and even to slow ones by rush or zep- yes you can bang to maiden and the disturbed - even nightwish or within temptation- The music doesnt have to be that fast and distorted to headbang to it- if I hear thrash I normally head for the bar- not headbang.|`|gDxMoBl9aa	Power Metal does it for Me actually.    MA: Helloween|`|OXvH2CgLaa	Metalcore  Post-hardcore  Deathcore  Some alternative and rock  Pop Punk you can bop your head back and forth to but not like serious headbanging.    Some of my favorite bands to headbang to:    Thursday  A Skylit Drive  Alesana  Bring Me The Horizon  Suicide Silence  Sonic Syndicate  Halifax  Madina Lake|`|7fEVNng5aa	Thrash, definitely. Machine Head has some fantastic headbangable tunes|`|64d33b21525c267f9af9181ffa2d6014aa	Thrash =  partial retina detachment  Speed =  self induced whiplash  Death =  serious throbbing at the base of the skull  Melodic death =  Excedrin headache  21    Megadeth is my all time favorite headbanging music.  I've seen them live a dozen times and I've probably caused myself irreparable spinal cord damage over the past 20 years.|`|i3PGjRRfaa	Vanilla Ice - Ice, Ice Baby is probably the best headbanging sone EVER!!!!!!!!!!!!!|`|8jd2AHJdaa	What's headbanging?|`|3e6758fcfd02678034cc2b0ff260959eaa	hey Lady Lucifera! yeah thrash and also good old fashioned 'heavy metal' ;)|`|rR6lwxjjaa	metalcore!    hey!  you're never on :(      MQ: my favorite bands are, Light This City & The Agonist  followed by:  bring me the horizon  yesterdays rising  as i lay dying  killwhitneydead  evergreen terrace  the demonstration|`|af2bcd9347369776f2a7c09928275944aa	Any thrash and power metal, here are some bands: DevilDriver, Pantera, Slayer, Machine Head, Overkill, Goatwhore (even though they kind of have a black metal feel), Testament. And there are some select hardcore and death metal bands that I really like, such as Chimaira, Killswitch Engage, Deicide, Cannibal Corpse, old Hatebreed (their last 2 albums kind of sux'd), Lamb of God.    MA: Slayer and Cradle of Filth|`|HNmO2ZwXaa	The best song to HEADBANG to is Among The Living by Anthrax, it ******* rules!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!1    http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sw6QwJy9g...|`|EjfJaNn7aa	nope...you can headbang to anything|`|9hCezzwRaa	Thrash for sure, Death you dang near bang your head right off!|`|MaUPQ7mEaa	Lamb of God  Machine head  DevilDriver  Five Finger Death Punch  groove metal?  death metal?

Ruyc3zGCaa	TARUS AS A PERSON.|`|qNKK4hLDaa	the moon is exalted in taurus, that's a positive aspect  you're an aries at heart, but you come off as a scorpio because well look at you, ALL CAPITAL LETTERS? if there's one word to describe scorpio, it would be intense    aries and scorpio are both ruled by mars, the planet of ENERGY, which is definitley what you display... lots of mars energy coming off from you... maybe even too much (hence other answers saying blablabla i cant understand your question blablabla)    but while mars is masculine, scorpio is feminine, and while mars is fire, scorpio is a water, and while mars is an initiator, scorpio is fixed (go vic d lol...).  this makes scorpio a very conflicted sign.  this is probably why (i think) scorpios are known for their intensity, because they have all that mars and fire influence combined with their deep emotions (cause scorpio being a water sign and all).  you come OFF as an introvert, but you're a passionate and energetic person at heart    your emotions aren't in tune with the way you project (your moon sign is your emotions and your rising sign is how you come across to people, your "mask" to the world) (your moon sign and ascendant are in opposition, a negative aspect)    but your moon is still exalted nonetheless, so although you might not project yourself the way you THINK you do, that doesn't mean that that's a bad thing|`|bvwYVGJOaa	Since you're Aries in sun, Scorpio in Asc and Taurus in moon  i'd say you're a cool down to earth person, attractive, funny, full of energy and high sex drive!    You're better off with a Scorpio sun maybe moon and Asc cos they will be faithful to you and never leave you. Avoid all fire signs if you want a long term relationship. Cancer and maybe Pisces will be alright for you. No Air signs cos they are airy! All Earth signs are good for you too. No Leo's ever! They are too selfish and self absorbed people.|`|9dea1f49efb6500e25de9621eba871b4aa	A person who may give out mixed messages. You're fiery and have  a very outgoing personality, but incredibly secretive about your real  feelings and too stubborn and perhaps suspicious to share  them.  You initially want to attract people, but then hit a brick wall when  it comes to actually interfacing. You need some kind of emotional  ladder to get over it. Try taking one sincere interest you have and  very openly share it with another, slowly opening up the other realms  of yourself when you feel you can trust them. It's a great combination,  incorporating many aspects of the human personality and when  you open the safe so to speak they'll be treasure inside.|`|g2Jr6zGKaa	?  sorry but i do not understand your Question.  pliz extend it...........;~D

OOkNg0IIaa	You have been scammed.  Start trying now to get your money back.  Any site charging you money for surveys is a scam.  legit surveys are always free to join and free to participate in.    Yes paid surveys are real, but the problem is that there are far more sites "posing" as surveys out there than there are real ones. I first started doing surveys about 5 years ago. I signed up with over 300 sites (today I am with well over 600 sites) and now, I regularly get paid by about 50 of them.    My first month I made a whopping $5. The next few months were more of the same. But I stuck with it and was patient. Today, again 5 years later, I regularly make at least $600 on paid surveys.    Here are the key things to remember.    1. There are no guarantees with surveys. It's all about your demographics. Sometimes they will want teens, other times they will want working moms, other time they will want physicians.    2. You really need to be with the biggest group of legit sites you can find. The more sites you are with, the more likely that you will actually match up your demographics with surveys and get paid.    3. Don't ever pay for a list. Period. All of the same information is out there for free.    4. Be patient. If it works for you, it won't work instantly. I can't tell you how many people have contacted me saying "I am giving up after a month." Well, like I said, if I did that I would have stopped making $5.    But the upside to surveys is that there is no risk. You don't spend any money and if you try it and like it, great. And if you don't you walk away. If you want to check out my blog where I track the survey sites that have actually paid me, feel free to visit http://www.thesurveystar.blogspot.com    Good luck!|`|ks2oieV0aa	no, but sounds like you have been scammed!

tNpnd7k1aa	What I tell my students to do is to find all the places where the two hands are playing a note together, and practise playing the blocks (ie, the left and right hand's single notes together). Then, when you can progress easily, add in the parts with just one hand in between. I don't know what grade you are at but I'm assuming you aren't very high!    Practise practise practise :o)|`|UhL7m301aa	Practice makes perfect....    Try some finger drills to speed it up...     Try some scales with the left hand, then the right, then both together.

gIFYYhEWaa	Adam,  I'm not real versed on strings but it would seem to me you'd want to make sure the length and thickness is correct.  Otherwise your ukulele will sound crummy.  Why not have your music store order you some tenor strings?  Go to a different store or order some online.  Loads of info on strings here:  http://ukulelehunt.com/buyaukulele/Ukule...

9ee25102a7763535588f4a899e88f4dcaa	I can see why you thought it might be Khachaturian - it does sound a bit like the slow movement of his Piano Concerto.    However, the extract was very short but I think it is a piece by Shostakovich called 'Assault on Beautiful Gorky' from the film score 'Unforgettable Year 1919'. It's a sort of Russian 'Warsaw Concerto'.
90jfKmABaa	The best way to learn bar chords is to start with an A chord. It is closer to the body frame which makes it easier to form. I battled with this issue for awhile since my hands are smaller than a normal guitarists'. Once you form the A chord strum it for a good 5 min or so and keep practicing it. It will take several weeks to build up the strength to hold your index finger down across the neck. After you are getting the A to sound good with minimal fret buzz(bumps), you can slide the hand to other positions, like a G or a B. The most difficult of the barre chords is the F but it can be played using the "cheater" way by using the thumb to hold down the E string. (which by the way can be used in all barre chords) Once you get the basic main scale down, you can switch to the other side by building strenght to your 3rd finger. Transitioning from G to C can help build this strength as well as A to D. Good Luck!!!!|`|AA11537248	Just play them.  Over and over.  You need to build up your ring finger's strength.|`|PugkFRRpaa	actually, i would play with thicker ones. then you could switch back to light and play them better i suppose.

pTERJdzQaa	Just introduce him to all the stereo-types that are placed on Anime, then maybe he will stop.    Or tell him about the real Japanese culture, and some of the negative things about the japan of today, and that might turn him off to Anime.    Tell him that Japanese and Asian culture is not the world, he can also be proud of America, you can try to introduce him to what other cultures out there.    But Listen: Bieng a Nerd is not a negative thing, bieng a nerd is one of the best things that you can be in life, I am a proud nerd, I stand for everything that nerd culture has to offer.    I stress pride in bieng a nerd.    Just take a look at my username, MY NAME IS NERD PRIDE!!!!!!  I encourage nerds, I do not discourage them in any manner.

At that age, a person is old enough to know what they like and enjoy.  Fitting in is not important, and if your son doesn't care about this then you shouldn't.  If it becomes a problem (his grades start going down, he starts watching porn) then make him cut back, but you can't completely stop him from doing what he likes.  Nothing wrong with nerdiness.  Also, why should he do things only because his friends like them?  That kind of conforming isn't good.|`|3N2ElzcQaa	Do not lose faith in your son.    What you can do is strict his schedule of watching anime. Limit his time. Bother him with questions and talk to him, but don't over do it.    Just try not to get him too over influenced with anime. Life's a good balance of reality and imaginary. Your son for the most part is going to the imaginary side, but there's not much info I can give you since you didn't say what your son does, aside the anime stuff.    Otherwise, just let him be. Its his first year of high school, and his life is just beginning. Depending on the people at the high school, he'll may or may not fit in or teased.     In my area, your son would be welcomed or left alone by others because the people in my area of groupies. People who are anime fans have their own groupies. I didn't join of course. I was with a group of differences. Most of the people around us just don't really care what others are into as long as they respect others. Be it drugs or sex or anime, its something that we all except from others because they are cool people with maturity and differences.|`|28498a903efb7372e241c2b455610196aa	Buy him a Hustler|`|6rR7LTl1aa	Let him.

Just tell him to try other stuff as well|`|P8gGMlbIaa	There is no cure for anime addiction, maybe over time you can hope he'll grow tired of it but that is not a guarantee. Porn doesn't work because there is anime porn out there called hentai, which he probably has already discovered as well. His life as a normal human being are over, he's gone over to the Otaku side. Once you go anime there's no going back.|`|Rxx7tM5Oaa	i am in 11 (high ) school i think these cartoon are matured enough to be watched by kid or anyone of any age|`|4nROh3yOaa	leave him bee|`|ndXvMLZ2aa	I don't think anyone would tease him for watching Naruto, DBZ, etc. Most people love that stuff, including me! I've never been made fun of.    And besides, even if people call him a nerd, what's wrong with that? I think you should let him do what he wants!|`|POwsWQOGaa	Sorry to say this but ur retarted.  Anime especially dbz and naruto pwn.  If anyone has anything wrong with them may they come to me.Im almost 19 and i swear i will tear up anyone that has anything against anime.

DONT U DARE LAY A FINGER ON HIM|`|f9488cf6c54eb1381e37dcd867602ea9aa	lol some of my friends are anime freaks  and I don't get teased for it (well mainly because most people here don't care about it) just let him watch    maybe he will meet some other anime freaks|`|LcSwDbr4aa	The only thing you can really do is let this anime obsession of your son's run its course.  There is nothing wrong with a lot of enjoyment out of watching anime, or constantly reading manga (japanese comics) it's better for him to be filling his time with that kind of stuff than getting into your typical high school troubles.  In a few years he'll mature enough to realize anime isn't everything (or at least admit that as cool as Dragonball Z and Naruto are, at the most basic level; one is pretty much a show about screaming guys whose hair changes from black to blonde and grows in length so they can fight a constant threat of powerful enemies, and the other is about a 12 year old ninja kid and his ninja classmates) and trust me, if he hasn't moved on to other anime titles by then, his friends who are probably getting into some of these titles (like Death Note) will try to counsel him in the ways of expanding how he spends his free time.  After all, there's no shame in being a nerd or otaku, but in time even the most hardcore of us will be forced to deal with the 'maturing' of our lives (being teased about being a nerd, no big deal; being teased by other nerds for liking Naruto when you are in your mid 20's or older, slightly more of a problem).  As for the video games, don't sweat it, as your son progresses through High School, standard norms of trying to fit in socially will kick in, besides your son will find out soon enough what the rest of the world thinks of anime themed games (and for the vast majority of anime games they are completely right).  Games like Halo 3 or whatever the latest coolest title is, will almost always be better than any anime game made (cuz anime games in general really, really suck graphically and usually in game play.)  The Final Fantasy series, being an exception.  If you really feel inclined to speed the process of ending your son's 'addiction' take him to a couple anime conventions so he can get a sensory overload of all things anime, and then find him a part time job so he can learn the virtues of hard work and saving money for the future for (future trips to additonal Conventions, or for college for a degree in a good paying occupation in order to support his anime habit)|`|iWXQH1Jeaa	Nothing.

He needs to find others that enjoy his interests, or other kids that least understand and respect his interests. Trust me on this: "fitting in" with the jocks, cheerleaders, etc. isn't worth it. You need to let your son be himself. Hopefully, he'll make more friends. If his current friends don't understand or make fun of him terribly, then maybe they're not really true friends. :)    Take it from someone who knows. He'll find his own crowd. And, as long as they're not juvinile delinquints, he'll be fine. :)|`|3u6fzQo1aa	There's lots of kids in highschool who watch anime. I'm sure he fits in with alot of people.

AA10025824	The only one I can think of that they actually killed without causing things to happen to kill them was the guy in the first movie with the snow plow.  But it was rated PG when it came out, and it was sort of a dark humor type of movie, so flat out killing people wouldn't have worked for that movie.|`|yZAcwN3haa	well in part 2 the cover people,bitting scracthing etc....   But it never shows those bodies.So no i dont think they kill.Just cause horrific moments to kill.|`|zRLqMik4aa	At the end of the first movie when Billy was trying to kill the leader in the store, remember the leader tried to kill Billy with a chainsaw?  They do kill people.  Hope that helped!

ThKkn5fKaa	The top main octave of the clarinet (C2 - C3) is essentially exactly the same as both main octaves of the soprano sax. (C1 - C3), with a couple of very minor exceptions.    Once you get above top C on the soprano though, all clarinet fingerings go out the window, because you have to switch to the palm keys, which don't exist on a clarinet.    The biggest difference between the two instruments, as far as notation is concerned, is that a clarinet can a perform a written E below middle C, where as a soprano sax can only go down to a written Bb below middle C.|`|rsg0zBT6aa	No they don't : ) But by the way, the biggest difference would probably be the mouth piece.|`|2zkcZNx0aa	almost exactly the same fingerings.I think its just when it gets high it gets different. If you want to check it out go on google and get 2 figner charts. Then compare them!!!simple,lol!    I luv the soprano sax.My best mate plays it and shes amazing!I got this from her so should be pretty accurate coz she used to play clarinet

dd7de1dd375fcb6afffc282f17c117c6aa	Hi Snowflakesashp,    I have Cancer rising, and I have been feeling like you described today too but for different reasons.  This is not typical for me.    I am so sorry to hear that you feel like your parents don't support you or care enough to talk to you about what you want in life.  I hope it is just a matter of them not realizing how significant it is for kids to have this in their lives because if you talk to them about your feelings like you have posted this question, perhaps they will make an effort to change that aspect about their parenting skills.  If it is because they truly do not care, well ......that, of course, is a different matter.      I am a parent of two boys, and your question made me think about what I need to be addressing with them - sometimes parents take for granted that their children are fine emotionally when there are no pressing or associated behavior problems.  I will talk to them today.|`|edJtHlDiaa	Omg i'm a cancer too and i'm like crying my eyes out so bad right now and i feel exactly like you do times 10,but you just have to keep your head up and know and hope that tomorrow will get better.|`|XUrgcOMDaa	It's proven that "winter blues" exist.  It's from lack of serotonin in the brain from not getting enough sun.  Essentially, it's a seasonal chemical imbalance.    If you feel like it... a tanning booth can help give you what the sun is not giving you right now.|`|yvfQpDabaa	I hate this weather.  I hate a lot of things right now.  I get like that too, I think a lot about stuff, and people.  People just suck sometimes....it's as simple as that.|`|eOZvYxJTaa	ahh me too. i already feel like crap. ive been goin to volleyball every night which is wearing me out. i cant sleep. i have crush troubles (he dont like me and im like madly like him blah blah blah) and im just so sick of everything. :( but it feels good to rant. haha.|`|AA12215623	Man, that happens to me all the time. I'm just stressed about finances like the rest of the world. I'm getting over my ex though there's still pain. He's not affecting my life too much anymore.|`|rMlGeeg9aa	well I feel the same...alot these days since my partner for almost 9 months left me for no apparent reason...I can't sleep at all really. havn't slept in almost a week to be honest. I wake up with tears down my face and in a cold sweat if I do sleep and I know...that I dreamed of her and how I feel I failed her and everyone else...|`|y5dwVEK5aa	oh no huney when im feeling bad i just go drink something when youre old enough you can too|`|c9eaa57a6e6fa62cf9d523ee467b0c69aa	I am a Double Cancer and I have been very emotional this week as well, it has be completely a poopy week!  Hope it gets better soon.    Good luck to you.|`|JvbvGtrBaa	i know what u mean when your parents are neglectiful it shatters our psychological needs of belonging and family especially hard on a cancer like you thats so emotional and needs alot of love.  i'm sorry  i'm a libra my parents are the same. i had to pretend they died when i was 18 cause they didn't want to support me anymore. they couldnt' even talk to me more then a couple times a year.  it truely heart breaking   keep your goals morals and chin up the sun will shine. it's allways dark before the sun rise.  i felt like crying a few times today. this whole week or two has been awful my business is about to close and my boyfriend who knocked me up has left me cause i'm pregnant and hes not ready, so yah i want to cry every time i miss him. i hate having to hate it's so unhealthy.|`|f40SU95Yaa	OMG, I Was Seriously About To Ask A Similar Question, Until I Seen Yours.     I Am A Aquarius Female, But I'm Not The Typical 100% Aquarian Though, I'm Extremely Emotional, My Cancer Best Friend, Said I Fit The Cancer Description More Than Her, LOL.    But To Answer Your Question, Yes, I Have Been Feeling Very Down/Sad/Fed Up/Depressed Lately, Even Heart Broken, I've been withdrawn, But For Some Reason Today Unlike The Past Days, I Feel Better, Yesterday I Did Something I Hadnt Did In A Very Long Time, I Relaxed & Read A Good Book, Started A Journal (I Wrote Down My Thoughts/Feeling) & I Just Took Sometime To Think About What I Can Do To Stop Feeling This Way. I Hope You Start To Feel Better Just Try To Do Something Old Or New That Will Relax You/Ease Your Mind, Read A Good Book, Watch A Comedy Movie Or Talk To A Trustworthy Friend Or Start A Journal.    I Told My Best Friend Today, Isnt It Great How In The Bad Times In Life You Cant Erase The Good Memories, But In The Good Times You Can Erase The Bad Memories.    :) :)|`|Fb2xM1kJaa	Me!! I'm so serious I'm tired of being sad!

Take a hot bubble bath by candlelight with your favorite music playing, read a great romance novel, write in your journal, watch a great movie ! You know what I like to do when I am feeling down ? I reorganize my house.  Clean your room, rearrange your furniture, clean out your closet...it sounds silly, but sometimes having a different view of your room can cheer you up ! Hope you start feeling better !!|`|GBSnBbWiaa	Aww don't be upset! you are just not havin a good day!!!                                                       I Will Pray For You  Good luck|`|e14b1125c91fafed4795c69469f8b509aa	I'm actually feeling pretty damn upbeat and energetic. I can't sit still lately and I have all of this extra energy. I'm a lot more optimistic than usual too. Sorry for all those that are feeling down though :( Hopefully things will look up soon.

(as i told you before) and now she just sent me a message about a magazine article. it was an interview with micheal, and he said that he wasn't happy at all with rob, because their chemistry with kristen was amazing. [my] robbie apparantly kept flirting with him, and an observer said that kristen was responding. the observer also said that all of this jealous behaviour of micheal was pushing kristen towards rob. he might as well push a little further. though i believe rob is a far, FAR bigger competition compared to micheal angarano. that guys an idiot. so i believe you might want to stop hoping kris will date rob.

K2J4DeGkaa	1) Answer is 5    There are two scenarios:    Scenario 1 (Statement 1 is true, therefore Statement 2 is false, therefore Statement 3 is true, etc - it alternates until you find Statement 10 is false, thereby making Statement 1 true, as you first assumed it to be)    1. T   2. F   3. T   4. F   5. T   6. F   7. T   8. F   9. T   10.F     Scenario 2 (assuming Statement 1 is false, then Statement 2 is true, thereby making Statement 3 false, thereby making Statement 4 true, etc. - again, alternating until Statement 10, which is true, thereby making Statement 1 false, as initially presumed.)    1. F  2. T  3. F  4. T  5. F  6. T  7. F  8. T  9. F  10.T    In either scenario, the number of true statements is 5.     2) Any three consecutive numbers will be at least 15 because all the numbers together (0 + 1 + 2 ... + 9) is equal to 45.  45/3 = 15, meaning that no matter how you arrange the numbers, their average sum in the end will be 15.|`|fxxARcknaa	they are all true.    can't be done.|`|rvVkwNBIaa	they are all true   i don't know number two

According to Rolling Stone Magazine, which voted this the  1 song of all time.  "Just as Dylan bent folk music's roots and forms to his own will, he transformed popular song with the content and ambition of "Like a Rolling Stone." And in his electrifying vocal performance, his best on record, Dylan proved that everything he did was, first and always, rock & roll. " 'Rolling Stone' 's the best song I wrote," he said flatly at the end of 1965. It still is."|`|g9t2LQhtaa	Cradle of filth - Hallowed be thy name

Depends on the restaraunt really if its swanky i would go for a black suit with a red shirt, you need a flash of colour or pattern, but if its more casual why not a colourful shirt, black waistcoat and black jeans?

jR0VTOYFaa	DECISIVE BATTLES - HISTORY CHANNEL
rsg0zBT6aa	Make sure it has weighted keys, it's full size (88 keys), and does dynamics : )|`|obGQ2Bqfaa	I don't see how a full-size keyboard would take up that much more room than an upright piano. also a reasonable quality second-hand upright might work out cheaper than a fully-weighted keyboard.|`|CLfjamAPaa	Look at the Casio Privia Series. We have one for our kids to practice piano on. They are excellent, have weighted keys and footpedals.|`|pkHSuJi3aa	Yamaha definitely|`|OiiKPGwlaa	I would say get a Yamaha keyboard, they're most similar to a real piano. You can start out with a keyboard, but as you advance you're going to need a piano. A keyboard can definitely ruin your touch, but if it's just the beginning, you'll be able to get used to a piano when you get one. Try to buy a keyboard that has a pedal capability, dynamics, and all the keys. It makes things much easier as get into more and more complex music.     I have a Baldwin upright, and I love it. It doesn't take up much space. So, if you're serious in piano I would suggest just buying a piano. Good luck, and I hope you enjoy your classes! =D|`|yQMYiF3gaa	I see everyone saying that it's terrible to learn on a keyboard, but I don't have a clue where they're coming from, because I played solely on a keyboard (to practice at home, anyway, there was a piano at my teacher's house) for the first 3 years that I played (and I've played for 4 1/2, almost 5 years now) and I had no trouble switching over.  Weighted keys and full size would be very helpful, though, that's something my keyboard doesn't have, it was just a cheapo from radioshack.  best christmas present I ever got, though!  Good luck!|`|828ac86c4aed6b8aab5980e0aa7d0831aa	To be honest it's hard to get good at piano on a keyboard...I'm 15 and I've played for 11 years and for a year while we were in an apartment we had a keyboard and it totally ruined my touch. I would look into some upright pianos because quite frankly they aren't that much bigger than most of the good keyboards and it is definitely worth the extra money.    But, if you have to get a keyboard go to a store that has a lot of them and talk to some of the sales people about what keyboards actually have a, um, piano like touch if that makes sense. Because the thing is that the keys on keyboards make it very very hard to control dynamics.... But they will know best. Or you could even call up your teacher and ask what she suggests.    Hope this helps and have fun..piano is an awesome instrument, I love it!|`|NAPrCUDaaa	i don't know of a particular brand, but make sure you get one with controlled dynamics, and possibly one with footpedals. I had that problem when i first started piano too, and i found it really hard to practice using dynamics when I couldn't practice them on my keyboard.  good lucky!
UXFLXzMuaa	Epiphone is about the best guitar you can buy on a budget, it's from the same company that makes Gibson guitars so you know it's not gonna be a piece of crap. I personally like Yamaha guitars but they are a bit expensive unless you can find a second hand one at a good price.  Hope this helps.|`|fzm74wVcaa	Go to Sam Ash (samash.com) or Guitar Center (guitarcenter.com) they usually have beginner/value packages from Fender, Ibanez, Epiphone, Squier that come with amps, gig bags effects and the like. For the right guitar I'd suggest you go to the stores and check them out, the feel, the sound and your personal preference comes into play and differ from brand to brand.|`|fFObxgxuaa	RockBand or Guitar Hero guitars are pretty good for beginners!|`|rIFqv8nvaa	Buy an ibanez rg370dx. I play on one, sounds wicked. But if you cant afford one ( i paid like 400$) get a ds1 distortion and a cheap old washburn. Dont forget a decent amp. Good starter amp is kirk hammetts kh-15 randall (100$$)

EjX9p9dBaa	Ok let me give you a review in my own words:    In 2009 a vaccine is created that can defeat cancer, however the vaccine is a virus that is man made.  The virus begins to spread doing either two things, killing a person who comes into contact with it or turning them into beings called the Infected.  Only a small number of humans were immune to the virus including Robert Neville (Will Smith).  Trying to contain the virus to NYC the government destroys all ways in and out, however the virus has already gotten outside the containment zone.  Robert Neville stays in Manhattan (Ground zero for the outbreak) to try and find a cure.    For three years (the movie actually takes place in 2012) Robert Neville has worked day and night trying to come up with a cure, while living alone in NYC and possibly the world.  His only companion is a German Shepherd named Samantha (Sam) that his daughter gave him to look after.  Everyday at noon he goes to the Pier and broadcasts to any possible survivors that he is alive and can provide food and shelter.    After a 3 year wait Surviors finally find him in NYC and tell him off a Colony in Vermont where all other survivors have gone too.  Seems the virus doesn't like the cold.  However time is running short cause the Infected know where he lives and are coming for him and his newly found friends.|`|yqe0I5zpaa	I Am Legend is a remake of the hit film Omega Man. Will Smith gives a heartrending and thrilling performance as the last man on Earth. The film is great for the first 30 minutes, but the lack of flashbacks and the lack of a true ending make this apocalyptic thriller nothing better than mediocre.    grade -  C+|`|aooO3jhWaa	Go to themoviespoiler.com and you can read about it.|`|zetxxZWUaa	Remake to the classic Vincent Price film, "Last Man on Earth."    Will Smith is a scientist who thinks he's responsible for a virus break out, and New York is swarming with zombie like humanoids. He fights for food and tries to fix the zombies and make them how they were before. At the end he dies saving a mom and her child and they travel to a sanctuary where there are other survivors.    That's all you need to know.|`|a8eb523f1f34be04fb9b4d5c65f11847aa	here you go  http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/I_Am_Legend...|`|f1aa4b48e29847dd1850b63dadd969cdaa	http://www.reelviews.net/movies/i/i_am_l...  hope that helps|`|J76BMuEVaa	One man and his dog subsist in a near future New York where a man made virus has killed most of the world's population and transformed others into ravening monsters. Will Smith stars in this latest adaptation of Richard Matheson's classic novel    i think you will enjoy it i did but all im saying is get the tissues out......|`|d334491b0919df3ba6915bd08a255b70aa	Oooo in my opinion it was pretty scary!  But it must have been hard for Will Smith to act all on his own throughout the film (except from his dog) with no one to bounce off of.  I Am Legend had great visual effects and a good story line.  I would recommend it!|`|LU7WB6Poaa	"I Am Legend" is a remake of "Omega Man."    Will Smith plays a doctor who becomes that last man on Earth when a cancer cure transforms/mutates people exposed to it.  He and his dog must fight for their lives while Will tries to find a cure to reverse the ill effects of the cancer "cure."|`|QBTsvijnaa	Robert Neville is a scientist who was unable to stop the spread of the terrible virus that was incurable and man-made. Immune, Neville is now the last human survivor in what is left of New York City and perhaps the world. For three years, Neville has faithfully sent out daily radio messages, desperate to find any other survivors who might be out there. But he is not alone. Mutant victims of the plague -- The Infected -- lurk in the shadows... watching Neville's every move... waiting for him to make a fatal mistake. Perhaps mankind's last, best hope, Neville is driven by only one remaining mission: to find a way to reverse the effects of the virus using his own immune blood. But he knows he is outnumbered... and quickly running out of time. Written by Warner Bros. Pictures

cw2KARcPaa	YES. I am really enjoying it so far, my only issue is that I have to wait a week before new episodes! That, and each episode is only so long...    But I like where it is going, and questions are being answered. It is understandable for some die-hard LOST fans to be apprehensive about the new season because there are less questions and more answers. The entire show has been about asking crazy questions and only giving a few clues here and there and then there are the wacky theories that us fans love to babble on and on about. There are still some small questions, but the answers are coming faster and we are starting to get answers about bigger questions from the last 4 seasons.     The show has not lost (heh heh) any of its pizzazz. It is still smart and fun and tense and thrilling and hilarious. I just wish the producers had decided to go with a full 22 episode season, but what can you do? At least they didn't cancel the show (yet, I mean, I know it will be ending after next season).    LOST is still amazing! And always will be...|`|U8aXa8xEaa	I love it, love it, love it, love it, looooove it!|`|ETIHOWt9aa	Its awsome!|`|1eUS84GBaa	this serie is fantastic why are you don't like it ?|`|DUg1IkTIaa	It's the best show on TV right now.|`|14c690b99c03a819fd4f7cbcd14bac5eaa	It's freaking awesome!|`|ZQc0mMQVaa	I'm loving it!

yqe0I5zpaa	It's great, Angelina Jolie is incredibly sexy, it has awesome action sequences and the ending the curve bullet suicide and the decoy at the end is just cool. Great movie!!|`|5673ef8ed5e8008f074e69bcf4c7d2b9aa	Should have been titled "UN-Wanted"|`|zetxxZWUaa	It was awesome, yes it was unrealistic but so is Spiderman. It followed the comic book almost scene by scene. Great cast, great action, great everything. Just a kick-azz mindless action film.|`|oXFVRYCsaa	Its a brilliant Movie, a little far fetched but really good|`|70aa0db8082ddead46f656ecb978193aaa	Great effects...totally unrealistic...but entertaining.  Angelina Jolie is smokin' hot as usual, but the main character is a whiney little punk most of the time.|`|c302cbf4b446e1a459fa99e0177f27c7aa	Crap, just another action movie with a silly story woven around the gun fights.|`|hN2j60pgaa	you see angelina jolie's butt  =AWESOME!|`|AA11540749	amazing!!!!!!! Watch it!|`|c3422906f474ce95c21b82d49cc4d3adaa	angelina is all you need to make a good movie :)|`|eD2AFzH3aa	It was an okay movie, but could of had just a little more action in it. And I thought Angelina Jolie would have had a bigger role in the movie. I mean, she was in it but, really didn't do anything|`|046473fd7f160fe7a30e657aa5faaf75aa	It started a little slowly, but in the end it was worth the wait to get the plot rolling.  I don't like to give away a movie, so no details here except to say it was very entertaining in a comic book sort of way.  I'd add it to my DVD collection.     I like Morgan Freeman and it was quite a different role for him, though not really a major one.  Angelia earned her paycheck.  The rest of the cast was pretty good too, but none were irreplaceable, including the main character.      Overall, I give it a B for its genre.|`|21eb1fee7277ed0dfc6c417c0a528dddaa	It is a waste of time and money. I didn't even bother watching the ending because it's so bad. This idea of binary code being found in a weaving loom, was way to farfetched for me. Notice that the other responders focused on whore Jolie for their apporval of this film. Proves it is a bad film.|`|H5wdVWTeaa	It was a good movie with a good plot.  However it would have been alot better if the action sequences looked more realistic. It was too much like a video game.

CInHTKJcaa	umm....i am 18 (or maybe 19)  i watch naruto  my suggestion (valid only if you are actually 13/14):  please give up on naruto...before it's too late  unless you want to be addicted like i am    seriously, it's no joke....  i visit one manga every 4 hours just to see if any new chapter is there  i became an otaku and i started learning japanese (pretty much...got nowhere) so that i can read the raw (other than that, japanese is pretty useless to me)  i go on at least 15 different sites to see which one host the highest quality episodes....    seriously, if this goes on like this, my life will end up being one of 'em    it's not too late  focus on studies  don't be too careful on what anime you watch  make it a time-pass sort of thing...don't get too deep into it  and for god's sake no naruto (it's way too addicting to resist...try other animes ^_^)    Edit:  and no matter how i put it, it is still a joke ^_^|`|Y6xanshEaa	;) Naruto has no age limit.

I think I would go with Jackie Chan because his stunts are so incredible.  I'm sure you have to have seen Forbidden Kingdom.  The fights between those two are absolutely amazing.

29def525b4de3e4f1e95aaabfaa25f77aa	I disagree with you. I love Sharon and Nick. But, Nick and Sharon won't be reunited for a while. She will sleep with Billy after they both get drunk. Sounds wierd but it's supposedly true. Nick will have decided to stay with Phyllis. I think Summer will turn out to be Jack's child and that Sharon will be pregnant. Of course she won't know who the father is. That has to be the reason they are having her sleep with two men so close together. For the moment Nick and Phyllis are together, but not for long.|`|c159efe1b44ee4b1b369d779c1d19521aa	I like Nick and Phyllis together too! Sharon is such a prude to me. She is sooo Yawn, but Phyllis makes the show interesting with her craziness! Sharon better watch out though, b/c Phyllis is crazy!
sIhPpdv3aa	Jeesus and the devil decide to have one last big battle for all of humanity. Jesus lets the devil pick the contest, and he picks... Computer Programming!    They gather in a large room. In the center are two computers and chairs. On one side are all the angels of Heaven, on the other side are all the deamons of Hell.     In walks Jesus! The angels sing a heavenly note! The deamons hissssss...    In walks the devil! The deamons let out a loud cheer and stomp! The angels give an *Ahem.    They both have a seat. Ready... set... GO! They both start programming. The devil is programming furiously! His fingers are flying across the board... lines of efficient and effective code are spilling onto the screen! The deamons cheer and scream and stomp! "Go, Go, Go!!!"    Jesus is typing away at a steady pace. The lines apear on the screen in due time. as he steadily types the angels are humming... a slightly concerned look crosses their faces. "umm... come on. You can do it... go Jesus?"    This goes on for a while, and time is almost up. the devil's code is something glorious and it is performing incredibly. The deamons are energetic and cheering, knowing that victory was at hand. Jesus was finishing up his simple, but functioning code. Then... a few seconds before it was over... the lights went out! They had lost all power! *GASP*    The lights came back on and it was over. The devil looked down at an empty screen, but there was Jesus' program, ready to go! The devil had lost!    The moral of this story is: Jesus Saves!    *cue rimshot ;)|`|2a9jRZGRaa	Little Sunshine    Little Sunshine comes home from first grade and tells her father that they learned about the history of Valentine's Day.     "Since Valentine's Day is for a Christian saint and we're native americans," she asks, "will God get mad at me for giving someone a valentine?"     Little Sunshine's father thinks a bit, then says "No, I don't think God would get mad. Who do you want to give a valentine to?"    "Osama Bin Laden," she says.     "Why Osama Bin Laden," her father asks in shock.     "Well," she says, "I thought that if a little American Native girl could have enough love to give Osama a valentine, he might start to think that maybe we're not all bad, and maybe start loving people a little bit. And if other kids saw what I did and sent valentines to Osama, he'd love everyone a lot. And then he'd start going all over the place to tell everyone how much he loved them and how he didn't hate anyone anymore."    Her father's heart swells and he looks at his daughter with newfound pride.     "Little Sunshine, that's the most wonderful thing I've ever heard."     "I know," Little Sunshine says, "and once that gets him out in the open, the Marines   could blow the crap out of him."|`|w52W5Ch3aa	whats the diffrence between gay guy and hilter?

She noticed the man opposite her was smiling at her. She immediately moved to another seat. This time the smile turned into a grin, so she moved again. The man seemed more amused. When on the fourth move, the man burst out laughing, she complained to the driver and he had the man arrested.   The case came up in court. The judge asked the man (about 20 years old) what he had to say for himself. The man replied, 'Well your Honor, it was like this, when the lady got on the bus, I couldn't help but notice her condition. She sat down under a sign that said, 'The Double Mint Twins are coming' and I grinned. Then she moved and sat under a sign that said,' Logan 's Liniment will reduce the swelling,' and I had to smile. Then she placed herself under a deodorant sign that said, 'William's Big Stick Did the Trick,' and I could hardly contain myself. ; But, Your Honor, when she moved the fourth time and sat under a sign that said,   'Goodyear Rubber could have prevented this accident'...

The rear tiger apologized, and they continued onward.    About five minutes later, it happened again. The front tiger turned, growling, "I said stop it." The rear tiger again apologized, and they continued.    Another five minutes passed, and again the front tiger felt the unwanted tongue. The front tiger turned, giving the rear tiger a ferocious glare, angrily hissing, "What is it with you?"    The rear tiger replied, "I'm sorry -- I really didn't mean to offend you.

6sAbs2iiaa	Very good question.I'm sick and tired of these lost case stars . They are bad example to young teenagers most young girls find themselves ugly cause they compare themselves to these fake female stars they have full of makeup all over plastic surgery  and are sooo computuralized in videos tv and pics . I also find most stars they do drugs , they sleep around adultery they are just very low peoples but unfortunately the world looks at them and says wow hope everyone could see them like I do.|`|njFi9fmWaa	They live a lifestyle that has no red lights. They have money, cars, clothes, connections, and no matter what they do, or how low they "really" are, we still see them as magnificent.|`|QlJje9iAaa	Because they make a lot of money.|`|TxvIoWVGaa	They are always airbrushed in picture, making them virtually gorgeous and perfect looking. In all videos of them and photoshoots, they all look like they are having so much fun living the great life Hollywood provides them with. Plus, people admire the work the people do. I love Taylor Swift because she is so pretty, i love her music, and she's so smart.   And in all of the interviews they give, it's all 'Oh, I love my co-stars and I love my life right now. I am happily in a relationship with so-and-so and Oh, I am so happy!' and thats not true usually, but people are jealous anyway and aspire to have that perfect, bump-free life.  Plus, when designers give them free clothing and accesories, they never leave the house looking anything but fabulous. So, girls look up to that and want to be all fashionable like so-and-so, so they buy the girls line of clothing (what famous celeb doesn't have her own line of clothing/accesories/perfume) thinking they will be all fabulous too.|`|1pOqqYGDaa	To be honest I am the worlds worst to know anything about hollywood stars...

cWjrtIlKaa	Dark Night is an intense action filled thriller, and I would definitely recommend it if you enjoyed the first one. The only drawbacks are that it seems to drag on.    Burn After Reading is quite a funny comedy, that involves LOTS of situation irony and comedy. This movie doesn't have a lot of one-liners or stuff like that but I would also recommend this movie as well.    It all depends on your mood: Action or Comedy|`|Limt9t5Qaa	Burn after reading is one of the biggest wastes of time in the history of Wasting time.

Or, a so called comedy with a lot of big name actors which is enormously cruder than any of it's trailers indicated it was. I would rather watch Mamma Mia myself.

IcUsSPeUaa	Jackson Warriors, Jackson Randy Rhoads Guitars, Jackson Kellys    Jackson Kellys  Gibson Explorers  Jackson King V are cool too|`|QY5YOZcmaa	Well zakk wylde plays a les paul -  and thats pretty metal.    I think Ibanez are the best all round guitar brand. Although most superstrats are good for metal. I personally hate jackson and ESP, but they are both popular choices. Also, look into a gibson SG -  not a typical Metal guitar, but works suprisingly well.    My favorite brands are ibanez, musicman and fender. A musicMan would actually work really well, but they cost a lot. Look into OLP (cheaper musicman).|`|dc49d60c4d19a92e193ce2f41c92cfedaa	Dean|`|p9Wtbizuaa	I love the Gibson Explorer or The Flying V|`|LkN5nr6faa	I love Razorbacks and MLs, as well as any deviation of a Superstrat (whether it be a Superstrat model by Ibanez, Schecter, Washburn, Music Man, etc.)|`|3jFm0rWdaa	Of course the Gibson Les Paul will always be the old standby.  But there are so many other great guitars out there - I love the Jackson Randy Roads model for real metal with the look plus the functionality.|`|h1yGVkkfaa	Either the Ibanez iceman or the Dean razorback.|`|hJP9y6kjaa	I think Les Pauls make great metal guitars - nice solid, thick tone, great for punishing chunk! As the other answerer said, Zakk Wylde uses one... kind of hard to argue with that....    I think Ibanez is a great guitar for metal. I don't know what it is about them, but when I pick one up I instantly want to start busting out crazy metal riffs (and I'm not normally a metal player!).    I like my Jackson Dinky... Jackson makes some great guitars, perfect shredding, great for leads. Metal = no problem, unless you define metal as exclusively detuned nu-metal or something.    I like how the Explorers look... BC Rich guitars can look cool, but their construction, playability, and overall tone can really be lacking in the lower price point models (ie the Warlocks especially). I will certainly never buy a BC Rich guitar again. I feel about the same as Dean... but its more of a principle thing. Any company who pimps out a dead rockstar to sell a product is lacking ethics and integrity, I think. It isn't even the same company as when Dimebag was around.... it's all changed...     I think Epiphone guitars are a solid buy, although they need to be set up to play "fast".    My favorite guitar for heavy metal... is mine. =) I play through a few guitars (ie the aforementioned Jackson Dinky) but my two main axes are LTD's... an LTD EC-50 and an LTD EC-100QM. Both are pretty cheap guitars, sure, but after a good setup and (extensive) customization (ie new pickups, new wiring, etc) they play well and sound superb. Basswood has some lower end, but it tends to be pretty bright in the upper mids - good for cutting through a mix and being very "present". I just finished customizing the EC-100QM (hence when I'm so bubbly about it).... Seymour Duncan pickups (Alnico II Pro in the neck, think very Slash, and Alternative 8 in the bridge, think the JB crossed with the Full Shred - high output, with solid chunk and great cleans... both coil-tap well, too, something I wasn't necessarily expecting!), onboard buffer circuit, etc etc.    I've compared it side by side with my buddy's Schecter loaded with EMGs and we both have to agree that it sounds just as good, if not better - certainly has better low end!    Admittedly, I'm not huge into "metal" per se, but I do love me some tasty Recto-style aggressive rhythms. Guess that counts. =)    Anyhoo, "favorite" really only comes down to how it looks, how it sounds, and how it plays. Looks are subjective, metal tone overall depends more on the amp, speakers, and pickups then the guitar itself, and how it plays really depends on how well the neck fits your hand and if its set up properly.

Fender Startocaster also original.|`|KU3wIBXnaa	Explorer \m/|`|DnWsMhwLaa	you know one of the things i really like about my main guitar (bass actually)? i have never seen another like it anywhere. i like unique interesting guitars, i like custom shops, i get bored with seeing strats and les pauls all the time.|`|V0S92gZLaa	As a guitarist, I love the Explorer. It is undeniably metal, yet you can still hold it normally while sitting, unlike the V, which you have to stick between your legs....    Also, any axe with a Floyd Rose or any other double-locking tremelo is insanely awesome and rock'n. A guitar can play heavy riffs and then bust out a face-melting shred complete with fancy whammy bar licks is a guitar worthy to play The Metal.|`|Cppi6kRFaa	If you going by shape alone then anything by B.C.

t2evcVVEaa	great question. very good. If i may, id like to give you a top 2.    1. Johnny Cash - Johnny Cash. The fact that Johnny was AMAZING at telling stories gets him to the top of my list. from "Dont take your guns to town" to sons like "Cadillac (one piece at a time)" this guys could hammer out a great story and throw some guitar chords on top of it.      2. Jason Wade - Lifehouse. Never have i seen someone with the ability to convey emotions onto a page like Jason can. from Spin: "and the world keeps spinning around, my world is upside down, and i wouldnt change a thing, ive got nothing else to lose, I lost it all when i found you and i wouldnt change a thing." to Trying: "could you let down your hair and be transparent for a while, just a little while, to see if your human after all, honesty is a hard attribute to find, when we all want to seem like we've got it all figured out..." my soul has never been touched in the way that Jason Wade's songwriting does.|`|QWaspeg7aa	MIchael Stipe. I can't stand lyrics about nothing but his are always about something. I love Tori Amos's lyrics too.|`|ceF5X2m7aa	Billie joe from green day   because all hes lyrics are just perfect|`|PJSCDoaraa	jason mraaz. :D  i love his lyrics there so cool and happy|`|hxAieDWoaa	2pac.... gorgeous lyrics . he has lyrics that anyone and everyone can relate to...rich,poor black or white etc. each song has a message behind it.|`|7AHn3D5Laa	2pac...He tells a story and it makes sense.... and number 2 EMINEM,WHO COULD THINK A WHITBOY CAN RHYME LIKE THAT THAT ...BRILLIANT..|`|T5DbLLgQaa	The lyricist of Enya -Roma Ryan. Each of her songs are like a small story!|`|kktoXldiaa	Lacey Mosley. The lead singer of the band "flyleaf" is a amazing lyricist. All of them come from things she has delt with in the past and some of the things she is dealing with now. Also a lot of them are about God because the band are christians and  how she found him and all of that. They're lyrics are beautiful.
cd8ff0f053ce1a2e1b3303ea5ec2f1c7aa	i liked her then and i still like her now. the girl makes hits and can dance her butt off.|`|TxvIoWVGaa	I liked her back then, because that was her REAL voice, not a mixed-up synthesizer fake-itizing her good voice. Plus, now her songs are only about the paparazzi and being famous in her life, and it gets annoying. It's like, we know you are tired of being famous! But, I have to admit, her dancing has gotten better in the years. But nothing beats the classic Hit Me Baby One More time!!! haha.|`|294e1701917b0ab03a81e21b3d809bd2aa	i like her now cuz she;s funny.|`|3FnhJluuaa	i loved her better back then. he actually wrote a couple of songs for blackout which never made it and i have to say wow cause it was actually her voice and not computerized. But i still love her.|`|S2dM6AANaa	well i like all her music but i love her new album.|`|PaZosnMPaa	now|`|zhrGiQsKaa	i like her more back then, but she has really made a giant improvement from her Blackout album which was horrible. Circus is my favorite of all her albums, i wish she would make some more songs like: oops i did it again and baby one more time.|`|uXbWtgnsaa	I remember her back then, oh those were the days. The style, the music. good times...good times..I like all of her music.|`|ja0qW30Maa	I kinda like her new music, but I liked her back then too. She wasn't so much of a joke back then
tuvcxnJXaa	You're not doing anything wrong.    But, when/if that song does find you, it will hit you like a ton of bricks.    I once read a story that when Axl Rose first heard U2's "One", he was driving.   He pulled over and began to cry, because the lyrics hit him so hard.|`|yS61H04haa	Are you serious?             You just haven't found the song that really hits close to home yet.|`|2k8TEiRtaa	Your not doing anything wrong. You have to connect the song with something you have lost or want really badly. Like someone you love but can't have.|`|8jd2AHJdaa	You sound normal to me|`|qThmcR1Aaa	I'm with everyone else. I wouldn't worry about it. Some people have a deeper emotional connection with music than others. There are so many songs that give me goose bumps, make me exuberant, make me sad, make me think ... but not everyone is like that. It's all good.    On the other hand, maybe you just haven't found the "right" song yet. Music speaks differently to different people. Sarah McLachlan's "I Will Remember You" makes me blubber like a baby, mostly because I associate it with a breakup with an old girlfriend. Other people probably just think it's a pretty song and move on, unaffected.|`|pfEbS1Ljaa	you just havent found the right song like "red hot chili peppers- Californication" hits me hard and its only cause my dad and i use to listen to it before ... well anyway you will find it just try different stuff and it really doesnt matter actually its really stupid haha|`|AA12203920	it helps if you listen to that song at an early age....    you cant relate to the song. thats why people cry when they listen to those emo break up songs cause they feel it. theyve been through that in one way or another.       its fine. youve just never had your heart broken or whatever yet(:    you may want to try exploring other fields of music. maybe your musical tastes are too narrow, so you havent found a song emotional and heartfelt enough to cry to yet...you know what im sayin? like I wouldnt be able to cry to rihanna or like all american rejects....    try searching "what song always makes you cry" in the y! a searchbar at the top..youll get some suitable songs if you really wanan knoe what it feels like|`|1vCoaf08aa	You just haven't found the right song yet.    I think I found mine, because Bruce Springsteen's Wreck On The Highway brings me to tears every time.|`|LkN5nr6faa	You just haven't found the right song yet.|`|C7YbYUYPaa	Really, it isn't that big of a deal.    Some people just don't get emotional with music.  Most people that do, usually have a memory tied with certain songs that sparks that emotion.  Maybe it reminds them of a lost loved one or a time like graduation, who knows, but it doesn't happen for everyone.|`|7fEVNng5aa	Ditto everyone else.     I've only had two songs that affected me the way you're talking. One is Great Gig in the Sky by Pink Floyd, the other being 10,000 Days (Wings for Marie pt.2) by Tool. And those two get me every time.    So, I'm in my mid 30's and I've only had two. You may never find one that connects with you on that level, but the search will be fun anyways.

The same people have been in it for decades and nothing happens. It's BORING!! However some people could say that Eastenders is depressing and I don't deny it, it is pretty down in the dumps sometimes but it's better than NOTHING happening like in Corrie.

gp7qmHsMaa	Horror movie-maker kid's name is Cody Sheldon. Yes he is through to the next round. Towards the end of the episode you could see Cody celebrating with his group after they had all passed albeit from the back. He was shown wearing a red polo shirt. He's my favorite mostly because he comes from the Detroit area which is where I am from. He does have quite a good voice.    Unfortunately Michael Castro got cut in the group stage of Hollywood so he will not have the chance to repeat the success of Jason.|`|Fsr2Rofzaa	yes I think he's still on.

CFZ4ISNNaa	Ethan is a con artist and grifter. Luke caught him on the Haunted Star trying to rob the place.    His back story hasn't been revealed yet. Rumors are going around that he might be Dante...using a fake accent or he might be related to Jax, He might be Jerry's son, he might be Luke or Robert's kid by Holly..or Mac's long lost son...    I guess we can add that he might be little Mikey..out the coma...(Okay, I was reaching on that one!)     As of now...we just don't know... I did read that the casting of Dante was put on hold...so we may not see him for a while..|`|EhBF31evaa	I hadn't thought about the Holly/Luke/Robert angle, but that would be very interesting.|`|39cf945a4e570ec03e0673777fc1d801aa	I don't think he is Dante, it just doesn't fit; although, the writers are known for not getting things right.  I think he is either Luke's son (the man does get around) or someone who is connected to Luke somehow.  It is no accident that he was at the casino.|`|RogGEdyoaa	I hope he is related to Luke or  Robert Scorpio.|`|NGNeT3rYaa	That is what I am thinking too. He has to know Luke somehow why else would he show up there of all places. And know how to work him the way he did.|`|Y5jv0ybFaa	I hope  because maybe that would bring Holly back to town. I loved her....plus she would be connected to Luke....what if he is Luke's son and he doesn't know about it?|`|Hcc9fxqJaa	i have no idea what you are talking about|`|25d446cf62508e0d3ad669755f76bfb8aa	I was wondering the same thing! I have no idea at this point and haven't heard any spoilers, but Holly's son was the first thing that popped into my mind when he showed up.|`|VNum3TKyaa	I have no idea but he's Hot|`|M1ymLE9Paa	I love all the theories!  Especially about Holly and Robert.  Now that would be interesting!!  =)  Here's what I know about this character, so far:    New Cast Member  A new role has been cast on General Hospital debuting the week of January 26th. In the recurring role of Ethan will be Nathan Parsons. We will first see Ethan at the Haunted Star when he is caught breaking into the Haunted Star by Luke. Later on, Ethan thinks he has gotten away with some major grifting but Luke blindsides him at an out-of-town watering hole. Luke knows Ethan from his previous travels.    Ethan has an Australian accent, giving us hints he may be a Jax or Scorpio. OR, is he faking the accent, and in reality is Dante? (Didnt we have a RUMOR saying we might see Dante on Jan 26th?) Thats one RUMOR floating around this week. Whoever he is related to, we should eventually find out. Im also hearing Ethan MAY be the one who ultimately rescues Lulu. Plus, Luke COULD track Ethan down to offer him a job.|`|fIWwLRIMaa	there are rumors going around that ethan is either dante or frisco's son making him maxie's brother.|`|XRPtuwoTaa	Grifter Ethan Lovett is being played by Nathan Parsons. He could also be Sean Donnelly & Tiffany's son|`|h9O9k5wwaa	I heard he may be Fazions son (remember Fazion?) the guy who "killed" Anna and Robert?  Then I also heard he may be Robert's son too.  I guess we will find out eventually.

Fsr2Rofzaa	I like the OC better, I guess|`|feb7143192e9c7ccb1a8b16f5fcd9677aa	The Real housewives of Atlanta|`|Leda2ha0aa	From what I've read, Ne Ne was evicted (she said she moved out before being evicted) because she was behind on rent.  I found it a bit odd that she was renting her house and didn't own.   About the only person in Atlanta that had the career, was Lisa with her jewelry line.  One had a fashion line that crashed, one wants to be a singer and can't sing and the other two are trying to create charities.  I wouldn't call those careers.    I enjoy the housewives of NYC.  Season   2 for them will be starting soon.  I don't care about how much $ they have or what they own, it's more about their story lines.  That was the most enjoyable cast for me - NYC.|`|DnvysKlkaa	I loved the atlanta one..next would be orange county and new york was wack..|`|EY7xhPJnaa	OC is the best ... they are funny!! the other two just dont keep my attention that well!|`|bd023cea955952a6366f0a9965ea13caaa	Definitely OC. Just because I never got into ATL or NY. The women on NY are just repulsive. I don't care for many of the OC housewives but they are a million times better than those of NY. I do agree with the other person who posted that the NY women are "more money" and that is why I don't like them either. They are just rude, annoying, and I can't sit and watch it. The OC women can be bitches too, but I still love the show. Even though I cannot stand Tamra, Vicki, or Lynne, I still love the show. I saw one or two episodes of ATL, but I would have to say the OC housewives are more interesting.|`|70cb7d43b37cc2c7aeea03d81cdc272caa	Orange County is the best. Those ladies have it made! Sunshine all the time, nice cars, homes, the whole deal. New York is probably my least favorite. It's true what they say...money can't buy class!|`|9iS7lUrdaa	My favorite is the Real Housewives of O.C.   I got sucked in to Atlanta for all the drama but still didnt like the "characters" as much and I really dont like New York at all. Atlanta and New York act more "new money" if you know what I mean|`|12Nou1pvaa	I like the Atlanta housewives for the drama, the OC girls are kinda conceited, but i miss the Christian milf Quinn, my favorite, and the NY..I hate it, those women are hideous, don't care for it at all!!|`|ZsJbIJ3Eaa	I like the OC one the best, probably cuz I live here in CA and they are the most relateable and relevant to me.    The New York wives just never made sense to me. It's like they just grabbed a group of women and asked them to be friends. At least in OC and Atlanta many of the wives already had prior relationships with one another.|`|UsNgFI7haa	i like the oc girls and the atlanta girls i did not like the nyc girls at all|`|ztllWXy3aa	The Real Housewives of Atlanta

Besides acting, Chan is a Cantopop and Mandopop star, having released a number of albums and sung many of the theme songs for the films in which he has starred.

Chan is one of the best-known names worldwide in the areas of kung fu and action films.

Besides acting, Chan is a Cantopop and Mandopop star, having released a number of albums and sung many of the theme songs for the films in which he has starred. In 2008, Chan sang at the 2008 Summer Olympics closing ceremony  Chan was born in 1954 in Victoria Peak, Hong Kong (then a British Overseas Territory), as Chan Kong Sang (meaning "born in [Hong] Kong") to Charles and Lee-Lee Chan, refugees from the Chinese Civil War. He was nicknamed Pao Pao (Chinese: , literally meaning "Cannonball") because he was always rolling around as an infant.[3] Since his parents worked for the French Consul to Hong Kong, Chan spent his formative years within the grounds of the consul's residence in the Victoria Peak district.[4]    Chan attended the Nah-Hwa Primary School on Hong Kong Island, where he failed his first year, after which his parents withdrew him from the school. In 1960, his father emigrated to Canberra, Australia, to work as head cook for the American embassy, and Chan was sent to the China Drama Academy, a Peking Opera School run by Master Yu Jim Yuen.[4][5]    Chan trained rigorously for the next decade, excelling in martial arts and acrobatics.[6] He eventually joined the Seven Little Fortunes, a performance group made up of the school's best students, gaining the stage name Yuen Lo in homage to his master. Chan became close friends with fellow group members Sammo Hung and Yuen Biao, the three of them later to be known as the Three Brothers or Three Dragons  At the age of 8, he appeared with some of his fellow "Little Fortunes", in the film Big and Little Wong Tin Bar (1962), with Li Li Hua playing his mother. Chan appeared with Li again the following year, in The Love Eterne (1963) and had a small role in King Hu's 1966 film, Come Drink with Me. In 1971, after an appearance as an extra in another King Hu film, A Touch of Zen, Chan began his adult career in the film industry, initially signing to Chu Mu's Great Earth Film Company.[8] At the age of 17, he worked as a stuntman in the Bruce Lee films Fist of Fury and Enter the Dragon under the stage name Chen Yuen Long.[9] He received his first starring role later that year, in Little Tiger of Canton, which had a limited release in Hong Kong in 1973.[10]    After the commercial failures in his early ventures into films and trouble finding stunt work, Chan joined his parents in Canberra in 1976, where he briefly attended Dickson College and worked as a construction worker.[11] A fellow builder named Jack took Chan under his wing, earning Chan the nickname of "Little Jack" which was later shortened to "Jackie" and the name Jackie Chan stuck with him ever since.[12] In addition, Chan changed his Chinese name to Fong Si Lung, since his father's original surname was Fong    In 1976, Jackie Chan received a telegram from Willie Chan, a film producer in the Hong Kong film industry who had been impressed with Jackie's stuntwork. Willie Chan offered him an acting role in a film directed by Lo Wei. Lo had seen Chan's performance in the John Woo film Hand of Death (1976) and planned to model him after Bruce Lee with the film New Fist of Fury.[8] His stage name was changed to Cheng Long (Chinese: , literally "become the dragon") to emphasise his similarity to Bruce Lee, whose stage name was Lei Siu Lung (Chinese: , meaning "Little Dragon"). The film was unsuccessful because Chan was not accustomed to Lee's martial arts style. Despite the film's failure, Lo Wei continued producing films with similar themes, resulting in little improvement at the box office.[13]    Chan's first major breakthrough was the 1978 film Snake in the Eagle's Shadow, shot while he was loaned to Seasonal Film Corporation under a two-picture deal.[14] Under director Yuen Woo Ping, Chan was allowed complete freedom over his stunt work. The film established the comedic kung fu genre, and proved to be a breath of fresh air for the Hong Kong audience.[15] Chan then starred in Drunken Master, which finally propelled him to mainstream success.[16]    Upon Chan's return to Lo Wei's studio, Lo tried to replicate the comedic approach of Drunken Master, producing Half a Loaf of Kung Fu and Spiritual Kung Fu.[12] He also gave Chan the opportunity to co-direct The Fearless Hyena with|`|NQ1VG3TZaa	legends don't grow old

wA8Dyhq7aa	Very few GOOD country covers.  Ricky Van Shelton is notorious for doing bad versions of songs ("Statue of a Fool," "Life's Little Ups and Downs," "Life Turned Her That Way," "From a Jack to a King").    And please do NOT get me started on those atrocious butchers of great songs that Willie Nelson has subjected us to (e.g., "Blue Eyes Crying in the Rain," "City of New Orleans," "If You've Got the Money [I've Got the Time]").    Having complained, Patsy Cline's cover of "Sweet Dreams (of You)" (that's right, she was the THIRD person to have a hit with it) is good, as is her version of "San Antonio Rose."  Carl Smith did a good version of Bob Wills' "Deep Water."    And most of Emmylou Harris' entire career is covers.|`|AA10532334	I think Reba did a better cover than the original "Fancy" by Bobbie Gentry|`|LRvjfQyhaa	If you've ever heard the Del Shannon song called "Runaway", Gary Allan just released a cover of it.  I actually prefer his country version to the original oldies version.    Garth Brooks covered "Shameless" by Billy Joel.    Carrie Underwood also covered "I'll Stand By You" by The Pretenders.    Alan Jackson covered "Summertime Blues".  I think Eddie Cochran sang the original?    I'm sure there are a ton more that I just can't think of right now.|`|1UKAho1iaa	Alison Krauss's cover of "When You Say Nothing At All" by Keith Whitley.  Alan Jackson's cover of "Pop A Top" by Jim Ed Brown.  Alan Jackson's cover of "Who's Cheatin' Who" by Charley McLain.  Sherrie Austin's cover of "Jolene" by Dolly Parton.  Faith Hill's cover of "Piece of My Heart" by Janis Joplin.  Clint Black's cover of "Desperado" by the Eagles.  Jo Dee Messina's cover of "Lesson in Leavin'" by Dotty West.  Sawyer Brown's cover of "Six Days On The Road" by Dave Dudley.  Sawyer Brown's cover of "The Race Is On" by George Jones.  Blake Shelton's cover of "Goodbye Time" by Conway Twitty.  Billy Currington's cover of "Lucille" by Kenny Rogers.|`|zZxX5PXBaa	Tennessee Waltz ... there are loads of covers of it, but two really good fairly recent ones, very different from each other, are by ...

Which was done by Roger Miller.   Patty Loveless just released an entire cd of golden covers and did an excellent job on all.

Prankster puts fake ad in RGJ  Cute kitten with two heads lives only in Californians imagination  Don Cox   RENO GAZETTE-JOURNAL  9/7/2005 11:37 pm                       The absolutely adorable kitten with two heads lives, apparently, only in the somewhat bizarre imagination of a Southern California man who identified himself Tuesday as Rory Emerald, the serial prankster.    People dont want to believe its not real, Emerald said by telephone. They want to believe a two-headed cat exists.    On paper it does, or did. The classified advertisement in the Reno Gazette-Journal said:    KITTEN: Unique kitten with two heads, absolutely adorable, found N. Reno area.    No such kitten was found in north Reno or anyplace else. It was all just a joke, according to Emerald, who said he lives in Anaheim, Calif., and puts false advertisements in newspapers across the country for laughs.    This time he picked Reno.    It was a friendly hoax, said Emerald, who described himself as a 38-year-old stay-at-home father who enjoys being funny in print.    The seven-day ad, which appeared for the last time Wednesday, was placed for free in the found pets column of the Gazette-Journals classified section. It started running Sept. 1.    I knew I wanted to do something in the Reno paper, Emerald said. I dont really know why. Something told me to do it in the Reno paper. It turned out to be a good thing.    A cat with two heads, apparently, attracted attention.    Calls from across state    I have been getting so many calls from Reno and all over Nevada, said Emerald, who included his home telephone number in the ad. I would say its definitely up to 50.    Emerald said he didnt talk to everyone who answered his ad.    I was away for the weekend, Emerald said. There were a lot of calls from my (answering) service. I turned the phone off. I even got some calls at 1 or 2 oclock in the morning.    Sometimes, said Kathleen Colombo, Gazette-Journal classified sales manager, its hard to tell truth from hoax, especially when someone is placing an ad by phone. All you hear is a voice.    The hardest part is if you get somebody very convincing, Colombo said. You cant check the body language.    Since June, Emerald has become famous, at least on the Internet, for his fake ads. There are Web stories about hoax classified ads from Emerald in newspapers in North Dakota, Texas and Montana.    One of those ads said Elvis Presleys tour bus had been found near Fargo, N.D., with many personal items from the dead rock n roll legend. Another ad said ancient Egyptian artifacts had been discovered in the hills near Missoula, Mont.    Emerald said he started the pranks during the Michael Jackson trial this year when he placed an ad in a California newspaper saying a prosthetic nose was discovered near Jacksons ranch near Santa Barbara, Calif.    Im trying to keep the ads funny, Emerald said.    Sometimes, apparently, the laughter dies.    Arrested in Beverly Hills    Emerald said he spent about five months in a Los Angeles jail several years ago when he was arrested for theft in a Beverly Hills store while posing as the personal shopper for actress Mia Farrow.    Yes, that happened, Emerald said. I remember getting arrested.    The pranks, at least the ones in newspapers, will continue, according to Emerald.    Im going to keep doing it until I cant find anything interesting or fun to put in the paper, he said. A bunch of things came to me (Monday) night.    But its hard to tell with Emerald, whose name is a question. He legally changed it to Emerald from Julian Lee Hobbs, so he says.

Both Rutger Hauer's and Sean Young's characters were androids.  But no huge man with a tape recorder on his chest and no medals given out in the end, and technically there is a difference between robots and androids, I don't think he would have described Rutger Hauer and Sean Young as robots.|`|3hbCRIPQaa	Must be Star Wars  No bra = Carrie Fisher  Large dog = Chewbacca  Got crushed = Garbage disposal after jailbreak  Tape recorder = Darth Vader|`|lKwZhYBVaa	Star Wars.|`|f022046714d743300a49a71ca2c26286aa	Bladerunner.

Notice 1994: deadly ratiation  1969 Not problem with any radiation at all,  then space technology has gone backwards!

A greatest hits record will be released (which won't sell) and that will be it. She will never again follow Jermaine Dupri. I think there relationship is on the rocks anyway. Every man she has been serious with has always been involved in her career. Now that he messed up her career by taking control, she is not going to follow him any where. And must I add, he made her career even more whack by arranging her vocal, and putting them to those whack a$$ beats!!!|`|AA12376727	didn't know she was on a timer,oh boy,she will be surprised when that bell goes...lol|`|AA10325554	yes all of them need to step aside and let newer younger singers in the spotlight|`|2bd735ee0402fc3551d2d75a162b03a1aa	Yes, I feel her time is and has been up.|`|c88cd516c8b89b494448bba62584118aaa	I know right...I mean, I believe Cher out done her with her latest albums.  Cher can still pull it off.  But Janet's missing something and I can't quite figure it out what it is.|`|ca27b7f3591b6a841f37f697b88d5f52aa	Her time was up long ago. She needs to have someone help her write some decent songs, her songs all sound so much alike, maybe she should change her style of music.|`|6e8e2b63bf40a2e84096ca18b3ba3678aa	Yup I think so.  Time for some new material Janet!!!|`|9b83ba9d5a0174bae58e7035f22ad324aa	Don't hate on Janet she is just doing he than as an artist that has the ever lasting love for music. Regardless of weather you are not feeling her other are.|`|949a8923409e34dc55c3801adcc854e7aa	She's not feeling herself either...I think that she's let the slogan "Sex Sells" overshadow her musical endeavors, and even though her newest bf JD is an incredible producer, he still can't seem to get her on the right track. It's really a shame that JJ has let it come to this but that's the way the ball bounces I guess...

FDt7cC8haa	Legally, no...it has nothing to do with charging money....a 'group' screening of any movie, 'legally' requires written permission from the copyright holder....There are many people that do not obtain permission, and I have never met one that ever got caught    see people.... that right to view ,because you own it,....does not apply to , let's say....an entire city....There are definitions about the what is considered a viewable audience.....You need to purchase something called public viewing rights....      http://www.uaa.alaska.edu/clubs/upload/P...|`|zhk8o514aa	I think the quality would be crappy.  If you can try to find the film and have them run it that way.|`|pWA3gybAaa	sure it would probably be expensive to rent out for a private showing, and how would you show the DVD on the screen anyway|`|Xtqq71KGaa	i don't see why not.  you're just renting the theatre's equipment to play a DVD you already own the right to play.|`|1e6eca30bdd2eb772df216bfd70b9ca4aa	Movie theatres do rent out their rooms, and do have specials for birthday parties * i used to work at one*, but they use film reels to show movies. Not dvd players.|`|bO9p8Kxdaa	They would never let you for liability reasons.  You could put up a big screen i.e.-a large sheet, or large tarp or canvas in your backyard and show it on that.  Some party venues you can rent for the day will let you set up for it & they sometimes have screens already.  If you are a member of a large church they usually have audio/visual equipment ready to go. That depends on, of course, the type of film you want to show|`|g3MiFQNTaa	no but it would be expensive by getting your own screen and all but not illegal

Can you say lypo?|`|MwOqzgJbaa	none. none of them.  Cam Gigandet comes close.  but, falls short.    RPattz can't be beat.  he's a beauty. for suree.    Jackson Rathbone's a hottie, too.      i think that some of the reason that people think he is so gorgeous is that they see him as the ever-so-charming Edward Cullen.  that has definatly helped his image.  but, he's hott either way.|`|0QbAiQwhaa	threre are better movies which better actors...|`|nJtJvL7Naa	Honestly, girl! A TON OF GUYS!!!!!!!!!  Here are a few of my (weird) favorites.  1. Tom Sturridge.  Really, the boy should have played Edward.  2. Tom Felton (draco malfoy from hp). Blond, grey eyes, bad boy...need I say more?  3. Matt Damon.  4. Ben Affleck.|`|0daa20e9459e101c67ff5134a4981eb5aa	Robert Pattinson is certainly stunning. But so is Christian Bale.    No, wait, I know my answer. Jack Nicholson. He's the man. His eyebrows alone send me swooning.|`|bPXlYHlDaa	Um I love Rpattz but Chace Crawford from Gossip Girl is sooooo much hotter!

2fa9eb09ca4139ebc5dd62f427ef986caa	It's a really tough call, LOL =] There are seriously, so many contestants that I like, that I can't even keep track! I love Danny Gockey as well, but one of my top favs is ADAM LAMBERT! Damn, he has crazy vocal skills! Watching him perform durring the group round was amazing! I was literally watching him with my jaw on the floor! I think he has a really unique voice, and I've NEVER heard anyone on the show sing like that.     I can't quite remember who Joanna Pacitti is, but I probably like her... cause her name sounds familiar =]|`|yWIIHCMDaa	My favorites are, Danny Gokey, Adam Lambert, Von Smith(I know...), Lil Rounds and Jazmine Murray|`|6YZ74lEOaa	How should we know??? The show has just barely started and there are no hot picks yet!|`|J4TjChXIaa	So far I really like Adam Lambert,he's got an amazing voice.And I like Nate Marshall he's pretty good,but my favorite is Adam.He will for sure make it really far.

Si te gusta la msica de verdad, encontraras ms satisfacin buscndola, eligiendo t mismo. El avanico de posibilidades es enorme, NO TE CONFORMES|`|3af4f0a71a6943ac9413695b80227d83aa	Para gustos se hicieron los colores.  Tiene un estilo muy parecido a los cantantes latinos... tiene una buena voz, hay que reconocerlo.  No he escuchado su ultimo cd, pq nunca mhe comprado nada de Bisbal.  Creo que lo taladran demasiado, y eso en parte ayuda a que la gente que nos es indiferente,acabemos aborreciendolo.  Sobre el look...pues mira, ya no es si lleve el pelo asi o asa..es un chaval que tiene mucho carisma, y bueno...ahora gustar ms o menos.  Pero lo importante de un artista..(presumiblemente el lo es?)no es solo la imagen.    Decididamente, cuando David Bisbal deje de interpretar siempre el mismo tipo de canciones, quiza a la gente que ms o menos nos gusta la msica empecemos a plantearnos comprarnos un disco suyo.  Es que claro...alguien que vende la imagen que su estilo y msica va dirigida a jovencitas...pues claro..yo ya tengo una edad y no me encuentro en ese tipo de pblico.  Gozo ms con la msica de Antonio vega, i no es precisamente un sex-simbol.

A mi no me caen mal para nada, la verdad creo que la mayora que se expresa mal de ustedes es porque todava en su peque?o y limitado cerebro, no les deja o no les permite ver ms all de sus narices, adems de que son muy persinados, pero es hipocresa, y como todava hay machismo y claro, no todos son muy open mind, pero ya vers que despus ni quien les diga nada. Esas personas, sobre todos los hombres machos, tienen una preferencia sexual deprimida, por eso dicen que los odian, pero es eso nada ms.  T no hagas caso de lo que digan, ni te sientas mal, yo creo que a odos sordos, palabras necias. Y hay que tomar las cosas de quien vienen. Yo tengo amigos gays y no me averguenzo, al contrario, los admiro tanto a gays, lesvianas y bisexuales, por el simple hecho de aceptar que son como son, eso es realmente lo que cuenta, no el que dirn ok.|`|a9596840dc082c381dc6c78a5d6a7796aa	quiza por que no estamos acostumbrados.

Tengo muchos familiares que son gays, incluso tengo un amigo que es bisexual, me cae genial, por el momento no est cerca pero no dejamos de comunicarnos.    No hay nada en contra de esa preferencia sexual, siguen siendo iguales a nosotros, slo que con diferentes gustos, como todas las dems personas lo somos. Mientras nos respetemos unos a otros no hay problema.    Eso s, si una lesbiana se me insinua despus de que le dije que era heterosexual, ya es falta de respeto y acoso. =P Aguas.    Saludos!|`|447ac00dc867045fbfcf1c6b6c9e8608aa	a mi no me caen mal ^_^ ... digamos que soy una persona de mentalidad muy abierta, dos de mis mejores amigas son lesbianas y eso no quiere decir que yo sea lesbiana... creo que mucha gente que es homofobica es porque ellos mismos dudan de su sexualidad o simplemente no pueden aceptar que hay gente que es distinta a ellos|`|5ee2ef71d34046e34f353fecfdb8fa02aa	Porque van en contra de la naturaleza|`|4b473a2a370a543eebfcac97ca926d3daa	Pues en mi caso no es que me caigan mal todos, pero la verdad algunos se sobrepasan, por ejemplo cuando yo iva en prepa, le estaba contando al oido a mi amigo acerca de una chava que me gustaba (para que nadie se enterara), en eso se acerco un gay y me dio una cachetada porque segun yo estaba burlandome de el, todos mis cuates se burlaron de mi y como estabamos en el patio principal pues media escuela tambien me agarro de baje, en esa ocasion me aguante las ganas de pegarle ya que no me quera ganar una expulsin. En otra ocasion un par de gays me mandaban besos cuando yo iva caminando por la calle, hasta que se acercaron y me dieron una nalgada, no pude contenerme y me los son con un golpe a uno en la mandbula y a otro en la nariz, yo tampoco me meto con nadie si nadie se mete conmigo, tambien hay que ver que existe de todo.|`|4caee8e43b90197b99afb5288315a066aa	PARA NADA!!!!! Los Gays son como cualquiera. Lo que pienso es que debe haber respeto hacia las personas. Yo no voy diciendo por las calles "SOY HETERO", entonces, tampoco hay necesidad de que vayan gritando que son gays y todos felices No?  Por otro lado, me caen super bien las "locas", porque siempre buscan atraer las miradas x qsi no no serian exhibicionistas No crees?, por lo menos asi son los que yo conosco.

En mi punto de vista hay 2 tipos de gay. esta el gay moderado (del cual no tendria problema alguno de ser amigo) el cual es y reconoce que es gay pero no necesariamente se vista como tal y sobre todo que respete y sepa diferenciar entre un amigo (hombre) y una potencial pareja. y por otro lado estan los otros gays que se visten de mujer y tienen actos femeninos muy exagerados a esos prefiero mirarlos pasar, porque solo estan degradandose como moralmente,  Pero tu pareces buen muchacho solo trata de no ser tan gay como para querer hacerte operaciones ni nada de eso, y diferencia bien entre los hombres que pudieran ser amigos y los que pudieras tener una relacion|`|90abf1a292fc179102067c56004a8a02aa	no ami m da= lo k agan con su cu-lo y lo demas de su cuerpo(no es cierto)no te blokees y digas k odiamos a los gays, ami me acaen bien como cualquier otra persona, puede ser agradable o no el ser gay no te resta ni te suma puntos para tener una amistad sincera. yo tengo un amigo bi y neta estaba clavadisima con el y un dia nos precento a su novio...y le segui ablando y me di cuenta k slo mejor de el es incre.solo aceptate y trata de k las demas personas te acepten las k lo agan son las k de verdad valen la pena!!!|`|792e361521aa281c6c32b282f849af26aa	A m no me caen mal ni gays, ni lesbianas, ni nadie por su preferencia sexual, te pueden caer mal las personas, porque son mala onda o algo, pero en lo personal no por eso.|`|4e75d3135d7ad22a0eb99eb24e54b036aa	No todos somos asi, cada quien tiene su forma de pensar, pero a mi no me caen mal, todos somos personas independientemente de nuestras preferencias y yo no me meto ni los juzgo, asi que no todos pensamos igual.|`|0e626522c91fb9b81382bb539ca90c40aa	vivimos en un mundo ipocrita, donde se supone que nadie odia a los ****** y cuando ve a alguno curza la calle porque cree que le va a robar. Cuando la gente habla sobre los gays pasa lo mismo, en la teoria dicen que los aceptan, pero en el momento en que los ven, dicen que les da asco.  Vivimos en un mundo muy superficial, donde nadie se pone en el lugar del otro, si no, trata de estar por encima del otro. los gays es algo de siempre, simplemente que antes se tapaba mucho mas. Ahora, que creemos ser mas liberales... somos la misma mierda que antes, con los mismos prejuicios. La gente nunca se detiene a pensar antes de hablar. Es cierto que culturalmente no estamos acostumbrados... pero ya es tiempo de ver mas alla, de empezar a comprender y de abrir un poco mas nuestras mentes, sin mortificar a nadie, ni juzgar a nadie por deciciones personales. Me gustaria que cada uno se ocupe mas de su vida que de la vida de los demas. Y con respecto al que escribio la pregunta, te digo: mucha fuerza, y no escuches las pabadas que dice la gente... solamente vos, sabes quien sos y lo importante es que tambien lo sepa la gente que te rodea...

El ser machista es diferente, va contra la naturaleza ser GAY, estoy de acuerdo que son personas pero si se ponen a leer un poco la mayoria de las enfermedades sexuales es por los gays, desgraciadamente nuestra sociedad es asi, esta de moda ser gay y todos quieren serlo, porque en la antiguedad era menos la cantidad de gays. Hay gays por enfermedad, agarren un libro de medicina y lean pero la mayoria es por gusto|`|62f1d0bd3f242d306e51d5c100b24ddbaa	Lo que me cae mal de ellos es que muchas veces me han tratado de ligar, eso lo detesto y ms por las miradas que hechan, creo que as se sienten las mujeres cuando son acosadas por hombres, aunque ya al explicarles que soy heterosexual comprenden. (aunque a veces no)    otra cosa es que son muy superficiales (la mayoria, no todos) y prefieren la moda, la belleza, el glamour, y dems cosas vanales, adems de que son muy criticones.    a muchos les da por usar prendas muy estrafalarias y maquillaje y andar joteando de lo lindo por la calle, eso a veces es chistoso, pero cuando se andan besuqueando con otro no es agradable, por lo menos para mi|`|54e42bcf5817234ae4e2fa38a3d6d14aaa	no pues a mi en lo particular los gay no me caen mal tengo un amigo gay y un primo son muy lindos, pero a los hombres pues si les caen mal ya que son unos machos y piensan que con conversar con ustedes sus amigos piensan que ya por eso les gust el arroz con popote., bueno eso dicen los machos., pero la verdad no les hagan caso esto de ser gay no es un pecado., se fe liz disfruta de lo que hagas y no te fijes si la gente te ve raro si no comes de la gente vale., bye|`|db45e69fb7d7213af60ee8f247d7f9f3aa	No generalices!!!Hay personas que si tienen conciencia, y no son homofobicos (ejemplo yo haha xD) No soy homofobica, y bueno, pienso que eso se puede dar en CUALQUIER persona (No digo que tu seas "cualquiera" eeeh!!!) Pero eso no lo decide cada quien, nadie decide YO QUIERO SER GAY, o YO QUIERO SER LESBIANA, haha, eso bueno, cada quien nace con eso...SUPONGO!!!La verdad no se haha solo doy mi punto de vista!!!Y bueno, yo tengo un amigo que es gay, y LO AMOOOO!!!El es genial, super divertido, etc!!!Creo que los gays son mejores personas que cualquiera!!! hahaha    ShaiTo!!! ;)|`|d6772ac0590b2edfc265cff76f9bdcc5aa	No s, quiza an vivimos en una cultura muy cerrada en donde nos aferramos mucho a lo que la religin catlica impone y son paradigmas que sigue la sociedad, sin embargo, yo pienso que los gays son personas anta todo y que merecen todo el respeto del mundo (viste lo del matrimonio gay ayer en Espa?a?).    He tenido amigos gays y sinceramente pienso que son las personas mas dulces y los mejores amigos que pueden existir en la tierra (eso generalizando). Y no te sientas mal por lo que los dems piensen, alla ellos.

VxozKUcCaa	Fill a simple cardboard box with popcorn foam firmly, place the egg itself in a 6-pack carton buried within the middle of the popcorn foam and then seal the box with duct tape.  It is not as difficult as they make it sound.  The popcorn foam will absorb the impact and the egg carton with keep the egg stable for the fall itself.|`|foXWUdJ5aa	The container has a semi-solid jello mix in it? hmmmmmm there's always room for jello    You said no modifying the egg, but you didn't say anything about the container.

uUzbqGh5aa	No she's still "pure"! The excuse will be that she was "drunk" and didn't know what she was doing, boo hoo!! Never mind she was talking coherently and SHE actually leaned in for the kiss while Billy sat in his chair, but all's well, the "halo" will still be intact for some!<br>  I'm not buying the whole "she's going off the deep end" crap, that's just more excuses for "lil ole misunderstood, in need of love, I can do no wrong Sharon!!|`|qAoM2Jp5aa	Yeah, I'm pretty disappointed in her for this.  Its just wrong!|`|AA11111233	You know what, that's just SharHo for you.  She gets more drunk than she knows what she's doing, and then sleeps with someone as a result because she was lonely, hurt and confused (but in this case, I'll add "she's having a meltdown" to the mix.  Then she'll turn around and point the finger at Jack for lying to her and keeping secrets, and Nick for leaving her lonely and going back to "Phylthy," Phyllust" or whatever derogatory character names Shickies have for Phyllis.  Why the hell doesn't Sharon just take responsibility for her own actions instead of making excuses as if she's some angel.  Makes me bloody sick.|`|b95adf9df97c91be72d1af840c313197aa	An answer I saw last week about her states it all-- sleeping with your ex and brother in law, while still being married (hope Jack nails her a$$ in divorce for adultery)---- Sharon has more nut in her than a snickers bar<br>  <br>  because thinking about it, isn't Billy just a few years older than sharon's own precious Noah (and how lond befor ehe knocks up Eden?!?!)|`|msUIsv8maa	Ill Bet shes having a Ball O well must be fun|`|6c30b5116a79d741042462d73fcdf99aaa	I so agree with Sharon Abbott Must die and jus Jaz....they both have great answers!|`|nndflDc9aa	I feel very bad for poor Jack and how Billy will not be able to look up in to is brother eyes  ouch and is all Sharon fault.

Cant wait for Jack & Nick to see who she really is.|`|h2f7SjOvaa	Billy's hot, little drink in the mix and it would be on.Jack was to old for her,just like Phillis with Nick.Jack got what was coming to him.And Billy would of took any chic hme.Sharon feels rejected.I wonder if shes gonna remember what happend.If so then hope Chloe finds out!|`|ow1m3c8jaa	Oh don't worry to all of the "precious" Sharon fans; she'll still be an angel apparently from now till eternity no matter what she does.|`|r7sgshwKaa	I told you guys before....she has more nut in her than a snicker bar! They should nickname her "door knob" because everybody gets a turn.When she dies they will probably have to put her cooch in a Hazmat bag! Pee-u!|`|qPCXsXfNaa	I don't get the stealing either.

MCOoYeE1aa	Cuando Virgo ms sondea la personalidad misteriosa de Escorpio, ms sorpresas se encuentra. Pero la muestra de confianza de Escorpio hace desaparecer las ansiedades de Virgo. Adems, Escorpio puede despertar en Virgo desvaros inesperados de intensidad emocional, especialmente en la intimidad. Estos dos signos tienen mucho que aprender uno del otro. Pueden observar, comprender y respetar recprocamente los aspectos personales de cada cual: uno prefiere el misterio y el otro se dedica a los negocios. Escorpio, profundamente celoso, encontrar que Virgo es siempre leal y fiel.           aunque tambien depende de los dos no solo de su compatibilidad astronomica    saludos|`|aW0XA3B1aa	AMOR  Entre los elementos tierra de Virgo y el agua de Escorpio, hay una compenetracin que estimula sus relaciones amorosas. Ambos se encuentran en armona siempre que Escorpio sepa dominar su agresividad. Virgo aporta a la unin seguridad e intercambio intelectual, y Escorpio dar a Virgo la fuerza necesaria para realizarse en sus proyectos. Al ser estos aspectos muy generales, sera preciso comprobar en sus Cartas Astrales qu elementos tienen en comn y cuales estn en desacuerdo. Por lo habitual suelen permanecer muchos a?os juntos.    SEXO  Si bien no existe ninguna contradiccin para que ambos puedan tener relaciones muy satisfactorias, puede surgir que debido al temperamento fro de Virgo, haya ciertas insatisfacciones sexuales en Escorpio. Si ambos se encuentra bien juntos, podrn llevar una vida sexual plena y llena de variedad.     AMISTAD  Suelen hacerse amigos sin muchas dificultades. Se compenetran y realizan actividades juntos, y lo ms probable es que destaquen en investigaciones, ya sean estas dentro de la ciencia, el arte, etc. La fidelidad les acompa?a en sus empresas y tendran xito su pudieran montar un negocio privado.|`|5b1d604fa7114cdb7a4b93350eb4cfddaa	Los signos zodiacales no tienen ninguna influencia en nuestra manera de ser, ni en lo que nos ocurrir.|`|AA11481777	mira en el horoscop de yahoo, ahy aparece :)    ni?as y mujeres del planeta, me colaboran, por fa?  http://es.answers.yahoo.com/question/ind...|`|9c1c58591b54b915f9fa4a32a19a748aaa	Te parece que necesitas a los astros para conocer a una persona?

Les encanta la solidez econmica y tienden a tener los pies sobre la tierra. Aunque a ESCORPIO le molestan las crticas de VIRGO, las respuestas de ESCORPIO no son nada fciles y a la hora de medir la lengua la de ESCORPIO  puede ser terrible, llena de sarcasmos, ironas y palabras que harn pensar dos veces a VIRGO antes de atacar. Habr atraccin y amistad entre ellos, les unirn una buena complicidad, pero la intensidad y fuerza de ESCORPIO puede dejar consumido a VIRGO que es ms modosito y racional. Sois muy diferentes. A VIRGO le encantan los mimos y ESCORPIO puede ser demasiado directa para su gusto.  ESCORPIO con el tiempo se cansar de alguien tan comedido y con tanto miedo a entregarse en profundidad para no sufrir, VIRGO deber demostrarle pasin y decisin o cuando reaccione ser demasiado tarde. Es probable que establezcan una amistad muy intima, y que sigais siendo amigos siempre.|`|3c679b05ccc463678b99b11bf61bdaebaa	PREGUNTA:  holap como seria una relacion entre una virgo y un escorpio?????????

Las relaciones que funcionan mejor son aquellas en las que los  participantes se concentran en auto-quererse mucho y luego comparten ese amor con la otra persona.    Los signos guan, pero no obligan.    Mucha suerte y felicidades!!!!

Comunicacin, mucha comunicacin!!!    xitos!!!|`|CBye7RwFaa	Si eres Virgo y tu pareja es Escorpio   Formaris una combinacin maravillosa en la faceta fsica, ya que la sexualidad propia de Escorpio, capaz de adivinar cualquier secreto que mantengas escondido, har que el poder sexual que intentas ocultar salga a la superficie y te otorgue confianza e iniciativa en el campo de los juegos amorosos. Pero como en la vida no todo es estar entre las sbanas, os daris cuenta de que tambin funcionis como pareja fuera de la cama. La tpica naturaleza protectora, fuerte y valerosa de Escorpio, conseguir que dejes tus constantes precauciones un poco de lado. Para ti los secretos de Escorpio no tienen misterio y en lugar de atemorizarte por su halo misterioso, lo que haces es estar completamente fascinado. T debers intentar controlar tus continuos reproches y Escorpio sus celos, para que a ninguno de los dos se os escapen crueles palabras que lo nico que harn es causaros un terrible da?o.|`|EmBrEN6uaa	Yo creo que dolorosa y al principio muy muy dolorosa!!!|`|a2c8bbb24610178840fdeb550558efe6aa	Mujer Virgo       Y         Hombre Escorpio    Por naturaleza ambos son almas perspicaces y precavidas. A ninguno le gusta dejar al descubierto su corazn. Existe entre los dos una comprensin "sin palabras", es decir que pueden lograr una profunda empata. Virgo, signo de tierra, puede ayudar a incrementar la objetividad de Escorpio sobre todo en asuntos emocionales y la acuosidad de Escorpio ayuda a que Virgo pueda abrirse y expresar sus sentimientos ms profundos.     Los dos aprecian la privacidad y necesitan que se los respete tanto como que se los ame. Les gusta mucho analizar profundamente sus intereses y les fascina poder considerar a cada una de sus cosas como "revisadas a fondo".     Virgo a veces se siente "invadida" por la intensidad de Escorpio y la claridad virginiana puede hacer sentir a Escorpio que su pasin est siendo demasiado "racionalizada". An as, estos puntos irritantes pueden ser justamente la fuente de donde puedan aprender a expandir ms sus respectivas personalidades.     Ustedes son profundos y muy serios, gente "pensante" a quienes les aburre la superficialidad, que repelen la hipocresa y les preocupa vivir con tanta calidad como les sea posible alcanzar. En tanto puedan respetar sus respectivas reas vulnerables, van a poder gozar de lo mximo de esta prspera combinacin...
Qlyh3pG0aa	Honey I shrunk the kids or sumthing along dose lines haha|`|XeR3oN0aaa	I am pretty sure the movie you are describing is called 'Honey I shrunk the kids' (I think).  If you go to DIsney they do this spin off called 'Honey I shrunk the Audience' in this 4D cinema which is kind of cool.  Think that is the right movie.  Enjoy!|`|ZfWMnvW7aa	honey i shrunk the kids.... i think the part you are talking about is part 1, part 2 is about when the baby goes huge|`|FF9mMlgKaa	Jeeze it's Honey I Shrunk the Kids|`|UMcfklnJaa	Honey I Shrunk the Kids, the first part|`|lJZNGsZCaa	Honey I shrunk the Kids, there is a sequel as well, go to Amazon or Play.com for the dvd|`|xhxnvPczaa	it is definitely called 'honey i shrunk the kids' go to blockbuster or something|`|nfacxGq4aa	Yuppers..

zhrGiQsKaa	Britney Spears. I would love to live and see the drama in her life. she is one of the most famous women in the world. But i would never want to live her life, she can't even take her kids to the store or park like a normal person or an ordinary celeb, because she will be mobbed by photographers.|`|TxvIoWVGaa	I would definitley pick Blake livley. She is gorgeous, smart, and all the hollywood-stuff hasn't gone to her head yet. She seems grounded. On the set of Gossip Girl, she gets to wear the COOLEST things..all the newest Chanel, Marc Jacobs, and tons of awesome things. And she gets to take them home sometimes!  Her boyfriend Penn badgely (her co-star, Dan) is so hot and I love him...he's my favorite Celebrity crush. i know that is so Cliche' but it's true!    Since she's so famous she gets to go to all the parties. i would love to go to one and get all the free goodies they give out and stuff, and meet all the other stars.    I love New York, it's such a gorgeous and interesting city. She's so lucky to live there and film her number 1 show there probably in a giant penthouse suite.    My second choice would be Taylor Swift. Shes so pretty and I would love to sing for a living.    Hope you like my answer :-) K peace Aqua |`|6YZ74lEOaa	If I could be any celebrity for a day it would have to be Taylor Swift because she is so pretty and she has a great voice!|`|Mv51CBoNaa	I would be conan.    aahaha|`|cRhkkBAEaa	I would probably be Akon actually at the minute coz he's singing with Michael Jackson and helping MJ make his new album.    Lucky lucky Akon.....    Of course, from 1994-1996 I would have liked to be Lisa Presley coz she was married to MJ.     But then, before that, around the mis 80s, I would have liked to be Brooke Shields, also around 1993-ish coz she was his girlfriend at those times.     Also, I suppose I would like to be Janet Jackson coz she's his sister.     But then Elizabeth Taylor was extremely lucky too, what with being his best friend......    And then there's Slash and Quincy Jones and Lionel Richie and Stevie Wonder and Diana Ross and all those lucky lucky people that got to meet him.......
t2KJijUpaa	Well.. nobody knows but this week she tells stacey, and ronnie is supposed to go to the clinic with her again but after telling dot everything dot advices her not to go with her as it is bringing back bad memories. So she cancels and this upsets danielle..  I thought it was mothers day all will be revealed but it looks like it wont be . As i have seen pictures of the wedding preview which will screen in april and ronnie is bridesmaid. i doubt she would be if she knew danielle was her daughter after all Archie told her shes dead, although she could be just out to ruin his wedding day  Its drivin me mad. top be honest in kind of worried that eastenders will never reveal i hope they do otherwise i will be very disappoionted|`|Jaw2sW3eaa	Soon I hope.|`|nDAnSuVBaa	Yah I keep shouting at the tv :/|`|2flqUgcDaa	ohhhh that is a good one.

h1IYS0dbaa	Dear Frankie|`|AA11110732	Its "Dear Frankie", but the dad isn't dead, she left him because he was abusive.|`|qailzSVBaa	Dear Frankie is the movie I think you are looking for.|`|SdTQVUaKaa	Dear Frankie    The beautiful princess is trapped by the evils in her past, she is icy, almost dead to anything but the need to keep the truth from Frankie, her 9 year old son. But Frankie is smart and resourceful and will save her, as well as any son in a storybook. This is a beautiful film, a fantasy with a stark and realistic background, which can also take your breath away with wonder, as one of the characters comments for herself. The synopsis does not do justice to the stately and beguiling way this tale is told - the shocks and surprises are never gratuitous and the happy ever after ...? Well, that would be telling. Emily Mortimer conveys the paralysis of fear and yearning without any showiness, the spare and well-crafted dialogue tells us a little less than we would like to know, but the suspense is not unpleasant. The supporting players have colour and substance and the man who agrees play the part of Frankie's dad, is portrayed with heart-breaking restraint by Gerard Butler, who after his showier role in 'Phantom of the Opera' demonstrates that his has real and effective range. But the boy is a wonder of subtlety and sincerity. A lovely film

3OzlPPfiaa	Obviously the shining stars of that performance were the family of 5, which the boy was the only one who was any good, followed by the mother as well.  Secondly the old lady was a very good singer indeed, but lacked any charisma or character and came across as a complete cretin to society, but extremely talented- which is the main part of the show i guess- but i cant imagine her selling any cd's of merchandise.  Thirdly the dance group, now that was aesthetically beautiful, i mean teh cliche "jaw-dropping" is only really meant to be applied to such talent acts as this. The only thing that makes me think they may not win is that they have not really got a front man, so that might make it hard for them to get votes- but with those dances- they should have no problem.  In Order- Dancers, Crazy Lady, The Boy and Women from "Lil Jackson five". Lol.|`|7NZLyivaaa	Flawless were brilliant!!!  The best act was the middle-aged woman who sang. The audience may have laughed at her at first but she'll be laughing all the way to the bank now. What a voice!|`|xE6nrLbfaa	It was the best nights TV we have watched for ages.  We also watched the ITV 2 show with Steven Mulherne.  We laughed so much at both programs.  The lady that sang who wanted to be the new Elaine Paige was so good I actually had tears come into my eyes (that for me, never happens)  The Greek father and son act cracked us up, we watched it over again.  The Flawless dancers were superb, too.  I can't wait for next week to see what other gems we get to see.  Don't forget to watch the following ITV 2 show also.  I think when X Factor starts, get rid of O'Leary, he is rubbish and has no personality at all, put Steven Mulherne in there.|`|y0QwpYCaaa	that old women was a total shock i never thought she would sing like that,amazing.Flawless were really good.agree about that kid he was like a young micheal jackson,shame his parents couldn't sing well.

AA10289523	Now lets look at The Power of the Silver Age Super man   ?Super strength he could move Entire Planets  ?Super speed Faster than Light Speed could also time travel  ?Invunanerble to anything except Kryptonight or Magic  ?With his Vast Powers he could fly across the Unverse without Air  ?Super Cold Breath he could Freeze you like an Ice Cube  ?Heat Vision Could Burn you to ash  ?Superman was also able to survive without air, water, or food  ?X-ray vision  ?Telescopic vision  ?Super hearing  ?Superman possessed genius-level intelligence and an eidetic memory.   ?Super-ventriloquism   ?Super-hypnosis  ?Superman could throw his voice across great distances  ?    with all these Powers Combined Goku wouldnt Stand a Chance|`|vqg6wpCLaa	Goku - according to your list, it would seem as Goku would be stronger. He has more pros than Superman does and would be most likely to win in that fight. Actually, he could easily beat Superman.|`|3N2ElzcQaa	Goku    He has it all|`|btFSgJmlaa	http://electricferret.com/battle/cbub_ca...|`|MZFIJf1zaa	Goku|`|JgCGpQaxaa	WTF.  Superman wins this easily.    Honestly, Zoe, you have to forgive many of my compatriots.  They are all anime-tards (such as myself), but don't have an inkling of understanding about the comic book universe.  So even though you say "Silver Age Superman," everyone else here is thinking of Supes from the Superman Returns.  This BS is akin to looking at Goku as a child at the beginning of DB- instead of DBZ SSJ3.      Oh, and Zoe, you yourself have left out quite a few of Superman's powers (if you are in fact going for the strongest form).    -Superman could time travel AT WILL simply by flying fast enough.  -He is super-intelligent with photographic memory  -Has super-ventriloquism and super hearing so that not only can he hear things happening galaxies away, he can TALK to them    And in comparison to Goku, Superman just outclasses him in every aspect.  Goku has the kamehameha, but if he wants to do some serious damage, he has to charage up ridiculously long.  Superman on the other hand HAS DESTROYED A SOLAR SYSTEM WITH A SNEEZE.    And then people are talking about how Goku can use Instant Transmission, so he is faster than Superman.  But I respond to that by saying that Instant Transmission is NOT a battle ability.  It takes concentration and focus to know where you are moving to.  The actual transmission may be instant, but the preparation to do so is not.    On the other hand, Superman has been able to hear a problem happening a galaxies away, fly there, solve the problem, and return without Louis even know that he went missing while she was talking to him.  Now THAT is speed.    So yes, Superman wins this competition HANDS DOWN.|`|hITUqOuhaa	Goku, cause he's cool and as a the Kamehahaha move XD|`|L8ygWFV2aa	i would say goku because he has more durability plus if he goes to super sayian 4 he should do the spirt bomb and that should beat superman|`|BWCv68QOaa	ssj4 Goku could own him.  Hmmmm, he probably could have owned him as well......when his power level was....over 9,000!!!!!|`|vYRYeqiGaa	Goku, superman's power level isn't over 9000|`|oHbJqPLEaa	Goku,  he doesnt really have that one major weakness that Superman has, Kryptonite. I mean i doubt Goku would cheat like that but still. Other than than he could still do more long range damage, because think about it, Superman pretty much only uses hand to hand combat, Goku would never have to get close enough let Superman hit him and if he was using Instant Transmission he would move way faster than Superman anyway.|`|5abPOpmHaa	i would have to say Goku.  but if it was dead set line defiantly superman because he always finds a way to win.|`|UIzaamJ7aa	Goku, because he appears to not have any weaknesses.

29def525b4de3e4f1e95aaabfaa25f77aa	Kate hid Aaron with Sun at a hotel because the lawyer returned seeking a blood test for Kate to prove she is Aaron's mother. Jack and Kate tailed the lawyer to a hotel and saw him with Claire's mother. Jack went to talk to Claire's mother and he was about to explain the whole deal with Aaron (in the hopes that she would leave Aaron with Kate) when Claire's mother said, "Who's Aaron?" Jack realized that Claire's mother is not the one who is seeking the blood test and she doesn't even know about Aaron. It turned out that it is Ben who is behind the blood test request. I think he is trying to force Kate to go back to the island. Sawyer, Locke, Juliet, Daniel Farraday, Charlotte and Miles were going through more time shifts. Charlotte, Juliet and Miles all had more bloody noses and it turns out that the more time you spend on the island the more likely you are to have a bloody nose. Theory: Miles is the baby that was shown a few weeks ago in the flashback of the Asian guy heading up the Dharma project. It would tie Miles in with the whole Lost plot and explain why he is getting nosebleeds. He was born or a small infant on the island. ALso, Sawyer was pining for Kate and he "saw" Kate when the island shifted and time warped so that he witnessed her delivering Claire's baby. Sun is gunning for Ben literally and wants to kill him. At end of episode we see a man being pulled from the water during a storm by a group of French people. The man is Jin. He is alive. He sees a young (20 something) beautiful Frenchwoman who rescued him along with her French crew. She is pregnant. She introduces herself as Danielle Rousseau.|`|ylh8dRokaa	Wait until next Wednesday!

Even the ones that are supposed to have them all has many empty links with "video not found".      If you want to watch all this seasons episodes they are up at the Fox web site.  http://www.fox.com/fod/play.php?sh=famil...    The Family Guy  web site also shows episodes (5 or 6 at a time).  http://www.familyguy.com/  .  If you go to Google   http://www.google.com/  type in Family Guy and the season and episode    you can sometimes find direct links to an episode.  It's pretty much a crap shoot so good luck.

Androgen Insensitivity Syndrome could have made her genetically male.|`|AA11110297	The rumor is she had infantile genitalia(meaning her genitalia was too small for intercourse) ---     the D.A.'s files do contain the following:        Doctor Schwartz last stated that he studied surgery and that victim was on the make for him but that she was the patient of Doctor Arthur McGinnis Faught who was treating victim for trouble with her bartholin gland and that he wanted nothing to do with her. He stated that the bartholin gland was the lubricating gland in the vagina and that Doctor Faught had lanced it on several occasions and it could account for the fact that she had not been having intercourse with men.  (wikipedia)|`|23cd1ce5df4a524e8e8f1778905e43bcaa	According to John Gilmore, author of Severed: The True Story of the Black Dahlia Murder, the rumors about Elizabeth being "flaky and promiscuous" were fabricated by the press and by those who knew her loosely. The coroner who examined Elizabeth's tortured body reported that she had a genital defect that rendered her incapable of having standard intercourse.|`|a8e3e042ff8023522e346aee723c2b0eaa	A widely circulated myth holds that Short was unable to have sexual intercourse because of some genetic defect that left her with "infantile genitalia." Los Angeles County district attorney's files states the investigators had questioned three men with whom Short had sexual intercourse, including a Chicago police officer who was a suspect in the case. The FBI files on the case also contain a statement from a man with whom Short had sexual intercourse. According to the LAPD summary of the case, in the district attorney's files, the autopsy describes Short's reproductive organs as anatomically normal. The autopsy also states that Short was not and had never been pregnant, contrary to what is sometimes claimed.    While the "infantile genitalia" myth must be regarded as suspect, the D.A.'s files do contain the following:        Doctor Schwartz last stated that he studied surgery and that victim was on the make for him but that she was the patient of Doctor Arthur McGinnis Faught who was treating victim for trouble with her bartholin gland and that he wanted nothing to do with her. He stated that the bartholin gland was the lubricating gland in the vagina and that Doctor Faught had lanced it on several occasions and it could account for the fact that she had not been having intercourse with men.|`|3be1d947c2aa181e34c087c528e7e03daa	Elizabeth Short had underdeveloped genitals, making normal intercourse involving penetration impossible. She had not menstruated at the time of her death and had been taking hormones to correct the problem.  There are many sites to visit regarding the Black Dahlia.  Just type in 'Black Dahlia'....and you will find all the answers to your questions.

I was sitting at my desk when I remembered a phone call I had forgotten to  make. I found the number and dialled it. A man answered, saying, "Hello". I  politely said, "This is Fred Hanifin. Could I please speak with Robin  Carter?" Suddenly, the phone was slammed down on me. I couldn't believe that  anyone could be so rude.    I tracked down Robin's correct number and called her. I had transposed the  last two digits of her phone number.    After hanging up with her, I decided to call the 'wrong' number again. When  the same guy answered the phone, I yelled, "You're an asshole!" and hung up.  I wrote his number down with the word 'asshole' next to it, and put it in my  desk drawer. Every couple of weeks, when I was paying bills or had a really  bad day, I'd call him up and yell, "You're an asshole!" It always cheered me  up.    When Caller ID came to our area, I thought my therapeutic 'asshole' calling  would have to stop. So, I called his number and said, "Hi, this is John  Smith from the Telephone Company. I'm just calling to see if you're familiar  with the Caller ID program?" He yelled, "NO!" and slammed the phone down. I  quickly called him back and said, "That's because you're an asshole!"    One day I was at the store, getting ready to pull into a parking spot.    Some guy in a black BMW cut me off and pulled into the spot I had patiently  waited for. I hit the horn and yelled that I had been waiting for the spot.  The idiot ignored me.    I noticed a "For Sale" sign in his! car window - so, I wrote down his    number. A couple of days later, right after calling the first asshole, (I  had his number on speed dial), I thought I had better call the BMW asshole,  too.    I said, "Is this the man with the black BMW for sale?"    "Yes, it is."    "Can you tell me where I can see it?"    "Yes. I live at 1802 West 34th Street. It's a yellow house, and the car's  parked right out in front."    "What's your name?" I asked.    "My name is Don Hansen," he said.    "When's a good time to catch you, Don?"    "I'm home every evening after five."    "Listen, Don, can I tell you something?"    "Yes?"    "Don, you're an asshole."    Then I hung up, and added his number to my speed dial, too. Now, when I had  a problem, I had two assholes to call. But after several months of calling  them, it wasn't as enjoyable as it used to be.    So, I came up with an idea. I called Asshole  1.    "Hello."    "You're an asshole!" (But I didn't hang up).    "Are you still there?" he asked.    "Yeah," I said.    "Stop calling me," he screamed.    "Make me," I said.    "Who are you?" he asked.    "My name is Don Hansen."    "Yeah? Where do you live?"    "Asshole, I live at 1802 West 34th Street, a yellow house, with my black  Beemer parked in front."    He said, "I'm coming over right now, Don. And you had better start saying  your prayers."    I said, "Yeah, like I'm really scared, asshole."    Then I called Asshole  2.    "Hello?" he said.    "Hello, asshole," I said.    He yelled, "If I ever find out who you are?"    "You'll what?" I said.    "I'll kick your ***," he exclaimed.    I answered, "Well, asshole, here's your chance. I'm coming over right now."    Then I hung up and immediately called the police,saying that I lived at 1802  West 34th Street, and that I was on my way over there to kill my gay lover.  Then I called Channel 13 News about the gang war going down on West 34th  Street.    I quickly got into my car and headed over to 34th Street.    There I saw two assholes beating the crap out of each other in front of six  squad cars, a police helicopter, and news crew.    NOW, I feel better.         that joke has gotten RAVE reveiws from all my friends.. u will b a hit if you tell it  right! good luck!!

42752ab4ab20a3852a93491c98fdff11aa	I remember watching the commentary and M. Knight Shamalan explained that through out the movie when ever you see anything red, it signifies that a ghost is about to appear.  Remember the red tent in the boy's room, a ghost appeared.  I think the mother was wearing a red sweater when the ghost appeared at the car.  I do remember Shamalan explaining that red is a signal for viewers to be prepared to see a ghost very soon.|`|lJZNGsZCaa	Yes thats right think i watched the commentary as well, it represents something the ghost has touched, they had to go through the whole movie to make sure there was no other red props.

Through the mirror,night reflected,miraculous to see,  my soul threw away the mask,that hinds the deeper me.  Reveal the soul inside,  shred the truth with all your lies,  hope,despair and grace,  hold the common face,  a truth you can not hide.  Heed to the burning call on the sure and swifted wing  hear your hearts desire,like a burning fire,  fly back to the beginning  *music*  In this world of love and hate,where the wind blows like a blade,  two young hearts of grace and beauty,decisions start to fade,  on my journey,for deception,the pain is all I see,  seeking the righteous path to find the truth in me.  Breaking the dark of night,  Piercing through the painted white,  cut it all away from yesterday,  till' a knew era's in sight.  Unlock the heart within,  let it spread it's wings and soar,  rising up in flight,through the night of white,  and fly on forever more.  *music*  *bridge*  Vanish with the fake light,  born into the true light,  within these hands.  Breaking the dark of night,  Piercing through the painted white,  cut it all away from yesterday,  till' a knew era's in sight.  Unlock the heart within,  let it spread it's wings and soar,  rising up in flight,through the night of white,  and fly on forever more.  *ending music*|`|PmqAN8Mpaa	Become as wings that outshine your sadness, cutting through the white darkness    Illuminated by the cold sun  I had some tame freedom  On the miraculous night reflected in the mirror  My soul began to remove its mask    On the other side of the crumbling wall  Despair and hope wear the same face  If your heart is not satisfied  Head towards the ending prologue that flies away...      In this world where the wind blows like a knife  What is it that I should protect?  When I know one pain after another  I draw closer to my true self    The fake light that is disappearing  The true light that is being born  In these hands...      Pierce through the white-dyed night  Go on creating a new era  With a heart that's been released  Fly through the endlessly continuing white night    Also on a side note, It strikes me as interest as to why people respond with the same answer when they see the question has already been answered?|`|LcSwDbr4aa	The English Version is sung by Vic Mignogna (the voice actor for Dark)  http://profile.myspace.com/index.cfm?fus...

tLI94qWNaa	I do agree with you that many youths pick up bad habits from movies, but it is not just movies that do this.  The people around them, there parents, video games, tv commercials, advertisements on billboards.  There are bad influences all around us, and yes movies play a part in this but it is not just the movies.  Also the way that these children are raised plays a large part, if the parents allow a child to see a movie that has bad influences in the movie, then is it the parents doing for the youths picking up smoking because it was in the film that the parents let them see???|`|59CaFeS8aa	ignite natural fire of sex|`|AA11717111	It might have some effect, though it probably doesn't have as much as you say.|`|SmtoSb02aa	That's like saying an adult married for 13 years watched porn and it made them have sex. lol.|`|GkdLyy6iaa	It is how the youth takes up|`|pTx9Hsavaa	don't be silly,people smoked even before movies started,following their fathers,peers or customs of their country.society and parents are more responsible ,they should play active role in preventing underage child from smoking.adults have the choice to smoke of their own free will.    millions watch movies,only few handfuls get inspired into any anti-social behavior.its a lie that you and persons like you spread.why blame movies aren't parents responsible for their child.    lots of youth watch porn but they don't go out and rape people.movies are for entertainment,that's their job.|`|hxAieDWoaa	i wouldn't say it had much affect .. its just an excuse for bad behaviour by blaming a movie the attention is lifted away from them   :)|`|fWT46zVUaa	The present Indian Film Industry is growing rapidly because of youngstairs, They are targeted, most educated would not , but for some days they ll be on that movie thoughts and get out from that movie which they hav seen last.Uneducated? no chance they realize themselves as they are on the screen, act as themselves in society , no chance of Eradicating poverty, in such kind of System, There are Good films too, if u see South Indian Films u ll get annoyed, Actors like Vijay, Ajith, Simbu, Dhanush, what to say abt these guys nuts in Film Industry, People watching their movies are mentals.Waste of money and depression .

kg6TOZyaaa	If I were you, I would read the books first, that is what I did. By reading the books first, you get the maximum enjoyment and benefit out of them compared to watching the movie first and then reading the books. I find that once I have watched a movie, the book, if I havent read it is spoiled, whereas if I read the book first and then watch the movie, I enjoy them both alot more.    By the way, the books of Twilight are highly enjoyable and if you really want the maximum experience in the Twilight Saga, you really should read the books altogether before watching the movies, although the movie does do the book justice in my opinion.|`|ebaa7ca0b1b2e45ca08cf6fd5db01a30aa	read the book first|`|fqrE36YSaa	You should read the books first.

lmGx31vvaa	It's the last episode of series 3 called "Quantocking."  It's where Sophie and Mark go on a little holiday in the Quantocks - the proposal weekend - and Jeremy takes Superhands (who is attempting to go cold turkey) only for Big Suse to turn up.  Mark and Jeremy are looking for Sophie in the Quantocks when they themselves get lost.  When they find a public footpath they seperate, Jeremy going the way he thinks is the way back to the hotel, Mark the other.  Mark gives him his jacket because he thinks he's right.  He is wrong.  Phew!    I don't know where you could watch it.  youtube maybe?  But the dvds in HMV are only like 7 atm.    I'm re-watching all series with my friend who hasn't seen them!

Just because you don't think he's funny doesn't mean he doesn't deserve a sponsor.<br>  <br>  I can't stand Carlos Mencia, and he had his own show.

1jPZZE9zaa	I understand what you are saying. Being from the Northeast myself, I know what it means to see The Murphy's on St Patty's Day in Boston. It ain't just a concert, it is a full blown super party.<br>  <br>  Good luck getting the tickets.Stub Hub says $85-$305 for the 14th. I saw them years ago at The Ballroom and it is worth $500 a ticket as far as I am concerned. If I could get up there I would certainly pay what It takes to see that show. Hell, I'd want to see the whole string of shows!|`|52cdjmbQaa	Christ, you are willing to pay $75?

irSBrZiQaa	Buzz sang that song to Coop because it was what Jenna(Coop's mom used to sing to him)...I think it was just showing that Buzz was letting Coop go. All during the show, they kept flashing back to scenes with Jenna, Coop and Buzz when Coop was younger. That song was a memorial for both Coop and Jenna...|`|jHDeIPEfaa	Downtown. It was Jenna's song that she used to sing to Coop when he was young.|`|a1Ngi39Xaa	It was a favorite song of Jenna's (his Mother).  Someone asked this yesterday I think.

You make your own works cited page (aka bibliography) based on sources you used to research something (in this case I am assuming you researched something about this movie). <br>  <br>  Maybe you meant to say you are looking for 2 reputable sources for you to cite?

oMYGtqubaa	Well.... R&B is primarily a black music style coming from jazz, blues, early rock n roll etc....    <br>  <br>  But, its NOT  necessarily about ONLY "love songs"...  there is a much BIGGER range of topics (which I WISH was exposed more to the general public).. but, I guess, commercially, songs about 'love' get more play than any other topic.|`|UllYFJgjaa	Nope!|`|hyXeGtbZaa	No. Firstly, it's not just black people. Justin Timberlake is white. Mariah Carey isn't white but she's definitely not black. Amy Winehouse is white. Madonna, who has just decided to change to R&B is white. And Shakira is Mexican.<br>  <br>  Also, it's not just lovesongs. It has loads of different styles. You get up-tempo R&B (fast, exciting songs), you get down-tempo R&B (which are usually the lovesongs) and you get mid-tempo R&B (which is quite chilled out but isn't ballady).<br>  <br>  A lot of people confuse up-tempo R&B with Hip-Hop. Hip-Hop artists are people like DMX, 50 Cent, Eminem, 2pac, Biggie, Dr Dre, ETC. <br>  <br>  Up tempo R&B has been used by artists such as Rihanna, Aaliyah and Beyonce. These artists, however, have all done lovesongs in the past.<br>  <br>  So it's not just black people singing lovesongs. There's so much more to it than that. It is a genre used by so many people with different roots and it comes in loads of different styles.<br>  <br>  I hope that this has answered you question!|`|ZckxI1M5aa	Not true. You have plenty of caucasians who sing R&B.  Amy Winehouse, Robin Thicke, Adelle, Joss Stone, mariah carey...<br>  <br>  Stimulate your mind buddy!<br>  <br>  Edit: And they don't just sing love songs, they also sing about life and tell stories.|`|ac825b3aff0d9322a9befa72bcf651f6aa	R&B was generally black popular music, As the charts used to be called 'race charts' before being renamed,it follows that it was black music|`|0NVy6sLkaa	R&B music has been around for many many decades and I really doubt EVERY song is a love song.|`|iXzrep0eaa	No. Plain and Simple.

KU5SB6Tlaa	it depends.  beat like just percussion and beatboxing drum noises? or like with harmonies and pitches that change?  i write a song, then i start singing it in different ways, and whatever i decide on sounds best for the rhythm, i go with that.  then i just build up a good basic drum beat like "hi-hat hi-hat hi-hat hi-hat/snare"..and so on, and then add fills and better sounds to it for a bit of interest grabbing.  It really all depends on the song though.  if its fast paced, go with a hip hop beat, or maybe a rock sort of thing if its a rock song.  slow, go with a slow beat with a lot of snare and cymbals.  anyhow, its totally up to you what the beat is, but i think the song should be made first.  but if you have a cool beat already made, you can write a song about basically anything and make it fit almost any beat.<br>  <br>  good luck|`|fu0ZEpLfaa	Personnally i create diffrent genres such as heavy metal, rock, harcore rock, etc... Basically i create the entire song and then i write the lyrics *this could take a long time* then sing or get others to sing the lyrics in time with the song.<br>  <br>  Hope This Helped|`|9pHUj1Rraa	It really depends on the type of person.  Sometimes I will make the song first and sometimes I write the lyrics first.|`|rhJ3haPJaa	well i think they make the beat first cause its easier then they make the lirics|`|htyH4MdWaa	its possible to do it both ways. i dont play rap, im in a hard rock band, but i suppose the concept of making music is the same. we tend to write the lyrics first, and then the music, as its a touch easier.|`|iCDIkk3kaa	just start making the rap and when your going with it youl realize what beat will go with it. itl just come to you.|`|Ey5ew3G6aa	it's better if you make the lyrics first.|`|jsgKGtdBaa	If i knew i wouldn't be here on Yahoo answers

L6jKwlyXaa	Usually dead eyes refer to a vacant stare, like when a person feels empty or sad. He seems to realize they are both feeling lonely, thus he asks her "Dead eyes, are you just like me?", meaning, are you as lost and alone like me.<br>  <br>  This is the contrary of sparkling eyes, when you are in love and happy.
Wkmgtyojaa	This is easy. All cool cats and dolls hang out at the malt shop. They like to dance, especially, the twist and the hustle.

rFZtQuV2aa	Beats me.  He wasn't that bad, but Danny could sing rings around him.|`|gIjnoEi5aa	My reason for loving Anoop has nothing to do with his ethnicity.  I fell in love with his voice during his initial audition when he sang, "Thank You," by Boyz II Men. He has an amazing voice and it's absolutely gorgeous! I also found out that he sang in an all male a cappella (sp?) group for the University of North Carolina and watched clips of the performances on You Tube. After watching those clips it made me want him to succeed even more. Therefore, I'm going to pray that he makes it in the wild card round because I REALLY REALLY REALLY REALLY REALLY want to see him in the top 12!|`|92gN7RVPaa	I'm actually mad that they didn't put through Ricky Braddy .. I thought his voice was awesome, but he got no air time - so that is probably why he didn't have a huge fan base.<br>  <br>  Anoop will most likely get the wild card pick, because he is likable, but he also has a good voice.|`|rJHTmXa9aa	because he has a beautifuuuuul voice duuh.<br>  his voice make me wanna do wild things. :))<br>  lol|`|032467f7118afdbd53ad18573df6ce42aa	I love his voice and I think hes so sexy|`|5270639c059ab08c1b3431555f150db7aa	His voice is very nice, natural - not forced.<br>  Plus, he seems to have a nice, easygoing personality, is very personable - and being handsome doesn't hurt.<br>  I sure wish he would have gotten through.|`|SFDCB2Xsaa	His voice is good.

He doesn't even sound that great.<br>  <br>  Although, when JC came out with that some girls dance with women song, I understood why he was so underrated.|`|juqeWRgIaa	Yes!  Justin's voice has been getting worse and worse over the years (especially when he sings live).  JC has a power voice with a huge range.  Plus, half the songs on FutureSex/LoveSounds that everyone thought were so new and innovative were just rip offs of JC's Schizophrenic album.|`|ziZpamVuaa	I agree, although I like Justin more to be honest.

I even had to sleep below deck in the sailors sleeping area on those very stretched-for-space bunk beds. <br>  <br>  I saw whales, and loads of penguins and seals. The penguins are not at all frightened, a group of three actually followed me up the beach in a line. There were loads of little fluffy chicks also. One evening, three killer whales jumped out the water. <br>  It doesn't get dark there because it was summer time, so one night we all went on a zodiac to shore to see a penguin colony, and the sky was bright ruby red. <br>  <br>  I got a bit seasick, but it was amazing. Also, there was a 2 star chef on board! yum!|`|iA5kZv15aa	Jersey as a kid<br>  A beautiful island. And I couldn't believe how warm the sea was.

But I always wanted something that I could actually wear to work.<br>  <br>  I was thinking like artfully drawn vines with flowers, in pastel colors.  And it would come up from my feet and up to my head (not my face though).  And the vines would do some kind of twirling around my special parts...<br>  <br>  I love flowers!|`|AA10412319	no tattoo please|`|muq7BreEaa	i don' necessarily want one [it would just feel like something i could never take off, cause it is. haha].<br>  <br>  but if i did get one, it would be something that meant something to me, not just a heart on my back or something stupid. <br>  i would probably get a butterfly because they are very meaningful to me. - after my grandfather died (i was young, like five) i was sitting in our backyard and i was thinking about him and suddenly about a hundred or more white butterflies flew out of a tree into the air. it was so beautiful and whenever i see a butterfly i think of him. ;) and i would probably get it on the back of my neck or somewhere hidden.<br>  <br>  i would get it at a tattoo place, i guess. i would make sure they had all their license and stuff though.|`|AA11306089	I've wanted a nautical star for so long. I might get something else with it..like a swirl design with it or something like that..and I'm not sure where I'd get it, I was thinking on my ankle. I love foot tattoos too so I might get a star or a heart there, like Taylor Swift's fake one.|`|ZDOfXBd2aa	I'm not sure. I think it would be neat.

Exotic flowers, mountains, water, and a single bird in flight (which started the whole thing). Several artists over the years contributed more and more to the original. Go to a custom tattoo place, not the cookie cutter guys who only create from stock artwork. It can be pricey, and remember...make sure you WANT a tattoo because you'll be stuck with it. I picked a part of my body where I can show it off  or cover it up when I want to. (Tattoos don't go over well in certain job interviews.)|`|cJcwHBglaa	Probably not but if I did, it would be a small one on my hip of a star or something...?|`|w4X6Y7tIaa	I have one that I regret.I want to get it removed or covered up with something better.|`|ROAS5EGLaa	no, but If I had to get one it would be above my butt, and it would say something very clever.|`|jWl7Zi1Uaa	Yeah I want one, but I'm too indecisive - I wouldn't know what to get or where to get it.<br>  =P|`|8a3822ced036f956bfbf2ffe198d7003aa	I don't want one, just because I know whatever I get it of, I won't like that in a few days/weeks XD|`|SWxBuzntaa	I want a tatoo of a tree on my lower back

The rest of the movies were awful in my opinion. But I enjoyed all the books!|`|Am8kMEX3aa	Books: Order of the Phoenix and Half-Blood Prince<br>  <br>  Movies: Prisoner of Azkaban, Goblet of Fire, and Order of the Phoenix|`|9XDe0Zyuaa	Movie- Prisoner of Azkaban<br>  Book- The Order of the Phoenix (why did this movie have to be so wrong!!)|`|52pZj3WFaa	Chamber of Secrets film (purely for the reappearance of the gorgeous Sean Biggerstaff as Oliver Wood) and the hilarious performance from Kenneth Branagh.<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.harry-potter-games.com/Sean_Biggerstaff_Oliver_Wood.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.harry-potter-games.com/Sean_B...</a><br>  <br>  And books - Half-Blood Prince because of the pure viciousness of the magic, the revelations within the plot and the development of the story.|`|JL4z0Hm4aa	Movie: Prisoner of Azkaban<br>  Book: Order of Phoenix- But Sirius dies in that book :( :(|`|ZACMoCdWaa	Movie- Harry Potter and the Order of the Pheonix<br>  Book- Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban|`|MTPoGd1qaa	Half blood prince, and I like the chamber of secrets, quite a dark movie but it was created well!<br>  <br>  Looking forward, to ron and lavender haha, Deathly hallows should be good too!|`|CZEj3mYBaa	I liked Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows (book 7) and the first movie.

eta0c25yaa	Boozy W, wtf? This person is just asking a question you psyhco.<br>  <br>  No, i dont think so.. where did you hear that?<br>  Zac Efron is presenting an award there too, and I know that he is definitly not an A-List celeb. haha<br>  But Rob is about to be one, hopefully :)|`|0kTbs879aa	SunnyDay I am so sorry honey that your answers are being used for people to be so hateful and cruel to one another. Some people need to grow up. And if they are so sick of hearing about him then they dont need to waste their time clicking on the question to read it further and then spend all their "precious" time responding to it. There is no need for all this hostility over a man they dont even know! Anyways....<br>   I love Robert Pattinson, as I has stated before on all my answers but he is far from an A-List actor. They are having him present because he is very! popular right now and having him present is guarantee ratings (they saw how everyone freaked when he was suppose to present and Russell Brand cut him off on the MTV awards). So for them its good business, for him its good exposure since he has been hiding out in London for the past couple months.<br>  My babe Rob is still new in the game. He doesnt have enough serious high rated work on his resume to be considered A-List. As long as he keeps perfecting his craft and trying different roles ex. Salvador Dali, then I am sure he will remain in the spotlight and not fade into the background like some pop culture actors. I think Rob can do it but I also dont believe he is worried about being A-List. I think he just wants to do movies that matter to him, that are different, and that are fun. He wants to enjoy his acting not just make tons of money off it.|`|ZjM0ghSnaa	no, anyone can present at the oscars, and they dont have to be A list. He isnt really that famous, and isnt known for alot of movies, but twilight. <br>  <br>  To get to the A list, he has to do alot more movies, recieve alot more awards, and a whole lot more. You dont just become on the A list, its not a joke. Its hard work and takes a long time.|`|oNIIzLwHaa	lol @ first two answers. MEE-OOWWW<br>  <br>  anyhoo, i don think he's a-list just because he is presenting. he was unknown for harry potter and just did twilight. he's popular right now, but one movie doesn't put you on the a-list. <br>  <br>  a-list = command lots of money for roles and in high demand. that remains to be seen|`|jBzldheZaa	He maybe or not.  I really don't care because in my book he is an A+.  One of the most gorgeous guys I've ever seen.. i am actually considering moving to Forks but my granddaughter says I have to take her too.  But that means  I have to take my daughters too.  I doubt Edward would be interested in a grandma and her kids.  Doesn't mean I can't have his picture taped to my bathroom mirror!|`|bmwR7RdMaa	he cant even act...|`|403a76a591bc07b10b1a689c061b508daa	noooooo.
Ci7YWC4paa	Yes, if you own the following, a time machine (to go back in time and get a sabre tooth tiger) and some kind of protective equiptment (lets be honest they aren't known for being friendly otherwise it would have been called the fluffy fur tiger rather than sabre tooth)|`|RKLFYS2Naa	..~HEY~..<br>  <br>  PROBABLY NOT-- the grow very large in size, and may eat a lot. It would do a number on your budget considering you'd be buying a ton of pet food for it!<br>  <br>  Besides, why not consider getting a smaller kitty, perhaps adopting one from the humane society?|`|LD0NGav4aa	Yes they do. All you have to do is be good at burying bodies. Fluffy (my tiger) has killed three mailman, four of my friends and troop 314 of the girls scouts. I feel so safe with fluffy and i think you should get a saber tooth tiger to.|`|0F1775TVaa	only if they have a hover-boarding Raptor on speed dial to call up when you need help getting those damned kids off your lawn.|`|JUYTrzHyaa	They did for Rug-gug and his wife Mrs. Drag-Me-Around-By-My-Hair|`|i8LbFRbSaa	Only if you want to be ripped to shreds and if you can travel in time to get on|`|wxkIHCbLaa	yaeh super pets just got a new shipment|`|kGtMWcp2aa	ya why not!!!!|`|1PqbJzsnaa	yes - like that chimp in Connecticut ~ REAL good pets...|`|8FdFOYFIaa	Keep In The Front Yard.

Though sadly you would need something else to guard your guard cats from you. ^_^|`|C1y4sOfFaa	saber toothed tigers are long gone|`|tOoJL7sYaa	oh yea! almost as good as a bear!|`|tT6GMdHiaa	they are cool pets but they might just rip your face off|`|AA10415600	sure.  of course you do know they're all dead so that might hamper the amount of playing with it you'll get.  other than that, go for it|`|rLP9wjPtaa	Naw, they keep falling apart and you have to glue the bones back together all the time...|`|Z8d9ipxmaa	Yeah why not. Fossils can't attack you, like today's living tigers can.|`|1T0qFdMRaa	I'm sure you will scare away any robbers|`|ICLekd2Vaa	yes, they're all in museums though. they're extinct. :)|`|a1566efb5533aa90596e330bc315a547aa	sure! but there aren't any more around.|`|oqUci1MNaa	uhh yupp..<br>  <br>  sadly they are extinct though|`|7l0XmyZwaa	hell yea! i got one who plays with my anaconda.|`|Otfg1gakaa	yes i have a pet lion. He is full grown sometime he will bite me but i say ok lion its okay. He growl at me sometime so i just say ey teku khana khana hai? and he just smile? so one day the lion and i were taking a walk and he bit my leg. So i took him home cooked him and ate him. The moral of the story is that lions are delicious so if you get hungry buy one and tell me your address. I own a sloth and sometimes i will let it poop on my chest. it feels good and it is good acne cleanser. try it or ill kill you...|`|acaJLTYVaa	As an experienced saber-tooth tiger breeder, I can tell you that they are very lovable and loyal. The only problem is keeping them happy with fresh meat. Make sure that there are no infants in the household.|`|Uzayv72kaa	yeah. what are you stupid? everyone has saber-toothed tigers as pets. where have you been?|`|K5uoaetaaa	They are extinct, so nobody can give you an honest answer.  I would say probably not as they would eat you.|`|pPp2FfDVaa	Well they're easy to feed, don't need much running space and aren't at all vicious being dead.  I still prefer smaller mouse eating cats.|`|G5yQtHs9aa	Probably not.|`|9qU9ojuDaa	Well if you've got 1 Jenny your sure to get 2 points''?|`|t4FBtIsTaa	Yes they do, along with woolly mammoths and dodos.|`|s7ms1aU0aa	Good pets?

JL4z0Hm4aa	Both are very hard to be.  So I think neither is easy<br>  <br>  Singing: You have to control your vocals, learn/know how to read music, and sing on key.<br>  <br>  Acting: Memorizing Lines, showing different emotions during scenes, and making the character seem realistic.<br>  <br>  I would have to say it's really challenging.|`|sZMa0s7Baa	Both are very difficult.

Check it out.|`|XojxC4xxaa	Well, if you don't see a specific show that you like on Disney Channel, Cartoon Network, or Nickelodeon, chances are the show has been canceled.  It is not likely because of an actor or writer's strike, because if there was, it would probably go public.  <br>  <br>  As you may see, there used to be a channel called "Teen Nick", but I don't see that anymore, and I also have noticed that Nickelodeon has gone pre-teen and is aiming towards teenagers/tweenagers.|`|ESH5LD0uaa	if the shows get too old, they are replaced. take example the first show ever on nick. it got so old, they had to make new ones. soon, even the mighty b will be gone or ben 10 alien force, or even the suite life on deck.|`|dc4SzJCFaa	I miss Muppet Babies, Rocko's Modern Life, Duck Tails, Rugrats, Recess, WIldthorn Berrys, & Courage The Cowardly Dog|`|dJEQJ60Aaa	haha me too.

How would you ever be able to really verify the ages of people on either site?<br>  2. Pervs would stalk the kids on the 13-17 site.<br>  3. Kids would always go on the adult site, and see things that they have no business seeing. Bad enough that when I was 20 I had relations with a girl thinking she was my age, when she was not of legal age yet. Now that I'm much older (none of your bees wax how old, we'll just say that there's more chrome on the dome now), it would be an episode of "To Catch A Predator".<br>  <br>  <br>  Although it would be nice to not see all the Twilight/Miley/Jonas bashing/loving questions.

The rest of the people well be in the wild card round after groups 2 and 3 sing. Probably about 2 weeks from now. They will then pick 3 people from that group.  I think that's how it's going to go.  I missed half of last night because i fell asleep.  working to hard I guess.|`|LRLu1ofNaa	They will probably bring the contestants back, and three of them will make it through.|`|z5Wxwtrfaa	i dont know what happening but i learned that tatiana left, even tho shes weird as hell she was the best singer. she killed that whitney song omg i loved it.|`|bZiVHV1Aaa	This yr they changed the entire format.

Fp3pifGtaa	"Bad Girl" by DJ rap
NfXeZ00jaa	Obviously, you'd need the separate parts of the songs you want to use : the vocal separated from the first song and an instrumental version of the other.  Even then, if the bpm (beats per minute) aren't similar, you'll find this pretty hard to do.  Some music software stretches music so that you can mix one track with another at the same bpm but they have to be pretty close, tempo-wise.  <br>  <br>  Sorry I can't be of more help.

wEEOvu5Waa	Wrong section so I wont go into detail.<br>  <br>  While authors change the view on many subjects over time to keep it fresh, and to give their own twist to it, Rice generally keeps her Vampires playing the ancient role of creature of the night. Meyer leans toward a vampire that appeals to a group who probably hasn't ever read anything on Dracula.<br>  <br>  Rice's main character Lestat is given emotions, but non human emotions. He falls in 'love' with humans, but his style of love is really the yearning he has to remember his human emotions, since he lacks them as a Vampire. He also finds humans beautiful in the sense that human life is so fragile. He has the kind of mind a vampire should have, a dark mind that captures more than just the mere outer image. His mind also somewhat stays in the time period in which he was born. His manner doesn't change throughout his existence because if you think about it, he isn't growing. He does become smarter but he retains the image he was at the time he died.<br>  <br>  Edward, the 'vampire' is almost entirely different. For one he doesn't follow one of the major guide line a vampire has: no daylight. He is a vampire who cannot go into the sun because he sparkles? Everyone says he is 'hot', and even I admit Lestat is down right nice looking, but its that cold calculation beauty, the kind a pouncing tiger gives. Cold, deadly, but stunningly beautiful. Edward and his lot are just made out to be teenage heart throbs. <br>  <br>  Another major thing that contradicts being a Vampire, is he actually sires a child. He is a vampire! He's dead! How did he manage to get up in the first place, and how does a dead body produce sperm? Sometimes people can get away with vampire families, but this was just silly.<br>  <br>  They also love Twilight because it has sappy 'romance'. But if you think about it, Ed just loves Bella for her scent. What traits does he actually love in her? The scent bounded them, and it was more like finding a mate, something that isnt usually based on love, rather than finding a lover. And of course Bella loved him for his beauty, and whatever vampire features he had. But did they ever really have any passionate moment that really made you think he loved her?<br>  <br>  It's also VERY easy to read. So it doesn't put any strain on the mind. Lestat actually challenges your thinking, and Rice does a great job in her books. <br>  <br>  Of course Rice is better, but teens these days hardly read enough to actually be on her level. Even Harry Potter is a harder read than Twilight. Its easy and its 'romance'. Of course some silly teen would stick to it.|`|ZII6YCk1aa	Wrong section go to books and authors.

I don't know if it actually did anything special, just for safe passage maybe.<br>  <br>  ill check back to see if anyone else knows|`|AA11506593	I haven't read the books in decades, and I don't remember cloak pins from the movies. I think the Riders of Rohan and the Elves wore them. But I just can't remember anything beyond that.|`|kXxaUnSUaa	Yeah, it was the cloaks that were special rather than the pins (making Frodo & Sam 'invisible'). But the reason the pins are probably staying in your mind is because Merry & Pippin drop theirs in The Two Towers movie when they get kidnapped by the Orcs, so Aragorn, Legolas and Gimli find it when they are tracking them and know they are on the right path.
y8WBcehmaa	this has been asked 30 times already today.|`|JCJVi8Qraa	Slum Dog.|`|LT7IwZdhaa	Slumdog Millionaire should win<br>  <br>  While the Curious Case of Benjamin Button was a great technical achievement and was entertaining; Slumdog Millionaire was an insightful glimpse into life in India. It told the main character's life story as he is shown answering correctly questions and how his life experiences gave him the background for the knowledge to the questions.<br>  <br>  Milk is also a worthy film for best picture as well with great performances by Sean Penn as Harvey milk and James Brolin as his murderer Dan White.
65rH6k7taa	I do like it, though admittedly it's not my favourite album of hers. Whenever I listen to it I wish I could be hearing it live instead. The all-vocal arrangements just beg to be done live. The few live performances there are with all the vocalists are absolutely amazing. (here's one for example: <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V8U2QzaDoAQ" rel="nofollow">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V8U2QzaDo...</a> ) <br>  Sadly, she didn't do much touring with Medúlla.

Anything for a rating.|`|YIcBd569aa	wow, I was thinking the same thing. but its early in the game so hopefully one of the other contestants from next week or the following week will do better than she did and even thought they won't make it to the top twelve that will at least beat out Tatiana for the wild card. she did sound good but I really hope someone is better than her who does not make it. whats killilng it for her is her personality I know its a singing competition but personality and looks go a long way. you have to have the whole package. they are making fun of her on t.v and radio. I hope she will see it and realize what a fool she has been. people learn your lessen all the other contestant who could sing did not make it if their personality sucked. remember bikini girl posing and pimping for the camera always blowing kisses? she would not have gone far with that personality. no matter how beautiful you are if you personality sucks then you begin to look ugly.|`|5LxpvXSmaa	well they already have the number one rated show so i hope that they would not be that oblivious to the fact that most of the Nation is annoyed by her but in the crazy world of TV anything can happen and anything will. <br>  I said it before we have not seen the end of her not by a long shot.|`|SVqR4Nebaa	anything for a rating is correct.

0fb4ce4da0f3875154ab271a088412fcaa	My favorite old cartoons for the 80's and 90's, that's a tough one. I loved Wildthorn Berry's, Rugrats, Hey Arnold, and Catdog. Those shows were the best shows from back then. I also loved Tailspin, that was the show to watch. Hey Arnold was one of my favorites from back then, and I loved watching it all the time, one of my favorite cartoons. There is probably a lot that I'm forgetting but those were probably my favorites. Scooby Doo was also an awesome show, I remember waking up just to watch that show but that's more of an Late 80's and Early 90's show.<br>  <br>  Simpsons and South Park were from the 90's too, and those are some of my favorite current favorites.|`|a1566efb5533aa90596e330bc315a547aa	I miss that time.

His poetry was so powerful and yet his delivery and production were so catchy that his music was really deep and popular. He really impacted peoples ideas and action. <br>  <br>  He had swagger and consciousness. <br>  <br>  I think that there are people out there with great ideas: dead prez, common, but they can be so boring. <br>  <br>  There are people with creativity and intelligence: andre 3000 <br>  but he does not have such a raw appeal or a dark side. <br>  <br>  I think that LIL WAYNE has the star power, the popularity, the awareness, the intelligence, the dual nature, the prolificness, the raw appeal, and the sense to be the next 2 pac -esque figure. <br>  <br>  I think lil wayne falls short a bit of 2pac as far as subject matter and peotic skill.

That's the official roster, they speculate Giant/Ant Man, Wasp, and Black Widow but no confirmation. <br>  <br>  The antagonists are going to be the Schitary, an alien race that wants to take over Earth since their own home has been destroyed.<br>  <br>  Regardless, I can't wait!

News exclusively that Rihanna has alleged to police that Brown choked her while threatening to kill her and, subsequently, she lost consciousness.<br>  <br>  They began squabbling after leaving Clive Davis' pre-Grammy party late Saturday. Shortly after midnight, things blew up. Brown pulled his silver Lamborghini to the side of a street in L.A.'s Hancock Park neighborhood. That's when, per the source, Rihanna grabbed the car keys and tossed them out the window, sending Brown into a rage.<br>  <br>  He tried in vain to find the keys, then came back to the car, put his hands around her neck and, according to the insider, said, "I'm going to kill you!"<br>  <br>  According to the source, the 20-year-old "Disturbia" singer told police that she lost consciousness, and when she awoke, Brown had fled.<br>  <br>  According to the source, her right eye was blackened and badly swollen and she had hand prints on her arms. The responding officers were so concerned about her, they drove Rihanna to the hospital in their squad car instead of waiting for an ambulance.<br>  <br>  Officers took two sets of photographs of the banged-up singer, one at the scene and the second after she was admitted to Cedars-Sinai Medical Center for treatment. Those photos were presumably among the evidence presented to the district attorney.<br>  <br>  After being treated for her injuries, police escorted her down a rear elevator and into a waiting Mercedes, the source says.<br>  <br>  Brown, 19, was subsequently booked on suspicion of making criminal threats. He was released after posting $50,000 bail.<br>  <br>  His lawyer, Mark Geragos, has not responded to repeated requests for comment on the allegations. Brown's publicist also has not commented.<br>  <br>  A spokeswoman for Rihanna declined to comment specifically on details of the fight and the arrest and stuck to her earlier statement from Sunday: "Rihanna is well.

956d43fbc612852be9834658deb4139faa	Because of his actions, the reality TV star was initially arrested on suspicion of second-degree attempted murder and indecent exposure when he turned himself in Friday, January 11. In court, Jason Wessel, the security guard who responded to the reports of a man fondling himself in his car, told the judge he was afraid for his life.  He said Chapman tried to hit him with his truck after he told Chapman to get out of his vehicle. Wessel said Chapman dove into his back seat when security approached and when told to get out of his truck he sped off just missing the security guard. Prosecutors said he was aiming at him. Chapman's attorney used pictures of tire tracks to try to prove Chapman was just trying to avoid a newspaper stand. "I think that what you have in front of you - the exhibits showing the parallel tracks in the space - shows the vehicle went straight ahead and not towards any person including Mr. Wessel," said Chapman's attorney Brook Hart.<br>  <br>  Chapman's next court date for the terroristic threatening charges was set for January 24. On January 29, 2009, the threatening charges were dropped.    The indecent exposure charges still pending.<br>  <br>  February 2, 2009, Tim Chapman was acquitted of indecent exposure.  <br>  <br>  <br>  Since Dog is supposed to be about second chances I`m assuming Tim will be back next season.|`|WyNUxIA8aa	Tim Chapmanmturned himself in to police investigating a report of a naked man in a pickup truck at Ala Moana Center Thursday night.<br>  <br>  A security guard who recognized Chapman told him to put on his clothes and get out of the truck, but after putting on his clothes, Chapman started his truck, drove over a sidewalk, nearly hitting the guard, and drove off, police said.<br>  <br>  He is on a long vacation from the show until this little legal problem is solved.|`|ztug2gLjaa	He was arrested for saying a bad word.

VOTE FORDANNY|`|0CsMa3T3aa	hes got the look (robert downy jr lookalike), the story(his wife who passed away right before he auditioned), & the voice (he can sing)<br>  <br>  personally i am a fan of anoop & am hoping the judges bring him back for their wildcard pick!  & rickey braddy never had screen time before this so know one knew him , but i voted for him =)|`|92gN7RVPaa	Did you hear Danny sing Kissed by a rose by seal?<br>  My heart melted out of my chest .. and he sung it amazingly<br>  Danny has passion, and you can hear it in his voice<br>  <br>  but I agree, Ricky Braddy was better than EVERYONE that night, including Danny.|`|rFZtQuV2aa	Danny has an excellent voice.<br>  Anoop can't stay on key.|`|H0yytifHaa	I think that danny was really good and he does have a great story.<br>  But i loved anoop!<br>  I really hope he comes back possibly with one the wildcards.<br>  I know my friend who  i called yelling about anoop was like i know!<br>  I hope he comes back !|`|6c953f70f670b1ca2a5eb5150f82e4cfaa	i really like danny and anoop. but i think that danny got the votes. it just depends on popularity. danny has a bigger fan base i guess.|`|Go4N4m8saa	I really miss Anoop, I hope they bring him back as a Wildcard.I like Danny too though.|`|032467f7118afdbd53ad18573df6ce42aa	Anoop was so much better I was so mad last night that he left

c8HHi3Wqaa	HALO strait up baby|`|ENspyhzUaa	star wars by far...making nerds everywhere have no life|`|uaq8OSUjaa	Star Wars is cooler..that's for sure|`|dShUF6A9aa	Um. I don't watch/play or whatever for both of them. But I would say that Star Wars is a bigger hit.<br>  <br>  How do I know how to view your rep on xbox 360?<br>  I don't know. Sorry. I don;t play xbox. But surprisingly, I like Guitar hero (I play on Medium/sometimes hard), and wii!|`|cLATPkjkaa	Dude Star Wars is just like Newtonian Mechanics.<br>  <br>  No matter how much better or technological you're gonna get, you're never gonna be able to discard Star wars...|`|4XXa7wBxaa	star Wars|`|5d1189c582f3d80c26b4e5e1eac98885aa	Star Wars, definitely|`|4rG1lYFLaa	to be honest i never really liked either one but i no Star Wars is much more popular|`|wxkIHCbLaa	star wars def betteh!
KU5SB6Tlaa	Legitimately...It.  The movie It is the scariest movie, like a horror movie.  The scariest true-story and crime movie is Helter Skelter about the Manson Murders.  It is crazy long, like 3 or 4 hours, and its scary the entire time! The movie "It" is freaky to a new dimension, it takes everyone's hesitance about clowns and turns it into a full scale phobia.  watch it.  You'll regret it.|`|urmhRHwxaa	It depends.  Generally, the scariest movie someone has seen is something they saw when they were very young.  The movie that scared me more than any other was "Darby O'Gill and the Little People", a really good fantasy movie Disney made in the late '50s.  It's not a horror film, but it deals with Irish folklore and includes a banshee, a coiste bodhar, and a dullahan (look them up).  I know a lot about special effects from that era and know that the FX were created with an optical printer, effects animation, and camera negatives, but it still scares me to this day.<br>  <br>  However, in general, the scariest movie would be "The Exorcist".|`|ndXvMLZ2aa	Yeah, I don't think there is a "scariest movie ever made". i haven't found any horror movie scary and I have seen the Exorcist and the Exorcism of Emily Rose too.|`|vsq9SW9Maa	"The Ring" or "The Shining"<br>  <br>  The girl in the Ring creeps me out and "The Shining" is all "other worldly" and has real ghosts and don't forget "REDRUM!!!"  Aaaaaaaggghhhhh!!!|`|52pZj3WFaa	The one that 'bothered' me, even during the daylight hours, was 28 Days Later.<br>  <br>  Frickin' zombies and their crazy ways!|`|mY4m47WTaa	The Thing (John Carpenter). Creepy, suspenseful, scary, gory (with great sfx). It's got it all.|`|6cYeNPzPaa	Personally I'd go with Poltergeist - I know a lot of it is cheesy, but when that clown disappears of the chair I had to leave the room|`|3dPwxPSGaa	I think its the exorcist, freaks you out|`|tLI94qWNaa	The scariest I have see would have to be the exorcism of emily rose.|`|mI4lrKdHaa	I have the answer. It is a long story. If you are to be invited to see this movie, you promise that under NO circumstances can you speak of it. My host made me sign a paper. I am old now and want to tell others, but after having the fear of talking always preying on my mind I still can't tell you. It is not an urban legend. Ask around the core of your city if you really want to see it..........cheers|`|hQWucH5uaa	THE HAUNTING (1964)<br>  <br>  Filmed in black & white, and not a drop of blood is spilled, this movie made me afraid of the dark for years.|`|XCVFEAC8aa	Supposedly it's The Exorcist!<br>  That's what everyone says!|`|BKybwvF5aa	In my opinion there are no scary movies.

HPqCRBq8aa	That was pretty deep. I would think that this person heart is broken and he/she doesn't know where to go or who to turn to. When that special someone came into their life, they healed their broken heart. And when they are together his esteem and confidence are elevated.<br>  <br>  I really like this verse.|`|GRa8dmx7aa	you make her feel safe<br>  you make her feel secure<br>  you are her hero and everything that she would like to be<br>  you are the wind beneath her wings?
fgNFgWUtaa	Not seen it myself but its rated quite high the plot is:<br>  <br>  Two teenage girls, Janie who is American and Lana who is Russian, fall in love after meeting at a t.A.T.u concert and are swept into a dangerous world of obsession, drug abuse and murder.<br>  Release date in the USA March 2009<br>  <br>  Mischa Barton plays Lana Starkova<br>  Shantel VanSanten plays Janie Sawyer<br>  <br>  Hope you enjoy it.
