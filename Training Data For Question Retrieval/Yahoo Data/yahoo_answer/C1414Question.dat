20071227122545AAnl54A	Social Science;Psychology	?causamos muertes??	Desde peque?os nos han dicho que consumir leche es algo sano e imprescindible; incluso, algunos van más allá diciendo que si no consumimos leche y sus derivados estamos en un grave riesgo de padecer enfermedades que nos pueden llevar hasta una completa desnutrición y futura muerte. Toda esta teoría se refuerza aún más si le sumamos los millones y millones de dólares que invierten las empresas involucradas en la Industria Láctea en todo tipo de publicidad: televisión, radio, letreros, gigantografías, internet, etc. (solo es cosa de recordar la fuerte campa?a publicitaria en que aparecían famosos diciendo "yo tomo leche"). Sin quedarse conformes con la inversión en publicidad, destinan recursos para pagarle a sospechosos (por decir lo menos) médicos para que salgan en los spots informándonos sobre el nuevo producto de tal o cual empresa lechera.      Existe una inversión millonaria desde hace ya un buen tiempo por parte de estos grupos económicos que se benefician del consumo del consumo de lácteos. ?Qué busca esta gran inversión?, pues bien, cubrir un objetivo esencial: la desinformación sistemática de la sociedad respecto a las carentes propiedades nutritivas de la leche, los elevados índices de toxinas que presentan y la verdad respecto a las crueles prácticas de las actuales Industrias Lecheras.         La vida de una vaca lechera      Mientras que los medios de comunicación nos siguen mostrando la hipócrita imagen de que las vacas lecheras viven libremente en las praderas, felices junto a sus crías pastando en la tranquilidad de las monta?as (como ciertos spots televisivos), todas ellas son criadas en deplorables condiciones: hacinamiento, suciedad, orde?o intensivo, mala alimentación, embarazos forzados, administración de hormonas, antibióticos y tranquilizantes, etc. La vaca lechera moderna es criada, alimentada, medicada, inseminada y manipulada para un solo fin: producir más y más leche.      Producto del desarrollo tecnológico, actualmente ya no se utiliza el "orde?o manual" , sino que el llamado "orde?o mecánico", el cual permite orde?ar a los animales 2 ó 3 veces al día, de esta forma la producción media de una vaca de granja intensiva alcanza aproximadamente unos 4.000 litros anuales, y sin conformarse la industria sigue buscando nuevos procedimientos para aumentar estas cifras.      Este sistema excesivo además de ser muy doloroso y molesto, provoca heridas, inflamación e infecciones en las ubres, lo cual obliga a la industria a administrar medicamentos y antibióticos; los cuales permanecerán en el vaso de leche que usted ha de beber.      En su estado normal, las vacas no dan leche todo el tiempo (como es la creencia de muchas personas). Las vacas tienen que parir para producir leche, leche que debería ser el alimento de su cría. Sin embargo, para mantener elevada la producción de leche, las industrias fuerzan a las vacas a tener un embarazo cada a?o. Esto se hace porque tras el parto la producción es máxima y podrá ser orde?ada intensivamente durante aproximadamente 10 meses hasta el siguiente embarazo. Lo anterior se realiza mediante inseminación artificial o por implante de embrión.      Por otro lado, los terneros son separados del lado de sus madres apenas nacen, lo que les causa a ambos una profunda depresión.      Los terneros son encerrados en corrales especiales con suelo de cemento o metal. Sus jaulas solo les permiten estar de pie o estirados, ni siquiera pueden darse la vuelta. Estos terneros son mal nutridos y la mayoría padece anemia ; no se les permite moverse, ya que si hicieran ejercicio y se alimentaran de mejor forma, la carne para servir en el plato se tornaría más oscura y dura , por supuesto, esto es lo último que desearía el productor.      Para obtener un ternero gordo y débil en el menor tiempo posible, el productor lo alimentara con una dieta líquida deficiente en hierro y basada en una combinación de leche en polvo y aditivos (cuando en realidad debería alimentarse de pastizales).      El único día en que abandonarán sus celdas, será el día en que serán puestos en un camión directo al matadero.      Por último, cuando desciende la productividad lechera de la vaca, lo cual sucede aproximadamente tras 4 o 5 lactancias, y en oposición a su esperanza de vida de 20 - 25 a?os, serán enviadas al matadero luego de su dolorosa existencia, para que sus maltrechos y enfermos cuerpos se transformen en un trozo de carne para servir en el plato de algún comensal (de hecho, aproximadamente el 70% de la carne de vacuno procede de vacas lecheras), transformar sus restos (huesos, tendones, vísceras varias, etc.) en unas deliciosas vienesas o hamburguesas y, para sacarle el máximo provecho, sacarles el pellejo estando muchas aún conscientes para así elaborar cuero para vestir.      Ya en el matadero, el procedimiento es similar al de cualquier animal de engorde; es decir, serán colgadas de una sola pata con cadenas boca abajo, luego se les hará una peque?a perforación en la garganta para que se desangren lentamente.      Te preguntarás por qué se usa este método, ?simple!, cuando los animales entran a un matadero presienten lo que les va a suceder, ?cómo?, sienten el olor a putrefacción y sangre que ronda el lugar, y mientras están en fila esperando su hora, escuchan los desesperados gritos de dolor y horror que emiten sus compa?eras que en ese momento están siendo desangradas y mutiladas estando la mayoría aún concientes. Ante esto, el animal que espera en la fila apreta fuertemente sus músculos de puro miedo y terror. Obviamente, el empresario no va a entregar carnes "duras" a los consumidores, por esta razón es que cuelgan a los animales boca abajo y les hacen un peque?o orificio en la garganta para que poco a poco vayan perdiendo el conocimiento producto del desangramiento (sangre que también se aprovechara para elaborar las tradicionales "prietas" o el conocido "niachi"); de esta forma, los animales mueren con sus músculos "sueltos y blanditos" para ser degustados por algún aficionado al consumo de cadáveres.      Cada vez que compras productos lácteos y en el envase se observa el nombre de alguna marca, sea cual sea ésta, siempre, en todo Chile o en cualquier parte del mundo, ese producto procederá de los procesos industriales anteriormente descritos. Sería ingenuo que cuando compras un yogur en el kiosco de la esquina pensaras que esa leche proviene de vacas libres pastando en la pradera y felices junto a sus crías.      Probablemente, si viajas a un sector muy rural puedas encontrar algunos fundos con unas cuantas vacas que no son tratadas como en las grandes factorías. Pero, así incluso, no puedes dejar de preguntarte si es ético consumir un producto que fue hecho para otros fines. LAS VACAS PRODUCEN LECHE PARA SUS CRíAS, NO PARA LOS HUMANOS. ?Por qué tanta resistencia a comprender este principio básico de la naturaleza? ?Tan idiota y egoísta es nuestra especie? ?Acaso ya dejamos de pensar y reflexionar?... Por el momento, aún tenemos esperanzas de que podemos mejorar y cambiar nuestras actitudes cotidianas entre nosotros y con nuestro entorno. Esta en nuestras manos, no en la de los políticos.               Ya lo sabes, cada vez que consumes leche y/o sus derivados, estás financiando el sufrimiento y muerte de millones de vacas y sus inocentes terneros. En efecto, consumir lácteos tiene las mismas implicancias (e incluso peores) que consumir un trozo de carne, que tambien esta mal comer carne.            y si decis del calcio os pongo esto:         Alimentos Ricos en Calcio (6 a 8 raciones):   brócoli, espinacas, leche de soja enriquecida, tofu, margarinas vegetales, zumo de naranja enriquecido con calcio, higos secos, sésamo, tahini, melaza, etc.      ?Qué cuenta como una ración de alimentos ricos en calcio?   1/2 vaso (120 ml) de leche de soja enriquecida   1/4 vaso (60 ml) de tofu enriquecido   1/2 vaso (120 ml) de zumo de naranja enriquecido.   1/4 vaso (60 ml) de almendras   3 cucharadas (45 ml) de mantequilla de almendra   2 cucharadas (30 ml) de sésamo   1 vaso (240 ml) de vegetales verdes ricos en calcio (brócoli,col, espinacas, coles, berros, etc.) cocinados o 2 vasos (480 ml) si son crudos.   1 vaso (240 ml) de legumbres ricas en calcio (soja,   1/4 vaso (60 ml) de algas secas   1 cucharada (15 ml) de melaza   5 higos secos      Muchos de estos alimentos son comunes a otros grupos (como el de vegetales y legumbres). Incluye alimentos ricos en calcio en cada comida.

20081001171703AA1jAqX	Social Science;Psychology	GUYS, TRANSLATION PLEASE!!!!!!?(GIRLS TOO...I know you'd read it either way lol) please help me out....?	YES THIS IS LONG SO IF YOU'RE NOT MATURE ENOUGH TO READ IT DON'T BOTHER ANSWERING.   it's a long story, I'll try to make it short.   I'm a junior in high school.   8th grade- we saw each other for the first time. I've never had a guy look at me like that before/never had eye contact like that. it was magnetic...kind of hypnotic like we were the only two people in the room for a couple of seconds. I didn't want to look away. he was with his friends. I was with mine. we did that for about two hours (not two hours straight) we would see each other and make that eye contact for two hours. my friend and I left.      next time he saw me was a year later at high school (9th grade). he would do this thing where he would stare at me and look away when I looked back (lol). he did that from about january to the end of the year. I had changed a lot though. I was depressed/anti social. we didn't have classes together so we never spoke to each other but he would do that every time we saw each other in the hallway.      10th grade. first day of school...I'm thinking "he doesn't like me anymore. it's been a year." I have my schedule and I'm looking down on it, I look up and he's staring at me. I felt my eyes get big lol. so he would give me that really deep stare, tingly nice warm feeling eye contact every time he saw me in the hallway. I was realllly shy so I would acknowledge him then look away. I didn't want him to think I was rejecting him, but at the time I didn't know how to respond.      grade 11- Junior year. at first he would act like I wasn't there. he would look mean/cold around me. it's weird how we have no classes with each other and have never even spoken to each other, but we'll be walking in the hallway and walk right past each other...like right next to eachother. anyway, we did that and he looked at me all obvious, I just looked back then looked away.   I figured he either lost interest or felt like I rejected him. my attitude is take it or leave it...I don't want to be all upset like "man I blew it" (how I was for a while) over some guy I don't even know. anyhow....coincidentally (what else is new), I was leaving 7th pd to go to the guidance office, I walked out of my room and I look up and he's in front of me a few feet away...we could have walked into each other (weird huh) he would look at me and look away like 4 times. I just kept walking because it was kind of awkward.      I'm hoping you can give me some insight into how he feels/what he thinks about this whole thing?? it would realllly help and I appreciate the help!

Everyone has seemingly crazy tendencies/subroutines that don't qualify as mental problems, but baffle and amuse us anyway! Tell me yours, it's fun.      Here's mine:         I often picture the world from above. I see agglomerations of specks(people, cars) moving around the city. This is very sobering. It makes me ponder about the uselessness of human existence in the universe.   Also, I'm paranoid of various cataclysmic disasters. I would never move to the coast for fear of giant tsunamis. In fact, I spend as little time as possible in coastal regions. If I can avoid them altogether, I'm a happy person! Whenever I see streaks in the sky(clouds or airplane trails), I imagine them to be smoky trails left by an asteroid that just hit somewhere across the ocean. And when I enter a room(this mostly applies to bathroom stalls), I carefully scan the walls and grooves in the ceiling for hidden cameras. Especially the light fixtures and vents.

20090226105617AAXTqrY	Social Science;Sociology	Why are we responsible for protecting people that cannot or will  not protect themselves?	Let's start with the fact that I have a huge amount of respect for anyone that is willing to put their life on the line in defense of another.      My question is this, why shouldn't people be responsible for protecting themselves?      I am neither a thug nor a convicted felon. I work extremely hard to get everything that my family and I have, so I am in no way looking to victimize anyone whatsoever, and still I am no respecter of the law. I respect God, but not the law due to the fact that it is so corrupt.      I would also like to point out that the police cannot help you until you are already a victim.      I have never called for police assistance and I never will. I know what it is to put my life on the line at work and have survived more than most here would believe...that is why I ask, why is it my responsibility to spend my tax dollars protecting people that cannot or will not protect themselves?      It is my responsibility and my responsibi

20090226120354AA7lEyp	Social Science;Gender & Women's Studies	To all the guys out there?	Me and this man had history. We have both been trying to mend our friendship but its awkward. He hurt me, I woudnt tell him I loved him etc. Today I am with him in work, he talks to every woman bar me and is kind and considerate to them. Me he is OK with but ignores a bit and when we do talk he is distant. He chats up these girls in front of me, I say how well they look, he gets annoyed/ sharp with me. Then this other male friend comes along, sees me there and my guy behind me and smiles deeply at me for a long time, so I actually have to say 'what's up'? and says you are better looking than any of the girls in here. I get embarrassed, the guy I like walks away. Moments later the guy I like touches my arm to ask me something, I respond without thinking and put my arm around him. Then he touches a younger woman in front of me with the same intimacy. Later he sees me and avoids me. Later again, he talks to a woman he told me before was not sexy and who is not into him and is all familiar with her, but as I pass he asks me if I am OK. Am I in the friend zone? Why did my other male friend do that really complimentary thing for me, saying I was nice looking in front of my fella. He never says things like that this male friend. It was all weird.the guy I like is a total confident with women, big time.
20090226120802AAFSuK1	Social Science;Psychology	To all the guys out there?	Me and this man had history. We have both been trying to mend our friendship but its awkward. He hurt me, I woudnt tell him I loved him etc. Today I am with him in work, he talks to every woman bar me and is kind and considerate to them. Me he is OK with but ignores a bit and when we do talk he is distant. He chats up these girls in front of me, I say how well they look, he gets annoyed/ sharp with me. Then this other male friend comes along, sees me there and my guy behind me and smiles deeply at me for a long time, so I actually have to say 'what's up'? and says you are better looking than any of the girls in here. I get embarrassed, the guy I like walks away. Moments later the guy I like touches my arm to ask me something, I respond without thinking and put my arm around him. Then he touches a younger woman in front of me with the same intimacy. Later he sees me and avoids me.

20090226110710AA7oCtn	Social Science;Other - Social Science	Why do people think that I'm a "goody goody", just because I refuse to gossip with them?	I'm a friendly fellow, and I'm happy to stop and spend a few minutes with you to discuss the general things in life -- weather, sports, movies, music, and so on.      When the "conversation" turns to talking smack about others, and backstabbing, whispering, drama, and gossip, then I want nothing to do with it . . . and I'll tell you that.      So, why am I being attacked for minding my own business? Some people actually think it's a character flaw when you don't enjoy gossip.      (By the way . . . if you answer with "you're gossipping about gossippers", I will report you.)

Okay so basically I can't talk to people outside my family - especially people my own age (Im 13) like classmates. I just can't build up enough courage to talk and when people talk to me all I can say is "yeah" "no" "erm" and stuff like that. This is why I dont have many friends.   I desperately want to be like a normal 13 year old girl - have fun, parties, sleepovers, boyfriends, friends, etc. How can I overcome my fears?

20090226113136AA0UAbr	Social Science;Dream Interpretation	One way weird dream, please try and explain?	In my dream me and a group of workers (5 or 6) were traveling for training purposes.  A girl who I barely know and maybe say "hi" to every once in a while was one of the co-workers in my dream.  Anyways, somehow our company had accidently booked her and I in the same hotel room.  When we first got to the room, she was blonde.  We looked at each other and said "at last we can be alone and finally have sex".  I laid face down on the bed and she got on top of me, but now her hair changed to long black hair and she wore black lingerie.  I was naked.  I then turned over and placed her to my side, but she changed back to the blonde version, but fully dressed conservatively.  I told her that I couldn't have sex with her because I didn't know her and her life style.  I told her that I would have to use a condom.  She said "Don't worry, that she had one with her" and she brought one out and opened it up.  As I tried to put it on my stuff, I noticed that the condom was large and pink.  I'm not trying to brag, but I'm fairly well hung in real life, but the condom was just way too big (about the size of a zip lock bag but condom shaped and pink).  I recall that I couldn't get my stuff in the condom without it slipping off.  Then I don't remember what happened.  Can someone put some sense to this dream?

20090226111346AAMMYCO	Social Science;Sociology	Ok, so I go to college, and there is a group of 30+ people who act like 16...?	you know, they're the ones with the attitudes like, "we're the in people, and everyone else is below our levels". Anyways, they were talking badly about one person, and then decided that person was too boring, so then they started talking about me. I hear things coming out of their mouths to cut me down about my work ethics, (lord knows I have a better GPA than them, but that's another issue), and the make comments when I ask the teacher any questions. Since I haven't had to put up with this since I was in highschool, (and I go to school with 17-18 year olds that have more class), I was wondering what your take on this situation is? Is there anything you would do besides the obvious desire to punch them in the jaw?

20090226113156AA8p3DA	Social Science;Dream Interpretation	Dream interpretation about half eagle/ half owl?	Last night I had a dream that I stepped out of my car and looked up at the stars. There was a school across the street and I ended up standing at it's recreation field. After a few minutes of looking at the sky, I noticed a bird on an old leaveless tree. Like a tree from a scary movie. Hooting like an owl, It was black and white like an eagle, but it changed it's face from an owl to an eagle after it would hoot.       Then to my surprise it flew down to me. I ended up tripping and falling and couldn't get up. But it then changed it's face to an eagle and started to try to rub it's face on me like a cat, when I reached for it, it flapped it's wings and started to try to lick my hands or something.      It was weird, and I was terrified but curious about why it presented itself as an owl and then an eagle. Thanks if you can interpret this.

I’ve also been smoking a lot and I often feel like drinking or taking pills, so that I can escape. My days just feel so boring and I just don’t feel like being in reality. I just don’t want to live, I guess. All I want to do is be in my room and go on Face book. I often feel like killing myself. I am really lonely as well. I have trouble concentrating at school and I am always tired, but when it comes to bed time I don’t want to sleep. I don’t feel like doing anything. I can’t tell my mother about this b/c I am her support. And my best friend moved away 2 months ago. I just don’t know what to do anymore. Maybe this is just a phase, I don’t know. But am I just so depressed all the time.

20090226120953AAg8yUu	Social Science;Psychology	How can you respect someone with no self-respect? How can you follow the advice of someone...?	I used to respect my mom in so many ways. She was my hero. I am now 17 and have lost most respect for her. When I was 9, I found out my mom was pregnant. I never met this man before and out of nowhere he lived with us. My mom knew him for 10 years before getting pregnant. He went to jail after a few months of living with us. When he got out of jail, he stayed with us for a year. He cheated on my mom with his ex, wouldn't allow me to see my dad, beat all of his kids except my little sister and me, and was an asshole. My mom treated me like I was a piece of garbage while he stayed with us. Of course, I rebelled at 11 and got into drugs and ran the streets. They split up because she was tired of his cheating. They got into physical altercations in front of us when he was moving out.      For about a year, my mom was constantly drinking, smoking marijuana, and generally being a horrible mom. I forgave her for that, though. She eventually got over it and seemed to be a super-human to me.       My little sister is getting ready to turn 7 now. Her dad is in and out of her life, seeing her at most twice a year. Tuesday he shows up crying to my mom begging her to forgive him. He is getting ready to go back to jail again. The same girl he was cheating on my mom with pressed charges against him for hitting their son. Now he is staying with us again. For the past 2 days, I have been alone with him for a total of 16 hours. She told me to get over myself when I told her I was not comfortable with it, even though I pay rent at 17.      Tonight will be the third night he is "staying the night" and I know she is having sex with him and it's disgusting. She told me "I haven't gotten any is 3 years" and it makes me sick to my stomach the way she acts in front of him.       I have not gotten 5 minutes alone with her in the last few days. I have no respect for her anymore.   She tells me not to date bad men yet she does it herself and then demands respect when I feel she doesn't deserve it. I'm just so frustrated and I know she's going to turn into the horrible mom again.       How can you respect someone with no self-respect? How can you follow the advice of someone that is a hypocrite? Any advice on what I should do? Thanks!   =[
20090226123753AAqbnRS	Social Science;Psychology	How do you properly deal with this?	First of all read all of this before answering.  Second of all, I'm 24 I live out in the country, I don't know how to drive because I can't.  So my friends or mom take me to church or bible study.  That's the only social activity I get.  All the men in my church are married.  ALL of them! I do not work because I'd have to drive somewhere to work.  So again I don't drive and don't know how and my parents won't let me(which is fine).      I don't know any single guys and I don't have any single friends.      Sometimes though I get lonely for some male affection and cuddling.  That's impossible because I live in the middle of nowhere and don't drive and the people at my church are married.      In a year and a half if I do get accepted at a college I will move to Chicago.  But until then how do I deal with this lonliness and desire to cuddle with a single guy?

20090225111252AAHGDw3	Social Science;Psychology	What is wrong with my friend?? Its long btw.?	Alright one of my friends acts easy/slutty to me, but maybe I am way too into it. Anyways almost every time she has a bf (she has a new one every month or every other month basically) she sleeps with them on the 1st or 2nd date.       Then after a few weeks the guy either becomes a jerk to her, or cheats or her or becomes weird and they break up. After this happens she says "next time i wont sleep with the guy until the relationship has gone far and we both have a strong connection to each other" Or something like that she'll say.       However when she meets another guy, she doesn't keep her word and the same situation happens. My friend says she wants a guy who is romantic, kind and going to treat her with a respect and like a princess, but how is she going to find a guy like that if on the first date she screwing them?!. So anyways recently my friend with out with this guy, lets call him BOB, about last week. I just thought they went on a date and kissed (thats what she told me last week)       Now last night me and her were talking and I asked how her and BOB were doing (there not dating, they just talk to eachother once and a while, but last week was her 2nd time seeing him) anyways she said that they have an attraction to eachother but not a connection, and I told her "well maybe the connection will grow" (trying to be nice) and thats when she told me "idk, but the sex was good"        Her reason for having sex with him to me was stupid. It was because he drove her home and she wanted to reward him. Wtf reward him?! You dont gotta screw him, just give the dude a hug and say thanks for the ride. Geez. I told her that she should respect her self and all the good stuff. She says she does respect her self and does agree with me, but I think she's lying and doesnt respect herself in that way.       They did it in the car too, and when I told her why not do it in a bed or couch like other ppl, they couldnt cause both houses werent empty. I mean she told me she has some hormones problems but geez a car, how low can you get?! I asked her something like well wouldnt you want it to be special?(the sex, the person) and she was like yea but were not married so it doesnt really matter.        I was mad at her and a little dissapointed, but its her life not mine. Also she has had 2 or 3 pregnancy scares in the past year-year and half.       So my questions are:  Does my friend know that she is acting easy and why do you think she acts like this? Do you think its for attention? she's pretty but a little on the chubby side and she told me when she was in middle school she was bulimic (I've seen a pic and she was thin) but since i've known her we met eachother at 14/15 yrs old she was chubby. Could that have something to do with how she acts around guys?      My friend is 18 btw and i've known her for a few years and since I known her she's been like this. I'm 19 btw if that matters.      Sorry its so long. I guess i'm just concerned.

20090226121728AA2zgqn	Social Science;Dream Interpretation	I need Jonas Brothers dream interpretation.Best answer 10 points!?	I had a dream where i went to one of their signings in Sweden.The first one i came across was Joe and i asked him for his autograph.He ignored me for like 5 minutes and after that he signed on a scrap paper then threw it at me without even looking at me.I passed him and then i met Demi Lovato.She just gave me a paper and told me t sign her own autograph which was strange.After that i was hoping i would meet Nick but then i heard that he didn't come.(I thought it was because of me)Kevin was better than all because he actually said hi to me and gave me his autograph.But he wasn't that warm as i thought he would be.Then just before i went i heard Joe saying that he will never come to Sweden because they don't have great fans and i felt that he was directing his attention on me.      Do the JB hate fans that are not from the US or are they international?      It is just that last time i missed their concert because i thought they would be disgusted of me.I am not a cool girl.I am so plain and not up to their standards.So after i missed their concert i cried for 3 consecutive days and nights.This time if they come i wont miss it.So i am checking sites on how to be accepted by the JB.Please help me plus wht does my dream mean.

20090225111650AAf2TR4	Social Science;Psychology	Being bullied, ignored, taken advantage of?	im a boy. Im in 3rd year at school, i am naturally quiet and don't talk alot, I don't say a bad thing to anyone however I still get taken advantage of, am constantly ignored- even by the few people I talk to, and have snide things said about me. From what has happended, the people who this are all either picked on themselves, insecure, try to look good or idiots who can't take it when people insult them. Im not physically imposing- just about average height, skinny build- im a good runner and in decent shape. I don't really say much but sometimes when I do talk it is absolute crap that comes out.   After every day I have so much hate and anger inside me. The funny thing is a lot of people would not say that they didn't like like but still I get treated that way.      What can I do about it- Im not going to fight because that would result in me being beaten up. Has anyone else experienced this? Also I know about everyones weak points in their mind but don't exploit them? What can I say or do besides snitching.      One more thing is I filmed myself making Nitroglycerin and setting it off in my garden- someone found the video and a few people now call me a terrorist, how can I let this die?
20090225111001AAc7oUA	Social Science;Psychology	How can I learn to think faster?	I think something is seriously wrong with my brain because I don't process information quickly enough. However, I do have a great memory for information and could remember things very well, which is why I always do good in school, especially on tests. But whenever I have to be in a situation where there's new information and I have to think fast, I feel as though my mind can't process it quick enough. Sometimes I just feel kind of dumb to be honest. Are there any ways I can learn how to think quicker?

In that night,I woke up from my bed,then I was doing something and then I went back to bed.Then,I had a dream...In the beginning of that dream I was speeding in a fast car(like Mclaren F1 or Koenigsegg ccx).At first I viewed it from the bumper of the car,seeing only the road,then it changed to first person view,and I was able to see the cockpit of the car,I've seen my own hands.I was using the steering wheel and then I saw myself shifting a gear.I was going on a road that went upwise and then I was going on a cranky road,turning left and right multiple times,then I arrived at place.It looked like a big cave or something,and then I saw my hands.I saw that I have gloves on my hands,and then I had a vision like if I have consumed hallucinogens.Then I screamed:This is a dream!And then I said:This is a wake back to bed lucid dream.Cool!So now I'm in a lucid dream.Then I went deeper in that cave and then I saw something like an Aurora.And then,I don't remember...I think it ended there.But I know I used to turn around sometimes in the dream because I know that if you turn around in a lucid dream you try to prevent it from ending.

Does consumer difference make it shift and product price and demand (i think) make it simply move?
