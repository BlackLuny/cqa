55NKPb82aa	In September 2003, then President Bush proposed that oversight of Fannie Mae be tightened. Congressional Democrats balked at the idea and vigorously opposed and blocked it. Then, in a 2006 bill, Senate Republicans created a bill calling for oversight of the Democrat-run corrupt Fannie Mae (and its partner organization Freddie Mac) US mortgage giant. At that time, those who ran Fannie Mae (again—ALL Democrats) had already been caught in an $11 billion accounting scandal. Tragically—for all of us—this bill was shelved.|`|TeJWqCL6aa	Everthing they alledgely did wrong was first told to Pelosi and that<br>  ilk,|`|MEReSvZeaa	He tried to reform social security, and the interest groups and minority democrats in Congress stopped him.<br>  <br>  The US Supreme Court reversed some of his decisions, including one very important one regarding the giving of terror war prisoners the rights of US citizens, though they did nothing to earn or deserve them.|`|1219d6000cca01c9f3c4489d1c7b4a16aa	It worked the same as it always did.<br>  <br>  When Democrats took over the house, they tried to check the president's power by putting a timetable in a war funding bill.  They eventually lost that battle, and consequently, we're winning the campaign in Iraq, probably because we didn't subscribe to arbitrary timelines that weren't based on progress.<br>  <br>  The supreme court, including justices appointed by Bush, overruled his authority on several cases involving detainees.|`|oBmLIDHtaa	Yes, the way it worked under Bush, was that the president would want to do something (say - invade iraq, for example), and the republican run house/senate would overwhelmingly vote to give the president the go-ahead to do whatever it was he wanted to do - with minimal oversight, and massive funding.<br>  <br>  They appropriated hundreds upon hundreds of billions of dollars (hidden from the budget to make it look 'balanced') in order to fund the Iraq war - and now when people suggest that we appropriate some money to help out America, they all freak out and scream 'socialism'.<br>  <br>  It's time to wake the hell up people - no amount of taxpayer money is too much when it comes to funding their PNAC pipe dreams of world domination - but when it comes to decent hardworking americans who can't afford their mortgage - the GOP says 'go screw yourself'.|`|DB7UMkGCaa	ogreat writes: "Bush wrote the checks and is leaving the balancing to Obama"<br>  <br>  Baloney. The President cannot write one single check. The purse strings are held and controlled by congress. Congress writes the checks.|`|FDVuAiHOaa	LOL<br>  <br>  That's like asking for an example of moderation during Mardi Gras!|`|sI3kqp7xaa	When McCain and other republicans warned of the problems with Fannie and Freddie, but the Democrats turned it into a racial issue.<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_MGT_cSi7Rs" rel="nofollow">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_MGT_cSi7...</a>|`|gMxtD2Xoaa	a lot of that was side stepped<br>  ..with the patriot act and executive orders<br>  <br>  <br>  they didn't work...following the rules is for suckers and poor folk|`|0jLL9GIsaa	You can't say the boy didn't try!|`|ZXkOQapLaa	Bush wrote the checks and is leaving the balancing to Obama.

3h37vetbaa	Yes, I think they're exactly the same.|`|VG4r3miJaa	If you are refering to limbaugh's coment, you need the listen to the whole remark.. he went on to explain that it's the socialistic policies that he wants to fail.  Of coarse somebody could want socialist policies fail if they are bad for America|`|cIIR0fEgaa	Obama is not the counrty.  The country is one thing.  Obama is another.  Obama is not doing the right things for our country.  So needless to say we want him to fail and the country to be safe.|`|sI3kqp7xaa	Acknowledge the entire quote!<br>  <br>  I want Obama to fail at implementing his Socialist agenda.<br>  <br>  If he fails at that, it will be very good for the country.|`|QDpQTwyFaa	i want him to fail bad. i want this country to rise up and question everything, not lay down and take things for the way they are|`|0jLL9GIsaa	Long weekend huh? You just getting up?|`|8ivnzNi5aa	No.  The Obama agenda is un-American.<br>  <br>  Learn to hate.  Love is for the naive.|`|TeJWqCL6aa	No but Dems can say what they want, spend what they want,|`|AA11424005	No.  If you are referring to Rush Limbaugh, try to get the quote straight.  Rush said (and I agree) that he wanted to see Obama's policies fail.  Obama is promoting socialism.  I don't want socialism in any form.  I want freedom.<br>  <br>  If Obama's policies fail, it will be good for America.  We will be able to keep what little freedom we have left.|`|tP8W6Q1Qaa	Not at all... How many people wanted to see Bush Fail especially in Iraq... they were not being unpatriotic they were expressing what they saw being the best in America.<br>  <br>  I see Obama absolutely destroying the free market and if you look at the Dow Jones he is doing just that... Because someone wants his policies to fail just like they wanted Bushes policies to fail doesn't mean they want to see America fail.|`|1ce25e71aa4dd2eb1e82121617a06b87aa	I want Obama's plan to fail and America to succeed.<br>  <br>  So there IS a difference.<br>  <br>  Liberals wanted Bush to fail.<br>  <br>  I will never forget or FORGIVE the Liberals for their un-American behavior.|`|WCkOUF9aaa	No. Its even spelled differently.<br>  <br>  So you bashing Bush for 8 years was wrong of you then?|`|oMOiAFRBaa	Obama succeeding in implementing his plans for America is mutually exclusive for America succeeding at being a safe and prosperous nation - you can have either one or the other, but not both.  You do the math.<br>  <br>  Personally, I hope Obama's plans for America fail to get implemented, but it doesn't look like that will be the case, which means that our country will fail.|`|e51f6062bd000eff36008f1173cf7d70aa	If you listen to people talk...you will hear that they do not want the country to fail, they want these policies to fail...why, because they go against every principle that made the country strong in the first place....they mean more government and less individual responsibility....that is what I  mean when I say, I hope these things fail, not because I want the country to fail, but becuase then we can get back to things that make people accountable for their own actions and put people back in control of thier lives.  Some of these things are capping salaries for CEOs....NO NO NO, unless they receive bail out money....if their company recieves bailout money then cap them, if not, what right do we have to tell a company what they can pay management.  Of the gov wanting to bail out homeowners who should not have gotten the loan for thier home in the first place bacause you can't afford a 200,000 dollar home on a 60,000 dollar a year house hold income.  We have to get away from trying to please everyone all the time because it won't happen....we have to make most happy, and give the ones we can't a chance to change, or do something about it.  We have to many winny babies in this country now.|`|K1iUzewyaa	no, it's the exact opposite.. wanting Obama to fail means the US is stronger than ever, and rejected his plan for socialism.. so, to want Obama to fail, means you want the US to thrive.. unless you want to be likened to Cuba... Obama doesn't care about our economy, he wants to implement his ideology. This ideology could only be thought up by someone with dual loyalties...|`|gMxtD2Xoaa	yes it is<br>  <br>  because being right trumps all....where else would i get all my righteous indignation from<br>  <br>  this is the real problem that party politics have become more important than the overall well being of our country.......<br>  <br>  remember a house divided....<br>  <br>  listen to OTTO<br>  <br>  there is no longer a difference between the two.....<br>  the dempublicans... two count em two parties that taste like one.....|`|n2kBUWQOaa	No, it is not the same thing.<br>  Use a little bit of reasoning. Please, and stop trying to read into it more than you have already, you might get a nose bleed or something.|`|sbzVj7wQaa	NO<br>  Because Republicans want Obama's socialist policy's to fail.<br>  <br>  just like Dem's want Republican ideas to fail.<br>  <br>  Its pretty easy to understand if you guys stop watching kieth Olberman|`|0d6d73c79e6856ec69bb6c658154c1ccaa	Nope it is an opinion about the man and has nothing to do with the country A little time in the class room will show that congress makes the rules and here is the kicker....ready,.....ready,.... congress if chock full of libs|`|1fxHHrWIaa	No. I don't want a Neo-Marxist government so why would I support this one? Pretty simple.
ILgk3OLOaa	What's wrong TuTu, did your girl leave you for a Marine, or because of that laughing stock you call a dick?|`|tROFU72waa	The 75th Ranger Regiment has it's own Sniper Section per Battalion.  That means that there are 3 Sniper Sections within the 75th Ranger Regiment.  If you make it to the Rangers, then you'll have to try out for the Sniper Section within the 1st, 2nd, or 3rd Battalion.  Once you've made it, you will attend two different Sniper schools at minimum, the Basic Sniper Course(B4) at Ft. Benning, GA and the SOTIC(Special Operations Target Interdiction Course) held at Ft. Bragg, NC.  <br>  <br>  Should you go to the Marines and be a Sniper?  If you want to be a Sniper in the Marine Corps then by all means please give it a shot.  Both paths are roughly the same in that there's a Sniper Platoon per Battalion and you'll have to try out for STA(Surveillance Target Acquisition).  The US Marine Scout Sniper School is indeed a better Sniper Course than the US Army basic course as it is much more indepth.  The Marine job that is much like the US Army Rangers would be in their MARSOC(Marine Special Operations Command) community.  Again, a community you'll have to try out for and make through an indoctrination process. <br>  <br>  Regardless of what you choose, you're in for a very difficult ride and I wish you the best of luck.|`|JDAbWnJraa	Yes, there are snipers within the Ranger Battalions. That is something you're going to need to prove yourself worthy of. Just as you will not get a slot for Ranger school unless you can prove that you stand a reasonable chance of making it, you will not just be handed a sniper slot. These schools are so specialized, have so few slots and such high wash-out rates, you're going to need to do a lot more than just want to be a badazz.... You're going to have to BE a badazz. That's the best I can tell you man. If you are slotted to go to a Battalion after 11B AIT, enjoy RIP and keep a positive attitude dude.|`|n2oEhdZiaa	Seriously dude, how do you react when you see that window off to the side and it says something like "Oops!  It looks like you have 37 misspelling(s)!"  Just let the computer fix it for you.|`|Cb9O7ycPaa	//I want to be in the military and be a bad ***.//<br>  <br>  Save yourself the trouble and go Army. We don't need that sh!t in our Corps.<br>  <br>  If you want to be a Scout Sniper in the Marine Corps. Go infantry and then if you get lucky, you might get a chance to go to scout sniper school.|`|pN0EOoepaa	OMG your *** is going to smoked at fort benning...Good luck!<br>  <br>  Being a sniper is not a bad ***, your an idiot; its a skill and they go through intense training. You must be invited to join the sniper unit, you just dont choose sniper school and go. My brother already looked into sniper and its by invitation only. Also upon graduation less than half actually graduate.|`|4uike3ARaa	I grew up shooting, and am counted a very good shot, but nowhere near good enough to even think about being a sniper, or on one of the service shooting teams.<br>  If you're not already an expert shot, I suggest you think about doing something else.<br>  <br>  I think you need to worry more about qualifying for any position in the military, based on the wording, spelling, and grammar in your question.<br>  But good luck. If you're a good enough shot during basic weapons qualifications, someone will notice you.|`|pYRZcfsJaa	If you are leaving March 30th you should already know what the **** you are doing! you can't just magically switch right before you leave, are you already going into the Marines?<br>  <br>  and yes, rangers have snipers. Marine Recon (not force recon) is like the rangers (light shock troops)... from what I've heard Marine Force Recon is like Navy SEALs or something similar.<br>  <br>  It might be a little late to quit and resign now... you could try to serve your time in the Army and then switch to Marines or try for rangers... either way, good luck.|`|ru5Ydn42aa	Yes, you can be a sniper as a ranger.  that is a school you ask for once you are already in your unit|`|GgG0inaUaa	Stick with the Army you will do better there.

Ideally you should have got a proof of posting from the post office, but if they really take you to court you just need to provide as much evidence as you can and hope the judge believes you. For example, a copy of the letter, a witness to you posting it etc.<br>  <br>  But I can almost guarantee they won't. The amount you owe simply will not be enough to make it worthwhile for the gym because they cannot claim costs against you in the small claims court.<br>  <br>  Stick to your guns that you cancelled on a certain date. Agree to pay everything up to that date but not after. Usually the debt collectors are only interested in the easy pickings, so if you tell them the amount is disputed they will back off.
mxXwQRfxaa	As a republican, I applaud Obama for carrying on the Bush views on foreign policy.  He understands that a troop surge in Afghanistan will be successful, just like the one Bush did in Iraq.  I am also so glad that he has realized pulling all the troops out of Iraq would be a bad idea.  He plans to leave 50,000 troops in Iraq.  Glad to see he is coming to his senses, and going against all that campaign rhetoric.  I just hope the left doesn't call him the same names they called Bush for his troop surge. <br>  <br>  I sure wish he didn't spend like Bush on steroids though.  In his campaign he ran against the Bush deficit, but now he is increasing it at record rates.  I was against Bush for his massive spending, so naturally I am against even more spending.|`|Uaoep16Qaa	totally! cuz i cant think of any policy bush made that was a good one, so everything should be overturned|`|821247dc614c8fbec4560efe894fb510aa	Very happy.|`|dfo8gSaraa	Yes.<br>  People seem to be more optimistic when it happens.|`|UzRijICuaa	In a way, yes.

AA11440601	Government money can not be used for embryonic stem cell research. Non-government money can be used for embryonic stem cell research. Embryonic stem cell research is happening with non-goverment money.<br>  <br>  President Obama may make government money available for embryonic stem cell research.<br>  <br>  Catholics believe that life is a sacred gift from God and needs to be treated with all human dignity from the moment of conception to the point of natural death.<br>  <br>  For this reason, the destruction of human embryos to harvest embryonic stem cells is immoral. <br>  ? The end never justifies the means<br>  ? A moral good can never come from a moral evil<br>  <br>  Here are just a few of the common myths about Stem Cell Research:<br>  <br>  Myth: Stem cells can only come from embryos. <br>  <br>  Truth: Stem cells can be taken from:<br>  ? Umbilical cords<br>  ? The placenta<br>  ? Amniotic fluid<br>  ? Adult tissues and organs including bone marrow, fat from liposuction, regions of the nose and even dead bodies up to 20 hours after death<br>  <br>  Myth: The Catholic Church is against stem cell research. <br>  <br>  Truth: The Catholic Church approves three of the four types of stem cell research:<br>  ? Against Embryonic stem cells<br>  ? For Embryonic germ cells (from miscarriages)<br>  ? For Umbilical cord stem cells<br>  ? For Adult stem cells <br>  <br>  Myth: Embryonic stem cell research has the greatest promise<br>  <br>  Fact: Up to now, no human being has ever been cured of a disease using embryonic stem cells. Adult stem cells, on the other hand, have already cured thousands. There is the example of the use of bone marrow cells from the hipbone to repair scar tissue on the heart after heart attacks. Research using adult cells is 20-30 years ahead of embryonic stem cells and holds greater promise. <br>  <br>  Based on the “The Ten Great Myths in the Debate Over Stem Cell Research” by Tadeusz Pacholczyk, Ph.D. <a href="http://www.ncbcenter.org/10Myths.pdf" rel="nofollow">http://www.ncbcenter.org/10Myths.pdf</a><br>  <br>  Adult stem cells are currently used for the medical treatment of:<br>  ?

Embryonic stem cell research is legal.  President Bush was unwilling to use federal funds to do embryonic research.  Private enterprise does not fund embryonic stem cell research because it has not shown any promise.<br>  <br>  People, like researchers, want the government to pay so they can get some income.|`|XNfjaPaSaa	As regerugged said, the issue w/ stem cell research is not its legality but whether the federal government, which funds a great deal of the scientific research in America, would fund it.

Problem is, the Republicans are the ones letting their guys get away with it.  So if my money must be used by the government (since neither party actually stops using it), I'd rather have the far more fiscally Conservative Democrats using it.  <br>  <br>  At least Democrats spend it here; rather than Republicans, who use it to destroy other countries, only to rebuild those very same countries for a second and a third and sometimes even a fourth demolition...

It was worsened by Truman, Johnson and Nixon, and then Carter opened the door for the culmination of their efforts, the securitized home mortgage.<br>  <br>  This tool of economic warfare allowed the housing market to rise, the flow of credit to increase and the stock market to be manipulated to reflect a false sense of prosperity while building up for a massive crash, dwarfing that of 1929.<br>  <br>  The end goal, global sovereignty for the U.N. and the implementation of Agenda 21.<br>  <br>  Naturally, the last 4 presidents have worked hand in hand with this effort, as they hope to secure themselves and their family to a position within the planned shadow government which will rule over the world's population once it is reduced to a "sustainable" 500 million people.<br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  ----------<br>  <br>  Limbo the Hut --<br>  <br>  You blatantly ignore the fact that the trends you cite had nothing whatsoever to do with the Iraq war and began long before it. <br>  <br>  You also ignore the fact that Bush had to do the same thing Reagan had to do -- Scramble to rebuild the defense infrastructure Clinton had destroyed, just like Carter.<br>   <br>  You ignore many other things about the war and the uderlying reasons for it, and you offer the prefab party line explanation of the oil crisis, and all for what purpose . . . . ?<br>  <br>  To do exactly what your part is being rightly lampooned for doing -- pointing a blind, broken, muddy (I hope it's mud) finger at the nearest republican you can find.<br>  <br>  So much demagoguery, so little time to post refutations.

Its effect on the banks prompted the first in the most irresponsible series of spending measures ever to cross a President's desk. Its effect upon the stock market (into which the Democrats -- that's right, YOU GUYS -- had woven it by securitizing the loans to make deceptive use of investors' capital instead of that of the banks and thus create a false image of economic growth) was similarly devastating. Carter started Securitization, Reagan killed it. Clinton revived and expanded it, Obama in his Senate auspices forwarded it and helped FORCE banks to participate whether or not they wanted to, and W was unable to peel back enough layers of the Democrat Onion to get any semblance of oversight. So what do you do? Blame W. Oh, of course. Otherwise you would have to actually THINK about the real reasons.<br>  You are so lame.<br>  <br>  The Oil barons of OPEC have been strategizing and planning, with your party's help in the form of drill bans and moratoriums on new refineries for 5 decades, on ways to force the US citizens to pay $5 or more for a gallon of gasoline, and they have one main use for that money -- to shoot at our soldiers. So when they succeed on the scale they did, you make up excuses for them and weave them all into your pseudo-intellectual  tirade about W! <br>  You are SO lame!!|`|6a29fa9432cd11f6628b8d1ef1265ca6aa	"Back in the 90's clinton implemented actions that forced lenders to approve loans to people with bad credit and low income. This is sometimes called the sub-prime market or B loans. These loans gave money to people to buy houses that they had no business owning. Because money was so cheap and available housing prices went up. People were then able to use home equity to get more credit. Little obama was a major fan of these lending practises. This is what he did as a community organizer, he even protested two banks that were going to merge and not offer sub-prime loans"<br>  <br>  And the Republicans did nothing about it when they controlled both houses and the administrative from 2000-2006. In fact I remember Bush bragging about the highest rate of home ownership in US history. The republicans were complicit.<br>  <br>  "Banks and insurers began to fail. Bush had only one part in all of this. He sent numerous requests to Barney Frank to have him fix the problem."<br>  <br>  Oh so Barney Frank could have fixed everything? I see. Why didn't the Republican controlled senate deal with this? How did a guy from the minority party have all that power? Something is missing from this story.<br>  <br>  "Also, keep in mind that the economy was doing well from 2001-2006 when Congress fell to the democrats control."<br>  <br>  The economy was actually quite choppy. Wage growth was stagnant.

It's like listening to Hannity, Rush and Savage who rant and rant about "liberals."|`|E9XL5x3Paa	This is Bush's doing.  He wanted to fight a war in Iraq, but not actually raise the funds to pay for that war.  So to pay for it, he had to borrow money from other countries, at rather high interest rates.<br>  <br>  What did that matter to Bush?  This war was going to be over in 6 mos. anyway, right?  He took the money.<br>  <br>  Problem is, the Iraq War has gone well past the 6 months envisioned by Bush; in fact, we are about to enter our 6th year.  But Bush still did not want to raise the funds, so he went and borrowed more.  And more, and more, and more.  It got to the point where the other countries began to question whether we could actually pay it back.  They were still willing to take the chance, but wanted to raise interest rates even higher to account for that risk.  What choice did Bush have?  He had committed himself to the war and to low taxes.  He took the money at the now incredibly high (and ever-growing) interest rates.<br>  <br>  Bush spent so much that he turned the $4 trillion National Debt he inherited from Clinton into a nearly $11 trillion National Debt.  That means that in 8 years, Bush managed to spend $3 trillion MORE THAN DOUBLE what it took all 42 of his predecessors 224 years to amass.  Bush also inherited a $400 billion surplus from Clinton in the federal budget, but left office with the federal budget in a $500 billion deficit.  In other words, Bush managed to lose nearly a trillion dollars in his last budget as compared to Clinton's last budget.<br>  <br>  Such a meteoric rise in the National Debt scared investors away from backing the dollar.  That sent the dollar to its 16 year low.  Do you happen to remember who was in charge 16 years before George W. Bush left office?  It turns out it was George H.W. Bush, in the middle of his own recession.  But I digress.<br>  <br>  Since a currency is the backbone of a Capitalist economy, when the dollar faltered so did the economy.<br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  When the dollar faltered, businesses had to use more of them to make the same products.  Oil is also measured in dollars, so with the failing dollar that meant that it took more of them to equal the same barrel of oil.  That rise in the cost of production as well as the cost of shipping required businesses to raise their prices for their products at the stores.<br>  <br>  They also had to cut expenses, and the biggest expense they cut was payroll.  In other words, they laid off employees.<br>  <br>  But employees are also consumers.  With some of their jobs disappearing and the price of everything going up, they had to cut spending.  There's your problem in Middle Class spending.<br>  <br>  But sales are how businesses make their profits.  With that loss in Middle Class spending came a loss in profits; which led businesses to cut even more expenses by laying off even more employees.  There's your problem in the job market.<br>  <br>  Lower profits also convinced investors to stop investing.  If you were an investor, would you invest in a company barely making a profit?  How about one making an out-and-out loss?  There's your problem in the Stock Market.<br>  <br>  Employees are also bank lendees.  When they lost their jobs and their savings (401k lost to stock market and savings dollars losing their value), they started defaulting on loans.  Home loans, car loans, mortgages, student loans; everyone started defaulting on all of them and all at the same time.  There's your problem in the financial sector, the real estate market, the subprime mortgage crisis, and the auto industry.  No credit being handed out because of those losses incurred from all the defaulted loans meant that no one could afford to buy any homes or cars.<br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  Every single economic problem we have can either be traced back to the Iraq War, or was exascerbated by how Bush chose to pay for the Iraq War.  EVERY SINGLE ECONOMIC PROBLEM.<br>  <br>  It is entirely Bush's fault, as he lied to get us into that war.<br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  Add-on:<br>  <br>  Don't have to like the truth, but you do have to accept it.<br>  <br>  Prove me wrong.  And watch how you do it, because remember that I only used Conservative principles in proving Bush was wrong for getting us into that war.<br>  <br>  Who says that we need to cut spending?  Who says we need strong National DEFENSE?  Isn't it Republicans?<br>  <br>  Well tell me, how does spending trillions of dollars getting soldiers killed while destroying and rebuilding another country lead to either cut spending or a strong national defense?<br>  <br>  Soldiers can't protect us if they are being killed in a country that had nothing to do with terrorism.  We can't cut spending by rebuilding countries we just leveled, just so we can level them again.<br>  <br>  So tell me, how am I wrong?  And again, watch yourself.  If you prove my ideas wrong, you prove Conservatism wrong.  If you can prove that what I said was wrong, you have to prove that cutting spending is a bad idea, and that killing off soldiers for no reason is a good idea.<br>  <br>  So have fun with that.|`|cIH0QbfMaa	Nobody forced any banks to make stupid decisions.

Hesse at Pierce Law School stated that states passing resolutions to secede or declare sovereignty is meaningless, because that would allow counties to disregard state laws, and cities to disregard county laws.   He does not understand that the states created the federal government, and the Constitution provides specific limitations on what that federal government can do.  When the federal government exceeds the limitations put on it by the Constitution, the states have the power to remove themselves from its control, or, if enough states get together, to dismantle the federal government.  Counties and cities do not have the same capability, because they were not set up the same way.<br>  <br>  So, the fact is that just because someone says something is illegal does not make it so, and just because someone makes a predicition does not make it true.<br>  <br>  I would suggest, though, that we each do all we can to stop the progress of this kind of thing.  How about a flood of letters calling for Obama to step down?  A legislator in one of the states that has a resolution of sovereignty moving through its legislature said that he has received over 250 emails supporting this resolution, where normally, he receives about 10 emails about any particular bill.  So, it doesn't necessarily take that many emails to wake someone up.

I do believe spending is needed to improve the economy, but the ear marks that he has in them are just terrible. He also said he would NOT have earmarks and then turned around and did it anyways. He is giving money to people that don't even pay taxes in the first place and this certainly will not help the economy.

A huge influx of people entered the workforce. There wasn't enough energy nor housing for them. There was enough services nor products. It was complete a supply and demand problem.<br>  The economy of the 1990s was a result of a new engine to drive the economy: the tech revolution.

cR7Sf4cjaa	Funny you should ask.<br>  <br>  From Todays Fairbanks News Paper:<br>  <br>  Russian scholar predicts U.S. collapse, Alaska return to Russian control<br>  Mike Eckel/The Associated Press<br>  <br>  Published Wednesday, March 4, 2009<br>   <br>   MOSCOW - If you're inclined to believe Igor Panarin, and the Kremlin wouldn't mind if you did, then President Barack Obama will order martial law this year, the U.S. will split into six rump-states before 2011, and Russia and China will become the backbones of a new world order.<br>  <br>  Panarin might be easy to ignore but for the fact that he is a dean at the Foreign Ministry's school for future diplomats and a regular on Russia's state-guided TV channels. And his predictions fit into the anti-American story line of the Kremlin leadership.<br>  <br>  "There is a high probability that the collapse of the United States will occur by 2010," Panarin told dozens of students, professors and diplomats Tuesday at the Diplomatic Academy - a lecture the ministry pointedly invited The Associated Press and other foreign media to attend.<br>  <br>  The prediction from Panarin, a former spokesman for Russia's Federal Space Agency and reportedly an ex-KGB analyst, meshes with the negative view of the U.S. that has been flowing from the Kremlin in recent years, in particular from Vladimir Putin.<br>  <br>  Putin, the former president who is now prime minister, has likened the United States to Nazi Germany's Third Reich and blames Washington for the global financial crisis that has pounded the Russian economy.<br>  <br>  Panarin didn't give many specifics on what underlies his analysis, mostly citing newspapers, magazines and other open sources.<br>  <br>  He also noted he had been predicting the demise of the world's wealthiest country for more than a decade now.<br>  <br>  But he said the recent economic turmoil in the U.S. and other "social and cultural phenomena" led him to nail down a specific timeframe for "The End" - when the United States will break up into six autonomous regions and Alaska will revert to Russian control.<br>  <br>  Panarin argued that Americans are in moral decline, saying their great psychological stress is evident from school shootings, the size of the prison population and the number of gay men.<br>  <br>  Turning to economic woes, he cited the slide in major stock indexes, the decline in U.S. gross domestic product and Washington's bailout of banking giant Citigroup as evidence that American dominance of global markets has collapsed.<br>  <br>  "I was there recently and things are far from good," he said. "What's happened is the collapse of the American dream."<br>  <br>  Panarin insisted he didn't wish for a U.S. collapse, but he predicted Russia and China would emerge from the economic turmoil stronger and said the two nations should work together, even to create a new currency to replace the U.S. dollar.<br>  <br>  Asked for comment on how the Foreign Ministry views Panarin's theories, a spokesman said all questions had to be submitted in writing and no answers were likely before Wednesday.<br>  <br>  It wasn't clear how persuasive the 20-minute lecture was. One instructor asked Panarin whether his predictions more accurately describe Russia, which is undergoing its worst economic crisis in a decade as well as a demographic collapse that has led some scholars to predict the country's demise.<br>  <br>  Panarin dismissed that idea: "The collapse of Russia will not occur."<br>  <br>  But Alexei Malashenko, a scholar-in-residence at the Carnegie Moscow Center who did not attend the lecture, sided with the skeptical instructor, saying Russia is the country that is on the verge of disintegration.<br>  <br>  "I can't imagine at all how the United States could ever fall apart," Malashenko told the AP.|`|Xv9AaAl2aa	When monkeys start to take flight out of my a**!|`|W0VL46gDaa	<a href="http://au.answers.yahoo.com/question/index;_ylt=Aix_7CaWWaP7QsIqdWd2H_Pg5gt.;_ylv=3?qid=20090304061204AATh6mT">http://au.answers.yahoo.com/question/ind...</a><br>  <br>  Yes, Alaska would be turned over to Russia.
SAgCy83Oaa	He was a primary architect of the so-called Red Scare.  He was a powerful senator and chaired a series of hearings aimed at rooting-out communists in various United States institutions.  He ruined many peoples' lives until a lawyer from the Army finally stood up to him and showed the world how evilly foolish the guy was. Google Army-McCarthy and see what you get.<br>  <br>  djinnsterr is right that McCarthy was a thoroughly awful man, but he was not "on the radio" and there definitely were no Stalinist-purge-like rounding up of people, let alone any "snub out" of enemies.  Where djinnsterr got those ignorant beliefs is beyond me.<br>  Here's a good summary:<br>  <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Army-McCarthy_Hearings" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Army-McCart...</a>|`|fT15YEkFaa	his communist witch hunts fed the fear of the uninformed|`|RDQittNDaa	He was on the radio everynight warning the American public about the evils of communism.  He also headed up the secret police who would round up suspected communists and jail them or simply "snub them out".  He was a major role-player in influencing the American public to hate communism using blatant scare tactics and intimidation.<br>  <br>  Wilder: I got my facts as a history major studying the 1950s.  Please don't call me ignorant, you're the one citing Wikipedia.|`|39KUKALFaa	Senator McCarthy used his position as the chairman of a powerful Senate Committee (Un-American Activities) to expose communists within the federal government and in the movies in Hollywood and in the longshoremen's unions, etc.<br>  <br>  He is hated by the communists and their sympathizers for doing that.  Why?  Because they wanted to take over the USA.  He was a central figure in the prosecution of Alger Hiss for perjury.  The records in Moscow show that Hiss was a Russian spy working in the US government.  Whittaker Chambers was right.<br>  <br>  But, even though his aims were noble.  If you doubt me, then realize that more than 100 million people died from persecution in communist countries in the 20th century.  His methods were somewhat similar to that of the communists in discrediting people without just cause in many cases, albeit the communists would have had a show trial and shot them.  The end does not justify the means.  Many of the people he attacked were wicked and evil through and through.<br>  <br>  Richard M. Nixon did a lot of this stuff in the House, but he did not go over the deep end, the way McCarthy did.<br>  <br>  After the US Supreme Court gutted the anti-communist legislation in the mid-1960s, people like Allard Lowenstein were able to construct bridges between quasi-communists and the left of the Democratic Party. This is how we got Senator Eugene McCarthy's candicacy in 1968 and Abbie Hoffman of the Chicago Seven in mainstream politics, even though he was taking funding from the North Vietnamese government.<br>  <br>  The "New Left" was largely a chimera created by the law persecuting the communists.  It was necessary to have an umbrella organization that was not obviously communist if one did not want to be subject to registration requirements, etc.<br>  <br>  Harry S. Truman, along with Jewish community, because he recognized Israel in 1948 fought Henry Wallace (a crypto-communist) for control of the Democratic Party and Truman's faction imposed the persecution of the communists and their sympathizers, which Joe McCarthy - a Republican - embraced and strengthened when the GOP won the Senate, not long thereafter.<br>  <br>  Obama comes from the Wallace wing of the Democratic Party.  He is their first president.

At the time a lot of smoke and mirrors were used to convince average Americans that these policies would help them as well. A similar set of lies has been used by those, like Steve Forbes, who promote a flat tax system.<br>  What the "Trickle-Down"/Supply Side policies of the Reagan administration were designed to do was to increase the amount of money available to wealthy Americans for investing and developing businesses. This was intended to create an increase in production of products and services and hence and increase in new jobs. The reason that the policy is called Supply Side, is because the supply of goods increases before there is a demand for goods. So, in that case, the supply of goods is intended to then spark demand, resulting in economic growth.<br>  This use of Supply Side policy led to a huge increase in consumerism and the use of credit. An environment of consumerism was created in American society through the media via advertisements, movies, and television shows, etc. that promoted consumerism. Consumers though, did not have the money to fulfill the desires created by society so debt was used to participate in the economy. Restrictions on credit were loosened under the Reagan administration making it easier for individuals to gain credit lines because the use of credit was essential to growing the economy because real wages were not going up for the average American, yet it was essential that the average American increase spending in order to fuel the economy. This situation fueled female entry into the workforce as more households require two workers to maintain their standard of living<br>  <a href="http://www.rationalrevolution.net/war/trickle_down.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.rationalrevolution.net/war/tr...</a><br>  Conservative policies failed America and it was deliberate and yes they still try to sell the same nonsense

4SLjJvcqaa	FOX NEWS NETWORK SUED FOR THE RIGHT TO LIE<br>  <br>  <br>  AND WON !!!!<br>  <br>  The Right to Lie in the "News"<br>  If ever we needed to know why the biggest media consumers in the world are so badly informed, this pretty well tells it all. The Media Can Legally Lie. <br>  According to Akre and Wilson, the station was initially very excited about the series. But within a week, Fox executives and their attorneys wanted the reporters to use statements from Monsanto representatives that the reporters knew were false and to make other revisions to the story that were in direct conflict with the facts. Fox editors then tried to force Akre and Wilson to continue to produce the distorted story. When they refused and threatened to report Fox's actions to the FCC, they were both fired.Akre and Wilson sued the Fox station and on August 18, 2000, a Florida jury unanimously decided that Akre was wrongfully fired by Fox Television when she refused to broadcast (in the jury's words) “a false, distorted or slanted story” about the widespread use of BGH in dairy cows. [...] FOX appealed the case, and on February 14, 2003 the Florida Second District Court of Appeals unanimously overturned the settlement awarded to Akre. The Court held that Akre’s threat to report the station’s actions to the FCC did not deserve protection under Florida’s whistle blower statute, because Florida’s whistle blower law states that an employer must violate an adopted “law, rule, or regulation." In a stunningly narrow interpretation of FCC rules, the Florida Appeals court claimed that the FCC policy against falsification of the news does not rise to the level of a "law, rule, or regulation," it was simply a "policy." Therefore, it is up to the station whether or not it wants to report honestly. During their appeal, FOX asserted that there are no written rules against distorting news in the media. They argued that, under the First Amendment, broadcasters have the right to lie or deliberately distort news reports on public airwaves.Fox attorneys did not dispute Akre’s claim that they pressured her to broadcast a false story, they simply maintained that it was their right to do so.<br>  OK, pick your jaw up off the floor. That some court thinks they CAN is bad enough, that these people assert their right to do so pretty well kicks it all down the hole.

The Bush administration totally failed to exercise oversight over the financial markets. They totally failed to reign in the obviously-inflating housing bubble. And, needless to say, they put everything on the credit card, even though doing so was completely unnecessary and criminally irresponsible.<br>  <br>  As for the laws broken:<br>  <br>  - FISA act and the Fourth Amendment to the Constitution of the United States vis-a-vis the illegal, warrantless wiretapping.<br>  - The Third Geneva Convention (binding international law).<br>  - The UN Convention Against Torture (also binding international law)<br>  - Intelligence Identities Protection Act.<br>  - Executive Order 12958.<br>  - The Espionage Act.<br>  - Various related laws and precedents, including conspiracy and obstruction of justice.<br>  <br>  I'm no lawyer, so that's by no means a complete list.

Well, the recession that we are in would negate the past 2 (at least) of those quarters - and then there is that recession that was in the beginning of the Bush admin that was the end of the tech bubble - so isn't that a false number???

He and his administration (and the GOP for that matter) advocated less and less regulation of the stock market and more specifically the banking industry.  That is why we are in this mess.  Failure to act can be just as bad or worse than actually acting.  To make it even more ironic he and his party initially helped bail out the financial industry that was in this mess because of their policy of non regulation.   <br>  <br>  3.  Bush did break laws.  Is he being prosecuted?  No.  Just because someone is not prosecuted does not mean they have not violated the law.  It is not so much domestic law that Bush violated as it is many international treaties that we are part of, most notably for the human rights violations that occurred in Cuba.  The whole point is if another country were taking American Nationals and placing them in prisons without  conviction or due process because they were allegedly terrorist our country would go crazy especially if the type of torture that has happened were performed on OUR citizens.  We would at the very least make sure that countries leader were brought before an international court and tried for human rights violations, if not invade them if GOP were in power.<br>  <br>  No we flip the tables and put other countries nationals in prison for extended periods of time, torture them, and give them no due process.  If we were not the power in the world that we are former President Bush would probably be on trial in a world court right now.<br>  <br>  Don't be so closed minded as to think that someone has not committed a crime because they have not been prosecuted for it;  many factors will go into who and who is not prosecuted.  Good example, Southern states not prosecuting whites for murdering black people, if we take your logic they have not committed a crime because they have not been prosecuted; I do not think this is a position anyone would want to take.

I believe it was somewhere around 46%. That is hardly obsolete. Democrats need to concern themselves with their own leaders at this point and not the Republicans. You have the power and you are running the show. In the next election the question will not be what did Republicans do. It will be what did Democrats do and what effect did their policy produce. <br>  <br>  As for Steele apologizing. Steele's job is to unite to party and attempt to draw new voters. It is not to alienate wings of the party he doesn't agree with. In short Steele's actions were ill advised at best. Not because Rush Limbaugh leads the party, which he doesn't, but rather because it comes off as Republican infighting which benefits no one in the party at this time.|`|ITF52tu9aa	The Republican Party is not obsolete but it is going through a major transition. There is a huge power void and uncertainty follows. <br>  <br>  Both Limbaugh and Steele are opportunists- looking for that magical volley of grapeshot. Ditto-heads will disagree, but Rush is doing much posturing to assert himself as THE Republican leader (his speech included). If Republicans want to reincarnate their party, this is the worst thing they could do at the moment.<br>  <br>  Limbaugh polarizes extremes in a way Obama hasn't (despite the Obama haters, this is a trickle compared to what Rush would generate) and has huge baggage. While the Right would try to dismiss this as media bias (as usual), his past would be too much to overcome. <br>  <br>  I also wonder about his financial ties. <br>  <br>  Yet do not dismiss the Elephants. They are hardy and have a strength far greater than their numbers. It would be foolish to take them for granted or to gloat. <br>  <br>  Remember- hubris is what brought the Republicans down the last two elections but also what caused the Republican majority in 1992.|`|wdBY1fWaaa	You liberals are just goofy. It's amazing how much attention you are giving Rush Limbaugh....and the Republican party mind you.<br>  <br>  You can't hide the fact that you are scared. It's right there in your question "is the repub. party obsolete"......why are you so concerned with that?<br>  <br>  Your party has control, they are in office right now. Shouldn't they be focused on the issues at hand. This includes the media as well. They put Republicans on the spot and say "Hey...uh...hey...what about Rush Limbaugh". Like that little air head Katie Couric.<br>  <br>  Seriously. You liberals stun me. You win the presidency, have control of the senate. YOU GOT IT......So why are you so damned concerned with what Republicans are doing? Why do you care?<br>  <br>  You are scared. That is a fact.|`|AA11598520	Yeah, we're all obsolete. Is that what you Democrat website is telling you? (Your user name isn't quite accurate, is it?)  In fact, with Obama in the White House, we need the Republican party more than ever. Somebody has to win in 2012. I agree, though, that party leaders need to stick to their convictions the way Rush does.<br>  <br>  Captain Falcon has an excellent point.|`|EPObVPzVaa	"All" of them?  Did John McCain apologize?  He called Limbaugh 'regrettable'.<br>  <br>  Did Limbaugh apologize to McCain for supporting Hillary?<br>  <br>  How about Thompson?  He said that Limbaugh was 'not helpful to the conservative cause'.  Did he apologize?<br>  <br>  How about Romney:  He said '...even among conservative luminaries like Limbaugh I'm being ignored because of my religion...'  Did he apologize?<br>  <br>  Try again.|`|LJwhaNIDaa	The Democrats purposely twisted Steele's words. <br>  <br>  Steele clarified his words.  <br>  <br>  The Democrats are seriously feeling threatened by Steele and Limbaugh and are trying to create conflict where non exists.  <br>  <br>  Alas, the democratic base is too high on Kool aid to realize how their leaders are manipulating them.|`|otYOxmnuaa	Someone should put Steele and the rest of the apologists in their place.

4a2b4c38598195f530e54c08fa3e232aaa	They can't afford it or their employers dont provide it or they have a preexisting condition for which insurance companies will not cover or they want to charge an outrageous premium to cover them.  I think it pretty much boils down to those  things.<br>  <br>  *edit*  I work as an office manager for a large company that provides two types of coverage.  I dont know of any that have never taken it.  Those that don't, it is because they are covered by a spouse.  I think the percentage is very low for those that do not choose the coverage.  There are also instances where the employer offers the coverage, but the deductible is so high, it is not worth the premium that they would have to pay for that coverage.  Alot of people dont have the $3000 deductible just laying around.  Especially if they are not making very much to begin with.<br>  <br>  And I got a thumbs down, why? Im sorry you dont like to hear the truth.

Is that where he gives billions to help the bottom and his friends at the top take their cut? We saw how well trickle up works with the first stimulus check, a bunch of broke idiots went and bought HD big screens and forgot to pay their mortgage. What will happen when he pays their mortgage? They will probably all go buy new cars they cant afford. Looks like a pattern!
t3QAaSN9aa	I think that Bush economic policies were a continuation of Reaganomics that had a very deleterious and continuing adverse effect on the economy.  Deregulation, lack of oversight, trickle down, ignoring the worsening economic condition of the middle class, removing consumer protections, fostering the "ownership society," ignoring the widening wealth gap, racking up record-breaking deficits, lowering taxes on the wealthy, starting an unnecessary and expensive war, etc., all contributed to our economic decline.  <br>  <br>  The analysis of this economic disaster is actually only beginning and the Bush administration will fare very badly in the final evaluation.|`|ipWRgKetaa	Nope. Frankly I can't think of a single thing that Bush did that got us into this mess. In fact, I can think of several things that Bush did with his tax policy that helped to keep it from getting worse. Policies that the left are now actively seeking to over turn. Oh yea.|`|IOZ0gH1Xaa	First off, economic recessions happen. They always have and the y always will happen. With or without a President of the United States.<br>  <br>  Second there is little the President of the United States on his own can do to affect a recession. There is, however, a tremendous amount of damage that can be done by governments to ease or worsen a recession.<br>  <br>  ALL laws in this nation a written and voted on by the House and Senate in this country. The President for the most part has to take the best with the worst and vote yes or no on the issue. A president cannot write law, just make recommendations to law makers.<br>  <br>  While there are many economic reasons for recessions, the two major contributors to this economic down turn can be directly contributed to two major factors. Energy policy for the last thirty to forty years. And the mortgage collapse in the banking industry.<br>  <br>  If you remember in 2006 and 2007 oil price world wide were hitting an all time record high. This was because oil usage world wide was hitting an all time record high.<br>  <br>  Our country good or bad revolves around energy consumption. We have in this country natural resources and technology that dwarfs the world when it comes to energy. However, our political process for the past four decades has done little to help the US in this area.<br>  <br>  We have more coal, more natural gas and more oil deposits in our shale deposits than can be imagined. Our shale oil deposits are greater than ever single Middle Eastern oil producing country has currently or has had in history.<br>  <br>  Yet, we have not been allowed to use our clean coal technology. We have not been able to build nuclear power plants. We have not been able to drill for our own oil. We have not been able to build new oil refineries. This last point makes our gasoline prices higher, because not only to we import more oil from other countries, but we also have to have them refine it to the finished product for us.<br>  <br>  Instead, we have been under the thumb of the so called Green Energy people dictating, what kind, when, where and whether or not a power plant can be built in this country for thirty years. They'll soon be argueing on where we will be allowed to build Wind Mill plants and Solar stations. <br>  <br>  The second major contributor to this economic disaster is the mortgage policy of this country for the past thirty years.<br>  <br>  Owning your own home has long been considered a peice of the "American dream." Yet there are people in this country (far too many of whom get elected to public office) that believe owning a home is a God given right under the Constitution. So for the last thirty years we have had lawmakers making it easier and easier for home buyers to receive a mortgage.<br>  <br>  We have laws that state mortgage lenders have to have a certain percentage of loans to minorities whether they are able to afford them or not. Our government has set up not one but two governmental backed mortgage entities (Fannie and Freddie) to guarantee loans to bank who HAVE to lend to people who can't really afford the loan.<br>  <br>  It has gotten so bad over the past thirty years that you could literally walk into a bank as an illegal alien citizen with no proof of citizenship, no proof of a job and no money down and buy a $350,000 house. All because the banks were affraid to get sued for no lending to a minority and because the Federal government was going to guarantee the loan anyway.<br>  <br>  So what happened? The housing market sky rocketed. Home prices soared due to artificially low home loan rates, and increased demand for homes. People were buying houses for $105,000 and turning around three years later and selling them for $180,000. Or buying $250,000 dollar home and selling them for $300,000 five years later. The market went nuts.<br>  <br>  Banks were being encouraged at the behest of Washington DC lawmakers to make risky loans to people that did not deserve loans. And the house of cards came tumbling down.<br>  <br>  The Bush administration on five occations tried to reform Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac. Democrats stood in the way and little could be done since a President is not a lawmaker.<br>  <br>  Know the house of cards has fallen. The banks are left holding bad loans because Fannie and Freddie can no longer buy the bad loans. Fannie and Freddie (aka the Federal government) are left holding some say upwards of $7 - $13 trillion dollars of bad loans.<br>  <br>  So what options does a President have in this situation. He can do one of two things. Push for more spending or push for more tax cuts.<br>  <br>  What has Obama advocated since being elected?<br>  <br>  Spending $780 billion on a faux stimulis package. Spending $16 billion on auto mfg. bailouts. Spending $400 billion for Omnibus spending. Voting for $700 billion in bank bailouts while still a senator. And floating another $700 billion dollars in bank bailout with Tim "I don't pay taxes" Taxman... On top of that his budget proposal for next year adds an addition $2 trillion dollard of debt on top of the already bloat|`|4SLjJvcqaa	Well in the middle of the housing bubble when houses were selling to QUALIFIED BUYERS<br>  Freddie Mac and Fannie Mae were BOTH STRAINED<br>  <br>  so what did Bush do to help them<br>  <br>  GAVE THEM MORE BAD MORTGAGES<br>  <br>  Wasn't Bush brilliant in creating government financing plans so people did not need downpayments on their home?<br>  in the middle of a housing bubble?<br>  <br>  More Americans than ever own their own homes, but we must continue to work hard so that every family has an opportunity to realize the American Dream. In 2002, I announced a goal to add 5.5 million new minority homeowners by the end of the decade. Since then, we have added 2.3 million new minority households. My Administration has also set a goal of adding 7 million new affordable homes to the market within the next 10 years. In my FY 2006 budget, I proposed a single family housing tax credit and two mortgage programs -- the Zero Downpayment mortgage and the Payment Incentives program -- to help more families achieve homeownership. In 2003, I signed the American Dream Downpayment Act, and I have proposed more than $200 million to continue the American Dream Downpayment Initiative to provide downpayment assistance to thousands of American families. By promoting initiatives such as financial literacy, tax incentives for building affordable homes, voucher programs, and Individual Development Accounts, we are strengthening our communities and improving citizens' lives. <br>  <br>  NOW, THEREFORE, I, GEORGE W. BUSH, President of the United States of America, by virtue of the authority vested in me by the Constitution and laws of the United States, do hereby proclaim June 2005 as National Homeownership Month. I call upon the people of the United States to observe this month with appropriate ceremonies and activities recognizing the importance of homeownership. <br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.whitehouse.gov/news/releases/..." rel="nofollow">http://www.whitehouse.gov/news/releases/...</a>|`|Yql4JTKPaa	No,<br>  <br>  When Bin Laden ordered to have those planes crash into the world trade center that was the start of it..<br>  Bin Laden quoted that he wanted to cripple the worlds economy..<br>  <br>  WTC wasn't just some office building like many think..it was the worlds financial trade.<br>  <br>  how quick America turns on each other to blame|`|2bf7b1928da0ba8574b96d3c8eb7ff68aa	yes. Remember, this recession started last winter, and Bush/bernake kept lowering interest rates to push it down the road. So he devalued the US dollar which shot up oil prices (which are traded in dollars) and in turn shot up the price of goods.<br>  <br>  the only thing that kept the Bush economy going was home prices- which we now know was a shell game|`|Ca8i226Xaa	No, he is not totally responsible. It was the collapse of the housing market bubble that started this recession, and that was caused by govt policy going back to FDR and by the creation of derivatives. Banks no longer cared about checking if people could really afford their mortgages, and so millions of people who really could not afford their mortgages got houses. When these people could no longer afford to make their mortgage payment, the bubble burst!<br>  <br>  However, Bush is responsible for creating most of the massive national debt,  and Obama seems to want to beat Bush's debt creation record! Sad.|`|Ar7swtCPaa	NOpe, Everyone made mistakes, people got ahead of themselves and their paychecks , people got careless and so did government, It was bound to happen, the problem is that in order for the Dems to make out like bandits , the media  and the politicians are fueling a large snowball and trying to make it much bigger with threats that it will  implode to get their way by coercion and  deceit.|`|6B1sxgtOaa	Don't know. I just know that a recession is a normal up and down of the economy.  It is usually self correcting if it is allow to correct itself.

TOO MUCH DEBT.|`|de5bda1b9dad2b1e94d22f6f86adf6beaa	No<br>  It was a combination of things.<br>  Like liberals pushing the idea we all have a right to a home they can't  afford.<br>  Those who bought and live off credit.<br>  Those who bought into ever get rich quick deal that came along.<br>  <br>  Those who leave beyond their means for too long.<br>  <br>  That wasn't Bush it was ourselves and others.|`|PaLJ4pU8aa	No, the financial panic caused the recession, and Bush had nothing to do with that.

THIS is an argument that my father never envisioned would take place in Washington, I'm sure.  When the economy is in the tank, and things have never been worse in living memory, we should be looking to cut every single dollar of wasteful spending that we can, not shoving a bill into law with literally billions in unnecessary projects included.<br>  <br>  To the people who say "Oh, the Republicans have pet projects in these bills, too," I say, "Didn't your mother teach you that two wrongs don't make a right?"<br>  <br>  "Their deal" is that they don't love these bills; they don't even like them.

bcc62a4f188c1522006cc8ba2c7b102aaa	Yes it is. Capitalism, the for profit system, brings out the worst in humanity and it's high time we move beyond this outdated system.<br>  <br>  The gigantic scale of the existing productive forces and the extraordinary advances in technology are more than sufficient not only to abolish poverty but also to guarantee every human being on the planet a high standard of living. Culture should be flowering amidst unprecedented material wealth. But, instead, conditions of life are deteriorating for the working class, and human culture, deprived of perspective and hope for the future, is in deep crisis. The source of the contradiction between what is and what should be is a global economic system based on private ownership of the means of production, and the irrational division of the world into rival nation-states.<br>  All efforts to raise the living standards of the working class and address serious social problems run up against the barrier of private ownership of the means of production, the anarchy of the capitalist market, the economic imperatives of the profit system, and, last but not least, the insatiable greed and money-madness of the ruling class itself. The claim that the capitalist market is the infallible allocator of resources and the supremely wise arbiter of social needs stands utterly discredited amidst the endless series of speculative scandals and multi-billion dollar bankruptcies that have rocked the world economic system during the past decade. The boundary lines between “legitimate” financial transactions and criminal fraud have narrowed to the point of being almost invisible. The separation of the process of personal wealth accumulation from the production and creation of real value is an expression of the general putrefaction of the capitalist system.|`|006931ab45dbadcbf10afb1e4dea8726aa	This brings up an issue that many seem to ignore.<br>  <br>  The early concepts of Capitalism developed when the world was in revolution and "free trade" was in it's infancy.  The idea that capitalism functions in a "Laissez faire" environment is a fallacy.  The development of multinational corporations and their dominance of so many markets makes "free trade" obsolete.<br>  <br>  These same people who insist that these abominations should be allowed to run roughshod over the planet and it's people are the ones who seem the most afraid of any social or economic restructuring, that is revolution, in these things.<br>  <br>  Funny how the revolution of yesterday (capitalism) is the reactionary of today.|`|1FkYHLXDaa	Any money invested into a capital investment usually flips over between 10 and 13 times. Example......An initial investment of $10,000 ends up bringing somewhere between $100,000 to $130,000 into a local economy.  <br>  <br>  How can you say "no one" is investing in small businesses today? That is ridiculous. Everywhere you look is a small business. They far outnumber big corporations.|`|D9mRZfRraa	No, It's not time to take a look at capitalism as it is practice in most parts of the world, What it's time to do, Is to realize that capitalism doesn't work when you attempt to run it on socialist principles like Democrats have been attempting to do for decades, It's equivalent to throwing sand in a car engine . Or lubricating the gears of something mechanical with dirt, All it does is slow down and hinder. God bless.|`|cMHxg372aa	Of course we need more regulation; after witnessing investment banks and insurance companies behaving like hedge funds, and at the same, hedge funds behaving like the mafia, that's a no-brainer.<br>  <br>  The capital markets are just that - the conduit through which capital is allocated to productive uses. They are not a casino, and if people don't realize that of their own accord, then it falls on the government to prevent gamblers and speculators from inflicting material harm on investors, workers, and consumers.|`|AA10152346	I think we have "laissez-faire" a little too much a little too long. yes I think capitalism will have to be revised around the world. As it is right now if one domino falls the rest will follow thus we will have a global crisis every time something happens anywhere. <br>  <br>  I think it would be a good idea to go back to more independence for systems in each country.
0cee90c25888a78a0b401efe2b753fd3aa	U.S. Supreme Court Justice Robert Jackson, who served as the chief prosecutor of the major Nazi war criminals, called starting a war without cause the "supreme war crime" because all other war crimes flow from it. Under the United Nations Charter, which is a binding international treaty ratified by the United States, it is illegal to attack another nation except: 1) when authorized by the Security Council; or 2) when necessary for self-defense and then only for as long as necessary to get the matter to the Security Council.<br>  The Security Council unanimously passed Resolution 1441 that found Iraq in material breach of prior resolutions and warned of "severe consequences" if Iraq didn't conform. But that resolution also explicitly stated that the Security Council remained seized of the issue and the United States assured the other members that Resolution 1441 did not authorize it to attack Iraq; the U.S. would have to return to the Security Council for another resolution before it could attack Iraq. In early 2003, the United States did return to the Security Council with a resolution authorizing an attack on Iraq. When it became clear that the proposed resolution could not muster a majority, the United States withdrew the resolution and attacked Iraq anyway. There is no crime more serious than illegally starting a war.|`|n2kBUWQOaa	If that is the case, then the Obama Administration should stand trial also.<br>  Obama has had nearly three months to get our troops out of Iraq and Afghanistan.

If you doubt this claim, I can point you to my web site as it was archived by a totally independent service back in the pre-election days of 2000. <br>  I can do the same for the period leading up to the war, when I showed that Bush was an immoral fool to force his dishonest war in America and Iraq. <br>  <br>  Now as for the FUTURE, the question isn't IF Bush will be tried, but only WHEN and BY WHOM.

khdFNlJ7aa	well, I agree with you, child molesters are sick people and deserve harsh treatment. The reason why we have a trial is to prove if somebody is actually guilty of a crime. Now would it be an injustice to send a person that is innocent to jail without giving them a trial , that may prove their innocence? That is up to you to deicide.

How can someone be "proven to be a child molester" until there has been a trial? That is the whole point OF a trial - to determine who is guilty and who is not. <br>  <br>  Or would you prefer a system where a cop can come to your house and say "You're a child molester, so we're throwing you in jail for the rest of your life. What, you say you're not guilty? You can prove that at trial? Sorry, scum like you don't deserve a trial."<br>  <br>  Richard|`|FXeuwkX0aa	Child molesters are among the worst predators.

Rush and his ilk (Hannity, Maddow, O'Reilly, et al.) completely skip logic when they present their arguments.<br>  <br>  I suggest you read "Logic and Mr. Limbaugh" and "Crimes against Logic".

It was Bush who started bailing out the banks and AIG. Obama is making big business accountable for the money they are being given. Putting reasonable restraints on business is saving capitalism not destroying it. Even Adam Smith agreed that capitalists must pay taxes in order to receive the benefits and protections government affords it. Whenever conservatives be it Rove, Limbaugh, or Hannity try to define liberals, they are not talking from a basis of fact . Ad Homonym attacks are basically name calling.|`|3c91df9cab412a7ca4201cdaf64121e3aa	Read the book "Rush Limbaugh is a big fat idiot. . ." - quite a few of them are stated in there.

I actually heard him make that statement, and the book will cite the shows original date of airing for each falsehood.<br>  <br>  But I do find humor in an ENTERTAINER stirring up so much dust.  The man is paid to state his opinion, and his ratings go up when he pisses people off.  Of course he is going to be "confrontational".

If the disabled person has the mind of an 8 year old, this would obviously be an unethical act that someone might take them to court over. <br>  <br>  Most disabled people, whether physically or mentally disabled, do receive some kind of welfare assistance in addition to programs to help them with their handicaps.

Did you read the article on the Yahoo home page about the White House foolishly taking on a talk show host.  I really liked the quote at the end; it's something that all Obama supporters, particularly those who jump to his defense like he was their kid, should think about long and hard.<br>  The quote, for those who did not read it, from the mind and mouth of Theodore Roosevelt: "To announce that there must be no criticism of the President, or that we are to stand by the President, right or wrong, is not only unpatriotic and servile, but is morally treasonable to the American public."<br>  Rush Limbaugh has every right to say what he says.|`|KF48OjyDaa	I could care less about his ratings...the more he is tied to the Republican party, the more their ratings go down...I could care less about how high his ratings go as long as he is hurting Republicans chances of regaining power|`|gP6eiioiaa	good  keep  talking  maybe  he  will get  some  to open  their  minds up  to  the  destruction  this  one  person  is  going  to cause|`|pgdTmT6caa	Liberals love Rush and Hannity.

First, the relationship if obviously false, second even if true for the last month no would take seriously that it was significant, third, no proof was provided.

How Clinton got away with refusing to turn over contribution statements required by federal law before the 1996 elections, which legally voided the win's by all democrats involved? But that was never done? You should really look into Clinton's crimes that were just glossed over, before you start worrying about BS and hype about the Bush administration, because Clinton Committed crimes we know about and the information was totally in public (like tapes of Gore collecting illegal Chinese contributions from a Chinese monastery in bags showed on TV for one), Bush's administration, didn't.|`|u1bFsnCPaa	It is not common knowledge, it is the rant of far left wing morons that refuse to face the fact that they managed to elect someone that is even more asinine the leaders of congress.

Have you heard about Bush papers written by his then attorney general giving him authorization to pick up and put citizens in jail without charges or a trial only on his word if HE thought they were terrorists. On his word only!! The papers also gave him the authority to invade our homes on his say so. He was willingly to do this to American citizens. He also wanted to shut up the press and anything printed only on his authorization. <br>  <br>  I have been listening to this on MSNBC and Rachel Maddow show for the last several nights. President Obama had authorized the release of Bush papers.

But the Bush administration destroyed millions of emails which they were supposed to keep and ignored the constitution over and over again and got away with it.  Bush and Cheney thought that the POTUS should be an emperor without any rules to follow, just doing whatever the he!! they felt like doing.  Why aren't they being prosecuted for crimes against the constitution?  When do those trials start?<br>  <br>  The trials should be open and shut since both Bush and Cheney admitted publicly that they had authorized illegal wiretapping, torture, rendition and several of their aides admitted they fixed the facts around going to war in Iraq.  They are traitors and should be in jail at the very least.
TItRpckpaa	Ive been thinking about this myself lately. One good that has come of the political nonsense this decade is that more people are paying closer attention to who they vote for, what they are doing etc. This is good because Bush made the republicans look bad, Obama is really making the democracts and socialism seem like the wrong answer RIGHT OFF THE BAT, so in the next election 2012 I think we will see a change. <br>  <br>  Already in this last election voters were crossing their traditional lines, voting for people they normally wouldn't have etc because tehy are fed up. In 2012 when people are fed up with both, perhaps if we get enough money up for the capaign the LP can finnaly rise to power and bring America back.    <br>  <br>  Because you are right, libertarians did have it right if you look back on it, hindsight being 20/20|`|8eeee84248737295c60d88565ceb0559aa	wonder aloud why two parties that have more in common than they do in contrast argue like school girls.|`|zI3YXvGLaa	grow bigger overthrow the government and start fresh.|`|qQEl7Fukaa	I'm listening.

bda08b314a4966c36d4acd161c9ec0f6aa	The President would win because Rush is not known for telling the truth  He is not known for wanting to deal with people who disagree with him. He has never debated anyone in his life. Rush couldn't keep his composure long enough. He is use to being in charge and controlling everything to his liking even to cutting off anyone who has the nerve to disagree with him.|`|cq0f8LtDaa	Rush would make Comrade Obama his b*tch.|`|8eeee84248737295c60d88565ceb0559aa	Limbaugh doesn't do well when he isn't in complete control of the argument and rebuttal.<br>  <br>  Otherwise he would take his "wisdom" and become a politician to "fix the problems" himself.<br>  <br>  I would put one down for Obama.  Palin would run circles around Limbaugh too, so would most any politician.<br>  <br>  John Terry, this goes for any broadcaster/talking head.  Chris Matthews?  Same thing.  Maddow?  Same thing.|`|1oxBCtmZaa	Depends on the issues and the rules of the debate.     The more open the discussion, the longer each speaker got to speak, the more rebuttals and rebuttal time, and the more each debater got to cross-examine the other, the more likely that Limbaugh would win - - - because "Hope, Change and Keynes" wouldn't stand up under scrutiny.<br>  <br>  If it were a watered-down, heavily moderated, short-answer speech contest, then Obama could simply resort to the campaign strategy of repeating truisms, and some audiences would buy it.<br>  <br>  EDIT - I think people who have never listened to Limbaugh make some assumptions about him that they wouldn't if they listened to his show for a week.    Agree or disagree with his conclusions or his logic (sometimes I agree, sometimes I vehemently disagree), but he's pretty good at what he does.   And Obama's pretty good at what he does.    So, the likely winner would depend on whether the "debate" was structured to allow Limbaugh to do what he does or to allow Obama to do what he does.    So, to recap - if it were a true debate, Limbaugh would probably win, while if it were a speech competition, Obama would probably win.|`|HcFHLGIaaa	In a fair debate with facts and figures,<br>  no telepromters and no calling friends for help....<br>  <br>  Rush would eat BO's lunch.|`|BRyRtQSvaa	Rush, hands down!|`|99a6c52cfb9842cdf983abb381e0fbf8aa	That would be style vs. substance.  If you had an intelligent audience it would be Rush.  Considering the last election that was won by Obama spending 2 years campaigning and saying nothing for the entire time it might be a toss up.  In a debate people who can think on their feet are usually the winner.  Obama can't speak with out a teleprompter so he would be helpless.  In reality the only way a debate would happen is if Obama had total control over format, topics, and questions. That would make it hard for any one to beat him.  You also have to consider that he probably would not do it live on TV.  This would allow any published version to be edited to make Obama look good.|`|wZ8sTBxnaa	Limbaugh has never been in a debate? Never expressed his opinion with anyone who opposes him? Obviously those of you who say this have never listened to his show. He is extremely articulate, extremely knowledgeable, and know exactly how to get his sparring partner to say and admit to things that show that Rush is Right. Not to mention the fact that Obama's views are indefensible. If each debater were able to ask questions of the other, and had to answer the questions, even I could beat Obama.|`|93HyAM60aa	Rush would take Obama to school. He wouldn't dare have an open debate with Rush - without some 'in the tank' mediator to fend for him and control the topics (and the format). The media would still be in for the save after the fact, but Rush would so destroy him that more American people than ever would see through their analysis, so it would be a double if it happened.|`|yB0fWb1Uaa	Rush because the debate would be Freedom vs Socialism for the direction of this Country!<br>  <br>  Hell it wouldnt take much to debate the Obama Policies just look at the Stock Market!|`|ErTVzpUUaa	Limbaugh would, because Barry wouldn't have teleprompters, or approved questions!|`|P8aBAmHKaa	Obama

bb5a54df57374dc4de372500ff862a7daa	Politically speaking, when it does happen, it only means that it bounces back to what is truth, that prophecy is coming to pass.  I can only see it in a biblical perspective.<br>  <br>  If I try to see it from a non biblical view, I can only guess that politically, the world leaders believe that this will solve their problems and bring peace to the world, as all countries will be treated the same, with the same measure and by one law.  Consider that one thing that will bring this peace to end will be that it won't work due to all the different beliefs and loyalties, and once again, chaos will come, then the leader (anti-christ) will need to take a harder stance - thus proclaiming himself to be God.<br>  <br>  The illusion will work for a time, we are told this in scripture, there will be peace under this ruler for 3 1/2 years, then prophecy will continue to come to pass and things will change to horror. Still, many will not believe and support this One World Government and leader and reject the Lord Jesus, even as he appears to them.<br>  <br>  <br>  EDIT - Do you see how easy it has been to the idea being accepted?

Well, you people (including your media) love to play sex-scandal-game with the candidates before any election. I can accept that much, as part of your political convention though we laugh seeing your decaying social values(!).<br>  p.s. I wish I could report against your question. But I'm over-mad.

JhC6BvPpaa	Anyone that tells me that I did well under Maggie gets a panning as far as I'm concerned. Yes, I did well - sort of, but it wasn't due to her running the UK, I did quite well because I worked hard. And when interest rates were at 18% during her watch, my mortgage was so big, I had to find a job abroad that paid me enough money to keep my home and family together. Factories were closing all over the UK and things were bad.<br>  <br>  She had 'some' good ideas, they all have, but she ruthlessly killed off all the mining industry, ship building and steel industries. If you look at those areas now, they are still deprived and still have high unemployment even now, those towns and cities never really recovered. <br>  <br>  The fact that we are still great users of coal, ships and steel means that we are now at the mercy of foreign companies and have to import nearly everything in. This is not helping the UK to balance the books during the current recession. If we had a greater manufacturing base, it might help to counter the credit crunch. Blair and Brown haven't helped of course either, and it's not all Maggies fault.|`|LIpCGz4oaa	looking after the business man and  the factory owners meant jobs for the workers. bringing business's down means lost jobs. ask gordon clown. free enterprise  is good for everyone. it gives people a chance to earn a living and gives work to the people. socialism achieves one thing. it puts everyone on the bottom and keeps them down without hope.|`|rsK5R2giaa	Yes i agree.

It's not a palace - only a semi, but it's mine and I'm proud of it. I'm proud of myself for that matter as I'm a single parent too and have done this all by myself.|`|90ba64c03d7d00439e287a17ba561a39aa	If her years were of unemployment etc, all under a conservative government. What is the difference now under a labour government with Brown in charge bringing the country to its knees. I think Blair saw it coming and jumped ship.<br>  Also Thatcher came to power after a labour government had the country on its knees, hmmm is that a coincedence or just me?|`|5axNEp8jaa	I have changed my opinion of Mrs Thatcher somewhat over the years. arguably it was easy to know what she was against opposed to what she was for.<br>  Certainly she was for Free enterprise and Entrepreneurial endeavour  and the extent that she allowed this lassie fare economics led to Black friday and the following financial collapse.This hardly helped the rich especially the small Business man.<br>  Strangely she tied us into Europe with the Mastrict treaty endorsing big government and the surrender of more power, From an English Nationalist?<br>  She destroyed the Unions in Britain which I believe was a good thing,the Union members were genuine but the leadership was corrupt and heavily infiltrated by Communists, on the other hand she supported Solidarity, the Polish Unions against the communist dictatorship. in much respects she was a political enigma.<br>  She didn't care any different for the poor than the rich she just thought that the rich could provide the best opportunity for providing wealth coupled with free market capitalism, She sold off the North Sea gas and oil supplies to pay for Unemployment benefit for the 3 million unemployed. She allowed Tenants to buy their council homes,many councils were socialist run and they were hovels she wanted people to help themselves in this respect.<br>   But her Ideology was Thatcherism not Conservatism. Many off her ideas have been re branded by New Labour. It has too be asked if the gross gain of Thatherism was better than the gross loss to society, I think society has been better because of her.|`|twdXT5wOaa	A wee correction.

He'll keep the money he has.  Ruin your credit or get a judgement against you if he wants to go so far as to take you to court for the money.|`|k8ivyYfaaa	I hate to be the one to say this, but the person(s) that post bond for someone are responsible for that person at all times until the court appearance.  If the person skips, then you're liable for the bond.<br>  <br>  Now, I don't believe you can be criminally charged for his skipping bail, but you should check with an attorney or local police.  The comment to your aunt was most likely a scare tactic, because he's out several thousand dollars and wants someone to pay it.|`|tPvjd8qqaa	A bondsman doesn't have the ability to take you to jail unless there is a warrant for your arrest.  In order for there to be a warrant a judge would have had to have found you guilty of a crime or that you didn't appear in court for a court date.  You didn't commit any crime so you most likely won't be facing any jail time and it appears you didn't need to go to court.  <br>  What you did do, however, is that you entered into a civil agreement with another person/company...the bonding agent.  When your ex got arrested, he left you holding the bag because any bond that was put up was probably forfeited, maybe.<br>  Usually a bond is just money put up to guarantee that a person comes back to court.  Sometimes it is used to pay part or all of a fine if the person is found guilty.  I would have thought the bond agent could have gotten his money back when your ex was put in jail.  So I'm wondering why you would still owe money.  Was the bond used for a fine, if so, you or you're ex are going to have to pay.  <br>  The bonding agent is trying to intimidate you to get you to pay so he doesn't have to go through a court proceeding.  Make him.  The judge may see that you did a stupid thing and only hold you responsible for part of the money owed.  If you lose, then you take your ex to small claims court to have a hook on him to pay you back.  <br>  Also, the bonding agent can't harass you.  If he does, call the police and make a report.

tuULGJS6aa	The Democrats don't want to allow freedom of speech in such matters. I'm a Republican lady and I'm beautiful, smart and blond. I have the right to say so.|`|dBbr51Spaa	Because sex sells.  There is an even percentage of blondes to brunettes to redheads in each party.  Caucasian men (who republicans traditionally target) have shown in polls to be more attracted to taller blondes.  This means that this image will be shown more than any other in order to attract the target audience.  It's no different than the store at the mall that seems to hire pretty young girls as sales associates, while the manager is usually an average or below average guy.  Guys will always chase after the women.  Women will rarely chase after the men.  Look at Fox News.  With exception to Michelle Malkin, I can't name a female commentator who isn't blonde.|`|HIY7oeWBaa	Because it is a painful reminder what they got!.....<br>  Although there are some very beautiful dark haired Republican ladies also!..|`|AA11530144	More American Intellectual insight?|`|MVLnWyTraa	They are getting wiped out by the Obama supporters because they hate being stuck with Michelle Hillary and Pelosi........<br>  So in their minds they wipe out the Question because they don't want to be reminded of it!<br>  And also it is very embarrassing!

I lived in CA most of my life so I never believed it but after joining the army and traveling through most of the rest of the country I can attest to the fact that it is absolutely true country is more popular than rap on a nationwide basis. <br>  <br>  The IQ thing is because ghettos have low test scores and most people in the ghetto are black, like it or not. Trust me I used to live in a bad part of long beach. <br>  Graduation same thing, most blacks dont get educated early so they lose intirest and drop out to smoke weed and sell drugs by the corner store.|`|bVJSlo3Raa	No of course you cannot trust half the information out there from just a bit of statistics knowledge I know everything can be scewed to prove anything.|`|W1xs3vYBaa	It's because you are looking at faulty sources.

Why are african americans last on everything? Why are there ghettos in a first world country that claims to be the richest? <br>  <br>  The truth is you should always question statistics.

He tells it all right there in his book, check it out. Obama talks about sitting around having coffee with these people and discussing Marx, Lenin and Che Gueverra.<br>  <br>  Obama wants to "get back" at these people that are seen as the enemy by the groups he has always been associated with and that have supported him over the years (ie. ACORN). The enemy is the "evil rich" and the system of capitalism.<br>  <br>  Obama will not succeed in destroying this country. No way.<br>  <br>  Added: Hey "Europe1".

Any real Economic historian will tell you that FDR's economic works he used in the 1930's only prolonged the Reccession. Its a proven fact that America moved right out of the Reccession due to WWII. The US supplied its allies with weapons, machines, natrual resources to fight both Japan, Germany, and Italy. <br>  <br>  Our Allies helped us come out of the War stronger financially than under the Public Works Programs during the Great Depression.<br>  <br>  During Korea we were able to profit from saving South Korea, that's why the 50's were called the Golden Years of American Economic progress. during the 1960's Vietnam and the Cold War put us into a reccesion that had no profit for our industires. This ultimatly effected the 1970's economic crisis under Carters Administration. <br>  <br>  During the Clinton years our economic reccession was a global recession based on larger needs of SUPPLY and Demand. This current economic whirlwind equals the 1999 Reccesion that came under Clinton. The only differnce is this reccesion also equals the Auto Industry failures and Bank problems of the late 1970's under President Carters administration. OH did I also mention that OPEC became a major player  during this time. Which still leaves them as a major source of Cude Oil. <br>  <br>  What Obama is trying to regulate and create is new industry development to change our dependcy on crude oil. This is 10 years away from developing. eventually this is the one program I really agree with the Democrats. New alternative energy sources and new industries must replace the 20th Century Fossil Fuels industry. <br>  <br>  Unless Auto makers are ready to change new auto makers will spring up in the next few years creating new demands and revolutionize our industries. As the modern world comes to an end. The information age takes the stage. <br>  <br>  New Engineering feets will change our industries, but people must understand this takes time. Infastructure, R&D, Streamlining new industires require time for the old corporations to disapate and new companies to spring up. <br>  <br>  This is the one plan I agree with for President Obama to help ignite. Our intrest in the Middle East will Disapate and our needs for new alternative fuels and energy sources will become so much cleaner and better for the Enviroment. Unfortuantly, President OBAMA may not get the credit to start this plan when it succeeds. We have to or will be at war over fuel for the rest of the existance in humanity.<br>  <br>  Big  govement is not needed for this. Just Regulation our energy source needs. he can adminstrate the direction, but the Congress Power and Industry  commetiee is responcible for this.

However, assuming the meeting cannot be re-scheduled, it will go ahead in her absence and she will be notified in writing of its outcome.

I know Indiana Has a program for Middle and Low income students that can pay for most or in some cases all of a basic Associate or Bachelors program based upon the Family income and some regional aspects. I think the main reason that programs like this, with potential high value returns for the states, are not more prevalent is because it is a long term program with the returns a long way off in the future.

If President Obama had been white, the world would have never heard of him. But because he is black, he's seen as special and deserving of a little extra 'latitude'. And, as the nation is finding out, this is really sort of a bad thing. <br>  <br>  Now me, I believe that people should get the job based on their qualifications, not their skin color. The color of their skin should have no bearing. And, as long as I have been in business it never has. Affirmative action doesn't do the business or the individual any favors. The business suffers from their inexperience and it puts the person who was selected beyond their experience and qualifications into a position for which they are not yet ready.

From my Independent perspective... If Steele agrees with Rush on that, he's going to lose the moderates and Independents because I for one am tired of the partisan bickering!  Our country has big problems and I want to see Congress working together to solve the problems, not butt heads with each other and play partisan games.

No one knows much about Steele or his views, then the first thing he is quoted saying attacks Rush.  So, whatever attacks he gets he deserves at this point.  Conservatives do not look at skin color, we look at views.  Steele has to prove himself to us that he will represent what we want.  If he doesn't then he will not be supported, if he does, then he will be supported.  As for blacks, the majority of them will not vote for republicans no matter what the republicans do.  So, pandering to them is worthless from my point of view.|`|410cd3e1b1738d398d8b2183db222dc2aa	I agree.

A DA usually will not take this to court unless they have more than a single witness' testimony. They'd want other evidence, such as phone records, other witnesses, etc. Do they have that? In order for him to be charged with aggravated stalking (as opposed to stalking) he would have to had confined or restrained her somehow OR caused bodily harm OR violated a restraining order. Which is it he's being accused of? What does his attorney say? What evidence has his attorney seen through discovery? <br>  <br>  Without more details, your question is impossible to answer accurately. Aggravated stalking can be a class 2 or 3 felony, depending on the jurisdiction, and sentences vary widely from one jurisdiction to the next, so what kind of time he is looking at would depend on where he's being tried, what kind of evidence there is against him, what kind of record he has, etc.|`|HZvdr8VLaa	your boyfriend is a baby's mother??  he should be rich.  wow.

Because a very small number of very rich people run the country and benefit at the expense of the majority.<br>  <br>  Look at the wages of executives running duds and criminally crooked corprorations like Enron and the big 3 auto group, banks, etc. These people run the country and live as kings with no morals and ethics.<br>  <br>  Here is my rant....<br>  <br>  The current economic chaos is clear proof that our financial state is nothing more than the result of a successful corporate propaganda campaign. The U.S., and most western economies, are hooped. We the "people" lived well beyond our means for far too long. The myth that everyone can be rich if they just work hard enough is a lie. Tell that to the millions who have no jobs and no prospects nand to those whose investments have vanished.  Are they all just a bunch of whining losers? No,  they are victims of medieval social mores, but some are just lazy.<br>  <br>  Instead of rejecting corporate dogma that stated it's all good, keep being irresponsible, spend away,we blindly accepted corprorate dogma.  To keep the joy ride going western economies, the U.S. in particular, indebted present and future generations morally, financially and exported much of the economy's jobs, all well beyond comprehension.  <br>  <br>  What loan shark did the U.S. go to extend the casino economy joy ride?  They went to communism of course.  Yes the world's bastion of capitalism, righteousness, democracy, freedom and sworn enemy of the oppressive evil communist doctrines went begging to China. America's blatant pompasity is only exceed by it's complete absence of morality which is readily tossed in exchange for debt to buy more trinkets cheaply from China. <br>  <br>  China complied in a brilliant fashion that now places them at the top of the world's financial institutions. Yes, they filled the beggar's cup with spending money.  But  at such an exorbitant cost that future generations will look back and see us like the Byzantine losers that incompetently sank their empire.  China now  has the 2 largest banks in the world. That means it will increasingly call the U.S. tune from now on world affairs and finances. Obama seems nice enough, but he has made it much worse by borrowing even more money.<br>  <br>  Millions of jobs were ambivalently exported. Darwinian economics are great if you are the top of the pyramid like the executives, but is awful for those people suffering else where in society. All rich societies become stupid and disappear. The U.S. is no different.  WE are in the very stupid phase.  Our government is an absentee government that believes corporations, through the laws of Darwinian economics, automatically do  whats best for all. The opposite of China's appraoch. I think the answer lies in the middle between how China runs their economy and how we do it. Intelligence, compassion, and common sense need to be injected.   <br>  <br>  I would say that we are neither and America desperately needs to reinvent itself to avoid catastrophe or the whole world will suffer severely for its insolensce. The label is irrevelant, what matters is that the greatest country on earth is sputtering into abject failure and paralysis. Its badly broken and we need to fix it.

6OLiuM9Gaa	The military is, or was in my experience, what you make of it.<br>  <br>  There are always things to complain about. You don't have to look too hard. There are the hours, the food, the living conditions, the deployments, the lousy leadership, the weather, the people for whom you work, the people with whom you work, and the people who work for you.  It's the same as with any job.<br>  <br>  The ASVAB was designed to determine for which jobs a person is a "best fit" based upon interests, education, and aptitude. Let it do its job. Don't prepare for it. Don't go in with preconceived ideas about the job you want. Just go in with the idea that you're going to do your best. Yeah, you may not get that "dream job" you "always wanted." The Navy Reserves don't have much call for "James Bonds" or Astronauts or whatever the "in thing" is today. When you get your test results you'll have a laundry list of jobs from which to choose. Your recruiter will try to steer you towards those for which the Navy currently has the greatest need.. Discuss the options with him, maybe do a little more research, and then make your decision. Now it's YOUR decision and your life. You live with it.<br>  <br>  I enlisted in the Navy in 1960 at age 20 with a degree in math. I had no idea what I wanted to do. I had thoughts of something in computers. I didn't go for an officer program because I didn't know if I really wanted to make the commitment. In Boot Camp my specialty found me (based on the ASVAB). About four years later, when it was time for me to reenlist or extend for my E-6, somebody dusted off my degree and recommended me for OCS (Officer Candidate School). I took the opportunity and was in the Navy a quarter of a century. Was it all "peaches and cream"? Nope. But nothing in life is. And I wouldn't have stayed in had I not found more good than bad in the experience. <br>  <br>  I said it was attitude. I think much of it is. I remember even the first few days in Boot Camp, getting up at 5:00 AM (it wasn't 0500 to me yet) and marching (or trying to march and stay in step) to breakfast. I heard grumbles about the hour. I heard grumbles about the cold. I was thinking how beautiful the sunrises were in San Diego, and how the poor saps who were still sleeping were missing it. I also preferred marching in the cool of the day rather than in the heat of the day... they complained about the heat too. <br>  <br>  I said let the ASVAB do its job. My cousin enlisted in the Navy out of high school. He was a pretty good musician and had dreams of the Navy Band. The Navy, based on his ASVAB results, thought he'd make a good BT. So he did that for 18 years. They sent him to a ton of schools. When he got out, he landed a job as Building Inspector for a city in Washington state -- based on his Navy schooling and his natural abilities. He's retiring this year and going to travel. When he's done traveling, the city has offered him a job as "consultant." It'll be essentially the same job he was doing before he retired, but he'll be able to pick his projects and name his own work hours. And for that, he gets paid about twice what he was making before he retired.<br>  <br>  I don't know about you. I don't know if you'd make a good MA. But a high school counselor once told me (probably the only sage advice I ever got from a high school counselor) that there's nothing in the world like doing what you love and are good at, and that getting paid for it was just icing on the cake. I'll tell you, if you're not good at something, you're not going to enjoy it. And if you don't like something, it's going to be a tough job to be good at.

Cap and trade will kill the economy.  Cap and trade is designed to ration energy.  It will also give politicians control over what industries they favor.  There will be unintended consequences that are disastrous to free trade.  <br>  <br>  Cap and trade is also a new way to tax people.  Raising taxes discourages what's being taxed.  So raising taxes on energy will discourage energy which is the backbone of modern living.  <br>  <br>  Global warming is a political tool to gain power and control.  The earth has been hotter and colder in the past.  The dire predictions of mayhem and destruction from warming up are totally unfounded.  <br>  Actually, hurricanes get more frequent when the temperature cools, not when it gets warm.  <br>  <br>  If the earth gets warmer, the seas are not going to rise more than a couple inches.  There will not be global catastrophes from global warming.  Actually, with more CO2, the earth will be greener.  But CO2 is only a very minor greenhouse gas.

Overly aggressive cap and trade policies mean higher energy costs and job losses, acting as a regressive tax on the working class.  It would increase outsourcing by increasing the cost of domestic manufacturing.  And compliance to cap and trade would make a .07 degrees Celsius difference by 2050.  <br>  <br>  Risks outweigh benefits.|`|Uk4OwRtMaa	No. Hell no.<br>  The whole global warming scam has been built up to hysterical proportions for the express purpose of making money for those invested in the business of carbon credits and "green" energy. The politicians didn't take long to realize that they could use the environmental movement and it's single minded supporters to push for massive taxes and gain governmental control over "everything".<br>  It's pure madness. But we shouldn't be surprised by it's popularity. It's being pushed by those in control of government, by the mass media, and by the educational institutions.

ZzXxRLWcaa	There is no such thing.. your getting bad information.<br>  <br>  Obama is AGAINST the fairness doctrine. I dont know how many times I have to say it on these boards.<br>  <br>  However for your info...<br>  <br>  The fairness doctrine is the belief that in all political discourse on print, radio and TV there has to be a provable nexus of balanced opinion. In other words... if you give ten minutes to a democrat, then you have to give ten minutes to a republican. (applicable during a political season or on a voting issue).<br>  <br>  Most feel though its not necessary nowadays and such "forced" opinion is a violation of the first amendment and freedom of the press. Obama feels this way too.|`|f702cfc86c32f9c4c16e495b7e47297aaa	The FAIRNESS DOCTRINE used to be in existence.<br>  <br>  The Reagan era (A commission during those de-rugulation years) took it away.  <br>  <br>  Obama wants it back.  There must be good reason!  <br>  <br>  Read all about it here:<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.museum.tv/archives/etv/F/htmlF/fairnessdoct/fairnessdoct.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.museum.tv/archives/etv/F/html...</a><br>  <br>  Excerpts:<br>  <br>  This doctrine grew out of concern that because of the large number of applications for radio station being submitted and the limited number of frequencies available, broadcasters should make sure they did not use their stations simply as advocates with a singular perspective. Rather, they must allow all points of view. That requirement was to be enforced by FCC mandate.<br>  <br>  In ensuing years the FCC ensured that the doctrine was operational by laying out rules defining such matters as personal attack and political editorializing (1967).<br>  <br>  The fairness doctrine ran parallel to Section 315 of the Communications Act of 1937 which required stations to offer "equal opportunity" to all legally qualified political candidates for any office if they had allowed any person running in that office to use the station. The attempt was to balance--to force an even handedness.<br>  <br>  The doctrine, nevertheless, disturbed many journalists, who considered it a violation of First Amendment rights of free speech/free press which should allow reporters to make their own decisions about balancing stories. Fairness, in this view, should not be forced by the FCC. In order to avoid the requirement to go out and find contrasting viewpoints on every issue raised in a story, some journalists simply avoided any coverage of some controversial issues."<br>  <br>  (Well maybe that would shut some of those extremists up huh?)|`|TJtifnxPaa	Obama is against the "Fairness Doctrine" which demands equal time for all opinions in the media (LOL).

No matter what campaigner Obama said about Iraq, he knew as well as anyone else that the facts would have to speak for themselves. Although I would like nothing better than to have all troops home, it is not realistic to expect us to simply load everyone up and pull out. We would leave an unstable country behind us....and WE chose to go in there in the first place so we at least owe those people the best shot we can give them to become a viable democracy. I do blame Bush for the fact that we involved ourselves in a full fleged war...but staying now is for the best. And do keep in mind, that Pres. Obama has now seen fit to ramp up the fighting in Afghanistan. I am fairly certain that the military leaders of our country have convinced him that the search for Bin Laden is not worth the lives of even one more American. (He killed enough on 9/11) but trying to prevent further terrorist activities requires us to eliminate safe havens...whether in Iraq, Afghanistan or in Pakistan.|`|9XAqnmOQaa	I don't think that President Obama thinks that Bush was right to tell the world lies so as to start a war to satisfy his own ego. If we figure that there are about 130,000 troops in Iraq that is a draw down of 80,000. A good start.<br>  <br>  It is not as easy as shifting into reverse to back out of Iraq.

But out we must.|`|8PjHFUdfaa	President Barack Obama's plan to withdraw American troops from Iraq in 19 months would leave behind a "residual" occupation force of between 30,000 and 55,000 American military personnel to provide "security" for Iraq. <br>  <br>  That does not sound like much of a "pullout" to us.<br>  <br>  The New York Times is reporting that this residual force will "continue training Iraqi security forces, hunt down foreign terrorist cells and guard American institutions."<br>  <br>  Wait a second.<br>  <br>  That kind of sounds like what American forces are doing right now.<br>  <br>  The New York Times also says that one of Obama’s national security advisers stated during the presidential campaign that the "residual force" is likely to be approximately 30,000 to 55,000 troops.<br>  <br>  A senior military officer explained the reality of the situation to the Los Angeles Times this way.....<br>  <br>  "'When President Obama said we were going to get out within 16 months, some people heard, 'get out,' and everyone's gone. But that is not going to happen,' the officer said."<br>  <br>  So where did the 19 month timetable come from?<br>  <br>  Well, Obama had publicly expressed a desire for a 16 month timetable for the partial withdrawal, but General David Petraeus wanted a 23 month timetable.<br>  <br>  So Obama decided on a compromise timetable, and so now "the pullout" of American troops will happen in 19 months.<br>  <br>  But as we have already discussed, it is not a true pullout.....<br>  <br>  <a href="http://futurestorm.blogspot.com/2009/02/obamas-iraq-pullout-plan-would-leave-30.html" rel="nofollow">http://futurestorm.blogspot.com/2009/02/...</a>|`|574006cfddcd12427761e075691f5513aa	Obama told people what they wanted to hear.

Every human has a conscience, liberals just know how to ignore it.  This class warfare they keep trying to ignite will be the downfall of our country.  When the successful in this country no longer feel it is worth the effort, then we will become a third world country.  <br>  A liberal is also the most gullable when it comes to environmental issues.  They do not recognize that large environmental orginizations are merely built to draw money from uneducated and gullable people.  Yes, the executives of these orginizations are chauffered in limos and draw enormous salaries.

Personally, I see Liberals as being more tolerant of other individuals views and thoughts.  But I am not saying there aren't those that will argue against someone with a different point of view.<br>  <br>  I would offer to you the example of Abortion:<br>  <br>  Liberals:  typically fall on the side of freedom to choose; may not necessarily believe in it for themselves, but believe that it is the right of each individual to choose whether they use the procedure or not.  They see it as keeping it legal will save lives because legal or not, people will have them done.<br>  <br>  Conservatives:  typically fall on the side of pro-life; see the act of abortion as murder and killing an unborn child because it is their belief.  They don't want the option available to anyone because they see it as wrong, and they don't want it there at all.<br>  <br>  Liberals tend to trust individuals to make their own choices, and to decide what is right for themselves.  They believe in everyone having a chance no matter what.<br>  <br>  Conservatives tend to think that if someone is against them, then that is it.  They feel they know what is right, and want to make sure that everyone follows the same path so that everyone does right (as they see it).  They base their decisions off of moral/religious compasses, as opposed to free thought, unlike Liberals.<br>  <br>  Which is right?  That is up to each individual to decide.  I am Liberal, and that is what I feel.  I am not saying that being conservative is wrong, but it is not how I think or feel.  That is all - it is mere ideology.<br>  <br>  For you to try and pass judgment on others due to their ideology is like telling someone they are wrong because they chose to wear the blue shirt today as opposed to the orange one.|`|G4Y96LGqaa	Oh well said!   <br>  <br>  also, they must be part of the victim class, want to kill babies and let live the people on death row.

On the other hand, I can understand why many people don't want them because there does come a point in time where they can do no more for you.  Now your problem is you can't get rid of them.  Meaning, companies like GM don't need the UAW anymore.  Yet, companies like Home Depot and Wal-Mart can't get them soon enough.  (I've worked for Home Depot.  They have more hot air running out of them than a steam pipe does.) But while there are many things I don't agree with the unions on, non-unions companies really brought it on themselves.  But they want to claim it's everyone else's fault but theirs.|`|bcc62a4f188c1522006cc8ba2c7b102aaa	I welcome their sentiments but believe their course of action is naive, the Democrats can't be pushed to the left.

They talk a lot but every election serve as little more than left wing props and excusers for the reactionary Democratic party.<br>  <br>  Obama took office under conditions of a deepening worldwide financial and economic crisis. His economic policies, the major focus of his first 30 days in office, consist of a series of initiatives aimed at propping up the profit system and safeguarding the economic dominance of the giant banks and billionaire investors, at the expense of working people:<br>  ? The economic stimulus legislation, a $787 billion stopgap measure to prevent a complete collapse of consumer spending and state and local government. While business benefits from tax breaks and infrastructure contracts, and a large swathe of upper-income families get exemption from the Alternative Minimum Tax (worth more than $2,000 apiece), most working people will receive a miniscule $400 tax cut<br>  ? The second round of the bank bailout enacted last fall by the House and Senate (including Obama’s vote), which provides another $350 billion for the financial elite. Of this, the bulk is to be used in another round of cash handouts to banks, hedge funds and other lenders, including the launching of a Term Asset-Backed Securities Loan Facility, or TALF, which will underwrite $1 trillion in low-cost loans to major hedge funds and other speculators<br>  ? The auto bailout (using funds from the bank bailout), which will require, as a condition of new loans to GM and Chrysler, the destruction of the living standards fought for by generations of auto workers. Wages, pensions and health benefits will be gutted, while the United Auto Workers union will be retained as a police force directed against rank-and-file workers.<br>  ? The housing bailout, announced by Obama February 18, which provides relief to relatively few of the millions who are now or will soon face the threat of foreclosure. The measure is so carefully crafted to safeguard the profit interests of the mortgage lending industry that BusinessWeek magazine headlined its report, “A Mortgage Rescue Banks Can Love.”<br>  <br>  These facts rip to shreds the ongoing efforts of liberals like the Nation magazine to present the new government as an expression of popular opposition to Bush and the right wing. The Obama administration constitutes an effort, on the part of key sections of the ruling class, shaken by the failures of the Bush administration and the financial debacle, to delude the American people with vague rhetoric while the most intense efforts are made to safeguard the position of the financial oligarchy, both at home and abroad.<br>  The Obama administration demonstrates the impossibility of effecting any significant change within the existing political institutions and the two-party system. These are wholly dominated by two forces: the military-intelligence apparatus and big financial interests.<br>  <a href="http://www.wsws.org/articles/2009/feb2009/pers-f23.shtml" rel="nofollow">http://www.wsws.org/articles/2009/feb200...</a>

Get married if you like (and you can in many states) .

F1bjZjkaaa	Minors do not have all rights because they are considered not to have full responsibility either.<br>  The right to bear arms, ie being in the militia, is obviously not going to apply to minors. They have never been considered a part of the militia.<br>  The right to keep guns would also be considered a little difficult as a minor generally does not work and therefore any guns they "own" are probably the possesion of their parents or guardians.|`|3caq6SFxaa	No for two reasons-limiting of free speech is allowed in certain areas such as you can't say you will kill some one and some limitations are allowed on the Second Amendment also.  The other factor would be the word Militia which at that time was a designated pool of people between the ages of 16 to 65; the definition of "militia" per USC 47 (federal law) is citizens between the ages of 18 to 65 and not in federal service or subject for recall to federal service, not a felon which means everyone not in the military, military reserve (active or inactive) or National Guard.  Yes exactly the opposite of what some politicians says it means.  That law was established as many states started state militia's and state defense forces with the federalization of the National Guard which prior to that time had been basically state controlled with the federal government being able to ask for National Guard help but could be told no by the governors.|`|CowgOqXTaa	The rights guaranteed by ALL the amendments apply to minors as well as adults. <br>  <br>  However, none of those rights are absolute, and they are all subject to 'reasonable regulation' - to use the 1st as an example, it is not a violation of your First Amendment right to free speech to prohibit you from falsely yelling "Fire!" in a crowded theatre. <br>  <br>  Likewise, to limit or restrict a childs access to weapons would be a reasonable regulation, and not a 2nd Amendment violation.<br>  <br>  Richard|`|WXExyAlWaa	The way I (a non-American) understand it is that the first amendment means that the government will not restrict free speech (but private parties can do so on their property if they wish) and the second means, should mean, and/or used to mean that in order to form a militia to defend the state, citizens had the right to bear arms. As in, you join the army, you get a gun. In relation to private citizens, you may still bear arms, within other restrictions - you need a license, you can't conceal them without an extra license, etc. If a minor obtained a legal license to keep and/or carry a gun, then yes, they would be able to have it. I'm just not sure whether there are laws on minimum age to get a license.|`|k8ivyYfaaa	No, because all states have an age requirement to purchase/obtain a gun; either age 18 or 21.  Unless those laws are repealed, children are not afforded the right to 'bear arms'.|`|AA10118655	The Second Amendment says the right to bear arms "shall not be infringed". It does not say it shall not be regulated.|`|AA11206283	Neither applies in every situation.|`|6Gfz125Paa	The second amendment says that the right to bear arms shall be "well-regulated" through a militia.  The first amendment doesn't start by saying "a well-regulated press..."

bARPX1auaa	Although it is commonly believed that the War on Terrorism is a noble effort to defend freedom, in reality, it has little to do with terrorism and<br>  even less to do with the defense of freedom. There are other agendas at work; agendas that are far less praiseworthy; agendas that, in fact, are just the opposite of what we are told. What is unfolding today is, not a war on terrorism to defend freedom, but a war on freedom that requires the defense of terrorism.<br>  <br>  Quoted from "Rebuilding America’s Defenses" released in September of 2000 by a think-tank group called The Project for The New American Century. One third of the participants were members of the Council on Foreign Relations.<br>  <br>  "The United States is the strongest nation in the world with little fear of<br>  opposition. This is a wonderful opportunity for the American government to dominate the world for the betterment of mankind. It is our destiny and our obligation to usher in an American Peace, a Pax Americana similar to the Pax Romana of the Roman Empire. It is our destiny to do so, and we must not shrink from the challenge. We must establish our military presence in every part of the world as the visible expression of our power. Such bold action will be costly and may require the sacrifice of lives, but that is the necessary price for world leadership. Our military must develop new technology, which, unfortunately, may be slow to develop due to public resistance to the large expenditure required. However, this transformation could be accelerated to our advantage if an enemy should attack us, as<br>  happened at Pear Harbor. In the Middle East, the presence of Saddam Hussein is justification for maintaining a military presence in the region, but even if Hussein did not exist, we should be there anyway to maintain the Pax Americana."|`|T1sJxnwOaa	the war of terror must continue because it is good to kill people that hate you. why bother settling our disputes because that will take too long and they might not wait for us to reach out to them. the smoking gun could be a mushroom cloud. just tell him they have WMD's. it worked last time.|`|AA11571284	We either get them now ....or they get us later.|`|VISJdrMraa	to bad i cant help you because i am anti-war sorry dude.

I didnt get the opportunity to vote against Obama but I would have. He was selected to win,  we know this! Just the other day all the news media on tv and online including Wall Street said that he admitted not watching the markets currently, and that his movement/ideas/money being put in bailing out banks and so on is not allowing our economy to start over and reset itself allowing it to recover and regain its direction in the positive as it would if he would just stop interfering. Anyways, he has most people brain washed and if you look really really deep in research on this piece of CRAP, you would be astonished at how much he has lied about on a personal basis, what a puppet he is, and that most if not all things he said he stood for and would fight for us, was a promise he never intended to keep and used his ability to speak in words that soothe us and gave us faith only to dishonor our country and the people that live here!! I hope he gets pushed out at some point, and I have never been one sided on choosing a party but since 1997, our country due to the democrats has honestly turned our government into a business, more socialist, and has been consistantly moving our country in a direction of failure!! I hope the Republicans and the Democrats that are still willing to fight for the good of this country stand up in the days to come, just as I am ready to fight our government to keep it the way it was intended if the duty ever called!! I say this because I love our country...|`|gsKfSkJ1aa	I bet the market would jump 1000 points in one day!|`|FGW0lcEgaa	Yes!! And I'd certainly like to see him impeached!

We, our elected officials are destroying our government. It is no longer electing someone that has our interests in mind, it is electing someone who lies, cheats and thinks it is his/her right to the job forever. There should be a constitutional amendment limiting terms of elected officials to two terms. End their perks, such as their pension plan and make them go on social security like the rest of us. Eliminate the Ethics Committee and put them under a the law that applies to criminal defendants.

How smart do you actually expect folks like that to be?<br>  <br>  About as smart as the righties here on YA, whose argument runs something like: Sure, our guy stole the election and took office illegally.  He wrecked the economy and ran up trillions of debt without doing anything useful.  He let 3,000 people get killed on his watch because after repeated warnings that a terror attack was coming up he told his briefer "You've covered your ***" and went back to clearing brush.  He started a catastrophic war over WMD that never existed and used torture to get the fake evidence they were there. He had an entire city destroyed on his watch and couldn't do much about it because he'd fired all the people who actually knew about disaster relief and replaced them with his buddies who knew about more important stuff like Arabian horses.  He shredded the Constitution and plunged our international standing to unheard of lows, then he did the same to our economy.

He let his Texas buddies rape the Treasury and Defense Depts.<br>  Clinton has as much biz sense as an earthworm.<br>  Obama is a great orator but has forgotten all about how a free market works.<br>  No, we shouldn't bail out these firms, banks, whatever.

As the commentator on a PBS Frontline special report said on the reasons for the Big Bust, "It's hard to leave a party when you're having so much fun!"<br>  <br>  I've worked for some of the largest multinational companies on the globe in several executive positions.  Believe me, if we ran our department(s) the way Congress is running this country, the way the President at the time runs what he can, the way CEO's and CFO's run their  huge corporations, we would have been fired very quickly.<br>  It's all about greed, power and ego.<br>  You can say what you want to, but when a politician opens his or her mouth, it's all the same "blah, blah, blah." to me.<br>  I'm listening to GMA right now and see where the head of BofA flew to NY today to defend his million dollar bonuses and arrived on his private corp. jet. This after Pres. O said "Those days are over."<br>  I guess that is like the Spanish word manana which doesn't always mean tomorrow but more likely sometime in the future.<br>  These guys just don't care and don't have any understanding of how their actions and decisions hurt every citizen in this nation. They should be charged, tried and imprisoned for the crimes they've committed.  But what do we do?  Give them billions more to waste as they did in the first place.  Way to go!!!!<br>  This country of ours is so messed up, I seriously doubt if anything can really straighten it out.<br>  We use to be first in education and now we're way down, healthcare is a big joke (we spend billions on unwarranted wars and still we drop and dump off like so much garbage sick and injured folks in the slum areas directly from hospitals because they have little, if any, insurance.). <br>  The auto industry really messed up after WWII when Deming offered to strategically improve their products through quality control standards. Unfortunately, he was pushed aside as they had the biggest market share at the time. But who listened to him?  Japanese firms.<br>  I mean, seriously, as a child would you ever have thought GM, Chrysler and Ford would be in such a condition as they are today?<br>  I certainly don't know the answers but unfortunately, what all the ranting and raving, I seriously doubt if anyone else does, also. It's just too big for anyone individual to correct...especially with a wishy washy congress like we've had for decades.<br>  You might think Palin is an idiot ( I don't disagree with you) but just ask the average young person on the street if they can find a specific country on a globe and 99% of them will look like a deer in the headlights.

Real socialism started up due to natural conditions in the industrial revolution in Britain. The corporations trapped workers into poverty where they had little chance of an education, health and safety at work or health care. People fought for rights, the things that make the west a desirable place to live and work. Marx was invited by Engels in the industrial revolution to see what was happening due to the conditions and he went back to write science fiction and was out of touch with what real workers wanted. Real socialism was about freedom and the USA has some laws to protect people. <br>  <br>  If you want real freedom, just look at Asia where the workers aren't in good conditions and the owners can treat them how they like. Even the children have to work where the rest of society has the freedom to not contribute to their education. There are also big differences between rich and poor, where the rich are as free as they like, with none of those nasty laws preventing them from having the freedom to mistreat workers. <br>  <br>  The thing I’ve noticed about Americans, is that many don’t seem to get it, unless somebody else has already written a theory about it, or it has to fit into a category, but that’s not how successful politics works, as to be successful, you need to adapt to the time and conditions. That’s why Marxism never works, as it just follows the theories of a pen pusher, rather than following a natural course that’s needed at the time. Not everything fits into a category. Do you really think that workers wouldn't have fought for rights if Marx hadn't written a theory about it? The USA has Unions so workers can speak out if they feel they're mistreated, and that's one of the things people fought for in the industrial revolution. It wasn't because Marx thought it was a good idea. He just used ideas that were already going on and added science fiction to them. <br>  <br>  The natural state of humans before all the theories was the tribal society, where everybody helped each other out, which is called left wing or socialist, but they also fought to protect their tribal culture, which could be called right wing.<br>  <br>  Sometimes it seems to me as if the USA is more Marxist than many socialist countries, as Marx dreamed of a melting pot of people where everybody was equal and there was no such thing as religion or culture in government. <br>  <br>  If you're all so free and great, why is it in a country with such a big population, you're even more likely to be a star of Hollywood if you come from another country? Even the  governor of California comes from Austria. Maybe your own people are so free, they have the freedom to not have an education and get fat and brainwashed by advertising where you sit in your armchair mindlessly chanting we're the greatest and free, while buying the latest cheap junk because somebody on TV or in a magazine told you to?<br>  <br>  The only people who dream of going to the USA nowadays are people in third world despots or those who see the advantage of a mindless, brainwashed society who will buy any junk  that’s advertised so they can make money. Most average civilised and educated people would rather live in places like Australia or Europe.|`|AA10552262	I can't say that any one country can qualify as being totally free anymore. The socialists are even gaining ground on the leadership of Switzerland. I do like the Cayman Islands though. Great tropical weather and a small enough government (for now anyway) that is not really financially able to carry out too much of a socialist agenda. Excellent banking, transportation and communication services.

tP8W6Q1Qaa	He only has a very limited time to push through his crap... the American people are becoming wise to his game. I read his approval rating for his first month in office is worse than Bush's first month. <br>  <br>  At the rate he is going he will only be a 1 term president. His desire to destroy Capitalism is taking center stage as he implements right under our noses 33 new government programs, raising taxes on every single person by way of removing their tax cuts, and then on top of that charging even more taxes to those who employee personnel. Even in the financial field he wants to take hedge fund managers and alternative investors out of the equation by forcing them to move from capital gains tax structure to regular income. <br>  <br>  No wonder the street cannot stand Obama. He is chasing investors away from the market as fast as he can. Forcing those who employee people to lay them off, stifling the liquidity so banks can lend, and now he is going to force banks to loan the money they received from the TARP when they should be holding onto some of that money to balance the books so they can get everything under control before they start lending again. Now, they are being forced to lend - which is what caused us to get to the point in the first place. Government forcing banks to make loans...

Gn99Fcy0aa	Too smart.....  I think you may be a bit misguided on your premise.  US Military pilots are some of the finest pilots in the world with training that is simply not surpassed.  This is true for all the branches of the military.  <br>  <br>  As far as you being too smart -- the military only accepts the top in not only academics, but also other extra curricular activities you are involved in.  Are you on the student counsel, do you play sports, are you competitive, are you healthy and physically fit enough to be amongst the best?  They look at all of these areas, not just a GPA. <br>  <br>  Only a hand full of people who try to become pilots actually get accepted to flight school, of those few people picked, only a fraction of them ever get there wings. <br>  <br>  I don't mean to sound mean, but the idea that your too smart is simply arrogant.

If you're over a certain age and need an expensive treatment, you will be denied for the greater good of the collective."<br>  <br>  Completely and utterly untrue. You get triaged, which means your needs get weight against the needs of others. People in socialized medicine settings DO NOT wait if they are having a heart attack....do NOT wait for cancer treatment or other critical care. <br>  <br>  But if your jaw is messed up from a car wreck I have to wait for my nose job because....and wait for it....you need the plastic surgeon right now more than I do.  <br>  <br>  And, you know what? Even if what you just wrote was true (even though it ISN'T) We're already there....and you're not denied care because of some abstract social "good" your value as a human being and whether you live or die is based solely on your coverage....solely on your ability to pay.<br>  <br>  Some guy at an HMO already decides if they're going to cover your cancer treatment or transplant ot not.<br>  <br>  If you think THAT'S better????

Or proper coverage payed for them to to go see the doctor to find out how to get rid of a love bite ( yes ive seen both of these in the he yahoo healthcare forum )<br>  Then no they wouldnt be on Y/A asking for medical advice, they would be in the y/a personal finance or taxes forums trying to find out why their taxes are so high and why they are so broke.|`|aeLovejNaa	I don't think Yahoo Answers is the proper place to ask for medical advice.

n2oEhdZiaa	If school is your priority, I would say go for the Army Guard/Reserves just because they will give you more options and job selection than the Navy Reserves.  The Guard may also pay all of your tuition (if you don't already qualify for the post 9/11 GI Bill) plus by getting back in you'll qualify for immediate Tution assistance and you can start adding that in with whatever GI Bill you are using now.  Good luck.<br>  <br>  I'm biased to the Army.|`|K8qAniReaa	I cannot guess your re code.  But the Navy is looking for fewer prior service people and the Army is waivering more than the other branches.

If you have that you will not get into any branch because there is no waiver for that.<br>  <br>  ROTC will pay for your tuition.  There is lots of money in ROTC for nurses because so few nurses want to join the military.  Every branch has an ROTC program specifically for nurses.

Our country will probably be forced into socialism...not because Pres. Obama really wants us to be socialized...but because programs such as the ones outlined in the budget can not be supported in any other way. The government is going to have to take ownership of businesses and maintain over all operations of the social programs that are currently championed by non profits and charities. This will mean a lowering of the standard of living just as we see it in other socialist countries. Basically, there is one truth that all of us must admit to and that is......if everyone is going to have everything, and a high number of people are not being productive so that they contribute to the costs....those of us who are productive will have to bear the burden of those programs and it will not matter whether we are rich or in what is now called the middle class. They have to be paid for somehow...and I think China and other countries will pull the plug on allowing us to keep borrowing against our future (and that is understandable).|`|AA11409272	Striving to succeed is innate in many people., granted many will join the riders...but some will continue to strive, and carry a heavier and heavier burden.<br>  Eventually...we will succeed in leveling the field.

We live in a world quite apart from that of these would be savours of innovation. The entire world economy has nothing in common with free individuals entering competition with each other. The entire free market is socially stratified, so the best and most talented that come from lower and working classes never have the oppurtunity to show their innovation and those of the middle classes are steamrolled into succeeding by the riches they are born into even if they are significantly laking in the department of innovation. The mass corporations of the world are also coservative and have nothing to do with allowing small ideas succeed they are all about co-opting and oppressing them.

fAaLjlI0aa	False Imprisonment: Intentionally restraining another person (whether physically or not) without the legal authority to do so; the unlawful restriction of a person's freedom or movement. If the false imprisonment goes on for an extended period of time OR the perpetrator moves the victim, it may then become a kidnapping. <br>  <br>  False imprisonment can also refer to the detaining of a suspect after service of an unlawful warrant. <br>  <br>  Kidnapping is the act of secreting or holding a person in a place where they are unlikely to be found or moving them across state lines for the purpose of keeping them from being found. It can involve either threats of harm or use of bodily force. It is abduction with the intent to: use the victim for money (ransom) or reward of some sort; to terrorize the victim or a third party; aid or accomplish the commission of a felony or flight therefrom; inflict personal injury on the victim or violate them sexually; to prevent them from performing in their official capacity, such as with a government official or law enforcement officer. <br>  <br>  Abduction is similar to kidnapping, but with less stringent qualifiers. Abduction is taking a person away by persuasion, fraud, or open violence. It includes the taking of women to force them into marriage, prostitution, concubinage. In some states, the law requires that the victim be a minor or subjected to illicit sexual activity. Kidnapping is more limited, requiring force or the threat of force, or the taking of children by an adult.|`|AA11494150	The actual definitions are determined by state law, so they could vary. <br>  <br>  As a general rule, kidnapping is taking someone against their will, and false imprisonment is holding them against their will.|`|AA10850613	Kimberly gave a great response. <br>  <br>  These are defined state by state.

So if you do face charges, mind you you can beat it in court, and make sure they know how it went down.. YOU all did nothing wrong.. Like I said, try to file charges for assualt (they pounced you guys, and harrasment with criminal threatening..) Do what ever ya got do, cuz you just defended your selves.. Good luck hope it helps..

Hopefully, there will be places that show where it is working.  We live in a low middle income area so maybe it is working in areas needier areas.  Good luck on your essay.

These are our extreme to the left wing that love security over liberty, and will achieve neither. Laws will come fast and furious that bind us into socialism and people will welcome the false sense of well being, but honest persons will suffer. The spirit of the rugged individual will disappear and all the accolades will go to the power that be.

He and i were having marital problems when i fell for a kid i worked with (ah, so stupid) <br>  <br>  a mutual friend ratted us out. my divorce papers where already being processed when the report was given, but me and the guy were called out for adultery and 8H (inappropriate relationship) and he got bumped down a paygrade, i lost my spot in my class list (i was due for training in about 2mo) we both got 45 days restricted to the barracks, 45 days extra duty 2hrs a day, 6mo probation. <br>  <br>  it sucked.|`|NPV35jmQaa	An *** whooping insues!|`|gqmtPx8gaa	I've witnessed reported cases of adultery get dealt with by just a slap on the wrist (some paperwork and a do not contact order) and others result in a ticket back home where they get an Article 15 by their commander (loss pay, rank, etc).<br>  <br>  Just like any marriage in the civilian world where one spouse cheats the outcome will vary; some marriages weather the storm others die.<br>  <br>  I think alot of the reason it may happen is because when deployed you often get very lonely- get two lonely people together, who may not be actively looking to cheat, but through the process of spending a lot of time together end up doing just that.|`|A728LXj6aa	If they're found out and it's reported they will be court martialled and either punished (losing rank, loss of pay, etc) or discharged entirely, depending on the severity, frequency, etc.<br>  <br>  On the civilian side, I wouldn't be surprised if most of those cases end in divorce since the military has something like a 50% divorce rate anyway (or so I've heard).

2690a9b184bfb50fbe66cd9b66bb1575aa	I live in an at-will state (Florida) and YES you can still receive unemployment, it all depends on why you were fired. If it was due to misconduct etc then they will deny it. <br>  <br>  The problem right now in the current economy is that MANY employers are trying to deny unemployment claims. I would advise you to keep records of everything, your absentee reasons why, any performance issues keep a record of why and circumstances that led to it. I would be prepared that IF the time comes that you need to file and are denied that you have your reasons as to why it led up to firing. I would also brush up on office policies on the firing or termination process.. even though an at will state doesn't need a reason, it will help your unemployment claim if say for instance you company has a policy of  a specific issue and then fire you for it.. if they didn't follow their own policy it is better for you.<br>  <br>  I was terminated for performance. I am receiving unemployment and live in an at will state.<br>  <br>  one last thing.. if you get terminated get a copy of the termination paper, it will have the reason on it.. this way it prevents them from telling you one thing then filing the termination as a different reason to prevent you from collecting unemployment.|`|AA10118655	Depends on what you get fired for. If it is for something you did, they can deny you unemployment benefits. If it is not (like layoffs due to cut backs) you normally can collect.<br>  <br>  If you get get fired, for whatever reason, file for unemployment anyway. They will contact your former employer, and if they deny you the benefits, you can usually appeal.|`|6YADkFr7aa	As along as you are fired and DO NOT QUIT. Yes,  you can and the reason I know this is I am State employee and considered a at will employee. Always read and understand what you are signing if you don't understand what you are signing then ask to take the form home and seek advice from a lawyer or the EOE agency and be very polite about it.But do not tell your employer or fellow co-workers that your taking the form to seek legal advice|`|C0whMHa9aa	i think it probably depends on the state you live in.  I'm in TN @ it's an at will state.  all it means is that they can fire you for any reason (except discrimination) and you can quit for any reason.  unemployment benefits will depend on what the reason is for your getting fired.|`|ApWg0oH9aa	If you are fired with cause, such as inappropriate behavior, like stealing, etc, then you will have a hard time getting benefits. If you are let go due to layoffs or elimination of your position, you can probably collect benefits.|`|3a37c6d3eb9e914f155df7ad545276f4aa	I work in an at-will state.  Here (as most places) you cannot get unemployment if you are fired.  Most employers have a firing system with certain things grounds for immediate firing such as employee theft, not showing up at work without notice.  Here unless you are fired for such infractions there is no recourse.  But my state also has a system in place for firing.  Written "write ups" are given for things like not doing your job correctly, spending too much time on personal business and such.  Where I work 3 write ups in a certain period (generally 6 months can result in termination.  If so, you are not generaly eligible for unemployment.  If you are let go due to downsizing, finincial problems on the employeers part, you get unemployment.<br>  <br>  Of course there are exceptions to every rule.  One of my coworkers of 15 years got targeted by a new supervisor.  She had always had excellent reviews, given raises with each review.  She was well liked by her coworkers.  The new supervisor did not like her so she wrote her up 12 times in less than 3 months resulting in her being fired.  Fortunately the persons record for good employment stood, she got a better job immediately AND her lawyer has filed a suit aqainst my employer that is in the process of being settled for over $250,000!<br>  <br>  Becouse of things like this most employers are careful of firing practices and do offer "employee counseling" prior to just outright firimg you!

If you're clean, what do you care when your drug tests are?<br>  <br>  I never understood you people who live your lives around drugs. You know you have the tests yet you still want drugs so badly you're willing to risk everything. How about you just stop taking drugs altogether? Then you'll have nothing to worry about. I know that's asking way too much and won't happen. People like you who just can't live without pot will get caught again, it's just a matter of time. You've got your priorities.|`|rf5g1NVoaa	Guess what I am alos on probation I have been on it for almost two yerars and I dont take drug tests cause I havent ever failed one.<br>  <br>  They aint random?  they will be you dont think they will do a surprise drop on you?   -_-|`|KPPScRaHaa	my husband was on probation last year and she always popped a random on him.

e81f5e9fdac66f6ab45eb4396a39fb24aa	In utero?<br>  <br>  Absolutely.  Sorry, but ethically it's only fair to give parents the option on whether ot bring a disabled child into this world.  <br>  <br>  Quite honestly, I think there are just some defects and conditions where it is a thousand times more fair to the child to terminate the pregnancy than to bring them in this world to suffer immensely.|`|zHmZkMStaa	Of course it is!  Such screenings give the parents the ability to plan and prepare for any disability that might crop up.  Some disabilities do not appear till later in a child's development, and it would help to be able to prepare for these in the long term, rather than be confronted with them at birth.|`|oojO4WAraa	Yes.  Same as it is ethical to screen for cancer and other things.|`|6XHesUihaa	Yes, because the parents might not know what their in for if the child is disabled.
OiAl6w48aa	No.  The Court will not have anything to do with illegal activities or contracts (other than to punish you).  I remember reading a case in law school where a guy paid a hitman $5,000 to kill his wife.  When the hitman changed his mind, the guy sued.  He ended up with criminal charges for his trouble, but no money back.|`|ewd9n2lRaa	No.  You could file a lawsuit, but i'm 99.9% sure it would get thrown out of court.|`|oQ4dU8qvaa	The courts will not enforce an illegal contract.

f4ef0b3a83cc1af75c8cb10f391cb5c9aa	Yes, it is legal and it is done more often than you think.<br>  In order to qualify for welfare (Medicaid), your income and assets has to fall below a certain level (you wouldn't want millionaires to collect welfare, would you?).<br>  You have no legal claim on your parents' property. Their property is theirs until they give it to you or until they pass away, unless they have willed to someone else. Before you get your inheritance, however, all your parents' debts and liabilities has to be paid first. That includes debts owed for their care.<br>  <br>  Hope this helps.|`|CowgOqXTaa	They can make your parents sell their home to pay for their care.

62998c1eb5a3f349422d1d49f36b44e8aa	That depends on the size of the employer. EEOC laws apply only to employers that employ at least 15 inidividuals.

a8e1KcS2aa	In short, no.  Just as long as you're honest about it, and get it expunged.  You'll be fine, as long as you don't do it again.  Also, some more advice - start doing push ups and sit ups now, and start running 3-5 miles daily.  You'll get in shape quickly that way, and get used to it for your academy.  Also, you should look into ride-along programs near you.  You should talk to the officers around you and get to know them if you're planning on applying to their department.  Talk to the people you're going to be applying for beforehand and let them know of the situation, and show a change, be mature about it.  Good luck!|`|AA10850613	The answer is: it depends. If it's your one and only then no. If you show a pattern of stupid and/or criminal behavior, it won't technically disqualify you, but police departments are looking for the best candidate. <br>  <br>  If you straighten up then you should have no problem.

The only way I know you can get a spot ahead of time is 4 years Rotc in college in the officer candidate program and if you want to get enough flight time to qualify you to be a civilian pilot when you get out , then I would reccommend either the Navy or the Marine Corps .

Stocks fell as fast as the towers did, but in time confidence was restored because in G. W. Bush we had a president who was willing to fight back. <br>  We began a hunt for those responsible and removed from power a world threat who sought to finance those who mean us harm.<br>  Then as time went on through some tough times and against the democrat cut and run voices of defeat our surge in Iraq worked.<br>  The economy ran strong again and confidence was high.  <br>  <br>  Meanwhile, President Bush warned that there was a potential crisis looming due to a democrat contrived policy to force banks to lend mortgage money to people who did not qualify, and had no solid history of financial responsibility. The President said we had to fix this issue or it would doom our economy. Then Congress changed hands due to the dribble from the liberal media and once the democrats took office the problems began to exacerbate. Nothing was done to fix the problem, ACORN was given a free pass and the banks who had been forced to provide bad loans were on the brink of failure.  The democrats sensing an election issue did nothing except blame Bush.<br>  Then the mighty Obama was elected by a thin majority of people using fake votes at the hands of ACORN. The day the mighty Obama was elected the stock market began to lose value because investors have no confidence in his liberal agenda. In fact, the election day losses are the largest in our history. Now the market has lost almost 30% of it's value as Obama twists his words and dooms America to a depression because of his socialist agenda. Even moderate democrats are beginning to fear his spend, spend spend some more and tax the hell out of everyone via new tax policy. On a false promise of change, he has appointed 4 tax cheats to head the agencies which controls our banking, finance and treasury.<br>  Now you have the story. Bush was far from perfect, but he is a damn sight better than the alternative!|`|BWlcmjc6aa	I am 56 years old and I never remember a perfect USA government.  I also am a history buff and I don't remember studying about a great USA government.

The constitution was supposed to protect us from a federally-run bureaucracy.  Freedom and liberty goes out the window with more government interference, I don't see how you can argue with that.  So, no, not perfect under Bush, but much worse now.|`|zsDATxmfaa	i don't think so because it was bush's last couple of months during his presidency that screwed up everything and now i don't think it's fair that you blame everything on Obama when he's the one that's actually trying to do something.|`|p3NW0Mstaa	No.. the onion (underground paper) got it right.. when Barack won the next day they had the head line "Black Man Gets Worse Job In the World"|`|BC1VXQjWaa	No, no, and Hell NO!
saOsd6ukaa	You are 100% correct. Failed Reaganomics have resulted in an accumulated National Debt of almost $11,000,000,000,000 and nobody has any intention of decreasing that. "Not tax and spend" Republicans have produced the current Bush Depression and we are currently suffering for that. Nobody should worry about their children and grand children paying off the debt, they should be much more concerned about their children and grand children having to take of them.|`|vZy28Yqjaa	Sad to say I voted for Reagan, wasted two hours in line to do so. It's all been downhill ever since. The unions lost strength, jobs left the country in droves, spending went out of control, the average CEO salary went from an average of 44 times that of the lowest paid worker to over 500 times more. The value of our dollar has gone down considerably and we've seen the rich get richer and the poor get poorer.<br>  All these years trying the trickle down theory I think it's time to try a trickle up one.  Bush tried to duplicate the Reagan strategy for the last 8 years and that's how we've gotten to this point.|`|1CCeJ6pgaa	that is no kind of logic. the reason it is going to affect our children and our grandchildren is because there isnt enough money available until that far away to even start to pay on a trillion dollar stimulus bill that has little to do with stimulating the economy. reagan believed in cutting spending and lowering taxes, obama wants to spend like a drunken sailor and raise taxes on EVERYBODY. there is not enough money among the rich so where else are they going to get all of this money. Huh? when the rich are taxed more they will simply cut jobs, not a smart strategy by hussein|`|YaTgrhr9aa	Wrong again as usual, Obama is not a Ronald Reagan by even the furthest stretch of a liberals spin. <br>  <br>  7.8 BILLION in PORK Spending is far from being a Reagan|`|jnxLprxRaa	Yes, Reagan started the policies that have destroyed the economy.

I have people calling me to pressure treat their decks & paint them & it is winter but they know we are going to get busy so they want to be scheduled now. We all create our own economy.

nNmusYZSaa	He who has eyes, let him see how this makes sense.<br>  <br>  Property values were hyperinflated by the long term availability of low interest credit, and lenders willingly loaned money to everybody who asked for some under the mistaken assumption that property values could keep rising indefinitely, which would allow them to refinance these loans multiple times (for ten thousand dollars a pop in fees).<br>  <br>  Alas, values could not rise forever in an environment of stagnant or falling wages, so borrowers began to default, which flooded the market with homes whose values had fallen by fifty percent.  This drove down the values of any investment firm with substantial real estate holdings, and the stock market also began to tank.<br>  <br>  Nobody is going to do much investing of any kind unless they are confident of a decent return, and nobody wants to buy even a distressed property if its value hasn't already hit bottom.  This has led to businesses racking up excess inventory, and laying off workers, which has only accelerated the downward spiral.<br>  <br>  If mortgages can be renegotiated, families might be able to stay in their homes, and property values might stabilize at a sustainable level, and investors might regain some confidence in the wisdom of the market.<br>  <br>  A rise in stocks after the announcement of the help for homeowners might be construed as evidence that the plan is a wise one.|`|YonedWiEaa	actually it does.....you see the fed put money into the markets and then said the economy is deeper than expected, most people in the stock market know enough to get that money before it is spent, in a few days they will sell it off to make a small profit...and the banks will need more money.|`|AA11620670	helping homeowners is a waste? i thought you conservatives were kind and compassionate. oh i forgot, yall are only kind to the filthy rich and big business|`|EOhxXxM9aa	Actually I think the first one says it all.<br>  <br>  Economy spiraled DEEPER into recession in Jan. and Feb.<br>  <br>  Which states the recession was going on before Obama took office!|`|KF48OjyDaa	This is why you guys lost and will continue to lose....how is helping homeowners a waste?|`|RGcXgjEDaa	not really, unless the stocks moving higher were in March|`|CvFajKPUaa	nope, yahoo is under the control of the nazibama mind set, I wouldn't pay attention to anything yahoo says<br>  <br>  <br>  yahoo is as full of **** as obama|`|Gn6jwmzCaa	Your soooo cute Tracky boy....wanna put on a pink frilly dress and play house today?

Hoping to stay at the school, he proposed a term paper for a seminar on nuclear proliferation outlining the design for an atomic bomb similar to the Nagasaki weapon. According to Phillips' supervisor Freeman Dyson, a renowned physicist, and professor Harold Feiveson, who held the seminar, Phillips' design was not functional[1], and the story was widely circulated in exaggerated form. Nevertheless, the Federal Bureau of Investigation confiscated Phillips's term paper and a mock-up he had constructed in his dormitory room.<br>  <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Aristotle_Phillips" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Aristo...</a><br>  <br>  The technology for atomic weapons is 64 years old<br>  <br>  build yourself a bomb shelter if it will make you feel better|`|AA11421582	Read the news a bit more carefully man.<br>  <br>  Obama offered to stop its missle program if Iran completely abandons its nuke program.......Obama has not abandoned anything.<br>  <br>  And I think taking down a few missle systems is worth having a nuclear free Iran.|`|vhuzsMPsaa	Obama is assuming that Iran doesn't have the nuclear tipped missile yet.

So I see someone mentioned revolution, I think this will take place in their party...the dems are happy, very happy & the changes we are making our in ourselves to just be better people in all ways so we might be rebelling against the old stagnant ways of thinking but we are not at war with anyone. I know many republicans & many democrats & I think the difference is the dems are always evolving so they don't need a crisis to get them to clean up clutter. They have already changed their ways & decided to see things with their eyes wide open & take what is of value & leave the rest.

oaeD5B1taa	This is the tragedy of "modern" America....vastly too many people like you who believe in giving up "some" of their Constitutional rights just so they could be "safe" from "terrorism".....it just does not get more pathetic...because you will find to your immense horror that it will never stop at just a little or a few of your Constitutional and CommonLaw rights----George W. Bush is a sociopathic bald-faced LIAR ...and America will soon learn even though it is too late that he and his rotten ilk have always been the true terrorists..<br>  <br>  What is taking place in the public schools of America today throughout the entire nation can only be regarded as out and out skull rape and just that very nonsense is being forcefully dumped right down the gullets of unbelievably gullible American school kids who just don't stand a chance.<br>  <br>  The Founding Fathers  gave us what is still regarded as the single greatest legal document ever written: the United States Constitution and its Bill of Rights. There is NOTHING ...I repeat NOTHING wrong with the Bill of Rights and the "laws made in pursuit thereof"....they are more than enough to protect this country from any kind of terrorism both fancied and real....if someone would merely honor, uphold and enforce them....but what good is any law that no one honors, obeys or enforces and that very much includes the United States Constitution? Do you have any vague notion as to how many wretches we have in public office today who have taken the oath to uphold and defend the Constitution with their fingers crossed behind their backs?....ever hear of Kol Nidre...or the Masonic Prayer? It's worse than sickening.<br>  <br>  True personal freedom hath its dangers....but a plutocratic police state which is exactly what this country has almost become is something you will wish you had never been born to have to experience and see----then you will really know terrorism in a way you could never have conceived. <br>  <br>  I believe it was Thos. Jefferson who said that the person who is willing to surrender a little freedom in exchange for security will very soon find he or she has none of either and that is just what America's modern day brain-dead latte "liberal" and hypocrite neo con yuppie society has brought down upon themselves and are trying to force on the rest of us.<br>  <br>  The true terrorism in America is from RIGHT HERE ON AMERICAN SOIL....not from "over there" ----yes, there are foreign terrorist groups alright and not just Al Qaida---but do you ever ask yourself who created them in the first place and lavishly funded them all these decades and set them up in business and---above all else, inspired them to do what they did like in Spain? The good ole "freedom loving" US of A in collusion with Israel (as in Jonathan Pollard) ---most of the world, particularly the Mid East solemnly hates America's guts because of the nauseatingly lickspittle attitude American political hacks have toward Israel and the AIPAC and international banksters like Ben Bernanke----every bit of what i am saying is fully documented and has been for over half a century.<br>  <br>  I tell you this and I say this as honestly as I have ever spoken in my life-----I wish I could get within fist swinging range of George Bush when he tried to con me into "surrendering some of my Constitutional rights" so I could be supposedly "free of terrorism". <br>  <br>  You think you cry now.....I could launch a battleship on your tears the day you discover just how thoroughly maggot ridden this country's politics is with outright sociopath gangsters and financial parasites...and when you see proof positive that 9/11 not only was an INSIDE JOB but an Israeli black flag op as well and that George Bush was criminally guilty along with most others in his rat regime for 9/11 and the cold blooded murder of millions of Iraqi men, women and kids and quite possibly as much as forty thousand Americans.  <br>  <br>  You really need a brain fix----you need to wake up and so does about 96% of the rest of this palsied nation.<br>  <br>  The "American" people...and I use that term most charitably....don't seem to give a rat's rear end what gets dredged out of a sewer and dumped on the plush carpeting of high office in this country....they paid the price for their sheer and arrogant stupidity on 9/11 and they are going to pay worse as time goes on but not because of the Constitution...in spite of it.|`|D6FBLQfwaa	As Benjamin Franklin said "Those who would sacrifice a little liberty to gain temporary security, would derserve neither and lose both" After the stockmarket collapse of the 20s, fear spread across europe, and that fear lead to the rise of fascism and nazism.

For the love of God do you people realize that there are over 1 Million American terrorist according to the Homeland Security Agency?<br>  <br>  You so right. And the people who will disagree with you reveal their own terroristic agenda. Every American that is unwilling to be imprisoned for their own safety and the safety of their fellow American is obviously a terrorist. <br>  <br>  If they have nothing to hide then why not submit to imprisonment? Right? The Bill of Rights was written by "terrorist" anyway. Those so called "Founding Fathers" were nothing but terrorist to the British Monarchy and should be de nounced by Real Americans.<br>  <br>  Logically speaking the terrorist hate us for our freedoms right? So like duh, if we are all locked up...........WE will have defeated the terrorist that threaten the U.S. Government.<br>  <br>  Be a real patriot people! Go to your nearest FEMA camp and be imprisoned for the American way.|`|l5TKAStKaa	We have too much liberty?  The definition of freedom is overrated.  I have to go to work and report to my superiors on time so I can earn a living and pay my bills on a timely manner.  I drive to work and observe the driving regulations.  I can own a gun, but I can't shoot my neighbor's noisy mutt when it bothers me at night.  I get searched at the airport when I travel by air.  Is that what you call "too much freedom for Americans"?  Those who are truly free are the ones living in solitude somewhere in a remote area with no other human contact to tell them they can't do things.  Seems like your views are a bit communistic.|`|6C287vmdaa	I'm an AMERICAN and I believe in our rights. We have a BILL OF RIGHTS  to protect our civil liberties!

yQ0OzEbZaa	You are so right -- Al Gore and now obama have people staying up nights worrying about their carbon footprint or how climate change is leaving polar bears adrift at sea, I've got the best advice you've heard in a while people - get some sleep.<br>  <br>  Al Gore and his global warming flunkies have half the world brainwashed into thinking our ice caps are melting, our seas are on the verge of boiling, and that everywhere from Miami to Juneau, Alaska is about to be ravaged by tropical diseases from malaria to Dengue Fever. Well, I've studied the science and I've got an "inconvenient truth" for Gore and company - the only hot air that's threatening the planet is coming out of their mouths.<br>  <br>  Global warming has benefited from one of the greatest public relations and marketing efforts in recent history. You'll hear plenty from environmentalists about carbon emissions, clean energy, and the disappearing arctic, but here's what you will NEVER hear them admit:<br>  <br>  Scientists have reaped MILLIONS from their global warming "research." They've turned supporting global warming - despite what the science really says - into a cash cow!<br>  <br>  In fact, these same scientists were trying to convince us the world was cooling just a few decades ago, when that's where the grant money was. <br>  <br>  Thank you again for informative question.<br>  <br>  o_O|`|3c91df9cab412a7ca4201cdaf64121e3aa	So what you are saying is it is better to just slap the poor with the tax than to make them pay it another way?<br>  <br>  They can CHOOSE to ride the bus as opposed to drive their energy-efficient cars, car pool as opposed to drive themselves. . .<br>  <br>  They can CHOOSE to find other ways to save energy.  Most cities have measures to aid those that need it with making their homes energy efficient in inexpensive ways (plastic over the windows, getting them the new bulbs, paying on a "budget plan". . .).<br>  <br>  See, no matter what, there is always a choice.  No one is at the mercy of the gas companies - and the problem those big corporations will have is passing the tax onto those that are hit hard by this economy.  You think that $32 Billion dollar profit during a time when gas was $4.00 per gallon was a nightmare to those guys overall.  They had a lot of explaining to do.  Imagine them trying to explain why they are passing taxes they are assessed on profits (that they don't even know yet, by the way) to people that are out of jobs and trying like hell to pay their bills.|`|deb263b4b540e6e15eba4bdb58835e4aaa	Uh, science is not a hoax.<br>  <br>  Given that you can't tell the difference between fact and hoax, I can't imagine anyone caring what you've always said.<br>  <br>  IF you were interested in the truth (rather than nothing but lies), you could learn something here:<br>  <br>  <a href="http://environment.newscientist.com/channel/earth/climate-change/" rel="nofollow">http://environment.newscientist.com/chan...</a>|`|d65d0f197c64d26de1e69f8246554c11aa	There you go again spoiling the show with logic. You are absolutely correct, but bear in mind that that they never admit mistakes. When the plan does hurt those in the most dire need the liberal answer will just be to subsidize them more at taxpayer expense.

AA11494150	Yes, the incorrect height does matter and you need to correct it at once.<br>  <br>  Even though the initial error was theirs, you were asked to confirm the information before you signed your license. Because you signed, the error is now your responsibility. For that reason, it is possible they may charge you for the replacement, but I'd like to think they won't. <br>  <br>  If an officer stops you, he may suspect you are not the person on the license, and could detain you until your identity is confirmed. <br>  .|`|aTLiaEGxaa	The height and weight indicators on your license are just estimations and are not totally accurate. People gain and lose weight all the time. As long as you did not intentionally do this I would not worry about it. You can look into getting it fixed if it is free of charge, but if they charge you for it forget about it. Same goes for the organ donor program, worst case scenario medics or family would quickly find you are not eligible. Hopefully the DMV will fix this free of charge. Give them a call.|`|04zSamlHaa	Yes you need to get it corrected.<br>  <br>  A license that is incorrect is technically invalid. If you use it for ID with a police officer, they may notice the error and that could be bad.<br>  <br>  Go back to the DMV and tell them the error and it should not be a problem to get it replaced.|`|EcdelIHtaa	Yes you do especially the organ donor thing.. and i'm pretty sure it wouldnt cost anything since they are the ones that made the error not you
F7YzHVyUaa	It's true.  Obama don't care about anyone or anything he hurts as long as he gets his socialism passed.<br>  <br>  It's hard to make money in the market when every time Obama speaks, the market tanks. Can't blame Cramer for that.|`|O3TuQZItaa	What, there was something on CNBC that was even slightly critical of the Obama?<br>  <br>  Oh my god, the sky must be falling.<br>  <br>  The really interesting numbers are for the stock market since Obama became the clear leader. That was the start of the solid decline, and it has been a very sharp decline, over 1/3 of the value of the market. Once it became clear to the big corporate welfare users that they could get free money from the government, they started crying and that further eroded the confidence in the markets.<br>  <br>  The markets will rebound, it's just a question of how much longer it will take with the stimulus packages in place.|`|J3tv9OeVaa	Doesn't matter what your politics are; the fact is Obama hasn't had enough time to cause the damage... sorry to be partisan, but the current climate is a direct result of eight years of Republican control.<br>  <br>  Remember when Clinton was in office and the market was soaring, and the republicans wanted to let the public invest social security funds in STOCKS? Its a good thing that didn't fly or we would be even more screwed.<br>  <br>  Cramer is an idiot, and CNBC is partly to blame for the stock market bubble... all that channel does is push stock, for better or for worse!<br>  <br>  How that jackass got his own show is beyond me.

I always got a kick out of that when I watched him.|`|1FkYHLXDaa	Gibbs is a pompous *** for saying Cramer has a small audience. He (Gibbs) actually grouped people making 250K with those making 25 Million the other day. He is just continuing the pandering. They are still campaigning.<br>  <br>  While I believe this market crash was coming for a very long time, Obama certainly has not helped this situation with his "doom and gloom" speeches. It never should have dropped below 9000 for as long as it has and I do believe his policies are hurting this "recovery" much more than helping it.<br>  <br>  Let's face it. Obama is a lawyer and a professional politician, he is not an economist.|`|saOsd6ukaa	I've watched bits and pieces of this guy's show and he is totally ineffective.

IM30PoPNaa	They have no principles.  All they want is power.  They spent the 6 years of their majority pouring pork into red states.  McCain picked the per capita pork queen for a running mate.  In fact, all the earmarks McCain ran against only add up to about $15 billion.  If you want to seriously reduce the deficit, you'll have to do a whole lot more than eliminate earmarks.<br>  <br>  - - - Update - - -<br>  <br>  Tim: Think hard -- it was McCain who ran on ending earmarks.  I think you must be very confused.|`|5d9pCmjyaa	Republicans in DC have no principles.  Just enough lip service so their apologists can continue apologising.|`|YupMCYHlaa	'Earmarks' and 'pork' are two words the Republicans have tested. They found people react negatively so they use them a lot.  But to Republicans, 'pork' is any money a Democrat spends.  When the Republicans were in charge, there were many more dollars in earmarks and pork, but by constantly using the words 'Democrat' and 'pork' together, they are trying to plant the idea in peoples' minds that -all- pork and earmarks are from Democrats.<br>  <br>  The Republicans want Obama to fail, and to fail big-time.  They want things to get much worse in the US so they can blame Obama for all our problems, as they did with Carter (remember, he inherited his problems too, from Republican presidents).  They don't care how much damage they do to the country, they only care about getting back into power.  So they will never cooperate with the Democrats, that would be handing them a victory.  They will only obstruct and say whatever bad things they can think of to say about Obama and the Democrats, true or false.|`|0918eb31ce1520001d965c6085d6abc5aa	Actually, your wrong. That bill never got passed under bush, because the republicans never voted to pass it, because of all the pork..|`|mHdKANPNaa	Obama's election patform was to change how Washington does business including earmarks that support special interests.

As a republican supporter I admit this. <br>  <br>  So I guess that completely absolves the Democrats of all wrong doing right? I mean it's not robbery if your a citizen robbing someone if you see a cop doing it too right?|`|iJMRmrY3aa	The point is that he ran on ending earmarks.  A lot of Rebublincans voted for him on the basis of this pledge.  But when he saw all those kickbacks going to Democrats he couldn't resist and signed the bill.|`|Z5QL6THYaa	So he should sing Kumbaya and kiss Obama's behind.

It does nothing to address long term concerns regarding funding of the program.<br>  <br>  Daze: You have your bills confused. The Republicans did not add 40% earmark spending to the stimulus bill.

6pdwd3PZaa	I am a recruiter and degrees do mean a lot. This is the deal...hiring managers are VERYpicky right now.

Entry level college grads will have a lot of problems right now.<br>  As far as a colleged degree...it has become a way of weeding out people.

I know your question is where are the jobs.....They are there but you are not seeing them. Where would they be normally? Call every place but if you do it seeing lack or visualizing being told know then that is what you will get.

If America exists at the end of his four years, is that success? If the economy recovers, is that success? And the thing about the economy is that it ALWAYS recovers. It recovers every time. That's the beauty of Barry's little plan. He can use the weak economy to advance all sorts of bad ideas knowing that the United States, even despite him, will always recover. What you have to ask  yourself is whether we recover because of Barry's efforts or despite them. And the thing is, socialists from then on would use Barry's methods as a precedent. That is going to be interesting and most unfortunate.<br>  <br>  Secondly, if Barry succeeds in his multitude of social initiatives and we can't stop them, is that success or is that failure? Is it success that America is weakened and being sapped of its 'life blood' and prosperity? Now, I would say no. But Barry and the gang would say yes. <br>  <br>  So, again, it depends on how you define success. So here it is. America will recover regardless of what Barry does to the economy. That's a fact that's been proven time and again. But there is no way that America will 'win' or even succeed if Barry is successful in implementing his community organizing efforts. Entitlements and such programs NEVER go away and will be a constant tape worm in the belly of the pig. YOU may consider it success, but folks like me know that eventually, that tape worm is going to kill the pig. That, too, happens every time. So be careful what you wish for.|`|Ow3iwCJlaa	move <br>  <br>  but really ha ha yeah right - what do you consider succeding? you mean if it actually works and we bounce back and stay a free market society - well I would fall over, history has proven it is not possible with what he is doing - so he woudl have to CHANGE his policies for anything to work <br>  <br>  or do you mean suceed in making us socialist - if that is the case yes I think he is doing fine and well I would move|`|WCkOUF9aaa	Be very surprised<br>  <br>  Eventually the economy will recover inspite of Obama & not because of him.|`|u23sBafTaa	I think you are trying to put words in our mouth, but I think my chances of winning a really big lottery are better than Obama's plan !|`|SWkaGJpgaa	That's the one thing we don't really have to worry about, now is it?<br>  <br>  Thanks for asking!|`|xmQKZzAwaa	Succeed how?

in936M0Faa	Obama is Terrified of getting into a debate with Rush. No Liberal Media to hold his hand, No teleprompter and 200 million people watching.  Rush would make him look like the inexperienced Empty Suit that he is.<br>    It would be sad to see Rush make The President cry though|`|UzRijICuaa	No I do not think he should debate Rush.  Rush can say what he wishes, and so can everyone else.  <br>  <br>  I think Obama and his clan should shut up about Rush and do his job quietly in the corner.  They look like idiots to get into a mud pit with a radio personality.<br>  <br>  And relative to  identifying Obama as a scholar......being a scholar and behaving in a scholarly manner are two totally different things.|`|o23hIdOvaa	So anyone that challenges the President deserves his time? Get real – why does Obama have to answer to Rush? Republicans are upset that the “Democrats are trying to use Rush as a distraction”, but yet, they want Obama to debate Rush?.. who’s causing a distraction… really?|`|HuzFvd2iaa	NO.<br>  <br>  He has better things to do than debate a deranged comedian.<br>  <br>  If rush runs for president in 2012 and wins the republican primaries then BO will debate him.

Obama is the President of USA besides Rush Limbaugh was invited to debate Campbell Brown from CNN<br>  I guess he chickened out <br>  what do you have to say about that ?|`|AA11828439	No! Why should he debate some one who is just an entertainer? Even the head of the GOP said so. Besides, sitting Presidents don't debate anyone except when they run for reelection. And Rush is just a loud mouthed fool.|`|25faf33e24f40cd4a39b1314c62123a4aa	Obama is afraid too many questions would come up and he might have to answer them without the teleprompter.|`|JUyid5Wgaa	Absolutely.
DB7UMkGCaa	"Another Obama pick owes back taxes, but it's OK because..."<br>  <br>  Because he's a Democrat.<br>  <br>  Watch, the next prominent Republican that owes back taxes (which is rare), is going to get skinned by the liberals on this board.<br>  <br>  Stephen J writes: "If she were a Democrat....Repugs would be screaming that she is not fit to lead and should resign. Hypocrisy = Republicans"<br>  <br>  See? The thing is that in Palin's case, the tax laws had changed. So, what wasnt taxable before, was now. So she sought out an inquiry as to whether or not she owed, and if she did, by how much.<br>  <br>  It was she that initiated the inquiry. She did the right thing. If she were a Dem, she would have hid what she owed. She wouldnt have sought out anyone to clarify for her what she owed.|`|CvFajKPUaa	obama doesn't know any good people, wright, michelle, aryes, rezco, pelosi, biden, his entire cabinet...I would be surprised if he had one buddy who wasn't a criminal moron F-head racist socialist fool|`|0d6d73c79e6856ec69bb6c658154c1ccaa	Not surprising at all hussein wants to surround himself with typical libs and he is doing a great job|`|8eeee84248737295c60d88565ceb0559aa	Did you know that you don't go to jail for not paying taxes if it isn't done in malice?|`|QDpQTwyFaa	every one of them lousy bastrds needs to meet bubba in the bighouse, as not one of the sonsabitches had any intention of paying them. the only reason they did, was to get the appointment|`|wNMQGkzLaa	Agreed..........but don't kid yourself and think that there are no Republicans with this problem, they just haven't been exposed in public, yet!|`|ZUryLF56aa	Maybe we all should get a hold of Obama and the IRS and ask for the same tax deals.|`|ujIinLzGaa	Why are we surprised?|`|yQ0OzEbZaa	At least Kirk can make use of the classic liberal defense so often heard when Bill Clinton was molesting young girls in the Oval Office: everybody does it.  o_O
MWY6yAyraa	Good question...Here's a good answer...<br>  <br>  When someone wants to target a Y/A participant for suspension...they simply go through the history of that person and register complaints until the innocent party is suspended...It's a way of shutting up the opposition...Sound familiar (see "fairness doctrine").  Gosh...those rascally Dems...|`|dHjya1Yoaa	Eh they are just chicken I guess.... I don't care if people see my questions and answers.... They will see that I change my opinions slightly all the time though...|`|YIWKPXokaa	Because trolls hunt down your answers and report you.  <br>  <br>  I have had this happen to me about 3 times.|`|1fxHHrWIaa	Sorry, but that's private.|`|ZXkOQapLaa	Trolls that's why.|`|k6hicodfaa	Trolls.|`|VSX9tzJaaa	well what's your reason for doing it|`|TFdKrkP2aa	I'm not here to make friends, I have a MySpace for that.|`|JLfSKYPJaa	For the same reasons people on answers in any category hide their answers.<br>  a. they often answer a question with a supreme know it all attitude while insulting other opinions as if only their opinion can be correct or even intelligent. If you could see their answers over a period of time you would see not only that their opinions are not consistent but also change with the wind and lack conviction.<br>  <br>  b. you would see those with a best answers percentage above 35% are probably answering their own questions under another profile. This would be obvious by best answers by the same profile over and over.<br>  <br>  c. the record of categories in which  the person answers in would define the type person as to reflect light on their answers in any respect.<br>  <br>  As for myself my profile has always been open, I know what I believe<br>  and am proud of it.|`|HpJ4wwC7aa	Because sometimes people are targeted by people who are out to get them and go back through their questions and answers and report them.

How wrong they are!|`|pGAUjHwvaa	I don't|`|5d9pCmjyaa	Because anyone who posts more than once or twice in the politics section typically end up with at least one stalker who will hound him and report every single post he has ever made.<br>  <br>  Been there, learned that lesson.|`|1ce25e71aa4dd2eb1e82121617a06b87aa	Smile when you say that.<br>  <br>  Stick around kid and you will learn the Gurus from the Trolls.|`|Ow3iwCJlaa	because there are people on here who like to just report you for you questions, and since the reporting/appeals system is a joke well just can everyone unless you know for sure who they are. <br>  <br>  but yes I agree - that is how I thought when I started but since I booted and went private I have seen a sharp decline in violations, it is sad but the fact of the matter, I woudl rather be able to follow peoples arguments that I disagree with and learn from them but most on here dont seem to be the same mind as me|`|Ovj7Nf25aa	Because when your opinion "offends" someone, they are vindictive enough to take the time to go over all your questions and/or answers just looking for a reason to report you.........BE AWARE!!!!|`|ZHfR1lPkaa	Because trolls like to come and violate previous answers and have been known to devastate many YA accounts.|`|WBwlKbLeaa	Maybe they aren't here to get buddy buddy with anyone.

Talk about childish.<br>  <br>  Secondly, without handlers and teleprompter, he'd melt like butter on a hot griddle.  There is no substance to man and he doesn't take criticism well at all.|`|AA11105711	I would be very upset at any president that took the time to "debate" a radio personality.<br>  <br>  The challenge should have gone out before he became elected.  To do it now is really a false challenge.|`|AA10138269	President Obama intellect would become stagnate if he debates someone as incompetent like Rush. Rush is not worth his time. He had better things to do.Your issue with the teleprompter is pointless.|`|qThmcR1Aaa	This isn't a debate society. Obama has more important things to do than argue with some antagonistic blowhard with a microphone.<br>  <br>  And I say that as a fan of neither man.|`|vJzvJysSaa	I would hope that President Obama has more class than that sweaty pill popping gas bag Rush.

Obama is a politician, and his job is to lead, and to change the failed policies of the Bush Administration. Limbaugh's job is to entertain, and he does so by being an *** hole.

It's too easy to throw stones and then run and hide.<br>  <br>  volleyballchick:  Obama and Rahm Emmanuel are the ones who started mentioning Limbaugh by name, giving him significance.

People who are following Rush have no clue as to what good there is out there in life & they will not see it by being obsessed with him. His supporters remind me of teens who hang around with a bad crowd then eventually wonder why they didn't break away sooner.

SZdVYrSSaa	First of all, you need to get in the habit of not saying anything that isn't asked of you. In Politics, everyone has to place Rhetoric on the highest pedestal, one bad Gaff can be the end of your campaign, look at Howard Dean. So get in the habit. If someone asks you if you know what time it is... you reply with yes or no, not the time on the clock. And be sure that you have the wit and mettle to speak publicly, and to understand every issue. A good politician is only effective if they are aware of everything, may it be psychology, linguistics, domestic issues, world trade, the benefits and negatives of free trade, economics, energy, physics, local, national, and world history, <br>  <br>  As well, you need to keep your record clean. When running an election, your adversaries have whole committees devoted to finding out everything they can. If you stole candy from a convenience store in 3rd grade, they'll know. If you smoked weed in college at a party, they'll find a former classmate who'll confirm it, if there is a picture of you anywhere on the web doing ANYTHING that your voter's district would find offensive or questionable, they'll publish it. <br>  <br>  You need to be squeaky clean, or else, you will be shredded piece by piece until your political opposition has turned you into a joke.<br>  <br>  You need to know that you won't get much time for anything else. Most high level politicians live in Washington half the year, and in their hometown during elections. They travel all the time, sleep 4 hours a day at most, work from 7am to 2am, rarely get a moment to enjoy a film, or their family. <br>  <br>  Also, health will be very important to you. Most young politicians make it early in their career because they promote a healthy image, so you'll want to make sure you keep yourself looking thin, fit, and young as long as possible, as this will be a great calling card for you when you go up against an older adversary.<br>  <br>  Also, though some will tell you different, it is generally true in America still that the better colleges you attend, the faster you will begin a large scale career. I.E. Going to Tufts, or Harvard, or Yale, or Princeton, or Georgetown will increase your odds substantially over someone who went to Kemp State or Wills Community College. <br>  <br>  As well, you'll want to not play the "gay candidate" card. It is fine to be openly gay, it is fine to support gay rights, but you won't win a thing if you make your election all about it. You need to develop a comprehensive platform and stick to the most predominate issues, not the most applicable to you. This is public service, and politicians know that going into it. President Obama didn't get where he is today because he talked about being black at every corner. He got there by being the best candidate all around. <br>  <br>  And finally, keep in mind that everything you write, is attainable. Don't ever submit a paper, or research work in college that doesn't stick with your political platform, because even if you are three years into office, the discovery of a paper you wrote in college on the legalization of LSD, or the ending of a woman's suffrage rights could not only destroy your career, it could cause you to be brought up in front of a grand jury on charges of misleading the American people.<br>  <br>  It is a TOUGH field, and one that requires great compassion for your fellow man, great fortitude to continue, great honesty, great individualism, a love of speaking, and learning, AND LOTS OF READING, and a commitment to those in the public you serve, to put them first. Ahead of yourself, your hobbies, your partner, your children, your family, and your friends, but despite all of this, it can also be one of the most rewarding and necessary careers in our modern age.|`|Ao52XHjCaa	Well, you can start from the beginning.<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mEJL2Uuv-oQ" rel="nofollow">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mEJL2Uuv-...</a><br>  <br>  After that, and internship with a legislator helps quite a bit as it gets you connections to the party structure and grandees who support your candidacy when it comes to run and introduce you around.|`|97ef16e9c13a4597a175d5786da95200aa	After you are elected, you need to payback the people and beaurocracies who help you get elected.

If you aspire to be a politician then you have set your sights low in life.  All the great politicians are professionals in other areas who have taken on the government and won.  Doctors, lawyers, teachers, clergymen.  People with experience of life and a cause.  Not people who want to be a politician for the sake of politics.  Real politics is about policy not politicians.  Study something that matters and when you know enough to make a change for the better, thats when you should consider politics.  We need real people in politics.  not careerist spivs.|`|D9AUzmZRaa	That every nook and cranny and thought and deed and fantasy and mistake and alley and person you have EVER done or seen or felt or said or partaken of will eventually become public knowledge.<br>  <br>  And if you're OK with that, a good solid knowledge of World History, Philosophy, Math, Science, Environmental Issues, Social Etiquette, Foreign Policy, and how to speak and write correct English will prove to be very beneficial.|`|146MzXiTaa	you have to be willing to lie with a smile on your face, and sell it.<br>  <br>  you have to be willing to sell your soul.<br>  <br>  you have to be willing to be hated by an entire country...maybe even the whole world.|`|GXxC8CIfaa	Make sure you know exactly what your constituents want so you can tell them exactly what they want to hear...then do the exact opposite and then when it goes all wrong....blame it on Bush.<br>  <br>  I agree with the surgery...|`|sI3kqp7xaa	You have to be black, well spoken, and rise through corrupt chicago.<br>  <br>  Anyone that gives you problems, must be thrown under the bus..|`|800b0874823e869f861f3f446edd7438aa	How to be a good politician would probably be helpful.|`|vweoheAvaa	My best advice is to read up on it(wikipedia or google).|`|AA11175573	that depends on where you plan on going into politics if it is the United States, you might want to rethink that.|`|SPsYrJJEaa	Lie when you start and lie when you finish.!!|`|G2PRIe3laa	Have the surgery|`|lFzFtiCBaa	lie with a straight face...make sure all your skeletons, stay in the closet for good!|`|1i38fqNuaa	Expect the worse, but prepare for the rest.|`|peEHzKGDaa	You good at lying?|`|8ivnzNi5aa	Do you have a soul?

This would be the state where you live.<br>  <br>  "They did not fulfill the contract." - Your failure to enforce the contract does not prohibit them from doing so. You have no proof that you placed them on notice of the default.|`|GJKWgx0Paa	you haven't said what kind of dispute this is.  for the cited law to apply, it has to be one in which you are a consumer and the other party is a merchant.<br>  <br>  if that is so, it would seem that they'll have to sue in your state.<br>  <br>  ***<br>  otherwise, they are free to sue where the contract says it is made -- over there.|`|sIwwznnOaa	Wow, this is a tough question.  I'm not sure what the scope is for a debt collector to sue.  You should probably consult with a lawyer. When I had a legal question, I used quicklegalanswer.com. It was fast and very cheap. It helped me with my legal issue, I’m sure someone over there can help you with yours. Anywho, best of luck!!  Let me know if I can be of more help!!|`|8a60141ea10cc0c778578bb0f86b6be3aa	First of all, AND DO IT NOW, is formally dispute the debt by A) calling the agency and filing a formal dispute over the phone.  This is legal, and if they don't take your dispute over the phone and file it, then you no longer owe the debt.  <br>  <br>  No. 2, tell them to PRODUCE THE NOTE.  Unless they can produce your ORIGINAL signature on the receipt, so to speak, guaranteeing payment, they cannot legally collect the debt, period!  This also works if your house is in foreclosure.  Force the bank to produce the note.  If they cannot -- and most can, but it will take them a looooonggggg time to do so -- you no longer owe the debt, period.  <br>  <br>  No. 3, by law, they have to inform you of the filing, the court, etc.  If they are going to sue you, it has to be in their jurisdiction, which means you can call the clerk of the court for wherever small claims court is and ask if such a thing has been filed against you, and where you can send your response.  Then write a letter to the judge telling him that this is a disputed debt, and that you asked the company to produce the note and they could not.  <br>  <br>  In short, yes, they could take you to small claims court, and yes, they can even get a judgment against you for your failure to appear, or at least respond.  But judgment is not payment, and a judgment can definitely be disputed on your credit reports.  <br>  <br>  Furthermore, according to the Fair Debt Collection Act of 1974, the collections agency must follow certain laws, or you no longer owe the debt:  <br>  <br>  1.  They cannot threaten legal action unless they are prepared -- or have already -- followed it through.  This means generally that they have papers prepared and they are being filed Monday.  <br>  <br>  2.  They can only call you once a week, and only between the hours of 8:00 a.m. and 8:00 p.m., or it is harassment.  <br>  <br>  3.  They can speak to NO ONE about your debt but you.  Some states say they can talk to your husband, but they CANNOT talk to your sister, your dad, your best friend, your daughter, your schnauzer, and they especially CANNOT talk to your boss.   Anyone that they discuss the debt with besides you = third party disclosure, and then you no longer owe the debt.  <br>  <br>  4.  They can only collect on debts that are less than seven years old.  <br>  <br>  5.  There are lots of little laws that protect you, the consumer, from evil debt collectors -- and they're all evil.  Look them up and don't let them bully you.  <br>  <br>  A little story.  My husband was passing through Indiana and he lost his wallet.  11 years later, we get a notice from some third party collection agency wanting to collect on his telephone bill.  What telephone bill.  He was only there for a day?  They called and called and called and called, sent lots of letters, etc.  I told them, Hey, first of all, it's not his phone because he never lived there.  Secondly, this debt is more than 11 years old, which means you cannot legally collect on  it, period.  <br>  <br>  She says, But the debt is still owed.  <br>  <br>  I said, No, actually, that debt has been paid.  <br>  <br>  She said, By whom?<br>  <br>  I said, By you, when you bought the debt.  Thanks for that.  Have a nice day.  <br>  <br>  She never called, wrote, mailed, nothing ever again.  <br>  <br>  in short, most collection agencies cannot collect a debt without breaking the law in some fashion.   Know what the laws are, and when you catch them, their punishment, by law, is you no longer owe the debt.  <br>  <br>  Have fun sockin' it to 'em.

These are liberal rules.|`|f02313bbf6326c5b58f30cd80bc1329eaa	No, Rush is a person with an opinion. He doesn't like Obama's policies, I have not heard him say anything about his race.

Saying Obama sucks is not racist.<br>  <br>  Believe it or not, people can disagree with people on more than color or race. Also I think if we keep throwing the racist card around racism will stay with us. In fact, the people throwing around the term racist I think are the real racists. They are the ones who keep racism around and keep the heat of racial flames burning.|`|pGjD5TTxaa	i think that The President "don't refer to him as Obama he's not Seal" Obama is doing an extraordinary job by ignoring the haters who are throwing all these accusations at him.

And non of this is going to change when they are running around, "mating" with each other with little or no thought of the offspring.  Plenty have tried to help these people but it seems as if they are beyond help.  They don't have what it takes to function in a modern civil society.<br>  <br>  It would be great for everyone if these people changed.  They attack whites, kill without regard and would rather take a hand out then work.  I personally don't know what can be done for this group of people.  Every bit of help that has been sent their way only weakens them more and leads to more innocent deaths of other types of people.<br>  <br>  From my visits to Africa I know that the mentioned people are not welcome there either.  These ghetto soldiers are a strain on society.  These people take and destroy with no thought to bettering themselves.

A side note on Green Peace: I have dropped them from any further consideration as an organization that I once supported.

But there are liars and thieves among the police also.|`|tPvjd8qqaa	Your question appears to be motivated by prejudice and ignorance.  If you think it is so bad, why don't you join the fight against it by becoming a cop and getting into the Internal Affairs Division to help root it out.  <br>  Your question infers that you must have some personal experience or personal knowledge.  If so, you should report it.  And don't say you can't trust the police as there must be some honest cops because they found these two you refer to.  <br>  What I'm saying is, put up or shut up.|`|RtmfVevbaa	Cops come from the same neighborhoods, at least the good ones, from which they police, I say this to say, police are a microcosm of society, so you will have thieves, drug addicts, alcoholics, pedophiles, spousal abusers, just like regular people. I trust them all until they do me wrong, not putting me in jail, but steal, abuse, or otherwise commit a crime against me. When I see one in trouble I do not paint the whole department with that same tainted brush. To answer your question is impossible, but it seems like you do not really care, since your mind is made up, that they all steal!|`|6PhSENcXaa	Not all police officers are corrupt, it's few the mess it up for the rest.  And they do not make extra for shaking some one down or taking away the drugs and all from these people. <br>  Cops are like teens or others, a few make a bad name for the rest!  It's not fair to judge them all for just a few bad ones. <br>  I read of 3 teens that got caught selling drugs, so that means that there are millions more teens out there selling drugs also who haven't been caught yet!<br>  You complain about them but if you got into a major problem, who are you going to call for help?|`|a8e1KcS2aa	A great minority of officers participate in these activities.  You should stop looking for the bad seeds in blue that give us a bad name and start looking at the positive officers who are out trying to make a positive difference in the lives of people who don't have much.

bARPX1auaa	"Totalitarianism is on the rise everywhere because advocates of big government have taken leadership control of the power centers within every society. Power centers are organizations and social groupings – such as political parties, labor unions, church groups, media centers, and professional societies – that hold political power based on their claim to represent their members and on their ability to lead public opinion. It has taken many years for them to achieve this dominance over society, but they have succeeded. It does no good to complain or to theorize about what should be done. As long as advocates of big government hold the power, nothing will change."<br>  <br>  Copied from Freedom-force.org<br>  <br>  Simply Replace "Totalitarianism" with "Nationalism"|`|NcFWcO3Laa	Because people tend to love their country, especially most Americans.

8OYONwrpaa	Where and when do you plan to marry?  If in the US you should obtain a fiancee visa first.  He can apply for that on a fiancee visa<br>  petition Form I-129F.  If you marry outside the US you need an<br>  immigrant visa to enter the US to reside.  He must then petition for<br>  this visa on Form I-130.You can expect many months delay using<br>  either procedure.   See uscis.gov for the forms and instructions.|`|5axNEp8jaa	As far as I am aware the USA has a 6 month cooling off period (as they call it) where you have to wait 6 months to join him in the USA. I think you would ideally apply for US citizenship as his spouse, if you are both going to Spain to live later you may then lose your US citizenship, but as you are a EU Citizen you can live there quite freely but your husband will need to go through the proper visa immigration channels, as far as I know Spain is quite difficult but it is possible.

But Bush deserved all the credit for the surplus he ran and the huge growth in jobs and our economy while he was President.|`|In4WJAnRaa	I think the markets crashed because of AIG who is still in debt wants another bailout, That indicates that the banks are in a very bad condition which means the $1.5 quadrillion bank debt is starting to get noticed.|`|h9SHkkWlaa	Sure.....Obama was as responsible for the miniscule increase today as he is for the 2,000 point drop in the less than 2 months since he took office.|`|yYbAF1hHaa	BUT BUT BUT BUSH SAVE IRAQ<br>  <br>  ha hah hahahaha hahahahahhaha<br>  <br>  from wmd;s<br>  <br>  h ha ha ha ha hah ahah|`|55NKPb82aa	Remember the President does not effect the Market.......LOL|`|7tn9tdenaa	The whole banking system is f*'d up ... the gov't should have just scrapped it so that we could start over.

The market only hurts on days when he says stupid things, like mentioning nationalization of the banks.|`|QjdHnrZiaa	The market does well when Obama shuts his mouth and does less.  The more he says the worse it gets.  So yes he could take credit for keeping quiet.|`|BRyRtQSvaa	The day ain't over yet

u7LSohRyaa	I think he'll try. He seems to only hire people who think the same as he does so it's like he's a one man army. I hate to say it but his actions seem to indicate that making abortion a priority seems to be more important to him then making health care more affordable and keeping people from losing their homes. There was a time when I thought he cared more about our teens making better decisions and not having a need for abortions but now I know better. He fought against the baby born alive act. Now he's hard at work removing all restrictions to abortion. What about supporting women that want to keep their babies? What about supporting birth control information, making it more available and all that? Nope.Abortion is all he seems to care about. I could understand it if it were his last priority but his FIRST? O hell no! Maybe he'll be a good president in other ways or have a change of heart. Who knows what 2012 hold for us.|`|17fc727d7da626634a4721e34bc49363aa	No, you're mixed up.

One estimate is that even without birth control about 80% of fertilized eggs never reach the end of the first month. They either never attach to the uterine wall or disconnect for any one of a variety of reasons. Discounting stillbirths and crib death, we're talking about 24 BILLION dead zygotes just for the 6 billion people alive today.<br>  <br>  Now, since we are all tainted with original sin, this means if those zygotes have souls they go straight to Hell when they're passed by the woman's body.<br>  <br>  This means our loving God who came to Earth and died for our sins has no problem with 24 Billion souls going straight to Hell without even having drawn their first breath or even had their first heartbeat. If you want to argue that life begins at fertilization then you're also stuck with a cold, heartless God who damns 80% of all humans right off the bat. Unless you're Catholic, and the Pope declares Limbo valid this month. In that case there's 24 Billion souls in limbo instead of Hell.<br>  <br>  And that's just for the people alive today That ignores all the generations that came and went before us."|`|VMuZYfMwaa	This is so lame.

697f4b7e2abf668416acd21a3fe138f0aa	That's funny, because I am looking at it right now.  Our current tax law gets its basic structure from the Tax Reform Act of 1986.  That law can be found in Volume 100 of the U.S. Statutes at Large starting on page 2085.  It is Public Law 99-514.  That law has been amended through the years since 1986.<br>  <br>  The tax laws are codified as Title 26 of the U.S. Code. You can do a search for it in order to read it. Like it or not, it requires that every individual with an income higher than the standard deduction must file an income tax return. Like it or not, the law says that there is a tax on income over a certain amount. It is NOT voluntary. It applies to all fifty states, etc.<br>  <br>  EDIT: Your original question was not, "Is it true there is no income tax law?".  Instead, you asked, "How many people know...?" Since the premise behind your question was wrong, you received answers appropriate to your question. BTW, an Internet video is not an appropriate place to get information.  Your video is conspiracy theory nonsense.|`|S6XSLvjLaa	I think the IRS code is law - isnt it?<br>  <br>  Some people say it is unconstitutional.

The real danger is the enemy knows EXACTLY what route you're going to be on, they have a pretty good idea of of WHEN you'll be there and it is on their home turf.

Under the Federal Banking Agency Audit Act (enacted in 1978 as Public Law 95-320), which authorizes the Comptroller General of the United States to audit the Federal Reserve System, the Government Accountability Office (GAO) has conducted numerous reviews of Federal Reserve activities. In addition, the Board's Office of Inspector General (OIG) audits and investigates Board programs and operations as well as those Board functions delegated to the Reserve Banks. Completed and active GAO reviews and completed OIG audits, reviews, and assessments are listed in the Board’s Annual Report "<br>  <br>  <br>  "To ensure financial accountability, the financial statements of the Federal Reserve Banks and the Board of Governors are audited by an independent outside auditor.

lQcdYkz7aa	I suggest instead of worrying about your jail time that you worry about your lifestyle.  If everyone around you has been going to jail and you're now going to court then maybe it's a sign that you are living the wrong kind of life.  Find new friends with better morals and you'll see that you won't have to worry about court dates and jail time anymore.|`|a8e1KcS2aa	Boss, you're probably going to be released from institutions when you're 18, possibly 21. (This is if you're adjudicated delinquent and have a more conservative Court Commissioner.)  Also, you're probably going to end up in an adult institution later in your life.  I do not say this to be mean, but I say it so that you face the reality.  Where I am, 83% of juveniles released from a detention facility make it to an adult detention center within 3 years of their release.  This is staggering and I tell you this now so that you still have a chance of salvaging your life and turning yourself around.  Nobody says it's going to be easy, in fact, it will be difficult, but worthwhile.  The first step, however is to try to not let the label of delinquency bring you further into the system.  Try as hard as you can to change your surroundings and your peers.  Try to seek help from a mentor if possible.  I have been involved in programs that help underprivileged youths and juvenile delinquents find constructive ways to spend their time, and I see great promise out of many of the individuals involved in these programs.  Good luck to you, and remember, you've got your entire life ahead of you.  Now's your chance to make a difference in your life and make a big change.  Don't throw your life away.

This allows a military member to apply for reassignment to a specific area/base, due to a valid family hardship. The military's definition of a "hardship," may not be the same as yours, however. The military's definition of "hardship" is when there are extreme family problems (such as illness, death, or extremely unusual circumstances) that are temporary in nature (to be resolved in less than one year), and the specific circumstances necessitates the military member's presence and no other possibility exists for resolution of the family difficulties." If the problem is not one that can be resolved within one year, a hardship discharge will be considered, vs. a hardship assignment.<br>  <br>  Basically, how the above applies to you is that if your mother is not going to get better or die in a year, they are going to go for the hardship discharge instead of a hardship assignment where you remain in place.  Sorry to be blunt, but the others had it correct, just get out.  I have a friend whose child need to have surgery for a brain tumor and they reassigned him to a base near the hospital until she she was well and done with her therapy.  After that (about 8 months), he was free to deploy, PCS, etc).  However, that was a situation where the situation was going to be resolved in less than a year.  your sounds like it could be longer than that.  Is your mother your dependent?  Do you get public assistance to help you with her care?  If the answer to both is yes, then she can be considered under EFMP and you could get help (put her in an assisted living home) and you could still deploy and not put someone in the position of doing your duty. If that is too much to bear, just get out.|`|3caq6SFxaa	You can request a delay in deployment due to hardship but if this is going to be long term then you need to request a hardship discharge.  You should not stay in the military if you wish to be stationed the same place and never deploy because you are making some one take your place when it is your turn to go.|`|9dd7255bfe9e90bbd64019154baae7a6aa	Either stay in and Do Your Job, or get out and take care of mom.

The US was convicted by the World Court in Hague for its participation in the destabilization of a democratically elected government in a country called Nicaragua. The US under both Democratic and Republican administration has supported terrorist regimes throughout the world. These countries have tortured and disappeared their own citizens. <br>  <br>  The French were behind the huge Rwanda massacre, so the US is not alone. The US cleaned up after the French.<br>  <br>  As far as 9/11 is concerned, I'd do a little research into false flag operations. Americans used to fight communists.

It is not a criminal offense, unless he stole the money, so there would not be any criminal punishment such as jail or fines imposed by the state.  That also means that you would not be able to call the police and ask them to assist you because police do not deal with civil lawsuits; they only handle criminal misconduct.<br>  <br>  Civil lawsuits are between people, or parties, when one commits a wrongdoing against another.  Here, as you presented, one party has failed to follow through on the terms of a contractual obligation.  That is grounds for a Breach of Contract cause of action, especially if the contract was notarized.  Most jurisdictions agree that if the contract is in an amount exceeding $75,000, that a signature or notarization is obligatory to validate the contract as legally binding.  Legal binding means that a court of law would recognize the contract and be willing to intervene if one party failed to follow through on his or her terms.<br>  <br>  Even if the man transfered ownership to another party, in this case his son, the man who made the contract is still liable for his contractual obligations made previously before the transfer of ownership.  Given the facts you have presented, it would be likely that a court would agree with your friend and realize that the other man failed to follow through on his contractual obligations.  When one signs a contract, the terms become obligatory, meaning if one fails to preform the contractual duties, there can be legal repercussions.<br>  <br>  If your friend wins the lawsuit, the other man would be required by law to follow through on his contractual obligations, in this case pay the $100,000.

ugWaptu2aa	Your friends should contact an attorney and explain their situation to counsel. In most states, there is a Code of Regulations that stemmed from the Supreme Court case of Miranda v Arizona. While there is no federal law that requires any law enforcement agency to grant a phone call to those arrested, each state has a way of determining how to regulate procedure. California, Illinois, New York, Virginia and the District of Columbia offer the right to a phone call. Defense attorneys can usually argue that denying a person who has been arrested a phone call is equivalent to not allowing the person the right to counsel and could motion to dismiss. So really it depends on the regulations of the state. <br>  Here is a link to the ACLU and their "Bust Card" which offers helpful hints in the event anyone is arrested. While the phone may not have been invented at the signing of the constitution, neither was Miranda rights and that is the law at the moment. <br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.aclu.org/racialjustice/racialprofiling/15865res20040714.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.aclu.org/racialjustice/racial...</a>|`|HpJ4wwC7aa	Yes, EDIT: well it depends, based on the additional facts you gave.<br>  <br>  If they are going to continue questioning you, they have to allow you access to call your lawyer for legal advice in case if you request it - 6th Amendment & Habeas Corpus. Or so you can call a friend or family member to come bail you out.<br>  <br>  EDIT: In your friend's case, they probably weren't going to question them and they needed them to be secure because maybe they were drunk and disorderly. Usually detox is a hold less than 24 hrs anyways. The phone call is only allowed if they are planning to hold you for more than 24 hrs (usually the time limit until they must arraign you) They have to give you access though if you are going to continue to be held on other charges and are going to be arraigned. But detox is different because they are just keeping you until you sober up and then they usually let you go and it is only a violation.|`|a8e1KcS2aa	As I've told every prisoner I've arrested/detained, the phone was not invented during the drafting of the Constitution, and as such this is not guaranteed by same.  If they request their lawyer if they're being questioned, then we have to deliver that to them, but so many times these people ask to call friends/relatives, and that is something that I don't allow them to do if they've been uncooperative with me.  I generally give them a phone call after I've brought them through the process of booking and presentment, as that way they will already have their bail information.  So the answer is no, you're not guaranteed a phone call by the constitution, the phone call is a privilege allowed to cooperative prisoners.  If someone wants to act a fool in my cell, they'll be waiting quite some time for that phone call.|`|AWSmknxLaa	There is NO law requiring any phone call at any time.<br>  <br>  Normally they allow you one call after you are booked,  but they do not have to.|`|04zSamlHaa	Technically speaking, there's no right to make a phone call. We may instead offer you the opportunity to have somebody informed of your arrest, and contact that person for you.<br>  <br>  A lot of people think you are legally allowed to have a phone call and thats just not true. You sometimes do not even know your bail amount until first appearance which can occur the next day. <br>  <br>  You will either be allowed a call at some point, or they will ask you who you want notified your under arrest and where you are.|`|AA11494150	I've never seen any laws that address this, it is a matter of jail policy. <br>  <br>  The phone is a privilege, not a right.

If you do not cooperate with the booking, they will lock you down and not provide you with phone privileges. <br>  <br>  The phone can also be taken away for disciplinary reasons, or if allowing the person to call would jeopardize an ongoing investigation. <br>  .|`|6PhSENcXaa	If they were drunk and disorderly they probable just kept them in a cell because of it.

2zym4J9xaa	My brother works Intel... intel is not for the brains guys.  My brother is a C student and basically an idiot.  He scored a 71 on his ASVAB.  All he does at Intel is look at pictures or Arab faces and match them to names.<br>  <br>  You should have went NAVY Nuke!  There is where the brains are.  You can also go Air Traffic Control.  Those are the two brain jobs with the high drop out rates.<br>  <br>  A 92 is just a percentile in 4 sections of the ASVAB compared to others who took the test.  Its not a percentile on the test.  You could have scored a 70% on the test and still end up with a 92 as your percentile score.  A person who scores a 90% on the overall test can score a 72 in the percentile.  It matters where you missed your questions... in the graded or ungraded section for the overall percentile score. You actually have to have high enough line scores to be eligible for any job.  A 92 could be worse than a guy who scored 72... it depends on what section you missed the points in.  For the percentile score they only grade Math and English.  All your Mechanics, Electrical. etc etc are not computed in the 92.<br>  <br>  I scored a 96.  But my line scores were better than my 96.

(Take it to your court prothonotary and ask them what you need to do to get it expunged, should cost about $75 bucks depending on where you are, and it's quite worth it.)  Good luck in your application process!  Also - remember, it is very important to be truthful about it in your application process.

If a cop asks if you were convicted of a felony you have nothing to hide either. You have not been convicted of any. Tell the truth though, because there is a lie detector part. The results aren't added to your personal record but it can hurt you upon recruitment.|`|dAsrWr3Maa	Yes.  It depends on how strict the department you are applying for is as far as hiring standards are concerned.  Be sure to put the misdemeanor on your f-3 form (personal history statement) and you could even attach a statement to your f-3 explaining.  I'm almost positive you wont be able to get in expunged because you were convicted, but im sure there are ways around it.  Just fess up to your mistake and hope for the best.

pFrjLlJ4aa	You will either have to get permission of your ex or permission from the court before you will be allowed to move your child out of the jurisdiction.  If your ex does not ever exercise his visitation rights then you will almost certainly be able to relocate if you are married to someone who is being transferred . . . but to move to follow a boyfriend?  Judges tend to be a little less sympathetic about these kind of issues.  You will really need to put a period on this marriage before asking the court to let you toodle across the country with another guy.  <br>  <br>  Unless you have a lawyer, you will need to remain in the jurisdiction (or be prepared to return to the jurisdiction for all of your court dates) until your divorce is final anyway.|`|50b371e8637dae2470606af52c269bacaa	You will have to get your exes permission to move out of state.  You have to be able to provide reasonable access to the child whether he chooses to act on visitation or not.  Full custody only means that you have full rights to that child, but the other parent has an expectation of reasonable visitation.|`|Zm8sQpKLaa	You picked a good time to file for divorce.<br>  <br>  When you file for divorce, make sure that you have the stipulation in the decree that you and only YOU have the right to say where the child resides.<br>  <br>  Some things happen for a reason.....|`|0tdkyvtKaa	As a father in the same situation as your ex. You are able to do as you see fit for your child as long as he does not have joint custody with you. Otherwise you make all the decisions for that child no matter where you live.|`|RxeQJcqhaa	You are planning to move yourself and your little child to follow a man you are not even married to?  I would re-think that decision. Bad idea.|`|FInaB3HBaa	You will have to get the court's permission before moving.  Even so, I've seen it happen a lot that the court decides that if you move, you must give up custody to the father. All he has to do is ask - sometimes he doesn't even have to do that, the court could just do it on its own. Then you'll be paying him support.  In my humble non-expert opinion, if that love is real, it will last in spite of separation. Stay and take care of you and your child and not put that at risk. You have too much lose. If lover doesn't understand, then he ain't lover. I know that's not what you want to hear, but please listen. Your child matters too much. Now, that's LOVE.

The area is anarchic and full of the militant jihadists that are causing Pakistan so much trouble. For years the Pakistani Government has refused to enter the territories with force because its so terribly overrun and chaotic. It is, however, a necessity in my opinion to fix the leak instead of continually cleaning up the mess. Clean up those mountains, regain law and order, and the rest of the country will have a lot easier time falling back into place.|`|3YydMgt0aa	Well, future = no International games of any kind to be played there.|`|zmmP52P3aa	Even if terrorist nuke the US its very unlikely that we would respond in kind, but if they nuke India I would be looking for a fallout shelter shortly thereafter.|`|81e525d2b0af9f7090cd857fd7b2095baa	I don't think so, and they will realize that life sucks a lot more after their country collapses.

Otherwise, it would be kidnapping.|`|OHfZFR31aa	It doesn't matter if you are married or not. You need his permission to take the children out of the country, even for a visit, unless you have a court order granting you sole legal custody. If you take the children out of the country without his permission, it is considered child abduction, which is a crime and you could go to jail for it. If your home country and your childrens' father's country have a reciprocal agreement, you could even be arrested in your home country and the children would be returned to their father|`|reHRXlZCaa	The fact that you're unmarried is irrelevant, if he has parental responsibility then you need his permission to take the children out of the country. <br>  <br>  Even if he doesn't have parental responsiblity, you should still consult him & get his permission (in writing) that he is aware that the children will be leaving the country and he is in agreement with it.  Try to get it witnessed if possible and put arrangements in place for visitation.   <br>  <br>  You should really consult a solicitor, they'd be able to go through the implications of taking the children out of the country and international law relating to child custody & abduction.  If you can't afford a solicitor, call your local citizens advice bureau, you may be able to speak to their solicitor or recommend a source of free legal advice on children's law.  <br>  <br>  It's always best to ensure that you know exactly what the law is on the issue and make sure you adhere to it where possible.|`|AA11828121	If he's paying child support and in the children's life then yes you do have to get permission. <br>  <br>  I know this because my best friend moved to WI when we were 17 and after having her son with her ex boyfriend she wanted to move back to Okla. because he paid child support and was in his sons life he wouldn't give her permission and the courts said if she went without his consent then it would be considered kidnapping, and yes she was the primary caregiver.|`|2AqU4SjYaa	Laws vary country to country and state to state . . . . <br>  <br>  having said that, the father of the child is STILL the father of the child regardless of whether the parents were married or not.<br>  <br>  Reverse your question, how would you feel if the FATHER just took the kids, to a different country?

You need the fathers permission to get a passport for 1 thing.<br>  Another is the the international laws on parental abduction. If you were to remove the child to the UK (just an example) and the father filed a complaint you could be arrested in the UK for parental abduction. It is best to get the fathers consent in writing or a court order giving you full custody. Marriage has nothing to do with it nor does the birth certificate. The fact is that he is still the father and still has certain legal rights until a court changes those rights.<br>  As far as saying that you don't know who the father is: that constitutes visa fraud. In the US it's 10 years federal prison. Other countries may not be as nice! Do you really want to commit visa fraud?|`|ba91f39977984e4e7308c5858b127eeeaa	You don't have to.

Z6lhZiXsaa	Yeah, strangely enough it is illegal. It's a really silly law and I don't think it is actually enforced.|`|HpJ4wwC7aa	No. If a person successfully commits suicide they are dead and you can't prosecute a dead person. If someone attempts and fails, they can put you on a psychological hold to protect yourself and others. They don't usually charge you with a crime but they will keep you in a state mental hospital until they feel you are well. If it was made to defraud an insurance company for life insurance benefits, you could get charged with some type of insurance fraud though.|`|XNfjaPaSaa	No, suicide is not a crime in most states.  If someone attempts suicide but doesn't succeed, they can be forced to undergo emergency psychiatric treatment, but they will not be charged with any crime.  Assisting someone else to commit suicide, however, is a crime in many places.|`|iasxKR3jaa	Well, how can it be illegal if they are going to die anyway? But you should tell someone if you know of someone who is suicidal|`|WkbuoG9Qaa	Suicide was once considered a Common Law crime, but when states attempted to enact legislation to make it a crime, it was essentially unenforceable.  Since the early 1990s, all states in the United States have abandoned all statutes declaring suicide a crime.  So, there are no longer any states in the nation that legally recognize suicide as a crime.<br>  <br>  Suicide, in the United States, is never treated as a crime.  That is to say that individuals are not fined or punished criminally for attempted suicide.  Since the government has an interest in the physical well-being of its citizens, it will instead demand that the individual participate in some form of formal counseling or emotional/psychological treatment program.<br>  <br>  The legal system does not see suicide as a physical wrong-doing, but rather the consequence of an infestation of a deteriorated mind or emotionally unstable state.  With that, social policy would hold that it is more important to provide psychological assistance rather than physical punishment.|`|yj3GT7jOaa	Should a State consider suicide to be illegal, it would be referenced to how the insurance companies allocate payment to the beneficiaries as regulated by the State Insurance Service Commission.|`|2AqU4SjYaa	No.  It is not "legal."<br>  <br>  Even when terminally ill, . . . it is not legal.   Dr. Kvorkian (sp) go arrested for assisting people who were terminal to end their lives.<br>  <br>  Call 911.  Get help.

pFrjLlJ4aa	Yes.  You can be arrested for Taking a Motor Vehicle Without Permission.<br>  <br>  In the eyes of the (criminal) law, this is your stepfather's car.  Who paid for it is a matter for civil court and police officers are not going to care that you have a receipt.  Additionally, as a minor you were not legally able to buy the car anyway - so that receipt isn't quite as much evidence as you thought it was.<br>  <br>  If you are the correct (lawful) owner and your stepfather refuses to sign over the title, you can take him to small claims court.  You'll present the evidence that this is your vehicle and sue for the value of the car or the title.  Remember, though, that you'll be responsible for insuring the vehicle.  Additionally, if you are living in your stepfather's home and you do something like this you had better be prepared to pack your stuff and find another place to live.  So I'd suggest that you think long and hard about the pros and cons of suing him over this car because living on your own is a big step and a great deal of responsibility.|`|AA11206283	uh...it's his car.<br>  <br>  Period.<br>  <br>  State goes by registration and title.|`|Zm8sQpKLaa	Yes, unfortunately for you, he can create legal issues for you.<br>  The ca\harges vary from state to state. anything from stolen motor vehicle to unautorized use of a motor vehicle.<br>  <br>  I would do whatever is necessary to get the car registered in your name, and be done with the problem.|`|CowgOqXTaa	If it's registered to him then he can tell you when you can and cannot use it. <br>  <br>  Even if he says you can use it, and it's "really" your car, you can still get in legal trouble.

The main issue I had with Pres G W Bush & the Congress of recent years was their spending habit and Pres Obama & the current congress are no different on this issue.

The quote to which I refer is from Theodore Roosevelt and goes like this:  "To announce that there must be no criticism of the President, or that we are to stand by the President, right or wrong, is not only unpatriotic and servile, but is morally treasonable to the American public."<br>  It is something all those so quick to defend Obama and act all offended by people who verbally oppose him should think long and hard about.  Your rabid defense is indeed servile, and very, very blind.<br>  The White House has sunk to the level of low-level, junior high gangbangers, calling names and throwing stones at individual citizens.

You can't actually buy a true assault rifle right now anyway, but if you're looking to get something a little sporty like an sks or an M14 maybe an m4 yes I guess.  They have a history of going against guns more for the way they look so I would be more worried about getting any composite stocks or accessories to make the rifles look like battle weapons rather than the function of the weapons themselves.|`|GOpDGnsXaa	Then they come straight to your house.<br>  Find the video of FEMA pushing a little old lady around taking her weapon with all the looters around.<br>  Hansel and Gretal.|`|kCSJyM8Laa	Buy silver and gold as well as weapons and ammo and hide them for later use....see, this is exactly what the founders were afraid of when they insisted the populace stay armed....as a protection against an overreaching out of control government|`|ciqAXgCgaa	i thought assault rifles were already banned?  last time i checked i still can't get a kalashnikov.|`|y3XaJhhAaa	Buying a assault rifle (Fully auto I'm assuming) has been illegal and always will be.|`|TvD9BIGRaa	Amen Dr. Phil!|`|5zJmqpMPaa	Not a bad idea.|`|JV75Iz3eaa	Probably a good idea, yes.

Outdated, and not powerful enough to defend you against government forces. You would only aggravate them with such a quaint weapon. I would go with a microwave cannon, or an acid rifle. They might think twice before trying to stroll onto your property like they own it if you could melt the quarter-panels right off their squad cars. If you have a large enough generator you might be able to build a strong enough laser to hold them off. You may or may not have the capacity to arm yourself in such a way, I don't know. But if all you had was an assault rifle, I would just leave it in the closet. It will just get you killed.<br>  <br>  Remember the story some years back about those guys in LA that had body armor, assault rifles, and even armor piercing bullets? Well, they still lost, and they were only up against the police. How would you intend to defend yourself against the National Guard, or God-forbid, a regular infantry squad, or mechanized armor? Remember that government lawyers are currently under the impression that during a time of war, the President has the authority to place military forces into ANY neighborhood, and arrest ANY citizen, and hold them indefinitely in the interest of national security, courtesy of the patriot act.<br>  <br>  If you are a person who feels threatened by the government, you will need a lot more than an assault rifle to do anything about it.|`|fKFvzlzQaa	An assault rifle is a fully automatic machine gun.<br>  <br>  Fully automatic machine guns have been illegal for years.<br>  <br>  What Obama calls an assault rifle is not really an assault rifle.<br>  <br>  However I would buy the guns that Obama wants to ban before he bans them.<br>  <br>  I would also stock up on ammunition and reloading supplies so that you can reload the spent cartridge cases.|`|yrDqtazLaa	1. What do you want an assault rifle for?<br>  <br>  2. Obama isn't banning them, he doesn't want to. He wants to make it harder for people to get them because guns are abused.|`|lMKy9Ho8aa	what for??? are you planning on MURDERING someone??<br>  <br>  of course not!!

The man started his damage well before he had the right. He just couldn't wait to get our country down. He gave the people the sense of disrespect for our flag and has convinced the democrats our constitution suddenly not right for us. He has encouraged terriost by befriended one and being a loyal friend to a jew hating pakistani.accepting millions from foreigners for campaign.<br>  Now that we are facing a depression  or recession what is he doing, just playing with the poor people giving them false hope. I will cut your taxes but didn;t add but you won;t be able to have what you want cuz i'm raising taxes on everything. what a bunch of bs.<br>  So don't talk about how bad Bush was. I wasn;t ever worried when he was in office. I know he was working for us not the arabic countries.If he wants to help africa so much go home and help them. If your going to help us then why not start helping instead of putting more dead weight on us. Since you managed to get a nonamerican citizen into the office he should be helping us get back to some resimulence of what we were instead of dragging it down further.|`|888173de53a1103582161858fdde458caa	Are you happy still working at one you can't handle?<br>  <br>  Addition:  Failure looks like the bipartisanship promised by Pelosi and Obama.|`|41ebd12ba67eeb8a3a4ac05bc524403caa	George W Bush is very happy.

The best case scenario we can hope for is that Obama's plan spurs some short term (within the next few years) growth.  But I think that will happen with or without his plan.

If the state NEEDS you to testify in court as a witness (which is likely will), you can sometimes testify behind a screen, etc. for "your protection."<br>  <br>  Additional: The State is not a witness, the officer that came to the scene is a witness, you are witness, but the State a/k/a the D.A., the Judge, etc., isn't a witness.|`|gqmtPx8gaa	I believe basically it gives you the right to testify on your behalf at trial.|`|DTNlqnOEaa	In order to be fair, the accused is usually able to see the witness in court, as they give their testimony. In some instances, the witness is also the person who laid the complaint, that resulted in the prosecution. <br>  <br>  In some cases, that involve minor children, who accuse that they were sexually molested, the court may order that the child give testimony from a remote location, by live video link, so they do not have to look at the suspected molestor, or be fear full.

It detailed how Mexican drug cartels crossing the border into the US to purchase military style weapons which they cannot purcahse in Mexico. This allows them to be better armed than the police in Mexico and has lead to many firefights with law inforcement in Mexico.

Mexico is missing a huge tourist trade with the USA by being a unsafe country to go to and the average Mexican is going to have to help and that means reporting any illegal activity they see or know of, it could be annonomous but it needs to be done. Mexico has alot of good people and they are going to have to fix it, if not the USA is going to have to invade because we can't have a terrorist drug cartels controlled country on our border.|`|BgExwcvMaa	I would give the people a fighting chance to make a good life in their own country, and not push them to become criminals in another country by promoting good business that pays a good wage.

If I were president, I would to my best to clean up the corruption that is endemic at all levels of government.  The U.S. government had the same problem almost 140 years ago when Ulysses S. Grant was president of the U.S.--his entire cabinet was rotten to the core.  Widespread tolerance of corruption at all levels of government is what's keeping Mexico's poor from getting ahead. What do they do?  They're naturally gonna hop the fence to get away from all that.   The Mexican government should also pay substantially higher wages to its civil servants and law enforcement to limit the need to supplement through blatant kleptocracy and/or drug dealing.  If the corruption is out and the people are getting paid a living wage, there will be no need for Mexicans to cross over to green pastures if their own grass is green.<br>  <br>  That said, Mexico should also do border inspections on their end.  The U.S. mantains vigorous checks of anyone crossing through the border gates.  Mexico should also do this at their borders---namely to stem the flow of illegal contraband guns coming from the U.S., which is contributing to the spiraling violence in Mexico, which could also boost illegal immigrants later, (or worse things).  They check their borders vigorously on the Guatemalan side.  It would serve them well to check the U.S. side too.|`|wzwUcjvhaa	Perhaps provide jobs might be a good start Maybe think what is best for the country as a whole instead of ''what's in it for me'' Perhaps really caring about people instead of driving at brake neck speed running everyone off the road blowing your horn as you go to your communist meetings Maybe not taking your sons to ''boys town'' as a right of passage to simple the young girls Maybe give some money to help people instead of vacationing in Vale Co and spending <br>  thousands Maybe drop the line ''poor Mexico so far from God so close to America'' and take some responsibility that you country is a failure would help Maybe give back the oil companies you nationalised from the Yankees Maybe treat the people on you southern boarder with respect and set the example instead of telling the Yankee ''treat our people well'' Maybe not cheating stealing sneaking into America than waving the flag of Mexico might set the tone Maybe treating Mexican Americans with respect and not calling them wet dogs might help would be nice|`|7rCASaZIaa	If I were president of Mexico, why on earth would I want to stop people from leaving.

AA10057599	if you didnt get the gi bill kicker the first time then you most likely didnt qualify for it.  not everyone gets it.  but you did get the gi bill.  therefore you dont get to have it again.  if you either go reserves or active you WILL NOT be offered the gi bill again beacuse you have already had it.  similarly you are not going to be qualified for an ROTC scholarship either for the same reasons.  what you should have done is while you were in is to take advantage of the tuition assitance program and saved you gi bill money for once you got out.  <br>  <br>  so basically here it its. no more gi bill money for you.  not getting an ROTC scholarship.  so either go reserves or active duty, but this time take advantage of the tuition assistance while your in.|`|n2oEhdZiaa	If you have only been in the Reserves, then you just got the Chapter 1606 Reserve GI Bill.  If you go active duty after three years you will qualify for the Chapter 33 GI Bill.  If you go active duty and want to pay into the old GI Bill, it's Chapter 30.  I think you'll have that option.  If you stay in the Reserves, once you mobilize, deploy and return, you'll qualify for more money, i.e. Chapter 1607 to augment the 1606 because you have extra active duty time.  The Reserve GI Bill isn't supposed to be enough to live on since you don't have much active duty time, it's supposed to augment a job.  If you didn't get a kicker when you enlisted, you probably were not eligible.  You can ask your unit about negotiating for one, but I doubt it.  Good luck.|`|x5c7ek7paa	I doubt you could negotiate a kicker, 1607 is deployment length dependent and marines don't typically have long deployments. You are eligible for the new GI Bill as well, it is active duty time dependent (including reserve deployments) and I believe you get maximum payment for 3 years active duty after 9-11-01. That may be your best option. You can switch your remaining GI Bill time over to the new GI Bill.<br>  <br>  here is a link that breaks it down:<br>  <br>  <a href="https://www.gibill2.va.gov/vba/vba.cfg/php.exe/enduser/std_adp.php?p_faqid=951&p_created=1217513051&p_sid=9UxWWYrj&p_accessibility=0&p_redirect=&p_lva=&p_sp=cF9zcmNoPTEmcF9zb3J0X2J5PWRmbHQmcF9ncmlkc29ydD0mcF9yb3dfY250PTY2LDY2JnBfcHJvZHM9JnBfY2F0cz0wJnBfcHY9JnBfY3Y9JnBfc2VhcmNoX3R5cGU9YW5zd2Vycy5zZWFyY2hfbmwmcF9wYWdlPTEmcF9zZWFyY2hfdGV4dD0xNjA2&p_li=&p_topview=1" rel="nofollow">https://www.gibill2.va.gov/vba/vba.cfg/p...</a><br>  <a href="https://www.gibill.va.gov/pamphlets/CH33/CH33_Pamphlet.pdf" rel="nofollow">https://www.gibill.va.gov/pamphlets/CH33...</a>

The being fired over it thing depends on whether you have any "right to work" type laws in the UK, i.e. did she sign an employment contract.  If she's publicly missrepresenting the company she works for, yes she should have been terminated.|`|vGu6bcR9aa	1.) Yes<br>  <br>  2.) Why not? She put it all out there. She made it all accessible to the public. <br>  <br>  3.) Yes. Her profile was public. It was open for anyone to see. And that's what I don't understand about these sites. If you went up to someone and told them they should carry a file around with them at all times (to the mall, Wal-Mart, wherever) that contained all sorts of personal info as well as their private thoughts and give that file to ANY person who asks for it they'd think you were crazy.<br>  <br>  But that's EXACTLY what so many people do with these sites...and wonder why it bites them.<br>  <br>  4.)

RNEIC8X0aa	If you think times are tough now, just wait...President Obama plans to expand the role of big government in this country to even bigger roles. He and his crony lawmakers in congress and across this once great nation are currently proposing a series of new taxes and government agencies. They want to tax everything from computer downloads to legal brothels, to marijuana, to creating national heath care. This is just another case of politicians attempting to squeeze every penny out of taxpayer at any cost.<br>  <br>  America belongs to every American, uncluttered and untainted by government greed,corruption, and socialist ideologies. This was once a nation that was full of choices and one in which we all should have taken an active role in. Unfortunately, I'm no longer sure that this is the America in which we live.|`|AA10772154	It is impossible to PAY THE DEBT WE ARE GETTING TO ! - The so called stimulus package will employ people for 2 or 3 years and then ZERO.

There has been more of that in the last two months than the entire eight years before. At least, we know where the present money being spent is going.

I know you don't want to talk about the ten trillion dollar debt that was created by the war and welfare for the incompetent and corrupt leaders of Wall Street. If Obama does get us further into debt it will be transparent and we will know what the money is being spent on.|`|mFa5ZDtcaa	What if?<br>  <br>  Obama IS digging us deeper.<br>  <br>  Am I the only one who sees the irony of Obama saying by restructuring the way we bid contracts we MIGHT save $40 billion a year (he doesn't really know because he hasn't a f*ckin' clue how those contracts work) yet he just signed a $787 Billion spending bill and is waiting to sign another $410 Billion bill.<br>  <br>  Excuse me, how is that going to reduce the deficit in half?|`|R1LvhhTeaa	Mother of Gawd - are republicans really this dumb?

It will take at least two terms.   I don't care if at the end of Obama's presidency the economy is 10x as bad as it ever was with the great depression, the blame ultimately belongs to Bush.  Maybe in 50 years we can do a documentary that explores Obama's presidency and policies, but for at least the next 40 years all blame has to go to Bush for everything.  <br>  <br>  I still blame Bush for my D in my biology class last semester.  And I have gained 5 pounds in the last year thanks to Bush.  And I noticed my gold swing was off last week.  I couldn't figure out why.  Then it hit me who was responsible.  Nice try Bush.|`|GGDPbT8taa	I'd prefer to use "when" Obama digs us in a deeper hole... We a going to have to tax everyone more, e.g. Obama's energy tax will hit any individual that drives a car and uses electricity and every industry that uses fuel (shipping, farming, etc), but even that will only cover a portion of it.  There will be so many new taxes that are not income taxes that every one will be paying more for everything.  If anyone believes only the "rich" will suffer, then you have not been listening... The rich will be taxed an extra 4.5% for money earned over $250k (that does not even come close to covering the costs he is talking about). And by the way stopping the wars wouldn't come close to covering it either.|`|AA11086243	first off... I'm not saying Obama is blameless... but to imply Bush has no hand in this, which you seem to... is laughable... where is that personal accountability? why do Republicans get a pass on that?<br>  <br>  and also, personal accountability isn't an answer to "then what"... it's a blame game of what happened... <br>  <br>  but it depends on the variables... why hasn't the economy improved? what are the stats... where is the economy failing at the time? personal spending? home market? banking? auto industry? and why are those failing...<br>  <br>  and then looking at answers to those issues and who offers the best answers... <br>  <br>  much can happen between now and then... and to guess what we would do based on not knowing what happens in between is difficult...<br>  <br>  Obama would have a hard time getting re-elected though... even if it were outside forces... just the way things go...|`|aFC72tLZaa	There was no accountability during Bush's first bail out plan.  Where did that money go?  There was no accountability when he approved illegal wiretapping.  There was no accountability when he approved torture.

But I should not be surprised when you consider that they swallow every load of spew that Rush Limbaugh feeds them.<br>  <br>  Here are some facts that the wrong wingers refuse to accept but they are facts none the less.  When FDR entered the White House, the Unemployment rate was around 25% and within 2 years he had it under 20% and it dropped more every year except 1938 when he listened to the republicans and dropped some of his jobs programs.  He then resumed his policies and the unemployment rate kept dropping all the way to 4.7% in 1942.  After the USA entered the war, the unemployment rate dropped down to 1.2%<br>  <br>  The unemployment rate never hit double digits again until Reagan messed up the economy.<br>  <br>  Yes, facts that you will never here a republican talk about.|`|cr5EoqVjaa	No. He showed that Keynesian economics is a failed approach.

They do not check your medical records - only go by what you wrote down in all that paperwork you filled out. They are only checking at MEPS to make sure you pass a drug/pregnancy test and look and act healthy.|`|qALsBIFHaa	Nah, if you can act normal and succeed in the military MEPS will not look at your records.

AA10060784	Collectively, the poor people earn more than the rich people. This is because there are millions more of them. Nine hundred poor people may make as much as a single rich person, but that doesn't make them rich, because that money is split up nine hundred ways. Individually, they're earning so much less it's not even within the realm of comparison.<br>  <br>  Think of it this way. If you take $10,000 from the bank account of, say, a Fortune 500 business exec, they'll still have plenty of money in that account, whereas if you take $10,000 dollars from the bank account of a working single mom with two kids, she won't be able to make her next rent payment on their apartment.<br>  <br>  Sure, maybe she wouldn't be in that situation if she'd gone to college. But not everyone has that opportunity. Not every minority student gets a scholarship, and if you're in a certain income bracket, a scholarship is the only way you can afford to get into college. Also, not that this should even need to be said, but not all poor people are minorities. I know quite a few white people who couldn't afford college.<br>  <br>  I'm not saying we should take all the rich people's money away. That would be stupid. But increasing taxes on them will cause a lot less financial hardship overall than increasing taxes on the lower and middle classes. If you increase taxes on the rich, they're not going to starve, go into heavy debt, or lose their homes. And with the national deficit the way it is, we need to increase someone's taxes.<br>  <br>  So Obama is increasing the taxes where it will do the least harm to the least amount of people. Maybe it's not fair, but life can't always be fair to everyone. If you had to choose between Paris Hilton not being able to afford another three dozen diamond-encrusted collars for her teacup chihuahua and a father not being able to afford new school clothes for his kids, which would you pick?|`|n5wvy5FYaa	No one can factually explain to you it's a good idea because it proves otherwise.

The poor and middle class pay more with their lives, and the Republicans would rather run up a deficit to pay for wars than have their big bosses pitch in just a little more that they wouldn't even feel.  And where would they go that has lower taxes? Some 3rd world country? Or another civilized country whose taxes would be even higher?|`|JvXUTTqJaa	tax cuts for the rich create jobs, yeah right. have you seen the unemployment figures. for what they have done to this country  aig,<br>  wall street, citigroup,etc, they should pay all the taxes for the next decade. then go to prison. you posted a long bag of duh.|`|ZzXxRLWcaa	The numbers are higher because the amount of the principal is higher. This is basic math man.<br>  <br>  And your numbers are skewed, and your only considering one percent. If you consider the top 2 percent, that group earns more then 95% of Americans COMBINED. And the taxes they do pay are not even the proper percentage, as they still have loopholes to take advatage of.<br>  <br>  95% is the backbone of the country, dont forget that. <br>  <br>  Lets say you have a guy making 50k a year. And lets say he pays 15k in taxes. If you hadd another 10k or whatever to that, you will break this individual.<br>  <br>  Now lets say you have a rich guy making 100 million dollars a year and he pays 20 million in taxes. Do you think it breaks him if he pays another 10k? 50k? A million? No of course not, its peanuts.<br>  <br>  Your forgetting relativity in your computations.<br>  <br>  Also, this idea that "all rich people work harder then anyone else" is bogus.

The Russians shot them and suffered from anti-intellectualism for years.  Seeing as the rich have had vast Capital exploited for them, or have occasionally exploited it for themselves from the rest of us, feeding the rich to the exploited might seem a better use of the resource but in the spirit of redistributionution I think they should simply pay back some of what they have taken in higher taxes.  The English upper classes used not long ago to think that was a great idea compared to being forced to earn a living doing real work for the State, they have done so and remained rich while paying for the health service etc, why should the American working class get less?  Oh yeah, they got conned into opting out from the Empire (which also incidentally outlawed slavery 60 years before the US) by the rich.

The don't care if the person worked hard, took risks and sacrificed. They don't care that the more you tax them the less money they have to put back into the economy. They only care about money being doled out evenly even to those who don't bother to graduate high school,|`|I8M5kw5Saa	No one cares that maybe just maybe that so called rich man worked hard for that money.Like one of your answers said they are all rich because of mom and dad ,will I have news for you .Some of us have a few dollars put away for retirement that worked DAMN HARD for it but Obama wants us to share with others because they didn't make the same money as me as a nurse or my husband that works in the oil fields does.Well come along with me to change someone who is bedridden and cant move and you must change the bed and bath them or spend the night on a wet ground trying to get an oil rig going again and still have to work the next morning.So if we have a few dollars I think it should be ours and I didn't see anyone else helping me or my husband to do our job.No I think just because Obama or anyone else says someone is rich they need to look at what that person did to get those few extra dollars and then leave it the hell alone.By the way how many of you work for the poor man?

Degrees in Public Administration, Accounting, Business, Business Administration, Psychology, Biology, and Chemistry are all degrees that can get you into a law enforcement career.  <br>  There are many subsidiary jobs in law enforcement that can get you in the door:  dispatching, evidence tech, forensics, jail staff, and etc.<br>  As you apparently know, competition is high for police jobs.  Also, the number of jobs are being limited due to budget cuts.  You will have to make yourself more attractive than the next candidate or become a known quantity to those doing the hiring.  Many agencies have volunteers.  While you might not be paid, you do become a known quantity and when it comes time to hire, you may have a head start.

Obama is a pure nut bar, not to mention one of those who have to lie constantly so you don't see who they really are. That should have cued people to him, it did me.|`|0Y6CqSliaa	I'm thinking because he is fulfilling the communist goals.|`|CbeNLpb3aa	Because he is.<br>  <br>  Google the 45 communist goals from 1963.<br>  <br>  You mean Lenin or John Lennon - course both were commies.|`|MtFlPUyvaa	I am in complete agreement with comrade Sam Webb|`|9a5jTJPFaa	It's Glen Beck's show. Hello, of course he's going to find some weird retard and have him say things to make Obama sort of look bad in Fox news eyes. The rest of the world that's reality knows this is just bad TV. This non sense is what we call typical Fox News. They have nothing else to show, what else are they going to do. They have no president in office to praise since Bush messed the country up. LOL!|`|Gn6jwmzCaa	Really? No way baby!! I did not know this...how do I go about taking back my vote for Obama? Boo hoo hoo...I am so sad. Oh Obama, to think I knew ye, yet I know thee not...where is my gun, suicide time.<br>  <br>  <br>  Jokes... :-) Love yah Bama!!!|`|aFC72tLZaa	Probably the same reason Oxyrush is the leader of the republican party.|`|AA11105711	Lennon was a great song writer, but not really a hero.|`|u93oneUXaa	The same reason all republicans don't seem to know the reason between socialism and communism.|`|1FkYHLXDaa	I'm watching it too and it is very amusing.<br>  <br>  I wonder why MSM won't interview him. lol|`|HmOdSP5Waa	Because he is. Thanks to Liberalism.|`|VuqM9YH2aa	right on target.watching it now this is insane,but true|`|S1EYd5WVaa	Obama is trying to move this country to a Socialistic one. The next step is communism.|`|AbMQGoEbaa	hahahahahahahahahaha.  that's so funny.  somebody needs to ask barack's comment on that @ the next press confrence.  liberals can't deny it now.|`|9VL72MKzaa	Go check Mr. Ranger's office for pic-i-nic baskets.  You have no clue.|`|8eeee84248737295c60d88565ceb0559aa	Funny...none of his plans have actually come to fruition.

rNXCnJ8Eaa	I'm gay and I'm enlisting in the Coast Guard later this year. As long as you don't disclose the fact that you're gay, the Army won't kick you out.<br>  <br>  When President Obama was campaigning last year, he strongly embellished how much he felt that the "Don't Ask, Don't Tell" policy was discriminative and unconstituional and that if a bill is introduced to reverse the policy that he would gladly sign it. I'm hoping for that day so that I don't have to live in fear of being discharged for my sexual orientation.<br>  <br>  In the meantime, just keep in mind that you're there to do a job, and just keep your sexuality to yourself. If confronted, it will suck to have to lie about who you are, but it would honestly suck worse to get kicked out of the military and loose your chances at a career with them.|`|n2oEhdZiaa	Some commands choose not to enforce the Don't Ask Don't Tell policy.  Most do.  It will also depend how open you are about it.  I've known several lesbians who were "room mates" but they didn't post pictures on the internet or brag about how much they love girls so they got to stay in until their time was up and they chose to get out or stay in.  How you act will probably play the largest factor.<br>  <br>  Edit: You will NOT get a Dishonorable discharge.  YOu have to be convicted of a crime to get a Dishonorable.  It would probably be a General Under Honorable Conditions unless it was during Basic/AIT then it would just be an uncharacterized discharge with a code on the discharge indicating you're homosexual so you can't get back in.|`|1ss17pyzaa	Don't ask, don't tell. Also, don't get caught because you will get kicked out and you will be discharged dishonorably and you won't be able to get a job with that on your resume|`|GRECLt2Uaa	if you come out in the open you will get kicked out. which is sad because they will accept your service and even your life, but won't allow to openly serve, that's b*llshit. that is part of who you are! good luck|`|Vd5XrEY6aa	You will get dishonorable discharge if they find out when your enlisted. <br>  <br>  USMC<br>  Woodburn|`|HKKu4CjEaa	How would they find out?  They don't discriminate like that I don't believe, anyway.|`|Y0pFoz4caa	be who u wanna be look to whats in your heart|`|McfrauFnaa	i'm in the army, and i know a few lesbians. as long as you don't go around broadcasting it, you will be fine. and usually the women get harassed because of the dramatic ratio between men and women. basically women are few and far between by comparison, so the few women there are have to expect someone to hit on them from time to time you know?|`|fslABgDnaa	As long as you don't go around telling everyone you're one you'll be fine. I had a few friends that were and they didn't run into any problems.<br>  <br>  I used to be in the Army (1998 - 2004) and I didn't have any issues with being harassed because I was a woman - only had one male chauvinist pig I worked for but I called him on it and I just worked around him until I didn't have to work for him any more.<br>  <br>  Just do what you’re trained for, be where you’re supposed to be when you’re supposed to be there and you won’t have any problems.|`|3gljWitCaa	it dont ask dont tell dont harrass<br>  if they do find out, yah youll probaly be kicked out<br>  <br>  look if you care what men are going to say... dont join...<br>  <br>  hollyy|`|k1A5DMecaa	I hope you won't kicked out. They should realize that there risking there life for gay* people too so they should let you join. <br>  <br>  * no offense|`|vrNUDNo0aa	I had that same question, don't ask, don't tell! that's what i was told! good luck!|`|Ul8ZZAZJaa	They have a don't ask don't tell policy.|`|oGbHyZR8aa	Don't ask, don't tell! But if they find out, they'll probably send you home.|`|2ncaaoFPaa	You'll be kicked out.|`|c2hfVjxgaa	Don't ask don't tell, have you heard of that policy?|`|0BoDF6iBaa	They won't kick you out as long as you don't prance around telling everyone you're a lesbian.<br>  I'm a lesbian and I was in the Navy for 6 years.<br>  They don't want you to talk about having a girlfriend/bring a girlfriend to base with you, or put it on your public myspace that you're a lesbian.<br>  When you're off duty, you're pretty safe.  I hung out in gay clubs and bars and the only people that saw me there were other gay in the military folks, so it didn't matter to them.<br>  <br>  <br>  HAHA omg some people are so dumb, that guy up there spelled "dyke" wrong.  Show off them idiotic skills, pal!|`|LGidAYDwaa	Don't ask, don't tell, don't pursue. No one will ask you if you are a lesbian. And, if they think you are, they still won't ask you.  As long as you keep your relationships on the down low, you'll be fine.  Men are men. If you're working a job that is usually held by men, and you're working around men, they're going to bother you. That's just the way they are. If they actually attack you physically, that's when you need to worry. But most guys are all talk, and they love making women feel uncomfortable. As long as you go in with the knowledge that they may mess with you a bit, and are willing to accept it, then you'll be fine.|`|40be38b32a6cdfa4e662892e1c0ed7adaa	As long as you don't out yourself you will be alright. There are many lesbians that have served honorably.<br>  <br>  ** I wouldn't call it a cover up. There are periodic scandals and other bad things. I think that the Army as an institution is dead set against rape and assault. However there is always going to be those jerks that cant learn or wont learn and bad stuff happens.|`|AA10123414	Don't ask, don't tell. They will not throw you out for being a lesbian. They will throw you out for talking about being a lesbian or having a lesbian relationship.|`|fSlZQzS4aa	Not if you keep it to yourself.
35ZJauLkaa	Won't happen till America starts drilling again|`|AA11313983	Never happen.  It's as pointless for him to say that as it was for the democrat-led congress to try to sue OPEC.  The United States of America does not write international law.|`|TFdKrkP2aa	He is correct but since we do not control international law there isn't much we can do about it.|`|nTzTIrataa	I think that thing on top of his head needs to be broke up.|`|WCkOUF9aaa	And just how does the Donald say we can control foreign countries?|`|WkLJI40baa	Did you say how or was he just running his mouth again?|`|UpZFb6X5aa	Well, I can't say I like OPEC--any more than I like loan sharks or extortionists, and for the same reasons.<br>  <br>  But we need to concentrate on building the new technologies (for example, wind, solar, and nuclear energy, fuel efficient cars--and eventually electric cars--and so on).<br>  <br>  If we make America energy-independent and fre of OPEC--they will break up all by themselves. It's the policies of the conservatives for the past 3 decades that give OPEC its power. They have blocked every attempt to make us less dependent on foreign oil. <br>  <br>  Reversing those policies that give OPEC the power to manipulate and exploit the United States is the solution. "Breaking up OPEC"--however satisfying it might be--is treating the symptom and not the underlying problem.|`|6pdwd3PZaa	i agree..he also thinks Obama's spending is going to cause a depression. Maybe he is on to something.|`|Hcg2juS7aa	Let's get rid of OPEC and start drilling in the US pronto.  That would stop our dependence on foreign oil.|`|YCL50xgnaa	I think it's meaningless.  OPEC wouldn't know who Donald Trump even is.|`|6AgnCKCPaa	I think it would be nice but it ain't happening..|`|bd071971ac36c92a5d8fe8733f388859aa	Yes, but how does he propose to do it?|`|VuqM9YH2aa	break them up!!!|`|6fc08787b5e5ac76f08efa83bbfd7f9eaa	yes, their the reason for high gas prices!!!
nYgUfUd7aa	If such a law is passed it will be challenged in court and there is no way it would be allowed since it would be an invasion of privacy and thus be found unconstitutional.|`|kCSJyM8Laa	You guys voted the liberals in all over the country so just shut up...you got what you voted for.|`|9rhmeb7raa	You don't have to fight anything. This idea was proposed by Transportation Secretary Ray LaHood and quickly shot down by President Obama. The administration is not and will not seek approval of such a proposal.|`|AA10792232	I saw that article earlier.  I don't really know why congress is still beating that horse after Obama axed it.  Maybe they're hoping he'll change his mind down the road.|`|FOf9Y9dqaa	You need to write to your state senator if you want your voice heard.|`|1b9d6f92644c7ecc734f3330365356a8aa	Just pop the dashboard fuse that powers it.  The official Orwell computer will show your car hasn't moved in days|`|cJY7V7xKaa	Yes this is crazy the high cost of commuting to work is what destroyed the economy ($4.00 a gal)<br>  How to fight this ?<br>  With some good arguments such as:<br>  <br>  1. You cannot charge buy the mile unless you can put a cap on the cost of a GAL. of gas which is impossible.<br>  <br>  2.  I just did the math and shocked myself.<br>     Cost of commuting to work for six months Insurance and fuel cost only<br>   $1616.00 divided X six is $269.00 a month that's high enough
kQgEbAbEaa	Quick Answer: Yes.<br>  <br>  Long Answer: Read the Constitution and the authors of it. They put the Second Amendment into the Constitution specifically in the event that the Republic stopped listening to the people.|`|AA10206116	First off, the government really has no idea how many guns are on the streets. Between guns getting stolen, sold second hand, and military surplus weapons, there is no telling who has what and of how much.<br>  <br>  Secondly, if the government came knocking, I highly doubt any gun owners would willingly give up their firearms. It's not that they want to break the law, it's the fact that oppressive government is the reason why gun ownership is allowed in the first place. If they tried to take them by force, there are far more of us than there are of them. 1.4 million soldiers against at least 100 million civilians. I have my money on the civilians.<br>  <br>  It would come down to a lot of bloodshed if the government tried to pull anything funny.|`|AA11518835	I would never let the Government take away my guns.<br>  <br>  The US civilians own more guns than every military and every police force on earth COMBINED (270 million guns).<br>  <br>  It is going to be very difficult to take them away.|`|qUD3Kn1Eaa	Yes, of course they could do it, but it would be pretty much impossible (for right now at least) to have all guns gone.<br>  <br>  So, there would probably be some uprising of people against this, but I think that it is really unnecessary because what do we really need guns for?<br>  With this, anyone can have a gun. You could be walking down the street, look at someone the wrong way, and they might pull a gun out on you and that would be the end of it.<br>  Other countries, like Canada, are living fine without guns, so why couldn't the USA do the same?|`|9NcOBG8Laa	If it was all at once? Yeah, absolutly.<br>  <br>  But really, if it happens, it's going to be by gradual wittling, not a mass-ban. So not necessarily.|`|JvXUTTqJaa	you've been whining about this  for 200 years. no-one will EVER take your <br>  guns away because they would never get elected under that premise.<br>  it will never happen. so relax you paranoid sissies.|`|BYeEVLDQaa	The government has no such interest............no matter what the NRA and other GOP propoganda machines try to brainwash to rednecks.|`|cyt7oh97aa	The government would never take guns away.  What they could do though is regulate it more, possibly raise the taxes on guns and ammo so that the government can get more money into its treasury to help the economy.  Just like they did with cigarettes and liquor.  They'd never take it away, but if they're going to keep it they might as well make a profit off of it.|`|o8xvzhuhaa	It could, but I doubt it. First, have no idea where the economy and guns have to do with each other, second, the government would not do such a thing at the moment.|`|QdxLCB0Raa	If the military stayed loyal they probably could forcibly take the majority of guns out of private ownership if they wanted to badly enough.<br>  <br>  It's a purely hypothetical question though.|`|s6itMDRTaa	it's a toughy <br>  some people would give them there guns <br>  other people would say no and might rebel <br>  hard to tell <br>  look what happended to the britsh and french when they tried to take things from there citizens|`|Vmp1KK1iaa	I don't think so because it would be against the constitution and the Supreme Court of the US would not allow it.|`|AvAkwdGKaa	Try to take my guns and see what heaven looks like.  Nuff said.

AA10123414	You signed a voluntary letter of resignation. You really don't have a chance to win this. Unemployment does not cover job losses due to voluntarily quiting. They have in writing that you voluntarily quit.|`|52bfba7833ff67fedabdba05216f5314aa	When you resign, you get no unemployment. That is why she threatened you with the reference thing. If a previous employer gives you a bad reference that is not true, you can sue. HR people are taught that if someone wants a reference, they just say I would or would not rehire.<br>  Rest assured she will give you no reference at all.<br>  And you will get no unemployment benefits.<br>  Your only chance is to tell the unemployment people that she threatened you with a bad reference if you did not.|`|CZGPLiU2aa	Contact the labor board in your state. There seems to be so many things wrong (and illegal) about the way things were done. From now on document everything you do related to this issue. Including your call to the labor board, who you spoke too, what time it occurred and the date, and any activity related to this issue.|`|AA11828121	As long as you have the e-mail where she is letting you go then she fired you. <br>  <br>  You can just explain the reasoning for the resignation letter but that e-mail pretty much makes her have to pay unemployment.<br>  <br>  I'm really sorry this happened to you, some people are just so uncaring about situations!|`|AA12240972	Unfortunately you sealed your own fate with the letter of resignation.  Ignorance is no excuse when it comes to your livelihood.|`|T1n3jt6Zaa	wrongful dismissal is what you should follow up on as I believe the EI is going to focus on the letter of resignation. This was written under an imposed duress in which you were falsely terminated. Start a journal and back this journal with as much physical evidence as possible. Did you get the letter of reference? This person fooled you and got out of a sticky situation with your letter and you should never allow a rush on a document. You should get legal advice from a free law source. Appeal any negative decision from EI and inform the case worker before the hearing of this intent and the reason is you feel the need for legal advice. This will buy some time so use it wisely. Benefits should continue during the appeal process and the ex job rep will be under oath in a dismissal hearing< very hard for them to lie under these conditions. Sometimes a letter on lawyer stationary will kick out a settlement.
AA11494150	You are referring to what is called primary and secondary offenses. A primary offense allows an officer to stop you for that violation. You can not stop a vehicle solely for a secondary offense, it must be observed after some other lawful stop. <br>  <br>  In North Carolina, failure to wear a seat belt in the front seat is a primary offense. Failure to wear a belt in a rear seat is a secondary offense.<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.buckleupnc.org/laws_belts_text.cfm" rel="nofollow">http://www.buckleupnc.org/laws_belts_tex...</a>|`|RvVvaVsAaa	yes the officer can stop you JUST because of the seat belt. i was riding down the street unstrapped the other day and got a 20 dollar ticket JUST for the seat belt. it IS the law. you must abide.|`|KPPScRaHaa	North Carolina law changes all the time it seems. <br>  One year, you don't have to have lights on to run your windshield wipers. The next, you do.<br>  I Think about 3 years ago, they did pass a seat belt law.<br>  They started out not really enforcing it unless you were pulled for another reason. Then you could get a seat belt violation. Now it is total law.|`|BL4PEjAWaa	It may be a primary offence in N.C.  they are trying to make it a primary offence in Ar. right now.  states that make it a primary offence get more tax money from the Feds.|`|AA10356839	It is a primary violation here in Illinois as well. In fact the State Police have set up road blocks just on that issue as well. Anything else that comes up is an add-on.|`|AzKUBp2Jaa	In most states if a officer sees not wearing your seat belt<br>  they can stop you for that infraction <br>  (I know this is the case in California)|`|C0whMHa9aa	i know what they first started enforcing the seat belt laws, they had to pull you over for another reason-not just the seat belt.  however, i think that lasted for a couple of years & then now, they can pull you over for just that. you know, like they give a couple of years to get used to it before they start actually enforcing it. i also recently saw a story on the news that a lot of counties were going to start enforcing the seat belt laws because of the economy & they're trying to raise revenue.
DnWsMhwLaa	you know prohibition (of alcohol) ended shortly after the great depression started, and it certainly didn't end the depression. it did however cut murder rates substantially, and it couldn't have hurt in fixing the depression.

Cops, DEA agents, etc.<br>  <br>  it's the same reason that the war on drugs will never end...it employs way too many people.|`|AFqZEOlRaa	The best thing about legalizing it would be the loss of income to the Mexican drug cartels.  This would put a hold on their ability to smuggle US made guns that allow them to continue to kill people on both sides of the border on a regular basis.  And legalizing all drugs would put them out of business.<br>  <br>  But as another poster mentioned, the DEA is way too entrenched to shut down, even if it is totally ineffectual.
9epL6qjBaa	Well, looking back at my career, I have yet to get a job from a poor or unemployed person.  You have been brainwashed that capitalism is bad and all profits come from greed.  Get your head out of the sand.  Or, are you waiting for a check from the Robin Obamahood as well?<br>  <br>  Edit - so, this isn't an objective question.  It's baiting to then call anyone with an answer you don't like "stupid"?  I stand by what I said - POOR PEOPLE DON'T OWN BUSINESSES.  You obviously have your hand out as well.

So if someone has the right product and they make money, they hire more people and expand.  <br>  <br>  Here is a perfect example of what I am talking about.  This guy made beer that everyone liked.  He originally sold it by the gallon, now he sells it in 6 packs.  He got a couple of stores to carry it and now he brews full time.  He quit his job, has hired a staff, and can't keep up with demand.  He is spending about $300,000 on new equipment to expand his business.  <br>  <br>  So should this guy be allowed to make more than $250,000 a year?  He took a risk and now he is getting the reward of his effort and he pays his taxes like you do.  <br>  <br>  <a href="http://news.cincinnati.com/article/20090221/BIZ01/902210345/0/ECONOMY" rel="nofollow">http://news.cincinnati.com/article/20090...</a>|`|G11cR4xhaa	How many jobs from poor people did you ever work at?<br>  Me most small businesses barely make over 250,000.In New Jersey our Demoncrat John Corzine love to make them pay more also.I've seen many a big/small bunnies move out of state-one Company that had 4 warehouses move out of the state rather than deal with the corruption.How bout all those jobs that were lost.Because of taxes.Sad you think like a small minded person.|`|SSLekPAnaa	The people that own the businesses do.

Just because somebody makes more money than another doesn't automatically imply unfairness.  Maybe they create more value.  Maybe they're really good at their job.  Or maybe there aren't as many people who can do what they do, so of course they would be in higher demand, and thus be able to request more money.|`|f702cfc86c32f9c4c16e495b7e47297aaa	ALL the while ripping you or someone else off quite likely yes.<br>  <br>  The part I find funny is how hard some people work for money.

AJmCHSwmaa	Basically California is going bankrupt, they want to legalize so they can collect tax revenue. Don't get me wrong I agree, right now they probably pay billions b/c it's illega, making it illegal they could stop spending that money plus make a ton off taxes but it seems pretty hypocritical of the government to do what's right now b/c there is money in it for themwhen they should have done this long ago.<br>  <br>  One thing, as long as it's still illegal with the Federal Government its not legal for the states to tax it. Btw, they want to tax it $50 an ounce. Seems like a bit of an unreasonable tax, people will probably grow it themselves or continue to get it on the black market. <br>  <br>  With Obama as President though, he's buddy buddy with Nancy Pelois so she may get him to do it. This would be the one positive thing that comes from Obamas presidency.|`|CwvaoyQUaa	No one can have a definite answer, but if california does LEGALIZE marijuana, which I highly doubt will happen, and their economy changes for the better and crime stays the same or even diminishes then im sure other states would take it into consideration.

You are full of lies or just intellectually dishonest.<br>  <br>  The stars and bars on the Confederate flag mean independence. When tarrifs were passed on the South and not on the north, Southern outrage started smoldering. # more tarrifs were again passed on the South in 1827,1832, and 1836 that were not passed on the north. To stop the South from gaining a majority in Accepting Missouri into the union, a sliver was cut from Maine to create Rhode Island, this move really pissed off the South. <br>  <br>  A little fact for you, No confederate flag ever flew above a slave ship, No confederate ship ever went to Africa to get slaves and no confederate captain ever piloted a slave ship, all of which did happen under the American flag under northern control! <br>  <br>  Where did the South get the slaves?

The Confederate States of America became a nation due to States Rights, not slavery. Slavery was actually on the way out. Most of the plantation owners had already figured out that their slaves were quite intelligent and were a more valuable asset if they, the slaves, had more freedom - more freedom meant more production. Many slaves already had their own homes and educational opportunities.<br>  <br>  "Why do Republicans think the Confederate Flag is something good?" This Conservative KNOWS that the Confederate flag is a representation of a nation. The nation that half of my family came from. That nation was defeated and reabsorbed by the USA. The Confederate States of America as a nation is an historical fact.|`|AA11323988	The flag does not just represent the bad times in the old south but also the good. The fact is that it is a part of our national history and as such it should not be forgotten. It does not represent slavery as such but rather a whole part of our early society. I am not against the flag or many of the people who still have some pride in being from the confederate states. I am from SC. and I think slavery was the worse crime ever committed by the US as a country but I still have some pride in the southern heritage.<br>  <br>    The Confederate states did not succeed from the union in order to keep slaves. IT was a move that was based on the principles of independence and self reliance both of which fit well with in the principles that the country was founded on. The south had the rich farmers who owned slaves and normally worked for companies out of Europe, and it had the average people who did not own slaves and struggled to survive. The flag represents both the good and bad of the south.|`|otYOxmnuaa	The Rebels flew the flag...the association is to be a rebel (in the meaning of the definition not tied to the civil war)...not adopt the characteristics and ideals the flag used to represent.<br>  <br>  I commonly see moto-sports guys adopt the sticker/flags/etc.  I see guys at the dunes using "rebel" flags instead of traditional orange flags.<br>  <br>  It's dumb anyway you look at it but I don't think the intention for most has anything to do w/ the idea "The South Will Rise Again"|`|NTBbZ7ITaa	most of them don't...but nice display of childish behavior.

Any branch will work with you... the recruiter who puts you in will probably request that you speak favorably about your military experiences since they will be excusing you from drill on weekends when you have sports obligations.  You'll also need to figure out when you can get to Basic Training and AIT (or whatever the service's equivalent is you choose).  The Guard and Reserves offer split option so you can do basic one year and AIT the next if that suits your schedule better.  Good luck.|`|qALsBIFHaa	My recruiter had someone like that before.

E-mail me if you have any more questions and good luck. wesleylohmeyer@hotmail.com|`|SN0vg4g1aa	I just left recruiting for the Army this week. My wife just went through the ROTC Program, and was simultaneously in the Army Reserves. She thought it was great. Be aware that all branches of all services deploy, UNLESS you are in the SMP Simultaneous Membership Program. During my tour of recruiting I've met soooo many people in the National Guard (from a few different states and braches) that said their experience was less than pleasurable. Here are the reasons I've personally come across. 1.) Unit said they had no funding for education programs. Then the person started to plummet into debt. 2.) Problems with getting promotions due to lack of availability of positions in unit. 3.) Soldiers were told that they could get Tuition assistance through State and Federal funds ( this is not true). I saw many other reasons as well. I personally wouldn't recommend any Branch of service National Guard Program. The reserve Program for the Military is the same thing; 1 weekend a month, 2 weeks during the summer.To really make a decision you should talk to a recruiter about current programs and tell them to prove it. That is your right. I was a very successful Army Recruiter through telling people the truth and helping them through the process of picking their job at MEPS. I just left Recruiting so if you have some ?'s you can email me personally and I will help you out.

QgE85Qynaa	Defense, primarily. Syrians have observed that other countries that have Westernized have lost their cultural (and often political) sovereignty and value system. This results in a lop-sided culture that often deals with a high amount of conflict between traditionalists and "modernists". Syria's isolationist, often reclusive foreign policy is simply their way of ensuring that the things they value will not be replaced by Western ideals (which to them often come across as materialistic, shallow, and immoral).<br>  <br>  Perhaps and illustration would help.<br>  A few years ago, a Syrian play was produced (sorry, I can't recall the name). The cast portrayed a typical Syrian family, headed by an austere father. The father, being an officer in the Syrian army (an reference to Hafez el-Assad, the former Syrian president and war hero) ran his family like a military platoon, demanding discipline, piety, and respect of tradition. The father hears a rumor that the US is about to invade Syria and establish a Western democracy, so to preempt this invasion, the father announces to his family (representative of Syria) that they will become a democracy to keep the US from invading. The end result is the father's children become disrespectful and immoral, his daughter becomes a **** (forgive me if I offend, but that's what she was depicted as), and his wife became obsessed with looking younger. The message is simple: "We Syrians don't have the system with the most freedom or openness, but at least we are honorable, principled, and respectful".<br>  <br>  There is also the issue of Israel.<br>  Syrians consider Israel to be their greatest threat (which it is) and therefore choose a government system with a strong counter-espionage system and a large, capable army. While Syrian's have lost a lot of privacy by adopting this system, their mentality is "well it's harsh and paranoid but it keeps us alive".|`|UgOx2Gxiaa	Because they wanted too?<br>            U got me<br>  <br>  I do not have a clue

The us was producing war chemicals and aviation engine parts for Britain and France alike<br>  <br>  3.) There was americans flying for the French Air Service before the "formal" entry of us into the war<br>  <br>  4.) The us federal reserve was lending money to Britain and France<br>  <br>  5.) The Germans started a successfully sabotage campaign into us military factories to stop allied supplies from going to Europe!<br>  <br>  So the us was already involved in war trough violations of neutrality!<br>  <br>  6.) The germans announced submarine warfare with out restrictions, and had sunk allied and us ships on us coastal waters<br>  <br>  7.) Winston Churchill ploted to lure the Lusitania ship into submarine  infested waters to provoke the us entry into war!, note that the germans give warnings to americans at the ny port and pay publicity of the warning in every major us ny papers!<br>  <br>  8.) The Lusitania cargo was gunpowder and aviation engines and american naive citizens<br>  <br>  9.) The Germans contacted Pancho Villa and offered substantial help to declare war on America, Room 40 , the secret british code decipher room planted a telegram trough a spy so the americans  "made the discovery by themselves!" <br>  <br>  10.) So by the time the americans " discovered the message" there was public outrage!<br>  <br>  11.) The us entry into the war meant the supply of much needed material and financial aid, Russia was put out of the war so a new ally was in need and high demand<br>  <br>  12.)

AA10123414	A private business has the right to refuse service to anyone at anytime for almost any reason. The only reasons restricted by law are discrimination against protected classes. People aged 21 - 24 from another state are not a protected class.|`|NzGZbCRQaa	I live in Rhode Island, the smallest state. I walk out my door and I'm practically in another state. In fact, I cross the state line almost daily out of necessity. One time a group of friends and I went to a small hole-in-the-wall bar in Massachusetts in which we were all at least 25 years of age. The bartender refused to serve us because we had out of state id's. Now this is probably more common than not since we live in such a small state. I'm sure the bartender realized this and has encountered the same situation many times. His refusal was absurd but I really think he wouldn't serve us due to our appearance (we were on our way to a Metallica concert). We simply went to another bar across the street and were served without question. It was well within the first bartender's right to refuse service, but It was stupid since we spent lots of money at the second bar. I wonder if the first bar is now closed down due to lack of customers, most of which he probably turned away.|`|dJDBCbeoaa	right every 4 years u get a new one butt you are still not allowed to drink or buy and tobacco PRODUCTS either. under age is under no matter how u look at it. just that simple  the law is the law and everyone should really pay attention to it under age drinking are the most caused to car related deaths and accidents plus all id states under age and so do some states with there dl. just because u can drive that does not mean u can drink|`|tisqCuf6aa	They have to follow state laws that their business is in!

There are some good fakers out there and I have been presented with poslish ID's not even a word of english on them and have been yelled at for not taking them. So get a passport as that is a valid ID bring the state issued ID with you as well so the bartender can match them up. Or better yet go to the DMV and get a state ID. not a liscence just the ID. They are just doing there jobs.

BJERgbM5aa	I've been through this.  He's asking the court to cancel the judgment.  And he's giving various reasons why.  I'm guessing that you obtained the judgment because the def. was a 'no-show'.  Doesn't matter though.  His reasons are flimsy and I don't think he'll be successful.  He knows that. He's just doing his thing to delay payment to you.  After the motion is denied, you put in an application to amend the judgment to be 'immediate payment'.  Why?  Show all your paperwork concerning your attempt to collect.  And cite his feeble attempt with the vacate application is only a delaying action.  Good Luck.|`|tkpBDLwYaa	Sounds like you're getting the runaround and are so confused, you have the rest of us confused.  Have you received the money or not?  The defendant has or has not filed a motion to vacate?  You say the sheriff took the money out of his bank account.  Has it ever been delivered to you?  If the defendant has not filed a motion to vacate, how can he state anything in his motion?  <br>  <br>  My advice:  Calm down and type in your actual question.
AA10850613	You will be arrested for 12951(b) VC per the provisions of 40302(a) VC, 148(a)(1) PC and/or 148.9(a) PC. You car will be towed and stored. When they search you incident to arrest, they'll find your license and identify you anyway. You'll be taken to jail and booked. You'll have to make bail ($). You'll then have to go to the police station and pay a release fee for you car (more $). You'll then have to take your release to the tow company and pay their fees (even more $). You'll then have to hire a lawyer ($$$) for court. If you lose, you pay more $$$. If win you case (not likely) you'll still be out a lot of money.<br>  <br>  Bottom line: ID yourself. sign the ticket, and fight it in traffic court.|`|AA11622716	Ordinarily, you do not have to show ID, although you must identify yourself.  If, however, you are driving a car on a public road, you must have your driver's license with you.  If you decline to show it. expect to be arrested and charged with driving without a valid license.  You should be acquitted at trial but will be arrested at the scene.  I also seem to recall that CA has a specific law requiring production of the license.   If you are just walking down the street, not driving, you can expect to be detained until the cop can find out who you are.  The Supreme Court has upheld a conviction for obstructing an officer for refusing to identify yourself.  The court was careful to distinguish the obligation to identify yourself upon the lawful demand of a cop from the obligation to produce some form of identification.|`|BRyRtQSvaa	Detained until your ID can be established!|`|MdrCL60caa	You will be arrested and your car will be towed at your expense. (and not released until you pay.) They will hold you until proper ID for you can be found. I'm not sure what its called but you can also get a fine for failing to identify yourself while you were in operation of a vehicle. Basically by operating a motor vehicle you are saying you will identify yourself when asked. If you're a passenger you do not have to; but as the driver it is illegal for you not to.|`|c9adce326b761303adb12127ff5dabd0aa	You will be arrested and your car impounded.You will have to pay for the tow and the daily impound rate. <br>  Part of the agreement when you get your license is that you will produce it to law enforcement if you are in control of a vehicle on public roads.|`|3oNcHdgCaa	My guess is you'll get arrested for "failure to identify" and your car gets towed and held until they figure out who you are and whether you're its owner.|`|57gnLYc7aa	Charles C is Absolutely correct!|`|NDkHAuniaa	you have to show them the i.d.

Zm8sQpKLaa	Absolutely not.<br>  <br>  Tips are a taxable part of your income. No employer has the right to withhold your rightful pay.|`|5b9d75acf8c31110fcdbe2289558b613aa	No they can not do this.  That is money you already earned.  They are trying to screw you out of your tips.|`|CowgOqXTaa	No, they can't. Those tips are part of your income that you earned. <br>  <br>  You can sue them for your money - small claims court is cheap, easy, and you don't need a lawyer. (And you can add the small claims court fees and costs, and the cost of having the summons served on them, to the lawsuit.)<br>  <br>  My advice? Go to your county courts website and download the small claims court form. Fill it in completely, write a check for the fees, and staple it to the claim form. Then go to the restaurant, see the manager and show him the form. Tell him either you leave with your tips, or you go and drop the already completed form in to the courthouse. <br>  <br>  People ignore being told "I'll sue you!" because they know that 90% of people won't follow through. Showing them that the forms are all filled in and ready to go lets them know that you WILL follow through.<br>  <br>  Richard

No self respecting court would deny a father visitation without reason.<br>  <br>  He needs to focus on getting a job, financing an attorney, and going back to court. <br>  <br>  What state did this happen in?

He can try to get help from Legal Aid but they are so understaffed and underfunded that it's not likely they could help him.  Plus, if he's now working, he may not be eligble.<br>  <br>  He will need to save up so he has the money to hire a lawyer to go into court and get him visitation rights.|`|BRyRtQSvaa	First things first....a Job...a court is not going to give him custody with no job, then a place to live, then hire an attorney and at the very least get joint custoday.|`|ASXeYOjAaa	No, he's boned.<br>  Family Court's like that. If his ex actually gets arrested for crack-whoring they still won't take the kids from her. (CYS would but Family Court won't.)<br>  She can go to Court and testify under oath that the whole divorce is her fault, that she filed for custody just to bother him and that she doesn't even really want to be bothered with the kids. She'll still win custody. She can physically assault the kids IN Court and still win custody. (again, CYS would have something to say, I'm just talking about the Family Court ruling here)<br>  Seriously, he's boned. The end.

PS6Pjtndaa	He is a politician.  Unlike many conservatives and Republicans, I do not view politicians on OUR SIDE as good and those on the left as evil.  I watch my wallet with ALL politicians!  I tell my kids that the way you can tell if a politician is lying to you is to listen to whether he's talking or not.  <br>  <br>  With that said, I don't want to minimize my feelings toward Obama.  Yes, I distrust all politicians.  But some I like are "questionable," others "dirty," and still others downright evil.  I'm still forming my opinions on Obama.  Here are things that I believe with all of my heart:<br>  <br>  1. He's stupid!  As Michael Savage says: "Obama has never been told 'no' a day in his life.  He's never been challenged on anything."  This is no different than the immature coddled athlete!  Obama is stupid because all he has is a head full of radical, left-leaning, academic theory.<br>  <br>  2. He IS a frightening radical!  He studied under Saul Alinsky and Saul himself admired satan as the first radical.  MY GOD!  I would walk out on ANY speaker who was trying to teach me his beliefs and in doing so compared his cause to the radical rabble rousing of Satan.  Obama stayed!  Obama was an Alinsky lap dog!  Obama TAUGHT Alinsky's teachings!  Phew!<br>  <br>  3. We all know about William Ayers, et al.  He lied about the depth of his relationship with Ayers!  The Resko, Ayers, Obama trinity defies credible logic other than some shady dealings.<br>  <br>  4. Chicago politics is the dirtiest politics in the nation and Obama rose up through that system!  It's the difference between learning Islam from your mom and dad or in a terrorist training camp.<br>  <br>  5. Black Liberation Theology is a MILITANT "religion."  As a Christian, I was appalled to hear a supposed man of God using the f-word and saying G d this and G d that.  This "religion" isn't about God, it's about self.  It's about obsession over skin color.  It's about blaming the white man for the black man's woes.  It's radical!<br>  <br>  6. Obama is said to be a great orator, but he's a bumbling fool when he ad libs.  The man cannot speak off the cuff!  <br>  <br>  7. The most offensive thing that ANY president has ever said was what Obama said about when life begins.  He said that "it's beyond his pay grade."  God help us, you evil little man who will SAY ANYTHING to get elected!<br>  <br>  8. I personally know of at least 8 or 10 lies that Obama has told.  He's a liar!  Some say that all politicians are liars.  Maybe so.  But I have NO RESPECT for Obama.<br>  <br>  9. I am convinced that the man is not a naturalized American citizen.  I am convinced that he knowingly took office against the rules of the Constitution.  I am sooooooooooooo angry with the FBI and CIA for allowing this!  I am soooooooooooo angry with the press for never confirming his birth place.<br>  <br>  10. Obama has exploited our economic downturn for his own political agenda.  90 percent of that so-called "economic stimulus bill" has NOTHING TO DO with stimulating the economy.  It was his excuse to rifle through questionable, even immoral legislation.  <br>  <br>  He is an agent of change, all right.  He is the most radical President we've ever had.  God help us all.|`|AA10792232	"Just words" to quote Obama.|`|nYjVW8Fbaa	he's a good speaker, but the fact is he's full of s@@t.  money for college students, he just cut funding to non government agencies who provide student loans.  he's going to get us out of a war, yet he is planning on boosting the amount of people in the military.  corporate CEO's can't fly in their commerical jets, yet he continues to fly all around the country like he is still campaigning.  how much does that cost?<br>  <br>  the budget if the responsibility of the congress and not his.|`|AA11478263	all a bunch af lies|`|98EXXItdaa	I've seen nothing to suggest Obama has ever had the good of the country in mind.  He was willing to sell out the people of Illinois to Tony Rezko, what makes you think he's changed his ways?<br>  <br>  With that in mind, and given that everything he's done or wants to do will harm this country, why would any decent American want to help this man?  Because in helping him you hurt the nation.<br>  <br>  His speech was what his speeches have always been.  Empty rhetoric and lies.  But, if I need to do something to help him.. here it is.  Barry, get yourself some new people to fact check your speeches!

Things weren't worse then, thanks.|`|PG2gd1tOaa	I don't worry about what he said he would do, it's what he said he wouldn't do that worries me. He will eventually start taxing middle income workers simply because he won't be able to get the billions and billions he wants from the rich alone, Bill Clinton did it and so will Obama.|`|1b9d6f92644c7ecc734f3330365356a8aa	No more surprised and whining than the Democrats will be when they see a sudden evaporation of Americans earning reportable incomes of over $250K.

Don't concern yourself with attacks, they are just that.  Understand what the absolute worst of the stereotypes they would expect you to be and try your best to show that you are more human than that.  People are very good with relate ability.  I found this out in the weirdest of places recently.  I was perusing storm front.org (don't ask why), and I realized the complete absence of racial tension.  People make jokes that are wait for it...actually funny.  They debate in a rational way, and I feel like even though people that go there to spy on them and expect the absolute worst are often pleasantly surprised by what they find there.|`|nmmX87IBaa	Oh  no, no.....you fell for the trick.   Read it closer.  Raising taxes on individuals who make $250,000 a year was the campaign promise.

In essence, he's cut the threshold in half without it even looking like he has.|`|VgOCLskYaa	I know to an Obama supporter $250,000 sounds like a lot of money and that is why they are an Obama supporter. To investors, successful people that is a small amount and most small businesses that is a really small business.

Obama if he were in the sales field would be highly successful.  He could make a killing.

Even though they don't care for his politics.|`|SSLekPAnaa	I'm glad our Congresspeople are calling out Obama for what he is. There are even motions to investigate the election and if Obama is a US citizen.|`|Ca8i226Xaa	You don't understand the meaning of the term neocon, so don't use it. And since Senator DeMint is not a member here, he cannot be a troll. Senator DeMint is a true conservative one of the few in the Senate; he is not a neocon.<br>  <br>  And you are foolish for not realizing that Obama is a Socialist; he hung out with radical left wingers all his life. His budget and so-called "Stimulus Bill" are sneaky attempts to make this country more Socialist by increasing spending on those who don't pay taxes and raising taxes on those who do pay the majority of tax revenue.<br>  <br>  When you add in the control that our govt now has on the banking and financial industry, you can only conclude that we are heading towards Socialism and warp speed.<br>  <br>  What We Know About Obama.

I'm in that situation that my mother will never realize that she ain't going to leave me and him along. So what we do is this don't do the same thing that I'm going now.

5axNEp8jaa	Americans have too get this fixation with anything that is in the general interest (In this case Universal health-care) as Socialism.<br>  Its not Socialism! American are losing out because of it. The word is banded about by big Business,Libertarians, Conservatives, Insurance providers and the people who have a fixation about Government interference in their lives. Its just simply not true. A universal health-care system that works is a wonderful thing and the duty of any government to introduce and is a reflection of a caring Civilised society, I really cant see why an Insurance company can make a medical decision on your behalf if you can afford it if you are in need of health-care or an operation? that's a private company interfering in your right to have the best health care. That is exactly what Americans fear as Socialism and intrusion into ones life, but they allow their Insurance company to do it because its NOT the Government. That's just ridiculous. the word is Utilitarianism not Socialism there is a difference.|`|xkXCFpCMaa	I definitetly agree with you.

I was  taken to hospital by ambulance and was unconscious for around an hour. I was taken to emergency and had an MRI scan to see if I had a brain injury. I regained consciousness and noticed blood in my urine. I was given another MRI scan. The next day I was transported to another hospital where I saw a specialist who reviewed my case. In short, I received all this care in very short order and the whole adventure cost me about $125.00 for the ambulance ride which, I would like to point out, I wouldn't have had to pay for if I was on welfare. I'm fine and very lucky, by the way. All of this took place in Canada which has a medicare system for all its citizens. P.S. Always wear a helmet when riding a bike.

In others the employee gets a late payment penalty.<br>  <br>  In my state the employee is entitled to substantial penalties if his paycheck is late, or bounces.<br>  <br>  EDIT.... Sorry, but you are out of luck. FL has the most employer-friendly labor law in America. <br>  <br>  If you don't get paid, you can sue your employer for your unpaid wages. Your action though is limited to the actual unpaid wages, the court filing fees, and "reasonable lawyers fees" *IF* the amount is too large for small claims court. There are NO penalties to the employer for late pay. <br>  <br>  Also, paychecks in FL are exempt from some of the FL protections for bounced checks that apply to other types of check. Specifically, if your paycheck bounces, you can recover ONLY the amount of the check plus whatever fee your bank charges you - you cannot recover consequential damages such as fees you are charged for bouncing checks because your paycheck bounced.<br>  <br>  Richard|`|11a867519828ee7f2df6eda7cb34fb8faa	Unfortunately, you are in a jam.  I have bounced employer checks.  I worked for a facility whose parent company was in Florida, and I lived in Delaware.  They claimed they were late transferring funds.  I think they were just making money off our money in various investments, and they took their time paying us.  If the company is out of money, they are out of money.  There is no law protecting you.
YTJ5Upneaa	Many will never truly move on, if Obama's plan does not work, they will blame it on the Bush administration. We are already seeing this. Obama wanted the job, but does not want to take responsibility when it gets worse. Look at the stock market, it is dropping like a rock, they cannot blame that on Bush but they will. It is dropping because it does not have confidence in Obama's policies. I wish we could go back to the time of accountability, instead it is just the blame game. I hope this plan of Obama's does work, but I just do not see how it can work, it goes against basic economics.|`|9epL6qjBaa	Yeah people bashed Carter because when he started his administration, unemployment was 4.5%.

Other lawmakers added it to the list of earmarks in the bill. That's why even Repubs agreed to remove Obama's name from the list of co-sponsors- funding this thing was his idea, but making it part of the Omnibus was not. <br>  <br>  +1 Obama<br>  <br>  BUT the bill did have earmarks- that one and many others. And as a president who told us the bill would be free of these things, He should have vetoed it.

Plus, the "local" police agency was contacted, and they would always send a couple of marked units.  By the time the arrest was made, there'd be a dozen officers.  Yes, I agree there is safety in numbers and all that, but at some point it simply gets ridiculous.

fAaLjlI0aa	Once again, dear child, blacks are NOT the only ones who've ever been abused by the police, so please STOP trying to play the race card. As I said, it's been so over-used and abused that it's plain worn out. Rodney King was someone who resisted arrest and the cops went too far. That's on them. It has absolutely NOTHING to do with your husband. Your husband is not Rodney King, and the cops who arrested him were not the ones who arrested Rodney. Just because your husband is black does NOT mean that race had to be a factor. Running from the cops, let me assure you, is enough in and of itself, to make them get physical with you. HE RAN. He caused an assumption of guilt by RUNNING not by being black. You need to get a grip on yourself and stop disgracing your race by trying to use to it this way.|`|DZzBfzVeaa	Rodney King was a criminal and a drug user and he did have a record. That didnt give the police the right to beat him but he was a criminal he DID do something wrong. Why dont we hear about the white cops beating the white people? or the black cops beating the white people? Because that happens to. Its not just white cops beating black people up for no reason at all. im not saying it doesnt happen but cops are more respectfull then that. BTW when are you gunna give it up?|`|5d9pCmjyaa	He did resist arrest.  But they went way too far in "subduing" him.  Same thing with Malice Green.<br>  <br>  Who names their child "malice" anyway?  His parents should have been taken behind the woodshed for naming him "malice" in the first place.|`|a9dd122f6e9e49753e088e4b5d0b3c65aa	The Rodney King incident is a good example of the police getting prosecuted by the media before any legal proceedings.  You saw a couple of minutes of video and made your judgment.  The jury saw the entire tape (you know, the part the media edited for good air play), the interviews with witnesses and all of the testimony and guess what?  The three of the officers were acquitted and the jury was undecided on the fourth.  Hmmm.  Sounds like there was more to the incident than the media let on.  <br>  <br>  More to the point of your rant.  I am white.  I have never beat anyone.  I have arrested people of many different cultures, religions and ethnicities.  Some of them have resisted.  I still did my job, without the use of excessive force.  <br>  <br>  In nearly 17 years I have yet to loose a fight at my job.  I can't afford to.  If I allow the bad guy to win, he gets my hand gun, shotgun, .308 rifle, taser, baton, police radio and about 1000 rounds of ammunition.  <br>  <br>  I wonder what your rant would be if I allowed that to happen and the bad guy shot one of your relatives with one of my duty weapons?|`|kiOD8s8Kaa	You're right.  Anyone who's a criminal with a criminal record deserves to be beaten by the police, even if that person isn't actually committing a crime at the time.<br>  <br>  Maybe if more people got beaten repeatedly for past crimes, they'd think twice about committing their first crime.  The kid a few posts back who bragged about going to juvenile detention probably could have used a little... attitude adjustment.  Yeah, that's it.|`|u6ALw1gAaa	The reason Rodney King was "beaten" depends on who you ask.......

Because your husband is a criminal and was taken into custody when he resisted arrest and had drugs on him, you just can't fathom how people could be on the side of the police on this one. Now are there cops somewhere that have beaten up suspects who didn't deserve it? Yes. Did it happen to your husband. No? He's a criminal who ran when he saw the cops, resisted arrest and had drugs on him. He deserves everything coming to him, as do you. <br>  <br>  Why are you so angry?<br>  <br>  Say bye-bye to your account.<br>  <br>  Hope this helps.|`|a8e1KcS2aa	Only a trained professional, licensed psychiatrist, or a good whuppin could help you on this one.  HE WAS NOT BEATEN BECAUSE HE WAS BLACK.  He was taken into custody, and while doing so, he resisted arrest.  The police used the force necessary to safely affect the arrest, as that's what we're trained to do.  Officer safety always comes first, and if someone's fighting with an officer, the officer is ALWAYS going to fight harder.  There are many tools on an officer's belt, and a gun is one of them.  If the officer were to be overpowered, then that tool could possibly be taken from him.  If that happens, many more people would be put in danger and the officer probably would not make it home from his shift. That's what goes through an officer's mind in a fight/hands-on situation.  They have to protect themselves to protect others, and when situations like that happen, they are spur-of-the-moment.  Hindsight is 20/20, and while it may look like an over-reaction now, it definitely feels like a necessary course of action during the incident.  You should put yourself in the officers' shoes instead of the criminal.  You'd have a lot more insight and not sound nearly as ignorant as you do.|`|XLSfTnISaa	Maybe he BROKE THE LAW again. I hate when people place the race card.|`|IH6NrVNBaa	Because he was a turd, that ran from the police...just like your husband.|`|2rcSILkWaa	We just can't, all, get along.
tdIuoIc1aa	As in your other question, depending on the state, the judge can determine the person represents a future danger to others or that the seriousness of the crime warrants the death penalty.|`|RkfIPD7Iaa	It's a philosophical choice made by the people in the form of their government whether they support the death penalty.  Most people who support it do so out of a sense of revenge, killing the person who killed, 'an eye for an eye'.<br>  <br>  Those who oppose it do so because of a belief that the state should not stoop to the level of the criminal, by sanctioning killing.<br>  <br>  Personally, I'm of mixed minds.  On the one hand, some crimes are so heinous that the criminal should probably be put down like a rabid dog.  But on the other hand, I can understand the sanctity of human life argument.  I am also aware that there have been several high profile murder cases in recent years where new evidence has overturned convictions, which suggests it is certainly POSSIBLE that there have been death penalties imposed on innocent men.<br>  <br>  My personal opinion would just see those who now qualify for death be sent to some remote location with no possibility of escape, and that they remain there, working for their keep, for the rest of their lives.  Death while still living, in other words.|`|cn0ALwwLaa	amus75 has the best answer so far. I wonder if I can one-up him to get the Best Answer! :)<br>  <br>  Yes, our American justice system permits certain heinous crimes, most commonly the taking of a life by the person found Guilty, to be punished by the Death Penalty. This is 'warranted' because a Jury is to be have found Guilty the person of the offense (more on this later, Juries are frequently duped by the State, or have issues and biases themselves. There is no justice, really. Only smart people that play the system and are players, dumb people that get steamrolled, and dumb people that used to get steamrolled that one day decide to refuse to BE Steamrolled, flip the steamroller over when it comes for them, and then are smart people that play the system and are players.) <br>  <br>  Our laws are based heavily on the laws of the Old Testament in the Bible. (It should be noted that the religion of Judaism is the Old Testament of the Bible, they reject the New Testament and anything to do with Jesus. They refuse to acknowledge Jesus as the messiah based on an obscure one verse of a book in the Old Testament,and claim it debunks the whole thing. It does not, Jesus was phrophecied about by name in Old, and Jews are being stupid there. I have met a few that were evil, no offense or defamation to Judaism, its all theology and doctrinal differences, plus personal motivation for control.) ----- Sorry folks, here are some examples:<br>  <br>  1) Bankruptcy discharged in 7 years is traight from the Book of Deuteronomy.<br>  2) Marrianeg between a Man and a Woman and no Gay or Lesbian marriage that is equal to Actual Marriane is also from the word of God, as he did not intend us to be like that.<br>  And 3) AN EYE FOR AN EYE is the New Testament.<br>  <br>  The Bible contradicts itself. It says one thing, and then another. Frequently, God spoke to the people for situations that were specific to one thing. (Jesus name was NOT specific to one person in Old Testament, certain Jews twist that up for the uninformed of what the New Testament is, and how it -supercedes- the law of the Old, there is a New Covenant now.) For the Bible to say 'An Eye for an Eye,' God was talking about war with someone that had wronged them, and they had to take the land back. <br>  <br>  The New Testament talks about forgiveness. For us to say the Death Penalty is derived from the Bible, we must question if it is taken from the right part. Also, since Church and State are supposed to be separate, that is impossible, since all the people that work in the Justice System have some, a lot of, or no Church in them, and are thus linked.<br>  <br>  If someone murders another, or rapes a 7-year-old or 3-year-old, or is Ted Bundy and cooks human skin as stew, they may be convicted and sentenced to die. However, in more and more cases, people that have been in Prison for 12 years, 15 years, 20 years are proven innocent, and the guy that had his life wasted in the hell that is Prison (not County, -Prison,- way different) only says 'I told you that 12, 15, 20 years ago.' There is no way to take back time, but the lawyer frequently can be of no help, and the jury wants to go home so they convict more than aquit.<br>  <br>  Death Penalty is also a cost-saving measure, although it might as well not be,. The amount of time an inmante spends on Death Row waiting to be proved innocent, they might as well have their sebtence changed to Life, as we pay to keep them alve until it happens anyway.<br>  <br>  Upon deeper insight, you must see... There is no justice, and some people only get the badge because they like killing people, beating people up, making people suffer and starve as they even control food until the minute it is given, and are sadists with weapons and mace.|`|hsOW5o12aa	Because the system like to play God and decides if your worth living on earth or not.|`|hLcs75ynaa	"Life" doesn't mean you stay in jail forever|`|2fw6CbCUaa	Because some people deserve to die.
fKFvzlzQaa	I would go with what the attorneys say.
2zym4J9xaa	Only if you think IED's are risky.  <br>  <br>  I know 88m (Motor Transport Specialist) in the Army are magnets for IED and are probably the most dangerous MOS in that respect.|`|pwdv08hVaa	Motor T lol|`|wigtXCBTaa	Only if you go to a war zone|`|C7wjR42Daa	Any job in the USMC is risky. Marines die year round including during peace time from accidents. <br>  <br>  More Marines die today at their home bases then in combat zones. Think about that.<br>  <br>  Driving by itself is a dangerous thing to do. Of course it's a risky job.|`|BRyRtQSvaa	It can be on convoys!|`|MfZU1UpFaa	haha what a pogue you are...ima 0331....Semper Fi :)
AA11376640	If you are over 18 you do not need permission to purchase a gun of any kind, and the 2nd amendment does not say anything about a permit to bear arms! I have been carrying a gun for 30 years and I would never ask for permission to do it, and if people don't like me exercising my right that is too bad! You might not be able to go in a gun shop and buy one, but a private sale is private!|`|owzmt7lDaa	You cannot legally purchase a handgun from a FFL dealer as you are under 21 and they are prohibited from selling it to you.<br>  <br>  However if you are over 18 then you can legally purchase a handgun from a secondary dealer, a 'face to face sale' from a non-FFL dealer would be legal. IF you went to a gun show or maybe an advertisement in the classifieds or any other type of purchase from a non-FFL holder then it would be legal.<br>  <br>  If you do not have carry permit, you may not  carry a loaded handgun regardless.|`|7o3DMzXQaa	yes you can if you were in the military.. if you weren't then just keep it at home
PZN9ifR3aa	If your the non custodial parent files taxes while they are behind in child support then the state usually will take out how much they owe the other parent from their state tax returns before they even receive them and send it to the custodial parent. at least that is the way it works in most states.!|`|htSZsds7aa	You betcha...that money is owed to the custodial parent..the state will notify IRS and your money will be defered to the person u owe.|`|FaB2v37Aaa	The custodial parent will get whatever tax refund you have due to you.|`|K786S8Ajaa	yes the d a will have a wage garnish out. when they file there taxes it'll be sent to the d a they will take out what is owed and send it to you ( in california they do this with both state and federal) it takes a few weeks or so for you to see this
Yb8IYQJPaa	It empowers every American. It gives the people the ability to protect themselves and their family.   And more importantly, what our forefathers intended, the ability to over throw a corrupt government, maybe even a socialist power hungry government......|`|bGlZ8I2iaa	The correct document reads, "A well regulated militia, being necessary to the security of a free State, the right of the people to keep and bear Arms shall not be infringed."<br>  <br>  The language is very clear in several amendments of the first ten or The Bill of Rights. <br>  The First Amendment states, “...the right of the people to peacefully<br>  assemble...” <br>  The Fourth Amendment states, “The right of the people to be<br>  secure in their persons...” <br>  The Ninth and Tenth Amendments have similar language with “...rights retained by the people...” and “...powers reserved to the people...” <br>  <br>  So how is it that when the Second Amendment says, “...the right of the people to keep and bear Arms shall not be infringed,” it means anything other than just what it says?<br>  <br>  And by the way, the Supreme Court upheld that definition last summer.<br>  <br>  The first ten amendments comprise the Bill of Rights. Those ten basic rights are inseparable.|`|PCVJg5ieaa	That states can form well-regulated militias that have the right to bear arms.  That is what the amendment says.  It does not give the right to individuals to bear arms.  You also need to put the commas in there, they are important.|`|PaLJ4pU8aa	It means the framers realized that it was going to be necessary at some point in the future for the people to rise up against a tyrant.  When that time came, the framers thought it would be a good idea for the people to be armed with more than pitchforks.|`|oBviF550aa	It goes to show that the population still has the ability to overthrow our Government when/if necessary.|`|OklApvU6aa	it means the Communists in charge will have it removed soon|`|YBqhBXbfaa	It means that in the case of the permament military (army navy marines, etc) should try and take control and take our freedoms, citizens have the right to bear arms so that they could rise up against military control. Something like that, I hope I conveyed my thoughts right.<br>  just in case let me try again<br>  we have the right to bear arms so that we can fight the government for our freedom. In the case they should try and take it from us<br>  <br>  C.S. it is not the states right to form militias that is not what it is saying. It is saying that militias are necessary to protect the security of the free state (our country).<br>  <br>  I also want to add that i read somewheres that the founding fathers never intended us to have a permament military for good reasons i can't remember (i think one of them was because of the drain it would have on our economy) whether it is true or not i don't know.  So this could also be a reference for a militia being necessary to protect our freedom from outside invaders. sort of like how the militia played an important role in winning our freedom from the british|`|PS6Pjtndaa	It sort of reverses two important ideas.  <br>  <br>  1. We have the right to keep and bear arms.  That right shall not be infringed upon.<br>  <br>  2. The JUSTIFICATION or SUPPORT of this right is that a well regulated militia (sort of like a people's army) is necessary.<br>  <br>  Many have tried to argue that we no longer need a militia therefore.  Well, you know where that's going!  We no longer have a right to bear arms.  I say this to you: <br>  <br>  IF God forbid the U.S. was defeated in a war on our home soil, our ONLY hope of resistance would be well-armed private citizens.  I do not see this as an outdated concept at all!|`|98EXXItdaa	The whole gun rights agenda using it is laughable.  It sets up the means for the establishment of organized militias ( AKA military units ) and nothing else.<br>  <br>  If this amendment was correctly appied, it should mean that every bit of military hardware should be legal and available to the general population.  To have a credible military unit today, we would need to allow assault rifles, tanks, bombers, even nukes to be held in the hands of private citizens.  It's an amendment from a different era, and it didn't age well.|`|tLBjsrEFaa	it means in times of disasters you can protect your self from Looters, like what happened to New Orleans when the Police left the city and thugs started looting everything|`|cDNMB0GAaa	I plead to fifth
tdIuoIc1aa	an easement is a grant by the owner to allow the governing body to account for something, in this case water runoff. They may want to put in a storm drain or sewer system to allow for runoff. This is especially important in large paved areas which prevent water from seeping into the ground. The water has to go somewhere and if it rushes off the property in too large a quantity or speed, it can flood neighboring lots. Holding ponds are one way of preventing flooding but containing water and letting it drain slowly. in every case, the city will require some plan for handling the issue|`|gqmtPx8gaa	Basically it's the part of your property that will be owned by the city or county. Typically from the edge of the street onto your property 7-12 feet (depending on the code). They use this for utilities and for drain pipes, etc.
