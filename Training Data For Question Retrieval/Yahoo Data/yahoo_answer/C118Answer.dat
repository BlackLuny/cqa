AA11770802	People like Karnac  shouldn't answer questions they have no idea about.  NCLB is not a "liberal" law that states that children can't fail a class.  That is something called "social promotion" and although I don't believe in it, it has nothing to do with NCLB.    Public Law 107 -110, which is more commonly known as "No Child Left Behind" is a law that President Bush put into effect in 2001 that states that all states have to make standards and then test their children to make sure that they are learning those standards. The law also states that each year, more and more children have to pass the tests, until in 2014 when ALL children will be passing. Every year that schools dont raise the number of students who pass the tests in all of 48 different subgroups, the school is labeled as "failing" and will be greatly penalized.    For most people the name of the law, and the idea that all children are expected to pass the tests sounds like a wonderful idea. In reality there are good things that are part of the law, but they are either overshadowed by the bad things, or the way the the law is implemented. For example, part of the law is mandatory help for children who are not on grade level. Access to remedial tutoring is mandatory for children who are not making the grade. That is a good point. Sadly, the law doesnt allow for the funds and time to do this, so many schools are now taking time out of their day to have the teachers teach the tutoring classes, which means that now there is less time for the teachers to teach the core curriculum. Subjects like history, science, social studies and geography which aren't tested have all but disappeared from most schools.    Whats even more frustrating is that the more a school fails, the more sanctions are placed on it. You will hear some people state that failing schools get money thrown at them and it may appear as that to the outside eye, but in reality it is a curse, not a blessing. You see that money comes with ridiculously strong ties. Failing schools are forced to use scripted programs. The extra money they receive is only for these programs and for people to ensure that the program is being followed exactly. What's worse, that the programs are "normed" in middle class all white schools.  They don't take into account the special needs of low income, second language, minority students who are the ones primarily in the "failing" schools.    You might say to yourself, Well, if the school is failing, who cares about their ethnic background, it is because the teachers dont know how to teach and so giving them a script to follow will ensure that some form of decent education is getting to the children. I would agree, if that was truly the case, but you see there are many reasons why schools are failing and often it has more to do with problems outside the school than inside.    Now before you write me off as someone who is just making excuses, I need to state that I do believe that most, if not all, children can learn. The problem is that they are different, and have different needs. As a teacher I need to be able to adapt my curriculum for those needs. For example, I teach in an extremely poor area. Many of my children do not have beds. They dont even have mattresses or pajamas. So when we read a story about a child putting on his pajamas and going to bed, unless I pre-teach, (go over what a bed and pajamas are befor reading the text), my students wont understand the story. Yet the scripted program does not allow for this. Being normed in an area where all children have beds and PJ's it never accured to the writers to put in a section on beds or pjs and so if I am pre-teaching and one of the coaches comes into my classroom, I will be written up for non-compliance with the core curriculum. My school can also be penalized because of this and loose money.|`|LWzrCu5caa	It is a dumb law.   Also "mainstreaming" the mentally challenged is also a dumb low.  All it does is slow down the rest of the class.       If they insist on this whole concept,  then they need to divide up the kids in classes more according to their ability.   Put the really smart one in advanced classes,  the average into average classes and the dumb ones into classes that they can handle.|`|K5IOSGXAaa	The act is a joke, it doesn't work.

You are correct that 6-6-6 hit on the "Evening Pick 3" on 11/5/08.  That said,  there was an earlier pick-3 drawing that day, and it was 7-7-9.    2.  6-6-6 hit on three other Illinois pick-3 drawings in 2008 alone.

So by attaching pagan beliefs to a number you are indicating a lack of faith in the overarching strength of God.    Its just a number Skippy.    Associating the number 666 to the devil isn't numerology in its classic sense, but in the broader and less precise common usage it is.|`|2gx2LgzEaa	yeah its realy. Verified it ....    Scary isint it?    And actually the practice of numerology is quite different then identifying the numbers "Grandma."

PWvS7vqPaa	Unless you are a FFL/SOT (Federal Firearms License Special Occupational Taxpayer) then no, you cannot.  In short, full auto weapons such as the M4 are restricted to Military/Law Enforcement use only.  The only machine guns that are available to private citizens are what are known as transferable machine guns.  These are machine guns made AND registered prior to 19 May 1986 before the Firearm Owner's Protection Act was passed.    So, because the M4 did not exist before 19 May 1986, there are no transferable M4's in the Bureau of Alcohol Tobacco Firearms and Explosives registry.  Without a FFL/SOT license, you are restricted to buying the transferable full auto AR-15's ($9,000-25,000).  They are so expensive because there have not been any new ones made for civilian use since that date.  See the link below for one website where people often buy and sell them.    high demand + low supply = high cost    However, if you have your heart set on a full auto M4, here is what you can do.  The M16 and its civilian cousin the AR-15, and M4 are almost identical in terms of parts and function.  In fact, the only major differences aside from the fire control parts are the upper receivers.  What you can do is purchase a legal, transferable AR-15/M16 lower receiver and then purchase an M4 upper which is perfectly legal.  From there, you will be able to attach the M4 upper to the AR-15/M16 lower and for all intensive purposes, you have an M4.    Keep in mind that the process of buying a legal machine gun is expensive, time consuming, and in some cases prohibited if you live in certain states like California, New York, Hawaii, Illinois, etc.|`|YczLYtWjaa	as long as it is a semi auto,,,,,,,,full auto or 3 round burst.....no|`|iJvpuk3taa	You can not buy it from the government contractors.If you buy a selective fire M-16 you can change out the upper for a M4 set up.    In the USA you can file for legal transfer through a class 3 dealer to purchase a class 3 weapon . Swapping out the upper will not disqualify  the weapon unless the weapons barrel is less thar 18 inches.this can be made legal by permanently attaching a longer flash hider.    Go to shotgun news .com or get a copy from a amazon or borders book store.You will be able to find several class 3 dealers here    model1sales.com  MAPartsinc.com  dmps.com  These are suppliers of upper assemblies and finished semi auto weapons|`|AZNuJaZEaa	well sure you can buy one. i have one. but what do you mean "nicer" the only real difference is a 3 round burst. if by nicer you mean stuff like flashlights, lasers, holographic sights and Picatinny rails you can buy all that stuff and put it on yourself.|`|zw3rrCoYaa	If you buy it from a colt manufacturer and its in the military section it most likely is full auto. I agree though they are much nicer  in the military section. Why don't you instead buy an AR-15 chambered in 5.56 and get a free float tube installed. Also make sure to include adjustable butt-stock and M4 profile barrel. and you'll have the legal equivalent.|`|YxxUAWUzaa	Please define your question more.    Short answer: No. You can purchase a semi-auto Civilian Colt M4 which is a replica made by colt. You can also buy an AR-15 which is basically a semi-auto Civilian m-16. Both of these new are running $700 - $3000 as of right now, Sometimes more. There is no difference between Military/Law enforcement and the civilian version's other than the civilian version's being semi-auto only. Make sure to get one chambered in 5.56 x 45mm instead of .223. The difference? 5.56 x 45mm NATO has a slightly higher chamber pressure over the .223, as well as small other differences.       Long answer: Yes, as long as you comply with the National Firearms Act or NFA. In order to be compliant with the act you must be a Class III (3) Federal Firearms Licensed Dealer or FFL. This involves filling out an ATF Form 7. More info on becoming an FFL can be found on the BATF website. www.atf.gov You can also use an ATF Form 4 to have a NFA item/weapon transferred to you. Both of these involve background checks and registration of you and the weapon with the ATF. Very strict handling procedures defined by the NFA also apply. There is also a fee in both cases. The fee is substantially higher with class III (3) FFL dealer. With the From 4 transfer, the paperwork must remain with the weapon at all time's, not to mention proof of who you are.     More info on the NFA: www.en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Firea... or here   : www.atf.gov/pub/fire-explo_pub/nfa.htm  or a quick google search.    Remember, colt's military M4's are made on the same equipment that makes the civilian versions. So no difference in quality. We call this mil-spec.    Hope that answer's your question.    Jeremy

The Harry Reid abuse of power, A fool gets discharged from basic military training then claims he was killing women and children in Iraq. Rush calls him a "fake soldier". Idiot Reid tries to turn it around.     The black quarterback remark was aimed at the media's bigotry,     and the President failing... Rush disagrees with the Presidents ideas, and think they will be harmful to the nation, so with that he hopes he fails. (Unlike the hate filled left that attacked Bush continously)    It is tactics the left uses.   Rules for radicals    Rule 5: Ridicule is mans most potent weapon. Its hard to counterattack ridicule, and it infuriates the opposition, which then reacts to your advantage.    Rule 11: Pick the target, freeze it, personalize it, polarize it. Dont try to attack abstract corporations or bureaucracies. Identify a responsible individual. Ignore attempts to shift or spread the blame.|`|q4EXFhV7aa	He didn't call out Rush. He called out Republican senators who wanted to work for bi-partisan efforts. IF they want to work for all Americans in a bi-partisan fashion, it will be difficult to do so while listening to and agreeing with and supporting someone who stated several times that they want the President to fail.  Regardless, since EVERY single Republican congressmember refused to even denounce Rush's statements.....except that one guy who, after doing so, ran to Rush to grovel for forgiveness....It just shows that Republicans are making Rush their defacto leader. Since the majority of Americans and conservatives don't support the fanaticism of Rush Limbaugh, it only makes your party more divided.|`|MEReSvZeaa	It's a mistake on Obama's part.  He will lose support from Rush's audience, and his audience is pretty darn big.|`|LZY9yDIfaa	Dude, no one cares about this but a few desperate Right wingers and Limbaugh.  Obama wasn't so much "calling out" Limbaugh as suggesting that the GOP would do well to focus on working in concert to move the country forward rather than playing politics with important issues.|`|U1pMvDvgaa	Big mistake, Rush will be around when Obama is a distant unpleasant memory.|`|0f6a1cdae0a3ce3617b1109a091741bdaa	Yes, I think it will. Not that R. Limbaugh can really do anything about it. However, by the President calling him out...more or less.., he gives the impression that people are not going to be allowed to express an opinion if it goes against what he wants to do...and that is bad news. Americans all like to have their opinion and feel that somehow the people in government pay attention to what they say...regardless of party. The President made a bad call on this one. He should have just nicely said..."well, Mr. Limbaugh has the right to his opinion...even if I don't agree with it" and let it go at that. He would have come off the winner.|`|nTzTIrataa	Barack Obama would do well to completely ignore Rush Limbaugh.  I know it works for me.    Now allow me a good laugh at "Liberal AssKicker's" expense, who thinks that Obama ever had support from Rush Limbaugh's merry band of dittoheads.|`|E0dl34Y7aa	I expect Rush Limbaugh to end up like Marylin Monroe one day.

K7x1RHVFaa	Cell Phones  Although an increasing number of states are placing restrictions on cell phone usage, Missouri has no law regarding the use of cell phones while driving. Be cautious when using your phone. Distracted driving can be a significant safety hazard, especially when you're traveling in heavy traffic or under poor weather conditions. If you need to make a call, try to pull over to a safe area.|`|uO9dTTLXaa	the only states that have laws against using cell phones while driving are new york and new jersey. i know that some other states have legislation on this pending but i do not know of any that have passed it yet.    however, this really isn't a legal issue as much as it is a common sense issue. talking on the phone while driving is not the best thing to do and it's something that really should be avoided if possible. but, TEXTING?!? NO! good lord, NO! that is by far one of the stupidest possible things you could do behind the wheel. could you have typed up this question on a laptop while you were driving? no. so then why would anyone be able to safely type up a message on a phone, which would be harder than on a regular keyboard because of the 9 key setup on most phones. don't do it. when idiots who decide to text while driving get in an accident, i can only hope they only do damage and harm to themselves and not anyone else on the road.

Sad but true.|`|5b85793bae21d013c789850655fa694caa	Yes, its not gender specific.    Which theoretically means now men can make seventy cents on the dollar, just like women do now.    The case was a woman who had worked as a manager for nineteen years before finding out the male managers all made significantly more than she did.  Same job. Same title, same responsiblities, only difference was sex.
K7x1RHVFaa	No.    Men get paid more if they do homosexual films making them the stars.    It is equal pay for equal work.    If you buy a porn dvd you will find out the girls do interviews, cover shots, still shots, they must allow penetration, they may need multiple penetrators, they may do bondage, they may have to consume ejaculents and so on and that is how the amount of money they are paid is calculated, not by being in the film, but by what they are willing to do while in the film. Also, like movie stars porn stars build up a following and they are paid more if they are popular.    Back to homosexual porn, men in homosexual porn tend to make more than women in girl on girl porn so technically some men already get paid more.    Also, men get more work than women and last longer in a business that can result in the woman getting pregnant and being out of work for a while.    Plus, men are actually a problem with filming in that they seldom last as long as the filming and the females have to help them get back into the spirit of the scene so to speak so more work for the girls.    I hope this helps.|`|rUNlmQG5aa	Actually, let's be honest, they seem to do most of the "work", the female counterparts probably just enjoy it less.

True, this particular pratfall was initiated by social engineering by the Democrats and perpetuated by the Republicans. The first line bankers were smarter than the pols and hived off the investments that they made under duress. It was the bankers who bought the derivatives whose stupidity/greed is largely to blame for the fiasco. For better or worse, bankers are the custodians of the economy, and when they screw up, everything screws up.

Please note that Freedom of Speech is the very first amendment to the Constitution. I find it disheartening that there are people trying to come up with reasons to curtail it.    Fact is, I can't see any good reason for limits on free speech.    Currently there is a call to get rid of "conservative talk radio", especially those talk show hosts like Rush Limbaugh because certain people don't like what he has to say. If those who don't like him do succeed in getting him off the air, what's to stop others from doing the same to you or I if we decide to voice OUR opinions? It becomes a slippery slope and should not be allowed to occur. Change that... it CAN'T be allowed to occur.    There is a saying that I have heard since I was young that says "I may not agree with what you say, but I will defend to the death your right to say it" -Voltaire. This should still hold true. It's sad to see people on this very question that want to get rid of the first amendment.    If you don't like what you are hearing on the radio or the TV, shut it off or change the channel. It's as easy as that.    Benjamin Franklin once said  Whoever would overthrow the liberty of a nation must begin by subduing the freedom of speech.|`|2cIKIbYmaa	A. Why should I care what happens to Rush? Has he ever shown concern for what was right or decent?    B. What the hell does this have to do with Obama?    C.

Why are the right wingers so scared of the truth that they're afraid to give liberals equal time to speak?|`|5yfL6yBkaa	The so-called "Fairness" doctrine is nothing more than an attempt to silence free speech.  It is ridiculous and unconstitutional on its' face.    We need less government not more.    If people want to listen to a radio show, watch a tv station, read a magazine, read a paper, read a book, etc. then let them do it.  Why should we have government intervening in such things?  This is not why our Founding Fathers toiled so hard to form this great nation.    Citizens will decide what they want and don't want.  The people will decide what succeeds and what doesn't.  We don't need the government trying to pick favorites.    Life isn't fair and the government isn't here to make it fair.  The government is here to keep us free & safe.  That's it.      Let freedom reign.      God Bless America|`|0eFcXyZ6aa	All of the liberal shows pretty much didn't get the ratings to stay on the air. I might not agree with everything Rush or shawn hannity or any of the others have to say, but I defend their right to say it. We are in trouble people if this doctrine is enacted. No more free speech. I wonder how the democrats that are pushing this would feel if tv had to abide by it. Isn't it strange that the democrats pushing this doctrine, decline to be interviewed. **** head cowards.|`|BXYd8GvHaa	if the fairness doctrin passes  rush an all other republicans will be off the air  but i belive the liberal stations will be able to continue brodcasting    if u ask me the dems dont want anyone saying "i told u so"  when the stimulus packege fails|`|Ffgzipq5aa	Even if the fairness doctrine was reenacted it certainly wouldn't affect Rush.

You got it.|`|1c83832e4e75e687e416ee7572b46990aa	the fairness doctrine would take time way from the Conservative talk shows to allow liberal to have an opposing view point. This was tried in the 1970's and it was a big waste of time, everybody hated it. Liberals are trying to bring it back so that they can control public opinion by limiting free speech.    Just imagine that if you posted your opinion on the internet that you would also have to find someone that did not agree with you and let them have equal time to post there opinion against yours. Is it fair to you to have to do extra work to have the freedom to express your opinion?

mr8isJoZaa	As an MP, you will be one of the most heavily deployed elements in the military.  Yes, you will see action, primarily because  you will be doing convoy security, or PSD missions, making most of your missions outside the wire.  I am an MP, and have deployed to Iraq three times already.  My little sister is also an MP, and has deployed once to Iraq and once to Afghanistan.

Its a good mos though, i wouldnt change it.|`|tVoMXFDRaa	I was wondering this same thing|`|yfdHLgDraa	we lost 4 MPs to a catastrophic IED back in March I think. MPs can be assigned to a brigade, a division etc etc. sometimes they deploy as their own unit but mostly are attached to Infantry or cav what have you. And second to become CID its somethig you have to apply for and basically pass a bunch of tests etc. so if your recuiter is telling you its simple hes lying. if you are going in to do you time and hopefully make it CID go for it. But as an MP, you will deploy just like everyone else. Oh, and you will be hated by most soldiers.

We need to remember that Depressions were cyclical, they'd come every 25 or 30 years, until FDR's use of scientifically derived Keynesian economics made it possible to avoid depressions.  Because the Republicans always hated FDR they took off the controls on the economy that Keynesian economics had put on, then came the speculative bubble with banks running amok with stupid loans and now comes the collapse.  Nobody knows how bad its going to get, but we lost 100,000 jobs just last Monday alone--that is horrible, its the kind of thing that if it continued would lead to economic dissolution and maybe replacement of our present system with something like Communism.  Odd, isn't it--the Republicans bringing on Communism!|`|aVEVchFxaa	The one that's the worst. Bush tried his best to sugarcoat the way that things really are out here. Even the news reporters have said it. He had that "Ahhh it ain't so bad" type of attitude about things. Which really made him look more stupid than he already was/is. You can't just pretend that things are not bad when they are really bad. Now look at the situation that this country is in. A radio host last week was keeping count of the week's layoffs. He was in total shock at the end of the week, to realize that almost "100,000" people lost there jobs in one WEEK! Its totally ridiculous!

Obama knows this and he will sit back and watch our economy deteriorate, because this insures that he will pass all his socialist programs. If Obama let the market take care of itself and did the right thing by giving tax cuts, the market would recover. In 1982, the economy was coming out of the worst recession/depression since the great depression in the 30s, but Reagan tax cuts took effect in 1984 and as a result we had the greatest expansion and economic growth ever.    No; Obama wants to push socialism on this country, and as a result many people will be pushed further into poverty.|`|a2rjzPYZaa	He will worsen it. You can not spend your way out of it.

By the way, if EVERYONE believes in Obama's hope message then why are companies laying off workers by the THOUSANDS instad of hanging on and waiting for the Obama hope and change train?!|`|Ffgzipq5aa	LMAO!  Reverse?!  He's just digging us deeper!|`|LZY9yDIfaa	No.  The recession has been at least ten years in the making.|`|SGyRIjCIaa	Barack Obama... Can he fix it?    No he can't.    He isn't God. And do your research, Bush is not the only one who owns this recession. Look up the Community Reinvestment Act started by Carter and revised by Clinton in 1994.    Bush has his hands soiled but don't act like he created this all himself.    And you ever heard of NAFTA? That was good old Bill's idea too.    Oh and Billy also left Bin Laden off the hook. And we know that didn't turn out well. Our economy took a dive after 9/11 and that was hard to bounce back from.    Stop the blame game that Barry Obama has taught you guys to play so well. First of all, a spending bill won't do a thing to help our economy and even if he did stick to his promise of creating jobs and creating a real stimulus it won't do anything. Just like the New Deal didn't cure the Great Depression.    Wise words from FDR's Secretary of Treasury trying to get this point to the Democrats in 1939:  "We have tried spending money. We are spending more than we have ever spent before and it does not work. And I have just one interest, and now if I am wrong somebody else can have my job. I want to see this country prosper. I want to see people get a job. I want to see people get enough to eat. We have never made good on our promises. I say after eight years of this administration, we have just as much unemployment as when we started, except now we have enormous debt to boot"    Funny how that quote could be stated now and nobody would know it was from 60 years ago. I'm not saying Obama can't do it because I don't like him. I really think his ideas so far have been stupid. He's become a puppet for Pelosi and Reid and he's going against his word left and right. But let's hope something good comes together and happens. I don't want to see this get worse.
UoGFo3Dhaa	It is the Air Force's version of the National Guard which is Army.    When you join the National Guard you go to Army Basic Training.  You go to your school then you work one weekend a month and two weeks in the summer.    When you join the Air National guard you go to Air Force Basic Training.    I would just become a nurse and a join the regular Military as an Officer.|`|0szdPqI0aa	The Air National Guard is a component of the US Air Force.  The Air National guard is a reserve component.  Each state has a national guard, army and air.  The governor has the power to deploy the air national guard or army national guard of their state to a natural disaster in their state or another state if that state needs help.  But if the US government really needs more people out in the war areas, then the air national guard can be federalized, meaning the US govt can deploy them to war.  the ANG does deploy. they may deploy to a natural disaster, ( wild fires, hurricanes,etc), or if needed they could be deployed to the frontlines, like iraq, or afghanistan.    If you join the ANG, you will join an ANG unit closest to you.  you report to base one weekend a month, and two weeks a year.

Sexism was a bigger problem last year and sexism is a bigger problem this year.  Look at how the Obama campaign treated Hillary Clinton.  Barack Obama should be ashamed of himself.    I still remember some people yelling "iron my shirt!  iron my shirt!" at Hillary Clinton rallies.|`|5yfL6yBkaa	Neither.  Our big problem is out of control government.  We have government (local, state & federal) that spends too much, taxes too much, regulates too much and erodes our very freedoms every day with garbage legislation like anti-smoking bans, seatbealt laws, redistribution of wealth programs, trans-fat bans, etc.      As long as we are free people there will always be some amount of racism, sexism, age discrimination, religious discrimination, discrimination based on wealth or status in society, etc.  In a free society people have the ability to choose who to associate with and there will always be people that don't like other people for one reason or another.  This will never be erased nor is it the responsibility of government to try to.    And by the way, there are numerous known reasons for why some women in some careers make less than their male counterparts including the fact that many women don't work as many hours and take time off for families.  This is factored in to what a business has to address on their bottom line.  I guess if a woman doesn't like their job then they should get another one, just as any other person who doesn't like their job or feel they are paid appropriately.  The last few studies I've seen showed the women are very close to their counterparts now and in fact, exceed men in several fields.  It would be nice if we could all realize that not everything in life is fair and we have to deal with things as we grow up and become adults.  We shouldn't look to government at every turn to try to correct something that doesn't need correcting nor should we look to blame anyone for our own standing in life.  If you want more then go out and work hard to get it.    God Bless America
noo8vpvzaa	Nope...I am a STRONG advocate of birth control...It eliminates the need for an abortion.    Unfortunately, you can drown people in pills and condoms, but you can't make them use them...I'm an even stronger advocate of PERSONAL RESPONSIBILITY, birth control doesn't work without it.      EDIT: Re: Your additional details:    Many Catholics believe that birth control is wrong because only God should decide how many children you have.    When my first husband had a vasectomy, his Catholic father was angry with him, said it was an abomination, then just to rub it in, called him "half a man".|`|HgKlFEpBaa	This is a loaded question.  Just wait for the sucker punch.    The pill doesn't actually prevent conception.  It prevents implantation.  FWIW, I am for the pill.  Sucking a childs brain out - I stand against.|`|N0iM1mo8aa	Birth control pills/condoms should be used.  I'm Pro-LIFE not pro-Stupidity.  The use of contraception and abortion shouldn't even be in the same conversation.  If you are  going to have sex then wrap up or pop a pill.  If you don't want to take that time then don't kill the baby that didn't do anything b/c you're to dern lazy to take some precautions first.|`|AA10317675	Most pro-lifers are not against the pill.    In fact I have heard many state the reason they are against abortion is because taking the pill is such an easy way to avoid pregnancy.      But I do know a few people who are against the pill so I can explain their view.    The pill today is much 'lighter' than it used to be.  So , the theory goes, it doesn't really stop conceptions.  They believe it stops the implantation of the egg in the uterine lining.   The fertilized egg just dies without implantaion.    And these people believe it is a baby at the point of conception, therefore they believe it is murder.  Same view as they had with the IUD form of conception.    But most who are opposed to abortions are not opposed to the pill.|`|VDy99i3oaa	No, because the pill prevents eggs from becoming fertilized which means that no life is created. Abortion is killing an egg that's already become fertile and is becoming a baby, or depending on when you have the abortion, is killing a baby that has already developed a heartbeat and nervous system.|`|rth8dD4Waa	if you cant feed them, don't breed them.  The health dept, gives out FREE CONDOMS.   if a man can be convicted of  two murders  by killing pregnant woman , Why isn't all abortions murder?|`|FrfdKKGWaa	no|`|IUXriZQJaa	Birth control pills were illegal until the 1960s for a reason -- the same reason that Sanger's minions conjured up a new definition for the term 'conception,' to mean implantation rather than the joining of the sperm and the egg -- the same reason that ANYone consistently pro-life must continue to oppose them.    One part of how they work is that they USUALLY prevent ovulation, though many women report "breakthrough ovulations."    If no egg is present then the sperm cannot join it to form a zygote (a child, in this case human,  in pre-embryonic state), but if an egg is present, the thickening of the mucus will strand that unborn child in the tubes until he/she starves to death and is ejected like bodily waste.|`|AA12291184	no. i am not|`|0f6a1cdae0a3ce3617b1109a091741bdaa	No. Prevention of an unwanted pregnancy is not murder. It is avoidance. Even though some Christians interpret certain scriptures to mean that birth control is wrong...I don't agree with that interpretation.|`|TfpeYyuwaa	I think it's great, unwanted pregnancy is expensive for the taxpayers|`|cIHBpcREaa	Please share the logic behind this question!    Edit: I'm for the pill.  I don't understand the logic behind that religious view either.|`|gfB5VNXTaa	No    The BC pill helps prevent anyone from considering killing their babies.|`|i5F2jwvhaa	No I am not    I am against using abortion as a form of birth control for lazy and careless whores|`|B6c7BeDnaa	nope,it prevents it 98% of the time.|`|wM1Ayc6Raa	I am for birth control and common sense.  I'll break it down for you ,if one has sex one must protect themself.  Not just from pregnancy ,but also from stds.|`|AA11818174	No. Because the point of birth control is to keep oneself from becoming pregnant, not to kill a developing fetus after one has already conceived.

And many of them paid the $1,200 for it out of their 1st year of military service.

Juw2uckPaa	I don't know what you are trying to prove here. No child left behind for instance had yes votes in the Senate from 47 Dems, 43 Reps and one Independent.

This NCLB was proposed by Bush and voted in by both parties. Wikipedia.   As for the tax cuts, the only people getting them didn't really need them. We didn't need the Iraq war and the Patriot acts and wiretapping only took away a lot of freedoms that shouldn't have been taken away.

He was/is a liar and manipulator. He abused the power of the office of Presidency, approved torture at Gitmo and who knows where else and to put it simply, is nothing but pure evil.

Its seems that they both want to be.|`|IUXriZQJaa	As I posted, I can believe an increase of 4.7%, but the economic stimulus package has no provision 1456B.    4.7% per year would lead to an -fold increase over a 10 year period, which would leave my tax obligation at $12,000 If I make $30,000, making me taxed equally with the current highest tax bracket. I expect to be making better than double that and would cringe at what my actual taxes would be if this had any basis in truth.    It is true that the socialist and communistic tendencies of the Obama administration and democrats in general lend an almost instant credibility to crackpots such as this guy, but with no source posted, it was difficult to check up on. I think a lot of people just answered quickly to get their answers posted within the first 3 pages rather than being lost in the shuffle.    Again, I could not find anything resembling his post in the stimulus package legislation as posted on the House website.    To begin with, it would not use language similar to what he quoted.  Secondly, as stated, it does not reflect the linguistics of an attorney.  Thirdly, since no source was posted, and attorneys thrive on open-source argumentation, I doubt this was an attorney. I wouldn't expect a young child, but a teenager or college prankster could be responsible.   I'd be interested to see who wrote this and what their grade level (and GPA) is.

c07v7O80aa	It goes all the way back to Roman law. There are several reasons to have limitations. One is that it can become unfairly difficult to reconstruct a defense many years later. It also prevents evidence sufficient to charge a crime being held secretly for years until finally deciding to use it, maybe, again, when defensive evidence is lost or hard to find.     Remember that there are limitations too for civil actions, so it's not just criminal. Both civil and criminal actions are lawsuits, mechanisms for redressing wrongs. Just as the limitations on filing civil suits frees you from forever being subject a suit for an old claimed wrong, the criminal limitation does the same for criminal wrongs.     It also give the government a way to decide when to officially abandon the case. And there may be some valid argument that most of the criminal and civil wrongs are sort of recovered from after a period. So the limitations period is longer for the more serious offenses. Murder, of course, is something the victim never can recover from. And it just means charges have to be filed within the limitations period. And that period stops running when you leave the state or when a complaint is filed with the court. Once one of those things happens, the time stops running.

While no attorney can promise you anything they usually can keep the fines and possible jail time to minimum. Ask yourself one question is saving $2500.00 worth doing jail time over or is spending $2500.00 worth hopefully not going to jail?    http://www.tjconnerassociates.com
0fc4be2c7fe0b3251308b8c4479f2d3baa	i graduated basic from ft jackson...of course that was back in 1996.  if i remember correctly, there is a dinner the night prior to the graduation ceremony.  you may need to contact the base for details, if he doesn't inform you.  of course they may have lost their phone privileges for being 8-up, but usually that doesn't last more than a couple of days.  they do have their bivouac which i think is about 3 days in the field where they put all their training to use in a simulation.  so he should be able to hopefully find some time to get a hold of you.      in my situation, there was a lot to do in a very little amount of time, which included standing there waiting to get into the dayroom to use one of the very few phones.  this of course cuts into the amount of time you need to spend straightening your wall locker, shining your boots, pressing your clothes, taking a cold shower, shaving, and keeping the common area clean.      trust me, he wants to talk your head off, but it is a different world.  the military does a pretty good job of separating you from your previous life as a civilian, and training you to be part of a cohesive unit of military force and action.  don't worry.  his 'ait' will be much smoother and will have more time to get a hold of you and you him.  there he will learn to juggle the military world and the 'outside' world.|`|XoQTvtQUaa	i soooo feel for you....my boyfriend of 3 years is thinking for joining the navy....|`|VXaKIFVLaa	ok so i kinda no what you are going through my boyfriend is also in the military and is graduating this friday also but he is in fort Lenard wood Missouri but the last two week they cant call because they have pt and plus they have to clean and pack every thing they were issued like weapons and they have to turn them in soo dont worry he probably did pass because they would have called you to let you know if he didnt  so you wouldnt have to go to the graduation!! hope i helped  you|`|BuGz6eU9aa	if he's made it to the final week, he'll pass his final pt test.  don't worry.
K7x1RHVFaa	No. It is not legal, but in most cases the people who wrap the house call the parents in the house to tell them that they are going to do so. The homeowner okays it and it happens all the time without recourse. But if you do not get permission, you will face possible arrest and lawsuit.|`|70e9d9eee37ee3f1f4008f4ae6b92dc8aa	Fun...then you better find a legal way to have fun.

K7x1RHVFaa	Yes.    It is considered an open container or public intoxication violation. If you do this the pub owner can have the police remove you. Pub owners are liable for all alcohol consumed on their premises and as such will not allow you to get drunk on your own supply.    One notable exception is a BYOB club where no alcohol is served but all alcohol must leave the premises at a given hour.|`|dzuiWVZjaa	lol probably they can do what they want its their pub|`|ARAYm7BLaa	no, but the landlord has a right to say who he wants in his establishment...you'll be barred at least from that pub if not all the others in the neighbourhood.|`|ZVUrLZpXaa	It probably is not legal...but I doubt it's enforced.I mean,I assume it's hidden away in a flask anyways;-)|`|XZTf8Eahaa	Yes it is.|`|EEE6DAClaa	just as with anything else... it's only illegal if you get caught.|`|448a85191a54cc7c72fb3006ad32edebaa	no not illegal.|`|Au0HK3O6aa	If there is a sign telling you not to that may be an indication that it is against their rules and that may get you barred from the premises if you are caught. They are legally allowed to set rules and regulations for their premises.  Otherwise why have a pub at all if everyone just brings their own alcohol?  They have to make a profit to keep the pub open.   So whether it is legal or not you may find yourself outside while your mates are inside next time.|`|TYA41jRiaa	no its not but the landlord will not exactly like it lol you will probably get thrown out.|`|hCiy0CF4aa	On my....lions, tigers, and bears.

GrzC57cdaa	They are some of the rich elitests who really control the democrat party. George Soros founded this, and he is a Belgian Born Billionaire who really resents the US's place in the world. He is part of a group which is working to bring the standards of living in the US down to the levels of the rest of the world. He see's Europe as the rightful center of power in the world and he does everything he can to bring down the USA.    The democrats are the richest party, and the party with by far the richest elite membership. They are the super rich snobs who fly in on jets or leave harbors on super yaghts. They own most of the media and entertainment industry, and cast the republicans in their roll, and brainwash masses into hating those rich republicans, while they are the ones who act in ways that people identify as rich elitists, but they have diverted the heat away from themselves onto others who no one can seem to name. Get a bad democrat elitest like Madeoff, and people errantly identify them as republican, but he is a huge democrat who is all into charity evens, where deals are made, faces are shown on TV as philanthropists, but the target of the charity only gets a token, because they are only a pretext for their self serving social event.|`|407f2f3df56644b5cae9f978edcbb062aa	All of that money will create jobs or keep jobs from being scrapped.

gSdeVUOTaa	There is a problem with this. I have many questions before I can make a real decision. From what I've read this woman must suffer from some type of mental illness.

Regardless from what I do know it's all very shameful.|`|iICdZIVhaa	yes to the 400 lbs child!  Wow she is nuts!  i heard the story and to still be living at home with her mom! yeeez! Shes coo coo!

However, if people can raise 17 kids and have 8 babies at a time and there are no problems, then it's okay.|`|FUL3Ez2Iaa	You forgot to mention that she is living with her parents, on state assistance, used a fertility clinic (at our expense) to have those eight babies and now we are paying for the health care for those eight babies.  This lady is...well, there is no word to describe what she is.|`|CENIrCYYaa	I say yes to the 400lbs 7year old, in fact I think that you can have the child taken away from you by child services.    But having octupulets or raising 17 children at a time isn't child abuse unless the children are being neglected. There are other big families that have managed to make it by financially and raise health well-balanced children.    Is it greedy and somewhat irresponsible to give birth to 17 children?  I believe so. Although I know the Bible says that you should refrain from planning methods I think that there is such a thing as self control and that if you can't afford those children, don't make them suffer in poverty because you can't say no or because you want to have a mess of children around.    But some families have had 17 children in a foster family or children they've taken in because of emergency situations and that is different.    It all really depends on the quality of life the children are living. I don't rule out that a family of 17 could be happy and make ends meet financially, but the odds are definitely against them.

Construction drives the economy simply because the work cannot be outsourced overseas. Giving money to companies to use for outsourcing may help the world economy, but it will take decades to climb out of the hole the Republicans have created in this manner. Working people buy things and pay taxes as opposed to corporate entities that produce nothing and pay very little. Without government spending, no progress is ever made.

If you live in America you are enjoying one of the highest standards of living in the world. I do not think most people in America realize how poor the living conditions are elsewhere in the world.  Even Americans living below the poverty line.  They are actually enjoying a living standard as high as the middle class of some other countries.      Most people in other countries do not own automobiles, have adequate housing, electricity and fresh water 24 hours a day, medical care, vast choices of food products, the opportunity to improve their lives and the rights afforded us by our system of governance.     Few countries enjoy the human rights, women's rights and due process rights Americans have.  If you are an American you are born privileged.  Maybe not as privileged as some but way more privileged than most.     *

Even if the mother knew this, she does not know if this person will do it again.    Are you saying that if a person receives a DUI, and you are going to let them drive your car, you need to do a record check and if you find that they are convicted of a DUI, you should be held accountable if you allow this person to drive (even though this person has not been drinking)??!!

UrWBeXmLaa	Because the Loaded there body's With meth and turned into superman|`|LWzrCu5caa	The SS were the elite troops.   The rest of them were pretty much like GI JOE.   But there were some major differences that gave the advantage to the British, Russian and American troops.    First chain of command.   In the Allies army,  when a Sgt or officer was killed,  the lower ranks moved up and filled in the chain of command.   A Corporal would act as a Sgt,   a Sgt would at as the Lt,  etc.   By filling in the chain of command the fighting could continue until a replacement was sent to the unit.   This took place in all the branches of each.    With the German Army the unit stopped until it got orders from above.  This usually meant a replacement Sgt or Lt to take over.  The immediate "replacement" of the lost link in the chain did not come from below,  they waited for it to come from above.   This flaw in the system was one reason snipers were so effective against the Germans, it was a true case of cutting off the head to kill the snake.   With the Allies,  it was more like a Hydra,  cut off the head and you get more heads.       Also,  the general run of the mill German soldier had a bolt action rifle.   Pretty lame against the machine guns of the British and Americans,  not to mention the fact the American Army was the only one that went into the war with a semi-auto rifle,  the M1 Garand.       And adding to the problem of the German soldier,  their guns made smoke.  You would be amazed how many German soldiers died because of the smoke from their barrels.   Even their sniper rifles smoked.   Very fatal.|`|bHIfcilpaa	The standard German soldier was no better or worse than the average American GI.    The SS recruited the elite, and they trained in much the same way that the British Commandos or the Army Rangers trained.  Don't forget that they BELIEVED.    On a level playing field, we killed them just fine.|`|1c8ea5969ab46c77a9c66dea8a748209aa	Because no land army ever formed could have done any better in the face of such over-whelming numbers.

Also tanks were used as a spearheading force, not just a support role).  So they were able to demolish French, British, and Russian forces until the momentum wore off.    This initial success gave them a reputation of invincibility.  Furthermore, they were more experienced, well until the end when the old men fought, but for most of the war, they had gained a lot of experience during various operations.    They also were ideologically motivated by the Aryan superiority propaganda they were fed.  They though they were better, and many didn't mind dieing to revenge the Fatherland against the 'allies' who sent them into a depression.      Furthermore, they had a lot more to fear.  The Russians didn't take many prisoners(well when they did, those people generally died after in labor camps), and the German army executed 20,000 soldiers during the war.  So there was a visible demonstration of what happened if they wavered.

We need to get to the root of the issue, not just keep reacting with more money.|`|95562b01fb8ad623f733a42e57cc76bfaa	We are helping create a strong government of non-terrorists. It is the terrorists that are fighting us and the new government in Iraq.  We cannot leave Iraq before the new government is strong enough to stand without us; thus, independent.  It takes time.      Every single person living in the USA has more opportunity to succeed personally and financially, WITHOUT an additional "handout" from the government.  Our country is already providing opportunity.    Keep an open mind... don't just believe the TV News.

Either someone really Brutal takes over and murders the competition or we play babysitter.  Not like we get a choice.    And don't you know by now these are not government handouts. It's political payback. There's hardly any actual economic stimulation in the whole bill, yet they're hoping you'll fall for the pretty words and let them "save" you. Without adversarial parties we'd be a "corrupt communism."  Let the adversarial system do its job.|`|N0iM1mo8aa	Can I hate govt. handouts and want us out of Iraq?  Handouts only keep people in poverty.  How many on walefare have moved out of walefare since it's inception?  I would bet that there are more 3rd or 4th generation people on walefare than there are people that have moved off of it.  Iraq needs to run their own country-but what does that matter.  Once we're out of Iraq Obama is just moving our troops north to Afghanistan.|`|MEReSvZeaa	Why is it that any time you talk to service members, they are anxious to serve in Iraq, but whenever you talk to liberals who have never set foot outside their own city, they pretend to know (and fear) the most?|`|EhoJ9mgsaa	I've noticed this is the left's new argument to gain support for the stimulus:    "You wasted money in Iraq, so why can't you waste money in America?"

Peace in the middle east can be obtained without military action, all it would require would be the US to do three things.     1. Cut ALL forms of support to Israel with no further support to be granted as long as Israel is in violtion of UNSC Resolutions.    2. Abstain from using it's VETO power in the UNSC on resolutions related to Israel.    3.

yvPA8FSsaa	Strange question.  Pay to play is the antithesis of a free market Capitalist system.  Pay to play is another word for bribery.  The Capitalist system requires that contracts be rewarded to those who can perform adequate work for the lowest price.  Not to those you donate the most money to a political campaign.     Pay to play is what runs two bit banana republics not free enterprise.  America's might comes from a free and open market where the best and most efficient are rewarded and the weak and wasteful fail.  This free market competition is what provides the best product and service for the least amount of money.      *|`|jEqISBnQaa	Well, corruption is generally "illegal in a capitalist system". Doh!    But, not always. Gray Davis got away with it until CA started falling apart after the electricity wars and then, despite his $100K Minimum Per Meeting Rule, he had to go away for being an incompetent  but, alas, not for being corrupt.    And then the CA electorate, in all its wisdom (lol), elected Arnie. Go figure! The best you can say about him is that he's NOT corrupt. Having all the money he already needs makes it a bit easier for him to spend his time thinking about things other than how to line his pockets. Best argument for reserving political positions for the rich that I can think of.|`|3c91df9cab412a7ca4201cdaf64121e3aa	Well, there is that entire illegal thing.  That is a big one.    But there also is this thing that is supposed to allow anyone in the nation that is a citizen to hold public office, no matter how much money they have, or who they know.      Why is it wrong?  Because it states as such in the US Constitution.  One must be elected.|`|briRpzL1aa	Maybe because it is called "corruption"...    Capitalist systems exist only when the best participant is able to compete.  When individual players conspire, they defeat this from occurring.|`|QvF8dR7Taa	capitalism lets people use there own talents to do as good as the market lets them,when the market is manipulated it gives an unfair advantage to unscrupulous people who only have a desire to make as much money as possible by killing compation or monopoly's.they dint have any other concern except the income,they don't care of the hardships or destructive things that result from there pursuit of greed.|`|4fda62554c07de687e2ca85293849ac6aa	Well in the free enterprise system you can only sell what you actually own.  If you sell things you don't personally own its called fraud.  Its wrong to commit fraud.    In a socialist system you can't sell, buy or own anything.

Are ambulances a form of socialism?|`|mwT1Ik5Jaa	Because they didn't want to leave. They want to have everything done for them. I was there working at one of the hospitals that was destroyed. We had people coming up in their cars for stupid things and then wanting to stay and have the hospital take care of them and all their friends with them. There is a HUGE entitlement mentality in New Orleans among the welfare class. They had the means to leave, of 70,000 cars had to be towed from the city after the floods.     Ray "Chocolate City" Nagan did not activate the disaster master plan for evacuation, he said there wasn't one to congress but there is as I worked for the city for years and we updated it frequently. People who didn't leave were because: stupid and didn't believe it would flood, wanted the government to take care of everything, people who had to work (Police, Firemen, Paramedics, Doctors, Nurses...)     Also remember that Katrina did not hit New Orleans directly it hit the Mississippi Gulf Coast and totally destroyed several towns but you didn't hear them crying about it.|`|VxfyQZ2jaa	You are wrong, but of course your "question" isn't about reality - it's about racism.    About 70,000 people were not able to evacuate New Orleans for Katrina and of those about 30,000 went to the Superdome (the designated shelter).    The people who couldn't leave stayed because - in the overwhelming majority of cases -.they literally did not have the money to do so.  They also would not have had the money to travel to DC for the Inauguration.|`|bHIfcilpaa	Louisiana has a seventy-five percent high school dropout rate, but somehow it was Bush's fault.

Except maybe you are a fool if you think that a certain one group is responsible for the entire mess.  EVERYONE is responsible for it.  Just because the loans were there doesn't mean a responsible adult had to take the loan out.  Just because the person could make a more-than-minimum payment on the credit card doesn't mean that the credit card companies had to raise the limit and make it so the person would want to charge more. . .

That is a completely different program.  Not all the people who couldn't afford their homes were "poor."  There were plenty of middle class and even upper-middle income who just had to have that $1 or $2 million dollar home that they really couldn't afford.  BTW, the CRA does not force banks to give loans to people with bad credit and no job--you don't know what the CRA is to say that.
mfYfeFCgaa	Having worked at a hotel myself, I think you are very wise to be vigilant of your patrons and what kind of people they are, as a hotel is a business that has to deal with it's customers for a longer period of time than many other businesses, and there are some people out there that go to places like hotels for the sole purpose of doing something illegal or just causing trouble. At the one I worked at, people were often caught cooking methamphetamine in the rooms or having parties with underage drinking, or using a room for prostitution. You never know about people who pass through your place and what their intentions may be. So, not only is it completely legal for you to refuse service to someone you know is a sex offender or any other type of criminal, but it's also smart. The only circumstances you cannot refuse business to someone, is if it is on the basis of something considered a protected category of anti discrimination law, i.e. race, national origin, disability, etc, but being a sex offender is not a protected category and as a business owner you have a right to refuse service to anyone you want for any reason you want, and being concerned about someone starting any kind of trouble on your property warrants your concern about them. I wouldn't want a known sex offender at my hotel either, knowing that people from everywhere with kids come through that type of place. To avoid having any trouble started, however, I wouldn't tell someone why you are refusing them service. Just tell them you're overbooked or something like that. Kudos to you for being careful about the kind of people you rent or don't rent to. You have reason to be! There are some scary people out there.|`|aCDWwsisaa	You cannot legally discriminate against a protected group; sex offenders are not a protected group, so yes, you can tell them they can't stay there.    If you have half-a-brain, though, and don't want someone you know to be a sex offender to stay there, you will tell them you are booked up.  It is never a smart move to go out of your way to enrage someone who has already lost their moral compass!|`|636202a5daab42fdc568f4ed6abb39e3aa	probably not. a hotel is a public accommodation. but when people check into a hotel, you wouldn't generally know too much about them, I would think.|`|c07v7O80aa	You can tell someone they can't stay there because anything. Or for no reason at all. You could have some problems if it was done on account of someone being in a class of persons whose rights to public accomodation are protected, but sex offender isn't one of them.|`|AbCeEZIhaa	There is no law that says you have to let anyone stay at your hotel, the issue is the reason you give for denying it. Tread very softly in how you handle this or you could get sued - sadly enough and lose. However, are you near a school, daycare etc? If you are that could be a different issue and you could deny them.|`|GEfUTyi8aa	because your the owner, you can tell someone to leave and dont give an answer as to why.  dont even say its because they are a sex offender, just say leave, no explanation.... its best not to open pandoras box..... meaning them saying discrimination or asking you how you know then pulling others into the mess... just say..."sorry but I have to ask you to leave"  if they ask why say just because and that you are not obligated to tell them..... they will know deep down.... I mean who likes sex offenders?

He could pass a lot of progressive legislation such as laws against usury, single payer health care reform, reproductive rights for women, stricter and more stringent laws when it comes to predatory lending.

As for "uplifting rhetoric", I'm glad we have a president who is honest about what's really happening. It could be raining and Bush would say it's sunny outside. That's one of the main reasons the country lost confidence in him. Talking about the progress and all the good things that were happening in New Orleans after Katrina, when everyone saw on their tv's that the situation was a disaster. Or a dozen suicide bombs going off in Iraq and Bush calls the situation "progress".

Hxttt7G0aa	You are very confused as to economic stats among republicans and democrats. That isn't your fault, it a big lie pushed in the media and entertainment industry, but the very rich democrat elite who own most of the media and entertainment industry.     Most of those super rich are democrats, some of them worked very hard, but most of the extremely rich are heirs of old money, nearly all of those are democrats.    Most of the very poor have made bad choices. Most of those who've done very well have put more effort in, often physical effort, but more often than that the kind of mental effort that goes far beyond what a 9-5 job requires. Most of those who've come up from nothing in business have worked much harder than the average joe. Many have been working 12 to 20 hours a day 6 or 7 days a week for a very long time before things work out, and sometimes even that wasn't enough and they fail, and many who are well off have failed and gotten back up and tried again and again. You don't see those who are satisfied with a 9-5 working like that, and you don't see that many who are not interested in putting much more into it making it to the top 2% either.    Some work very hard and have failed so far, and are poor right now. You won't see those guys whining about the rich and voting for those who engage in class warfare because they aspire to win at life and don't like others holding them down by applying onerous taxation against those who get ahead by putting in so much more effort than average.|`|4Vmlf902aa	Last time I check not all republicans were living the good life. It's true the lower and middle class work their asses off. These are the guys who know what it really means to "appreciate" having a job. Then again i'm not one of them.

For the rest of us 90% of America who goes to our 40-hour a week job with little hope for ever becoming "wealthy," we're at the mercy of the rich and legislators.

Sure, there are those who inherit their wealth, but generally most of the wealthy in America are wealthy because they worked hard to get it. Seems you are a bit jealous that you aren't wealthy and resent those who have worked to get where they are and don't have to work as hard as you seem to think you do. I think your jealousy has confused you.    I wish that I could fulfill that freshman's idea of the Republicans being wealthy, "last time he checked," but the truth is, I am not. Can't say the same for, let's say the Kennedy's, however, none of whom in the last two generations had to work at all for that money. I suppose you can say that smuggling, as Joe got the Kennedy money, is hard work, just not legal. Then there's Kerry, Pelosi, Gore, Dodd.....|`|UoGFo3Dhaa	Everyone I know works their butt of.

But they're too stupid to realize it. They don't read enough to realize how an economy functions.     They destroyed so many jobs and kept giving out unbelievable mortgages to people. That was a big mistake. Many of them are figuring it out though. The Republicans on this board are the last holdouts, and many of them must either be supported by their parents or very uneducated. Many Republicans in professional business positions are admitting that their belief in the free-market economy has been shattered, and that a good amount of regulation is needed.    EDIT: Dr. Phillopian worships business people. She neglects to mention the former business owners that burn out, lose their businesses and work at Wal-Mart. She thinks business owners should be sainted for what they're doing. I work hard for a living too, and I don't put myself on a pedestal.|`|d307fbd26168d0aae54b1779f57e62e1aa	To: All My Valued Employees,      There have been some rumblings around  the office about the future of this  company,  and more specifically,  your job.  As you know, the economy has changed  for the worse and presents many  challenges. However, the good news is this:  The economy doesn't pose a threat  to your job. What does threaten your job  however, is the changing political  landscape in this country. However, let me  tell you some little tidbits of  fact which might help you decide what is in  your best interests.          First, while it is easy to spew  rhetoric that casts employers against  employees, you have to understand that  for every business owner there is a Back  Story. This back story is often  neglected and overshadowed by what you see and  hear. Sure, you see me park my  Lexus outside. You've seen my  big home at last  years Christmas party. I'm sure; all these flashy icons of  luxury conjure up  some idealized thoughts about my life.     However, what you don't see is the  BACK STORY :    I started this company 28 years ago.  At that time, I lived in a 300 square  foot  studio apartment for 3 years. My entire living apartment was converted  into an  office so I could put forth 100% effort into building a company, which  by the  way, would eventually employ you.     My diet consisted of Ramen Pride  noodles because every dollar I spent went  back into this company. I drove a  rusty Toyota Corolla with a defective  transmission. I didn't have time to  date. Often times, I stayed home on weekends,  while my friends went out  drinking and partying. In fact, I was married to my  business -- hard work,  discipline, and sacrifice. Meanwhile, my friends got jobs. They  worked 40 hours a week and made a  modest $50K a year and spent every dime they  earned. They drove flashy cars and  lived in expensive homes and wore fancy  designer clothes. Instead of hitting  the Nordstrom's for the latest hot  fashion item, I was trolling through the  discount store extracting any  clothing item that didn't look like it was birthed  in the 70's. My friends  refinanced their mortgages and lived a life of  luxury.   I, however, did not.      I  put my time, my money, and my life into a business  with a vision that  eventually, some day, I too, will be able to afford these  luxuries my friends  supposedly had.    So, while you physically arrive at the  office at 9am, mentally check in at  about noon, and then leave at 5pm, I  don't. There is no "off" button for me.  When you leave the office,  you   are done and  you have a weekend all to  yourself. I unfortunately do not have the freedom. I  eat, and breathe this company  every minute of the day. There is no rest. There  is no weekend. There is no  happy hour. Every day this business is attached to  my hip like a 1 year old  special-needs child. You, of course, only see the  fruits of that garden -- the  nice house, the Lexus, the vacations... you  never realize the Back Story and  the sacrifices I've made.     Now, the economy is falling apart and  I, the guy that made all the right  decisions and saved his money, have to  bail-out all the people who didn't. The  people that overspent their paychecks  suddenly feel entitled to the same  luxuries that I earned and sacrificed a  decade of my life for.    Yes, business ownership has is  benefits but the price I've paid is steep and  not without wounds.       Unfortunately, the cost of running  this business, and employing you, is  starting to eclipse the threshold of  marginal benefit and let me tell you why:     I am being taxed to death and the  government thinks I don't pay enough. I  have state taxes. Federal taxes.  Property taxes. Sales and use taxes. Payroll  taxes. Workers compensation  taxes. Unemployment taxes. Taxes on taxes. I have  to hire a tax man to manage  all these taxes and then guess what? I have to  pay taxes for employing him.  Government mandates and regulations and al l the  accounting that goes with it,  now occupy most of my time. On Oct 15th, I wrote  a check to the US Treasury  for $288,000 for quarterly taxes. You know what  my "stimulus" check was? Zero.  Nada. Zilch.         The question I have is this: Who is  stimulating the economy? Me, the guy who  has provided 14 people good paying  jobs and serves over 2,200,000 people per  year with a flourishing business?  Or, the single mother sitting at home  pregnant with her fourth child waiting  for her next welfare check? Obviously,  government feels the latter is the  economic stimulus of this country.          The fact is, if I deducted (Read:  Stole) 50% of your paycheck you'd quit and  you wouldn't work here. I mean, why  should you? That's nuts. Who wants to  get rewarded only 50% of their hard  work? Well, I agree which is why your job  is in jeopardy.     Here is what many of you don't  understand ... to stimulate the economy you  need to stimulate what runs the  economy. Had suddenly government mandated to  me that I didn't n|`|NYg0M9Ttaa	So I'm guessing you don't have a lot of money and are a democrat?|`|lJPT0PGGaa	I see you are a big supporter of private ownership.

God, you are scary!!|`|BYVr1tOGaa	yeah..well you will see, when we stop|`|twPZBsH2aa	Why do liberals assume that wealthy people are republicans? Most are democrats, including wall street bankers, hollywood fat cats, etc., they're all liberals and democrats.    It's a great myth spread by the liberals that wealthy people are conservatives, being conservative it about attitudes and beliefs, not about how much money you have. But the Liberals keep pushing this idea to conceal the true facts. Think Teddy Kennedy will ever admit to being rich? Or John Kerry, or Nancy Pelosi? Didn't think so.|`|maBzn6v7aa	The Federal Reserve system encourages the "working man" to go farther and farther into debt by making purchases via loans and credit cards.    In essence, the wealthy get "wealthier" by putting the working class farther in debt.    This is bigger than Dem/Repub because most politicians from both parties support the continued existence of this corrupt institution.|`|9cbd33d2161007ec93c0593d77c8434faa	No that is not it, that the poor are lazy.  That is crazy.  Some people are just gifted or luckier then others. Just because the rich made smart investments and made money that way does not make them lazy it make them smart.

Show me evidence of one single wealthy American (in the private sector) does not log at least 70 hours a week at their job.    Did you know that the vast majority of all divorces happen among RICH people?    Also, did you know that the vast majority of ALL divorce is due to financial issues?    Put those together? Do rich people get divorced because one of the thinks they are not quite rich enough?    Not to mention that the AVERAGE education (in terms of years) between the middle class and those making more than $370,000/year (the top tax bracket) is approx. 4 years...     You should study something before you speak! Don't worship the media, they almost always lie!|`|X1bKThZ1aa	Why is being rich so evil?  I thought that opportunity is what America was about.      Anyone can get a student loan, get an education, and make something of themselves.  Very few people should actually be dependent on the Government.      Look at the victims of Hurricaine Katrina.  They couldn't get out of that area with a weeks notice, yet we can get a million people in and out of DC during inauguration day.  People are just too dependent on the Government to do everything for them.      People who are rich usually took risks and chances.  They deserve the  money they earn.|`|SkWzsnuxaa	Notice that you use words and phrases like "it seems". You make assumptions based on your feelings and in describing how hard the lower and middle class work you can't even be bothered to "work" on the computer to find some simple easy to find facts about who works and who lives off inherited income and the like in America. If you were to research this you would be embarrassed that you put forth such a ridiculous notion. And you would also be embarrassed to find out just what Republicans and conservatives actually think about those who work hard. The one good thing about hard work is that it always pays off and conservatives respect you for it. It is the liberals who scoff and belittle those who work hard instead of waiting for a hand out. It is the liberals who think there is something honorable about being poor and needing help.     You know nothing of what you speak and with all your advantages you should be ashamed that all you do is drink the koolaid that is offered to you.|`|YSuc7L8taa	Logic my friend. You cannot become wealthy without hard work.  The wealthy are the ones that create jobs.  I have never worked for a poor person, have you?|`|IAmnOIhvaa	Where did the money come from to start?    Who took the initiative?    Who learned from their mistakes over, and over, and over until success was achieved and employees could be hired?    Yes, quite possibly, the lower and middle classes probably do work the hardest. But, they were not the ones to initiate the project in its early stages. They were not the ones to take on a massive debt hoping their ideas would blossom into a working, productive, and successful business.    It is not the Republicans that have contributed to the shrinking middle class. It is people themselves striving for success.|`|5CwL5wauaa	If Republicans are anything like their rich, and obnoxious, media spokes persons there is no wonder why they are not held in the highest regard.|`|AA11614944	Oh that is right, the super wealthy of the left, those are the only ones that "earned" their money. soros cheated his way to his billions, oprah has not worked in a long long time, and all of the hollywood liberals, penn clooney, saradon, streisand, etc. you think they work for their money?and then there are the kennedys, the kohls; these are not poor people.

How many people do the poor employ?|`|G49lKR56aa	Rockefeller's (D) very old money  Kennedy's (D) again very old money  Kerry's (D) very old someone else's money (Heinz)  Just to name a few!  Lower and middle class people are Republicans! If their not they should be! They are the ones that know how hard it is to make money and then to have someone in our government take it from them with higher taxes for social programs that benefit the lazy, drunk, illegals, and bail outs for the CEO's of Wall Street and Auto makers!  It is true that Bush said give them something like 300 Billion dollars, but it was obama that tacked another 800 Billion on top of that!

AA10617196	Liberals NEVER apologize for anything.    There are lots of things we will find out about as time unfolds, concerning the wars in Iraq and Afganistan.  Obama knows SOME of them now, but will keep with the liberal line of attacks on President Bush.      Bush, being the upright man that he is, has not revealed things that would exonerate him with the public after the intense campaign that was waged against him in the media was successful in damaging his image.  He is too much a gentleman to complain or defend himself.  He was right and we ALL will know it in the end.     God Bless W.!|`|w8QUHh7faa	Simply it was not the yellow cake that Bush referred to in his state of the union address.

Problem is, looking at the responses below there are plenty of morons out there who don't want to do their own research and take everything CBS & CNN tell this as the truth.  They don't realize how biased the media is, and just accept everything as fact.      Now they worked so hard to get Jimmy Carter Jr. into office and he's screwed more things up in a few weeks than Bush did in eight years.

I can go to google and find many different WMD's found in Iraq by our service members, including the yellow cake, and I can go to a book store and find Saddam's own scientists describing in detail Saddam's WMD programs, and liberals are never convinced.    It seems that their hatred for America is so deep that they are desperate for America to be guilty of war crimes, genocide, whatever their idiotic minds need.    My job, my pleasure, and my duty as a veteran, is to ram it right down their dysfunctional throats as often as I get the opportunity.    ********************  Judging from the answers so far, the delusion continues.  Take a look at all the people pleading with you that yellow cake is NOT a WMD.    They have no idea how uranium enrichment works.    All you need is a low-power nuclear reactor to generate nuclear power for electricity, something that purifies uranium to 10% uranium 238.  Not hard to come by.    Yellow cake has no energy uses.  It is manufactured for a single purpose:  to develop into weapons grade (90%+ purified uranium 238).    The yellow cake shipped through Canada WAS the smoking gun, and the America-hating brain-dead liberals have no idea that they just soiled themselves as traitors saying otherwise.|`|MDq1XVWRaa	I believe they were waiting for an apology from Bush and Cheney for date raping America for 7 years while yelling 9/11 and terrorist in their face over and over...    2 buildings fell and Americans died.

It was not secret, nor had it been purchased in the years preceeding the 2003 invasion. It was remnants of decades old nuclear projects that had been put out of commission years earlier.     The U.S.A did ameliorate a potential security threat by shipping it out, but it was not, as claimed, proof that Iraq had WMDs prior to the 2003 invasionwhich is what Bush based his invasion on.     http://www.snopes.com/politics/war/yello...|`|a388e4e3066dcb4e1de9e18979b89ef0aa	he lied............ period    from your own MSNBC site:  Israeli warplanes bombed a reactor project at the site in 1981. Later, U.N. inspectors documented and safeguarded the yellowcake, which had been stored in aging drums and containers since before the 1991 Gulf War. There was no evidence of any yellowcake dating from after 1991, the official said.    U.S. and Iraqi forces have guarded the 23,000-acre site  surrounded by huge sand berms  following a wave of looting after Saddam's fall that included villagers toting away yellowcake storage barrels for use as drinking water cisterns.|`|Sqp6HjtMaa	Why didn't Hannity report it 24/7 instead of blaming Liberals for not reporting it 24/7?|`|ioCiw5zlaa	Yawn    Only neocons do not realize that the yellowcake in your link had been inspected and accounted for YEARS  before Bush's lies.

Lets look at a couple things really quick.     1. CNN had a short clip early in the war about several 55gallon drums of pesticide found, along with 105mm shells. Now, I don't know about Iraq, but in the US, no farmers I know us 105 shells to spray their fields for bugs!    2. NBC and ABC visited with an Iraqi Scientist who was liberated. He told them most of the WMD's had went to Syria prior to the war. He also said, he had most of the components for an atomic bomb buried in his backyard up to two weeks before the US went into Iraq.    3. My nephew was over there for the main event and they found all kinds of evidence that " something" had been moved. Also, they found all kinds of bunkers that had been opened and what ever was in there, moved.    No, the media think they are God, Ooops, cant say that, Separation of Church and State.

I will buy your airline ticket.    EDIT: I am a true American. I support my country and stand behind my Pres. Even when I don't like what is happening I am still an American.

vGu6bcR9aa	Willing to pay the massive taxes required to build and maintain the prison space needed for all that mandatory sentencing?    Willing to have the prison built on that vacant lot two blocks from your house?    Didn't think so.    Neither is anyone else. And that's your answer.|`|AbCeEZIhaa	They are not bypassing federal law, the federal laws are not applicable in most of these cases. Ask any judge and he or she will tell you if it were up to them they would max out every person that comes their way that does these kinds of crimes. The rub is that taxpayers pay to babysit them in prison. Prisons are the biggest budget item of a state and of most county governments. No one wants to spend to house them, no one wants to spend to correct behaviors so the courts are pressured into lesser sentences.     And actually, as far as sentencing is concerned your average, 1st time bank robber is doing more time in county jail pre-trial than they are in prison. Time cuts are huge in state and federal prison.|`|RgblqqxIaa	Because they plead to lesser crimes which serves the public good by less resources wasted on going to court and less incarceration time - carrying a gun is not as heinous as actually killing someone.  Furthermore, most crimes are not perfect so prosecutors will plead down usually because they don't have sufficient evidence for a conviction or have more pressing matters to deal with.
odBWpML6aa	I agree that Obama uses Saul's 13th a lot.  As with Rush.  As with Hillary.  As with McCain.  And with Palin -- that snarky "lipstick on a pig" remark!  Despicable, the Usurper is a despicable woman-hating woman-abusing cad, much like Bill Clinton.  Exactly how much time did the Usurper President Barry Soetoro spend with dying beloved Grandma Toot?  Ten minutes?  A selfish woman-hating cad.     But the rule Obama himself has pledged his mission to is 10.  Community Organizing -- mega millions and billions for ACORN vote fraud, propaganda and other mob clubhouse organizing efforts.    To constantly harass his enemies, to rule the mob's worship and sacrifices for him.  To establish the future temple-houses and altars of Cult Obama.    As Alinsky, dear old Saul wrote:  "10. The major premise for tactics is the development of operations that will maintain a constant pressure upon the opposition. It is this unceasing pressure that results in the reactions from the opposition that are essential for the success of the campaign."    Obama, is the most apt of students.|`|58607c6ba5c8f548e69203c94d723527aa	9. "The threat is usually more terrifying than the thing itself."    Scaring everyone in to supporting his stimulus package.

He had the most expensive inauguration in history, his stimulus bill is so expensive that our great-grandchildren will still be paying for it and just a week ago, our Chicago newspaper had a front page story on how Michelle exchanged a $5,000 pair of earrings Obama just gave her for a $12,000 pair.  His actions certainly don't match his talk.      What confuses me though is  2, because a lot of the people he is choosing for posts in his cabinet have little to no experience at all in what they are supposed to now be in charge of.|`|zJecdxXcaa	It seems to me the Clintons used these more than Obama, especially the ridicule, but I'd say Obama uses 8 the most.

I personally believe that people owe community service to their communities whether it is a requirement or not.    It isn't going to be mandatory unless perhaps you are in a school that has a service requirement as a matter of policy, such as the school that my son attends.    If you are attending a school that currently does not have a community service requirement but decides to add a community service requirement,  I expect that you will figure out a way to dodge it.|`|uFTO5rs8aa	Leave the country; you won't be missed.|`|yvPA8FSsaa	Vote out Democrats and vote in Republican Congressmen.    *|`|a7c22dd3a3ed6b12011a02bf27c95704aa	Claim that you are his illegitimate son.|`|uYjA7LxKaa	You get a C.

AA10025824	Picture an amphibious assault where a few thousand Marines are landing.  Surprise or not, and with the support from an air strike or a ship firing, that's a formidable wall of firepower.  That's what an amphibious assault is designed for.  In the meantime the Airborne is landing behind the lines coming up from behind and that's the surprise.  Each of these techniques have their own purpose.|`|esOaJoqBaa	Sometime surprise is not they only thing that is important. You can only drop so many people and expect that they will arrive at the right target.   Amphibious assaults are also useful as part of a multi-pronged attack and for confusing the enemy.  The Marine Corps focuses more on helicopter borne assaults these days anyway, with amphibious raid usually limited to smaller raids and recon missions.|`|TfpeYyuwaa	well it depends on the situation, doesn't it?|`|1h6IUwJmaa	some description..?  How large of an assault, if were taking Navy seals size, then it will definitely surprise the opponent.  But generally, if thousands of guys are jumping from planes on you(alla WW2), then the lines will be divided, and getting an effective counter attack is more difficult.      An amphibious assault can still surprise people though, i don't know why you would think they wouldn''t.|`|22tPNksKaa	It depends. The Germans at Normandy had on hell of a 'surprise' when they woke to find over a thousand warships raining hell on them!    Airborne assaults can be used on landlocked targets. But in Crete, the Germans were slaughtered wholesale because the DIDN'T have surprise. They still won the battle. Unfortunately for them, their leaders lost faith in that Strategy. The battle of Arnhem was a case where the British Paratroopers ran into a Hell of a reception! But amphibious assaults have work far more often. Dieppe though was just a weak raid, but proved  useful in learning what NOT to do.    The St. Nazaire raid was devastating to the Germans. Despite the massive defenses they had. So Amphib. Assaults have more punch to them. Air Assaults need to keep moving or else they are toast. Plus they lack tanks & other heavy b u t t-k i c k i n g hardware!    Um, the SEALs can either go by water OR by air, hence SEaAirLand. So even w/ a warning, the island will likely be surprised either way! Of course, as good as SEALs are, only a squad can kill so many bad guys. If there are too many, they could get overwhelmed.|`|6ohMYKjnaa	You really need to read about D-Day(6 June 44). There are many books written about this assault.    It was a U.S. Army, British, and Canadian Army operation. It used both Airborne and Amphibious assaults.    While it was extensively planned, that plan went, as they say, "To hell in a hand basket," even before the first Airborne Troops hit the ground.    Any way. Both types of assault has its merits, and pit falls. At Normandy, both for each was exposed.    BTW, During Desert Strom....even though the USMC had planned and practiced for an Amphibious assault into Kuwait, and the 82nd Airborne plans and pratices for Airborne assaults all the time, neither were used.|`|378161a161ce8b1460b92ef6619f0c5baa	I'll give you a small island to defend. I'll tell you that on monday or tuesday, a squad of SEALs is going to sneak on the island and kill you all.     Lemme know your opinion on a water based attack then.
9tcv3TiWaa	Navy isn't MP it is MA - Master at Arms, they are not Soldiers but Sailors.      Where they go, what they do, how long they are gone for depends on their orders.

They are not deployed any more than any other Rating in the Navy.|`|AA10025824	They're military police, and they're thought of the same way as anyone else in the military.  They don't get deployed more often, they're usually deployed if their ship gets deployed or they're needed at a base somewhere else.

AA10025824	The thing about swimming is that you will gain confidence if you work at it a little.  As far as Marine Boot camp you won't need to swim like an olympic gold medalist.  There are people who go to boot camp not knowing how to swim at all.  You will learn how, and they won't let you drown, but they aren't going to teach you like you would teach a young kid.

I'm pretty sure the test at the end of the swimming week is to stay afloat for 5 minutes and swim 50 yards a couple times, but you can do more research online.   On the other hand i recommend learning everything possible before hand because to be a marine its vital to swim in many different measures and instances.|`|q3E1ouQvaa	Depending on what MOS you are signing up for, this may be a real problem for you.

In fact, I may have more money now than I did before because of lower gasoline prices. However, the long term is a different story. Since most of my retirement money was in stocks and bonds, I have taken a tremendous hit there and will have less money when I retire than I otherwise would have had. By the time I had gotten to the bank to see a financial expert and have things revamped and reworked, I discovered that I had lost approximately $17,000! That may not seem like a lot of money to some, but it is to me.

Note that I don't love it, and disagree with many points in it, but to say that it completely misses the mark is not true.    The money to combat sicknesses? That's called preventative medecine. The aim is to prevent people from getting sick so as to avoid having to treat them afterwards. This means that fewer people ever get sick in the first place, which leads to more people being able to work and fewer people running into health-related financial issues.    College scholarships? That should be self explanatory. This leads to a better educated population, which leads to more educated future employees that will make us more competitive on the world stage. Furthermore, it's easier for those with a college degree to find work, and many people would not be able to afford higher education were it not for government assistance (I know I wouldn't be able to attend college without it.)    Edit: Though I don't know that I should be answering this question at all, as I'm not an "Obamabot."    I kinda wonder why I bothered answer.

Aren't you the one doing "cherry picking"? Taking 18 billion seemingly unrelated spending out of 800 billion? Taking those 18 billion most vulnerable for criticisms? Out of total to be 800 billion package?     May be its good to wait, figure out how that 780 billion will be spent exactly before handing it out.

68fPlKttaa	You can be any age actually. You can only buy Student Bonds when your any age. But for the other bonds you must be 18 and older because thats the age of majority. Student Bonds are allowed because they are a way to save up money for your post-grad education in case you want to go to college and or university. If you like to purchase a student bond and or the other bonds you can go to your bank and talk to a banker and he/she will take you their office and go on their computer and find out how much the interest rate is for that certain bond. If you're a student wishing to buy a bond to earn money for post-grad education you should start around 10 because in bout 8 or 9 years you will or should be at the stage where your applying for colleges or universties. And the bonds are usually around 2-5& interest rate compounded annually meaning you get 2-5% each year so if you start around 14 or 15 or 16 then you won't be earning much. Right now its good time to buy because the interest rate is up at 4.75% and so if you're 10 right now dought you are you're prob 14 or 15. Lets say 14 then if you invest like $100. Next yr you will have $104.50 which isn't much and by the time your 18 will have around 130 or 140 dollars. Note this it doesn't add interest to the $100 its the total amount so in the second yr it will be 4.75% of 104.50 and not 100 so ur earning more. Also note this, unlike stocks you won't lose money in these because these aren't a real investment but a bond so you won't lose your money even if the economy is doing badly and you're in a depression(not meaning you're emo lol).|`|Jx1Zzs5vaa	why would you do something that stupid?|`|Dunc379maa	You can be any age and if you are under 18 years old, as long as your mother or father or legal guardian allow you or authorize you to do it, then you can.

However, all you need for bonds is a legal guardian's signature. Good luck|`|briRpzL1aa	Why???  The yields are terrible right now...  Also, the age limit would be 18...  Meaning, you need to be a legal adult..    There is a better way, however.  Just buy a CD from a distressed bank..  You can get yields of 5% to 6% and it is still FDIC insured.  Meaning, it has all of the same benefits of US Treasuries, but also yields considerably more..  Also, there is no age limit on buying a CD.     Good Luck and I Hope this Helps..|`|nJCzYIt0aa	18.cause when  i was 18 im buying it|`|aKvxy3xBaa	There isn't an age minimum but you need a social security number. You can go to the bank and get them.

C7wjR42Daa	That is not true at all..    When you get stationed at your duty station you can apply for base housing and you can bring your wife out with you. It's your home until you leave that base for another permanent assignment. While deployed your wife stays there if she wishes.    Remember that you may get stationed somewhere where no spouses are permitted and your wife can not join you until you have arrived in your permanent unit and have arranged everything.|`|AA12215630	Not true. If you deploy your wife will be able to live where she is at. She will be able to remain there until you come back home. They will not ask her to leave or tell her to move. That is a decision that she can make however if she wants to move while you are deployed she will have to pay for the move to where she wants to go. The military will not pay for that move or move her back when you come home.    I know lots of wives that move back "home' when their spouses deploy. But my family move so much, it is so much easier to stay put and do what we were already doing.|`|9tcv3TiWaa	When you get accompanied orders to a base after you have completed Recruit training and schooling then you will qualify for housing.  If you deploy your spouse can stay in housing because you are still based there.  The time that they can't is if you get orders to an overseas base unaccompanied, meaning no family with you.   You don't necessarily have to live in housing you can live out in town and you will get BAH - Housing allowance based on your rank and zip code of the command.     Now while you are in Recruit Training & schooling you are eligible for the BAH based on your spouses zip code BUT with the Marines they do not issue first pay until the Recruit has completed training then you will get the pay and it is backdated to the date you started.|`|SkWzsnuxaa	You will receive housing if it is available. Most bases have limited housing and those with the greatest need will go to the head of the line. And that means those Marines with children. The higher your rank and the more kids you have the more likely you are to get housing. If you do not get housing then you will receive a housing allowance which will be enough to rent or buy suitable lodging and pay utilities.     When you deploy your wife will remain in housing if she is in housing. Otherwise she will continue to receive the housing allowance to pay for your home. You can look up the housing allowance on the website below.|`|082vOBNKaa	short/simple answer, yes she will be able to stay in housing when you get deployed. its not technically free, you will be given BAH (Basic Allowance for Housing) each month as a married soldier or single soldier of a certain rank and may live on base in housing or find your own apartment out in town. if you live on base it will be taken right back out of your account like it was never there, if you live off base you have to pay your rent just like as a civilian.|`|57N8Ls5Oaa	All the other posters are right.  But housing is not free.  You get BAH and it is given to the privatized housing to pay for your house.|`|BQY8b2YOaa	If you are married and you do get into housing, if you go on deployment then she will be able to stay in housing while you are away as long as she is still your spouse.  When you are in and have dependents, you can either opt to stay in on base housing or you can live out in town. If you live out in town i.e. rent an apartment, you will get a Basic Allowance fo Housing (BAH) to cover a majority of your rent, utilities etc. If you live in base housing you will not get that BAH but you will not have to pay rent or utilities.
mLabzxnIaa	You have a wife?|`|LWzrCu5caa	You in the Marines,   her in the National Guard?       How will it impact your marriage?    How about never being stationed together?    In the Guard she will have a unit, assigned to a state.  She is not going to be able to pick up and move from state to state to follow you around.   She will only be able to move to another Guard unit if they have an opening in her specialty and they want her and the her current base of assignment is willing to cut her loose.       It would be better if you both went active duty Marines.   Your chances of being assigned together would be much higher.       (Personally your wife sounds mercenary,  wanting to join for the bonus and schooling. )|`|JDxpjT34aa	Unless you're in the same branch of the military you will be at separate bases and not be able to see each other very often.|`|HWP7NxNAaa	Dual military families have better luck remaining together when they are members of the same branch. If you are different branches, they cannot guarantee that you will be stationed together...or even NEAR each other for that matter.|`|1wIek546aa	Yeah, try never getting to see each other.    You both would be better off finding a service together that you both want to join.     Air-force and USCG (for sure...not sure about the other services) will station you within at least 50 miles of each other...i'd look into one of those if you are interested in staying married.

You don't just pick and choose laws to obey.  You shouldn't think it's OK to disobey a law just because you don't feel like obeying it.  It's part of being mature and living in a civilized society.    Addition: If you don't like a law, there are ways to go about having a law changed that doesn't hurt people.  Breaking the law can and does hurt people, and this includes drug use.  If you are someone who wants to have pot legalized, then that's fine. Fight to have the law changed.  But each time you buy illegal drugs, you are giving money to people that are murderers, who finance terrorism, etc.  Don't blame the police for you getting busted for breaking the law, breaking the law is a decision YOU make.|`|AA10927745	we dont all obey the law  i run red lights while using drugs...|`|Xt7jo8bcaa	Cause with my luck I'd be the one to get caught|`|o0VyLaPiaa	Because the laws are there for your protection and for the protection of others.

It can cause any person that a pothead comes into contact with to be in danger cause their not completely in their right mind.    If you run red lights at night it makes it easier for it to become a habit during the day which will cause others to be in danger.    I hate it when potheads complain about how police officers and law enforcement are unfair because they tell the potheads, who are the ones killing themselves just so they can get high, that they can't smoke because it does in fact put others in danger.

Yourself.|`|AA10470367	To some degree I believe what you are asking is why isn't it Ok to do what you want as long as you don't get caught. This line of reasoning, unfortunately, is becoming quite common today. An obvious example is the current financial mess this country is in. For many, many years loans were OK'ed for the purchase of homes where the people approving the loans knew the loans should not have been given. However, since no one challenged ( same as not being caught) the ill approved loans, the practice of bad loans became the norm. People knew it was wrong at that time, but it went on. Now look at where we are, we ALL have to pay for these bad deeds. Was it OK to do it because it didn't appear to hurt anyone? How about the use of drugs? Not hurting anyone? Get your head out of the sand. The drug problem is huge in this country. I would venture an opinion that most ( all?) of these drug users started small? Didn't hurt anyone? And now look at what we have. If you start actually thinking about all of these bad human choices, it becomes very clear there is a huge price to be paid by all for the terrible choices by a few. Bottom line, I believe when someone finally gets caught for making bad choices you will find the person exercised these poor choices so often that they became the norm and the person justified them in his or her head that they were OK because they had been done so many times, that it was no big deal.

wdBY1fWaaa	Bush did not stammer nearly as much as Obama. No way. Yes, Bush stuttered and stammered at times, but Obama has him beat BY FAR on that one....and he's only been president for two weeks.    Obama Stutters: http://video.google.com/videosearch?hl=e...    I know people that do this same stuttering. It's a nervous reaction when you catch them in a lie, or they are a loss for words, or they are searching for a better explanation to something they can't explain. Watch also how Obama touches his face alot, especially around the mouth. This is a reaction people do when they tell a lie, almost to stop the words coming out of their mouth.    That's the truth.|`|yZXe2XLlaa	Uh uh Uh  UHBAMA!|`|wppUvy4maa	I usually don't but I'm going to have to give it to Obama this time because he's ALL talk.|`|CvBJ3RKPaa	Obama is the better speaker by far.|`|aGNjZmyJaa	Half Republican and half Democrat?

Being able to give an inspiring speech is no measure of the ability to make sound decisions. So far, Obama hasn't made many good decisions.    His appointees --- tax dodgers ? What's up with that.    Closing GITMO before having a plan for the prisoners? Stupid.    Meeting with Iranian president to make peace -- does Obama think he;s going to change Islamic beliefs that Christians and Jews are to be killed? Is he kidding? Or is he just foolish and uninformed.    Obama would be better playing president in a hollywood movie, where someone else writes all his lines and the story makes sense.|`|tn2ur8vOaa	Who gives a Shiiit really? What is more important is which one can make better decisions. Obama is proving everyday that he is in over his head: He thinks he alone can fix the economy with the absolute joke of a spending package called the stimulus bill? He keeps nominating people who do not pay their taxes and have conflicts of interests as Sec of State.  I am amazed you consider yourself informed by worrying which of the two clowns speaks better.

AA10690306	You mean like the Republicans have done for the last eight years?  Accusing anyone who disagreed with them of being "UNPATRIOTIC"and of making American citizens "Disappear" into the legal system for up to a year at a time by using 1) the Witness Protection Laws 2) The Patriot Act  3) The Military Powers Act and of sending American citizens to be held in other countries so they could not be found.    Sean F you just described what the Bush administration has done for years!    Since the Republicans lost the elections I have seen them attack everything that the new administration has done using what Bush and company did as what they are doing wrong.  TALK ABOUT HIPPOCRACY!

I scored high and still volunteered for 0311. There are a lot less spots in the other MOS's then 0311. 0311 was fun, but when you get back into civi life, you really can't be hired on as a grunt anywhere. (Forget Blackwater, it's a waste of time. and you won't be going anywhere soon). Pick a MOS that you can take with you.|`|z42u6Tbkaa	If you want to be an 0311 you'll be one. If you want to be a machine gunner 0331, or a mortarman 0341, etc etc you have to apply for it during soi. The instructors say if you want to be a machine gunner stand here and they look at those guys and see if they make the cut. If you don't try and become a wpns mos you're an 0311 automatically.    You join the infantry because you want to be in the infantry, not because you want it to transfer to a civi job.|`|WU5nNdTqaa	I honestly wouldnt rely on this.

I've been following this coming great depression for years and one thing I realized is that the way the system has been engineered the only way to keep it going to to spend more and more cash.  The only way to keep it going just a little bit longer is exactly the thing that will bring it crashing down.  There's no hope of possibly reforming the system, it's as good as dead.

Are you choosing fast food over healthy food? Nope.    Still buying bottled water? Never did. I use a filter and have my own water bottle.    Do you drive your car or take public transportation? I don't drive much as my work is close by and so are my friends.    What do you do to conserve various types of energy? Shut everything off when it's not in use, wash my dishes by hand, turn the water off when brushing my teeth, I have a garden in the summer, and I carpool.    What do you suggest we do as a people to help the economy? Support our local businesses as much as possible, and try to buy American. I was raised doing these things, it is not a change I made because of the times we are in. This has to be a lifestyle. Try to live within your means, that is the most important thing. I know some people are forced to live off credit or buy homes they can't afford, but you can live well if you would just give up a little convenience. There is so much financial advice available on the internet or at a library. You can find out how much you can truly afford and compare it to how you live now. They can tell you whether something is a good investment, how to get out of credit card debt the fastest way, how much you could afford in rent or for a car, etc.    For example a good friend of mine makes double what we do but his living standard is far below ours. It's because we cook our own food, don't buy snacks and drinks for work at convenience stores everyday (it really adds up), don't buy fast food unless it's necessary, don't waste gas by making 10 trips to the store in a week, don't buy processed food (also overpriced). I don't fault people for their own choices but I do hate when they complain about being broke while doing these things all the time.|`|63e413147f262ec68d5946ef36ffb354aa	How about it this way.

teKeLxX2aa	It seems that you have a lot of questions, which is a good thing because you want to get the most out of your service. But I would advise that you print this list out and bring it to your local Navy recruiter, so he can better explain the policies and procedures which may have changed over the years. Your going to want definitive closure on things before enlisting, so don't just go and take someone's word on Yahoo Answers and assume that its 100% correct, get it written on a legal document. However, I'll answer a couple of your questions just because I was in the same position that you are in currently.    As an enlisted sailor you don't really have much discretion regarding where you get sent. You go where the Navy needs you, especially as a junior enlisted. Once you've been in for a while and go up in rank, you may be asked where it is you want to go on a list, but even then nothing is certain. Old time sailors would joke that wherever you want to go, don't put it down as your first choice.     To be a construction electrician, you'd probably want a decent ASVAB score (higher than 70 I assume), but don't take my word for it because for my rate I only needed a 55, even though I scored an 88. Most rates in the Navy don't require extremely high ASVAB's (except for Nukes). Your recruiter should be able to tell you what you need to get for a specific rate. For questions 3-8 you definitely need to ask your recruiter, because the answers will vary, but there are bonuses for certain rates,    You can take college classes in the Navy and they'll help pay for it, but it has to be on your own time (and most people don't have the time in the service, especially if your on deployments a lot).    Lastly, the only swimming test they make you do is extremely easy, so I wouldn't fret it unless you can't swim at all (most athletically inclined recruits can pass the basic swimming requirement). If your in the DEP program and you pass a multiple choice test in basic, you should get promoted to E-2. You can go into the Navy as an E-3 if you have a certain number of college credits or if you became an Eagle Scout. The time it takes to become a second or first class petty officer varies depending on your rate, dedication and productivity. Nuke's can make Chief in less than 7 years, while most rates take at least ten years or longer.     If you have anymore questions, feel free to email me and I'll try to help out anyway I can.|`|99ea9ef1d3ccadf76a367bfdcafd8593aa	If you become a construction Electrician or CE you will be stationed at NMCB Port Hueneme, CA or at NMCB Gulfport, MS. SeaBees do not spend much time aboard ships but they do deploy plenty. The Bees have a fair presence in Iraq supporting the ops there but can certainly deploy to Afghanistan or any number of places.  Yes you can join the DEP after your junior year and get your rate guaranteed. To become a PO 1 you are looking at 5-6 years minimum, even the nuclear field takes a bit to get to E6 with the time in rate requirements.|`|367926de3fa96492022d3fae80bbab42aa	There is a ton of information available on the internet to find the answers to your questions.     One resource you might want to check out is www.navygirl.org where there is a ton of different resources available to give you some inside information on the Navy.     You might also want to purchase a blue jacket manual online. You'll get a copy while in boot camp but if you get one before and read it you will be a leap ahead of other recruits.     Another resource you can check out is the BMR (Basic Military Requirements) which is a correspondence manual that people in the Navy can complete. Use this link http://compass.seacadets.org/cadets/nscc... and you will learn many basics about the Navy.     Between those 3 resources you will have alot of useful knowledge that will help you out in your career. Good Luck.|`|rYNM67oyaa	The answer for your questions 2 and 3 are here.     http://usmilitary.about.com/library/mili...    The ASVAB will have one score total and will be broken down into the different aptitude scores which is what is shown here. So until you take the ASVAB you won't know. Only the recruiter will be able to break it out for you. There is a practice ASVAB here.    http://www.military.com/ASVAB    Take the ASVAB now and see if you qualify for Construction Electrician. If you don't you can study and retake it. You can be in DEP for one year for whatever reason, waiting on a job slot or to graduate.   The 99 days of A school (tech school) is not counting weekends and holidays so it will be about 20 weeks.   The following questions are subject to changing answers, you'd need to ask a recruiter. 4-9    http://navy.com/    The swimming test they give you is the 3rd class swim test.    http://usmilitary.about.com/od/navy/l/bl...    http://usmilitary.about.com/od/navyjoin/...|`|xNs7wLaCaa	Dont Join if you are not 100percent I was the same way.|`|yPeP33rxaa	Ok ok at Meps you need your I.d and your recruiter with give you all the paper work. When at Meps you will get to choose your job the higher the asvab score is the better job you will get! Bonuses depend on what job. Not all jobs get bonuses. After Meps you will enter DEP program it might take more than 3 months to ship out but you can request to leave early in A school if you pass and you are at the top of your class you will get to choose where do you wanna be stationed at. In the DEP program you can try to move up to e-2 or e-3|`|AA10025824	First, you don't pick where you get stationed.  You can pick the field you are going into but unless you re-enlist for a home port there's no guarantees.   If you get a decent score on the ASVAB everything is open to you.  A schools can last 3 months on up.  Bring all the documents you have to MEPS but your recruiter will make sure you know what to do. Your job is assigned when you are done with A school.  You leave for basic training very quickly or on an agreed upon date.  The jobs that give bonuses are the one's that are the least manned and most needed.  for example, you will probably max out the bonuses if you are a Corpsman SEAL, while on the other hand if you are a field med corpsman you may get nothing.   Don't count on getting a degree  from the Navy unless you go into an officers program but the schooling and experience can be applied toward a degree.  and the swimming tests are nothing anyone in decent shape who can swim okay can't pass.   And, to get rank immediately you can go into a rating which requires you to go to a long A school and obligate to 5 or 6 years active and you'll get E-4 automatically out of boot camp.  Making 1st class will take a few  years.  There's a required amount of time between ranks, then you have to pass the test, and if the rating is full you'll have to pass the test with a higher score than others to make rank.|`|AA10709853	1: No.   choice of duty station is NOT an option when first going in.  you also have zero say in where you are deployed to or where your liberty ports are.      2: LINE scores are what determine what ratings you are eligible for.   not your raw score( which is a max of 99).      3: depends on rating.  some are 2 weeks long.  others are 2 years long.    4:  Social security Card, DL, and BC , SS cards and marriage license (if applicable) of your spouse and children.      5: when you meet with the Classifier at MEPS.      6: when you ship depends on when a slot in A school opens up for the rating you get.  the max you can be in in DEP is 12 months.      7: Bonuses literally change daily.      8: not necessarily.   several things can get your higher payugrade besides enlisting in certain ratings.  college credits, signing off the PQS book, getting others to enlist..    9: not really.   you may not attend college full time while serving active duty.  takes about  twice as long to get a degree.   some of your military training will translate to college credits, but what each college will accept differs, depending on rating and other factors.      10: yes there is a swim test in boot camp.   you  may use any stroke.    enlisting in DEP does NOT grant you a higher paygrade.. meeting certain criteria does.  all DEP is is the waiting period between securing a guaranteed school and shipping out.        as for promotions: some ratings you can make E6 in just a few years.  in others.. it takes ten or 12.  Making First or second Class Petty Officer requires you to pass the exams with a high enough score to get promoted, as well as having good evals and the recommendation of your chain of command.

Let's see... trying to figure out how to pay for even MORE illegal Mexican refugees - who are now victimized not only by their corrupt government, but by the organizations who actually fund their corrupt government.    Then, we're going to give them MORE money and beg Canada to help out all in the name of protecting the homeland... then when that fails and their filthy drug-dealing cartel start oozing into the US on the shirt tails of the rest of their illegal immigrants, they will call for a united Canada-Mexico-United States to deal with the "problem" that has now infected the United States worse than it had before.    "Firstly, Prime Minister Stephen Harper can assure Mr. Obama of Canada's commitment to its bilateral relationships with both the United States and Mexico. And let's remember that given domestic political considerations, the United States sees its relationship with Mexico as more important. Any intimation that Canada is seeking to strengthen the U.S.-Canada relationship at the expense of our relationship with Mexico will, to put it mildly, not be seen as helpful. The Prime Minister may also mention that, given the situation in Mexico, now might not be the best time to tinker with NAFTA.    Canada can increase assistance to Mexico. The United States is investing $1.4-billion in the multiyear security Merida Initiative to support Mexican President Felipe Calderon's efforts against the drug cartels. But it is also channelling $28.9-million through the U.S. Agency for International Development to strengthen local institutions, justice systems and the rule of law."    It's a scam... ANOTHER scam... on the American tax-payer.    If Mexico was an Islamic country we'd have already blasted it off the planet and used the land for growing crops... sadly, probably poppy... but still.
AA10932453	If Canada or Mexico invaded the US, we would laugh at them and call the police.    If another country invaded, the US Navy would have the final say.  The enemy would never reach our shores.|`|N4u9DRvFaa	All Army, active, Guard and Reserves go to the exact same places for ALL training. The active Army does all the training. Same is true for the other Branches.    There are 550,000 active duty Soldiers and another close to equal number of Army Guard and Reserves for around 1.4 million right now.    The active Marine Corps has 190,000 or so active and 80,000 (a guess) in thier Reserves.    Then the great bulk of the Air Force is here. The Navy usually keeps half the Carriers close to home or in port putting those Air Wings at Lemoore in CA Fallonin NV or some other Naval Air Station or just offshore. The Navy has 70 attack subs, some patrol our coastlines along with Frigates looking for enemy subs.    The US militray consists of all that and more. Add the Guards 7 Infantry Divisions and 1 Heavy Armored Div backed by the Unorganized Militia that consists of all able bodied men 17-45, Vets up to 64. Plus all the Air Guard Fighters and Support units all over the country.    Now we take away 200,000-300,00 that are in Irag, Afghanistan, Korea, Germany, Japan and we are well covered with the 2.5 million here.     Even better is the simple fact that there is not any country that has an Air Force or Navy that can reach here and be resupplied fast enough to not be wiped out by the NRA. If they hit Texas they are in for real trouble.    That is the long version of "we are perfectly safe" from large scale invasion. The Guard would be mobilized long before they got close. The Navy and Air Force would be on them like stink on cow pie.

Two of the 3 basic purposes of government are to defend it's citizens from external attacks and to resolve internal matters in it's courts.  So, no our Army should defend us, if a foreign attack was possible.  Our current military strength guarantees that a strike could not possibly happen in America without the government's knowledge and assistance.      That's like saying a commercial jet could crash into the military command center of the United States(The Pentagon) with 2 hours notice.  What would we do against MIGs?  Not to mention the 4 war games being conducted on 9/11 which "enhanced" our country's ability to defend itself according to Gen. Ralph Eberhart and Gen. Richard Myers, who was promoted for his excellent work defending America that day.|`|SkWzsnuxaa	There could be no "surprise" invasion of the United States that would warrant the National Guard being called up and deployed. But I could foresee a situation where Mexico begins troop buildup on the border and the Texas National Guard would respond to this by massing along the border. However, we could actually deploy units from active Army units faster. But take it to the extreme and say the Martians invaded.The President would federalize all national guard troops and the National Command Authority would be in charge of all troops active and national guard in the country. Certain National Guard units have missions that require them to have equipment and training that allows them to round out active Army units. These would work very well together.

Defense Act of 21 March 1935  Section II states the provisions on compulsory military service:  It lasts from the age of 18 up to the completion of the 45th, in East Prussia of the 55th year.      .....my (German) grandfather was a blacksmith, so they took him with the cavalry to the eastern front, where he became a POW.  Since we was able to do metalworks, he was allowed/forced to work. A Russian Jew helped him, by buying metal rings for bread from him.... (Maybe a different twist than "Schindler's List" all over again.) ...once he was back in Germany (after the war) he didn't want to go back to the (Western German) army, even though it meant that he wouldn't get any pension from the army (Some months of service were missing and the POW time somehow didn't count, if I understood it correctly.)

If America were losing the war on terror & we had planes crashing into our cities every day, and people in towns on the Mexican border were being murdered. Would we surrender? Or start conscripting boys?    I know you guys will Thumbs Down me, but I must point out the injustices you are justifying. Click on the link, & tell me the Germans could simply surrender to such monsters.    Would we surrender to an enemy who vowed to destroy our nation afterward? To reduce us to mere peasants slaving for our occupiers?    Yes the Nazis committed heinous acts. But We did as well and worse, we hide behind "democracy" so that no one can see the blood of children on or hands.    And worse, we betrayed Eastern Europe to Stalin, history's worst monster. Do you realize it was Soviet policy to rape almost every female in a village? Even their OWN WOMEN, freed from Nazi Death Camps were violateed to death, or until they killed themselves. In one incident, when Jewiosh women were being raped, a German told  the soldiers what the Nazis put them through, that they were Hitler's victims.    The Russian's response? "Frau ist Frau"    All that mattered was that they were women to be raped.    Don't pretend that the Nazis were the worst war criminals. In comparison to the Soviets, Hitler was a Saint! Holocaust? 6 million killed in 6 years. Ukrainian Famine? 20 million killed in one summer!

If you plan on pursuing a career in civilian law enforcement after you get out of the military, being an MA will give you an edge. You will complete a police academy (MA A School) and you will get experience performing law enforcement and ant terrorism missions.     Once you put your time in and put some rank on you will get much better assignments and the opportunity to pursue advanced schools such as K-9, investigations, corrections, etc.    MA's are also grouped into the Navy Expeditionary Command so you may get the chance to volunteer for exciting training and deployment opportunities.    Once your time is done and you want to apply to a police department it will be a piece of cake because you will have already been there and done that. You will have an edge over your non prior service military competition and already know what you TAC officers are talking about in the academy. Plus civilian police departments look for prior military candidates when looking to hire new members.    Let me know if you have any specific questions about being an MA.|`|378161a161ce8b1460b92ef6619f0c5baa	I'm a third class MA in the US Navy.     It has its ups and downs like any other job. I like to refer to it as the best and worst job in the Navy.     I don't really know what else to tell you because your question wasn't very specific...|`|XoQTvtQUaa	im interested in this question tooo..|`|WvE7F7hWaa	Talk to a recruiter its your best bet and in the Navy they are called Master at Arms.

G49lKR56aa	Dear vollyballchick: your wrong all the way around!!    You can't say that she was pro-life! obama hardly knew his mama so I don't think he knows either!  If she was pro-choice I'll bet he's glad she didn't make the choice of death.  See what happens when you murder a baby. It hasn't the chance to grow up to be President!|`|YsQQ30YJaa	If not, he should be.|`|HGIuXxnRaa	Hahaa..this is an awesome question.     Thanks so much for asking.|`|68ee405bb00c52b1f70ed3481fd154f2aa	hmmm guess there are some people that wish Hitler's mother wasn't      **You could be killing a future president of the united states** or a madman that takes the world to the brink of war ( oh wait GWB WAS president and such a man).|`|AA10152346	Of course you'd never know that.

For all I know she could have been Pro-Accident.|`|2NjUK2kRaa	ya or else he probably wouldn't be here|`|5rQnJZ8uaa	Fortunately for obama his mother did not have access to "legal abortions" or he would probably not be here even further if she could have gotten it free we would have a different president I wonder what his childhood was like- children tend to develop their parents believes I wonder if he was told as a child that he would have been aborted if she would have had access. If Rowe v wade was in practice in 1961 thank goodness for obama it didn't happen until 1973|`|q4EXFhV7aa	His mom wasn't necessarily pro-life. In all likelihood, she was pro-choice.   You DO realize that pro-choice people have children all the time, right? Just because we want you to be able to have a choice in your reproductive rights doesn't mean that we want fetuses to be aborted. We simply don't want the government to demand that you carry a fetus.|`|3c91df9cab412a7ca4201cdaf64121e3aa	You don't know that.  She could have been pro CHOICE and chose to have a baby.

What's your point?|`|qnJRwgKvaa	I don't think America is happy that Bush's mom was pro-life!!!!|`|8iAOasaxaa	According To Obama his mother was a fool  I wish she had been as pro abortion as her son|`|up363TZyaa	He better appreciate it.  To think that he supports partial-birth abortion is absolutely PATHETIC.  see what i mean?????  why abort babies? they could become the president of the united states someday.  i'm no fan of obama, but still.|`|P5ZkSjyQaa	How do you know she is?|`|e9z5oVKPaa	Obama prefers not to acknowledge his mother.|`|b3640707e483a3b444b16b298a3378aeaa	A majority of people are pro-choice, like Obama.

pnpkJKvpaa	Eliminate the EPA restriction and I'm with you.|`|9cpKYneZaa	They need to eliminate a bunch of numnutz government agencies. The FTC for one. They sue every major and semi-major business in the country, then workers lose their jobs. They duplicate everything that state agencies and state attorneys generals do anyway. So all they do is stir up even more trouble than they're worth.    Then when they collect fines and penalties, they keep the money and the consumers hardly ever get anything.    Essentially the FTC exists for its own benefit. So just get rid of it.    Another one is the EPA. Another do-nothing organization that duplicates 50 states' worth of environmental regulation.    All they do there with the regs is fine, levy, stop work on, and interfere with more and more businesses, which only drives up the cost of domestic goods, thus exporting our pollution to the 3rd world and ticking them off at us. And when we demand THEY stop polluting, they get angry at us for loading up their country with roachy pollution to export "clean" goods to the US.    I mean the hypocrisy is so stupid, its tragic.    Then there's all the other sub-agency agencies of the US government which hamstring not only businesses but consumers with more and more meaningless and often unnecessary regulations.    I can think of nothing worse than having nothing but a huge spider web of regs and obstacles to drive the price of say GASOLINE, ELECTRICITY, HOME HEATING OIL, DIESEL and such up through the stratosphere.    And don't even get me started on construction materials.    Now the states are getting into that act. California and a half dozen other states so harshly regulate anything that might have tar or some other alleged toxin in it, of any kind, that you have to have a million warning labels, 10000 pairs of eyes and an army of "gunslinging bounty-hunting" lawyers suing businesses, property owners and tenants over some micro amount of lead in a brass door handle.    Its amazing!    How'd we get along without all of this crap prior to 1960 let's say?|`|xxDjV6Axaa	No, for the same reasons that I don't support Obama's.  Too flawed.|`|0f6a1cdae0a3ce3617b1109a091741bdaa	Although much of what you speak of are good things, I don't see them as being valuable as far as a stimulus to our faltering economy. It will not quiet the fears of those who are losing their jobs...or those that are afraid that they will be next. It would put some money back into the economy temporarily, but what about when the projects are done? Do we crash and go into another recession because most of those jobs will be lost? We need to be able to give the American people confidence in the fact that their job will continue...and we need to provide new jobs for those already out of work. In order to do that, we need to provide protection for well run businesses who are now beginning to falter because people won't spend money. Then and only then will people have enough confidence to take a chance on buying a house or a new car instead of paying off the credit cards or stockpiling their money in banks. They need to see light at the end of the tunnel...and that can only be done if businesses that once were thriving on main street USA are kept viable. To heck with the mega banks. They got themselves into it, let them get themselves out of it. I have never seen a mainstreet kind of business pay their boss millions in bonuses when the business itself was failing. As far as I am concerned, if the money does not go to prevent more mainstreet businesses from failing, it is all pork. We can survive another year or two without the new roads...but we can not survive without jobs or without the businesses that create and maintain jobs. The big guys have always taken care of themselves. Just look at exxon as an example. They made the highest profits ever this year. It is the mainstreet businesses that are suffering.
78Xb7enMaa	The violence has continued despite the propaganda that Ireland is peaceful. The men of violence continue to 'police' the estates and mete out punishments. If anyone other than Politicians actually believe the IRA have disarmed they are naive in the extreme. We never should have negotiated with terrorists and allowed Adams and McGuiness to become 'legitimate Politicians'. Is anyone else incensed by the plans to pay families of terrorists killed in 'the troubles' an equal sum in compensation as innocent victims?|`|Nejnh1Bqaa	The article didn't mention any particular group taking responsibility for the bomb, but most people are going to assume that it was the IRA, or at least disgruntled members within the organisation.  It's hard to imagine that anyone would trust the word of the same organisation that was responsible for so much destruction and so many deaths.  They were the same people that sent death treats to Clodagh Rodgers, a citizen of Northern Ireland, because she was representing the UK in the Eurovision song contest.|`|cEFiOrX5aa	Nitpickers?

The school was Catholic in west Belfast, the bomb threats that aren't hoax's were carried out by the Real Ira and the Continuity IRA, both are the same group.  Fire bombs that turn up at schools more than likely Catholic schools are carried out by Loyalist terrorists using a cover name. the Protestant action force and the Protestant action group  And they aren't hoax's.    The RIRA and CIRA don't plant hoax bombs either and use them against soft targets as well usually members of the PSNI when they're off duty.  Is trouble going to start? it never finished in the first place.|`|mmSzmGX2aa	Probably the PIRA trying to stir shite again.

Indeed, one cannot commit treason just by speaking his mind.     "It's never been about "differing opinions.""    The hell it isnt. This is exactly what it is about. He dares to speak a different opinion than from your own, so you label that treason.     "IT'S ABOUT LIES.

This is what our Founding Fathers believed in and is the reason they sacraficed to form this great nation we still enjoy today.    I don't want Congress or President Obama to succeed to their wasteful spending, high taxation, redistribution of wealth, and anti-freedom campaigns.  I don't care who the President is, I didn't want these things under Bush, I don't want them under Obama and I won't want them under the next President.

I may not agree with Limbaugh, but I will die defending his right to state his opinion and his feelings. Pres. Obama lowered himself to the level of a street fighter by allowing Limbaugh's comments to get to him.

In order to go to OTS, you have to have a Bachelor's Degree in a Technical Field with at least a 3.2 GPA.     If you have at least 20 college credits, you can enter as an E-2.  If you have at least 45 credit hours, you can enter as an E-3.      The AF is the hardest to get into but well worth the challenge.  Also, make sure your credit is in order before you see a recruiter.  The AF does credit checks and they look for no more than 30% debt to your new income.  An E-2 brings home around $650 every two weeks and an E-3 brings home around $750 every two weeks.  That's after taxes, your GI Bill, life insurance and so forth.|`|a19b1f4db1d77cea5f81a0935b914989aa	As far as "going straight to OCS":  if you do not have that in writing before you sign up, it WILL NOT happen.

Man, there's alot of misguided individuals on this site.|`|AA10470367	In politics, the liberals appeal to many because they give false hope of success through charity ( spread the wealth). Certainly could sound great to receive support while producing nothing. The only problem is the pittance they receive is only guaranteed to keep them in poverty. I am not sure why many of the wealthy liberals believe the poor simply can't make it on their own. It does show a major disconnect between their ivory tower beliefs and reality. The more they try to give a satisfactory level of living the more they fail. As I said, they only ensure poverty. It has always seemed like just common sense that people need to feel good about them self and what they are able to accomplish. We learned in early childhood that simply giving someone something never created an attitude of self satisfaction. It only produces a mind set of Give Me More.|`|whE5OQ26aa	It's better for business if wealth is distributed more equally. Depressions like this happen when the wealthy hoard money by outsourcing jobs and cutting back on business expenses, coupled with tax cuts on themselves.    It doesn't have to be outright communism or stifling socialism, but it's the government's job to regulate the economy, to prevent stagnation from occurring. If the wealthy wanted to outsource jobs like they were doing, they should have paid more in taxes. Then the government could use that money to provide more jobs and get things done. Socialism doesn't always mean people have to sit on the couch unemployed.    Do the math. Most Republicans aren't. That's why they're cheering for free-market capitalism and seeing the economy continue to crash.|`|m1q0vb6waa	No. They are not envious of others wealth per say. They are more at ends as how people who do different jobs do not get paid the same. Enters in communism. They so bad want others who have worked hard to get were there at to be as well off as others. In other words to make them feel better by having more or others having the same as them. What they do not get is the "sharing of wealth" means if your rich your not going to keep what you have.

MEReSvZeaa	I've known a lot of people who went through nuke school there, and I've know a few who failed out.    I was an ET by choice, and there were a lot of people in my schools who were NOT ET's by choice (they were nuke drop-outs).    All of them said the same thing:    You have to be detail-oriented (to a fault) and you have to follow the rules to the letter.  The discipline is absolutely necessary if you're going to maintain nuclear reactors on station, and they'll do anything they can to weed out the idiots.    Don't take it personally.  Being an ET is far better than being a nuke.  Do your best and try to pass.  But if for some reason you don't make it, just ask to keep your 6-year program and transfer to Great Lakes to be an ET or FC.  Advancement is about the same as that of a nuke in that you can make E-6 by the end of your first enlistment.    By all means, don't screw up your security clearance.
FpioJ7F5aa	She said she would arrest criminal illegal aliens.  That is a pretty stupid idea because the illegal aliens, and particularly the ones who have been here any time, have been using fake I.D.s, and committed a pretty ugly felony right there.  They are criminals right there, but she meant something much different.  And what she meant was... there are crime illegal aliens commit that they will be forgive for.  You and I will go to jail.. they will be forgiven.|`|h6c0qGwaaa	I think strongly that you have mixed yourself up.    Do you think Napolitano can do the job so it's fair?  What do U think of this Latino groups to Napolitano: Stop immigration raids -can yoU believe this ?  A coalition of Latino groups sent a letter to Homeland Security Secretary Janet Napolitano this week urging her to stop workplace immigration raids.    The coalition  which includes the League of United Latin American Citizens and the Mexican-American Legal Defense and Educational Funds  said the raids were a relentless attack on the Latino community.    The fear of raids in and around schools, neighborhoods and workplaces among immigrants  unauthorized and authorized  keeps our children and families from attending schools, obtaining needed services for which they are eligible and pay taxes and even contacting local police when they or their loved ones are in danger, the letter said.    It also said that the raids have destroyed families and spread terror.    The Bush administration conducted a string of large immigration raids at workplaces over the past few years.

The fact is, there are several million of acres of leases already granted to the oil companies, but they are not drilling. They believe oil extraction would be too expensive in some areas. In other areas, they've drilled the wells, but won't pump the oil until the price of oil goes way up.    So the issue you will likely be asked is - if you've already got several million acres of land that you are not using, why should you be granted more leases?|`|pnpkJKvpaa	More drilling for oil just feeds our addiction to oil.

The companies that drill for oil are in business ( they do it to turn a profit) and it makes good business sence to not drill at a loss.

US oil is sold to us at world market prices so the only effect it will have on the price of gas is by increasing the world supply and OPEC is likely to cut back  their production to balance the additional amount we produce so it will have no effect on the price of gas.

You should have reported her as soon as you found out she was doing it, not waited until she "made you" participate.  You were not coerced into participating, you chose to in exchange for a ride.  She payed you to commit a crime essentially.  You are just as culpable as her in the crimes and you should both be turned in to the authorities.  If you go to the police, you will probably be charged too, depending on how many times you have done it.  Now if you have only done it once or twice, you can say you didn't know that the clothes were not the correct returns, but this will only work if you turn her in IMMEDIATELY and tell the police that you had taken an unwilling part in her enterprises.  You confronted her about it, and she threatened to steal from you and end your transportation so because of the threat you came to the police.  If you have done this 4 or 5 times, tough luck.

The difficulty is perspective.  It is a religion that follows the Christian God.  But Jesus is a prophet to them not God's son.  The problem there is that the faith speaks of eliminating the infidel (anyone not Muslim).  It is a very repressive faith and is not tolerant.  But I think most muslims are peaceful people but it has the potential to really stir things up when people with radical or extreme ideas get involved.  There is a lot of anger there and little tolerance.|`|9nQ39d4Iaa	Islam is a very dangerous organization.  They will kill you where you stand.  Your lists are very correct and you are not crazy.

When people behave like rabid dogs, they tend to rule the people like rabid dogs.   Saddam shot construction workers for not working fast enough to finish his Victory Over America palace, ancient Egyptian pharoahs kept an equally large staff of guards to stand over slaves.

h6c0qGwaaa	Yes they did write a letter, of which you choose to use a single descriptive paragraph of "relentless attack" to support your questioning of if Homeland Security Secretary Janet Napolitano  is doing a fair job.    I did try both of your blog links and neither worked for me. But I did find a copy of this letter posted on another blog and am happy to share the link.   http://www.longislandwins.com/blog/in_th...  This is a rather long letter and I suspect that maybe one to none of the opposing posters will even bother to read, I see postings with self opinions,stereotypical comments, straight out insulting and out right lying from supporters as well as the opposition doing this.  Taking the time to read and reason the other sides views and thoughts are a part of solving not just this but almost any problem. Using just a tad of common courtesy is a simple and honest act it does not matter if you know the other person or not.     From the copy of the letter to what is used in part shows many different reasons and situations for the letter being written.  Such as in your post there is not a single mention that legal(ized) American citizens are being caught up in these raids. Being caught up in a raid means that you are treated as the illegals that is to say "without rights" until they pronounced you "American" until then you are just as illegal as those around you - right or wrong.  http://www.usatoday.com/news/nation/2007...  Also this coalition is made up of eight agencies not just the two that you list. I believe independently they are;  Hispanic Federation, League of United Latin American Citizens,  Mexican American Legal Defense and Educational Fund,  Mexican American Political Association,  National Alliance of Latin American and Caribbean Communities,  National Day Laborer Organizing Network and the  National Hispanic Environmental Council, Southwest Voter Registration Education Project.    Posters will write many comments, answers will be of different opinions yet it can not be argued that as equals the people and the government of the people have failed. We have set standards for the rich and another for the poor. Standards for whites and another for blacks, there are two sets of laws one being reachable only with a lawyer and the other for those with public pretenders.   My biggest sadness is that one day we will all be gone and those that live on have only what we have said and done to draw interaction with others from, read some of the answers again and tell me please that I am wrong.|`|FpioJ7F5aa	No.  She said ... show her a fifty foot fence, and she would show you an illegal aliens with a fifty one foot ladder.  In fact, two journalists actually wanted to find someone who could build the ladder.. spent days and days in Mexico, and could not find anyone who could build such a ladder.  In addition... no one has jumped off the top and landed on the other side without requiring medical attention for broken bones.  Napolitano was very, very wrong.  Add this: the fence has been an excellent sucess.  It is working well as we speak.    Napolitano is going to be a very ugly thorn in our side.

Republicans tried (and sometimes passed) every civil rights bill ever introduced in Congress.    There are so few racist republicans that it's amazing anyone believes the idiotic attempts of democrats to smear them.|`|xxDjV6Axaa	Neither was forcing the natives off of their land so we could live here.  That's not much of a legacy but it was our country was founded on.  And in relation to the rest of the world, we have not had as much oppression as some countries.    BTW, England had white slavery until the late 1800s and early 1900s.  It was one of the functions of the Salvation Army to put a stop to it there.|`|htMOl3c4aa	Yes, the US is the worst when it comes to racism and it's due to uneducated people which results from the bad school system that the America has in place. But I think it will continue to get better as more plans are developed such as the "No Child Left Behind" act and others.|`|wppUvy4maa	By 2012 Obama will be Americas worst legacy.|`|ayhDyb16aa	Well racism still exsists in this country as some people use it as a crutch to either make excuses or to get their way.|`|A6Xjzhdaaa	yes|`|lpwcqkNbaa	Yes of course|`|CgGVpUI5aa	Is our best legacy building the most diverse and racially tolerant society on earth?      Take your cliche anti-Americanism somewhere else.|`|5934b4ac2c8b2f469b3de84858dc0d56aa	No, racism isn't any worse in the US than it is in any other country in the world.  Check out other countries and see how their minorities fare before you run around making statements like this.  Segregation and even slavery still exist in many places.  This is the most free and just country in the world.|`|qnJRwgKvaa	I disagree.  I believe that America's worse sin was slavery.  Racism was just an effect of this crime!!!!   Slavery will always be the black eye of America!!!!|`|tDZMJue9aa	so thats it, a country cant change? i didnt do that because one i wasnt alive in the that time, but i shouldnt be blamed for what anyone of that time did do because im white, i think that if everyone including people of races other than white get off the racism kick at this moment it would get better, before obama it wasnt so shoved down my throat i either got a long with you as a person because i liked you or i didnt..had nothing to do with your skin color...and it still doesnt, but some people seem to be really small minded right now and think all republicans are racist which is simply not true. and we are the land of the free until obama takes our free speech including talk radio away from us, that day is coming and its going to be a sad day for america...you may not agree and if you dont by all means change the channel thats what i do when something is on tve and i dont like it or i dont agree with it, i sure dont complain about it....|`|AA10460376	Sometimes it's very hard to talk about it especially when you have been a victim of racism and it's ugliness.  To bring it up only aids in keeping the hurt and bitterness breeding and festering in one's soul, causing all kind of unwanted sicknesses. So, it is all around us but we learn to accept the fact that it is very prominent in today's society and our only hope is to pray that in time, this too will be non-existent......|`|7ZJHBKk9aa	Slavery was and still is, where slavery is still practiced, a horrible thing. And yes, I did say there is still out right slavery in some parts of the world. America was in no way alone in participating in the act of slavery. It was common practice all over the world from the beginning of time. Romans owned European, African, Jewish, and Middle Eastern slaves for hundreds of years. Many Europeans came to America as indentured servants, slaves in all but name. The difference between America and every other country on the face of the Earth is that with in the Declaration of Independence was the seed of freedom for all people. when in the course of human events it becomes necessary for a people to advance from that subordination in which they have hitherto remained, and to assume among the powers of the earth the equal and independent station to which the laws of nature and of natures god entitle them original draft of the Declaration of Independence. It is true that this was changed to keep slave owners happy but, it shows that the issue was far from settled in America. The founders knew that if the states where fighting each other over slavery they would be no match for England. To wait until slavery was resolved to declare independence was to wait indefinitely.  Of course slavery was not ended in America until one half the nation fought the other to end it. Hundreds of thousands of Americans gave their lives to end slavery.  Did slavery end peacefully in other countries because of the blood shed in America? I do not know but it would be a fitting tribute if it where true.|`|ioCiw5zlaa	Agreed. Racism was and is the root cause of numerous atrocities both here and abroad.    England banned their slave trade in the late 1700s or early 1800s|`|a2rjzPYZaa	No. If it wasn't for America, slavery would still exist.|`|5yLqsD4faa	americans aren't the only racist people

I think it has become scary because it is so much money so fast and little return has been seen so far.  obama will spend on American workers (I love a good laugh)?  I'm sure many of us will benefit from the huge chunk of money he intends to give to ACORN.  At least Bush tried to invest in our security and future.|`|GmW5mUrpaa	You got it sister!  WELL SAID.......................................|`|C2HHfun2aa	Why is it that all of a sudden Democrats aren't bothered by the deficit?    They whined about billion dollar deficits during Regan, Bush I and Bush II and how bad they are and that they had to be stopped immediately. Now they have no problem with "trillion deficits for as far as the eye can see".    Oh that's right because Democrats are the biggest hypocrits on the planet!|`|N6puMZ7Uaa	I really don't think you have any idea how big the deficit will be if Obama and the Dems have their way. You could spend a million dollars every day since Christ was born and it would NOT be enough to pay-off the NEW deficit. Everyone (especial the american worker) will have an additional 30% of their pay go to pay taxes.|`|MEReSvZeaa	Most republicans were bothered by the republican spending in the first Bush term.    Having said that, the Bush tax cuts CREATED a much larger federal revenue by 25%.  Bush brought in money to cover the spending.    Democrats don't know how to do that without raising taxes.
6OLiuM9Gaa	People join the military.    The military, as most people who've gotten through the second or third grade and who have a positive IQ know, is the enforcement arm of US foreign policy.    When they watch their Rambo movies, or play with their GI Joe dolls, they might note that these guys carry weapons.    If that's not enough, they take an oath to protect the Constitution of the US against all enemies... hello?    Ok, they've missed that. But, when they go through Boot Camp, they should note some of the stuff they're trained to do...like fire rifles and pistols, to march, to run, to swim, to climb. Now how often does a librarian, or a secretary need to do any of that? One would think they would realize they're being trained for combat.    Ok, so, as you've pointed out, they volunteered for the military. They presumably understood what the military was about. It would seem that they would, had they at least a modicum of intellect, have figured out that (1) the military is trained for combat, (2) that, being trained for combat, some might likely go to combat, (3) that in combat some people die, (4) there's no guarantee that they wouldn't be one of those that died, and (5) nobody can wish away reality.    Now, with all that in mind, I, as do you, cannot understand their ire at having to do what they were trained to do, and knew from the outset they might have to do.    Some say they're in it for the benefits. Do those people really think that's all the military does... pass out benefits?     From the instant one is born in this country, they can do pretty much what they want, when they want, and how they want. They can pretty much go to any school they want. They can study pretty much whatever they want. They can drive pretty much wherever they want. They can fly pretty much wherever they want. They can read pretty much whatever they want. They can say pretty much whatever they want. They can worship pretty much any way they want... or not at all if that's what they want. It's not like the country has never given them anything. But, when the country says, "Pardon me, but here's your bill," they freak out.    Now these same people go to McDonald's and order fries and a soft drink. The fries will make them fat and shorten their life span. The soft drink will help pay for their dentist's vacation. And, for this they gladly pay two or three bucks.     But McDonald's is smart. They make you pay the bill BEFORE you get the goodies. Maybe the US should do that. Everybody is born into servitude. When they turn 18, the government says, want out of servitude? Want freedom? Here's the deal. Six years of your life in the military. After those six years, if you do your job well, you'll be entitled to tuition assistance, low-interest loans. If you don't do your job well, at least your share of the bill will be paid. If you stay in 20 or more years, you'll get a whole bunch of benefits... to some of which your spouse and children might be entitled.    Pay while you're in the service? Well, sure, there will be some compensation. You will have some expenses, but the pay won't be all that much... certainly nothing like you could make outside the military. But the military does supply you with pretty much everything you actually need. And it will pay a little for the maintenance of your wife and children... if you're married. But it's you that's supposed to be paying the bill. McDonald's hardly pays you to patronize them.    People have said that freedom isn't free. But, to most, those are just words. Hardly any of them know what the bill is. It's spelled out in the last few words of the Declaration of Independence. "... we pledge to each other our lives, our fortunes, and our sacred honor." You want to earn your freedom? That's what it's going to cost you. The bill will never be paid in full, and each generation is responsible for their own installment.    These are the times that try men's souls. The summer soldier and the sunshine patriot will, in this crisis, shrink from the service of their country; but he that stands it now, deserves the love and thanks of man and woman. Tyranny, like hell, is not easily conquered; yet we have this consolation with us, that the harder the conflict, the more glorious the triumph. What we obtain too cheap, we esteem too lightly. (Thomas Paine)    Special attention to the last sentence... "What we obtain too cheap, we esteem too lightly."    When I was in Boot Camp in 1960, somebody asked me, "Do you want to die for your country?" I remember the question as if it were asked just yesterday. It changed my life. I don't remember the answer I gave verbatim, but it was something like, "I joined the Navy to serve my country, and if, in that service, I have to give my life, I'm ready to do so. But dying isn't the first thing on my list of things to do right after lunch." I think General Patton said it better. I'll clean it up a little, but it goes something like, "Nobody ever won a war by dying for his country. He won it by making sure the other guy died for his." I don't have a death wish, but I certainly have no fear of death. That mindset gives one a tremendous tactical advantage. Maybe each recruit needs to be asked that question... or maybe ask it of himself or herself.    "... we pledge to each other our lives, our fortunes, and our sacred honor."|`|LYnCH5LNaa	being over there, time and money has no meaning and value.  life stops and somehow you are still living it. i loved it.|`|J6OIYcIiaa	Plenty of people hate their jobs and complain about it.  Or they hate their marriage and complain about it.  Its good at the start, but even the things you love get old after a while.  Im sure many of them enjoyed being in the military for a while.   But after being stuck in an arid dessert, missing your family and friends, and getting shot at, yeah i can see why they dont want to be in Iraq or Afghanistan.  Our soldiers aare just humans.|`|PBq7ODPzaa	You know, I can't recall ever seeing something like that on TV.  I'm sure there were people that feel that way but never saw it on the tube.  And those people represent a minority in the military.    As for why someone in the military would want to go?  That's easy, let's say you are an athlete and you train and train.  You train your body, your mind, push yourself to be the best at what you do but you never get to compete.  Never get put in "The Game".  Some of us want to go over to see if we really have it, have what it takes to be what we have trained to be.    Also there are those of us that really want to go to Afghanistan to get at Al Quede and the Taliban for 9/11.|`|AA10025824	Not all of them expected to have to be deployed.  There's a lot of people who join with no intention of ending up in combat.    But even the ones that volunteered don't necessarily have to be happy about it.  They're scared, away from home and their families, and in the worst possible situation most of them will ever be in.      So if they complain, or sound like they're complaining, I'd say that's okay. But they're still doing the job they volunteered for.|`|5B5pirFWaa	If you had any job you may beable to understand, since you would know how it would feel to have a boss tell you to do something you did not like. But since you are probably in HS, it is like having your Dean/Teacher whoever telling you to do something you do not want to do, but know you already knew you were going to do and having no choice is not doing it.|`|1vCoaf08aa	Within our military are excellent, fine people, but, sadly, there are a select few who just LOVE to fight, these are the people who should stay there.    They just like to bully up on people, I suppose.|`|AA11707728	Belonging to the military does not mean signing yourself into slavery to die at the whim of some sick **** in government.  The president and congress have a responsibility to make sure their deployment is honorable, appropriate and serves the interests of their country.  A soldier's duty is to the country.  But our leader's duty is to our soldiers.  They do their part but there is some serious question as to if our elected officials are doing theirs.    That being said.  The democrats have made VERY serious preparations for a draft this summer.  The bill has been proposed and support has been gathered to push it through.  Obama has already said he will sign it into law.  And that law specifically disallows college students from opting out.    There are a large number of 18 to 20 year olds that are going to afghanistan this summer....whether they want to or not.|`|DFwNXmDBaa	Hey man, you have to understand some of them were brought up in poor families and its the only way to get an education and etc.|`|LLnNjH94aa	I'm sure that buyers remorse sometimes strikes.  If they are over there fighting though I really don't care what they say.  Their actions speak louder than words.|`|38J8nzhBaa	Yes, they signed up.  BUT the army poster probably didn't say: "Your chance to die in some desert! Join today"    The army also offers the potential to learn and grow. Sometimes it's the only employer left. There are also people who want to serve THEIR country.    ...but once you're in, some politicians decide your fate...  And I guess that's not always what you hoped for!|`|gz5O9Tbpaa	Well, it just might suck to be in the desert away from your home and everyone you love, dont ya think? And just because you are in the military doesn't mean you have to agree with every decision the presidentt makes. But I can say, you would NEVER see a serviceman on television talking about bush when he was the president. That's just not allowed in the army. He was the comander in chief, they couldnt say anything bad about him or his decisions.     I dont think saying those two things means they are complaining about being in the military. Do you always love your job? You get up ready to go to work and deal with all the crap thrown at you? You arent able to see your family or walk around without your gear on EVERYDAY?!?    I personally think they should be able to complain all they want. I complain about my job on a regular basis, and I love my job!|`|84pz6eIVaa	When you join the Armed Forces, you have a choice- you can choose your job, or you can choose your destination. But not both. When I joined, I chose my job (supply specialist). I was fully aware that I might get sent into harms way, but was also pretty sure I wouldn't be on the front-line with my job (bringing in supplies).    90% of the guys that join actually want to go to Iraq or Afghanistan. The other 10% or so hope they don't go. Those who picked their job, and chose tank operator, or infantry, or any fighting job, fully expects to go into war, and looks forward to it.    Others pick their location instead of their job, then they know for a fact, if they pick Italy for example, they will never see Iraq.    Some guys picked a job that they thought would keep them out of the fighting but were surprised to find out that they are closer to the action than they thought. Surprise! But many get out of their job by simply asking their superior officers for a new MOS or a leave of absence. It's easy to get out if they really want to.    But hey, let them vent a little frustration. War is tough.|`|Qbf4KSRUaa	Complaining is a part of being in the military. The people over there have earned the right to complain about being away from family. Heck, I complained when I served in peacetime and was stationed on the beach.|`|rxMHRbTzaa	I agree with you. When members of our all volunteer military complain about having to serve it makes us all look bad. I have been in the military for 18 years and still serving. Yes, sometimes I complain about things in private to fellow soldiers or family. Thats just venting stress but to complain to the media when you know your complaints will be broadcast all over the world is wrong.

All they need is a few Republicans on there to share the blame.....ok, let's be honest here...ALL of the blame which is what liberals do.    Just look at George Bush. Yes, one man did all of it despite the Democrats having the majority. See how they do it?     Obama promised "no pork spending". He also promised to go "line by line" in the budget and get rid of unnecessary spending. Did he go line by line through the budget before proposing this bill? Hell no.    Nancy "stretch" Pelosi and Barack "millhouse" Obama are trying to ruin this country. This bill is FULL OF PORK....just look at it. Spending money on the arts, new sod at the national mall and condoms to stimulate the economy? What the hell is that?

Let personal contributions and preset trust funds support it. It does not put people back in their homes, pay bills, let alone give them a job. Cut the taxes for a year or so and let the American people stabilize and have financial mobility. 500.00 dollars is not enough money to feed an average family for half a month. Be a shame to go deeper into debt and have our children suffer for the presidents poor choice.|`|1amF7oNwaa	When the Democrat's stimulus plan fails of course they will blame the Republicans but the Republicans refusing to sign on it will make it harder for the Democrats to convince the American people they are right.|`|B6c7BeDnaa	this bill will always be a democrats no matter how they try to spin it.|`|cc3820a15b7c09ec25ef5a6c571f58b7aa	so that when it fails he has someone to blame|`|rWdYBmPmaa	As you said, this way he can say the Republicans voted for it also.

jeHTjvbaaa	Yes, they make Army life look like a fun vacation or something... Oh hey! Come join us and jump out of planes for the week end! There is no chance you will die or anything!... Kinda like the Marine recruiter who told me I would travel the work and make great friends and see amazing things if I enlisted... too bad I have a buddy in Iraq right now.  But hey, I guess if they did tell the truth of war, a lot less would join.    Edit: To the "Army of One" stickers... I have never seen them in Spanish but yes, that is a little ironic..|`|yCdcF3Jcaa	The make you feel patriotic, as is the goal.|`|3iL7V04waa	It makes me feel proud to be a part of it, but I don't think it's an effective way to gain the interest of potential recruits.  They are too long to grab the interest of people.  I liked the 3 Doors Down commercial...I bought the song after seeing it!  However they seem to target present soldiers instead of future ones.  I like the fact that they incorporate the Warrior Ethos, however they won't mean anything to civilians.|`|r6zLN0Daaa	no way the commercials are dumb and show you the real army just what they want you to see|`|SkWzsnuxaa	I have liked all the Army commercials with the exception of the first "Army of One" commercial. Perhaps no one noticed that the soldier was running one direction while all the combat vehicles were going the other way. Was he lost? And I thought it was a stupid slogan.    But what is wrong with the celebrities singing in the commercials? I don't know which you are speaking of, but some of our biggest supporters are country/western singers.|`|cEFiOrX5aa	I think the U.S. armed forces should just go back to the posters and billboards like the old days. It'd be less annoying...    And the "Army of One" stickers written in Spanish really piss me the hell off....|`|Cwex6straa	Pfft, if those commercials actually showed what the army is really like, no one would join.|`|BMbrcABWaa	When they use propaganda like celebs it's to get you to do something you wouldn't otherwise do.

IAmnOIhvaa	?    You must be kidding !?    But then again, 5 past governors in serious legal trouble would have to say something of the stance on ethics in the state of Illinois.    This must stop.|`|1219d6000cca01c9f3c4489d1c7b4a16aa	I listened to part of the impeachment hearings, and I didn't see any example of the more sensational charges surrounding his supposed pay-to-play scheme for Obama's Senate seat.  He does seem like a dirtbag, and part of the recordings demonstrated some pay-to-play, but his associates were very clever not to be specific about things.    It seems fishy to me too, and rushed.  But in Illinois, they can impeach for any reason, it doesn't have to be a crime.  The special prosecutor asked for more time for the indictment, which is rare, some have speculated his case is not as strong as he might like.  They might have rushed to impeach because if he were indicted and acquitted, it would be hard to make a case for his impeachment.|`|bb5a54df57374dc4de372500ff862a7daa	Me thinks you are right.    As a Chicago suburb resident, I KNOW they are all dirty and I KNOW that the ties that Blago has with a few select, if suspicion is correct, can turn pretty darn ugly.    I am waiting to see with anticipation that something is certainly gonna hit the fan.    Even if Blago is guilty of some things, and listening to the hearing, I believe he was not guilty of some as well, but even if he is, he is not alone and had some help from a few "select" others.    Have lived in the area all my life, I know how Chicago Politics goes, and these things against Blago have NOT been the worse thing to happen here.  Why are others getting a pass?  Hopefully, not for long.

You find them in all court buildings and government offices, plus on the shoulders of military personnel and police officers. It symbolizes military aka maritime jurisdiction as opposed to common law jurisdiction. It means all these venues and people operate under military law. Or put another way, they presume you guilty until proven innocent.

If you've done everything else and signed into delayed entry, the recruiter has the dates off all the recruit battalion companies and when they start there training.  Just ask them.

BImIMnbzaa	Here's the drill:  First and foremost, you need to finish college.  If med school is your absolute objective, than you want a pre-med undergraduate degree.  Once ready, see a navy or army recruiter for officers.  Announce your intention of joining up but going to med school.  If all is good to go at that point, you need to apply to med school, a civilian med school.  Once accepted, the branch of service you have joined will release you conditionally for med school.  They will pay for med school and give you a stipend to live on while in school.    When you are not in school, like summer breaks, you will be required to serve in your military capacity.  Once graduated, you will return to duty to serve your internship or residency as a military doctor, plus you will owe the military six years of service.    If college is not an option but you still hanker for a medical career, think about navy corpsman school or army medic.  This is the equivalent to a two year associates training.  You will serve in a number of capacities, from working in combat units in war zones, to hospital work delivering babies of dependents.  It is also practical medical training in civilian life.|`|9rhmeb7raa	There is a school which trains military physicians. You have to complete your four years of pre-med studies first.|`|yR75rXThaa	You attend a regular college on military scholarship, then you enter the service of your choosing after you graduate. On top of the scholarship, the Army will pay you over $1900 a month as a stipend. On top of that, you get a $20,000 signing bonus.    You will owe one year of military service for every year of school the scholarship pays for.    Check out the Army's Health Professions Scholarship website for more information and contact numbers.  http://www.goarmy.com/amedd/hpsp.jsp

It's an internal mindset that doesn't look out at the world but sets all values ones own belief of what the world is.

c4c96e87c5e65ad49a7ec667dfb9d974aa	Make up a nonsensical argument for the opposition.  Insult them for it (in the form of a largely rhetorical question).  Then give the best answer award to the person who agrees with you the most vigorously.    For example:  "Why do all (insert derogatory name for members of other party here) hate kittens and want to destroy America?  How could anyone vote for (derogatory name of current political figure in opposing party)?"    Then sit back and wait for the eager responses.  Ignore the long, well-considered and even-handed ones that come later.  They don't count.  Give the award to the person who uses the most exclamation points.|`|iOqmoIrcaa	How about you be an adult and promote the one you support?

LYnCH5LNaa	i like the way you think.|`|zWU2skZTaa	It's not that easy to just "nuke" a country. Using nuclear weapons on any country would spark international condemnation as well as setting off a flash-point and potentially providing a causus belli for other nations (whether or not they have nuclear arms themselves). If the United States were to use nuclear weapons against Iraq, then Iran would launch missile attacks on Israel, and Israel would launch attacks on Iran in turn. India and Pakistan, seeing that countries can freely use nuclear arms will become a nuclear flashpoint and will start a major war. China would join the Indian/Pakistan conflict, either allying with a side or making it a three-way war over Kashmir. Additionally, a nuclear missile heading to Iraq would set off alarms in Russia as Iraq is near its southern "sphere of influence" and a trigger-happy Soviet Air General might just start the nuclear holocaust.|`|xwxEMWCFaa	that wasn't very nice of you to say.my fiance is in iraq now,and it is more innocent people over there than u think.are country is just trying to find bin laden and his posse hiding all over the middle east.so nuking the whole country wouldn't be fair to the innocent people now would it?plus what kind of people would that make our country look like?we have to take our troops out gradually,not all at once.that's what obama is proposing and i think it is a great idea.as we get each goal attained,less and lesser people will be deployed over there.plus the country will be in better shape each time we do it.we have to be patient and let our new president do his job,and let our military work.

They trained me in electronics for 12 months and then I troubleshot electronics on several different aircraft for 3 years.  Real easy to get jobs outside after that.

xxDjV6Axaa	BB&T must be retail lenders not wholesale lenders.  Wholesale lenders would be mortgage brokers who don't lend money, they just find banks who will.  Look at the chart on this link and you can see who does what.|`|8Qxb7OZOaa	Loan officer, mortgage broker, loan originator are the same person....people just use different titles.    Mortgage companies do not fund the loans....they act as the 10cent middlemen out to get as much money out of you as they can. They have to send your loan application(with all the necessary paperwork) to banks or finance companies who will approve you for a the loan.     1. Usually....maybe its could be a new type of loan, they probably did use it but your forgetting.  2. Nope...usually they are lazy about calling especially after the papers are signed....This is why its best to get loans from a local Bank....you can call their supervisors who will make them return calls.  At 10cent brokerage firms even Wells Fargo/Wash mutual you have riff raff working for them....they just hire someone who can sell.   3.It sounds like a balloon payment type of loan...if you have saving and plan on paying it off right away great...otherwise you have to refinance or go into forclosure. I personally think its a stupid loan unless you are rich or are buying cheap property.  4. Refinancing will be your only option if you can't payoff the last(balloon) payment. Again, this is why its best not to do this type of loan.  Mtg. brokers know you will have to refinance which means more money in their pockets.    Your post is a little off.  It doesn't matter if he jotted your info down on the wall as long as the application were filled out properly later.      I guess your needing to refinance that is why you're calling him?    If so you don't need him to do so....go to a local bank and ask to speak to someone in the loan dept about refinancing your home.  If you can't qualify with them(credit/income problems)....then go to another brokerage company that has been in business more than 15-20 yrs in a nice area of town.       I used to be in the business and know how criminal minded and useless they can be.     Get a 30 yr. fixed rate loan...you can pay it off early if you want.  This is what you should have been placed in from the get go.|`|tY4hOjqdaa	Banks don't use 1003's, only Mortgage Brokers/Lenders. It seems you have a 5 yr balloon loan. It will be due in five years. You may be able to refi and get a better rate in the current marketplace. You need to check your area for the limits on FNMA or FHA loans.

gz5O9Tbpaa	In my experience, it's NEVER taken that long! It takes about 8 days for a letter to get downrange, and about 10 days for one to get back. Sometimes it's quicker than that.     I was told to send my Christmas packages early so they would get there in time, because it took like 6 weeks for them to get there because of the amount of packages being sent. So I sent my packages in November... and were there by the 10th of December!!|`|AA12215630	My husband has been deployed 3 times to Iraq and even did a tour in Korea and it has never taken that long to get a letter or package to him. The longest it has taken was 3 weeks and that was around Christmas time. Not sure how you are sending it but that is an awful long time to get mail there.|`|64b71311b453645560ceb49d58250d08aa	first everything you mail from the states has to go to a military mail processing center, i believe one is in NYC the other is in California somewhere, where it all gets sorted out. from there it gets sent to one of the central processing centers for each of the general areas, I.E. Europe/Africa, Middle East, Asia. from there it gets shipped out to individual units, but only when they have aircraft space. mail getting back to the US should usually be a little faster.|`|yR75rXThaa	Priorities.    There are only so many flights from the US to Kuwait, then only so many from Kuwait to major locations in Iraq and Afghanistan, then once the mail gets to the major distribution centers, it has to wait for another plane ride to a smaller site. From there it's by truck or helicopter to even smaller places until the soldier gets the letter. Lather, rinse, and repeat in reverse.    To complicate this, mail has a relatively low priority. There are only so many aircraft, and many needs. They bumped my original flight back home because they needed the airplane for an urgent medical evacuation. That happens all the time, and things get rescheduled.     Often, mail gets carried just when there's room. When I flew (UH-60 pilot) troops point to point in Afghanistan, we'd often toss bags of mail in the back to take to the smaller locations. If there's room, great, we'll take it. If not, the soldier and his equipment take the priority and the mail has to wait for the next flight.|`|m6C3pgChaa	My husband says it takes about a week for him to get a letter from us and 2-3 to send one back.  You don't say where you are sending them to/from but I'm assuming Iraq or Afghanistan.|`|c249b89257333b190191abe2702d0e30aa	The military mail system is where it gets bogged down. Once a letter or package is in the USPS system it speeds up. Imagaine where that letter has to go and how it gets there in the military mail system.    Lets say someone sends a letter from a FOB in Iraq. That letter gets put on a truck and is sent by convoy to a major base like Camp Liberty. From there its put on a plane from Baghdad (BIAP) and goes to Kuwait. From Kuwait it goes to Germany and from Germany to the states. Once in the states it goes to the USPS in New York.    This is also why USPS insurance doesnt cover the package once it leaves New York and is out of the USPS control.
9rhmeb7raa	If you have an attack after entry, then they will. They will also issue you a General Discharge under Honorable Conditions for a preexisting disqualifying condition.|`|JrrDtwVZaa	Nope. They would only check it if you have an attack in basic or something. If you do have an attack in basic stick to your story.    Keep a good running routine before shipping out, that will help with the asthma.|`|v0ZvjE0Iaa	They check if they have a reason, such as if they suspect you have a condition, if you are up for a security clearance or if you are seriously injured. Lying about things that no longer have an effect on you is common, however lying about asthma is a horrible idea, and the reason they threaten you with heavy fines and brig time.     Fraudulent enlistment warnings are there to keep out unfit troops, and to protect potential enlistees from their own lies, I.e. not being able to handle the harsh training. If you said you were going to lie about... say an ER visit for a bit too much to drink (not alcohol dependence, just a one night thing) or about taking medicine for poison ivy 5 years ago, then more than likely you would be fine. In your case... don't lie.

The second reason for charter change is the necessity to change from a unitary to a federal form of government, in order to solve the long-standing issue of Muslim separatism, she said.    Santiago said that in a federal system, as in the US , each state is a virtual state within a state, resulting in a system of dual sovereignty.    But we have to be extremely careful that in a federal system, the Constitution shall prohibit absolutely any right of secession. The absence of such a prohibition might cause a civil war, as it did in the US~|`|AA11133225	This is a new one!! What charter change is the Philippines proposing?

e205d688e231b13af75443c794fc1564aa	Are you male or female?    There are several issues that need to be addressed:    1.  You cannot in any way, shape or form enter the Active Duty AF with only a GED.  You must have 15 college credit hours to be considered.  I do mean, considered.  If it comes down to a GED holder with 15 credit hours and diploma holder, the diploma holder gets it.  The AF allows less than half a percent of their recruits to hold GED's. That basically boils down to a handful a year.      2.  If you are pregnant, you cannot enlist in the USAF until 6 months AFTER the birth of your child.  You cannot be DEP while pregnant.  (doesn't apply if you are male, obviously)    3.  Are you single or married?  If you are single and have a child, you can kiss all chances of enlisting the Active Duty AF goodbye.  The AF doesn't, ever, ever take single parents.  You cannot give away custody to enlist either.  It doesn't matter if you have a Family Care Plan.  No Single Parents..period.  You can try to join the Reserves but that is all.    What this boils down to is .....NO, will not be enlisting unless you get those college credit hours.  You could get a 97 on the ASVAB, it wouldn't matter a bit.  The ARMY is the only branch that accepts GED holders without college credit.|`|IUXriZQJaa	You need to get better than 85th on the ASVAB to get the recruiters to come look for you.  Yes, there are USAF recruiters.  You can find them in the phone book.  AS to the baby, are you the mom or the dad?  If you are pregnant, you are not qualified.  If you are a young mother, they want you to leave the military work to others until your child is old enough to handle your projected extended absences.

If you compare industrialized nations, however, the nationalized health care is more beneficial for the country as a whole. There are countless examples of countries that spend 40-50% less on medicine as a percentage of their GDP than the US while getting better medical service. But, even that comparison is not clear-cut. People in Europe are generally healthier for a whole host of reasons ranging from preventive medicine to healthier lifestyles. Also, if you look at all the exotic cutting edge procedures, you'd better be in the US.

dda37e592e7a473ae883df834ad9805faa	It depends on the state.  A number of states have the "Castle Doctrine"   law in place that allow you to use legally justifiable force in a number of ways and you protected from further harassment from law suits and from additional criminal charges.  But note, I said legally justifiable.    You need to look at the laws for your particular state.  In some states, you have a legal obligation to retreat if at all possible and so you could not legally confront would be robber.    There is far more to defending yourself with a firearm than just knowing how to safely handle a weapon and being able to hit a mark on a piece of paper at the range.  While I applaud those who are willing to take responsibility for their own safety, going about armed is not a step to be taken lightly.  You need to be well versed in what is legal and what is not in you state.  What's more you should have some tactical training.

I am apt to believe that it will be celebrated, by succeeding Generations, as the great anniversary Festival. It ought to be commemorated, as the Day of Deliverance by solemn Acts of Devotion to God Almighty. It ought to be solemnized with Pomp and Parade, with Shews, Games, Sports, Guns, Bells, Bonfires and Illuminations from one End of this Continent to the other from this Time forward forever more."    -   Adams, John|`|UkKGsHU3aa	American independence from Britain was formally declared on July 4 1776 with the ratification of the United States Declaration of Independence. Hence July 4 is still celebrated as American Independence Day. In 1777 the Articles of Confederation were adopted, becoming the first governing document of the USA. The Articles combined the 13 colonies of the American Revolutionary War into a loose confederation of sovereign states. The USA was recognised as an independent nation by the Treaty of Paris in 1783, which formally ended the American Revolutionary War between Britain and America. This war, also known as the American War of Independence, ran from 1775-1783. The Americans defeated the British with the assistance of France, Spain and the Netherlands.    Independence was a product of the American Revolution, an upheaval which included both the American Revolutionary War and the intellectual and social shifts towards republicanism taking place at that time, driven by the colonial struggle against political and economic policies of the British Empire. The Revolution ended British control of middle North America.

D0SB7xdsaa	no. its a dicey subject, look at the positive impact it has had on crime for instance and curbing the amount of people who would try to do dangerous things because of lack of a solid family structure to raise a child.   I believe its the womans right to choose, but she should see counsel and meet with her family on the matter, instead of doing something back alley.  The larger problem are the failed policies enacted that allow private citizens to own automatic/ and semi automatic weapon. The policies that don't constrain corporations and hold them accountable.

So, of course they are there to help prevent pregnancy.  Most women I knew growing up and in college, including me, got their birth control there.  Out of 50 girls in my class that I knew that went there, one had a baby.  That's not a high number, so PP was succeeding in their efforts to prevent pregnancy.  As for how many of these girls had abortions, I don't know, but the DID go there for birth control pills. No one WANTS to have an abortion.  Legal access is extremely important, because when it's not available legally then it's available illegally and very, very dangerous.  As for your argument about population control, that is very interesting. I DO think we live in a free enough country to be able to make those choices for ourselves though, and not have it forced on us.

Years ago, religion was the cause of many women seeking abortions. Unmarried mothers were scorned and many young women feared punishment not only from society but their own families. Morality stated that these women were sinners. Laws preventing abortions only kept those without money from getting one. Prior to the Roe vs Wade, women with money simply took a trip to Europe or South America and had the operation in a hospital or clinic. It was even used for publicity by celebrities at the time.Poorer women were forced to seek an abortion in back alleys where the procedure was often unclean and very dangerous. I believe as Jesus, let each make her own decision without interference or judgment, It is certainly not my place to come between any woman and God.

Are you aware of what YOU are supporting?|`|Tl1b2lAHaa	Okay, your really getting under my skin with this way of looking at abortion, first off, I don't want to see any child killed after it's really developed, but to have an abortion in the first 8 weeks, the child is a mucus membrane with nothing really functional on it. If a woman has a miscarriage in the first month or two, would she be evil?  Would you label her a heartless woman who didn't take care of herself enough to keep the baby?  No, you would feel sorry for her, the child wasn't developed enough to be a real loss.  Most women who have abortions, either can't deal with the seperation of having giving birth to a child and worrying that the people they gave the child they carried for 9 months are really good people. It's alot harder to bond with a child in your body for almost a year, give it to someone you don't know, than it is to let it go before you can get attached to it, carrying it around for 9 months.  The bonding process doesn't happen when you give birth, it happens at the time of conception.  As a matter of fact, I'm more of the opinion that the people who give up a child after birthing it, are a colder type of person than the people who decide the time isn't right and give the child an end before it begins, and so in turn may in the future get the same child and spirit back when they are ready to care for the child.  What if they bore the child and the people they gave it to beat it, abused it or sexually assualted it and it's life was horrible.  Was that better?   It's not your decision and you don't have to live your life wondering what happened to your child, if you gave it away.  Don't judge, it's part of the 10 commandment, Thou shalt not judge, because until you walk in the shoes of the person you are judging, you really can't know what they are going through in thier decision.  Just stop and think.

IW3jmnKbaa	First off, don't let the corporations control the government, and keep the government small, makes it easier to keep an eye on them, and don't let the government force people to give it money, make it get it's own, cause once they figure out they can get money from the people if they threaten to lock them up, it will never stop, they just want more and more, then they use that money to build jails for the ones that don't give them money.

Revelation of Swiss Bank Accounts     This is so shocking. If black money deposits were an Olympics event, India would have won a gold medal hands down.   Russia , the second best, has four times less deposit.   US does not even figure in the top five!   India has more money in Swiss banks than all the other countries combined!!!!   Recently, due to international pressure, the Swiss government agreed to disclose the names of the account holders, but only if the respective governments formally asked for it. The Indian government is not asking for the details. No marks for guessing why!   We need to start a movement to pressure the government to do so. This is perhaps the only way - and a golden opportunity - to expose the high and mighty and weed out corruption.   Please read on and forward to all honest Indians to build a ground-swell of support for action.   Is India poor? Ask Swiss banks with personal account deposit bank of $1500 billion in foreign reserve which have been misappropriated. Considering that the amount is 13 times larger than the country's foreign debt, one needs to rethink if India is indeed a poor country   Illegal personal accounts in foreign banks of dishonest industrialists, scandalous politicians and corrupt IAS, IRS, IPS officers have a sum of around $ 1500 billion -  an amount about 13 times larger than the country's foreign debt. With this amount, 45 crore poor people can get Rs 1,00,000 each.   This huge amount has been appropriated from the people of India by exploiting and betraying them.   Once this huge amount of black money comes back to India , the entire foreign debt can be repaid in 24 hours. After paying the entire foreign debt, we will have surplus amount, almost 12 times larger than the foreign debt. If this surplus amount is invested in earning interest, the amount of interest will be more than the annual budget of the Central government. So even if all the taxes are abolished, then too the Central government will be able to maintain the country very comfortably.   Some 80,000 people travel to Switzerland every year, of whom 25,000 travel very frequently. 'Obviously, these people won't be tourists. They must be travelling there for some other reason,' believes an official involved in tracking illegal money. And, clearly, he isn't referring to the commerce ministry bureaucrats who've been flitting in and out of Geneva ever since the World Trade Organisation (WTO) negotiations went into a tailspin!   Just read the following details and note how these dishonest industrialists, scandalous politicians, corrupt officers, cricketers, film actors, illegal sex trade and protected wildlife operators, to name just a few, sucked this country's wealth and prosperity. This may be the picture of deposits in Swiss banks only. What about other international banks?   Black money in Swiss banks -- Swiss Banking Association report, 2006 details bank deposits in the territory of Switzerland by nationals of following countries:   Top Five:     1. India ---- $1,456 billion   2. Russia ---$ 470 billion   3. UK -------$390 billion   4. Ukraine - $100 billion   5. China -----$ 96 billion         Now do the maths - India with $1456 billion or $1.4 trillion has more money in Swiss banks than rest of the world combined.   Public loot since 1947: Can we bring back our money? It is one of the biggest loots witnessed by mankind -- the loot of the Aam Aadmi (common man) since 1947, by his brethren occupying public office.   It has been orchestrated by politicians, bureaucrats and some businessmen. The list is almost all-encompassing. No wonder, everyone in India loots with impunity and without any fear. What is even more depressing in that this ill-gotten wealth of ours has been stashed away abroad into secret bank accounts located in some of the world's best known tax havens. And to that extent the Indian economy has been stripped of its wealth.   Ordinary Indians may not be exactly aware of how such secret accounts operate and what are the rules and regulations that go on to govern such tax havens. However, one may well be aware of 'Swiss bank accounts,' the shorthand for murky dealings, secrecy and of course pilferage from developing countries into rich developed ones.   In fact, some finance experts and economists believe tax havens to be a conspiracy of the western world against the poor countries. By allowing the proliferation of tax havens in the 20th century, the western world explicitly encourages the movement of scarce capital from the developing countries to the rich.   In March 2005, the Tax Justice Network (TJN) published a research finding demonstrating that $11.5 trillion of personal wealth was held offshore by rich individuals across the globe. The findings estimated that a large proportion of this wealth was managed from some 70 tax havens. Further, augmenting these studies of TJN, Raymond Baker -- in his widely celebrated book titled 'Capitalism's Achi

Iw6vqJd8aa	Yes, they will. She will have to be fully released from the doc. No follow ups, no nothing. It may take a bit because there might be a waiting period to make sure she is totally rehabilitated. She will have to sent her medical records to the MEPS (Military entry Processing Station) first. The Government can't make anything easy. LOL Then the doc will say yea or nay. If he says yea, then she goes down finishes her psychical and talk with the counselor. To select her job, length of service, bonuses if any, ect. Gets her contract typed up then swears in.     If the MEPS doc says no to her medical records then she will have to apply to the Surgeon General of that service for an exception to policy. I'm betting that she will have to wait maybe a year with the screws.    Go to the websites for the different branches or the branch of her choice and sent them an e-mail or talk to the local recruiter. They should be able to tell her the waiting period.

All the cardboard, all the stuff you don't want, and all the outer packaging goes in the trash.     I also would suggest jerky or powerbars. Great lightweight snacks for when you are moving and don't want to stop for a meal. Make sure everyone hydrates well and maintains their feet.     Have fun and make sure to have a form of communication out there. Bad things happen on long hikes and when you need it you will want to reach out and get help.

Then you have the working poor, this covers the folks who work 6 days a week to scratch out a living and the 10 percent who are on the welfare rolls.    The majority think you get something for nothing, but, nothing in life is free. Someone has to pay for it and if you tax big business, they pass that along to the people who buy the product so, the working poor get hammered again.    Semper Fi|`|BHeBSGemaa	This is true.

3WLec6lsaa	Yeah seriously! obama gives money to the people, helps out our infrastructure, gives aid to Americans who need it, and gets shot down. Bush spends more money, but instead of on Americans he spends it on reshaping a country that should be responsible for itself.     They speak about 'government handouts' and wasteful spending and people living off of welfare. Well, guess what? Iraqis were getting government welfare and government handouts, they still are, shouldn't THEY learn not to be lazy and pick up for themselves?|`|X1bKThZ1aa	Freedom is more important than Obama getting a new lawn in Washington DC.|`|gdYN39gtaa	1. There is a war going on in Iraq. It always costs money to         protect our troops wherever they are.       2. The other is a Stimulus Package, of which 80% will never         stimulate the economy, because it is a Pork Barrel Spending         Bill.       Lots of difference there, my friend.

This pkg/bill thing is worthless.  It was all about getting pet projects passed and not really helping the economy.  If you want to help the economy then present something that will work, not this garbage.      By the way, please name 3 government programs that work the way they are suppose to.

But even if I had been, that does not change the fact that Pres. Obama promised that this would be a stimulus package to increase jobs and to improve the country's infrastructure. Less than ten percent is going toward infrastructure....and I don't see how it will create new PERMANENT jobs by laying sod in Washington, or giving millions to the performing arts etc. I am not saying that if we could afford it, that those wouldn't be nice to do, but in this crisis situation, the ENTIRE package should be creating as many jobs as possible.    Personally, I think that supporting the small and midsize businesses so that they can remain viable so they don't have to lay anyone off is the best approach to use. It won't be until people feel secure in their jobs that they will have the confidence to spend...and spending is what grows a country....not saving.|`|0s09peMQaa	Is this the lamo Bush did it so we can to thing... I really would not compare myself in that manner. But, hey, good luck with that. I'm sure the  dem admin will have a fun time in jail.. All eyes on them.

g8CsCKpGaa	As others have said, they are construction battalions.  Their motto: "We Build, We Fight".  They are called upon to construct just about everything, from runways and ammo depots, to school houses and underwater support structures.  The catch is, they build these things in sometimes hostile areas, and therefore, need to be able to defend themselves.    As an enlisted SEABEE, you could operate machinery (bulldozers, backhoes, etc..), handle steel building frames, route electrical cabling, and install foundations.

DB7UMkGCaa	The silence of the libs is deafening. Those who arent silent, are supporting this massive spending, blaming the need for this spending on Bush, of all things. The mess "Bush left behind" is a whole lot of unecessary spending. The claim that Obama has to spend more to get us out of Bush's mess is absolutely illogical. Logic dictates in order to clean up someones mess you do the exact opposite of what the last person did. When someone throws dirt on the floor, you follow through by grabbing a broom and dustpan to sweep it up. Not throw more dirt on the floor.|`|3YRrGfkiaa	That $410 billion is called the federal budget.

3YRrGfkiaa	It's not funny.  But it is necessary.  Under Bush, income inequality grew faster than it did under Clinton.  More wealth was placed into the hands of a small group of rich people, while everyone else got poorer.<br>  <br>  You can't get blood from a stone, and you can't get more taxes from a shrinking middle class.  Bush's tax cuts gave the biggest cuts to those who needed it least - the rich.|`|DgfEkFGLaa	Bush's tax cuts were larger for the wealthy then for the middle class. The wealthy were suppose to invest that money here by expanding their businesses here. They did not do that. They took the money and the jobs out of the country instead. By ending the higher income tax cuts and increasing tax cuts to the lower incomes that money will be spent here, thereby stimulating the economy.<br>  Is it funny that a 90+ year old man froze to death in his home in Kentucky because he could not pay his heating bill? <br>  Or that the fathers of two families in California committed murder/suicide of their families when they were laid off their jobs and could not find a way to make their house payments?

If the privilege granted in office were to end once he left office it would be of no value.  It is therefore reasonable that that privilege be extended for the lifetime of those who are protected by it. It also is in the best interest of everyone since Congress would waste our time raking previous administrations over the coals anytime the party in power changed.

fcc97be1ae1addc02f0b674cef5d4949aa	Andrew Jackson - first and only    He did it through the sale of lands in the western states like Ohio, Indiana, and Illinois.  He also pulled all of the governments money out of the national bank and put it into state banks.    MM92:  The national debt increased during Clinton's term.  The budget was "balanced" through creative bookkeeping and borrowing from the Social Security fund.    The last time the national debt decreased in a fiscal year was FY1956.|`|B6c7BeDnaa	nobody,some just moved debt.that's what got us in this mess.|`|m1q0vb6waa	Jackson thats why he's on the $20 bill|`|7PTZJ74vaa	The correct answer is Andrew Jackson, the founder of the Democratic Party.

He also picked the mascot of the Democratic Party. His opponent in the election called him a jackass.

In4WJAnRaa	Since Reagan did away with the "Fairness Doctrine," which was a doctrine that said since the public owned the airwaves, responsibilities on a broadcaster to provide coverage of issues of public importance that is adequate and fairly reflects differing viewpoints was required by law. In fulfilling its fairness doctrine obligations, a broadcaster must provide free time for the presentation of opposing views if a paid sponsor is unavailable and must initiate programming on public issues if no one else seeks to do so. So since that doesn't apply anymore, the media can do what they want, and they have.|`|YMHwOBlaaa	Yes it's legal. NBC doesn't have to sell ad space to anyone they don't want. They also rejected an ad from PETA.|`|8gaPElwxaa	My guess is that it is legal - they can probably refuse any advertising that they want to, however, why do you think they are one of the lowest rated stations?  They are unprofessional and do not have legitimate journalists.  You can always tell what policies they endorse.

It's an independent business.|`|ffJcrsmLaa	If the KKK paid the price for the air time (like everyone else), do you think NBC would have to accept the ad? No, of course they wouldn't. The station can choose to reject any ad they want - nothing illegal about that. As an NBC representative said (according to the link you posted), they are not interested in ads involving political advocacy. So that means they would reject an ad with a pro-choice message too.|`|24WMIv9Caa	That Is so sad but not really surprising.

Please, read this article. Please...    "The media myth about the cost of Obama's inauguration"    EXCERPT:     The federal government spent $115 million dollars for the 2005 inauguration. Keep in mind, that $115 million price tag was separate from the money Bush backers bundled to put on the inauguration festivities. For that, they raised $42 million. So the bottom line for Bush's 2005 inauguration, including the cost of security? That's right, $157 million.    And Obama is NOT demanding a new Air Force One. That's just email/internet garbage.|`|X1YS48JLaa	OMG typical democrat....He spends so much money that it is frightening. i can't believe that people would think that spending so much money is good for our country in the long run.

Re Air Force One - new airplanes will not be delivered until AFTER Obama leaves office, even if he is elected to a second term. AND AIRBUS is NOT INVOLVED - they decided NOT to get involved in the bidding for the new planes. And, the replacement process for new Air Force One planes was begin by the Bush Administration, before Obama became President.    Oh, and breach of contract is NOT A CRIME. It may make a person liable for civil damages, but it is not a criminal offense.|`|jEqISBnQaa	No class, that's why.    "Plus he is demanding a New AirBus A380 for Air Force One."

Dunc379maa	What this is going to be is the first quest to chart a path for the "fairness doctrine" and make the effort to muzzle anyone is Obama's path to his eventual dictatorship. Obama has not one good, honest bone in his body and he is a sociopath looking for control and he wil be no different than Putin when it comes down to it. Before long, you may notice the opposition mysteriously disappearing without a trace just like you see in Russia, China, The Ukraine and other parts of dictatorship based countries. By the way........this is no joke and I don't find it amusing because the potential for this is here and once you see the Fairness Doctrine reintroduced, you can bet Nancy Pelosi and company will fully back it and it will pass.|`|2c3rcQRbaa	I doubt it but if the DNC starts actively campaigning to silence Rush then Rush would have no choice but to sue the living hell out of the DNC.

Liberal republicans (usually called moderate republicans). There are two types:    1) Socially conservative but fiscally moderate (raise taxes, some govt programs).     2) Libertarian types - very fiscally conservative, limited govt but socially liberal (believe that govt should not  intervene on personal choices - believe marriage should be a civil union,  abortion is a choice).|`|BQY8b2YOaa	The way I would look at it is that they would both be considered independents. Republican and Democrat are just political parties that have the power in Washington.   A conservative, IMO, is someone who takes personal responsibility for their lives, wants the government not to interfere in their lives.  A liberal is a person who wants the government to give them everything they need to live, IMO. They want to be able to do anything they want and not be held responsible for their actions.|`|mwEBrwlOaa	There is probably very little difference except minor differences on their stances on social policy. Conservative Democrats tend to be 'Southern Democrats' and they tend to take a more conservative approach to social policy then other Democrats. One example would be a Conservative Democrat would likely support funding programs for poor provided there was the proper oversight. Whereas a liberal Republicans would most likely oppose it unless the proposal had some oversight ensuring it would only go to those who needed it. Typically Liberal Republicans would most likely be those elected in 2006 who ran on a platform opposing Bush's policies or 2008 Presidential Candidates like Guiliani. Furthermore Liberal Republicans tend to be fiscally conservative but not as conservative when it comes to social policy as the Republican counterparts.    One area where the two would differ a Liberal Republican would not support expanding gay rights but a Conservative Democrat would most likely support it provided the legislation did not legalize gay marriage. A Democrat who was more 'left-wing' would go further and support gay marriage. However when it comes to being fiscally conservative with spending, like the current debate in the Senate regrding the stimulus package, then they are almost impossible to differentiate.|`|Bv0dPwCDaa	one vote away from right and wrong|`|IMaJbaPqaa	Conservative Democrats...

Stennis (former Senator from Mississippi)  Richard Shelby (before he became a Republican)  Allan Shivers (former Governor of Texas)    Liberal Republicans...  Lincoln Chafee (former Senator from Rhode Island)  Lowell Weicker (former Senator from Connecticut)  Nelson Rockefeller (former Governor of New York)  Jacob Javits (former Senator from New York)  Thomas E. Dewey (Republican presidential candidate in 1944 & 1948)    For more info, go to Wikipedia.    Conservative Democrats were big on states' rights issues, fiscally conservative but still liked heavy regulation of industry, generally opposed to free trade, very militaristic foreign policy, very socially conservative    Liberal Republicans accepted Big Government (read, New Deal) but wanted to manage it more efficiently. They were internationalists on foreign policy and favored free trade. They were quite liberal on issues like abortion and civil rights.

FUL3Ez2Iaa	If we cut the Federal Government in half, it would add a lot more that $5,000.00 a year to the economy.  I am all for your idea!|`|58607c6ba5c8f548e69203c94d723527aa	The problem is none of the two parties will do that. Both parties now believe government is the solution to the problem. When if fact they are the reason. We need a third party that wants to reduce the size and scope of the Federal Government and return most power to the states. However this is next to impossible when they are brainwashing the masses with the nonsence of globalism.|`|4fda62554c07de687e2ca85293849ac6aa	You are absolutely correct.  Except the amount is incorrect.  Payroll taxes on $50,000 would be more in the range (including socialist security and mediscare) would be around $15,000.    We could stimulate the economy without reducing government revenue.  Just switch to the Fair Tax.  Payroll taxes, and capital gains taxes would be eliminated.    The reason the politicians won't do that.  How would they blackmail contributors to their re-election funds if they weren't able to hand out special deals.  If all taxes were collected on sales they'd have 1/10 the power they now have.  So they'd rather vote for pretend stimulus packages that won't do anything and keep their power.  Who is John Galt?|`|cWmx0J4jaa	Exactly, cut the size of gov't and gov't spending. Then you can lower taxes and create more jobs. Recessions will pass on their own within 1.5-2yrs. If the gov't messes with it, it can be extended. (see FDR)|`|ZQ6JwJ25aa	You make it sound so easy.  Which part of the Federal government would you remove?  The House of Representatives and the Senate have been designed to provide all states and all peoples equal representation.  Or are you talking about the programs that our government sponsors?  If so, how much money would you spend deciding which programs to eliminate?  With all the bureaucracy involved that it wouldn't be quick enough to save our jobs and our economy.  There are so many theories on what the best way to fix our economy that it would be difficult to determine which is the best.  Unfortunately, we won't know which is the best until this economic depression is over.|`|yvPA8FSsaa	You are exactly right.  Something else has been brought to my attention I would like to share.  Do you really know how much money a trillion dollars is?    For a trillion dollars one could buy Microsoft, Apple Computer, Walmart, Pepsico and Coco-cola and still have 23 billion dollars left.      Perhaps this will knock some sense into people who thing having a deficit of a trillion dollars is a good idea.  I wonder if they realize what they are supporting?  How could Bush have been wrong for running deficits in the tens of billions and Obama be right for running deficits over a trillion?  We have an economy that is being bled to death and Obama wants to cut open another artery.      The economy will recover far better if he would do nothing.  If he insists on taking action the way to stimulate the economy is to stop the bleeding.  Cut spending and lower taxes so the private sector has more disposable income.  They can only spend it, save it or invest it.  Any of those choices will help.  But this Bill will take a trillion dollars out of the hands of the taxpayers and hand them the task of repaying it.  Make no mistake.  You will have to pay it back with interest.  The only other choice is hyper-inflation which will devalue the dollar so much you will pay for it that way.  Either way we are screwed.    *
Azdg9KKwaa	Politics. Acorn should not be receiving government funds (our tax dollars) for anything. Where does the Constitution give the government elected officials the right to abuse their powers and waste our tax dollars that should be paying for retirement funds?  Recently, a 93 year old man died in his home because he couldn't afford to pay his gas bill.  That is pathetic and wrong.     Obama has been placed in office for a political purpose.  Now Congress is getting more money from the people so they can waste it on programs to benefit their pockets, not the American people.  The puppet will now play his part as he was elected to do.    Here are some links to this uncontrollable spending Congress seems to have:  http://www.glennbeck.com/content/article...    Back at you, why did Obama agree to give tax payer dollars to foreign nations for abortions?  This is not something I accept as Constitutional or humane.  But, Obama ordered it so.

Drank my way through that first college then my folks cut me off. Long story short, I joined the Navy and now I am disabled with a lot of free time on my hands.   I am a Mass Media major now because I have seen how the media has been manipulated to a point that "news" stations do not show news anymore. What they call hard news stories are always opined during the story. I have no problem with this as long as that story does not fall under "News" but under "Commentary". I think that I may be able to shed a little light on how the media has gotten away from the Who, What Where, When and How of stories and now just give out commentary on items.

The effect of adopting the Euro was neutral - though unfortunately it was created at a time of serious inflation Europe-wide (Britain too, if you remember), and some people thought, wrongly, that this was cause and effect.    The real effect of adopting the Euro was to create a stable currency, unlike Sterling.  We should have gone in at the beginning.    As to the wider EU issues, they are very complicated indeed, and there are many things wrong with the Commission, the Parliament and the basic thinking behind most EU legislation.

But that doesn't mean we need to spend the obscene amounts of money we currently do, most of which goes to military contractors anyways, or to maintain the 100+ bases we have scattered around the world, a legacy from WW2.     We don't need that many bases in the 21st century. Most should be closed down, save for strategically important facilities.

The difference is defense spending is perhaps the single most corrupt area of government spending.     I'm not talking about what the military actually uses... a significant percentage of the spending is pure waste. Ridiculously inflated procurement contracts for things the military never uses. It's beyond corruption.     I'm all for spending on things that are actually useful, and bid on fairly... but there's no excuse for the US military budget to equal(literally) every other country in the world combined.|`|v1a0PHdwaa	Do you know how bloated and wasteful the defense budget is Probably not or you wouldn't have posted this    A few things  1) The Pentagons budget (not including expenditures for Iraq and Afghanistan) has grown from $316B in 2001 to $536B in 2009. This represents a 70% increase. So a 10% decrease is funding will take us from $536B to $483B, which is still more than the $463B the Pentagon had for 2007. All Obama is doing is preventing the budget from growing an average of 10% year after year when theres no discernible advantage to doing so.  2) Obama has said consistently that ALL government agencies will see cuts, but the military budget is the biggest so that has to be one of the first to be addressed.  3) The United States spends more than the next 40+ countries combined in defense spending. How thats tolerated by our taxpayers is beyond me, but Id imagine theyd like a little of that money back at a time like this, wouldnt you?    But to the broader point of this post, I think it would be refreshing to see these cuts being characterized as something other than an ideological win for the Dems. Cutting back right now makes sense because our current budgets arent sustainable.    In other words, if McCain had won the election and was proposing these cuts, what would this post say? Would you call Republican voters gullible? Would you tell people to contact their congressional reps or senators?    Well yes, exactly. Plus, remember that the declared budget doesn't include supplementary amounts for Iraq and Afghanistan or the defense spending spread around other departments like Energy (nukes), veteran care and Homeland Security. Add it all up and its closer to $1 trillion, or well over half of all government spending.|`|0s09peMQaa	It's going to be harder to read if he keeps doing origami with it.|`|E0dl34Y7aa	Dear axx wipe:    That money is the money we will save after we withdraw from Iraq and is actually the money we should never have been spending in the first place.|`|mKIA6V4Saa	Really, really stupid.|`|ioCiw5zlaa	I'm all for it.

Most of that overblown defense budget that Bush had wasn't for the troops, but rather for the private contractors "working" for the government. Haliburton and the others bled this government for everything they could and Bush and Cheney let it happen. Besides, after the Iraq is over, there won't be a need for the 50 billion dollars.

Every person and every nation has the right of self defense.|`|5zBEU99kaa	I support Israel having the same rights and responsibilities as any other territory seeking to be recognized as a Sovereign nation.  I also believe that where Israel has been very keen about exercising and exploiting the benefits it might gain from this, however, it has been slack concerning fulfilling it's responsibilities.      The UN Resolution providing for recognition of Israel as a state was  conditional with the understanding that Israel would fulfill those established requirements for recognition as a Sovereign state found in the UN Charter and the resolution.  Three of these requirements are yet to be satsified.     1. A Constitution, Government Charter or other document defining the structure of Government  - Israel never drafted or ratified a constitution or otherwise affirmed a Republican for of government.     2. A legal definition of the states territories and borders.  - Israel has not defined it's borders.     3. Resolution of any territorial disputes: For a new state to be recognized it cannot have any territorial disputes with it's neighbors.     When these requirements are fulfilled the UN Conditions for recognition as a Sovereign state will have been completed and Israel will be considered a legitimate state under international laws and conventions.     Because Israel is in direct contradiction of more UNSC Resolutions than any other territory or state, and is making no discernable effort to correct the situation I consider the Israel to be a rogue territory.     Further evidence of Israel being a rogue territory is demonstated in its behavior:    1. Israel's occupation of Palestinian territory in contradiction with UNSC Resolutions is no different than Iraqs occupation of Kuwait in contradiction with UNSC Resolutions. For this Iraq was called a rogue state so then also Israel is rogue.    2. Israel's building and expanding settlements on occupied territory in contradiction with both UNSC Reslutions and other Internatioan Conventions to be criminal.    3. Israel's penetration of it's neighbors airspace with armed military aircraft without permission is a provocation, and a hostile action against the integrity of a nations borders (an act of war).|`|Zye7SfK0aa	well maybe israel has the right to exist in antartica... not in the middle east... they steal lands... replaced palestinians from their homes in refugee camps.... they killed innocent children and women.... so they are barbarians ... they are terrorists.... and they started the attack not hamas started it... ofcourse you r not going to believe it because u just watch biased news channels|`|FrfdKKGWaa	Support for the same reason as you support them.|`|24WMIv9Caa	Support It 100%|`|ca6c1bac92d16664e751aef99dc02c33aa	i support israel.  they have a right to their homeland, and a right to defend themselves.|`|F5yFjbIpaa	I support israel,the bible says that those that rise against israel will be destroyed|`|NqsEFYMRaa	I support them.

wdBY1fWaaa	It's population control plain and simple. Just look at your answers on here, they have no other explanations than "stop whining" and someone even wrote "this isn't china". Exactly! That's why we are questioning this population control.    Here is what Pelosi said:  "Well, the family planning services reduce cost. They reduce cost. The states are in terrible fiscal budget crises now and part of what we do for children's health, education and some of those elements are to help the states meet their financial needs. One of those - one of the initiatives you mentioned, the contraception, will reduce costs to the states and to the federal government."    The liberals can try and twist that any way that they want, but it is population control. First contraception, then sterilization. Read history, it has been done many times before.

I call that plain out murder and our president and his committe said that it was fine and so we would keep it in the system . It is murder plain and simple a live human being being born alive and breathing and then being allowed to die, or if we give partial birth abortions where we deliver the baby all except the head and then put scissors into it brain and twist and then suction out the brain until the head collapses and delivers a dead baby . Both cases a baby is birthed at 9 months and is either killed or murdered what ever you want to say about it , Democrat or Republican , it is still murder . Our president says it is ok and we think it is so ok that we allow him to spend taxpayers money to send to other countries to help them with their abortion clinics .  Murder is Murder . If the Mom kills the baby she is going to be prosecuted , but since the president says it is not only ok , but funds millions of dollars for people to do it , it still is murder and it is totally wrong whether here or in China.|`|BYVr1tOGaa	no....it is "dope and strange"|`|lJPT0PGGaa	I would say he will push for nationalizing the banking system like the good little socialist he is!|`|9qJPfpRpaa	Abortion is not family planning.

An actor can do that, and Lawyers are trained to be good actors, but the American Public wants to believe in Obama, but they also believe in the tooth fairy and global warming as well (oh, it's not global warming any more, it's climate change, since they really have no clue as to whether it's getting hotter or colder).    Obama's whole image is mythical hype. The real Obama has no clue.

Frankly if the military was run as a business it would have shut down and gone into recievership along time ago and there would be massive unemployment.    For a start it does not pay its workers a fair wage despite the billions pumped into it, if you cannot look after your people your business is doomed to fail.    It would require a lot of changes to its processes and procedures, as well as its human resource management policies to take out the wasted dollars before I voluntarily gave a cent.    The military claims it is undermanned in many countries and you will usually find it is because it is not a competative employer or career option anymore.|`|iTpP4Af7aa	15%.

And the stories of families sending over bullet-proof vests?)    Just did my taxes and saw what I paid to the Fed.  There's no way I would make voluntary donations on that scale, but it's the law and my duty to pay them, so I don't mind.|`|4fda62554c07de687e2ca85293849ac6aa	That depends on how many other government functions would go on to this voluntary plan.

There are many names for Jesus in the Bible. Yahweh is just the Hebrew term meaning God which can be found in the Old Testament of the Bible, typically in the King James Version. Regardless of what their (the Jews) beliefs are, the Bible states that they, Jews, are God's Holy people because they reside in the Holy Land. God's people have disobeyed him numerous times in history, whether it be worshiping false gods, greed for wealth, etc. However, God will punish them for what sins they do as he did in the past, and as Christians, the Bible tells us to have and keep a relationship with God's people and the Holy Land. Yes, Jesus is God, but in his perfect human image. The Father, Son, and Spirit are not the same individual beings, however, each possesses all the characteristics and privileges of Deity forming the Trinity. If you break a cookie into 3 parts, they are all different pieces, and can be considered a cookie whether they are together as 1 or as 3 separate pieces.<br>  <br>  It's fine to disagree with our belief, but it is our freedom to believe it just as it is for you NOT to believe it, no need to persecute us for it.<br>  <br>  EDIT:<br>  Not once did I denounce that Jesus is God, they are the same, in 3 entities. Just because you can't understand it or want to believe it and I cannot put it into words that will "satisfy" you doesn't mean I am wrong. It is my belief and I have full trust and faith in what the Bible tells me. God brought the Jews back to fulfill a prophecy. There will be a 7 year period concluding with the return of Christ, but that will not happen until the Jewish people have reestablished their nation in the Holy Land. Revelations talks all about the end of times.<br>  <br>  Jewish people have had the blessing of God; the nations that have cursed the Jewish people have experienced the curse of God. Read Psalm 122. We support Israel because all other nations were created by men, but Israel was created by God. The Holy Land was given to the Holy People with an everlasting and unconditional covenant, part of the prophecy to come.|`|7M0KW1Iwaa	God is, Jesus is God's son.

84871326f6678fb2f9c40486796e4ebbaa	The flaw in your analysis may not be obvious if you stop the clock at '1,000 jobs'.  To do the job tools and material will have to be purchased.  This 'demand' will require workers to fill the tools and material order.  Then there's shipping.  People will have to load trucks, drive trucks and offload trucks to get the material to the job site.  But wait...there's more.  Truckers stop at truck stops, requiring more workers to service the needs of both the truckers and the trucks. Repairs, fuel, insurance, and all the expenses needed to keep the wheels on the road.  All that spends cash into the economy. Then of course there's bookkeeping services, engineering services and all the other services required to maintain, plan, inspect and service all the workers not directly involved in the project.  Then we have the aggreate demand angle.  Each of these workers will now spend money on various goods ands services.  Each of these dollars spent represents wages, profits, savings, investments and taxes. Greater demand will inspire more production and more market activity.  More market activity results in more lending by banks to those who wish to start or expand business' to service with this new demand genrated by the '1000 jobs'.  Even 'earmarks' involve cash money passing from hand to hand, generating profits, wages, investments, savings and taxes that return cash to the government in one form or another.  As it takes 'energy' to crank over an engine to start a car, this 'stimulus' has the 'energy' to crank over a shutdown economy.  Multiply the 1000 jobs by several thousand and the fallout will produce millions of jobs that are not directly tied into the 'stimulus' itself.  If done right, this will work.

a0ea30926acdfeb82a6d6f9ca13bcc69aa	I can remember when Roe vs Wade was passed.  My sister had a couple of friends who had illegal abortions.  They didn't have any problems but I remember the scare stories.    I can agree that I would like to see less abortions.    "Some people are against sexual education saying it doesn't prevent teens from having sex."    True, but the vast majority who are against sex education are against it for other reasons.  Most of the people that I know who are against sex education are against it because they think that it is not the government's responsibility to teach these things.  I know that some parents shirk their responsibilities in this area but teaching it is government schools doesn't solve the root of the problem which is the parents' irresponsibility.    I've known quite a few women who have had abortions and every single one of them knew what they were doing.  They knew about contraceptives when the got pregnant.  Some regretted their decision and some didn't.  Some see the pregnancy as tissue in their bodies and some see it as a baby.  I have two male friends whose wives had abortions without their blessings.  They wanted the child but had no say in the matter even though they were married.  Both divorced their wives.    You mention this being taught in school but not how it could/should be taught at home.  Is there a reason that you left out that option?  Is having the government teach this information the ONLY way that people can learn about it?  If not, why not invest in exploring those other options also?    In our society, information is at our fingertips.  Most people have computers with internet or at least live near a government library.  As I've said, I have never personally known a person who got pregnant who didn't know how it happens and what to do to prevent it.  All of the women that I know got pregnant knowing the risk they were taking or their birth control method failed.    I am actually mostly pro-life in my views but there parts of what you've written that aren't complete.  If this were an essay, I'd say that it jumps around a bit.  Is the main point that government education is the best option for reducing abortions?  If so, you could list the other educational source options and explain why they aren't worth considering.  If your main point is that if women had better information, they wouldn't choose to have an abortion as often, can you include statistics?|`|AA11818174	I think you have the right idea. I agree with you one hundred percent. By not allowing people to talk about abortion and its consequences, people are, ultimately, causing more people who do not understand what they are doing to choose this option without a second thought.|`|7QN9wetGaa	now tht i think about it im  15 in high school.    in neither my middle skool or now high school  have they ever talked about abortion to us... wtf!!!!|`|E0dl34Y7aa	Wanna have less abortions?    Ok, Then offer to pay for those poor children until they can earn a living for themselves.    Seriously, If you want abortions to stop then you pay for the children the parents can't afford.    It's just that simple.    Well? Are you writing any checks?|`|o0VyLaPiaa	You seem like you think you know a lot about girls and women who have abortions.  I think you shouldn't generalize that girls and women get abortions without knowing the consequences and such.  Planned Parenthood and the like are very strong in providing completely unbiased patient education before administering any medical intervention.|`|3WLec6lsaa	Yeah, blog would be better|`|FrfdKKGWaa	The problem is that government (your tax money) pays for 1/3 of all abortions. For each abortion performed,  abortion clinics gets paid. We need to stop funding abortions and start funding adoptions. For each woman they can convince to put up their children for adoption, the govt can pay the clinics.     It is not the responsibility of the public school system to teach children about abortion. Actually, they already do that - that's where I learned about it. I was in the 7th grade and we had to debate about Roe vs Wade. (I grew up in Los Angeles).  I decided to be pro-choice at age 12/13 because my teacher was also pro-choice. I thought only about the woman's right to choose, nothing about the unborn baby.     Of course, as I got older, I learned more and more about the facts about abortion and now I do not believe it is right (unless in serious situation which is only 1% of all abortions performed).|`|Hp2DKNH5aa	I agree with some of what you said. Some people do blind themselves to the truth of abortion. If they were required to watch what happens to the 'fetus' (BABY) as the result of abortions they would think twice about having one!      WarriorX: Abortion is NOT contraception.    contra: against  ception: conception    Contraception PREVENTS pregnancy. Abortion kills the conceived human being!|`|k2Jbp9e6aa	The problem with the abortion debate is that those taking the strongest stands - the Catholic bishops on the pro-life side, and lesbian-feminists on the pro-choice side - are not personally affected one way or the other because there is no way that they are going to get pregnant themselves.|`|Uwad1Irmaa	my opinion is people don't want a lecture and this topic is so polarizing, it's pointless to try to lecture people not agreeing with you|`|11bc4cae873dd3e9feff6c81fac05c17aa	A woman gets an abortion, she deserves what ever happens to her.

I don't like abortion either, but like it or not Roe is the law of the land, and the best you can do is reduce it.|`|LZY9yDIfaa	This is not a question. Please get a blog...on some other site.  I'm pro choice but I don't think your post is appropriate here.|`|0f6a1cdae0a3ce3617b1109a091741bdaa	Because of the legalization of abortion, it has become somewhat of an accepted fact or the easy way out in the event of an unwanted pregnancy. If that option was not legally open to people....maybe...just maybe...the woman or girl would choose NOT to seek out the dangerous kinds done in back alley slums.    But you are right that it takes education. Especially being that abortion is legal, teachers who teach sex ed. should be showing movies of just what an abortion is. They need to show its brutality. It is not just a simple little procedure like having a hangnail removed. I have heard from many women who have had abortions...and every one of them felt shame because of it. They truly didn't understand what it means or how it is done.|`|AA10223196	My only grandchild was aborted - a beautiful and healthy baby boy.  That was several years ago, but the pain and anguish is still there.  My daughter regrets her action.  I still don't understand how a woman can kill her own child.  She should be charged with murder.

qHfTHro3aa	You just hit the nail on the head!   Good job!  The more people they push into poverty, the more people will need the "social services" like welfare and food stamps.  That means more votes for them and the longer they get to stay in power.  See the cycle?|`|TJpQZju2aa	We vote Democrat because they support the unions, and the unions have helped our family achieve the American dream.  Because of the union my husband has a living wage, great medical coverage, and a pension plan.  The American dream is still possible, you just have to be willing to work hard to achieve it.  We are evidence of that, my husband is a roofer, he gets up every morning at the crack of dawn and literally puts blood, sweat, and tears into his work.  There are too many people in this country that just want everything handed to them.  We had nothing when we started out, but by watching our spending, making wise decisions, and saving our money, we just purchased our fist home in one of the worst economic climates in recent history.  If it weren't for the Democrats fighting to support the unions, my husband and I would be members of the working poor.  Non-union roofers around here make about $10/hr, my husband makes $28/hr plus benefits.

vNvtwuBfaa	That's exactly the case.  He doesn't want any republicans to able to come out at the next election with the platform "I didn't vote for that failed plan."  It's a feign to be bi-partisan, which is a farce.  A truly bi-partisan plan would contain elements and content from the other party. This has none, he just wants their support for the sake of appearance and deception.  Knowing all this, he's simply positioning himself politically because of the high chance that this plan will fail.  He's a coward.|`|m3jb9qjdaa	Needs scapegoat for when if fails.|`|eafeb487799eda2a8dd4f1d8cb95f9c8aa	Because he doesn't have enough Democrat votes in the Senate.

Guess we will hear you complaining for the next 4 years, at least.  :P|`|FUL3Ez2Iaa	Not all Democrats voted for it and he knows that he is headed for a more difficult battle getting it passed in the Senate.

Obama KNOWS that this package of his is doomed from the start, if for no other reason than the pork that's in it.  If he has Republican backing for it, he can say that it wasn't just the Dem's fault. Well, hopefully the Senate republicans will do the same, then the Dumocrats will be the one true owner of this fiasco called a "stimulus" bill.|`|12m9145haa	I really don't think he's that petty. You are associating Republican traits(pettiness) with him. He's not Republican.      Oh! your avatar is giving the finger, What classy white trash you are.|`|N0iM1mo8aa	so he can look like he's being bipartisan.  It all comes down to appearances.  The dems thing the general public is to stupid to either read between the lines or do homework.  THey are hoping that we won't notice that they didn't allow the Repubs to debate the bill, offer any alternatives to the bill, or help write the bill.  Then they want to parade around and act like they are trying to get the Repubs support for this disaster.        I guess since it worked for 1 1/2- 2 1/2 yrs its a pretty good plan.  We really need the public to wake up and realize that neither group is all that bright nor do they seem to have our best interests at heart anymore.|`|bl0RZJrDaa	because Barry and the dems need someone to blame, but the problem is that if all the Republicans vote NO, all the blame will fall on the DNC|`|rephaDjLaa	He wants bipartisanship.

But the Republicans have their own idea of how to stimulate the economy.  Bu their idea is just that - an idea - and they have nothing concrete to show to the President.  I think the President should just push his own agenda because he has enough votes from both the House of Representatives as well as the Senate.|`|MEReSvZeaa	Too late.  All republicans in the House voted "no".  If it doesn't work, there's no way to blame them.    (Typically, liberals are spineless weasles.

You seem to be suggesting the president is wrong to want to work with members of both parties.  If he didn't approach the GOP members, the Right wingers would only WHINE about that.|`|Zf5gSpKnaa	Yeah...  Seems like a blame game to me.|`|0f6a1cdae0a3ce3617b1109a091741bdaa	If the house vote was any example, not ALL the democrats are for it either. If just a few vote no, the plan is history. Most Americans are raising an outcry to Washington to not pass the bill with it's many foolish parts....but to make it what it really needs to be to provide job security for working people and financial security for those who have been layed off already. Plus, a boost to businesses in the form of tax cuts could help keep them viable so they don't lay off more people. We need to restore confidence...and the few jobs that the plan will produce as written won't begin to do that.    I predict that if the administration pushes this plan forward and it doesn't work...and I mean quickly...that Obama can write off a second term. Even his own will turn against him when THEY lose their jobs.|`|qrGzsQWzaa	So when his plan fails, he can blame the Republicans.    Remember all to ones that voted for the Iraqi war that later blamed it all on Bush|`|E0dl34Y7aa	no. it's because he is serious about being a consensus President. But he's also not going to let republicans push him around like a "boy".|`|i5F2jwvhaa	thats the only reason    He knows as it stands now if it fails the blame falls entirely on the DNC|`|HI0oQriqaa	i think you got it . dems always need someone to blame it  on.|`|hZJ6xx1Kaa	Untrue, 11 democrats voted against it.|`|pnpkJKvpaa	For us to succeed, we need to work together.    I know this is a huge departure from the Bush doctrine, but try to catch up.|`|X1yZOMYHaa	No... if it fails Obama will wear it, as president and chief sponsor, no matter who in congress supported it.    He wants republican support for a few reasons. One, bi-partisan support will simply look good and create a better environment for his plans going forward. Two, consumer confidence. If both parties support it sends a stronger message to Wall Street, the market, and consumers, that the US government is acting with one voice.

Earmarks are local spending bills that weren't in the original legislation, added on before congress votes, without being debated. There's nothing like that in this bill. Yet.    As for pork, I guess you can call it pork. But that's the purpose of a spending bill, let alone a stimulus bill. There's nothing wrong with public spending. It's necessary, so long as it's out in the open and debated. Highways do have to get built. Any funding for highways could be called pork. It's the earmark process that's the problem, when it isn't debated and wasn't passed on its own merit.

They likely wont investigate unless there is a slew of complaints against the same company.|`|qGh1HhPwaa	You can tape them if you advise them first, or you want to trick them|`|nYtZQNuzaa	right.  you may never record anyone without their consent.  there is a website www.ftc.gov.  if you logged time, dates, and incidents you have every right to report your complaint to them.  this is what I did.  unfortanetely I haven't had any feedback though and I can not honestly tell you what will happen.

vGu6bcR9aa	The same as any other killer for the most part. A killer who does so at 19 and gets caught at 50 will face and probably get the same punishment they'd get if they'd been caught sooner.     Killers are caught decades after the fact all the time and rarely does how "good" they've been after that weight on the decision because if they were truly good (i.e. moral) people they'd have turned themselves in and paid their debt to society and the victim's families.    An 8 or 10 year old at the time is a different matter. For murder there has to be an intent to kill. 8 year-olds don't have that intent as they barely grasp the concept of mortailty to start with, much less understand what it is to intentionally kill someone. That would factor in.|`|ktMefP0oaa	Depends, a child can be held until he's 18 then stand trial for the crime, if evidence shows the crime was premeditated, and he brought the implements to commit the crime. A 12 yr old stood trail in florida for killing 2 tourists as an adult. Most of the crimes solved is mostly about closure.|`|RgblqqxIaa	Well there are a lot of legal issues at play here.  First, if the person was say 8 they would probably would have been tried as a juvenile, and thus only could get 10 years (released at 18 for juvenile offenders), therefore he could only get 10 years.  Now, if the present DA can prove he could have tried that person as an adult back when the crime was actually committed (he has to be tried under the laws that were in effect back then, not now) then the criminal could get more time depending on if the slaying was murder one, murder two, or manslaughter.

Star-Kist is owned by Del Monte Foods and is a major  contributor to Pelosi.                 Star-Kist is the major employer in American Samoa employing  75% of the Samoan work force.                 Paul Pelosi, Nancy 's husband, owns $17 million dollars  of Star-Kist stock.                  In January, 2007 when the minimum wage was increased from$5.15 to $7.25, Pelosi had American Samoa exempted from the  increase so Del Monte would not have to pay the higher wage.  This would make Del Monte products less expensive than their  competition's.                 Last week when the huge bailout bill was  passed, Pelosi  added an earmark to the final bill  adding $33 million  dollars for an 'economic development credit in  American  Samoa '.

rpajoT0raa	Debt-deflation - caused by contraction of deposit currency, caused by a decrease in loans, also causing a slow down in the velocity of circulation - may take a decade to be overcome.    Irving Fisher points out two ways out of such a depression. One way is to let economic nature take its course until widespread bankruptcy causes the growing debt to eventually start diminishing. This is the so-called natural way out of a depression, via needless and cruel bankruptcy, unemployment and starvation.    Reflation, as affected by the government, according to Fisher is a much more effective and less painful cure to deflation. The reflation of prices causes a contraction in real debt, reversing the debt-deflation cycle and providing much needed relief for businesses.|`|twPZBsH2aa	When you print money, inflation results.

zJepNQkbaa	It sure sounds like teachers themselves are acknowledging public schools suck.  They know how extremely hard it is to get rid of poor teachers and they blame everyone but themselves for public schools failures.  Teachers are rarely fired, tenure makes it almost impossible.  In NJ, the average teacher salary is over $63,000 working out to over $350/day.  School is out nearly 4 months/year, yes, a 180 day school year gives them 4 months off each year, and their day is over early. To say they're underpaid is idiocy or dishonesty, take your pick.  That teachers want to prevent others who might not be able to afford private schools from attending them by opposing vouchers is despicable, and whatever teachers unions tell you about public schools is designed to enrich them and make their job easier, they could care less about your kids.<br>  <br>  It sounds like critical is in denial, the rate nationwide is double and in the 40% range in the cities, so there is no doubt it is above the general population in the suburbs too.<br>  <br>  Private schools work, and public schools don't.  By sending their own kids to private schools they are admitting as much.  Lets fund the schools that work and let the ones that don't become history, that would be change we can believe in.|`|4p2Db8AZaa	In private schools the kids can be promoted to upper class even if they fare badly in exams, as parents pay more to save their face and the kids gets promoted, their aim is to get a degree for their duffer children so that their ststus in society is not em brassed.|`|74VzqhlVaa	private schools have smaller classes therefore students perform better as a whole<br>  <br>  the more you pay the better quality you get|`|MM8rqTMtaa	You have to broaden your focus.  A successful education depends on both the parents and the teachers.  It's not one or the other.|`|3Z4YFz29aa	"Teachers, it is reasonable to assume, care about education, are reasonably expert about it and possess quite a lot of information about the schools in which they teach. We can assume that no one knows the condition and quality of public schools better than teachers who work in them every day." <br>  <br>  Do McDonald's employees prefer their kids eat at nicer restaurants?<br>  <br>  These teachers see the kinds of students they have to TRY to teach, and they don't want their children around those students. Is that so wrong?<br>  <br>  I bet teachers that teach in suburban areas and upper class and middle class areas don't send their kids to private schools in such numbers.<br>  <br>  If I work at a prison, do I want my kids to go to prison?<br>  <br>  edit: YOU don't get it. These teachers are teaching in school systems that service a tough population to teach: apathetic, poor, urban. MOST of those teachers are doing their best with what they are given, but realize that regardless of how good they are, without help from parents and administrators, the schools may still not be good learning environments, and it is normal to not want their kids in those environments.<br>  <br>  These teachers want a BETTER educational ENVIRONMENT for their children than what these urban school districts are providing, NOT becuase of the teachers, but because of the students, parents, and administrations! Also, private schools don't have to let a violent student back in because the student is special ed!<br>  <br>  edit 2: yes, all the money in the world won't make those urban schools better unless discipline is enforced, parents are held accountable, and laws and rules are streamlined to make those things happen! Liberals want kids in school no matter what because they don't want troublemakers on the streets. They want trouble makers babied in the schools! A special ed student can only be suspended a maximum of 6 days a year regardless of his behavior!!!! he could assault a teacher, go to jail, get out and have to be put back in school! The best we can hope for now, however, is higher teacher salaries and lower class sizes to keep the good teachers from fleeing to the suburban schools!

And I was talking to young guys who have girlfriends who were pregnant and they can't wait until that first of the month to get that check. And that bothered me. There was something about it that didn't make sense. So, I'd talk to my mom about it. And she summed it up very succinctly. She said, she didn't want the government to raise her children.

AA10690306	The reason most Republicans put down "green" jobs is that very few Republicans stand to make money off of them.  There are huge amounts of money to be made in the "green" frontier but only if you are not afraid of change.  Here in Montana they are putting up wind farms in the passes where the wind almost never drops below 15mph.  They are adapting the old dams that were only for irrigation to provide hydro-power.  And many other "green" jobs are being located here.    The funny part is Le Porc is right because even the "Garbage Men" are going green.  We have "Dumps" that are generating Methane that is being burned to generate electricity instead of just venting into the atmosphere.    Of course we also have the only Democratic Governor and Republican LT Governor.  Here at least not all of the Republicans are afraid of the facts.    The Carbon Trade in California was sabotaged in California by the very companies that refused to change or allow change.  ANY company or party that refuses to change is doomed to FAIL.  Not because of the global climate change but because once a company or party stops changing and innovating it can not keep up with the market and DIES, usually a slow death but sometimes their failure becomes glaring and they fall apart very fast.  Just like the Republican party is now.  Those who voted for the new leader of the Republican party are trying to salvage it but the Republicans on here are a sign of how fast the party is falling apart!|`|yZXe2XLlaa	A garbage collection job could be considered a green job.|`|418d2e9812dceb72c6c1d038184e789baa	"Green" is just a fad and it will fade.

Absent from that opinion is a very important fact: green jobs and "going green" in general costs more to implement, and the end result is the same as whatever it replaced.

Warning: don't look too long, or you might look forever.|`|ywIGrPOdaa	What irks me most about all this green bull sh--, is that it's a liberal pipe dream!!

BQY8b2YOaa	After reading your lengthy explanation, your first step would be to go talk to a Marine Recruiter. When you talk to him, you are not obligated to anything. You can ask him all the questions you desire. Again, you are not obligated to anything until you have signed on the dotted line to enlist.  I am NOT a recruiter but I can give you some advice through my years in the Navy. These may have changed since I retired in 2004. You do need a HS diploma or a GED in order to be accepted. You will have to take a basic qualifying test called the ASVAB (Armed Services Aptitude Battery Test) which you must score at least a 30 on. This tests your aptitude for the various number of jobs (MOS) you will be qualified to do while you are in. As for your history of past drug use, when I joined the Navy in 1988, you were required to disclose ANY past drug use. If you were found to have lied on your enlistment papers saying you never had done drugs but you actually did, you could be dishonorably discharged and that will follow you for the rest of your life. Be completely honest with your recruiter.   Again, go talk to a recruiter and put out all the questions and even more that you may think of that you have asked here. They will be much more qualified to answer them.   Good luck, God Bless and SEMPER FI|`|AA10025824	I think a recruiter would lead you in the right direction.  It would do no good for them to lie to you, so give it a shot.  If you want to enlist I'm sure you can be able to do it even if it takes waivers.|`|367926de3fa96492022d3fae80bbab42aa	First talk to a recruiter to find out what the minimum requirement is.

You may still be able to get your high school diploma.     Good Luck.|`|4yCYY814aa	If you really want to, a recruiter will be happy to help you out, they're all for people trying to better themselves. They'll probably have connections to places where you can get your GED and whatnot. Good luck.

Equivocation?<br>  <br>  Anyhow, the liberal belief is not "I as an individual am entitled to have others provide for me and relieve me of all responsibility for myself." Conservatives like to SAY that this is our position, but that is "straw man argument" in which one ignores the opponent's actual statement and substitutes some other statement, claims that the substitute statement is the opponent's view, and then refutes the substitute statement instead of refuting the opponent's actual position.<br>  <br>  The actual position is "It is the best interest of our nation for We the People to provide for the most vulnerable among us rather than abandoning them to perish in their helplessness." It is indeed greedy to insist that we, as a people, have no responsibility to do what is in our nation's best interest.|`|cR1M8ALyaa	I love how republicans swear that all democrats are lazy people who live off the government.

owzmt7lDaa	No, most states have BS GDL laws, unfortunately. GDL Laws will usually have your license suspended for another 1-2 years depending on the state.<br>  <br>  However the good part is that many illegals, other teens, and adults have suspended license or no licenses, but drive anyway.<br>  Since there is such a high turnover rate and considering the shape of the economy, you are not going to go to jail, or at least a few days at maximum.<br>  You will just pay a few hundred dollar fine, which is probably as much as the insurance anyway, less if you don't get pulled over often within a time period..<br>  <br>  P.S you would have had more rights in Europe as a teen than you would in the US, unless you're an illegal teen then you are good. What an effective system!!!!!!|`|WO68RZdIaa	First you seem to have forgotten the main rule about having a license. It is only a privilege, not a right. There is not one of the 50 states that is under any obligation to give any of their residents a driver's license. Since you cannot remember that there are rules that must be obeyed when you are issued a license & that the privilege can (and now in your case- most likely will) be suspended/revoked for violating those rules.<br>  <br>  Depending on state law, you are facing having your license suspended anywhere from now until you turn 18 up to the time you turn 21. If you continue to drive while suspended and continue to get stopped, you can face jail time, be considered a habitual offender & completely lose your license for a very long time.<br>  <br>  I am truly surprised that your vehicle was not impounded if there was not a licensed driver with you to take over responsibility of the vehicle once the officer determined that you are not legal to drive. It definitely would have been impounded by any of the officers in the department I work with.|`|uh2bkRrFaa	You will lose your license until you're 21 and get a nice big fat fine, I only wish they could make it so you could never drive.

8dc5NMexaa	It is more difficult for testosterone, as opposed to estrogen, to feel comfortable in a "one-size- fits-all" "suit" of laws.  Even though it has changed dramatically, the early origins of mankind had the men going out as hunters, and the women communally taking care of the young in the caves.  Evolution in the genders' respective social roles and expectations has not totally erased the early burdens placed on both.  Even today, I have never heard from a woman that she was told, "You need to get a good education, a good job, for you will need to provide for your husband and children;" however almost every young man has been told, "...to provide for your wife and children."  Hunting was not necessarily communal, and was to a large degree, "every man for himself."  Hunting was competition.  Competition is heightened in the male by the learned expectations upon the male.  Competition by its very nature can be rough and tough, and it takes awhile longer for the males to receive enough sanctions for violations before they are either locked away or "mature out" of legal disobedience.  Many duties are placed upon the male in many [with notable exceptions] of the animal species that require aggression, and winning over others in competition is applauded and rewarded in so many obvious and discrete ways.  So with youthful inexperience, fueled by excessive horsepower [testosterone], accompanied by mixed messages regarding expectations of them, many of the young men have yet to learn how to race around the oval without banging the fences.|`|1VaH8D3Raa	It's all the male ego thing<br>  .<br>  Nothing more nothing less<br>  .<br>  Like Big Time Wrestling on TV where these in human people enter the ring looking like a cave man out to eat the other guy for supper<br>  .<br>  Kind of male ego trip thing<br>  .|`|AA11634870	A great deal of crime is committed by all ages, yes the young are involved in gang crimes and drugs, but behind every young person is a thirty to sixty year group of individuals profiting by drugs, gambling, prostitution, illegal selling and distribution of knock-off drugs, clothing, malfeasance of pension funds, 401K's, and the current mess of the economy.

Effective 11 September 2001, this award also may be bestowed for non-combat meritorious achievement in a designated combat theatre. Normally, the acts or services rendered must be comparable to that required for the Legion of Merit but in a duty of lesser, though considerable, responsibility. A higher decoration, known as the Defense Meritorious Service Medal, is intended for similar services performed under joint service with the United States Department of Defense. Today, most MSM recipients are field grade officers (pay grades O-4 to O-6), senior warrant officers (W-3 to W-5), senior noncommissioned officers (E-7 to E-9), and individuals who have displayed a level of service that warrants an award of such magnitude.

The Second Amendment involves the right of every State to form an armed militia. I've always wondered about that, because the Civil War concerned States rebelling against the government. We've always been taught that this rebellion was illegal and that Abe Lincoln declared a war to hold together the union.    If the Second Amendment is right, the Southern States had the right to break away.  And, by the way, nowhere in the Second Amendment does it give permission for all citizens to arm themselves  unless they are Militia members and, even if they do, I think it is the government they are supposed to be shooting at,  not each other. Food for thought!    Personally, I think it is time the Supreme Court clarified that Amendment once and for all!

According to the Supreme court it is an INDIVIDUAL RIGHT!    http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/District_of...  http://www.dcguncase.com/blog/  http://www.nraila.org/heller/|`|F1bjZjkaaa	This is not and has never been about the right of a state to have a militia. The militia part already existed through article 1 section 8     " To provide for calling forth the militia to execute the laws of the union, suppress insurrections and repel invasions;    To provide for organizing, arming, and disciplining, the militia, and for governing such part of them as may be employed in the service of the United States, reserving to the states respectively, the appointment of the officers, and the authority of training the militia according to the discipline prescribed by Congress;"    To some extent it was even assumed that militia's would exist. What the 2A did was strengthen the militia, and prevent the US govt from damaging it.   It is an individual right, but saying that it protects a duty, just like jury service is protected. The US govt is not allowed to prevent individuals from having arms, that means they cannot forcibly increase the price out of people's range, they cannot prevent people from buying or selling, though they can regulate (to an extent, this is a matter of the powers of govt now).   This was done so the militia would have a ready supply of arms.   The bearing of arms prevents the federal govt from stopping individuals from joining the militia (the states can stop you though which might be why through the 14A, the 2A does not officially apply to the states) This was done so the militia would have a ready source of personnel in times of need.     It is perfectly logicial, it protects something by preventing the US federal govt from doing what it could so easily do. It is still valid, just because the militia is not omnipresent in today's society, does not mean it will not be needed later on.|`|RgblqqxIaa	The right to have a state militia and to bear arms (guns) individually.  It was always a fear of the Founders that the government could try to take over the people and thus the state militias would defend the people from the government if such a thing occurred.    BTW, the Supreme Court recently held that the right to bear arms is an individual right, not just guaranteed to militias.  Whether you agree with it or not that's how the Court ruled.|`|0683ccd6412eda6bd75ac2f24a0c357aaa	Was going to answer, but Dan hit it on the head.|`|TRJ7spD2aa	I honestly think it was merely saying the people "government" had a right to raise an army to defend itself.

n2oEhdZiaa	Combat Medic is an award, Medic is a duty position, Health Care Specialist is an MOS.  There is no guarantee you would be assigned as a medic if you complete the 68W.  You could be on an ambulance team, at a battalion aid station, in a hospital, etc.  The best question may be what do you plan on doing after you get out of the Army.  68W gets you an EMT B certification.  I would GUESS that X-Ray tech would be a little more prestigious and may actually qualify you for a civilian X-Ray tech.  I am also guessing that would make more money than an EMT B cert since that will basically get you entry level with a civilian ambulance.  If you are planning on using your GI Bill after you get out to build your civilian resume and you want to be a medic for a line unit, then live the dream and go to 68W.  You can probably work your way into a line unit if you aren't immediately assigned there after graduating.

lvBUl3Zdaa	Because in those countries health care is considered a basic human right, and the purpose of the health care delivery system is to provide services to those who need them.     In the US the dominant philosophy is that affordable health care should only be available to the deserving few, so the purpose of the health care delivery system (ie, the insurance companies) is to prevent people who do not deserve care from getting it.     There is no price too great to pay to prevent every last undeserving person from accessing health careeven if it means a great many "deserving" people do not get the care they need and even die because of itwhich is why we are willing to pay far more for the current system than it would cost to just pay for the care in the first place.   )|`|LZY9yDIfaa	There is no such thing as FREE health care.

But, to answer your questions, taxes are higher (though if you take healthcare costs, we are still better off as we do not pay for insurance unless we want to).

It is not about gender, it is about being violent toward another human being and it is wrong.
uwd1jCuBaa	well you can send just about anything. you can send food items, razor heads, deodorant, Tylenol, tobacco products, baby wipes, toilet paper, flavor pouches for water, electronics (make sure to get insurance on that), ummm...just about anything. nothing with alcohol in it, and there's other stuff but it all escapes me right now. there's a website that will tell you. you can google it. but you need his APO address so you can get the right lists. there's a website that you can order APO boxes and custom forms and packing tape from. and the boxes are flat rate so it doesn't really matter how much you stuff in there as long as you have APO boxes. and it is much cheaper and faster if you send it from a post office on base. it'll get to him in 7-15 days instead of 15 or more from a post office off post.     a nice thing to put in the care packages would be letters, pictures, home videos if you can make them. it always made my fiance's day when he got pics and videos.    my brother-in-law is in afghanistan as well. good luck to you and your family. and may your soldier stay safe.|`|DFwNXmDBaa	I'm sorry I don't exactly now, but if you go to your near USPS office they should know.|`|082vOBNKaa	Most APO/FPO addresses have the following general restrictions:        * Packages may not exceed 70 lbs. (Some zip codes have lower limits)      * Packages may not exceed 130 inches in combined length and girth. (This means if you have a package that is 100" in length and 40" when you measure around it, you cannot send the item)      * All packages must be sent via the U.S. Postal System. The post office also requires companies or individuals to hand deliver packages being sent to APO/FPO addresses. (This is one reason why many merchants won't ship to APO/FPO addresses.)      * Firearms, alcohol, perishable foodstuffs and certain hazardous items also are restricted. Each zip code has a more detailed list of the restrictions for certain types of products.

M3maZgdyaa	You are not in trouble. The check was written to you so you had every legal right to deposit it and the checking account will show how much you drew out to give to the nephew. He owes taxes in his name and that does not affect you at all. You have the person who purchased this scooter to witness the fact that he sold his own bike. And that he wanted the check written to you. He can't prove that he didn't owe you the whole amount for living expenses so tell his dad to leave you alone and talk to the lying son of his. It is his son he knows how he is.    Tax is separate from tile. That's why when you buy a car you pay tax, title and license. The tax slipped through the cracks.|`|UDxL7lPqaa	Uh huh.|`|pywffiyLaa	I have no idea how this would play out in court. I would guess it would end up in small claims court. If the scooter was only worth $900, I really can't see how a serious claim for damages could be much more than that.    I think the larger lesson here is not to get involved with the business dealings of low-lifes, even if they are related to you. If you must get involved, you can't trust them to do anything. You have to verify that everything gets done, and hold all the money until they do.|`|vGu6bcR9aa	The check was made out to you. You can't steal what's given to you.    He CAN try to sue you small claims by suggesting that the check was made to you for the reasons you state and that you DIDN"T give him the money you promised. You'd be called upon to prove you did and I suspect that weith all the silly things you did before then you didn't bother to get a receipt.    You can also claim the agreement for him to pay bills which he didn't pay. It's basically going to come down to who has more credibility with the judge.    But there was no criminal theft.|`|FZQ2KHDvaa	Your uncle would have to prove fraud.  In criminal court, it is, 'beyond a reasonable doubt'.  In civil court, it is, 'a preponderance of the evidence'.    As for the cashing of the check, you can't get in trouble for that.
vuzi75iiaa	with him signing the title they only can go after him for taxes. i think your good.|`|RgblqqxIaa	I don't see much a criminal suit here.  Possibly a civil suit.  He might be able to collect the money you cashed, since the bike was actually his and while he did "owe" you money, since you didn't collect it from him every month family members generally are treated as "freeloaders" by courts unless you can prove otherwise (i.e. him paying you previously).  If you have an oral agreement in regards to the money that he owes you then that could be beneficial.  But fraud and theft are crimes that require you to have intended to commit them - you can't commit accidental fraud or accidental theft.

fpv8IV3Haa	honestly, I had a ticket almost the same but mine was parking in a apartment parking lot across the street from the hospital. My excuse was my friend was pregnant and there was no parking on the street near the emergency entrance. I wasn't lying about the excuse but i still lost. The economy is terrible as you know so you know that they need the money. I'm not trying scare you but your chances are little to slim. good luck|`|kCwhs8Reaa	Same as the first two, if you have no way of proving you are the resident, it is kind of a lost cause.

I'm afraid they got you dead to rights ... pay the fine.    If no permit was required, there might be some room to dispute the ticket.  Did a resident of the building park your car there?  If not ... was a resident of the building in your car when you parked there?  If either of these situations is true, you could put forth the argument that your car was parked there for the convenience of the resident!  Unless a parking permit is required to park in the lot ... then unfortunately, you are pretty much hung.|`|ffJcrsmLaa	If you aren't a resident, and you didn't have permission from the owner of the property (if it's private property), then there really are no good reasons.

If there is such a thing that says you can't park in a "Residents only" space the people you were visiting should have told you about it. Was it posted where you could see the sign in the dark ? Were there any signs any place ?
63a5e4aa71cbea07611f89f87df0073eaa	The army is the backbone of the American military.  There are more soldiers and other combat support personnel in the Army than any of the other armed forces.  If it involves extended military engagements, ground war and infantry, the Army is the oldest (and among the best supplied) of the military branches.  The National Guard is actually a division of the Army where the governor of each state can 'call up' troops for state emergencies - but as you will have seen, they remain Army personnel and can be rotated overseas for deployments as well.      The Marines have a relationship with the Navy - Marines can serve as security on naval bases, weapons stations, US embassies and consulates, during naval deployments on naval vessels, and of course the Marines serve as one of the elite fighting forces whenever quick military intervention and international deployments are required.  Marines have been called 'first on the beach and last to leave'.  The Marines have also on occasion been considered to be 'last in line' for new weaponry, armor, etc - or at least that is a common complaint among the grunts (riflemen).  The Marine Corp Motto - Semper Fidelis -- Always Faithful.  The Marines do have aircraft and naval vessels, but with (some exceptions) they are mostly used to ferry and deploy Marines to hot spots.  Most Marine aircraft is designed to support a ground offensive.      The Air Force has both missiles, rockets, aircraft, and other military air and space responsibilities.  The Air Force tends to have the most technologically advanced weaponry and some of the most comfortable quarters (at least that's the rumor by other other military branches).  Enlistment in the Air Force can require higher math, science, and academic scores than some of the other branches.  Also, if you are red/green have another type of colorblindness - don't bother enlisting!    The Navy is the primary water-based attack force for the USA.  They project US military might into the seas and oceans across the world.  The Navy hosts both advanced aircraft and naval vessels, including submarines, battleships, aircraft carriers, etc.  The Navy also tends to be among the most technologically advanced branches of the service - and of course is the home of the Navy Seals.  Among the other branches, the Navy has some of the most interesting projects - including dolphin research and deep sea diving.    Each of the branches has their own Reserve Units - personnel who are not on active duty but do participate in readiness and training on a schedule during the year and can be 'called up' (activated) in times of military need.|`|eef0fd7a18ed1e8ac453b6086f666edfaa	Army are ground, they get station and base all over the World and The US. Boot camps Second toughest.   Marines have the toughest, but once your a Marine your always a marine. Some times they get stationed on ships, or embassy duty. So if you like to travel this might be a good option.  Air Force is the easiest. If you want a career in Airline industry. That's a good place to start.   NAVY is good for after service experience too. Maybe  a lot have out to sea travel. You might not like it.  The one you didn't mention was the Coast Guard. They usually get base somewhere in the US. which is nice if you don't like to travel the world to much.  As far college after wards they are about equal. A lot depends on your MOS in the service to whether you find a good job outside the service.|`|HFqiY6BGaa	air force is sneaky piloits,  army is reguar...,  navy is in the navy by the village people,  and marines are badass!|`|Yq2CUhtYaa	Army - ground forces.

When you ask which is the best, there is no correct answer. All of these patriots put their life on the line for us. My son is currently in the Army, been to IRAQ twice and is going through some extensive training that I am not allowed to discuss. Of course I believe in the ARMY. However, I have always admired the Marines! Anyone who can get down and dirty and get the job done is a winner. We have friends in the Air force. Have to say I wish I had followed a career direction that would have provided the opportunity to fly. And I was in the NAVY. What they are able to accomplish with the equipment available to them is amazing. The National Guard has certainly played a leading role in our current conflicts. Bottom line, you should be proud to serve in any of the branches. I know I am proud of them all.|`|Yw2Ynm0Daa	they do different things|`|af4d72c6339f8a97cd7f346b9bb5634faa	Some have nicer uniforms|`|oQBzf5tYaa	they each attack sovereign nations from a different viewpoint|`|PFEgx9sJaa	air force probably has the best life style.  im navy...its not all its cut up to be.  i know the marines train like, crazy.  im not certain on the army. think about the coast guard. or not joining...its not all that amazing.  it has it perks.  but there are other ways.|`|QEd4AC22aa	Here is the difference and I was drafted into the Army.  This difference is based on how tough they are and what is going to be expected of you.  Marines will test you and do it hard.  Army is next.  It is almost a tie between Air Force and Navy but I give the Navy the next nod then Air Force.    There is an exception with the Army and that is special forces such as Army Ranger.  That would then exceed the basic Marine.  And an exception with the Navy with Navy Seals.|`|jd1E4Szbaa	They are way different the army is more to do with land and navigation the navy has its little branches too like the navy seals are for top secret missions, the navy is more open water and more to do with the water, the national Guard is not really like the army air force or navy, they are used for more floods and thing that deal with the state you live in, Marines are the hard cores of all of them they are more physical and A LOT harder!!!! air force is like duh the air but they also deal with a lot of the mathematics part of everything if your looking for something that does not require so much physical fitness that's it but you have to be REALLY smart. Not for my opinion i love the marines! they are called " The Few, The Proud, The Brave Marines"|`|xwxEMWCFaa	navy wears bell bottoms.LOL.my younger bro is in the navy and i see his outfit. but they mostly deal with water and are great people within medical needs and helping every branch of military when deployed get well.they are the safest in my opinion military wise,it is not that intense.army,which my fiance and oldest bro are in,are very intense and has the most variety with jobs.they do extensive training in every job that they do and are basically the world police,that is why they have the most training and living bases out of all the military.it is the toughest of them all.the marines are kinda tough like the army,but they are branched with the navy,so they have their limits.where the army doesn't in what they do.air force is kind of similar to the army,but they are famous for air fighting,transporting,and etc.the all have regular jobs like civilian ones.but each goes through a different type of training according to their branch that allows them to be educated.in my opinion the army is the best.cause it makes you a real man or woman.they push you until you cannot be pushed anymore within every situation.it sets you for life in almost every aspect you can imagine.|`|I9SGKyqxaa	I'll give you the stereotypes (that have some basis in reality).      Navy - some occupations have higher pay than any other service and have more advanced technical training.  They go to sea and travel more (but less time in each place).  Their "military" standards (what you traditionally think of as military - physical fitness, neat and orderly, type "A" personality) rank with the Army as below the Marines and above the Airforce.  They place the most value in tradition and ceremony.    Army - The core of our military.  There is a lot of opportunity for greatness in the largest service and a lot of opportunity for slacking off.      Marines - Generally the most traditionally "military" of the services.  Marines have a lot of pride in who they are and tend to stay in the smallest of the services.  Consequently, advancement can be slow and difficult.  The premium they put on military virtue some times leads to a corresponding ambivalence toward intellectualism.    Air Force - There's a reason they are called the "hair" force and as the joke goes, they build a base by building a club and a bowling alley and then go ask for more money to build an air field.  They specialize in high tech fields, although their lack of austere conditions means less attrition and less oportunity for advancement.  If you are an officer, expect to make it to Lieutenant Colonel and then be stuck.

Kh4p4gPXaa	No,  the passenger will not be arrested.   Chances are,   you would be given a "fix it ticket"  giving you x number of days to get your plates up to date.    Some jurisdictions will tow your vehicle though,  and should this happen,  they are not required to drive you home (so have cab fare).    In any case,   unless you have outstanding warrants or are very belligerent,  you wont go to jail.|`|AA10112244	NO, the passenger is not going to get arrested, and nobody gets hauled to jail for expired tags.But, the driver an owner of the car will get in trouble, plus there will be charges for toeing the car, because they won;t let the driver continue on with old tags.

However, some jurisdictions will tow the vehicle if it is not registered and insured.|`|TtI7VtTfaa	No..|`|AA11558106	I haven't heard of anyone being arrested for expired tags. Maybe if she was pulled over for the tags, then was found to have an outstanding warrant, or illegal drugs, drunk, etc., then maybe she would be arrested.  I had expire tags, I was literally on my way to the DMV (pulled over a block away) and was only given a fix it ticket.  Hope that helps.|`|ktMefP0oaa	The driver gets the ticket, the owner gets to pay the tow fee and the flag on her license, the passenger gets to thumb it home.|`|84150d8c6cd9fc2e974272b0e0ddc3c3aa	The driver will be shot in the head.  The passenger will merely be shot in the leg.  LOLOL!!  What do you mean "bad tags"?  Expired?  Or Suspended?  Expired tags, but current insurance, will likely mean a ticket.  With no insurance, car may be impounded and towed as well as a no insurance ticket.  If tags are suspended, car will also be subject to impound.

Why, because all of the environmental restrictions and regulations simply make most heavy industry impossible in America.

We should punish the banks b/c they were doing what the Federal Government ORDERED them to do by making risky loans-b/c a house is a right guaranteed to all Americans, oh wait it's not. --Note sarcasim--<br>  <br>  The problem is that the government is TO involved in the private sectors dealings and they have little to no idea as to how these things work.  It's a great idea if your a socialist, but look to England and the fact that their WHOLE countries government is going BANKRUPT to see how well this works.

Bush doesn't even hold a candle to the tens of thousands of dead, and the 100s of thousands of wounded -- Johnson's legacy to America.

But I think that he was definitely bad.

This was only the second attack on American soil (right? I don't know American history. I'm Canadian) and so he tried his best to recuperate and heal an ailing nation the best he thought he could.

Then, she filed for divorce and successfully convinced the judge that the entire $25,000 cost had to come from his share of the divorce estate.    Was she charged with filing a false police report?  No.    While he was in jail, she got a protective order barring him from coming with 1/4 mile of the house -- which she proceeded to strip of all his pre-marriage belongings which she then gave away to her coke supplier in settlement of her habit's debts.

He said he disagreed with there being such a broad ban on capital punishment only applying to cases of murder, and that states should be allowed to consider it as an option in severe cases. There is a difference. It seems like almost none of the previous answerers actually read the article you posted.    Aside from that, I agree with his actual statements. While capital punishment exists in this country, it should be a viable option if the crime is severe enough, which should include rape/molestation (not abortion as some of the murderous extremists posted). But there still needs to be a line drawn and a burden of proof. There still needs to be a way to prevent falsely accused or arrested persons from facing that kind of punishment.|`|NI0cNU22aa	Castration followed by hanging seems the most appropriate to me.

If a rapist knows he is going to get the death penalty you remove all incentives to keep his victim alive.

If child molestation was a capital crime, yes there would be fewer cases of molestation, but unfortunately there would be more child murders.|`|58EydBwwaa	Wow.

I might add that the age of 6 to 8 is absolutely ridiculous what about the infants that have been raped?  So I think all of them should be executed regardless of the age.    Lets face it, there is honor among thieves even a career crimminal has a code of ethics when it comes to child molesters/sexual predators and they usually meet up with a up with a with a shank to the neck or other parts of the anatomy. LoL!     Obama has not said that he believes it exactly that way.  "Do you agree with President Obama that Child Molesters should get the death penalty?"  Former Massachusetts governor gave a dispassionate, almost clinical, recitation of his opposition to capital punishment, arguing there was no evidence of a deterrent effect.  The above statement by Michael Dukakis is what Obama was speaking of in the below response that he will not openly state a case that way and goes on to reiterate that if the state imposes that penalty  then they should be allowed to do it./ See below  If there were any doubt, Barack Obama made clear at a news conference today that he won't fall into that trap.    Asked about today's US Supreme Court ruling that sentencing someone to death for raping a child is unconstitutional, Obama said he disagreed with such a broad ban.     "I have said repeatedly that I think that the death penalty should be applied in very narrow circumstances for the most egregious of crimes. I think that the rape of a small child, 6 or 8 years old, is a heinous crime," he said, adding that if a state determines the death penalty should apply in such cases, they should be allowed to impose it.|`|RgblqqxIaa	In case anyone cares - the US Supreme Court has deemed that any crime that is not murder cannot involve a punishment of death.|`|rttm1SLaaa	No, I don't.  I don't believe the death penalty should be applied to anyone for multiple reasons, mainly that it costs this country more to execute a person than to imprison them for their entire lives and that the death penalty is a really terrible system for dealing with criminals in a society that professes to be a democracy.|`|IUXriZQJaa	Well, at least something I can agree with him on.

Something O'reilly and Obama can agree on. The O^2 people.|`|56db1a8e5fe3dfc4d4fbbbff987d0191aa	Yes.  They cannot be rehabilitated.  They get caught, spend time in jail, get released, then commit the crime again.  Unfortunately, convicted child molesters turn to killing the child, so they will not be caught again (Or so they think)  In other words their mental problem or whatever it is gets worse as time goes on.|`|asX2hxFXaa	In the context he put it (a 6 or 8 year old child), I can support it.    I would never support it in the case of a 16 year old crying rape by a 20 year old because there are just way too many cases of that being a lie...or it was consentual but then the 16 year old changed his/her mind and cried rape.    An 8 year old would never comprehend the notion of declaring rape for vengeance, I think.|`|lY5YDFizaa	yes absolutely|`|8tf5rOXdaa	I agree that child molesters should get the death penalty.|`|444pPdy5aa	Yes    So should rapist, murderers, abortion doctors.|`|I6dcRgD6aa	It said rapists of children age 6-8 if that is judged to fit the crime. This does not say 'child molesters should get the dealth penalty". There are many people who are considered child molesters so it would be ridiculous for him to say such a thing. I knew that before I read it & it is obvious after reading it he said no such thing.|`|U1pMvDvgaa	Yes, this is the first time I have heard Obama make sense.|`|mdHqr17kaa	no    denunciations of people as child molesters has been used in the---recent---past under some regimes as a way for those in power to rid themselves of political enemies.      and dagger is unfortunately incorrect in believing that a small child could not be influenced into "informing" upon his caregivers or others in his community.    let's say that laws are passed declaring that all wealth of an  executed criminal reverts to the state......see where that goes?    furthermore Obama does not believe that the death penalty is a deterrent but rather serves as a means for "the community" to vent "outrage"---in such cases their true outrage is against an oppressive government, and some unfortunate soul has simply been condemned as a sacrifice; AND in this system, where "justice" is executed according to community demand rather than LAW, the "community" becomes demoralizingly culpable.....and what if the condemned is exonerated later by the Ministry of Information?      Obama is an authoritarian whose associates and environments throughout his formative years incorporated concepts regarding individual human life that are quite different than those assumed by most Americans.|`|q3Vo1s2caa	Is this sharia law?

Some Democrats like Al Sharpton and Jesse Jackson encourage some blacks to blame white people for all of their problems and that they are being victimized because of the color of their skin. You had Hillary Clinton and Geraldine Ferraro race baiting Obama during the primaries.    Than you have Republicans like Ronald Regean, Rush Limbaugh, and Newt Gingrich who blame black people for taking advantage of all of the welfare.

AA11565799	Governors have a different agenda from members of Congress and Senators.  A governor has to worry about how his/her state is going to keep the programs that it has.  Raising taxes in this economy is not smart and tax collections, both income and sales, have to be way down.  So governors are more easily swayed to support anything that will help out their state.  The federal budget is simply a trough that a good governor has to try to get his or her snout into.|`|di43MlSFaa	"NEW YORK (AP)  Most Republican governors have broken with their GOP colleagues in Congress and are pushing for passage of President Barack Obama's economic aid plan that would send billions to states for education, public works and health care.  Their state treasuries drained by the financial crisis, governors would welcome the money from Capitol Hill, where GOP lawmakers are more skeptical of Obama's spending priorities".    "The 2008 GOP vice presidential nominee, Alaska Gov. Sarah Palin, scheduled meetings in Washington this weekend with Senate Republican leader Mitch McConnell of Kentucky and other senators to press for her state's share of the package.    "Florida Gov. Charlie Crist worked the phones last week with members of his state's congressional delegation, including House Republicans. Vermont Gov. Jim Douglas, the Republican vice chairman of the National Governors Association, planned to be in Washington on Monday to urge the Senate to approve the plan".    "Clyde Frazier, a professor of political science at Meredith College in North Carolina, said it wasn't politically inconsistent for Republican governors and members of Congress to part ways on the stimulus plan.  "For governors, it's free money  they get the benefits and they don't have to pay the costs of raising the revenues," Frazier said. "Senators and representatives get only some credit for the expenditures, and they have to pay the bill."    "Louisiana Gov. Bobby Jindal, a former member of the House, said he would accept the stimulus money but would have voted against the bill if he were still in Congress. Mississippi Gov. Haley Barbour, a former chairman of the Republican National Committee, said he wasn't sure whether he would accept the approximately $3 billion his state would be in line for".    "The most outspoken critic has been South Carolina Gov. Mark Sanford, who has warned for months of a steep spike in inflation and a severely weakened dollar if Obama's plan passed. His state is on track to receive $2.1 billion of the stimulus money; Sanford has not yet said whether he would accept it".  Associates say Sanford, who recently was elected chairman of the Republican Governors Association, has been disappointed in how few of his GOP colleagues have joined him in speaking out against the size and scope of Obama's plan.    "Minnesota Gov. Tim Pawlenty, who is widely viewed as a potential presidential contender in 2012, said governors have little choice but to accept the relief being offered. "States have to balance their budgets," he said. "So if we're going to go down this path, we are entitled to ask for our share of the money."  But Pawlenty expressed reservations about the cost of the plan and its impact on the federal deficit, which has already grown to over $1 trillion.  http://www.google.com/hostednews/ap/arti...    Five Democrat Govenor's have participated in a push for the stimulus package to be passed.  http://www.tennessean.com/article/200901...  http://www.knowledgeplex.org/news/286740...

The gov't engages in deficit spending when the economy is in a recession. the gov't borrows money to finance deficit spending  in theory, the extra funds should stimulate business activity, pushing the economy into an expansion phase. as the economy recovers, revenues should increase, providing the gov't with a budget surplus. the gov't then can use the surplus to pay back the money it burrowed.  the economy has interconnected parts that make it more complicated than just spending

LOL!    Alaska (which is one of few states with NO Budget deficit by the way) always needs federal help and they should get it because much of Alaska is federal land and Alaska is used for many National uses. Alaska doesn't have the population to pay for all the infrastructure required to cater to the nation.    Florida has had a massive influx of illegal aliens chasing construction jobs for hurricane reconstruction, and now they are about out of those jobs.    You glossed over the biggest losers, now didn't you? Michigan? Pennsylvania? New Jersey? Connecticut? Delaware? Hawaii? Illinois? Maryland? Massachusetts?, Minnesota? New Hampshire, New Mexico? New York? Ohio? Oregon? Rode Island? Vermont? Washington? Wisconsin?  Most of those states with budget trouble are democrat states.     Nearly ALL of the states without deficits right now are Republican states. Including Alaska, Colorado, Idaho, Indiana, Iowa, Louisiana, Maine, Missouri, Montana, Nebraska, North  Dakota, Texas, Utah, West Virgina, Wyoming.    Look at the states who increased spending for 2009 which also had a deficit, those are almost ALL democrat states.|`|lvBUl3Zdaa	When things were good, red states like Texas were on the receiving end of tax dollars.

Republican conservatives took a big hit under the most liberal administration we've ever had, that would be the Bush administration.  More money was spent by W than many presidents combined.  Now, to be fair, he didn't do it all by himself, the congress had to approve it and they were democrats at the end.  The bottom line is we don't have conservatives in power anymore.    As for why republican led states are going under?  I can't speak for any other states other than California, but California's problems started in the 70's when we passed Paul Ghann's little bomb, prop 13.  Now homeowners don't pay much in property tax, but school children can't afford proper books and the state thinks they should control and oversee every little thing a teacher does.  Oversight may be necessary at some level people, but IT COSTS A LOT OF MONEY and is WAY OVERDONE!        Generally, business goes in on the side of Republicans and states with high rates of business usually are republican controlled, those states would be hardest hit by the economic downturn and thus their tax base is decreased, their spending, in many cases, is fairly fixed due to a variety of factors and therefor they need money to survive.  The other states have learned to livte with less or are more flexible in how they can spend their money.|`|ayhDyb16aa	Because every single State and municipality that is in severe fiscal trouble has a Democratic legislature , mayor or city council.|`|OYtoM9fXaa	You might want to look again.

85kWzSzuaa	The Iraq war was not a part of any stimulus package...When exactly did you become completely unhinged? You really need a hug.|`|rttm1SLaaa	Your dollar total is way off and you don't quantify the amount spent on some of these.  Allow me to elaborate:  The money spent on banks amounted to 350 billion to start, but that number eventually rose to almost a trillion dollars.  The bailouts of Wall Street and AIG were lumped into that sum, and we still don't know exactly how much was spent on them.  The Iraq War is tough to quantify because it was never on the budget.  In fact, that's how he sold it to Congress in the first place - they never had to place it on the budget, so he could just start it with a general approval.  The estimate is at least another trillion dollars, which is not factored into the budget deficit, nor the national debt.    I like your point, but the issues he caused were far more severe than those you presented here.  And people are worried about 825 billion dollars that go directly towards helping our economy and our people.  Makes so much sense, doesn't it?|`|3yXhtBSxaa	I think you're a bit confused on the numbers and what went on for that stimulus.  Bush may not have been a great President, but at least he knew what a stimulus package was.    Obama is putting us 1.3 TRILLION dollars (that's how much this will be with the added interest) in the hole for atv trails and billions of dollars worth of kickbacks.    Bush's stimulus didn't do anything to hurt the economy.  He was paying back what we were overtaxed in the Clinton administration.    This fiasco Obama, Pelosi, and their ilk have created will completely destroy what little we have left.|`|pnpkJKvpaa	They were just bailouts, not stimulus packages.     The Obama bill is a true stimulus package.|`|Yw7YgG0Kaa	A "tad', hon.   Compared to Obama Huessin's.    (Gosh, China Guy, you keep getting hammered on your Questions.

From what I remember the Dems in Congress voted for all this.  Yes, they even voted for the Iraq War.  Remember I voted for it before I didn't vote for it.      But Bush was so Intelligent, he fooled them into it.  Something that President BO could not do with a single person on the other side.|`|AA10818613	Wasn't it 700 billion to the banks in 2008?  You forgot Bear Sterns, one of the first ones to receive money and that was well before the big 700 billion was promised.  AIG got two packages.  Ugh, just let wallstreet go under.  This country can do better.  They aren't serving any purpose except to those on wall street.  They already spent our 401k's and stock funds.  I think we are smart enough to come up with a better investment system than this.  The other huge issue is all the mergers that occured after the big 700 billion banking bailout.  We need anti-trust laws pushed by the Obama W.H.      From Ralph Nader's site and worth reading:  A brand new paperback Why Wall Street Cant Be Fixed and How to Replace It: Agenda For a New Economy by long-time corporate critic, David C. Korten will explain some of the wheeling and dealing.     You dont have to agree with all or many of Kortens nostrums. Just read Part IIThe Case For Eliminating Wall Street. He considers three central questions:     First, do Wall Street Institutions do anything so vital for the national interest that they justify trillions of dollars to save them from the consequences of their own excess?     Second, is it possible that the whole Wall Street edifice is built on an illusion of phantom wealth that carries deadly economic, social, and environmental consequences for the larger society?    Third, are there other ways to provide needed financial services with greater results and at lesser cost?     http://www.nader.org/index.php?/archives...

This occurs naturally every day, and more when their are such happenings as forest fires, and volcanoes. Rotting vegetation around the world emits gases on a huge scale, and it's happening all the time, especially in the worlds oceans.    Without those huge amounts of pollutants, life on earth would have never been.    One volcanic eruption spews more pollution in carbon particulates and gasses into the air in hours, than all mankind can do in decades.    You know what the terrible side effects of all this polluting is? Plants can grow much better in areas that have been ashed over. Our most fertile farm land is a product of this pollution.    Do you know what happens in a high pollution city when you remove the source for a week? Clean air, clean as out in the boonies. China did this. All that pollution is nothing on a global scale. The earth deals with it, and it's gone as if it never was.    Now the things which the Clinton administration ignored in it's time? Poison in our water and poisoned land from extremely toxic substances is different, but those assholes are spending so much energy on global warming that those things which are really damaging to the environment don't get much attention.    Bush's administration allowed 8 times less ppm arsenic water levels than Clinton did during his administration.

I have been watching "Engineering an Empire" recently and it is just one powerful empire after another snuffed out.    One of the most interesting things so far to me is Alexandria where the most brilliant minds were documented in the library there. They have been discovering all kinds of inventions through archaeological excavation that prove there was a far greater understanding of physics and technology than previously thought. The library of Alexandria was burned down. ALL OF THAT information lost to later generations. The Church rising up and persecuting people for trying to "re-learn" the sciences, and then the "dark ages," all the way up until the steam engine is finally realized in Britain over a thousand years after a Greek had harnessed the power of steam.    The engineering of the Aztecs was hidden until fairly recently because the Spaniards basically buried their empire under their own. People witnessed the destruction of the Buddhist statues in Afghanistan by the Taliban. That is gone, and the only way people will know it was ever there is through books, etc. But like in Alexandria, all the books were burned. All that information and knowledge gone, and look how long it took to recover.     Surely the Egyptians, Babylonians, Greeks, Romans, Aztecs, etc. thought there civilizations would last forever as well. This world order that exists now is undergoing tremendous strain. If this country was invaded, or what if the government decided to burn books and the Constitution, and do everything they could to wipe this country's memory away? Could the Indians have thought Europeans would arrive and do what they did to their cultures? What about all the black people in America whose ancestor's name would be unrecognizable and alien to them?     Oh, sorry, the answer is no, it will not.    >Edit: As far as the "Life, Liberty, and the Pursuit of Happiness". Look how it has already been distorted? People use that phrase now to describe what the government is suppose to "provide" and I am referring to the "means" to achieve these instead of the protection against the things that would inhibit this pursuit. "Freedom" has been twisted to mean, "freedom from want". "Constitutionalists" are called radical. The Bill of Rights is treated like some arbitrary outdated concept. The United States is one thing, but the American ideal has always been another, and that is the only thing that needs to survive, and that is what is in the greatest danger.|`|mUMMLjDdaa	outstanding question polar bear, america will not last forever. i think  someday america will elect another president by the name of bush,  far distant in the future and then we are gone.|`|JRQaCsevaa	Personally, no|`|VXtTGe4Laa	No I don't either.

5zBEU99kaa	Of course!  Israel has set it self up to be a "Jewish State". As is the case with every religious regime that has ever been set up on the face of the earth, those who are not members of the Regimes approved religion, if allowed to live, are given only given limited rights.    In the Jewish Regime of Israel, Christians, Atheists, Muslims, and non-rabbinic Jews have limited rights. They are not eligible for most Government benefits programs, may not purchase property, are openly disciminited against in the Job market, subject to harassment, and a host of little indignities like a non-jew ID,  non-Jew license plates. So far Israel has not required non-Jews to wear a badge or emblem on their clothes so they can be easily identifed but the idea has been discussed more than once.    Brandon:      I will be moving into your house Monday.. I will let you pitch a tent in the back yard if you want, of course if you come into the house I wil have no choice but to shoot you as an invader. You may not hook up a hose to the house water supply, or wires to the electrical supply, and you will have to take the tent down should I decide to throw a bar-b-que or have some friends over.      Of course if you don't like this set up, you can leave if you like.|`|AA10405801	No.  They have the same rights as Jews and other groups in Israel..|`|3KXBzSzfaa	Perhaps you should focus on American discrimination this is not the international section.|`|lRTe3AnBaa	Arabs living in Israel are treated much better then Christians and Jews living in Arab countries.

9cpKYneZaa	Because they're hyper-sensitive and angst-ridden.    Let's face it folks. If you don't like abortion, you just don't like it. Its your right not to like it.    As for the rest of your question, ZPG has been a wide-spread concept around the world since before the 1970's. China tried to limit birth rates through a 1 child policy. But they did it out of necessity.    The fact is, I don't particularly like abortion myself, but I support the right to choose. Plain and simple as that. No different than the right to decide whether to have children, how to raise them, and how to school them. Parents and families have a right to be left alone when it comes down to fundamental personal matters. The government and the states have no compelling reason to interfere in such basic, personal rights.|`|0f6a1cdae0a3ce3617b1109a091741bdaa	Any time a person allows a high moral standard to be subverted in favor of public policy, the country loses. History has proven that statement time and again. In every single case, the fall of a major society has occurred when people of high moral standards stood by and did nothing as their beliefs were cast aside....as people with little or no morals were allowed to proliferate their views and set public policy. Wrong is wrong...and that does not change just because someone chose to make it legal.|`|84059953db605b032d680002df0b2a4faa	Calling pro-choice people "pro-abortion" has more shock value.|`|54fdf2affdc8dc366315eec2cecd5920aa	I never heard of "pro-abortion" meaning "compulsory universal abortion."  Even China doesn't go that far; though they do have forced abortions.  If you think abortion should be permitted, you are pro-abortion, perhaps reluctantly, perhaps apathetically, or perhaps enthusiastically.  But pro-abortion.  Similarly, a person who is against abortion is anti-abortion.  These are neutral terms, and they shouldn't offend anybody.  Pro-abortion people, of course, prefer to be called "pro-choice," while anti-abortion people prefer to be called "pro-life."|`|bQLQdRBZaa	The same reason the same right-wingers label all liberals as atheists, blacks as criminals, Muslims as terrorists, etc., etc., etc.    Bigotry and hate.|`|170c8a77f6030f45fedeed6a6258a433aa	The cause referred to as "pro-choice" favors allowing abortion with little or no restrictions, so pro-abortion would also be a correct description. True pro-choice would recognize that the choice is made at the time of intercourse. To claim that you are morally opposed to something but that it should be allowed is hypocritical. That's like saying you are opposed to rape but if someone wants to commit rape no one has the right to stop him.|`|cf5961a316debfb7203fffd630bd740caa	because pro-lifers have no logical or medical facts to back up their side, so they have to distract from that by demonizing pro-choicers. it's pathetic.|`|A5RunUIkaa	Because they are. You're either pro-abortion or anti-aborition. If you're "pro life" you're anti-abortion and if you're "pro-choice" you're "pro-abortion". It is what it is. They're synonyms. Don't make too big a deal out of it.

This will take care of the monies owed part of her complaint.  File a complaint to the police about her battery against you and file a civil law suit for battery.  She committed a harmful or offensive touching, which is a battery.  You can use the civil suit as leverage for keeping the dog, or if that issue goes away, you can get some monetary damages from her to alleviate the trouble that you went through.|`|1hinQlz2aa	Well for the television sets, show the police the recites, if you still have them. As for the dog, I don't think there is much you can do for that. You can accuse her for assault though...I say buy a better dog with the money you get off her.

Listen to Martin Feldstein, the conservative economist.|`|1219d6000cca01c9f3c4489d1c7b4a16aa	Printing money devalues currency and has a danger of making a country's money completely worthless if abused.  This is why it's not done often.    I agree, a tax holiday for up to a year for everyone making $100K or less generates trillions for consumers to spend and jump start the economy.  Plus, they will be more able to pay off loans, rate of foreclosure could drop, these are key things we need to fix the economy.  As it is, printing all this money is like a backdoor tax, because it devalues the money we already have.

Cutting taxes MORE will put us in debt as well.    Problem with saying "cutting taxes" is that everyone likes the way it SOUNDS, but no one can tell us exactly what should be cut or where we're going to get the revenue to make up for the cuts.    Also keep in mind that over the past years nearly all the tax cuts went to those with the most money; and you see how well THAT has turned out.    I'm all for cutting spending but we need to hear WHAT to cut and not just make it lip service.  SOME spending actually is GOOD for the economy.  It's the WASTE which is harmful for all    Another issue with "stimulus" as opposed to "tax cuts" is that of IMMEDIACY.  They essentially do the same thing; they funnel money into certain parts of the economy and must be funded somehow.  A tax cut could take years to really make a difference.  Ideally, this will be like years of tax cuts made at once.    Edit:  Pfo, tax breaks DO create debt unless you reduce spending by at least the same amount.  Look at the debt created in the W admin.  As I said, I'd like to reduce spending but so far all the people saying "reduce spending" don't have a reasonable plan to actually DO so.
AA11124254	No, there is absolutely no problem here.  You were in your own residence and were protecting yourselves.  You in no way assaulted them nor threatened them if you never pointed the weapon in there direction.  The mere presence of a firearm does not constitute assault so do not worry about it.  If they do complain, simply explain the facts clearly to the police.  If you truly are worried they will complain, you can call the police first and file a complaint about their presence so it will be on record.|`|VUgCSQ6Daa	Door to door salesmen are a pain, huh?|`|RkfIPD7Iaa	If she legally owns the gun, she should be okay, but she may have to explain it to the police.  You can't just go waving guns around and not expect to get a visit.|`|LWzrCu5caa	The term is "banishing a gun."   That means to show it in a manner that is meant to intimidate or otherwise cause fear in another person.  It does not matter if she pointed the gun at them or not.  From the response you said they had,  it is clear that she intimidated and caused them fear.  So yes,  they can report it.      You need to put a sign on your door that says "NO SOLICITING" as that will stop all the door to door salesmen and hopefully the missionary types too.       You also need a locking screen door or security chain lock on the main door.  That way you can open the door and still have a lock between you and them.  If they rip open the screen door or push against the main door in such a way as to break the chain lock,  they have just broken into the house.  Then you can use the gun,  which you KEPT OUT OF SIGHT to protect yourselves as it will be clear they broke in.       But keep that damn gun out of sight!!!!   If they have not broken in you are in violation of law to banish it!!  If they do break in,  they do not need to see it until you aim it!|`|84H5kMD7aa	if she has a license to have the gun, there really shouldn't be a problem since no guns were fired.|`|0iJSa2c1aa	Your roommate has no reason to worry. She has the right to bear arms (in her home, anyway, ha) and if they attacked and she shot them, it'd be self-defense.|`|Uaci5YXWaa	It depends on the state.  'brandishing' a weapon is usually illegal, but they are in your home, so in some states you could drop them if they tried to enter.|`|eHHp4tulaa	These guys were the aggressors, but she needs to have her paperwork for the gun. Tell her she did the right thing, they did not need to be aggravating her or you. What they were doing was illegal. So rest easy, but get documentation for the gun or get a legal one. It is all right to protect yourself. As for these guys reporting her I don't think so, they were in the wrong.|`|TqYqQgxEaa	well i don't think they are going to say anything since they know they were wrong on being aggressive because they changed their mood when they saw the gun. I don't think shell be in any trouble, it is self defense plus she didn't kill anyone lol, so just be careful with the creeps and maybe you should report to the police and get a neighbors opinion and see if they thin the same about the guys that way the more complains about them the better you and your friend are if they try something funny, because you let the cops know....good luck:)|`|63e413147f262ec68d5946ef36ffb354aa	As long as she has lawful right to possess the gun there should be no problem.  You are permitted many liberties when you are in fear.  These men acted in such a way that she felt it necessary to prepare to defend herself.  It is all perfectly legal.  Perhaps these men will learn how to behave better in the future.|`|fe73dc32e71ef5846abbf8e72834c313aa	She likely won't get in trouble, if you haven't been contacted by the law by now you probably won't be.

Good luck to you.|`|0d98b44d962e705484337a48e0b25b85aa	Your roommate has the right to defend herself especially within the confines of her home.

Though with good behaviour it would prob be more like 25!|`|b1256d852b56b556e6bb26806d1c64eaaa	2 life sentences is probably the equivalent of "life without parole" - one life sentence is usually 25 years, so 2 life sentences would be 50 years - or the rest of your natural life behind bars.|`|kH0IxFa9aa	LOL  They say this because long time go, they gave a guy what was considered a harsh sentence. Well he lived longer, because people are living longer. And they had to set him free.    Also. There happens every once in a while that if someone is put to death, they die and in the morgue they come back to what is, to what is considered another life. They died once and can't be tried again.    Also. Some prisoners die in jail. They come back to life also in the morgue. If they have extra life sentences, authorities don't have to go through the process of releasing them. The prisoner just begin the other life sentence.    Now if you are the "Immortal one" and can put yourself to death and can be raised before they bury you. You have then set a new precedent.|`|c07v7O80aa	"Life" doesn't often mean until you die. It can work out to a 60 year sentence or so and be further reduced by parole. Different states have different maximum sentences and different ways of calculating time. And when multiple sentences are imposed, they may be run concurrent, meaning they are all running at the same time, or "stacked," meaning you might make parole or discharge one and then begin serving another. You have to know both the state sentencing laws and the parole and discharge rules and calculation formula to know what a sentence means. And the time calculations can be involved, and an individual's time calculation can be a subject for appealing the prison's calculation of time.|`|9HdexsSCaa	"how do you serve 2 life sentence i.e for murder ?"

The "2 life sentences" nonsense is so the relatives of the murdered or the raped can say they got justice. They can't say "Hey--what about MY f***ing dead kid!"  Same thing with the "life sentence" label in the UK, for a 20 year (or whatever) sentence. It's for the consumption of morons, to stop them complaining about inaction or indifference.

So, if they wanted to, I guess they could try.|`|0hrq96wqaa	It must certainly be acceptable to the US, or they'd have to admit double standards. How it's legal I'm not sure, because as you say, it's murder by machine. All above board to them apparently. Which is why the US is the biggest threat the world has ever faced.
DTSUJe2oaa	If the court system ever wants the death penalty to become a deterrence that would be the only way to do it, if a person watched another person strapped into an electric chair and a band placed over the condemned persons eyes so they don't pop out that would deter some from murder.~|`|dc4516b235fea803596d1fc6b3cee990aa	I can't see why not .It MAY make ppl think twice about a life of crime !|`|KMASS2Gmaa	Yes, they should be mandatory for students from 9th grade and above.|`|RgblqqxIaa	No, the constitutional right to privacy would more than likely prohibit this from ever happening.|`|RjUhISEIaa	NO|`|jsS03HSNaa	No, but I do believe that the law regarding death penalties should be stricter.  I think if that were to happen the crime rate would go down.  It could do no harm making people fear the law, instead of people going to prison for a better meal.  Or at least make all prisoners clean the highways.  Our taxes do pay for their "lifestyle."|`|8I4QY6osaa	This isn't 1792.  It's hard enough watching someone die, put to make to public?  uh-uh.

qEqMRTQkaa	Barry O is an empty suit.|`|cbIxKGZVaa	Yep he sure did Yes the US invented the Assembly Line for the Automobile but no we sure didn't invent the Automobile itself|`|D4XWrwuaaa	Yes, he did, although it is an incorrect statement.<br>  <br>  The first self-propelled road vehicle was a military tractor invented in 1769 by a Frenchman named Nicolas Joseph Cugnot. Cugnot used a steam engine to power his vehicle. The following year (1770), Cugnot built a steam-powered tricycle that carried four passengers, which is more likely the first "car" as we would know it.<br>  <br>  Then again, maybe Al Gore invented the car. After all, he did invent the internet (NOT) and global warming (TRUE).|`|RJDDC5Kgaa	Yes, he did even though it was invented in Germany by Mr. Benz.<br>  <br>  Anyway, it does not speak well for Harvard, where Obamahood got his law degree, and Bush got his MBA.|`|95gEZ22Caa	Detroit did invent the automobile metaphorically speaking.|`|t3QAaSN9aa	It's a matter of debate as to who invented the "automobile" but I would just as soon have our country take the credit as not.|`|MLYQh8bMaa	Yes, and btw, you not allowed to correct him, so just accept that it is truth.|`|C2HHfun2aa	Yes and also during the campaign he said there were 57 states and that he could be president for 10 years! And they said Bush was stupid.  <br>  <br>  Obama and Biden Dumb and Dumber. Hey that would be a good campaign slogan when the run for re-election since the whold hope and change and yes we can thing will be old, tired, and have absolutely no meaning.|`|iLkSVmSqaa	Yes he did.  Such a smart man with an IQ of 135 and taxpayer funded degree from Harvard should know better.  <br>  <br>  Look at his followers on this answer thread that actually believe what he said.  The worst part of it all is that Congress gave him a standing ovation after his statement!!!  The people who utilize your hard earned tax dollars!!|`|ZvcjUVsXaa	Well, he should have said "could have" invented. That would have been more accurate and entertaining.|`|N0iM1mo8aa	yep.  We also have 57 states.  He misspeaks often either out of ignorance or out of an attempt to mislead, not sure which.|`|HP53PqRCaa	Yes he did.  And he was wrong...AGAIN!  That idiot probably believes Al Gore invented the internet.|`|8EbJJ0zZaa	The things you people choose to care about makes me laugh.|`|iy9xz6oNaa	How can a country invent something? that would take a lot of coordination....|`|l5klWLwdaa	He is the great and powerful Obama.  How dare you challenge his right to dictate historical events as his opinion deems appropriate.<br>  <br>  Afterall, he is one of our most very impotent intellectuals.|`|qjH3Tigbaa	Yes, because we did.  We didn't invent the gas engine but we did invent the automobile.|`|AA11634870	Something like that , he meant probably the modern engine as example the catalytic converter as well as the internal combustion engine. I think he was going towards our American can do prowess.|`|hilEWrDYaa	Yes he did. My 8 year old grand child even laughed at that.<br>  <br>  I wonder if he could do a publicity stunt by driving that American invention to all 57 states.|`|tltloVKpaa	Sure did...He also said there is no ear marks in the pending bills.... Obama...Change we need.... I don`t think so|`|98EXXItdaa	Well, he has an extra 7 states to work with.. maybe the lord god Obama will declare that Germany is one of those.|`|gZEn8k6Saa	With all the lies you caught that one, good job. Yes he did, I lost track of what he was saying after the 787 Billlionth lie|`|u6MJPdT9aa	Yes, because he is a retard|`|WD6uLJxvaa	Yes, yes he did
odBWpML6aa	Short answer: yes.  Sad, but yes.  Very human.    Well, to answer your question. I wanted to reference self-delusion, but in the Wiki entry for Meglomania I saw the following quote that describes it all:    "For me, I was able to imagine myself as in a role of greater importance than I would seem to be ordinarily. At the time, I had some recognition. I was making some progress professionally, but I wasn't really at the top. I didn't have top level recognition, and so when I started thinking irrationally, I imagined myself as really on a Number 1 level. I was the most important person of the world, and people like the Pope would be just like enemies, who would try to put me down in some way or another, or the president."    Who said that?  John Nash, the genius mathematician whose biography is sort of told in the Russell Crowe movie "A Beautiful Mind".    He was schizophrenic, delusional, paranoid delusional.  But a genius, nonetheless.    Yet we are at great immediate danger from the level of insanity now apparent in our highest offices.  The few men and women of sanity have to stand their ground for us all.     Clearly what draws the morally insane to run for office is the criminal and civil immunity granted de jure and de facto for those in high office.  A President for example, can get away with rape!      Yet what more perverse zeitgeist has filled our nation that the whole of  Senate and most of the House is insane, insane *mentally*!  For no sane explanation exists for these massive, huge, super-massive "bailouts".    They are a ruin to us!      But still, courage to all the sane, may G-d help us!  Stand your ground.|`|xqq8rHjkaa	SOCIALISM!|`|t82AcQT1aa	Reality and Truth is something they avoid. They went off to see the wizard and haven't come back yet.|`|QvF8dR7Taa	that's the truth,political correctness run amuck,like a friend of mine always said some people don't want to distort the issues with facts.seems now days it you don't swallow the party line you have something wrong with you.no matter how radical or debased that line might be|`|m1q0vb6waa	Yes. this does not say they are right|`|7PTZJ74vaa	The short answer is yes. They see themselves as the saviors of the working and middle class. Although truth be told so far they have help no one. Since they took control of the house and senate I have had four jobs either lay me off or close completely. To add insult to injury the job I have now has cut my pay rate by 1/3 and cut my hours. To top it off these same bone heads (Barney Frank Obama and the rest) are handing money out to every moron that got us into this mess. Obama does not have a chance in you know where of getting us out of this mess. In addition they want to spend my tax dollars to pay for killing babies. They dont seem to get the fact that it is not their money, its ours. Very few on capital hill have any idea what it is like to stand in a factory all day doing something you cant stand just to keep a roof over your kids heads. I say make them all work an assembly line for about a year at factory wages. Ill bet then they give a little more thought to how they spend our money!|`|73d2c6050e09443b51029990dda007d4aa	They are beyond the point of logic and reason. They live in an isolated world where their fantasy is more real to them than anything else.|`|636L1P5Zaa	yes|`|pezw43BMaa	She thinks her **** don't stink, so to speak.|`|AA12225989	Nancy Pelosi is going to run amok without Cheney there to dickslap her.|`|EhvulfKraa	Yes, they do and the morons that vote them back agree...amassing!|`|f67808ac545b2885ffe31dea6fdd1673aa	of course.

Why is it the [little] people can't make a simple mistake]?|`|GGJ8T6uYaa	Sure Daschle knew about it, just like Tim Geithner knew about his "mistake."  Geez, considering who these guys are, they surely should have known .|`|AXNkmdbKaa	Another stupid mistake.  Do you think anything will come of it?  Will he have to pay interest?  Penalties?

Any "mistakes" will be quickly swept under the rug.      The hypocrisy is sickening.|`|HXIIbVN8aa	Ole Tom cheated. He has been cheating the people for years. He has accepted so many gifts and payoffs it just isn't funny. He pushed the Ethanol subsidy like crazy because powerfull   (rich) supporters in his state wanted to start an ethanol plant there. What will you bet he got a piece of that action just as he got $1.000.000 annually, from other friends, to be a consultant to their company.  Given that Ole Tom has never been in business, what services do you think he was able to offer them?|`|dgyYTKe5aa	No, no, no, no....INNOCENT mistake, not stupid.  If he weren't under scrutiny now no one would know about him skipping his taxes and he had no way of knowing he would have a chance to be in a democrat president's cabinet.    You can't criticize him.....Rich republicans are the ones who are supposed to pay taxes, not democrats.
N0iM1mo8aa	I think it's a conflict of interest for so many of our elected officials to be bought by special interest groups and lobbyists.  AS to your assertion that all of these hold dual citizenship-how about some proof, other than their names.|`|W0VL46gDaa	"God Blesses Those Who Bless The Jews, And He Curses Them Who Curse The Jews"<br>  <br>  This is why we support Israel. <br>  If we turn our backs on them, its bye bye USA.|`|RJDDC5Kgaa	Obama's Chief of Staff Rahm Emanuel has served in the IDF.<br>  <br>  Face reality: Israel owns Washington.|`|3YRrGfkiaa	Looks like lots of those names are from past administrations, one.  Two, that appears to be nothing more than a list of Jewish politicians.  Most of those people are not dual nationals with Israel as far as a quick search turns up.  Mukasey isn't Israeli.  Neither is Bolton.  Or Libby.  Or Abrams.<br>  <br>  Edit: God, are you serious?  I AM a dual American/Israeli citizen, and I know exactly what the rules are.  Every person of Jewish ancestry is *eligible* for Israeli citizenship, but they do not possess that citizenship automatically - they have to actually apply for it.  This is called the "Law of Return" in Israel.  The Wiki for this law is here:<br>  <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Law_of_Return" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Law_of_Retu...</a><br>  <br>  You are claiming that all Jews are de jure Israeli citizens, and that's not only factually wrong, it's stupid.  The exception is people who have at least one parent who is an Israeli citizen - they ARE automatically Israeli citizens, but this is also true for many, many other countries.<br>  <br>  Why do ignorant people feel so free to call others ignorant?|`|5b85793bae21d013c789850655fa694caa	Being Jewish, even going to Israel doesn't make  you a dual citizenship.<br>  This is just another thinly veiled attempt to make people think that Jews are somehow inherently different from Catholics, who are not automatically members of Vatican City.  Or any other religion.<br>  And that Jews are not patriotic Americans, but rather suspect. With split loyalties.<br>  <br>  While its possible to obtain dual citizenship without renouncing the US, that's a possibility with many countries.  Time to stop the excuses for hate.<br>  <br>  I suggest you read other sources for your information in the future.<br>  Try to exclude aryan literature|`|AA10645437	Actually Adam B is correct.<br>  <br>  The mere fact that someone is Jewish does not make them an automatic citizen of Israel.<br>  <br>  You wish to dispute what Adam B says? Fine. Then please back up what you claim with facts from reputable sources. The burden of proof is upon you not us.<br>  <br>  And for the record, there are other members of the US government who have citizenship with other countries as well. Are you going to question them as well or just the Jewish ones?|`|AA11530144	Wow thats some list,you sure its America sounds like Israel,Im totally opposed to dual passports to me it means their not true citizens but undercover agents for whichever country they where not born in|`|2MfFXmNMaa	Any of those that you listed: if they have a US Secret or above clearance, they had to renounce their other citizenship.|`|H9BRSxa8aa	Of  course it is not good - now Israel is putting pressure on the US to attack Iran, lets hope Obama sees sense...|`|UpZFb6X5aa	No. By Israeli law all Jewish people have dual citizenship. An American of Jewish faith has no control over that.<br>  <br>  Only  bigots try to claim that is a "conflict of interest" Those trash are nothing but latter-day Nazis. They are anti-American bigots try to spread hate and undermine the religious freedoms our country is founded on. They are the ones with a conflict of interest--they don't have any loyalty to America and what we stand for. Theyneed to leave--they are not real Americans and do not belong here. And never will.

They are so worried about Fox News, Sean Hannity and Rush that they can't think straight.

If we don't get rid of the idiots wispering into the ears of the Patriots, what do we have, but puppets mouthing the words of the Puppetmaster?

So he is just a puppet for the party to have someone they can project what ever they want onto. I watched him on meet the press on Sunday & he lied about what happened with the levees blaming the army corp of engineers when in reality Clinton had them scheduled to do the work on the levees & he handed the almost trillion surplus to Bush who then cancelled the work saying we needed to cut the budget. That money disappeared & the work never got done. I don't understand how republicans can keep choosing these people who lie over & over again to them. Palin is in trouble again, this time she owes $7000 for ripping off the tax payers but she is more concerned about getting her daughter on tv to be the role model for teen pregnancy. The reps keep talking about dems who had tax problems but the reps have much worst problems & we all know Judd Gregg backed out cause he knew the transparency was going to mean he too was going to be outed. Jindal is known to have not done anything for the people of his state but he is the only one they have that is not known to have scandals or a religion that would freak out most American's. The man has nothing of value to offer except he has the R behind his name. When will republicans start caring for themselves & see that healthy neighbors are healthy for them & voting so greedy billionaires & liars like Jindal are not going to make our country better. When they see this they can be real patriots right now they are all about words with nothing to back the words. up.

You people enjoy the blanket of freedom that he and the military provides but complain about the way he provides it.    Paniciraq: WTF are you talking about?  He had 80 phuckin days in office before we were attacked! That is not nearly enough time for the funding to be re-introduced to the agencies and military that were raped under Clinton.

acWyJ3t0aa	According to the latest information received from the clan on the news after Obama's election , the Klan said that Obama's election was the best thing for the klan since its inception , so I would hate to burst your bubble , but the Klan is all for Obama and probably did and will vote for him again . According to the newcast , the klan said  their membership and gun sales had shot through the roof since the election and judging by the number of gun sales in Texas since the election , everyone has one now just so they can beat Obama to the point before he sends out his edict outlawing guns .|`|DYNaQ6Yzaa	The klan is of the Democratic variety - you know like the Klan grand wizard Democrat Bird.|`|WCkOUF9aaa	I live in Texas & we never even hear about the Klan unless I am reading something lame on YA.

A news caster went to philly and camden and asked all the black people if they liked "obamas" polices ans the black ppl were like yea we love them. the caster was really telling them mccain's polices so they obviously voted based on color. the news caster even asked "how do u like sarah palin, obama'  s v.p. candidate ?"  the black folk were like "we love her!" f***ing idiots|`|n1hnIBdeaa	I don't know, Did you get to vote this year?|`|rUn7TyQPaa	the election results is the answer.

K7x1RHVFaa	They get a warrant and confiscate your computer and read its hard drive looking for images stored on it. This happens a lot these days. I have heard of more than one teacher who has had this happen on the news and a few police too.    Basically they get a tip and act on it.|`|RRFbDou9aa	There is always a record of it on both their computer, their ISP, and the web sites themselves (and their ISP's).|`|uHmLkqmRaa	That's a good question. I don't understand how they'll ever catch people who download music and videos with stuff like Limewire.|`|RTBuK59Daa	Many sites are set up for law agencies to detect individuals downloading child porn.  The easiest way to get caught is to send it to someone else to view.  Chat rooms are full of cops acting as underage targets for perverts, and catch them all the time.  Anything sent across the internet can be traced back to the IP address where it came from, and where it has gone too. Better tell your friend if he is downloading child porn, he is not your friend, and he will be caught.|`|DRJ8CFElaa	Ok there are several methods of catching individuals involved in this activity, and most of it is ignorance of the user involved.    I am a IT for a webhosting company and have been working on computers and networks for for about 17+ years now.    P2P, most users are using P2P/torrents to download their illegal video games, movies, whatever it is. Most users forget the fact that they are leaving their "sharing" on. Generally when a user seeks out illegal content, they are painting a large target on themselves by sharing it hence law enforcement would likely go on "raids" and type in the obvious keywords, download the material, verify the content and the IP address (which can be obtained via several methods such as a packet sniffer or netstat since they are downloading directly from that user). From there, law enforcement has the evidence as well as the IP address.    The next step would usually be a call to the local ISP (Internet Service Provider) and file for a subpoena. The ISP hands over the customer information on the account, feds obtain a warrant for all electronic equipment capable of storing (flash, harddrive, tape, cd, etc.) and sent off to a forensics lab. The user is likely faced with charges of distribution as well as possession which carry hefty prison sentences and permanent sex offender registration.    The other methods of catching users are usually undercover agents posing on news groups. Users may be willing to "trade" with other users in a news group or a chat room to undercover agents, generally a user is charged with "pandering" by requesting or soliciting the material. Sometimes an agent may send out "fake" material that is not illegal but the user believes it to be. This will get a user charged with "attempting to receive" or "pandering". Once again, IP address is collected or a subpoena is done to Yahoo to obtain access to the user account and IP address.     Sting operations, feds may post false hyperlinks that pertain to be illegal content but actually do not contain anything illegal, this method was used back in 2006 and has been used in the past on forums known to contain pedophiles. IP's are usually logged though it's unknown how effective this method is due to the possibility of misguided traffic. It appears that only about 2 people have actually been convicted since this took place in 2006 due to the sheer number of IP addresses. The Hyperlinks generally would be hosted on a government server which the IP's are logged showing "intent" to download.     The other methods are usually websites that actually deal in the commercial distribution of obscenity with minors, most of these sites are likely overseas or possible free thumbnail galleries that are not regulated. The most likely case is that a user may stumble across a site by mistake (generally due to affiliating partners to that site) and a user ends up reporting the website to the webhost. The webhost may suspend the site and work with law enforcement depending where the server is located and law enforcement sift through the logs likely looking for repeat IP addresses and obtain subpoenas because of the IP's being in the logs. There was a large bust back in 99 or so which 100 of 140 people were arrested, it's unknown how many were actually convicted.    Generally when a computer is sent to forensics, it is analyed wth software known as EnCase which if a user formats or attempts to delete files, EnCase will copy the sector and reconstruct the original filepaths. Some data may be corrupted however fragments are enough to convict a person. It's also capable of pulling emails saved in outlook, webhistory and the page file which contains all that information. Sometimes if a harddrive has been tampered with or physically damaged, other methods are used via electron microscopy or MFM (magnetic force microscope). Even if you delete data, it's still physically on the drive and the only way to get rid of it is to physically degauss it. Others may claim overwriting of data 35 times will destroy it however MFM will recover the data although certainly making it more difficult to obtain, and your likely to be faced with obstruction of justice in the event you attempt to wipe the evidence while under investigation.    Furthermore, you asked about viewing it and not downloading the material. Courts do not distinguish the difference with viewing and downloading. Viewing means you had "control" of the material which means you can still be charged with possession.     I don't know what kind of pornography your "friend" is watching, but it sounds like he needs to make sure what he's watching is actually legal if he doesn't want to face years in prison and sex offender status permanently.
PI8VfiY1aa	Believe me my friend, we liberals WANT Sarah Palin to run again! Please, don't run any of your good candidates like Mitt Romney or Mike Huckabee.

I might even donate to her campaign.....??
jRtQTN24aa	Of course it will work, but not like they advertise it will. If you read the portions of the bill made public, the only stimulus comes to those being paid off for big time contributions to liberal democrats.

I also believe that WHEN the economy recovers, the democrats will take credit for it though they have no clue now (and will have no clue then) what happened.|`|cl9Ghxrlaa	Honey, they only have the talking points, not original ideas.

With less employed citizens, marks a reduction in the amount of revenues fulling to these entities. Its imperative to stimulate growth of funding by employing workers. Its a simply and yet reliable pragmatic avenue to bring back our economy. Doing nothing might be the worse action to take.|`|c8672da7ef4d6901656bd2ee445c88a0aa	Not me|`|1f6543187bec0a2b82a046b6a594e920aa	It won't work. The Government can't make the economy work. Only the free-market can do that. This whole financial crisis started decades ago, and was made worse by Alan Greenspan.    This stimulus package is going to put the U.S. into a depression instead of a standard recession.
fFpZEluIaa	Israel reminds me of someone who was constantly raped as a child, so they grew up to be a paedophile. What Israel needs to realise, is that there is no excuse for being a paedophile, all paedophiles should be executed, no matter how bad their childhood was. If you were raped as a child then you should know how it feels, and you should do everything in your power to make sure it never happens to anyone else. It doesn't mean you have the right to grow up to be just as messed up as the guy who molested you.|`|AA10405801	Israel does not commit terrorism.  Terrorists are mostly Muslims.

So ill finish this quickly.israel wont demolish till u.s. falls. Palestine will return to its rightful owners when the arabs grow some balls.( i mean the leaders such as presidents, not the civilians.) and i despise what israel is doing.

Neither is a good alternative to me.|`|1oxBCtmZaa	He's going to raise tax RATES - that won't necessarily raise tax REVENUE - when those same rates were cut, tax revenue went UP, as did the share of the income taxes being paid by the wealthy.|`|LiGWTLpSaa	He can't do it.<br>  <br>  But when this man speaks a lot of people go into hysteria and believe him.|`|reeU4N0eaa	maybe he will hold a craps game in the alleyway between the White House and Treasury Building.|`|2059629ba703ea51b813a449b0cb4431aa	He plans to tax the misuse of the Caps Lock key...I hope you've got your checkbook handy.|`|KashRDx2aa	pray to God for an answer

When I was in college, I'd always "hope" for an A+ and end up w/ a B or B-.  I  guess conventional knowledge is important to "some" degree.|`|3BhXf5MYaa	yup, taxing and spending will help the economy (NOT)|`|CbeNLpb3aa	He's not trying to - he is purposely destroying it.|`|1NPKAKk7aa	No. <br>  <br>  He is doing everything he can to support the american "worker".  and he is making it harder and harder for the american "employers" and american "investors".<br>  <br>  You know what will happen?<br>  <br>  Employers wont put up with his bull crap, and more jobs will be shipped to china.  Less jobs = less money for the government = higher taxes for the buisnessmen = even more jobs go to china. It's a nice big spiral downwards.  Good job obama.  moron.|`|9CoaKELzaa	Maybe he is, maybe he isn't.  Unfortunately we've never faced an economic crisis like this before so there is no manual or guide for how to successfully get the economy back on track again.  the truth is Obama can't do it by himself.  He has some good ideas that I like and I think they will be successful IF, and only IF, Americans step up and act just like Obama has done.  President Obama can only do so much to right the economy again.  He's now set a plan into action, let's see if Americans respond in a positive way to his plan...|`|AA11031560	Saving the American Economy is more than a one man job.

He's put it on the back burner because illegal immigration isn't a threat to either American jobs or the economy. Let's hope he gets to immigration enforcement soon though. We cannot afford to lose more tax payers or consumers of America. This country was built on immigration!|`|98EXXItdaa	Everything he's done thus far has HURT the US economy.

At least your getting paid to sit around and do nothing.|`|o1rzGR8kaa	C I C will keep you to busy to get bored, your watch will be in C I C, <br>  be proud only the smartest, get your rating, thanks for serving|`|y5Ul3jQIaa	try playing Solitaire.|`|rGWiOVDIaa	No matter what career you pick you will be bored at some point. After awhile you will learn what to do when there is low points. Like at my job we are suppose to do marketing/filing/cleaning/training while we are in a low point... or play on yahoo! answers :)|`|GSJ9gqVWaa	I'm sure you will be bored sometimes.  But there are lots of systems that need checking and rechecking etc.  The worst case scenario is that you are bored in the most heavily protected part of the ship.  Even with the entire ship serving as your bulletproof jacket, you will wish you were bored if you ever had to do the job you train for.<br>  <br>  Watch standing is basically being on duty in the CIC or bridge.  It also applies to some other duties.  The term comes from standing watch on ships, usually navigating and directing the crew.  The term predates the USN.  When it was first used there was no radar, no GPS, no sonar, no engines.  So your watch was usualy literally stood on deck, not sitting in front of a computer in the warm CIC.  If you set one foot outside the CIC during a 4 hour watch you will probably be court marshalled.  The commanders of USN vessels do not like it when they issue orders and there is no one to follow them.  And if the enemy or terrorists chose when you were out of the CIC to attack, it could cost the lives of your shipmates.<br>  <br>  When you get in the navy, everyone will make what you call insulting comments about your speciality.  Every one does about every speciality, except corpman.  A few people have a go at coprmen, but usually someone who has been in combet sets them straight pretty quick.  Just dont tell the marines they are wrong.  They believe that they can run faster, further and shoot straighter when they get there than any one else, as well as several things that I can't post on a family site.  I don't how how many of these things are true, but they have been fighting bar brawls since before the USN and US Army existed, and they are very good at it.  I wouldn't question them.|`|LcYeN6m5aa	It depends on what you consider boring.<br>  <br>  There's another saying in the navy: "Choose your rate, pick your fate."  <br>  <br>  There's a LOT of things navy does in its down time, (On submarines we'd have races down the passageways on towells on the floor during up or down angles - in the military police - we used to make our own "COPS" videos for training at 2-3 am and then watch them, on carriers, during safety stand downs, we can fill up kiddie pools on the flight deck and lounge in some sun and take in a scenic pacific ocean for a day).  <br>  <br>  The question is - DO YOU WANT TO BE AN OS? <br>  <br>  You'll actually get to push the button at some point to launch a missile, you'll be more indoors than the boatswains mates or the quartermasters / signalmen and you won't have much of a job in port guaranteeing more free time - OS's don't have much to do if you're not underway - which means free time to go see the world.<br>  <br>  I was a Nuke - top of the line and exciting stuff - but it turned out I hated nuclear engineering - and engineering period - I eventually got a different job but only after going through hell to change jobs - I had a blast in my new job!  <br>  <br>  Pick carefully, see how it transfers to the civilian world.<br>  <br>  If you're REALLY serious about it?   I'd see about ROTC and go be an officer - it's totally worth the wait - totally (unless obama eliminates our military in which case we won't need officers or anything else for that matter) <br>  <br>  Look down the road a bit more.  I enjoyed being enlisted, now I'm commissioning out as a Medical Officer which is more my forte - but in the end - enlisted life just wasn't for me - I had fun, was good at it (I was even junior sailor of the quarter etc.) - but I'd rather be in charge and calling shots rather than listening to people who are dumber than me simply because they put in their time in their college education.<br>  <br>  BUT - if you want to go to sea to play xbox 360......suit yourself. <br>  <br>  My reccomended fields for the Navy that ARENT boring:<br>  Special forces<br>  Law enforcement <br>  Aviation<br>  Divers<br>  Submarines<br>  Fleet Marine Forces<br>  <br>  Those will take you out, challenge you, push you, let you have some fun, and wil get you "out of" the navy - you'll be on your own world where you're not just a number - you have a specialty and aren't just there to clean up someone elses' mess.

ylj2PTFFaa	NOT AT ALL!!!!      to much money.  If it was a GOOD felony warrant then they might. Alabama wont spend that much money to transport a misdemeanor criminal.  You will just be released.|`|AA11494150	Wisconsin will only extradite a felony. I work on the border of Wisconsin and Michigan, and they will not even extradite from there.     What will happen is you will default on the plea bargain, so they will put you on 13 months probation. If you fail to report, they will issue a warrant for pickup in Wisconsin only. The 13 months will not start until you are picked up. At that point, they can revoke your probation and send you to jail for 13 months.|`|AA11124254	Probably not, but why take a chance.  Having a warrant out for your arrest could hinder any job prospects that you have.  Take the class and move on.|`|5f5749d37610dbd9abaec08095263c26aa	Yes, they could.  Now would they pay to extradite you that distance?  Very highly unlikely!  The cost of your travel would be too extreme for a minor offense.    If you ever got in trouble with the law closer to Wisconsin ... the warrant would still be good and they could extradite you.  If you are a member of the armed forces they could have you prosecuted under UCMJ.      Other than a possible bench warrant that might come into play at some point in the future, there is really not much that will happen to you.  I would get the counseling ASAP and notify the prosecutor of that move ... it might lead to having the warrant dropped.|`|vuzi75iiaa	no they will not extradite you. costs them too much and they are probally glad you moved out of their county. they only extradite serious felons.
HdSaN24caa	you sound like a little girl that has no knowledge of the world, and has swallowed your teachers ramblings on socialism.  and when you finally do wake up, the change you wanted won't be what you expected. read your history books.|`|AA11598520	No nasty comments?! Yet, you don't have a problem with making one of your own in the question, do you? (If John McCain won we would of [should be "have," dear, had the war for for an extra 5 yrs and amercan said hell no!!) Not ALL Americans have so little knowledge about the war or how things work, so not ALL Americans voted against him. In fact, I voted more against Obama then for McCain.     Further, it was President Bush who signed the agreement to remove the troops from Iraq in 16 months, NOT Obama. It was already a done deal when Obama won the election, but he doesn't have a problem taking credit for it and his followers don't have a problem giving him the credit he doesn't deserve.     Additionally, though the troops may be pulled out of Iraq, the war in Afghanistan will continue and Obama has already said that he will send troops from Iraq to Afghanistan. So the war isn't over by a long shot.     Moreover, Obama hasn't changed anything yet. In fact his new spending bill, that he calls a stimulus package, spends more money that we don't have than any other President in history! Both Obama and his followers complained almost constantly about Bush's overspending, yet once he's in power, he does exactly the same thing but more. In addition to a lot of nonsense, there's $21 for sod for the National Mall. Sod costs, about $.34 a square foot. There are 200,000 square feet in the National Mall. To re-sod the entire mall at once would cost only $64,000. $21 MILLION for sod.

We have elected the Electoral Collages choice not the American vote. We are already in trouble. With this so called recovery program, your grandchildrens grandchildren will be paying this off.I read the "recovery program" and we are squandering the money. Some will go to the proper things but not enough. Wait and see. In the package there is a surplus left from Bushes term (I don't mean a true surplus) of 350 billion to add to the 820 billion that Obama has asked for and then they went on to say that they will need another 350 billion just to balance. I read where all the funds were to be paid and I am sick with the knowledge that I carry a load that is beyond what I can afford.    EDIT: If this was a true recovery program they would divide up the money and give it to Americans to improve our lives. We would all be wealthy and we would buy things and the economy would come back with all the spending.|`|bXR0qdLSaa	I think Obama is a good choice for President and seems like he will do a good job  we have a lot of expectations from him|`|IDVFsy5waa	I do not like him and he is not going to  bring change  he's only gonna be stealing change out of everyones  pocket and that is for sure.|`|saQHPbBHaa	He's gonna be pissing off conservatives for another 8 yrs.|`|QT0qTFyAaa	He can't possibly be any worse than Bush.|`|R3DxlK0xaa	I think we need to start either praying for him or coming up with better ideas and quit spitting out hate which is all America seems to do anymore....Smart people come up with solutions instead of puking out hate.|`|4Vmlf902aa	Obama is mixed btw. I think if John won we'd be in better shape than with Bush. Our dependence on foreign oil would still probably be here. But NASA and the military could benefit from him increasing their budgets.

48acf9585e24591f1ae712f47be9e050aa	The statewide schedule calls for a fine of $321 for going 16-25 over the limit.  Your fine will be within a few dollars of that.  Traffic school will cost a bit more, but keep it off your record.

You might get away with it, but what is your integrity worth?|`|xxDjV6Axaa	I don't know exactly but it will be between $75 - 100 most likely.  Didn't it say on the ticket?  If not, you can call and ask.|`|1NPVVxW0aa	Seems an extremely lenient fine up to $100.    In the other countries this dangerous amount of speeding would mean a 12 month driving ban, or at least heavy points on your licence and a higher fine.|`|vk9bwD5jaa	In CA state, around $220 - $250.  Besides, I was able to beat seven (7) California tickets in the past 2 years. All by the method of Trial By Written Declaration (TBWD). You just need to call the court, and ask to contest your ticket by TBWD. You will need to download a form TR-205 and mail out the bail (ticket payment), and explain your reason in TR-205. With TBWD, you don't have to show up at the courthouse. Make sure you mail TR-205 about 2 weeks before your ticket due date.  If you were found guilty, you still have one more chance to appeal which is called Trial de Novo (TDN).  At TDN, you have to show up in court , and if the Officer did not show up, you win. If he show up, do this:  1) Ask the Judge for his TBWD since he is to turn in his TBWD within one month.  2) Use your reasonings from TBWD, and attack/corss examine the Officer.

When I think of a 7 year old child who can't focus in school or sleep well at night because their parent went to Iraq & never came back there is nothing good I can say for them. They did this for money. They lied & lied. I remember when Hillary would not go ahead to say OK to the war & I wished she would give in cause they were supposed to come right back. That was a lie that was never brought up again. Bush made a threat that made us look like we would have been liars if we didn't go through with it.

I saw a news article on FARMERS in India building solar panels for their electricity.  India is the 4th strongest in the world, with large cities and a strong military.  To become a superpower you need military strength, a strong economy, a good location in the world, and reliable and clean energy use.  Sure some of the superpowers don't have that, but it depends what kind of "superpower" you are talking about.  A military superpower like the USA?  An emerging trading superpower like China?  India has most of the things it needs to be a superpower.  You did say "Next superpower".  I do not think Germany or France will become the next superpower.
pzLDXL6gaa	I think he needs legal advice. If she and the child live in Gibraltar then it would be the laws there which she'd be following right? In most places, child support and visitation are completely different issues but I don't know the law in Gibraltar. Also what he's paying sounds rather high. Honestly, he really needs a lawyer to determine adequately his rights and responsibilities. If he had no income he shouldn't have had to pay her, and it's wrong if she's the one making the rules about payment in return for a visit.

(that's important too!) What kinds of skills do you have or do you want to gain?  Like computers? Go IT.  Like to take things apart and put them back together again?  Go mechanical.  Office job? Clerical or Admin.  Medical stuff?  Go medical.  <br>  Talk to anyone who enjoys their job.... they'll tell you it's the best job going!<br>  <br>  Ok, just saw your edit..... go clerical/admin.  Those are the folks that work M-F, days only.  Maintainers.... if it's broke, they have to fix it, regardless of time or day of week.

LWzrCu5caa	In general,  when a crime is being committed,  the criminals are responsible for any bad outcome.  In this case the issue of the kid getting his hands on a gun is not considered the fault of the parents but the fault of the criminals.   The criminals become the controlling force and if the kid can get to a gun,  technically it is their fault.   And if one of them gets killed,  that is also their fault.    However,  if the kid has access to the gun and anyone gets hurt for any reason due to that access, the parents are responsible and can be charged for it.   For example,  the kid shows the gun to a friend and someone gets shot.   The parents are really trusting their kid and they may regret it.  It would be best if the gun was secured in such a way that the kid can not get to it...  Judgment call on the part of the parents to say the least.        As far as the car,   I think you need to check Texas law.   You may be able to carry it loaded as long as it is concealed in the vehicle,  as long as you are traveling.   (Traveling has yet to be defined.)      See the reference below.|`|nfXbqCgZaa	Possession of a firearm by a minor is not illegal in Texas.  It is just illegal for a minor to purchase a firearm.  Your parents can easily purchase one for you, and it is perfectly legal.    Using a gun to protect your family is perfectly legal, provided you are afraid for your life.      I'm not sure about the laws in Texas, but if it was in a tool box, it could be considered concealed.  I think, as long as you have the weapon on the seat, unloaded ... in plain view it is okay.  But I could and probably am wrong on that one, so if there are any Texas cops out there ... maybe they will correct me on this one.|`|C4WlEbIOaa	Because it is self-defense it is alright.

If you fail to do either he will start a legal action through the courts to evict you from them.

People need to look at actions and not what people call themselves. The governments of Russia and China could be referred to state socialism/authoratarian capitalism. Listen to the facts shared to us with comrades that have taken the time to write out the work.              one thing Marx said that pretty much everyone ignores is that you have to go through the full cycle of capitalism and industrialisation in order to get a society capable of socialism or communism. democratic socialism works just fine in countries like Norway or Sweden. countries like Cuba might work out if they weren't being economically blockaded by the richest countries in the world. and the Soviet Union and its satellites attempted to go straight from a feudal/agrarian system to communism. it was forcing the cycle forward without going through an industrial age, and of course did not work.|`|B79lX9Inaa	Are you trying to insinuate something?

Those that are the masses then they throw up let them take care of themselves we can't spend any money "THAT'S SOCIALISM, COMMUNISM".  They are lazy they can't have my money.    Well what happened to their theory that in a free market if the business fails that is just the economy correcting itself?    What happened to the trickle down theory.  Oh, better yet voo doo economics.  Each time ppl fall for this when our country is doing great.  You don't want to pay for anything, greed takes over and you want that 3% difference.

What they don't tell you is that they are going to borrow from other countries that we will be indebted to, That's right and then we still have to pay them back.

Another thing is that in order to have a complete communistic system the government must have complete control over the economy, country and minds of the people. Do not get absorbed into the lie of equality communism promises, but instead we must do whatever we can to abolish it wherever it springs up; we can not give it a foothold in the world (that's lookin' at you china).|`|58607c6ba5c8f548e69203c94d723527aa	Because it doesnt work.

g3AM6QSVaa	Yes, there are a few different avenues. If the vehicle is truly her only asset (because everything else is already held in trusts, joint tenancy, etc.), then it's pretty easy. Under Florida Statute 735.301, you would qualify for disposing (transferring the property) of the personal property without the need for estate administration or formal proceedings. Your mom's car is considered exempt property. All you would need to do is go down to the court Clerk's office (with death certificate) & they will give you a form to fill out & sign. The court will then transfer ownership. You take this piece of paper to the Florida DMV and the ownership of the vehicle will be transferred. Very easy process & the court will help you fill out the form. No attorney needed.<br>  Another option would be for your mom to put the car in a trust with her as the trustee. Then, upon death, her successor trustee would take over. Viable option but requires attorney to draw up paperwork & may not be worth the expense just for a car.<br>  Also, if your mom's only asset is the car, then you could request a Summary Administration from the probate judge. This is more or less the same as the 1st option I listed. The Judge will determine that the estate qualifies as a "very small estate" and will disburse the assets without formal probate. This takes about 1-2 weeks and all the heirs MUST agree. The death certificate must be filed and proof of the paid funeral bill may be required.<br>  There's also joint tenancy with right of survivorship; which would mean that all parties involved owned the car in equal shares. Once mom passed away her share in the car would be equally divided among the other surviving owners without any court proceedings. The problem with this is that you all could be held legally liable for damages if she were to get into a car accident & injure someone. Cons = Would require a lawyer to draft document for joint tenancy. May have issue changing to joint tenancy due to the unity of time clause.<br>  <br>  I know it all seems pretty confusing but really it's fairly straightforward. <br>  Best of luck!|`|AA11206283	Sell it to a child for $1.00 Agreement that vehicle to be resold and assets to be divided as per her request.
SOOu6fJeaa	Thomas Jefferson warned against private bankers being allowed to take control of our monetary system. Andrew Jackson through them out in his day and called them vipers. Check out the quotes below of Senators, Presidents, Supreme court Justices. Now were all of these men just paranoid? It's not paranoia if it's true brother.    "I GAVE IT AS MY OPINION...THAT IF THESE (SECRET) SOCIETIES WERE NOT COUNTERACTED...THEY WOULD SHAKE THE GOVERNMENT TO ITS FOUNDATIONS."  --- President George Washington    "THE REAL TRUTH OF THE MATTER IS, AS YOU AND I KNOW, THAT A FINANCIAL ELEMENT IN THE LARGE CENTERS HAS OWNED THE GOVERNMENT EVER SINCE THE DAYS OF ANDREW JACKSON."  --- President Franklin Roosevelt from a November 23, 1933 letter to Edward Mandell House.    "DOES IT NOT SEEM STRANGE TO YOU THAT THESE MEN JUST HAPPENED TO BE C.F.R. AND JUST HAPPENED TO BE ON THE BOARD OF GOVERNORS OF THE 'FEDERAL RESERVE', THAT ABSOLUTELY CONTROLS THE MONEY AND INTEREST RATES OF THIS GREAT COUNTRY WITHOUT THE BENEFIT OF CONGRESS? A PRIVATELY OWNED ORGANIZATION, THE FEDERAL RESERVE WHICH HAS ABSOLUTELY NOTHING TO DO WITH THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA!"  --- Senator Barry Goldwater from his book, 'With no apologies: The personal and political memoirs of United States Senator Barry M. Goldwater'    "THE REAL MENACE OF OUR REPUBLIC IS THIS INVISIBLE GOVERNMENT WHICH LIKE A GIANT OCTOPUS, SPRAWLS ITS SLIMY LENGTH OVER CITY, STATE AND NATION....AT THE HEAD OF THIS OCTOPUS ARE THE ROCKEFELLER-STANDARD OIL INTERESTS AND A SMALL GROUP OF POWERFUL BANKING HOUSES GENERALLY REFERRED TO AS THE INTERNATIONAL BANKERS (WHO) VIRTUALLY RUN THE U.S. GOVERNMENT FOR THEIR OWN SELFISH PURPOSES."  --- New York City Mayor, John Hylan; March 26, 1922    "OUTWARDLY WE HAVE A CONSTITUTIONAL GOVERNMENT. WE HAVE OPERATING WITHIN OUR GOVERNMENT AND POLITICAL SYSTEM, ANOTHER BODY REPRESENTING ANOTHER FORM OF GOVERNMENT, A BUREAUCRATIC ELITE WHICH BELIEVES OUR CONSTITUTION IS OUTMODED."  --- Senator William Jenner; Feb. 23, 1954.    "IT (THE DEPRESSION) WAS NOT ACCIDENTAL. IT WAS A CAREFULLY CONTRIVED OCCURRENCE...THE INTERNATIONAL BANKERS SOUGHT TO BRING ABOUT A CONDITION OF DESPAIR HERE SO THAT THEY MIGHT EMERGE AS THE RULERS OF US ALL."  --- Congressman Louis McFadden (Chairman of the House Banking And Currency Committee)    "IN THE UNITED STATES TODAY WE HAVE IN EFFECT TWO GOVERNMENTS...WE HAVE THE DULY CONSTITUTED GOVERNMENT...THEN WE HAVE AN INDEPENDENT, UNCONTROLLED AND UNCOORDINATED GOVERNMENT IN THE FEDERAL RESERVE SYSTEM, OPERATING THE MONEY POWERS WHICH ARE RESERVED TO CONGRESS BY THE CONSTITUTION."  --- Congressman Wright Patman (Chairman of the House Banking Committee.)

They have created a State within a State, and when they are opposed, they attempted to strangle the nation financially as in the case of Portugal and Spain."        "If they are not excluded from the United States by the Constitution, within less than a hundred years they will stream into our country in such numbers that they will rule and destroy us, and change our form of government for which Americans have shed their blood and sacrificed life, property and personal freedom. If the Jews are not excluded, within 200 years our children will be working in the fields to feed the Jews, while they remain in the Counting House gleefully rubbing their hands."         "I warn you, gentlemen, if you do not exclude the Jew forever, your children`s children will curse you in your grave."      "Their ideas are not those of Americans. The leopard cannot change his spots. The Jews are a danger to this land, and if they are allowed to enter, they will imperil its institutions."

Our policy today is that we would not use them except in response to a WMD attack. The very fact that we would use them only to retaliate in kind would be justified in my mind.     Weapons may not be ethical. Nor may they be unethical. They are inanimate objects incapable of doing anything beyond what they are designed to do and that only at the hands of people who may be ethical or unethical.

We are talking about one of the oldest special forces groups in the world.  The US Marines, have been on every major battle field since the revolutionary war.  It may sound barbaric, childish and silly, but hazing actually makes them closer.  They share a common bond, a common story to tell.  The US Marines are a fighting force, they are not a social club, they are an expedetionary force called upon by congress to carry out specific duties.  We Marines are called upon to Fight, to Kill and to Die if that is what the mission brings.  Obviously no one wants to die, but it is a very distinct possibility, it goes through your head constantly, like a bad song that you heard, to take your mind off of it you may find yourself hazing the new guy or girl.  It toughens you up, if one cannot handle hazing them maybe they do not have what it takes to be a Marine.  We are trained killers.  I do not want to church it up any way, I don't want to sit here and type to you that "hey we look good in our Dress Blues and we cut our hair short to look good"  It is as simple as if I am asked to take a fire team 5 miles into hostile territory and kill as many of the enemy as I can and bring my Marines home alive, then I have three things on my mind.  1. Mission Accomplishment, first and foremost, 2, Troop Welfare, make sure that they come before me, that is why I am a leader, 3. Get my butt home alive.  <br>  Hazing is not a bad thing, it is training, it prepares you for the harshness of reality, Life is tough and life for a Marine can be tougher.
VfowGdWLaa	Obviously the sooner all the troops come home the better. But the war can not stop just like that many things need to be considered before we withdraw. On the other hand I think the troops should come back today. Why? Because some people in the middle east do not appreciate what our troops and our allies have done for them. Was the war pointless?

And America didn't even know about the Jews until AFTER WWII. We joined the war because the Japanese bombed Pearl Harbor...not until we had a direct threat on our country did we join the war.|`|13920962b7119a1b4d44ad9700a88994aa	We are not at war with Iraq!  The intentions was to weed the terriorists out of Iraq and they are doing that themselves along with us.|`|gfB5VNXTaa	I think that war is terrible, but sometimes necessary such as the World Wars.  The war currently being fought is to help revive a nation from a dictatorship that lasted for over 20 years and to wipe out as many terrorists and al-Qaeda members as possible so I view it as a necessary war.|`|G11cR4xhaa	Lets ask the people that were fed into a wood chipper feet first.How bout the people that had their heads cut off with a rusty knife.Will you bow a knee to Allah?'

War is going to happen whether you like it or not, best be prepared for it and understand how the outcome will effect you. Peace, love and happiness is a great pipe dream but, until the world stops looking at other people as second class citizens, infidels, etc. we will be faced with the threat of war and, if we are strategic and implement our beliefs of a more free and equal ideology, we will come closer to this dream. We let Germany sit and toil for 16 years after world war one, it almost cost us the world. We have left Russia and Iran in isolation for far too long ( they are not willing to bend on their extreme ideologies) and soon we will be faced with the greatest of confrontations. Be ready to choose a side and to stand and fight for what you believe or just conform. I, for one, believe my rights were endowed by God and I will fight to protect them.|`|bgtNYOp5aa	I think there is War that is Necessary, but this War is not. This Iraq War is illegal, there are many more horrid leaders that are worse than Saddam. The Bush administration destroyed this economy, and War takes a heavy toll on wasted spending.     Billions of dollars, 5,000 American troops, and 600,000 Iraqi People killed for what? A lie told by the Bush Administration that there are no WMD's?    If we didn't join WW2 than Hitler would have terminated the Jews, every disabled, and gay person. He would be a living God. The Japanese would have never surrendered. Some war is necessary.|`|M8504cJPaa	I don't like the war but I don't hate the war.

Had Bill Clinton the wisdom and courage to destroy bin Laden when we had the chance, this crap would all be over.  This is the problem with electing spineless cowards to fulfill our mission.

They have to tell you you.   You should have been in court.  Tell us all.    I agree---go to Legal Aid and tell your story.  They will listen to you. I don't know whether they will agree with you.

Murder isn't always just a cut and clear as most people think.  For example, if someone were to enter your home, rape your children then got away and you hunt them down and kill them you would be convicted of murder in most cases. Would I feel sympathetic to you if you got killed? Sure I would as would most people.  Murder isn't always just cold blooded death lust as TV often portrays it. Think this one over a bit more and think of a few extenuating circumstances.

8MUj24s6aa	This is what the Second Amendment is all about. I got this from a fellow Answerer and think he explained it rather well.     Second Amendment of the United States Constitution    A well regulated militia, being necessary to the security of a free state, the right of the people to keep and bear arms, shall not be infringed.  ? The Amendment is worded and punctuated perfectly.    A well regulated Militia, being necessary to the security of a free State, the right of the people to keep and bear Arms, shall not be infringed.    (well regulated) allowed to function exactly as intended    (militia) a body of citizen soldiers as distinguished from professional soldiers; all able-bodied citizens considered by law eligible for military service; a body of citizens organized in a paramilitary group and typically regarding themselves as defenders of individual rights against the presumed interference of the federal government.    (necessary) being essential, indispensable    (free) enjoying personal rights or liberty; enjoying political autonomy, as a people or country not under foreign rule; independent; exempt from external authority, interference, restriction, etc.; existing under, characterized by, or possessing civil and political liberties that are, as a rule, constitutionally guaranteed by representative government    (right) something that is due to a person by law, tradition, or nature.     (infringe) to commit a breach or infraction of; violate or transgress    My reading of the Amendment:    A well armed citizen, being necessary to secure individual liberty, the ability of the citizen to defend their life and liberty shall not be reduced by the decree of any majority at any time.      Technically speaking based on what the 2nd Amendment states, the 2nd should be the only form of permit needed to lawfully buy, use, sell, transfer, carry (anywhere) a firearm for LEGAL purposes.    But because of our Government we are required to gain carry permits in order to carry a handgun concealed in public. Some states do have an open carry law that allows legal gun owners to carry openly.    http://www.youtube.com/user/DOUGandFRIEN...  http://www.nraila.org/GunLaws/ ?st=LA|`|pnpkJKvpaa	They're not part of a militia, so NO.|`|1u9dF06uaa	Yes, it is our RIGHT. you're right, most normal people won't need to shoot someone regularly. but we have the right to bear a firearm for our own protection.|`|g7fPDmmxaa	"A well regulated militia, being necessary to the security of a free state, the right of the people to keep and bear arms, shall not be infringed." The key word there is 'people'. It is our right as american citizens to "keep and bear arms." We can own guns, and we can carry them. There are age requirements set forth by law makers, 18 to own a rifle, and 21 to own a handgun. If you want to carry a concealed weapon, you must have a permit to do so. As long as you're 21, if you're gun is not concealed, the government cannot stop you from carrying a handgun. Businesses can restrict guns on their premises legally. Just keep these things in mind, and you should be fine. Don't listen to those idiots, and cowards who say that the second amendment only applies to the military, or police. Either they don't know what they're talking about, or they're cowards, or both.    God Bless America!|`|dSpLfZFnaa	The second amendment gives power to a well regulated militia to secure a free State which would require the people be able to keep and bear Arms not just guns.|`|EOhDZQDHaa	I live in real America were we have always packed at will why cant people pack?|`|rjWmooaXaa	You don't have to wear long-sleeved shirts due to the right to bare arms. =)|`|tn2ur8vOaa	unlike many perceived rights the Second Amendment is real. There are plenty of states that allow the carrying of arms in public (concealed and carry permits) but unfortunately libs are trying to take this right away from normal Americans.|`|8cd4e5f44ddf57a92d759bab9b6186d1aa	You can not form a militia of private citizens if those private citizens have no guns.    Yes the 2nd amendment refers to individuals. That's why it says the right of the People    some relevent qoutes from the time help clear the matter up:    No freeman shall ever be debarred the use of arms.            ---Thomas Jefferson: Draft Virginia Constitution, 1776.   To model our political system upon speculations of lasting tranquility, is to calculate on the weaker springs of the human character.           ---Alexander Hamilton   [The Constitution preserves] the advantage of being armed which Americans possess over the people of almost every other nation...(where) the governments are afraid to trust the people with arms.           ---James Madison,The Federalist Papers, No. 46.   "[I]f circumstances should at any time oblige the government to form an army of any magnitude, that army can never be formidable to the liberties of the people while there is a large body of citizens, little if at all inferior to them in discipline and the use of arms, who stand ready to defend their rights and those of their fellow citizens." -- The Federalist, No. 29   "I ask, sir, what is the militia? It is the whole people, except for a few public officials."   George Mason, in Debates in Virginia Convention on Ratification of the Constitution, Elliot, Vol. 3, June 16, 1788           Is that enough or should I continue?|`|twPZBsH2aa	The right to bear arms, and the right to form a militia are two separate parts of the 2nd amendment, and the source of many debates since it was not written clearly. There is some ambiguity about the exact intention of the 2nd amendment, but as FBI statistics bear out, those states with concealed weapons permits have less violent crime, and in no case has someone with a concealed weapons permit committed a  crime with that firearm.  Hard to believe, but true.    The FBI knows the facts, personal security is not assured by police, it is assured by those who can defend themselves, and this means a gun in the home so that home invaders think twice about breaking into a house where weapons might be in the hands of the owner.|`|4fda62554c07de687e2ca85293849ac6aa	What its really about is who owns you.  If you own yourself then you have a right to defend yourself.  If the government owns you then you don't.  Its up to the government to defend you, or not.    It doesn't have anything to do with militia's, which at the time were run by the states not the feds.
0f6a1cdae0a3ce3617b1109a091741bdaa	The only problem I have with technology is that a lot of people have become so reliant on it that they can't function without it. I don't know how many young people (supposedly high school grads) that can't even make proper change from a cash register. I have seen others that are so reliant on calculators that they can't add or subtract well enough to be able to balance their checkbooks....and God forbid that anyone would bother to walk a few blocks to a friends house to talk to them rather than to pick up the cell and start texting. Technology is not bad. I enjoy it too, but being from the old school, I also know what to do if I don't have those tech things to count on. If necessary, I can grow and preserve my own food, sew my own clothes and heat my house with wood that I chopped myself. Not that I do all those things, but most of the younger people today don't even know how.

xxDjV6Axaa	I'm not sure they would allow this second discharge.  You could go to a credit counseling org and see if they can reduce the debt and the payments.  At least stop the interest from building up even higher.  Did you get your disability approved?  If so, you might be able to plead the hardship case.  If not, chances are they won't agree.  So try to make at least some payment every month to the debt.  Be careful of those who ask for money.  And only pay your creditor.

ucraoWTKaa	if it got delayed till the 24th that means they want to look at your return more closely (a nice way of saying you are getting audited).  Last year when we claimed our child for the first time they told us there where "processing delays" then we had to send in more info from her employer and we didn't get our money till late march when it was all said and done.  I pray this is not what you will have to go through but this was exactly what happened to us last year.|`|Y4GAddyaaa	I don't know what you mean when you said that you received a delay date.    There is a PDF file you can download regarding when you should receive your refund.  Please note that there is a before 11:00am cutoff time regarding when the IRS receives your paperwork.

No mistakes, just unless the irs finds errors, I should receive them on the 10th. So I guess I am not the only one.|`|vHlEv8p8aa	I filed on Jan 16th with H&R Taxcut program - got and accepted confirmation than a proposed date of Feb 3 for refund to be sent to my account.

I filed taxes for my daughter, sister, at the same time and they received their funds on Jan 28! I sure hope that my return has not been delayed any more.
3BhXf5MYaa	Agree with Yak Rider.    The LPR card is a 2 year conditional status, to prove that the marriage is legitimate.

It doesn't matter if he knows where she's at or not, he can still divorce her without her being there.  After the divorce he should submit the divorce decree to USCIS along with a letter explaining that she abandoned him after she got the card.    In two years her card will expire and she'll be out of status and deportable at that time.    He should avoid all contact with her.  Her ONLY chance of staying is to file abuse charges against him and get a restraining order.  If that happens she might be able to stay by claiming abused spouse status while self-petitioning.|`|Cwuti01Zaa	Whatever it is, I hope she gets caught and deported.|`|tn2ur8vOaa	The first green card is only valid for 2 year.

IW3jmnKbaa	Especially when "democracy" is so much worse, Russia might have 10% in jail but we have 2.3 million in jail,"land of the free my *ss. And with all that we pay in tax's, for the crappy government we get, all they do is take away freedom. With the "patriot act", and "asset forfeiture" laws, we have no "freedom". When a person that's just sitting in his house can be raided, arrested, have his house, car, bank accounts, all his assets seized, be held without charges, or legal representation, indefinitely, to me, that's either Nazism, or something worse than communism, if that's what we call "democracy", keep it.  The government has no regard for the Bill of Rights, or the Constitution, and the supreme court has nullified just about every thing in those two documents, which were designed to prevent just that. The government powers that the constitution limits have gotten so strong, that they now outpower their own restrictions, we all know what that means, right?  Thomas Jefferson said, "when government is no longer accountable to the people, the people can no longer protect themselves from the government".   |`|dSpLfZFnaa	Maybe you should research the subject a lot.

In a perfect world, sure, everyone pitches in as hard as they can, and we all prosper. But that's not going to happen. Capitalism takes advantage of that drive to improve one's standing.     A bit of a safety net is certainly necessary so that those who can't help themselves don't suffer. The question, of course, is -- how big should the safety net be?

Here is where I think it failed:    1. Communism is egalitarian (all people are equal). People are not equal, some are stronger, smarter, and faster than others, even though we all have equal dignity.    2. Communisim tries to take away the right to private property. This eliminates homelessness in theory, but it creates a lot of power in government.    3. Communism cannot exists if people have arms (that is weapons). Because people would rise up against each other and form tribes, or crime organizations. This also makes a people vulnerable to foreign attack. The ideal communist state would not need a military power, but rather a police, that would eventually  be unecessary with improved technology... (I know it sounds kinda silly, but think about it).    *** I think I've gone on long enough.|`|jH8hIB0kaa	Under Communism everyone strives for mediocrity because individual are not rewarded for their works.

Is this bad?  It depends on your opinion of how a country should work.  Should a country take guns away so people can't go against the government and make the country fall?  Or should we have guns, and live with the risk that we have a bigger chance of getting shot?  There are countries all over the world.  Just like every other country, we can be controlled by good, or bad people.  Bad people can use communism.  Good people can use communism.  Some people thought that freedom was a crazy idea and would never work.  That is the same idea with communism.  I do not approve of countries like North Korea.

Communism as such is not dictatorship even if soviet Union was dictatorship and china is.   The fact remains that communists have never come to power by overthrowing democracy.  The Russian communists overthrew Czar . The Chinese communists also replaced a dictatorship..  Also the communists claim they are democratic. China is a 'peoples republic'. East Germany was GDR (German Democratic Republic) and so on.  In three Indian states, the Communists have come to power through constitutional electoral system. They have inner party democracy and are more people oriented and honest than the family leadership based congress, communal fascist BJP and other personality and family based regional outfits.  All non communist countries are not democratic. Many of them are religious fundamentalists and there is nothing democratic about them.  We have seen only soviet Model and the Chinese commune model. It is possible some other models may emerge that may be more democratic. The history of communist parties begins with 1917  In human history, it is not very long time. We should give Marxism a room for further refinement.|`|AA11702773	Because it intrudes government into personal choices, viewpoints and lives in ways we find unacceptable.|`|4fda62554c07de687e2ca85293849ac6aa	Because it is evil.

They either won't work or won't give up what they have unless they are forced into it.  Its only products are misery, starvation, and death.    100 million killed by their own communist governments during the last century.

If you think communism is a great idea, then let me plan your life for you.  I am as qualified as almost anyone in government.      You will work in a hot, smoky, dangerous forge from now on making tank parts. For that, you will be be able to feed your family some of the time.  What?  You dont like it and you wont work hard at your job because you cannot advance?  You capitalist pig.      Forget medical care; you cant really get good medical care outside of the free US.  You will be required to praise me.  You will consume what goods I decide you may consume, because I decide who produces them.  You will not have toilet paper.  Whoops, I forgot to put that into my production budget.  Maybe next year I will remember.      Are you hungry?  Too bad. This year I estimated that our new fertilizers would increase food production, but it rained a lot.  Maybe if the farmers had a profit motive they would have made more food.  Maybe we can spare you a sack of hard winter wheat this month.
cEFiOrX5aa	http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Military_di...     There are some good examples on there. Basically dishonorable means you're worthless in the service and untrustworthy as a civilian.

Honorable is generally reserved for those who full fill their term of service or are offered early discharge/retirement.  A health reason would lead to a medical/general discharge.

However, if a soldier is caught in the "act" it could be downgraded to a general.|`|AA10932453	Health reasons are high on the list.  Any medical condition that will prevent a SM from completing his mission is grounds for tossing him out.    The most common is "completion of term of service" and honorable.    "Medical" is always honorable as long as it was line-of-duty=yes.  That is, as long as the SM did not wreck their body doing something they should not do, they are given an honorable discharge.  E.g. A drunk driver that loses a leg will find that the Army considers that a line-of-duty=no, and the discharge will reflect that.    There are also find plenty of "failure to adapt" and "misconduct" discharges.  These range from people that are just general ****-ups to people that just don't fit and cause problems.  The discharge can be "honorable" (just don't fit), or it can be "general under honorable conditions" (total **** up, but committed no serious crime), or it can be "general under other than honorable conditions" (total **** up, but committed a serious crime).    The really serious crimes -- the Silence-of-the-Lamb type crimes -- fall into "Bad Conduct" or "Dishonorable".  If you meet one of these, run screaming. With the warning that before the mid-1970s, some of these discharges were handed out randomly.  But because of some court cases in the 1970s, the characterization of discharges has been standardized somewhat.  It is impossible, in any practical sense, to receive either a Bad Conduct Discharge or an Dishonorable Discharge, without also receiving some years in prison for a federal felony conviction for a serious crime.
GmW5mUrpaa	I'm guessing that you are in school. I am also guessing that if your mother beats you, you must have marks? Therefor, you should show the school authorities the marks.

Every time you talk to someone write their name, date and time down each time. If you can make some notes about what you told them. When someone sees that you are keeping a log they will understand you can provide their name later on.  You can also make an excuse to see your family  doctor, they must also report abuse.

Bill Clinton was impeached, but obviously he wasn't removed from office.      Andrew Johnson was the only other President to face impeachment.  Nixon would have, but he chose to resign instead.  Nixon is the only President to resign from office.|`|sfC6L8ybaa	For Clinton, the Republican-led House of Repr. agreed that the impeachment charges should be tried by the Senate; but, the Senate acquitted him on both counts.  Andrew Johnson was impeached in 1868; but again, he was acquitted by the Senate.|`|ccBNNA5paa	no|`|KVBTtF9faa	No.|`|AA11895162	Bill Clinton, President of the United States was impeached by the House of Representatives on December 19, 1998, and acquitted by the Senate on February 12, 1999. The charges, perjury, obstruction of justice, and abuse of power arose from the Monica Lewinsky scandal and the Paula Jones law suit. The trial proceedings were largely party-line, with no Democratic Senators voting for conviction and only five Democratic Representatives voting to impeach. In all, 55 senators voted not guilty, and 45 voted guilty on the perjury charge. The Senate also acquitted on the charge of obstruction, with 50 votes cast as not guilty, and 50 votes as guilty.[1] It was only the second impeachment of a President in American history, following the impeachment of Andrew Johnson in 1868.|`|otLK5QFzaa	Bill cilnton wasn't impeached!!!!! BUt blagoavich was! ha ha ha|`|1du7Nbfbaa	Yes, impeachment means that charges are brought. He was charged and then acquitted. So he was not removed from office.|`|HXIIbVN8aa	Yes, Clinton was impeached but not convicted.|`|UiQ6V377aa	WOW...all these young kids answering questions and getting it wrong...    Bill Clinton was NOT impeached. Nixon was the only president impeached.    Clinton was tried in court and acquitted of charges...he's unfaithful,did that make him a bad president? NO! He did more for the education system than bush ever did! (No child left behind....oh yeah good one!)|`|AA11461754	lol... yes he was... Bill Clinton was impeached in 1998 by the House for perjury and obstruction of justice. However the Senate could not gather enough votes to convict him.    The 17th president Andrew Johnson.... some could argue that Nixon was impeached, but he "resigned" instead.|`|p6PZIQNXaa	No he was not|`|AA11558024	Bill Clinton was impeached but not removed from office.    Andrew Johnson was impeached but not removed from office.    No US President has ever been removed from office.    Richard Nixon resigned before he could be impeached.    Remember the House of Representatives votes for articles of impeachment (to bring charges) while the Senate votes to remove from office while the Chief Justice presides over this Senate trial (conviction).|`|jWO10NN5aa	An impeachment is a trial.  When a president is impeached, he is only brought to trial for certain allegations, and impeachments do not always result in conviction.    Andrew Johnson and Bill Clinton were both impeached, but neither was convicted or removed from office.|`|WL3KcegWaa	Yes, Bill Clinton was impeached.    Andrew Johnson was the only other US President to be impeached.    It is sad that people do not know either history or how the government works.|`|NrkWd4Aoaa	Bill Clinton was impeached by the House of Representatives, which means that a majority voted that there was enough evidence of the kind of criminal misconduct to ask the Senate to have a trial and vote whether to remove him from office.      The Senate failed to convict on any of the charges so, although Clinton WAS impeached, he was not removed from office.    Richard Nixon was not impeached.  He resigned from office before impeachment could occur.    Andrew Johnson is the only other president to be impeached.     No  president has ever been removed from office by the Senate.

But now, the lazy people who have been on welfare for generations (these people have black, white, and brown skin) expect the government to help them out for everything.

Some of it would have been discrimination and the other reason would be that ultra religious people don't get voted in as a rule.  The Republicans worried about Romney being a Mormon.  People worry they'll legislate their own morality.  I would find this especially scarey in the case of a devout Muslim as I don't want to cover my head.

They are only a small share of them. The major employers are the smaller companies with 50 to 300 employees. These companies will require more attention because there are so many of them that need help getting through this tough economy, but they are the ones that are many times, the ones left out of these tax breaks. This is when your local government should be telling the government stimulus people right now, because small to medium companies are the backbone of our national economy.|`|AA11100679	the wealthy are scared of what Obama is doing and who is telling Him how to do it. they are closing down, buying Gold and tax free state bonds,tighten the belt and waiting for after the crash.

lvBUl3Zdaa	You've got it backwards. The Republicans are trying to break unions and take away your health insurance. Why do you begrudge helping people who need help if you aren't getting paid off first? You sound like a classic neocon, like the investment banker CEO's who insisted they needed to get bailed out, then had no cash left for loans after paying themselves bonuses.     The last woman who told me she and her husband worked high tech jobs in the government with golden parachutes and $100K salaries turned out to be a trainer in a health club. )|`|q4EXFhV7aa	Well, lucky for you, you have yourself a wonderful, self-contained little family and life. Unfortunately, most people don't. Sometimes people lose their jobs; sometimes people are legitimately unable to work. Sounds like you have everything all figured out. I pray that you will never need assistance. Unfortunately, some people weren't as lucky as you. We aren't a third world country. We are/YOUR OWN PARTY used to believe that we were 'that shining beacon of hope,' the 'city on the hill". That beacon can't shine when we do nothing to care for those who cannot care for themselves. You're probably correct....Obama's goals and plans won't do much to help you personally. But they will help our Veterans, who give life and limb for YOU and your family. They will help seniors who did everything within their power to get you to where you are today. They will help children who, unlike your children, didn't have a choice of where they were born and to whom. Your children will live near these kids, go to school with them, be friends with them. 3 million children are in foster care. I know you couldn't care less about everyone else's problems, but if that were YOUR child.....if that were YOUR parent....YOUR outsourced job....YOUR closed job......YOUR son or daughter who was left permenantly disabled, you would absolutely understand why it is vitally important that we care for our fellow citizens who legitimately need help.|`|be5d02d1dc7db03c5839affa5d0d722faa	Sound just like me without the rants about him taking from you or me    Sounds like you need to just not come together then we care not    wait the 4-8 years then maybe you will have someone from your side in office    Your turn to complain for 8 years...I did it    or how about giving him the BENEFIT of the doubt like I gave Bush first 4 years    Majority rules man...........nothing can be done about that    I have survived the 8 years without worrying about what the government can and did not do for me looks like you can too    (;|`|AA11598520	Sorry, I think we're screwed.|`|Un986lZnaa	not a DAM thing|`|b0f0f231555e5da9d455a8890388f3cbaa	I think the proper phrasing of your question should be "How will Barack Obama benefit me as an American?"

I wonder the same thing every day...what benefit it will give me and my family. soo.    What Obama will do is very similiar to waht Jimmy Carter will do. I'm sure you are a very hardworking man, just like my father. Obama will take that money that you put your sweat and blood into and he will give it to people that havent worked a day in their life. Also, he'll give 5000 dollars to the women that most likely dont have a husband but are having babies out of the kazoo...all this will do is promote women "on the streets" or with little money and no husband to have more babies. and then guess what? even moree of our money will be taken for them!  all the companies in america won't have workers, because all the poor people will just be given handouts (coming from our wallets). so the hardworking wealthy people will not have much money. so it will all basically even out and become a socialist countryyy...  GREAT.  lets just hope that america re-learns it's lesson and votes for another reagan..  ah, yes. one more thing. the black people will have a fellow colored person as president. id like to know how this will help this country... and oh wait, gets even better. he's middle eastern too! and dont forget that he aided a terrorist. ooh yah, and he hates his own country. sounds like a great mix for a president to me.

Actually probably better than the splendid picture you present. However, I do have a few observations. First never believe you are immune to catastrophe. During my working career I have known many who seemed to have it all and suddenly it was gone. Think IBM and all of the downsizing they have done over the years. Think railroads, auto industry, communications, etc. Anyone and everyone can be affected. Having said that, I want to confess I am a conservative and did not vote for Obama. However, I clearly understand he IS our president, and we ( all of us) are going to sink or swim with him and the congress. If he is unsuccessful and our national ( local ) economies continue to decline, a union will not protect anyone from job lose. ( Just look at the auto workers and union). So the stimulus bill that is working its way through congress is going to effect everyone, maybe not in that many direct dollars, but the restoration of faith in our economy and people's ability to maintain something close to their current level of living. You and I did not live through the depression but if we get anywhere close to that predicament your safe job will be just a memory. Bottom line, we all have a great deal to lose if this president doesn't succeed.

It's called PREVENTATIVE health care.  Here's how it works:<br>  <br>  You pay only 25% of what your current insurance rates are now in exchange for regularly scheduled check ups throughout the year.  That way if you DO happen to develop a condition, it can be treated early on and at a fraction of the cost than if you waited until you were in the advanced stages of whatever is wrong with you.  Simple as that.   Call it a "good driver" discount if you will to all the families that have insurance, but who rarely need advanced medical care.|`|lyhnHhuWaa	Yes, because everyone knows that expanding an already proven failure of a program will make everything better and result in the excellent health care that current recipients are already getting.  It's not fair for some to have great expensive health care while others have none, so we all need to have really crappy expensive health care.  Yes it makes perfect sense.

If your maid of honor really has filed lawsuits in the past, you should be able to find them if you look on the court websites in the county or area where they were filed.

K1iUzewyaa	yep... oppose the stimulus plan.. either  that or join  a local "Tea Party"<br>  but the main stream media will not report this.. sissies...|`|280a2e214bf05397a5b94e4faa4b6d61aa	...and because the "stimulus" so appeals to this type of 6th grade mentality is among the many reasons why I oppose it...|`|1bd6f7dcd94b559f97fdb31387c7926faa	No.  Just e-mailed my Congressman thanking him for backing it.  My Mom remembers the Great Depression.|`|AA11765933	My governor is an actor  He is clueless.

I will let my governor know this, even though it will be ignored.|`|QvNBEDA2aa	Opposed. Oh, my Gov is Strickland. Don't think he'll send anything back. In fact, he's gonna build a railroad to nowhere! Wants to restore a choo choo train and rails that were shut down 40 years ago! Yet, he wants state workers (my husband) who are already underpaid and overworked (as they will not hire anyone for retired workers) to take unpaid holidays, take a cut in pay, healthcare, vacations etc. WOW! Yes, I have written him. Ha Ha, what a joke.|`|u6MJPdT9aa	Yup.<br>  <br>  Texas wont be playing

Enlisting in the USMC will ensure that you are extensively trained as a rifleman - Marines are riflemen first and always.  After that it is pretty specialized.<br>  <br>  If you want to serve for 4-8 years and then get out, the question becomes "Do you plan to go to college afterwards?".  If so, your future career will be set there instead of in the Corps - go for whatever MOS interests you (armor, infantry, whatever excites you about joinging the Corps).  If not, you might want to steer towards something you can use outside of the military - figure out your desired civilian professions and look at the military equivalents.  There are a lot of military professions that cross over, and some (like helicopter pilots) are quite often military-trained.  If you go infantry you can find yourself 4 years later a veteran with no job skills.<br>  <br>  If you want to go career you had better pick something that really interests you, preferably in a core area like infantry where there are lots of opportunities for advancement.  The good news is that when you finally leave you will (assuming you stick it out) have retirement to draw on while you get back on your feet.  Even if you have no job skills you will have support while you acclimate to civilian life.|`|YOr5LBB4aa	legal clerk.|`|LZlS3H5oaa	my daughter and son in law are in the army and have been for quite a few years and have been to iraq and afgan and other places they went to school (college) and are still going kind of one of those things you decide when you get in there and talk to your recruiter and what your interests are|`|xEHECtjraa	whatever MOS interests you infantry aviation etc.. oh yeah and for the idiot a green b-e-r-e-t is army spec ops not a marine|`|2qyIInrdaa	green buret
AA10057599	first of all your not going to have enough time to finish college to even get an appointment for ROTC.  you MUST be no older than 28 at the time of appointment to qualify.  you may be able to get an age waiver if you were in the SMP program.<br>  <br>  look into the "college first" program for the ARMY reserves.|`|JOXQrsw0aa	If you are 27 and can meet the requirements and depending when you turn 28 you might still qualify for the Army's ECP.  While in the ECP and after commissioning and while attending a 4 year university to earn a degree, an ECP 2nd Lt. is in a non-deployable status. SMP is also possible with ECP:<br>  <a href="http://www.vfmac.edu/ecp.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.vfmac.edu/ecp.html</a><br>  <a href="http://www.marionmilitary.edu/programs/ecp-requirements.da" rel="nofollow">http://www.marionmilitary.edu/programs/e...</a> <br>  Good Luck!<br>  <br>  Additional Details:  If you are interested in the ECP call and ask about the age requirement. It seems that it means 27 on the day the application is due in May. If it means 27 on the day classes begin then you'd probably be 28 for about a week at VFMA , but ok at MMI since last year classes began Aug 20.  Students in NG  are non deployable for the first two years of College if they choose  the College First Enlistment Option. Then they are non-deployable the last two years after contracting for the ROTC Professional Officers Course. I thought SMP only was possible  during the last two years of ROTC. Students  in ECP take the LTC(Leaders Training Course) at Fort Knox Kentucky in place of the first two years of College ROTC.  And are nondeployable during the POC(Professional Officer's Course). Then when attending the 4 year university as ECP 2nd Lt, they are in a non deployable status. They go on active duty as a 1st Lt. The time spent getting their  4 year degree counts as time in grade for pay purposes.|`|FNMMm7Dnaa	YOU WON'T GET DEPLOYED WHILE IN ROTC,YOU ARE CONSIDERED A COLLEGE STUDENT , HOWEVER ONCE YOU GRADUATE YOU COULD BE DEPLOYED, IF YOU GO AF, THE YOU GET DEPLOYED AS ENLISTED ,YOU WON'T HAVE TIME TO TAKE COLLEGE COURSES CAUSE YOU ARE CONSIDERED A SOLIDER  FIRST.|`|5Md4pLtyaa	If your looking to serve and finish college then I reccomend, National Guard.  They give the most money for school and I promiose that you will serve. Giving you a few years experience while going to college at the same time.  Upon finishing college you have the opportunity to go officer and now you are a Mustang, you have enlisted experience, you have a lot more respect from your subordinates when you have that experience and you have time in grade as an enlisted giving you an edge on the other officers your ranck, offering a step up on promotions.<br>  ROTC is kind of a Joke, you get laughed at by the enlisted because whlie you could have been in the reserves or national guard getting real experience you took a college course and showed up one moring a week to llok at a compass on the intramural fields.  Active duty is an option but if you are wanting to go to college you willnot really have the time to do so while balancing your other duties, especially the first 6 years while getting yourself established in the military.<br>  My advice and I believe to be the best, Air National Guard, or Army National Guard.
b8svqAMAaa	If you were accused of stealing and you didn't you can file a lawsuit against the store.  Especially if they detained you or embarassed you in front of other people at the store.  The store's loss prevention officer or security is not allowed to contact you or accuse you of stealing until you actually walk out the doors without paying.  Even then, they would have had to of watched you from beginning to end... meaning, see you take the item, stash the item on your person, walk past all points of payment areas and then exit the store with the item.  If at any time they lost site of you during this they are not supposed to make the contact with you.  If you didn't have the item on you when they contacted you, you have a good case.  Even if you did take something and then get rid of it before exiting the store.  Whatever the case, if you feel you were wronged, you should contact the loss prevention supervisor and tell your story.  If a loss prevention person got your plate, I wouldn't worry too much about it.  If you took something and they found the item on you after leaving, they would have placed you under citizens arrest and called the police.  Sometimes they only call the police if the item was over a certain price.  You are probably in the clear.  I don't think the police department is going to go out of their way to find you because loss prevention provided them with a license plate.  Hope this helps.|`|1bfd6f647a73749c637495a4c269b837aa	Don't worry.<br>  <br>  If they filed a report, the police will come find you.|`|vG0tsqJtaa	They will probably just send you a summons via mail.  Maybe an officer will hand deliver.<br>  Not sure why you would just run away from problem, instead of trying to stay and clear your name.  Sounds a little fishy.|`|zIFC0owqaa	You need to contact the local police dept where the store is located, explain to them the situation and ask them to check to see if any reports were filled on that day.<br>  <br>  I would also file a complaint with the store so that you have that on record just in case anything was to come back later down the road. <br>  <br>  Hope this helps.|`|ESAVdvdxaa	I wouldnt worry as long as you didnt steal the plates. The police will track the number plate and then will track your details. They will then contact you. You can then relay the story as to why the store thinks you stole something.
O6x1CTd4aa	Yes the checks will go out at the end of May|`|hmsMpECkaa	They are one of the first to receive the stimulus but $250 was the first stimulus.  I don't know how the second one is gonna happen or how much.  Obama said they were in the mail in his speech the other night to Congress.  But, his tongue is spotted.  He was probably talking about the first ones that should have been delivered.|`|vN2PUynoaa	I don't know, but they shouldn't.<br>  <br>  If they are getting it then they are already getting free money.
