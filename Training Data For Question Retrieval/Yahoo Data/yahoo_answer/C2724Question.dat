I have been offered to free lease a 15 y/o 15.2 hh grey Andalusian x quarter horse gelding with TONS of experience (He is a awesome  schoolmaster and he has a super sweet personality) . Problem is he has a  problem with one of his back fetlocks, but it is not showing up at all and it might not have any problems, but in the future who knows?      The lady who owns him now is wondering if I might want to buy him (She possibly might even give him to me) in the future, she does not want me leasing him for 5 years then giving him back when he is too old to ride. So what would you do? Just lease him for a while, gain some experience, then return him? Or possibly consider buying / keeping him?

I know you have all answered so many questions about foaling ...I have read a lot of them to help me get information...But i have a few more questions. Her vulva has been getting bigger for about 3-4 days now...she is bagging up and her teats are extending. The baby kicks like crazy and she is really big. Her hind quarter(rump) is soft, but the only thing i cannot figure out is that last night when i was cleaning her stall out she peed a white liquid then it changed to a regular color. does anyone know what caused that? i have no idea how long she has been in foal for because we got her from my grandma and she didn't even know that she was pregnant. Thank you for helping!   2 days ago - 6 days left to answer.    I just went out to her because i heard her neighing but when i got out there she was just standing out in the sleet i put her back in the building and she seems to be breathing harder...and resting both her feet continuously...i know she will have it soon but any comments?

20090309135127AAyQwJI	Pets;Cats	Male cat, skin disorder, causes unknown...?	I have spent thousands of dollars in the last 3 years on my cat.       I believe my cat has either miliary dermatitis, acral lick granuloma, or I fear it may even be Neurogenic dermatitis.       He has a major problem with itching and not letting the sores heal. It started with a simple little lesion under his ear on the base of his neck that he caused by scratching over 3 years ago (I witnessed the violent scratching and the lesion that appeared after the first episode). I have spent thousands of dollars on regular vets for the last 3 years so please don't lecture me. I need results. If you can name it, it has probably already been tried. I think the regular vets are using my cat for profits now. The last vet called him a "medical mystery".       I just wanted to know if anyone else out there has experienced this before and if so, who did you go to after all the vets simply gave up, did it work, and what did they do to fix the problem?

I'm about to get two half Ragdoll kittens and after researching the Ragdoll breed on the internet I have read to never let them outside unsupervised due to their docile nature.      I cannot help but feel that it would be unfair to keep them inside.. especially considering they are only half pedigree and not full.      The internet assures me however, that this is not unfair but the cats own preference and for their safety.       I have not had Ragdoll cats before so I would be grateful to hear your opinions. What would you advise that I do - let them out or keep them in?      Thanks in advance.

20090309143443AA7mWfc	Pets;Cats	I have an indoor/outdoor cat, in an apartment?	Here is the issue:   1.) I have been in my apartment for about 7 years   2.) I took in a stray cat 4 years ago   3.) We are in a pet friendly apartment complex   4.) I never declared the cat to the landlord   5.) There has been a complaint within the past 6 months from the neighbors about the cat.   a.) First the neighbors said they are "afraid of cats"   b.) Then they said they are "allergic to cats"   6.) We are mellow quiet neighbors, we don't bake cookies and pass them around, but we clean up around our common area.  We turn down our TV and/or music by 9 pm.  In 7 years we haven't complained about anything and resolve our own problems if any (none).   7.) There are neighbors that smoke and flick butts in the bushes or stay out on the porch past midnight, they get in everone's business.   8.) There are also neighbors that have TWO pit bulls that are NOT allowed in the complex, but they NEVER take them out because they have to keep them hidden from the landlord (God forbid the day they escape).  None of the neighbors are free from some complaint, I mean we even have a neighbor that has teenagers and we all know those kids "friends" have been tagging around the complex - every Saturday, Sunday and Monday morning, I walk around and paint over it.  The list of bitchn is endless, it seems like the everyone is just nickling each other, its almost childish...   9.) The apartment complex sent out one letter warning about 5 months ago about the dangers of coyotes and the need to keep "cats" in at ALL times (? how in the world am I going to keep Houdini in ALL the time is an unreasonable request, I would have to keep the windows and doors closed all the time).   10.) My fear is that the landlord will have animal control take the cat.      Do you recommend -   That we license the cat and declare the cat (we understand there maybe an additional deposit required) OR is there really anything the apartment complex can do? Isn't a cat considered almost wild - how do you keep a cat in the house, seems cruel to me...      I don't know, throw suggestions, comments, jabs, jokes, insults, french fries...  Its all go... We are just trying to figure out if we have any options here...      Thanks,

20090309143807AAfrL1j	Pets;Dogs	Have you used Aveeno oatmeal bath treatments for a dog?	My dog has severe allergies - most likely to food. He's been on a downward spiral for the past month and he is now on prescription ultra-low allergen food (z/d), Temaril-P, and Douxo calm shampoo and spray. It's been a rough ride so far, but we now have to ride out a food trial for 3 months without expecting any improvement in the next month or so...      Anyway, as I was driving home from the vet's today I remember that when I had a serious reaction to penicillin a couple of years back, the only thing that kept me from scratching my skin raw were aveeno oatmeal baths. This dog's skin is so irritated, so red and lumpy and he cringes at our touch. He's so miserable that he lies on the floor and shakes like he's freezing cold - something the vet attributes to the severe generalized itching and discomfort. Can I use Aveeno baths on a dog? I think the effect would be faster than the Douxo spray and it is not toxic in any way.      Any advice?      P.S.: I know all about holistic premium food and I hate Hill's as much as anyone else, so please don't tell me that this is all a food change away from a cure, ok? Been there, done that. At some point, when your dog is giving up and losing all its hair, you kind of have to trust your vet.

Normally it runs away but today it let me pet it.      Do you think I should adopt it? Because if somebody owns it, they wouldn't let it sit in garbage all day right?      .. argh, but I can barely take care of myself. No job, no income, and my apartment is a mess.

Or trapped inside, it might get fat & depressed.   *My dad is allergic, but I've lived with cats before without problem.      But it would be nice to have a friend around.

I guess I cant have both in my 90gal tank so I was thinking of selling off the fish in my 20 gal and using that for the convicts.  Can a convict breeding pair live in a 20gal tank or is that to small?      Also is it even wise to have a convict breeding pair in a small tank?  I herd that when they have fry the male will sometimes start attacking the female as soon as he figures out that theirs no other threats in the tank? (ie other fish)      Is that true?

Thanks to the great answers i know he can but now i'm uncertain:      When he was a little younger I tried to leash train him but his harness choked him. I believe it was because it was to small, but its the largest they had for the cats. Should i use a small dog harness? If so any suggestions on the style, type and maker? I'm in my senior yr of high school and as such don't have much money so something that is on the cheaper side but strong and durable is preferred.

20090309160450AAzd51m	Pets;Horses	Horse founder question?  (also involves Insulin Resistance)?	this is going to be really long- just skim through it, you'll get the just of it.   My Quarab 20 year old mare has been on and off founder for the last year or so.  we could usually control it until she became insulin resistant, and there was a hay crisis in the province which I live in.  All the hay is too rich.  at the farm that my mare is boarded at, there are 5 foundering horses.  I don't blame these people, there's founder all over the place, our vet reports.  We are now considering putting our mare down.  It takes her nearly to exactly a minute to walk about 3 metres or so.  It's not fair, because I watched her struggling just to get some water.  Should we stop considering putting her down and start considering keeping her in a stall?  She is fine in stalls, she won't panic, so her foundering leg should be fine.   Brief history:   Started foundering early 2008.   Mid-2008, she got an abcess in the hoof she founders on (left front)   14.1 hh, 850 pounds.   Tested for cushings disease.  Came back negative.   insulin resistance tested.  positive.   mid-early 2008- allergic reaction- unknown what it was.      So, we also would like to know what insulin resistance and/or founder are symptoms of.  Also, other than cushings disease, what is a long, hard to shed coat a symptom of?   Sorry for the long description!

20090309162102AAYEgdY	Pets;Horses	Why do people have such issues with older horses?	It kind of bothers me that whenever I post or see a post about problems with a horse over 18 it's automatically because of it's age. I know that's sometimes the problem, but I know tons of horses over 18 that still do shows, jump, and are completley sound. My arab laps all the horses we're in the ring with, and even a 5 year old can't out run him. You can't really judge a horse by it's age, it's how sound it is. And a lot of these people who make posts are like 'o its old it cant b ridden' but do they even have any experience??? It seriously bugs me. So from some of you who post those really vague, misinformed answers, do you actually have any experience? Or is it just an assumption? If you don't know what you're talking about then don't answer.      Haha sorry, guys, I went on a bit of a rant there :) But I want to know, if the horse is sound then why do all these people be like ooo retire it. It really bothers me.

This of course is untrue because my extended family ALWAYS gladly watches our pets. It seams like I can't get a good reason.      How can I get them to let me adopt a kitten? I even offered to keep the liter box in my room! They loved my old cat Blueberry so I don't see why it is a big deal! Can I have some advice form parents too? By the way I am 15.

20090309154704AAZkAr3	Pets;Reptiles	What kind of reptile should I get?	I was looking at a bearded dragon, some kind of frog, or some kind of snake.      I have no problem with feeding them insects, but the thing is I dont really know what I want in a reptile pet, are they affectionate? Im guessing not, but hey im not an expert. I have read that bearded dragons have a lot of tank requirements, and that frogs have easier tank requirements, but I havent read much on snakes yet.      So if you could contrast these reptiles, it would really help me out. If you need to ask me some questions then ill answer any of them.      btw I know frogs arent reptiles, but amphibians.

20090309152626AAqaFBw	Pets;Rodents	How to catch a loose "pet" rat?!?	I had 2 pet rats, and one died, so my mom got another one (i said no, and she didn't listen). But the problem is...he was really tiny, and he squeezed through the bars of the cage, and became "wild," and now he has a little (stinky) home under a bookshelf. One day, he went back into the cage, so I reached in to grab him, and he bit me, (made me bleed ='[) and ran out. Now, he's full grown, and has ruined the carpet under the bookshelf by ripping it up and using it as a nest. I NEED to catch him, so, i guess, how to catch a wild rat without killing him, but if i really have to, i will.

20090309161223AA1fKG2	Pets;Dogs	What are the alternatives to clicker training?	I just tried to do clicker training with my dogs today, and I should have guessed what would happen.  My 3 year old responded well, but my older dog, who is terrified of loud noises, especially sudden ones, freaked out.  Bits of chicken were not appealing to him in his state of fear, and he just shook until I let him escape upstairs.  Having had many traumatic experiences as a puppy (including having his mother shot) makes it very difficult to train him now that he is old.  So I need something that is not so aversive sounding, but still unique enough for them to associate it with treats, and something small enough to carry with me at all times.  Any suggestions?

I don't usually ask these type of questions, but what do you think about this breeder?       http://www.tamaronvizslas.com/       On the website its manly about them. There dogs, the champions etc etc. Not to much about there puppies, because they only breed on occasion, which i find very good.      This is not on there website but this is what Tami(the breeder) wrote on an add-      Our Vizsla puppies come with a 3 year health guarantee, and parents are AKC Champions who are OFA cleared. Puppies have an OUTSTANDING pedigree which reflects many of top Vizslas in the breed's history. Puppies will be socialized in our home and the foundation for crate training and housebreaking will be started. Our breeding goal is to improve the Vizsla, therefore, we do not breed often. Our puppies can Show, Hunt, do Obedience or Agility or simply sit in your lap, they are truly Versatile Vizslas. We are members of Vizsla Club of America, Rio Salado Vizsla Club (AZ) and Vizsla Club of Northern California. Do not settle when looking for a puppy. Do your research before selecting a "breeder" and buying a puppy. Not all breeders are reputable. For more information on our dogs, or to be considered for our puppy wait list, please contact me.         What do you think? Good breeder?

20090309163310AA95FQ9	Pets;Dogs	How bad is it to get two puppies at different times, in terms of territorial issues?	My best friend and I plan to move in together soon. She wants to get a Shih Tzu of her own. I want to get a Chocolate Labrador myself. Up until yesterday, we planned on getting the Shih Tzu first and then waiting a little bit to get my lab.      Yesterday, a mutual friend of ours said that it would be bad to get them seperately because the dogs could get territorial [we both want male puppies by the way and we will neuter them as soon as possible.. haha give em the Bob Barker treatment :P]. My bestie and I had not thought about that up until that point.      How bad would it be to get the dogs as we planned? Because if we get them at the same time, it'll be double the poop and pee and it could affect the bonding and the potty training and all of that.      what do you think is best?

20090309154909AA7SKLy	Pets;Dogs	Need suggestions for RE-Crate-Training?	How can I get my 13yr old Chihuahua to stop peeing in his crate?  He was crate trained when I got him 3 years ago...and did well when I was gone for the day.        I have been unemployed, and around the house a lot more, and now whenever I leave, and for a while, even put a blanket in his crate to keep him warm....but he started peeing on the blankets so I took them out.  He pees in his crate pretty much every time I leave him, despite the fact that I took him out to do his business (and he does it) before I left.      Lately, I have been resorting to putting pee pads in his crate when I leave so that it will soak up any messes he makes (that's probably not the best thing, I know...) but now every time I come home...the pads are not only wet, but shredded up....I'm so frustrated at this point...I'm having to rinse out his crate every day!!  I just don't know what to do to re-train him....any suggestions.

Then just a couple days ago my friend got a bunny from a lady who couldn't keep it because of her daughter's allergies. So she gave it to me so my bunny can have a friend. We named it Uoof. At first Uoof and Thymine got a long GREAT in the cage. In fact they started mating but then today every-time Uoof came near Thymine she would run for her life or curl up and start growling, which i know is like a cat's hiss... which is not good at all. I don't know if its because she is pregnant and just aggressive due to that or if Uoof is doing something to her i don't know of, although it doesn't seem like Uoof is hurting Thymine. Or is Thymine upset that she has to share her cage with another. What can it be and should i get a bigger cage. Or what?         Thymine also have yellow brownish cream stains (like pee?) on her head. What might it be?

They really have been good as gold and around two months ago, i introduced them to the outside world.  Minstrel was very keen to explore (dominant one of the two) whilst Crunchy was very apprehensive to the idea and ran away as soon as i opened the front door!   They have all the medical treatment they require to go outside but they now seem more happy to be inside.  Minstrel bolts straight out the front door when i open it and Crunchy gingerly follows sometimes but they just loiter out the front and cry to come in 5 Min's later.  Just recently we have started opening the windows in the house and they are fascinated by them and jump in and out, but again, they don't venture far at all.  I want them to explore more outside as i think it's healthy for them, how should i go about doing this?   Also, i want them to start going the toilet outside, what is the best method for weaning them off the litter tray?   Any sensible comment will be appreciated.   Thanks

In your opinion, could short-term fostering (one dog for a period of two weeks, constant trading of dogs) be considered an acceptable form of slight socialization?      I was just thinking this because in my experience, people who foster frequently (generally have two dogs in one month, separate times), and have pets of their own have very well adjusted pets. I've never met a frequent foster parent with a poorly socialized dog (mine included).       Your opinion?

20090309165735AAW4aTS	Pets;Horses	Which barn...? Please help!?	Ok well my parents are deciding to move soon. And we got a couple places we are interested in. But anyway, one of the places is pretty close to where I already live. So I would be able to keep my horse at the same barn. But it would be an extra few minutes. So probably around 22-25. I already think the drive is pretty long. But anyway, if we decide to build on our property in this place, there is also another barn that is a bit closer. I got to say it is really nice. But it is a little higher priced so therefore I might have to do outdoor board. My mare is currently indoor boarded(like outdoor in the day, box stall at night). It also gets REALLY cold here in winter(Yep, canada!). And I was thinking of doing indoor in like the winter months. But the prices are a bit high for us so I was still thinking of getting a part time job in the summer to help with that(I wouldn't be moving her right away anyway, probably not even for a year).       But one thing that sucks is my mare has 2 really great horse friends(actually one of them you may as well call a boyfriend) and she is even almost inseparable with one of them. I would hate to make them separate. I also am really good friends with their owners so I would miss those girls too. I just don't know what to do right now.       Here is a link to the website of the barn I am interested in:  http://standrewsstables.com/home/        The current barn, my mare is in a paddock with 2 other horses(her friends). At this new barn, she would be in a bigger pasture with more horses.       What do you think I should do? I don't need to decide right away and we aren't even sure about moving to the place closer by it. But yeah, what do you think? And what board should I do(go to services on the site and click on boarding)? I can't really afford the best board right now. Like if I did indoor for winter or whatever, I would probably do the one called "Group Board". But then again, stalls may not even be available in their barn in the winter. So I am still not sure.

They are both albino Campbell's dwarf hamsters. There's also a Winter White hamster in that picture (the darker one); ignore him, I just put him in the pics for breed comparison.      Anyway, I lifted on their little house inside their cage when I got home from work about half an hour ago, and what did I see!? Little jelly bean-looking things, deeply buried under a ton of bedding. They were all wiggling.      Now what do I do? I thought the female was pregnant, but I didn't know she'd deliver so soon! Remember that I've only had these hamsters for three days! Before that they were in a much larger colony, but in the same colony.      1) Do I remove the male from the cage? They both came from the same colony, but I'm unsure if he is the father. Can he endanger the mother/pups if he somehow knows he's not their biological father, or will he be a good little supportive hamster and help the female regardless of fatherhood? He seems to stay away from her right now, and she has been squabbling with him since I got them two days ago.      2) What do I do in terms of helping the mother? Action through inaction? Do I stay the heck away for a few weeks? What do I feed her? Can I handle her? She's only known me for three days.      3) Since I got them two days ago, and they're in a new scary environment, how worried should I be of the mother cannibalizing the pups? I mean she only just moved in to her new cage three days ago, and then had a litter. She must be scared to death, and I'd feel terrible if she ended up cannibalizing them. Can someone give me the odds...?      4) Can I clean the cage?      5) Anything else I need to know/do?

20090309172329AAaDB7Y	Pets;Reptiles	What should I get as my next reptile?	I have a reptile expo coming to town in May, and I'd really love a new addition.      There are SO many reptiles I'd like to have right now, but I need to wait until I move out on my own to actually care for this huge dream collection. Anyway, I need a few ideas because at the last show there was a lot of snakes, but not a lot of lizards/turtles/tortoises.      I know I would like a Russian or Greek tortoise at one point. I like how they stay small, and hopefully don't smell as bad as turtles I've had. I don't particularly want to set up an aquatic enclosure. As a matter of fact, I'm becoming quite fond of the tub set ups rather than tanks. I'm also thinking about getting into frogs, which is a first for me. I know last time they had a bunch of baby tree frogs-- so hard to resist. The thing is, all the animals I have and have had were easily holdable, so it might kill me. Like I said, before I get into something huge, I'd like to be living out on my own. My boa dreams will have to wait, unless I see a nice Hogg Island. (:      Okay, I'm rambling. Just tell me about what you have, some basic requirements perhaps. Temperaments would be nice, past experiences. I'm not into leopard geckos or beardies. No corn snakes, balls, milks or kings either. Other than that, just give me some input!

20090309170327AAlfbGl	Pets;Dogs	*Pix Included* So I got a really cute puppy and I want to know if I can sell her later puppies?	Her mother (also my dog) is a pure bred Rat Terrier who preferred to go get involved with the chihuahua next door then the other pure bred boyfriend we gave her so we could sell pure bred rat terriers.       But the puppies resulted in an absolute cuteness. The puppies are very very small and fluffy. She's about eight weeks now and can still sit on my hand. I went across town with my new puppy and everyone wanted to know if I was selling her siblings.       I don't think it's illegal to sell dogs even if they aren't pure bred. Just Do you think anyone would buy them for lets say $100?             http://i575.photobucket.com/albums/ss200...           http://i575.photobucket.com/albums/ss200...           http://i575.photobucket.com/albums/ss200...

20090309172107AAA66VI	Pets;Rodents	Is this a bad idea to get another pet?	My dog is almost three years old, a female pug, and is very sweet and energetic. however, from what we've seen she doesn't like being around other dogs.   Now, I really want a hamster. For some reason, I'm just really into getting one. However, I don't know if my dog will  be too happy about another pet - even one that small. I know how to take care of a hamster, my sister used to have one a while ago, so that's not the problem. My only concern is if my dog will do anything to hurt it if I get one. Does anyone know what I should do?   PS - my dog isn't usually aggressive, but she does bite sometimes.

I have a 1yr old doberman mix that i adopted in september, and i have a 1yr old shepherd mix that i have had since a puppy.  Sometimes when i go to pet them one of them  will start a fight. i have been breaking it up by grabbing both of them by the collar and making both of them lay on the ground and holding them there, when i let them up they will try to go at it again but i interrupt them and they usually stop.  the last time they fought i got bit on my forearm.  i have read about stopping the fight by grabbing their back legs, but don't think it would work in my case especially if both dogs are being aggressive.  my doberman mix weighs about 90lbs and the shepherd mix 60lbs. i wouldn't have a problem lifting the dogs its just if both are being aggressive how can one person control both dogs?

20090309164438AAhA6qG	Pets;Fish	What common household items can you use as a good tank for betta fish?	I have just bought a betta fish earlier last week. We've kept him in a jar and he seemed fine for the first day. The next day, he seemed really... down and scared. I tried putting him in the dark and warming him up a bit just in case he was stressed out but I'm not so sure it's working. He's lost interest in food too. And I have a feeling his color's not the bright red it used to be. I got him from Petland and... yeah. I think it's because he doesn't have much room so I need to know what common household items I could use instead of that tiny jar. If space isn't the case, then please tell me what you think it is.      Thanks.

20090309164358AAQrkS9	Pets;Dogs	Quick questions about altering my dog:?	My female dog is scheduled to be spayed. My vet said two things that I later got to wondering about and I wondered if anyone could clarify?      1. The dog must be checked for heartworms before the procedure because the usual anathesia they use causes the heartworms to move...She can still be spayed using a different sleep drug, if the test comes up positive correct? (I thought the heartworm testing was done when she got her 1st set of shots.)      2. The vets also cannot spay a dog 1 month after she goes "in season". It shouldn't be a problem since I adopted her about a month ago and she had been "in season" while she was at the pound, but I was wondering exactly what sort of problems it poses?

20090309165242AAtcG2r	Pets;Dogs	What can I do to help my fearful Border Collie?	I have an 8 month old border collie/australian shepherd that has, since I got her at 8 weeks, shown fearful behavior.  I've tried to socialize her by taking her to classes and, when she was old enough, the dog park.  Unfortunately, I don't have any friends with dogs in the area.  She has gotten in the habit of barking at strangers with her tail between her legs and her ears down (not continuous barking, just one or two warning barks it seems) even though it is clearly obvious once their back is to her that she really wants to be pet by them (wagging tail and trying to walk after them). When she is near more extroverted, dominant dogs she cowers and might eventually snap.        Two months ago she was hurt by a lab at the dog park because her and the lab were both trying to possess one of the park tennis balls and she ended up needing to get stitches and antibiotics. Not long after that she was spayed, so it has been a while since she has been back to the dog park.  I took her today and she seemed very clingy and possessive of me and SO much more fearful than normal. She was fine with the people there but not the dogs (larger dogs. She's too big for the small dog park but small for the big dog park). I don't want to reinforce her fear but I'm afraid that if I don't call her to me when she's frightened by the other dogs, that she will snap and get herself hurt.  At the dog park, she wants to defend herself more often than be submissive.  She's not a mean dog. Quite the opposite. She only gets aggressive when she feels cornered. Her hot and cold behavior confuses me and I'm not sure what to do about it. She's a border collie/australian shepherd so it's really hard for me to accept not being able to take her to the dog park where she can run. What should I do? How can I help her? Is it goodbye forever to the dog park?

20090309172930AA2SeJY	Pets;Cats	Home remedy for a cat with a puncture infection? Any vets opinions would be appreciated.?	Ok, ok... I have read through a lot of these questions and I know the first thing you are going to tell me is to take him to the vet and that if I cannot afford a vet that I should not have a cat, right? Well, the cat is not mine first of all. He is an outside cat that has obviously gotten in a fight and I refuse to not even try to help. Secondly, I did call an emergency vet clinic and they wanted $85 just to look at him. They told me that I could surrender my rights and give him to the humane society, but they also told me that if the humane society said that his treatments would cost too much that they would just put him down. To me, I cannot just give him up like that with the possibility that they could just kill him. So, now that I have explained my reasoning... can anyone help?      His right cheek is swollen very large. When I called the vet, they said that I could use warm water with Epsom salt on a wash cloth to clean it and try to help the swelling. Well, I did and I went to check on him and it had started bleeding quite a bit, but the swelling was going down incredibly. So, I cleaned him up again and put some triple antibiotic ointment on him and let him get some rest. When I woke up this morning he was not nearly as weak as he was last night and he was very cheery, but some of the swelling came back. He has been eating and drinking and has a will to live where other cats would have probably just given up. I want to help him in any way I can, but a vet visit is out of the question. If I had the money to take him, I would in a heart beat. But I just don't.
20090309173247AAqqUV7	Pets;Cats	My cat keeps eating my plants!!?	Ok so my boyfriend and I adopted a 3 year old cat about 4 months ago. He has been a great cat and has fit into our lives perfectly until recently. In our condo we have a couple ferns, some bamboo and some other plants that I have had for a couple years. Recently, he has been attacking the plants and breaking the stocks on them so he can chew at them. We tried moving them to a higher place or a more crowded place so he can't jump up but at night and when we aren't home, he always seems to find someway to get them. To make things worse sometimes he will throw up the leaves that he has eaten. We have tried disciplining him by telling him NO and sometimes putting him in the spare bedroom. Any suggestions to make it more clear to him what he is doing is wrong??

When we got her she was several hundred pounds under weight, had a massive skin infection, was afraid of people messing with her mouth, and was an overall mess. Since coming into my care she has gained some much needed weight, has overcome her fear of having her mouth messed with, and her skin infection is almost gone. The only problem left is that she has hardly any muscle. It's all soft, almost like jello, from being left on her own and without food for so long. I have been riding her lightly, but am afraid to do too much and risk injuring her. I know lunging would probably help, but I have never done it before. Any suggestions?

20090227094904AAB81Xu	Pets;Other - Pets	How do i get my neighbor's dog to shut the @$%# up?	First off, we live in a townhouse complex; thus, there is only a brick wall that divides each unit up. It's thick enough so we don't hear things like music or television, but thin enough to where we can hear that little burden bark all day.      Here's the thing: My gal and I love our neighbors. We're all very good friends. However, one of them tends to be very emotional and can easily hold gudges over stupid crap, e.g., someone parking in her space etc. I've never really seen anyone get angry so fast to be honest. This makes me cautious when talking about their dog. They love that thing; it's like their child. However, I want to beat the crap outta that thing so bad I can't stand it.      They have a lil' chiwawatever. Every time I go over to visit, the dog will start getting all snarly/barky, as if I'm some type of threat or something. And let me tell you this, this little dog can make the horn of a mac truck sound like a mouse fart. I know I could end that thing with one good punt, but I'm not that kind of person.      How can I get this thing to shut up without hurting the neighbors feelings? They have asked in the past if we can hear her, but I replied with a stupid "no", because I'm too light-hearted or something.      Is there any type of sound or trick I can play so the dog will shut up? Maybe something like a shut-the-f%$ up dog whistle? Do you have any ideas how I can gently bring this up without sounding like a puts?      thanks.
20090309182207AAtL6Ex	Pets;Dogs	Is my chihuahua too clingy or too active or something?	i just adopted it last week, it really wants to spend her whole time with me. and if she is not sleeping, she is sniffing. so it makes me wonder if she wants to eliminate, so i have to take her out.       and when i take her out, she can urinate several times. the first day, when i got her home without the leash, she literally urinated inside the house 3 times in less than 20 mins. i think that her previous owner probably didn't train her properly. she doesn't have that typical sniffing act before she needs to eliminate. during last week, she was sleeping on my lap fine. when i got up to do something, she immediately ran to another room, and urinated on the floor on two occasions. Another time, she defecated right by the tv, and i didn't even know when she did it. i was in the same room!      to me, the only time that she is not doing anything is when she sleeps. when she is up, she is running around inside the house. and i don't know if she will eliminate again, so i have to follow her everywhere. if i just tie her down by myside, she can't stop walking around, trying to find something to chew, etc. she doesn't seem to be able to just sit on the floor and do nothing.       i obviously can't spend my whole free time with her. she is a chihuahua and terrier mix, about 1 year old. this whole thing is becoming a little stressful for me. so what is going on here? i am thinking about taking her back to the shelter.

20090227095711AAeM2hA	Pets;Dogs	My 2 dogs and their variety of food?	hey all,i have a 2 month old jack russell terrier , and i recently rescued an 8 month old labrador ,even though there is a huge difference in size but they became best friends,both females . there is one problem, my labrador is on the maxi junior dog food ,while my terrier is on the small junior dog food , they both sometimes love eating from each other's food ,which isnt good , i mean it would harm my 2 month old eating from the maxi breed dog food more than my lab eating the small dog food , no matter what i do she still wants to eat the large food , and i dont want her to , what can i do to make them eat their own food instead of exchanging food every now and then? i started feeding each one of them at a time and not together , but they both got used to me feeding them instead of eating from the plate ,they got used to me feeding them with my hand , but so far i found it a solution to the problem , do u have any other solutions that might help also ? , thanks for all good answers,really apreciated .       p.s theyr both indoor dogs and i wont keep my labrador out if u might find it a solution to keep their food seperated .

20090309181128AABrZFx	Pets;Dogs	Lol you hafta read this...please?	Okay so I have these incredibly nasty vitamins I hafta take and I dropped one today. They're bright red and you hafta swallow them...My dog happened to be standing near me and she eats anything so she took it and I was really worried since it may not have the same effect on her as it does on humans...So she started breathing all funny with her mouth all closed up and I though Oh my god, I've killed her! And then I noticed a bright red thing on her tongue...she didn't swallow it. I tried to get her to drop it but surprisingly, she was quick to oblige...my dog who eats anything won't eat mynasty vitamin. I am going to use that to prove to my mom how nasty they actually are. (lol, sometimes I even hide them around the house, they're that bad)

I have a litter of Boxers due on monday, and rather than get the Kennel club to choose their pedigree names i wanted to do it and follow a theme. Thinking weather or gem stones, as my ***** has both of these in her pedigree name. Ive thought of a couple but running out of ideas so wondering has anyone got a good imagination when it comes to thinking up names????? Needs to be something short and catchy and preferably something which could be translated to a pet name i.e Hurricane Henry - could be called henry?

20090227102222AAyO4V1	Pets;Cats	What to do with stray cat?	A stray cat has been coming to my house for a month now. She is really tame and I would like to keep her. However, there is one problem. She was in 'heat' recently and a lot of tom cats were 'hanging out' around the house. She is calmer now and does not want to go out a lot. I believe she may be pregnant cause she is not neutered. I do not have the time nor the funds to take care of her kittens and I was thinking of taking her for an 'abortion'. But the thought of that makes me feel bad. I just don't know what to do. I've read that it can be done, I want her neutered anyway. There are no decent animal shelters in my country, to take her or the kittens to. It is also very hard to find good homes for them. What should I do?

20090309181642AAO5Iyk	Pets;Horses	Is there any way of combining a bitless bridle with a soft bit on a double rein?	I have a very large, 10 year old, KWPN mare that has a very frisky temperament but has a very sensitive mouth. She's been abused (hit over the head) by the previous owner and he had a very strong hand so she's afraid of the bit. She tends to rear, buck, shake her head and even flip over when as soon as she feels contact on her mouth. My problem is that she's so large, strong and with very high temper so she's pretty dangerous to ride sometimes. On the other hand, when ridden bitless she tends to feel too free and goes out of control (sprints with no way of turning or stopping her), She's simply so large and strong that she doesn't even feel the rider on her back so she does whatever she wants. I was wondering if i could ride her on a bitless bridle but also have a soft bit on a second rein just for emergencies (somehow combine the two bridles). Something like the two-cheek dressage with a double rein. Is that even possible?

There is a pretty friendly fox thats been hanging around my house, so I took it in, looked up all the information on how to keep one, and he has been living with me for about a month, and I was just wondering...   Do I have to get him tags? And if so, what kind of collar would I get him?   I thought about a dog collar, but I'm not sure, I'm kinda dumb at this kind of stuff. He is very friendly, and acts like a dog, even sitting on command. Hes a little wiley, but hes cool at the same time.   I have a couple old belts that I could use to make a collar, and I was wondering if I could just cut one up and use it?   I'd like to make my own, but I'm not sure if he even needs one, and if her does, do I just get him normal dog tags?   I was just wondering...   Oh, and hes had all his shots, too.
20090227095607AAnkh8H	Pets;Dogs	Why wont this Chihuahua stop crying?!?!?	I am watching my cousins chihuahua for a couple weeks. I'll start by saying he is completely healthy, so that is not the problem. But all he does is cry, cry, cry. And it isn't just because he misses my cousin, or his home, because my cousin warned me before she left that "he cries all the time". It seems like he always wants something. I have never dealt with a chihuahua, and I am wondering if this is just an aspect of the breed or maybe he has just developed a bad habit. Please help if you have any info about chihuahuas.

20090227100821AAHBp5A	Pets;Cats	Are my cats fighting or just playing?	Three weeks ago, I adopted a one-year-old male cat from the shelter. I already had a female cat, also about one, that I raised from a kitten. She was spayed at six months, and he was spayed the day before he came home. I kept them completely separate for a week, then supervised visits of an hour or two (in "his" room) for several more days. When all appeared to be going well, I opened the door and let him find his way out into the rest of the house. He still is most comfortable in "his" room, but is extremely active all over the house, curious, plays with toys, chases things, lets me pet/brush him, and most importantly he has regained his purr - missing in the shelter - and I couldn't be more pleased with him. (He sheds like CRAZY but that is a separate question!) My female is much calmer and sweeter, but seems to be making friends with him. I do think he makes her nervous, because she won't let me pet her as much and picking her up makes her very unhappy. They will eat off opposite sides of a dish of food without protest, and once I woke up to find them curled up in my bed right next to each other. They have also shared a cat tree successfully. They chase each other back and forth, though he is clearly more the aggressor, but she seems to give it back, too. So this brings me to my question: A few times, he has chased her under the bed or into a corner where I can't see, and it sounds like they're fighting. (Most recently: 4 am today.) They're rolling around, and someone is yowling, and then I make it stop by hissing or yelling "No!" at them. Is this normal - are they just playing? Or is this bad behavior that I should be worried about and try to correct? I never had two cats before, and have never adopted an adult, so I don't know what to expect here. Do you think my female will become less nervous over time or have I ruined her nice, calm existence by introducing an irritating little brother who won't leave her in peace??
