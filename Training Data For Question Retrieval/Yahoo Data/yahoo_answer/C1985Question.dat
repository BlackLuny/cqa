I moved the box out of my cabinet thing onto the floor when i was playing and this seemed to help it. Another two games I have, Tomb Raider & Mirrors edge, are absolutely fine. But I started playing NFS and this plays for about 20 seconds before freezing, and keeps doing it. I pretty much can't play it, and theres nothing wrong with the disc.       Soo...im just wondering if this is a pretty regular problem and what peoples advice is? I have only had it for 6 weeks and dont wanna have to start removing the hard drive, as I don't want the warranty affected. Should I contact microsoft or would it be easier to just take it back to the shop seeing as i havent had it very long?       This is a bit of a long question but i'd appreciate any help

Ok, so basically I got the Nokia 5800 on contract yesterday. It's an amazing phone and stuff, but I'm a little confused about the GPS. I don't know if I'm being charged for it when I'm using it you see...       All the applications have their own network settings and then there's the network settings in the phone optinos - and I really don't know what connection is being used when really. I'm unsure if I've been charged for GPS usage so far, but I had a couple of questions regarding it; If I am being charged, is it likely to be much over general 'interest' usage over 1 day? Also, if I set the phones profile to 'offline', does that guarantee that no connection will be made via the phone's Wi-Fi and WAP, and that the connection will rely solely on the GPS function of the phone (Ie: it will be free when I used it).       Confusing topic I know - I'm just so confused as to whether it's safe to use GPS without charges or not... Thanks for any help =)

20090304100459AA1DteU	Consumer Electronics;Music & Music Players	I didn't charge my new iPod when i first got it, will this affect the battery life on the iPod touch?	Hi, like title said, i bough the iPod touch a few days ago and when i just bought it and came home i charged it for like 1-2 hours and then i started to use it.   When i bought the ipod it was like 75% charged.      So the question is: Since i didn't charge the ipod touch fully when i just bought it, will it then the battery life last shorter?   (Because it's this with mobile phones, you have to charge them fully and then even more maybe charge it overnight so the battery life will last long before needed to get charged again)      I got a iPod touch gen 2, btw. ;)      Please answer all my questions, thanks!

Surely Trading Standards should force the battery manufacturers to put this information on the packs of batteries so that, in much the same way that consumers get to compare foods of different nutritional value, they would be able to compare batteries and decide which suits their needs better. Exclaiming that 'now lasts 30% longer' isn't helpful as it is not absolutely quantitative.      Am I missing something here?

20090304111010AAIcH0h	Consumer Electronics;Cameras	Is there something wrong with my camera?	I have a canon eos 450D (Digital Rebel Xsi), and was taking photographs in my room, I first took a photo of the wall and a cord on the right hand side of the shot as a test, then, when i try to take a self portrait, it takes a remarkably long time to process the shot and bring it up on the review screen, and then when it did, I had no face. It seemed like the last shot I'd taken, off the wall, but very blurry, I took some more and it would seem like some of the time (Mostly in the creative zone modes) it would have the same affect of blurring, partial transparency etc, ruining my shot. yet in full auto mode the shot usually came out fine, and with no large delay in processing the image. Any Idea what's wrong? Why is the camera processing these images so slowly?, Why are my shots being distorted and messed up?      The camera is fairly new, about a month old. It comes with the standard 18-55 lens kit.

20090304115604AAplSLY	Consumer Electronics;Home Theater	Blu Ray: Sony BDP-S550 vs. Samsung BD-P2500/2550?	I'm looking to buy a Blu Ray Player and have narrowed it down to two players (the Panasonic is no longer available) the Sony BDP-S550 and the Samsung BD-P2500 (or the BD-2550). Please let me know your thoughts on which one you would buy. My BIG CONCERN is that my TV does not have HDMI so I have to connect via RGB cables, and the second thing is that I have about 300 or so standard DVDs so I need a Blu Ray that will do a good job on up-converting those over the RGB cables. Thanks for your help...also when you make your recommendation please let me know why. Thanks!
