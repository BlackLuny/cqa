20090222125316AAiTe6F	Food & Drink;Cooking & Recipes	When making a mousse pie, is it necessary to have crust extend up sides?	I am planning on making the following recipe:      Frozen Chocolate Mousse Pie Recipe   1 – 9" chocolate graham pie crust   1 cup semi-sweet chocolate mini morsels   1 – 14 ounce can sweetened condensed milk   1 teaspoon vanilla   1 cup heavy whipping cream, whipped   1 – 4 ounce tub non dairy whipped topping, optional   1/4 cup semi-sweet chocolate morsels, for garnish      Melt chocolate morsels in top of double boiler.   Pour into a large mixing bowl.   Add the sweetened condensed milk and vanilla beat until fluffy. Place in refrigerator to chill while preparing whipped cream.   In a large mixing bowl beat the whipping cream until stiff, fold into chocolate mixture.   Pour filling into the pie crust and place in freezer until firm, about 6 hours.   Slice firm pie and place on dessert plate and serve after your favorite meal.   You can top with a dollop of non dairy whipped topping and sprinkle with mini morsels if you like.      I'm not purchasing the graham crust. I'm going to make it myself. I'm wondering if it would work to use a springform pan, and have crust simply on the bottom. Would this work?

20090222185858AAQtHkT	Food & Drink;Non-Alcoholic Drinks	Silly question about tea.....?	i am from the USA , figure who better to ask a tea question then people who are known for there tradition of tea drinking, we drink coffee here much more then tea and we dont "do tea" the same as you guys ,that is where my question arises from...what is the purpose of a tea pot? when i make tea i heat water in a kettle then pour the hot water into a mug , or just fill a mug with water and heat the water in the microwave(i know thats probably crude to you but our culture is different keep that in in mind) i then add either a tea bag or if im drinking  loose leaf tea ill put the diffuser in, once it steeps i drink it, where does a tea pot come into play? do you heat your water in a ceramic highly decorated tea pot? or take the water from the kettle and put it in a ceramic tea pot and make your tea in that? why not just put your tea bags in the kettle you heat it in?       i kow this is a silly question but hey this website is all about asking questions so i figure why not give it a shot.
