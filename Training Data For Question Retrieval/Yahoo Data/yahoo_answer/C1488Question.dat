I came up with this but I don't if it makes sense.         Eines tages bauten die Schildburger end neues Rathaus, aber sie vergassen die Fenster.  Am n?chsten morgen was die erste Sitzung.   Es war sehr dunkel im Zimmer.  Der Bürgermeister empfahl das de Leute sie Sonnenstrahlen in s?cke füllen sollen und trugen sie ins zimmer.  Das Zimmer wurde nicht heller. Ein anderer hatten die Antwort. Sie holten erbsen und sie werfen sie überall um das Rathaus herum. Danach schoben die leute das Gebaude auf den Erbsen bis es unter der sonne und schnitten ein loch ins Dach.  Endlich wurde das Zimmer hell.  Pl?tzlich begann es zu regnen. Alle Burger wurden nass.  Niemand wusste was los war!

20090223155517AAkBNpI	Society & Culture;Cultures & Groups;Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual, and Transgendered	Hollywood's "Gay Rights" agenda? *again*?	I also have this posted in the politics      Is it a positive thing or a negative thing?   Sean Penn is huge on the importance of gays getting married yet he is very anti American and his own personal life has been full of divorces, adulteries, and severe emotional problems.   Brad Pitt and Angelina Jolie can't stress enough the important of marriage yet refuse to get married and are both the product of Divorce. Tim Robbins and Susan Surandon I would say are the best example of a good hollywood relationship yet they to refuse to get married. Just recently the two huge activists in MA were divorced from there Marriage which I think is fine personally, no reason to stay with someone you hate for a political ideal...forget that.      So is all this buzz from people who could care less about marriage good or bad? What are true good examples and why don't they get any buzz?

20090223164321AAIkCfY	Society & Culture;Cultures & Groups;Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual, and Transgendered	Is it wrong to do this?	To say you're gay/bi one week and the a few weeks later decide not be anymore?      I know this girl who I was a little close with who said she was bi. She went around and told everyone and kissed some girls (yeah me included). She talked about how she thought she had a little crush on me and I did like her. She wanted to go out with me, but I was a little involved with this boy so it didn't happen yet.      Well now, she decides she isn't bi anymore. 0_o   She really pissed a lot of people off, me kind of included, because I did really like her and she acted like she liked me. I understand if she wanted to "experiment" or whatever you want to call it, but did she have to go and tell everyone she was bi and practically track down every bi or gay girl in school and kiss them or be with them in some way? Some people are saying you can't just decide to be bi (or gay) and then decide to go back to being straight just as casually as that and I do agree. She acts like it didn't even affect her at all and it's just something she got bored with. I had to find out through someone else that she wasn't bi anymore and it hurt a bit. =/   Is this normal behavior for most teenagers? I would hope not...      And after all that talk about wanting to date me she's back to being as boy crazy as ever, leaving me to wonder if she was ever even bi to begin with. I still love her though.

20090223163746AACvoxg	Society & Culture;Cultures & Groups;Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual, and Transgendered	I really need help in a relationship in terms of the age of consent, common sense, legality etc. HELP PLEASE?	READ MY STORY FIRST PLEASSS!~      So I am gay and I met a guy online and I am 20 ABOUT TO JUST TURN 21.  Anyway I was looking for relationships near me I live in Montana.  I found one guy about 2 months ago that really liked me and I like him he told me he was 18 and it showed 18 on his profile.  HE LIVES 2 hours from me in a town called Kalispel and I have NEVER MET HIM YET.  He khem! showed me a picture of him naked he kinda said he wanted sex quite plainly......anyway I told him I am looking for something long term and he told me that's cool so was he actually and that he thought he thought I was really amazing--he seems like a sweetheart by the way.  Anyway.......about 2 days ago he says hey I have to tell you something....and I "please don't leave me or not talk to me just for this but, I am actually 17 I had to lie to get onto that dating web site" then he says I turn 18 in December (I don't think he is lieing this time and some of his pics are TAKEN IN KALISPEL I KNOW THIS BECAUSE I HAVE BEEN THERE many times).........Well I didn't know what to say or do I didn't want to hurt his feelings and be like **** off you lied or something.  In his pictures on myspace it's hard to TELL exactly how old he is I would guess NO LESS than 17 he looks more like 18 to 19 but it's hard to tell these days.  He also has friends which have commented his pics on myspace and I have asked  them if they have met him and they say YES.  Anyway I don't know what to do here....I don't feel like I am a pedophile or something just because he is 17 and I am soon to be 21.  That's only years difference or actually 3.8 or something but it happens all the time.  Is there something wrong with me?  I don't feel like I am doing anything wrong but am I being abnormal here?  Anyway we don't necessarily have to have sex anyway, but you never know how or when the government these days will start getting involved in your life.  How do I know it's not a government sting to try and get me in prison since he is 9 months from being 18?  Better question yet I have tried to find the age of consent for Montana and it's about impossible.  Some sites say 16 is the age of consent, some say 18, and some say 16 for straight relations and 18 for gay ones.  I looked up an actual consent law which is on the Montana governemnt web site and it's written exactly copied in the link bellow.  It basically says 16 is legal and anything bellow that there can only be 4 years ago difference.  I also heard some place though that that bill only applies to straight relationships not gay ones and that gay ones both partners had to be 18........I am so sad and confused about what to do here I fell for this guy who I thought I was 18..I feel like I am being tricked.  He says he wants too meet me and that he would talk to me on the phone.  He also gets upset when I talk to his friends...he tolds me he wants to keep this in the closet which I didn't know but I told him I thought that was cool.  Anyway what should I do I am crying and very sad scared and confused about the whole situation...should I meet him I mean what the hell do I do here???????????       http://www.ageofconsent.com/montana.htm

20070217140925AAoTOAO	Society & Culture;Religion & Spirituality	What is true repentance?	I ask this question on observing certain occurrences in scripture. At first glance I thought all these guys repented, but God did not deal with them the same way. He did not accept them all.      Saul (the king), after disobeying the command fo the Lord given through the prophet Sammuel - later admitted to have erred, but strangely the Lord did not view that as repentance. Saul was really sorry for what he did.      Another man, David (also the king) also committed great sin in the eyes of the Lord. In fact, David transgressed twice. He committed adultery with Uriah's wife, and arranged for Uriah to be killed at war. Later, he commanded census to be taken. Also even himself admitted that he ha sinned great on both occassions - but him, he received the favour of God, unlike Saul.      Another interesting man is Judas Iscariot who betrayed the Lord. This seemed to be sorry for what he did, to the extent that he returned the money that was given him. But he also did not find acceptance from God

20070320155019AA2wHLy	Society & Culture;Religion & Spirituality	To Satanists (and satanists only): What exactly are your beliefs?	From what I understand, a satanist is not the kind of person portrayed by the christian bible or evangelists where they go around sitting on people's shoulders telling them to commit sins, on killing sprees and drink innocent blood and bathe in fire, etc.       It's something I had recenly started thinking about. I mean, I know many of the beliefs that a christian holds, but what about someone who thinks of Satan the same way as one who might Jesus?      From what was explained to me, people are satanists because of the events that happened: He challenged god believing he should rule heaven, and was banished to hell with 1/3 of the angels from heaven (what I grew up learning in sunday school), or just by himself (according to a friend.) and that he has no remorse for any of it, apparently.      I would just like to know what the actual beliefs, and for someone to correct me if I'm wrong.      Thanks!

Take two people, one man who is a Christian doesn't hardly speak to the LDS man...until football season rolls around and suddenly they are blood-brothers with their faces painted and supporting the same football team...and they both swear the opposing teams fans are rude...but not them. Then you have two women who go to Church together...then a political elections happens and one's a Rep and the other is a Dem...they can't believe how stupid the other is. Two sisters who both love their families and have much in common yet one wants aboration to be legal, the other doesn't, they won't speak to each other. The atheist neighbor who grew up with a man down the same street, who's a Catholic. They used to be best friends...but words were spoken between them and they both were offened...now they never speak to each other. Religious choices, sports, politics, moral views, are these the things that divide us?

When I've asked a question and I get an answer offered in humilty and they respect an opposing view point I find they have more credibilty to their own view.   It's like when someone on yahoo answers ask a question like" Why are_____people so stupid?

20070304131039AAYeIoO	Society & Culture;Religion & Spirituality	(Question for Christians) Is it possible for a Reconciliation with members of the LDS?	(Disclaimer) I'm a Christian in a main-line Christian Church. I was wondering if you would ever see a possible acceptance or acknowlegement of the LDS as Christians. My church views the LDS church as a cult and I'm sure they look at me and my Church as a cult as well. I have met several of them at my front door and have several that are distant family relations etc. I really hate that there is this division between us, I know they are very good people and we have so many things in common, it just breaks my heart. It's like we have this distant cousin we don't speak of or speak too because of something bad a long time ago. I know they have the book of Mormon which we reject as truth...yet it does not sit well in my spirit to feel this way about such good people just like me...I don't sense the Holy-Spirit in this division. I have decided to view them as Christians and my friends and accept them and just know God will work out who is wrong later on...that feels right to me      You?
20070322152331AAEHPqQ	Society & Culture;Religion & Spirituality	Could my theroy of the earth be possible?	Several Months ago while visting a friend I noticed an old car from the 1950's next to an old barn. It had literally sank in the ground up to the steering wheel, I later found out it had been there since the late 60's. I got to thinking how everything sinks into the ground after time. The earth seems to be a giant sponge. What if our past (humans) had all sunk in the ground, the pyraminds being one of the last relics from a recent past. We know the center of the earth is very hot, it keeps recyling itself. What if 100's of civilations, 1000's of civilations, millions of civilations existed before us, cities, towns, governments yet all eviedence eventually all sank into the earth without a trace. Man's history is destruction upon itself. Atlantis is one such example of destruction (possible). Could we be just another link in a chain that stretches billions of years.      I would like to hear from anyone who could explain why this isn't possible

Todo mundo sabe quem é Beth Carvalho, figura exponencial do samba e da Mangueira, ao lado se Cartola, Alcione e tantas outras figuras que elevaram a nome da Verde e Rosa aos 4 cantos do mundo, cantando em verso e prosa o que é que a Mangeuira tem, mas em 2007 aconteceu o inusitado, Beth n?o desfilou, arrancada de cima de um carro alegórico, um palco provisório e passageiro, imponente por pouco mais de uma hora, n?o permitiu que a rainha do samba e dos sambista o prestigiasse, uma cena lamentável, uma violencia contra a mulher, o que pude sentir neste episódio do que é capaz um ser humano contra outro. Minha análise n?o foi pelo ato insano de um colaborador desconhecido da Escola, mas pela importancia do fato, a ingratid?o. A história de Beth com seus 36 anos de dedica??o a Verde e Rosa n?o foram suficiente para evitar o incidente. Qual o sentido da GRATID?O, do RESPEITO e dos VALORES HUMANOS?. O pres da Escola ainda afirma que a Mangueira é maior que Beth e n?o vai pedir desculpas.

It fed water into the lake and the tube was half open. There was a girl who jumped into the lake, and I was supposed to follow her. Her brother was there and he was like gothic, he had black on with red outlining and he seemed evil. I jumped in after her. The water was a muddy color but it was normal feeling. It wasn;t warm or cold. I looked underwater and saw her brother slashing at the water trying to hurt me. Anyway someone popped up between us from the water and stopped him. She wore some kind of fish suit that covered her head and had fins on the elbows and head. In the center of the lake was a giant stone structure that had a staircase in the center of it that wound it's way to the top. I don't remember much after that but I remember following the girl from the river, she led me into a forest. I'll have to add the rest in details. Read lower: I'm running out of room.

(Disclaimer/Christian Asking)   I really like some of the questions in here and find some very interesting, there is lot's of very intelligent people from all beliefs & disbeliefs.      My question is this: I have noticed from many posters a postion that say's if you believe in God/Jesus that you are lacking basic understanding of science and logic, world history that you must be on the low end of the IQ scale etc.   That is is completly obvious there is NO God. At least that's seems to be the general consensus to me. With that said is it also your opinion that the Christian leadership, pastors, teachers, biblical scholars many with PHD's (like my pastor) and many that are extremely well educated also agree with you and are simply hiding the real truth from the average, less educated church goer. In other words do you believe that it's so absurd for any reasonably intelligent person to beleive in God that the leadership is knowlingly misleading it own people, or do you believe they believe

20070628071921AAwvzRV	Society & Culture;Other - Society & Culture	Do you think all drugs should be legalized,tell me your opinion?	Prohibition does not prevent cannabis use by children or the mentally ill, the vulnerable populations whom we supposedly want to protect. Instead, cannabis prohibition makes it more difficult for parents, patients, society, doctors and law enforcement to control cannabis use.       The Drug War makes honest education about cannabis impossible, and leaves cannabis users marginalized in ways that make their lives more stressful.    This stress is unhealthy for everyone, but it is certainly most damaging to people with schizophrenia.      Cannabis prohibition is not merely a failure; it is a counterproductive fraud that is harming those whom we claim we want to protect.    There are currently more teens in treatment centers for marijuana in comparison to those admitted for alcohol.   Only an idiot would have to ask why alcohol is not the no#1 problem    after all alcohol is perfectly legal ( If you are 21.)    That is due to responsible people handling alcohol by way of the carding and id system.         Contraband markets make no age disgression.   Since the crackdown on tobacco there are 75% fewer teens trying or using tobacco.   However when it comes to cannabis and other illicit substances it’s a whole   other ball game.   Control, regulation and better education work prohibition, dose not.   Or as John Walters of the ondcp (Office for national drug control policy) calls it “ a war on drugs” (Sorry John but it's true look at the Netherlands)      America loves a war even if it is on it’s own people.      One of several reason they don’t legalize drugs is not because of the harm of drugs,   But people would lose more money in the long run.   Some of the people behind the support of this irrational so called war are   The tobacco industry,    the alcohol and distilled spirit industry ( people simply don’t drink as much, or decide not to drink at all with cannabis meaning a decline in there sales.   The pharmaceutical corporations can not make money on whole or raw cannabis, but they can charge an arm and a leg for there synthetic Marinol (dronabinol) CIII.      The textile and paper industry would lose out from hemp production, sinse hemp dose not need to go through all the various processes that ordinary tree products would. Also it’s possible to get two harvest in one season.      However people don’t know the difference between industrial hemp and smokeable cannabis, yet they are able to distinguish between the two in other country’s like Germany, the UK , Netherlands and even Canada, but our `DEA agents are so dumb they cant tell the difference between a stalk and a bush.    Also people who have any knowledge of growing high quality cannabis will tell you that male plants should never be grown next to your high grade female plants,   (unless of course you want to pollinate for future seed production).   When it comes to farming hemp the males are left in tact to pollinate the females and produce as much seed as possible.      This would mean a seedy mess for the pot smoker to clean up and produce undesirable future generations of smokeable cannabis.      If anything, Hemp farming would be anti marijuana  and would harm any outdoor pot farming within a one mile radius of any hemp farm.      The petroleum industry would also be affected, sinse almost everything that can be made from petroleum can be synthesized from hemp oil, everything from bio fuel to even plastics. If North America would use a third of it’s land for hemp production we could create enough bio fuel to supply an area the size of Canada.      Now also for a moment consider how many people are incarcerated over just cannabis who are currently in the prisons and jails.   If cannabis were legalized and all inmates serving time for cannabis were freed there would be an over abundance of empty cells, and millions of guards in this country would be no longer needed.   The prison building industry would almost be obsolete ( and if all drugs were legalized that would mean even more empty cells).      So the prison system must have some means of gaining more inmates.   Not to mention other areas such as treatment centers, probation.etc    or HIDTA high intensity drug traffic areas where money is fed in to law enforcement,    (they would miss there green $$$)      Drugs , not even alcohol are the cause of the fundamental ills of society, rather than checking people for the presence of drugs, they should first test people for stupidity, ignorance, greed and love of power.

20070806213031AAr7ytp	Society & Culture;Other - Society & Culture	What do you think of his idea?	One day, I chatted a guy from US on the Internet. He told me to plan of traveling in Tokyo.    I live in Tokyo now, so I told him that. Then, he seemed to think he could be a friend of me and asked my adress suddenly.    I felt a bit scarely because it's not common in Japan. If you do like that, Japanese must think you're a kind of dangerous people.    So, I said those things to him cleary and refused to let him know my adress. Then, sunddenly he complained of me too much, for example, " I guess you know our culture as well, why dont you consider it sympathetically?" or something like that.   Finally, I felt annoying and shut him down.     Now, I'm thinking if i was wrong, what i should have done and also if it's a common way in US.    Could you give me some pieces of advice, please?

Nowadays, teenage guys my age(I'm16), tend to spend their time playing at the arcade or dying colored streaks into their hair or wasting their time doing one silly kind of thing or another...   I find myself asking: Where are the days where males concentrate on their fitness or studies or martial arts instead of playing at the arcade all day?..playing once a while is ok to me..but playing almost everyday is just too much..   For me, i believe in hard work and believing in what you do...I believe that hard work can make up for, match, and even truimph over talent...   So what i do everyday is to concentrate on what i do best..playing football(soccer), martial arts and studies...i do play arcade with my friends once in a while...but i dont smoke or drink or dye my hair..   So is there something wrong with me because i dont think like other guys of similar age to me?
20070811101518AAKDcfU	Society & Culture;Other - Society & Culture	Does this make sense to you?	With the industrial revolution, the rise of electronic culture initiated the decline of media epistemology, whereby culture became mass-produced. Media lost its capability of communicating truth and serious matters while society lost its freedom and individuality. As the population became more literate and urbanized, people’s income increased and became more stable. At the same time, productivity increased dramatically and this resulted in the creation of many products of the same type. Therefore, companies needed to differentiate their products from other products in the market so they shifted their focus from producing to advertising. Marketers and advertisers began searching for ways to persuade people so they started making psychological advertisement. From that point, they started using abstraction, equivalence, and reification to convince people to buy their product: They gave meanings and personalities to the products, they made the product seem like it was made especially for the consumer, and they created false realities that linked the products with people’s needs. In today's post-modern world, advertising is omnipresent. Its omnipresence undermines free organic thought with its synthetic, highly calculated messages that dictates values, norms, and ideologies. Advertising is therefore a form of totalitarianism and brainwashing. It’s manipulating people’s behaviors and beliefs and it’s affecting society and culture. How far can advertising go? What impacts does advertising have on society and culture? What are the methods used by advertisers to persuade consumers?

20081027112918AA61wvY	Society & Culture;Religion & Spirituality	Is murdering a fetus, wrong?	Is murdering a fetus the same as murdering a preacher?      Is murdering a fetus the same as murdering an unsuspecting and known  serial killer in his sleep?      Is murdering a fetus the same as murdering a bug?      Does a fetus think, or reflect on his life?      If the fetus were aborted with the guarantee that there would be absolutely no pain, would it be better?  What does it matter anyway if there's pain.  It's still dead.      Does someone have the right to be connected to another person for life support - even if the person objects to it?      Does someone - even an unwanted fetus human have the right to take over a woman's body, when that woman does not want to give away 9 months use of her body, much less, 18 years of babysitting?      Does the baby or even any other adult have the right to use another's body as their house - if that person objects to it?      What if she was raped?      Is abortion OK then - under these circumstances?      If so, then you are a hypocrite.  There are some instances when killing a fetus is OK.        Didi God Himself, not kill innumerable fetuses, women, children, men, etc, over and over in the Old Testament?      Noah's Flood comes to mind....      God's commandment (right after saying Thou Shalt Not Kill) - for the Israelites to murder the Amalekites - Man, Woman, Child, pet... in I Samuel 15:3      And all you can say is, "Thou shalt not kill?"

I would like to have a southern flavor or 'twist' to my meal this year so.....   ...I need some real southern cooks to give me some ideas for dishes I can prepare...and please, no fried turkey...everyone wants my roasted bird, especially since I just got a convection oven (man, the bird last year was so juicy because of convection roasting).      My ex-MIL was from Arkansas so my turkey day always has real southern cornbread( even after the  ex became an ex lol).....got that covered and the sweet tea Hubby loves, & the buttermilk biscuits they all rave about (no body here eats pecan pie, even the hubby so nix on that one)..I need some ideas on traditional turkey day side dishes southen style.....and if anyone wants to drop a fav recipe..please do so......and thanks to all who answer, my Georgia peach will greatly appreciate it! lol.

20080929020033AAgunUB	Society & Culture;Etiquette	When is it appropriate to kiss a woman's hand?	In a social context (not a business one), would one (business partners, etc) find it inappropriate if you were to kiss their significant others' hand when meeting?  I know in many parts it is not considering sexual or an indicator of interest necessarily, but is it too "romantic" of a move to do when meeting friends' girlfriends/wives in a social setting?

I'm 19 turning 20 and is a 3rd year Engineering Student and currently in a relationship with a newly graduate Accountant. Hes 24. I had my first Engineering internship in his city and stayed over at his place for the last 5 months. I'm back in my home town which is about a 1.5 hour flight away. We love each other very much, but I am scared we might fall apart... I will be in my city for another 7 months and assuming I can find another internship in his city (hopefully), I wont get to see him. We text and webcam with each other everyday. Hes still in the closet and his family doesn't know, only a few of his friends know. We plan to move in together after I graduate, either I move to his city or he moves to mine (Thats in 2.5 years though). We've known each other for almost 9 months now, but 2.5 years seem like a long time. With him being still in the closet and we not knowing when we can see each other given our different schedules, I don't know where this relationship will go in the future or whether it will last. I love him very much and don't want to let him go. He's made it clear that he won't see anyone else either, but 2.5 years is a long time... It pains me to not be with him. What can I/we do to make this relationship work? I would like to hear your personal stories if you went through something similar. Thanks!!
20081010191251AACje2i	Society & Culture;Cultures & Groups;Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual, and Transgendered	Best friend (15) is in love with me.?	My best friend Kat (who's 15 years old, as am I) came from a very religious upbringing. She was taught to be disgusted by any gay person, and to stay far, far away from homosexuality. I was raised in the complete opposite environment, and my entire family is completely open to all orientations. I'm actually bi, but I've never admitted it to Kat (or my parents, but that's another story...)      Well, earlier today during school I caught Kat crying in the girls bathroom. When I asked her what was wrong, she said that she was in love with another girl and was afraid of eternal damnation. I am not the best at consoling, so, in shock, I hugged her and asked who she was in love with. She wouldn't answer, just kept blubbering that she was going to hell. Finally, I got her somewhat alright, and she said that she was in love with me. WOW. I just stood there with my mouth open. I never got a chance to respond because the principal walked in then and told us we were both tardy to class. Still in shock, I rushed off and didn't see her for the rest of the day. My family's going over to her place for dinner tomorrow, and I have no idea what to say! I'm actually secretly dating a (female) junior in my high school, and I don't really want to have a relationship with Kat, but I'm afraid that if I don't help her somehow understand that she's not "evil", she'll never accept herself. How can I help her? Thank you for any answers!

20081014001605AAalvrZ	Society & Culture;Religion & Spirituality	If your God created the Earth just right and perfect, then why were there devastating Ice Ages in the past?	Some of you Christians may argue that your God placed the Earth in the perfect spot in the solar system, and tilted the Earth just right so that we may have seasons that are believed to be unique just to our little planet.      Well, not only were there devastating Ice Ages, but also large scale changes that brought change to early life ecosystems.      Plate tectonics would cause continental drift altering oceanic currents that brought disasters such as monsoons to Southeast Asia and altering Africa's climate to become dry.      Milankovitch cycles are fluctuations in the Earth’s orbit around the sun resulting in 100,000-year ice age cycles of the Quaternary glaciation over the last few million years.       This is caused by:   Orbital eccentricity, which are changes from a circular to an elliptical orbit.      Orbital obliquity, which is when the tilt of Earth’s axis varies between 22 degrees and 25 degrees. This occurs every 41,000 years.      Orbital precession which include,    Axial precession, which is when the Earth’s axis wobbles causing the North Pole to shift every 26,000 years   Elliptical Precession, which causes equinoxes and solstices to shift around Earth’s orbit      The years 1645-1715 experienced the Maunder Minimum. This is a period of greatly reduced sunspot activity, which is part of an 11 year cycle. This corresponded to the coldest part of the “little ice age”      During the 10th-14th century, this was considered the Medieval Warm Period. During this time the northern hemisphere experienced considerably warmer temperatures. During the 1315-mid 19th century, the Little Ice Age occurred, and this time consisted of bitterly cold winters and glacial advances. During 1815-1816, this was the “Year without a summer”. This is the result of a volcanic winter caused by the eruption of Mount Tambora. This resulted in famine, starvation and death.

Developing nations such as India and China have begun to open up foreign investment and invite powerful companies, most of which happen to be American, invest in their cultural and economical landscape. Youth in many countries have started to adopt an Americanized view of the world. They generally aren't against such 'imperialism', but the older people are. This is also true in 'Americanized' nations like Britain, where some people resent the Americanization of their country.      Questions: why are some people against Americanization of the world?

Christians or any other practiced religion-- How would you defend yourself to an atheist?       Atheists-- Most Atheists believe in the deterministic philosophy that everything has a cause--one of the main theories of existence is evolution--I understand that evolution has it's points--but it is not ENTIRELY proven how evolution occurred--there are many theories--and I personally believe that not everything has a cause--for instance, in quantum physics when you get a radioactive result, an element must decay but what causes atoms to decay in different time periods is not proven. There is no cause to be known as to why one atom decays earlier than another one.--AND in finding a cause like most scientists try to do, isn't that some sort of faith? that something caused another thing to happen?--Maybe there is no cause as to how God was created, but it is faith that keeps us pondering and believing that God was and is-- please don't take this the wrong way, I am a Christian, but I am just trying to bring up some points to be discussed here-- I would like to know more about the atheist beliefs--Also, I posted a comment last night about the same topic--I would appreciate it if people didnt leave emotionally based comments and get to their point of their view--Remember, the Bible is written in parables, not in objectives--And Atheists have their beliefs that are rather logical and interesting--Please remember to respect other's beliefs

20090223121615AA0F8qW	Society & Culture;Religion & Spirituality	Did God send the Devil to tempt Eve?	In the story of JOB the devil was at the right hand of God in Heaven.  He questioned Job's faith and was sent to test him.      If Adam and Eve were the first man and woman, the the story of Job happened AFTER Adam and Eve.  Which means the Devil was at the right hand of God when earth was formed and Adam and Eve ate from the tree of Knowledge.

20090223121804AAo2kv7	Society & Culture;Religion & Spirituality	Christians:  What do you think of these quotes?

"The nearer a person approaches the Lord, a greater power will be manifested by the Adversary to prevent the accomplishment of the Lord's purposes."      "Love is one of the chief characteristics of Deity; a man filled with the love of God is not content with blessing his family alone, but ranges through the whole world, anxious to bless the whole human race."       "If men do not comprehend the character of God, they do not comprehend themselves."      "Faith and fear can not be in the same man at the same time."      "The best way to obtain truth and wisdom is not to ask from books, but to go to God in prayer, and obtain divine teaching."         All of these quotes are quotes from the same person.

20090223123434AA1oxe5	Society & Culture;Religion & Spirituality	Dude, I don't know if I can handle this lint thing?	Well to start with I am a surfer from California. So like the other day I was talking to one of my bros and he was like so what are you doing for lint? I was like confused and I said nothing. He said you are not giviong anything up for lint? I was all no why should I. He goes well thats what Christians are supposed to do, you are a Christian right. I was like of course. So when I went home I opened my dryer up and took out the lint. I made a little altar and I lit candles all around it. I knelt before it and chanted lint... lint ...lint all night. Then I got up in the morning and my mom was going to lint brush my work pants but I was like hands off lady you have to respect lint. So like I have been doing this for like 3 days and I have not cleaned the lint from my belly button. This is a problem because I surf and there is like a huge ball of wax and lint in there. I also noticed that when I wear my wool pajamas I get lint on my choad. Why does God want us to give it up for lint? Are we going to have to give it up for dog hair and dust next? Do all the people that are throwing the lint away from their dryer going to hell?
