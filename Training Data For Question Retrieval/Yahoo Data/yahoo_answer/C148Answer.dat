You can just go down to one of your local labs where you usually get blood tests done & they will do it.  You usually don't have to have an appt or anything & it only costs around $25-$30.  And if you go in the morning you will more than likely get the results later that same day.  That's definitely the best thing to do.  You definitely wanna find out soon that way you can start getting prenatal care especially since you might already be 3 or 4 months.|`|e0eb82b689e1db392eb51c89982ed115aa	I think you asked this already and you got the very best answers there. Its most likely a cyst or disorder. I dont think your pregnant, I think you WANT to be pregnant and the only way to really find out is go to a doctor and NOW. IF its cysts or infection its best caught early.|`|zJv8LA5Yaa	I would also suggest a blood test at the doc's.

aKffuMZ3aa	My son is 15 months old and has severe Eczema. His started around 3 months old...and it started on his cheeks also. Sounded exactly like what you stating. I went to my family doctor and begged for anything that would help him. He gave me Aquafur also, and some other OTC creams. They did nothing. If anything..it just got worse in a month. When Austin was 4 months old I took him over to a friends house so she could meet him. Shockingly, her son also had Eczema just as bad as my son. He was 4 at the time and still had it bad. She pulled out the creams taht her doctor gave her when he son was a newborn. She put a little on my sons cheek and within an hour it was clear! I couldnt beleive it! My son had been suffering for months because my doctor didnt understand how Severe his syptoms were. I called the doctor and demanding those exact creams and he prescribed them on the spot. Since then, i have had very little problems with the exzema. My doctor also told us our son would grow out of it by a year old...And by 12 months are son was worse, not better at all. So if you hear that, dont get your hopes up :(  Here are the names of the creams..one is for face and other is for body. Also I see someone suggested hydrocortizone...I wanted to let you know I tried that with my son also..it worked a bit but the other creams worked much better for me.    Body- fluocinonide  Face-Desonide    I really hope this helps you as it helped us. Please if you have any questions email me at Paac26@yahoo.com    My name is Amanda :D|`|Qfq4lpe7aa	continue the Vaseline it keeps a protective covering for the face the aveeno baby washes are really good I get the one with oatmeal in it...It has the dark blue top on it and the lotion is really creamy I also have a prescription for him that the dr gave it is an ointment that really works well with the breakouts...only it can't be used near the eyes which is where my son is breaking out right now...go figure...just keep him really moisturized    oh yeah and my ped told me not to use anything with scents or dyes in it so no fabric softner or anything on anything of his and the scent free dye free detergent dreft is really expensive so I got the scent and dye free ALL it works just as good and lasts longer too! :)|`|Ojgqd4xNaa	My daughter doesn't, but my niece does, and her mother swears by Aveeno Baby Lotion, and bathe products.  My little girl does have the dry chapped cheeks from drooling, and I use the Mustela Facial lotion, and it has a very nice consistency, and isn't oily, they have a ton of products for different things, that all seem really nice.  I'm not sure about the cost of Aveeno, but the Mustela is a little pricey, but I find it worth it!|`|g7gvzhkpaa	http://www.askbaby.com/baby-eczema.htm|`|6zVISNTZaa	My little brother was like this when he was born, and still has bad eczema now, when he was a baby he had to have a cold tar bath, not sure if this is still on now, but mostly is told to apply E45.    Just keep him in cotton, don't let him get too hot and sweaty as this will make him worse, and make sure he wears mittens so he can't scratch at it.    Also, go to the doctor to see what he can prescribed that is sensitive enough to use on a little 'un's face. (:|`|toOzi7aLaa	My son had eczema very bad!     The best thing that worked for us was actually Aveeno baby. Both me and my baby are allergic to all dove products.

My son is 5 months old and has eczema terribly since 2 months.  finally we got in to see a derm dr and she prescribed 2 creams one for body and one for face (hydrocortizone 2.5%) and cleared up great.  try using a cortizone cream mixed with vasoline  more vasoline than the cortaid cream.  then use aveeno moisturizing for eczema  bath everyday a quick 5 minute luke warm. bath with the aveeno bath - hypoallergetic eczema and his ped. dr changed his formula from soy to nutramigen enfamail.  also use free n clear all to wash his clothes in- use 100% cotton outfits. we have used the aquaphor and the derm dr said it is just a fancy vasoline.  it helped a little but not too much.  our guy had a little bit of a rough start, he came home from the hospital @ 2 months w/ leathery feeling skin.  SO I was absolutly estatic that his skin was finally baby butt smooth and soft!!!!!!    Good Luck!!!

I developed an UTI (infection)  My twins were born 16 weeks early.  <br>  <br>  Please don't let this go. <br>  <br>  Stay off your feet and be persistent till you talk to the doctor! <br>  <br>  God Bless|`|QCUPeW8aaa	Its almost impossible to completely determine the sex of a baby at 14 weeks.<br>  All babys look the same until there genitals fully evolve and a baby boys penis may not be fully developed until week 18.<br>  So if your told its a girl any time earlier than don't count on it 100%.<br>  Good luck|`|6L9jJnchaa	I found out at 14 weeks, and 5 days.<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bfiz4L3hnnU" rel="nofollow">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bfiz4L3hn...</a>|`|McQanl5Aaa	The baby's genitals start to form early on, but even with 3D/4D ultrasound its very difficult to tell that early. The time when its easiest to determine the sex of the baby is around 20 weeks...any further along and the baby starts filling up too much of the uterus to get a really good clear view, and any time before 20 weeks, its hard to tell because they aren't developed enough yet. I'd say you'll need to wait til between 19-21 weeks to get a definitive answer-and even then you'll only find out if the baby decides to cooperate and spread its legs LOL|`|YuqTcSSDaa	I think it is really hard to tell that early. Anything can look like something. Spotting is never good. I was rest and keep my feet up!|`|SlAcbL7Xaa	no i had to wait until my 20 week ultrasound to find out the sex|`|AA11764194	Tech must be right.. I came to know I am having boys during my 13th week ultra sound and my tech was right.. <br>  <br>  so good luck|`|bmrQQOJjaa	I had an ultrasound yesterday at 18 weeks and my baby was shy and had its legs together. Just want to make sure you know you might not be able to tell even at 16 week. No one really told me that, so I was really upset. So now I have to wait till my next appointment at 21 weeks.
0F9b6g5vaa	when i went to the hospital for my induction at 39 wks due to size of bub when dr went to break waters i was already a good 4cm and didnt know had no pains of pressure or any indications to say i had begun dialating not even a show|`|uCnmYEPBaa	My sister was 5 cm dilated when she went into her 38 week appt and didn't know it. But she wasn't having contractions that she could feel. She stayed that way for 2 weeks before she went into actual labor.|`|vKEYa8aeaa	all the way. my mom knows a woman who had a baby a few years ago [her first by the way] and at her appointment she wasnt dialated at all, a week later [the day before her next appointment] she went to the hospital because she was in labor, she was already 9...yes NINE CM dialated...her water had just broke right when she left to go to the hospital and she said her contractions didnt even hurt that bad.<br>  <br>  im so scared of that.|`|HEdGGmkhaa	With both of my children I had to have my waters broken, I was 4 cm when I had my midwife check me with #1 and she said I was so calm I could have had the baby at home....only because it was my first I had to go in :o( Lucky I did cuz I needed a c-section after almost 36 hours labor!<br>  My feelings were different with both, the first obviously I didn't really know what was going on and thought it wasn't time, I was a week early....the second I was in Target! had some pressure, twinges and I felt like I wanted to do some weird ballet moves in the line lol  <br>  Both times when I was put on the monitors, the nurses were like...are you feeling anything?  I didn't have a lot of pain until I was close...<br>  <br>  Hope that helped|`|J3yUXKiyaa	I was 3-4 when I was checked a week past due with #3.  My OB gave me a good, aggressive membrane sweep and said after that I was a solid 4.  She said she had no idea why I wasn't in labour yet.<br>  <br>  You can dilate without having full on labour contractions.  I felt pinching at the cervix.  When I went into labour, I sure knew it.<br>  <br>  Some women's cervix's don't budge until real labour pains start, others (like me), just start dilating, and labour comes later.  <br>  <br>  The only time I've ever spontaneously burst my water is either during or just before pushing, full on 10 cm.  The first pregnancy, they broke it after I stalled out at 8 cm.|`|rZLctXwdaa	I'm not sure how much I was dilated before going to the hospital, but I started having contractions, and by the time I actually got to the hospital, I was dilated to 7-8. My water never broke. My son was born, and they had to break it off of his face.|`|cO9sxO9raa	My friend was 6 cm dilated when she came to the hospital and she had no contractions ever! The doctors had to induce her though because she was overdue by a few days, and they broke her water on the spot.

My little sisters name is actually Esme and people always laughed at her for some reason. I like Kyla or Kayle but not Kylee. What about the names Eliza, Scarlett, Jennifer, Maria, Mary, Noel (as a first name), or Audrey? If you want Noel as a middle name Magnolia Noel is pretty.<br>  <br>  For boys, I like John Paul and Caden.

mfBkH3qtaa	Be care free. I am. And it is AMAZING. The only time I'm not is when i have a big test coming up or it is 2 weeks before report cards come out. Other than that I am pretty stress-free. I will always be paranoid though but I have learned to deal with it.|`|w2kofruFaa	I wish it were that easy, but then again, doesn't everyone?.. Actually, though, I've been more chilled lately, and things have been working better for me, besides all the naturally horrible things that have happened this month (deaths, breakup(s), illnesses.. you name it.)<br>  <br>  I can tell you this. It has been proved that people who laugh more live longer, or something like that, and the best way to laugh is to have fun. Who can say no to that, especially as a teenager! :DD|`|oMAyaFZAaa	I'm practicing on that... But I keep finding myself, worrying about my appearance and what other thinks. But then I read something... Most people around you probably don't notice the flaws you see because they are too busy worrying about their own.|`|W6o3UQLkaa	Just chill, kick back and listen to some music of the great Robert Nesta Marely(bob marley)|`|9ntoGPFyaa	yeah, just quit being paranoid. cut loose, it will relieve the stress.|`|EZyHOht7aa	It's not as easy as that. Stress and paranoia are complex reactions of the body and mind, you can only override them with experience and strong coping skills.
xKSr1ld8aa	You've been given good advice so to add my two pennies worth keep up contact.  Gradually tell her in emails how you're feeling so she doesn't feel overloaded.<br>  <br>  From the point of view it took me a long time to open up to my son and I know he got frustrated which wasn't helped by the fact that I'm not much of a talker anyway.<br>  <br>  Fear works both ways and that can cause problems when two people want to get to know each other but are two scared to be honest.  My son and I are very close now but it took us over 4 years to get to this point.<br>  <br>  Actually marriage is something my son and I have talked about as he told me he would want me to be there if he got married.  For a long time I said no because he didn't want his aparents to know we were reunited so I told him I would feel uncomfortable if they didn't know the truth.  They do know now so it's no longer an issue.<br>  <br>  At the end of the day follow your heart :)|`|949517353a847c7e512b934758a0b451aa	seems like you have alot to say did you ever talk to her about this? you need to bring it up of course its going to hurt but thats life|`|AA12246540	Tell her the way you feel.|`|L9JfmPkiaa	if that's the way you feel, you can just tell her.<br>  and if you're pouring your heart out to her, then it's showing her that you trust her.<br>  also, have you ever thought of visiting her???<br>  if you try to talk to her in person and put effort into your relationship, then it'll be easier to get to know her.<br>  and of course you should invite her to your wedding, it's your mom!<br>  if she thinks it's too weird and doesn't want to go, then she won't.<br>  it's the thought that counts.|`|zVZgYEjMaa	It's normal.<br>  <br>  And really hard.  <br>  <br>  You may find some support here:<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.adultadoptees.org/forum/index.php" rel="nofollow">http://www.adultadoptees.org/forum/index...</a><br>  <br>  Lots of good people, many of them have gone through some of the same things...|`|4XObY5fPaa	I grew up ot knowing my mother also. i was raised by my grandparents.

You said you found her, Yea for you.  But...did SHE want to be found.  <br>  <br>  Give her some space.  Next time you need to talk to her write down your feelings in a Journal.  It helps you to get your emotions in check and your feelings out.  When you have asked her in your journal  all of the things you need to know, then and only then contact her.<br>  <br>  Give her some time to come to grips with the fact that you are a real person and not the ghost she gave to someone else to raise.  <br>  <br>  Give her time to miss the REAL you.|`|cd98c09cc34c3c84ad4502d636e2d2beaa	If you ran out of things to say on the phone, maybe it is time you met in person.  Long-distance relationships don't work. In fact, they are barely relationships at all.  <br>  <br>  She is likely afraid you will disappear out of her life as well. Fear of rejection goes both directions.<br>  <br>  Why not try to arrange a time and place to meet?  Even if it takes a plane trip?
LKUjbuCuaa	You get all the help you can from relatives, family friends, and any else who will be supportive.  Also, look for bereavement support over time - grief takes a long time  Do the 13 year old and the 9 year old receive professional help? - ask their doctor for a referral to a grief councilor or other suitable professional.  Also, ask their principals for help - the school may have professional who deal with grief.  (If you are religious, see your clergy-person - but don't be pressured to do so if you are not.   And look after yourself, especially as you are now functioning as a parent yourself.  I hope your parents will pull through, and I am sorry for your loss if they don't - 20 is way too young to lose your parents.|`|cLS3Jhz7aa	i'm so sympathy to u...btw,tell them that ur parent've go to very far place to take a exam...they won't come back but we're gonna go to them someday(which means when we were die sumdays)..just keep praying 4 ur parent to past the exam..i'm sorry maybe this is a bad idea but this is only the way to calm myself when i'm thinking about my mum...my mom has past away last year when i were 14,i'm really closed with her.....i'm sorry again about your parent..|`|2M2XRRABaa	Go ahead and tell the 13-year old sister. She will definitely understand, but you have to be calm about it. As for the younger ones, you will have to tell them in a way that hints it out, but don't be direct. Once they are mature enough to understand, then you can tell them.<br>  <br>  Good luck with the situation, and I hope the best for you!|`|MHeOHOnbaa	you sit them down and try to be very calm and tell them that jesus wanted them to come and live with him but that he has left them in really good hands|`|24qsYeGaaa	Have you ever seen the movie Gracie's Choice?

U dont hv choice then tell them.|`|uYw8XT1Caa	You can go right out and tell the 13 year old. She will probably understand. Yu must be more careful with the 9 year old. Try not to get their hopes up too high that they are coming back, because it will be even worse if they don't. As for the 9 year old, try to get them a bowl of ice cream, or something like that, and ask how school was, and then tell them. As for the little one, do the same, but he won't understand. Just don't answer their questions right away.<br>  Praying for you!
2451MT2Haa	No absolutely not. If you dont like your answers then why ask the question? I was a child dealing with child services, and i stand by them. Yes there are some mean social workers, but its not the easiest job either. Adoption can be a blessing to children and to families. Its a harsh reality but it is reality.|`|kBp9IzQqaa	How original.<br>  <br>  *rolls eyes*|`|xBd96wvRaa	I posted all your other questions for a bit as part of a response to a question you asked about adoption - not this one. <br>  <br>  I took it down becuase I feel you may be asking for real help. <br>  <br>  So what is your real question? Are you adopted? Do you think your parents stole you from your real mother? <br>  <br>  Do realize trolling throws lot of negative energy your way.|`|Ag0jb7Neaa	no i don't think that at all<br>  now i see your string of questions, there is a pattern here for sure<br>  <br>  i think the system is a nightmare and can fail many people BUT it's all we have and we need to make the best of it|`|2wyDALHgaa	Nope.

ANHsv4ENaa	YES! I can't stand that. I have seen too many parents who use it as a cop out so they don't have to comfort their kids. Put them in the crib with a pacifier and leave them because if they have that they won't cry. Never mind that what a baby cries for is human interaction and love, NOT just a plastic thing to be shoved in their mouth. And having it all day just because is bizarre. I know one baby who's parents constantly did that and the poor kid didn't even try to talk until he was about 3 because he always had it in his mouth.|`|lkhCeAdJaa	YES!!  I am also bothered by children having it in their mouths all day for no reason.  For what reason does a happy child need a pacifier?  A *fussy* BABY, I understand, but a happy contented child?.....I don't get it.|`|prqrQcd1aa	Yes.. my thing is when parents still give the thing to the kid when they are like 3 years old, and you can see that their teeth are growing in around it!|`|R47Bj9Q6aa	my parents never once gave me or my 3 sisters one<br>  they just didnt like them<br>  and they survived and eventually got us all to sleep|`|EtTddxAqaa	Yes this is frusterating to me and especially when the kids didn't really do anything to deserve a dummy, they are not crying and they are not asking for it so why give it to them. I do have an issue with the dummy though because all 3 of my kids have it. they are twin 2 year olds and a 10 month old. they all have them because they are all younger, It bothers me sometimes when my mother-in-law asks when the kids will need the pacifiers? I am like well I give it to them when they ask for it or else at bed time, she was like "well you don't give it to them during the day to get them to stop talking i am kidding" but it hurts because, NO I don't stick a pacifier in my childrens mouths to keep them from talking. If my boys want it then i ask them why and if they are upset i give it to them. I obviously give it to them before bed...while they are in the cribs! I also give it to my daughter but I do not think it is all the childrens fault because I am mearly upset with the parents for not setting boundaries for the children and the use of this pacifier! <br>  I am sorry this is so long, I really like to talk! (:<br>  I hope I helped you! <br>  `carrie~|`|UMRdHuuVaa	I wonder if you would actually say this to someone if you saw them doing this?<br>  I would think we should mind our own business unless it directly affects us.<br>  <br>  I used a dummy - but only if he needed it, i saw people looking at me like i was a bad mother, the fact is i am not.<br>  When i did all i could do console my child, he was comforted by his dummy - and NO it has not ruined his teeth because the one i bought was made by orthdonists especially for infants.<br>  But my son is 7 months old and stopped using his dummy at 2 months.<br>  Like i said, maybe you should worry about your own children and business instead of being a nosey parker.|`|DhmUgq0maa	I understand what your saying, all 3 of my kids have had a dummy but i only gave it to them as a last resort if they were cranky at bedtime an i couldn't settle them no matter what i do, It's bad to let them suck on a dummy all day an night as they will get used to having the it 24/7 an become dependent on it plus the longer they use a dummy the harder it becomes to take it off them!|`|sagjCRvKaa	Oh, sometimes, Personally I do not believe in them. I feel it is just one more thing you have to break them of, and I do not think it is good for the formation of teeth. It is natural for kids to suck on their fingers, I have never had a baby grow up and be a thumb sucker because I let them suck on their fingers.|`|qTVkydt1aa	I do think it's kind of annoying, especially when they're around a group of people and will give their child one just to shut them up.<br>  <br>  Though I must admit, I had one every night when I slept until my fifth birthday.  I was old. <br>  But one thing my parents always did was never allow me to have it during the day once I turned four.  They would put it on a really high shelf so I couldn't get to it, because I became dependent on that thing.<br>  <br>  I wish they didn't let me have that thing for so long...and even now I'm always biting and chewing things (everything), which I honestly think is a result of that.|`|SrcoG7JRaa	It's not my place to care what other parents do with their babies, so long as it isn't harmful or abusive.<br>  Mind your own business. Everyone has different things that work with their babies and their family. Just live and let live.<br>  <br>  I don't know much specifically about pacifiers. We've tried them with my daughter, and she doesn't like them, spits them back out.  So it's not really an issue.|`|1jwbQaZTaa	yes i agree! babies need to learn to self-soothe, and sometimes, its not even the paci that they need! maybe they are hungry, thirsty, etc. i mean when my daughter was newborn, she loved her paci and she weaned herself from it at 6 months. but i have a friend whose daugther is 18 months and she still gives her a pacifier!! i think its a disgrace! a child almost 2 does NOT need a pacifier anymore...|`|VuUz8NgKaa	Not really, because it is none of my business.<br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  Compassion~ I am in a crabby mood considering I let my mom and dad take my daughter out tonight and they aren't back yet, and besides it really is not my business what people give there kids even if I don't agree with it.|`|eya1WDS4aa	YEAP! My son had one he got every now and then but by the time he was 3 months old he was done with it. What i hate more then people giving pacifiers is people giving pacifers after the age of one! maybe its just me, but if they have their teeth then they dont need a paci.<br>  <br>  <br>  Ashley- god whats your problem tongiht...bad mood. you always have good answers not crabby answers. Cheer up :)<br>  Awe im sorry about them not getting home with your daughter yet!! if thats her in your pic she is adorable!|`|oIyXMnmcaa	Yeah I hear ya...I used them for the first 3 months and then stopped once they were sleeping through the night. I did not want them getting attached to the dummy so I got rid of it early. I also used it because studies show that a pacifier helps in reducing the risks the SIDS in infants 1 month to 4 months. <br>  I got a rocking chair and thats how I soothed them from 3 months and on with both children...they loved to rock and listen to me sing. :)<br>  <br>  ---What bugs me the most (personal opinion here guys) is the parents that let their children suck on those dummies at the age of 3 and 4. I know some little ones in the family that still suck on it and they are 3 and a half years old. Now that is ridiculous...but I would never say that to their parents...cause its not my place. I think it is bad for their teeth though and their social developement. Children should only need the pacifier till the age of 1 and then that comfort needing should be starting to fade and they can be weened off the bottle and the dummy.|`|a37f465fb3af30fb69356b87ea42c178aa	Nope don't agree with you at all. I'm all for a dummy... I can think of many other things which fustrate me... a dummy is hardly a big issue. Also my daughter gets comfort from it which makes her a happy baby.<br>  <br>  /waits for a thumbs down response :p|`|KUxEBQuYaa	its a play thing for my son. he ignores his other toys and plays with his passie. <br>  ive tried to keep it from him, but he cries until he gets it. then he just passes it between his hands and plays. its cute.

02afccc3abbd7877c182c4b1daa8d2a9aa	Sounds like your little guy has a yeast infection and that's what the doc needs to see.  In the meantime you may want to give him yogurt to help fight whats going on and give him bath's with baking soda to help dry this up.  <br>  I wouldn't say it's his formula or diapers as this is something you've been using since day one (if he's still drinking formula).  I would look at his juice and dilute it some if you haven't already and food.  Look at the whole picture and maybe eliminate some things and re-introduce one at a time just like you did when he was an infant.  If that doesn't work then go back to the doc and state it's a yeast infection.  Try powder that has cornstarch in it if you don't.|`|c271e0d140cbe1902cabe87b6f0e3485aa	Ointment with Zinc in it is good for diaper rash.<br>  <br>  Go back to your doctor and tell him that what he prescribed isn't working, or talk to the pharmacist and see if they know of anything that works well.<br>  <br>  At 17 months I would let him spend time without his diaper on if you can - fresh air is the best thing for sore bottoms.<br>  <br>  Do you have any cloth diapers?  It could be something in the disposable diapers that is causing the rash.<br>  <br>  Good Luck!|`|w7FSmSTnaa	is sounds like a yeast infection and needs to be treated with meds from the dr. If your current dr isnt treating it i would take him to another dr because this can get very bad, spread and become very painful for him. My daughter had it and i would give her an oatmeal bath made by aveno and let her soak for about 12-20mins.  this will help dry out the infected area|`|ME62Mtv4aa	Give him a warm bath with baking soda in it and let his bottom soak for a bit that really helps it go away fast a nurse advised me to do that and it helped drastically|`|1SGl03Zlaa	Try cornstarch.  I use it at every diaper change not just when there is a rash and it helps prevent one from starting.  If you are putting creams on it you should put a little bit of cornstarch on it first to keep it dry otherwise the cream will just lock the moisture in making it worse.|`|YuqTcSSDaa	It could be something else or it could be an allergy. What does he drink? Milk or juice? Try a different brand of diapers and wipes. My first son was allergic to scented wipes. Also, when my kids have a rash, I never use ointment, I use baby powder because it does so much better.|`|Pjqx3sIZaa	i used aveeno diaper rash cream for my daughter. the rash seems to fade away alot the next day. my daughter had a rash like your sons also, and aveeno really helped.  hoped that helped.|`|bQTATDTyaa	Sounds like yeast, you can buy an antifungal OTC, like Lotrimin for athlete's foot.<br>  <br>  You should not use powder on broken skin.|`|AA10188961	Yeast infection.

qU8HqQsOaa	Well that is true if you do leave him there then it would work. When I was little my mom used 2 do the same and I was fine after she left. So it should work. <br>  Good Luck!|`|T1q4GWLkaa	The truth is, no matter which way you do it, with your son so attached to you, he will probably be upset when you leave.  A few days or weeks of leaving and then coming back later in the day will let him trust that he can have fun and mommy will definitely be back for him later.  The only other thing I might try is to play byebye games with him at home.  "OK, mommy's going byebye now.  Can you hang out with Daddy/Auntie/Etc.?  I'll be right back."  Then wait a short while and come back.  "Look, Mommy's back to get you."|`|xJW1RSaAaa	I personally think that what the director suggested would be really insensitive.  To leave your child for a whole day without him being bonded to the carer is not right.  I used childcare for my son but I made sure that there was always one person on duty that he had bonded to, and that all the carers acted in an empathetic caring way to my child.<br>  <br>  He got used to the nursery because they gave me as many free visits with him as we both needed for him to get used to nursery, after he was comfortable, I then did an hour, then 2 hours, then 4 hours until he got used to me leaving him.<br>  <br>  It is natural for children to be attached to their mother. The detachment occurs naturally as a child gets older, I don't know why people want to force the detacthment form an early age in order to avoid their child needing them and being "clingy".<br>  <br>  I understand that you need to work - I did - if I hadn't worked we couldn't pay our mortgage. But do it sensitively.  If the carer at my son's nursery said to do that I wouldn't have used them because they wouldn't be empathetic or understanding of my son's needs.<br>  <br>  So to answer your questions - yes, it is much better to ease them into daycare.<br>  <br>  No it is not normal for him to cry all day - would you like to cry all day? <br>  <br>  Some advice - read a book by Margot Sunderland called The Science of Parenting. It really helps you understand better what I am trying to say!|`|YuqTcSSDaa	The longer you stay- the harder it is. If you do not let go now, he will have a harder time later and that can lead to problems in Pre K and then he can start acting out. It is better to "let go" now. It is best for both of you. You will feel better soon.|`|949517353a847c7e512b934758a0b451aa	yes its true and my son was alittle older than yours i stayed for awhile but and i left him crying bcuz they are going to cry there is no stopping it but its good for them my son is still in the same daycare and he LOVES it its good for them to be around other kids they learn so much more! and my son started talkin about 2 months later! i also put my son in the daycare that my friend takes her son and when i would go to pick him up i would take my son along to but that didnt help! it took him about 3 weeks to get use to it but its ok cuz it teaches them that no matter what you are gonna come bac <br>  <br>  <br>  *EDIT* dont listen to "have respect" maybe that was good for her and her child but it doesnt work for everyone you should do whats best for YOU but leaving your son in daycare doesnt make you a bad mother and of course a child is going to cry they are not use to it but they will and sometimes the longer you stay the harder it is for them to adjust without you. so "have respect" i did say with my son for a little while and left him and he is fine and he loves his class and his school and im a damn good mother! Your way doesn't work for everybody!|`|cWP73qEsaa	ughh these are the hardest times i feel you! but u did it good because if u stay longer or if he sees u he will latch onto your leg and wont let go and then u wont leave, u will end up taking him home and thats not good either it will be like this for the first 2 weeks or so my daughter was like this. its normal because he is just used to seeing u but then u will see that after a while he will be very happy to go and stay and probably even wave u away ( i cried every day until she stayed calm which was almost a week after) now if u see that after a a few weeks he is still scared or if he scared of his teacher then stick around cuz u never know but if ur friend hasnt had any bad experiences than take it easy for a bit. hope i helped even though u hurt inside when u leave its for the better just think of if as he is growing up and its good for him to be around other lil kids|`|FhlmiI7daa	I worked at a daycare and had experience with kids who were new to daycare and I think what you did was the right thing. Since it was the first day he may not have felt confident in what was happening and didn't know that you would pick him up at the end of the day.  He will start to pick up on the routine after a few days.   The only thing I might do differently would be telling "I have to go to work now but I will be back at the end of the day" and then tell him goodbye and leave. So that you let him acknowledge the fact that you are leaving but will be back.|`|kM8dCoYqaa	Some kids are just really attatched and it's hard for the first week or two.  I find what works is taking the child to the day care a few times before it actually starts and letting him or her explore and play for an hour or so.  That way they get used to the place and feel a bit more comfortable.  Since you have started you should probably just keep doing what you are doing.  Drop him off, say good bye and let him know you will be there to pick him up at the end of the day. Don't sneak out, wave and give him a kiss and say good bye. At this point it doesn't matter how long you hang out, he knows you will leave and he will be sad. It might take a week or two but he will get used to it.|`|km6rtHPpaa	I know how hard and heat breaking is to live your child for the first, second or then thousand times, and watch him looking at you with those sad eyes, or even crying. But eventually he and you as well will get used to the facts that this is your guys’ daily routine and every thing will seem fine. But As a mother I know no matter how many times you say good-bye to go to work-- it is still going to heart inside.<br>  But lets talk facts >> the teacher’s or director’s advice was actually the most reasonable one. That is the only way to teach and learn to let it go... will take few days, weeks, with some people even month or two. But eventually the heartbreaking crying will stay in the past. You just need time. But you know if you could afford it >> you should > actually all moms should stay home with their babies for four to five years.. I think..

rx0ekB9Paa	try putting a pillow between ur legs, for the most part you just have to deal with the pain. i cannot sleep for more than 20-30 mintes at a time cuz i wake up in pain and have to switch positions.|`|HM0cxcahaa	Welcome to the third trimester nightmare<br>  Im 38 weeks into my second pregnancy and have been this way for weeks, the most sleep i can achieve is 2 hours straight. Even though im deliriously exhausted I lay for hours trying to get to sleep, my partner has moved to the spare room as i am surrounded by pillows supporting my bump. I try to nap in the middle of the day for an hour (if i am lucky) to keep me going....but im slowly losing my mind, and have no patience left only agitation and resentment for all the sleepers in the house :( <br>  <br>  Some nights i see the clock round 4am and pray i dont go into labour because i dont think i have the energy. My partner gives me massages nearly everynight to try and relax me, I have baths, read, had panadol for the aches etc etc but i think besides the discomfort i work myself up out of frustration, and that contributes to the awakeness...<br>  I just keep reminding myself that its not long to go now and to hang in there and focus on the beautiful baby that im about to bring into the world...|`|75iWers9aa	yeah third trimester was really rough on me too. but something that helped me was taking a bath with lavendar scented bubble bath. i think that was subconcious because i felt like the smell of lavender would help me relax and it did help me a bit.  and also my fiance would rub my back and feet at night before we went to bed which helped a little too. good luck though|`|4Nn9bRkxaa	i'm on my 4th pregnancy and this always happens at the same stage.  i believe it's a way of your body preparing you to take care of the baby in the middle of the night.  you can't fight it.  just watch a tv show, have a bowl of cereal and try to go back to bed after an hour.  i'm not sure if you have a full-time job, but if you can nap during the day.  that will help with your tiredness too.|`|6KRzuNjpaa	i know what you're going through.  i'm 34 weeks and my hips are killing me! i spend the night switching side to side.  i hope you get some good advice cause i need some as well.|`|e9155bf3510b0ecc0d93d408d013a8c4aa	ask someone to give you a mini massage before bed. be gentle and rub the bottom of your feet to help with you back aches.

ZA5QTj3Zaa	I never even thought about planning a nickname.  To me, nicknames just happen.  I am going to give my child a name I want to call them and I am sure many nicknames will follow.|`|62f16dd680be1db7598eb6b8faaa8e4faa	We planned our sons name with a nickname in mind. He has a hypenated name and we use the initials. <br>  <br>  He has been called this nickname all his life and barely remembers his proper name, and is not too good at writing it. But he is only 6 so he has time.|`|Elxuvon8aa	I think the nick name should come part of the name our granddaughter is Giovanna but she goes by just G we wanted to nn her Georgie or her aunt wanted to call her Gigi but she is just plain G|`|34VXCyvVaa	I think a lot of people see a nickname as a sign of affection.  They want their child to have the dignity of an adult name as an adult, but they want to use a shorter name for their small child.  So why not?  Why should you care what they call their child?  As long as the kid isn't nicknamed something like Booger, it shouldn't matter if they want to name their kid Alexander and call him Alex.|`|Ki6jlwnbaa	I'm not sure why you care what other peoples nicknames are. I have a grandfather who's name was Otto, we called him Jack. I have a friend who's name is Edward, we call him Craig. How about you let people decide what their own names are and not worry about it?|`|gNUQ0CDtaa	Ya I mean it based on their personality|`|T1q4GWLkaa	I wouldn't give a kid a name just for a nickname, but I think it's nice to leave your kid the option.  I ended up naming my daughter Aya, so no name-related nickname...but so far, I have called her Boo (or Aya Boo), puppy (she was born with fur on her ears), frogger (she kicks a lot), squirm (duh) and a few others.  Not sure what will stick, LOL.  However, most of the other names I wanted, I had nicknames picked out that I also liked in case I wanted to have a shorter name to call her.  I don't think it's too weird, unless you actually don't like the whole name at all...then why use it?|`|nSJ6q5SQaa	I don't think it's dumb at all. Not everyone wants to be called Shiny or Miley forever. And what if Jack didn't like the name Jack? He could fall back on his legal name and be called John or Nathan or Nate.|`|clJTTYJXaa	No thats NOT dumb.<br>  <br>  LUCIFERRRR|`|r0HYuHubaa	Yea its dumb - just like the ppl in this section...|`|Rzwrz6vdaa	no it's not dumb|`|1oJ1qokjaa	Yeah i hate it! it's soo weird! there's this girl named katie in my class and she's been katie since kindergarten atleast (that's when i met her) and her real name is katherine. if her parent  didn't wanna use katherine, then why didn't they just name her katie and not katherine?!?!? wow, so dumb, same with this guy. his name was paul conor but NOBODY calls him that and his parents didn't intend to either and so they call him by his middle name (conor). a substitute teacher will be calling attendance and the first time she did, she was like "paul?" and everyone was like "what...? who's paul?"  ?????? so stupid! there was this one guy though who's parents really liked the name alec scott. the problem was that his last name starts with an s. u see the problem???? (hint: it's his initials lol) so they named him scott alec instead and just call him alec.  i just don't unsterstand why they just didn't change the middle name... whatever! people are weird! i know i'm definately not gunna name my kid alison and then call her ali for the rest of her life.  Im going to name my kids what im going to call my kids. lol|`|Fy9S6hjIaa	I couldn't agree with you more!!!  I mean I have nothing against nicknames as long as they aren't like pre-planned.  I mean some nicknames just kind of automatically come for names, so those are fine.  Like my niece is named Liberty and people call her Libby alot.  Or my sister's little girl Jasmine gets called Jazzy all the time.  <br>  <br>  It also irritate me when a certain name is thought of only as a nickname.  Like my sis in law named her girl Abbie, just because she loved the name.  When you introduce her (she's just a year old) as Abbie people will always be like "Well hello there Abigale".  Well, her name isn't Abigale, its Abbie.  I|`|OXxKTM6vaa	I understand what you're saying BUT everybody wants to name their beautiful child something beautiful and although some names are nice in full some nicknames are awful!! For example, someone who calls their child Nicole might hate the name Nicky or Coley (which the child will probably the called). I don't think people plan what they are actually going to call their child throughout its life (because thats impossible) its just basically bearing in mind what the child will probably  be called. If they wanted the child to be called something it hated (nickname wise) then they may aswell just call it anything.|`|o7I8vy3Oaa	No you're not the only one who thinks it's stupid..<br>  <br>  You're right, nicknames should come later when you can see what suits the person..
hNr3GFvlaa	This is a tough question.<br>  <br>  Net nanny censors way more than pornography and illegal downloads. They censor what they *believe* is pornography, hate speech and illegal software. With millions and millions of sites on the internet, and the level of automation and limited auditing of their algorithms, they end up censoring a little bit too much, just to be on the "safe side."<br>  <br>  On the other hand, the internet is quite abundant of nasty content.<br>  <br>  I would recommend installing a well secured OS and browsers, and experimenting with a set of workstations with netnanny set to the most permissive level, along with a set without netnanny and observing the results before making a decision.|`|prqrQcd1aa	I'm going to have to say yes on this one, I don't want to take my kids to a library and walk past someone on a computer looking at porn..honestly don't want to have to explain that one!<br>  <br>  It's the parents job to censor what a child is viewing!|`|M2yERqNSaa	yes they should have nanny net. if a kid typed in blonde dog, see how many porno sites start popping up|`|PG7WfGpHaa	Yes, because if you don't block the 'social networking' sites, all the library computers get taken over by noisy kids who don't have one at home.  They spend all day chatting to each other in 'text' language or some Asian tongue or whatever.|`|F6lZHRkVaa	The libraries here in St. Paul, MN have controls on them, you can't get to porn or sites that download illegal content, etc. I don't think you can get to game sites either.<br>  <br>  I think public computers should have controls on them not just because kids might access bad sites, but because those sites aren't safe for the computer's security. Anyone who has accidentally clicked on a link to porn knows exactly what I'm talking about. Once you go to a porn or illegal downloading site your computer automatically is at risk for viruses and other assorted problems.
bzkSIJYnaa	Another fabulous list! I'll choose Demetria, Mattea, and Mirabelle, all of which a rate a 10/10.<br>  <br>  Demetria - so exotic, feminine, gorgeous, and underused. It wasn't even on the top 1000 of 2007. I love Demi and Demetra as nicknames. <br>  <br>  Mattea - great rhythm, and exotic like Demetria. Mattie is an adorable nickname. Matteo is quite familiar to people, so they shouldn't have any problem pronouncing it.<br>  <br>  Mirabelle - a great alternative to the overused but gorgeous Isabella. I love the meaning - "wonderous". I think Mirabelle is absolutely beautiful, and like Mattea and Demetria, so underused! Miri, Mira, Belle, and Bella are all lovely nicknames. I think Mirabella is pretty as well, but I like how Mirabelle is simpler and to the point. Mirabel is another spelling you may want to consider, although I think I prefer Mirabelle. Mirabelle looks more feminine. <br>  <br>  Out of curiousity, how is Alekseigha pronounced? is it "uh-lek-see-uh"?<br>  <br>  edit: I think Alexseigha looks pretty cool! Maybe Aleksia? I am looking at my baby name book, and it listed Alexcia, Alexea, Alexsia, Alexsiya, Allexia, and Alyxia as alternate spellings as well.|`|CxRJwJsraa	Iris- This is a lovely name. It's perfectly old fashioned without sounding too much like an old woman. Because it's a flower, it has this soft-feminine feel, but the sound is far from wimpy.<br>  Juliet- Elegant and girly, and the literary tie adds even more class.<br>  Mattea (Muh-tay-uh)- beautiful and feminine, and feels a bit exotic. But, doesn't feel completely foreign, ie. bizarre. <br>  <br>  All three of these are lovely and do NOT need to be guilty pleasures!|`|IuzaNq2Uaa	Juliet:  Just so pretty and Shakespearean. I probably wouldn't use it either, but I love the fact that other parents do.<br>  <br>  Mariam:  Oh I love this variant of Miriam! I would use it myself but it clashes horribly with our surname (would sound similar to Mariam Salkatin).<br>  <br>  Tabitha:  Such a cute little name; reminds me of "Bewitched"!|`|PNMxbktAaa	Emma --- A very popular name, but it is so cute and sweet for a girl, and it's something that she can grow up with too. <br>  Jordyn/Jordan --- I love this name for both sexes. I think it's the perfect unisex name. <br>  Laurel --- I think this is a great alternitive to Lauren or Laura, which are a lot more common then Laurel. It's different and unique but without being crazy.<br>  <br>  I have to agree that Alekseigha is cool, but it would be WAY better if you used adifferent spelling. I like Aleksia out of Eva's suggestions. I also want to say that Clairen is a really cool name to. A nice twist on Claire.|`|m6EUv8zgaa	Iris - I think it's a really nice name, but I don't know if it's too 'old'<br>  Karen - again, I like the sound of the name, but it's a bit 'old'<br>  Jessica - like it, but I don't like Jess on its own as a nickname because it makes me think of a cat<br>  <br>  Also, this isn't in my top 3, it's just a comment, Alekseigha sounds nice but doesn't look nice, and I couldn't read it immediately. Might have problems with telling people how to spell it and read it?|`|NePgB9b2aa	Susannah; Lovely underused beauty. Plenty of nice nickname options as well.<br>  <br>  Lucinda; Adorable Lucy-name. I also like the French Lucinde.<br>  <br>  Clarabella; Oh-so-frilly but I love it. Great nickname options too!<br>  <br>  <br>  ^All those I find perfectly usable too. I don't see why they're on a GP list!|`|9qFBftcpaa	Keona - idk just sounds cute sort of like Fiona I guess<br>  Mattie - different spelling than Maddie which I like<br>  Shayley - not too common so it's unique|`|o9Ckf0h4aa	susannah,nora(norah, I prefer), and emma.These are 2 out of 3 of my faves!

Even though it's a bit common, it's great for a baby girl and an adult. <br>  <br>  Juliet - 10/10 - Again, I'm a bit biased (my name is Julie) but I love this name!! If I weren't a Julie, I would probably use this for my daughter. It's so classy, and I love the tie it has to Shakespeare.<br>  <br>  Lorraine - 10/10 - I believe it means Queen in French? Not sure on that. It's absolutely lovely, and isn't used much. Lori is a cute nickname!<br>  <br>  I also like Jessica and Tabitha =)|`|j0Jkq4z2aa	: ) wow its so hard to choose they're all great names!!!<br>  <br>  Carly- it sounds so popular, springy, energetic, cute i just love it!!<br>  Jessica- pretty, lots of nickname opportunities, feminine, popular, full of life, adorable<br>  Michaela/ Mikayla- enchanting, its an beautifully uncommon name, looks nice, graceful yet happy and vicacious|`|mI2BAbUjaa	Bella-Rae, I like the name Bella, and if Rae is the middle name, I think it would fit well with the name Bella<br>  Clarabella- I like the name Clara and I like the name Bella even though it kind of reminds me of the cow on Mickey Mouse<br>  Emma- I like the name since it is like 4 letters and it kind of reminds me of Emma Roberts (you know from Nancy Drew and Unfabulous)|`|xWg1krzBaa	1)  Iris because it reminds me of spring, flowers and a name I was looking at for my daughter Isis.<br>  <br>  2)  Kherington I haven't heard too much on this one, I like that it's unique, it reminds me of royalty<br>  <br>  3)  Lynn  it's my sisters name so I love it|`|uSpHh1NPaa	Jaida<br>  Laurel<br>  Macy<br>  <br>  Ok so i think Jaida is really adorable, and uncommon .<br>  <br>  Laurel is one of my all time FAVOURITE names. i love it =D<br>  <br>  and<br>  <br>  Macy, i think is really cute and sweet. i prefer Macey though, but oh well still great.|`|o7I8vy3Oaa	Clarabella - It's such a pretty name that just sings out innocence<br>  <br>  Paige - I've always loved this name, its so simple, yet so beautiful<br>  <br>  Tabitha - Such an original name.. So nice..|`|oYmZUO8Caa	I prefer Carabelle over Clarabella.<br>  <br>  But out of those names: Shayla, Lauren, and Juliet.|`|0sbhjGiraa	Mattie - I love the name Mattie. It's very nice change from Matilda or any other longer version.<br>  Mikayla - This is so cute! I think it's perfect!<br>  Juliet - I love this name! It's so elegant and beautiful!|`|781230deacf60344d474c72bd360783faa	Whitney<br>  Tabitha<br>  Juliet|`|XQKAQkPiaa	Keoni<br>  Alekseigha<br>  Amery  :)|`|ozXcqAO7aa	My favorite is definetly Kherington. I love that name. I like the way it is spelled and just how it is said. Nice and modern, but not too out there.<br>  <br>  My second favorite is Mikayla. I like the combination of kayla and the mi sound. I think it's a nice name that isn't to unusal that no one has heard of it but not as common as jane or sarah.<br>  <br>  For my third I'm gonna go with Juliet because i think that's a classic name. It's been used for years and years and still people like it.<br>  <br>  Nice choices. I really do love Kherington.|`|nAXmkl3Zaa	Whitney is adorable<br>  Nora LOVE <br>  Bella-Rae REALLY cute i like normal bella better though.<br>  <br>  I LOVE LOVE LOVE all of your names but those are my faves!|`|y9TVkzQYaa	Kensingten- Very Different and cute!!!<br>  Kherington-  Also Very Different. and cute!!<br>  Shayley- Cute more common then the other 2 but very nice. <br>  <br>  I myself really like unusual and uncommon names.
2QvIM81Haa	WTF? You should NOT be doing "sexy" dances in front of your MALE teacher ALONE! Are you nuts? Have one of your friends, parents etc etc. with you while you your "sexy" dances...<br>  <br>  EDIT:<br>  <br>  You won't be posing naked for quite a few years honey, no need to start practicing now... it's illegal for you to pose naked for photo shoots etc. So I wouldn't worry about that right now..|`|kc2Sa7ibaa	Well how 'sexy' are they? If he wants to see them just show them. Just breathe in and out and do them. They can't be that bad, right?|`|V6EgDitqaa	It may seem VERY uncomfortable and strange at first, but I wouldn't worry about it. Before a teacher becomes a teacher, they're checked to see if they have any criminal records. If your male teacher is a good teacher, he wouldn't get the hots for you or anything, especially if he's married. If you feel any tension between each other, I would tell your principal or someone.|`|d9d7dbffacb9c5256ef7afd69e6023b6aa	Think of it like a cheerleader dance routine.<br>  <br>  Actually, guys LIKE to watch girls do sexy dances.<br>  <br>  IF his tongue hangs out and he drools a lot, or stays behind his desk for a while after you are done, you are doing an effective job.<br>  <br>  As long as he doesn't touch you or offer lewd suggestions, then it's all on a professional level.|`|DkT8znckaa	Red flag: It is very highly advised you do something of sexual nature<br>  <br>  Seriously? Why do you need to do all that stuff for modeling, especially at what..... 13 or 14? Who wants to see a 13 year old "Shimmy her boobs" This is coming from a thirteen year old!! I went to modeling school a while ago when I was much younger, and so older people's classes may be different, but I was never told to do anything of sexual nature. Next they're going to ask you to pose nude or something. If that's what you want to do then, whatever...... he's your dance teacher - I'm not being stereotypical (I'm totally pro-gay) but aren't most male dance teachers gay? (Well maybe not most, I guess it depends on type of dance. I do theatre, and most of those guys are gay.) If he ways though, I guess it wouldn't be an issue. If he teaches at the same place modeling classes are held, he should understand. But still, you should not do anything you'd feel uncomfortable doing in front of ANYONE.|`|mfBkH3qtaa	Just casually ask him and tell him it is NOT because you like him that it is for one of your Modeling Auditions. If he denies just tell him Okay No problem. If he accepts ask him if he's sure because you don't want him to be uncomfortable. And when i had to do something that i was uncomfortable with someone there and only one person I always imagined it to be the person i was closet too which is my Grandma. Maybe this trick could help you?<br>  <br>  <br>  *edit* <br>  Is there a girl dance teacher that you KNOW where you dance at? Because if there is maybe you could do the dance in front of her? I know I'm always more comfortable doing something I'm unsure of in front of a girl rather than a guy.<br>  <br>  *edit**edit*<br>  Maybe after your next dance class,but before you have to do these dances(if there is one) go after and talk to them. Tell them it would mean alot to you if they could watch because you don't really feel comfortable doing it in front of your guy teacher. I'm sure you could set up a time and place. Usually teachers are willing to help out there students. Could you do it before class? Or RIGHT after?<br>  <br>  *edit**edit**edit*<br>  Okay well could you like do it with him and the girl teachers there? Or maybe don't do it in front of him. Video tape yourself at your house where you won't be nervous, then give him the video and ask if he has any critique or whatever.|`|QWZYpKUwaa	bring a friend someone you trust and feel ok doing these in front of i know they wont always be there every time but i would say bring one this time after all sometimes the opinion you need is one that is the hardest to get once or twice of this and you'll feel better about your own but as for safety bring a friend that way it all ends before it begins<br>  i hope this kinda helps as for what i do myself  i mentally block out everything that is not with in the zone i need and i stay with my space only at the end do i check for reactions|`|75c40712ce4c1c9063d61b17387937f9aa	if you plan on dancing in front of other people, but are embarassed to dance in front of your teacher, either your not old enough to do sexy dancing, or its not the right thing for you to do. you need to feel comfortable with yourself. and you don't need to dance sexy to show attitude|`|XlXFGojQaa	i think you should just let him know that the dances may be a little sexier then the normal ones, and let him know you have to do this becuase its part of your image and tell him to not take it to literally.|`|1GxXBSk2aa	That's really tricky umm you could:<br>  1.) Tell him ur not comfotablre with it, or u already have people to watch and you don't need him to.<br>       or<br>  2.) Just do it and explain to him that the songs and dance is like tht....<br>  <br>  Good luck. x|`|IpL5xCCgaa	well first off if he's a dance teacher you shouldnt be embarrassed just act like your in the room all by your self and if he's a regular teacher then thats kind funny sounding (depenting how old u r)
PzkGIlPRaa	For a woman the first time sucks, because it takes longer for a woman to figure out to to achieve orgasm. So go ahead get the first time done with then after your confortable figure out what you like. Most women don't reach their sexual peak until the age of 29 for men it is 17 years old.|`|XRMNQPUIaa	for me it really hurt , and continued to hurt the next few times.<br>  i bled it was gross.<br>  but its awesome after a few times =]|`|KNxs4PrZaa	yea and so was the second and third time too......it didnt really get good until later on when i was in a loving adult relationship|`|FRwaGpJaaa	It's usually supposed to be enjoyable. But the first time it can be painful for women.|`|WmKjeUELaa	It all depends on the person, to be honest.  Some women feel pain the first time.  Others may not.|`|YnLqItJPaa	If you're a teenager and doing it with another teenager, even if it's not painful, it's pretty much guaranteed to be lousy.  Sad, but true!  Like anything else, practice makes perfect.<br>  <br>  Whether it's bad or it's good, make sure it's SAFE!|`|aEZcc9LBaa	it hurt a lot the first few times i accually cried not fun for ur first time lol. deff. better when your in love and in the mood
tKMrzW9Caa	No, depends on who your with though probably. It is sort of ackward the first time, yet very exciting. I really planned it out the first time I had sex, and I sort of wish I hadn't. I sort of wish that it was a little more spontaneous, but not too spontaneous..see what I am saying?|`|9ZWcHnlJaa	it hurts at first, then it's uncomfortable. <br>  the second time it'll be uncomfortable too, but not as much<br>  by the third time its way better :)|`|BR4c4GGIaa	Depending on who you have sex with.<br>  For me it wasn't bad.<br>  But it did hurt alot|`|7Oee9Afaaa	It only sucks if you gave it away to the wrong person...and that u don't realize until you regret it.|`|NaYb4CnGaa	it didn't suck at all for me.|`|tnhF5Gaiaa	For me it didn't suck at all, it was pretty great actually.<br>  It will suck though if you lose it to the wrong person and if you have sex before you are ready.<br>  I was young, but I don't regret it at all.|`|df56ca79f426d12c4a6737af42e04037aa	for most sex is uncomfortable and awkward the first time.  after the first few times you'll get better and more used to it.|`|ibOD8ggDaa	it sucks if it not with the right but for me mine was not bad person and it hurts a lot in general it depends on who it's with|`|p25p9jTYaa	why do you ask this?|`|mfBkH3qtaa	Supposably it does. But I am still a virgin so i have no idea.|`|JRXpYW3Naa	It hurts, and yes, it sucks, it usually isn't to enjoyable because it is painful.<br>  (First time was with my husband, then boyfriend at 17, so I don't regret it at all, but it still sucked.)|`|SMv0Xj20aa	it hurts really bad... usually it only hurts the first time i guess, unless youre me and it hurts everytime...|`|P5Iq6nufaa	It's wonderful if done with someone you love, as adults, in a marriage. Otherwise, yeah, it sucks big time.|`|qcjAg3yOaa	horrible don't do it.<br>  <br>  kidding.|`|SNgcvrrXaa	Yes it hurts!! only at first tho : )|`|7f065a5f8c99309ffaeba42afcaa6331aa	i dont remember and dont care|`|EWFtQNSdaa	its pretty bad.|`|mvZTm2pjaa	not if u had foreplay:D

AA11297232	Good on you. I had three children  aged 1,2 and 3 and my house was always neat and tidy. Always had a cooked meal on the table for my hubby and i did gardening, sewing etc. There is no excuse for dirty homes.|`|BTuFtui3aa	There's a difference between a home being clean and sanitary, and being perfectly neat and picked up at all times.<br>  <br>  It's important for children to live in an environment where they aren't at risk, and living in a dirty home is not safe. A home needs to be basically sanitary.<br>  <br>  However, messes can happen really fast, especially with kids. I don't think there's anything wrong with the occasional little mess or things not always being perfectly tidy and put away. That just happens.<br>  <br>  If you enjoy keeping house, awesome, be as perfect as you want. But a little bit of untidiness should not cause you stress or make you feel like a failure.<br>  <br>  I think a home needs to be sanitary and not dirty, but if a house is a little cluttered and untidy but still within the limits of cleanliness and safety, I'm not concerned about it.|`|tquqyozfaa	Some people find it hard to cope with children and do all the house work. I myself am a single mum to a 3 an 1/2 yr old an a 3wk old baby i personally think that as long as the children are looked after and the house is not dirty who cares if you have washing to be done or a dish to be washed or ironing or toys left out my main concerns are that my children are fed, clean and looked after.|`|yUyx2nhmaa	sound like u don;t work? do you?<br>  <br>  anyway, i try too...i hate mess and can't bear piles of laundry, ironing and dirty pots...but it's a constant never-ending battle!<br>  <br>  edit - i work 3 days. i do everything practically and think my husband could do more to be honest. he's not been trained well by his mum - i expect my son to be an equal in his marriage when he gets married!|`|d1csiCLKaa	I have 2 kids who are 7 and 3. My house is clean, i may have a few toys hanging around but i do like to have a clean home and my kids know to put the toys away once finished playing with them.<br>  <br>  Having children isn't an excuse to have an untidy home.|`|sqdsIHwAaa	i look after my grandchildren 2 day a week. They arrive at 8am to a tidy house when they leave it looks like a bomb has hit it. Happiness is more important than trying to keep everything immaculate|`|uzIiaT4oaa	I have eight children and my house is untidy from the moment they get up til about two hours after the last one goes to bed. Untidy? Who cares. But if its dirty? then thats a a different matter..............|`|cu8fUJbMaa	I try hard not to judge, especially when you're talking about a working mom with young kids. It's a challenge to keep up with all the household chores in addition to caring for your young children for any mom, stay at home or working. I think as long as the house is clean one can't really expect that everything is going to be neatly in it's place and there is going to be no disorder at all. That's just not a very real expectation. I had one of those mom's who demanded absolute order and cleanliness in our home at all times when I was young. We weren't allowed to so much as have a shoe out of line in the closet. It was miserable for all of us kids.  LOL I wasn't quite as bad when I had my own home and kids, but I literally ran myself ragged trying to be sure my house was always picture perfect. What a HUGE waste of time and looking back, I truly wish I had let some of the chores go and worried more about having fun with my babies!|`|3nv8MXs4aa	I totally do! I am same way almost OCD with the house being tidy. there is nothing wrong with wanting your children to grow up in a clean and healthy enviorment. Plus it teaches your children to grow up with good personal and home hygiene. I think its not ok to let your house smell and be cluttered and raise children in that kind of home soo in my book your doing great and they will def be worth the effort!|`|zb8VWAcXaa	I totally agree!  I am a bit of a neat freak, but to me, a clean home is relaxing and peaceful, which makes my husband and I relaxed, which is good for our child!  I try to make sure I don't neglect my child to clean, of course, because he is WAY more important.  But it is nice to have a tidy home.  My rule of thumb is to try and always have it neat enough that if someone stopped by unexpectedly, I wouldn't be embarassed.  But it doesn't have to be spotless all the time, because that is unrealistic.  And my husband appreciates coming home to a clean, peaceful home.  I do think it is worth the effort!|`|qH1YcQ2kaa	my house is clean. i don't know about tidy though... i have a 21 month old son and i have a few friends that have children around his age who are always stopping by. i try to keep everything in order, but i am also trying to finish my bachelor's degree (graduating in september, yay!!) so my house is messy sometimes. but i always make sure it is clean.|`|uBAP6sqzaa	I have 5 kids, aged 15, 14, 12, 5 and 2.<br>  I can't say that my home is ALWAYS tidy but I do try to keep it as clean and tidy as I possibly can, if I know someone is coming over I clean up but its not always easy.|`|AA10107400	How very judgemental of all those people who said 'there's no excuse'!!! Well it must be lovely being perfect!!! Shame on you...it's women like you who make others feel inadequate when they are not!!!<br>  <br>  I'm quite sure your house isn't dirty to begin with but if it's untidy them so what? Kids like making a mess...get the older ones to try and tidy it away and if you can't be bothered with the rest then sit down!!! If your kids are happy and mum is happy then who cares if you have a show home. I'm sure also that your hubby loves you even if you're not done up like a glamour model!!! Happy and loved...you need to chill out girl and watch your kids grow up not worry about whether you've hoovered!!! Remember you're passing your OCD habits on to your children!!!<br>  <br>  Dianmond you sound like a top Granny!!! Happiness is most important!!!<br>  <br>  Gemz well done you girl...much love to you and praise!!!x|`|gx4s68s8aa	As long as house is safe for a child, then it really isn't another person business if the house is dusty, or has clothes hanging around etc.  Clearly if it affects the child's health or safety then it because an issue for child welfare.  But beyond that it is none of anyone's business.  True having a clean and orderly house is better than not.  But also being debt free, etc-  is better than not, but I don't want to start making silly judgements on anyone about things that don't have a direct impact on a child's safety.|`|ed052b6f800dc43932558f491194a7b8aa	doesnt matter what we do until all the kids are in bed our home looks like a war zone!<br>  its clean but messy till bedtime<br>  im pleased you have found a way for it to work but no idont think we use the excuse we have kids WE HAVE kids!!|`|T1q4GWLkaa	I cut people slack.  I can't always accomplish all I plan to and if it comes to giving more interaction to my baby or tidying things up immediately, I prioritize time with my baby.  My house is pretty neat but not pristine at all times.  Having grown up in a home with a single working mom with six kids, I know what messy really is.  I'm not going to judge someone for having toys to pick up or laundry to fold.|`|FcHplZtQaa	My house is neat and tidy most of the time, I have bloody shedloads of ironing though....<br>  <br>  As for the looking good for hubby bit, that sounds a bit 1950's housewife to me, and anyways I couldn't be bothered with that, I look good for me, thats all that matters!|`|doLyOac0aa	Yes it is an excuse, i have to have a tidy home, but each to their own,|`|zLVZyfwUaa	Everyone is different and you shouldn't judge.
AA12033653	I am on the fence like you.  <br>  <br>  I do have 2 cats in my family (one is my sisters and the other is my cousins) both of which are girls named charlie.|`|AA11210211	I'm unsure on this one,I think Charlie is good for a girl and Charles is good for a boy.|`|nAXmkl3Zaa	Charlie is a gender unisex name. It's really cute on a girl! I reallly like it as a girl name! Either that or Carly|`|zhrGiQsKaa	I consider Charlie a boys name but i also like Charlee for a girl. It is a unisex name.|`|y9TVkzQYaa	BOY!!!! I think it sounds better as a boys name!!!|`|Ki6jlwnbaa	charlotte/charles|`|0FZUwQ27aa	both, i like it better for a girl but thats my dads name, its short for charles,|`|e4M4uQXNaa	My favorite is definitely on a boy - Charlie just gives off that good-natured, ruggedly handsome and infinitely sweet sort of personality that I absolutely love.  Think Charlie Weasley haha!<br>  <br>  I don't mind it on a girl though, but only short for something more feminine like Charlotte.  If I had to choose whether to use it on my son or daughter, I'd still go for Charles though.|`|T0pkW783aa	I don't care for it for a boy's name; it sounds too feminine so if it had to be a boy's name, I would go for Charles.  For a girl; it's an OK nickname for Charlene or Charlamaine.|`|ppE0GtkIaa	boy or for a pet. I suppose if her name was Charlene, they probably would call her Charlie for short. Its cute, no matter if its for a boy or girl.|`|KWV6ZtBsaa	boy<br>  makes me think of charlie bucket from willy wonka<br>  :)|`|kr0IgpDeaa	Boys name|`|0uhRgfcsaa	boy|`|ewDKMeJkaa	boys|`|8SKpsVG7aa	Short for Charles|`|qXq0nmBzaa	Charlie is a nn<br>  <br>  A boy would be named Charles<br>  nn could be Charlie or Chaz<br>  <br>  A girl would be named Charlotte or Charlene or Charlize<br>  nn could easily be Charlie as well as Lottie, Lena, or Liza.<br>  <br>  To me, it depends on the full and complete name given to the child not the nickname.|`|OXxKTM6vaa	Erm when I hear Charlie I imagine it coming from the name 'Charles' BUT I see more girls with the name. Charlie is usually their proper first name (its not a nickname). I'm not into unisex names though and I do believe its a boys nickname, not a girls first name.|`|61NKzPzMaa	Charlie is a masculine BOYS nickname. It's a nickname for Charles which is a BOYS name.|`|NePgB9b2aa	Definitely boys, though it's fine as a nickname for Charlotte or Charlize.|`|tGGVeW3yaa	When I hear the name Charlie I instantly think of a boy, however I do like the name for a girl|`|AXEp1Bu6aa	I say either but if I had to choose a prefered gender for it, I'd say boy.|`|AA10478146	It's a nick name for Charles and the name of a perfume.|`|LSrxN4Qnaa	charlie as a girl name is pretty cool. its mostly for boys, but id go with it for a girl|`|NbOCIyBPaa	i love the name charlie...i would name a girl charlie...but its good on both|`|M11E0MrCaa	BOYS! DON'T NAME YOUR POOR DAUGHTER CHARLIE!|`|32uZ9JGdaa	never heard it as a girl's name.|`|8be50fd52c14928ab397f86265c4cb52aa	boys name|`|2xycmzW5aa	Both|`|Plu6OVoGaa	It can be a girl's name too. I know a girl named Johnny so...|`|3w7VztEWaa	Girl..it's much cuter and unique as a girl|`|QXDsjAiaaa	It's an adorable name for both a boy and a girl.<br>  <br>  But most people think of it as a boy's name when they hear "Charlie."<br>  <br>  But when people see that it's a girl's name, they'll say, "That's a cute name for a girl."<br>  <br>  I personally think its cuter as a girl's name. :]|`|X4xUHPPYaa	I think that most people have their head in the sand and only think it should be a boys name. I think though it could go either way, for a girls name why not change the spelling? Like Charley or something different but still pronounced the same way.|`|Hx2a3xGoaa	most people associate it with boys, but i have a friend who's a girl and her name is charlie. if you want to give a girl a boys' name, people get over it and think it's cool. i know girls named ryan and kyle.|`|uSpHh1NPaa	Charlie is a boys name.<br>  <br>  If you want it be suited for a girl try these spellings:<br>  Charli<br>  Charlee<br>  <br>  I prefer it on a boy, but it would be nice on a girl.|`|XCBWMlHmaa	I like it as both, but if we have a girl we are going to name her Charlie. We are probably going to spell it differently, a little more feminine. Either Charley, Charlee, Charli, or Charleigh. Good Luck!! :)|`|N3OuAcx3aa	boys name, eww when the child grows up and knows that there are more boys named Charlie she will be devastated. Charlie is definitely not a girl's name!|`|zPnIShrsaa	It can be both a girls name and a guys name. But ive heard more guys named Charlie then women.|`|wYOAY4RPaa	A boy, although a co-worker just named her female poodle Charlie, lol|`|5Gtr1kcPaa	It depends. Do you want it as a nickname? Or a long name? But it can be for both.        I hope you like my answer :)|`|YUDVmb77aa	i think of it more for a boy i never heard it being for a girl so i think boy|`|G9831g5Baa	It's traditionally a boy's name but that's what makes it such a cute girl's name.|`|8ade72837c9b0c3c88e20840c4a2e0a2aa	I consider it a nickname for both. But Charlie Brown is a guy.|`|Tj2jMlTvaa	It depends on how you spell it B- Charlie G- Charly either or it can be a boy or girls name|`|HqnPGMFYaa	defintly boy.dont make it hard for them.they will probely get made fun of for it.|`|IcAO0QuBaa	I know boys and girls named Charlie.|`|KYvqi1SPaa	Boys but I know to girls with that name and only one boy|`|0jpep8S9aa	Boy, but I know a girl named Charli.|`|4P3CMim8aa	it is primarily a boy's name, but it is adorable on a girl too! (cuter i think!)|`|oYmZUO8Caa	Definitely a boy.. but I love it for a girl's nickname (think Charlize, Charlotte)|`|wwaDbsQ2aa	i like it for both but i really think it cute for a girl.|`|XQKAQkPiaa	I heard it on a girl, and I thought it was very cute!|`|4Px54qn3aa	boy|`|5Dr5cvkwaa	boy|`|JZWzG04Gaa	boys|`|V8MK2QG0aa	both...but the girls version is charlee|`|7i9zha6Oaa	boy.. if u name ur daughter that you must really hate your daughter|`|Ry8aZXt2aa	both|`|ea325e13e7dc9a824f29fe89faa7edafaa	i like it for both, honestly! :D i really can't say i have a preference...

6CsdiJMLaa	It is an unfortunate name.Make up a cheerful nickname for your niece that has no relation to her name and hope that it sticks. Sorry about your brother.|`|YPRw3xYDaa	I'm so sorry to hear about your brother. It is sad enough that this little girl is going to have to grow up without ever knowing her Daddy but to have to deal with a ridiculous name on top of it is awful. To me it sounds like the mother is being selfish and stupid. She needs to think about what this child will have to go through and how this child is going to feel about her over it. Your sister-in-law also needs to take into consideration of what your brother/her husband would think. But I guess there is nothing you can do legally so just come up with your own name and call her that (something a little more cheerful) Hope she changes her mind for the child's sake though!!!|`|hwhKUYeUaa	I don't believe you. Anyone with mental problems like that should have the child taken away by social services.|`|nEMANzOWaa	tha names horrible|`|de28048ab10e261734a9e1e41461c18aaa	i dont think you should name a child that has anything to do with death|`|Fwm6lHmpaa	its her baby! not urs back off!|`|HvX6KvK1aa	yeah|`|bIaywrBCaa	I wouldn't name a pet rock that!

It has some of the elements of her first choice and, although the child will probably still hate her name, she won't have to suffer the ridicule that the original one would most certainly provoke.<br>  You have my sympathy for your loss.|`|syrh8J6Vaa	With him passing I think it is inappropriate.  I don't know how you could change her mind maybe tell her to go someplace random like starbucks and when they ask her name tell her to say morbidd.  Maybe if she lives a day with that name and sees all of the eye rolling she will change her mind.|`|iKLdGe1xaa	That is quite disturbing... Think about how the poor child will be mocked. Tell her that say her child will come home crying from school because she is being bullied. If she is called that revolting name give her a cute nickname too do with it when she is born and make it stick.|`|YO1w7gpiaa	Thanks for adding the part about your brother - it helps us to understand the expectant mother's mind-set.<br>  <br>  I, too believe it is a mistake to name a child "Morbidd Til Dyth"<br>  Fortunately, we have the later option of legally changing our names.<br>  <br>  Names like Morrine  or Moyne can be used as substitute names.<br>  Other names like Vivian that have to do with life and being alive might be better substitutes.<br>  <br>  Is your sister-in-law attending a "Grief Group?" or "Grief Counseling"?<br>  It sounds like she is either "Goth" or into the occult or deeply grieving.<br>  No stable person, when presented with the promise of new life cradled in her arms would bestow on that child a name meaning "death".  If she is unstable, she ought not to be left alone with this child.     <br>  <br>  Has this new mother's Dr. been informed of her fresh grief, and of the name she intends to give the child?   Given her situation and state of mind, her Dr needs to be alerted to the possibility of Postpartum depression in this woman............give her Dr the chance to get this new mother into treatment.   It could mean the difference between life and death for her child.<br>  & you may choose to also alert Social Services of this mother's mindset as being of possible danger to her child.|`|NfA7nDQkaa	i suppose so, but at the same time you're just thinking of this baby as a child, when she is a person and will grow up.

MUEsS8tYaa	She has ruined the lives of her kids. You know how difficult it is to give even 2 children equal attention?!?! How is she going to raise 14 of them properly? They are going to end up just running wild, the older ones trying to raise the younger ones, while the mom sits back and enjoys all the money she's getting off them. But then again, maybe its just an addiction. Maybe she is just addicted to the attention she gets by having babies. Who knows?|`|UVwRSpDjaa	I think she is mentally unstable. and yes I agree the doctor should have known better. I thought they screen people before they let them go through w/ this procedure. She has no job and set up a web site asking for donations? WTF? I don't get that. How did she think she was going to pay for 14 kids. I saw on inside edition last night her home is in foreclosure?

It's just not fair.|`|gWiZAsfBaa	Some people will do anything just to get some attention. She just wants to live off of the government for the rest of her life.

It is too bad that she ended up with 8 instead of one, but now that she is in this situation I feel bad that people are treating her the way they are.  Yes she was stupid and should have thought this through but she does not deserve death threats and she should not have the kids taken away- they have a roof over their heads and food.  Yes they may not get every luxury that they could get if she had stopped at one or two, but look at how many other families out there are living paycheck to paycheck.  Those kids still have exactly what this woman's kids will have.  I myself do not plan on spending my money to send her anything because I am one of those people living paycheck to paycheck, but I hope that she gets the help she needs and I hope people can stop being so cruel to her.

qRElKKjXaa	Did you get tired of trolling under "No, no" where you asked this exact question multiple times here and in parenting? People already told you that filming your child while hitting them, hitting them in front of their friends and making them put on a diaper is just sick and wrong. It still is, and you need to stop repeating this question.|`|WXCa8zQoaa	well my parents spanked me when i was little because that's how they were raised . i think that if you have a diaper on your to young to get them and you should leave their pants on . spanking should only be used for the big things . you should really learn to punish children a better way vs. spanking them a lot|`|mfBkH3qtaa	No. I won't ever do it to my kids. I won't spank them. No they won't be over my knee they won't be getting hit. No because I won't be hitting them. Why in the hell would ANYONE film? So they can jack off to it at night? No. Yes it is abuse. Yes abuse is illegal. I won't hit them. You aren't supposed to hit them. No do not spank them at ALL. Why would I spank a child in front of there friends? I will NOT spank my child. There i answered everyone of your sick *** questions. Happy. If you hit your kids and its yes to most of the questions then I hope you go to jail. NOW!|`|WI5KmVRdaa	i don't think spanking is necessary i think if you take the time and tell them what they did and then take something away from them or put them in the corner in my house when my son miss behaves we have a time out chair in the corner and when he tells us what he did wrong he can come out in other cases he gets his favorit toy taken away and then sent to bed early|`|90baecbe3029033e6f4b3cb1f967a617aa	yes. every know and then kids need an *** whooping|`|cP03k3cXaa	Spanking is one of the most controversial discipline methods. On one side of the debate are parents who believe it is all right to spank their children. On the other side are those who think that children should never be spanked. Somewhere in the middle are parents who believe that spanking should only be used in particular instances (e.g., when the child runs into the street). Part of the reason for the debate is that parents and experts often define spanking differently. To some, spanking means "slapping a child on the buttocks" (Straus, 1995, p. 5), while others consider spanking a generic term for any corporal punishment that does not cause an injury, such as slapping a child's hand for touching something forbidden or dangerous. <br>  <br>  The purpose of this digest is to explore some of the reasons for spanking (using the general definition of any corporal punishment that does not cause an injury), to examine the effectiveness of spanking, and to suggest alternative discipline methods. <br>  <br>  Reasons For Spanking<br>  While many adults would argue that hitting people is wrong, spanking children continues to be used as an acceptable form of discipline because many parents think spanking will teach children not to do things that are forbidden, stop them quickly when they are being irritating, and encourage them to do what they should (Leach, 1996). Some parents also believe that the nonphysical forms of discipline, like time-out, do not work (Samalin & Whitney, 1995). Spanking is also a practice used more in some areas of the country than others (primarily in the southern United States) and in some cultures more than others (Flynn, 1996; Scarr, 1995). <br>  <br>  Effectiveness Of Spanking<br>  While spanking may relieve a parent's frustration and stop misbehavior briefly, according to the American Academy of Pediatrics (1995), researchers suggest that spanking may be the least effective discipline method. To test this hypothesis, researchers surveyed parents, with the assumption that if spanking worked, children who were spanked would learn to behave better over time so that they would need punishing less frequently (Leach, 1996). However, the results showed that families who start spanking before their children are a year old are just as likely to spank their 4-year-old children as often as families who do not start spanking until later. Thus, children appear not to be learning the lessons parents are trying to teach by spanking. <br>  <br>  Spanking may be ineffective because it does not teach an alternative behavior (American Academy of Pediatrics, 1995). In fact, children usually feel resentful, humiliated, and helpless after being spanked (Samalin & Whitney, 1995). The primary lesson they learn appears to be that they should try harder not to get caught. <br>  <br>  Spanking also sends the wrong message to children (Samalin & Whitney, 1995). Spanking communicates that hitting is an acceptable way to solve problems, and that it is all right for a big person to strike a smaller one. In addition, when children are spanked, they may know that they have done something wrong, but in many cases, they are too young to understand the lesson. It is a very difficult message for any adult or child to understand: "I hurt you because I don't want you hurt." <br>  <br>  Finally, when spanking is the primary discipline method used, it may have some potentially harmful long-term effects such as increasing the chances of misbehavior, aggression, violent or criminal behavior; impaired learning; and depression (Straus, 1995). <br>  <br>  Alternatives To Spanking<br>  One reason parents spank is that they are not aware of other effective strategies for changing children's undesirable behavior. To be effective, discipline that is appropriate for a child's age should be used. Ineffective methods are often based on unrealistic expectations about what children are capable of learning. Parents may find the following age-appropriate discipline suggestions useful alternatives to spanking. <br>  Suggestions For Parents Of Infants<br>  Infants respond impulsively to many situations without a real understanding of their surroundings and abilities. Spanking will only cause fear and anxiety in children who do not yet understand such concepts as consequences and danger. <br>  <br>  When there is danger, grasp an infant's hand instead of slapping (Leach, 1996). <br>  <br>  When the infant is holding something that you do not want him to have, trade a toy instead of forcing the item from him (Leach, 1996). He will only hold on tighter if you try to take something away. <br>  <br>  Baby-proof your living space so that there is nothing dangerous or breakable in reach (Ruben, 1996; Samalin & Whitney, 1995). <br>  <br>  Leave the room if you feel your temper flaring, making sure that the baby is in a safe place like a playpen (Leach, 1996). <br>  <br>  Suggestions For Parents Of Toddlers<br>  Disciplining toddlers requires a tremendous investment of time, energy, and patience, so it is important to find effective and appropriate techniques (Ruben, 19|`|jwGkGaiCaa	In some cases yes I think it's necessary. Some children just don't respond to time time out or talking. The need a small but firm pat on the bottom. <br>  <br>  Not without clothes, no filming, no mirror, none of that...<br>  <br>  as for friends children it all depends on what their parent(s) say(s).|`|zETO5Kv1aa	i agree with sagechck

WoxMH0wZaa	Absolutely. My parents never ever spanked me or any of my siblings...it just wasn't part of our lives. But my best friend growing up got spanked a lot, and I remember one time we were about 6, and I came over to her house to play right after she'd gotten spanked and seeing how upset she was made me want to cry also. I also once saw her brother get spanked and it upset me so much. And then recently, I work in a daycare, and this guy was coming to pick up his 4 year old daughter and he said, "tell the nice girls thank you for watching me" and she wouldn't say it and then the dad reached out and spanked her bottom...it was only 1 time and through her pants but seeing the way she got upset and then mumbled, "thank you for watching me" under her breath made me so sad for her. that's why I'll never spank my kids.|`|3K7ffKn2aa	i cried once because my uncle pretended he was going to spank me and my mom had to tell him not to do that. But no i would feel bad but i never cried, but hey they never cried for me so whatever.|`|bVaZ72f3aa	yes i did..my sister and my mom were fighting verbally first.<br>  it was about a year ago(my sister being 18 and my mom 44)...anyway... they were not agreeing with something and my mom pulled her by the hair ...then my sister fought back and they started a fight...ugh it was terrible and it went really far,and i did start crying bcoz of many things from the past also being brought back...<br>  xoxo|`|ZTRakv6maa	i used to cry when my parents beat the living crap outta me when i was a kid. lookin back on it...i was a HORRIBLE kid sometimes.  guess what though...i turned out just fine. it all depends on the person who's gettin spanked, and their personality. it can really screw some ppl up.
kBqxRuPLaa	I completely thought my baby was moving when I was 12 weeks too! It could be gas, or it could very well be your little one squirming around, it's really hard to say. But I'm right there with you cause I felt the exact same thing. Congratulations, though!|`|AA10916164	I firmly think you need to be about 17 weeks to really feel a baby move... but everyone is different.

Enjoy the "pregnant but don't reallly feel it yet" stage... the last 2 months suck !!|`|R21aV2mLaa	well it could be gas...or some people say when you start feeling your baby early its a boy!! thats  what happend to me!! :) good luck|`|8RLGcshUaa	Is this ur first pregnancy?

So I don't understand how those who adopt aren't 'real' parents.|`|kBp9IzQqaa	How can we answer your REAL question if we are only ADOPTEES?|`|xBd96wvRaa	Ask yourself what makes a real mother. <br>  <br>  Surely not the fact your children came out of you - if that was the case no kids would ever go up for adoption now would they.<br>  <br>  There is no such real question you have asked. <br>  <br>  An adopter is a real mother if not more so - they choose and went through hoops to become one.<br>  <br>  I had my first child right out of high school she was an accident. Anyone can have a kid but an adoptive parent must chose too fill out paper work, be scrutinized, have interviews, etc. Perhaps they shouldn't be friendly to you? <br>  <br>  Really who do you think you are? So you have a working reproductive system just as all those babies mothers who are crack addicts do? That makes you strain yourself to get along with adoptive mothers? <br>  <br>  I am stopping myself now. You must be a troll.|`|Ag0jb7Neaa	i am not sure i understand your question<br>  <br>  do you mean how to BIOLOGICAL mothers handle the relationship with the mothers that adopted their children?<br>  <br>  if that's what you mean then there are lots of books and info online that address it<br>  it's not an easy thing to answer here<br>  <br>  but the mindset going into it has to be that the adoptive mother wasn't the 'bad guy'. <br>  <br>  please think about changing the word 'REAL' to 'biological'<br>  i think it's more accurate<br>  <br>  i don't know why you are saying you are not a hypocrite..but alright|`|ro5vFj9Aaa	simple you treat them with respect. they are the ones that are taking your baby and taking care of them and they should be respected for what they are doing. its not for you they are doing this they love that child and they are offering a good nice home for them. its up to you to not inter fer so much and you know what you are doing a disservice to them and the child for hanging around so much its not for you its for the BaBy and their rights that should be protected i this time of need.|`|HmkCFddAaa	Adoptive mothers are REAL mothers. Try treating them with the respect they deserve|`|1d02fcff81d2bb070fc361fbe28e3606aa	My birthmother met my adoptive mother when I was in my 20's.  They were very friendly toward each other.  My adoptive mother brought her a photo album to show her pics of me growing up and my birthmother told her she did a good job raising me.  If the prime focus is the child and doing what is best for him or her, there should not be a problem.  A birthmother can be happy that someone adopted her child and it didn't end up spending its life in a series of foster homes.  She can be happy that her child grew up with love and opportunities in life that she couldn't have given him/her.|`|j5y1pONfaa	First off, THANK YOU everyone else who has defended adoptive parents. I too am in the middle of adopting a baby (she is 11 months old now). Just because the baby isnt blood related that doesnt make the baby ANY less yours. In my case the baby I am adopting is blood related. She was my cousins baby. The mother died a few months ago at the age of 23 in a car accident, so my husband and I are adopting her baby girl. The baby was 2 months old at the time. We cannot have children and it is unfortunate BUT now we ARE going to be parents!!! Blood related or not. We are very excited about this. I may not have gone through 9 months of carrying this baby but I sure as hell am going through 9 months of trying to be her MOTHER. Its been emotionally/mentally painful because its not that easy of a process.<br>  <br>  Funny cause I just got an email today about a small child explaining "what does adoption mean?" Her explanation was "Adoption means that you grew in your mommy's HEART instead of her tummy!!" That made me cry. Looks like this child is alot smarter than most adults-especially hypocrits or those who look down on adoptive parents!!|`|1hOTlMvaaa	Not sure what you mean, but how can they not!  Some permit a letter once a year or an update, I know from women that i worked with, there e were two that did so. I know of others that no correspondence was permitted until 18. It can be tricky and hard on the kid who never has an answer of why they were given  up, yet others it does not bother. I thin from what I have observed from all parties that I have known well, and I do mean the kid, the mother, the adoptive mother, they all have a story. I must say I wish that many never told the kids they were adopted, but the more open the better in my book. I did know a woman that raised the child and did not adopt the kid, but her  mom did not want her, and she would have been Better to be adopted by the one and not see her real mom, it caused pure heartache for the kid who could not understand why she longed to see her and got to on occasion and it never changed that the mom did not want her, but had she not been around her, she would have appreciated the woman that raised her far more. I also know of people that years ago, had to give children up, abortion was not an option and it was difficult for all,  <br>  It is a  wonderfiul thing but it is hard on a child that has no answer about the why and some do meet their birth parents and do not want anythng to do with them.  Today I think it is great for a woman to let someone adopt her child, although tough, <br>  The ones that got a letter to the adopted mom from the agency and gave updates were better adjusted it seemed to know that there real mom had 3other kids that she could not afford and did not want to abort, and did not love the dad, but wanted to meet him someday. <br>  I thinkObama s mother did the right thing to tell him his father was a good man, and let him learn later when g rown that he was a drunk etc, so that Obama could grow up believing he was good and his dad was good and gave him positve outlook of who he wanted to be a good man ,and not one that he thought less then of, <br>  It is the reason that kids need to hear good things from their real parents about their othr parent so they feel good about who they are and perception of self is greater, then when a parent runs down the other parent and makes the kid lose self worth! Kids are tricky, good luck, it is a great gift to all involved , it is a matter of handling it with love and specialty that is deserved, it is a powerful gift that many do not appreciate as one of great strength for a woman to do no matter what, ;<br>  Bottom line is THE KID it is supposed to be about the kid they deserve that, it is what people need and are made from and gives them worth that they are-valuable people!|`|TmvVyS1haa	I don't get it? why wouldn't they be friendly to adopters. They do the exact same thing accept they didn't go through pregnancy. I actually think they're hearts are even bigger sometimes. Hey wait a second, that's really rude to not consider them real moms, you are a hypocrite|`|2Xh1ywWRaa	i think you should treat them like people if it wasn't for people willing to take these children the kids would have to be in a home i take my hat off to them anyone can give birth but raising them and loving them that's what makes them mum or dad|`|tK5swgX1aa	Because people who adopt children are very wonderful people who adopt kids out of the goodness of their hearts.

How can 1 person be friendly to another especially when they share a big thing in common like parenthood?  Do you think people who cannot carry children don't deserve children?

Wow as a mother with friends who have adopted children I all of a sudden feel sad that there are people out there like you.|`|eG2R1fYXaa	first off how do u define a real mother just cuz u gave birth dont make you a "real" mother.. and why r u calling them "adopters" cuz they want to take a kid whos parents didnt want see yeah  to me a real mother is sum1 hwo takes care of u and loves u rember this blood doesnt make u love|`|2tqdTCPQaa	i dont think thats hypicritical.....first of all think about their situation...some women cant have kids of their own....why should you judge them on wanting to have the feeling of having a child...plus if you think about it there is alot of children in this world who dont have parents....those mothers that adopt are taking poor children that dont have a mom and giving them one...|`|E7MgO2pZaa	Generally adults are friendly to other adults regardless of how they feel about them. You can be civil to anyone no matter how you feel about them.|`|7a0eXI92aa	Adopters are mothers too...? Mothers that have given birth can smile, say hello, use manners, and treat women who adopt with the same general courtesy that they (I'm assuming here) show everyone else they meet.|`|5XwY9aP8aa	Adopters are parents too. Regardless of whether they gave birth to the kid or not.<br>  <br>  Anyone can have a child, it takes a real man or woman to be a PARENT!|`|szE6NtO5aa	I don't understand the question.

Tasy is like my second mom. I have known her since I was about 3. And whenever my mom wasn't around we would talk on the phone. My dad just finds it awkward sometimes to talk to my sisters and I because he thinks we hate him for leaving our mom.

cP03k3cXaa	Go to your favorite seach engine and search, "frugal fun for teens."<br>  <br>  Encourage your teen to try volunteering at a community center, or at a camp for the summer. They might really enjoy the interaction with children, and it will prepare them for bigger opportunities as a counselor as they get older, if they desire. <br>  <br>  Offer to drive your teenager and their friend to the library once a week. Perhaps they could take a class, participate in an activity designed for teens, or just hang out looking at new books, finding new videos or even spending time on the computers. <br>  <br>  Find a pool. They will enjoy laying out, swimming and hanging with friends. If your neighborhood doesn't have a pool, perhaps you could find one that doesn't cost a lot, near your home and purchase a membership for your teen.<br>  <br>  Teach your teenager something new. Perhaps they might enjoy fishing, boating, biking, crafting, scrapbooking or something else. Encouraging these hobbies might keep your bored teenager busy for the whole summer. <br>  <br>  Look for free community events, such as movie nights, fairs, parades, live music and other entertainment. Take your teenager and his or her friends and drop them off to enjoy. You might be surprised at how much fun they have.<br>  <br>  Encourage your teenager to consider a picnic in the park with their friends. Ask each friend to bring something, and they can enjoy a fun time hanging out in the park and eating lunch. Remind your teen to back a ball and glove, Frisbee, football, and maybe even silly items, like a jump rope or hula hoop. Send a camera too. I bet they have a blast.<br>  <br>  Keeping teenagers from being bored over the summer is difficult. Encouraging them to pursue new activities, or continue educating themselves on a subject or hobby, isn't as hard as you think.

ebcfaff0504724aa2ad756522576c3b2aa	They do get wary about the fluids being low. Don't worry though, my son had a low amount of fluid (then again it was past my due date.) The chances for survival and good health if the baby must be born now are really quite good. The baby would need supplemental food and to be closely monitored for a while just to be sure the lungs are in working order. Do what your doctor is telling you and don't stress. I think you'll both be fine. Best of luck to you. I wish I was going to deliver any minute!|`|5UcdeeX8aa	That just happened to a friend of mine and her water broke at 36 wks.

Dv43MoGaaa	First thing you need to do is contact an attorney.  Many attorneys offer a free initial consultation where they will explain exactly what steps need to be taken in order for you to adopt your step son and of course the cost.  An attorney will first try to get the bio dad to sign away his rights willingly but if that cannot be done either because the bio dad doesn't want to or you do not know where the bio dad is then there are grounds that can be used to involuntarily take his rights away such as abandonment which includes not paying child support and not seeing the child, or abuse.  <br>  <br>  What the court will be looking for in you is that you are willingly to treat him as he were our own, that you will be a positive role model and support him both finiancilly and emotional and that you are willingly to take fully responsibility of him until he becomes an adult, all of which it sounds like you are already doing.  You also have the advantage of your son being older, which means the courts and attorneys take more consideration to what they want.<br>  <br>  The costs varies from state to state and attorney and depends on how hard the bio dad wants to fight this if he does at all.  In our adoption we could not find the bio dad and ended up having to hire an Warning Order Attorney whose sole purpose was to try to find him (he was never able to).  For my husband to adopt my four kids it ended up costing 4,200 dollars which isn't bad when it meant so much to them.
4sjW4Ig5aa	My son is 12, I've begun to notice a trend in his childhood crushes. They have all been of some Hispanic decent. We're caucasian, before I forget to mention it. Does it bother me? No. Does it amuse me? Certainly. He's 12, most everything he does amuses me somehow. <br>  <br>  We were talking the other day, I was asking him about his latest crush. Her name is Sam. Was just asking various questions, how old is she? Do they have the same classes? Ride the same bus? Is she cute? What's she look like? He was telling me all about her, with that little smile that tells me, he's alittle embarassed, but liking that I'm interested, when he surprised me with, "I like Mexican girls... What do you think about it?" <br>  <br>  My response... "Hispanic. You don't necessarily know that she's from Mexico, could be from many different countries, and the correct word is Hispanic. (to which I got a thoughtful 'Ok') And that's fine. So long as she's nice and sweet, I really don't care where she's from."<br>  <br>  As to black/white/red/purple, makes no difference to me.

And it'd "save me from trouble and problems" in the future if i just married white. <br>  <br>  While I am crazy about my b/f now who is white, I have many black friends and if I'm lucky enough to adopt, I'd like to adopt children of all races.

Major cities won't see a problem with it because the culture is all around them.  Although if you hit more rural cities, that have a smaller variety of races in their town, you're more likely going to run into some judgment.  Prejudice is always going to be around to a certain degree but as long as you teach your children equality and patience, there is no reason they can't be with whoever they want regardless of race.  As a minority race myself, I would commend my children in any choice they make racially.  As long as they're content with their decision, so am I.

I like your creativity with your daughters name.|`|iKLdGe1xaa	Yeah thats nice but there is a strange guy in my class called Trent but don't let that put you off!!|`|tHEBPDenaa	Trent Joseph sounds good!|`|MMj7YcXkaa	if your set on the name then why do you want more opinions?  the girls name is odd....she will probably get picked on and the boys name is nice.  would you call him TJ?|`|Am54a7c0aa	Yup, I think the name Trent Joseph is lovely!<br>  <br>  Best Wishes!|`|5dMw30kMaa	I think trent is great! I also like your daughters name it's very unusual and original!|`|uqzK3UBWaa	I love the name Trent Joseph!|`|zqxVU9xVaa	gerk lol|`|ot0TqzSvaa	yeah its cool.|`|dvw0Ui9Laa	first name is different. very cute!|`|KTU1oa9Gaa	i dont like the girl name...to late though.<br>  but the boy name is nice!|`|4z6d8QL8aa	bad choice for the girl's name, kinda late though but the guy's name is good you should probably keep it.|`|oYmZUO8Caa	Trent Joseph is okay. It's too traditional for my personal liking, though. Good luck!|`|6CsdiJMLaa	Trent Joseph is a good name, very masculine and formal. Esseker is new to me and I'm not sure how I feel about it.|`|7W26Njtgaa	Trent Joseph is nice. TJ makes an awesome nickname too.|`|7XIWtNr6aa	I love the name Trent!

AA11763588	It's based on when you started your last period.<br>  <br>  You can look online or ask you DR. They will use the wheel to determine until they do an Ultra Sound and measure the baby.<br>  <br>  Keep in mind a due date is just a round about figure.|`|CgwEfwOZaa	i think pretty much any time.  <br>  <br>  there should be pregnancy calculators online or you can speak with your ultrasound technicians or your doctors.|`|pZg05uygaa	If you don't know when your last period was, which is how the due date is initially calculated, the best time to determine it by ultrasound is about 10 weeks. <br>  If you know when your last period was, its 40 weeks/10 lunar months from the first day of your last period. Just google "due date calculator"|`|gWiZAsfBaa	During your first appointment, they try and give you a due date based off of your last missed period. After your first ultrasound, they will give you a more accurate due date.|`|caWdGcvgaa	Here is a great link if you know the last day of your last period and your average menstrual cycle!! Even if you guess it will give you a pretty good idea!<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.babycenter.com/pregnancy-due-date-calculator" rel="nofollow">http://www.babycenter.com/pregnancy-due-...</a><br>  <br>  Congrats!|`|a03b0b5014fce6dc67440fe39f59a44aaa	when you go to your first prenatal visit they will give you a due date. but sometimes it changes once you get your ultrasound cause then they can definatley tell by the growth of the fetus.|`|x1HoSdYTaa	The beggining. You find out when you got pregnant and then you will know the due date is approx. nine months away. Duh! LOL!
x1HoSdYTaa	Yes! 3 Months to 6 Months is usually when most people go and find out the gender of the baby! I hope your sister gets the gender she wants, and that her baby is completley healthy. Babies are the greatest times for people. They are wonderful! Careful, your sister is about to go through moodswings and cravings nonstop. Do not make any comments about the baby. Those comments are the ones that make the anger parts of a pregnat woman's swings go wild. Prey she gets what she wants or she could have a crying time. But that is only what 1 out of 100 pregnat women do. So, you probably dont have to worry about anything. Your sister will probably be happy for days once she finds out the baby's gender. I wish her well.|`|tqC2LCkoaa	Yes after three months of pregnancy heading into the second trimester you have the option of seeing the gender but, its only if the baby is cooporating it could be facing an  opposite direction and she may not be able to see its.|`|LBW8Rv35aa	It was my understanding that you needed to be about 20 weeks along for them to be able to see that very clearly. Why does she want to do it so soon? The baby would look a lot more "human" in several more weeks, especially for something as in depth (and expensive) as the 3D/4D is.|`|aca803aafd407291581b58b9be71df4daa	It is possible.  Early but still possible if the baby is in the right position.|`|IB9rN8Waaa	the nurse/doctor will tell if it is a boy or girl<br>  you can ask your sister for your wish to make him/her a name|`|VY4zWQFXaa	Most gender test are done at 20 weeks..but by it been a 3d ultrasound they may be able to tell because it's so detailed...|`|AA11471943	im not 100 percent sure, im going for one next week (27 weeks) because my baby didnt want me to find out at my 20 week one :)|`|ky740t4taa	yes is possible|`|ANsznbWsaa	If she wants to she can. She's right at the time they can tell.|`|8be341d723e0fe65c6c5f21fb174145aaa	no|`|AA11763588	Maybe, maybe not. Most Techs don't like to say for certain until you are 16 weeks, and others prefer to wait till between 20 - 24 weeks.|`|jgtfWjE4aa	possibly.<br>  <br>  although the genitals aren't fully formed until 20 weeks. <br>  doctors usually make mistakes guessing the sex before 20 weeks.<br>  so i don't know...<br>  since it's 3/4 D then maybe there is a greater possibility if the baby is positioned right and there isn't a hand in the way...|`|pZg05uygaa	Probably not, the baby's genitals are forming at this point but not to the point that the technician will be able to tell what they are.|`|DRb4Qlypaa	They might be able to see it but they probably will not point it out because it is a little too early to be sure and most techs wont tell unless they know for sure.|`|o9nSygbEaa	Probably, as long as the baby cooperates.|`|4ThRaoBOaa	if she wants to! some people deside not to so it will be a surprise!
nG9nxMySaa	5 days is not very late. after a couple weeks, take a pregnancy test (only if you've had sex recently, of course).|`|qkldiEwuaa	well if u have had sex lately then there might be a chance that u r pregnant. my period is iregular which means every month i get my peroid different times. i am a week late as well. i was suppsoed to get it on the 13 this month. it is possible that u could  skip a period. <br>  if ur really worried about being pregnant get a preg test or see a doctor|`|4Cq268Ofaa	I agree if you are that worried and that late. The only way to know is to take a test. Or you can wait for a baby to come out. Eventually you will get a period or a baby.|`|qi88afqYaa	your probably just late.My boobs get tender when my period is about to start. If your 2 or three weeks late then take a prego test k (thats if your having sex if not and your period is late past a month then contact your doctor).|`|5XwY9aP8aa	Home test, doctor...|`|IJ2QhfKEaa	could be stress and a uti. only one answer for that... do a test.|`|TjcTKyWhaa	well if you "sexually active" it could mean that your eggo is prego, but is not, then i realy dont have an answer for you, sorry|`|hYL6LJWeaa	Sounds like you're pregnant! Take a home pregnancy test then go to the doctors.
caWdGcvgaa	Those do sound like pregnancy symptoms, however since you are on an IUD I would defiantly make an appt. to go see my Dr. just to make sure everything is ok and they are not symptoms of something more serious... Because I think IUD's are usually pretty efficient at preventing pregnancy...<br>  <br>  Good luck to ya!|`|a03b0b5014fce6dc67440fe39f59a44aaa	maybe maybe not go to your OBGYN!|`|4e28acec7d8d9dd341ea9c2db519c9bcaa	How long have you been on the Mirena IUD?<br>  Was it an actual discharge like liquid from your nipple or was it like a plugged duct?<br>  If you have been on Mirena for less than 5 years there should be no reasons to worry, however, the only thing that can tell you if you ARE in deed pregnant is a Preggers test, go find one soon GOOD LUCK!|`|kBqxRuPLaa	I didn't have discharge during my first trimester. But I have heard of that..hmmm. How late is your period??
ImOgCILSaa	you cant even tell her face shape in any of these<br>  which is the most important part in deciding if a cut will work or not<br>  get some better pictures with her hair pulled back and of her face and post it in the right area|`|Q412OM5gaa	I think she would really fit the choppy haired look, honestly. I think something like this would look great (not the colors, just the style)!<br>  <br>  <br>  <a href="http://i215.photobucket.com/albums/cc290/xFrederikke/Hairstyles/HAiR6.jpg" rel="nofollow">http://i215.photobucket.com/albums/cc290...</a><br>  <br>  Or maybe<br>  <br>  <a href="http://s.bebo.com/app-image/7924954228/5411656627/PROFILE/i.quizzaz.com/img/q/u/08/04/03/indieeh.jpg" rel="nofollow">http://s.bebo.com/app-image/7924954228/5...</a><br>  <br>  I hope I helped! :D|`|oOMzcKITaa	she looks nice as she is:)|`|drI1vsJdaa	1."your cousin" looks an awful lot like your avatar<br>  <br>  2.There are never full pics of her hair.<br>  <br>  3.You'd get more responses in the hair category.|`|9ESlbo4vaa	what do you mean by choppy hair?<br>  <br>  and no i think this hairstyle looks really cute, she shouldnt change it too much/<br>  <br>  =)|`|zETO5Kv1aa	I think it'll be cute
XtbjzpK7aa	the pictures don't work, but she should just grow her hair out.|`|drI1vsJdaa	That photobucket hairstyle is really working for her.|`|7mKNHl2zaa	o would let it grow out|`|KUdmOWTKaa	Probably a good idea just to let her do what she wants, but tell her to think about it - a lot of hairstyles (choppy included), if she wanted to change them, take a lot of time to grow out. Also, if she wanted to curl her hair, or do anything different with it, she can't do much.<br>  <br>  I couldn't see the pictures, by the way, so I can't judge on that.<br>  <br>  But you should reccomend (hah, reccomending to reccomend..) a versatile hair style, that she can curl, straighten, crimp, etc. all she wants. It can have layers, just not too many or too high on her head. <br>  <br>  However, if she REALLY wants it, and understands that once she gets it you can't glue the hair back on her head, let her have it.
prqrQcd1aa	girl and boy scouts|`|75c40712ce4c1c9063d61b17387937f9aa	i don't know the age of your kids, but our local library has groups for kids of all ages. the youngest ones have a group where they library reads to them and sometimes does little shows. the older kids read books and discuss. readin is a very good activity to get your kids into. gymnastics. ice skating, golf, band in school. theres so much:)  Girl Scouts, Boy Scouts are great...4-H is awsome. sometimes the library has a bulletin board or some information about what to do in your area :)|`|BfBMRlNNaa	I would try horseback riding lessons.  Not only will it get your kids out of the house and interacting with other children, it will also be a great way for them to learn responsibility. My little brother was somewhat of a couch potato for many years, being introduced to horses completely changed that! Trust me, I haven't met a kid yet that didn't love horses!

Qdb5LZMCaa	my twins were born at 31 weeks. And their body's would sometimes jerk in their sleep. Im not sure what that is caused from though.  I hope you get a good answer. I will star this question as interesting
caWdGcvgaa	Very Very normal!! Sleep on the side of the bed closest to the bathroom!! Ya got about 10 more weeks and it doesn't get much better!! Good Luck to ya!|`|YnLqItJPaa	I'm 30 weeks today and right there in the pee pee boat with you, sister.  I find that stopping my fluid intake a couple of hours before bed helps me cut down my night trips to the potty to 3 or so, but other than that, not much to be done!<br>  <br>  It's so frustrating, though.  You feel like you're about to pee your pants and you finally get to go and there's like, a teaspoon or something.  Then you stand up and the second your pants are pulled up, you feel like you've gotta go again!<br>  <br>  The things we deal with for these little ones. :)|`|gHR4vlcDaa	YES sooo normal, very annoying but normal, you got 4-7 lbs in their, bloated body and tons of things going on, have to tell you hun it gets work for your next up to 12 weeks!  I felt I had to go every 5-15 minutes near the end and went to pee and usually a trickle,lol|`|wx32VQSWaa	definately normal. Towards the end of pregnancy, the baby is bigger and pushing on your bladder more so it makes you go pee a lot. I'm 32 weeks and I'm up every hr or 2 to pee.|`|uQc4UA2Caa	it is normal. im 29 weeks. my midwife said if u only pee a little bit each time but feel busting everytime u go then your pelvic floor muscles are weak. mine arnt as i pee the 'normal' amount each time.|`|U1RcZjqJaa	I'm 36 weeks pregnant and I can't stand up without having to pee. Its just the baby putting pressure on your bladder!|`|4rV15ZYuaa	You're normal :-)|`|PClByBedaa	This is totally normal...at least from what I went through. I stopped having to pee as much after the 1st trimester, then around 30weeks I was up every hour having to pee (also during the day). I'm almost at 37 weeks and I've controlled the frequency a lot by drinking more water during the day and trying not to drink so much before I go to sleep. Also, I try and "exhaust" my self more so I don't wake up as easily, just waking up made me feel like I had to pee again.<br>  (1st pregnancy)|`|aca803aafd407291581b58b9be71df4daa	I was up every hour on the hour in the last few months because I had to pee.  Your baby is just growing and pushing on your bladder.  If it doesn't hurt then you are probably just fine.  <br>  <br>  I know it sure did prepare me for being up with a newborn LOL!!  Good luck!|`|MWGSIoCgaa	I feel you! I'm almost 29 weeks and I pee almost every hour of everyday! Which really sucks! But my other problem is that I do have UTI. So, it's a "I have to go now or it will get worse" But hold on tight your almost there! Good luck(:|`|AA10916164	I think the other moms have answered the question.. im 32 weeks and am thankful I am not in the " pee every hour" club... I can go 2-3  hours without peeing... I think I have a large bladder.  Anyway... it is normal.|`|3EiOobEVaa	yea it is very normal and it will probably stay the same until you deliver. but you might want to go to the doctor if you feel like something is not right. For example fever, or pressure...good luck|`|twHXC9Draa	ummmmmmmmmmmmmm yah of course!
HJe7ln7gaa	I would suggest you wait another 3-4 days before getting a test. I understand that you might be worried right now but like you said - you do have late periods. So, just wait and if you still don't get your period and you feel your symptoms have heightened, then get a test. In the mean time, just relax!<br>  <br>  Good Luck! =)|`|R3ow0BLzaa	I would go get a pregnancy test done.. just to be safe.. its better to find out now and have a choice on what to do then to wait and have no choice. It is better to get it off your mind so your not thinking about it all day|`|gIT6xsz8aa	This site can really help you. Please do check it out!<br>  <br>  teenwire.com|`|FRwaGpJaaa	Give it a couple more days. Go buy a test to ease your worry.|`|kBqxRuPLaa	I would wait until you're a complete week late and then test. Try not to worry too much! Best of luck to you!
fad19796958a03b7595c8e67f22ec88aaa	It is hard to say what could be going on, really.  <br>  <br>  Implantation happens roughly 5-10 days after ovulation and that is WAY too early to test since the HCG would just be getting going at that point.<br>  <br>  I would wait another week before testing again.<br>  <br>  I would think, too, the chances would be slim.  You would have had to time intercourse at the right time (only a 24 hour window a month to even conceive) even if you did ovulate.  <br>  <br>  Many women don't even have regular, ovulatory cycles when they go off the pill for a while.  It can sometimes take a while for a body to adjust.<br>  <br>  I would stay on course with your pills and see if it works itself out...and again...test in a week or so.|`|AA10095363	I would call you local physician!  Best of luck!|`|6b712c50904ef0e46cb9ca3e99ede788aa	sometimes missing a pill does that but not all the time i spotted for two weeks when i did it once i had completely forgotten to take it. Sometimes depending on where you missed it means that you will spot the next month as sometimes it messes up with your cycle. Also if you arent late for your period it is too early to take a pregnancy test really and being on the pill tampers with the outcome on some home kits. If you are uncertain go to your doctor and have a test theirs is the most effective way to tell if you are pregnant or not|`|AA11841064	sweetie go to your doctor. its probably your period coming on since you missed a pill. i don;t think you are pregnant. if you want to make sure go to the doctor.|`|f6f2ccaac8e4bcb286f43b7def35ae81aa	I agree that it is hard to point out the exact reason; however, when I was on the pill, I did miss a few throughout the years and every time I did, I experienced spotting.  So, it could be happening to you too.  If you continue to experience this, it might be a good idea to go to the doctor.  I hope everything is ok and I wish you the best.
AA12099204	We had the same problem with our 1st grader last year when we moved across the country.  Try an after-school activity like karate, gymnastics, dance or sports, something your child is interested in. <br>  <br>  Most parents stick around to watch their child at these activities and you get a chance to see how your child interacts with those kids, and you can see how you get along chatting with  the mothers during the activity.<br>  <br>  My husband and I are in the same boat, as far as not fitting in, especially after moving from L.A. back to Alabama!<br>  <br>  Good luck!|`|1e003aca54d69a968e8d2b9491af9609aa	MeetUp.com<br>  Try it...it's pretty cool!|`|fOrAxMmfaa	Well, the first thing I was going to suggest was to hang around the pre school and meet the parents....bus huh...don't be judgemental the bus has lots of percs!!!!<br>  <br>  Have a party - invite kids your daughter wants to play with along with a parent! <br>  <br>  Go to the nearest park and hang out!!!<br>  <br>  Get to know your neighbors, even the weirdos next door!!!

Some 13 yr old are more mature and trustworthy than some 16 yr olds. <br>  <br>  If you are a teen asking, ask your mom or a teacher you respect to honestly tell you if you should sit now or wait. You need to know how to handle emergencies concerning the house - lights go out, toilet overflows and emergencies regarding the children (depends on their age.|`|uuoWMasuaa	16|`|CTxdaBWPaa	At least 16 and must be very very sensible x
KRqPoTN0aa	Yes you aren't alone my son is 7years old and has to be reminded for EVERYTHING!! And then when I get done telling him what to do and where and what, he says but WHY?? Then it is the samething the next day I tell him the samething over and over again and his response is WHY?? I would think after a few time he would no why and just do it lol!! And every time I say you know what at your age I had to do these things and I didn't get reminded or I just had to do them!! I don't know maybe it is a boy thing I hope so because my girl is 5months old and I really don't want to have to go through this again LOL!!! Good luck I know it can be stressful sometimes but I just try to calm down and think so what you love him no matter what he is your son and that helps me alot!!|`|SnQvsOPwaa	Its normal behavior. Why do you feel the need to yell. Does it really help?|`|b978f631fc787a963337206aa3833370aa	Sometimes ... my son is high energy but not hyper - he can definitely focus when  he wants to. Unfortunately little of that focus is on me. LOL <br>  <br>  I think it's somewhat normal for the age. I've often thought about making a reminder chart that tells him what he needs to do in the mornings to get ready for school, etc. On days off I'm more lax about it, but he'll be starting kindergarten in the fall and I have no idea how we're going to manage! I told him if he didn't start paying attention in the mornings he would *never* get to ride the bus because we'd never make it in time. <br>  <br>  I think it's different with boys and girls, too. Right now my 2 1/2 year old is excited about doing things like that and will say "Okay!" the minute you ask her to. We'll see how that turns out as she gets older. LOL <br>  <br>  I find we have an easier time of things when we eliminate distractions, especially tv, during crucial times when we need to get organized. That seems to help.|`|efbb15bd3b273c3e6801e5fe2b1add09aa	My son is 10 and he would not chose to brush his teeth or shower...so I have to remind him.  I don't yell, and I have established a routine...each morning after breakfast the kids know to clean up their dishes, get a snack for the day, put on their shoes, brush their teeth.  I remind them, and then follow up by asking if they did each thing.  Some mornings they are better than others.  <br>  <br>  I also remind my son to scrub with soap in the bath/shower.  Otherwise, he would just sit there and enjoy the hot water.<br>  <br>  My daughter, who is 8 will go ahead and soap up without being asked.<br>  <br>  If you find yourself yelling and frustrated, try a chore chart, it really helped my kids and my sanity.|`|1KIwM1uOaa	My son is 9 and we have to tell him to use soap, make sure you use shampoo on your hair, brush your teeth, brush your hair etc.  I don't know wy both of the girls are not this way.  I also notice I have to find more of his things in the mornings as they are never where they should be.    My husband swears it is a boy thing and he will grow out of t and I ope so|`|DcVoq5Tuaa	yes, I'm in the same boat. I get tired of telling them to do things they should already know. With my 13 yr old, he was constantly forgetting to brush his teeth, didn't want to bathe and nothing I said could get him to do it. One day, a girl he really liked at school asked him if he knew what a toothbrush was and how to shower. I haven't had to tell him to do those things since that wonderful day.|`|PuQyYMM8aa	Honestly... It just depends on the child and their personality. My 14yr old has always been like that, and it hasn't changed. It used to be with brushing his teeth and bathing. He is just a lazy kid and didn't want to do it. Now we dealing with him not completely homework, and always having to be on him about school work. <br>  <br>  My 9yr old is very different! He never have to tell him to do anything. He just does what he needs to do, whether its homework, teeth, bathing, cleaning his room. He is just that type of person.<br>  <br>  Unfortunately... it doesn't change!|`|pT7jrsAgaa	Selective hearing, LOL!  I have to say the same things at the same time day in and day out, but say something like "Want to go to CC's?" and it get's processed immediately!!!!
AA10624857	There is no genetic link with identical twins. Every pregnancy has the same chance of resulting in identical twins regardless if there are twins in the family or not. If, however, the twins are fraternal, than there is a slight increase in the chance of having twins, but only if the twins are on the mother's side. This is because ovulating more than one egg, called hyper-ovulation, does have some genetic link through the mother's genes. Genetics actually plays little role in the occurence of twins.  Twins do not "run in families" nor do they "skip generations" as was once commonly thought.  Here is a web site with reliable information:      <a href="http://multiples.about.com/od/pregnancy/a/familytwin.htm" rel="nofollow">http://multiples.about.com/od/pregnancy/...</a>|`|50iYxQ9Saa	Yes it is.
chiFCUC5aa	you need to join a play group with parents who have babies at a similar age....it helps alot.|`|aJLx0nhNaa	I think you need to figure out exactly what you're angry about and channel your energy towards fixing it.  I'm not judging you and I don't think your child is damaged, but it is an unhealthy situation if you feel like you need to yell at an infant.<br>  <br>  When I was very sleep-deprived, when my son was a newborn, I occasionally yelled at my husband.  I was irritated that he slept so soundly!  But that was appropriate - I wasn't angry at the baby for crying, I was angry at my husband for not waking up.<br>  <br>  If you are mad about your situation, then be mad about that and fix it.  But I think you should strive to not yell at your baby. None of this is his fault, nor can he do anything to fix it. And they can tell a lot about people's moods.|`|2448af06b59df00dd8a1a3ac6d057c75aa	i feel that way with my 21 month old .. just breath and step away if you can it is hard !! i sound like a good mom but a human . make sure you talk to your dr about your depression and also remember your body is getting back to normal still|`|zPYyGw8oaa	everyone gets frustrated...the key is to find a way to let it out without screaming...when you feel it coming on try doing something else like singing really loud, banging on a drum, doing jumping jacks etc...dont worry it is not going to damage her unless it is an everyday, all day thing.|`|U7oJrc3faa	It's not like your 5month old is going to listen anyway, so yelling is pretty much useless.|`|CIBtfxEqaa	I feel the same way. I raised my voice to my baby, who doesn't even know what she's doing. What's worse is that I work, so it's not like I'm stuck at home all day with a baby. I worry she will wind up resenting me or hating me. I usually wind up crying and holding her and apologizing endlessly because I feel so guilty. I always play with Hadley, talk to her, sing, dance, make her laugh.. but sometimes I just lose my cool. And then she just laughs at me. So I don't guess she knows what I'm doing but I do, and I feel like crap. So you are definitely not alone!|`|deIzFnV8aa	You are NOT a horrible mother.  You are a human mother, who loves her baby very much, but occasionally can't get the break she needs.<br>  <br>  I think we all lose our tempers with baby sometimes, no matter how silly it is or how much we keep telling ourselves that they aren't doing anything on purpose to annoy me.  Not taking naps is what really gets me, too, because I have been looking forward to that break time.  Its great to say "just try and be patient", but that isn't always possible. It is _much_ better that you yell at your baby than that you bottle it up, end up losing it, and do something more violent<br>  <br>  It takes a lot to make a baby fear or distrust its mother, so I wouldn't worry to much on that score. At the same time, it would obviously to be better to get rid of your frustration in a more healthy way if you can. Its ok to sometimes to step back sometimes and get a hold of yourself, even if it means leaving baby to cry for a bit, or dumping her in her crib upset while you do so.  In the end you would probably _both_ be upset anyway.  It might seem childish to go to the other room and yell at the wall, or stomp around, or whatever, but sometimes that really does help release the frustration that needs to get out.  Or if it works better, put on some soothing music for _you_ for a change.  I'm sure you will feel a lot less guilty if you manage to deal with things this way.  <br>  <br>  Hang in there!|`|9j6MvZrEaa	after you realize what youve done comfort your baby , give yourself rewards on days you can go without raising your voice! and if you can go a whole week go out and do something fun!
P7rosHBNaa	I agree with your statement, I think people should comment in a more polite way, instead of harming people.|`|7Qu4SjuHaa	4? DO I WIN =]|`|yIdwMPsoaa	I agree with you. They ain't here to get insulted they are here for advice.<br>  People are very ignorant.|`|w87icQkoaa	I think, I have no comment on this question.<br>  <br>  What is really appealing to me though..

Everyone has a right to their opinion.|`|Qydtjz2naa	I do agree with you, but I feel like sometimes it's okay to give a mean answer.  People come on here with some crazy stories, I think it's fine to give a bad answer on a bad question.  People also come on here asking, for lack of a better word, stupid questions.  Like, the "am I spoiled?" questions, when they just list off all the things they own.  Those I can see getting rude responses.  Or the occasional "what's wrong with having unprotected, underage sex?" People will answer those types with not-so-nice answers, and I understand that.  <br>  <br>  I don't like the answers that simply say "I don't care, get real problems", those are not helpful, and it's just as easy to ignore the question.  There have been times when I have answered a question with a sarcastic, or even rude comment, but only on questions that I feel deserve it.  I never say "that's stupid" or "I don't care", but I will say something about the question.<br>  <br>  I think if you come on here and ask a question, you should be able to handle the responses.  If you can't, don't risk asking a question.|`|yFX0mdOhaa	I agree, but unfortunatly there are a lot of people on line who are just out to get a laugh, or be mean.  I find that true on almost all internet sites.  That is the downside of anonymity unfotunatey.  <br>  <br>  Try not to let it get to you so much... it's like being upset about taxes...there is nothing you can do, and they will always be there.  I do admire you for standing up for what you believe in though.  Good for you.|`|3Pmq0rUMaa	I completely agree. we come here for advice and all we get is rude comments. i REALLY had those "learn english" because most of them are just because somebody made a typo..and then they get called stupid..sorry this happened to me and im in honors english..it was just a typo...yep..i was angry.  i agree. with you.|`|mfBkH3qtaa	I agree, I used to do that.

To each his own!|`|fhT2TCRvaa	I agree with you completely.<br>  I`ve posted one thing about my weight and I`ve got a few ignorant comments, like i`m very very very very fat :) oh well, aha.<br>  <br>  People don`t even read half the question before they answer, and everyone always has to be right so they just put you down.|`|wjtH6Bj2aa	They're only human.

l00Lo2zDaa	I think you should definitely remind him about the event that took place and by his reaction you will know if he truly just forgot because there has been a lot going on or if he is just so out of it (sickness) that his memory is foggy.  <br>  <br>  Lots of luck to you :)|`|Y16olPxlaa	Hysterectomy?

AA10188961	Well, my parents acted the same way, and my senior year I showed them what a bad kid really was.  I did everything they had been accusing me of and more.  It didn't change anything.  It merely confirmed their opinion of me and I ended up doing things that weren't me and that I wasn't proud of.  In the end, be your own person.  You are who you think you are and as much as it hurts, their opinion of you doesn't mean a hill of beans when you're my age.|`|prqrQcd1aa	Your own mother called you a self centered "B" with an "itch"? Wow, how old are you? I'd talk to your mom and tell her how this makes you feel and tell her what you've told us on here.. maybe mom just needs to see how good you really are...or maybe you aren't telling us something, i don't know. <br>  Either way...no mom should be saying that to any child!|`|tQ4QlE8Waa	Your making it worse if your going to pretend to be who your not. And in the end, you might come to regret trying to hurt your parents like that.

FQ4nhSiRaa	The contractions felt like menstrual cramps (I was induced). I had epidural about 5 hours later and felt very little. Felt practically nothing of the actual delivery. A little pressure, wasnt bad. Highly recommend the epidural, made the experience much more comfortable.|`|1ezYfkX7aa	With my first baby i was in labor for 28 1/2 hours and ended up with an emergency c-section. The first few hours of labor was not bad and when i was 5cm they came in to break my water and omg...within like 5minutes i was screaming in pain. It felt like someone was stabbing me in my belly over and over again. My contractions were coming back to back and i had hardly any time to prepare for the next one....I opted to get the epi and omg what a life savor. Soons that bad boy was in there i felt NOTHING. I couldnt even lift my leg for them to check me....dont know how pushing would have been because i had an emergency c-section due to my babies heart rate dropping but after my epi it was great!|`|5q7uPqVmaa	I went through natural labor.  Yeah, it was painful but obviously not unbearable because you get through it and I was glad that I didn't because my recovery seemed easier than a friend's who had an epidural.  I didn't really want to have any drugs but if you're worried about the pain, consider them!|`|dwt1sidtaa	I had a natural birth with my third baby.  I had fully intended on getting my beloved epidural but she had other plans.  She was ready to come out and did not want to wait for the anesthesiologist.  It actually wasn't as bad as I thought it would be.  Don't get me wrong, it does hurt.  I almost squeezed my husband's hand off.  But the recovery time is great.  If I ever get pregnant again I might try to go natural (on my terms!).  <br>  You can do it!  With or without an epidural!  Congrats.|`|YSCIX5VRaa	honestly..yes very painful,but there are epidurals to help with the pain..i never had one because my spine was curved too much..<br>  its kinda hard to explain the pain,except for when it first starts out it feels a bit like a bad menstrual cramp,then it gets way worse..
J4hOL3oLaa	My daughter is 4. I had her ears pierced for her 1st birthday. She loves wearing earrings. My mom had mine done when I was 8 months old.|`|XL3gqhVxaa	How did this change so much since I was a kid? When I was little, nobody I knew had their ears pierced until at least second grade (this was just in the 90s, not terribly long ago), yet now most people get their babies' ears pierced? I find that almost sexist how people assume that their daughter will want to wear earrings just because she's a girl. I turned 18 last year and have never had my ears pierced simply because I never had any desire for it; I'm really glad my mom didn't just make the choice for me. Personally, I think earrings on babies (especially dangly hoop earrings, which I've seen from time to time) look gross and tacky and just show how vain the mom actually is.|`|TSsT8QGgaa	no,,,,we didnt pierce them till she asked.  i have horrible allergies to some metals and i did not want to risk it with my baby.  that and with all the sweaters and blankets and such we didnt want them gettin caught on something and her hurting herself (she also had a twin brother and we were worried he might grab on them too).  im glad we waited,,and when she asked,,,we let her do it.  she was seven when she asked and we took her to get them done.  (the funny thing was,,she was fine with it,,never flinched, never ouched once,,,but her twin brother turned GREEN and looked like he would pass out).<br>  she was old enough to help take care of them, she was old enough to know to leave them alone.|`|jHmF9Ak1aa	I have a boy however, if or when I have a girl I will get her ears pierced as soon as possible. Not every girl will want her ears pierced but I would say about 90% of them do. If she decides she doesn't want her ears pierced simply take out the earrings and let the holes close up. The pain will not be an issue. I had mine done when I was 6 months old my mother told me I whined a little but a pacifier helped.|`|CyeYMaUuaa	My 5 and 8 year old daughters have their ears pierced. They take good care of them. They got them pierced when they were 5. I let them choose whether they wanted to or not. I didn't get their ears pierced when they were babies because they should be able to take care of their piercings theirselves.<br>  <br>  I will let my 3 and 1 year old daughters choose whether they want to or not when they come of age.|`|KNxs4PrZaa	no i think is sad to pierce your babies body for the sake of dressing them up like a doll.  its pointless and painfull.  i am not against ear piercing but think it should be something that the child wants done not the parents.  when my daughter is old enough to take care of her ears if she asks to have them pierced we will have a special outing to get it done.|`|fgnQ2vLqaa	No. My daughter is 17, and I never once considered piercing her ears. I think it's a decision she needed to make, and she's chosen not to have hers done. It would have been inconvenient in PE classes and playing softball and soccer all those years. The girls were never allowed to wear earrings for sports. I say give her the choice when she's older.|`|VuUz8NgKaa	When my daughter was 4 she asked if she could have hers pierced and I told her she could, it took a few trips over several months before she actually did it without freaking out. <br>  <br>  I was 5 when my my took me to have mine pierced and it was because I wanted it done.|`|776143369bb290accd3ea9aa251e66c9aa	My daughter is 14 months and I don't plan to have her ears pierced.  If she decides she wants it, then I'll take her to get it done.  <br>  <br>  I had my ears pierced at around 7 years old and wasn't at all traumatized by the experience.|`|LwbwMFX9aa	my daughter was 2 yrs old, at first I thought how horrid but then I remember having my done at 8 yrs old and it traumatized me so I wanted her to NOT remember getting it done and she loves wearing her earings. Shes almost 4 and loves to pick out her own|`|rZLctXwdaa	No. The reason: my mother pierced mine when I was a baby, and as I grew, they became misplaced. My daughter will be allowed to get her pierced when she is old enough to ask me.|`|tkkYIdIvaa	No. I hate it when parents do that. It hurts I am 17 and never am getting my ears pierced. Everyone else I know has them, but me, never.|`|LAsYy7C8aa	I'm allowing my girls to have the choice of it when they are old enough.  Respecting their bodies.  Babies don't need earrings.|`|jCy0J2ueaa	6 months is a good age|`|MMj7YcXkaa	i got mine when I was six, my sister when she was 4 and she got both her daughters done at around 6 months|`|sagjCRvKaa	No, I let my girls make the choice, if they want pierced ears or not.|`|575e1deabe166d4e96a463af1361e72faa	I did not, because I believed the ears are hers - not mine.  She should make the decision when she was old enough to make it.  I did my own ears when I was eighteen; but they were my ears.<br>  <br>  As it turned out, my daughter hated pierced ears for most of her childhood.  Then, when she became a teenager, she decided she wanted to get them done.  (My sister hated pierced ears for decades, but when her clip-ons were too much a pain in the neck when she was on the phone at work all the time, she decided to get hers done.  She had grown kids when had hers done.)  The point is, not all girls want their ears done.  If they change their minds later, no harm done.<br>  <br>  Having gone for long, long, periods of time without earrings in; I have learned, too, that it is a myth they will close up.  Mine never have.|`|5EFc1QYbaa	I have two boys but if I did have a daughter I would wait and get them pierced later.  I got my ears pierced when I was 7 and it was such an exciting thing to do.  My big sister (15 years older) took me to get them done (w/moms permission of course).  We went to the mall, got my ears pierced and celebrated with ice cream... almost a right of passage of sorts for a little girl.= )|`|IMJ9hNrLaa	Okay first of all, it is not ghetto. My goodness.<br>  <br>  I pierced my daughters ears the day she turned 3 months old. The nurse at the hospital told me it is a law (I live in TX) that babies have to be at least 3 months old. I'm not sure if its true or not but I waited until she was 3 months. <br>  <br>  She loves them. But some ppl wait and some don't. In the end its your choice.|`|sp1x3ZUAaa	I got my ears pierced when I was around 6 I think?<br>  It made me cry, lol.<br>  I don't think I will get my daughters ears pierced in the future, it's her decision for when she's older, and it's kinda weird to wanna stick shiny pins and jewels in your ears? xD<br>  Mine got infected and I took them out.|`|oWdNHaRGaa	I have a 2 yr old and a 6month old. im not against getting there ears pierced but im going to wait until they are old enough to ask me. cause some time baby's get ear infections and earring get in the road with little baby's|`|0ZR5eM5saa	My sister just had her baby's done. They look beautiful and my niece didn't cry a bit.  She hardly even noticed. I guess it depends on the baby.  Besides, it hurts more when they get older.|`|o1StMQeyaa	NO!!! My daughter recently turned 2 and I will consider allowing her to get her ears pierced when she is around 8 years old.|`|qxy9xCAsaa	No, that's ghetto.|`|1B91qtNQaa	I waited until my daughter asked to have pierced ears. She was 6.|`|im3vWyv6aa	I wait until my girls "want" them. My oldest daughter just got hers pierced last year, 6th grade, age 11.

She's only 9 months old right now, so we are going to wait until she is at least 10 years old because that's how it was done for me and my sister.|`|PFO1jxZGaa	yep, she was like 5 mos and her pediatrician pierced them at his office and she cried for a minute and after that never had a problem with them<br>  <br>  edit. my mom waited until I was ' old enough to take care of them on my own'. I was 9. So yeah I guess I was old enough. The problem, my mom trusted me to clean them and I didnt do it, results.. they were infected badly for a long time. Of course my mom stepped in but by then they were already infected and no matter what she did, they just kept getting worse.  Took about a year for them to heal properly. <br>  I took care of my daughters ears and they never even got red. Now she never has to go thru the pain I did when my ears were healing.|`|cTsb7vFjaa	That's a good question, I was pondering this recently, as I have a 12 week old baby girl.  Right now I think I am going to wait until she asks for it.|`|h59Bc4wfaa	I don't have a little girl, but my mom had mine done when I was 6 months old. They're still open 26.5 years later, lol.|`|ZcrsqMbcaa	4 months|`|n2O0NwR6aa	No, not as a baby. I think little girls are beautiful just the way they are - pure and wholesome, just the way God made them. They don't need earrings to make them look pretty. In fact, I think earrings on little girls look trashy and cheap. It takes away from their natural beauty.<br>  <br>  I've always thought that 12 is a good age for ear-piercing. That's about the time when girls go through that awkward stage, and getting their ears pierced can help them feel pretty and girly. They're also old enough then to be certain that they want it - and to take care of their ears and earrings. And doing it at this age makes it special, marking a stage of "growing up." You're becoming a young lady now, so you can get your ears pierced.<br>  <br>  That's my 2 cents! =)|`|vOFdHvlvaa	I don't have a daughter, but my older sis Rachel had her daughter Allison ears pierced at 6 months old, so a month ago, lol her and her twin brother Ryan are 7 months old exactly today.  I think they look adorable on her, but i personally would wait til my daughter (when i eventually have one) was a lil older than that, maybe even old enough to ask for it.   But really it's whenever u feel is right for child.<br>  Hope this helps and good luck, :D.|`|DMhAPurkaa	I wanted to do it right away, but had to wait until she was 6 weeks.<br>  She never had any troubles.<br>  I thought it looked sobeautiful and darkling, but everyone has their own ideas about it.<br>  I remember being in kindergarten and a girl had earrings there in my class. I thought they were so amazing. They were just little rhinestone studs. My mom would not let me pierce my ears.<br>  I finally moved in with my dad and stabbed my own ears with a needle and bought my own earrings.<br>  I just wanted to be a girl.<br>  So I decided if I ever had a girl, I would pierce them right away because I thought they looked so darling.With the little bow on the head and sparkle in the ears...<br>  Anyway, your call!|`|SrcoG7JRaa	No. I can understand doing it for cultural reasons (my friend tells me it's very normal in Italian culture as well as Spanish and most hispanic cultures), but there was really no reason for us to.<br>  If my daughter (or son, if I ever have one) wants them done when they're older, no problem, but I think it should be a choice.|`|prqrQcd1aa	My oldest got her's pierced when she was 4 years old, she told me she wanted it done at that time and so i allowed her to...incidentally she doesn't even wear ear rings now and she is 7 years old!

She won't until she asks for them and is old enough to take care of them on her own|`|gJrHBtp1aa	No I did not.

She was around 3 months.  She is 6 now and love it.
3fcf101a2615a631d556e32ec980eae0aa	As a teacher, yes our role is to guide children in learning.<br>  <br>  I don't like to place fault when a child is struggling.  Instead, I'd like heads to come together to figure out what needs to be done to improve.  If the child has a learning disability and is having difficulties in certain areas, the IEP needs to be evaluated, the resource teachers (if any) need to meet, and the parents need to be contacted.<br>  <br>  If you are a parent that is in this situation, I highly suggest you contact the teacher.  While it is the teacher(s) responsibility to keep in touch...it is also the parents' responsibility.  Don't feel like you must wait for the progress report to bring up any concerns.  Most teachers will welcome a parent that wants to be active in their children's education (because trust me, there are TONS of parents who just do not care.)<br>  <br>  *To details:  Woah, you definitely need to step in big time.  There is a lot going on there (especially with the resource teacher being out,) and I think you need to bring it up with someone else.  I am usually tentative to tell people to "go above the teacher's head," but in this case your son's education seems to be suffering.  You have made the right attempts, perhaps it is time to bring your concerns to the administrators' attention.|`|prqrQcd1aa	I think it is both the teacher and the parent that should do all they can to help a child out in school, and comminication should go both ways between parents and teachers. If a parent suspects that something may be happening in school, they should call... if a teacher is seeing a change in a student that is out of the ordinary for that student...they should call.<br>  <br>  Hmmm, this is a toss up honestly. It depends on how hard the child is trying to understand his homework and class work, how much the teacher is putting forth to try to get the child to "get it". It can also be the parents fault for not going over these things at home.... Is the child in classes that have fewer students for the classes they are not doing well in, are these classes specific to the learning disability??<br>  <br>  The last one is a hard one, how old is the child. Are they in small classes or big classes? Is there any type of assignment book that is going home for you to look at and make shure that work is being done and gone over so that you know the child knows what they are doing?<br>  Are there tests that are given in this class? If there are and the child is bringing home failing grades, then you would kinda know then from the tests that the kid isn't doing so well... does the child have an assignment book that shows what kind of homework is to be done and are you making shure that it is being done at home... is the teacher willing to inital an assignment book stating what homework is for the day so that you and the teacher have communication between eachother going on??|`|jCy0J2ueaa	I think that parents and teachers should work together. If the teacher is waiting until progress report time to tell you there is problem then maybe you could set up weekly reports that way you can stay on top of things. I think the teacher should tell you when there is a problem but if they don't it then becomes your responsibility to find out especially when you know your child has a learning disability. I don't think placing blame on the teacher or the child is going to help.
TczFL0p0aa	hell yes! it doesnt make you a bad mom! if you never hold your own child to feed it then yea but if you only do it a couple times when no one is there to help you, yes you need to 'prop' it!<br>  my situation- when your driving and you have 3 other kids to worry about (4 yr old and twin 1 yr olds you have too!)<br>  (i was a mothers helper all summer and we were driving to the museum and the baby wouldn't stop, she was hungry so.... it was only for a few minutes till we got there then we sat in the van for a bit had snacks, changed bums, got them all into strollers only to walk around in the hott sun for 20 minutes :P) <br>  ya do what you gotta do, mom!|`|uLdeIhHqaa	You know what...I know Im going to get thumbs down but...<br>  <br>  Yes. But, not alot. If I were to be folding laundry, or cleaning up around the house, My Daughter would sit in her swing and watch TV (Baby Einstein- Her fav!) and I would prop her bottle with a blanket. She didn't mind because she was getting her favorite thing and that was her bottle. <br>  <br>  But, like I said. I didn't do it all the time just occasionally when I would get backed up on house work and laundry. Its not being a bad parent or anything like that. As long as it isn't all the time, then its fine.|`|G0QugnQ8aa	No...I tried it once and I was right next to my son but he still coughed and sounded like he was choking so I won't try to do it any more...I'm just paranoid...I am sure that plenty of people do it and it works for them, but I am so paranoid (my husband says that I am way to paranoid..lol) that I won't EVER do it again, probably because I'd just spend the extra free hand time fussing over it and staring at my baby to make sure he is OK instead of using the hands free time to actually get something done...but I say prop when appropriate if your child is fine doing it, always under supervision of course...lol|`|CHCT7yjCaa	yes sometimes i just get so busy around the house with three babies under the age of 3 i have to i never leave him alone and i always make sure i pick him up to burp him in between so his belly doesn't get upset i don't think it makes me a bad mom|`|1BT6qtvGaa	I never once propped DD's bottle.  I made my share of mistakes, but bottle propping wasn't one of them.  With DS, I don't have to worry about any of that, put him in the sling, latch him on, and we're good. :)|`|AA11210211	lol Yes I did with my son!! I know I know I am such a bad mother right!! lol I never did with my daughter though.|`|7rCeCVl2aa	No, never.<br>  <br>  **Edit** I can honestly say I have never propped a bottle. You know how people get all crazy on this forum about breast vs. bottle... circumcise vs. don't circumcise... CIO vs. Don't CIO... Bottle propping is MY drive me crazy thing. I have never propped a bottle for either of my children because I don't like it at all. If someone wants to do that for their baby though so be it. To each his own.  That doesn't mean I haven't done all sorts of other "taboo" things for my children. People have their baby quirks and bottle propping is mine.<br>  <br>  Glad you "called me out" =)|`|rFtKFp03aa	I was so against it !  So so against it... worst thing you could do.. <br>  <br>  Now I have 9 month old triplets... I breastfeed two every feeding and the other one is being prop fed formula and I alternate .. <br>  <br>  I have no choice.. when my husband is home alone.. he prop feeds all 3 of them ( because we have them on same schedule, they all eat at the same time ) and one is done he burps and then baby b is done, burp and he will finish baby 3 by hand and hold that one because he can now.. <br>  <br>  Some times there are no options.. and I don't have a 3rd nipple, weird  I know, so I have to prop feed one somehow. <br>  <br>  If I had just one baby, I wouldn't, I would hold him ... but I don't have the luxury of one .. so prop it up.. multiples is all about doing stuff you don't like.. or wouldn't "normally" do<br>  <br>  We do always sit right there next to them though.. seems one is looking at someone else and drops his bottle, one is holding it and just decides not to to or one is drinking too fast and needs to sit up... so we don't get off easy prop feeding, its more work lol..|`|cDVAEHgCaa	I've never propped my baby's bottles.  She is held in my lap for each bottle feeding.  It's our special time together.  Now that she's crawling, she's too busy moving around to want to cuddle with her mom!  so I look forward to her feeding times.  <br>  <br>  But it doesn't make me a better mom than a mom who does prop bottles.|`|oUtEVKDHaa	Yeah I do but like you say I'M RIGHT THERE!. I'VE NEVER left her by herself that would be dangerous. but yeah once in a while I do it when I have to have my hands free. other than that I feed her myself but there is those times when you just need to do something and the baby is hungry!|`|hXoUFWL1aa	No, I can HONESTLY say I've never propped my son's bottle. It's dangerous, I don't want him to choke, and I love the time to bond with him! Come on people, your laundry??? Can't that wait 10 freaking minutes so you can properly feed your child??!

JbC50Xiqaa	It's def not a Hmong girl's name. I think maybe Chinese.|`|lnZjIhDCaa	umm idk but it sounds weird.|`|vVxVCOCraa	"Some non-Chinese Hmong advocate that the term Hmong or Mong be used not only for designating their dialect group, but also for the other Miao groups living in China. They generally claim that the word "Miao" is a derogatory term, with connotations of barbarism, that probably should not be used at all. The term was later adapted by Tai-speaking groups in Southeast Asia where it took on especially insulting associations for Hmong people despite its official status.[12] In modern China, the term "Miao" does not carry these negative associations and people of the various sub-groups that constitute this officially recognized nationality freely identify themselves as Miao or Chinese, typically reserving more specific ethnonyms for intra-ethnic communication. During the struggle for political recognition after 1949, it was actually members of these ethnic minorities who campaigned for identification under the umbrella term "Miao" — taking advantage of its familiarity and associations of historical political oppression.[13]"

Oh wait I know your a troll !|`|bYUdtQZsaa	Considering the fact that you got your period says no. You can't get pregnant from fingering yourself.

fHjSonssaa	My son was born at 33 weeks to the day.<br>  He did very well for being a preemie.<br>  He needed no assistance breathing (except a little blow-by oxygen which lots of full termers need too).<br>  He was 5 pounds, 3 oz, 18 inches.<br>  I got the 2nd steroid shot literally RIGHT before I started pushing (they had no idea he was RIGHT there- they didn't want to check me because they didn't want to start labor- <br>  <br>  He did have to stay in the NICU just shy of a month.  He had a bit of apnea (common for that gestation) and was on meds for a about a week for it.  The main reason he was in the hospital that long was because he needed to learn how to eat from breast or bottle- he was fed through a tube.  So he was about 37w gestation when he got to come home.<br>  <br>  They thought he would be there until then- (I think he was just a little lazy)  =)|`|KMtd5gr0aa	Awww thats so sad. 3 of the 4 were over due and 1 came right on her due date.

VKQzj4Pmaa	My son is not old enough to watch movies, much less understand them. However, my nieces and nephews have seen a lot of the classic Disney movies and are fine with them.<br>  <br>  Perhaps it has to do with the fact that Disney movies are not made the same as they were when we were growing up. Today, little kids are use to the happy, funny, intellect, modern and pop side of cartoons/movies. Movies and cartoons do not contain serious and dramatic scenes like they did 20+ years ago. <br>  <br>  Think of Old Yeller and The Yearling. Those were made for families, yet little kids today probably could not handle them quite as well, and probably wouldn't enjoy them as well either.<br>  <br>  Some children are just more sensitive to those things than others. For the most part, children are use to what they grow up with, and what they see as the norm, including forms of entertainment.<br>  <br>  If they scare your children and they do not enjoy them, then don't let them watch them. Stick with Marry Poppins and your girls will be just fine.|`|s4LWmcTjaa	Really?  Poor girl!  <br>  <br>  My kids love all the Disney movies.  Not one of them scares them so far.|`|ArYvBhkpaa	Haha,when I was small I used to FREAK OUT during Snow White.I was little then,and still have never watched the movie!|`|prqrQcd1aa	My 3 year old was scared of the movie Aladdin about 6 months ago!

As for the Jungle Book,  it is a snake and they are scary. Everyone is different, she'll look back on it years from now and realize that it wasn't very scary. Let her watch what she wants and if she gets scared tell her there's nothing to be scared of and let her decide if she wishes to watch the rest of the movie.|`|KNxs4PrZaa	my two year old surprisingly loves jungle book and all other disney movies and doesnt seem scared by them at all but my nieces are 4 and 6 and hate those movies because they get so stressed and scared, i wouldnt worry about it, i dont blame her there are some alarming scenes in those movies!!! just let her watch what she is comfortable with.|`|fRYQfvNaaa	Yes!<br>  Pretty much all disney movies have a evil bad guy, and children have a hard time distinguishing reality/movies.|`|qTVkydt1aa	I don't blame her.  As much as I love those movies they all have weird...dark sides to them that are apparent but not right under your nose.|`|jCy0J2ueaa	no my son is not scared but he does not like to watch them he thinks they are boring . he hardly watches tv.|`|31269476570b3829c86de1e8c487e423aa	most of snow white scares the crap outta me|`|VuUz8NgKaa	My daughter has never been scared when she has watched them.|`|776143369bb290accd3ea9aa251e66c9aa	My son is scared to death of the robot hats in Meet the Robinsons.  Doesn't bat an eye at monsters or dinosaurs or Bambi's mom getting shot, but can't stand the hats.  <br>  <br>  He also gets a bit concerned when anything is spilled.  Like in Disney's Twice Upon a Christmas, there's a part when Donald Duck is carrying a bag of groceries and falls down, spilling the groceries.  My son freaks out every time he sees that part.  He does the same thing whenever someone on tv spills something.  I think it's because he makes such an effort to avoid spilling his food and drinks that it seems like a serious crisis to him.|`|sp1x3ZUAaa	I am a teenager now and I find some parts of Disney movies scary or upsetting still.<br>  Up until recently I wouldn't watch The Little Mermaid because how Triton yells at Ariel - but I love the movie now.<br>  I wouldn't watch The Lion King because of the stampede and Mufasa dying.<br>  And Beauty and The Beast makes me jump sometimes.<br>  Don't let her watch Pinoccio.. kids turn into donkeys D=|`|AXHz5tmiaa	Well, The Little Mermaid scared me ALOT when pretty Ursula was about to marry Eric - and she changed back into the octopus lady. <br>  And I used to have nightmares about the old granny and the apple all the time - from Snow White. <br>  <br>  So yeahh.

KQF5X9Vpaa	best way to get him back on track is to try not to let him take an afternoon nap...play with him and stuff to keep him awake...that way when it's bedtime at night he'll be so tired he'll sleep through the night and should get back on his regular schedule the following day|`|AA11210211	My daughter usually wakes up around 6:30-7:00am then goes down for a nap around 10:30am then wakes up at 12:00pm then has another nap around 4ish it varies on how fussy she starts getting then she wakes up around 5:30-6pm and then goes down for bedtime around 8pm.She's a sleeper though,she was like me when I was a baby,I LOVE sleep!! lol<br>  <br>  EDIT:<br>  oh and she is 1 yr.|`|FHT6wsUpaa	Just go back to your normal routine. Even if he doesn't follow suit right away, he will. Do the same things in the same order you've always done them in. I don't mean ignore his needs to be comforted while readjusting, I just mean return to business as usual. It shouldn't take long.<br>  <br>  I know how you feel - we spent 2-1/2 days in the hospital with our daughter just two weeks ago (she had a Rotavirus and became seriously dehydrated). Those first couple of days home were rough...she wasn't feeling well and wanted to sleep a full 8 hours during the day. It took a few days before she was back to normal, but it happened more quickly than I expected. Good luck.|`|4g4K41t1aa	My daughter is 14 months but has had the same sleep schedule for awhile now. She wakes up around 7:30am, takes a one-hour nap around 11am and then goes to bed for the night around 6pm. <br>  <br>  My advice would be to put him to bed earlier than later because at least in my experience it seems that they tend to wake up around the same time in the morning regardless of when you put them to bed. It also seems to cause them to sleep through the night BETTER if they are put to bed earlier, even though it sounds crazy. When my daughter is especially cranky for whatever reason, i have actually put her to bed as early as 4:30pm and have had her sleep til her regular 7-7:30am without waking during the night. If i were you i would try to maybe eliminate one of his afternoon naps and put him to bed a little earlier than usual. Also, whatever you do, dont feed him or play with him too much when he wakes up in the middle of the night, i have done this and it completely sabotages everything!! :) Good luck, and hopefully he'll be back to his regular schedule soon!

I've never like Jack because its too plain, and Bassam sounds ridiculous. Maxim Thomas sounds like a character out of a book I read a while ago (her name was Maximum Ride). My point is, the other two just sound stupid and Zackary Steven sounds nice.|`|eqPFKpVqaa	Ehh, i don't really like Any of them.<br>  What about...<br>  <br>  Alexander Riley.<br>   orr.. for those middle names.<br>  <br>  Christian Bassam<br>  or Christian Thomas.<br>  I don't really like steven for a middle name, what about<br>  for a first name? well if you mix them up they could be really cute.<br>  Steven Bassam? << that one's okay.|`|u8slDDkLaa	Zackary Steven sounds ordinary<br>  Jack Bassam sounds like a celebrity name<br>  Maxim Thomas sounds cool like maxim sounds greek especially if you put US at the end of it<br>  I like jack bassam the best hey your choices your call :^O|`|yayDgY0qaa	Zachary Steven|`|MUp3wMThaa	Zackary Steven is very cute!!|`|1sQAtgTaaa	Zackary Steven<br>  its a cute name xD|`|bvjvV8k9aa	The only name I like is the first one and I would spell it Zachary.|`|KFT6ZbSbaa	i don't like the last one.<br>  the second one has '***' in it|`|cP1Asd7waa	I love Zackary Steven because its just soooooo cute and you can make a good nickname, Zack.

DTUOvJm0aa	if that is the career yo are looking into,then i see no problem, though it would be a little awkward since it's your mom. but hey, if you mom doesn't see a problem, and you don't either, go for it.|`|dPULl5hjaa	you posted this question recently|`|vnJG8UYJaa	I think this situation is between you and your mom.  It is certainly unusual, but you seem to have a reason for wanting to see them.  Many times family members are included in the birthing process.  Your location in the delivery room will be determined by the doctors, your mother and father, and then your wishes might be considered.  The primary concern here is the welfare of your mother and the new baby, not your future education.  If you are serious, your time to be in the delivery room to be helpful will come when you are educated for that process.  You need to be emotionally supportive of your mom and dad at this point.  Their needs come first.<br>  <br>  Good luck.
VKQzj4Pmaa	When I told everyone that I would be naming my son Gabriel, they all responded the same way, "Oh, so we'll be calling him Gabe!"<br>  <br>  I would then respond by telling them that I didn't care for that name, and that I, his mother, would only be calling him Gabriel.<br>  <br>  I can understand why people do that though. It just seems more proper and formal to give them that real name for serious or proper occasions. But nicknames really are today's norm.|`|AA11210211	Because it will give the child the choice of either name when he/she gets older.|`|aJLx0nhNaa	We gave our son kind of an offbeat first name.  We chose his middle name specifically so he could use an his initials as his name if he wanted to.  We never call him that, we just wanted to give him some options.  What you like to be called at 12, 21 and 40 can be very different things.  What you want to be called if you're a musician might differ greatly than if you were a doctor.  Options are nice.|`|lGSUToFQaa	well my real name is ayunnah, but no one can say that so my parents had to call me anna, i prefer my real name, but was given a nickname because people didn't want to learn to say my name, (teachers in preschool nad kindergarten asked my parents to call me something easier to say so i got my nickname at 4 yrs old, crazy they get paid they should learn my name) anyway some people do it because they feel it gives their kids a nickname, or they like a name, my friend named her son james matthew but they call him aaron, because she likes the name aaron, which makes no sense to me, name him aaron matthew or james aaron, it the other makes sense in some ways, you give the kids a chance to pick a nick name.|`|7rCeCVl2aa	People like to give a "formal" name and then a fun nick name stems from that.<br>  <br>  Imagine him filling out a job application. There's a HR director weeding through a pile applications... Jacob will sound more appealing and responsible than Jake so they may look twice. Doesn't mean that when he gets hired people won't call him Jake. Just an analogy.<br>  <br>  BTW I have always been a fan of the name Jake. It's cute. =)|`|jQDeTTVhaa	its a nickname most people prefer a nickname.....I do why does it matter?|`|da0bd1389f2c6ba2fe645d6d1c4be705aa	its a nickname|`|60052eab38f27341cc86e1493496f261aa	Can you imagine the doctor who was about to preform a life saving operation with the name: "Joshy or even Tuna"  It's a professional thing...looks better on paper.|`|MaDN7knJaa	Nicknames!

It rocks and is SO HAPPY!<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.marshmallowpeeps.com/" rel="nofollow">http://www.marshmallowpeeps.com/</a><br>  <br>  <br>  You can take a factory tour!!!!!!|`|kBp9IzQqaa	I have never had one but they look and sound good.|`|zLoyo24Taa	I love my peeps stale. The purple ones are the best.|`|hzgFAJv0aa	Yes, and they are delicious in small doses. (Too many will make you woozy and sugar high!) They are great fun in the microwave! (HA! Check YouTube!)<br>  <br>  I only have them at Easter (like Cadbury eggs and jellybean bird nests) but I can't say I really like the other holiday variations as much. They are a treasured childhood memory for me. We get them every year. My Mom likes them a little bit stale (chewy) and pokes a hole in the cellophane when she gets her Easter basket! My sister and I used to see how many you can put in your mouth at one time and still say "fluffy bunny" without cracking up.<br>  I love PEEPS!!!<br>  <br>  (My boys...not so much. They prefer the peanut butter eggs.)<br>  <br>  ETA: Serenity, I'm so bad about the Cadbury eggs that I buy an extra carton and hide them for myself for secret indulgence when the kids are not looking! I hate you can only get them once a year; but I guess that's one of the reasons I love them so much! LOL!|`|ArDBlPKYaa	I'm pretty sure they're just crystalized high fructose corn syrup.  I'm more intrigued why this is under the category "adoption."  Are you thinking of caring for some Peeps as your very own?|`|2wyDALHgaa	Yep.  And they are Dddddd-licous too.<br>  <br>  Someone insists on asking about them all the time.  He/she/it is making me hungry.|`|S5Lsbh0taa	Until this thread I lived a sheltered life.... I'd never heard of Peeps! <br>  <br>  But they sound yummy....<br>  <br>  Mamakate- my fave Easter eggs are Cadbury creme chocolate eggs...all this talk of chocolate is causing cravings, must go and find some.|`|7aCH91ISaa	I love peeps. My kids think I am strange because I like mine better when the are stale. Nice to know I an n ot the only one. <br>  <br>  I figured all the peep questions were a sign that Easter is near. (Or someone let the trolls loose!).|`|j0xfBk5Caa	Peeps are made of something that could be marshmallow. They are fun to maim and torture.|`|yDWcYXl5aa	Sugar and spice and everything nice.|`|AKJwWqdZaa	Marshmallow yes... and coated with a crystal meth topping.|`|Afoabqblaa	All this peep talk is giving me the munchies.  Who cares what they're made of...they rock!|`|3AfQ9UXYaa	I loathe that word so much and that guy... I mean troll... is so loathsome.|`|1lE3FLqOaa	yes they are with sugar on top of them lol|`|4B8FVlMtaa	thank goodness it is almost Peep Season. I like them stale so the sugar coat flakes off and the marshmello melts in my mouth yummy. the yellow ones are better then the pink ones and last year they sold blue bunnys too.|`|k1uUjz9aaa	there made of stolen babies.
d949d6371febf9695b8f8993df12ab4caa	Nope they didn't do either to me. Just kept me numbed up for a long time. LOL..Some women do get sick from it though, I had a great experience with it. Best of luck.|`|LY2LSzPJaa	It makes you completely numb from waist down , I do not beleive it makes you tired , but after hours of being awake and pain , then getting a epidural and feeling nothing , your sure to take a nap and wait for the baby to arrive. <br>  I had an epi with both children , but with 2nd child I got it at 7 cent and as soon as they were done I was at 10 and pushing , so I felt everything I was numb AFTERWARDS!|`|62N5DC8qaa	for me it made me feel the pressure no pain altho i laid up all day after being induced ,the loopy tho' i think was kinda nice when i too was really nervous about having a baby..|`|Ot8lxaMEaa	Nope just numb! It was sheer bliss.|`|q7HvkRpyaa	I didn't feel out of it when I had one with my son. It made me shake a little, but other than that I felt normal. It makes your legs feel fuzzy when they take it out and the feeling starts coming back.|`|jG8b3Mz0aa	Well I had it with my son, and it made me feel extra warm and cozy, then it wore off within 15 mins. So it was almost like me doing it naturally again.|`|iKPSOMiSaa	no, not at all. but i was sure glad to get it after those first few hours. it only numbs you from waist down. i wouldnt have made it without one!|`|HFKVREiUaa	i got very irritable and rest less leg symdrom, i felt as i was freezing and couldnt stop shivering or lay still, this was with my last one.|`|Ks7lENScaa	Well the first one relaxed me for about 30 minutes then it wore off.  The second one I had was for my c-section.  No I didn't feel drowsy.|`|3cLE5L7Saa	my doctor said no, but the IV drugs will
GGH0HVdvaa	He probably likes you.<br>  <br>  That "conversation" that you had is really random and kinda stupid on his part. But it sounds more like he was trying to get some kind of a rise out of you. To see how you react to him. He's probably trying to gauge your feelings for him so he knows better how to manage his feelings for you.|`|HtHFHfDKaa	He wants to know if you like to live life on the edge/ dangerously.|`|mpGjPV6Xaa	He's obviously trying to flirt with you. I know exactly what's going on, I'm a guy, I used to flirt like that, although I didn't hold back I would just talk to her. But, if she already had a boyfriend, I wouldn't flirt with her. So, I think you should just talk to him as friends and nothing more. Because, if you were to start something with him while he has a girlfriend could result in such big drama.<br>  <br>  Hope I helped !!!<br>  <br>  Joseph D : )|`|mfBkH3qtaa	He is more than likely a player. Don't listen to the person that said "Go for it". Because don't. You will more than likely get your heart broken in the end. And he will stare at other girls while he is dating you just like he is doing to his current girl friend.|`|SiPGcBnYaa	he is being a third grader|`|lS0iN9K7aa	lol he dumb  xb but he might like you..|`|1dVoVp1gaa	well ALOT of the guys im in school act that way when theyre around girls or stare and say weird/random things to them and it usually doesnt mean that they like the girl. But since i dont know the actual situation it could probably mean he likes u but there IS a high possibility that he doesnt so dont be so pushy about it. Or it could just mean he likes staring at u and saying weird things sometimes it doesnt mean that he likes u but thats just his character but like i said guys in my school act this way all the time and since im not in ur school with u i dont know how the situation is really like|`|NJv2zKxnaa	I think he might like you.<br>  He probably likes to get attention from you and stuff.<br>  MAybe start talking to him, be his friend. But make it clear that you do NOT want it to go farther since he does have a girlfriend.<br>  <br>  Plus are you sure he is staring at you and not his girlfriend who sits behind you?<br>  <br>  Good Luck!<br>  <br>  P.S. Pretty picture. you are soo pretty.|`|8cd6d1064a8d6379febc6914e867a26baa	He's obviously a flirt.<br>  <br>  He cant be TOO nice of a guy since he's flirting with another girl and he has a girlfriend.<br>  <br>  Edit: Someone on here said 'Go for it.'<br>  DONT.<br>  If he is acting this way with you when he has a girlfriend, <br>  imagine if YOU were his girlfriend, how he would be acting. <br>  =/ <br>  Really.|`|uAzToWC7aa	he really wants to talk to you and get together on a date sometime, so if you like him, you should go for it.|`|5IkqBDJ0aa	it means he likes you duhh. Hes acting like a douche sometimes cuz hes tryna act cool.|`|7f065a5f8c99309ffaeba42afcaa6331aa	what is he doing ? apparently he isnt studying so he can advance in school... thats what hes doing|`|W057fV0Vaa	He likes you, he is trying to get your attention.|`|eKDYbe9Laa	sucking ur lips|`|Yfgf47lBaa	He sounds like a average boy! lol!<br>  if you want to speak to him and make friends, well i think there is definantly an opening there for it!<br>  get to know him more.<br>  if he's smashing things to get your attention, then he obviously has some kind of interest in you. or he's just looking for attention.<br>  he might be a douche and a nice guy, but then again all of it could be an act... what is he like around friends and around others?! he might be a totally different person to what you think....<br>  get to know him and find out for yourself!<br>  <br>  good luck! :)|`|VELbTFrfaa	hes a normal dude that wants attention. maybe he just wants to be friends maybe more.|`|Imgb9hIWaa	IDK|`|RMGzjECmaa	he is flirting with u
hzgFAJv0aa	Dear Bloom,<br>  <br>  I am sorry that you find yourself in this position but congratulations on becoming a mother.<br>  <br>  To answer your question, your child's father has to relinquish his rights also. <br>  <br>  Obviously you care about your child, but I want to urge you to do as much research as you can before you make any permanent decisions about your child. You say you want your child to have a loving home, but your child already has one - with you.<br>  <br>  If I may give you some advice from a grieving mother to an expectant one:<br>  <br>  You need to be FULLY aware of what you are getting into because your decision will effect you and your child for the rest of your lives. There are many things it is imperative that you know before you sign your rights away. <br>  <br>  Adoption is often used as a "permanent solution to a temporary problem" as we often say here. Adoption is a life long process that effects not just you and your child but extended family, future siblings and generations as well. It is complex, complicated and fraught with issues - even in the best of circumstances. PLEASE educate yourself on the possible effects adoption can have on you and your child. The agency WILL NOT be truthful about what the reality is for the majority of mothers and children separated by adoption. ("90% of our cases have issues like yours" is a huge red flag.)<br>  <br>  Please understand that adoption is NOT a guarantee that your child will not ever have the same difficulties in an adoptive situation as you are in now. Adoptive parents lose their jobs, get divorced and sick and sometimes even die. Sometimes adoptive parents are abusive or neglectful. Sometimes adoptees die. While I am most certainly NOT saying this happens all the time, there are some really wonderful APs out there (I even know some!) BUT, how much risk are you willing to take on your child? <br>  <br>  YOU have the ability to work to provide your child a better life and prevent him or her from so many issues that can arise even in the happiest of adoptions. ONLY YOU can guarantee your child's safety and well being. You child is part of YOU and WILL miss you. ONLY you can make sure that doesn't happen. YOU need to make sure you have examined ALL your options before you make this decision. You need to know your rights and the rights of your child.<br>  <br>  For example did you know that:<br>  * "Open Adoptions" are NOT legally enforceable - APs can slam them shut and there is NOTHING you can do. <br>  * Your child's birth certificate will be altered to list the adoptive parents as having given birth to your child and the original one SEALED away.<br>  * Your child can recognize your voice the moment he or she is born.<br>  * Your child will not have the equal rights as an adult as a non-adopted person.<br>  * Omitting or falsifying paternal information can constitute fraud and overturn the adoption<br>  * Temporary Guardianship to a family member or close friend is an option if you need a little time to get on your feet<br>  * There are all kinds of grants and scholarships available to single mothers<br>  <br>  And that is just a start. Please be sure you educate YOURSELF. You might still decide that adoption is best and suits your situation and your child's needs the most but you NEED to be as educated as possible before a choice this life altering.<br>  <br>  I hope you will make the best possible choice for you and your child.<br>  <br>  There ARE tons of organizations out there to help you if you help yourself and your child if you want to do so. Here are a few links to more information you should know along with some organizations that can help you:<br>  <br>  About the risks of adoption:<br>  <a href="http://www.adoptiontriad.org/primal.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.adoptiontriad.org/primal.htm</a><br>  <a href="http://www.keepyourbaby.com/" rel="nofollow">http://www.keepyourbaby.com/</a><br>  <a href="http://www.exiledmothers.com/" rel="nofollow">http://www.exiledmothers.com/</a><br>  <a href="http://www.antiadoption.org/" rel="nofollow">http://www.antiadoption.org/</a> <br>  <br>  Assistance:<br>  <a href="http://www.wm8c.com/single-mother/assistance/permalink.php?article=44+single+mother+assistance+programs.txt" rel="nofollow">http://www.wm8c.com/single-mother/assist...</a><br>  <a href="http://www.granddollar.com/grants8.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.granddollar.com/grants8.htm</a><br>  <a href="http://www.singlemom.com/Housing/HousingHousingPrograms.aspx" rel="nofollow">http://www.singlemom.com/Housing/Housing...</a><br>  <a href="http://www.articlealley.com/article_114703_28.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.articlealley.com/article_1147...</a><br>  <br>  Good luck to you and especially to baby. I hope that whatever decision you make is the best one for you both.<br>  <br>  <br>  ETA:<br>  Purple Fairy, <br>  Adopted adults do not have equal access to their original birth certificates as non-adopted persons in many places. They are given legally falsified records. Their names are changed. These are just a FEW examples of discrimination against adopted persons. NONE of this is done with their consent. This is a violation of their rights. <br>  <a href="http://www.adopteerights.org/index.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.adopteerights.org/index.html</a>|`|AIJgbvIcaa	Honey, I really respect you.<br>  <br>  There comes a point where you need to do what is best for your baby, and not just be selfish. I'm really happy you are responsible enough to do this.<br>  As for the father, he has no legal rights. If you want to give up the baby it is fully your consent. You are not a loser, by any means, he is the loser. A child with a good life is better then one with a bad life, and I hope everything works out for the best. Do what you feel is right for the baby and for you.|`|aed5cad075214254f2f176a51206a7d7aa	The baby can't be adopted out without his consent just as he wouldn't be able to give away your child without your consent.<br>  <br>  I'm intrigued to hear about the agency saying they deal with cases like this 90% of the time and yet they still manage to stay in business.  This means they are doing something unethical and underhanded to violate father's rights.  Do tell how the agency have suggested dealing with your reluctant partner.|`|P2yRAWiJaa	Tell the agency that you are turning her over to (or the foster system) that the father is 10 yrs older, wanted you to abort, has other children he doesn't care for, and has no stable living environment to offer.  He'll possibly have 30 days to assert his rights and be able to keep the child.  If he can't show them that he can support the baby then they'll keep her and put her up for adoption.|`|yDWcYXl5aa	In our state, there's a law called the putative father registry.  It is designed for women in a situation like yourself where the father isn't around, unknown, or doesn't take care of the child, so that way, the child can end up in a loving home.<br>  <br>  Contact me and I can help you research the laws where you live.  If he's serious about being a parent, he'll do as the law says, and actually take responsibility, which he can't because he has no money, no job, and probably no ambition.  Good luck|`|Py1oiwYQaa	Sorry you have to deal with this. It is hard enough to decide about adoption, but this guys sounds like bad news. He probably won't bother trying to parent the child, so you just have to figure out if his rights can be terminated in your state. Since you're not married it might be easier, but all differs by state. In some states if he gets papers and does nothing he waives his rights. Your agency should be able to put you in touch with a lawyer that can advise you. We were talking to a preganant woman in CA when we adopted and the dad sounded like this guy, but unfortunately she was married to him, so it was much more difficult. In the end she decided to raise the baby, so I don't really know what would have happened if she had wanted to place the child. <br>  <br>  You should be able to have the agency deal with the guy as much as possible if it is difficult for you. Also you or the agency might try talking to his mom if she is a reasonable person. Good luck with everything.|`|UzGGflRfaa	Hey if u are having problems with him....you can get an agency in NEW Jersey where they do not need his permission.......I did it that way when I was younger..........in fact there are several states that do not need his permission.....get as far away from him as u can.......cuz he cant help you in any way............dont even have contact with him lest he try to do something stupid.....|`|165WRAJdaa	He will have to take the baby home and raise him/her. Maybe he will change his mind when it comes down to it? Maybe he will parent. I dont know but he does have the right. It makes no difference if your married.|`|RGMnbDPNaa	you can do this and get through with it. if he can't support the baby then you have right to put your baby up for adoption.<br>  God bless|`|L7uz5Xmzaa	* Your child will not have the equal rights as an adult as a non-adopted person.<br>  <br>  that is a load of steaming horse ****.|`|511e806a702f7f4b678843ad2696165faa	He doesn't have to sign away his rights.  You can sign away yours though when the child is born if you are so determined to not raise the child yourself.  This child is not exclusively yours or his to deal with.  You both must consent for adoption.  There are laws in place to protect his side of the custody.  If he doesn't consent, you can be forced to pay child support though.  I highly suggest working out a deal with him to let him parent if you aren't willing.<br>  <br>  ETA.  You CANNOT lie about who the father is.  It is falsifying the records.  He has the same right to the child that you do.  It is ILLEGAL and IMMORAL to lie about this.  The child deserves to have his/her parents in their life it possible.  Just because you don't think he can do it doesn't mean that he can't.  A court decides that, sweetie, not you.  Not anyone else.  If you lie about who the father is, or say you don't know, you are doing a disservice to this child who you claim to "want whats best for".  This isn't the way to go about it.|`|8LrnysX8aa	He can't offer this child any support and didn't even want it to be born at all?  And now he's going on about his paternal "rights?"  <br>  <br>  Let the adoption agency help you in whatever way they can. As far as I'm concerned, a father who has already tried to pressure the mother of his child into having an abortion against her wishes has already forfeited any *ethical* rights he ever might have had over that child's fate.  If the law disagrees, then let people more experienced in those laws help you to find a way around them.  If the people at the adoption agency have dealt with this situation often, then they'll know best how to proceed.  Let them advise you.|`|Of7KEsnXaa	First of all you are NOT a loser for considering adoption. <br>  <br>  If the only reason you are considering adoption is financial, and you would like to keep your baby, then rethink your decision. Poverty is NOT forever. And since the father wants you to keep the baby, get his butt for child support. They will MAKE him keep a job and support the child, therwise he will spend a lot of time in jail. <br>  <br>  If there are other reasons for you wanting to place your child, then you have a problem. Since he is the father he has rights.  There is nothing that can legally be done to terminate his rights w/o his consent. If the agence said there is then they are lying to you and doing something illegal.
KNxs4PrZaa	i dont see any reason not too, as long as you dont leave them in there until they smell bad (really stinky ones you will probably want to just take outside to the trash) but i dont think there is any harm in that, our summer home has a compactor and i put out babies diaper in it with the other trash and never had any issue.

bCdik11yaa	no, your fine! my 1st daughter was a very early talker and a slow mover. she was pretty caught up with everything before she was 2. now, my 2nd daughter who is just about to turn 2, climbes the walls all day long, but only says words she "likes". for example, mommy, daddy, sissy, dora, boots, tico...see where i'm going with this. it's perfectly normal, dont worry about speech classes. invest in the baby einstein "my first signs" dvd. my little one loved it and it helped her associate signs, pictures, and words together. she watched it a couple times and she popped out a few new words all on her own.|`|umGi6gTcaa	you can go thur your pediatrician or do a search for (your state) early intervention. I'm not sure about other states but it's free in NY. There's 3 interviews, the preliminary is two people who give their opinion on whether or not she needs it. The second is one person who talks and plays with her and the 3rd meeting is all of them and the final decision if intervention should be applied.<br>  My daughter is the same way, if you say "say monkey" she clamps her lips together. She only wants to use sign language. They all said though that her motive skills, clarity with words she does say and attention span is advanced.<br>  <br>  There's nothing wrong with getting early intervention, it can only help her not hurt her.|`|1dd5766e14349e285a9f0ab3f65f2291aa	You can take her to a pediatrician or speech classes, if you are really worried but providing she doesnt have any other issues, and she can understand what you r saying e.g instructions .<br>    They will probably say that all kids will talk in their time.   My brother was over 3yrs when he started talking, from then on, he was a chatterbox, my own son seems to be on the same path as my bro, he is 2 yrs and 10 mths and only has a handful of words.<br>    hope this helps|`|sIX1nhCFaa	Don't worry! i was the same when i was little, my parents said i never talked at all, and even i was asked i refused, but now im a chatterbox! lol they allways say i make up for when i was little. My brother use to talk but doesnt anymore, well he's allways on the computer. So it aint really nothing to worry about, just give her time :) Goodluck|`|X0B8P8Yiaa	well talk to her all the time say the words very carefully and make sure looks at your mouth|`|AA12035186	My first son was the same way.  Turns out he was talking, but we just didn't understand what he was saying.  I'm guessing your little one probably babbles some - when she pairs the words with what she is thinking/babbling about.... you will be thinking to yourself "why did I ever worry" because it will be non stop chatter.... and it goes on and on and...LOL  Well you get the picture. Best wishes!|`|4c7QomPoaa	If there's nothing physically wrong, then just give her time.  She's still quite young.  If she's getting angry when you ask her to talk, and you're worried, it could be that she's sensing your fear and reacting to that.  Stop worrying and enjoy that cuddle time!|`|NGFgKGeLaa	My little sister is currently 2 years and 2 months old, and she is basically the same. She can say a lot of words and a few phrases, but she can't speak in full sentences yet. I would just give it some time. A child can start talking anywhere between 10 months old and 3 years old, so your little girl is perfectly normal.|`|PLgNsOF9aa	Hey!! No worries!!! Your kid will speak when she is ready. Seriously, ask your mom when you began talking and your mother in law when your husband began talking. I'm betting one of you didnt talk early either. I have a 23 month old boy and he is talking and mocking but some kids do and some dont...my nephew is 3.5 and he didnt really start talking until closer to 2.5. I am sure your daughter is fine and just feels pretty pressured to talk.  Is she aroudn other kiddies, if she is maybe she would try to get her point across to them better than she would with you and really start to take off from there.|`|TJezsCkHaa	Check with the pediatrician.My daughter is 4 years old and she started saying complete sentences 4 months ago!<br>  <br>  Never push a child to do anything(like talking,walking,etc),it makes it harder for them.They would think that something is wrong with them and you are trying to help them do that thing.Those were my daughters pediatrician words.Good luck|`|5uEAHEQJaa	Perfectly normal.  My daughter hardly spoke until age 3 or 4, she is a perfectly normal 11 year old, makes straight As.  If you are concerned, speak toi your pediatrician on your next visit.
eD51aBzlaa	pregnancy.org<br>  <br>  <br>  there are alot of foods you should avoid hope this site helps :) it is very<br>  good|`|5wmrZEQ9aa	I was told to avoid onions, broccoli, leafy greens, and dairy.  The dairy made the most difference.  I had to cut dairy out for about 3 months, and my baby was much more comfortable.|`|avx7bLnKaa	all baby's have gas, it does get better with time...remember their digestive system is immature and as it matres the gas will lessen...most of the time you don't have to change your diet at all|`|KDb96QS7aa	Let me save you a lot of misery. With the exception of dairy, there are really no foods that you can eliminate from your diet and expect to see a reduction in baby's gas.  Food intolerances (according to a pediatric allergy specialist I spoke to) to something mom is eating will manifest themselves in other ways (like vomiting, diarrhea and rashes). Try eliminating dairy, but don't make the mistake I did of putting yourself on a plain meat and bread diet for a month. This is one of those situations where there are a lot of women who believe in old wives tales.
bmoCpcdraa	teach him some sign language or make some flash cards about 10 of them, when he eats show him the flash card of food, and say food,when he goes to bed ,show him bed card and say bed ,and when you don't know what he is saying ,show him cards one at a time, and see if he grabs at one,p.s when you show him a card let him hold it a min. each time. that way he will grab at one ,when you are not sure ............i hope i helped|`|4c7QomPoaa	How are you responding when you don't understand him?  It may be that he's responding to your frustration with some of his own.|`|iQ3g5OTKaa	Love. Body language, facial recognition. Use picture cards. Make pictures of every thing connected to your son. Glass of milk then speak milk. Ect. This will take time. But you both will be less frustrated. Talk to him. Read picture books of common items. Give him toys of objects. Read  Read Read. Music also helps.|`|ARKyNCLgaa	Talk to him with a grown up voice, i know hes cute, but if you talk to him in a baby voice, he could develop speech impediments.<br>  it will also help if you look for professional help online.<br>  just type in how to connect to your baby on google.<br>  <br>  hope i helped.|`|QIDhVAjjaa	when he points to something i would pick him up and bring him tword where he is pointing and see if he grabs what he wants.

gaWZ79gNaa	sounds like you need more lubrication <br>  <br>  KY JELLY! It won't hurt the baby but if mom is in pain it isnt worth it.,<br>  I had pain when i was pregnant and I just had to lubricate more.<br>  <br>  just tell your doctor to make sure everything is looking good in there!|`|ZIC9c4h7aa	he aint gonna hit the baby unless he is like a foot and a half long<br>  organs sometimes push down from the weight of the baby but will go back up after its born<br>  best bet iis not to have sex it can hurt u internaly and possibly the baby|`|a50IPPfSaa	tell the doctor
8C87ZfMwaa	The pains you are getting are perfectly normal.  I'm 27 weeks pregnant with my fourth baby and i have had these pains with all my pregnancies.  It is growing pains. Your muscles are stretching and it can be really awful sometimes.  Just another joyous symptom of pregnancy :)  In 6-9 weeks time you will forget all about it...|`|1WvNQLK5aa	oh my gosh, i went to the doctor this morning and asked him this. haha he told me the symptoms are very normal and where you are feeling the pain is where muscles are connected to tissue or bone and just stretching and pulling on things making more room for the baby. but yes i have been having these pains but am only 21 weeks :P|`|VGueFw4gaa	Call your obstetrician.  This could be nothing and normal.  Or you could be in pre-term labor.  (I had pre-term labor, and it felt similar to what you describe.)  But you need to find out from your doctor.  Not this website!
W2z5dCrmaa	We got married at 22, 2 years ago, and we decided to wait 5 years for that very reason of us becoming more bonded and established in living enjoyment life together so that when the baby comes in 3 to 4 more years, we will be well established as us, and our baby will be ours to both give as much as we can as baby being part of us.<br>  <br>  My Lady has a platinum IUD, and when we are ready, the gyno. just extracts it into a tiny tube, and then after baby is borne, it just gets set back in place again.<br>  <br>  I hope that I'm making sense? Haha!<br>  <br>  Me! :- )|`|Jswomud7aa	I don't have a night-life that doesn't involve checking on the babies before bed and waking to give one a bottle if that's what you're asking.<br>  <br>  I find my social life changed from going out late and traveling to mommy play-dates and playgrounds. So it's just different, it doesn't necessarily mean one is better than the other.|`|pXSKSS3daa	Oh, I absolutely enjoy life more. My son has taught me to do so, in fact.|`|F6lZHRkVaa	Life is definitely better after my son was born, but it's a different kind of 'better.' I used to party really hard before I got pregnant, I traveled the world and had an absolutely blast. I lived alone in a cute apartment downtown, paid my own bills, went out whenever I wanted. My life was wonderful. I had my son when I was 30 though, so I had plenty of time to do the party thing. After my son, my desire to kick it hardcore went out the window. Now there's nothing better than being home with him and watching him play with his toys. <br>  <br>  Have fun now and enjoy your freedom while you have it. There's nothing wrong with that, you should absolutely do as much wild living as you possibly can! But one day you may find yourself wanting to settle down with a child, and that's okay too. It's entirely your choice!|`|7rCeCVl2aa	My social life is gone. Y!A... this is pretty much it for me. =) Oddly though I enjoy life more now. My boys give me so much to look forward to every day. What new "trick" will Dane learn today? ... What will Dominic say to bring to bring me to stitches laughing?<br>  <br>  My social life can wait. My boys are my social life now. =)|`|ggETPqedaa	Actually, I wasn't a very social person before my son. Though now that he's born, I've been more social in his two months of life than I truly ever have been. It's strange actually, I'm not exactly sure why that is either.|`|h59Bc4wfaa	Ha ha, I thought I was the only one! It's like a rule made up by some long lost mom, that when baby is away, the parents get to play. <br>  <br>  I try and have either grandma take the baby 4 nights a month so me and daddy can go out. Ahh, it's nice~|`|PFO1jxZGaa	I dont think the two are eally related.. I mean I enjoy my life but in a different way than before. <br>  I used to go out a lot and have a very busy social life. SInce my kids were born I have been in a bar once ( in six years) and my social life has come to this, pretty much. I see some freinds who have kids during the days but my nightlife is right here. <br>  I am much more fulfilled now than I was barhopping and I would not change my life for nothing. Just because I'm not at the last call at the bar doesnt mean I'm not happy and living my life to the fullest. <br>  I was an only child too and one of my greatest moments of happyness is seeing my kids playing together. It jsut makes me happy to know I gave them something I never had.|`|EyKJ737daa	It's certainly a whole new world once kids arrive on the scene.  I love having my kids and I wouldn't change it for anything.  sure social life is put on hold temporarily but it's not forever and honestly, I think I get more laughs and wonderful memorable moments out of my kids than going out with friends for a night on the town!  Now most of my friends have kids too so we now get to socialize I guess on a whole new level so no I don't regret anything at all.  I'm definitely much more happy too.|`|OrKpKxkHaa	I was a mom at age 18 so I never really experienced the "going out" phase until my daughter was a little older. I enjoy going out sometimes but I find that I like to be home a little more. It's nice to get out once in a while and act a little wreckless :) I am much more friendly as random strangers begin conversations with you as soon as you start a bump. I just had another baby 3 months ago and find myself lonely when they are away. I am happy being a mommy!|`|33h5R8nTaa	I loved going out before the baby and me and my hubby went out almost every night. I am only 22 and love hanging out with friends but its great they understand we cant always go out and so they just come over and we have a game night or something and just chill and they play with the baby and its fun for everyone. If me and my hubby wanna go out by ourselevs one of our friends watchs ourt daughter. she is 8 months now and we have a busy next 2 weeks because eveyones birthday is with in the next 2 weeks and being in the early 20's were going bar hopping.|`|AA12080472	i feel like i have more things to talk about now.  i started speaking to people more.  which created new friendships, our conversation does not revolve around the kids but it was a conversation starter.  <br>  <br>  i throw more parties.<br>  <br>  i dont' smoke weed anymore.  i don't like to drink either.<br>  <br>  he is 6 years old  and from the time he was 4 months to now he still makes me laugh alot|`|EHY3FnAmaa	I enjoy life more than ever before,<br>  Having a baby has just made life more enjoyable, its perfect.<br>   I have become more motivated to get my degree and just better my life. My son inspires me to make myself a better person.|`|nmu6coapaa	Yea Im a much happier person now that I have my son! It's impossible to have that much love and not have it leak into all parts of your life|`|b9035adcbdf28a53a5a80e18a3dc49d7aa	I have always been a social person... but I do feel much happier now that I have a child, I was pretty happy with my life pre baby so it was a little weird to think I could actually enjoy life more. Watching a little person that is a part of you grow and thrive is so fulfilling. a different experience to enjoy :)|`|KNxs4PrZaa	its changed for sure, i dont have much of a night life or party life, but i certainly have a new purpose in life and am enjoying life much more with my daughter, she is my life and i love the mommy social life i have developed and the family outings that we have.|`|osusVJk0aa	i can i was an only child until last may i loved being the only child i was spoiled but sometimes i got a little lonely no that im over myself i find spending time with my little brother very exciting|`|DSZTruuqaa	Yeah, I suggest a mommy group.  Cheesy, I know, but a lot of women who feel the same way as you do!  Usually available through hospitals, community centers and churches...|`|OP8r4n5Qaa	unfortunatly my mother had me at 17 and it didnt stop her from partying at all...i was neglected so my grandmother took care of me from age 2 to 18...my mother is still an alcoholic to this day|`|5b3cd64667a391942de231867c44d64caa	Same here - it's great.

Cx5Zo7IIaa	Yes, any birth control that has only progesterone in it will not effect your milk supply. I'm on Micronor/Camilla.|`|OrKpKxkHaa	The minipill is it.

EUTRJqCsaa	it doesn't mean it's implantation bleeding. you could just be spotting.<br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  but if it is implantation then yes, it means you're pregnant. the embryo is implanting. hence why it's implantation bleeding.|`|l8ozbxpWaa	sometimes <br>   it means you are pregnantt<br>  but in this case it does not|`|FjGeKhY0aa	Only few women actually experience implantation bleeding and no, it doesn't mean that you're pregnant. There is a chance that egg won't stick or it won't continue to develop.|`|7add460ae24c9452ae87b5a99c5aa756aa	Well, if it is implantation bleeding, then yes, cause it is implanting the fetus in the lining of the uterus, therefore it can only be implantation bleeding.<br>  However, it will happen a week after you ovulate (roughly).  And its more than likely just your period!
ZSBZ83Dpaa	For running on the street, spank her little bottom, right there, and make it memorable (and don't worry about the tut-tuts from the do-gooders that may watch you doing it). For saying "no" all the time, spanking is not very effective. She is just testing your reaction and wnats your attention. Just ignore her, and the game will soon lose attraction.|`|ArYvBhkpaa	My mom would have whipped my ***.|`|SlBsJ3NRaa	This is going to get me a bunch of thumbs down...here it goes.<br>  <br>  If it was my child doing that, I would show him a video of someone getting hit by a car to let him see the seriousness of what he's doing. It is disturbing, but hopefully it'll get it through to him that he can be injured or killed by running in the street.<br>  <br>  * I used "he" and "him" because I'm referring to my children, who happen to be all boys.|`|DMhAPurkaa	I don t know if you live in a big city or rural, but I got help from my local police man.

She would have to hold my hand at all times near streets, and she wouldn't be allowed to play in the yard unless I was right there with her.  I would explain to her that when I could trust her again, she would be allowed to have her freedom back.<br>  <br>  It doesn't make sense to have Daddy spank her hours later.  And it doesn't make sense to spank for telling you "no."  You need to work on other strategies that don't involve spanking.<br>  <br>  Last summer, my daughters (who were then 3 and 5) were given permission to ride a few houses up the street in one direction and a few houses down the street in the other direction.  They knew the rule, and it was very clear.  One day, I saw that they had gone around the corner with some older kids.  I didn't need to spank them or scream at them.  I just reminded them of the rule and "grounded" them to our driveway for the next couple days.  Then, I let them try again to stay within the range of a few houses in either direction.  We haven't had a problem since.<br>  <br>  Instead of focusing on punishments, try to figure out ways to teach your daughter to behave appropriately.  In the meantime, *you* are responsible for her safety.|`|prqrQcd1aa	My daughter was 3 when she did this, as soon as I got to her I gave her a quick swat on the bottom, told her NO, and how she could get hurt by cars...She never did it again!<br>  I do not condone or condemn spanking... but i personally save it as a last resort that is done in cases like this, and i don't wait to do it, i do it right then and there when the incident happens.|`|jkDbDjcRaa	If my daughter ran into the street where she could get hurt, or worse, I would give her a slap on the a**, and not let her outside for a day.|`|45nSn7Rcaa	A child will do things they aren't supposed to do until they reach a limit they are not allowed to pass.  That means if she is telling you NO all the time then you aren't putting a limit.  She should never speak to you (her parents) that way.  You need to get tougher on her all the way around.  You need to make it clear what the expectations are and that she is to respect what you say.  If she does something wrong...then give her the consequence right then and there...no matter where you are.  No need for fear of being accused of child abuse or being embarrassed.  If you consistanty discipline your child and never give in, never argue and never accept her talking back then before you know it, there won't be these problems anymore.  <br>  <br>  As for the going out on the road thing...I don't know the circumstances of how it happened this time, but I'll tell you, when our kids were young they knew that they were not allowed passed a certain point on our property and if they forgot and went past it...we shouted their name and a loud stop and they stopped immediately because they knew our authoirity and tha when we said something we meant it...everytime.  You must have the control over your child (if for no other reason) than their safety...if they don't listen to your instructions on a normal basis, you can't expect them to listen to you about things like not going out on the road or stopping and coming back the second you call them.  You can do it, it needs to be done.  And yes, this time...she needs a spanking.|`|rdpZrBc9aa	How old is she?<br>  <br>  For something involving safety I think spanking (not beating) is justified.<br>  <br>  I use a child leash for my toddler.  That baby can MOVE! and he has a genius for knowing just when I have my hands full.|`|9mSIQA2Baa	I don't know if you were playing outside or what but if my daughter/son runs out into the street I take them inside and they aren't allowed to play outside the rest of the day.|`|jvW3a5GYaa	For running out into the street, spank her butt - it's quick and to the point. Then explain to her why the street isn't safe.|`|jCy0J2ueaa	I think that spanking should be a last resort. You can talk things out and tell her how dangerous running in the road is. We are not cave people we can use our words!|`|tBx1M0g9aa	um.....you can tell her no going outside for the day or...no candy or treats|`|7fa09a6411f35613b3aa8cfe6767d058aa	how old is katie|`|o1StMQeyaa	A punishment should be immediate, age-appropriate and related to the misdemeanour. Do you mean that she gets out of the house/garden to play in the street or that she runs onto the road while you are out walking? If Katie is a toddler, she doesn't have the ability to regulate her behaviour in this way and it is your responsibility to ensure that the house/garden are secure and that she holds hands or sits in the pusher while you are out.<br>  If Katie is over 4 years old, she also needs to be restrained (in pusher or holding hands) if she is trying to run on the road. If she is escaping from the house/garden, she is probably wanting to go out. Make it clear that she needs to wait for you before leaving the property. If she doesn't wait, the consequence should be along the lines of not being able to leave the house and/or garden for the morning/afternoon.|`|80aDsO21aa	Spanking?! Seriously?! She's a baby for goodness sakes! How on Earth can you sit there spank her for saying no? That doesn't break your heart when she cries? That's horrible. I'm 19 years old and the only time I got smacked was when I was 6 when I said the word ****, but it was on my hand not on my bottom! From age 7-14 I was spanked/hit/beaten and to be honest with you it made me retaliate even more. So, if you want your daughter to grow up with a vendetta against you, be my guest spank your little heart out but let me tell you something if this continues over stupid little things like saying no, she WILL grow up to dislike you, I'd bet my last penny on that. But, for her running into the street you should take tv time away continue to take toys away and not give her treats but for the love of human kind don't spank her. Think about it, when she gets older maybe around 6 or 7 years old and you put her in school and you spank her and it flies out of her mouth at school, the school will call CPS, wouldn't that just suck?|`|LwbwMFX9aa	today when  I was picking my daughter up from pre school she ran into the parking lot, I whooped her butt. Ive told her and told her about roads and parking lots<br>  she doesnt listen to reason, she will listen to my hand on her hiney<br>  <br>  I wouldnt spank her for saying no, thats normal.<br>  That warrants time out or taking away toys and remember her being punished hours after she did the bad deed doesnt serve any purpose, young children don't retain info to remember like we do to an extent<br>  <br>  if she needs to be punished, YOU do at the time she misbehaves|`|sp1x3ZUAaa	I read two answers saying they would spank their kids butt, and I felt ILL.<br>  It's just my opinion, but I think hurting your child to try and "teach them a lesson" is wrong!<br>  Don't take anger out upon your child, don't turn concern into violence!<br>  You do not need to hurt someone, a PERSON, with feelings and thoughts and memories, to teach them something like this!!<br>  You cannot groom your child, she is not a tree... Will you hit her when she is 6-8? 8-10? A TEENAGER!? she will be the same person with the same feelings.... it doesn't matter that she is 4 now.<br>  I think you should try to explain to her, instead of yelling or hitting.<br>  I know you are concerned and worried that she is running around where cars and bikes can be, but please..|`|W85IdGzvaa	Personally, I think that calls for a spanking. Boo and hiss at me all you nay-sayers want.

3w7VztEWaa	You should only eat fish maybe once a week. don't eat too much sugars...For the most part you can eat whatever. try to stay healthy. the healthier you are the healthier the baby<br>  <br>  I'm naming my baby Noah tooo=D|`|GvuMyMFOaa	When you're pregnant, eating for two means many things, and one of them is steering clear of foods that pose health risks for you and your baby.<br>  <br>  While your favorite dishes and drinks may seem safe at first glance, a closer look reveals potential dangers. Here's what to avoid when you're pregnant, and why.<br>  <br>  Swordfish, shark, tilefish, king mackerel, limit canned albacore tuna fish. These large fish harbor higher levels of methylymercury, a metal detrimental to a growing child's brain and nervous system. Pregnant and nursing women may safely eat up to 6 ounces of albacore ("white') tuna fish as part of their weekly total limit of 12 ounces of seafood low in mercury, says the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA). This also includes salmon, shrimp, canned light tuna, pollock, and catfish.<br>  <br>  Fish caught in rivers, lakes, streams, or any other body of water. Recreational anglers may hook fish contaminated with bacteria or chemicals. Check the safety of fish from your favorite fishing grounds with your local health department.<br>  <br>  Raw or undercooked meat, poultry, seafood (like raw oysters, clams, sushi), and eggs (including eggs in cookie dough and cake batter). Undercooked animal foods may contain a variety of bacteria and viruses. Use a meat thermometer to determine doneness of meat and poultry, and cook eggs until they are no longer runny.<br>  <br>  Hot dogs and luncheon meats, including deli ham, turkey, bologna, and salami -- unless they have been reheated until steaming hot. These foods are prone to Listeria monocytogenes, a bacteria that causes listeriosis, which may result in miscarriage, stillbirth, or other serious health problems.<br>  <br>  Unpasteurized dairy foods, including some milk and certain cheeses, such as Brie, feta, Camembert, Roquefort, blue-veined, "queso blanco," "queso fresco," and Panela; refrigerated pates or meat spreads; and refrigerated smoked seafood, such as salmon, trout, whitefish, cod, tuna, or mackerel (most often labeled as "nova-style," "lox," "kippered," "smoked," or "jerky"). These foods may contain harmful levels of listeria bacteria. Refrigerated smoked seafood is safe when it's part of a cooked dish, like casseroles.<br>  <br>  Unpasteurized juices, such as cider purchased from roadside stands, at farms, or in stores. These products are prone to germs, including E. coli. Check the label to be sure juice is pasteurized.<br>  <br>  Raw vegetable sprouts, including alfalfa, clover, radish, and mung bean. The FDA says sprouts are not a good idea for anyone, never mind pregnant women who are more susceptible to the health effects of the germs sprouts possess.<br>  <br>  Herbal supplements and teas. Herbs are natural, but herbal products have not been studied enough to recommend them during pregnancy.<br>  <br>  Alcohol. Beer, wine, and spirits rob developing cells of oxygen, making normal development impossible. The effects of alcohol on intellectual prowess are irreparable. According to the March of Dimes, there is no known safe level for alcohol consumption in pregnancy.<br>  <br>  Tap water in undeveloped countries. Drink bottled water to avoid bacteria and viruses.<br>  <br>  Certain foods that cause food allergy. Depending on your family history, your child may be at risk for developing food allergies. Avoiding foods including peanuts and peanut products during pregnancy (and nursing) may reduce allergy risk in susceptible children. Before you make any changes to your diet, speak with a licensed health care professional about your child's risk for allergy and consult with a registered dietitian knowledgeable about food allergy.|`|RjdrO7DVaa	no unpasturized cheese ... such as goat, blue, gorgonzola ... if you're unsure if its pasturized or not .. then dont eat it ... unpasturized cheeses have bacteria in them.<br>  <br>  no cold cuts from the deli unless they are served at 160 degrees or more.  cold cuts have bacteria that a fetus cant fight<br>  <br>  no salmon or swordfish...too much mercury|`|OCTvfDsxaa	Avocado/they have bad toxins for pregnancy.|`|FpwRrOwxaa	No Ssmoking, Drinking, don't eat avacodo and try to lay it light on the fast foods. <br>  <br>  I like both names.|`|22hX0vDNaa	no alcohol or smoking<br>  <br>  thats all I know X3

You will be nervous until that little baby arrives.  You will forget all that as soon as you see him or her for the first time.  Your life will change forever.  You think you love your gf now, you two will share the most special bond of having a beautiful baby.  Just make sure you two will be there for eachother as you owe it to the baby.<br>  <br>  Times can get frustrating as parents.  You know her as a gf but some times couples disagree at many things such as parenting skills, discipline, etc. Just remember to communicate and work things out.|`|J4hOL3oLaa	It is a scarey situation when its a new experience.

Its normal to be scared.<br>  <br>  You will most likely stop being scared after the baby is born, because it is the time when your wife is not pregnant anymore, and the time you get over waiting for this event, after it actually happens, the time you start settling to be a dad.|`|tudgm0S1aa	your worries are all perfectly natural, try to control your emotions and not allow your emotions to control you.

I thought it looked soo precious, and then there was no doubt she was a girl.<br>  I think socially, seeing what the other girls are doing, and honor your parents, and listen if they have reasons for this or that age.<br>  Some religions have guidelines for this, and they are just trying to insure your purity so things don t happen before they should.|`|4sjW4Ig5aa	No sooner than 7th grade, and then only after having been taught how.

One took the time to show her daughter how, she looks very cute and age appropriate. The other just let her daughter pick out her make up and have at it. The poor child picked out hooker blue eyeshadow and went to town with it. Don't get me started on the eyeliner. It was sad.|`|O1m2PaMjaa	Whenever they are mature enough to know when and where to apply it to themselves. I'd say 13-14. It's a good time for them to learn how to put it on, and get feedback from not only parents but friends too. Also at an earlier age they are more prone to listen to you about how much to put on and tone it down when they start looking like a hooker or clown.|`|pg3fmjlIaa	well, i didn't start wearing makeup until 7th grade. but i only wore like a little pink eyeshadow that was hardly visible. i starting wearing eyeliner on my upper and lower lids in the middle of 8th grade. i don't know if this would influence anything, but i'm in a professional dance program, so i needed to know how to apply makeup when i was in 6th grade. so in order to answer your question, i'd say probably around 8th grade. but there's nothing wrong with wearing makeup to special occasions, you just need to make sure you're not wearing too much. if it helps,m im 14 and 1/2 years old.|`|tqqhXMagaa	My parents started letting me wear make-up  halfway through my freshmen year of high school.... so I was 14.

OrKpKxkHaa	I have the same issue....almost. My friends werent so blunt about it but they didnt invite me out as much and I kind of ended up off on my own. Singlle people dont want to wait while you get the stroller out of the trunk. They don't want to make a pit stop at the restroom so you can change a diaper. And they definitly do not want to stop and look at baby clothes. Since I had my daughter young (18) none of my friends were moms yet and now I even have a hard time connecting with my daughters friend's parents at school because they are all in their 40's and I am only 25. It's tough but you find out who really loves you. My sister is my best friend and we do everything together. Good luck!|`|jG8b3Mz0aa	Does any of your friends have children? If not, that's why it seems they're blowing you off. Now you have entered into "Mommy World" it's almost like when you're married, you either have married friends or single friends. It does suck for awhile, but that tells you they aren't much of a friend if they blow you off once you become a mother. Don't worry so much about making new friends, it is hard we know but worry about the little one. Let potential friends come to you. Also try networking on like Facebook, Myspace, Cafemom, things like that. Try having playdates for your daughter, so you at least have something in common with the other mom. Best of luck.|`|Y16olPxlaa	Parks. Like with other mums.<br>  Or study like teaching or whatever to work at a kindy and you  get to meet other mums there as well.<br>  <br>  Meeting other mums is helpful because you can share you experiences and swap advice.

8yTP3jO8aa	Breast milk production works on a supply and demand system.  If you try to mess with the demand, you may mess with your supply as well, especially since supply doesn't start to become fully regulated until around 6 weeks.<br>  <br>  Rather than thinking that she has her days and nights mixed up, have you considered that she *has* to nurse more at night because she's not nursing enough during the day?  If she is sleeping pretty good between feeds at night, it's probably not a mix up issue, but a nutritional issue.  <br>  <br>  What happens if you offer to feed her more during the day?  Maybe offer a feed every 2 1/2 hours, or every 2 hours during the day.  Obviously you aren't going to force her to eat, but you're giving her the opportunity to do so.|`|427abcdfcd8e012fe37537ef1426e40faa	It will probably change on its own over time, but there's nothing wrong with encouraging it a little.  Try to offer every 2 hours during the day.  That may encourage her to increase her daytime frequency, thus decreasing the nighttime frequency.  Now, I probably wouldn't wake her up to offer every 2 hours, but that's your decision.  <br>  <br>  In the evening after your 16-month-old goes to bed, try to tank up your newborn.  Just keep holding her and nursing her as much as she'll eat for a couple hours, if necessary.  Then try putting her down and see if she'll do a bit of a longer stretch.  <br>  <br>  Also, try to keep the house at its normal noise/activity level during the day to encourage her to be awake more.  At night, keep things calm and quiet.  If she's sleeping in a crib, maybe play some white noise.  I think too much silence is startling to babies since they were used to all that noise in the womb.  You also might want to try co-sleeping if you're not already b/c she may sleep better, and you may get more sleep since you won't have to get out of bed to nurse her.<br>  <br>  My oldest two are 17 months apart, so I know what you're going through right now.  There was quite a while where I thought I was going to lose my mind if I didn't get some sleep.  :-)  Good luck to you!  Hope your little one gets her days/nights figured out soon!|`|5wmrZEQ9aa	My baby had her days and nights flip flopped, too.  We got her schedule switched by 6 weeks.  <br>  Feed her every 2 hours during the day, even if she doesn't cry to eat.  Or cluster feed at night.  After 4 pm, feed every two hours until "bedtime".  Establish a morning feed and bedtime feed.  The best way to help baby differentiate between day and night is after all her day feeds, play with her for about half an hour before she goes back to sleep.  Don't let her go to sleep.  My baby would fall asleep nursing, and I would have to wake her up after she was done and try to keep her awake while nursing.  After the play time, she would go down for a nap.  After the bedtime feed, I would put her right to sleep without play time.  It helps them know the difference.  At each night feed, put her right to sleep.  You may try swaddling at night also.  We swaddled our baby at night, and it helped her sleep longer.  Babies will get that "falling" feeling and throw their arms and legs out and wake themselves up.  If you keep up the schedule, she should eventually fall into the schedule naturally.|`|1k6UUC8qaa	four weeks old is really young pretty much they feed on demand.   Your children are very young and all of you including you need to adjust. Its not easy believe me I know.  The little one will start sleeping through the night soon you'll see remember with your 16 month old.  If your baby will let you without crying maybe you can stretch out the time between feeding at night even if you have to play so that she starts to understand every time she opens he eyes doesn't mean shes going to be fed. Remember Breast Feeding in comforting to them and they want to be close sometimes they drink small amounts but more often so maybe if you extend it by 15 min then 5 more and so on pretty soon you buy an hour or two.  Keep in mind it all temporary and I know you are tired but try to enjoy these precious moments with your baby when she's so tiny we know how fast it goes and then its gone for ever.|`|0ca6f6ce6afa279f3ccc449197fd3d7daa	this is what my baby does too..he'll be 4 weeks on Sunday. i hope it gets easier for me too..<br>  good luck!|`|WKxi3gWBaa	dont change it she will change it on her own.... my daughter slowed down big tim by 3 months and by 4 she it was sad that she didnt seem inetested anymore.. it was heartbreaking then i had to start giving her a bottle here and there and by 5 months she was done by her choice... it will get better my daughters pattern changed so much the first month and 2nd month|`|CvESLNnkaa	should change on its own as her stomach gets larger and she takes more in at one time the longer she will go with out waking up at night.  Some babies just do this sooner than others.  Good luck.  2 young kids on newborn and a toddler will keep you busy.|`|ArDBlPKYaa	I know I may get raked over the coals for this, but by the time my baby was 4 weeks old, I had him on what I called a "flexible schedule", where he nursed every 3 hours in the day, and every 4 hours at night.<br>  You want to be careful that your baby is crying in hunger pains, but I think it's ok to encourage more sleeping and less eating at night, as much as possible.  By the time mine was 6 weeks, he was sleeping 11pm-6am through the night, and sleeping 12 hours a night 3 months.  He NEVER cries in his crib now at 1 year, and he's a normal-sized, very happy, well-rested baby!<br>  Most babies' schedules are flip-flopped when they're born, as they often sleep during the day in the womb when you're "walking them to sleep", and are awake at night while it's still in there and they have more room to move around.  In other words, it's ok to encourage that schedule to be turned around so that they are more awake in the day and understand that night time is for sleep.  You are not torturing your baby by doing this - it's easier on everyone, believe me!<br>  Good luck :)
BNCpLcLoaa	Its a very cool bed but I would be worried:-<br>  <br>  A) There is nothing stopping her falling out,<br>  <br>  B) The bigger the bed, the easier to get lost under the covers and panic.<br>  <br>  C) less play space in her room. <br>  <br>  The bed my 3yr old daughter has is fantastic, I got it from ikea and it grows with the child.

5a1c8253181a8adf5c06c0040d8f981eaa	Those are all questions you should ask the doctor that diagnosed you.  It sounds like you should have the surgery done sooner rather than later since you have some risk factors.

w5uHiNcoaa	What I would suggest is to mix whole cows milk to the formula, until it is just cows milk.<br>  <br>  So, for the first few days, make up formula as normal and when you put it into the beaker, leave out some and add cows milk. Gradually add more cows and less made up formula.<br>  <br>  Cows milk does taste different to formula, so that is the way I got my son to make the switch. It worked really well for us.|`|cen8SIssaa	Whenever i switched my son from breastmilk to formula / formula to different brands if i had to/ from formula to milk i would always do one ounce at a time and increase the milk by another ounce every 3-4 days but if your son seems really picky then do one ounce per week. and it shouldnt take no longer than about a month or so. You shouldnt have any problem doing it like that.<br>  <br>  Great luck to you!!|`|kM8dCoYqaa	My son is 17 months and still on a powereed soy based formula. I didn't know it was a problem. My pediatrician didn't seem to think it was a problem.  I don't think it's that big of an issue. They do make formula for 12-24 months. I am going to start weining though, and I though I would do it by slowly adding a bit of milk and work up to it.<br>  good luck|`|o1hvya8zaa	My 16 month old just stopped drinking stage 2 formula. She wouldn't drink milk either but I stopped trying and now 4 months later I tried again and she likes it so I took her off of the formula. Maybe you can let me have his bottle a while longer.....|`|rdpZrBc9aa	Mix formula with whole milk.  Start with mostly formula, then every day or so use a higher proportion of milk.  Eventually he'll catch on.|`|FHmtAMLZaa	What about growen up milk?i think it from 12 to 36months|`|AFi5kTiEaa	I would also try mixing the milk with the formula and over time lessen the formula so he gets used of the taste.<br>  <br>  If he is using a bottle, have you tried offering the milk in a cup?  He might be associating the formula and the bottle and think only the formula should be in the bottle???????????
DSZTruuqaa	Teens with a support system should try to use cloth. Diapers are the most harmful thing that we throw away and we need to look at the environmental responsibility we have.  That being said, if you don't have a support system, you have a lot on your plate and grace should be extended.  Go for disposables.  If the money is tight, as it probably is, go to <br>  www.huggies.com<br>  and<br>  www.pampers.com<br>  For coupons and free give a ways.  Use the coupons when diapers go on sale and you get an amazing deal.<br>  Good luck.|`|EyKJ737daa	I hope this one is a serious question as your other questions leave a lot to be desired!<br>  <br>  If you are referring to teen mothers using cloth or disposables on a new baby, then really I guess it's up to the mother because ultimately if she uses cloth on a baby, she's the one that will probably end up washing them.  If daddy is in the picture, dads tend to be a little clumsy when it comes to doing up cloth nappies so I would be leaning more towards using disposables on the baby rather than cloth.|`|33h5R8nTaa	disposable there quick easy and not as smelly.|`|b9035adcbdf28a53a5a80e18a3dc49d7aa	Better for teens? well, teens should be using the toilet by now... unless your child has a disability.

So he is not trying to be malicious he may be finding your reaction funny.  Which is why when he does it you should place him on the floor and walk away.  Don't give any emotion into it, walk a few feet away from him he may find it no longer benefits him to act this way.  He is not however, being an evil child he's still a baby.|`|FLpMShKNaa	Oh, yeah its normal, my son loves to "pat" me and yank on my hair, like yours, he is trying to play/be funny. But I am as clueless as you as how to deal with it.|`|qW5jLIJtaa	This is completely normal!  Now that might not be the most comfortable thing in the world for YOU, but it's normal.|`|UriE3wN6aa	yeah its def. normal!!|`|chiFCUC5aa	my son does the same thing, today he was even throwing toys at my husbands head. My pediatrician said its normal and all infants go through it. He said to either ignore it completely or if it only gets worse to put the baby down and turn away for 30 seconds eventually he will associate hitting with not getting attention. He said at such a yougn age they dont understand no and yes and often dont realize they have to listen when you say no as they get older.  i know that ignoring it doesnt work so i tell him no and put him down and that seems to work.....hopefully he'll get it soon
bmoCpcdraa	find it gross.....waite tell he craps his pants all the time when he is out of diappers. when he is 3,4,and 5, are you going to keep him in diappers tell he is 5? you are the parent so, wipe his butt and clean up after him, use a potty chair or hold him above the tolit each time,    i hope i helped|`|Yn6pM2Xyaa	one word: consistency!<br>  <br>  Potty trained dd in 3 days because I stuck to my guns.<br>  <br>  Oh wait.. two words: consistency and patience!<br>  <br>  they will definitely have accidents from time to time.|`|uJnvFKyLaa	NONE of our 4 would touch a potty chair.  I found that the absolute best thing is to make sure that they see everyone in the house going. Seriously, no more shut bathroom doors for a while and when he asks what you are doing or seems curious explain that big girls and boys use the toliet. Also, you're going to need to go out on a limb and take the diaper off. When mine were ready we would take the diaper off during non busy time in the day and evening and set a timer for roughly 20-30 min, every half an hour or so we try to go potty, unless we've gone recently. It works.|`|QIDhVAjjaa	the best way to teach a 2 year old is a potty chair is it more gross than changing diapers?  i would get one and set it in front of the tv and put a cartoon in for the 2 year old or set a table with some toys by it for them to play with while they wait to go.  Award them with toys or something like that when they do go.|`|9P8WJVNsaa	One thing that really stuck with my son is the Elmo potty video.  The songs are really cute and he remembered them.

165WRAJdaa	I agree with you.

They just have a preference.  Like it or not it is part of the process.  Would you rather be placing a daughter with a family who had stated they preferred a boy?   Part of the adoption process, whether someone adopts through an agency, through DSS or even internationally is to state their "child desired" preferences.  For some this represents gender preferences, disability limitations, age groups, racial or cultural preferences.  <br>  <br>  If you are not comfortable with the match then hold out and find someone else.  Simple enough.  Anyone you deal with though is going to have their stated preferences in some way shape or form.|`|yDWcYXl5aa	Every parent at some point of pregnancy has desires to have either a boy or a girl.  Some like myself would be so grateful from God to be able to have any child (I'm almost placed with foster to adopt, I'm praying & have adopted a beautiful little boy 17 months ago).  <br>  <br>  I think that many, many adoptive parents go into the adoption agencies, and since they pay money to adopt, they get particular.  I am so against agencies, because of their money issues!  <br>  <br>  There are unrealistic people out there who want to adopt.  There are also good people who want to adopt, and I know this, because I believe I'm one of them.  There are people like myself who actually honor open adoption, and there are people out there who actually are honest with their children who are adopted, and don't feel threatened that their child seeks out their first parents, who are just that:  the child's first parents.  It's not that as an adoptive parent I'm second.  I'm the adoptive parent.  Without my son's first parents, he wouldn't be here, and I feel so blessed with the opportunity to raise him.  I had made the decision before he was born, that no matter what happened during the pregnancy, I was going to love him, nurture him, and take care of him, even if she decided to keep him I was still asking to be a member of his adopted family, just like his first parents are extended family to me.  <br>  <br>  You have every right to pick your child's adoptive parents.  You have the right to know that the adoptive parents have the morals you'd like them to have, and to know that they aren't selfish in many ways.  Quite frankly, you could make the stipulation that they love to visit the ocean, or that they love dogs.  Good luck, no matter what you decide to do.  I also hope you ask the adoptive parents for open adoption so you can have future contact with them.|`|8Qxb7OZOaa	"IF U ARE SO DESPERATE to have a baby....why would you make demands like that?" <br>  <br>  Probably for the same reason why you seem to not want to get your crap together......Adoption isn't about the childs needs nor wants...Its always about the Adults and their character defects.<br>  <br>  No....you were not wrong stopping the adoption but you really need to work on your issues....For the sake of the children.<br>  <br>  Good luck and keep the kids together.....its about them remember.|`|AgzRyqWTaa	covering all grounds and wanting information about this and that and what if and never do this and so on are safe and precautious ways to deal with what will be a life time choice.[if you had the power to choice a boy or a girl before you got pregnant would you not choose]|`|hzgFAJv0aa	Yuck. <br>  <br>  The whole situation sounds bad from all ends.<br>  <br>  They are being sexist. <br>  <br>  I feel sorry for the children.
GGH0HVdvaa	Pay for it but then don't let your son have any until he pays you back for them. And he would have to get that money by doing chores or something.|`|AA12041870	I wouldn't pay for them.  Legally, you don't have to because the child isn't old enough to make the order, and the person he/she ordered from should have known that.|`|ozATw7s0aa	Your kid needs to work of the money or pay you lol...|`|jkDbDjcRaa	Did the child say they had permission to buy?<br>  Still, that's not right on the part of the Mother who let the child order the cookies.<br>  <br>  I'm not sure if I would pay or not.<br>  It would depend on how the ordering came about.|`|JgDRKLuLaa	Just take it out of her allowance if you're really that concerned. Srsly though she's 11 and she wanted cookies. Give her a break.|`|lcxyOS7uaa	Pay it, and then have him work it off.|`|c61c4f44c63edf2ae9007329580c8a0faa	Just explain to the girls mother that you were not aware of the purchase and your son who is 11 didn't have permission to order them and she can't make you pay for them because that is the law.  Then explain to your son that in the future he can't purchase anything without your express permission.  Sometimes kids do things out of impulse.|`|NGJCUYeraa	Either make your son pay for it or pay for it and then make your son "earn" the money back for you by doing extra chores. But even if you do decide not to pay, don't blame the mother of the girl scout for letting her daughter sell the cookies to your son, it's just not her job. Plus it is entirely possible that her daughter sold them to him at school, in which case she would have had no way of knowing whether or not you were okay with it.|`|w2kofruFaa	Pay it, but then make the child re-pay for the cookies, whether it be doing extra chores, taking it out of his allowance, or whatnot, and then I would still not let him eat any of them because he bought them without my permission.<br>  <br>  You don't want him growing up thinking that's okay, because eventually a $10.50 box of cookies will turn into a $500 game system on your credit card.|`|mfBkH3qtaa	You should pay. I sold girl scout cookies and there was a lot of people that did that to me. It was very upsetting. But you should pay and make your son pay that money back. My mom would make me do chores. And that would be a week of chores. My mom would also more than likely take away my phone and computer privileges for a week or until i payed her off.<br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  EDIT<br>  <br>  I so agree with Michelle. I still wouldn't let him have any of the cookies.|`|066d5c6e62f25800bb79891ca8d7cfffaa	Girl Scout cookies cost $4 a box how is it possible to "owe"  $10.50?

I would  make it a point to tell her when they deliver the cookies that he did not have permission so he will be working it of. Maybe she will think twice the next time.<br>  Its an opportunity for your son to learn to be responsible for his actions. Make him do everything you would do in a day, a load of laundry(towel are always safe, pick up clutter, dust a room, wash the dishes.|`|cfdaafe195dbe3394c7aba2b49ed9576aa	My daughter is a Girl Scout and has on rare occasion sold to friends of hers (about the same age as your son).  If they have the money, what's the difference between purchasing from a Girl Scout vs. going to the store and buying a box of cookies?  If you don't want your son buying cookies, or food, or anything without your permission, that's an issue between the two of you, it's not another adult's responsibility to figure out what the rules of your family are.  If you're not punishing him, I'm guessing it's not a big deal to you, so I don't understand why you'd even be upset with the GS or her mom.<br>  <br>  Would you go to the store and complain to them if he'd gone in and purchased cookies off the shelf?  It's not as if he ordered a huge amount of cookies (if he'd pre-ordered a case, I could see being upset the GS & her mom didn't double check, but $10.50 isn't really that much for an 11 year old to spend around here).|`|1B91qtNQaa	You should pay. It bites but make your 11 year old work for the money he owes you. Look at it as a great lesson for your son to learn. <br>  <br>  The girl scout troop shouldn't have to suffer because of it.<br>  <br>  EDIT:<br>  <br>  A friend of mine had this problem selling on ebay. I know it is a little different because you can't tell how old someone is through a computer screen but she had someone win an item and then not pay for it because supposedly her child won the item and she didn't know it. I say supposedly because when she fought for the mother to at least pay the fees she was out to ebay she was told that this has happened before. <br>  <br>  My point is that the 11 year old is old enough to know whether or not he should be ordering stuff. If that is what he wants to spend his money on then you should let him.|`|FFv8i4aYaa	Well if the lady knows that they are 11 all they are interested in is selling cookies.<br>  So it depends if you want to spend the money you can just go to a general store and get some cookies for cheaper if your son really wants them that bad|`|i2fEIxbYaa	I would tell her that you where not aware of the purchase and that your 11 year old son didn't ask you so you do not want the purchase.Because if you do buy it then more then likely your son is going to think that it is okay to keep doing so.|`|86d6ceaf091a87fdb16c07d5c93ed356aa	Make the child pay them.

9tNr1RMfaa	You poor thing! I have been there, my son and I passed thrush back and forth for several months. The Nystatin worked for him but did absolutely NOTHING for me. <br>  <br>  Contrary to what some people are saying, I did put monistat on my nipples a couple of times. He was six months old at the time, and it was our third thrush infection. I did not want to do this, but my nipples were burning so badly and I was miserable.  Basically, I waited until he was done breastfeeding and I rinsed them and put some monistat on. I rinsed right before the next feed and then reapplied it when he was done feeding. The doctor did not seem to think it was a problem, but I tried not to do it very often. The good thing is that it took care of my infection, so I did not have to do it for very long. <br>  <br>  There are some natural things you can try as well. Check your local health food store for some good plain yogurt. Try to stay away from commercial brands and buy the one that is local to your area (I have noticed Whole Foods usually carries one local brand). Make sure it is plain! You can apply the yogurt to your nipples before breastfeeding your baby. It won't harm his stomach. Then apply some to your nipples after breastfeeding and let your nipples "air out" a bit before putting your bra/shirt back on. <br>  <br>  ((Kefir might also work))<br>  <br>  You can also try a vinegar rinse: 1T. white, distilled vingear/1C. water. The vinegar rinse is also good for baby's diaper area (if the thrush is on his bum).<br>  <br>  Motherlove Diaper Rash & Thrush Relief:<br>  <a href="http://www.motherlove.com/product_diaper_rash_relief.php" rel="nofollow">http://www.motherlove.com/product_diaper...</a><br>  <br>  Motherlove Nipple Cream:<br>  <a href="http://www.motherlove.com/product_nipple_cream.php" rel="nofollow">http://www.motherlove.com/product_nipple...</a><br>  <br>  **note: I never tried the Motherlove Thrush Cream, but the Motherlove Nipple Cream is FABULOUS. I am sure the Thrush cream is also fabulous. You might be able to find it at your local Whole Foods (ours carries Motherlove products)|`|EyKJ737daa	Oh sweetie, you poor thing.  Well here in Australia we use something called Daktarin.  Works fabulous but I don't know what the equivalent brand is where you are.  You could also try taking some paracetamol for yourself about half an hour before you feed.  May be enough to take the edge off the pain for you.  You can also use what we have here in Australia called Lansinoh (in a purple tube) for cracked, bleeding and sore nipples.  It can be used before and after breastfeeding and is totally safe.  Use it as often as you like.

Good luck and all the very best of wishes.<br>  <br>  Edit: Just remembered too, on completion of nursing your son, hand express a tiny amount and rub it over your nipple and allow to air dry.  The antibodies in your breastmilk will also help heal your nipples too. xx  You might also want to try and cut down on your sugar intake as any thrush is a yeast infection and yeast infections FEED on sugar!  Forgot to mention that earlier.  Good luck and all the best.|`|1k6UUC8qaa	don't use monistat  you don't want to put this in your babys mouth just use the medicine the doctor prescribed and maybe see your obgyn as well.  you can try pumping but make sure he is latching correctly  not to the nipple but to the brown circle around it the Ariela he shouldn't be latching to the nipple to do this squeeze the brown circle around the nipple and make sure that's where he latches if he goes for the nipple put your little finger on the side of his mouth to break suction and try again
AA10339139	feed them fruits and veggies, drink lots of vitamin c. clean door knobs and phones. use lots of tissues and hand santitizers. kids are kids, they are going to get sick sometimes.  you can protect yourself by taking a flu shot and washing your hands often, don't place them around your nose or eyes. also, if possible, i know that some kids can have flu shots. that would help.|`|aslEz1JEaa	what do you mean by "Day Home"?|`|bmoCpcdraa	i would spray lysol on everthing and clean toys with bleach water and take vit. c, and serve lots of fluids like orange juice .you can also make sure the parents show you prof of flue shots before you except thier children,from  now on ,give them fresh fruits, and you must keep the place clean or you could deal with alot like, flu.s , colds head lice, virouses , chicken pop's, pink eye. etc.        i hope i helped

7lmtBhdMaa	She's old enough for you to reason with her. When you put her to bed tell her she is to sleep there all night and in the morning she can come wake u up. If she showes up in the middle of the night take her back to her bed and u go to yours. It should take a few nights but she'll get the idea if you keep taking her back to her room. If she's back in your room in 10 minutes it may be that you should get het attention by a swat on the a$$ and put her back.|`|zXCFGPhOaa	What time does she go to bed? Tell her you know she is lonely, but she has to sleep in her own bed because that is her bed and you and dad, have their own bed and they sleep together because they are husband and wife! She may understand that better. Reason with her, spend some time with her before bed, and then after that she has had her time with you, and she needs to sleep. Maybe, the dog could sleep in her bed? That may help her? I would also set a time for her that she can get out of bed if it gets to the worst.|`|62fa2d0c6e8de6507e574cf4131634dfaa	Tell her that if she stays in her own room all night, that tomorrow you will do something special with her....play a special game, do a special project, bake cupcakes. Try that for 3 or 4 days. Then show her a calendar and tell her, "We will cross off the days that you stay in your room,and at the end of a week, we will do xxxxxx".(wharever would please her) Go to the skating rink, aquarium, children'szoo, chuckie cheeze,toy store...whatever would please her. Make a big deal of her being a big girl. Put a light in her room. Praise her big time every night she stays in her own bed. Good luck .If she comes in because of anxiety, leave a sleeping bag on the floor next to you and let her lay there for 10 minutes while you hold her hand. Then tell her to go back to her own bed, She is six, not 2, so unless she has some real anxiety issues, perhaps this will work. Good luck|`|AA11537580	what time does she go to bed, can you keep her up 1/2 hour longer to see if that helps?<br>  if she gets up just tell her to go to her own bed if she comes back tell her she won't get to do something(watch TV, play outside, ride her bike, something she loves to do) the next day|`|QIDhVAjjaa	sounds like she isn't lonely she is propbably scared but to embarrassed to admit it.  I'd get a tv in her room and put a half and hour cartoon tape in and let her watch it and tell her her stuffed animals will protect her to and get her a nightlite.  It helped for me when i was young.|`|aKaRc13Gaa	i would try and tire her out b4 she goes to sleep then putting her in her room and kind of stay there for 5 minutes and she should be alseep|`|fvgVOxy1aa	give her tokens that allowed her to stay in bed with you (1-3 a week or what ever you think fits) and if she dosnt go over her limit per week or month give her a prize (candy, stay up late, small toy, ext) then keep it up till shes comfortable in her own bed|`|jcEtRUVZaa	This is more for younger kids but I think it may still work:<br>  <br>  How to Get a Baby, Toddler or Child to Fall Asleep<br>  <a href="http://www.ehow.com/ehow_4767974_baby-toddler-child-fall-asleep.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.ehow.com/ehow_4767974_baby-to...</a>|`|TK03jZTuaa	OK. firstly you need to tell her that she can no longer sleep in your bed, then enforce it.<br>  <br>  If she comes to you at night, allow her to lie down with her pillow beside your bed, NOT in it. Let her lie so you can reach out your hand and touch her if necessary to reassure her.<br>  <br>  Do NOT give her a mattress. Let it be uncomfortable for her. Remember, our aim is to get her back into her own bed. After a few nights on a hard floor with no padding she will start to realise that her bed is the next best option. <br>  <br>  It will work if you do not waver. I wish you well.

bmoCpcdraa	try to change her class, you need to go to school with her a few times and have fun and smile alot, i hope i helped ....|`|6RGnG1ukaa	This normal. Ask the teacher is you stay for a while just to watch her, and to get used to playing and learning and having fun. Before you leave tell her that you will back soon, and to have fun. Most children go through this. It will get better as she gets older. <br>  <br>  Last year when my daughter first started school their was this little girl crying her eyes out. Come to find out this girl didn't go to pre-k. My daughter went up to her and said "Don't cry, your mom always comes back for you at the end of the day," my daughter did go to pre-k so she knew what to expect. It was cute and it made my heart melt. Since that day they have been best friends.|`|Plq0BGSgaa	alot of kids go thru this<br>  <br>  you just have to be patient with her.<br>  <br>  ask to stay for a while before you leave her<br>  <br>  <br>  dont just drop her off<br>  <br>  <br>  play with stuff in her classroom and convince her this place is really fun and cool<br>  <br>  <br>  maybe even have lunch with her some days out of the week<br>  <br>  her teacher shouldnt have said that.<br>  <br>  its their job to make going to school fun<br>  <br>  its her job to teach and show kids how great school is<br>  <br>  <br>  she shouldnt imply that your daughter is a bit of a problem<br>  <br>  <br>  thats not fair<br>  <br>  meghan's obviously just attached to her mamma.<br>  <br>  and that is NOT a bad thing|`|TJezsCkHaa	I had the same problem!<br>  <br>  Try to stay with her in class fr a week or so as volunteering,then start leaving the classroom gradually(first 5 minutes,then 15,and keep checking back in a sneaky way to see her reaction from far).Then after you get back in,tell her how big she was when you had to go to use the restroom(for example).By the time gets longer,she won't feel that you are not there anymore.|`|AA12035186	Ok. First I can't believe your daughters teacher hasn't had this happen before. This is extremely common especially at this age.  She should have had some ideas on how to make the situation easier for Meghan and you.  She needs to work with Meghan to make her feel like she is a part of the group.  To ease her mind about you leaving, maybe you could laminate a picture of yourself/your family so she can have it to look at during the day and reassure her that you are coming back.  The teacher should reinforce this.  She should also let Meghan have her time to regroup after you leave and give her the choice of joining the group when she is ready- my guess is she tries to just drag her in and says "Mom's gone- get over it" which will stress her more.  You are not crazy people.  This is something that happens all the time. You might also concider that there may be a personality conflict involved.  Your daughter might not feel comfortable in this school or with this teacher.  She is a normal child though- and you are a normal , caring mom.  In fact, her anxiety shows that she cares for you and wants to be with you.  You are most likely the most important thing in her life right now and she just doesn't want to be without you for a second.  It's the schools job to open up new experiences for her and help her develop other "loves".   Best wishes and good luck.|`|jrP98BQbaa	i work at a preschool, and i've seen plenty of kids that kling to the mom's leg.  In all of my experience it ends as soon as a connection has been made between the teacher (me) and the child.  then the parents have to get used to the not crying thing. haha.  But, another thing that works well is to have REALLY good transition activities. talk to her teacher about setting up an activity your daughter loves to do when you first get there.  Get her engaged in it, and then leave.  She'll realize your gone, cry for a min, get over it, and be fine.<br>  this is what i've found works for the kids i've worked with.<br>  best of luck!|`|0BjfEel2aa	Tell her before you go that you want to hear everything she did that day when she gets picked up so she will be looking forward to telling you about everything she has done. You could always tell her when she makes a full week of good drop offs you will go some where fun! That will give them something to look forward too and they get to spend time with you.|`|gaVhPGWhaa	make someone else drop her off<br>  tell her to stop<br>  walk away real fast so she cant grab your leg<br>  sneak away when shes not looking<br>  get her some friends. when you drop her off, tell her to go to her friend so shes all excited about her friend and she forgets about you.|`|dBS6a7nXaa	Tell her you'll be waiting for her when she gets out. She'll go off and forget because she's just so little! Tell her to have fun as well.|`|XFB0KTmYaa	hmmmm.....well....with a sound back round in child pshycology....it sounds like a classic case of abandonment relapse.....Is the Father home??  Or does she remember someone at birth til 2-3 and they are no longer around??  She has a fear that you are going to leave her for good...and not for the moment.....a few I miss you tears are one thing....but to grab your leg is fear that she has within her that you are not coming back.....the fear of loss of this magnitude in a young 4.5 year old child is not good....I would keep a close eye on her....never lie to her...and always show up when you say you are going to do so.....you would be surprised what children see, hear, and remember....their minds are like green hungry sponges at this age.....and anything you do will effect them for years to come....so be careful and do the right things....good luck|`|mKcLCpZSaa	The worst thing you could do is give in and keep her from PreK.  I have taught PreK for many years and hold my degree in Early Childhood.  Many children often go through separation anxiety and several of those children take it a few steps further.  Sounds like your daughter may be one of them.  First and foremost, drop off must be quick... don't drag it on because that makes things MUCH worse.  Giver her a kiss, tell her you love her and be on your way.  The teacher may have to physically remove her from you.  If she says she likes to go to school then she clearly is OK while there.  How long does she cry after you leave?  Sometimes it is helpful to allow the child to bring a picture of you/family to school and keep it in her cubby.  Just knowing it is there can be soothing to them.  It saddens me to hear that the teacher said "it's not working out"!  Have you all tried different strategies? You may need to get on the same page as the teacher to make this work.  I have had some VERY trying children but they come around eventually, just don't give up because that will send a terrible message to your daughter.  If this teacher is not willing to help your daughter, maybe you should try another that is willing.  There are plenty out there. Good luck and feel free to email me if you have any questions!|`|wR6qp414aa	Offspring of all animals (yes, we are animals too) are meant to leave their mothers at certain times of their lives.  When they are able to fend for themselves is when young are meant to leave their mothers.<br>  <br>  Think about when a puppy is old enough to leave it's mother...when it is able to eat on its own, same for other animals.<br>  <br>  It is only us humans that push our off-spring out of the nest as soon as we can.<br>  <br>  In reality, children are not ready to leave the comforts of their mother.  Some deal with it better on the outside, but that isn't to say that on the inside things aren't right.<br>  <br>  2 generations ago children did not even have to attend Kindergarten if the parents didn't want to send them until 1st grade.  This generation starts sending their children into school as soon as the doors will open.<br>  <br>  It doesn't always give them the educational push that we hope for.  Understand that a lot of children can learn at home and learn more at home.  As far as the socialization aspect which a lot of pre-school parents claim, this could be accomplished at a play group or other activity, church perhaps.<br>  <br>  Bottom line...your daughter needs you.
aPscVrOoaa	It is totally inappropriate. I don't care how comfortable mom and baby are with the breastfeeding process, that doesn't mean everyone else is comfortable. Why should my 14 year old son have to see some lady's boobs in the middle of going through hormones and dealing with puberty? Its completely inconsiderate.|`|OrKpKxkHaa	I am very modest and I dont like to breast feed in public but I dont mind when other women do. To try and cover a baby's head while they are eating is not as easy as you might think. They get all sweaty and there you are trying to get the baby to latch on, which is hard enough, and then you have to fumble with a blanket in hopes noone catches a glimps of skin? I think that would cause more of a scene than just nonchalantly feeding the baby. I think it would be a great learning moment for an 8 year old. And a toddler would probably giggle and forget about it. It's not indecent exposure and its not really up to the public, it is up to each woman individually.|`|ArDBlPKYaa	Oh boy, here we go.<br>  <br>  I'm sure people have already addressed the unfairness of making a baby eat in a bathroom stall and the naturalness of breastfeeding.  <br>  As far as the 8 y/o boy is concerned, I would have a much tougher time explaining to him why there are half-naked anorexicly-thin women covering the magazines at the grocery store checkout aisle, than explaining to him that human breasts are for babies to have the milk they need to survive and have the best start in life.  Women have breasts, and they are for feeding babies - it shouldn't be an issue to a child.  It's probably more sensical to them then you might think.|`|zlGb9NkZaa	i feel that babies must eat & mothers shouldn't have to become recluses if they chose to give their babies the best they can by breastfeeding.<br>  <br>  edit:  seeing a breast in the act it was intended for is a LOT more appropriate than seeing them the way they are portrayed in movies, porn, internet, etc, etc, that most kids are exposed to by the age of 8.|`|471ca0c8552c4633e525815ba702310aaa	I nurse my son in public with out a cover.

In addition, it can also be done discreetly with something called a blanket.<br>  <br>  I suppose the 8 year should not go to the beach, shopping mall, school etc. Cause sometimes even a woman with a T-Shirt can be seen completely although not nude. If it's really a problem to you or someone. One can ask nicely if it can be covered or something can be worked out.<br>  <br>  I think this is the best natural food for a child and better than most processed or powdered baby milk in a bottle. If seen in public so be it.|`|GJEFaaTWaa	A baby has to eat to survive, and I am not going to starve my baby bc some people feel uncomfortable or are too immature to handle it.

There is nothing wrong with it.<br>  <br>  **Edit** Maybe you should teach your child that a breast isn't always a sexual thing? I know my 7 year old son would't think twice if he saw a woman breast feeding. It's communication. He knows what he is seeing therfore it doesn't bother him. I am sure if he wasn't educated on what breast feeding was he would be a bit bashful about it...|`|ggETPqedaa	Maybe our society should learn that a breast is also used to nurture and feed our kids. Teach your kids that it's not always about sex, that's what is most of the problem now a days anyway. It's all about sex and scantily clad women that walk around. I would rather see a mom nursing her kid than a woman that is barely covered and everything hanging out. <br>  <br>  If you don't want to look, turn away. It's not like you -have- to look at the woman breastfeeding. You have a neck, simply use it.|`|DDIBEvUTaa	I think for some reason in our society the breast has become associated with sex.  I should be associated with nourishment instead.  Hopefully in generations to come it will get better.  Just think- it really wasn't so long ago that it was completely inappropriate for a woman to show her ankles or her arms in public!  When I was 8 I wouldn't have thought anything of a woman nursing her child.|`|LWXRVO5Haa	I doubt the scenario you mention is true.<br>  <br>  I believe a woman has every right to nurse in public. America's lawmakers obviously believe the same. Nursing women are exempt from indecent exposure laws. As they should be.<br>  The lactating breast should not be mistaken as a sexual organ. It is not genitalia.<br>  <br>  TO THE WOMAN WHO SAYS IT IS NOT FAIR FOR HER 14 YEAR OLD SON TO SEE:<br>  There is nothing wrong with your son seeing what a woman's breast is actually for. Your son is going to grow up to be perverse! And I bet if you have daugthers they will feel so ashamed of their bodies that your grandchildren will suffer the consiquences of not being breastfed!|`|b978f631fc787a963337206aa3833370aa	I feel like a broken record when I answer this question ... LOL<br>  <br>  Honestly, if the child needs to eat, it needs to eat. No one asks you to go into another room to formula feed, or asks people who have terrible table manners with food hanging out of their mouths to go somewhere else and eat. So I shouldn't be relegated to a toilet stall where someone has just taken a dump to feed my child. <br>  <br>  As long as you're being discreet I see nothing wrong with it. It's not like nursing mothers are doing topless dances on the tables at the mall food court. Most people can't even tell you are nursing, and those that can should just look away and be mature about it. Most moms I know take precautions to make sure they're not showing anything, because they don't want to expose themselves any more than you do.<br>  <br>  ETA: LOL "A teenager" - some day when you're not "a teenager" and are a parent, you might understand. And public breastfeeding is supported by LAW in every state in this country, so you might just have to get over it. <br>  <br>  I have breastfed two of my own children, and seen countless mothers breastfeeding in public and semi-private, and not ONE has exposed their entire breast, or even part of it, while nursing. I question some of those who say they've seen nursing mothers in public places with their entire breast exposed.
wMPjuKycaa	Just be honest.  No one wants their child to be pregnant at a young age, but it happens.  They'll be disappointed for a while but they'll also be supportative. So just be honest.  I told my parents when we were at the doctors office.  I was so afraid. I had to take my mom to the doctor and she didn't know English. So if you and your mom or both of your parents are in the car together or just sitting around, just come out and say it.  I mean that's going to be the only way.  I hope everything works out for you.

Personally, I'm against spanking at all. There are other ways that will probably have more of an effect to discipline a violent child. When kids I babysit start acting up consistently and doing the same things each time, I sit them down and talk to them about my expectations and rules for them as well as the consequences of their behaviour if it continues to be negative. Lay out your expectations (you will treat animals, people and property with respect); define the consequences (time out, taking away privileges, chores, etc) and hold him to it. What he damages he has to fix or pay for, what he messes up he has to clean up, hurting animals means having to care for them (i.e. pick up poop in the yard, feeding, changing water). He obviously doesn't care about being spanked and it won't have any effect on him, so you can try different things. Another thing that may help is taking him to volunteer at an animal shelter or having a law enforcement officer give him a nice talking to about what happens to adults who are convicted of animal abuse.|`|JgDRKLuLaa	You're a good person.

Tell them exactly what he is doing, and ask if there is any reason behind it. Maybe something happened earlier in his life and thats why he is acting that way.

427abcdfcd8e012fe37537ef1426e40faa	She is still very young and doesn't truly understand everything you're trying to teach her.  She also can't resist the urge to do certain things even if she happens to remember that you don't want her to do them.  She can't generalize rules either  -- so she doesn't understand why she can throw trash away, but not your phone.  She doesn't understand why it's okay to throw a ball, but not a book.<br>  <br>  She wants to play with your cell phone because she wants to be like you and do what you're doing.  She's throwing things in the trash b/c you taught her how to do that, and she thinks it's fun.  (My 18-month-old is in a big trash phase, too, so I always give him things to throw away.  Yes, we have found things like his sippy cup in the trash, but it's not a big deal.)<br>  <br>  And you're the one teaching her to hit as well.  You hit her hand when she misbehaves, so she thinks she's supposed to hit people, too.  She learns *everything* from you and her father.  She doesn't yet understand what you tell her to do (or not do), so she's mimicking your actions.  She wants to be just like you and do everything you do.<br>  <br>  So, give her her own cell phone (a toy, an old one that nobody uses anymore, a cordless with an uncharged battery, etc.).  Keep your cell phone up if you don't want her to play with it.  That is your responsibility.  As for the trash, you need to either keep it in a locked cupboard or keep an eye on her whenever she's in the kitchen (or wherever you have trash cans).<br>  <br>  When she does something that you don't want her to do, redirect her to something that she is allowed to do.  So if she throws a toy into the trash, tell her that the toy doesn't get thrown away, but she can throw away the napkin from lunch.  If she hits you, tell her that that hurts you, and show her how to touch you gently.  I also have my 18-month-old "apologize" by gently patting whomever he has hurt.  If she is using a toy hammer to hit you, show her what she is allowed to hammer (the floor, a toy nail, etc.).  Kids don't learn much from just being told "no" all the time.  What they need to know is what they *are* allowed to do.  <br>  <br>  I also find that time outs don't really work well at this age.  I only use them when the child is throwing such a severe tantrum that he or she can't be calmed or redirected.  Then, I put the child in the crib and give them a minute to settle.  It's more of a chance for both of us to calm down than it is a punishment.  <br>  <br>  You and the baby's father also need to be on the same page as to what she is and isn't allowed to do and how you handle different situations.  Consistency is important at this age, so if he allows her to do certain things, she's not going to understand yet why she can't do them with you.<br>  <br>  Good luck trying some new things and figuring out what works for you and her!|`|5uEAHEQJaa	Give her time outs.|`|yayDgY0qaa	Take a playpen and put her in there and if she starts to cry threaten to make her stay in longer then she will listen that's what i do with my little 15 month-old brother.

A little hypocritical isn't it? Also, she is only 16 months old she probably doesn't understand as much as you might think. Kids this age are all about testing the limits of their new found freedom. If you are persistent when telling her no, eventually she will grow tired of whatever she is doing. Also, the best discipline for kids this age is redirection or distraction. For instance, when she has your cell phone, take it from her, tell her that is for grown ups and give her her own phone or another toy to play with.|`|bmoCpcdraa	put a playpen in corner to use for time out keep no toys in it and, only use it for time out        i hope i helped|`|4c7QomPoaa	I'd worry less about your daughter and more about her father.  He's a poor excuse for a parent if he condones and encourages such behavior.|`|AA10624857	Even though it is true that your baby understands more than she can say, she is still very young in the language development skills. At this age she is very fascinated with "cause and effect" actions meaning she is learning to understand that when you do something it results in a particular action. It is normal and age appropriate for her to repeatedly do an action over and over. She knows that things go in the trash can, but she has not yet reached a developmental level where she can discern what "trash" is and what isn't. Since she finds some particular items fascinating that are also off-limits, being proactive instead of reactive may be a better option. If your cell phone attracts her than be sure that it is put away out of her sight and out of her reach. If the trash can draws her, put a latch on the lid or keep it up on a counter out of her reach. Instead of punishing her for things, it works considerably better to guide her to appropriate activities. Your daughter does not stop doing things because she necessarily knows right from wrong, but rather stops because the tone of your voice distracts her. 16 months is an age of exploration. She won't be able to direct her own independent play very well and if she can it would be normal for it to not last long. Attention spans can be rather short. This age requires constant supervision as well as lots of hands on guiding and teaching. Many parents find it very frustrating to have to continue to tell their toddlers not to do something over and over. This is because their brain development is still working on processing what words mean as well as figuring out their place in the world around them. I suggest not worrying as much about punishment as much as focusing on discipline. Punishment comes after a behavior while discipline works to develop the desired behavior. I'd skip the "popping" and the time-out chair for now. Instead, guide her away from the behavior you don't want with words such as, "Mommy's phone is not a toy. Let's go build a tower with your blocks." If she enjoys throwing things in the trash can, make up some appropriate ways for her to explore that. Use a laundry basket and have her throw bean bags or socks into it. There's lots to see and do and learn when you are 16 months old so it's helpful if you can guide her to some things that will develop her skills and keep her away from the trash and your cell phone.|`|VMY7No0eaa	Well I am from old school... and would have given a spank...<br>  There is an old saying that goes (the fastest route to the brain is through the butt)<br>  but at is not allowed/ the thing to do  now... so I would find a kids chair and tell her it's a naughty chair...or step and take her there and give her 10 min... if she gets up it starts all over again 10 from the beginning.

Be responsible..|`|C42zVqrSaa	You should worry about sexually transmitted diseases.  Please use a condom.  Don't put your self into those groups that always think - not me.  it could be you.  AIDS, etc.<br>  <br>  THINK about your future.|`|gh5x9nROaa	as long as you've been taking your pills, you most likely are fine .<br>  <br>  :)|`|FQ4nhSiRaa	If you are on the pill and it is taken correctly, it is very effective, regardless of what part of the cycle of pills you are on. You should ALWAYS, however use a condom as backup. Whether he ejaculates in you or not, there is semen released, and it could get you pregnant. Also, a condom is the ONLY way to protect against STDs. Regardless of how many partners you and you partner have or have not had, carrying an STD is possible, so PROTECT YOURSELF. If you dont, who will?|`|AA11221077	Don't have sex. You're too young.  And I'm sorry, but if you don't know how your birth control works, you really have no business being sexually active.|`|AA10327722	Your fine then.  Just keep taking your birth control like you are.|`|5a1c8253181a8adf5c06c0040d8f981eaa	Just because you are on the sugar pill week, doesn't mean you can get pregnant during that time.  Don't you think the doctor that prescribed the pills to you would have explained that to you?  Or the package insert would have mentioned it.  <br>  <br>  The pill isn't 100% effective, but if you have been on it for 6 months and have been taking it properly, there isn't really any reason you should get pregnant.  <br>  <br>  You should educate yourself more about sex, pregancy, and the drug you are taking!|`|4WgsBvq1aa	well its good you're consistent with the pill, but unfortunately you can get pregnant whilst your on the sugar pills because they are just a suppliment whilst your not on the real pills which are the contraceptives ones, the sugar pills are they break which let your body have its menstrual cycle and it is possible to get pregnant during your period.<br>  so i would definitely wait till your next periiod or at least till the minimal amount of 19 days after intercourse to take a home pregnancy test unless you want to see a doctor and get total confirmation either way but even for that you should wait or 11 days for conception if it happens.<br>  but i hope that it was just a scare and you'll be fine<br>  best of luck<br>  dont stress yourself out, you'll know soon enough!
7rKUmK0qaa	yes my dr. told me i can eat shrimp no more than 12 ounces in a week. On my first pregnancy I ate shrimp and crabs hmm a week and my son turned out fine.<br>  Moderation is the key.<br>  <br>  Just try to avoid the big fish such as tuna, shark etc.<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.babycenter.com.sg/pregnancy/nutrition/foodsafety/seafoodexpert/" rel="nofollow">http://www.babycenter.com.sg/pregnancy/n...</a>|`|qZ0310yVaa	for sure go for it have 2 helpings|`|eS4CSdQ5aa	yes just make sure its cooked all the way through|`|ww3ukbdVaa	shrimp is good for pregnant ladies. shrimp helps develop the baby's mind to make it smarter =] its definitely safe. the more the better|`|r8LJEJwbaa	Yeah I'm pretty sure shrimp is fine! All I know is that you can't have like caffeine.....well that's the big one, anyway.|`|jcTnOE8uaa	no.|`|831a7af670f2985636729db688219516aa	I would avoid it until I have cleared it with my doctor.  <br>  <br>  If you haven't been pregnant before, you'll discover all types of weird little things to avoid such as not digging in dirt in order to avoid any type of infection being introduced into the blood stream and, thus, to the baby.  I would never have thought of that unless a pregnant friend had told me.  <br>  <br>  As for the shrimp, I have heard both yes and no - some say avoid all shell fish and some say it is okay, so ask your doctor.<br>  <br>  Good luck with the approaching arrival!|`|QIDhVAjjaa	of course it is my mom ate it all the time with me even on the way to hospital she asked the driver to pull over and get her some shrimp Lol.  It's perfectly safe the only food to stay away from is the ones with alcohol in it all the other ones are safe.|`|y38cvIn9aa	The only seafood you have to watch is larger fish, due to the amounts of mercury. I've eaten shrimp on a number of occasions, just make sure it's cooked thoroughly, like anything else.|`|YKCIubvKaa	Yes. They say watch out for tuna because of the mercury but unless your eating tuna EVERYDAY your fine. HOWEVER.. I ate shrimp that very night I went into labor. Almost 4 weeks early :P  I can't say it was the shrimp but its a funny coincidence.|`|gaWZ79gNaa	sure why not! <br>  <br>  just becareful!<br>  <br>  your pregnant not banned from eating. just watch the amounts you eat and make sure its clean and cooked properly :)|`|AA10327722	Its ok but just don't eat alot.|`|ZIC9c4h7aa	yea just dont smoke drink or do drugs|`|diAqosiIaa	yes|`|3T0KClccaa	The answer is yes and no. If you don't eat it it could save you and your babe's life. Some shimp has a infectionous acid in them called sobriquentyoudodenseagorintite. It comes from the latin root killer dies. It starts with small symtoms like the food posion symtoms. Then your head becomes completely soggy. The your head disataches from your body and the bottom half spontanious combusts. your head just rolls away. Its better to be on the safe side though. DONT EAT THE SHRIMP!|`|WmKjeUELaa	Yes, it is perfectly safe.  I have eaten it about 3 or 4 times since I have been pregnant and of course felt fine.  My doctor said it was ok as well.  If you ever have ANY questions though about foods you can and can't eat while pregnant, always consult your doctor.|`|8SbKEkBKaa	yes but i wouldn't make a habit of it. shrimp are filters of the sea making them really unhealthy to eat. especially for a developing baby. it won't harm you for one night, just pray for your meal and you'll be ok.|`|093b1b11f8294e0a378a447799ee4e3baa	Are you allergic? Then no. As long as you don't eat it very often it should be okay. You have to be careful because of the high contents of mercury in fish.|`|8G6HXDpnaa	you mostly want to eat healthy things that you like.|`|AA11539689	No scientific evidence.|`|1ss17pyzaa	yes, it has low mercury levels in it. I would try to eat seafood less that 3 times a week though. Especially fish or seafood from the sea.|`|8fyMtGjdaa	Yes. You just cannot eat anything containing mercury, like sushi.|`|Poht8MR9aa	From experience I got deathly ill with all three of my children eating any kind of shell-fish..........its how I knew I was Preganant|`|v7WCry37aa	lol yes...you can eat anything unless you are allergic to it ..or your not suppose to eat it in the first place..haha|`|AHlBjbNcaa	yes it is OK
bmoCpcdraa	no, but if like cats then they can have a pup by the father for up to 3 litters later.so, the next few litters could have mut dogs.  i'm not sure i had all humans, you should ask under pets........ i hope i helped,hun,|`|XagPxe7Faa	Yes, it will hurt her!  7 yo is way too old for a dog to be carrying/delivering a litter.  Most retire their females from breeding at 4 yrs, 5 yrs max.  Your best option for the sake of your female is to have her spayed ASAP.|`|tkkYIdIvaa	Try asking this in the dog section. I don't know about Malteses and Yorkies but try to call your vet and ask. The dog section will jump your a$$ when you ask though, believe me.|`|kSEO2w8Aaa	how could your dog be pregnant with a seven year old!!!!!!! so weird!|`|yayDgY0qaa	What does this have to do with toddlers? it should be in pets!
XE3E4i3iaa	Talk to your teachers and ask them for homework for those 4 missed days. Try to convince your parents that's you have it all under control. That you're taking your books, and you will study the chapters you will miss and finish the assigned homework.<br>  <br>  Good luck!
WmKjeUELaa	The only thing you can do now is wait it out.  I doubt you would be having symptoms this early though.  Everytime I thought I was pregnant, when I ended up not being of course, I had every symptom in the book.  When I actually became pregnant, I didn't have any symptoms until after we found out.  You can trick your mind, so just try to relax and wait for your next period.|`|59OfAFvTaa	its always possible i would wait to see if you miss your next period then take a test. or take a test now hu nos but if you wait make sure you stay safe as if you wer pregnant, no alcohal etc....<br>  <br>  good luck watever way you want it to go!!! =]|`|O5azbUHyaa	You're definently pregnant.<br>  <br>  You're life is over and you'll be living in a homeless shelter in 3 years.

So I like them name Jessica better for a girl.<br>  <br>  The name Jessica was first appeared in Shakespeares 'Merchant of Venice'. So it have a cool story behind it. <br>  <br>  The name Marie means bitter or French form of Mary but I absolutely love the name for a middle.<br>  <br>  Jessica Marie is beautiful. Write back with the name you choose!|`|Am54a7c0aa	I'm not a fan of the name Jesse, sorry.|`|0ckXZSGFaa	I dont like Jessie to be honest...sorry. But Jessica Marie is a beautiful name(:|`|8929fa2803b58abe640d9bd8cb8c209eaa	I like it, but I think people would get confused with the gender if it is spelled Jesse.|`|bvjvV8k9aa	I find Jesse a boy's name and it doesn't matter how you spell it.|`|7j3l8EJZaa	ummm....try Lynn Marie or Claire, or maybe Ashley marie|`|LmlIzdwsaa	its okayy.|`|MRtX1L2faa	cute|`|3ce9c9fc654b250f21c744ff5f30fba5aa	"Jesse" is the masculine version of the name.<br>  <br>  So no, I don't like it for a girl.<br>  <br>  Kinda billiken-ish if you ask me. Which you did. So there.|`|HUl4yvDBaa	Very common.<br>  <br>  I'm not too fond of it. <br>  <br>  It's cute, but it's not a name I'd choose.<br>  <br>  Of course, it's up to you.|`|eQWAVpDXaa	Jessica Marie would be better...|`|H9o3jdm2aa	No, How about Jessica Marie that sounds more better.|`|0rgKBcgpaa	I dont really like it.

bNeL6Lftaa	yes a baby changes everything. you will never know how much till you go through it. i am 20 and 19 when i was prego. i am a single mom with little help from my parents and i am loving everyday. i thought it would be hard but it is so rewording to wake up and see that little face every more and smiles it will melt you heart every day. that never fails. the felling. to hard to put into words. this change is good and having a baby not only changes your was of looking at the world but the dad, grandparent, friends. it is great enjoy being progo though it will be over be for you know it. bale|`|ojVl4Gowaa	I don't think that's true for all men, but because they are not physically carrying the baby (feeling the wiggles and kicks) some men may find the pregnancy to be surreal and not get that bond until the baby is in their arms.<br>  <br>  As for my personal experience:<br>  My husband an I are having an unexpected but welcomed pregnancy, and at first he was very loving as usual but not really understanding the gravity of the situation. At the first ultrasound (mine wasn't until 17 weeks) we both cried when we saw our little girl on the screen. Since then he has really connected with the idea that our daughter is coming and has become very protective of me and my growing belly. He is putting my health first, and is active in baby discussions (i.e. how we will raise her) and does his best to make sure my pregnancy is comfortable. He knows he will be a father soon, and is preparing for it.|`|x18w912Xaa	yes i see it as an awakening to him. It didn't hit him until he saw the sonogram and heard the heartbeat. A baby can definitely change a woman's life. I think with a child in my life, the baby will help me prioritize. This has made me feel more of a woman! I can't wait! :)|`|gWJUFq1Baa	no.|`|BjEr7FGUaa	Im 21 I had my baby last year. I dated this guy for about 3 years and he was horrible! He had a really bad temper, he would just spaz and start screaming and jumping up and down, going absolutely crazy - at the drop of a dime. I got pregnant and figured well when the baby comes he'll grow up, he'll get a job, and calm down and treat me much better. Welll  that was wishful thinking, nothing changed it got waaay worse, he would scream at me and swear at me in front of son, he absolutely tortured us, death threats, he would threaten to kill himself, me, my family, the baby. It got soo much worse after the baby. Finally now a year and a half later, he still doesn’t help, we haven’t seen him in months and I havent gotten a dime from him since the baby was born. So to answer your question, if he is horrible now, having a baby more than likely will not change him. Its better off to just keep him as far away from the baby as possible, you dont want crazy unstable people around your little one, father or not.<br>  <br>  Thats just my personal experience<br>  But having a baby is amazing, whether or not it works out with the father, the best thing you'll ever do is become a mommy, its tough, but sooooo soo worth it.|`|eS4CSdQ5aa	my husband feels its not real to him until he sees our son<br>  <br>  he can feel him move and kick but its not a bonding experiance like ours - the mothers<br>  <br>  once he sees the baby i am sure he will melt into the father that i know he can be.<br>  <br>  good luck|`|DTUOvJm0aa	That was totally the case with my brother, and i think that might be the same with my boyfriend if i marry him (though withhim it's not a maturity thing, but more like a seeing himself as a father sort of thing) <br>  <br>  My brother was immature and when my niece was born, it all changed. he went from Tom to Daddy just like that.
1Ys7uSHHaa	actually lol the same thing is happening to me. im 5 days late and im always on time. my boobs hurt sometimes worse then others. i crave chocolate like crazy. again sometimes worse then others haha. i have gained maybe 5 pounds but i dont exactly count that as anything. my emotions are kinda weird right now. and i to feel different. because usually i dont worry but this time has me thinking different. and i never pay attention cuz ive been a week late before.<br>  <br>  my advice to you is keep a calendar and write down when you start adn when you end. i always do that so i know if im late or not. the pee thing that wouldnt happen right away i dont think only because the baby wouldnt be big enough to effect your bladder.<br>  honestly just go adn get tested. thats the only way to know. i know its scary and your like omg omg omg. lol. so get an over the counter one. i did it said i wasnt. but im not to sure. so if i dont get it by tuesday im making an appointment. <br>  <br>  i think u should do the same:D|`|czmiYdjkaa	Okay. take a deep breath. relax, heres what you can do. tell your boyfriend that you might be pregnant. He will understand. My opinon, your not pregnant. if tthose syptoms normally happen durring your period, chances are your not pregnant. take a pregnancy test to be sure. no need to be embarrased about it, it's for your health any way, but if you still are talk to your doctor.|`|1lE3FLqOaa	take a pregnancy test.|`|lIIOdFTQaa	Congratulations, you have triplets!!!!|`|0ioylgULaa	pregnancy test, or go to your doctor.|`|juBBVYhSaa	I'm not a medical professional, but I'm pretty sure it's still too early to tell. The only thing you can do is wait and take a pregnancy test.<br>  Even  after taking a test, you should visit your doctor to confirm the results.<br>  <br>  As far as your bf goes, I wouldn't tell him anything now just because nothing is certain and I'm sure you wouldn't want to make panic. So perhaps you should wait until you know for sure.<br>  <br>  <br>  Good Luck!
Ds4xCthSaa	What kind of medicine did they give her? Is it sort of minty that she sticks under her tongue and has to let it dissolve? Ask for a medicine, it's a suppository that will make your wife go to sleep. I was real sick when I was pregnant, it started at about the 6th week and ended at about 15 weeks. I only struggled at night though, but I ended up getting put in the hospital because I was dehydrated. Have your wife eat small things that she can handle, and right after she eats it she needs to try and go to sleep to keep it down. Talk to your doctor. Just watch out that she doesn't get dehydrated.|`|czmiYdjkaa	You seem to not know about pregnancy. Its called morning sickness.  Its completly normal. relax. Learn more about pregnancy If you need to.|`|jkDbDjcRaa	It's normal.<br>  There are medications and certain things she can eat that may help stop the morning sickness.  Ask your doctor or look online.<br>  <br>  For me personally...I had morning sickness day and night for 4 months of my pregnancy.  And none of the suggested things to try worked for me, so I just had to endure it.|`|bYUdtQZsaa	Everyone is different. Some people get really bad morning sickness while others get none. Try the brat diet. Bananas, rice, applesauce, and toast. Tell her to eat some saltines BEFORE getting out of bed. If the medicine isn't working, try contacting your OB about a different medicine. There aren't a whole bunch of meds that OBs allow you to take, if any. I hope this helps out some. Also, purchase a copy of the book, "What to Expect when you're expecting" it has excellent tips for her and ideas on how you can help her throughout her pregnancy. Trust me, it'll save you a lot of worry and a lot of unnecessary calls to your OB. Make sure to get the updated version too.|`|AA10144812	This is normal, but relax. If the medicine is not working, try chamomile tea. When I was pregnant this worked excellent with me. It will not only help with the vomiting but it will relax her and calm her down. Also try not to cook a lot of foods that have strong orders. Like fried foods, eggs, etc. Hope this helps|`|tBx1M0g9aa	your wife is getting sick like throwing up maybe in the morning because she is pregnant morning sickness is normal|`|vXXDzBaKaa	CALM DOWN! This is completely normal! Most women vomit while they are pregnant. (Only a few lucky ones don't experience vomiting). This usually passes after the 4th month. It may take longer though. You may need to do some research on pregnancy by searching the internet or reading the book "what to expect when you are expecting". Congratulations by the way!|`|lIIOdFTQaa	Nah, ur wife is just a dumptruck. if she threw up more she'd lose some weight.

1B91qtNQaa	My 3 year old uses the computer. Both of my kids have their own user account where I have it set up so the parental controls only allow them on the sites that I have preapproved and I also have it set where they can only be on at certain times of the day for only a certain amount of time.|`|AA11126544	If she does, make sure you watch what she does. There's a lot of perverts online who would try to talk to her.|`|zXCFGPhOaa	Well what does she want to get on? Make sure you monitor what she gets on is all i can say. I don't think it would hurt for her to get on like barbie.com or play a game, but monitor it.|`|6783eff5fcc328b9527aa61f6d84bcf2aa	<a href="http://www.starfall.com" rel="nofollow">http://www.starfall.com</a><br>  <br>  i'm a kindergarten teacher of 5 and 6 year olds, and this is the best website ever.  it teaches children their letters, how to read, and generally fun things to do on the site.  all of my 5/6 year olds go on the internet in my class to do learning activities.|`|rdpZrBc9aa	Not on line, but there are plenty of computer games, even educational ones, that are fine for her.

5EFc1QYbaa	For my shower I received gift cards anywhere from $10 - $100 depending on my relationship with the person and their finances.  I would be greatful for any gift someone gave me regardless of the amount.  So I guess you have to consider the recievers attitude as well!  I think $50 is a very generous gift from a friend.  I think it's cute to put the card inside the frame but I would worry she might not notice it and it would get lost.  I would put it in the card with the frame.|`|oP63vYmaaa	$50 gift card is huge. Probably you don't need to give such a big amount of money. The photo frame is nice, but it is not as useful as the gift card.<br>  Anyway, I got this offer for Baby gift card on the mail. I haven't tried so far<br>  <br>  www.getyour50giftcard.blogspot.com<br>  <br>  Hope this helps|`|OrKpKxkHaa	I think $50 is a generous gift. At my baby shower, I recieved gift cards from $25-$200 (from different people of course, coworkers gave less than family members) and I appreciated all of them. I love the frame you chose and I don't think it's tacky to remove the film as the item is brand new with or without the wrapping. Cute idea and very thoughtful! Good luck!|`|jkDbDjcRaa	Most gift cards I recieved were $50.  That's plenty!<br>  <br>  I like your idea about putting it in the frame, I don't think it's tacky at all.|`|EHY3FnAmaa	That is a perfect gift.<br>  The idea is cute not at all tacky.<br>  Also 50 is very generous, most people only give 20 or 25!|`|OF7ZHq19aa	30$|`|rdUKSiIxaa	30-50$ is OK!|`|ME62Mtv4aa	$50. is plenty. I would've said $30.|`|nsKs6OXLaa	$50 is a lot. When our son was born 3 years ago, we received many present, but I believe a gift card would have been more useful. <br>  <br>  I like the photo frame as well, but I believe the gift card is more useful.|`|95189342d06d1e6a137e42b2b1138bd3aa	$50 is more than enough!<br>  <br>  And by all means, put the gift card in the frame.  It makes it more personal that way and shows that you put at least a little thought into it.|`|9AdY90r2aa	30-50 and the frame is really cute!|`|Jswomud7aa	That is totally fine. A gift is a gift... ANYTHING, no matter how big or small, should be appreciated!<br>  <br>  And I think you did way more than necessary with just the gift card, but your frame idea is really cute and creative.|`|pXSKSS3daa	Oh goodness, $50 is just fine!<br>  <br>  I like the idea of putting the card in the frame, very cute. :) I don't think of it as being "tacky" at all. This way you could wrap it some neat tissue paper too.|`|t0mb150gaa	50 is plenty..usually i base the price of my gift on how close i am to the person receiving it. And i think your idea of putting it inside the picture frame is very unique and not tacky at all. She will appreciate your thought and any gifts she receives and i think you are being very generous!|`|gx4s68s8aa	I think your idea of putting the gift card in the frame was a lovely idea.  And cute frame, by the way.<br>  <br>  And as far as the amount-  The only thing I think is tacky or wrong is anyone that would question the amount that they were given in a gift card.  The amount should never matter.  But, 50 dollars is more than generous if you are asking me to be completely honest.|`|7rCeCVl2aa	$50.00 is plenty. That is very generous of you and any new parent would appreciate that. Your idea of putting it in the frame is very cute too. =)|`|h59Bc4wfaa	Gift cards are very impersonal. But you have already bought it, so 50 dollars is more than enough. The putting it in the frame is a nice thought.

aJLx0nhNaa	I want to know too.  I think it's B.S., but I'm curious to see the results.|`|AA11920812	I can`t find ANYTHING to support the fact that a baby switched at birth had its stomach pumped. That article refrenced only talks about a switched baby, not a stomach pumping.<br>  <br>  As a mom who breastfed her babes, I wouldn`t be mad at the contents on the stomach. Rather, I`d be mad that his lips where at another woman`s breast. That she got that connection with him not me. I think stomach pumping would be stupid at that point.|`|M5E3mDBJaa	I've Googled it also and haven't found a single article to support the claims other than the similar story that you've already found.|`|MeYILJeSaa	This is the first I've heard this...<br>  Why would they pump the breast milk from his stomach? I'm confused. lol<br>  <br>  The article says it happened last March. Did you give us the right link?|`|jqZY0OyPaa	Where does it say his stomach was pumped ?|`|KUxEBQuYaa	why in the world would they remove the IDs? that is why they are there. to keep this from happening. but this happened back in march of 08 didn't it?|`|pXSKSS3daa	I don't think it's true at all.<br>  <br>  I read that article too and didn't see one mention of a baby's stomach being pumped. So I wonder if someone is making it up or seeing something that we're not!
HxXduL1maa	If you're having a normal pregnancy, sex is considered safe during all stages of the pregnancy.<br>  <br>  So what's a "normal pregnancy"? It's one that's considered low-risk for complications such as miscarriage or pre-term labor. Talk to your doctor, nurse-midwife, or other pregnancy health care provider if you're uncertain about whether you fall into this category. (The next section of this article may help, too.)<br>  <br>  Of course, just because sex is safe during pregnancy doesn't mean you'll necessarily want to have it! Many expectant mothers find that their desire for sex fluctuates during certain stages in the pregnancy. Also, many women find that sex becomes uncomfortable as their bodies get larger.<br>  <br>  You and your partner need to keep the lines of communication open regarding your sexual relationship. Talk about other ways to satisfy your need for intimacy, such as kissing, caressing, and holding each other. You also may need to experiment with other positions for sex to find those that are the most comfortable.<br>  <br>  Many women find that they lose their desire and motivation for sex late in the pregnancy - not only because of their size but also because they're preoccupied with the impending delivery and the excitement of becoming a new parent.<br>  <br>  <br>  There are two types of sexual behavior that aren't safe for any pregnant woman:<br>  <br>  If you engage in oral sex, your partner should not blow air into your vagina. Blowing air can cause an air embolism (a blockage of a blood vessel by an air bubble), which can be potentially fatal for mother and child. <br>  You should not have sex with a partner whose sexual history is unknown to you or who may have a sexually transmitted disease, such as herpes, genital warts, chlamydia, or HIV. If you become infected, the disease may be transmitted to your baby, with potentially dangerous consequences. <br>  If your doctor, nurse-midwife, or other pregnancy health care provider anticipates or detects certain significant complications with your pregnancy, he or she is likely to advise against sexual intercourse. The most common risk factors include:<br>  <br>  a history or threat of miscarriage <br>  a history of pre-term labor (you've previously delivered a baby before 37 weeks) or signs indicating the risk of pre-term labor (such as premature uterine contractions) <br>  unexplained vaginal bleeding, discharge, or cramping <br>  leakage of amniotic fluid (the fluid that surrounds the baby) <br>  placenta previa, a condition in which the placenta (the blood-rich structure that nourishes the baby) is situated down so low that it covers the cervix (the opening of the uterus) <br>  incompetent cervix, a condition in which the cervix is weakened and dilates (opens) prematurely, raising the risk for miscarriage or premature delivery <br>  multiple fetuses (you're having twins, triplets, etc.)|`|WWcaKZ7Qaa	If she wants to, then yes. There's no harm in having sex unless there is something going bad with the pregnancy and the doctor recommends abstaining.|`|yJZeRu5Vaa	yeah just dont beat up on the belly|`|qZXIm3Ksaa	it's actually good to stretch the cervix and prepare for delivery unless the  woman in question experiences pain. But yeah it's perfectly normal :)|`|6L9jJnchaa	I'm 23 weeks and still having it.  I don't plan on stopping until the 6 week wait after the baby is born, lol.|`|S4pNsW3Taa	Its perfectly safe and healthy for you and your baby unless otherwise instructed by your doctor|`|uQc4UA2Caa	YES!!! its perfectly safe|`|jn34aSgHaa	i didnt find out that i was pregnant till i was 2 months and i had alot of sex with my husband and it was fine the only risk is for women who have a high risk pregnancy but they obgyn should let them know right away, of there is any bleeding then defenatly they should not have sex. besides that sex is actually good for labor and so forth. hope i was helpfull =0)|`|C8E3fe3xaa	Yes you can have sex at anytime during your pregnancy..unless your doctor says not to. Have fun!|`|sLgI3cRpaa	if u want to i heard it will speed up da process sum how but who am i to tell u, talk to a doctor.|`|QCUPeW8aaa	Im 31 weeks and I still have sex as long as your doctor has not told you differently than sex is fine.<br>  Good luck|`|QJDbG1F1aa	Same here, nothing happened.|`|By1DJAUOaa	I DON'T KNOW...SHOULD SHE???|`|52U22fiAaa	Why not!|`|MFFbL6T9aa	Of course!  There is nothing wrong with intercourse during pregnancy (traditional intercourse). In fact, it's even true that when the pregnancy reaches term, intercourse may speed up labor.|`|G766dQjtaa	Yes, there is nothing wrong with having sex at any point of your pregnancy unless otherwise stated by your doctor.|`|WmcU01D7aa	It's perfectly healthy. In fact, you will notice your sex drive increase dramatically.|`|9EAW8PXkaa	You can have sex until you give birth.|`|SQMMOeqnaa	yes! sex is the BEST when you are pregnant!for some reason my sex drive went wayyy up!|`|vygYFdsSaa	Unless your doctor advises against it, absolutely! :)|`|FfGHHhqBaa	trust me it is way better when your preggers. lol|`|KNxs4PrZaa	unless you are a high risk pregnancy or the doctor has told you not to go for it have fun its perfectly safe!|`|05d5c5e7afca6b13a03cb3ad2e29889caa	YES..|`|7ebNTScOaa	Yes It's a good thing to do|`|7zMtmKJaaa	i heard its healthy... ?|`|RLi3iFXlaa	i did ..
LbkLg4RFaa	We started at about 11.5 months.  Really a couple of weeks shouldn't cause a problem.  We made up like 6oz of formula as normal (same ratio of formula and water) and then added 2oz of whole milk and mixed together.  Personally we mixed to use the tin of formula and because he wouldn't drink whole milk by itself.  We then decreased the amount of formula every few days and increased the whole milk until he was drinking whole milk.|`|iMY2fgYdaa	When we switched our son to milk...I did the milk mixed with formula route...so you just make the formula like normal and then add the amount of mile you want...so at that time my son was drinking 9oz bottles of formula so I would make 6oz of formula and then add 3oz of milk and then as his tummy adjusted I upped the milk amount and lowered the formula until he was completly switched over...now he gets just milk but I tend to water it down a bit.|`|pX7G7Ujcaa	i was a little nerves about weaning my son off of formula also. Believe it or not it wasnt hard at all, he loves the milk and i didnt have to mix it at all. Try giving it to her straight and if she doesnt like it then mix it. 3 1/2 oz formula and 3 1/2 oz water and 1 oz milk. do that for about two four days then start putting less formula to milk ratio ( so that shes getting more milk verus formula) pretty soon she will be drinking whole milk.|`|Pjqx3sIZaa	i dont think that you should be weaning your daughter onto whole milk just yet unless she doctor says its fine. theres some type of enzyme or whatever in whole milk that shouldnt be fed to infants until they are 1. <br>  <br>  but i fed my daughter whole milk on her first birthday and she loved it! we ddint wean at all! they love the taste and it was very simple.|`|75c40712ce4c1c9063d61b17387937f9aa	i don't think we weaned. i think we just offered a glass of milk once a day between formulas until milk was all he drank. but no, if your using 7 oz of water, use the right amount of powder for 7 oz.|`|vUoEgKxpaa	yes, use the same way you normally make her formula.<br>  and each week decrease the amount you normally make by one ounce, and add one ounce of whole milk.
OrKpKxkHaa	I agree with you to a point. For Christmas and anniversaries, I like giving and recieving thoughtful gifts. For weddings and baby showers, gift cards are nice since you can go and buy what you really need and not end up with 4 wardrobes size newborn and 42 photo albums :)|`|AA11814392	I've heard making presents and spending time making it instead of buying it is more thoughtful. Then I also realized that working extra hours also achieves the same end.<br>  <br>  Haha - gift cards while being less though out has the convenient factor. If it weren't for gift cards, "regifting" would increase to stratospherically high levels.|`|7rCeCVl2aa	Isn't it thoughtful to just give you the money so you can purchase what you really need instead of giving you something that you really can't use?|`|F8KmTbqjaa	I second Noah's Mommy a gift is a gift!  They are still spending money on you and in these hard economic times I am thankful for anything!|`|02afccc3abbd7877c182c4b1daa8d2a9aa	I do prefer and actual gift that I would like to have and not a gift card.<br>  <br>  The other picture on this is, many people don't get out to do actual shopping, many times people live far away, don't have a computer to make that purchase over the internet, the stores you picked aren't close for them or it's a hassle trying to find the items you picked in the store or maybe they just don't like what you picked to have for a baby gift.  Many issues come of this when it comes to babies or even a wedding.<br>  <br>  When I got married and then had a baby we didn't have registries like there is now.  You got what you got and if there was a duplicate you returned one and got something else.  It was all about a color theme for the home or a theme you were going for in the baby room.<br>  <br>  Be grateful you received a gift card so you can get what you didn't get at the baby shower because that's what it's intended for.<br>  <br>  When the baby is born there will be people sending you checks for your congratulations or gifts that were never asked for.  Baby gets Christened or Baptized you don't register for that and you get what you get.|`|1jwbQaZTaa	i am very thankful for giftcards!! whether it was a gift for my birthday or christmas or baby shower, i can get what i want and not worry about offending someone by returning the item they bought because it didnt fit, wrong color, etc. <br>  <br>  we got a $500 babies r us giftcard from my husbands office (veryone pitched in like 30 bucks) and it lasted us for about a year. when we were low on money and needed things like diapers, wipes, anything for our baby, we went to babies r us and used the gift card! it really saved our butts when we didnt have an extra 20 or 30 bucks for diapers and wipes!|`|KUxEBQuYaa	i dont like getting cards, but my baby shower was the only time i wanted them. i could go get want i needed. not have 15 sets of crib sheets or the wrong size of clothing for my baby. i could get exactly what i need.|`|eya1WDS4aa	i dont like gift cards either. And in this economy its not wise to give gift cards as gifts...so many stored are closing.|`|pXSKSS3daa	I was actually grateful for the gift cards I received because it meant I could go out and get what we REALLY needed aside from all newborn clothing. That's just me, though. If a person cares enough to get you something(gift card or actual gift) be thankful. They are still spending their money to get you something.<br>  <br>  And if you're speaking about other things such as birthdays I still feel the same way. It's hard shopping for some people and rather then get them something you're not sure about or something they may not use it's nice to let them pick it out.|`|aJLx0nhNaa	For my birthday or something, I generally prefer real gifts.  Unless it's from my mother-in-law who always wants to get me clothes.  Then I prefer gift cards because I can buy what I want.<br>  <br>  As a new parent: gift cards all the way!  The gift cards were so useful to us.
heAH8iFoaa	why not? even i love that show|`|km6rtHPpaa	Yes I will. <br>  You know people's brain is so defected they see all nasty, repulsive, negative stuff in everything. But children they are pure and the way they think is clean. There is nothing wrong with TelleTubbies. And who ever says that "something is not right" then definitely something is wrong with that person’s brain....|`|3HR1SfGMaa	nope, my daughter isn't allowed to watch it.  I don't care what language is spoken on a show as long as it is on that is spoken by someone somewhere on earth but no gibberish.  I do let my daughter watch Dora, and Ni Hao Kailan, she loves them!|`|kM8dCoYqaa	I would have no problems letting my 17 month old son watch the teletubbies. He hasn't as of yet and i have never seen a show but i don't think i would mind. we just watch 4 sqaure and baby einstien. That's probably why he is so smart. haha|`|M5Sw5SWfaa	I guess you could let a kid watch them, but I wouldn't have them watch it all day long.

There is nothing actually wrong with the show.  Adults choose to read into things that are false and that children would never figure out on their own until they're much too old to be watching the show anyways.|`|8f6fff32b0caffa89ef6b762f487ae26aa	NOOOOOOOOOOOOO. They found that tv is not good for babies, infants, toddlers and adults.  My son doesnt watch tv.  He actually interacts with me and his toys.  Teletubbies make kids space out, just like other cartoons.|`|RD05jXYwaa	not sure probably. tmm

That's why he wants your number. The reason his girlfriend was talking about you is because she sees you as a threat. She knows that her boyfriend could like you and doesn't want to lose him.|`|Osn1xpu6aa	hate to break it to you, but HE LIKES YOU and YOU JUST REJECTED HIM. ouuchhh<br>  <br>  his girlfriend hates you because she sees you as a threat...which you are, since her boyfriend likes you.

Let education be your priority.  If you ignore me and get intimate your school grades will drop, as your mind no longer focus on your studies.<br>  <br>  Schools are not for serious relationships with the opposite sex, it is serious relationship with your books and all the school gives you for a bright future; a good profession.|`|w2kofruFaa	There isn't anything wrong with it, but keep in mind, it is just a crush. The likeliness of you dating and staying together, even as high school sweethearts, is 1 out of 1000. So, don't get your heart broken when it doesn't work out..<br>  <br>  On the other hand, other students may think it's a little odd because you're a girl and he's a boy. Typically, I think girls like/date older boys, but that's not always the case. I have a friend who dated a guy for 2 1/2 years. They recently broke up, but he is a freshman and she is a sophomore...|`|Ze0XaOwnaa	Its fine to like him, there's no laws against an 8th grader liking/dating a 7th grader.|`|nKUyy2WLaa	It's totally normal at my school for 8th graders to be dating even 6th graders. Chill out...|`|7mKNHl2zaa	its normal. no worries|`|Iek7D2hOaa	Yeah, I suppose it's okay to like him, but it'd be a tiny bit weird if you dated him. Probably not for you, or him, but other people would probably be a bit squeamish at you kissing, and canoodling with this kid that looks like he's barely hit puberty.<br>  Think about that 13 year old father in the UK, how wrong does that look?|`|N2KmE3rVaa	Yeah its fine.<br>  I have a 7th grade boyfriend and im in 8th grade.<br>  But he's really tall 4 13, i mean like he's 6 inches taller than me!

I'll bet his classmates will think he's awesome if you guys go out since you're an "older woman". :)|`|vUqf6mHqaa	of course its okay for you to like him even though he is a little short. <br>  Dont worry short people rock!|`|W6o3UQLkaa	im in 8th grade goin out with a 7th grader and shes bomb|`|EGiIcGOiaa	its umm... ok i guess but MADD WEIRD IN MY TOWN!!! youd get beat up here hunny sorry babe|`|qPwTPCbvaa	yes|`|61d6c0871b6d1b14610368e50d4c914aaa	its perfectly ok. when i was in 8th grade a dated a 6th grader...lol. last year in 8th grade the "cool" thing was to date a 7th grader|`|yfR1b1Q3aa	It's perfectly natural to have a midget-fetish.
8Qxb7OZOaa	Are you asking why do people sit on wait lists for years for a baby to be born and relinquished when there are living breathing children in foster care being ignored because they are not babies or under 5 yrs of age.|`|00ddc7f7cc561904db032288ec417cc6aa	Are you asking why some couples don’t think about adopting even though they are clearly having fertility issues and have not been able to conceive a natural baby?   <br>  <br>  The truth is that adoption is not for everyone not everyone can love a child that is not biological theirs. For some couples though they might want a biological child when it comes down to it not being a possibility for whatever reason  they want to be parents and so they will try and adopt. There are some couples who either want biological children or no children at all.  Some couples may not be able to afford adopting even more if they spent years trying to conceive a natural child and had to use various fertility treatments those aren’t cheap and they do add up. Some may think that the wait is going to be too long which can often be the case if they want a healthy  infant fresh from the womb even more a healthy white infant. My friends Aunt and Uncle were on a waiting list for about 9 or 10 years before they finale decided to adopt from Russia and got a 2 ? year old.<br>  <br>  As far as people wanting to adopt babies many people just want babies perhaps they feel they will have a stronger bond with their adopted child if they adopted the child when the child is a baby.  They probably want to go through all stages seeing first step, hearing first word, even getting up in the middle of the night to do feedings or walk a sick baby around, being able to have pictures from the time the baby is placed with them which in some cases can be right after the baby is born. <br>  <br>  It also goes back to what many people have said here about prospective adoptive parents putting their desire and want to have and raise a baby first. As said  adoption should always be about finding a home and parent(s) for a baby, toddler, child or teen who needs them. Not finding a baby for a couple or person who wants one.|`|91ff4dbbfbd7827f11b99d3972e133e1aa	Sometimes they want a baby but its not the right time, they want a<br>  carreer first, an education, the better prepared you are in life the better<br>  equipped you will be to take care of a family and all it requires.<br>  For example, do you thing the Oct mom though about if she was<br>  ready financially to bring 8 babies in this world, no she was selfish,<br>  she tought about her own needs. Some people just dont have the<br>  money it requires to fulfill a childs needs, its very expensive.<br>  I only had 1 child, and have been working 2 full time jobs raising her<br>  now that shes 20 yrs old ive raised a young lady that want to go to<br>  medicine, so im still not finished and im 45 yrs old, im very proud of<br>  her, but it takes sacrifice/love/money, hopefully she will become a<br>  valued member of society, but I cringe at the tought of the future of<br>  those 8 children what will become of them, so its not just, Oh I think<br>  ill have a baby or two today, in todays economy you really have to<br>  think why you want a baby and can I afford it, can I give it the attention<br>  it requires, I see a lot of todays parents just have throw away kids,<br>  the minute they have a problem with them, they throw them out on<br>  the street, to be somebody elses problem, todays society is very<br>  heartless and cruel, my daughter has brough home friends sometimes<br>  and told me can she stay over for few days, her parents dont want her<br>  WHAT? DONT WANT HER? Shes not a puppy, shes 15/16 yrs old<br>  this is a crucial time in her life. In society, thats the question, as<br>  parents where are we going? So if youre thinking of adopting, just<br>  think good and hard and if you have the commitment of raising a well<br>  adjusted person, I commend you.  God bless!!!|`|jkDbDjcRaa	I wouldn't give my child up for adoption. (In most circumstances)<br>  I wouldn't be able to live day to day knowing that they are out there.<br>  I would always wonder what they're doing and if they're ok.<br>  I think it would consume my life.<br>  <br>  However, if someone really can't take care of their baby, then I would see how that option would be best for them.<br>  Just not for me personally, because I know I'm a good mom.|`|4ea01eb67de198f5298b06e46769030aaa	I believe that adoption should be an option for everyone.<br>  Many people want to have their own children because they think that they'll have a greater connection with children born to them. But that connection can also come through adoption. The connection comes through love, not birth.|`|ee7335f3bdae606bbfe534bef63fe2e0aa	I don't know.  I would love to adopt a baby but as I am single it just won't happen.  I just want a child and I don't care how old it is or what color or age.  I want to be a mom and know I would give a child a good home.|`|2451MT2Haa	I dont quite understand the context of your question, so im going to help you as well as i can.<br>  <br>  *If you are refferring to those who did not intentionally get pregnant and choose alternatives other than adoption it could be for many reasons:<br>  -It could be too hard on them to give a baby away that they carried and gave birth too.<br>  -they wish to raise their baby themselves<br>  -they do not want to go through with the pregnancy at all, or may even be in danger if they do (sorry to say but as a teen i knew many girls who's parents would have beat them or put them out if they were pregnant)<br>  <br>  *If you are reffering to choosing to adopt rather than to get pregnant themselves<br>  -I personally look forward to being pregnant, it is just something that i have always wanted to do. It is an experience that is totally natural and rewarding. However i also wish to adopt a child in need one day as well.<br>  -People are adopting more these days than in the past accually, Its almost dare i say it, a "fad" nowadays. <br>  -Many people just cant deal with the wait and the process of adopting. In some places, especially the US the wait on the adoption list can range up to 8 years for a baby.|`|a8Pq2Lmdaa	Why do you think that everyone wants a baby, no matter what?<br>  I know a lot of couples that do not have or want children.<br>  <br>  I do not know why people do not use adoption more.  I think that people do not want a part of them out there somewhere so they do not want to give their child up.<br>  Also with the advanced in fertility treatments more and more couple can have babies and do not need to use adoption.|`|rdpZrBc9aa	Because so many teens want someone to love them, and they think a baby is the answer.  Also, they are clueless as to the time, money,  and WORK involved in taking care of a baby, and they can't really imagine being committed to this child for longer than they've even been alive!|`|AKJwWqdZaa	In what context? Not an option for pregnant women? Or not an option for people wanting to become parents?<br>  <br>  I'm an adoptive mom of 2, so it was an option for me and is obviously an option for a great many other people as well.<br>  <br>  But it's not for everybody.|`|33c0b6060f319b3537f5ec8348f23f45aa	I think a lot of people believe its a lot harder and more expensive then it really is. I have had a great experience adopting. I would recommend it to anyone.|`|k1uUjz9aaa	people shouldn't be stealing other people's babies.

But hey, if she's getting help from them, then that's less of a bill for the taxpayers!<br>  <br>  ETA:  That's great, a thumbs down.  Seriously, would YOU rather be paying for them?  I know I wouldn't.  And let's face it...she has 14 children...she's going to need the help for the children's sake.  I'm fully against what she did, but like I said, would you rather be footing the bill?|`|c3MFIbeUaa	Are  you against a group trying to help out a bad situation?<br>   What is done is done, let it fall where it may on  the doctor and the mother.<br>   However suffer not onto the children.|`|1jwbQaZTaa	ugh... i dont know but i hope they realllyy know what they're doing... only encouraging ignorant women to procreate without thought because "there is help for you"<br>  <br>  bull$hit!

Sorry I don't have an answer. I just wanted to say that this is a good question!!
g9vw4ovGaa	No honey, there is no way to prevent it, they don't make baby rogaine. It will grow back, my daughters hair is gorgeous now. She had a head full enough to put a bow in, and about 6 months old went bald, and a few weeks later had another full head of hair, a different color and curly as ever. This time of year they need hats on anyway!|`|AA10381258	Nope. Luckily, it grows in prettier than ever when it grows back.|`|alssEcoKaa	Safety Dance - Men without Hats.<br>  Your welcome!|`|aJLx0nhNaa	Absolutely nothing you can do.  The first few months of a baby's hair are so weird.  It can look truly ridiculous.  But most of them lose their birth hair.  My son was born with a full head of spiky black hair.  He lost it all.  But it grows back, though sometimes it's a different color and texture.|`|IGcS9K62aa	No. It'll grow back even better than before. It'll be fuller and softer. =)|`|c4e0f4398cbb2577d252628c76d0781baa	No worries mama.  It's gonna happen regardless.  My daughter was also born with alot of hair.  She never lost all of it (she's now 7 months) but she did lose some of it on the side/back of her head where she slept, but never went bald in those areas, it just thinned out a bit.  <br>  <br>  I can see the new hair growing in and it's a tad bit lighter in color.  She was actually born with black hair and now it's all brown, but the new hair is light brown.|`|SxgOy9uPaa	NO ITS normal for this to happen..Grows back thicker & softer,who'll wonder what the hell you were worried about..Enjoy your baby..|`|dywC7NTKaa	o____o|`|ME62Mtv4aa	no but it is totally normal
R47Bj9Q6aa	i watched scary movies when i was little<br>  my mom would let me watch it as long as it wasnt all gory ,blood and guts, nudity or i was scared and didnt want to watch it anymore<br>  i turned out fine :)|`|prqrQcd1aa	I personally do not let my children watch these kinds of movies because they scare them, and my oldest has an over active imagination to begin with... i don't need her getting any idea's.<br>  I on the other hand watched scary movies from a very early age..the only one that DID ever scare me WAS the Exorcist, and i was 4 years old. I still remember clearly seeing her head spin and running from the room screaming. I'm 27 years old now. So i have mixed feelings on this. If the child can handle it, fine, if not...then no it's not a good idea. But once again, i personally do not let my kids watch them.|`|SlBsJ3NRaa	My 3 year old likes scary movies.  I am a fan and have been watching them since before I can even remember. I agree (mostly) with your cousin, however there's way too much bad language in the Exorcist. My 3 year old caught part of the movie Mirrors at my moms house, and he was mad when she wouldn't rewind a gory, graphic scene so he could see it again. Ugh.<br>  <br>  No, we don't watch many scary movies while they are awake, but I'm not worried about them catching bits and pieces at times. They know it's make-up, and I have even showed them "making of" videos so they know the people are getting paid to play dead.|`|0nIwKd5Uaa	I think when kids are at an age with they can tell the difference between what's real and what's not then and only then should they be allowed to watch scary movies.<br>  <br>  My little girl who is 4 stayed the night at a friends house, and not thinking i didn't tell them she is not allowed to watch scary movies. Well they allow their child to watch so that night they watched a scary movie. Now 3 months later my little girl is still scared to walk into a room that doesn't have the light on. For 2 weeks she slept on the floor in my room because she was too scared to sleep in her own room. <br>  <br>  A couple friends of mine allow their children to watch scary movies as well, and at the time of watching the movie the children are fine, but the effects are shown later of why it's not a good idea. They have nightmares, are scared to go outside at night even to the car, and have fears of things like the closet, basement, etc etc.|`|Kl1h5dCaaa	I admit, I have a very sick taste in Movies. My favourites are full of murder, and gore. The movies you've described in my eyes are very soft horror.<br>  <br>  I however don't let our Sons watch them, they are my night time pleasure. My Husband doesn't even like them, so I watch them all by my lonesome.<br>  I think the *worst* movie my Boys have seen is The Green Mile, and it was only by accident that they saw anything.<br>  I do see their point, but I don't feel it is appropriate for Children at 5yo to be watching Exorcist. You just never know what will effect their fragile minds.|`|X0ubZnPjaa	when i was younger i used to love scary movies ..until it was time for bed and all the lights were out and i would be terrified.<br>  <br>  i would let my kids watch scary movies as long as they could take the after effect.|`|qYZ2QFlbaa	well, how many good horror flicks are out there with no cussing, nudity or sexual content? I think you about named it :) I don't know. I think it would really depend on the individual child.|`|fa95a107c51b407e83a3e95fe81a0e10aa	I think they are too young for that kind of movie.  Halloween movies specifically made for kids are a different story, but not the ones you are talking about|`|kFHwzBG7aa	It just depends on the kid... some kids can handle it, some can't.  I could.  I have a friend who's little girl watched "I am Legend" and had nightmares for weeks.|`|jvW3a5GYaa	I don't see what good can come from putting that kind of stuff in a child's head.|`|jCy0J2ueaa	i dont think this is a good idea|`|SrcoG7JRaa	It's fine.<br>  I agree - so long as there's no explicit nudity or sexuality, it's fine.<br>  If they have nightmares, so be it. That's what parents are for - they're there to be there when the nightmares happen and assuage fears. Not totally block scary things from a childs mind forever.<br>  <br>  I think occasional scary movies are good for children. Obviously, I'm not on board with second graders being hardcore slasher film aficionados, but watching one on occasion is fine. My sister saw Sleepy Hollow when she was 7 and still laughs her head off (pun intended) every time.<br>  <br>  Movies allow them the experience of being a bit frightened without any real danger. It teaches them how to cope with fear and how to manage it. How are they going to learn that if they never get scared with things that can't hurt them, and how are they supposed to know how to react when something frightens them later on that CAN hurt them?<br>  <br>  I really think learning how to manage fear by exposing yourself to things that are scary but not threatening is an essential part of growing up.|`|ze9Pah8Gaa	when i was little i was fascinated with horror movies, i watched them all the time but i had incredible nightmares from them. Its like people slowing down to see if anyone got hurt in an accident, we are struck by images like that. i think certain horror movies if not too gory are a good way to introduce kids to the fact of death and "bad people" u know?|`|Icbz7tdiaa	well its rlly the parents choice<br>  im 10 almost 11<br>  im female<br>  my mom lets me watch all those movies<br>  if they scare me she doesnt let me<br>  soooo....<br>  i think its OK<br>  if my kid requests in seeing horror movies<br>  and he /she knows it WILL be scary<br>  their fine<br>  if they do get scared during the movie i;d say "ok sweetheart 2 choices ....1 is i turn it off and 2 is u knoits a FAKE and made for ppl to watch for a scared sorta thrill"|`|Iek7D2hOaa	I used to watch horror movies when I was really young - They scared me, but I wasn't terrified and had nightmares. I didn't take notice of the cussing, nudity, or blood and gore. Maybe I'm just kind of insensitive to those things, and always have been. I'm fourteen, almost fifteen, and my parents made me watch the Exorcist because they thought it was just one of those movies you have to see. <br>  I'd be more worried about kid's making Miley Cyrus a role model than them watching a horror movie. ;\|`|ArYvBhkpaa	Personally,I wouldn't let mine watch it when they were young.I wouldn't want them to get the idea,and be terrified.People want their kids to grow up so fast.Maybe when they were 11 or 12,but not younger than that.|`|AA12221392	I would never let my child /children watch scary movies under the age  of  9-10.  And at that point they would be on a see how it goes basis. <br>  I would never allow a 4 year old to see the movie exorcist, I remember watching this movie, not that young, but I am still scared to watch that movie, it is just chilling. <br>  <br>  My kids don't really care for scary movies that much. My 18 year old, refuses to watch them , she watched one at 13, and has never watched one again, now the boys like them sometimes. <br>  My 9 year old daughter no, she can't watch scary movies because she  gets scared very easily on somethings. <br>  <br>  I think it is by the kids and parents discretion.

eya1WDS4aa	I dont think the rule has changed...i think your dr is on drugs lol. A baby needs formula or breast milk until they are 12 months and until they are eatting full complete meals. I would deffently ignore the dr on this one lol. thats kinda crazy. I could see maybe giving her milk here and there but not for a feeding.|`|s6qgkfLxaa	dont. it will cause diarrhea or a really bad yeast infection....|`|yCwPxulYaa	I have not heard this and I know my ped still says 12 months at the earliest.  I think that I would just ignore that one and do what you want.|`|KUxEBQuYaa	what exactly is "homo milk"???|`|g9vw4ovGaa	Honey, you are her mother, don't worry about what all those baby book thumpers have to say! I put my daughter on whole milk in a sippy cup at 6 months old, and now she is 16 months old and perfectly healthy, never even had an ear infection. At six months old she started to get teeth so I started feeding her table food, probably another no no, but you're her mother, you know her, not her doctors, not anyone else, if you can tell she's not getting full on anything else, try it, what would it hurt? Really, what did women do back in the day before formula, when they had another baby by the time the first was 9 months old? Cow's milk! I truly don't understand what the big deal is about anyway... yeah yeah their stomachs aren't fully formed, but they tell you to feed them processed baby food, and like to shoot them up with some man made shots, so why not do what God made for us in the first place, follow your gut, not your doctor or books, because they don't know her like you do!|`|aJLx0nhNaa	Last I heard it was still 12 months.  Weird.  Your mom would agree with the doctor, because that is old school advice.<br>  <br>  How old is this doctor?  Is he or she "up to date" on other things?  I would question this, it's just so not what the advice is now.|`|537fb036f0d7f523891b1281ae7d57d1aa	My understanding is that the body's digestive system wasnt developed until 12 months to break down the proteins in what Im guessing you mean to be homogenized (sp?) cows milk.<br>  <br>  This could cause a tummy ache :(   Like when I ate way too much pizza tonight.
fboC1N7gaa	I like Lyra and Piper the best.  Other names that I like are:<br>  <br>  Loughlin/Lofflin<br>  Lyla<br>  Delia<br>  Ginger<br>  Adria<br>  Delancey<br>  Arabella<br>  Kerryn<br>  Meegan<br>  Moyra<br>  Taryn<br>  Lola<br>  Bryll|`|b23bf2ec1da77ecae7c9432931bc6a27aa	Isadora Maria when you say it all together, it has a wonderful almost Italian ring! "ee-sa-dor-a ma-ree-a della robbia"  I know its long but its definitely not common and its very feminine and unique. Good Luck!|`|oYmZUO8Caa	Piper. Yumi would be...brutal.|`|Vm7vpqsmaa	i dont really care for any of your names<br>  <br>  terran <br>  rowan<br>  elliot|`|KA2BdkM3aa	Yumi looks like it should be pronounced yummy and I hope that's not what you're going for. Piper brings to mind a spunky little red head girl-like the wendy's girl...go with Lyra!|`|WiGS7mEpaa	Piper is awful|`|jHDeIPEfaa	Piper is my favorite out of the three listed.|`|Z6NlNRLoaa	Those names are totally ridiculous.
FfGHHhqBaa	i remember one time i was with a guy i did not want to have kids with (thank god i didn't) LOL but planned parenthood took care of it for free and i got the pill right there|`|Ir9jGOo2aa	Planned parenthood does have it:<br>  Price ranges for our emergency contraception (morning after pill) services are: <br>  emergency contraception (morning after pill) - $28 <br>  office visit for emergency contraception - $40-$45 <br>  Walgreens also has it for about 43 bucks. You have to be 18 an show an ID and yes a male can pick it up. (at walgreens at least)|`|cqW3NhqVaa	Yes, they have it.<br>  <br>  Where I live its around $27, and you have to be 18 without a parent<br>  or prescription to get it. I'm almost positive he can get it, if he is over<br>  18 as well.|`|F8KmTbqjaa	Yes they do, but you can get it at any pharmacy now over the counter no questions asked!  There is no age limit on who can get it.    Anybody can pick it up and I am not sure how expensive it is.  I would guess no more than $20.<br>  <br>  EDIT:  Its different in different states I guess, since like 9 people put 1 million different answers!  I am sure your pretty confused!!!!!|`|vKEYa8aeaa	no but they can give you a prescription for it and you can get it from any pharmacy. according to their commercials and websites you have to be 18 to get it without a prescription..that way you can just go to walmart pharmacy or CVS...anything like that. if you are u18 you will need to go to the ER, regular doc, or planned parenthood, clinic, etc. to get a prescription. no a guy cannot pick it up for his gf, you dont wait for it, you either go str8 to the pharm if youre over 18 or to the clinic/doc/etc u18 and they give you the script then you go straight to the pharmacy. if you have tricare [parents or you in the military] its covered by insurance, im not sure about other insurances though. <br>  <br>  <br>  good luck<br>  <br>  EDIT: whoever gave me a thumbsdown - well....seeing as i went with a friend of mine to planned parenthood and they said they DONT have it there...and gave her a script to get it from the pharmacy, i would think im pretty right in my answer.|`|LDYAGJCxaa	Yes, they have it, and it's usually around $50 or $60.  You do have to be 18 to get it without a prescription, but as they have doctors there, they may be able to write one for you...you'll have to ask.  And yes, you have to be the one to pick it up.  CVS and Walgreen's also carry PlanB.<br>  <br>  <br>  ETA:  Oh, and yes, you can get it right there.  That's the idea...the less time that passes the better.  :)|`|ZSSUfSXwaa	I dont know... Im from Canada and here you just get it over the counter at any drugstore...<br>  <br>  BUT the drug is only effective if taken during the first 72 hrs after having  unprotected sex, and its effectiveness decreases with time.. like it's more effective 90 or so % during the first 24 hrs and the percentage goes down as the time passes.  So if you ahd sex a while ago... it's not going to do you any good. Just so you know. <br>  Good Luck! And remember you can always buy a pack of condoms!!!|`|6L9jJnchaa	The girl has to get it.  If you sign up for the card they have...which is kind of like insurance provided by the state, they will give you a pack free when they give you your birth control (which you should be on anyway!)|`|1jwbQaZTaa	i got mine at walgreens. you have to be 18 and its like 75 dollars i think.
nG9nxMySaa	He could, but I wouldn't assume so based on this conversation. I think you're reading too much into it.|`|xgWf3SKxaa	either that or hes a really good friend... i thought you digged your teacher lol|`|yb9ufdiPaa	i don't think so. just flirting?|`|eR3vBsJWaa	hard to say<br>  <br>  because its just text and i know people that do that<br>  <br>  i'd say its a 50 50 chance but it could be different you should look  at how he acts with you in person|`|EZyHOht7aa	I don't see anything unusual. Just a typical conversation between two immature children.|`|Q7vMH7akaa	I agree with the other responses, I think you're reading too much into it. He's just being a playful friend, I see this stuff quite often.|`|wNdB8Gjyaa	Possibly.<br>  <br>  or you're just a generally attractive girl to flirt with.<br>  <br>  Which I suppose is still a good place to be - if you want him to like you, that is.|`|QyxLVNCWaa	No. Just virtual flirting.|`|EWFtQNSdaa	Er no I dont think so.|`|ME62Mtv4aa	no well maybe but it seems he's just being playful in a friendly way|`|esZmuO89aa	yup he does lol|`|oWVUiDEMaa	friend|`|qjEx8esgaa	i would say yes, he does like you|`|cWP73qEsaa	umm how old are u ?|`|BWYhw5EZaa	i'd say he likes you AT LEAST a little. if not more.<br>  <br>  or he's just a big flirt? do you notice that he flirts strongly with other girls too?|`|sePLvA8Gaa	WOW I think he has a kinder garden crush on you!|`|yfR1b1Q3aa	... no.
2CYfjPA6aa	Lucy Isaiah Locks- Don't like it<br>  Lucy Cherice Locks- It's alright<br>  Lucy Lovett Locks- I like this one<br>  Lucy Kay Locks- No<br>  Lucy Cheshire Locks-I like it somewhat<br>  Lucy Bowie Locks- I like the Bowie it's unique<br>  <br>  Favorite would have to be Lucy Bowie because it's cute and unique.|`|2LB3bWdpaa	All of the suggestions you got in your last question and this is what you have come up with? WOW! I don't like any very well at all. <br>  <br>  Lucy Isaiah- maybe for a transgender. If you want to honor your father then wait until you have a boy. Or play around with Isaiah to make it more girly. maybe Lucy Isis? IMO Isaiah doesnt sound good on a girl at all.<br>  Lucy Chesire- I'm seeing a big fat cat<br>  Lucy Lovett- Love it Locks just doesn't sound right<br>  Lucy Kay- decent but boring<br>  Lucy Cherice- the best out of your picks<br>  Lucy Bowie- I'm seeing a scary man in tight clothes running around a labirynth.|`|Hb3MK9eeaa	Isaiah-9/10<br>  Cherice-5/10<br>  Lovett-2/10<br>  Kay-8/10<br>  Cheshire-5/10<br>  Bowie-7/10<br>  <br>  I think that Lucy Kay Locks sounds the best, although I would choose Lucy Isaiah in order to honor your father.  Isaiah is a nice name and really doesn't sound badly with Lucy Locks.  Good Luck!!|`|tBx1M0g9aa	I honestly like <br>  <br>  Lucy Cheshire Locks<br>  <br>  Lucy Cherice Locks<br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  if you could plz help me on this question|`|ElayGlHPaa	I think the Lucy Lovett Locks is the best.<br>  <br>  Isaiah- 0/10<br>  Cherice- 3/10<br>  Lovett-10/10<br>  Kay- 6/10<br>  Cheshire- 4/10<br>  Bowie 1/10|`|Vm7vpqsmaa	Lucy Isaiah Locks it would be really awesome to honor your dad and i love the names lucy|`|25Ys3DEPaa	Why would you ever consider Isaiah for a girl????<br>  <br>  None of these are doing anything for me..but Lucy Kay Locks has the most potential....|`|a4rhTUeyaa	Lucy Kay Locks|`|NURPgKHYaa	I don't like "Lucy" by any name. Lucy sounds like the name of someone who is out of their mind. sorry!|`|WiGS7mEpaa	This kid is gonna be in trouble.....Lucy Loves Locks|`|jHDeIPEfaa	I really don't care for any of these but Lucy Kay sounds best.|`|4scMHGGvaa	I love Lucy Lovett Locks. It may look alittle funny because of all of the L's but i think it is the prettiest.|`|fboC1N7gaa	I like Lucy Cherise Locks the best.  If you want to make her middle name after your father you could make it Isadora, Isbella, Isabelle, Isla.|`|oYmZUO8Caa	Lucy Bowie.|`|Z6NlNRLoaa	Lucy Kay|`|Xi5Jno6haa	I think Lucy Kay sounds the best. Good luck.
FfGHHhqBaa	if you ask they should give you something in your IV before the eppie. after the baby is born they give you motrin and vicodin.|`|d1df7701087311fcf1008982d372a396aa	Demerol. Or have a c-section. Also they give you painkillers after the birth, but you just went thru labor, no pain after will feel that bad.|`|HEdGGmkhaa	I would take a doula with you, thats the best thing you could have!|`|7d84621e89c49bcba037226d3361c90baa	You need to discuss all these things with your doctor.  Talk to him about it NOW, so he can help put a plan in place for you during your labor.<br>  <br>  When I was in labor, they did give me something that relaxed me and helped me sleep, because I was in labor for 47 1/2 hours.  After I'd been in labor for about 27 hours, they gave me something because I hadn't slept in all that time.  I don't remember what it was called, but I really liked it.  It felt REALLY good.  lol.|`|Rf2r23sYaa	Maybe you should have a planned C section, Plenty of hospitals will do that for you if you need it.
joWMXiZUaa	1st rule , DONT BE A ***** , 2nd rule, ,LAY OFF THE MAKEUP NO MATTER HOW UGLY YOU GET, seeing thos fake cherry cheaks or acne under makeup ,or just makeup under the light just is all like not cool....you even wonder (wait what do they really look like, ehh ...no thanks, and just assuming the absolute worst) and not to be an *** but when girls think "oh he wont notice im wearing makeup ill just look better" we do,.....thats about all i got tho,so if u knew that already sry 4 wastin ur time :-) and good luck, just chat around, you'll win some you'll loose some.|`|EGiIcGOiaa	BE OUTGOING!!! please its all you need lol trust me!!<br>  ok so there was this guy that i thought was UGLY!!! and i was like eww NEVERNEVERNEVERR!!! (im kindaa pretty not gonna lie. the way it is)<br>  and thenn i talked to him and saw what an AMAZING personality he had and i went HEAD OVER HEELS and he used to be the one crushing on me. NOW i cant get him out of my mind and i think hes the hottest guy no joke! REMEMEBER ITS PERSONALITY|`|oMAyaFZAaa	Confidence... Be you... He can take it or leave it....I wouldn't try to do this big makeover especially when it's not really "you", your style.|`|8cd6d1064a8d6379febc6914e867a26baa	Have a good personality.<br>  Seriously.<br>  If a girl is amazingly gorgeous, but shes a *****, a guy will NOT want to be with her.<br>  <br>  Just try something new with your hair, some new make-up.<br>  And remember your positive additude, and a smile.|`|Dl9a08Rxaa	put on a cowboy hat and get out a lasso<br>  just kidding dont do that<br>  <br>  wear clothes that are flattering and that you feel good in<br>  act confident if you feel like a "not so pretty girl"  people are going to see you that way if you go out and tell yourself that your hot and going to have a goodtime people are going to think that you are from your vibe<br>  have good posture dont slouch its one of the first things they teach at modelling school<br>  <br>  and just look around there are lots of guys out there and you just need to find the right one
g9vw4ovGaa	I felt my baby at 14 weeks, it feels kinda like gas bubbles, but really light ones. Hard to explain, but when you feel something you've never felt before, that is your baby. Don't listen to books, every pregnancy is completly different. No one knows it all! Listen to your body, know one knows it as well as you do.|`|AA11582608	Oh yes it is extremely possible, and only because I began to feel my baby move also this past mid to late August.  I'm now 8 months.  However, keep in mind what your book said "Usually starts" that doesn't mean it can't happen earlier.  As long as there is no pain and you feel relaxed enjoy the little bundles of movement.  he/she at 14 weeks has lots of space inside to move around.  <br>  <br>  Take care and enjoy|`|Ir9jGOo2aa	Funny you ask that because Im 18 weeks and had my dr appt today.  I havent felt my baby yet.  My dr said its normal but he has women say they feel it as early as 14 weeks, and he said I don't know how.  So im assuming you shouldnt be feeling your baby's movement.  Maybe your due date is off...|`|GPdUBsaqaa	Anything's possible - it's more likely if you were pretty skinny before the pregnancy - if you're larger it's harder to feel the flutters.|`|Pjqx3sIZaa	this is possible, but it probably is gas sometimes, because being pregnant can give you lots of gas.|`|04kOtcGgaa	i felt my son at 12 weeks.|`|LJkPRqN0aa	it can start as early as 12 weeks.. so yay for you!!! :)|`|53QQ9KXEaa	I think it's possible... I started feeling my baby at around 16 weeks. It's so exciting how the kicks get more and more pronounced :)|`|cWP73qEsaa	yay!! u felt your baby. it is very normal i felt my 2nd baby move at 14 weeks and my first at 16 weeks my 3rd i felt around 18 weeks but thats exactly how it feels at first like lil butterfly fluttering and flicking then you'll feel light tapping then u will feel the big kicks lol congrats!|`|FfGHHhqBaa	oh ya, if you are thin, with my first i was 12-14w sometime in there and now im 18w and just started feeling movement because my first stretched everything out lol|`|pR4nLjyRaa	Yes it is possible, especially if you are very thin. My friend felt her baby move at 14 weeks and she is 5'7" and 126 lbs. Now shes 15 wks and can feel him or her stretch out :)<br>  Congrats :)|`|hYRYO5GYaa	yep i felt little flutters at 13 weeks!
S4DNQkFraa	It could just be allot of water weight. Every woman is different, I wouldn't worry too much!! Good luck!!|`|uQc4UA2Caa	im not good with weigh conversion- when i got pregnant i weighed 81 kilos now i am nearly 7 & half months pregnant and i have gained about 16 kilos. i think thats more than 35 pounds! im only having one baby. i try to walk for at least 20 mins a day and i dont eat fast food more than once a week|`|cO9sxO9raa	Don't worry girly, it's probably water weight. I gained almost 15 pounds in one month during my 2nd trimester and my doctor said to not be concerned. You should speak to your doctor though just to make sure all is going well. =)|`|d1df7701087311fcf1008982d372a396aa	i would say water weight, very common during pregnancy, but if you still have doubts consult it with your OBGYN.|`|YuqTcSSDaa	it could be twins, but if your gaining that fast, go to the doctor. It could be serious.|`|35kVNi5oaa	make sure you get enough to eat so your baby can get what it needs.
KNxs4PrZaa	i have, i loved them, they come in cool flavors, i did notice they helped a bit with morning sickness but i dont think there was anything special about the pops, if you want something cheaper and simpler just try plain pops or mints, i think it was just the sucking on something flavorful that helped get over my quesiness at the moment.|`|oybsfVqPaa	Best thing to do is to lay down and chew some crackers before you get up.<br>  If you're sick when you wake up, try it before you get out of bed. Try not to move around much if you're feeling nauseated.<br>  <br>  There are other home remedies, but that always worked for my friends. :)|`|gGMERRkgaa	I didnt try either with my daughter, I just had crackers next to my bed so I could eat some before I got up.|`|5axGfFofaa	i tried them and they sucked!  tasted awful and made me gag even more...do not waste your $$$.  crackers worked better.|`|QJDbG1F1aa	I bought some just in case but haven't had to use them yet. When I purchased them a lady behind me in line said that they do work. They have ginger in them which doctor have been using for years to alleviate morning sickness.
7rCeCVl2aa	It just dried up if you are not needing to supply. It comes back with each child. =)|`|KmC0K59taa	If you are producing some colustrum right now, it's because of your current pregnancy.  It's not actually milk yet.  Milk is produced when every woman gives birth.  It comes in a few days after the baby is born.  When the woman decides to breastfeed, the milk is being taken out by the baby or breast pump and your body makes more.  It works on a suppy and demand basis.  When a woman does not breastfeed, the milk will dry up.  Your breasts will stop producing milk because it's not being used.|`|c271e0d140cbe1902cabe87b6f0e3485aa	A mother will produce milk as long as the baby is drinking it, so if she decides not to breast feed her baby, then the milk will dry up.<br>  <br>  If she decides to breast feed the next baby, then there will be milk as long as the baby is drinking it, the sucking stimulates the breast to produce milk.<br>  <br>  Good Luck with your baby and with breast feeding - you go girl - you can do it!|`|ilrSUcMvaa	u keep producing milk as long as u r still feeding. well thats the theory anyway. some women dry up earlier. when u slow the feeding the supply starts to go away. i think they make sure the baby is getting enough by weighing it all the time.
ULo8Cwdfaa	depends on where you live really, you can always waitress it's different than fast food, umm any little stores around that will hire teenagers. grocery stores. I don't know your age or where you live so I don't know.|`|ThE1X2NHaa	Why don't u try something u like? <br>  <br>  for exmaple i like fashion so i work at a fashion boutique.|`|53Yp0Zsmaa	I tutor.....<br>  depends on ur age.<br>  if u know enough about fashion and stuff, try a sales women, like a good looking store girl tht helps you pic out ur outfit.<br>  fast food joint stinks.|`|I0g24Jmkaa	I work at a dry cleaners, puts bread on the table.|`|7mKNHl2zaa	im going thorough the same problem. and mcdonalds sucks! <br>  <br>  safe way will hire teens though
VtUWgOJlaa	You have picked gorgeous names! i dont know if that adjective fits there oops, anyways, nice choices i have some planned names to. So far im thinking for the girls- Rilo, Taylor and Charlie and for the boys- Oliver and Levi. Im weird and i think guy names for girls are pretty awesome but those are great!|`|B7nqTcttaa	I like Elizabeth Rose without the Hailey and I would prefer it as Lucas Xavier. All nice names though :)<br>  I have a daughter called Paris D.D. The Paris is sentimental as we went to Paris during the pregnancy and The D.D. is the first initial of both of the grandmothers!<br>  i am currently pregnant and we are going to go with Avalon Larke if it's a girl (Larke is my sisters name but I absolutly love it too) and if it's a boy we like Oscar Nev (Nev after my poppy who passed away).|`|pZ4VxGrtaa	I have one daughter, her name is Kaylee Addison.<br>  <br>  We're TTC our second and these are some names we like:<br>  <br>  girls:<br>  <br>  Kadence Angela (angela after my cousin that passed)<br>  Kyndall LeAnn (leann after me)<br>  Kinsley Faith<br>  <br>  <br>  boys:<br>  <br>  Colt Wyatt (wyatt after my grandmother, wynell)<br>  Conner Levi<br>  Caden Tucker<br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  From your list my faves are:<br>  *Hailey<br>  *Nicole<br>  *Madison<br>  *Callum<br>  *Jordan|`|Am54a7c0aa	I like your choices.<br>  <br>  So far, my partner and I have come up with:<br>  Amillia Maree Seranna.<br>  Cullyn Eric Cornelius.<br>  William Edmund Marshall.|`|u8slDDkLaa	Romeo Jiro<br>  Tariq Justin<br>  Gabriel Malik<br>  <br>  Tehya Kiyko<br>  Helena Elizabeth<br>  Selena Dakota<br>  Maiyara Isabella<br>  Sakura Jenna-lynn|`|mbfXOPRXaa	I like:<br>  Emmalyn Nichole <br>  Elisabeth Kay<br>  Luke Elijah<br>  Tyler Cohen<br>  Callum James<br>  Jordan Xavier|`|ee17TXtcaa	Girls:<br>  Charlie Janee<br>  Kaydee Lee<br>  Jayd Samantha<br>  <br>  Boys:<br>  Lucas Dylan <br>  Kaleb Jay|`|N89HLv92aa	I like Esme Grace for a girl and Caden Kale and Easton Kale for boys.|`|bFu2qQEvaa	haha one of my best very best friends name is Victoria Nicole and her daughters name is Lynn. Anyway. I am not a fan of the name Hailey but i love the middle names, and your other names are very cute. I really like Callum James. But my advice is that no matter what people tell you as to whether or not they like the names, is that if you really like that name then use it. <br>  <br>  I have 3 boys <br>  Asher Gabriel (6 almost 7)<br>  Joshua Hunter (4)<br>  Rowan Isaac (2) <br>  and I'm pregnant with twins, a boy and a girl (hopefully, Rowan was supposed to be a girl. So we'll see.) We're fairly sure our sons name will be Noah (middle name undecided, i have a question up if anyone has ideas) and our little girl will probably either be Lucy or Lily.|`|dZFJ2ZUcaa	Dont do two middle names. I like Nicole Victoria. I have two kids and one is on the way. My two are twin girls named Andrea Eliza and Mori Isabella. I love those names I think they are perfect for twin girls.

Bullies like to bother you and until you stand up for yourself he will continue to bother you until you do. Tell this bully with out the swear words that your not interested and that he should find someone who is.  He is harrasing you and you should talk to someone who could help like a principal.|`|M8Q7KsYHaa	First off if your a grade schooler, you need to cut out the cussing.

KihffCc5aa	He's just spoiled.  He doesn't have to work for food, or work for ingesting whatever the family is eating.  Everyone raises their children different, while I side with you, that it is unsual and wrong.  Please don't let this be a deciding factor in a family discourse.  It's more important to have your brother in your life, and his family.  Just go with the flow, and realize what your brother is doing for his babies is different.  Keep the ties with your brother, you'll welcome them later in life!<br>  <br>  Colleen|`|0RCGy3OOaa	look.. the kid has GOT to star eating real food. if he gets pampered now he'll get pampered throughut his whole life. just make him eat. he's two years old.. hhe'll understand that if he's hungry he'll jus have to eat what he's got|`|YuqTcSSDaa	LLL recomends breast feeding as long as possible. There is nothing really wrong with it, but it is not ideal for him to not be on solids. He should be getting nutrition from other sources. breast milk does not have the essentials after baby is a year. He really should be eating other foods.|`|xyI7PRuhaa	it's not from breastfeeding.  I know lots of toddlers who still nurse, but eat solids.

YLXpwqceaa	It took me 19 days from the date of conception to get a positive result...I've also read this in my pregnancy magazine.<br>  <br>  It does take a few days to attach itself to the wall.<br>  <br>  Hope it helps!|`|L1qNhDMzaa	Well I found out with a strong positive on my pregnancy test at 3 wks, 6 days. I didnt believe it, so I took three more thru out the day, and yep I was preggers. But most women get positives around 4 and 5 weeks, and surprisingly some women wont get positives til they're 6-8 weeks. Hope I helped :)|`|xD1LbRi4aa	i concieved on june 20th and took a test on july 6th and got a positive result and im 37 weeks pregnant now... so for me it didnt take long!|`|BhYDTUrWaa	you want to be preg so bad just keep on trying to u get were you want to be at|`|uQc4UA2Caa	yes it takes a while to attatch itself as the egg needs to divide/multiply its cells enough before it sinks into the uterus t grow. <br>  im not sure about the times for possitive tests but i got a possitive when i was 11 days late. everyones hormones are different so for some it may take longer to get a possitive result|`|W1p6LetFaa	Yes, it take a few days (5-10) for the fertilized egg to travel down your fallopian tubes and actually attach itself to your uterine lining.  At this point, the test will still be negative because the hormone levels are too low.  Most pregnancy tests will not give you a positive until AFTER you are late for your period, so at least 14 days after you conceived.  And even then, the hormone produced when you are pregnant may be too weak to be detected for another week or two, hence why it took me until 6 days AFTER my period to get my first positive.  It's very normal.
Yn6pM2Xyaa	im 14 days late and still no period and no positive pregnancy test.  i went to doctor today and she didnt seem to worried, saying it just happens sometimes for no good reason but at the same time also seemed to think there was a chance I could be pregnant as well.  I got sent for a blood test and will know results in 2-3 business days.  after that if I still dont have my period and if the results are negative she wants to wait until I've missed an entire period cycle and then for me t come back in and move on from that point (im guessing ultrasound at that point)  I've heard stories of people who didnt get positives until ultrasounds!!!  crazy!  *crossing fingers for positive pregnancy results*|`|i9M0U9Meaa	when i was 4 days late i took a HPT and it was negative, i waited another 3 days and went t the doctor and found out i was, in some women your hormones just aren't active enough and some tests cant detect pregnancy unless your 2 months or more.|`|hYRYO5GYaa	yep happen to me! i took one it was neg, then 5 days later it was positive, its because it take 7-10 days to connect to the wall|`|qCj3BzWZaa	I was 2 weeks late when i finally got a positive test, all the rest were negative.|`|W1p6LetFaa	Yuppers!  I didn't get my first positive test until my period was 6 days late.|`|xwJGMf93aa	With my first, I took a test when I was 2 days late and it was negative. Then when I was 5 days late I went to the Dr. and had a blood test done and it was positive. After I found out I was, I dug the first test out of the trash and sure enough, it was positive but it was very, very, very faint and wasn't there when I had trashed it. I guess it just took it a long time, even longer than the instructions suggest.|`|AA11582608	Aboslutely as is the case with my second child DreamAngel, I went to the doctor after about 7 days late.  And it showed no signs of pregancy.  However, by my 3rd week, I was vomiting and had all kinds of headaches.  Surely enough I was was pregnant!!!!  <br>  <br>  Sometimes it is better to wait 2-4 weeks after a missed period or even your second missed period for pregancy, to show up or the HCG hormones.  To show up in your urine.|`|W4J7Ary0aa	Yes this did happen to me   I was to have my period around June 15 2008. But it never came. I took a test 3 days later and it said neg. My family had a family reunion on the 19th and so we drove from Fort Collins to Albuquerque New Mexico. I can always handle the drive, but I felt kinda sick the whole drive this time. We were there till July 1st. I was sick on the way back as well. On the 2nd I took a test and it said positive. I freaked out cuz I am 18 (till April) so I waited till the next day and got the same answer. I drove to my bf's house and told him. <br>  He wanted me to test again on the 4th and got the same answer. We went to the Alpha center for a check up found out i was 8 wks. I told my parents 3 days later. Now he is living with me at my parents house.|`|smcWIZxPaa	this happened to me.  i got my november period, missed my december period but tested negative, so i was really late so i tested again the first week of january and it was positive.  the first few weeks of pregnancy rarely show a positive result|`|WmKjeUELaa	Sorry, but no.  When I was late and took the test, it came back positive.  Sometimes you can have a false positive, or even a false negative.  Its best to go to the doctor to be sure.|`|1fX5RQKuaa	when my period was a week late i test and it was neg. another week passed still no period, retested and twice and they were both positive. so just wait within a week period. good luck!|`|wiAVa1H5aa	It took a week or so with my last, well - both of my last pregnancies after the missed period to have a positive test.   This happens to many of us, just try again in 4-5 days.
71qojOkZaa	It does feel like mild period cramps, because the embryo is attaching ... but not everyone has the same symptoms|`|wcWTwFFpaa	I have 2 children and my first one I had at 17, being that my own body was not fully there yet, I had these strange cramps the first few months of my pregnancy... I went to the hospital, they said that it was my uterus stretching, it is very common and yes it is different then your period and less frequent.|`|vygYFdsSaa	I don't know why saying they feel like period cramps is off-limits because it truly is the feeling. I guess I'd say "duller" pain in your lower/sides of your stomach.|`|BHnAwYywaa	My cramps felt a bit like digestion?<br>  It was like bubbles - didnt really feel like period pain at all and definitely wasn't painful|`|tZ1XPd1paa	Well when I was FIRST pregnant my cramps were EXACTLY like I was about to start my period. I had to go to the bathroom to make sure I hadn't started it was soo similar! But I will say for me, it was less frequent than period cramps|`|3e42dfd404c2e6e75af7d0c190d10b2aaa	I felt cramps a little lower than my period cramps were. It felt like my period was coming for a few weeks but it never did.The cramps were a lil bit less intense. They weren't like the kind you get when you bleed and you just want to lay down with a hot compress. More like when you walk you kust feel kinda achy. I could even feel it in my bones.<br>  <br>  Not that I care about thumbs downs or anything, but why would someone thumbs down an answer saying How I FELT. They don't get that I felt that way. or something?? I just don't get it. This is an answer that stated how I felt when I was in early pregnancy. Not how it is supposed to feel or how anyone else feels. Weird.|`|WWcaKZ7Qaa	I don't know how to answer this since I can't say they feel like period cramps, because that's EXACTLY how they feel, only they stick around for quite a bit longer.
qcjAg3yOaa	A lot of ppl assume just because someone has kids, they know what they're doing.<br>  <br>   Its the same way with my MIL she has 9 kids and she was trying to tell me what to do for teething (have my son chew on an onion. may work but he was only 1 mnth old i didnt want him chewing on an onion)<br>  <br>   and one of the older brothers was like "yeah my mom knows a lot of stuff with kids! i mean she had all of us so she knows what to do, just listen to her" <br>  I was thinking to myself "I dont give a crap what she knows or how much experience she has, it doesnt mean everything she does is right".<br>  <br>  If i were you i would not let my child over there unless I was there to basically supervise. Its your childs safety. No you're not crazy for being upset, i wouldnt of even let my child go over there again after the aspirin thing, thats just weird.. i have hard times opening child proof pill tops myself... Go over there and just monitor.. dont let her babysit..<br>  and dont let anyone tell you you're over reactiong. Go with what you feel is right.<br>  <br>  Goodluck!|`|1d96f37d161f5b36db2cdf3bb334c59caa	I have a 2 year old and he's old enough to understand that medicine is bad and that he's not supposed to get into it. He probably feels the same way. He knows his kids know that medicine is bad. You're angry at him because your daughter gets into it. Let him know that you're daughter still gets into the medicine and watch her while you're there at all times.|`|HqOkC2YHaa	I would not go over there anymore and not talk to your brother for a bit, and when he calls to say why haven't you called or come over...tell him to lighten up because he is over reacting and that your life does not revolve around stupid people who leave medicine in a place that a child can easily get, and have someone open for her and that you value your daughters life and health more then your friendship<br>  <br>  at least that is what I would say|`|UMRdHuuVaa	I would ring CPS and say the kids are exposed to potentially harmful drugs - which they are.<br>  And just not take your child there anymore, if removed from the threat - one cannot get harmed.|`|KNxs4PrZaa	you are not crazy at all that is ridiculous and dangerous! accidents happen but it sounds like they are just asking for it!|`|mjz8JF9Gaa	i wouldnt even go over there ne more <br>  and she acts like its no big deal <br>  shes an idiot|`|T1q4GWLkaa	I would be pretty upset.  I'd like to think my child would be safe while visiting relatives.  If their houses aren't baby proofed, I'd expect them to let me know, so I could be more vigilant in trailing them around as they play.
AA12221392	your brother just proably believes because she raised the other older children she knows what she is doing. It just happens that no one did get hurt. <br>  <br>  You are not crazy and I would be upset as well.<br>  <br>  I included a link for how easy child saftey caps were gotten off by young kids...|`|prqrQcd1aa	You are not being crazy about this.. I had a friend who once did the same things, and i would constantly tell her about it, and when i went to her house, i'd put up all the crap myself, just so i knew my kid wouldn't get into it. She may have been offended by this, but honestly my kids safety is more important.. She understood what i was talking about when her daughter who is 2 years older than my oldest daughter decided that she was "sick" one night while her mother was taking a shower, and decided to drink a whole bottle of children's benedryl. She had to take her to the hospital, and the hospital called Children's services to report it.. They came in and investigated her, and told her that she HAD to keep all the meds up where her kids couldn't get to them, and after coming to visit a few times, they stopped coming and said that she was fine now. She now keeps her meds up and actually locked so the kids can't get into them.|`|jCy0J2ueaa	They are crazy|`|Jm6mkvlWaa	I completely agree with you. Strike 1 could have been no big deal. But strike 2 definitely shows a lack of intelligence. So many people today just don't think about things like that. But, since they obviously won't listen to your suggestion to move the medicine, then you need to make sure your daughter knows not to open cabinets or to touch any medicine unless Mommy is giving it to her. And you'll probably have to watch your daughter like a hawk (Not saying you aren't paying attention, its amazing what a child can accomplish in just 1 minute!) in your future visits until she is older and fully understands why she can't play with medicine.|`|bYaxOfWOaa	Oh my God that is ridiculous! What is wrong with your SIL? Unfortunately the only resolution I can see is for you to stop taking your child there. Hopefully they'll get the picture and start taking some responsibility! <br>  If you are really concerned about this, with them having a 2 year old, maybe an anonymous call to Children's Services is on the cards?<br>  Not a pleasant thought, but is it worth risking your niece/nephew?<br>  Sorry I can't be of more help!|`|qYZ2QFlbaa	I just don't see the point of having medicine on a shelf that is 3 1/2 feet high...... I mean, who would want to bend down to get medicine? Why is it not kept in the MEDICINE cabinet??? You are not crazy :)
MHeOHOnbaa	the cyst on your ovaries could be so painful you couldn't stand up and if you had miscarried you would be bleeding and the discharge sounds like a yeast infection i hope you get a better doctor to start looking after you if not for you then for your baby|`|McQanl5Aaa	You should NOT be having pain that bad if you're pregnant, the other person was right you need to find a new doctor that will listen to you! The discharge is normal. although annoying, but the pain is not normal! You need to find out if you do have a cyst or if its something worse like an ectopic (tubal) pregnancy, which is lifethreatening if not taken out! Don't even wait til monday to see a different doctor. If I were you I would go straight to the emergency room if the pain is that bad. Good luck girl, its better to be safe than sorry!|`|aD7kHTJNaa	your doctor is NOT taking care of you at all! Ask for a referral to see another Dr right away! Even if it is just to get an emergency untrasound done! any Dr in their right mind would do that! call planned parenthood 2moro & ask them if they have an ultrasound machine & explain and ask if you can come in & go straght in an lay ont eh table to wait. dont deal with ur DR he doesnt have u or ur baby in his mind only $ it sounds like!|`|8iBOF2h5aa	Girl, get use to it. that nasty stuff is normal and will be there for a while.

Q7vMH7akaa	I think he was feeling "sexually aroused" at the time and didn't know what he was doing.

bb3299947b02635429d1636917fa08aeaa	Facts about Fertility<br>  Ovulation (the release of one or more eggs from an ovary) occurs within a 24 hour period and only once during a menstrual cycle. <br>  <br>  Day 1 of menstrual bleeding is the first day of the cycle.<br>  <br>  The time interval from day 1 to ovulation may vary.<br>  <br>  The time interval from ovulation until menstruation is about 2 weeks.<br>  <br>  Ovulation will occur early in a short cycle and later in a long cycle.<br>  <br>  Observing the cervical mucus symptom gives information about being potentially fertile or infertile on a day by day basis.<br>  <br>  The fertility and infertility patterns ahead of ovulation vary from woman to woman.<br>  <br>  ***Once released from the ovary, the ovum (egg) lives for 12-24 hours, unless fertilised.<br>  <br>  Sperm cells need suitable cervical mucus to survive and reach the ovum in the Fallopian tube.<br>  <br>  Sperm cells may live for 3-5 days in suitable cervical mucus. At infertile times they will survive in the vagina for only an hour or two.|`|3FOmoaUZaa	~36 hrs|`|7fcZu8v8aa	The median time is about 24 hours, but if you are trying to conceive it takes about 10 hours for sperm to reach the egg, and sperm can live for several days, so your "fertile period" is actually in the day or two leading up to ovulation as well as the day you ovulate. That can cause some people to think that the actual process of ovulation is longer, but it isn't. The egg itself is not "available" for all that long (but again, 24 hours is an average, sometimes it will be slightly shorter or longer).|`|yPhkTBYlaa	Ovulation itself is a very quick process. Ovulation occurs when the egg bursts from the follicle. <br>  Generally people say the ovulatory phase lasts for a day. If you are trying to get pregnant your most fertile days are four days before you ovulate.
c271e0d140cbe1902cabe87b6f0e3485aa	No, you're not a bad mother for wanting to switch, you are to be commended for breastfeeding your baby for that first important month of her life.<br>  <br>  However, if you want to stop because you are tired, or you feel she isn't getting enough milk, then talk to a Lactation Consultant (the Maternity Dept at the hospital can help you find one) or the La Leche League will be happy to help.<br>  <br>  There is nothing wrong with switching to formula, but you are just getting breast feeding well established now, and your baby might be going through a growth spurt and feeding more than normal, feed her as often as you can for the next few days and see if things improve.<br>  <br>  In addition to all that, formula is expensive and not as good as mother's milk, so think carefully before you stop nursing.<br>  <br>  Good Luck<br>  <br>  EDIT: If you do decide to stop - do it gradually, dropping one feed at a time, don't go "cold  turkey" whatever you do!|`|OrKpKxkHaa	There are many things that make a mom "good" or "bad" and not one decision alone can decide that. Breast feeding is great for any length of time that you can manage. I would give it a few more weeks since it really does get easier after the 6 week mark. If, after that time you are still tired, try supplementing one or two bottles a day. Just be cautious; when I did this with my daughter, she began preferring the bottle and refuses to nurse now. Good luck!|`|fc5KHr6aaa	I, too, wanted to quit at 1 month. Before my daughter was born, I told myself I would aim for 6 months, but when the one month mark came I was tempted to quit. I made myself keep going, setting a new goal of 3 months. I ended up making it 4 months and am glad that I did. My daughter ended up kind of weaning herself at that age. If there isn't a medical reason, I would say try to find the will power to keep going, if it is important to you. If not, formula definitely doesn't make you a bad mom! I'm just trying to give you some encouragement to keep going if that is what you wanted to do! Good luck!|`|yYZTfwT8aa	Its a lot of work.  It can be very inconvenient if your going back to work.  One day at work with a soaked shirt & you'll definitely have questions in your mind regardless how dedicated you are.  I did breast feed my children but I also supplemented when I was exhausted.  It was easy for my children because they never got nipple confusion. I liked breast feeding but readily I let them go to the bottle instead of forcing them to stay attached to me even when it was not convenient.  At first I bottle fed them my breast milk then I switched to formula.  <br>  Do what works for you & your little one.  <br>  <br>  I think the best moms are the ones who enjoy their time with their little ones.  Babies shouldn't be a looked upon as a drudgery or a chore, so if something is uncomfortable then make it more comfortable for you both.  Formula is fine.  You are a better mom than most because you want to do the "right thing" but whats right for her might not be right for me, same goes for you & I. <br>  <br>  Try bottle feeding her your breast milk & see if that helps the two of you reach a middle ground.  <br>  <br>  Good luck 'Lil Mamma.<br>  Terri,|`|jCy0J2ueaa	No not a bad mom at all! you are doing such a good thing i felt the same way with my son so i would give him one formal bottle before bed and he would sleep so much longer and then breast feed the rest of the day you should try this before you stop breast feeding it really helped us. also if you are open to it you can put him in your bed that way unless he poops or something you can just let him nurse side by side while you sleep. i also did this and my son never got rolled on or anything. co- sleeping is a good option for breast feeding moms as long as you are not a heavy sleeper or on any meds that make you tired.|`|ilrSUcMvaa	i fed my baby for 7 weeks and found that i was happier doing it with formula. it was a bit more effort sterilizing and all that but i felt better. and because i felt better i could be a better mum. i also found my baby slept longer. it s up to u. u could express some milk and give it in the bottle also. ask your healthcare professional what they think. u r not a bad mum.|`|JRXpYW3Naa	The first month was the hardest, try to keep it up for just a few more weeks, it will get better. I was ready to quit to, but determined to keep going. No, wanting to quit doesn't make you a bad mother at all, but if you keep up for just a little while longer, it gets easier. Keep that in mind.|`|448dccf4c05f3570f913d749d048c4dbaa	I do know the feeling mama, I am bf my 6 month old, back to work full time and pumping at work. It is very tiring.. However  you are NOT a bad mom at all! Your little one has greatly benefited from your "good stuff" so far. I can say it does get easier!! It is def easier to pop a boob in his mouth during those late night feedings rather than getting out of bed to prepare and measure the formula then warm it up while the lil one is screaming! Its your choice but Maybe try bottle during the day and BF at night... At least this way she is still benefiting from your milk. Good luck|`|En9gIC3Zaa	no. breastfeeding isn't for everyone. just like cars, not everyone likes trucks. The fact that you breast fed her for a month is great. if you can keep going then great if not then its fine. Its the fact that you gave your child the precious gift that you have. Some women don't at all.|`|wmc7uHLIaa	It doesn't mean you are a bad mother.  Being that you haven't done it for very long, it should (hopefully) be easy to wean your baby.  Good luck.  Hope you find a solution that works for both of you.|`|DSZTruuqaa	You aren't a bad mom.  I could list the pros and cons, but so could a good google search, so I won't... What I will say is that it doesn't have to be all or nothing.  Try feeding every other feeding for awhile...

Maybe use something to  defend yourself? Pepper spray? Tazer?

Go with your mum or a large group of friends. Adults and groups scare possible predators away. When you go out, stay in public places and never go out too late.  <br>  Sorry to sound like a paranoid mother, but the day you be naive, could be the day someone tries something more than just talk you up.<br>  <br>  Good Luck. Im sure it will stop when you get older.|`|woNDzxGKaa	I hope your dad dies a slow, painful and bloody death.<br>  <br>  As for your question, you need to:<br>  <br>  a.) always keep a cell phone close at hand,<br>  b.) keep some sort of defense weapon in your bag (ideas below,)<br>  c.) always stick with a friend when you're going out alone,<br>  and d.) draw attention to the situation if you're uncomfortable! Even screaming something life "Fire!" or "Back away or I'm calling the police right now!" or something that will get other people to help out. Wave and kick and punch and slap and move like mad, screaming at the top of your lungs if someone tries to take you in their van, you know. Good luck and godbless sweetie!

WWcaKZ7Qaa	Bowling is an activity that should be okay for most women during their pregnancy. Your joints and ligaments relax during pregnancy, but how much they relax varies from woman to woman. Most expectant mothers do not experience that relaxation to the extent that they'd injure themselves while bowling. Once you hit your third trimester, take care to lift your bowling ball in a way that won't strain your back muscles. That means making sure to bend at your knees and to keep your back straight.|`|W4J7Ary0aa	Yes bowling is safe. I went bowling at about 24 weeks pregnant and ws fine. My mom played softball as a catcher til lshe was 7 months pregnant. I thought she was crazy and did not know how she did it all. I played volleyball on my church rec. team until about 22 weeks. If you are safe and careful you can continue doing alot. Just remember there is a baby in there. i had to say that all the time in order to not dive to the floor or move in such a way I could fall or run into someone. When I felt like I should stop I did.|`|vygYFdsSaa	I'm sorry that I don't know of any bowling while pregnant websites, but you should really be fine, especially since you're still early in this pregnancy.

I don't know why I just felt like as soon as I went off my BC and wanted it, everything would just fall into place like I wanted. We have been trying for 8 months now. I know it isn't as long as some other people but it is still frustrating every month you get disappointed! My doctor said it takes 85% of couples a year to get pregnant! But you have the right attitude right now! You are just kind of going with the flow and I think that will help you out a lot and not cause you to get to anxious! Good Luck and Baby dust!
W2z5dCrmaa	He has no concept that he is making you discomfort, and it sure helps when they start verbal communications. <br>  <br>  I think that the sock idea is a good one, and what would make it work better is to let him get a bit hungry b4 putting him on your breasts, then he will forget about the sock on his hands and focus on the nursing instead of his hand having socks on them.<br>  <br>  Sorry you are feeling this way, and it sounds like you are a little bit tired and done in. Keep hopes up, because it will get better, and he will be allot of fun and joy for you on the overall. <br>  <br>  I can understand how you are feeling, and I only get the rare day like that.<br>  <br>  Me! :- )|`|rdpZrBc9aa	Say NO and take him off the breast.  He'll get the idea.|`|aca803aafd407291581b58b9be71df4daa	My son did the same thing.  Don't give up.  They will stop.  You could try holding his hand while he nurses.  If it gets too bad put him down and try again in a bit.  <br>  <br>  My son did it when he was really tired.  He still sorta pinches when he nurses but it doesn't hurt cause he knows if he hurts me I put him down.  He is 16 months old though so he understands what I am saying.<br>  <br>  Keep the breast that you aren't nursing from covered. and drape something over your neck if you can.  Good luck.  It gets better.|`|DSZTruuqaa	Sorry, my sister had this problem too.  Just hold his hand the whole time.  He will get over it... just one of many phases to come.
S5Lsbh0taa	Walking down the street I don't give it a second thought. A young person can look younger than they really are. And I just see a mother with her child. Beyond that its none of my business.<br>  <br>  Since I was with my husband from the time I was 16ys old and married at 19yrs old who am I to judge a young girl like that. I started looking at starting a family by the time I was 21yrs old.<br>  <br>  Since I just attended the baby shower of an 18 year old girl who's due to have her baby in three weeks. (A former workmate and friend.) <br>  Well thats says a lot doesn't it. She'll make a great mother and NO ONE has EVER mentioned adoption to her because she's young. (She'll be a great mum, ) Come to think of it I've never over the years heard anyone suggest that to a young expectant mother. People here ASSUME a woman would raise her child these days and NOT give her baby up for adoption. (I get looks of surprise when people find out my kids are adopted, "I didn't think it really happened any more here in Aust. I just figured people could only foster kids these days." It has become more and more part of the culture to think a single mother would raise her child. <br>  <br>  So much has changed since the 1970's....so much for the glorious good old days...|`|jHZqOuVEaa	None of the above.  I rush right up to her and give her my adoption networking card.  I am so much more deserving of a baby than she is.<br>  <br>  JUST KIDDING!!<br>  <br>  1. Good for her to be taking responsibility.<br>  2. She's chosen such a hard road, but it's not the end of the world.<br>  12. I hope she has a lot of support because she's going to need it.<br>  <br>  On 12. - I always hope that her family is lovingly backing her up and is enjoying their new family member.<br>  <br>  I would like to add that some young looking parents are married and that the pregnancy may have been planned.  My niece was married at 18 had a baby at 19 and one at 21.  They are home owners and she is a stay at home mom.  She looks very young.  I can't believe the crap that she gets when she is out with her darling children.  Her mom (my sister) was also a young, married mom.  She and her husband wanted to have kids right away.  They have three lovely grown children and are loving life as very young empty nesters.<br>  <br>  If the mother is not ready for more children, I also hope that her parents and doctor are helping her to understand the need to use effective birth control.|`|YkSPMvg5aa	1,2, 9 , 10 --and maybe some of the others depending on what she's actually doing with the baby.  I've seen everything at the mall where I live from mom's really taking care of their kids to others freaking out or not paying attention at all--it is like anything else you can't paint a one sized fits all thing here.<br>  <br>  For the most part I don't bat an eye.|`|RKcwfrGOaa	1.  Good for her to be taking responsibility.|`|rAEkgvsXaa	I just think "great, she'll be a young grandmother"|`|Ah6FJHkWaa	My first thought is always negative.  I wish that were not true but it is.  I make no thought on what kind of parent she will be, I make no thought on whether she should raising it.  I only think, that in this day and age, with all protection available, are kids still getting pregnant?<br>  <br>  Then I really don't think about it again.  <br>  <br>  Now ask me how I fell when I see a 21 year old with six children.  Then my thoughts go more negative, and I do think WTF.<br>  <br>  I can say however I don't believe people have screwed their lives up by getting pregnant..|`|BTuFtui3aa	<<9. I don't blink an eye when I see teenaged parents anymore.>><br>  <br>  This one, although I'm not sure I ever did. In the area where I grew up, and the area where I live now, teenage pregnancy is common and relatively accepted. In most cases where I live these young women are getting a lot of family support. (Private adoption doesn't really exist in this area... I don't live in the United States... so adoption wouldn't cross my mind under normal circumstances.)<br>  <br>  When you see a teenage mother every time you go to the grocery store or the mall, you just stop reacting. That might make me a bad person-- maybe I should be more concerned-- but if I don't even know the person, I don't really think much of it.|`|SrcoG7JRaa	2, 10, 12.<br>  Sometimes 1, 3 and 4 go through my mind. It depends on how she presents herself. If she's tidy, the baby looks happy and well cared for and she's paying attention to it, 1 is the first thought in my mind. Good for her.<br>  <br>  If she's got a cigarette hanging out of her mouth, is yakking on her cell phone while her unkempt kid just sits there or wanders away (or worse, is screaming) and she's dressed like a tramp, has skunk-dyed hair and I can see her thong and tramp stamp, 3 and 4 come to mind.|`|gEBBpvlFaa	Some variation of 1, 2, 7, 10, 12.<br>  I also think that she must have very supportive parents.<br>  And that she must have been strong to decide to parent her child rather than cave in to some of the pressure she might have been subject to over relinquishment.<br>  And that I'm glad that her child won't have to suffer from adoption loss.|`|AA11987492	I have been there. <br>  <br>  Mainly, it just brings back memories of the things people said to me, and that I hope no one says to her.

Due to the fact that I have had a lot of people in my lives that were teen mothers, and most of them not all but a large portion don't have the father involved and just dumped the baby on their parents. But in honesty, because I've had to watch these people treat their poor beautiful babies so badly I tend to have a knee jerk reaction and go for 4 and 10 and hope that isn't the case for them. But I will say that I do have 1 very close friend that really stepped up and is an amazing mother better than some full grown married women. So while I feel bad for clumping all them in the same category it's hard because of most of what I've seen.|`|cd98c09cc34c3c84ad4502d636e2d2beaa	From the sociologist POV:  <br>  <br>  1. Good for her to be taking responsibility.<br>  2. She's chosen such a hard road, but it's not the end of the world.<br>  7. She's young, but she looks like a good mother.<br>  <br>  Recent research has shown that there's no good reason to postpone childbearing, especially postponing it until you can no longer conceive.  Nature made women to be their most fertile between the ages of 16 and 26. <br>  <br>  Old studies that supposedly proved that teen pregnancy was a crisis were based on biased data with confounding variables (race, culture, social class, etc.).  But this supposed "research" fulfilled the right-wing political purposes of the time.  <br>  <br>  New data proves what people knew up until 50 years ago:  teen pregnancy is natural and is NOT a crisis. <br>  <br>  Some of my sources listed below. <br>  <br>  ".. a review of the research evidence finds that the age at which pregnancy occurs has little effect on social outcomes. Many teenage mothers describe how motherhood makes them feel stronger, and marks a change for the better. Many fathers seek to remain connected with their children.”  (Duncan, 2007)    <br>  <br>  "Moreover, we find that teen mothers may actually achieve higher evels of earnings over their adult lives than if they had postponed motherhood. Finally, we find evidence that while teenage childbearing does seem to increase public aid expenditures immediately after a teen birth, this “negative” consequence of teenage childbearing is not a permanent one, in that teen mothers use less public aid in their late 20s as their earnings rise and their children age." (Hotz, McElroy, & Sanders, 1999).<br>  <br>  Look at your family trees. My guess is that almost all of your female ancestors prior to 1900 were teen mothers.|`|hTieELhTaa	honestly when I see a teenager with a baby I start thinking about what I can do to make sure my child wont end up in the same shoes. Even though I dont have any children yet and am not even married I just feel like by the time I do have kids and by the time there teenagers things are going to be so much crazier then then now or when I was growing up. It seems like americas youth are trying to be adults at younger and younger ages by each generation. I just hope I can find a way to keep my daughter from making the same choices that teenage mom did|`|pLNDY4BRaa	I dont look at it any different than I would looking at a mother in her late 20's early 30's (ofcourse aslong as they arenot 13,14 etc)<br>  I personally can tell you, It is a damn hard and it is a 24/7 job, BUT if your heart is in the right place, you have your priorities in order and plan on doing something to better yourself, (ie. college, workforce ect) then all the power to all of you teen moms.<br>  I am a 19 year old mother of a little girl who will be one next month, and I can safely say, i have never been on welfare, I have my highschool diploma and am attending college and have a part time job to support her.<br>  It really does bother me when people label teen mothers as unfit, immature and welfare bums. I mean, open up your eyes and lets be realistic, does everyone truly fit to the same mold in life? I dont think so. I think they should be treated with respect because they made the decision to take responsibility for their actions and raise their child rather than shipping the child off for adoption ( im adopted and i can tell you right now how that feels...) or to go and get an abortion. Stay strong all you other teen moms! you can do it!!! =D|`|zs1C1G1waa	When I see a stranger who is a teenage mother, I think I usually don't think a whole lot about it.  My passing thoughts might be that I applaud her for taking responsibility and I hope she has support.  I'm an 8th grade teacher, so most of the teenage mothers I know IRL are former students.  And, honestly, I have usually cringed at the thought of the young lady being a parent because usually I know what serious problems there are in her life and what a dysfunctional life she has.  Usually that's the case when I've known teen mothers IRL.  In a lot of cases, the pregnancy isn't unwanted or even unplanned.  Adoption isn't even part of the equasion.  The young lady is trying to fill a need she never had met in her family.  It's usually a very sad situation and I do worry a lot about the baby being brought into the situation.  That's not always the case, though.  There have been a few cases where I think, well she'll have a bit of a hard time, but she's going to be just fine and the baby will be just fine and will be surrounded by the love and support of family through any difficult times.  I've never known a teenage mother IRL who placed her child for adoption or who even considered it for that matter (of course I don't necessarily know what she considered).  I have known of some unplanned pregnancies that were aborted, and usually in that situation I have thought it was the right decision.|`|4B8FVlMtaa	2,5,7(if it actually looks that way),10,12 but more because my taxes are too high already|`|5824744e4ab4fcfafc968e00935b02e5aa	1,2,7,10<br>  <br>  i was a teenage mother . so i know how it is . but i also know it can be done|`|pzLDXL6gaa	Obviously it depends what she's doing. If she looks like a normal mother, then I wouldn't think much other than "oh, she's young to have a kid". If she's smoking next to the kid or something, then I'd be pretty angry and think she wasn't doing a very good job. But same though with an adult mother in that case, in fact I've only ever seen adults doing that. I see very few teenage mothers where I live actually, or maybe I just don't notice their age.<br>  <br>  Harriet|`|hzgFAJv0aa	Dear Kazi,<br>  <br>  I've been around long enough to know not to judge people on appearance alone. Especially with so many people who don't look their age - I wouldn't dare guess how old someone is! <br>  <br>  I have seen wonderful parents who were 15 and some who were terrible at 35. I've seen terrific parents slathered in ink and dripping with piercings and awful parents in Polo shirts and khakis. I've seen needy families who will stand by one another through thick and thin and rich families who would stab each other in the back in a heartbeat. <br>  <br>  I generally reserve my opinion until I know someone more that at a glance. I make my judgments based on HOW someone parents, not on how they look.|`|8Qxb7OZOaa	13.  Its none of my business.  Who am I to judge a girl trying to take responsibility and not asking for my opinion.<br>  <br>  14. I hope she has supportive parents and not ones trying to skip out on that part of parenting. Parenting doesn't end with teenage pregnancy. <br>  <br>  15. I hope she's involved with a boy that was raised by decent parents that taught him about responsibility and owning up to it.|`|Fy9S6hjIaa	Honestly I don't think of a teenage mother any differently than I do any other mother.  I had my son at the age of 19.  I wasn't married when I got pregnant, but I did get married while I was pregnant.  People in my home town were so judgmental.  One day I over heard some people at the local cafe talking about me.  One said "I just never thought she'd be the girl to wind up pregnant.  I mean her parents are just such good people."  The other said "Yeah I know, and it's not as if they don't have enough kids to raise already."  I was so angry because they were making it sound like A.) it was my parents fault that I got pregnant, and B.) that I was just going to dump my baby on them.  Neither was the case.  My sister once said to me,"You know its funny, you went from being the town 'princess' to being that 'poor pregnant girl' as soon as people started finding out you were pregnantt."  It was true and very hurtful.  After my fiance and I got married, we moved to a different town because I just couldn't take the ridicule any longer.  It was another small town, but surprisingly everyone just accepted us as a normal married couple expecting their first child.  It was really great.  We've lived here for 2 1/2 years now, and recently I found out that everyone here thought I was in my mid 20s. That's why all they "you poor pregnant teenager" looks were never there.|`|Lor20kXcaa	I coo at the baby lol.<br>  <br>  I've seen mothers who were 30 and act like their child is an inconvenience. <br>  <br>  Stuffing a dummy in their mouth at the first sign of being upset, without even looking to see what the problem is. <br>  <br>  I've seen teen parents be the most wonderful, caring, sleep deprived people. Who  never yell, or get frustrated.<br>  <br>  I think people make their own choices in life, their own descisions.<br>  <br>  We can never know what is going on in another person's life, and so have absolutely no right to judge.<br>  <br>  As long as their child looks healthy, happy, I'm glad there is another happy soul in the world.
KNxs4PrZaa	we didnt do it while i was taking the pills but started the day i finished just incase, even though they said i wouldnt ovulate for five days after taking it we had sex every other day for two weeks just to make sure unless you are opposed to having sex :) it couldnt hurt to try|`|AA11764194	I think you should start having sex from day 10.12.14, 16 and 18.. give 2 days gap in between to build semen quality.. <br>  <br>  Good luck..|`|bWyKAFwuaa	you do not need to have sex while taking clomid, but as soon as your period stops you should be having sex every other day (don't go longer then that!)

I've also heard of there being groups for single mom's.. and then there is always the people you work with as well. <br>  <br>  I am technically a single parent, i'm not married, i'm currently living with my boyfriend who is not the father of any of my 3 kids.

Sometimes you just have to put yourself out there, it was hard for me because I am shy for the most part.

McQanl5Aaa	My breasts got noticeably larger RIGHT away, like within 1-2 weeks of conceiving, before I even missed my period. They were also a bit sore. And I had to pee a lot, had increased appetite, extreme fatigue, and nausea. Most of these symptoms happened within the first week or two of conception. I didn't think that was possible so I thought I just have been farther a long, but when I got a pregnancy test at the doctor and they told me I wasn't far a long at all, I asked about how soon you could start experiencing symptoms and she said women can experience symptoms as soon as a week after getting pregnant. You should try taking another home pregnancy test and if it comes out negative but you still don't feel right and you still haven't gotten your period, you should go to the doctor for a pregnancy test. Sometimes women can get a false negative, or you might have concieved so close to the beginning of your next period that even though you missed it, you're not far along enough for a pee test to be accurate. Hope this helps!|`|4VIjILk1aa	Pull out method doesn't work. My husband and I did that for a while and I ended up pregnant. My earliest pregnancy symptoms were period like cramping, sore breast, tired, and I had to pee alot. Before I found out I was pregnant I took a test and it was negative so the next day I went to the doctor and found out I was pregnant. Test aren't always right. Wait a few more days then take another test and if it's negative and you still haven't had a period then go to your doctor. I was 2 weeks pregnant when I found out I was.|`|BHnAwYywaa	You definitely could be pregnant - I fell pregnant while on the contraceptive pill (never missed one) so anything is possible!<br>  I'm 23 weeks pregnant now, but my first symptoms were extreme tiredness - I was asleep on the couch by 7.30pm. Also faintness and light headed - not sure if this was pregnancy related that early though.|`|nQyJFOMZaa	When I was preggers I didn't have a possitive test until i was 6 1/2 weeks along just wait it out. If AF doesn't show up take a test if still NEG. Go to your Dr. It could be a sign of infection or an STD!  You might just be really stressed about AF coming too so it might start late, I don't know wait it out or go to you DR!|`|12bc27fa7b718990cbf3a82111b05148aa	Yes, you could be starting to have symptoms this early, though I never had any kind of stomaches or cramping. I had sore breasts, nausea, fatigue ... Take one more test, just to be sure.|`|Ltb8K9YUaa	Cramps like AF was my first symptom right around my missed period.  My boobs got sore a couple of days after.  Take a test and if it is negative again your not pregnant.|`|Ot8lxaMEaa	A few days even before my period was due, I noticed changes in my nipples. The lines in them were darker and deeper. A week or so after my period was late I started to get really tired. Like fall asleep at 7 at night and not move again for another 12 hours tired. I would test again today or tomorrow, if you are pregnant I would think the hormone would have built up enough by then to show up on the test. Good luck|`|QCUPeW8aaa	Early pregnancy symptoms are almost identical pms.<br>  Plus everyone experiences different symptoms.<br>  I had period cramps and was extremely tired. <br>  Your back doesn't start hurting until you are getting bigger and putting pressure on your back.<br>  Take a test if your test last week was negative than take it again because it would definately be accurate at this point.<br>  Good luck|`|pR4nLjyRaa	-sore breasts<br>  -larger breasts<br>  -extreme fatigue<br>  -extreme thirst<br>  -light cramping<br>  <br>  Its possible to get symptoms that early, mine didnt come in til I was about 5-6 weeks but everyones different. GL!|`|vygYFdsSaa	My first noticeable symptoms were that I had to go to the bathroom to pee ALL THE TIME. I had a little bit of cramping that I thought was my period (turned out to be implantation), and also very very sore boobs.<br>  <br>  You might be just having food/intestinal related stomach pains, but since your period is late, you should take another test now. It's been long enough that it will probably show up to be positive if you are pregnant. You should take the test first thing tomorrow morning, because that's when the highest concentration of hcg is present. Best wishes
ghz5D5iLaa	Yes. My mother used to set me on the table and give me alcohol and cigarettes for fun. I was their entertainment.|`|prqrQcd1aa	LOL, no, in fact my mom was so mad to find out i was smoking when i was an adult that I thought she was more mad about that then the fact that i had quit college.|`|SlBsJ3NRaa	Do you share heroin needles as well? Slit up the coke lines so you each have one? Maybe you get a family deal from your meth supplier? This isn't a funny question, and I hope it gets deleted.|`|711KONwOaa	no but i get to watch my mom do her drugs its really disterbing!!!<br>  <br>  <br>  ummmm please do my resent question|`|LDHu66Vraa	No both my parents smoked and they would have never done that. I've  been smoking snice I was 14 though. But when the found out that at 18 I had decide to smoke there didn't like the idea. I don't even smoke around my kids. I go outside  or far away from them just because I don't want them to start|`|X0ubZnPjaa	i don't know anyone who does that.<br>  <br>  when i was about 13-14 my parents used to let me smoke in the house but they never gave me cigarettes or encouraged me to smoke.|`|VuUz8NgKaa	No my parents never did that. I used to smoke and I never done that to my daughter, she never asked but even if she did there is no way I would have let her.|`|692c8795f68a0ba95a0d09139d70c98caa	I think your full of shitt personally, and this will probably get deleted anyways.|`|6VjHsMq7aa	I think it's not good to influence others to smoke because first of all, smoking is bad..|`|ntdGOZqGaa	Thats kinda odd dont ya think? Might as well let your child do drugs and drink beer too.|`|qTVkydt1aa	Abuse?|`|qYZ2QFlbaa	I hope you are not being serious. Did you take shots of moonshine with your family too? No. I did not do those things with my parents as a child.|`|sp1x3ZUAaa	....That is screwed up. Epicly. Wrong.<br>  You are letting your little girls do this and they don't know the side affects or anything?<br>  Just.... I don't know wiether you are a troll or just someone who is incredibly stupid and disrespectful of your childrens lives.<br>  They could get cancer, become addicts, etcetera..|`|jfwmelYgaa	No...I stole my moms cigarettes though.|`|P544Sbmqaa	My parents didnt.  My aunt and my best friends parents let us smoke and gave us cigs, but that was when we were like 15 and older.  <br>  <br>  I was diagnosed with a smoking related cancer when I was 21.  I relapsed when I was 23 and am now 25.  And even though I know how bad it is and what it has cost me, i still struggle with remaining smoke free and have really slipped up on that lately.<br>  <br>  Coming from that view point, I *DO* think its abusive to allow kids that young to smoke.  By the time they are teenagers, theres not a lot I can do to stop it, but I WONT be encouraging it.  I wont allow it in my home and I wont be the one to illegally by their cigs.<br>  <br>  However, when you are teaching kids as young as 4 and 5 or younger that smoking is normal and acceptable is UNacceptable to me.  I know what I went through with my cancer, and I know that its one of the hardest things for me to remain smoke free.  This is NOT what I want for my children.

12bc27fa7b718990cbf3a82111b05148aa	It depends who you're asking, but anyone who is an adult would consider you a child.|`|FiUprYsvaa	Children are -12. <br>  Above that is a teenager not a child. <br>  Child is use to describe a someone like 8 or 9. <br>  <br>  Most importantly if you were to tell someone you had a child they would automatically think younger not that you had a teenager. <br>  <br>  I am 19 and my mom still calls me a child. <br>  I should start calling her a senior citizien if she doesn't quit. <br>  <br>  <br>  And deep down I wish I was still young too. <br>  Life is much better when you are young.<br>  You have health insurance, you still have your future, and you can have fun. Oh and you don't get jerks from collections agency calling you telling you you owe $25 for a medical bill. Its like STFU and talk to my mom, she'll pay it. I swear i'll say that next time.|`|jvW3a5GYaa	You are a considered a teen - somewhere between a child and an adult. There's nothing wrong with wanting to stay young - you'll be growing up soon enough - enjoy your youth.|`|vE0ECnV0aa	You are turning into a teenager so i guess ur not a kid anymore|`|UzFWLTquaa	Yes, I mean you ARE a teenager but you are still technically a child (legally to be an adult you have to be 18) and until you are 18 people probably won't really start treating you like adult.  And I know how you feel, I am 17 and I am going to go to college after the summer and its really freaking me out because I will never live at home again.  Live it up while you can!!!|`|FWkLDcqOaa	Well you're definitely not considered a child, but don't think you have to be all grown up now. I think I'll always be a kid at heart.

I definitely would consider you nowhere near grown up. I consider you not be a child when you reach 25.|`|RvSHQtrXaa	Yes, you are considered a child if you are still under your parents roof.  And, even if you did not according to the laws of many countries you are still a child or minor.<br>  <br>  If, however, you get pregnant you gave up that childhood stage of being a mother.  And, a mother is not a child.
uPbTsr9eaa	If you have any family, try asking through them. <br>  <br>  People usually don't like to take strangers to babysit their kids, fear of the unknown... start with this and "expand your network" from there.|`|prqrQcd1aa	At your age having a reference that includes watching 4 children is honestly great!

Maybe ask some neighbors or family members. <br>  <br>  And you are only 15, one reference won't look bad at all. Especially since you've done it for a year and they like you. <br>  <br>  I don't suggest going out and posting signs and notices though. You never know what kind of people are waiting to dump their kids on you(like horribly behaved children with parents that don't care and won't pay) or worse, someone looking for a 15 year old for other reasons(crappy thought but that's how the world is these days.)

If I Know (and respect) your parents you're in.<br>  <br>  If I don't know your family, I need to be impressed with you.<br>  I'm not going to give my kids to someone who sticks a flyer in my door next to the 241 pizza and special order chinese menu<br>  <br>  you need to knock on doors in your neighborhood or approach moms with kids in the park.  - But not alone!<br>  If you bring your mom or dad (even if they are in the car) I know:<br>  A) you aren't stupid enough to approach strange doors alone <br>  B) You parents are involved with you and care about you a lot<br>  C) I can talk to them and get a real sense of who I'm leaving my kids with.<br>  <br>  Print up some tasteful business cards (you can probably do a decent job at home with bristol board but it won't be easy to make them really good) and that gives me a very good impression of how you are handling yourself <br>  - if business cards are out of reach - try a brochure with your availabilty and rate information inside on a folded 8 1/2 by 11 sheet of paper.<br>  <br>  (only give them to people (moms) you know have kids - give them to the wrong single guy and we'll both regret me giving you this advice)<br>  <br>  before you give a card, write down the address or name and phone number of anyone you give those cards (or any part of your personal information) too<br>  <br>  if anyone asks why you need a name, address or phone number say "for my own protection when I give out my card - to be extra safe."<br>  <br>  true potential clients will be impressed- anyone who won't give you their details almost certainly won't be a client and may be dangerous anyway so don't give them your card.<br>  <br>  Tell anyone about your experience, CPR and Babysitting education - very professional BTW - but don't give references without permission - explain to your current client first what you intend to do (like i described above) and ask them if it's ok to give those new people their number.<br>  <br>  also, be willing to show a redacted (keep any truly personal details out) report card as well. a good student with a professional attitude will make almost any parent consider you.<br>  <br>  let them know when you can work and how to get in touch with you<br>  have set rates for regular time and a higher rate for any time after when your own parents expect you back home.  <br>  Mom or dad's gas money to come pick you up late ain't free - even if they don't charge you :-)<br>  <br>  Finally, show this answer to your mom or dad and ask them what they think and if they have any other ideas or references for you.<br>  <br>  good luck
1QLp7iC5aa	This question is phrased wrong I think... You need to STOP taking birth control to get pregnant, you can expect to start trying after about a month but it could take anywhere from 3 months to a year to actually conceive! Good luck!|`|zATQaiwIaa	what!? you take birth control so you DONT get pregnant!<br>  How old are you?|`|g9vw4ovGaa	Honey, being on birthcontrol, prevents pregnancy, HENSE Birth CONTROL, you'll need to go off them to get pregnant.|`|cqW3NhqVaa	As soon as you stop taking them, you can get pregnant.<br>  You can actually get pregnant the day you stop.|`|AA11582608	Honey birth control PREVENTS PREGNANCY.  Stop taking it immediately if you trying to get pregnant.|`|hYRYO5GYaa	no honey birth control prevents pregnancy|`|L1qNhDMzaa	Girl you dont wanna take birth control to get pregnant. If you're for real about this question, you need to go to a family planning counselor and learn about the reproductive system and have them explain everything to you. Birth control 'prevents' pregnancy from occuring.<br>  <br>  If your doctor prescriber birth control to try and regulate your period, then he/she should have told you how long to take them and you can get pregnant the very next month you stop taking them.
448dccf4c05f3570f913d749d048c4dbaa	I work in pharmacy, and am also a Breast feeding mommy of 6 month old. I honestly would supplement with formula until your done with the medicine. Any drug that says it IS excreted into Breast milk says that for a reason. It is to for warn you about the possible risks of side effects that can be passed to your baby through your milk.... Here is a site of a drug website look up the drug there and warnings- Drugs.com.. Hope that helps.. Good luck =)|`|od51qzQtaa	As i understand it there are no side effects and its best to get the bacterial vaginosis cleared up which the metronidazole will do but if you are concerned in any way I would not take it. there are many ways to clear BV. You understand that BV is an inflammation of the vagina caused by the build up of gardnerella bacteria. you could try taking Acidophilus supplements which increase good bacteria or Lactobacillus. You can also try eating yogurt with live cultures in such as Activia.

For one, the baby needs care and so does your sister. She needs to be checked to make sure its a normal pregnancy (not a tubal which is life threatening). Secondly, the longer she waits, the harder it will be to say it. Stand by her side when she tells them to give her some support.
I1eNscocaa	yes it is true but most wil not feel any changes until a couple of weeks in. the most common very early changes are mood swings as your hormones go up so fast, some get alot more pimples due again to the increase in hormones plus a increase in discharge is noticed. tender breasts or tingling sensation can be felt quite early on as well|`|5824744e4ab4fcfafc968e00935b02e5aa	when i was i think like 3 weeks or something my hipds changes . i was a teen and tried on my regular pants and my hip area was bigger . i thought i gained wait and threw out the pants and then a few days later found out i was pregnant .|`|SM4xIodaaa	I had implantation bleeding and period like cramps following a week after conception BUT some woman do not feel any different.

1B91qtNQaa	Have you ever heard a parent say, "My daughter is not allowed to date until she is 40!" Us parents don't even want to think about our children coming close to doing something they are too young for. My husband says he knows what guys that age are thinking about and he wants his daughter to have nothing to do with it.<br>  <br>  Of course we know she has to live her own life and that it is not fair to her. But we also want her to make wise decisions. Maybe how your mom said that was a little blunt but maybe what you said took her by surprise and all she could think about was she better not get pregnant. <br>  <br>  It is so hard being a parent and I think back to when I was a teenager and I didn't get why my parents got all upset over silly things like a boy being interested in me. One day when you have kids you will get it.|`|4WgsBvq1aa	dw she just got the wrong immpression and got frightened my parents are the same and it is fair enough.<br>  but no it isn't all about love making, if he is a user then maybe, but if you're with someone you make the decisions what your relationship consists of. im 17 and my 14 month relationship consists of hanging out, having someone to always talk to, having someone to love and be affectionate with but the sexual side does not rule my relagtinship at all.<br>  :)<br>  just sit down your mum and reassure her you'll always be smart and would never take a chance at falling pregnant, :)|`|yOr4SOO4aa	Ha ha she must be only worried.

2wyDALHgaa	I was adopted as an infant and it's been positive for me my whole life.  My wife and I have also adopted both internationally and domestically through foster care (here in Canada) and again it's been positive.  International adoption has it's challenges for many people and it is very expensive but if it's something you want to consider then all I can suggest is to research it fully and make sure you are aware of the issues and the way in which things work.  I'm sure in Australia there are lots of children awaiting adoption so don't write that off as an option for you.|`|UO1QE8phaa	I think it sucks rotten eggs.<br>  <br>  I am adopted.<br>  <br>  Oh, and before you go accusing me of being a "teenager with nothing better to do", I'm 36 years old and have been reunited with my natural families for over 4 years.<br>  <br>  You have NO guarantee that a child you adopt would be 'grateful' (we hate that word, by the way) or even happy IN THE SLIGHTEST that they were adopted.<br>  <br>  Oh, and I would NEVER have had to work or get food out of the garbage.  My natural mother is FAR better off (financially and in ever other way) than my adoptive parents -- a situation which came to be 6 months after my birth and has been so ever since.<br>  <br>  She is the daughter of a doctor and a nurse.  She grew up very upper-class and has maintained that status/lifestyle in her adult life.<br>  <br>  Your assumptions are mis-informed, scary and sad.  I feel so sorry for any child that you adopt.|`|JP04HX6maa	"wouldn't you prefer to have a loving home then be forced to work and get food out of garbage for the rest of you life?"<br>  <br>  Any kid deserves those things. It's not a privilege.<br>  <br>  By the way, that's a blanket stereotype about adoption. You might want to do some research. And no, discussing adoption issues with your aunt will *not* be the same as having to raise that transracially adopted child.<br>  <br>  Read blogs.<br>  <br>  <a href="http://heartmindandseoul.typepad.com/" rel="nofollow">http://heartmindandseoul.typepad.com/</a><br>  <a href="http://harlowmonkey.typepad.com/" rel="nofollow">http://harlowmonkey.typepad.com/</a><br>  <a href="http://adoptionsurvivor.wordpress.com/" rel="nofollow">http://adoptionsurvivor.wordpress.com/</a><br>  <a href="http://sisterheping.wordpress.com/" rel="nofollow">http://sisterheping.wordpress.com/</a>|`|hzgFAJv0aa	Children are NOT collectibles. They are human beings. <br>  <br>  Please do some research into the possible damage adoption - especially international adoption can do to the child - not to mention how it encourages human trafficking.|`|fboC1N7gaa	It's wonderful.  If it weren't for adoption I wouldn't have the wonderful sister I have now.   We are so close and I couldn't imagine life without her.|`|0x8Q6rFPaa	I think adoption is much more complicated than you want to believe it is. I think if you want to be patted on the back for your imaginary rainbow family, there are plenty of other places you could go for that.   <br>  <br>  I think you ought to educate yourself a bit more about adoption before you presume to bring up the tired old "would you rather be adopted or aborted/raised by your poor crackhead mother?" canard.  You say you know a lot, but this statement shows how much you have to learn.<br>  <br>  I'm also curious about the magical process that makes a child from India "part of you."  Is surgery involved?|`|xKSr1ld8aa	Do yourself a favour and educate yourself before adopting as it's not all about adopting a child who has come from a bad start in life or abandoned by their parents.<br>  <br>  I was coerced into surrending and subject to general belief I had a well paid job - I was earning more money than my older sister and it was more secure than her job.  I didn't smoke, didn't drink alcohol, didn't do drugs so my only "crime" was to be a single mother.  In other words not all young mothers are poor.<br>  <br>  Find out how adoptees feel - my son's issues come from being adopted and emotionally he has been damaged by his relationship with adopted father.  His adoptive father isn't a bad man the two of them just rub each other up the wrong way.<br>  <br>  Adoptive parents can give you great insight as well.|`|ZM6ztWAzaa	Wow!  You have an AUNTY who adopted so you know all about it eh?<br>  I bet you do.<br>  <br>  Not.<br>  <br>  Oh and just so you know...<br>  Baby Collector= Crazy Person.|`|k1uUjz9aaa	it's legalized kidnapping and domestic terrorism.|`|y1mAMiaOaa	I'M ADOPTED!!!!!!! I think you should go for it!|`|zVZgYEjMaa	Be sure you understand the full complexity of adoption before you do it.<br>  <br>  Here are some books you should read:<br>  <br>  * "Being Adopted: The Lifelong Search for Self" by Brodzinsky, Schecter, and Henig<br>  <br>  * "Journey of the Adopted Self" by Betty Jean Lifton<br>  <br>  * "The Primal Wound" by Nancy Verrier<br>  <br>  ETA: I never said you didn't know the child was a real person.  And I never said you wouldn't love the child.  I said that you need to do research to understand the effects of adoption on children.  If  you go into this with the attitude that the child will simply be happy they aren't living on the street, you are likely to ignore real problems they may experience.  Indeed, you could make the problems worse.  Be sure you research the effects of adoption before you proceed.  Adoption is not as simple as you seem to think it is.<br>  <br>  ETA2: Just to be clear, talking about it with your aunt is different than research the experiences of the adoptee.  Trust me.|`|Dm9L3EdAaa	Having been adopted myself many years ago there's one thing you need to know before you adopt.<br>  <br>  Sweetie, when you sign the paper and adopt children they become your own children.  If you think of yourself as not their "real" parent, they'll know it in their bones.
Iek7D2hOaa	i think there's a boundry to what children can and can't play.<br>  alot of violent video games have sexual features to them.<br>  i've personally been playing violent video games since i was about four or so, and i'm not a violent person at all. <br>  i suppose it depends on the child, how easily influenced they are.<br>  as for the sexual features i mentioned before - i mean this by in the games i play/played there was always big breasted girls with barely anything on beating up people in high heels.<br>  of course, you're probably going; "yeah but i'm talking about sex, ect" well, unless you're letting five year olds play playboy mansion, then i don't think there's much to worry about.<br>  <br>  what do you mean by should the government have a say in what kids play ?<br>  there ARE ratings on video games as it is :\<br>  i think the parents should be the decisive ones.|`|qTVkydt1aa	It really depends on the video game...some are more harmless than others...<br>  <br>  Why should the government have a say?  It depends on how mature a parents knows their child is.  <br>  <br>  Parents just need to look at the game, the rating, read what it's about, and try it out first if they're so concerned.  I personally wouldn't let a young child play any openly graphic games, but once they were older I would.  <br>  <br>  It's just common sense.  I start playing games with much violence and sexuality way too soon, but it didn't really affect me as a person...at all.  I don't think violent video games are as appealing to kids.  They're just gross.  Same with sexual ones, a kid doesn't have any idea or really care what is going on.  <br>  At least I didn't!<br>  <br>  I know someone who let their 8 year old play a James Bond game...personally, especially for the immaturity of that child, I think that's too young for a game involving graphic violence and sexuality...it's James Bond for Christ's sake.  But I played that game at 10 years old, and I think that age was fine.<br>  <br>  It depends on the person I suppose!<br>  <br>  I definitely don't think the government should  put any form of regulation on what kids can and can't play because that would be terrible news for me.|`|UMRdHuuVaa	I would be more worried about their exposure to drugs at school and violence at school than playing a few games.<br>  In saying that, i dont plan to let my child be a video game freak - i will let him play wii fit when he is old enough, but video games make children lazy, if played all day and used in stead of exercise.<br>  <br>  But if he wants them, i think about 13 or so would be a ok age to start playing like the war games etc.|`|qYZ2QFlbaa	I would not allow my young children to play graphically violent or sexual video games. What's really important is not allowing them to play constantly. The government should not have a say.|`|3zUPOn3faa	There is a system called the ESRB that rates videogames on their content of violence and sexual themes. Here's how it goes:<br>  <br>  EC - Early Childhood<br>  E - Everyone<br>  T - Teen<br>  M - Mature<br>  A - Adult<br>  <br>  You can find the symbols on the front and back of the game box, and on the back, you can find reasons why the games are rated the way they are (Mild Language, Cartoon Violence, etc) Its up to you to decide if your child is mature enough to handle the games you buy them. And a good website to check out is:<br>  <br>  whattheyplay.com<br>  <br>  This site has reviews from parents on what they think of a game. And there are regulations in place to keep rated M and A games out of your children's hands. Stores arn't allowed to stock rated A games, and you must be 18 years or older to buy rated M games, or be acompnied by an adult. I think that parents are responsible for their own children's video gaming habits, so there shouldn't be SO much regulation.|`|oaA4FUABaa	I like the rating that manufacturers currently put on video games.  It makes it easy for me as a parent to determine whether or not I will allow my children to play the game.  They can play and E or T game right now and I and they are happy with that decidsion.|`|5SRCHmddaa	now almost every single video game has a letter saying what age they are for <br>  <br>  E is for everyone <br>  and there are some other <br>  you gotta actually read the game before you buy it<br>  <br>  <br>  if u think is not safe for ur kid then dont buy it|`|AA12221392	Games have ratings, just like movies. <br>  E = everyone<br>  T= teen <br>  M= mature<br>  <br>  they even tell why they are labeled that. wheter they have viloence, sex,or drugs. It will also let you if it has alot of blood and gore, or if the violence is cartoon (animated)<br>  <br>  I think the goverment tells us enough, we as parents should be allowed to decide if a game is what we would allow or not. Also we have the right not to buy them if they aren't what  we want our kids to play. <br>  As you can see, from y/a, that everyone has many different views and why should one person get to control our life and what is best for our children.|`|prqrQcd1aa	I wouldn't allow my children to play these games until they are about 16 years old, and that is if they so choose to play them at that point. They are all girls (3 of them in fact). The government can rate things all they want to, but it is not up to them to enforce these kinds of things, it's up to the parents. Could you imagine the debt our country WOULD have if they tried to enforce this stuff! It would be a waste of time honestly!
JIOfbDxVaa	I always used to do this when I was little. I really don't know why I did this but it always got me in more trouble. I don't know maybe it was seeing how silly my parents were when they got mad maybe? I don't think it's not uncommon for kids to smirk when getting punished. Me, my siblings  and cousins would always do it. A lot of the time I don't think kids really know why they are smirking.<br>  <br>  You probably should talk to him about. Just make sure it's not when your actually scolding him. Talk to him about why he does it and ask him if there is anything you can do to help him stop.|`|d7kGopYxaa	I agree with Laura.|`|FCQn5abyaa	It could be that he feels uncomfortable while being scolded, and tries to cover it up by putting up a front.|`|E5eUhUNeaa	when he smirks put a bar of soap in his mouth or tell him if he does it again he'll be grounded from video games. or maybe he has his emotions twisted up, and cries when he's happy???????|`|SxoDVgQ3aa	ask him if he means it.<br>  he shouldnt find getting in trouble funny|`|I6UnCjWlaa	you should scold him louder or punish him when he does like my mom used to do.
5PIgZ7tFaa	He's probably not old enough. I used to babysit my younger cousin and sister when I hit 11. But I was mature for my age. It depends on the individual. I don't think there's a hard and fast law regarding babysitting age in Alberta.|`|jCy0J2ueaa	i don't know about the law in Canada but a 10 year old is not responsible enough to babysit. Sorry
bb3299947b02635429d1636917fa08aeaa	I am a parent of a special needs child.  I know you want to think your child does not have a problem.  <br>  <br>  It is very expensive to educate children,especially those labeled or "identified" as special needs.  Here is NY the average cost to educate a "special needs" child is $30,000 per year per child!  <br>  <br>  Most parents have to fight for services.  <br>  <br>  Having said this there are also Special Ed teachers who SHOULD Not be Special Ed teachers.  Our sons teacher for the first half of 2008 was HORRIBLE.  She had a Degree in Special Ed, but honestly could not handle all of the different needs of the 10 kids in her class that were identified with special needs.  She was Identified as "NOT QUALIFIED" and let go by the school district.    <br>  <br>  Ask for a TEAM meeting between your teacher (all of the specialists who work with her (OT PT SPEACH School Psychologist and the principle)  Make a list of all of your concerns.

I suggest you switch her. THose teachers don't know a damn thing When my son was in kindergarden he was having trouble reading but now that he is in seventh grade he reads 2 high school age books per every week or 2 and is in the highest classes. See the big difference? your daughter can do it too. Those teachers don't know a thing.
bb3diU1laa	First off the teacher should never ever tell a child they are flunking how rude I personally would have a chat with this person(teacher) .  Next for my child, he was staring into space,he would make excuses not to do the work and so on.  One problem might take five minutes or more to do even if it was really easy.  Try making it fun,offer small rewards like if she gets in a certain time she gets to do ( you fill in the blank) and as she approves (faster) at math then the rewards get better like  Mcdonalds for supper or what ever...  Worked for my son and now he is an 8th grader who enjoys math..|`|4sjW4Ig5aa	Are you working on the math at home as well? With them wanting it done in 60 seconds, they are wanting her to memorize the answers. Is she working on the multiplication tables already? You can help her at home with flash cards and workbooks you can buy at walmart.|`|2Zo81qQAaa	Hi, I am on the board also with questions concerning my 1st grader and her teacher thinking she has ADD. <br>  <br>  If you would like to e-mail me maybe we can talk about our children and see how things go.<br>  <br>  We are doing the Vanderbilt forms next week.|`|I6UnCjWlaa	Maybe you should hire a tutor or go to a tutoring place like the silvan learning center or something.|`|f55619778e2c4f36156e3d1508aa6431aa	It sounds like this school has high academic standards with their 60 second time limit.   My kids are allowed extra time on tests if needed and one of them doesn't have an IEP.  <br>  <br>  ADD kids look like they daydream too much.   They are not hyper.   Does she seem like she's in her own world sometimes?   ADD would be more obvious in school than at home.   This teacher should never have told her she is failing.   There was no reason for that if she is trying her best.|`|SxoDVgQ3aa	the teacher should definatley not tell this little girl shes failing if they things she should be in special ed...if she wasnt trying thats another story!<br>  <br>  try studying at home..<br>  <br>  im sorry and good luck
FCQn5abyaa	Here's a general description, from what I've seen with my students.<br>  <br>  She is focused on her friends and family. She sends notes to her friends in class and spends time deciding who is and isn't her friend.  She enjoys spending time with her family, and likes pleasing adults by helping out with chores and other things.  She likes to do adult things, like reading chapter books and learning how to do new things, but still acknowledges that she is a little kid, and likes to have a bedtime, rules, etc.  She enjoys princesses, fairies, animals, and TV shows & movies aimed at tweens, like Hannah Montana.  Barnie and "baby" shows are definitely not cool.  Generally, I have not noticed girls to be very rebellious at this age unless they are driven to be so.|`|yV8fog7Paa	*cough* normally they are good kids but if you want to see a *cough* bad *cough* 8 year old kid go look at my topic I just made in grade schooler.|`|SxoDVgQ3aa	well if you want detailed answers ask a neighbor to babysit|`|GgMTzvm1aa	8 year olds are pretty smart, and know alot of stuff usually, but just about enough to get them in trouble too. they can read some, write some, tie their shoes, dial 911, brush their teeth, etc. they are kind of silly sometimes but want to start being like teenagers too, and wearing make up sometimes. they are starting to open to peer pressure but not as bad as a 12 year old.|`|rtk0S0W5aa	If your writing about an 8 year  and your asking that kind of question then maybe you shouldnt write about that.|`|E5eUhUNeaa	theyask a lot of questions and try to be your best friend
aSdUzlIiaa	My daughter has one she just has to play it on the virtal part and when it grows up (over playing time) it will pop the toy out
IFDfpbFJaa	There are some things that you shouldn't eat or it will be passed to the baby, alcohol is one of them of course, Broccoli will make your baby gassy through your milk. There are a bunch of others I think, google it and you'll find lots. <br>  <br>  I think I took my prenatals still for a while after, but I also took Omega-3<br>  <br>  You should do whatever is best for you. I personally tried to breast feed, couldn't get my son to latch right but still wanted him to have the milk so I pumped which was super stressful, after 3 months I gave up and just gave him formula....|`|wiAVa1H5aa	1)   Recreational drugs, shrooms, heavy narcotics, etc...   Otherwise, no.<br>  2)  Yes, as long as you are fertile you probably should continue to take prenatal vitamins as about 50% of all pregnancies are unplanned.<br>  3)  Totally breast - CDC, AAP, W.H.O., all healthy agencies endorse breast feeding exclusively until 6 months and then still nursing with introduction of foods beyond 12 months.|`|EyKJ737daa	There are some things you cannot eat.  Watch your intake of Vit C as this can be very sore on baby's bottom if you eat too much.  High alcohol intake should be avoided too.  You may find yourself that certain things you eat will effect baby's sleep pattern or behaviour. It will be trial and error I'm afraid after that. Other than that though, you doctor will be able to tell you in more detail what should be avoided.  <br>  Yes you most certainly should take your vitamins while breastfeeding as BF babies do tend to drain mummy of a lot of nutrients and minerals and sometimes you can't get them back into your body fast enough so vitamins are certainly of benefit.<br>  Whether breast or bottle feed it totally up to you and your circumstances. If you are a stay at home mum and work commitments are not an issue, then yes most certainly breastfeed as it is a wonderful bonding experience with mum and baby.  As long as you or your baby have no medical issues that prevent either of you breastfeeding then go for it.  Otherwise there is always a bottle but whatever you choose, don't be made to feel guilty about your decision, either way, your baby will not starve.  Both bottle and breast feeding have their advantages and disadvantages but again, up to you.  I bottle fed my first due to her medical condition which we later found out about at age 2 but I was made to feel terribly guilty which I still feel angry about the hospital, however my 2nd and 3rd where breastfed.  Breastfeeding is definitely more convenient and cheaper and "on tap" whenever needed.  Bottles come with a bit more mucking around!  Good luck with whatever you do and all the very, very best.|`|jkDbDjcRaa	I breastfed for a month, then switched to bottle due to medical reasons.<br>  <br>  1) no (but you should try and eat as healthy as possible.<br>  2) Yes,<br>  3) Whatever's best for you...they say breast is best...but I know lots of people who didn't attemp it, and their kids are fine.|`|EHY3FnAmaa	Yes you do take your prenatal vitamins.<br>  <br>  I bottlefeed.  Should you breast feed or bottle feed?<br>  That is something only you can answer, its what works best for you and your baby and family|`|LWXRVO5Haa	1. No<br>  2. Yes<br>  3. You should breastfeed.<br>  <br>  EDIT: I agree with Ethel, stay off the shrooms.|`|KmC0K59taa	I breastfed and there was nothing I did not eat.  Some foods will cause the baby to be gassy, but my baby was not that sensitive.  I did still take vitamins.  They prescribed me different ones even.  Do some Research.  Breast milk is definitely better.<br>  <br>  Also, breastfeeding is free and there aren't many hassles.  You don't have to get up in the middle of the night and make bottles.  You don't have to spend a ton of money on formula for a year.  You won't be washing 100 bottles every day.  You can breastfeed anywhere.  Just get your baby when she wakes up at night and lay her down beside you and she'll nurse.  You can doze off again when she's done.<br>  <br>  Breastfed babies have less tummy problems.  Formula makes them constipated and gassy therefore newborns on formula cry a lot.  I breastfed and my baby rarely cried.  She was a good baby from day one.  She didn't even cry when she was hungry, she kicked her feet.  I loved nursing and my baby did too.|`|DSZTruuqaa	1.  It is best to go easy on caffeine and stay off alcohol.  Also, sugar can hurt a baby, so go easy on the chocolate :)<br>  2.  No.<br>  3.  Breastfeeding helps you bond with the baby and really helps them fight off infection.  You share immune building stuff with baby as you feed.  As you fight colds, the baby will be able too.  It is also cheaper and more natural the the nestle alternatives.  ALSO, you will lose weight like crazy.  500 calories a day :)|`|aca803aafd407291581b58b9be71df4daa	1.  You can just watch and see what kind of reaction your baby has.  I know my son is 16 months and I drink coffee and he isn't affected.  I started drinking it when he was 6 months old.  No problems.  As far as alcohol goes...all is fine in moderation.  Don't get hammered and nurse.  Alcohol leaves breastmilk the same way it leaves the bloodstream so if you have a long gap...like at night if your child sleeps for hours you can have a few drinks.  They say if you don't feel drunk you are probably ok.  www.kellymom.com<br>  <br>  2.  I did for awhile but stopped cause they made me feel sick.  My diet is pretty good and my baby is growing in the higher end of the growth chart ;)  They are more for YOU anyway...your milk will always have good vitamins in it.<br>  <br>  3.  That is your choice.|`|jHmF9Ak1aa	1. Ask your doctor, you should have the same diet you did during pregnancy.<br>  2. Definitely, yes.<br>  3. Breast. I started breast feeding, my son was very jaundice so his pediatrician wanted him on formula until he was better. BIG MISTAKE! Breast feeding can be difficult at first, stick with it. However, if it stresses you out go to a bottle. Don't let anyone tell you what to do. That will only make you feel guilty.|`|c271e0d140cbe1902cabe87b6f0e3485aa	1. Not really - eat well and drink lots of liquids<br>  2. I did take pre-natal vitamins after my babies were born<br>  3. breast feed - it is best|`|1aedb3e2dfe276d9756f4cf4095308efaa	no, although alcohol can pass through<br>  yes or a multi-vitamin<br>  breast|`|nTgNw43gaa	no, yes, and breast feed.  its the best food ever and it tastes good too.|`|6hrpoVUZaa	no, yes, and breast|`|IlIjGTdiaa	1. Yeah, kind of...Eating cabbage while breastfeeding causes your baby to have bad wind which they may not like and will possibly get grumpy. Really spicy food should be avoided if you didn't have it during your pregnancy as it could also cause tummy upset or burning poos. Obviously alcohol intake should be minimal, and caffeine should also be kept down (unfortunately that means chocolate too!)<br>  <br>  2. I took Blackmores Breastfeeding Gold. Vitamins are a controversial subject, but there's no harm, just there may not be any 'help' either.<br>  <br>  3. Definitely breastfeed for at least 1 year.  It may be difficult at first but stick with it, feeding a baby formula is a very selfish thing to do, unless you have legit medical reasons. But if you express then you can bottle feed but the contact between a mum and a baby during breastfeeding is one of the best things ever.<br>  <br>  Best of luck.|`|41e284c4ae4178dd7ffd2cdd7557871daa	1. You want to eat healthy when you breast feed.<br>  2. If your eating correctly you shouldn't have too unless you have a deficit.<br>  3. They say breast feed is best, but it depends on your child. <br>       You can pump breast milk and store it so that way your<br>        mate can enjoy feeding there child as well and it will keep <br>        your child on track with being breast feed.
ZSSUfSXwaa	Look there's more to being a virgin than having intercourse... virgin really means not having had sex.. and well you had oral sex.. and engaged in sexual activities with your partner... very irresponsibly I might add..<br>  the likelihood you're pregnant is close to 0. nothing is exact of course... and the Plan B or the morning after is not supposed to give you any effects.. you'll just get your period normally.<br>  <br>  Next time pack condoms and go to your doctor and talk to him about Birth Control!! AND USE IT!!!|`|laLW1Krwaa	take  a friking test<br>  <br>  Gosh im tired of this question<br>  and no your  not pregnant|`|rdpZrBc9aa	It is possible to get pregnant in that situation.  <br>  <br>  You'll need to wait until your period is due, then test with your first morning urine.

0jtZi1jVaa	It is probably very soothing for the baby. I'm sure it is safe to play. Some people put speakers to their bellies and play classical music to educate the child. So why not guitar?|`|jkDbDjcRaa	I think the baby would like the vibrations!<br>  And as long as it's not overly loud (I'm assuming it's an acoustic, so it wouldn't be)  Then I see no problem with it.|`|PW3hcVZiaa	I would think the baby might enjoy the vibration and sound.|`|dpig5odPaa	It will probably be soothing. I put head head phones on my tummy while I was pregnant to let my baby listen to music and she would "dance". If your using an amp that is where most of the sound comes from. Lots of people put head phones on their tummys while pregnant. It's suppose to be stimulating for the baby. Any how I think it will be fine, your baby will probably like it. Just remember your baby is very well protected in there.|`|SQMMOeqnaa	the baby will LOVE the vibrations and sounds...when the baby is born and you play the guitar to him/her, the baby will recognize that sound and it will soothe him/her
mx3gFmIKaa	Severe hypotonia would cause feeding issues, and gross motor delays.  Hypotonia is seen in several different diagnoses and is usually part of a bigger picture.  Has he had a feeding evaluation?  A barrium swallow test with contrast?  Been to a neurologist?  Can he sit?<br>  <br>  Have you called early intervention to get some therapy going?|`|rdpZrBc9aa	Ask the doctor.|`|v5sZUSD0aa	He probably won't have much muscle tone until he starts walking/moving/running. Either way, I would definitely consult with your pediatrician if you are concerned with his eating habits.

Although it's the smallest park I know of in Fort Worth, it's in the middle of a great, clean, safe, quiet neighborhood, has plenty of trees, a great little playground, tables, a grill, is seldom used, and would be my first choice for a child's party of 20 people or less.<br>  <br>  #2 Trinity Park. Huge park, great playground, pavilions, lots of trees, duck pond, grills, Forest Park Miniature Railroad depot, very busy, great for larger parties, pavilion reservations needed.<br>  <br>  #3 Forest Park. Great playground, next to the zoo, home of Forest Park Miniature Railroad.|`|EN5felveaa	umm hold on im going to search for you!

3EiOobEVaa	I currently have a cerclage. The reason that I have it is because I have an incompetent cervix...I found out with my first pregnancy last year when I went into labor at 21 weeks and my daughter passed because of the pre term labor. I have had a really good outcome. I am now 29 weeks in my second pregnancy with no complications.

DON'T HIDE IT EVEN IF YOUR BOYFRIEND SAYS TOO DON'T.   Be courageous and speak to your parents first!!!!!!  Then you can take it from there.  If your parents are not supportive then seek  POSITIVE support, either through your school counselor or friend.  You greatest support should come from home. <br>  <br>  I'll pray for you take care|`|n53tLT79aa	try not to stress too much before you know the results. there is no point in upsetting yourself if you don't even know if it's for real. take the test tomorrow and then go from there. good luck, whatever happens was meant to be, pregnant or not.
QCUPeW8aaa	Sounds like braxton hicks contractions.<br>  Talk to your doctor if you are concerned.<br>  Good luck|`|53QQ9KXEaa	I think that it'd be best to call up your ob/gyn when you can and tell them what's going on... It might be nothing, but better safe than sorry.|`|1QLp7iC5aa	Depends mostly on where you are feeling the pain, the feeling of uriniation ( when nothing actually comes out) could be a UTI ( urinary tract infection ) they are fairly common in pregnancy, especially if you have had them before. Also, if you pain is up high you're little nudger could have bruised your ribs, although 20 weeks is pretty early for that its not impossible. I would recommend going to see your Dr as soon as possible so that you can be diagnosed properly, you don't want to take any risks! Good luck to you and congratulations! :)|`|cWP73qEsaa	Did the doc say u cant take the pain killers? i thought u could only take regular tylenol, not extra strength but anywho.. the baby is probably right on top of your bladder and is kicking u right there, go to the doc and get an ultrasound if u keep feeling pain and are concerned.|`|zATQaiwIaa	at 20 weeks the kicks should not be that strong - some women are just starting to feel kicks at that point and others not till 22 weeks.  I would definitly call your doctor - and even when you are 38+ weeks pregnant you dont cry from getting a kick from the baby.|`|HEdGGmkhaa	You shouldn't be taking the extra strength tylenol, I was told to only take the regular.<br>  <br>  I would call someone if you are experiencing all of this pain and leaking. It may be nothing but I would rather make sure so call your doc, page him/her and put your mind at rest.|`|g9vw4ovGaa	Call a doctor, seeing that none of us are one. More than likely you're getting kicked in a bladder. Which hurts like a MO FO. But she could kick hard enough and dislodge your bladder or rupture the placenta, nothing to play with. And you're not supposed to be taking any kind of pain medication... ever while your pregnant|`|TLMqNwmMaa	pray & I'll be praying for you :) thats all i got. im sorry. the creator of the universe will help you. Trust me.|`|7zMtmKJaaa	not sure but tell your doctor right away hun.<br>  <br>  goodluck <3
1z3C0R2Vaa	take a test in a weeks time i wish all the best.............|`|xQGCf8GGaa	just do pregnancy test<br>  if it is positive then u need to take care<br>  if u want to be pragnant then its ok or else u need to get rid of it<br>  here are some name of pills<br>  M.P.FORTE, REGULIN FORTE<br>  take it for prevention of pregnancy|`|PElSsv7Maa	the spotting that you saw might be a result of slight internal abrasion. it happens sometimes and nothing to worry but as far as implantation bleeding is the concern, it takes at least 6 days for that as far as my knowledge goes. but the best way is to wait till your periods date or two week from the day u had sex and take a preg test! good luck!|`|HEdGGmkhaa	Too early for implantation, assuming you did get pregnant, implantation takes place 6-12 days from conception so I think you are just having an off period or stressing about this a bit too much.<br>  <br>  Good luck|`|hYRYO5GYaa	it ussually takes 5-10 days for implantation bleeding, so i would wait a week or 2|`|7zMtmKJaaa	wait til your period was/is supposed to start and take a preg test.<br>  <br>  <br>  goodluck <3|`|LBfD7tbHaa	you can test in three days time...
J3yUXKiyaa	More teeth could be coming...she might even be starting her 1 year molars...those can take forever to cut, and I'm pretty sure they hurt like heck coming in.<br>  <br>  Just keep trying - she honestly will not starve herself.  She'll eat.|`|FfGHHhqBaa	could be manny things, teeth, she is going threw a growth spurt, just ask you doc im sure she is fine.|`|m6GSXW40aa	well i think she might just be going through a stage! Idk for sure though. have you tried those peda a lite drink things? they are like a milk thing but has like vitamins and stuff in it?
BHnAwYywaa	I was the same. I'm 23 weeks now and I've only just started putting back on the weight I lost in the first trimester. I also had extreme nausea that landed me in hospital and on bed rest for weeks. I lost a heap of weight too. You'll be fine, start eating more foods more frequently and drink full cream milk until you start noticing you are putting on some weight.<br>  Your baby will take all the nutrients he/she needs from your body, don't worry too much about the weight loss.<br>  Good luck|`|xvCvd5xhaa	I wouldn't worry about it to much, I'm a mother of five, and every one of my pregnancies was different. Some I would gain, some I wouldn't gain at all, which was good all around. If you feel like you're to the point where you are constantly sick and you are constantly dropping weight, I would call your OBGYN immediately to make an appointment, or just to get some advice from he or she. After all they are the experts. <br>  You are having your first pregnancy so it is different the first time around. Hope this helps, good luck.|`|bmrQQOJjaa	I am 18 weeks and am still 3 pounds less than when I found out I was pregnant and I keep losing. My doctor told me to eat 6 small meals a day because I am having a hard time eating more at meals. She said that will increase my food intake overall and I should start gaining. I would not worry too much though, as long as baby is growing and getting bigger you will be alright.|`|a6e7SRYzaa	My mom lost a lot of weight in the beginning with both of her pregnancies because she was so sick in the beginning. But she ended up have babies that were over 10 lbs. Don't worry doesn't mean yours will be that big. I'm just saying it's actually quite common to lose weight in the beginning due to being sick.|`|IX9znFLAaa	This happened to a good friend of mine as well.  The doctor said it was normal as long as she still ate right and took her prenatals.  The cause for worry comes if you still are loosing weight when you start your third trimester.<br>  <br>  relax and congrats!|`|6L9jJnchaa	I started out at 165, and went all the way down to 152.<br>  <br>  Now I'm 23 weeks pregnant and still only 157 pounds.  As long as you are taking your vitamins, eating, and keeping yourself hydrated, you'll be fine.|`|8c4kRTnPaa	I'm 14 weeks pregnant too, and I have lost about 5 pounds. I feel like this is unhealthy but the doctor says not to worry and you will gain weight.<br>  congrats :)|`|a37f465fb3af30fb69356b87ea42c178aa	It is quiet normal to lose weight during the first trimester especially if you have been sick. Don't stress I'm sure something would of been picked up at your first pre-nat appointment if something was wrong. But if you are still worried it won't hurt to maybe have a chat with your GP :)<br>  <br>  You will start to put on weight in the next couple weeks now you are into your second trimester. Good luck hun :)|`|QCUPeW8aaa	Im 31 weeks along and at this point I have just recently gained 10 pounds.<br>  Up until than I too was losing weight and everything is okay with me.<br>  My pregnancy book says the average person has already gained about 25 pounds at my point but my doctor sees no problem and my baby is gaining weight as needed.<br>  Good luck to you!|`|7zMtmKJaaa	its probably the nause that is making you lose weight.<br>  <br>  I'm 11 weeks and I've been gaining for my stupid cravings.<br>  <br>  good luck <3|`|hYRYO5GYaa	i lost weight when the first 8-10 weeks because i was always sick and couldn't keep anything down. also stress can cause weight loss|`|35kVNi5oaa	maybe it's just because you were sick..?|`|SlAcbL7Xaa	i lost weight up until like my 26 week
Cx5Zo7IIaa	If you really think you are in labor and want to stop it, go to the ER or you can drink half a shot of liquor. It will stop you from going into labor. Before they had all these different medications for preterm labor, they would actually use a IV of alcohol to arrest labor. I'm not suggesting getting drunk but for it to be used in a medicinal fashion.|`|xvCvd5xhaa	It sounds like you're doing to much, and need to rest for you and your baby, it's false labor. I had that during my 37 weeks to, and then it would stop. If you try just laying on your side, and keep your feet up you'll be a little bit more comfortable then where you are at now. I would just take it easy though cause it could lead into early labor and at this stage, your baby should be okay, but I would check with your doctor if you think you are in labor. <br>  I would also keep everything written down for your doctor so you can tell them when they see it. Good luck, and I hope all works out for ya. My fifth child was born March 18th, and she was at 37 weeks to, so it should be all good. Good luck, and congrats.|`|vKEYa8aeaa	call the labor and delivery of the hospital you are going to deliver at, talk to a nurse and tell her exactly whats going on...you could very well be going into labor! =D she/he will tell you exactly what to do and when to come in CONGRATS|`|W1p6LetFaa	If they stopped, it sounds as if you had a very convincing case of false labor.  It might be very hard for you to tell when you are truly in labor, so keep that doctor on speed dial and keep timing your contractions!  Otherwise, call your doctor and see what he thinks.  You could actually be in labor but it just stalled for some reason.  I personally think it was false labor, but hang in there, cuz I bet the real thing is right around the corner!  <br>  <br>  Best wishes to you and your little one!|`|uQc4UA2Caa	i definately think its going to be very soon. if it were happening like that to me i'd go to the doctors and see if im dialated. <br>  i personally would be very excited because i would assume labour will be anytime now :)<br>  hopefully u dont have back labour but they can check for that as well|`|QCUPeW8aaa	It is possible but its hard to say.<br>  Labor could come tomarrow or in 3 weeks like your expected.<br>  Its almost impossible to determine until they get closer together.<br>  Good luck =D<br>  <br>  Oh yeah and your baby is due on my birthday!<br>  I too was born on a friday the 13!!|`|PZjTc0geaa	They're no longer called Braxton Hicks- those are REAL contractions! Yay!! =)<br>  <br>  You are probably in the early stages of labor. However, if they become to uncomfortable or 5 minutes (or less) apart, you need to go to the hospital. It's not unusual for women to deliver from 36 wks on. Babies at that age are usually just fine.|`|PElSsv7Maa	i feel you are experiencing a prep! i had the same thing and was hospitalised thrice before i actually delivered. the best is to inform the hospital and if the discomfort is unbearable, it is wiser to go to the hospital as that is more safe and peaceful! good luck!!|`|J3yUXKiyaa	Your body is warming up, that's for sure.  You may get a few more of these false starts - but one of these times it will just keep getting worse.  Good luck!  <br>  <br>  Back labour sucks...been there.  Ow.|`|SQMMOeqnaa	this sounds like what i went through..i would say that labor is coming fast, probably within the next week..|`|W4J7Ary0aa	I am in the same boat. They say that it is braxtons becasue they don't cause the cervix to dilate. I went in to the hospital 2-3 mins apart at 2cm they had me walk for an hour and it changed to 2.5cm then i was told to walk again after that hour no change so they sent me home. You could be having on again off again braxtons or labor. i can't tell anymore cuz it hurts bad but every time i am checked they say no change. I am 40 weeks and 2 days pregnant. My back hurts all the time especially the lower back nothing helps it. But for you i could mean it is coming soon depending on your cervix and effacement. Try not to worry too much all it did was stress me out.
alssEcoKaa	Say it was that or vodka.  Take your pick.|`|KUxEBQuYaa	im sure if your dr said its okay. but ive never heard of that before. im sure you dont let me drink alot, just a sip of cold coffee.im sure there is a good reason behind it.<br>  as for how to get them to shut up. when you find the answer to that, let us know.|`|aJLx0nhNaa	I sincerely hope you are just trolling.<br>  <br>  Why on earth would you give an infant coffee?|`|h59Bc4wfaa	Umm...my son had to have caffeine when he was in the NICU to SPEED up his heart. It was to make him more alert and more active. I think your doc might be a little off his rocker, and caffeine is caffeine no matter what the age, it's still going to act as a stimulant.|`|yCwPxulYaa	I think that that is insane and that you need to get a new doctor.  <br>  <br>  That is a horrible way to get your child to sleep.|`|ErCJnABBaa	Don't tell them you give your infant black coffee.|`|mjz8JF9Gaa	tell them not their child none of there buniness|`|MeYILJeSaa	What?<br>  That makes no sense to me?

f9d939f08aa68a4ec14cbfe2f204cf30aa	No,<br>  <br>  It is as simple as that.|`|a8e2130188e45facab4c16a4a764104caa	And do they have the right to drive a motor vehicle at 5 years of age?<br>  Etc., etc.<br>  "Rights" are somewhat dependent on age, maturity, ability, etc.<br>  <br>  Instead of spanking them, why not assess a "fine", like adults sometimes are.  How about $100 for not doing the dishes, etc., etc.  Or put them in gaol (jail) for a couple of days?<br>  <br>  What I am saying is that "civil rights" vary with age, etc.<br>  .<br>  Actually, there are forms of punishment that can be effective on some children at some ages. Take away privileges, etc., etc.  BUT a swift spanking will work more effectively on some kids.<br>  .|`|prqrQcd1aa	I don't condone or condemn spanking, but no as long as you are not leaving marks while doing it, and you are saving it as a last resort.. that is my own opinion on this...to each his own.|`|rhPCJfeuaa	Are you kidding?  If we applied that line of reasoning, children could refuse medical care that we deemed necessary, quit school at any age, take up drinking and smoking, and vote for the person who looks most like their Barbie and Ken doll.  I spank occasionally, and as a last resort when nothing else I have tried has gotten through.  One or two swats on the rump or a swat to the hand.  My children are pleasant to be around and are admired for their behavior.  They are kind and respectful of their friends and elders.  Very affectionate and lively.  last time I checked, that didn't sound like any abused children I've ever read about or heard about.  For once and for all, can people come away from the edge and realize that discipline and abuse are not one and the same??  It's also people who tsk tsk at my right to spank who will be first in line if they misbehave as teenagers.|`|0e0a0f1828f99f87ea3d5e5bc8cbd46daa	YES they should have the same rights as any other adult out there who is being abused. There are TONS of other punishments that don't cause physical harm, the problem is that parents are NOT Creative enough and resort to spanking out of their frustration and anger with the child.|`|qYZ2QFlbaa	I'm not really envisioning myself as a parent that spanks. My parents didn't spank me. Not gonna say I turned out perfectly, far from it :) The only thing I can think of, is I remember when I was young, I bit my dad. He bit me back. I never bit again :)<br>  <br>  As long as the spanking is not done in anger, and is not excessive, it should not be made illegal.|`|P5Iq6nufaa	No. Let's ask if children should have the same civil rights as adults. Adults have the right to refuse medical treatment, should children have the right to refuse the treatment their parents believe they need? Adults have the right to refuse to not go to school. Should children have that same right? How about smoking? How about alcohol? Living on their own? Are you serious with this idea that children should have the same rights as adults? Sometimes a spanking is the best thing for a child, and if done in a non-abusive manner a parent needs to discipline in the manner that is fitting.|`|qTVkydt1aa	I don't think it's a violation of anything.<br>  It's honestly a parent's right.  I disagree with it completely, but I don't look down upon those who use that tactic.<br>  <br>  I think a lot of other forms of punishment are effective, I don't like the idea of a person taking out their anger and aggression on a child, even if it's not physically harmful.  There's really only one lesson to be learned, which is that it's okay to hit if it's for your advantage.<br>  <br>  I don't think that spanked children are going to grow up to be abusers or criminals or anything, just regular people.  But it's really just a scary thing that I don't think kids should go through.  I know it has benefits, for the parent, but I don't think it's worth it at all.  =)|`|6253169b02f2076d996076889f0591d0aa	Of course it is. And you guys, you don't have real arguments, so why don't you just stop it. There is a difference between human rights and rights such as having a credit card or ****. Hitting violates human rights. It needs to be illegal. That doesn't mean that children should have all the rights adults have, but they deserve the same rights when it comes to things like assault, physical inviolability is a human right! And by the way, in the States, even children can go to jail for a very long time if they've commited a crime. So it is okay that they take responsibility, but they don't have the same human rights??|`|PxawVQ7Xaa	Yes they should, except driving and stuff like that for obvious reasons, but they have the same rights to self defense and to live in peace. <br>  <br>  Parental rights don't include being ever to do what ever you feel like, I guess we should bring wife beating back too, the exact same logic you use to justify hitting children was the same that was used to justify wife beating "my house, my money, I provide for them, the bible said so etc"<br>  <br>  Why do people have to make such stupid comparisons, life saving surgery is necessary where as hitting people isn't.|`|eya1WDS4aa	I think your one of those parents that's kids are gonna be running wild.  As long as the parent isn't flat out beating them i dont see what the problem is with spanking. I will give my 22 month old one swat on the butt if i count to 3 and he doesn't listen. He used to be a terror in public and now since we started  with a swat he has been an angel. And no they shouldn't have the same rights...if they had the same rights then parents coudnt be parents and raise their kids. Its people like that that think spanking is so horrible and would call cps just because you have your child a swat in wal mart that i hate. Its not child abuse.|`|kCiizn5oaa	Exactly. Why adults think it's ok to hit their kids I don't know.|`|692c8795f68a0ba95a0d09139d70c98caa	That's stupid.<br>  <br>  I guess we will just throw our kids in jail when their bad, that way they can be equal to adults.|`|pnL5WTXMaa	no it is not, child abuse is however.|`|wDLzu5m2aa	First, children are not equivalent to adults under the law, so are not covered the same under the law. Spanking is a corporal form of punishment used by parents as far back in history as we can see. However, excessive corporal punishment is abuse and does violate the law. There are always alternatives in any form of punishment and hurting the child should not be the motive. The onus is on the parent or guardian to find the best possible course of action and to keep the interest of the child's welfare first and foremost.|`|sp1x3ZUAaa	They are children, and do not have the judgement or experience of an adult... They are and will be children I think until they are 18 or so.<br>  But this doesn't mean they are immature, it doesn't mean they don't think for themselves, it doesn't mean they are wrong.<br>  While they can't have the same civil rights as adults (which is probably a good thing)... spanking is pretty wrong, I think.<br>  Children are PEOPLE - you don't groom or raise a person to be perfect, you wouldn't hit another person, you care about peoples feelings, etc.<br>  Also, remember that kids have personalities, and thoughts, and memories... they are themselves, and sometimes you can't change them.. why would you want to, really?<br>  They might end up hating you or having serious problems.|`|ApX89NKiaa	I read a book on teen laws and up until they're about 12-14 as long as you don't leave any long term marks you can spank a child. But no the teen rights book said we have NO rights until were 18 (not including parent permission stuff)<br>  In all honesty the reward category works but nothing gets me straightened out than the sight of my dads belt.
KUxEBQuYaa	no its fine, they do need to learn how to fall asleep on their own. my son wakes up in the am. he cries for like 30 secs and by the time im out of bed going down the hall, he is already asleep. lol. dont feel bad.|`|YuqTcSSDaa	No, your not a bad parent, but you have to have your sanity too and you have to let her get on a schedule. Parents do it everyday and they have been for years. There is nothing that says your a bad parent for letting your baby cry. My son is 22 months and still has nights like that once in a while. I let him cry it out if nothing else works. Eventually, she will be on a schedule and get the hint.|`|aca803aafd407291581b58b9be71df4daa	When my son was 10 months old I started putting him down and patting his bottom for 2 min, then I would leave the room for 5 min.  I repeated this until he would fall asleep.  I did this everynight and it took me 2 hours to get him to go to sleep for the first few nights...but in a week he was doing great.  Sleeping 6 hour stretches!!<br>  <br>  I think it is a gentle approach to CIO but I am sure some will disagree.  I was they type that would nurse everytime he woke up and he started waking up every hour.  I was so mentally and physically exhausted that I had to try a new approach.  So I started the 2 in and 5 out method.  I had to literally teach him to fall asleep again.  It was rough but we are both happier.  He naps well now and he is happy throughout the day.<br>  <br>  you are a good mom.  Don't worry....your baby needs sleep and so do you.|`|SQMMOeqnaa	my son is 6 months and fights with a temper tantrum to go to sleep..i have let him just cry himself to sleep several times and he learned that when its time to go night night, its time to go night night...it doesnt make you a bad parent...it is what it is|`|aJLx0nhNaa	What time did you put her to sleep?  I think small doses of cry it out can be effective, but not for hours.  Also, if you put her down at, for example, 7PM, 2 hours later she is not necessarily fed with a clean diaper anymore, you know?<br>  <br>  I don't think that letting babies cry hurts them, but I don't necessarily think that long stretches of crying teaches them anything either.<br>  <br>  Have you addressed this issue using other methods?  An earlier bedtime and frequent naps are helpful in getting some infants to sleep through the night.<br>  <br>  This doesn't make you a bad parent and she's not damaged.  You just need to think through what the goals are.  If the goal was just to get her to sleep that one night, well that worked.  If the goal is to help her learn to sleep every night, I think you need to re-think your strategy.|`|IGcS9K62aa	Don't feel like a bad parent. They need to 'cry it out' WITHIN reason. My daughter is 5 months and sleeps through the night (12 hours). I'd like to think my approach as helped some! <br>  <br>  I talked to her doctor about it (she's a great dr). She said up to 20 minutes of fussing is okay. You don't want relentless screaming though.  If she is screaming, or goes past the 20 minutes I'll pick her up calm her and put her back down. And repeat that as necessary. She needs to learn to soothe herself. . . Make sure she's going down sleepy but not asleep. That'll help her get better at it!<br>  <br>  There's an approach to 'crying it out'. You don't neglect your child by any means. But you have to let them work through their emotions. Once their needs are met including happy and content they need to learn to finish the rest. I won't let my daughter scream uncontrollably. But she'll make noise and fuss it out sometimes--especially when she is REALLY tired. <br>  <br>  Establishing a bedtime routine is really helpful. Whether it be reading 2 books and putting pj's on, or taking a bath winding down is essential to an easier night!|`|yYZTfwT8aa	I know it sounds horrible but my daughter is 11 now & healthy as a horse, in cheer-leading, softball, scouts she's thin as a rail & strong as an ox.  BUT when she & her twin brother were 6 months old she went through this phase of "I hate the bed"   It didn 't matter if she was already asleep!  being horizontal would wake her up.  No she did not have reflux, or gas, or a full diaper, she was washed, lotioned so she wasn't itchy, had socks & jammies on so she wasn't cold, fed & burped.  She just hated being sideways.   I got an open topped swing from a second hand store for $10 that was battery operated.  And that's where she slept!  I would only put her in it at bed time & make sure that she was very sleepy.    Eventually she got to big for the swing.  But a person has to sleep sometime.  <br>  <br>  I dont think letting her cry herself to sleep is evil.  But being a new mom at the time I couldn't handle it & used the swing.  None of my other children went through this.  I learned to give them plenty of active play time & bouncy exercise, then to feed, burp & bath before bed.  That seems to be a good recipe for going to sleep ;)   <br>  <br>  Some moms have yelled at me for it but they weren't the ones crying from exhaustion! <br>  <br>  Another thing that might help is not to give her a nap that lasts to late.  Make sure that she is awake for a good 7 hours at least before bedtime.  So if you put her to bed at 9 she needs to be done with her afternoon nap by 2:pm.  Start to work on wearing her out with active play about three hours before bed.  Then food, burp, bath then bed.  Don't make it too dark, try some soft lullaby 'muzak'.  <br>  <br>  If you know that you have done all you that you can do, go breathe and KNOW that she is okay and she will eventually go to sleep.  <br>  <br>  good luck.|`|1SGl03Zlaa	My daughter fought sleep from 3 months until 14 months.  It didn't matter what I tried there was no way to get her to give in and go to sleep.  Finally at 14 months I gave in and let her cry it out, within days she was going to sleep fine on her own.  I think me being with her was the reason she had been fighting sleep for so long, if I was there she wanted to play but when she was in her crib by herself she realized it was time to sleep.<br>  You are not a bad parent so don't feel guilty and ignore all the negative comments you'll receive.  By allow your child to fall asleep by herself you are teaching her good sleeping habits and that she does not need to rely on you to get to sleep.  The first few days are hard but it does get better.  When I put my daughter in her crib for bed now she grabs her blankets and giggles and doesn't put up a fight.  As long as you know there is no reason other than not wanting to go to sleep that she is crying there is nothing wrong with letting her cry a bit to unwind.|`|jCy0J2ueaa	I am really torn about this i have a one year old son that sleeps in my bed because he will not sleep by himself i talked to his doc and they told me to do the whole crying to sleep thing i tried but i just cant do it to him. i feel like he thinks "why is she not coming im really scared, doesnt she love me" i also feel like he will not have confdince in me if i dont come when he needs me. I wish there was a better way to do it. i hope you get some good answers. Sorry i didnt help|`|SaRDq9iLaa	You aren't a bad parent.  I agree with the first mommy.  Babies do need to learn to fall asleep on his/her own.  My daughter cries because she wants to be held all day and night, which is unrealistic.  I know she is not hungry, wet or hurt so I let her soothe herself.  Now she is able to calm herself down without me right there.  I know it is hard to hear her cry but you are not neglecting her and you are NOT a bad mommy!
VyroqDxAaa	No only if he was positive, does it matter with you being negative. Even so it's an easy fix, you just get a couple shots during and after pregnacy. I know I have the RH factor, it's really not a big deal unless you don't get the shots.|`|DhmUgq0maa	Only if the mother is Rh negative and if she is she will need to get a shot in early pregnancy to prevent her from loosing the baby.<br>  My nephews gf is Rh negative and lost 3 babies before they finally gave her the shot an she is now expecting a healthy baby in a few weeks.|`|23c99fcd4aa2aac54a97abdb713c5f5eaa	Only matters what the mother is. I am Rh negative and I just get a shot before the baby is born and one after delivery. No big deal.|`|7fcZu8v8aa	Nope, if you are both Rh negative your baby can only be Rh negative, and so your immune system will not attack the fetus.
KUxEBQuYaa	what> your baby has batteries??|`|aJLx0nhNaa	Well I know this is a school project but if it were a real newborn I might be worried.  How old are these robot babies supposed to be?|`|C8fBt7Rxaa	Babies who sleep on their stomachs sleep 19 hours a day during their their first 4 weeks of life. Babies that sleep on their backs sleep 15 hours a day on average during their first 4 weeks of life. For the first 6 months of life babies who sleep on their stomachs sleep an average of 225 hours more than babies that sleep on their backs (Davis, Moon, 1998)<br>  <br>  You may want to try putting him to sleep on his stomach. Prior to 1992 over 70% of U.S. babies slept on their stomachs. You may want to let him sleep on your stomach first though to see how he likes it.<br>  <br>  Infants who sleep on their backs compared to infants who sleep on their stomachs have increased rates of: <br>  - Social skills delays at 6 months (Dewey, Fleming, et al, 1998) <br>  - Motor skills delays at 6 months (Dewey, Fleming, et al, 1998) <br>  - gastroesophageal reflux (GER) (Corvaglia, 2007) <br>  - Milestone delays (Davis, Moon, et al., 1998)<br>  - Plagiocephaly, Torticollis, Strabismus, etc. etc.<br>  <br>  Plus, stomach sleep tends to prevent hip subluxation and reduce the symptoms of colic.<br>  <br>  Here are my thoughts on back sleep. If a doctor was presented with a baby that had social skills delays, motor skills delays, and gastroesophageal reflux what would a doctor say if a child had these three things but not too bad. The doctor might tell the parent to be patient and that different kids develop differently. But, what if the case was more severe - what if the kids social skills were worse? The doctor might diagnose him with ADHD. But, what if the kids delays were really far behind - that is the kid had very large delays in social skills and motor skills? The doctor might diagnose him with Autism Spectrum Disorder. I think part (if not all) of the Autism Epidemic is caused by the SIDS Back to Sleep campaign. This is totally unrelated to plagiocephaly (flat head syndrome) only that plagiocephaly could be used as a marker for how well the parents followed the SIDS Back to Sleep advice. This is just my theory.<br>  <br>  <a href="http://fourfactortheory.blogspot.com/" rel="nofollow">http://fourfactortheory.blogspot.com/</a>
OrKpKxkHaa	That is a tough situation. Unless he is baptizing him into a cult or some satanic religion, I would let him do it his way and you can do it your way. With parents of different religious backgrounds, you have no choice really but to expose the child to both and let him or her decide when they are older. If he isnt on the birth certificate, he probably can't get a copy unless he can prove paternity through a test or court papers. I would try and back off a little though, he will have the rigth to see his son and feeding him tea (while its not ideal) will not get his visitation taken away. You two are only going to hurt your son in the end so try and be as friendly as possible. Maybe if you are more neutral, he will take some of you suggestions during visitation and you can bring him something from the Dr talking about when he will be ready for different foods. He might have left you while pregnant because pregnant women arent babies. When a parent sees a living, breathing being, they most likely become attached. It is different seeing than just thinking about it so maybe that is why he has recently taken an intrest. Try and lighten up a little as long as he isnt doing anything to cause great harm. Good luck!|`|LbGRsCTKaa	Besides all the other problems with the baby's father,  letting him have your baby "sprinkled" at this young age won't hurt him.   Since you're a Baptist and  I'm sure you believe in immersion, your son can make his own decision when he's old enough to be immersed.|`|uYw8XT1Caa	Personally, I would wait a little while to get him baptized if you are having an argument over weather he should be baptist or catholic. Then, when you are ready, have him sit down and talk about what you think is best for the little boy. Right now, it's all about him. Always put his needs in front of yours. As for giving him the birth certificate? I would say "no, not at the moment" and tell him you need to sit down. I am personally Catholic, but remember to do what's best for the little boy.|`|cWP73qEsaa	if u dont give him the birth certificate he cant get it from anywhere esle if his name is not on it. but if he is on the babies birth certificate as the father he does have a right to get one|`|Grb85RJuaa	Here's an idea. Let him decide if he wants to be baptized or not when he gets older. Or I guess you could just push your religion on him.|`|qcjAg3yOaa	Well, I had my son baptized catholic and they did not need my sons birth certificate, so that's kinda odd he said he needs it. <br>  <br>  Thats not fair for him to choose without your approval beings its your child too! If i were you I would contact their church and tell them the situation. <br>  No i wouldnt be t2 happy about the tea thing.. My in laws tried something like that with my son once.. I would have a talk to the babys dad about what not to feed baby... maybe make a list.|`|GhZQGu9Maa	This sounds terrible!  An immature man will sometimes use a child to take out revenge on the mother or simply to exert some kind of control because he's not mature enough to control his own life.  Often they're not truly interested in the child and wouldn't want the daily grind of caring for him, but want to prove their manhood so they'll pretend to be dad a little at a time.  A woman who is near him will end up taking care of your child- your ex's mother, his sister or new girlfriend.  Sometimes a guy will use a baby as a prop to make him seem like a good man in the eyes of his new girlfriend.  Your ex shouldn't be able to do anything without having his name on your child's birth certificate, however, did you realize that if he's proven to be the father by a paternity test, he can HAVE HIS NAME PLACED ON THE BIRTH CERTIFICATE himself without your consent?  This situation could end up terribly.  A good friend of mine raised her child with her new husband for 6 years.  Her ex- the father- didn't want the kid and was very hateful.  After 6 years when she was at a vulnerable time in her life and her marriage, her ex got out of prison and in a few months was able to TAKE HER CHILD FROM HER!!!  The kid doesn't even know this guy!  The guy treats the kid much differently than she does and says awful things to him about his mother.  I strongly suggest you either put your foot down and get a counselor/mediator to work something out with him or secretly save your money to move far away.  If you choose to move away, I wouldn't tell him until it's time to move- that way you can say you did the right thing by telling him, but he wouldn't have very much time to stop you or follow you.  Don't hint that you're moving, don't threaten him with it, don't tease him- just do it and tell him riiiiiiiiight before it's done.  In the meantime, hire a lawyer.  Your ex has something up his sleeve.  (I wouldn't tell the lawyer that you want to move away either.)  Good luck to you.|`|GygtNmV3aa	Um, I don't know how easy it would be to get his Birth Certificate since he's a minor. But I know with me, I had lost mine and only had to make a phone call and it was mailed later. This may be harder since you can't really fake being an infant and calling for it lol. But as for the baptism thing, I...want to have my child dedicated back to God when I have one, but I'm baptist as well, I don't much think I'd like to have my baby baptised by catholics...Nothing against them personally, but I'd rather have it be in my own denomination. And there will be plenty of people saying things like it should choose for itself. And when its old enough, it sure can, but while I'm providing clothes, food, and shelter...it can go to church with me :)   But, the good news is, even if he's baptised in another church its such a young age, that I don't think it will much influence the outcome of his future. Good luck getting everything settled.|`|LzfBqy6Oaa	its great that you both want to get your baby baptised(seems like the only thing u agree on) however the church does not accept broken marriages. so therefore if the church is fair dinkum they will not aloud its father to get it baptised. all this arguing is placing allot of pressure on your baby and it will never be able to have a normal life. i say that you keep the birth certificate  with you and if it gets worse take it to court.<br>  he sounds like a rotten man and i dont believe he should have anything to do with your baby. <br>  you say that yr son has to be older.... not necessarily.. the sooner the better. and i beleive you should spend more time with your partner before u decide to have children<br>  =D<br>  =D
c271e0d140cbe1902cabe87b6f0e3485aa	Congratulations and Well Done!<br>  <br>  It is great to plan to breast feed for a year, and if I were you I would just replace one feed at a time, perhaps the lunch time feed could be replaced by milk in a sippy cup (you could just skip bottles all together).<br>  <br>  Gradually, one by one, you can drop feeds and replace with milk or diluted fruit juice, until you are left with just the early morning feed and the last feed of the day.<br>  <br>  By then you may not have much milk left and your daughter will lose interest, because she will probably be eating quite a bit of solid food, so milk will not be as necessary for her as it is now.<br>  <br>  Good Luck!|`|bQTATDTyaa	Milk shouldn't replace feedings from formula or nursing. 12 oz a day is fine with meals. <br>  <br>  Make sure she is eating real food by that time, and staying hydrated with water, and as long as she has no allergies you can add a little milk at 10 months but again not to replace food.<br>  <br>  For weaning make sure you don't rush or you could get engorged and stress her out.|`|sePLvA8Gaa	Yes you would still start her on cows milk not soy.  DONT USE A BOTTLE GO STRAIGHT TO A SIPPY CUP!  She could have maybe two small sippy cups of cow's milk a day and you could still nurse her as much as you wanted, breast milk is pure vitamins and she can have as much as she wants.  Its really hard to over feed with breast milk.|`|QgYQVQORaa	I don't know about the amount, never got a great answer from my pediatrician. I also planned to wean my last one at a year. He's 20 mos old and going strong, about 3-4 times and a day and a couple times during the night. After having nursed three babies, I know that the the bedtime feeding is the hardest one to break, it would be a good idea to give her a sippy cup at bedtime anytime from now but before one year. Formula works fine until she is a year unless you want to pump.Research horomones in cows milk before you decide on milk and research benefits of soy milk. There are drawbacks to cow. My baby took an extra interest in the breast around 12 to 13 months that's why he is still nursing . Start now with skipping one feeding for about a week before you take away another. offer sippy cup of milk or soy instead of boo bee if she doesn't want any thats ok she will be taking more milk from you at the next feeding anyway.Get her down to 3 or 4 sessions a day, slowly,  If you wait til she is a year you may not have her weened for a couple months or so after that.Good Luck lots of prayers!|`|V5Mw6rUtaa	one year is a good age to start weening. The milk choice is one you will have to decide on. What do you drink? She is going to start drinking and eating regular food soon and will be getting most of her nutritional needs from her meals, so don't worry about that. A lot of women will cut breast feedings down to only before naps and bed time and slowly ween from there. A good bed time routine and a sippy cup with water will help in the transition. Beware it will not be easy and she will resist at first. But new options can be exciting for her too. <br>  <br>  Best of luck.|`|KmC0K59taa	Just start by removing one nursing session every week or every few days.  Replace the nursing with whole milk or a snack.  Get it down to once a day, probably bedtime, then stop completely.
53Yp0Zsmaa	Its okay.<br>  maybe she wants more attention.<br>  or mayeb she just need her space.<br>  and im 15, i used to fight a lott with my mom when i was 13 and then when i was 14 i just argued constantly wiht my dad..<br>  mayeb its like..growing up.|`|upK8oN2oaa	Very normal and she will continue to flip back and forward between fighting with one of you, if its not too serious I wouldn't worry about it, but of course you should never let her manipulate you or her father.|`|8cd6d1064a8d6379febc6914e867a26baa	Its rebellion.<br>  Teens rebel against their parents when they want something.<br>  They are stuck in the middle of being a kid, and an adult.<br>  They want more freedom, but cant have it. (Driving: Too young, etc.)<br>  Its normal.|`|w2kofruFaa	Well, I turn sixteen in a little over a month, and my situation is a little a different because my parents are divorced.. but if I had to guess, it's just her hormones, social pressures, attitude, and of course, rebellious side. Just make sure everything is in line before she gets her license and car because you don't want her out doing things that may get her hurt (which she'll probably try anyway.) Hold her close and keep her innocent as long as possible...|`|7mKNHl2zaa	its normal. im 15 and i hate my parents some tomes and other times they are great. honestly i dont know how they deal with me
s3pkM64faa	My doctor told me they usually occur during ovulation, because that was my concern as well. I have been taking ovulation tests and they come out positive that I am ovulating. I would definitely ask your doctor if you have more questions.|`|CJkrXeDgaa	yes.|`|Fwm6lHmpaa	yes i got preg and had a cyst
KUxEBQuYaa	nope its fine. my son did the same thing.|`|mjz8JF9Gaa	so normal hes going to sleep more cuz his bellys full <br>  i did it and it was good but for me it go to to be a hassle <br>  <br>  watch out ur going to get some pretty mean answers but none of what they are going to say happened to my son<br>  <br>  i thought u said six weeks im sorry my answer is so irrelvent now|`|02afccc3abbd7877c182c4b1daa8d2a9aa	There is nothing wrong with that and you might even try mixing some of the cereal with his formula and spoon feeding him.  He'll still get his bottle and still be full.<br>  <br>  Use the cereal in the morning, give him some of the bottle and then the cereal mixed with formula.  A little bit of cereal and then a drink of the bottle.  Usually ends up with finishing the bottle because he's already ate the cereal.  Do the same thing when it's dinner time for you and then he'll have another bottle before bedtime and all is good.|`|jn34aSgHaa	its perfectly normal the reason why he sleeps more is becaus ehe is actrully more full than with just formula alone but you should always contact your doc for advice but at 6 moths he will be fine!! i stared my son on cereal with formula when he was 2 months, he was 10lbs and nothing seam to fill him but when i started the cereal he also sleept more. so dont worry its fine.|`|04dc0d2596b5e8336fe567281e72fb2faa	The rice takes longer to digest and makes him feel full longer, so he doesn't wake hungry as early.It is absolutely normal for baby to sleep longer once he is on cereal.|`|7OLg13B8aa	Yes its normal.Hes getting full with cereal so it makes him sleep longer.He doesn't need to wake up for a bottle having his belly full,Enjoy the lil time you have for your self|`|DzunYgWOaa	my children are grown, i gave all 5 of them cereal when they were 2 and 3 months old, it will make them sleep better because their belly's are full and they are more content.|`|YuqTcSSDaa	Totally normal. His tummy is full so he will sleep longer. When he starts baby food it will be the same way. Then he will start getting bursts of energy again and burning off all that food. A baby will go through different stages of sleep patterns.|`|vewYW4wcaa	as long as you only give him about a table spoon of cereal in his bottle is ok. try putting him in his high chair and mixing some formula and cereal to make a runny cereal and see how he likes it.|`|75c40712ce4c1c9063d61b17387937f9aa	cereal takes longer to break down and digest, so he will feel fuller longer. don't worry, you want them to sleep longer:) thats the goal! he will let you know when hes hungry :)
Cx5Zo7IIaa	Washing the skin with fresh buttermilk, and then rinsing it well with warm water maintains the pH balance of the skin, thereby making it a difficult proposition for bacteria to thrive. It's also an astringent.|`|qcjAg3yOaa	Never tried it.. I've heard of some shampoos having organic milk in it.. but not milk alone.

I was watching little miss perfect last night on we tv because i couldn't sleep (gotta love pregnancy) and those poor little girls is all i can say. i feel bad for them and alot of them are not even in it because they enjoy it they are in it because its the parents dream and not the child's dream. i dont think little girls that age should even be wearing make up. Seeing the looks on those little girls faces broke my heart. They just looked like they wanted to cry because they didn't win anything...i think those pageants are just setting your child up for self esteem issues. Im glad to hear your not one of those parents that forces their kids into this, good for you mom!|`|EsRuOno1aa	I think making your little girl look like a mini-whore is horrible and I commend you for not doing that. Little girls should look like little girls.|`|aaQ5qQ6naa	who cares? thanks for the two points.|`|TslWCjklaa	This isn't a question.|`|rrMYRLpXaa	XD Haha. Ignore the people saying that this was a terrible question. :) I think it was very interesting. Even though your daughter said it wasn't that fun, this was probably a great experience for her. It'll stick with her. <br>  <br>  Speaking of, I once saw a reality show of a girl who had done several (SEVERAL pageants...around a hundred or more I believe) in her childhood. She quit when she became 12 or so and is now living a very good school life. It seems that her experience in pageants has given her tough skin, confidence, and resistance to pressure.<br>  <br>  On the other hand, a girl who started doing pageants from when she was 6 until the present (she is 17) and her life is terribly...misconducted. It seems as if her life is based on entering pageants. Not the best life to lead. <br>  <br>  Congratulations. :) It's nice to show off the accomplishments of one's children at times.
aca803aafd407291581b58b9be71df4daa	This is a natural tongue thrust reflex.  It goes away on its own.  Try again in a week or so.  6 months is the average time is goes away but it takes longer in some babies and it happens sooner in some.  Just make sure the food is thin because you know how thin breastmilk is...it just takes some getting used to.<br>  <br>  Don't worry cause it is normal and good luck.  I didn't start solids until 6 months either and my son was exclusively breastfed.|`|yYZTfwT8aa	All babies squash the food in their mouth at first & it goo's back out while they taste it in their own messy little way.  If you are putting the entire bowl of the baby spoon in her mouth its not the food gagging her, its you.<br>  She might not be able to handle the particular type of cereal you are feeding her.  Barley is sometimes too strong for first feedings.  Just give her baby rice mixed with breast milk so that it is very watery.  then let her num it off the spoon's end.  She will drool it back out.  Using gripe water is an easy way to start solids but not during a stomach ache.  Try some stage one foods or cereals in a feeder bottle.|`|B9KwqnuDaa	It means shes not ready to eat solids yet. Wait a couple weeks and try again.<br>  <br>  Thumbs down?? Wtf go research it your self and you will read if a baby still has a toung thrust reflex then you should wait until this has passed.|`|gHR4vlcDaa	start very soupy so she can pretty much slurp it ... only start with one product usually rice (DONT do it thick at all- she will never poop) They need to learn to eat and chew and swallow textured things..... try holding the spoon in her mouth for a few a few seconds after each bite hold it up against the top of her mouth and top gums and let her  jaw clamp on it a bit, this will help her to keep it in her mouth and down her throat, and part of the drool out may be the new taste, they are only usto the booby milk and other things are a shocker to their little taste buds! make sure to try only one new food every 3-5days when you start and they say to try them at least 8 times even if they appear to not like them just bc they are not usto the tastes of anything, it does not necessarly mean she is not ready for solids, they say a baby is ready for solids when they look at your food when you are eating, and they sometimes make a like gum chewing motion sometimes or a mouth smacking sound...even so thin cearal is not going to hurt .... DO not give it to her in a bottle it is one of the first things a doc says about solid feeding, it is not a good idea...... and not necessary solids are meant to be eatin with a spoon, finger foods... I would just wait instead of put it in a bottle!<br>  No on said shove the spoon down her throat, just hold it in her mouth a bit, it help and works but okay do what you want, and she doesnt need gripe water,lol first moms ask for advice than dont want to take it, how ever you will learn for next time|`|0qP8gLpyaa	Her gag and tongue thrust reflex is not gone yet. Until it is she shouldn't be eating solid food because she can choke.|`|IGcS9K62aa	Try making the cereal decently thin--add A LOT of liquid to it.. Give her really small bites. I like to scrap it on the upper palate so they have to use their tongue to move it. Just be persistent and keep trying. Just learning to eat off a spoon is the hard part. <br>  <br>  Worst comes to worst, give her a little bit in a bottle-- cut a slit in the top. Do it for a day or two just so she can get used to the taste. Then try it with a spoon again a few days later. It's not ideal. But if you can't get her to eat it another way, it may be an option.
vygYFdsSaa	Don't be nervous!! Everything ends up ok in the end :) The first morning pee is more accurate because the hcg is more concentrated again. However, this is only an issue if you've been drinking a lot of fluids or you're very early in pregnancy (like before or the first day of your missed period). I'd take a test now since you're so antsy. If it comes up negative, you should take another one first thing in the morning so you have peace of mind either way.<br>  <br>  Good luck!|`|t0lo9DzVaa	You can take it whenever you want. They recommend that your morning pee is always better to read accurate results. If you think you're very early in pregnancy you could wait until the morning since your hormone levels may not for sure be showing yet, but I dont think it usually matters.I was one day late for my period and took mine at night and i was pregnant|`|pR4nLjyRaa	If your period is already late you can take it any time of day.<br>  If you're testing before your period test in the morning.<br>  Morning urine contains the highest amount of hCG since its concentrated. If you choose to test in the afternoon make sure you haven't drank alot of water in the last few hours, it can dilute your urine and cause a false negative. Good luck!|`|W4J7Ary0aa	Do it in the morning I did one at night and it was neg then again in the morning and it said positive. The first morning urine has the most concentrated amount of hGC and through out the day you pee it out. Do it in the morning. GL|`|vNgDz5Jnaa	It's best to take the test in the morning because that's when it's the most concentrated. It will contain enough hCG hormones, if you have waited long enough.<br>  <br>  Good luck!|`|4VIjILk1aa	Some tests prefer that you wait in tell your First pee when you wake up in the morning. Read the directions on the box and it will say if you can do it now or wait in tell morning.|`|G766dQjtaa	the morning pee is best.|`|9d99924ae7cd2add40a289bc1930a1b4aa	take it in the morning,,,|`|AA11997484	You should wait until the day you period is due or after that day and it is best to do it in the morning when the HCG levels are at their highest. Good luck and all the best.|`|xvCvd5xhaa	Technically, you're supposed to take it when you miss the first day of your period, so if you have already, then don't wait till the morning, do it now. If you read the box on the test it'll tell ya the same thing. Good luck.|`|WWcaKZ7Qaa	It depends how late for your period you are. If you have more than one test, go ahead and take one now. If not, wait until the morning, you will get a more accurate result, especially if it's really early, either before you missed your period or only a few days after.|`|Ltb8K9YUaa	Well if you period is late take it now.  If you are taking it before a missed period take it in the morning.  My test were positive not using first morning urine and I took it one day before my missed period.  Do you have symptoms?  I felt cramps like AF for days with no AF.  That's why I took the test.|`|1jwbQaZTaa	they say to take it in the morning, thats when your pee is most concentrated and more likely to show positive if your pregnant. but i mean if the pregnancy hormone is there, its there all the time. <br>  <br>  just to be sure though, wait till morning.|`|a6e7SRYzaa	It's more accurate in the morning, but if you really want to know take one now and if it says negative take another one in the morning. Oh and use a condom next time.|`|jn34aSgHaa	in the morning its the best time because the hormones are more consentrated. good luck

E2UXN7J1aa	I've been pretty congested my whole pregnancy. I read in some book that it is normal, because the membranes in your nasal area are softening for whatever reason. It hasn't been anything too bad though. If it gets out of hand you may have gotten a virus and should talk to the doctor. Good luck. :)|`|xvCvd5xhaa	Yea, especially if it's your first one. I had five girls and during all of them I had major allergy problems, then when the babies were born, I was fine. It's not uncommon at all.|`|WWcaKZ7Qaa	No, but it may not be a cold. Pregnancy causes a lot of inflammation in the sinuses making you feel stuffy and have more sinus drainage than normal. It also seems to aggravate a lot of women's allergies. I thought I had a cold for the first 4 months or so, but it just turned out to be sinus problems.|`|3oJL2Go3aa	I dont know if its normal. But I had major problems with my allergies when I was pregnant with my daughter. She is my first child. I have allergy problems even before I was pregnant. So I guess Im used to it. But my doctor didnt seemed concern he told me to go and get some of that zycam nasal spray and to take benedryl before I go to bed and see if that helped. Well that zycam stuff kicks ***. It really works. I took it whenever I was having my allergy issues and it relieved me quite a bit. Benedryl works too. But I swear I have grown ammune to it. It doesnt really work all that much for me anymore. But I have also heard that those nasal swabs by zycam work too. I do know that my daughter is going to be going through the same thing when she has her babies. She has allergies real bad and she is only a year old. Between me and her someone is always sneezing for some reason. LOL. Good Luck!!|`|jn34aSgHaa	maybe its how your body reacts to the hormones but you should be taking your prenatals and make sure u eat right good luck|`|RvSHQtrXaa	Depending on the type of cold and how it is caught.|`|BHnAwYywaa	Not really, unless you're in an environment where its unavoidable - ie. if you live in a cold climate, or if you work in a day care centre/kindergarten where its almost impossible to get rid of a cold because each week a different child is sick.<br>  <br>  I have a terrible cold right now, and my GP told me that women who are pregnant will have a cold/the flu for longer than usual as our immune systems aren't working as well.<br>  <br>  If it keeps up I'd see your doctor incase its something more serious than just a simple cold.<br>  Good luck|`|MyIy9M9Iaa	Noops that not normal at all. You should talk to your doctor

ULo8Cwdfaa	It's probably gonna be a bad thing later on in life when you're in a serious relationship, my boyfriend is too and he doesn't know or think he's doing it, so he doesn't realize. then girls start liking him that he doesn't like and yeah. It'll be fine, just try not to flirt to much or something.|`|ZQ0dRFoTaa	Nothing.<br>  I am a natral flirt, but I don't care.<br>  Just tell Noah you like him, tell him even thugh you flirt with other guys it is him who you truely like.|`|RvSHQtrXaa	I do not know why people are not nervous or fret when they speak about flirt.  Flirt is a kind of promiscuity, sex all around.<br>  <br>  HIV / AIDS love these people, and soon they become infected.<br>  <br>  Please, the flirters and those considering it to be a past time word, it can send you to your grave quite early.  Sometimes emotions over rides and no condom is worn.  Be careful flirters.|`|mfBkH3qtaa	I have no idea. I am a natural flirt too. I try and stay friends with EVERYONE whether they be guys or girls. I am tired of people not liking me so i try to be nice. And I guess by me trying to be nice I flirt. But maybe just tone it down a bit with guys. Don't laugh or giggle or whatever as much as you would with girls. Because I'm sure most people think you are straight. And if you aren't no offense.
eDfh1yhYaa	yes you can a combination of hormones and is apparently lubrication for the birth canal to help the baby slip through better... it gets more frequent the more pregnant you become.|`|AtVRWrwCaa	you actually have more discharge when you are pregnant. its because of the hormones
Ltb8K9YUaa	I got a false positive before so don't let anyone tell you it's not possible, but it was never right away.  It was usually after 5 minutes.  I never got a false positive with first response.  First response is the best pregnancy test.  I used to hate them because I always got a negative result.  I used first response about 16 weeks ago and it was positive right away!  So CONGRATS!!!!  You're pregnant!  Have a happy and healthy 9 months:)|`|12bc27fa7b718990cbf3a82111b05148aa	I've heard that you will never get a false positive on a pregnancy test, though you CAN get false negatives.|`|2e859d32fe514ed3486570d4ec58b1e9aa	Unlikely.|`|S4pNsW3Taa	Highly unlikely. They are 99.9% accurate|`|PkUPp4s0aa	pregnancy tests test for a hormone called hCG that is only in your body when you are pregnant. if it came out positive, its because your body has the hormone, so you are pregnant! congrats!|`|vygYFdsSaa	Sorry if this is bad news, but you're definitely pregnant. there are rarely false positives because the tests detect a specific hormone that your body only produces when you are pregnant.|`|RLi3iFXlaa	.. you're pregnant .. congratsss !|`|9d99924ae7cd2add40a289bc1930a1b4aa	congratulations, u are pregnant|`|WWcaKZ7Qaa	It would be extremely rare for you to get one false positive, let alone two. The manufacturers say that they're over 99% accurate if used correctly. Congrats!|`|aD7kHTJNaa	there is no such thing as a false positive. there are websites devoted to see what will make a preg test turn positive without being pregnant & nothing works but sperm & if u really are pregnant! Y<br>  <br>  You sound really young. how old are you? still in high schooll right? Im sorry but ur pregnant.
vygYFdsSaa	Nobody says motherhood is easy. As a teenager its even harder, but not impossible. I'm 18 and I'm very excited about my baby. I have very supportive friends and family, and my boyfriend is at my side every step of the way. My parents were shocked but not mad, and they have been amazing about the whole situation. I'm currently in my 2nd year of college (I started during high school with the dual enrollment program). It's not really a question about how "hard" its going to be as how hard are you willing to try to make it work.<br>  <br>  Oh I just wanted to say everybody I know is very proud that I'm going through with this pregnancy. It was an accident, obviously--I was on the pill but we know that's not always effective. Just wanted to throw in a disclaimer that I'm not dumb and trashy -- I got a 1500 on my SAT (out of 1600, not counting the writing section LOL) and I'm going to continue my education as a business major.|`|aD7kHTJNaa	Personally I have seens tons of teen mothers/fathers. it makes them way more mature & level headed! I have seen way more immature 28-40 yr old ppl who cannot take care of their kids nor themselves than I have horrible teen mothers. I have only seen probably 1 bad mother and she was under a ton of stress she was in a group home & had problems too (mental) so that is different. once your pregnant that maternal gene kicks in and even if you miscarry that connection & the way you felt change you forever. <br>  <br>  I do nto have kids but im 19.|`|S4pNsW3Taa	I don't think it will be hard at all why would you say that.

Some days are great and others are horrible! My family was upset, disappointed, but they got over it. I definetly found out who my true friends were, half of my friends ditched me when they found out, the rest were very supportive. I dropped out of highschool because I was constantly getting in fights and didnt want to risk hurting my baby. I tried going to highschool online but couldn't keep up with it since I was trying to be a mother and a wife, I didn't have time for school. So I'm currently studying to take my GED. <br>  <br>  I'm now 18, married and we're expecting our 2nd :)|`|a6e7SRYzaa	Well let me say this. I don't have any children, but I have known a lot of teen mothers. The only ones that did a good job were the girls that were actually smart had something going for their lives.

However I am very mature and responsible for my age, much more so than my 25-30 year old friends who all act like they are still in high school.<br>  <br>  It will be very hard to raise a baby. It's going to be hard for me, and its going to be hard for you. You won't be able to go out with your friends all the time, you'll have to put the baby's needs first. You'll be sleep deprived for the first 2 years of the child's life. Any spare money you have you won't be able to spend of yourself, it will have to go towards nappies, or doctors visits and immunisations for your baby.<br>  <br>  My family reacted reasonably well, but they still think I made the wrong decision by having this child. My friends think the same. <br>  <br>  I have a university degree. <br>  <br>  In summary, it will be very hard. And your parents and friends wont react well. Your friends might say 'yay' because they don't really know how much work a baby really is. <br>  In the end its your decision, and if you think you can give this child the life and childhood it deserves, then have the baby. But if you think that the child will suffer, then give the baby up for adoption.|`|wcWTwFFpaa	I am 23 and I have 2 children, both girls 3 and 5. I had the first when I was turning 18, It was and still is the hardest thing i have ever done in my life, I would not recommend to any young girl to get pregnant on purpose. It might seem fun showing off your baby and the attention and what not but at night it is you taking care of the baby, no one wants to stay at your house over nite because they don't want to hear your baby cry, you can't go out and do the things that you should be at that age.... I was 5 months pregnant at prom and 7 months pregnant when I graduated H.S. It sucked, after prom we went to the jersey shore and I couldn't even go on rides and I barely fit my dress. It sucked! I love my kids and would not trade them for anything in the world but if i could go back in time and make it happen later in my life i would! and as for my education... I had a scholarship to go to beauty school and couldn't because I was pregnant and couldn't handle the fumes. I never did anything with my life my life is all about my kids.|`|Ot8lxaMEaa	I got pregnant when I was a senior in high school.

I am currently a wonderful, hardworking, breastfeeding mother to a 9 month old son Lucas. I understood the challenges that would be involved and met them face-on. My family and friends were shocked (my dad was the assistant principal of my high school) but understood that it was my decision and support me, not financially, but emotionally.

My parents took the news of the baby differently than I thought and were very supportive towards our choice. We tried living out on our own but decided since the economy sucks that we would go back. My parents insisted that we lived with them so we are. we pay a same rent and I feel like my relationship especially with my mom has gotten closer.<br>  My friends were shocked just like my parents at first. We have been together for 7 years and dating for about 4. They never thought we were doing anything (wierd). <br>  We just have so much support and so many people are there for us that I feel very able to raise this baby with my fiance. <br>  Even my youth group at church and my leaders are excited for me.

It's not that hard, especially since I have my boyfriend (my current boyfriend isn't the father of either of my kids) helping out. He works, yea, but that helps for money, and when he's home he's not lazy, he helps out with the kids and cleaning. And I babysit neighbours' kids for extra money. Being a teen mom is hard, and you have less free time, but it's definitely worth it. I'm sure being a mom when you're an adult is equally as hard.<br>  <br>  <br>   My friends were all like, "Oh my God! I'm sooo taking your baby shopping!" or, "I call godmother!" <br>  My dad was in hysterics, and wanted me to get an abortion or give it up, but I refused, and my mom supported me through the first pregnancy. Since in Canada, you can legally move out at 16, I did, once I got the money (some of it from my parents, not much though). Then, I got pregnant again, and my dad didn't care that time (since I moved out), and my mom came to my house every once in awhile.<br>  <br>   I started online college classes (studying to be a teacher) in March, but in March I also started going to actual classes. So, I go to online classes, and real classes. Depends on baby/petsitting arrangements.|`|uofIL0flaa	Raising a child is hard at any age, even more so when you are young.

7rCeCVl2aa	Hours? That is WAY too much. I find it hard to believe as a mother you could let your baby cry for hours. 30 minutes tops. Then comfort and start the process again. If your baby is crying for hours at a time then your baby's needs are not met and you need to give them something.|`|IGcS9K62aa	My DR said up to 20 minutes of fussing is okay. So I probably wouldn't let her go much past that. I'd let her scream for 20 min, pick her up calm her and put her back down. And repeat that as necessary. She needs to learn to soothe herself. . . Make sure you're putting her down sleepy but not asleep. That'll help her get better at it!<br>  <br>  Whatever you do though.. don't start anything you'll have to break again. Like co-sleeping if you don't plan on doing it. Or laying with her until she falls asleep. If you do, you'll have to battle it again!<br>  <br>  Also, getting her on a schedule will help tremendously. Do it every night. Whether it be 2 books and a change of clothes, or a bath. Anything to let her know its bedtime will be helpful.|`|fd34d7830f1987fa091fa8de50613944aa	I do not support the cry-it-out method for getting a baby to sleep, so my answer will be a bit biased. I would suggest that you tend to your baby as soon as possible. Your baby is still a baby and needs your comfort and for you to help her get to sleep. She obviously cannot get there on her own, and letting her scream and cry for hours on end can only be working against you in getting her to sleep sooner. In time, she will learn how to sleep on her own, but it seems that for now you might have to help her.|`|b9035adcbdf28a53a5a80e18a3dc49d7aa	I personally never let my 9 month old cry. When she wakes now she says a simple, "mamama" and no crying. She trust I am going to be there for her so she feels no need to cry. There is scientific evidence that shows that when a child is allowed to cry for more than ten minutes at a time that blood flow is significantly reduced to the brain. Food for thought. Try the "No Cry Sleep Solution" pick it up at your local bookstore! The book gives great insight on how daytime sleep effects nighttime sleep and how to establish great sleeping routines. Good luck!|`|qcjAg3yOaa	Personally I wouldnt wait hours... Thats gotta be stressfull for you and the baby..

I am very against the cry-it-out method.  I never let my daughter cry and she sleeps just fine through the night.  Ya I had some long nights, because I didn't sleep through my daughters crying but that's part of being a Mom.  I would always keep her in her crib and pat her back softly until she fell back asleep.  We also had a routine every night (bath, I would nurse her, and then read a book) so she knew it was time to go to sleep when I layed her in her crib.|`|rK9lDXnCaa	Have you seen a nurse or doctor about this? How long has she behaved like this? Some of the reasons for such behaviour are, <br>  1 She's still hungry,<br>  2 She has excessive wind,<br>  3 Something changed in her room, ie; her cot was moved or a favourite toy was taken out,<br>  4 You are afraid, when you put her to bed, and she senses it,<br>   Have you tried a nightlight? Asked your Mum? Got someone to give you timeout? If you pick her up every two minutes, when she carries on, she will not settle. Just make sure she's clean, fed, burped and cuddled, happy, then put to bed and leave her. Read a book. Talk to your partner. Wont take long and she'll be right. Relax.|`|aca803aafd407291581b58b9be71df4daa	I did 2 minutes in the room and 5 minutes out.  I kept it up for as long as it took.

Patience and consistancy is the key!!<br>  <br>  ETA: I started this at 10 months because my son was waking up to nurse every single hour.  I still nurse before bed to this day but he needed to learn to sleep without me picking him up because he was so irritable throughout the day.  Now he is 16 months old and I nurse once before bed and he is fine all night long.  No crying.|`|wmc7uHLIaa	I wouldn't let her cry long.  I haven't started sleep training my son.

fe6fcbf713d0ed0538de9c9304001a52aa	A baby that is getting breastmilk or formula may have no need for water.  So while they "can" get the water out of the cup they may choose not to or choose not to swallow.    You can put formula in the sippy if you want.    Sippy cups are only meant to transition from bottles to cups, they are not actually any better for teeth and jaw development that bottles, and some studies suggest sippy cups are worse for speech problems.    Now of course most moms aren't going to clean up the mess from always using an open topped cup.  But don't feel like its a big deal if you use bottles instead of a sippy cup.|`|DDIBEvUTaa	try an open cup. he probably shouldn't be drinking from a bottle much longer, and definately not milk as it will be bad for his teeth. my boy can sip from an open cup @ 5 months- when i hold it. give him milk in an open cup at meals & sippys w/water throughout the day|`|T7fVO1HFaa	He probably doesn't understand that he has to suck yet.  Try taking the stopper out, so he knows there's something in there for him.  Also, try a straw sippy.  Once they figure out that they have to suck, its much easier.  You can also try formula or br milk in his sippy now, rather than juice.|`|x8JRkRNkaa	Yes you're right. Some sippy cups are better for beginners than others, and not all babies will agree on which cup is better. You may have to try a couple different kinds until you find the one that works for him. In my children's case both of them liked the ones with the soft spout part. It's more like a bottle because it's soft, but it's shaped like a cup spout. They were made by NUB. They aren't leak proof though. Try a couple different types and chances are you'll find the kind he likes. Good luck.|`|kmQqbxpQaa	I don't know if there is a "specific" age for a sippy cup but it sounds like your son is at about the right pace.  I remember worrying about the sippy cup when my son was about that age.  It was all for nothing.  He just did it one day and that was that.  As long as you keep providing opportunities, he will do it when he is ready like all other milestones.  Same thing with giving up a bottle.  Some moms are strict about giving up the bottle at 1 yr.  But give or take a couple of month, who really cares?  When my son turned 1 we still had playtex liners so I wanted to use them up until we only used sippy cups.  It took 3 months to use them up and at 15 months we gave up the bottle and he didn't even blink.|`|wzXJOSIeaa	My son is 9 months and 1 week and we introduced him to the sippy cup at 6 months. Up until recently he would just chew on the spout. Now he actually drinks from it, but it does have to be juice. If you don't mind me asking why won't you give him juice? Gerber makes a juice now that is not high in sugar. It is your descion but either way he will get better even if it's not until he starts drinking milk.|`|QL93NydYaa	My son is 9 months and drinks really well from his sippy (started it at six months).  He does well with the take and toss sippies, I wouldn't worry about him really drinking out of a sippy until he's a year.  Even then a bottle isn't that horrible for a few months until he gets a good handle on it.
aLAmvX5Naa	Lactose-free milk is sweeter than normal milk. My 14 month old daughter and I both drink it. My husband complains its a bit too sweet for him (which I don't understand since the only milk he drinks is chocolate anyway).    A half gallon of lactose-free milk costs more than a gallon of normal milk but its worthwhile if it will help your son's stools.|`|fe6fcbf713d0ed0538de9c9304001a52aa	Lactaid tastes sweeter, a fair bit sweeter because the lactose is broken down into other sugars.    You would probably be better off going back to formula or using a next step formula that does contain lactose but has the milk proteins more broken down.  Its far more likely its the milk proteins causing the problem, and getting rid of the lactose just stops the obvious symptoms of the allergy, not the actual allergy to the milk protein which can still show up in subtle ways like skin problems and sleep problems.    http://askdrsears.com/html/0/T000100.asp...  Lactose-intolerance is over-diagnosed in babies (as it is in adults). It's easy to blame formula, and therefore lactose, for baby's fussiness. Think for a moment. If so many babies are lactose-intolerant, why would lactose be the sugar in human milk? True, human milk also contains the enzyme lactase that helps babies absorb the lactose, whereas formula does not, but milk lactase doesn't do the whole job. It does seem that nature would provide the intestines of nearly all babies with enough lactose to get through at least a year or so of milk-feeding (lactose is only present in dairy products and not other foods).    The main difference in lactose-free formula is that the lactose sugar has been replaced by other sugars, usually corn syrup and sucrose (table sugar). The protein and fat blend is the same as in cow's milk-based formulas. The biochemist who dreams up the formula believes that sugar is sugar, and substituting corn syrup and sucrose for lactose is no big deal. Lactose is eventually broken down into glucose, as are corn syrup and sucrose, so it shouldn't matter. Actually, the intestines break the lactose down into two sugars  galactose and glucose. Both of these sugars are absorbed into the bloodstream. No one really knows what galactose does or why it's beneficial, just as no one knows the whole story about how the body reacts to sugars from corn syrup and sucrose. So, we're back to the non-science of common sense. If the human baby (like all mammals) didn't do better with galactose, it wouldn't be there in the first place. The milk sugar would have been pure glucose. Like so many other nutrients in formula, there is one big WE DON'T KNOW about lactose-free formulas.    We also know that lactose does more than just supply energy. The lactose that doesn't get digested in the upper intestine contributes to what is called the friendly ecology of the gut. Lactose helps healthful bacteria thrive. Lactose- free formulas not only deprive baby of lactose, they also deprive those trillions of friendly bugs that live in the intestines and do good things for the body. Lactose also facilitates calcium absorption in the gut, so that babies on lactose-free formulas may run the risk of not getting enough calcium.|`|5cd52d24c5f7667ec458aba89c056f19aa	My toddler is lactose intolerant and drinks only lactaid milk.  She was on cows milk for a few months and the switch to lactaid was very easy.  She acted like it was the same as regular milk and took to it right away.  Thank god for lactaid because now my baby is much happier.

SaRDq9iLaa	My daughter is 6 months old and has been doing the sleep crying thing for months now.  She usually doesn't wake up from it but if she does, I just put the paci in her mouth and she is fine.  I just assumed it was normal, so it's good to hear that other babies do that too!<br>  <br>  I read your other question a few days ago (I didn't answer it because I didn't know what to tell you besides that you should leave- but I did give it a star)  I'm glad you and Lilah are moving to a safer apartment/house away from that nut!  Good luck!|`|MeYILJeSaa	Oh yeah, my son does this a lot. He even pushes his bottom lip out like he always does when he's about to cry. He hasn't woken himself up yet though. If I see him do it, I pat his back and he calms down. What the other answerer said about the communication makes sense-maybe it's like baby sleep talking. :) I never thought about it that way I guess.<br>  <br>  He's three months but he's been doing it since he was born. :)|`|qcjAg3yOaa	Yep i remember Moses doing it.. He hasn't lately, I feel bad when he cries in his sleep though.. Wanna know what hes dreaming.<br>  I dont think its anything to worry about.<br>   <br>  last night he was laughing in his sleep it was so cuteee! LoL.. my fiance thought he was awake cause he giggled so clearly. So cute. <br>  I would think its the dreams they're having.. or gas? LoL.|`|u94HOVz7aa	daughter #2 whimpered/cried all night long from day one till about 18 months.  they checked her for stuff, but she was healthy in everyway.  she was sound asleep, just whimpering/crying all night.  it varied nightly some nights it was just a low whimper others it was screaming.  i would go in pick her up thinking something was wrong and she would look at me like why did you wake me then cry cause she was tired and wanted to go back to sleep.  never did figure out why i just know that when i would wake her it got worse so we just let her sleep.  it was darn near impossible to stay anywere but at home because she would keep the whole house up anywhere else.  now she is 4.5yrs and sleeps through the night just fine.|`|g9vw4ovGaa	My 16 month old daughter does it all the time, I think its just a kinda awake kinda not, not sure what to do kinda moment.|`|ME62Mtv4aa	My girl 2.5 yrs old has flat out fits in her sleep, like screams and says nooooo noooo it freaks me out like what could she possibly be thinking of to make her scream and say that. She is totally loved and adored and no arguments or anything happen in the house we don't even let her in the same room if we're watching the Simpsons because it may seems to scary for her at times lol so Idk what causes it. But it's weird.|`|eI1AzFcLaa	your baby may just feel out of her surroundings. babies are sensitive to stuff like that.<br>  <br>  my son is 3 now, and occasionally he would do the same. he has always slept in his own crib, then eventually his own bed. if the crying is loud enough and lasts long, i'll wake up and see what is wrong. other than that, i'd never worry about it.<br>  <br>  now that he can talk, after the episode has happened, he'll tell me that a spider was trying to get him or something creepy like that. so i'm sure it's normal.|`|aJLx0nhNaa	My son will occasionally "sleep cry."  I've sat and watched him do it.  I'm not sure what it is either.  But since they communicate so much through crying, I sort of assume it's a kind of baby "sleep talking."<br>  <br>  Edited: He's 8 months.  But he's been doing it for a few months now, just every now and then.|`|7rCeCVl2aa	My 9 month old does this sometimes. I think he is dreaming. I wonder what they dream about don't you? <br>  <br>  I've woke up several times because of this. I made the mistake of picking him up once and that was a big no-no. He woke up and started wailing. Now I just sneak in and see what he is doing. If he is sleep crying I let him be.
2HETgiwgaa	The nausea I had during pregnancy was exactly the same - but it depends what other symptoms you are having.  Are you wondering if you are pregnant?    Additional: Headaches can be symptoms and early on you can get cramping (like your period is due).  I didn't get nausea until few weeks along - and the cramping was never bad.  But, everyone is different.  I'd wait til you're late and take a test - Good luck :-)|`|Ki6jlwnbaa	havent you seen the movies where the girls go to the dr because they think theyve got the flu or something then they find out theyre pregnant!! lol|`|mc6YtaRbaa	I think it depends on you.

fe6fcbf713d0ed0538de9c9304001a52aa	Wow a doctor that knows something about breastfeeding, yes breastfeeding will increase weight gain more than solids particularly under 6 months.    There are three schools of thought on which foods to start with in a breastfed baby:  1) It doesn't matter what order you introduce foods (this one is the best proven)  2) Start with low iron foods until the baby is taking solids regularly to prevent them from interfering with the absorption of iron from breastmilk.  THEN start high iron and high protein foods  3) Start with high iron, zinc, and protein foods but do not use grains until at least 9 months.  Good foods are meat, leafy greens, beans/legumes, and vitamin C rich foods to help iron digestion    Protein is the most important thing for weight gain, in general.  Not fat.  However you should consult a lactation consultant to confirm breastfeeding is going well AND you should be screened for anemia, low thyroid, diabetes, and PCOS which can not only reduce breastmilk supply but negatively impact your quality of life.    ==============    Grains, even fortified infant cereal, have been shown to be protein and zinc deficient and particularly for breastfed babies slow growth.  Formula fed babies *may* need grains because formula does not contain fiber and most infant cereals have added fibers like inulin and oligofructose (also sometimes called prebiotics).  Formula is also arguably too high in protein so formula fed babies may benefit by a reduction in the overall amount of protein they get and the stress it places on the kidneys.    All babies lack the enzymes needed to digest grains until 9 months and they are at low levels until about the time the second molars erupt.    http://www.llli.org/llleaderweb/LV/LVDec...  Meat provides additional protein, zinc, B-vitamins, and other nutrients which may be in short supply when the decrease in breast milk occurs. A recent study from Sweden suggests that when infants are given substantial amounts of cereal, it may lead to low concentrations of zinc and reduced calcium absorption (Persson 1998). Dr. Nancy Krebs has shared preliminary results from a large infant growth study suggesting that breastfed infants who received pureed or strained meat as a primary weaning food beginning at four to five months, grow at a slightly faster rate. Dr. Krebs' premise is that inadequate protein or zinc from complementary foods may limit the growth of some breastfed infants during the weaning period. Both protein and zinc levels were consistently higher in the diets of the infants who received meat (Krebs 1998). Thus the custom of providing large amounts of cereal products and excluding meat products before seven months of age may not meet the nutritional needs of all breastfed infants.  Meat has also been recommended as an excellent source of iron in infancy. Heme iron (the form of iron found in meat) is better absorbed than iron from plant sources. In addition, the protein in meat helps the baby more easily absorb the iron from other foods. Two recent studies (Makrides 1998; Engelmann 1998) have examined iron status in breastfed infants who received meat earlier in the weaning period. These studies indicate that while there is not a measurable change in breastfed babies' iron stores when they receive an increased amount of meat (or iron), the levels of hemoglobin circulating in the blood stream do increase when babies receive meat as one of their first foods.      http://www.westonaprice.org/children/nou...  Finally, respect the tiny, still-developing digestive system of your infant. Babies have limited enzyme production, which is necessary for the digestion of foods. In fact, it takes up to 28 months, just around the time when molar teeth are fully developed, for the big-gun carbohydrate enzymes (namely amylase) to fully kick into gear. Foods like cereals, grains and breads are very challenging for little ones to digest. Thus, these foods should be some of the last to be introduced. (One carbohydrate enzyme a baby's small intestine does produce is lactase, for the digestion of lactose in milk.1)    [...]    Babies do produce functional enzymes (pepsin and proteolytic enzymes) and digestive juices (hydrochloric acid in the stomach) that work on proteins and fats.12 This makes perfect sense since the milk from a healthy mother has 50-60 percent of its energy as fat, which is critical for growth, energy and development.13 In addition, the cholesterol in human milk supplies an infant with close to six times the amount most adults consume from food.13 In some cultures, a new mother is encouraged to eat six to ten eggs a day and almost ten ounces of chicken and pork for at least a month after birth. This fat-rich diet ensures her breast milk will contain adequate healthy fats.14  Thus, a baby's earliest solid foods should be mostly animal foods since his digestive system, although immature, is better equipped to supply enzymes for digestion of fats and proteins rather than carbohydrates.1 This explains why current research is pointing to meat (including nutrient-dense organ meat) as being a nourishing early weaning food.    http://www.informaworld.com/smpp/content...  The results indicate that in a group of healthy, well growing 12-month-old Swedish infants one-quarter is iron-depleted, although iron deficiency anaemia is rare, and one-third may be zinc-depleted. The high cereal intake of Swedish infants from 6 months of age may have limited the bioavailability of both iron and zinc from the diet.    http://www.jpgn.org/pt/re/jpgn/abstract....

I would look for stage one jar foods and some babies are just skinny!|`|TjsR0nc4aa	Bananas are definitely one of the best high-calorie foods you can feed your little one.  Sweet Potatoes are also excellent, as well as peas and peaches.    If using butter, veggie oil, or margarine do not bother you, put some of these in his vegetables.    Whatever you do, do not rely on artificial sugar.  Stay clear away from things like syrup and honey, as these items sometimes do not jive well with young children.  Good luck.|`|bHAlwhTBaa	Ask your doctor.  Babies under 9 months need to get most of their calories and nutrients from formula and breastmilk.      My baby lost weight between 5 and 6 months, and that 6 month weigh-in was devastating.  (He wasnt even on the chart!!!)  I was working full-time and pumping and did NOT want to supplement with formula.  But I had too.  Now, he is back in the 50% percentile at 9 months!!      Good Luck.
BypjotRpaa	you should always do a gradual switch to get them used to the taste. mix the 2 together. say you make a 4 oz bottle do 3oz of the old and 1 oz of the new. do this for a couple of bottles then go half and half.and so on.|`|vmb49ND8aa	Why do you want to switch?

Too bad you're having a baby with this person.  So very sad.  Your child's model for a man (either to be or to marry) is going to be a drug addict.  <br>  <br>  You can fix this.  Dump this loser.  Find a decent, drug free man and raise your child with him.  Get some therapy and figure out why you would settle for a loser like this in the first place so that you don't fall into the pattern of being attacted to yet another one.<br>  <br>  And if it's not weed, then you're REALLY in trouble, because that was the least innocuous drug abuse I could think of.|`|PkC1Sk8Qaa	Sounds like a combination of his problems with drugs, matched with the daily stresses of life PLUS knowing he's going to be a father. All of that is making him angry, depressed and worst of all vent it out on you.<br>  <br>  You can support him and be there for him but you need to let him know that you aren't going to be his punching bag. If he continues to act this way and stress you out whilst your trying to have a baby which is also his, then you have to break up. You need to be in a stress free environment to give birth and your baby needs to be raised in a happy home. If living with this man doesn't meet that criteria then either he or you have to leave.<br>  <br>  Just talk to him about everything and give him a chance to change, if things don't you know what to do. It's better for the child and you that way.|`|waVPtmAEaa	It's probley due to stress <br>  his remarks "i cant stand being around you" could be an insecure way of saying "im not ready for fatherhood and raising a child" and his way to get out of that is too not be with you, which i hope for you and the childs sake isnt true!

He is there for me but not always it seems. We see things differently and I would say that our personalities clash a bit, but we love each other. <br>  Since he is soooooo young in his words he thinks that his fun should not stop just becasue we are going to be parents. i am going to school at Front Range Community College and working while he works 2-11 Mon-Fri and NOT going to school.

It seems like the pressure is getting to the guys LOL<br>  I hope it passes for the both of us. GL
PTdy6TWRaa	It's tough to be in the position of looking after a child with behavior problems or from a home with overly permissive or just very different style of parenting than you're used to. But as the sitter it's not really your place to parent the child or teach the parents how to do it either. You may have the right ideas on what to do but you're not there enough or in the sort of role where it's good for you or the child to assume that role.<br>  <br>  All you can do is either accept the fact that this is a difficult family to sit for, and try to not let it get to you, or find another family to spend time with. Frankly I might choose the latter since there surely are families and kids out there that would appreciate you for who you are and how you look after the kids.<br>  <br>  You can't change the families and kids to fit you, but you might find one that fits you better. Good luck.|`|f55619778e2c4f36156e3d1508aa6431aa	Don't babysit him anymore and I'll be willing to bet that plenty of babysitters have called it quits with this kid in the past.   But his mom won't be telling you about that.   Don't feel bad.   It's not your fault that he is the way he is.   The suggestions are a good idea too but I don't think she'll do anything different.|`|15jfF0tKaa	Honey you did just great! And I'd hire you in a heart beat. Don't email the mom though. If she asks you again then tell her frankly he has emotional problems and it will be double fee up front. Then ask her to get him a therapist for his severe issues.|`|3Se5nlJtaa	Don't feel bad. I totally understand where you are coming from. I use to watch a boy that was 7 years old and had a 3 years old brother. I remember going to their house in the morning and they would make their mother do everything for them. During the course of the semester the mother and I got close enough to be able to talk about the problems and issues and we got it worked out and towards the end of watching them (we both moved out of town) I actually cried. I do agree though that you did the right thing by telling the dad the truth and if your close enough to the mom I would shoot her an email and let her know what you watched and observed and what you suggest! I don't see any problems with that. If my son behaved as this child (which I know he would not) I would hope they would call me and let me know. Good luck! Trying to figure out what is right is sometimes hard to do!|`|Ff7mCzlPaa	this child has some deep seated emotional problems.  it really sounds like he's a sociopath.<br>  <br>  it's not your fault, and his parents need to get him some help, before he kills one of the pets or harms someone else (or even himself).<br>  <br>  giving the parents advice isn't going to do much in all liklihood, but if you do, recommend a psychiatrist.  that kid is way overdue.|`|eI1AzFcLaa	if that kid is that bad, there is nothing you can tell the mother that is going to change a thing, don't even waste your time. she knows how bad her child is and obviously isn't going to do a thing about it.<br>  <br>  the best thing for you to do, is get over it. help yourself get over it by reminding yourself that you never have to go over there again. if you blow them off next time they ask you to babysit, or just never go around again, the mother will get the point.<br>  <br>  people like that should be ashamed of the animalistic ways of their children. how dare that mother even ask someone to babysit. if that kid can't go everywhere with her, then she has no business going anywhere without him. <br>  <br>  sorry you had to go through such a horrific thing.
7rcZfi78aa	I would give it a couple more days and test again, but it sounds like you could very well be pregnant. I don't think giving blood would have affected your test at all though.|`|2HETgiwgaa	It's probably light because it's so early, even the faintest test line is +ve and false +ves are rare - so I say CONGRATULATIONS :-) - but, for your own peace of mind - yes wait a few days and test again|`|4DoXomHZaa	You should wait till the day after a missed period.    NO donating blood would not make you test + or - or make lines lighter or darker. ONly the pregnancy hormone hcG does that.    If you're TTC, you do deny yourself things. You have to. If you are not willing to do everything possible, you may need to reevaluate. I've been TTC for 24 months now. believe me, I'm "sick of it" too....but I keep going because that's how important a baby is to me.|`|Q0DLGuGwaa	a positive is a positive no matter how faint, giving blood doesnt change this, however from now on no more giving blood haha congrats take a test in a couple of days again, and your right ttc shouldnt take over your life i didnt let it take over mine im 12 weeks 6 days pregnant good luckxx|`|ZbnxGIsnaa	If there is a pale line then you are probably pregnant dear!!!!  Awwww!!!  Take another test in a few days and see if it darkens.  I bet you are pregnant.   Congratulations in advance!!!  =)|`|scdOdaTKaa	Giving blood wouldn't affect it at all, the fact that it wasn't your first morning urine is the biggest factor. but a line is aline congrats!  Wait a few days and take the other test with your first morning urine as that is when the hormone is strongest in your urine. Congrats!
AA11828439	No Child left behind my eye. It appears an entire generation is behind.|`|mPTBU0QDaa	I could be wrong, but I believe it is a parent's job to educate their child(ren) about sex, not the president of the United States. Yeah, schools play a role, but not one nearly as important as the role of parents. If a 13-year-old has no idea how to get pregnant, the child must not have friends, listen to the radio, watch tv, or have parents that talk to her. It's a bit ridiculous to blame something like that on the president and his administration.|`|3K7ffKn2aa	lol yep|`|Y7sio6Yhaa	i dont get wat point you're making.|`|87WOSjwgaa	I am sorry but I feel that it is PARENTS job to make sure that their child knows about sex and the things that could happen if you do choose to have sex. Putting it in the hands of the government is irresponsible!! We shouldnt rely on other people to raise OUR kids!!!!|`|e0eb82b689e1db392eb51c89982ed115aa	hahha doesn't matter what administration is involved, if your parents are not good teachers, and don't give you options you are going to experiment at any age. IF you have bad role models and not even that seems to be a reason, its just girls with high sex drives and stupid brains, low self esteem, and no idea of the reponsiblities of babies and parenthood. These are the combinations that cause this problem. 13 wasnt considered that young a century ago.|`|AA10280194	Is this some kind of rant?|`|AA11783622	I'm afraid so.      The man put a world gag order all over the planet in countries where the US gave foreign aid.      I was in Tibet when the government was trying out a planned family program.  Bush yanked all foreign aid to Tibet.     It was about impossible to teach a class in health in sex ed... about all that we could say was, "don't do it!!"  yeah, that worked.  The babies born the last 8 years..... 30% of  white ones  are with single moms and 62% of black ones are, and you can blame that on Bush  and his fundamentalism shoved down kid's throats... yet is is likely he got a girl an abortion when he impregnated her in his college years.|`|9zMC6EBtaa	I totally agree with mommy- to-be, that while it is important for schools to teach at least some form of sex education, the bigger burden rests on the child's parents. Parents are so worried about being embarrassed by talking to their kids about sex, they skip the subject all together in most cases. I am not a parent, well not yet at least, but I do have one on the way, so I don't mean to judge it just seems like we are not educating our kids about the facts of life anymore. Stop worrying about your own comfort level or even your child's because this is something they need to know about. If they don't know how pregnancy happens, there is no chance they are going to know how to prevent it. So the next time we are so quick to point the figure at the school system, maybe we should look closer to the family.|`|kv8ZFPP1aa	i honestly don't think it's Bush's fault [[even though i don't like him]] because where i live they teach sex ed all through school, from grade school until high school. it's the parents and the teens that's at fault for getting pregnant so young because they are the stupid ones who don't watch their kids and keep their legs closed.|`|smeaC4SHaa	I don't think so and I don't think anyone could stop it. Being curious is part of the human nature, if a kid is curious about something,There is no doubt that he/she will learn about it. It's inevitable.     "If you can't defeat them, join them." What Bush Administration should have done is add Sexual education in every high school classes across the US so even if the kids would found out about sex and all that, they would learn it the right way.
rhPCJfeuaa	My daughter had just turned 3 when I had my son.  They are as different as night and day in many ways.  So experience didn't quite come into play, other than being more comfortable with my abilities to care for an infant.  His babyhood when by a lot quicker than my daughter's because I had two to care for, so I didn't get to revel as much in his 10 fingers and toes as I did with her.  There are times that I get overwhelmed and tired, and I sometimes feel like I don't get to be alone with my husband as much as I would like.  But, the pros totally outweigh the cons.  Others love to watch my two play together, because they are each others best friend.  They fight at home like normal siblings, but they hug and kiss all the time and just truly love each other.  last night, my son fell and hit his head on the floor. I got out the ice pack, but my 5 1/2 yr old daughter held my 2 yr old in her arms and applied the ice to his head.  they sat together on the couch watching TV with his head on her shoulder.  It was priceless and I had tears in my eyes.  May they always be there for each other like that.  They have only one first cousin, my brother's daughter who is 6.  She takes every opportunity to come and stay with us on school breaks and in the summer.  They are like siblings, and she hates to leave to go home.  She begged for siblings, but they lost many pregnancies and it's not possible.  So I definitely think you shoul dgo for it if you feel like you want another one.  It takes time to adjust and work out the kinks to a schedule of sorts, but it comes naturally with time.  You just kind of fall into a rhythm after awhile.|`|75c40712ce4c1c9063d61b17387937f9aa	they say, one child will change your life forever. Two children will keep you on your toes, but after that they just all fall in line. i have 2 children and sometimes its hard, but only if you make it so. my daughter is almost 6 and my son is 17 months, i like the age difference, because my daughter is a HUGE help to me with my son. and..shes in school now so i have one on one time with him during the day and one on one time with her in the evenin :) they play together and she loves the idea of teaching him stuff :) i personally like having 2 kids...will like it more when i finally get to sleep in!! good luck on your decision:)|`|c658477afc923f7076f09dfdcf3a37c3aa	We have four sons. We had 2 sons , then 8 years later we came into some money, so we went to fertility clinincs to conceive 2 more. (so see the spacing there)<br>  <br>   The first son was like a little adult. He was so mature and compliant. He had just turned 3 when his baby brother was born.<br>  The 2 of them were perfect together. It was "his" baby, zero sibling rivalry.<br>  When they were 8 and 11, 3rd baby came home. They worshipped him and still do.<br>  When 3rd baby turned 3, 4th baby came home. Again, no sibling rivalry at all, zip.<br>  I think it depends on parenting.<br>  We co-sleep, wean when baby leads, homeschool, and are very praising and uplifting. We never refer to babies or children as burdens and we've noticed that many other parents say things like that right in front of their kids more than they realize. You pour love into them and they'll be loving people.<br>  I will tell you one thing I learned. It was harder with one child. he had to be entertained. With 2 or more, they play together and if trained well, the conflicts that are often seen in siblings, they can work out themselves. I've heard mine many times, as young as 4, saying to a younger brother, "you have to share, sweetheart." Now THAT is beautiful.<br>  Now 2 of our sons are teens. Never had any "terrible twos" and never had any "teen angst". I think teen years would be my favorite.<br>  It's in the parenting.<br>  I've seen moms with 8 well-behaved, happy and generous kids many times. I've seen moms of triplets (all in diapers, CLOTH diapers)  who are joyously raising their babies. <br>  I've seen moms with 1 or 2 who are totally frazzled. <br>  You understand.|`|tqA9kxeqaa	i have a daughter 14<br>  son 9<br>  daughter 3<br>  son 10 months<br>  <br>  it never gets easier, the only advice I would give you is wait a little while longer, because once that baby comes, there will be many "hold on a minute hon, mommy is busy" moments.<br>  <br>  your little girl should have all your attention for a little while longer, i think<br>  spoil her, love her -im not saying you already don't but she needs your undivided attention.<br>  <br>  i say this to you because there are still moments where of course my older ones have to wait, and even though my 9 yr old understands, I dont think my 3 yr old does all the time.<br>  she says to me, "but mommy I want you" then my heart breaks cause i'm tending to her baby brother|`|sXpGfHWWaa	I have four children all under the age of 5. ( Check my profile)<br>  <br>  Cons:<br>  You know have two children to deal with<br>  Twice the food<br>  Twice the time<br>  Twice the money <br>  It is very exhausting<br>  <br>  Pros: <br>  You have two best friends that will ALWAYS be there no matter what<br>  Twice the laughs<br>  Twice the fun<br>  You just have so much playing with them<br>  Twice the memories. <br>  <br>  I would recommend you do, just in this economy make sure you have the money.|`|OlCt6ZCQaa	I had my second child when my daughter was 7 and it has been wonderful. Until they get older everything I have heard about having kids close together has been terrible. I would take my daughter to the park to hang out with other kids and wait a year or two. You have not even got to spend enough time with your daughter alone yet. WAIT!|`|ehBPus3Zaa	My children are 8 years apart. It was definitely easier  for having the second child because I wasn't scared of the unknown. Plus I didn't have a chance to have one in between the two because I wasn't married.  I would at least get the first one out of diapers before having another one. My sister had two in diapers at the same time (they were 15 months apart) It like to drove her crazy!  A good space between them I think is about 3 years. When they get older they will be closer because they are not so jealous of each other. Not that my nieces weren't close when they got older, but they were very competitive towards each other.|`|SnQvsOPwaa	Yes, been there done that kinda thing.|`|AA12221392	I have 4 kids- 17(almost 18) ,16,13,9<br>  <br>  While taking care of mutiple kids, is hard work, I think it is easier for more than one. Example when they are older they have a playmate, which lets them have someone else to play with , which gives you alittle more mommy time to clean, and so forth. they also have someone else to learn from that you are raising in the same enviroment. <br>  <br>  you do have to share your time, it is more money, and does have it's stressful moments but really, to have only one, your child will grow up with you as thier playmate, or you having a bunch of other kids around all the time, usually one child is spoiled, because they have it all. <br>  <br>  I don't know if I was helpful, as somethings of why having more is easier and so much better I can't put into words .|`|b1WMcGQ0aa	Yes... It is easier, in my opinion.. It's not as much of a new introduction to life. You have done it before, you can do it again, and it all seems more familiar. Plus, the kids just LOVE each other! <br>  <br>  I waited longer... My first son was 4 and half when I gave birth to my second baby. That wasn't by choice because I have had two consecutive miscarriages within the past two years, one involving identical twin boys.. However, things have worked out perfectly, and my 5 year old LOVES his little brother, and I think the age gap is not TOO great, but just enough to give a little financial relief of the huge expenses.<br>  <br>  Anyway, I love my babies. And, I was surprised of the differences between giving birth the first time to my son and then the second time to my next son. I highly recommend it whenever YOU are ready! Having babies is fun!!|`|prqrQcd1aa	Do you mean in terms of labor, or just raising the child?<br>  In terms of labor i can't really tell you, as i've had 3 c sections. Each one was easier though, that I CAN tell you.<br>  In terms of raising them, yes it seems to be a bit easier as well, but it isn't always that way because all kids are different. You could get blessed with 2 kids that are happy babies and then the 3rd one is colicky and cries all the time.. things like that.|`|3ULL37Koaa	I think you should. The 18 month old will have a sibling to play with (which I never got D=) and like someone else said, you get twice the love, twice the laughs, twice the fun. But the cons is it costs twice as much, and you have 2 to deal with.
AA11920812	I have PCOS and my husband has low sperm count.    Which OPK are you using? Not all are created equal. I had a huge problem with the bulk ones I was buying off ebay. They were always positive, my doc gave me some to try that never came back positive.     We ended up at a reproductive endocronologist to help us. We found out I had been pregnant and had a miscarriage and my body hadn`t expelled the baby on its own. Causing me to not be able to get pregnant again...    We had our first son through IUI and sperm washing. We had great results with Gonal F and pergonayl and ovudrill.     With our last two we just use the Zetek OvaCue monitor. Crazy because we tried for two years to conceive our first (a year with the r.e.). And, concieved our now 19 month old in just one cycle. I just found out I am pregnant again and used it for two cycles.     So, it is possible!!    *Baby Dust*    --- Just realized you said you were using Clomid and OPKs. Once that didn`t work for me I was monitored with an ultrasound during ovulation. Ovulation was determined via blood testing from the beginning of my cycle all the trough until the next one started.|`|L9khUU1caa	i dont know, but please let me know if it works. been trying now for 4 years and nothing. considered treatment but i dont know anyone who has had it and unsure if it will help us and what is the best treatment to get. i am in the same situation as you and my fiance same as ur husband|`|T7fVO1HFaa	consider IUI, it'll increase your odds.  Plus, the Dr can wash his sperm so the best ones are directly inserted.|`|D35xKICoaa	Please don't loose hope God is able to do the impossible keep the faith i wish you luck for ( 09)
D35xKICoaa	Very good hope it work for him Best of luck (********)|`|4DoXomHZaa	It's not going to hurt, but there are vitamins specifically for improving sperm counts. Depending on how low they are, vitamins may not help.    Check out the ingredients in Semenax. Look into l-carnitine.
NroZQN5vaa	I kind of like it. It is a little strange but it's pretty. Also, you could use a differen't language's word for April. All I can think of is that it's Avril in French. But, you could always try and have your son help you pick a different name. Maybe get it narrowed down to two or three and have him pick between those. Good luck!|`|4SKIE1C8aa	April is okay but I prefer Avril (the French version). Sweetpea is not a good idea for a legal name, I suggest sticking with that as just a family nickname (I'm an April baby and get called Sweet Pea by my parents too...even though I'm 23...)|`|i2RSpZ6caa	At first I was thinking it was really cute but then I realized it was cute for a baby and it won't be cute on a teenager or a grown woman. So I really wouldn't go there. Sweetpea could be the nickname though. April is a pretty name, especially for a girl born in April. Maybe her middle name could begin with the letter P and then the Sweet Pea would have more meaning (more like Sweet P). Just an idea...|`|YseGAHIfaa	Heres some names for you:    Nora Shae  Kendal Samantha  Olivia Jayde  Jasmine Morgan  Angelina Kai    These aren't too common..!!    Lots of luck   =)  x|`|1KJtbAPzaa	I think SweetPea is cute but for a nick name. April is a nice name as well but if you like unusual names I dont think she will be the only April out there. It's always nice to hear a name that sticks in your head when you hear it or maybe a name that means something. Maybe also try to think of names from your heritage. There are a lot of beautiful Irish names that you may be interested in that you may have never heard before. Adara, Audra...???|`|kCiizn5oaa	April is a great name!!!  I love the meaning behind the middlename and guarenteed she will too. LOVE IT!|`|XtEGXLKnaa	How about Alexa Sweetpea :)|`|LEgfiITVaa	I think it's perfect.  Both names have meaning behind them, and they sound cute together.  This is your baby, and what you name her is your business. :)     Most of her schoolmates wont know her middle name (unless she shares that info herself) so shouldnt be a problem.    If I were you I would just keep the name is secret/surprise until she is born, that way you can follow what feels right in your heart (without other peoples negativity changing your mind).      I love that the names have significance behind them, not just something picked out of a book that you liked at the moment.|`|uS07WAwcaa	I dont think that sweetpea is a good name to name a child  also could you imagine a 54 year old woman like im april sweetpea  also if your naming her a month name it sounds like sweet peas from april  what about another a name  for example Adair Dulce  --- Dulce means sweet but its not litterally saying sweet|`|KWJ7ju6qaa	The one season of Project Runway had a 40-year old Sweet P on it; it was hard to take her seriously and it was only her nice name.|`|dPULl5hjaa	April - not my style    Sweetpea - why not use this as her "nickname"?  Definitely, using it as a middle name is a little strange.    Our daughter's nickname is "Sweetpea", even though she's 16 yrs old.|`|7w2kCTDJaa	Sweet Pea is a horrendous name. Really. Why would you do that to your own kid? Can't you just call her that as a nickname inside the family? I like April though. You don't hear it much.|`|UrZ8SFpqaa	Sweet pea? I wouldn't do that as a name, maybe as her nick name. It may sound sweet and everything, but can you imagine when she starts high school? All of the bullying and insults? She would hate your guts if you gave her that name.    I had a friend who had her first name hyphenated and she absolutely hated it and hated her parents. She still does to this day and she's in the process of having her name changed.|`|1OpcR7bZaa	April Sweetpea is to put it bluntly quite ****. She will without a doubt be made fun of throughout her life, don't go there! If you like unusual names type unusual girl names into google and it should come up with lots of other names that you can choose from.|`|c8e5d630616fd991d57af8eb76b7b3fbaa	Sweet pea is a cute nick name, but I wouldn't use it as a real name.  Someday kids will make fun of her for it.|`|xhVe918waa	Aw, that's really cute, but not for a name. :/    April is cute though.    April Leigh.. um Amelie Jolie [Jolie is pretty in French]..   Analeigh Laine,    just throwing out some ideas there. :p|`|YcLImmyraa	It's a sweet idea, but why not just use it as a nickname? My name is Claire Louise but I've always been called Daisy by my parents, I still get called it even now I've grown up. It's just a nickname that stuck when I was little.     A nickname doesn't have to come from her actual name. April as a first name is really pretty though! Alternatively, you could give her a first name beginning with 'P' - that way the nickname Sweetpea would fit! Penny, Poppy, Phoebe, Pearl... Good luck :)|`|djjVYhWiaa	I had a hamster called Sweet Pea and she was such an adorable little thing.  However, I think you should make that your child'ss nickname rather than her real name as she might get bullied for it in school.  If you're not sure on the name April either, reconsider.  You want a name you'll love to say.  Good luck. :)|`|48c930ebdc8dc579c849fcf4023c3659aa	It's cute, but what about when she's an adult and has to sign stuff with her middle name? It's a sweet idea but I wouldn't go with it. But whatever you like. Here's some names:  Cambrie  Halo   Calico  Cassia  Kyra   Railey  Indy/Indigo   Laken  Lilac  Lyric  Rhiannon  Teal  Samara    I hope you like these :)|`|h57t7FAjaa	Definitely a cute nn... and honestly if you think you would like it as a middle name then go for it!      Everyone is saying it'd be horrible and how could you do that to your kid... but honestly who really ever uses their middle name for anything?  She could just say April S. ...   & it would be her choice to share it with others or not!  I barely knew half my friends middle names growing up, let alone those of people I didn't know!    Btw April is a really nice fn :)|`|U1juqahIaa	April is fine, Sweet pea is horrible.  If you must use Sweet Pea, use it as her nickname, just not in front of her friends.  That would embarrass her when she's older.      April is actually not as common as it used to be.  It ranked at  310 in 2007. It was alot more popular in the 70s and 80s.  You don't have to worry about her having alot of other girls in her class with the same name as her.|`|cNySQ2axaa	sweat pea would be a good nickname but not for the actual name|`|2274dcf5eba0ee2ef3aabbe2c8b0a89daa	i think its pretty and has meaning but i would be scared she would be picked on horribly.. so why not just make that her nick name..|`|FvYqKZSMaa	Maybe sweet pea as a nickname.Not a middle name.April is a good name for  a girl.|`|CEuxMzaXaa	Sweat pea is a nice nick name. But you're right it would make a good middle name as well. I think April sweet pea would make a nice name. After all we now live in a world where kids have names like Apple. Sweat pea is also one of my favourite flowers, and many girls are named after flowers.|`|RBmGVrlpaa	April is a beautiful name for a girl, but PLEASE DON'T give the baby a horrible name like Sweet pea. SHE WILL END UP HATING IT AND RESENTING YOU!|`|XmO3nFSLaa	Aubriana Sweetpea, Jade Sweetpea, Paisley Sweetpea, Aubrie Sweetpea, Kelsey Sweetpea, Charlotte Sweetpea, Kate Sweetpea, Isabella Sweetpea, Annabell Sweetpea, Adeline(addaline) Sweetpea, Alexa Sweetpea, Molly Sweetpea.......    That will be sweet for her middle name with a good story to go with it!!

It's that bloody amendment giving us free speech that causes trouble along with the anonymity of the internet.|`|EQJpV9S3aa	Hey you could talk about earl grey tea and attract pervs. Before I answer a odd question I will check the askers profile, often the "jokers" will show a pattern of "out there" questions, then I will answer by letting everyone know that the asker is not for real.<br>  edit- I saw the one you were talking about- pervert. No one asks questions like that except pervs.|`|5XwY9aP8aa	Oh of course it's creepy. But there are always people who post every where who like a shock factor to their posts. It doesn't matter how many times they are reported, so many people insist on returning and using the same shock value on everything.<br>  <br>  Over the internet you have to take everything with a grain of salt, because not everyone is going to be honest about everything.|`|AA12245468	most of the time most of us can tell the difference between a legit concern and a goofball messing with us.<br>  Just the same as telling, usually, the sentence structure, wording, and terminology etc in a twelve year old versus an adults question.<br>  <br>  sometimes it's fun to play along with the crazies as long as it's not too perverse or inappropriate of a question.<br>  <br>  It is equally creepy to think some of the things some of these people write could actually be happening.<br>  <br>  If it's a cornball question, I'm likely to answer with an equally stupid or exaggerated answer.<br>  the one's with legit concerns will usually post a more serious sounding question anyway.|`|qTVkydt1aa	I did notice that when answering a, uh, certain question.<br>  <br>  It's hard, because it's such a controversial issue that wants to be discussed, but sadly there are those creeps out there who get a kick out of every spanking question.|`|VuUz8NgKaa	Yes I do, that is why I don't answer them as often.<br>  <br>  I just read the one I think you are talking about, the survey one right?

I don't believe that happened at all because if it did, I seriously doubt that the women would go on a website about parenting and brag about abusing her child!  There are some pretty sick people on this forum who get their kicks by posting absurd and offensive questions, sometimes I will comment but most of the time I just move along.<br>  <br>  There are alot of people on this website who haven't learnt that there are some subjects that you just don't joke about.|`|SHQHnKfcaa	Yea theres a guy who said his friend he is trying to help has parents that make her be a whore.....Really sick, everyone said to call the police and his additional response was that he had her safe with him and that shes sleeping.....check it out in my answers.

I try not to be mean.|`|AA10943329	perverts are everywhere. I don't think it really matters what we talk about...they are always lurking
YuA7a08Maa	haha...well, when I first got pregnant, I would be SO tired at night.  I would fall asleep by 8 or 9 and then wake up wide awake at like 5:00 in the morning.  It was ridiculous.  Then, I would feel exhausted in the afternoon but couldn't sleep since I work.  Now in my second trimester, I can go to bed about 11:00, but I automatically wake up at 4:30 in the morning to pee.  My bladder alarm clock.  :)  I, like you, used to sleep all the time.  Now I'm tireder, but I sleep more lightly.  I think that happens when you're pregnant.  I think the only "normal" thing about sleeping patterns is that they change!
9tNr1RMfaa	I have been cloth diapering my 13 month old son since birth :)<br>  <br>  Cloth is the best choice for Mother Earth. Disposable diapers can take up to 500 years to decompose. They also contain all sorts of chemicals to make them more absorbant. They have been bleached and have had perfumes added to them. I don't like the idea of those chemicals being next to my baby's skin. Yuck!<br>  <br>  I will admit that, I have been using disposables during the winter months when I am "out and about." The reason? I can't fit the cloth diapers under my son's clothing ((and he has to wear LOTS of clothing lately as it has been below 30 since November)). But, it is my first ever winter as we just moved to a colder climate. Next winter I will be more prepared with hand knitted wool longies. <br>  <br>  I think it is important for all of us to try and do what we can to lessen our "carbon footprint." If you are grossed out by poop, consider a diaper service (if one is available in your area). If you can't wash diapers, try G-diapers or at least Seventh Generation unbleached diapers.<br>  <br>  ETA: Contrary to what some of you are saying, I have had so many more leaks with disposable diapers than I have ever had with cloth. I use unbleached chinese prefolds with a snappi fastener and a Bummi's cover, and I have not had a blowout with this set up (not even when my son had diarrhea). <br>  <br>  ETA: (re: scrubbing poop) You do not have to SCRUB poop if you purchase a diaper sprayer. You hardly even have to touch it if you turn the pressure up :)|`|CiFR2xuBaa	We use disposable, I just haven't come to terms with having to wash dirty diapers constantly. The cost might add up by how much energy or water I have to use constantly washing cloth diapers or soiled clothing, so we faithfully go to Sam's club and get large quantities of diapers for a good price.|`|OHq5gSjJaa	I prefer disposables.  I just really hate the idea of my baby pooping in a diaper and just washing it and having to wear it again.  It has to get all stained.  Plus disposable is more convenient.  At the same time I do really commend people who use cloth diapers because I think they are doing a great thing for the environment.|`|ro5vFj9Aaa	i prefereed the real diapers also. the paper ones are not that nice. i know that 3 of 4 children had the real ones and even the 4th baby was allergic to the paper ones it made hi butt turn beat red. so its best for me and i wasn't really affording them apaper ones then. its alot cheaper but you hvae to keep them clean and stuff which these new moms dont' do very well i can see it now dirty diapers all over and not washed out.|`|reO9Dgmsaa	I adore cloth and will never go back!  :)  We switched when Sophie was 15 months.<br>  <br>  The reasons I prefer cloth:<br>  ~Environmentally friendly<br>  ~Cheaper than disposables (THOUSANDS of dollars cheaper!)<br>  ~CUTEST things ever!  :)<br>  ~I can reuse them for each child<br>  ~Healthier for my babies' body (no nasty dioxin)<br>  ~I never run out at 2 am<br>  ~Just as easy as disposables; cloth only adds an extra 5 minutes to my routine each day :)|`|eya1WDS4aa	disposable for me lol. good for you for using cloth though. I couldnt bring myself to it...cleaning the poop and pee out of it...not for me lol. props to you though.|`|nhgQKvwEaa	Disposable. Much easier to deal with.|`|da0bd1389f2c6ba2fe645d6d1c4be705aa	disposable.|`|2451MT2Haa	My personal preference is Cloth and The Hybrid Gdiaper. Diapers are such an expense these days, and there are so many easier cloth options nowadays. I prefer the Bumgenius One size and the Gdiapers. To me they are as easy as disposables and i dont feel like im throwing away money. The environmental aspect is also a plus, but i do believe when you are with children, its about saving and convenience, which in some parents cases are why they choose disposables.|`|b9035adcbdf28a53a5a80e18a3dc49d7aa	I prefer to have the option of both... I prefer cloth and I use that as my primary go to diaper, but when I am out for the day (too the zoo etc) I like having the option of disposable as well. I know that I am making a difference just by using cloth primarily. It is nice too know that my child does not have chemicals on her bottom the majority of the time. It is nice knowing what is in your diapers. :)|`|4qqtc3dLaa	I am not a mother yet, but my mother used to tell me how she wanted to be environmentally friendly and save money when she had me. I was a cloth baby. She did disposable with my other sister's cause she said it was to much of a hassle to wash them and they arn't very good at holding in the crap. She said it was exhausting havng to take care of a baby AND find time to clean the cloth.|`|5XwY9aP8aa	Disposable.<br>  <br>  For us, we have to go to the laundry mat, we don't have any other access to a washer and dryer and there are times when we can't make it for 2 weeks. So, in reality, disposable is definitely our best bet. We can't have dirty cloth diapers hanging around until our next trip.<br>  <br>  Plus, disposable diapers have stuff in them that whisk away moister from the skin resulting in less rashes/infections for the child. (read that in some baby magazine.)|`|MzDTL8jVaa	Cloth diapers.  People who use disposibles are lazy and don't care about the planet.  Also, it's illegal to throw human feces in the trash, even if it's in a diaper.  It says that right on the package, but these people ignore that.  In 50 years, we're going to live on a giant landfill full of human crap.  It disgusts me.|`|jYPeis3Saa	disposable, because i don't want to deal with the mess of cloth diapers. <br>  and they are more convenient for my family. i also do not want to be sitting there rinsing and scrubbing poop stains out of cloth diapers all day long..<br>  <br>  if it works for you, then great!|`|0c6afe76e38ea505da9f14e4c238a25caa	i love cloth diapers! they are a bit more work but i like knowing that there's not all those chemicals in his diapers. plus it saves money and helps the planet. i had a hard time at first but i got in a routine and now its a piece of cake.|`|CIBtfxEqaa	Disposable. Might be more expensive, but for some reason, cleaning doody out of a diaper has never been a favorite pastime of mine! If you want to, more power to ya!|`|ShdV8jm4aa	I prefer the disposable. Just because I'm a little squeamish around poo and the thought of washing the cloth every time makes me cringe. Cloth are cheaper, but I'm definitely a Huggies mom!|`|pXSKSS3daa	Disposable.<br>  <br>  I guess because I'm lazy, when it comes down to it. Oh well, I'll be a better mommy elsewhere(lol, not a jab at you).|`|ggETPqedaa	Disposable, I don't get to wash laundry for maybe a week or two weeks. I don't have a washer and dryer, so it would be better for all of us in the house to do disposable diapers. It wouldn't be cleanly for us to use cloth because we can't wash them regularly.|`|oXIYHsDaaa	I prefer disposables, I've used cloth before with my first when I had too, but I like disposables better, for one my daughter has slept through the night since she was 6 weeks old and she wakes up in the morning with a really wet disposable, if she was in cloth she would wake up because she was wet, and since she doesn't really nap during the day I think that would just make her a grumpy baby. <br>  <br>  I've also found it's a hard if you have a front load washer the cloth diapers don't seem to get as clean, when I had a top load washer it had a diaper setting and I could just toss all the diapers in and they got soaked in bleach and cleaned really well.<br>  <br>  Even when I used the cloth ones on my son it was only at home, I used disposables when we were out so that I didn't have to carry home dirty diapers.<br>  <br>  I'm a bit lazy about it I guess.<br>  <br>  added note: I have used and will again use the cloth diapers once this little one is old enough to start getting ready for potty training, I think babies are much more aware of when they pee if they are in cloth diapers and can feel it. If they don't like the feeling of the wet cloth and try to get it off then they are ready to start training in my opinion.|`|5WP9rLTlaa	cloth, I think the people who think cloth is more work just don't realise how far cloth diapers have come since the terry flats our ancestors used. I've shown quite a few of my disposable using friends my stash and they've been converted because they are just so cute! When a couple of them saw the all in ones they said that if they'd known about them earlier they would have used them from the start.|`|TVC3mAP7aa	We're a Bum Genius one-size family here!  I love our cloth.  We do use disposables when we travel or if we're out and about so we don't have to haul a dirty dipe around with us.  I really don't care for disposables though.  They're stinky, expensive, and don't hold as much fluid, IMO.  We have a front-load, programmable washer, so cleaning them is really very easy.  It's not much more work than a regular load of laundry and I'm doing that anyway!|`|842e7245d92a9eaaf5883492a9c11008aa	disposable. i have a weak stomach and it's hard enough to change a poopy diaper without getting sick so i wouldn't want to put a dirty diaper in the washer. plus, it's just easier.

The way your question is worded it looks like you said you have been wearing your pad for 2 weeks! <br>  <br>  If I were you I would try a different brand. The one you are using may not be agreeing with you. Also try dusting yourself with a little powder to absorb and moisture. That too can give you a rash.|`|1ezYfkX7aa	i would use some diaper rash ointment...should help it =) goodluck and congrats on your new baby.|`|u94HOVz7aa	ya thats happened to me when i'm so light i need something, but not bas enough for a regular pad.  my ob said it can happen just use what ever rash treatment you use on baby.  then try spinkling a little baby powder on it when you put on a new one and it should help keep it gone.  i've gotten this after every baby when i bleed for extended periods.    i'm just glad to hear someone else got this besides my dr. saying it happens.  ok not happy for you just happy to not be alone.|`|9tNr1RMfaa	Try using cloth pads. It helps, a LOT. <br>  <br>  My ***** got pretty chafed from using disposable pads after I had my son, and TRUST ME... that soft cotton feels pretty good :) <br>  <br>  You can buy professionally made mama pads such as these:<br>  <a href="http://www.gladrags.com/" rel="nofollow">http://www.gladrags.com/</a><br>  <br>  (you can also get handmade ones on ebay for much cheaper)<br>  <br>  Or you can just buy a six pack of those printed Gerber Prefolds (the printed ones are pretty thin) and wash them a couple of times. They actually make pretty decent mama pads.|`|yYZTfwT8aa	The way you worded your question sounded like you have been wearing the SAME pad the whole time.  Its okay to wash in a shower or a bath I dont care what ANYONE says.  Use baby wipes if nothing else but stay clean & DRY.  If you use powder then use the kind with zinc in it and Wash it away daily. <br>  Even panties need to be changed to dry clean ones everyday, pads should be changed everytime you can feel moisture or every 4 hours max.  IF you cant' afford to go through pads at that rate use cloths, but stay dry!|`|dOEnB1AVaa	You might be allergic to that kind of panty liner try a different brand.  Sometimes it happens even if you have used it before just change the brand and see how it goes.  If it persist consult the doctor.|`|1SGl03Zlaa	You could try putting some vaseline on it.  I had the same thing happen and thought I'd try the diaper rash cream I had for my daughter, it stung so much I threw it out and have never used anything but baby powder or vaseline on my baby when she has a rash.|`|FidZNMmUaa	I had the same thing after my last baby. Sleep on a blue pad like they have in the hospital. Give your vaginal area a chance to breath. Also, use diaper cream on the chapped part.  That will clear it up.  Congrats on the babe.|`|0waHjrQKaa	Nasty, but I know what you are talking about. But, I thought that maybe it was the type of pad I was using and that it was rubbing the wrong way in the wrong area. I bought another brand and it totally helped.|`|1d96f37d161f5b36db2cdf3bb334c59caa	I hope you're not talking about the same pad you've been wearing for 2 weeks!

The doctor who prescribed it said it was ok while breastfeeding, but the nurse told me to call baby's doctor and ask for his opinion. He said not to take it... they had a newborn in the hospital that died because of his mother was taking codeine. So I didn't take it, even though my baby is 9 months old and would probably be fine, but why to take a chance.|`|mULJMC0waa	Best bet would be to call your doctor.|`|bHAlwhTBaa	Dr. Tom Hale has written a book called Medication and Mothers Milk, which is a great resource.  But your doctor should always be the first line of defense, so definitely call.      Dr. Hale also runs a discussion board, which has posted an article indicating that at least one newborn has died from ingesting codeine which turned toxic in the mother.  (Codeine can turn toxic in nursing mothers - Gene transformed drug into morphine, which killed infant   http://www.theglobeandmail.com/servlet/s... National/home )    Me???  I would never, ever, ever take a chance with my newborns health or safety.  Either quit breastfeeding or find an alternative therapy.

I would say you're wasting your time, but apparently, you don't care enough to do something better with it.  Thanks for the 2 pts. though.|`|RNZaUdxSaa	wow no way.. I would be soo embarassed to have the word fart in my name!! :( sorry but thats the ugliest name I think I have ever seen!!|`|Z0QvOIH0aa	I am truly impressed by your profile page.|`|FvYqKZSMaa	No.|`|cYRZpGkqaa	maybe for a "babby" girl but certainly not a baby!|`|VzOokYEqaa	maybe for a middle name its fine.
1jwbQaZTaa	well my daugther is 17 months and we got her a training toilet. one day while her bath water was running she was standing in the bathroom without a diaper and started to pee on the floor (i think cause the water was running) and so we sat her on the potty and she kept going. we clapped and clapped and told her that she had "went pee pee!!" so we ask her, "riley, do you have to pee pee??" and point to the bathroom, and when shes in the mood to be cooperative, she will shake her head yes or no. haha. she only uses it a few times a week but i feel we are well on our way! <br>  <br>  make sure to reward your child though, little treats, or dance and sing make up a crazy "pee pee in the potty" song or dance that everyone can learn so your baby knows they have done something wonderful!|`|sXpGfHWWaa	I have four kids and potty training is really easier than it seems, just get a kid potty seat:<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.gumtree.com/posting_images/59/33646459__1232586717__1__1-0b4dd86090f42ba2312b2b5daed26e07.__big__.jpg" rel="nofollow">http://www.gumtree.com/posting_images/59...</a><br>  <br>  ( You place it on the toilet because their little legs cant wrap around the whole toilet) And you ask them every 30-60 minutes do you need to go to the bathroom, sometimes they tell you and sometimes they dont so ocassionally MAKE them sit on the toilet even if nothing comes out. REMEMBER: Make them at least try to go when they wake up, before their nap, and when the go to sleep at night... just so they get the hang of it.<br>  <br>  <br>  Edit:<br>  We started potty training all of our children at about 2 1/2|`|TkD54z4taa	I started potty training about two months ago (She was 22 months) she is now fully potty trained but still wears a diaper at night and a pull up during nap time. We just bought several pair of stretch pants and underwear in her favorite designs. (Mickey Mouse)  She would of course have accidents, and then we would tell her that she can't potty in her underwear and needs to go on the toilet. We took her to the potty every 1/2 hour and when she went we gave her a special treat (marshmallows) She picked it up after about a month, and and still had  accidents every once in awhile. Now, she is completely trained and even asks me to go potty when we are out and about.  Good luck to you!
D35xKICoaa	It is spotting but is best to see you doc.Good luck( )( )|`|ZbnxGIsnaa	No periods or lighter bleeding. The most obvious sign that lets a woman know (or suspect) she is pregnant is missing her menstrual period. However, not all women experience 'no bleeding at all', and this can confuse them about whether they are pregnant, or if their pregnancy will continue.    A few women will experience what is called an 'implantation bleed'. This is where a light bleed occurs as the growing baby burrows into the lining of their mother's uterus (usually about 12 days after the egg has been fertilised, or 'conceived'). An implantation bleed will typically occur just before (or around the time) the next period would have been due. However, it is usually not as heavy, or as long as a normal period. Caregivers will usually try and find out if a woman's last 'period' WAS normal, to avoid calculating the baby's due date from an implantation bleed, which would miscalculate the baby's actual due date at about 3 to 4 weeks later.    Occasionally, a woman will continue to have a small, red or pinkish vaginal loss for a day or so around the time that their period would have been due (for example at around 4, 8, 12 and 16 weeks of the pregnancy). This is more common during early pregnancy, but can persist into later pregnancy as well.    Some women will experience bright spotting (fresh bleeding), or brown spotting (bleeding that happened a day or so ago), at some stage during their pregnancy. This may appear as a heavy bleed (like a period), a 'light period', or as something that she notices when wiping herself after going to the toilet. About 50% of women who experience bleeding during the first 12 weeks of their pregnancy will continue to experience a normal pregnancy. However, up to 50% of women will experience a miscarriage at some point after the bleeding starts. Early pregnancy bleeding is usually investigated by an ultrasound.|`|KozoNqpsaa	The stringy/clear CM is usually when you're ovulating, so it sounds like you ovulated later than you thought. The spotting on the 18th could have just been mid-cycle spotting..I have that once in awhile too. If your period is due now and doesn't get heavier, it might be implantation bleeding. Try taking an hpt...wait til tomorrow morning, so it will be more concentrated then.  Good luck!|`|ti3AEcIFaa	go to the doctor please.|`|kYaCOTQbaa	Ok here goes,    You most likely ovulated on between day 14 and 17 of your cycle that is if you have a regular cycle. If it was the 23rd then it could be implantaion bleeding as it is now 11 days after and that is about right. Your period should also be due in the next few days so hang on tight and if you skip do a test do not be dipondent if it is neg at first wait a few days and test again.    Lots of Baby dust|`|7G8w8TZcaa	u did ovulate.i found out i was pregnant 6 days before my periods were even due,my early symptoms were the white clear discharge most of the time & my cervix had gone high.to me it sounds like u r pregnant.all the best & tons of baby dust coming ur way.

Rn9SO1Wjaa	I completely understand where you are coming from, my best friend's kid is mean! she will not allow my daughter to play with her toys everything is hers even if it is something that belongs to my daughter! My daughter constantly comes to me and tells me that the lil girl is being mean to her or that she just ripped her drawing up things that make me so upset yet my friend will see my daughter crying and not punish her kid!!! it drove me nuts, till my husband and I decided that enough was enough so we stopped going to get together because of that reason there were times where I found myself having to discipline her kids!!! eventually they started noticing that we weren't going to their  get togethers so she called and asked why we weren't around much and I told her the truth! I think that helped alot cause the girls seem to be getting along much better and I noticed that she is reprimanding her daughter when she has to which is great!|`|cAtWxJG1aa	Sure.  I'd either have the kids play in the same room where the adults are so that problems could be cut off before they started (not a bad idea for that age range, anyway), or, if even that failed, invite the parents for an "adults' night out."|`|F6lZHRkVaa	I would probably just tell them, "You know I love you guys, but we're having some problems with your son. When he's here he pushes and hits our kid, and he's hard to control. We want to continue seeing all of you but we're not sure how to handle your this situation. What do you think we should do?"  And say it with a smile and genuine concern.    Good luck!|`|ABvw9Ocoaa	keep going just suggest no sugar, toys, tv, or anything. the kid will learn that if he wants something he will have to earn it.|`|JsqMSU9Haa	I agree with your husband. The friendship is kinda over.  Once we had kids, there are plenty of friends we hardly see either because our parenting styles are different and its awkward, the kids aren't crazy about each other or they don't have kids.  It's just how it goes - life changes.  There's friends I've made now that are just based on how well my kids get along with their kids.  That's what its all about.  You'll find new friends better suited for your family.  Hopefully this family will get help for their child.|`|SnQvsOPwaa	I cut them off. Why subject my kid to that kinda crap if I don't have to.|`|prqrQcd1aa	I would tend to agree with your husband here. I have a child that has acted like this in the past, the thing is i've gotten help for my child and did not turn a blind eye.    I would talk to the parents about the behavior of their son and ask them if maybe he doesn't need help, or maybe he doesn't need more discipline... i don't know what it is in their case, but if this child goes on like this unchecked he's going to get into some major trouble when he is older and his parents are going to have their hands full.     I mean you don't have to be mean to them about it, but you could tell them "hey, your kid is mean to other kids, what do you do to handle it, because my son doesn't like it when he's mean to him" go from there on what you say to them. It may be that they are so tired of him acting like this that they instead have given up.. when really they need to get the child some help. If they voice their concern, tell them you've heard of other parents with problems like this and they got help for the child, and not in the form of medicine either.. there are behavioral specialists and mobile therapists and tss workers that can help show parents how to get a child like this to calm down w/o meds..unless he has some serious issues (which sadly even after doing all of the things i mentioned above, i did have to put my child on meds, and honestly it was the best thing i could have done for her given her situation.

But if it was your bloody show you are probably a day or two away. I wish you the best of luck and congrats!!!

um29wkUPaa	Hey Sweetgrass... this is our room.  Stay if you like but quit barking at my friends.    Trolling is hard work.  They get bored when there's no response.  There was a time where there was a post about them (her) every day, and many answers were filled with snide remarks.  Made her more motivated than ever.  When we all decided to let it roll, it lightened up.    Incidentally, there is more than one mom in Texas, and the one we know doesn't knock her kids skulls together.  But thanks for watching out for our best interest.  I'll helmet shop before I log on tomorrow.|`|xXnFx6qLaa	I used to have one.

If you feel the uterus contract above and below your belly button those are real contractions.  If not they are probably still "prodomal" ones.|`|toOzi7aLaa	Maybe.   Just allow your labor to progress! You will know soon enough if your in labor or if its just a false alarm.

At 41 weeks, it could happen at anytime, just try to relax because if you are going into labor, you need to get some rest first! The mucous could just be heavier discharge, but could be some of your mucous plug.  If your cotnractions get 3-5 minutes apart for at least an hour, consistent, not varying, then call your doctor to see what he/she advises.

ynjrtIdUaa	It is normal.  My son did too.  I told my doctor, and he kind of chuckled and said that his skull is still soft and it won't completely harden for another year or so.  He gets moms asking about it a lot.    If it would make you feel better, start alternating which side you rock him, how he sleeps, and ask your doctor.|`|a12ec3c7a1904953da25d39f65b70f18aa	It's normal.

Don't worry, just be careful.|`|toOzi7aLaa	its normal his head is still soft it will form into place|`|c0Hx73ITaa	That's probably normal - his brain and skeletal system are still developing, and it's normal for babies' heads to look awkward or large in areas.    You should tell your baby's doctor about this though at his next check up just in case.|`|kjdKkDAkaa	We have a niece that was concerned about the shape of her baby's heads.  They took them to a doctor who fitted them with a hat to wear -- it looked like a little football helmet.  The baby wore it during all during the day while it was awake. They had three babies --not all at once but about a year apart --and each child had a special made helmet --fitted so that the growing head would be shaped by the helmet it was wearing.  The helmets  were all  painted differently.  The grandfather (my husband's brother) didn't like the idea of that for the baby --but all three of the children are doing well.   The length of time each child wore the helmet was different -- I think depending on when the child was first fitted with it .
DwFDF0A2aa	Those children should have been out of diapers NO LATER than three years old!  They have been in diapers for two years too long!  Child protective services could actually take those children from their parents.  I would suggest that you try to intervene.  Obviously you are the only one who is noticing that there is something wrong.  Arrange a play date for them with children their own age.  Give them a bath, put them in pull-ups and read to them.  <br>  Try to make the time that you spend with them structured.  They are probably developmentally delayed, so try things that two year olds like.  Water play, sand play, play dough, art projects.  Bath times are a great time (and place) for them to have some water play and get clean.  Put measuring cups in the tub and talk to them a lot.  Narrate everything you are doing and talk, talk, TaLk.  <br>  You will need to spend a lot of time with these children in order to help them.  They won't be accepted into kindergarden.  <br>  If you aren't willing to spend this time with them, you might consider going to a local resource center to find someone who will be willing to help these poor children.  It isn't the children's fault, it is the parents fault.  Something needs to be done.<br>  This is abuse|`|MMj7YcXkaa	yes, they are too old.  i feel it is bad parenting, did you try to hint that it seems weird that their kids are like 1 year olds?  you might want to contact cps.  their well being might be in jeopardy|`|NzezdETKaa	wow,that sounds pretty bad. how are those kids ever going to learn? i'm on your side for this one.|`|949517353a847c7e512b934758a0b451aa	here are three letters that you need to learn---CPS!!!!!!!!!!!|`|75c40712ce4c1c9063d61b17387937f9aa	yes, bad parenting, unfortunatly its hard to discuss that sorta thing with a friend. i don't knwo if you have yet, but maybe you need to be the bigger friend and sit your friend down and have a lil talk. not about her being a bad parent, you will lose your friend, but maybe about how her kids act at your house and that you do not like it. at 5 they are hard to keep in any kind of playpen or seat. maybe you could suggest meeting at her house and leaving your child with a babysitter when you go to visit? or meet in a mutual place like a Mc Donalds. good luck with that, i know that i personally as a parent have worked hard to make sure my children do not behave as such, but not everyone sees what they do not want to.|`|sXpGfHWWaa	Yes they are too old to be doing this obviously but my step daughter (10) has a best friend just like that her and her sister have no punishment, yes this is bad parenting, but you cant really do too much but just let them be, when they do come over my suggestion would be to bring a "play pen" or a "swing" or some time of baby toy that holds them out into the living room so your daughter will be in the eyes of everyones, and if they continue to mess around with your daughter just say " Guys, the baby is trying to sleep" even if he is not.|`|AMyZvgcVaa	I would think it's bad parenting!! I would suggest you offer to babysit the kids and then start teaching somethings if you want you could also call a counselor to help your friend or just speak to them or bring over some 5 year olds yourself and show them how 5 year olds should act!!|`|ntdGOZqGaa	Yikes, I dont blame you for not wanting them at your house hell i wouldnt either. seems like bad parenting

W9231Egtaa	i'm guessing she's not starting until september.  can you put her into some sort of class with other kids her age before then? art, music, sports, swimming lessons?  basically anything that can get her used to being away from you for a few hours at a time with other children. i was also never away from my mom and had a hard time starting pre-k (i used to cry and make an "i love you" drawing each morning.) but i eventually acclimated to it and loved it.|`|Tvq32ptlaa	This too shall pass.....  It may take a while but she will get better and better until one day she'll take off to her classroom and "forget" to give you a kiss good-bye.    I agree with the above suggestions.  Get her into some sort of class or group environment.  Swimming, dance, ballet, gymnastics.  Take her to group sessions at the library, maybe she'll meet a friend that will be in her school (or better yet class).    Since you are a stay-at-home mom maybe you can volunteer and help the teacher in the classroom on occasion.  I loved doing this in my son's preschool!  I was deemed "Field trip mom" because i didn't miss a one.    Good luck and be strong!!!
4DoXomHZaa	You have a 20% chance of being pregnant. Wait till you are a day late and then test.    The charts seem promising, but when you look into the validity of pregnancies producing those signs and those signs happening and no pregnancy occuring, it's pretty disheartening. I had many picture perfect charts and BFNs. I decided to give up the charts, they made me nuts, gave me false hope, stressed me out...I let Mother Nature do the work now.    The nausea doesn't normally come until later...not in less than 2 weeks from conception...    Good luck to you|`|9RuBwanoaa	you could be. it sort of sounds like it.    i would take the pregancy test 5 days before missed period.|`|6cVZtWG9aa	theres a good chance but wait till ur periods due or u could end up with a false negative,  i think u r anyway... good luck|`|D35xKICoaa	I think you are but wait and see what is the out come good luck(****)

mULJMC0waa	You as mother your number on priority is your kid. If you child only sleeps while you nurse her. I would just let her sleep on you. It may be a weird thought for you but look at it this way. You get a chance to take a nap also. And mother and daughter time is a good time to bond. Even if it is taking a nap.    Good luck|`|72aa4d0937174be512576dfccdea6b0eaa	make him get tired.|`|AA11661476	Do you have one of those music cd's on her crib?|`|aYoscopKaa	You could try playing more games and doing more things with her, tier her out abit more.  Hope this helps and good luck :)  x|`|J6YHRvnVaa	take her on a car ride,or for a walk in her stroller, the car ride worked  for my daughter more than the stroller|`|1dMpQwsCaa	You have to let her cry. Trust me. When you put her down thinking she is asleep but then she wakes when she notices you are not there is because she feels secure when you are there. Let your child be independent early on. LET HER CRY. When you do this for 3 days or so, trust me she will not fight you.     I will warn you though. It will be hard to hear your child cry but be strong, do not go in the room at all. It may take 20 minutes or an hour for her to stop crying and go to sleep but you will not regret it after the end results.|`|toOzi7aLaa	I think its time to "train" the baby!    Every baby is  diff rent but i had a sleep fighter as well!     First i cut off the sleeping in my room. What is the point in having a crib if the baby doesn't sleep in it?    I used a bubby after nursing i popped it in his mouth and put him in the crib. I always had some kind of sound playing in the room so that abrupt noises such as the door bell didn't startle.    For the first couple of weeks he would cry but a little crying won't hurt a baby especially when there fussy.    I was watching a segment that said this part of the baby's life is where they learn to "self sooth" so allowing some crying is okay!    Hope my way is something that can help!|`|SqTPbWvpaa	well congrats on your 3 month old baby!    well the best thing to do is to apply some lotion (preferably lavender) to relax the baby and then swaddle your little one.      good luck|`|TjsR0nc4aa	It might be a pain, but try to nurse her while she is lying down and you are on your side.  If your breasts aren't quite large enough to reach her, try lying on pillows to elevate you and have your breast right over your baby.  Be careful not to squash your tiny one :-)    The theory behind this is it is the change in position and motion that wakes her.  If she is already lying down, then she won't sense such a dramatic change.|`|bHAlwhTBaa	My little guy (9 mo)  would not nap routinely between 3 and 4 months.  This was also the time when he was waking up every morning at 4 am.  At 4 months old, he began sleeping later and napping regularly.  For me, 3 to 4 months was the hardest time.      I agree that you need to train her and let her go down awake.  But you are doing the best you can.  Let her sleep habits develop, and stay as routine as possible!!       Good Luck!!|`|EOjobfUUaa	Well I also have a three months old. what I do I take her a bath put on fresh diapper and put on a little body lotion on her and massage her tommy for a fews minutes and than feed her and play with her a little bit, and she falls to sleep. bady want to feel clean and confortable.|`|bdc0c1d1aead267282553512169a9932aa	so let her fight till she sleeps...|`|lCbsCM6raa	I think you are going to get two completely opposite trains of thought here:  1) Do not let your baby cry or be upset and do whatever you need to soothe her to sleep and keep her asleep and happy, which will probably mean inserting your boob into her mouth and keeping it there until she is asleep and holding that position during all of her naps and nighttime sleep until she decides she doesn't want it anymore (I have no idea when that is??)  2) Put your baby down awake and let her learn to self-soothe, which will likely involve some crying and you will feel like a piece of crap.  I know, these options both suck. Personally, I went with number 2 and my daughter now sleeps pretty well most of the time. It is not easy in the short term but probably the better option in the long term. Good luck!|`|kSCS1lR0aa	have you ever thought of here to wear herself out! some babies like to go crazy and run around or even cry and then she will pass out on her own or sing or play or give her some way to sleep easy like music and food|`|9eouWphjaa	I imagine holding and laying down with her and probably taking a nap with her also might work but she is a baby and they just like to cause havoc. Best of luck tho. Baby's like to be comforted expecially when there young.
4DoXomHZaa	You certainly can ovulate on the pill if you don't take them correctly. Normally they recommend you start the pill the Sunday after your period starts or the first day of your period...not in between somewhere or at the last day...then if you missed one it's very possible you could ovulate.    Sperm can live 5 days, so since you were "uncareful"...you could be pg. Every doc I know recommends taking the pill 2 weeks at least, most say 4 weeks before you don't need back up.    Wait two weeks and test.
yPhkTBYlaa	Your chances obviously increase the more times you have sex during your fertile window. The problem with having sex on the day you ovulate is the egg disintigrates so quickly, and it takes a while for the sperm to travel up there (as more often than not conception occurs in the fallopian tubes)<br>  Sperm can remain viable for up to four days in the vagina, but the more swimmers you have the better :).|`|V7sfV5odaa	Ovulation occurs on only one day in each cycle and the egg lives for only 12-24 hours unless fertilised. Sperm need mucus in order to survive for more than a very short time. However, in the presence of mucus indicating fertility, sperm may live 3-5 days.<br>  <br>  A couple's fertility depends on:<br>  <br>  normal ovulation <br>  healthy sperm <br>  healthy cervix producing satisfactory mucus <br>  healthy endometrium (lining of the womb) <br>  healthy fallopian tubes <br>  harmonious relationship between husband and wife. <br>  Contraceptives work to interfere with the operation of one or more of these factors.|`|06d711c37564584379b1af164dbbe840aa	If you're trying to become pregnant.........why not have sex on all of those days?  Actually your egg will only last a short time after ovulation if not fertilized.   Sperm can last up to 3 days if your body produces high quality cervical mucus.  Therefore, having sex prior to ovulation can increase your chances to conceive.  If you have not read the book "Take Charge of Your Fertility" by Toni Wexler, I highly recommend it!|`|F83M10rlaa	you can get an ovulation calender on webmd.com it will tell you when you will ovlate and how many days you just have to give dates of your last 3 of periods.|`|MHeOHOnbaa	the day before and the day after your period is the highest times to get pregnant
uFrqC4Y2aa	If you had period after you had sex I woudn't worry.|`|ti3AEcIFaa	maybe....but you need to go to the doctor because we cannot really tell you and be for sure about it.....|`|5dx544amaa	It is possible, although you should see a doctor to confirm.|`|rYhm4LN1aa	TAKE A DAMN PREGNANCY TEST!     so sick of this question!! HOW WOULD WE KNOW?|`|AA11577233	It's hard to say. It actually takes a few weeks for you to become pregnant after sex, and cramps can be a sign of your period, especially if you've been consuming a lot of sodium lately.    However, if you are pregnant, then your body should be at the point for home pregnancy tests to tell you whether you are. So get tested.|`|6kue5meiaa	It is possible that you might be pregnant, but I'd wait a month before worrying. Right now you are 24 days into your cycle. The average length of time between periods is 28 days, but it may go as long as 30 days and still be within "normal" range. Also, your periodic cycles may be affected by a variety of factors from body-fat (too little and you may not get them at all, according to studies done on Olympic atheletes) to stress. So relax, at least for now.|`|eSwACpEhaa	Absolutely not... NO!!!|`|kWuT9bVlaa	Similar thing happened to me. Had sex before my period was supposed to start and although I conceived before my period, I still had some bleeding. However, it was not heavy bleeding like my normal periods, and sure enough, February came with no period. Take a test, a lot of clinics offer free pregnancy tests if you do not have the 11-13 dollars for a home tests.|`|dcNmRPGPaa	you have no period when pregnant, what women think is their period is the uterus adjusting, not an actual period.|`|zJv8LA5Yaa	Yes.  A friend of mine had her period the first 7 months of her pregnancy.|`|1po7rtiwaa	Erm, nope?|`|xvO329lyaa	I had my periods as normal throughout pregnancy|`|z9IPEsFsaa	noo|`|6cVZtWG9aa	nope|`|tTLA5CQlaa	you definitely can still get your period when your pregnant. I know tons of people who had their period through most if not all of their pregnancy.|`|CHCPnvksaa	Probably not. you were ovulating around Dec 20. And if you're cramping it's a sign that your period is coming. You don't cramp while pregnant because your body isn't trying to push anything out.|`|GEyJMsaKaa	You didn't say if you used a condemn or not. No,you are probably just about to start your period. But take a pregnancy test if you still worry.|`|dFOcEmWMaa	no hun, no periods at all when you are pregnant|`|dPmK83UYaa	Your best bet is to wait it out. I know it's hard to b/c we just WANNA KNOW!!! lol...but the truth is unless u buy a pregnancy test that tells u sooner than the rest you can't know until the right time. Best test is a blood test taken w/ the doctors. If ur pregnant ur pregnant if not ur not. It won't change w/ time if u know now or later...just take care of yourself while you wait for the outcome. Patience my dear, Patience.
hqogf9oGaa	Hello    So far as I am aware, your employer will pay you your normal salary for 6 weeks then, although the government pay the SMP your employer will pay it directly to you and then claim this money back therefore there should be no break in your income.  So long as you have advised your employer that you intend to take maternity leave the Sunday before your 25th week of pregnancy then you have done your part.  You will also have needed to work for your employer for 26 weeks or for any employer totalling 26 weeks within the 66 week period prior to your due date in order for them to pay you SMP directly.  If this is not the case then you will require to complete a form and send it to the relevant government office so that they can pay your SMP.  If you need one of these forms you need to call 0800 0 55 66 88.    There may have been some internal forms that your employer needed you to complete however if you have worked for your employer for the 26 weeks then you should not have needed to fill in any other "government" forms.    As far as how often you will paid you would normally find that SMP will be paid when your salary would normally have been paid however, if you are claiming from the government directly you would have the choice of receiving payments weekly or 4 weekly.  The advisors at the number abovewill be able to tell you if you can decide how often to be paid SMP.    Good luck!    Indigo    xxx|`|gD6MynLdaa	Congrats on the new baby... Try this website.  I hope this helps.    http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maternity_p...|`|ZWrLzr0vaa	Your employer should sort this out. If in doubt phone up and any money you are owed will be put into your account. I would guess it is monthly as that is how mine was paid in. remember you will be able to get working family tax as well.|`|7a096ae38b04b4eba7d2b4428f355354aa	You send in a Mat B1 form which you get from you doctor or midwife 15 wks before your due date. Your employer sort out your S.M.P. If your paid monthly then you get it monthly, if weekly then weekly, it's around 100 a week.     I work for the N.H.S and get full pay for 3mnths, then 1/2 pay and s.m.p for 3 months, then s.m.p. for 3mnths. You have to be employed for a yr to get this. Ring your H.R. dept and they will explain also.  I hope this helps. I'm due in june, when are you due?    Best wishes, another tip is buy a buggy you can add a seat onto like Phil and teds, will save you money if think of having another baby in 2 yrs or so, wish I'd done that at the time!    Best wishes,  T. :)|`|ZbJ0bx3Uaa	Your employer should give you FMLA paperwork. I'm a contractor for the government and I was given those papers to receive pay, unfortunately I haven't been on with them long enough.     Talk to your supervisor about what you need to fill out and when it needs to be in.
OHmVVB9Iaa	I am the proud parents of 4 kids<br>  After my first i was happy after the birth of my second i was equally if not more ecstatic idk what the people were thinkng but i think you will be  OVERJOYED with ur second|`|OVMb4V7Maa	I was just as happy when I gave birth to my second child-of course, that might be because my second was my first daughter. I love them both equally, but I was so happy to know that I was a mother to a boy and a girl, and not just one or the other. The perfect balance. I couldn't asked for more, but I do hope to eventually have my third baby with my boyfriend (it'd be his first though, since my kids are a previous boyfriend's).|`|caWdGcvgaa	I am 5 months pregnant with my 2nd right now and I have heard that a lot too... but I have also heard that it is exactly the same feeling you have with your first and I have had people tell me that it takes a day or two until you start feeling that way... <br>  <br>  I think everyone is different and I wouldn't stress too much about it because it will happen and if it isn't instant with you and your second daughter that is nothing to be ashamed of because you still love her just as much! I mean with your second you have a lot more going on in your life... you have another child to think about and worry about and care about, so if it takes you a little longer to bond with the second... well you have a darn good reason why!<br>  <br>  Good luck and Congrats!|`|2448af06b59df00dd8a1a3ac6d057c75aa	ahh not true <br>  remember all the crap u were told when u were preggo for the first time ppl like to be negative <br>  you will do wonderful|`|4URp7Ew6aa	Sorry I can't help you much because I'm pregnant with my first right now! But I am sure you will love this baby just as much as the last!
FCcbgriuaa	Yes! It sure sounds like it.    Implantation happens when the fertilized egg, the blastocyst, has completed its travel through the fallopian tube and attaches to the lining of the uterus. The blastocyst is a cluster of tiny cells, smaller than the head of a pin.  Implantation happens on average nine days (6-12 days) after ovulation and fertilization.  Some women report having implantation symptoms like implantation bleeding or implantation cramping.   Implantation bleeding usually consists of a couple of drops of blood, which can be either red or brown. If the bleeding is heavier more like a period, then it's unlikely implantation bleeding.  Most pregnant women, however typically have little to no symptoms on the day of implantation and do not experience typical implantation bleeding, while some women who are not pregnant may experience some spotting which they believe could be implantation.|`|9RuBwanoaa	it could be but we cant be sure.    i say take a pregancy test 5 days before your missing period.|`|D35xKICoaa	yes i think so good luck (****)|`|1z3C0R2Vaa	Yes it could be and it also can last for one day wait  a few more days and test. good luck....
9EkFrApiaa	Hmm...that isn't much of a temp increase but the spotting would lead me to believe, yes.  That happened to me one month and I wasn't pregnant which AMAZED me because I spotted, sore boobs, nausea but I think I talked myself into pregnancy symptoms.  I never even got my period that month, at all, so who knows.  The body is strange but good luck!
vlMd2vHxaa	Congrats on your triplets! I'm a mommy to 4-month-old twin girls. Twins run in my family as well. At the beginning I was terribly sick and lost weight. By the middle of my second trimester the sickness subsided and I finally started showing. By the end I was so huge I could barely do anything. I couldn't sleep and I could only eat a little food at a time because my stomach was so squished by the babies! With multiples it's very common to deliver early, especially with triplets. Most doctors will expect you to deliver at least 4-6 weeks early. It really depends on your doctor whether or not they will let you have them naturally. For twins alot of docs will let you try if the babies are in the right position. With triplets it's harder to get everyone lined up. The docs that deliver at the hospital near me don't usually let women with triplets try naturally. But that doesn't mean that your doctor won't do it. Try and find one that has experience with multiples if you can!     I had to be induced with my twins because they didn't want to come out! They were born at 39 weeks 5 days! I had them vaginally, but I took the epidural in case of the need for an emergency c-section. Best of luck to you and your babies!|`|yznZqcznaa	Were you doing fertility treatments?  Or IVF?  Congrats on the bakery, bun would not really apply :)  Im sure you are nervous but everything will be just fine.  I would suggest getting a book on multiple pregnancy.  That will probably help calm your nerves.|`|32747dcd374c857319720ae0aa088b0faa	I know one person who had triplets, with no fertility drugs involved. It's not as common as twins, but it happens. She had a C-section, but I've known people with twins who delivered them vaginally.    Congratulations!|`|uzCaG1ayaa	I had twins, a boy and a girl. It was painful but not as bad as my pregnancy after that with my daughter. Of course you can have a natural birth with multiple babies otherwise how would it have been possible for us to naturally be able to grow multiple children inside us? I had a natural birth for my twins.  Congratulations..x
ebcfaff0504724aa2ad756522576c3b2aa	Yes, it is normal for the period to be heavier and possibly the cramping worse after you've had a baby. However, if you are experiencing this much discomfort, you should make an appointment with your OB to make sure everything is alright. Your belly hurting could be a sign of something else, always better to be safe than sorry. And there are medical treatments for an extremely disruptive period (usually involving hormones like birth control pills--maybe switch what you're on or start taking something.)

The recommendations are to hold off solids till 6 months, but if you tell your health visitor that she is waking up through the night, they may recommend that you start a little rice cereal and go from there. But you must determine that it's hunger that wakes her first, which may not be the case.  Given that she is often waking soon after going to bed, it suggests that it's more discomfort as a result of teething. Try some teething gel or powder, they really helped my eldest - then see if that changes anything.|`|in6nku0Kaa	probably starting to teeth
1z3C0R2Vaa	Your period is on the way that is why you feel that way.But you can test again in a few day time if  that ugly lady don't show up(smile)|`|KozoNqpsaa	I would wait until the day your period is actually due, then test that morning or even the next morning. False negatives are more common when testing too early and the HPT's are not very accurate 3-5 days out.  Good luck hon!|`|4DoXomHZaa	Oh yes. Happened to me. It's the mind playing tricks on you in your desire to be pregnant. The early signs of pregnancy and PMS are newarly identical.    Of course the test said negative. It's way too early. Wait till MOnday and if no period, test then.
wfDzUSItaa	Steam them in the microwave, a little water in a steamed veggie bag with the wipes and then put them into a ziploc bag right after.|`|7rCeCVl2aa	Sure. Put some water on them. But in all honestly wipes are not that expensive. Wouldn't you rather just buy a new pack?|`|IGcS9K62aa	Add water? <br>  <br>  I know those dry things they give you in the hospital spring to life with water. It might be worth a try on a few!|`|23C49tEOaa	when this happens occasionally at my house i don't "rehydrate" them.  my daughter has pretty sensitive skin and when she catches a cold, i use them as tissues.  they are much softer than most kleenex and don't irritate her face as much.|`|Ag0jb7Neaa	i have done that before too<br>  i just run them under the tap<br>  they seem to come back to 'life'<br>  i am sure some of the 'stuff' is gone but they seem to work well|`|1d96f37d161f5b36db2cdf3bb334c59caa	Just run them under water in the sink. Don't over do it.|`|1ezYfkX7aa	Maybe pour a little water on them...|`|wmc7uHLIaa	Nope.  Buy a wipe warmer.  Then you are not using the wipes right out of the resealable pack, which will dry out faster.  If you load wipes into a wipe warmer and use them from there, they will stay moist.  Plus your baby will appreciate being wiped with a warm cloth, instead of a cold one.|`|PTdy6TWRaa	Put the stack into a zip-lock bag with a saturated sponge.|`|lah6ZdSsaa	water|`|eI1AzFcLaa	they won't be the same...but add a little water to them.
uFrqC4Y2aa	If it wasn't meat and you still feel fine you and the baby are fine.|`|v3LnJycKaa	the only fear with defrosting meats is that the decomp that has been stopped due to freezing is now sped up, if meat is left defrosted for even short amounts of time without being in a cold environment you risk bacteria, but you woul dbe able to see and smell the rot in the meat... you are saying no meat, then you should be perfectly fine@|`|LrHPqW0aaa	If the food was still cold and no meat, I think you & baby should be fine. How do you feel if you feel sick because of it you should call your Dr.|`|dabb7cb4d7639bd2bd72a8903ba3c9efaa	my guess if your ok the baby is ok...but i wouldn't eat anymore...good luck with the baby...|`|AA10280194	Typically, food has to sit completely thawed at room temperature for 4 hours before spoiling bacteria begins to grow.  If your food was still cold or partially frozen then it was fine and the baby will be OK too :-)|`|Iks1qdElaa	If you're not sick than how could the baby get sick? Your baby doesn't actually eat the food you eat, the umbilical cord is their source of nursihment, the vitamins and nutrients from the food you eat filters through the cord to benefit them.
p0prrzf2aa	aw well congrats. it's very amazing!<br>  <br>  but u/s are very accurate, i guessed i was 12 weeks and 3 days...so they measured and i was right :)<br>  <br>  so you really are 12 weeks 4 days, unless the baby is growing super fast :)|`|12bc27fa7b718990cbf3a82111b05148aa	Hey, I had my first ultrasound today too! Yay! The ultrasound is pretty accurate for dating (which is why they do it that way), and yes, that first ultrasound will often change how many weeks along you think you are. At your next ultrasound later in the pregnancy, you could always ask the tech if the baby looks like it is still on track for the same due date. Either way, while the due date is very important to us, it is really not THAT important because babies rarely come on their due dates anyway.<br>  <br>  Sure mention your pain to your doctor at your next appointment, why not?|`|1ss17pyzaa	They are fairly accurate. Different parts may measure longer than they are suppose to (arms,legs,head,ETC) but its nothing to red flag unless your doctor tells you. You may measure larger because your baby is going to be bigger. If the measurements are within 2 weeks of your due date I wouldn't worry. Also if the baby is growing at each ultrasound that mans everything is fine.<br>  <br>  <br>  I would have the back looked at too.|`|lah6ZdSsaa	Ultrasound is very accurate, especially in the first trimester.  The farther along you are, the less accurate the sono is.   So yes, if the sono said you were 12 weeks 4 days than you are.|`|1jwbQaZTaa	well the ultrasound tech can tell you the measurements, but like she said, the doc has to go over it and then tell you his results. i am 22w 1 day and in u/s i measure exactly that.. it just depends, it doesnt necesarily mean your due date is wrong, but keep in mind your in the very early stages, your due date can fluctuate for a while.  and yes if you have any concerns about your body, related to pregnancy or not, for the next 9 months your OB is your doc for everything, you tell him anything and everything that your body is doing that concerns you!<br>  <br>  goood luck!|`|qMI6H6Lbaa	my first ultrasound measured me to be 6 weeks and i thought i was 7 i know alot about child planning and i was charting every day taking my temp and checking cervix and fluid so i know exactly when i ovulated so I still think that i am due june 18th or 19ths instead of the 24th like the doctor says.   i have had 43 ultrasounds and they all are sticking with the doctors origional measurments.
QAGhFzFsaa	yepp it sure can!!! I had one sinus infection after another during my pregnancy due to my allergies and my doctors kept checking me for pre-eclampsia. At one point my bp was 182/110... SCARY!!! I actually ended up with P.E. after I gave birth though... figures! I'm sure yours is all due to your ear infection. Hope all is better soon, and *ENJOY THE BED TIME NOW* everyone told me that before I had my son and know I understand why.... enjoy it!|`|yNoENquTaa	in most pregnancies i was told by a nurse that the blood pressure naturally gets higher. but also being sick can also increases this and added stress too. and monday isn't far away. you'll be ok. just let your body get better and you'll be right to pop that baby out. =]<br>  ???|`|W4J7Ary0aa	I would think so cuz. I am 40 weeks and 2 days the passed two and a half weeks I have been sick and then a sinus infection. My blood pressure got as high as 150/84 and they really did not do much. which looking back seems weird. My last visit though I was 136/69. My whole pregnancy till that point I was about 122-125/69. I have not been sick besides the sniffles in about 5 years so I feel like a little child not knowing what is really wrong LOL|`|PZjTc0geaa	Of course being sick can raise your BP, especially if you have a fever. Once you get over this bug and feel better, your BP should go down. Don't worry- only 5 more weeks!|`|o9nSygbEaa	It's funny that you're BP was 140/90 because that's what mine was as well. I was really sick the past two weeks. Bronchitis, pink eye, upper respiratory infection and fluid in my ears. Last time I went to the midwife (2 weeks ago) my BP was 102/60. When I went to the ER Sunday morning my BP was 140/90 which is about the highest it's ever been, pregnant or not. <br>  <br>  Between being uncomfortable/pain, not sleeping, not eating well and being dehydrated your BP can go up considerably. Take the week to rest in bed and drink LOTS of fluids. I went through so much water, tea and freezy pops and couldn't believe how long it took me to start peeing regularly. I didn't realize how dehydrated I had gotten. Eat well, rest and drink and I'm sure your BO will be down by Monday.

DO3grY10aa	I like the meaning and the sound.  Artist Pablo Picasso had a daughter named Paloma who is a designer.  <br>  <br>  As for the comment that paloma also means popcorn, that term is "palomitas". Besides, that does not create a negative connotation.  Paloma is a very feminine name.|`|VII5wup3aa	I like it. I think it's beautiful and exotic sounding. She would definitely never be forgotten.

But, you have to try to think positively and look at this is a new a chance and opportunity to be a mommy again. <br>  Please seek the medical attention that you need. Once you see that little heartbeat going you will feel a lot better.
tht0DrHsaa	Just another wonderful symptom.  Good luck and I hope you have a easy delivery.|`|ZbnxGIsnaa	It could be!  I never had sore boobs before I delivered, but maybe that means your milk is coming down and you are indeed getting ready to deliver.  (Hence, your breasts preparing for breastfeeding.)    Maybe you should contact your OB and see what they say.  I'll chalk it down to your hormones high at this stage.   Have your bag ready and packed though!

SBZOVEueaa	definitely do not use bleach - it is unnecessary -<br>  <br>  i have not yet had that problem w/my diapers but i use vinegar at least every other month - <br>  <br>  it sounds as if you may need to strip your diapers as well - <br>  <br>  i would strip first - then do a vinegar wash - then rinse very well - i would recommend a whole wash cycle w/no soap (like 2 rinses)<br>  <br>  to strip:  hot water wash no soap, hot water wash w/about 2 tablespoons of dawn, hot water wash no soap, another hot water wash w/no soap - to make sure all of the soap is out - <br>  <br>  vinegar wash: use hot water, nothing but vinegar (about 2-3 cups) let go through wash cycle - then do 2 more cycles for a really really good rinse - does not need to be hot water for the last 2 cycles - <br>  <br>  make sure all of the vinegar is out - as i had used too much vinegar/did not get it all out of my babes diapers and she got a yeast infection.....so do not think vinegar is not a sanitizer....IT IS!!|`|yYZTfwT8aa	When he goes & you change him, rinse the diaper immediately & drop in a big bucket with a mixture of vinegar & water.  Even if its just pee.  If its a dark yellow colour on the nappy then examine his intake: has he had enough water for example.  If its a solid go then rinse, & suds it up with a 'quik wash' leave the suds on before dropping into the vinegar & water bucket.  <br>  <br>  ** DISCLAIMER **  keep any deep bucket away from crawlers & tots.<br>   ( that's not for you Lexi that's for the twits who cant seem to understand that not everybody uses disposables) <br>  <br>  When you wash you might be tempted to over do the soap, don't.  Just use the recomended amount & rinse them very well.  If you are using a machine to wash; run the rinse cycle twice.  My mother used to powder the diapers after they were dry, before she folded them.  <br>  <br>  Also don't forget to soak the cover pants if you use them the elastic in the legging will hold an odor and not let it go!  <br>  <br>  In the states you can get a washing powder called Dreft.  It is awsome at removing that "milk" smell.  <br>  <br>  Dont use softener sheets in the dryer or in the rinse water it will inhibit the absorption of the cotton.  Put a pair of tennis balls or baby shoes in the dryer to beat the nappies soft.  This works I swear. <br>  <br>  If you line dry a good flap should soften them if it doesn't then there might be too much soap residue in the cloth.<br>  <br>  Good luck|`|Cx5Zo7IIaa	Wash with hottest water, using either bleach, vinegar or baking soda. If using bleach use an extra rinse cycle. Try soaking them in baking soda water first. On the side of the box it give instructs on how to get bottle to stop smelling like sour milk. (Walmart store brand boxes anyway), the same works for diapers just use a lot more.|`|WWdgyvU9aa	Make sure you're stripping your diapers on a regular basis (getting all the soap out of them). This can be done with a wash with dish detergent or with white vinegar. Also white vinegar added to the rinse will help get rid of any leftover smells.|`|pGvObBFtaa	What detergent are you using? I was using All free and clear and it was giving me the same problem on my BumGenius diapers. Be cautious using baking soda or vinegar on your diapers as suggested by some of the other answers because it may void the warranty on them. <br>  I fixed the problem by doing a cold wash with 1/4-1/2 the reccomended amount of detergent. Followed by a hot was with a Tbsp of Dawn, then I ran them through another full wash cycle with no detergent.<br>  <br>  Good luck.|`|2451MT2Haa	I agree with the answerer above about the soap residue on the cloth. I would also try sunning them outside if you can catch some sun around this time of year. I wouldnt listen to those who are telling you to rid yourself of cloth diapers, and of coarse dont put any perfume on them, but im sure you werent going to anyway.|`|TJ4q7X8Vaa	I had the same problem when I was using Dreft. I started making my own laundry detergent with a bar of Fels-Naptha soap grated and melted in water on low heat. I put that in a 5 gallon bucket with a cup of borax and a cup of arm and hammer super washing soda(not baking soda) and filled the bucket to the top with water. It gels so shake your container before each use. I soak my diapers for at least fifteen minutes on hot with soap, drain, then wash on hot with soap. If you still have a smell add a half a cup of white vinegar to the rinse cycle. If that still doesn't get it dry your diapers in the sun. You can also soak your diapers all the time in water with borax but I'm not a fan of that because its dangerous in the baby's room and its a pain to take it to the laundry room each time.|`|91d66f827b42a4381e0eeb57b05439f5aa	its likely there is some soap still in the diapers, it will make them smell awful. add a second (or third) rinse, add a 1/2 cup of white vinegar to the rinse as well.|`|5WP9rLTlaa	Cloth diapers are not more work than disposables!<br>  <br>  Where I am it is illegal to dispose of faeces in the rubbish so you still need to take a disposable to the toilet to flush out the waste, then you have to take it to the bin. clth diapers you just drop in the bucket and when you have a full load you throw them in the machine- five minutes work, big deal!<br>  <br>  If you use fabric softeners it can make them stink, also some brands react to vinegar and bicarb causing them to stink. also using the wrong amount or wrong brand can make them stink.<br>  If line drying in the sun isn't an option try stripping them again or contact the maufacturer who can advise on what the best solution could be. Make sure they are completely dry before putting them away too, I found storing damp diapers makes them stink more.|`|OI3bf4yjaa	Use bleach. I had that problem at first too, but I used bleach and they didn't smell like that anymore. Make sure you use another rinse cycle.

D35xKICoaa	100% chance  with unprotected sex.|`|AA11785285	You poor sweetie.    You are another victim of the Bush Administration making goddamn sure you did not know how to protect yourself from a pregnancy... it makes no difference if the guy inserted 2 seconds or 12 minutes, an erected penis is filled with sperm and pre-ejaculate, and it takes one swimmer... just one.  And you didn't know that, did you???    The irregularities of your period are immaterial... women ovulate all over their cycle, sometimes twice.  Ova live up to 5 days, and sperm up to 10, and you could have a period once in 6 months, and still have ovulated 10 ova!!!!!!!!    Your chances of being pregnant are huge.    If carrying a child is not on your agenda, you have the following options    If insertion was less than 72 hours ago, you can go to any drugstore and buy Plan B.  If you are not 18, have a girl friend who is buy it for you, take as directed.  The cost is about $35.    If you wait approx 6 weeks past exposure, there will be almost usually enough of the pregnancy hormone for you to check to see if you are preg.  The cost is approx $10.  Some cost a bit more.  If you wish to terminate this it will cost you approx $350, either by using the abortion pill or a vacuum abortion, at any abortion clinic.    If you are not pregnant, bc pills are free at planned parenthood if you are under 18, and they won't even call your parents.    Google Planned Parenthood + your city for all their numbers.  They will talk to you... and Bush made sure you never knew about them either!!!!!|`|9iXGakohaa	The symptoms you described are symptoms not usually felt until much later in the pregnancy. Signs I noticed immediately when I was pregnancy were fatigue, and swollen/painful breasts and nipples. Vomiting won't usually occur until a few months in, and backaches not until the 2nd trimester.    Can you visit your obgyn for a blood test?|`|uFrqC4Y2aa	There's always a chance when you have unprotected sex even for 2 minutes.|`|4DoXomHZaa	Yes you can get a blood test.    Unprotected sex is unprotected sex. I'm sure you know what pre-ejaculate is and the fact it contains sperm.    Sticking it for a while before wrapping it is completely unsafe.    Your chances are pretty good considering you did the one act DESIGNED to make babies and did nothing to stop it.|`|AA11920812	They are free at Planned Parenthood.    Or, a dollar at the dollar store.  .|`|e0eb82b689e1db392eb51c89982ed115aa	even if its 2 seconds you have a chance. men pre-ejaculate and have lubricating liquids in the penis. They all carry some amount of sperm, that is why the pull out method never ever works. If you feel pregnant, act pregnant. Take all precautions. Call your doctor and tell them your problems with periods and you are not sure if you are or are not due to that fact. They can check your hormone levels for you.   My sister is an irregular ovulator, and has irregular periods. She didnt heed her symptoms and didnt even know she was pregnant till she was 5 months and started feeling her baby moving.|`|60a3bbdca78e74fb19db426e27b9a087aa	WAIT UNTIL YOU CAN GET A TEST. You can not get the answer here.    Unprotected sex, even if brief, can result in some fluid getting inside you, which means there is a chance, however small.    Get a test when you can.|`|OzM5P1TIaa	yes of course.  u can be pregnet.plz go and take ur test.  it is possible,  good luck

I thought the problem was me for a long time but it ended up being my husband. Good Luck and God Bless!!!|`|i6mydMOyaa	You do not have to wait for your period. My doctor gave me another medication that fooled the bod into inducing a period. It's not a true period because there was no egg to expell, but it makes your body shead the lining that built up for the egg, so it is just like a period. <br>  <br>  Then you take the Clomid while you are having this 'period'. <br>  <br>  Good luck, and baby dust!

To name a baby after a best friend and using a family sir name, can't be beat. I named my first child "Annie Laura Brittain."

wzXJOSIeaa	It normally takes a couple days for the sperm to travel to the egg, so it is a bit soon for implantation bleeding, unless her boyfriend has speedy gonzales sperm. Anything is possible, so she does need to take a test if her period doesn't come. If she's not pregnant, go with her to get birth control and condoms.|`|FlSCb3dxaa	yep, it sounds as if she might be pregnant.  If she gets her period every 28 days, she will ovulate 12-16 days...  So that means she can get pregnant about two weeks after her period..  If she don't want to have kids, she should have used a condom, birth control pill or the patch or something..    It is her own fault, but it sucks if you make a mistake in the middle of making love, but that happens.|`|Z1FdawAOaa	she probably is bleeding because she had sex. its too early to be bleeding from pregnancy.|`|YseGAHIfaa	to me, it sounds like implantation bleeding. tell her that all she can do is wait until she gets her period & if it doesn't come then do a test!     until then, it's the waiting game.    lots of luck to you & your sister  =)  x|`|hswTS1jVaa	She had sex Monday (yesterday?) and is bleeding today?  That's only one day after and too early for implantation bleeding.  It could just be a little blood from tearing or something during sex if it was very little.    Tell her to get on birth control and use a condom from now on.|`|d08rkYlpaa	It sounds to me like she could not have chosen a better timing to have sex if she wanted to get pregnant. We have 4 children - that bleeding sounds exactly like the implantation spotting I get. It is very likely that she is pregnant.  You can get an inexpensive pregnancy test at nearly any drug store that will work in a few days. They are usually more accurate after you miss your period.|`|5YYzUgf7aa	she needs to see a doctor
e0eb82b689e1db392eb51c89982ed115aa	I just asked this question!!! Well most answers and research states it can be up to 37 weeks before they turn, but they dont get concerned till 34 to 36 weeks. Then they watch it weekly, if it doesnt turn they may try to get it to turn, otherwise you may need a C-section. I am still waiting for mine to turn yet and she hasnt. My first turned by 33 weeks.|`|ZNhP3mpUaa	i'm not sure the Dr would be off by 5 weeks... but even if you are 32 weeks, the baby still has plenty of time to turn... search for "natural ways to turn a breech baby" and try a few. They must work with some to be suggesting them! My wife is 29 weeks and the baby is still breech. I'm not too worried!|`|ejHfqSD1aa	My baby was breech and 31 weeks and I was worried, But my doctor and everyone said she still had enough room to turn. i am now 34 weeks and she is head down. I think When you get to about 32-34 weeks and your baby still has not turned then I would worry.|`|c9bdef5bb31ceed680934e1e0696f061aa	The baby will flip around and if he doesnt then the doctor or midwife can flip him.|`|9fea2a31ad2061394c0ccf90e32f204baa	Babies at this stage are still unstable and may still move. My 3rd child went from being in position to being breech every 3 days right up until I had a c section at 38 weeks. In fact when they started to make the first cut she moved again and you could see my whole stomach role as she flipped over. There is a huge difference between 30 weeks and 35 weeks and I don't know how you could be that far off on your dates. Did you have an early ultra sound like in the first 8 weeks? If so that would be the accurate date as all babies at that stage are the same size but by the third trimester they can vary drastically in size that is why some babies born at 40 weeks weigh 7 lbs and some weigh 10.|`|AA10280194	A friend of mine just had a breech baby and they are both fine!!  She had to have her by c-section.  But, a few weeks before that decision was made the doctor tried to manually turn the baby (she said that hurt) and he also told her to put a bag of frozen vegetable on her tummy where the baby was because they do not like to be cold and will try to move away from the sensation and possibly turn her the right way.  Maybe you could give that a try.
AtVRWrwCaa	First off- I'm sorry to hear that you had to go through something like that. <br>  <br>  second- sadly there is almost nothing you can do about people touching you or looking at you. there are some people out there who just have no sense of personal space. for example- I'm 19 and I am 21 weeks pregnant. So I have a decent sized belly I'm sporting. I was grocery shopping and some lady grabbed my cart to stop me, and started rubbing my belly and asked me all sorts of questions like when are you due, and what are you naming it, boy or girl. I practically had to run her over to get her off of me!<br>  <br>  You can start wearing shirts that are a little too big or that have belly room in them for now, but once it becomes REALLY obvious- there's pretty much no stopping it.<br>  <br>  Or you know what would be good- If they touch your stomach, start rubbing theirs back and see how they like it lol<br>  <br>  Good luck hun!|`|b17cb0e70d1cd57271e4ba763c7fbc30aa	Well maybe you should have been smarter and more responsible and NOT gotten yourself pregnant at 16 in the first place. Then you wouldn't be dealing with any of this stuff...|`|WWcaKZ7Qaa	This is an issue a lot of pregnant women deal with, regardless of age. just tell them you are uncomfortable with being touched and ask them not to do it again. As for the stares, there's not much you can do about that. People are just curious. I'm 26 and get stared at too. Try to ignore it, that's the best you can do.|`|EkZDP3Oyaa	Firmly let them know that it isn't okay with you for them to be touching you.|`|1Ayb4UK7aa	Unfortunately you will probably just have to deal with people looking at your tummy.  As for someone touching your tummy, that is completely rude.  Next time someone does that, ask them how would they like it if someone just walked up to them and touched their body.  Or ask them what makes them think it is ok to touch another person.  They have no right to touch you at all without your permission.  I think it is even rude to ask to touch a pregnant woman's tummy.  <br>  Good luck and have a healthy, happy baby.|`|gHR4vlcDaa	Tell them NO! Have you took advantage of the pregnancy to gain weight, I can see how you can be really showing the baby is only  1/2in long an .3 ounces the size of a small lime!.... just wear bigger clothes to hide it...... no one new I was preg till 7months with #1 and didnt show a small bump until 5 months with number 2<br>  <br>  to !!!YO,lol how can you rip on a pregnant 16yr old when you cant even spell,lol your are the one who should be ashamed, obviously she is keeping it<br>  <br>  WEll thats even worse to hear and gonna give you more problems... And some how I dont really believe you now... I doubt a parent of a raped 16 year old would like her to keep the baby... their would be no point, especially when they give you the morning after pill in cases like this!|`|pWz8d8MBaa	wear sheat shirts and bigger clothes,, i doubt they would notce if they didnt know they just herd rumors aout it so when they look at you they totally say wow she does have a little belly,, if ur family has enoigh money i would highly suggest going to a pregnant teen school, ur with peopl the with same problem and they dont make fun of u, if u can afford it go to ur family now and ask serioulsly ur gonna wanna die in a few months if u stay at ur high school because u are going to get so much crap, so much. good luck and if u dont want to go make sure to have good friends to hold on to in ur time of need .|`|8ZSDt6SMaa	well, i may not be a big help. but i like helping people so hmm let me see.....<br>  <br>  well let them stare, jest deal with it, because everyone will stare, trust me everyone...im sure they dnt do it to be mean...<br>  <br>  and if you dont want anyone to touch ur tummy, just tell them "look. i feel uncomfotrable can you please not touch my stomach?" and be polite|`|J2gr1ogHaa	buy a shirt that say dont touch the belly...in different colors.

They'll get a clue REAL fast.<br>  <br>  Other than that, people are going to think it's okay.  For some reason there are people in this world who believe that a pregnant belly is public property--like the fact that it sticks out means it's okay to walk up and touch a stranger.  You're going to have to be firm and either tell the toucher that it is not okay, or reciprocate as mentioned above.<br>  <br>  Good luck, be strong.
Ff7mCzlPaa	Well, i wouldn't let my kids go over there for the simple reason that i wouldn't know whether there was adult supervision, considering you said they are always being left to fend for themselves.<br>  <br>  If your kids sass you, apply consequences (NOT threats) for their behavior.  Maybe they will think before they are sassy after a few punishments.|`|nPn1vP4laa	You need to have a talk with your brother/sister   ad tell them that you are not okay with their children's behavior.   You have to lay the law down (especially now) because this will only escalate.  My parents would have never accepted back talk from me or my cousins.  You are their family and can set the cousins straight as well.|`|jwGkGaiCaa	next time they come home with that attitude tell them if they don't knock it out they cant go back for X amount of days/weeks, and follow through. Maybe have the cousins come over to your house instead?|`|prqrQcd1aa	It sounds like you have the same thing going on that some mothers complain of their children when coming home from their fathers...or fathers complain of their children after coming home from their mothers... Different house different rules. They have to have that "down time" to get them re adjusted to what the rules actually are.. you are not alone!|`|WXCa8zQoaa	don't tolerate it when they come home make that clear with them|`|MhzlKnrWaa	Just talk to your sister or brother about it or tell your kid to stop and treat you with some respect.|`|3ULL37Koaa	Maybe you should talk to your kid's aunt...|`|rhPCJfeuaa	I have a similar situation.  I have a 5 1/2 yr old little girl and a 2 yr old little boy.  They only have one cousin.  She is 6.  Both my brother and my SIL work.  I am able to be a stay at home mom.  When school is off for whatever reason, I am happy to take my niece.  She has stayed with us anywhere from 2 nights to 2 weeks.  Unfortunately, our parenting differs greatly.  But, my niece has realized that her attitude doesn't fly down here and so she doesn't act up while with us.  the problem is that my brother and SIL have offered to take our little ones to give us a break.  she doesn't buckle her daughter tightly in the car, lets her jump all over the furniture and very high bed, has no bed time, and lets her eat crap.  They don't do this to be bad parents or because they are neglectful.  They just want to be best friends with their child and never cause her to be upset.  If they are that way with their own child, I worry about the safety of my two little ones.  so far, by children are too little to stay away over an hour away overnight without me getting a call at 2 AM.  they won't even go downstairs to play without mommy or daddy being there with them.  but, the day is quickly approaching where I will either allow them to go and pray they are safe, or risk hurting my family.  They know I am strict and they know I worry, so I think it will be ok when my kids are a bit older and can do what they know I expect from them.  Maybe you need to wait longer stretches between visits and/or do so when they exibit freshness after they come home.  Lay down the rules so that everyone is on the same page and stick to your plan.  If they love being with each other, they will fall in line.<br>  <br>  Just so everyone knows, jumping on beds is one of the leading causes of spinal injuries in young children.  It only takes one bad fall, so I know I have cause to worry.  I would hate myself if I let them go and they ended up hurting themselves in a serious way.|`|tqA9kxeqaa	I dont think there there would be more than ONE or TWO "why don't you" moments with my kids.<br>  they would be in big trouble.<br>  i know they probably love their cousins, I know I did, and I know mine do, but for it to get to that point where their cousins are just doing whatever the heck they want st bad behavior for them to learn and I would keep them away for a while, or jut be there when they are there.<br>  make it a point to be around so you can keep an eye on them
aWJjhoz1aa	Yes it is possible, but not that healthy.<br>  She proboblly has alot of strechmarks from the major growth spurt.<br>  But hey, thats puberty.|`|CCXyQ1B9aa	I went from a C cup to a E cup in one year!  Yeah i reckon its possible seeing as she is still growing at 14.|`|wWdMcbvGaa	She probally stuffed her bra or wore a major push up bra. I dont think its possible but, im no doctor.|`|NSXGQBkAaa	I don't know about possible, but very unlikely.|`|mfBkH3qtaa	It's possible. If she did she probably has MAJOR stretch marks. And that kind of growth spurt would suck!|`|oYmZUO8Caa	It's possible. She could have gotten her period, gone through a  growth spurt, etc. It's not all that uncommon, but it's not exactly common - if you get what I mean, haha.|`|V6EgDitqaa	I highly doubt it, but it's possible. You<br>  never know what puberty does to a girl. <br>  If she did grow from an A to a D, she must<br>  have some massive stretchmarks from<br>  the fast growth.|`|zETO5Kv1aa	i guess its possible but i doubt it happened|`|N2KmE3rVaa	yeah. I went from sports bras 2 a 34B in like 11 months, and im still growing...
ot0TqzSvaa	Yes.<br>  and i like that their nicknames could be Toby for Tobias and Anna or Belle for Annabel.<br>  Awesome names and they certainly go with the other two.<br>  ps-i love Lucas Ephraim!! :D|`|iKLdGe1xaa	I love Tobias, not so keen on Alexander but the two names flow well. Annabel Jane is quite classic I like the spelling of Anabelle better.|`|UbCzA2JVaa	Yes they sound wonderful with your childrens names! What would you call them? Toby and Anna? Or Toby and Bel(le)?

hlKgd5Xoaa	Something that a friend did for my youngest was exciting for me, but pretty boring to the little one, was a savings bond.  She also gave her a beach towel and ball to entertain her, but spent the focus of her money on the bond.  Nice thing to tuck away for when they are older.<br>  <br>  Something else that my kids liked, which amazed me, was a small picture frame that has the recorded message ability.  The kids grandparents are far away, and they were able to tape a short message saying "this is grandma and grandma and "kids name" we love you.

PxawVQ7Xaa	Would it be ok for some one to hit you because they don't like the way you act? Back when spanking was legal it was also legal to hit our wives and beat black people, still want to go back to the good old days?<br>  <br>  If super nanny is "piece of crap" then why does it work, have you ever actually watched the show, because all the children a far better behaved by the end of the show.|`|SlBsJ3NRaa	I spank when I need to, not often or in anger. And I let them know they are loved and why they got it when it happens.<br>  <br>   But I see where the anti-spankers are coming from. Would anyone allow their spouse to put them over their knee for not listening? I highly doubt it. So since kids are people, too, they should have the same respect as adults.|`|B9KwqnuDaa	Because it is wrong and I have more respect for my children then to spank them.|`|prqrQcd1aa	I agree that it will work for some kids, but i know from experience that it does not work with all kids. I neither condemn nor condone spanking. I say to each his own, because they know what is good for their child and I know what is good for mine.|`|rhPCJfeuaa	I agree.  Life isn't black and white, and I just don't understand this deep need to jump to the word abuse when a spanking has been meted out.  It's so extreme.|`|jvW3a5GYaa	Agree 100%|`|jR8mclWIaa	Sounds like you got spanked more than once.  So you didn't reall y learn after the first time?|`|HkEAPJ6Waa	When I was a kid and got hit it didn't make me want to do the right thing... it just hurt and made me angry. It was unpleasant so, sure, I avoided doing the wrong thing, but I'm still battling a violent temper as a result.<br>  Kids need guidance, not violence.<br>  They need direction more than discipline.<br>  Compassion over aggression.<br>  We strike saying it will teach knowing somewhere deep inside that it's only 'cause we are angry and want to express that anger.<br>  Doing the wrong thing has natural consequences... it's how we learn as adults, it's how we should be able to learn as children.|`|qTVkydt1aa	Because I've read so much about child abuse it has been implanted into my brain that children are not your object to vent your anger to physically.<br>  <br>  When I was young I was explained right from wrong and punished in ways that did not include hitting.  Guess what?  I'm fine.  And I knew right then and there not to do it again.<br>  <br>  What gets a parent to the point that they feel the need to use hitting to control their child?  Why does a child have to pay for a parent's mistake?|`|bdWO9wSAaa	Actually, when my parents spanked me, I began to resent them and become more rebellious =)<br>  <br>  I don't do what they believe is right and wrong, I use my own sense. And spanking just made me less respectful towards them, and more concentrated on what I wanted.|`|CADfxb8waa	My parents used to spank me ,too. I used to learn pretty fast from that.I don't really think it's bad, just as long as your not like abusing the child.  A simple spank or send to your bedroom is good enough. I don't have children- actually I am one- but it always worked for me.|`|rwrDD14Jaa	why would you spank your child if you could just talk to them or ground them, I personally don't believe that spanking is more effective in disciplining children.|`|6VjHsMq7aa	I agree, sometimes actions speak louder than words.|`|692c8795f68a0ba95a0d09139d70c98caa	Agree.  People these days are just too damn judgmental, there is a difference between beating and spanking.   <br>  <br>  Its human nature to punish a child by using a form of force.  Animals nip their young.. well we are humane so we cant bite our children, therefor we give em a little swat on the butt.  <br>  <br>  If animals didn't bite or snap at their young they would be running all over the place,  wild.  Just like the children who have parents that dont give their children a quick smack on the butt.<br>  <br>  I dont think spanking an older child is ok though, by this time their grown enough to understand and be taught to listen in other ways, like taking away items or grounded.<br>  <br>  *** My aunt didnt believe in spanking, my parents did...<br>  <br>  My brother never did drugs, and is currently in college <br>  My cousin who never got spanked, got into drugs at the age of 13 and is currently in prison for grand theft auto and possesion of drugs.|`|2451MT2Haa	I personally havent had to spank. Time outs and positive rienforcement has worked so far. I havent gotten to the point where i have had to spank. I was a child who was spanked. There were times when a simple NO would have sufficed. However i am not completely against a swat on the bottom, i just think the deed has to match the punishment. I try to make that last resort, and so far it has worked. But it could completely have something to do with the child's temperament. I dont like the idea of spanking, but i have seen children cussing hitting and screaming in the store with their parents, while the parents are simply saying "no you shouldnt do that" and i think to myself about what my mom would do in that situation.|`|bYaxOfWOaa	I agree with PaydaPig, it all depends on the child. I got a smack on the hand when I was very little, after about 3 or 4 I was just told off. The embarrassment of being chastised in front of my brothers/neighbours/friends was a huge deterrent. <br>  I've noticed with my 18 month old niece, once she started walking and was able to reach things she wasn't allowed, if telling her 'No' didn't work, she got a soft smack on the hand. No she's a bit older and more able to understand, we say 'ooh-ahh, that wasn't nice/good' and she gets embarrassed, and stops doing it. <br>  Not that I'm suggesting kids be humiliated! Lol but just a reminder that nobody likes that behaviour.|`|Qa1DoqdJaa	i honestly think it depends on the kid. I know some kids who you could spank them all day and they would continue to act out. Yet the second you take away their video game, they listen. I also know kids who don't care if they sit in time out all day, they learn nothing. Yet a spanking works. It really depends on the kid. I think those shows don't want you to spank because it does send a msg to kids to hit when thye think someone is doing something wrong to them. I personally got spanked when i was a kid. Grounding never worked for me.|`|Zk4BqRnNaa	Committing violence on children makes them violent. Not all spanked kids take it queitly. Some hurt other kids or animals. Spanked kids can grow up without self-esteem. Spank the kid for a quick fix ("discipline") and they carry that abuse with them for a lifetime.|`|8hsEPGgHaa	People think it's bad because most people do it out of rage and frustration rather than punishment. Some people get carried away and get into abuse fields.<br>  <br>  And some people forget there are other means of punishment.<br>  <br>  I believe in spanking but it's NOT the only punishment for kids and you can't do it just because your angry at them. They have to have done something legitimately bad.|`|AtVRWrwCaa	agree.<br>  <br>  but hitting anywhere else on the body besides the butt i think would be wrong|`|Uo6yM6bBaa	Hitting is much worse than spanking.|`|sp1x3ZUAaa	Children are people, with thoughts, feelings, personalities, and memories.<br>  They all have different personalities and traits and what may work on one child may screw up another, or be unaffective.<br>  When I got spanked (which only happened a few times, my parents stopped doing it fast and now dislike it), my reaction varied... I would bawl my eyes out, or hit them back, or be completely silent.<br>  But, I do not think it is good...<br>  It can just lead to more problems.<br>  And you gotta remember - your idea of right may be considered wrongs in other peoples eyes, and vice versa... so no one is really right or wrong.
d0745208e8d9260952c0f551139d1d27aa	yeah sorry to tell you but there is a chance.  best to go take a test.  just because you used a condom does not mean you cant get pregnant then.  my wife and I have 3 kids 2 of which are proof of that.  and usually if you had a period about 7 days or so after is when you are ovulating so if you had sex about a week after give or take a couple days and usually you ovulate for a week or so then you could be.<br>  <br>  <br>  have you been 5 days late or more before too.  you can wait a week or so.  and then take a test.  i am sure you can even take one now to make sure as well.<br>  <br>  also i hear you should wait a couple weeks because then it will more then likely show up. i know people who got neg at first and even a week after there period was late and a couple weeks later all of a sudden pos.  also take the test first thing in the morning.|`|rsAqrbsgaa	yep|`|9x7yp67Naa	Was ityour first time ?! <br>  Wait always2 week to  take an accurate. Prego test .. Before I got pregnant we tryed for 9 months and sometimes my period was late forva complete month ... Everytime you have sex go ahead and check the condom tie it on the. Top and check the tip so that is not broken and there's no leaking don't be ashame gross out or feel weird is your body and your life is better to be Safe than sorry .. And if the condom is broken get the plan B pill ASAP !!! It works ..|`|V7sfV5odaa	Were you ovulating when you had Sex? If You were than, Yes you can be PREGNANT!|`|x2Ypvl3kaa	You could be. Take a test to be sure.|`|vFBOFecQaa	Unfortunately abstinence is the only fool-proof way to keep yourself from getting pregnant.  I know it sounds old-fashioned and motherly but it is very true.  Birth control does help decrease your chances, but as people have pointed out they are never 100% effective.  Condoms can have microscopic tears or can rip.  It is a possibility that you might just be late, but if you are NEVER late you might want to invest in a pregnancy test.  Don't waste your money on the digital read out ones, I've heard they are less likely to show a (+) than the old fashioned type with the +/- and a control window.<br>  <br>  I'm a stickler to the birth control being only "x %" effective because about a month ago my husband and I just found out that I'm expecting and I've been on the pill for 2 years now.  Take it at the same time, no antibiotics, you get the point.  So there's always the possibility.<br>  <br>  As a side note, I just read your update.  If this was your first time having sex bleeding afterwards is very normal.  There is another thing called "Implantation bleeding" that occurs later.  If you are travelling stress can influence your cycle, as well as the pheromones produced by other women.  A group of women will eventually all end up on the same cycle if living together in close quarters, so if you are around some new females this is a possibility.<br>  <br>  Edit:  My sister who is a cheapskate has used everything on the market and says that generics are just as good as the namebrand.  I used EPT (without the digital display) and bought the 2 pack just so that I could have one extra if I wanted to make sure.  <br>  <br>  As for options for pregnancy it depends on how far along you are.  A pill only works so far and after that it must be an abortion.  I'm not a big advocate of either so I've never really done my research.  Perhaps Planned Parenthood would be helpful?|`|8jfeiUQQaa	Well I spent 2 weeks in another country and I was supposed to get my period but I didn't. My period was exactly 2 weeks late.

That and something that isn't in blue!|`|842e7245d92a9eaaf5883492a9c11008aa	i know there's not many outfits for boys at most stores like there is for girls. but, the baby place store in our mall has really cute ones and the gymboree store. also, gap kids store and jcpenney's.|`|XRLbqtUbaa	I'm with u...I hated that when I had my son. :)<br>  <br>  Try Old Navy or The Children's Place.  Toys R Us or Babies R Us...and my favorite...Baby Depot in Burlington Coat Factory.|`|692c8795f68a0ba95a0d09139d70c98caa	Ugh i remember that.. i always felt like there was not enough cute baby boy clothes, there was always sooo much girl stuff and minimal boy stuff.  I went into Old Navy yesterday and they did happen to have alot of really cute boy outfits, a bunch of really nice infant boy sweaters and vests with matching hats.. i was actually surprised at all they had :)     I don't have to worry about that anymore though i had a girl this time around :)|`|jYPeis3Saa	i have an almost 16 month old boy, and it is so hard to find clothes period! <br>  <br>  the clothes celeb's put on their children are designer which means you'll either have to go to a designer baby boutique or shop on line. <br>  <br>  ive managed to find cute baby boy clothing at a Carter's store near my house. they can be pricey, but if you go when they have sales you always get great deals. also check out JC Penney. ive found cute boy clothes there. I just bought my son his whole summer wardrobe from Carter's and JC penney<br>  <br>  <br>  i do know your frustrations though when you walk into a store and see racks and racks of adorable baby girl clothes. We're hoping the next baby will be a girl so we can take advantage of all those cute clothes!|`|68d8ad07f5b8eb2e788d4d05c809eeeaaa	While it's still possible to find cute boys clothes for 0-3 months, wait until you will look for 1 year and up. Why in the world manufacture are thinking that I want put my adorable 1 year old baby in dark grey, black, dark blue and military colored clothes!!!!!! I am sick of monsters, trucks, spiders, and other weird creatures.<br>  But try Carter's, Pumpkin Patch, Children's Place. Lullaby clothes collections are in generally great for small baby boys too bad they only make them up to 9 months old.|`|wmc7uHLIaa	My sister-in-law always finds the cutest baby clothes.  She shops online at a place called Psycho Baby.  I would check that place out.

QUIZ:<br>  Sex, are you ready?<br>   <br>  DEFINITIONS <br>  <br>  Virgin:<br>  <br>  Main Entry: 1vir·gin<br>  Pronunciation: 'v&r-j&n<br>  Function: noun<br>  : a person who has not had sexual intercourse<br>  - vir·gin·al /'v&r-j&n-&l,'v&rj-n&l/ adjective<br>  - vir·gin·al·ly /-E/ adverb <br>  <br>  Sexual Intercourse:<br>  <br>  Main Entry: sexual intercourse<br>  Function: noun<br>  : sexual union especially involving penetration of the vagina by the penis <br>  <br>  It is an interesting question: what does it mean to lose your virginity?<br>  <br>  In the strictest term; you are a virgin until you've had sexual intercourse with the member of the opposite sex. But this definition leaves a lot of people out of the loop. While the social policy makers look to redefine marriage to include same sex partnerships, maybe it is time we also revisited what it means to be a virgin.<br>  <br>  When we think of virgins, we think of "white wedding innocents" who define sex as a synonym for gender. But the fact is, the standard definition of virginity lets you get away with having a lot of different kinds of sex was still being able to call yourself a virgin. In theory, under the traditional definition of virginity, someone who is homosexual can have sex every day and still be a virgin. Someone who has oral sex regularly is also still a virgin. Does that really make sense? Something is a miss!<br>  <br>  The whole narrow definition of virginity is in desperate need of a rewrite. Who better to do it than the first generation of new millennium teens? What does "losing your virginity" mean to you? Is it a state of mind or a specific act? Is it something that can be taken from you, or does it only count if you willingly give it away? When does "fooling around" end and "having sex" begin?<br>  <br>  When considering "the new definition", think about these situations and ask yourself how they fit in to the meaning of virginity.<br>  <br>  Is someone who is raped or molested no longer a virgin? <br>  Is actual intercourse the only act that counts when determining ones virginity? <br>  If you willingly engage in other intimate sexual acts but do not have intercourse, is it fair to still consider yourself a virgin? <br>  How would you define losing your virginity if you were/are homosexual or bisexual? <br>  Is being a virgin based on your feelings, what you do, or is it a combination of both? <br>  Is there an emotional component to losing your virginity, meaning if you have sex but don't feel anything is different about you, does it count? <br>  Is the current definition of virginity, and all the social stigma attached to it, biased toward girls? Is this right? <br>  Does the current definition of virginity exclude homosexuals? Is this right? <br>  Is virginity subjective (based on how the individual views themselves and what they do) or objective (how the situation is viewed by others on the outside)? <br>  Formulate a definition and then share it with others, let's see what we can come up with.<br>  <br>  I propose that virginity is twofold. I think there is an emotional virginity and a physical virginity. I think that to truly no longer be a virgin you must give up both the emotional attachment to your virginity and engage in physical acts of sex. In my "definition", any intimate sex act which involves nudity and stimulation with the goal of orgasm counts as sex. I think nudity and stimulation are the "points of no return", not penetration. Regardless of whether that act is heterosexual or homosexual in nature, if you share your body with another person, or if you give pleasure to another person that involves orgasm or intends to cause orgasm, you have had sex. I also feel that virginity is not something you "lose" or something that is "taken", but something you share with another person, like a rare chocolate or a once in a life time sunset. If you haven't given it, it doesn't completely count as being gone.<br>  <br>  I think that people who are raped and or molested are still virgins in the emotional sense even if their body has had sex. They have not stopped "being" a virgin, nor have they experienced the emotions that go along with giving ones body to another. If it is taken from you, although it may physically be sex, I don't think that it is fair to tell you you are no longer a virgin. You may still feel as if you have not had sex, you may still view sex with naivety. Being victimized should not force you to live with a label you neither wanted nor asked for. Virginity is not something we passively lose, non-virginity is something we deliberately choose to take.<br>  <br>  This is my personal view on the line between virginity and non-virginity. What's yours?|`|mfBkH3qtaa	What my mom said is that it depends on the girl but Yes it does hurt or is uncomfortable. And she said some girls bleed some don't. As you have sex more the more and more pleasurable it will be. A hymen is the "cherry" in the saying pop your cherry. And your "cherry popping" during sex is often the reason why you bleed.|`|J58bFKHDaa	its different for everyone. my first time was a week ago and it only hurt for the first 3 minutes and then it was good<br>  yes, the hymen is a layer of tissue that the guy breaks with his penis and thats what makes you bleed and the reason it hurts... but dont worry, not everyone bleeds and theres a possibility you could have broken it even before sex|`|EWFtQNSdaa	It depends.<br>  For me, it didnt hurt that much and I didnt bleed, but I know other people are different.<br>  <br>  EDIT - a hymen is the skin which needs to break to cause penetration, this is what hurts for most girls. Its often referred to as popping the cherry.|`|V6EgDitqaa	I'm still a virgin, but from what I heard, everyone's first time<br>  is different.

Anna Esseker is the name of the woman in Mirrors that gets possessed by the demons in the building near the end. If the child were mine, I would most likely think of that movie every day when I say her name, and it is one creepy movie.<br>  <br>  However, if you're extremely sure, I would go with Esseker Ann.

I love the name Isabella. I have a lot of ancestors from germany and they all anglicized their names when they came to America, but I still love the german names!|`|e4M4uQXNaa	No, because it's become such a widespread, popular name.  And while I can see where sometimes it's a bit weird for a kid to have a certain name if his/her parents come from a totally different place than the name (like an Irish kid with a Chinese name or something like that lol), there shouldn't be a rule of thumb not allowing that type of thing.  That just seems a bit racist lol.<br>  <br>  By the way, is your name really Jenna?  Because if you're going by your rule (and I hope you're not being superior and excluding yourself from your own rule lol), Jenna is an English name, or actually, comes from Jennifer which is a Welsh name.  Last time I checked, Italy is as far from the Wales as Ireland or Poland (alright, maybe Poland's a bit closer haha).|`|12bc27fa7b718990cbf3a82111b05148aa	I doubt most people even think about the fact that Isabella is Italian. Isabella has become so mainstream that it's just another name that people like, not an "Italian name." No so with Gianna, which apparently is popular mostly in Italian circles.|`|AA12343985	No I definitely don't think you need to be Italian to use the name Isabella.  We live in a global community now a days and names of any ethnicity can be used by anyone whomever wishes to use it.

4qqtc3dLaa	No, that just sounds like PMS. I bloat and gain weight during my period and I also get sore breast. Its went your breast start to get bigger and don't go down that you should get worried. And your just having a light period. I have had months where I have extremely light days, like you explain, out of a whole year of heavy periods. I don't think you need to worry so much.|`|yi3OvYRRaa	you can become pregnant during or after but if its been longer than a week and then you have it then no<br>  sperm takes time to fertilize the egg|`|7zMtmKJaaa	take a test when your period is/was supposed to come.<br>  <br>  it could be just premenstrual symptoms. ty not to worry so much or you will miss your period.|`|usRvTvSSaa	yes you can be every girl is different|`|Rbm99GOcaa	I know people who had their periods through their entire pregnancy... go take a pregnancy test or go to a doctor.............good luck dear!|`|qqaRqeQMaa	haha! your just trippin balls! and paranoid. id say you have nothing to worry about

WWcaKZ7Qaa	It depends on what part of your hips you are referring to. If the pain is on the side/back of your hips it is most likely sciatica, which is really common during pregnancy and has to due with the extra weight, pelvis shifting, etc. Sometimes that pain can be lessened by massage, chiropractic care, ice, stretching, etc. If the pain is more in your pubic symphysis area, then it is probably because the baby has "dropped" and is putting pressure on your nerves. Unfortunately, there's not much you can do about that one!<br>  <br>  Also, the abdominal hardening you are feeling probably is braxton-hicks. I've never found it to be particularly painful, but it is a bit uncomfortable and creates a lot of pressure.|`|bx6OKLIbaa	I am 33 weeks preg and suffering braxton hicks.They are painful sometimes and my dr told they are going to be strong an more painful by the time. i think u r suffering the same thing.
w5y4BTjkaa	First of all, CONGRATULATIONS! Best of luck to you! Anyway...<br>  <br>  Lily and Lila: BEAUTIFUL! They sound so pretty together and Lily sounds great on a baby girl! 9/10<br>  Tera and Tori: I really like Tera, but I'm not a big fan of Tori. Still, I think they sound great together. 7/10<br>  Natalie and Nora: GREAT choice! I think you should switch them though. Nora would sound better on a baby than a puppy (just an opinion). 8/10<br>  Annie and Anya: I LOVE these names. Again, I think you should swith them around. Anya is too beautiful of a name to not give to your daughter! 10/10<br>  <br>  Here are some suggestions as well!<br>  <br>  Daughter and Puppy:<br>     <br>  Rhiannon and Rhiannalyn (R-names)<br>  Lilly-Mae and Pepper-Fae (rhyming)<br>  Elizabeth and Eloise (E-names)<br>  Teegan and Trinity (T-names)<br>  Trixie and Taryn (T-names)<br>  Melrose and Rosemary ('Rose' names)<br>  Rachal and Ryder (R-names)<br>  Nicolette and Nora (N-names)<br>  Ashlyn and Asher ('Ash' names)<br>  Rosemary and Kale (spices)<br>  Kale and Pepper (spices)<br>  Rose and Tigerlily (flowers)<br>  Faith and Hope (inspirational names)<br>  Graceland and Annagrace (Grace names)<br>  Brenlyn and Brenna ('Bren' names<br>  Jazmyn and Yazmyn (rhyming)<br>  Peyton and Paige (P-names)<br>  Tera and Kara (rhyming)<br>  Dallas and Dakota (city and state)<br>  Austyn and Anya (A-names)<br>  Summer and Autumn (seasons)<br>  Autumn and Summer (seasons)<br>  Danity and Danika ('Dan' names)<br>   <br>  I hope I helped and good luck with your baby girl! ...and your puppy! <br>  <br>  Always,<br>  (-:Tabbykinz:-)|`|UbCzA2JVaa	Lily and Lila would be very cute!<br>  <br>  <br>  Good luck!   :)|`|ot0TqzSvaa	I like Lily and Lila, and Natalie And Nora.<br>  those are sweet names.<br>  i especially love the name Lily Mae for a little girl.<br>  <br>  good luck.|`|5dMw30kMaa	Hahaha when I first saw daughter and puppy I thought thats what you wanted to name them and I was like uhhhh? hahahaha but no I'm just illiterate hahah. I like Natalie and Nora. Although I kind of like Nora as the daughters name and Natalie as the dogs name, then you can call the puppy nat or natty. ahahah|`|Am54a7c0aa	I think you shouldn't name your child and your puppy too similar names as they may get a little confused. But I think Natalie and Nora sound nice and aren't too similar.<br>  <br>  Best Wishes!|`|KTU1oa9Gaa	Lilly and Tori for the puppy??|`|uqzK3UBWaa	I like LIly and Lila|`|6CsdiJMLaa	Wow your life is going to be busy!<br>  Personally and respectfully I don't think people should give their dogs "human" names. However that's just me. I say Natalie and Nora, they are the least similar so when Natalie and Nora are old enough to get into trouble and you want to discipline one you won't call your puppy "Natalie! stop that barking!".|`|Fwm6lHmpaa	Natalie Nora|`|7XIWtNr6aa	That's a little weird. But I'd have to say Natalie and Nora|`|7W26Njtgaa	That's an adorable idea!<br>  <br>  I like Lily (daughter) and Lila (puppy) the best.<br>  <br>  Personally, I love human names on pet.

That being said I like Natalie and Nora. <br>  <br>  Also consider:<br>  <br>  Daughter    Puppy<br>  Gianna and Jade <br>  Lilly and Lauren <br>  Terra and Tegan <br>  Maya and Megan<br>  <br>  <br>  And, of course, you can them around if you'd rather the dog have the name I assigned to the baby. I was just thinking of names I wasn't reallyconsidering babies and dogs.|`|69egf8V6aa	Natalie<br>  Norah|`|8ZSDt6SMaa	aw that is cute<br>  <br>  well i really think the 1st choices "lilly and lila" are really pretty<br>  <br>  you can also use a baby name book =)|`|UqazIKVlaa	Lily Lila

dZFJ2ZUcaa	Yeah, I totally agree with you! It should be his decision and not hers! She should wait and if he wants to get it pierced when he is older then she could let him. You never know he could later hate her for that.|`|XqEmwUgzaa	There is definitely no reason to pierce a 7-month-old boy's ear.  That's for him to decide to do when he is much much older.  She just sounds young and immature, hopefully she'll learn soon.  Maybe she looks up to you, try to sit down and talk to her without sounding judgmental.|`|g9vw4ovGaa	I agree, that sounds stupid. I have a baby girl and I won't peirce her ears. But it's not your baby, so all you can do is sit back and watch the distruction!|`|irHF6CBPaa	I think your niece needs to grow up and be more mature I definitely think it was S**** to get a baby boy a pierce ear and your niece is an Idiot sorry but you ask what we think|`|alssEcoKaa	Stop being sexist LaWanda!|`|aJLx0nhNaa	This gets debated frequently.  Personally, I would never pierce a baby's ears.  But there are much, much worse things that people do to their children every day.  If that's the worst thing that she ever does to him, I think he'll be fine.<br>  <br>  Save your anger for something more serious.|`|7rCeCVl2aa	How old is your niece because that was a really immature thing to do.<br>  <br>  1 earring with guys is so 80's anyway.|`|ME62Mtv4aa	Well the fact of the ears being peirced on a baby boy is kinda weird and that is a choice that should be left up to him. Girls I can see because 9 times out of 10 they will have wanted to have it done anyway when they get older but on a boy that's just not right to take that choice from him.|`|E2UXN7J1aa	I hate when babies have their ears pierced. Isn't she scared it could get infected or he could tug at it and hurt the area? My sister did the same thing to her boys and ended up taking the piercing out not longer after getting it done, because they all got so infected from the baby pulling at it.|`|qcjAg3yOaa	wow did u say he'll have it hard growing up as a black man?? And hows that??? hmm??<br>  <br>  yeah I wouldnt pierce my sons ear but some parents do it.. <br>  I dont even try making sense of it. Or making sense of that comment you made.<br>  <br>  As for that.. You're not hispanic, white, or asian ect. so you couldnt understand either. Your making it about race or color when it is not about that. EVERYONE has hard times. Doesnt matter what color you are. Seriously, get off your soap box.|`|IGcS9K62aa	I don't like it either, but unfortunately he's her child and not yours. So she gets to make that decision. Be a good Aunt to him because it looks like he is going to need it!
eKbWhBqIaa	thats good|`|bIaywrBCaa	I like Josh Corbin(spelled with an i). Lila Rose is pretty for a girl or Lila Jayne|`|B2bDFFolaa	Anytime I hear the name Corban, it makes me think of the guy from High School Musical...which I don't really care for that movie. <br>  <br>  Lila is pretty though. The first name that comes to mind as a middle name would be Marie, Lila Marie... <br>  <br>  Have you considered other important family member names? Or Obscure family names that have not been passed down? My middle name is Ruby, after my grandmother whose first name was Eunice.. Ruby is much more preferable to Eunice..|`|oYmZUO8Caa	I don't think she should name it after the boyfriend... just my opinion. I'm not a fan of "legacy" names. <br>  <br>  Lila, on the other hand, is very cute. But does she want to honor her counselor for the rest of her life? There are other ways to honor her.. so that is what it comes down to.|`|1umOKLqoaa	I think it's very nice she want's to name the child after someone. And I'm glad that you want to keep the baby. How about Lila Angelica? Or Josh Jacob?  Hope I helped!|`|AA11922229	A boy,  then name him Earl    for early bird<br>  <br>  A girl , then name her Angel   for a gift from heaven|`|iKLdGe1xaa	Lovely boys name. Lila Rose, Lila Mae (keep the middle name short). Rosalie is a nice name same with Tori|`|Rbm99GOcaa	I would tell her if she wanted to keep the name Josh to use Joshua just so he has the option of what he wants to be called. I like the middle name Corban...but she should think about if there is someone else in her family she wants to name him after ( like her father or grandfather) And does she want her boyfriend and her son to be named the same name.... it might get confusing....maybe a middle name be josh?<br>  <br>  a girl I love the name Lila. It is my middle name Lila-Dawn.|`|01db5aa7210b357f39d8476ce3db673faa	i like the first names middle for lila how about lila marie and for Josh how about josh mathew|`|2LCFbUORaa	Joshua Hayden<br>  Joshua Tyler<br>  Joshua Cameron<br>  <br>  Lila Gabrielle<br>  Lilanne Mckenna<br>  Lila Rhianne|`|OQ84rqQ0aa	Lila Danielle is a pretty name..

I like the name alice if its a girl it means noble, strong, and wise and as a middle name either michelle or morgan. michelle means who is like the lord and morgan means great and bright. i hope this was helpful!|`|PFPvvHEgaa	I think if it's male, name it Destery.<br>  And if it's female, name it Alice.<br>  Alice is seriously the most beautiful girl name in the world.|`|KzCgN7Mfaa	i really love the name "Winsome"<br>  it means "charming&beautiful"<br>  <br>  its so cute. my friend gets called winnie and pooh bear like winnie the pooh! <br>  <br>  also i love henrietta|`|eihluAxMaa	o my gosh i luv the name lila and maybe 4 the middle name grace alexis mallory katelyn or hope faith or joy hope this helps and hope there is no complications in her pregnancy|`|w6jgKy2laa	I Like Rosalie Camrin, Lila Nicole, and Josh Peter, or Josh Corban|`|sXpGfHWWaa	I love the names:<br>  <br>  Aurdina ( girl)<br>  Nikki ( girl or boy, but if a boy, nick) <br>  Riley ( unisex)|`|YeUjmP7Uaa	i like the name Zhara or Suri or Shiloh or taylor or sabrina....i love the name abi<br>  <br>  for guys i like Davis and Taylor or chase....alex?|`|D6Xfc5Wtaa	Lila Ann<br>  Lila Marie<br>  <br>  Josh Cole<br>  Josh Alan|`|bFu2qQEvaa	I really like the name Josh (my little boys name) but I think she should go with Joshua so he can choose when he gets older what he wants to go by, and unfortunately I was subjected by my niece to High School Musical and that's what I think of. So I'm not a fan of it, but if she really likes the name I'd say go for it. Other middle names could be after someone, father, grandfather, uncle. Other wise I like Hunter or Ryan. I adore the name Lila. I think Elizabeth or Grace would sound very good with it. <br>  <br>  Hope she finds a name she likes, best of luck, and congrats even if its not the best timing.
qMI6H6Lbaa	That is a question for your doctor. we can answer general past experience questions but when it comes to the health of you or your unborn child you should really talk to your doctor about that. none of these un educated people on here can tell you advice about something that would be that serious|`|L1qNhDMzaa	I think that the best thing for you to do is to stay calm and to call and set up an immediate appointment with your OBGYN. Or the doctor that wants you to have the hysterectomy. Until that appointment, you could always check in to the ER and just get checked out to make sure that everything is ok with you and the baby to be. That way you can ease your nerves. Good luck.
hnICmxMoaa	"I told him to stop, but only once and quietly"<br>  if you truly didn't wanted to do it you would have been kicking and screaming...why didn't you stick up with what you wanted?|`|5tqh0akYaa	It was rape if it was unwilling. That is messed up , he is going to do it again, you shouldnt enjoy rape. leave that perv|`|RvSHQtrXaa	That is certainly not being raped.  Being raped is an abuse.  You sit with your boyfriend in an intimate mood, this was not forced, as you end up liking the mood.  <br>  <br>  You soon might need a pregnancy test.  I did hear if a condom was used.|`|d9d7dbffacb9c5256ef7afd69e6023b6aa	Yes it is. At the very least it was "Date Rape".<br>  <br>  If you had wanted to at first and then changed your mind, and he didn't quit, it would be rape, right? <br>  <br>  Just because it felt good after a while, doesn't mean he didn't do "inappropriate touching" and him causing you to have sex when you didn't want to makes it clearly rape. <br>  <br>  He might feel bad, or he might think he has a right to sex with you whenever he wants because you had sex already.<br>  <br>  Depending on where you live, you are probably under the 'age of consent' which means that someone can't have sex without it being a crime (child molestation or child rape). <br>  <br>  If you were 16, then you probably would be "of the age of consent" which would make it legal for an 18 year old to have sex with you, but not a 40 year old. <br>  For that (yuck) you'd have to be 18 or older.|`|SxgOy9uPaa	Sure sounds like rape to me..Your only 14,he shouldn't be looking to play, hide the salami any way..He to young for the consequences of his actions..Guess from the sound of your question this was your first time..If you hurt & bled a lot,take a trip to your DR,just to be sure there's no tear's or rips,internally..IF you got punchy with this he go for statutory rape..not good @ his age..Make it work for you..Good luck,stay well..|`|NSXGQBkAaa	You said no, so it was rape.|`|OLy54IDOaa	say it loud. push him off. and leave. call some body.|`|Q4sgYeMLaa	I mean it started off as being rape.

IXBl5l5kaa	I will compare with breast pump parts since we use drop-in bottles. I use my pump 4 nights per week 2 times per night. I always wash them in warm/hot soapy water after use. I will sterilize them in a microwave steam bag about every 2 weeks. <br>  <br>  Once bottles are washed/sterilized they should be ok for a while. I would only rewash them before use if they sat in the cabinet or laying out on the drying rack for a few days, otherwise I would not worry too terribly much about any 3 hour rule. <br>  <br>  If you are concerned about cleaning bottles while away from home and you do not have water/soap available you can go to the bottle/breast pump isle of Target and buy a pouch of Medela brand sterilizer wipes. I had to buy them when we had the ice storm a couple weeks ago and we were under a boil water advisory... couldn't boil water at work lol.|`|IGcS9K62aa	I wash my bottles. Then sterilize, assemble (nipple, cap, and all) and store.  I'm using a microwave sterilizer. I figure since they're sealed up... nothing can get in right? I open them up and use as needed.<br>  <br>  I haven't had any problems!|`|gHR4vlcDaa	well the sterilizing thing was more popular in the olden days, babies are fine with luke warm formula with tap water and a clean washed bottle....... unless your h20 is bad the baby does not need to be sheltered from from a normal washed bottle or tap h20 it will only create more problems later.... But if it makes you feel better do it! keep them in a tupperware container if it scares you, than nothing can get to them!|`|MMj7YcXkaa	running them through a dish washer is good enough. or just plain washing them in soapy warm water. I believe that sterilizing bottles is a thing of the past.  If there are any "germs" on or in the bottle or parts of it, then your baby will get them in their system and create antibodies.  Everyone nowadays is so germaphobic that they forget that some bacteria and germs are essential to normal healthy life!|`|dpig5odPaa	After sterilizing them put them together then put a cap on them. They will stay safe until you use them.|`|Sd8Chp9Jaa	I've been reading all the instructions and they all differ I would find the booklet for the one you have.
EsRuOno1aa	I think your suppose to wait until you miss your period, but there are pregancy tests that can determine pregnancy like 5 day before you miss your period. If you're so worried then you should opt for the morning after pill. I think you have to take it within 72 hours after having sex and the sooner the better.|`|JP2h62qiaa	Um, there is no way you would test positive right now. Relax, and use protection next time so you won't stress yourself out and worry. You can test 5 days before your missed period, but the hormone Hcg may not be high enough to be detected. I would wait until you have missed your period by one week. Good luck|`|IA5zVfk0aa	about 2 weeks :) good luck|`|HxXduL1maa	False negative readings can occur when testing is done too early. Quantitative blood tests and the most sensitive urine tests usually detect hCG shortly after implantation, which can occur anywhere from 6 to 12 days after ovulation. Less sensitive urine tests and qualitative blood tests may not detect pregnancy until three or four days after implantation. Menstruation occurs on average 14 days after ovulation, so the likelihood of a false negative is low once a menstrual period is late.<br>  <br>  Ovulation may not occur at a predictable time in the menstrual cycle, however. A number of factors may cause an unexpectedly early or late ovulation, even for women with a history of regular menstrual cycles. Using ovulation predictor kits (OPKs), or charting the fertility signs of cervical mucus or basal body temperature give a more accurate idea of when to test than day-counting alone.<br>  <br>  The accuracy of a pregnancy test is most closely related to the day of ovulation, not of the act of intercourse or insemination that caused the pregnancy. It is normal for sperm to live up to five days in the fallopian tubes, waiting for ovulation to occur. It could take up to twelve further days for implantation to occur, meaning even the most sensitive pregnancy tests may give false negatives up to seventeen days after the act that caused the pregnancy. Because some home pregnancy tests have high hCG detection thresholds (up to 100 mIU/mL), it may take an additional three or four days for hCG to rise to levels detectable by these tests — meaning false negatives may occur up to three weeks after the act of intercourse or insemination that causes pregnancy.<br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  False positive test results may occur for several reasons. These include: errors of test application, use of drugs containing the assay molecule, and non-pregnant production of the assay molecule.<br>  <br>  Spurious evaporation lines may appear on many home pregnancy tests if read after the suggested 3–5 minute window or reaction time, independent of an actual pregnancy. False positives may also appear on tests used past their expiration date.<br>  <br>  A woman who has been given an hCG injection as part of infertility treatment will test positive on pregnancy tests that assay hCG, regardless of her actual pregnancy status. However, some infertility drugs (e.g., clomid) do not contain the hCG hormone.<br>  <br>  Some diseases of the liver, cancers, and other medical conditions may produce elevated hCG and thus cause a false positive pregnancy test. These include choriocarcinoma and other germ cell tumors, IgA deficiencies, heterophile antibodies, enterocystoplasties, gestational trophoblastic diseases (GTD), and gestational trophoblastic neoplasms (GTN)|`|qMI6H6Lbaa	they say you can take a test 11-14 days after but i didnt get a positive test until 16 days after|`|MHeOHOnbaa	anywhere from 3 to 4 weeks and you sound paranoid|`|F83M10rlaa	You should either wait til you miss your period. or wait at least 6 weeks
bkOn30I1aa	Yes, I actually watched a whole show on Discovery Health about 4 women that were pregnant and did not know about it untill they were in the hospital, delivering the baby. Some of them took several pregnancy test and they came back negative, they did not gained weight and they did not get a big belly like most of us do. They were all pretty big women (not obese just big), so i am guessing that helped a little bit so the pregnancy wouldnt show. It is crazy and rare but it does happen :)|`|rx0ekB9Paa	i really dont see how this could be possible at all. the baby hits so hard, your nipples grow bigger and get alot darker. the hits alone would be a for sure sign. i dont see how anyone can be that unaware of their body,even if you are a heavier woman.|`|syrh8J6Vaa	Yes it is possible.  it is called denial.  I actually saw a 15 year old girl brought into the emergency room with stomach pains.  Her and her mother were shocked when they were informed she was about to have a baby.  In all honesty she was over weight and did not look pregnant.|`|qMI6H6Lbaa	the longest i have seen anyone go with out knowing they were pregnant was until they were 5 months and that was because they were very very over weight about 350 lbs or so . so they werent a average size person that could see the baby making a baby bump. she just around 6 months felt a movement and had no idea she was pregnant. but you will eventually feel your baby moving so it is just about impossible to not know . for the full 9 months. most people know by theh time they are 12 weeks just by seeing the changes in their body as far as sore boobs, sleeping all the time, smelling things differently, and for me i just felt stupid.  ( pregnancy brain make syou forget things that you would normally remember  lol)|`|c04e23e4eaa04f92efd3b65bfc6e28c8aa	yes, they can!<br>  my sister's friend was a bigger girl who was on the birth control shot. she had periods the whole pregnancy and never knew until she had really really bad cramps and went to the doctor who then told her she was 41 weeks pregnant and he was going to induce her labor the next day! pretty shocking.|`|Ot8lxaMEaa	I saw a TV show on this one time. its absolutely crazy but I guess some people are honestly that out of tune with their bodies (and overweight) that they don't notice. I wish my pregnancy had been that easy that I hadn't even noticed it...Jeez.

Irregular or abnormal ovulation and menstruation accounts for 30% to 40% of all cases of infertility. Irregularity, per se, is not necessarily a problem if you learn how to chart your fertility signs, especially cervical fluid, to determine when you are approaching your short window of fertility. But, if cycles are very long, it means by definition, that ovulation is not occurring as often as it would with a typical monthly cycle, a condition known clinically as anovulation.<br>  <br>  There are numerous factors that determine how fertile a woman is, such as her age, whether and how often she ovulates, whether her cervical fluid is wet enough to sustain sperm, whether her fallopian tubes are open, etc. But the most important of all is the release of the egg itself. If you don’t release an egg, meaning you don’t ovulate, you don’t have as many opportunities to get pregnant<br>  <br>  Women with irregular periods are often prescribed fertility drugs like Clomid to increase the number of ovulation periods. But if you would rather try a more natural approach, you might want to see a naturopathic doctor first to see if they can prescribe a less harsh treatment.<br>  <br>  Although anovulation can usually be treated with fertility drugs, it is important to rule out other conditions that could interfere with ovulation, such as liver disease, diabetes, problems with the ovaries, and abnormalities of the adrenal, pituitary, or thyroid glands, which produce important hormones.<br>  <br>  <br>  Hope it helps..<br>  <br>  Good Luck! x|`|kQMt51iraa	Progesterone actually works in too many ways:<br>  It helps in nourishing the fertilised egg.<br>  It help is reducing the risk of miscarriage.<br>  Stops unnecessary bleeding.<br>  Also helps in regulating periods.<br>  <br>  If you are not having regular periods doesn't mean you can't conceive. Its only abit hard. And you may at times need medical support for that. I have seen many ladies with irregular periods and now they are happy mothers.|`|gWiZAsfBaa	I have irregular periods, it is harder to conceive. You never know when you might ovulate, so you can't plan it out. It took my husband and I over a year of unprotected sex to conceive.|`|N89HLv92aa	It will just be harder. You should see your gyno. He will be able to explain it to you. Go ahead and start taking pernatal vitamins so your body will be ready for pregnancy.

JjBwydymaa	Hello hunni,<br>  <br>  when did you come off the pill??? Because It took me 9months to regulate again, however that is a long time and usually it take around 2-3 months!.<br>  <br>  I really understand your frustration...that was the exact way I was. I was going 4-5months with no period. It was a nightmare. and my Dr was useless....<br>  <br>  I would go to your doctors explain your situation...and see what they say. They probably will tell you to try naturally for 6 months - 1 year before going back and trying yo on medication if your period has still not regulated.<br>  <br>  However...my personal opinion on it, is that if your not having a regular period than your not ovulating. If your not ovulating, then you cant get pregnant. But some people can ovulate without having a period because the lining of the womb can be absorbed into the blood stream (dont quote me on that..because im not 100% that's true.. but Im sure ive read that some where)<br>  <br>  Good luck hun x
2k2ZeUwkaa	how weird is this!!!! i was also on nordette for 8/9 yrs, also stopped in dec, and one period in Jan-still waiting....<br>  hmmmm you my double??/haha<br>  sorry i cant really answer this, im still learning too, but good luck-maybe we get our BFP at the same time too!|`|KNxs4PrZaa	i am not sure exactly what your situation is but i got pregnant after not having had a period in two years so yes you can get pregnant with an irregular period.  i think you should maybe talk to your doctor because it sounds like you have a tricky situation going on.|`|VeuJB4lEaa	i think the bleed in january was the coming off bleed, of course your periods will be out of whack after coming off the pill, you might not get one for another 3 months, it does happen! your cycles might have changed now after being on the pill as you cant control them, my cycles used to be 28days dot on, until i went on the pill for a few months, came off and they went to 35-50 day cycle, i think it is your pill hun.|`|AA12254690	You can definately get pregnant whle not having periods!! I'm have had an irregular period my entire life and after not having a period for 11 months I found out I was 3 months prego!!! If your trying to get pregnant good luck all things are possible! I thought I wasn't going to get pregnant until I took pills to regulate my period but I gues not lol! My doctor said its rare but so possible!|`|Boubyng3aa	yes, you can get pregnant even though you don't have a period, as long as you ovulate. My sister-in-law got pregnant after not having a period for like 3-4 months or longer. Best of luck|`|jwGkGaiCaa	Yes you could be pregnant. There are false negatives al the time.<br>  <br>  But you also might not be pregnant. Why don't you go see a doctor about it?|`|dDdMdUI0aa	what pill ?fill me in.
ntdGOZqGaa	Have you ever talked to her? Her being six maybe she will outgrow it and she is more like a tom boy? If I was you I would take her to go and get a soda just you and her and talk to her about, and just let her know that no matter what you love her. If you make the communication between you guys really strong then she will always come to you, just tell her no matter what she can tell you and talk to you about anything and that you wont judge her and you will always love her. I think thats more important.|`|Aj99vuqYaa	I was just like that. I still enjoy wearing a loose shirt and boy jeans with my hair hanging down or throw up in a messy ponytail. I played in mud, with cars and trucks, and played with football, soccer ball, and baseballs. I played star wars, power rangers, ninja turtles and Indiana Jones. I did so many different "boy activities" growing up. It's what I was into. I enjoyed playing with baby dolls, barbies, fake makeup and other little girl things, but it wasn't as fun.<br>  <br>  I'm not lesbian. I'm not even "bi". I'm straight as can be and absolutely love my b/f. <br>  <br>  You also say she's attracted to her girl friends. That could mean she admires their beauty and thinks they're pretty. Don't you think you're friends are pretty? I've called my friends beautiful, gorges, adorable, pretty, etc. etc. It's nothing uncommon.|`|WXCa8zQoaa	maybe you should buy some of those parenting books on that subject they have a lot these days and maybe take her to a therapist and ask them what do they think|`|ZA18KoC9aa	she's probably a tomboy and might grow out of it in her early teens.|`|u12N9IVAaa	Trust me... it is a phase. She will grow out of it. She is just trying to express herself. When I was a kid I wore dresses EVERYDAY to school until I turned 9 then I started wearing jeans with holes in the knees and tshirts... Chasing horned toads and sticking them in my pits (they like it because it's warm) I completely turned into a tom-boy!!  I also went through other phases in my life where I was a stoner, other times when I was a raver doing shrooms and god only knows what else... but guess what? I GREW OUT OF IT! Calm down mom. I know we ALL worry about our kids but don't make a big deal about it or she will think something is wrong with her and will be afraid to express herself... just roll with the punches, accept her for who she is TODAY, and take lots of pictures so that one day you can both look back and laugh at when she 'only wanted to wear boy clothes' LOL <br>  <br>  good luck!|`|qTVkydt1aa	"Masculine" colors?  Color preference has nothing to do with sexuality. <br>  <br>  She's little.  I don't know what you would need help with.  She just sounds like a tomboy.  There's nothing to worry about.<br>  <br>  Just because she isn't a stereotypical "little girl" who loves pink fluffy things and dreams of a life being an abused sexist princess who feels the need to be perfect and wearing makeup 24/7 doesn't mean something is wrong with her.  She's herself, and you should be proud that you have a child who knows what she likes.|`|2OAK0xVIaa	dude. im 13. and i know that it is just a phase. six year olds dont really know about that stuff.<br>  mmaybe she is just more comfortable around boys. and girls are just tooo like stuck up for her.<br>  and if she grows up and is lesbian, so what?<br>  there is nothing wrong with that, becauseeeeeee<br>  lesbians are amazing.<br>  shes six, give it time<br>  anddddd later talk to her about it. but make sure she knows you will love her no matter what her dissision is in life.|`|bZhnLjHGaa	Okay,  I think your daughter is reaching out to you and trying to tell you she isdifferent.  You should talk to her and comfort her.  Maybe find a girl that is just like her and they could be friends and maybe she will realize i like boys now.  Hope this helped :]|`|AA12245468	just wait.<br>  11, 12, 13 is just around the corner.<br>  <br>  <br>  Our oldest, now thirteen, just last year dressed and acted 'tomboyish'.<br>  basketball jerseys, sweats, so on... then...<br>  she started developing and wearing 'girly' clothes and 'became female' AND aged a couple of years seemingly overnight.<br>  <br>  be glad and cherish this time in your daughter's life.|`|CADfxb8waa	Maybe she's just a tom-boy. It might just be a phase, don't stress! Maybe eventually she'll get over it!<br>  -hope i helped :d|`|qYZ2QFlbaa	Its a phase. I was a tom boy too. I kept my hair very short, liked "boy" things.... Just be prepared when at the age of 13 she does a 180 turnaround, and go boy crazy :)|`|87e42b12d9375f23a7f6007b19387ae4aa	shes 6. chill the f out.|`|sp1x3ZUAaa	She might be a tomboy, she might be (sorry if I sound stereotypical) a lesbian, she might want to be a male.<br>  But I don't think you should worry about it at this point!<br>  She is only six years old and I don't think either you or her really knows anything about how she will be at this point.<br>  Me and my sister have both shopped in the boys section and worn masculine colours and been kinda tomboyish at times and stages, but we both wanna stay girls... it's probably not a permanent thing for your girl.|`|AtVRWrwCaa	she might not want to BE a boy, she may just be a tomboy. I was never into girly things until I hit high school i think. I'm straight as a line lol<br>  <br>  If you are really concerned you may be able to ask a doctor if it is just a phase, but sadly I think there is not much else you can do besides let it go for what it is.<br>  <br>  best of luck to you and your daughter|`|vR4k5iVCaa	i was dressing in baggy clothes, playing football, climbing trees until i was 13 yrs old. i didnt have any girlfriends because they were to busy trying to be cute and all i wanted to do was throw the football farther than anyone else lol. i am now 31 i have beautiful children and i love my husband. i still till this day go outside and throw the football with my son. it doesn't mean anything let her have her fun and worry less and i mean even encourage her just to enjoy life|`|aIDg79cuaa	I was just like her! (I'm a girl) And i used to shop in the guy's section all the time. She's six, I don't think she's gonna change her gender.  Girls are usually more "attracted" to their girl friends than guys are. It's a normal thing. Don't worry. It's just a phase. :)|`|8hsEPGgHaa	It's way to early for that thought to have crossed her mind.<br>  Maybe she just likes to play with boys cause they're more fun.<br>  Playing Barbies isn't every girl's idea of fun.<br>  Sometimes girls like playing in the mud too.<br>  <br>  Does she have older brothers or does she 'play' with dad alot?<br>  Making her more interested in masculine things.|`|75c40712ce4c1c9063d61b17387937f9aa	shes 6. maybe she is a tomboy, i love dark colors, i shop in the mens section and i love my GFs, but i'd never wanna be male. shes only 6, let her be.|`|gHR4vlcDaa	well lol guess you will not know until you child is old enough to really realize if she wants to be a guy.. Hun chill lol, us this you first kid? Kids go through phases has nothing to do with wanting to be male.. just her personality,still and TOM boy. she is only 6 stop fretting! Dont do anything about it you could give her problems and make her feel sad and not like herself and uncomfortable around you..... let it go even if it is true in the end their is nothing that can be done or changed we are what we are<br>  <br>  My son is 8yrs old and normal...he always played with my shoes, heels included, had his nails paint a few times, like to play with his hair, grew out of all of it ! Just stages, look up some Freud or Piaget!|`|prqrQcd1aa	What exactly are "masculine colors"? If she is 6 years old..why is SHE shopping for clothing?

hjLzSGV0aa	well usually you cant say for sure when the morning sickness starts<br>  it depends of woman to woman <br>  but it usually starts @ 7 weeks<br>  <br>  a great website is <br>  i-am-pregnant.com<br>  it helped me A LOT during my pregnancy|`|wmc7uHLIaa	Stopping coffee is a good thing.  As for tea, that can be loaded with caffeine too, so be sure you are drinking stuff like chammomile.  <br>  <br>  Morning sickness is usually worst in the first 10 weeks.  Mine was bad from weeks 8 to 10 and then suddenly went away.  It was smooth sailing from there.  Not all women get it, so hopefully you will be lucky and not experience it at all.|`|d5fd9d057a20f9f41b37d39a5288a98faa	I started to get morning sickness at 9 weeks. And I get every morning like clockwork. lol. For me, it lasts til around noon or so. You should read as much pregnancy books as possible, the more you can know about your body and baby and the changes they are both going through can only help you =) Tea is okay, just try to make a little weaker then usual. GL and Congrats|`|4huAT6Npaa	I had NO morning sickness with my daughter thats 13 months now and No morning pregnancy now I"m 6 1/2 months...|`|4jeqIx6Paa	i got them my 7th week and lasted till 15th week and now at 30 weeks there returning again !|`|vygYFdsSaa	Morning sickness usually starts around week six, I believe. What to Expect When You're Expecting is a great book, i love it. Just go to google and type in "pregnancy recommended foods" or "pregnancy bad foods" and I'm sure you'll find tons of info. Just typing in "pregnancy" or "what to expect pregnant" should help you find great websites to read. It's great that you stopped drinking coffee, but its the caffeine that's the problem so if you're drinking caffeinated tea you should stop. Good for you on drinking the water and being so proactive about your baby's health :) it's funny you should mention that about soda, the carbonation ALWAYS upsets my tummy these days.<br>  <br>  Congrats -- I hope you're one of the lucky ones who doesn't get morning sickness at all!|`|1ezYfkX7aa	I started to get morning sickness around 8 wks with each pregnancy...and it lastest up until about 20wks.|`|OI3bf4yjaa	What to eat: <a href="http://www.responsivehealth.com/Pregnancy/What-to-Eat-While-Pregnant.aspx" rel="nofollow">http://www.responsivehealth.com/Pregnanc...</a><br>  What not to eat: <a href="http://www.healthcastle.com/pregnancy-foods-to-avoid.shtml" rel="nofollow">http://www.healthcastle.com/pregnancy-fo...</a><br>  <br>  <br>  I had my morning sickness 8 months of my pregnancy, and ALL DAY too.

I am 6 weeks and haven't had any yet... (fingers crossed!) <br>  <br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.babycenter.com/302_is-it-safe_3657246.bc" rel="nofollow">http://www.babycenter.com/302_is-it-safe...</a> is a good source of "is it safe" questions. I browsed through it a lot.  Here's a *partial* list from that site and from what my doctor told me:<br>  no more than 200 mg of caffeine a day<br>  - no deli meats unless they've been well-heated before you eating them<br>  - no hot dogs unless they were well-heated<br>  - limit tuna to 1-2x per week, max!<br>  - ask about other fish<br>  - make sure you're fulfilling the nutritional guidelines for pregnant women!<br>  <br>  <br>  Eat lots of green veggies - but cooking them makes them lose some of their nutritional value (like folic acid). So make sure you take that into account. Take your prenatals :)<br>  <br>  I drink a *ton* of tea and have found mixed information on it. Some day black tea may cause uterus contractions. Others say it's safe. Some say green tea may block folic acid, so to stay away from that. In general, you should stay away from any strong herbs like ginsing, etc. And the raspberry tea had controversial remarks too :( I am *very* confused by all of it, and my doctor told me just everything in moderation.  <br>  <br>  Definitely talk to your doctor when you go about all your concerns. My doctor also referred me to a dietitian to get a full nutritional plan.
u94HOVz7aa	my children get a diaper rash when i put ANY generic diapers on their bums for more than 45 minutes.  so its name brand all the way for me.  if you want a great cheap alternative Luvs are only a $1 or 2 more than the generic but are name brand and much nicer on their skin and dont leak.  thats what i use and they are awesome.  <br>  <br>  one week my kids went to their dads and he used parent's choice and they got such bad rashes they got open wounds which developed a secondary bacterial infection which turned into a yeast infection then back to a regular diaper rash  (all of these being treated by their dr. one just led into another)  so needless to say after this incident their dad finally realized not to use generic anymore.  i had told him not to he didnt listen now he does.|`|IXBl5l5kaa	We used Parent's choice for the NB size in the early weeks until she grew out of them, then we went to all of our baby shower diaper stash.<br>  <br>  My daughter, despite being breastfed and pooping every other hour, never got a diaper rash. We did use Desitin cream at each diaper change though.<br>  <br>  I like that brand but currently just prefer Luvs over everything. My daughter got her first rash at 6 months while she had bronchiolitis.<br>  <br>  **Agreed, Target brand diapers are pretty good. I forgot to buy diapers one week and the Luvs were on sale at the Commissary. Since it was out of my way we used Target brand for a couple weeks.|`|OHq5gSjJaa	My guess is it probably is the diapers.  I've never used Parent's Choice, but did have a similar problem with White Cloud, which is also a cheap brand that I bought at Wal-Mart.  After noticing the rash that broke out I went right back to using Pampers and my daughter's rash cleared right up.|`|10YksH8caa	yeah, Target brand works really well.|`|KihffCc5aa	It's so common for babies to have yeast infections, a combination of desitin and a MILD yeast cream mixed with the diaper cream will clear it up.<br>  <br>  Parent's Choice at Wal-Mart, have done nothing for me in whipes or diapers.  I've gone through a ton of generics, Pampers Cruisers are my fav.  Safeway grocery stores have a Mom's Supreme diaper that works so well, so does the Kirkland, Costco brand.  Otherwise, diapers really contribute to rashes and whatnot.<br>  <br>  I highlyh recommend, for a generic, the Safeway brand, you can get a pack of their surpreme diapers for $8, and they are really superior.<br>  <br>  <br>  Colleen|`|irHF6CBPaa	I use parent choice since my baby was a newborn and never had a problem until a week ago(now 2 1/2 months) it started of a small rash and started  to spread horribly doctor said it was fungus and prescribe nystatin(don't know the spelling) and the rash became worst so I went to my mom and she said to switch diapers and she gave me a cream I use the cream and within 3 days rash was gone I started to use the parent choice diapers again and the rash came back so I'm definitely going to use a different brand since I notice it is the same rash and it is spreading again another thing my sister baby also get diaper rash from parent choice|`|tGwIeQRNaa	I always used the name brands until my babies were about a year old. I don't know why, but it seems like their skin gets a little less sensitive as they get older. My kids always got rashes with the PC diapers, until about 1 year and then they were fine. My 20 month uses them now and he hardly ever has a rash. None of the rashes were like you described though. I hope your daughter is okay. That has to hurt..poor baby.

gHR4vlcDaa	my 8 year old usually goes to bed about 11 on the weekends, if he had a good normal week in school, and sometimes on occasion we let him stay up until 12, and very rarely i let him stay up until he falls asleep but that is when I want to sleep in,lol<br>  <br>  For a 6yr old Id say 10 at the latest the other two still at 830|`|9fb74469d3f937feeed0a568c9da83feaa	I think 8:30 is pretty good, they need a lot of rest, but I would say 9pm max, not later than that !!!|`|4URp7Ew6aa	I would start getting ready for bed around 8:30/8:45 so that they are in bed by 9:00!

q790d7rAaa	Once he does learn to roll you should stop using it, as he could roll on it and it could become a suffocation risk... Until then, I don't think there is any reason not to keep using it.<br>     Just so you know,  I used those breathable baby bumpers so my kids feet didn't get stuck in the slats.. you can get them at babies-rus... they don't have the same risk as other crib bumpers do.<br>  goodluck|`|IXBl5l5kaa	We use a positioning wedge with an incline since my daughter used to have severe reflux that has since tapered off a little. I also have sheets wedged under her crib mattress to incline it.<br>  <br>  We still use ours and she is 7 months old. She does usually end up in bed with me about half way through the night since she is not sleeping well. I have tried using  it without the wedge and she wakes up faster.. too flat. She pretty much just sits herself up now, she's not much of a go back to sleep on her own baby. <br>  <br>  I'm sure there is a slight risk of having it in the crib but it helps my daughter out. I also put the crib bumpers up because she would sometimes wake up at the foot of the crib with her feet in the slats.|`|842e7245d92a9eaaf5883492a9c11008aa	i would put a bumper in his crib if you haven't already, the wedge will be fine for now but when he's napping i would him just lay in his crib without it so he can learn to roll. besides, they usually will start squirming and moving so much in their sleep that eventually they won't stay in the wedge anyway and then it will be useless.

Intelligender is a ph test.  It basically told you your urine is more alkaline than acidic.  Ask any doctor about the heartbeat thing and she will roll her eyes and tell you it's just foolishness.<br>  <br>  My guess is either it's a boy or a girl.  Flip a coin.  That's exactly as accurate as any of these methods you've described.

j5y1pONfaa	Just last week we terminated my baby's biological father without his consent. Its called "involuntarily termination". I had to get a lawyer and what we did is this. We had to have legitimate reasons to terminate. They based it off of these three things. 1. He abandoned the baby before she was born and to this day he has not supported her (11 months). He has never even seen her. 2. He was petitioned to take a paternity test and acknowledge her that she was his. This meant he had to get a lawyer too and pay for all court fees including an ad litem for the baby. He was given 20 days to register for a pat test. (which he did not) 3. He is a convicted felon. He is in prison now with a sentence of 5 years. In Texas they have to have atleast 2 years of time to serve and this is a form of abandonment. Something like that. My lawyer scheduled a court hearing to have his rights terminated. I had two people testify against him proving that he knew of the baby's existance and proving he did not support her, acknowledge her, etc...Now he will know this has been done and finalized once he gets his copy of our termination decree. I am not sure how it works in Florida but if you go to this website, they may be able to help you. I know I had to use this site for other legal advice. I hope this helps.<br>  <br>  <a href="http://forum.freeadvice.com/" rel="nofollow">http://forum.freeadvice.com/</a>|`|JYgJD0Rwaa	If the biological father was a US Citizen, then yes you would need the father's consent and I could see how it would be difficult for you. <br>  It would be best for you to consult with a lawyer just to be sure of your rights with him being illegal. But again since the bio father is abusive, never been around, abandoned the child, and isn't even a citizen, I don't think you'll have any problems at all.|`|DGPUdOOjaa	I think you  still need his consent. Maybe all you need to do his publish your intention in the newspaper of the last known address of the bio dad.That's how it's done in my state.|`|597177c91388208c5ee63c31b258904baa	If the father has gotten deported then came back illegally report him, then get the step dad to take custody. The family court system can see as an open and shut case.
YnLqItJPaa	Most of the things I've read and my doctor do not recommend applying heating pads to the belly during pregnancy.  A change in a few degrees can be a big deal to a fetus.  Most books recommend you don't even lie in the sun!<br>  <br>  I've found the best way to sooth those pains, for me, is to just take a warm shower and let the water hit my belly.  I highly recommend trying that!|`|o9nSygbEaa	I would say, nope, not without asking your doctor or midwife. The baby can get too hot. I don't know if a heating pad would be enough to do it but doctors do caution against hot baths and showers so I'd imagine a heating pad might be too hot. I'd ask the doc first.|`|4rV15ZYuaa	Hot packs are ok for short periods of time but not a heating pad. Also, try increasing the amount of water you are drinking and eat a few bananas. The water and potassium will help the stretching and tightness subside.|`|yNoENquTaa	i've always used a heat pack when i've gotten cramps. i was in a hospital a little while ago and i had a heat pack on my belly and back. i was 12 weeks then. just make sure it's not scolding hot. it's ok. =]<br>  ???|`|pJ7icz0taa	You need to ask your Obgyn...it's best to take her/hims advice.<br>  I would hate to say yes  ..I don't know you or your condition and why you have slight pain.|`|L7uz5Xmzaa	You should however, take some precautions when applying heat to various areas of your body. Typically a heating pad will only heat up a specific area in your body. Because it does not increase your overall body temperature, you can usually use one safely during pregnancy. You want to be sure however, you don’t use a heating pad that is too hot or it may burn your sensitive skin.<br>  <br>  It is very unlikely that using a heating pad would cause any undue stress to your baby. This is particularly the case if you use the heating pad on your back, legs or arms. You might consider using an ice pack if you experienced some form of injury, as this may work better to help decrease swelling. If you have muscle discomfort in your abdomen you should consult with your health care provider to rule out any serious problems and discuss a suitable course of treatment.|`|vFBOFecQaa	I use a heating pad for mine.  I definitely feel  your pain, I never expected to have cramps during pregnancy because I've always heard about stretch marks and back pains... but not cramps.  My doctor said that a heating pad was ok, but not to take any pain relievers.  Hope it helps!<br>  <br>  I guess I should add on here just to be specific, I don't put the heating pad on high but keep it on a low setting.|`|4hNdYjjraa	I am pregnant and i also have a cramping pain, It could be from gas or an urgent need to make the toilet. I also end up needing to go just a few hours after this pain gets stronger. I use heat packs and it doesn't make the pain go away but it sure does settle it and sooth the belly. Your stomach is suppose to be 20 to 30 degrees hotter so you just have to be carfull with the heat. good luck.|`|a03b0b5014fce6dc67440fe39f59a44aaa	Yes you should use the heating pad your probably cramping up because all of your organs and stuff in your stomach is making room for your baby to grow so its all getting pushed back. I hope you feel better good luck and congradulations!|`|tqC2LCkoaa	NOOOOO DOOO NOT USEE A HEATING PADDDD PLEASEE. im sorry but no a heating pad can cause serious ever fatal burns to a child during pregnancy.|`|MzDTL8jVaa	That's a question for your doctor.  Mine said I could use a heating pad on my back, but I never asked her about the front.|`|1N3wmqz7aa	yea|`|4ThRaoBOaa	you should ask your doctor not some stupid hicks over the internet thats if you really care though|`|Qdb5LZMCaa	i would suggest putting a towel in the microwave for a minute and applying that to your tummy. Heating pads can generate some serious heat. Im sure that a few minutes on and then a break would be safe but what if you fell asleep?  Studies have shown that even hot baths can cause the  fetus to have strokes. Better to be safe. Hope you feel better soon|`|7f54bd72ade10853212dff9f56d9bfd0aa	I would never use a pill during pregnancy, Im conservative. But with heat packs? Of course! It wont effect the baby inside (congrats btw) unless its burning hot. I would use it ontop of my shirt though, not skin on. <br>  Just a quick answer :] congrats and good luck!|`|d086b780b3bd50e6038d8d200be185abaa	I would ask your doctor to be sure! I have heard that hot tubs can be dangerous durring pregnancy because  they elevate your body temperature and that can harm the fetus,so the same may be true for the heating pad!|`|AA11471943	yes its fine to use heat packs. i was in hospital 4 weeks ago due to cramping and morning sickness and they gave me heat packs to use rather than pain killers.|`|ANsznbWsaa	I haven't heard not to. I don't know why it wouldn't be, you know as long as it's not scorching.|`|amTfJnKsaa	i dont think you should cuz you dont want to hurt the baby you should just lay down and stay sleep for bout 2 hours....|`|3e42dfd404c2e6e75af7d0c190d10b2aaa	My doc doesn't even suggest really hot baths.. He said something about the excessive heat causing an unsafe climb in body temperature which could harm the baby.
G2auAv1Saa	I'm with Haven on this one.     odd, irresponsible and not what brining children into the world means    EDIT: Yes, you going out an getting drunk and having a baby with God knows who is also irresponsible. Did anyone lead you to believe we would condone that behavior? It is irresponsible because a child is supposed to be created out of love within a marriage. Not with your ex (who is your ex for some reason) to balance out the numbers.|`|EzgodvQOaa	Yeah i think it would work. If you can still talk to each other instead of being lovers be friends [ which u probably are ] But as long as he IS going to be there for the child i think its a good idea, to have the same father. =]  Good Luck i hope it works out for you  x|`|6W7nJYskaa	It sounds rather irresponsible.     Unfair to the child you would be creating.    Children should come from love and commitment and not from a love of numbers...    EDIT: Yes the scenarios you list are irresponsible. However it does not make what you are doing a responsible thing to do. You are having this child for the wrong reasons.     You are questioning whether it could work because you obviously have doubts too. Think long and hard about what you are proposing to do because it just isn't right.    :-)|`|jX4DGwmzaa	I had the same idea, as long as he is there for the children and he helps support them its not a bad idea. But if he is just going to just be the father, then i don't think that's so hot.     But its also a lot harder to parent two kids rather than just one. My kids are 18 mo. apart and it was really hard. so just take that in consideration. Good Luck with your decision!|`|pkG0aiAeaa	I think you should adopt. Or at least seriously consider it!  It would be irresponsible & ridiculous for you to have a child with a man you don't love just to give your daughter a sibling.  If this is your real reason for wanting another child, your daughter would find a perfect brother or sister in a adopted baby. And you would be doing something amazing for a parentless or unwanted child.      http://www.adoption.com/    http://www.adoptuskids.org/|`|Ca5n28eVaa	It  could work but u would just have to be careful and not let this affect the relationship that ur ex and you baby have
D35xKICoaa	Yes  it is safe and one of my friend got pregnant in 2 months.Good luck(***)|`|1z3C0R2Vaa	Well every one is different but you can go a head and try.Get your ovulation test and when you do ovulate sex every other day or every day .

I like Ozzie though. :]|`|AA10097817	Once upon a time, in early US television, there was a show called "Ozzie and Harriet". They were the Nelsons. A real family, with their sons Dave and Ricky.

I was outvoted.|`|mINKANlAaa	no thank you. thats such an odd name and kids will make fun of him. im sorry, but its the truth =/|`|dPULl5hjaa	weird|`|c5fd4a971e3c66ac1ba65c45a97fbf60aa	I imagine Ozzy Osbourne and I don't think that fairs well for an infant.    Maybe try naming him Oswald or something and nicknaming him Ozzie.|`|qitXGd0qaa	Oswald or Osbourne and call him Oz.     That way when he's an adult he'll have a formal name for professional purposes. Could you see "Dr. Oz Smith," "Oz Smith, Esq." "Oz Smith, CEO" and take him seriously?|`|8mQVfDRqaa	I would so laugh if you are Australian.    if you call him Ozzy, people would relate to Ozzy Osbourne, so no for that.  Ozzie looks too cutesy and not very mature, so he won't grow into it.    sorry, I don't like any|`|8eGrFwXQaa	sorry but yuck :(|`|o2tPN5Geaa	I have actually known 3 guys named Oz.... all of them very interesting people.

e0eb82b689e1db392eb51c89982ed115aa	I found out at 18 weeks they are pretty sure around 22 weeks, but I think they can tell as early as 16. They just cant be certain. Now a days with the good ultrasound technology they are pretty correct 90% of the time after 20 weeks.|`|ygimTNzoaa	I'm told around or just after 20 weeks. I'm also told which doesn't make much sense to me but more then one Dr has told me that it is easier to tell sooner if you're a bit overweight I have not a clue why. I'm 20weeks and have my Dr. appointment this Thursday the 5th of February. I'm so curious.|`|xif22nwoaa	They can usually tell at 16wks, but it is more reliable if you wait until closer to 20.|`|SGeo7cqYaa	4 months!|`|uFrqC4Y2aa	around 20 weeks.

uFrqC4Y2aa	That sound slike you're very pregnant! A lot of people don't actually throw up. I didn't start getting sick until I was 7 weeks. Congrats!|`|6zVISNTZaa	It could well be, but as you had sex 9 last 9 days into your cycle, on average, there's a lesser chance as you'd have been ovulating about 5 days later on average, however, take a test and see (: good luck.|`|6cVZtWG9aa	take a test|`|AA11828121	Sounds like you're pregnant.

G2auAv1Saa	Let her know you are supposed to be alone during the night and if she were asleep she wouldn't even realize she was alone. Tell her on *whatever* day you will do something special together but nights are for being alone. Then put some stuffed animals in her bed and she will go back to bed.|`|0781f56992749b6d9de1b9aa61424bbbaa	I would say "I understand.  I get lonely at night (and other times) sometimes, too".  Then, I would stay with her or invite her to cuddle up with me in my bed.     When someone I love says that they are lonely, then I try to make them feel less lonely, if I can.|`|F6lZHRkVaa	I'd firmly but gentle tell her that no, she can't sleep in my room. Kids will say anything they can to get their way, so I'd continue to say no. And then during the day I'd say, "Let's go shopping for a new teddy bear or some other big cuddly animal you can cuddle with at night, okay? You get to choose. Let's go!"|`|wZAeBisbaa	She may need more attention, or she may know how to manipulate you into keeping her company at night.  You would have a better sense of that than we would.      I would say do what feels most comfortable to you.  If you want to keep her company in her room, it won't do any harm, and there really will come a point where she doesn't want her mom in her room any more. But be prepared for that to be a long way off.    If you don't want to get into that habit, try alternatives.  Maybe you could give her a special stuffed animal or doll that would remind her that you are thinking of her even if you aren't in her room.  Give her lots of attention during the day.  Get her used to entertaining herself when she has to be alone, and let her see the advantages of having quiet time to oneself.  Encourage her to find friends to play with; invite kids over if she doesn't have other opportunities to socialize.  If she has a sibling, let him/her sleep in the same room.  My son loved it when his baby sister moved into his room.  He stopped calling for us  during the middle of the night, and he went to bed much more easily.      Hope these ideas help.|`|ZcrsqMbcaa	I'd say "You wont be lonely anymore because ..Im alway going to be here for you ..always"|`|B9KwqnuDaa	What the heck is wrong with you people children need to be close to their parents!! She's telling you she is lonely have a ******* heart and let her sleep with you!! Who cares if it becomes a habit she'll grow out of it eventually. Buy her a new blanket are you serious why? So she is taught that emotional needs are met with buying things?? And kids will say anything to get their way? WTF?? Society these days has conditioned almost everybody believing that children are conniving, manipulative, inconvenient little brats so we need to control them. Which we don't! A parents role is to be supportive and loving. Teach by example, love and reason.|`|60a3bbdca78e74fb19db426e27b9a087aa	Maybe you should spent more time with her. Lay in her room for a little while until she falls asleep. Give her more attention.|`|JsqMSU9Haa	let her pick a new pillow or blanket for her bed.  does she tell your she's lonely other times or just during bedtime?|`|ABvw9Ocoaa	allow her to sleep with you she want some one to be with here when she is afraid.|`|jkDawQVNaa	spend sometime with her to soothe her as she falls asleep , go back to your bed cause if u sleep with  her it will become a habit!|`|Rn9SO1Wjaa	My 6 year old does the same thing I often sleep with her, but when she has to go to sleep in her room I lay with her until she falls asleep and leave the night light on and she stays asleep! I don't think that they like going to sleep alone they prefer going to sleep knowing there is someone there. she is only 5 years old she is still young just cuddle with her at night and reassure her that she isn't alone and just leave the door to her room open and leave your open too!|`|baIrxCKOaa	I think your daughter is plenty old enough to sleep on her own.  Don't you?  She might be testing the waters with you.  I do have some suggestions though, because my daughter has tried the same thing.  One thing for sure is to talk with her and find out exactly why she says that she is lonely.  There could be something that she isn't telling you that might be bothering her.  Maybe even something from school, if she attends yet.  Another thing is to explain to her, in no uncertain terms, as to why she is not allowed to sleep with you.  Make it perfectly clear.  Some helpful hints that worked with my daughter is as follows:  A nightlight is always helpful.  Let her rearrange her room and make sure she has lots of input on how she likes it.  Place plenty of her favorite stuffed animals near her bed.  Keep her door open so she doesn't feel trapped in.  Make sure she has a regular sleep pattern and nothing to eat or drink right before bed that might keep her awake.  And as for the nightmares, reassure her that they are not real.    Just a fyi:  my daughter had nightmares almost every night for about 2 years around your daughters age.  The good news is that they did pass and she is sleeping fine now and never made her way into my bed.  Hopefully for you, this too will pass.  Good Luck and hopefully good sleep.|`|GKjvY2PNaa	I've read a couple of times recently that it's western societies that don't allow bed-sharing.  In many other cultures it's quite normal.    I for one, LOVE sleeping with my kids.  If they're restless, they go back to their beds.  Don't we as adults enjoy sleeping with someone?  For a little kid to have to try to fall asleep in a dark room all by themselves could be quite scary, I think.    Most of the time my kids are okay sleeping by themselves, but once in a while I think they feel a little lonely, sad, or whatever maybe and want me to sleep with them.  I think we have to be more sensitive to their own need for bonding.|`|hlvdPjeFaa	Spend more time with her what else! You shouldnt make her feel alone. She's your daughter.
AA10280194	You sound perfectly normal!!  That's exactly how I felt and still do - I'm 9+ weeks now.  The cramping is easing off some and the nurse told me is should begin to go away soon.  I can't remember exactly but the dizziness is either hormone changes or your body making more blood.  I love my "pregnancy pains" because they are the only thing we have that keeps us reminded that we have a little one growing in there :-)  YEAH!!!|`|AA11828121	When you get dizzy eat, I have the same problem, it's my blood sugar...As long as I eat something I am fine, i've had to separate my meals into 6 small meals a day because of it. The cramping is your uterus stretching, if it gets worse, or there's blood, that's when you need to worry.     I didn't start having sickness until 11wks, i'm 15wks now and it's still off and on but I was nauseous off and on without nothing coming up, it's normal. You're just going through normal pregnancy symptoms, get used to it :)    Ask your doc for the glucose test, that will determine if the pregnancy is going to cause blood sugar issues for you, it happens to a lot of women.    The embryo is too small to see as of now. Give it another 2 weeks and you will be able to see it...|`|wffHLYieaa	I am almost 17 weeks pregnant.  I had cramping too.  It's probably your uterus growing.|`|fa7f262b7fe76b6e718a0faa1796731baa	Try drinking more water ,taking short naps, with Tylenol for pain. salty chips work like munchos  for being dizzy could be low blood pressure|`|PlqMl73Gaa	Cramping is totally normal! At 5 weeks you really can't see a whole lot. If the yolk sak has already changed to the embryo it could be really tiny!! If you have lots of bleeding and severe cramping that is in your back and down your legs you should go to the doctors. Depending on what insurance you have, if you feel like things are just really not right, then go to the emergency room and get checked. All it can do is help reassure you.|`|va8OyKOGaa	i was similar! i alway felt like i was about to start my period with the cramping and back pain i was having. it is totally normal! and when i went to the dr they did not do a u/s becasue it was too early and they knew they would not be able to see anything at 4weeks.....you should be fine...good luck|`|d1d16f976ab4af78c06d3dc29088aab7aa	at this stage. it can go either way.     I've had both happen. My first pregnancy, I had a Miscarriage at 8 weeks. I had dizziness, nausea and swollen breast. minor cramps. but no bleeding up until 7 weeks. then at the ultrasound at 8 weeks they saw no embryo, they said it was def. a miscarriage..     now in this pregnancy. i had cramping at 5 weeks but no bleeding, no nausea or breast swelling until 12 weeks.  it all depends on the person's body . everyone is different.  if you read online it says that a lot of time morning sickness and nausea is a sign of a miscarriage.. it just depends on the person's body.|`|uFrqC4Y2aa	That's totally normal. If you see some blood with clots then go to a doctor right away.|`|60a3bbdca78e74fb19db426e27b9a087aa	If there is no embryo how are you pregnant?
e0eb82b689e1db392eb51c89982ed115aa	misscarriages are very common, a large percent of late and very heavy periods are normally early misscarriages. YES its totally true that even if you have multiple misscarriages you can have happy healthy children.   I had 2 misscarriages in a year. I had a stillborn son a year later at 5 1/2 month gestation. We had testing done and found that my body was not accepting my ex-husbands DNA. Almost all his sperm was deformed and weak. I body would not accept a living child from him. After divorce (other related problems) and re-marriage, I got pregnant right off with my new husbands baby, and she was fine, Healthy great problem free pregnancy. I am now 33 weeks pregnant with  2. Little problems here and there but nothing severe. Its going well now. There are many many things pregnancy can due to a woman. One is disrupted sleep patterns. So its possible.|`|iMULlxdgaa	I've had miscarriages also and everytime I have one I end up having a normal pregnancy afterwards. So maybe it is true.  Our bodies pick out the good embryos too so some don't have every chromosone they need etc:.  in a way its  blessing in disguise if you body does this but it can be really sad as well.  They also say you are more fertile after a miscarriage because your hormones are still up a bit...so this could eb the case too.  funny thing about the time but I wake up at 4 am every morning and have to stay up for a few hours beofer I can get back to sleep again,  I'm 37 weeks prego.|`|LLXozwiTaa	hi well i had a misscarrige in may of 07 and it was my first baby doctor told me it happens to mostly every one. i found out i was pregnat again in july of 07 and i was scared but everything turn out find my son will be a year soon.

bc80b085beb98b92a6819181843ddbbbaa	Getting down on their level is helpful, you should never tower over a child and expect them not to be intimidated.   The parents will likely introduce you, but if they don't you can just go about it very casually, don't interrupt their game or their activity.  Just sit down close and say something like "Wow, I love that game!  It looks like you are having a lot of fun!"  If they show any interest in you then you can say "I'm X, your are Y, right?"      When young kids make friends the names of their friends are often second to what their friends actually do or say.  Being more interested in what they are playing or what they are doing will get their attention better then telling them your name first...they just don't care.  The seven year old will care more then the 4 year old, depending on his maturity level.|`|e36bcd7f45f132e8833b6f65649c3f42aa	Eye contact and ice cream!  Boom - instant popularity.|`|o4NRcsAHaa	say how u love kids and you are so excited to be spending time with them and how u will be the best babysitter ever!|`|2xS1Jro7aa	Bring a game or something to play with them. Get down on their level introduce yourself and ask them what their names are. Tell them about yourself maybe you have a dog you can tell them about and then ask them some questions about their interests and so on. Also lay down your rules right away tell them that they are going to have allot of fun with you as long as they follow your rules and let them know that if they don't they will have to take a time out or so on. You could also bring stickers and let them know that when you see them being extra good you will let them pick a sticker or stamps work good too! Good luck and have lots of fun!!|`|F6lZHRkVaa	Come in the door and after general introductions say, "So who wants to show me all the fun stuff in his room?" Let them find a toy or game in there and follow their lead. Good luck!|`|AA11100518	get down on their level (maybe get on one knee) so you are at their level.  make eye contact.  let the situation guide you.|`|JsqMSU9Haa	just be yourself.  introduce yourself to them as you would to anyone.|`|AA10420187	Well say that we can play together and have fun.

kVBDpAMTaa	No. A pregnancy test just detects hcg hormone which has nothing to do with a uti. =)|`|AkFag8tNaa	No but the UTI in and of itself can indicate a change in hormone (some women are more prone to UTI's when they are pregnant) I know I was.|`|v3LnJycKaa	no it wont, the test is looking for a hormone not a bacteria.|`|x4uGfC4oaa	I don't think it can.|`|dPyfP0ijaa	NO, because the pe stick detects Hcg hormone that is not blocked by infection.|`|yCR6qg0baa	No. UTI's don't produce pregnancy hormones. However, a UTI can cause a lot of pregnancy symptoms-- frequent urination, upset stomach, dizziness, tiredness, etc. Your body could just be playing tricks on you.|`|Eqln1jmNaa	no, but if you are pregnant and have a UTI you need to go to the doctors because any kind of infection can cause a miscarriage or preterm labor... so if you get a positive you better head to the hospital|`|d7MYtVDTaa	Hi karissa!!! I dont know if UTI effect preg test they shouldn't but i dont know but UTI are common in pregnancy so this could also be a sign that your pregnant go see a doctor !!!

dPyfP0ijaa	Why do you let her treat you this way??    She is way too old for her not to listen. Start at home, time-outs, YOU'RE THE PARENT, TEACH HER THE RULES!      She learns what is acceptable and not acceptable through you.    Watch that show supernanny to get some tips and FOLLOW THROUGH|`|qB4KvbDiaa	i would make her stand in the corner when she goes through these fits. 5 minutes at a time should do the trick|`|af644b7256e7bf5a53974bb99a32d482aa	Let me guess: you don't spank her, right?  A little swat on the rear would do a world of good. When she acts up, lock her in her room until she promises to be good. And follow through, each and EVERY time she acts poorly.|`|Tvq32ptlaa	Just wondering, not accusing so please don't get huffy.  Are you a bribing parent?  Or one that gives in?    Do you tell your daughter that if she behaves she will get a treat -OR-  Do you tell your 3 y/o in the grocery store not she can't have xyz cookies, but when the tantrum comes you give in just to settle her down?    If so there is the start of your problem.  You're rewarding negative/bad behavior.|`|c687ba2c3786d264e3f7a7e6b1a12f8caa	Your child has more issues than could be dealt with here.  Either there is a "parenting" problem, or she could have a metabolic or chemical imbalance that causes her behavior.  Does she know you mean business when you correct or scold her?  Or does she know Mommy is a push-over and if "I cry long and loud enough" (I'll) get my way?????  With children, especially this young, they have to experience unpleasant consequences for the behavior to change...meaning she has to understand that say, if she misbehaves, she gets 3 minutes in time out..and if she gets up before her 3 minutes are up, it starts all over...and you HAVE to be CONSISTENT with all of your punishment or praise.  Even if it inconveniences you, or you have to repeat over and over with her...  Children will only do what they have learned works...she needs to know that her inappropriate behavior is not acceptable.  And honestly, I agree with another poster here...a spank on the bottom never hurts either...she has to experience some kind of negative to be able to associate what she's doing that is considered innappropriate...and you cannot "reason" with a three yr old, I don't care how smart they seem...they have to learn boundaries from their parents...and that things won't be pleasant for her if she disobeys...|`|zqfs7A6Caa	We have a three-year old. A public melt-down has always meant an at-home pants down (spanking). Since our son knows this, public tantrums have only happened a couple of times. The terrible twos do not have to be all that terrible, and if misbehavior is handled early it can make the threes much easier. If tantrums are not stopped, they may never stop.    You also must consistently punish tantrums at home. If you catch them before they start, time-outs can be effective. When she starts to act up, tell her to calm herself down immediately.     If the tantrum gets worse, send her to time-out. If she refuse or continues to act up, take her to her room and wait until she calms down..then spank her with a real resolve to correct her behavior. Afterwords let her know that she was spanked for refusing to calm down when told.      It sounds like your daughter is going through independence issues. Although this is fine by itself, she needs to learn to calm herself when you tell her to. If she learns that disobeying an order to "calm down" comes with strict consequences, she will learn to control her temper. Just make sure you also control yours and never discipline in anger, just a firm determination to teach her to behave.|`|8ff3196b10cd4c3afc116407535b3666aa	Well you could try consistent spankings and time-outs, you could take her to a counselor, or you could call Super Nanny.
2HETgiwgaa	Any cycle where you BD at your fertile time (looks like your last BD date was about right) you can get pregnant.  To save money I'd wait until you're sure you're late (but get a multi test pack if you think you might be tempted to test early :-)).  I chart on fertilityfriend.com - it helps you work out when you should BD and when you can take a break (it has a little traffic light that turns green when you're probably fertile, orange when you're possibly fertile, and red when you're probably not fertile).  Good luck and lots of baby dust to you.|`|ZbnxGIsnaa	Every month you have a shot!  You gotta look at it from that point of view.  =)  I'd say you have a good chance!|`|PwHQSAxvaa	50/50 - you either are or you are not.|`|kZFw2SGUaa	take a test and see :)|`|VLzXypQ4aa	i think the every other method is bogus because you waste the sperm on those days just doing it on peak day is enough to get pregnant without doing it before then. it seems like there was enough time for the sperm to recoup. I think you have a good chance, but it also depends on your fertility and if you were on birth control because I know that that messes with your uterine lining and that would make it hard or impossible for the egg too attach. thats not to say for everyone but I know that is an aftermath of taking birth control and taking it for a long time.
ibWLdXlJaa	Children's Zyrtec. My doctor told me it's safe for my 8 month old to take. You use the same dosing as Tylenol. It might make her sleepy but it's helped him. :) Hope she gets better soon.|`|mO2oOqZ3aa	For now all you can really give her is infant tylenol to help with the pain and the discomfort she might be in. Are you putting a pillow or something UNDER her mattress to keep her head elevated? That helps when they are sleeping!! Other than the drops and humidifier, there really isn't much, maybe take her outside and get her some fresh air!!! That should help clear things up a little bit.  Good luck! hang in there.|`|toOzi7aLaa	Let her heal on her own. People are too quick to medicate infants and toddlers. Allow her body to fight her infections|`|NroZQN5vaa	Call your doctor's office and ask them what to do. That's going to be your best bet.|`|AA11920812	We just went through the same thing here! I ran their dehumidifers (cool mist) at naps and bed. I also used baby vicks vapor rub on the bottom of the feet and covered them up with socks or sleepers. Worked like a charm!!    I wouldn`t give any cold meds. If she feels uncomfortable like feverish or achy (just whiney). Or, if you notice she is laying her head on the sofa or floor (headaches in younguns) give some infant tylenol. The meds she is taking for the ear infections may actually be helping her right now.|`|afc692e37eb08c220509639ca2e1a9f5aa	Don't give her any medications. Studies show that giving babies cough medication has more negative side effects than good. For her teething get her the soft chewy ring and stick it in the freezer and give it to her. You can try baby ojel to ease the pain in her mouth.Call the doctor and see what s/he recommends for the baby.|`|bHAlwhTBaa	I know how hard it is when your baby is sick!  Mine is sick now too.  Check with your doctor before giving your baby anything.  But my doctor said I could give my 8 month old PLAIN Robitussin (with guaienasin), which is like giving him a lot of extra fluids to expectorate the mucus.      Good Luck.  Call your doc!|`|Zof09ZWJaa	The only thing you really can do is continue with the vicks, put it on her chest and back. Continue using the saline drops and be sure to suction her nose, that will remove the mucus from her nasal passages, allowing her to breathe easier and have less pressure. She still needs the humidifier, even if you have to take the humidifier out of her room and put it in the main area you are in during the day. Or even let the shower run hot until the bathroom gets nice and steamy and sit in the bathroom with her and let her breathe in the steam. If you think she's in pain, give her some tylenol. And encourage her to drink as much fluids as possible. Fluids help thin out the mucus, but avoid milk, that will only cause it to become thicker.

This way people could come over and get together, meet the new baby and bring gifts if they wanted.  A lot of people brought food, clothing, and diapers.      It was a surprise for my friend really because she felt it wasn't proper etiquette to have a second shower but we knew she'd been wanting a girl and finally got one and knew it was a big deal so me and two others got together and planned it.  She really appreciated it and was in total shock!|`|AA11537580	depends on if someone throws you one or not  yes if they are 5 or more years apart or if it is a different gender  usually a smaller , just family  and close friends, second shower

When I began with my son it was a pain but after a week, it is a lot easier.  One thing that made it easier was that I got an electric tooth brush so that I could get as much coverage as possible.  My son had all of his 16 teeth by one so it was important to use toothpaste also (without flouride).|`|x8JRkRNkaa	I would always wipe my babies gums with a wet wash cloth before they even had teeth. When they got teeth I started brushing them as I would my own. 2 times a day. I would even floss between their teeth to get them used to it. My children are now 5 and 3 and they have great teeth, and love to brush them. Starting to brush them now would be a good idea since as soon as they have teeth they should be brushed. They need to be brushed  no matter if she likes it or not. Unless you want her teeth to rot and she will grow up having bad brushing habits.

There are many people needing jobs, and although you need the money since you wont get paid time off, maybe your business can grow, and this person you bring in, at least keep it going along side of you and take over while your needing time off at the end of the pregnancy and at least a month if not more time bonding with the baby???  Get help with the house, I found a wonderful gal from Craigslist that gave me some help with things I had put off, and I was able to screen them and I would hire her again in a heart beat. Even a neighbor might have a teen that you could hire to help get the house in a more barable condition for you?? Take care, this much anger seems a little more than the norm but you do have more going on than the normal person. You are not turning into some ugly person, your at about at the end of your wits, its ok to ask for help, from hiring someone, to getting a visit with a Dr for some self help destressing techniques. I hope things get smoother for you. I would also serisously consider paying into disability ins on your own and other taxes that you can pay into yourself to keep it worth having your own home business.|`|JsaEk8UAaa	You are not a horrible angry person!!! Your hormones are wacky and your emotions are all over the board. It will get better!!! If you have some really close friends that live near by call them and explain just how you feel and ask them if they could come over and just help you clean for an hour or so. You would be amazed how much better you will feel. You will have warm friendly people close by tagging the messy house. You won't be overwhelmed cleaning by yourself plus you will have time spent with friends - win win!!! Remember your baby can feel what you are feeling so try to make it a good thing!!!! If you have an old barn or a garage with no windows - go throw ice cubes at it. There is nothing to clean up, no ball to go after, and you get to use up some of that energy!! Find a happy place and visit there often!! Good luck!!|`|Y7sio6Yhaa	i totally did i like wanted to kill someone sooo much i threw stuff all the time i would scream and yell and slam the bathroom door over and over to avoide breaking something. i broke my laptop and then cried for hours because i didnt have a computer anymore and it was my own damn fault lol. it went away, hormones are a killer.|`|aB2zSt6Vaa	I had a very short temper and was annoyed by everything my husband said and did. Poor guy. Women who felt comfortable giving me loads of un-wanted advice were also on my list. I felt very sensitive and also like i had a right to be a bit of a handful from 4 wks preg to about 10 wks preg. It has evened out a bit but what was most important for me was telling my husband that we weren't gonna have any big discussions if i was tired, hungry or emotional. If I said "Drop it", I meant it. After we did that, it helped to avoid some really big fights.    It is definitely the mix of everything you are going thru right now and of course, hormones. Take everything you listed (short winter days, money issues, long work hours, etc) and think of how a regular, un-pregnant woman would handle that...with screaming and tears of course. Now add into the mix that you're having a little one and it makes everything much harder. Do yourself a favor and just don't give into this anger more than once a day. It sounds like this pregnancy surprised you, which may be part of it as well. Now that I'm entering my 4th month, it is easier to deal with since I'm not as tired and confused.|`|phwivaqNaa	It sounds like a combination of your hormones and stressful situation.  I would talk to your doctor and see about counseling and/or meds.  That is going to be your best bet to reduce stress, which is crucial.  Stress if very, very dangerous to the baby.    Your angry is natural and the hormones can amplify the situation.  Get help now before it turns into something more serious.      Good Luck|`|p2l8zQYuaa	I just get very bitchy and irritated.|`|60a3bbdca78e74fb19db426e27b9a087aa	Get some help for your issues. Reduce your stress. Stop worrying about the things you can't change, give yourself a break. Rest. Be ok with a mess until you have the energy.    Eat as healthy as you can, fruits and fresh veggies every day. Drinks lots of water.    Learn to meditate.    Learn to calm down because you have a baby inside you now and he/she needs his mom to be calmer.    You are probably taking everything harder than usual because of the pregnancy. Give yourself a break and relax girl.|`|JjbragXNaa	I was like that with my first pregnancy and I wanted to just die most the time.  There was a lot of outside influence on how I felt, so do as much as you can to reduce the amount of stress you have.  I worked 50+ hours a week, so that might have something to do with it.  My only suggestion would be to relax as much as you possibly can and try not to sweat the small stuff.     I did feel better after my pregnancy except for I had a child taking up all the rest of my time.  Just make sure you prioritize the things in your life and you'll be ok.    Also, don't be afraid to ask your family and friends for help.  They'll totally understand if you need some help with the housework or just someone to let you go have some alone time.|`|eY2VLqeNaa	i was never pregnant but when one of my best friends were she was the same way.  Hers didn't resolve until three months after the baby was born.  It sounds like u also have a bit of stress so it would be caused by that to.  I hope this will help u!
FkGh0LuWaa	Make necklaces, decorate cupcakes, pin the tail on the donkey, play dough, duck duck goose, tag, Simon Says, Mother May, or play dress up.  familyfun.com or birthdaypartyideas.com will have a lot of great ideas.|`|Tvq32ptlaa	Age would be really helpful.  Is this for a birthday party or "play-date"?    Set up a stage (bed sheets draped along a doorway for a curtain) and have "dress-up" clothes for them and let them put on a fashion show.  Have it be the theme of the party, have the girls bring any "outfits" they have and let them have fun with makeup take TONS of pictures.    For birthday party: For her thank you cards, you can have a group picture made (similar to holiday photo cards)    Good Luck!!|`|tYETMZlQaa	Twister, pin the tail on the donkey, red light green light and Simon says|`|qa20ll5baa	get like a bunch of ''kid'' makeup... they will pay with it for hours.    set up like a 'kid salon' for them.. hair/makeup/dress clothes/play shoes/ put some purses... they will loveee it trust me
fe6fcbf713d0ed0538de9c9304001a52aa	Some moms can nurse only a few times a day and not loose their supply, some can't.    If you get her back to nursing you will go back to having more when you pump, nursing stimulates your supply more than pumping.    http://www.kellymom.com/bf/weaning/weani...  Will my milk dry up if I only nurse once or twice per day?    Most moms find that they can wean down to a few feedings a day (or even just one) and maintain their supplies at this level for extended periods of time. In established lactation, milk production depends primarily upon milk removal - if milk is removed from the breast, then the breast will continue to make milk.    Breast refusal due to flow preference is probably a greater danger to the breastfeeding relationship than too-low milk supply. Frequent use of bottles increases the possibility that baby will become frustrated with the slower flow of milk at the breast, and this may lead to breast refusal and an earlier weaning than anticipated. See What can I do when baby wants a faster milk flow? for some tips on dealing with flow preference.      http://www.kellymom.com/bf/concerns/baby...  Coaxing baby to the breast  General tips    Your goal is to coax baby to the breast. Do not attempt to force your baby to breastfeed. Forcing baby to the breast does not work, stresses baby, and can result in baby forming an aversion to the breast. As baby gets better at nursing and is able to get more milk via nursing, he will grow to trust that breastfeeding works and will have more patience when latching.        * Wear clothing that allows very easy access to the breasts. Baby may get very impatient in the split-second it takes for mom to lift the blouse and undo the bra. Spend time, if possible, in a warm place that allows both mom and baby to be naked from the waist up.      * Lots of skin-to-skin contact can help your baby nurse better and even gain weight faster. Keep your baby with you as much as possible, and give him lots of opportunities to nurse (even if you're not successful). Get skin-to-skin with him, first when he is sleepy, right after a bottle feed (or however you're supplementing). This way baby has the opportunity to sleep and wake up happily, skin to skin at mom's chest, and mom is right there to catch the earliest hunger cues. If baby moves toward the breast and then falls asleep before even mouthing the nipple, or after sucking twice, then these are positive baby steps, not failures. (Read more about kangaroo care or take a look at the book.)      * Offer the breast often. Try breastfeeding in baby's favorite place, in his favorite position, in the bath, while walking around, while lying down, with baby upright, baby flat on his back, in his sleep, just as he is waking, any time baby looks as if he might be interested, or any other way you can think of, i.e. any time, anywhere.      * Avoid pressuring baby to nurse. Offer in an ultra-casual way and pretend you don't mind if he refuses (easier said than done, but try not to show any frustration - your aim is to avoid pressuring baby to nurse). Don't hold the back of baby's head or push or hold baby to the breast. If baby pulls off the breast, then don't try to make him go back onto the breast at that time - simply try again later. If baby seems frustrated with your offering the breast, then turn the pressure down and simply make the breast available (lots of skin-to-skin!) without offering. It can be helpful to have lots of skin-to-skin time with baby where he is cuddled at the breast with no pressure to nurse - give control over to your baby, so that baby decides if and when to nurse and when to stop nursing.      * Carry your baby close to you (a sling or other baby carrier can help with this). "Wear," carry, hold and cuddle your baby as much as possible; carry baby on your hip while doing other things, play with baby, and give baby lots of focused attention.      * Sleep near your baby. If baby sleeps with you, you'll get more skin-to-skin contact, plus baby has more access to the breast (see this information on safe co-sleeping). If baby is not in the same bed, have baby's bed beside your bed or in the same room so that you can catch early feeding cues, breastfeed easier at night, and get more sleep.      * Nipple shields can be helpful at times for transitioning baby to the breast. Talk to your lactation consultant about using this tool.      * Comfort nursing is often the first to come, followed by nutritive nursing. Offer the breast for comfort any time you see a chance- at the end of a feeding when baby is not hungry, when baby is going to sleep or just waking up, when baby is asleep, and whenever he needs to comfort suck If your baby is actively resisting nursing, then try encouraging comfort nursing after baby is comfortable with skin-to-skin contact. After baby is willing to nurse for comfort, you can then proceed to working on nursing for "meals" as well.    You are working to seduce your baby back to breast. Again, coax, don't force!     "Instant Reward" techniques    For a newborn who is not latching or an older baby who does not want to wait for letdown, try these techniques that help to teach (or re-teach) your baby that nursing is a way to get milk:        * Hand express or pump until let-down, just before trying to latch baby, so that baby gets an instant "reward" for latching on. Another way to elicit let-down is by doing reverse pressure softening.      * If you are using a nipple shield to transition to nursing, try filling the tip of the shield with expressed milk prior to applying the shield and latching, so that baby gets some milk first thing as he latches.      * Drip expressed br
D35xKICoaa	Get a test at your doc........|`|ds5MCdS5aa	Hon, you need to just go to the Dr. and have him/her confirm or deny.  As smart as people are on this site, i'm fairly certain that no one will be able to give you a definitive answer......|`|PyOCZiwjaa	wait a week or two, take another test or two, then go see a doctor|`|p2l8zQYuaa	Take a blood test|`|DTg3USppaa	i did the ept it worked both times with a positive.

FWC7Ah0Uaa	Eating deli meat is fine as long as you heat it up until its steaming. Same with hot dogs. Trust me, i craved hot dogs and subway during my whole pregnancy<br>  <br>  Congrats and Good luck!|`|hYL6LJWeaa	Ha, eat what you want. I ate whatever I wanted with my first pregnancy and she came out healthy and smart for her age.[6 monthes old now] I ate everything I wasn't supposed to, but I couldn't help that I was craving it. lol|`|x1HoSdYTaa	Heat it up, then it will be fine. You will have these cravings alot. Think of your husband or the other people around you. Dont make them go out of their way to get stuff for your cravings. I know it is hard, but to answer cravings is hard, too.|`|lj29Ez1Qaa	I eat it all the time.. TURKEY and Chicken deli meat!! I dont eat the ham  though, it has some kind of bacteria!! Its fine!!|`|YnLqItJPaa	I was crazy for turkey clubs for a couple of months, but deprived myself because of all the scary listeria stuff on the internet.  I talked to my doctor about it and she told me to go ahead and indulge now and then, but just not to go crazy.  She said that the soft cheeses are a far bigger threat as far as listeria goes.<br>  <br>  I still try to avoid the deli meats, but don't panic as much or make myself feel guilty (like I just downed tequila or something) about having a sandwich every once in a while.|`|gHR4vlcDaa	put it in the micro make sure it steams- it wil be fine! or make a grill sandwhich- just dont eat it cold from the package! For all the preg ladies that say EAT IT UP,lol you need to check with your doc their are some does and donts in pregnancy,lol ever heard of <br>  <br>  Listeria<br>  <br>  Listeriosis can cause premature delivery, miscarriage, and fetal death. A pregnant woman is more susceptible to Listeriosis because of the normal pregnancy changes that affect your immune system.<br>  <br>  Listeriosis may cause flulike symptoms with fever, chills, muscle aches, diarrhea, and upset stomach. It can take a few days or even weeks to appear. Consult your healthcare provider if you have these symptoms or believe you have eaten a contaminated product.<br>  <br>  thats like telling someone hey I smoked my baby is fine yours will be also!|`|KNxs4PrZaa	it is reccomended not to eat it because it carries a risk for food poisoning.  i didnt eat a bite of it with my first but i am much more relaxed this time, ive had many ham and cheese sandwiches.  i would say if you are going to eat it make sure it comes from a clean and trusted deli.|`|fS9lryRkaa	Eat it up, but heat it up first, toast it! Yummy lol sorry if this is no help|`|3EiOobEVaa	I've never heard of deli meat not being good to eat while pregnant...i am 7 months and eat it all the time and havent had any problems|`|JRXpYW3Naa	Just heat it up first, then its completely safe!!
JRXpYW3Naa	What you ate while you are pregnant? That would be the best diet, I think. Personally, I'm not watching my diet as carefully now that I'm breastfeeding. I drink alot of milk and take my vitamins, thats about it.....|`|OO0ajxiEaa	While I was breast feeding I ate, anything I wanted but tried to stay on a balanced diet. <br>  <br>  I suggest eating healthy but eating what makes you happy, your baby will give you clues as to what is the best food for the both of you. My daughter seemed to be more content with the milk when I ate a lot of chocolate, but had horrible gas if i ate chinese food. <br>  <br>  Trust your baby!|`|MMj7YcXkaa	anything you want.  milk is a combination of carbohydrates, proteins, minerals, and fats.  not what you eat!|`|aca803aafd407291581b58b9be71df4daa	Whatever you want.  There is nothing you are "supposed to eat" as a matter of fact they recommend not eating much tuna if you are pregnant or breastfeeding.|`|msNXomjTaa	Like your pregnancy, your body will give what your baby needs to him/her.  This means, taking it from you.  You need to eat lots of very nutritious things - both for you, and for your baby.  You need to have a storehouse of good things, as you body will rob from you if it needs to, for you baby.<br>  <br>  Breast feeding uses up a fair number of calories as well (yet another good reason to do it!), so you will need to eat more than you usually would.  The usual - lots of fruit and veggies, and protein.  The vitamins etc., that you consume will be carried in the fat in the milk to your baby.<br>  <br>  Congrats on breast feeding!  My daughter was a 2 month premie, and 3 lbs 11 oz at birth.  She was breast fed for quite a while.  She is now just shy of 13, and 5'5" last I checked (but she had grown 3/4" in the previous 3 weeks, so that could be more by now!), big, and healthy as a horse.
AA10916164	Well, I took 4 home preg tests and all came out negative... and yet, I am due to deliver a baby girl in 7 weeks.  So, it maybe too soon to tell. Get a urine test at the doctors.. they can tell a lot more accurately if you are pregnant, especially if you are testing too early.  Good Luck !|`|OVMb4V7Maa	Well, if you haven't had your period until November, and you had sex January, than you had sex after you stopped having your period for a few months. So, I don't think you're pregnant, but it's possible. There is such a thing as a false negative, but only your doctor will be able to tell you whether you're pregnant for sure.|`|5RtRppZaaa	go to the Dr, that will be your only concrete answer!|`|8be341d723e0fe65c6c5f21fb174145aaa	ONLY THE DOCTOR CAN TELL U IF U ARE OR NOT|`|2448af06b59df00dd8a1a3ac6d057c75aa	most likely a -|`|CYtjXICoaa	go to the doctor better sure than unsure|`|qQJdi0p1aa	well from experience I had 4 negative EPT tests... and I was pregnant,some people don't "eliminate" the hormone really early on..you should go to the doc and find out why?I dont know your age but if you dont want parents to know make a visit to planned parent hood (or similar office) its like 40$ for a visit and they will tell you|`|4hNdYjjraa	by now it really should come up with an accurate answer. My test was wrong but not for this long, it was wrong until 2 weeks after my missed period. My friend has the same problem and she got a ultrasound as she couldn't think of anything else it could have been. But turns out she wasn't and got a period weeks later. I don't know what happend she did see a doctor though.|`|WmKjeUELaa	Every woman is different.  Some never get a positive result although they are pregnant, and some have gotten a positive result and not been pregnant.  I used first response and it told me I was.  But that is just me.|`|ANsznbWsaa	I'd say you are probably not pregnant if you had 2 negatives, but only your doctor can tell you for sure.
MMj7YcXkaa	I lived 30 min from my hospital and my husband worked a ways away too.  Labor is usually a long process if you are in tune with it and know whats normal pains and labor pains.  I just called my hubby and waited for him to come home and we drove together to the far away hospital....I screamed at him the whole time, but hey that was a moment in the past!  lol  fyi...if you don't relax, labor hurts ten times worse.  I had 2 and the first one was way worse than the 2 because I didn't relax|`|jYPeis3Saa	you could call a cab. or when you go into labor you could just wait at home until your husband gets there to take you to the hospital provided that labor isnt progressing too quickly and if your water broke it is clear. <br>  <br>  my husband works nights as well and my water broke on a night that he was at work. i started gushing bright red blood right after that so there was no waiting around for me and i called 911 since i had no idea what was happening. <br>  <br>  if money isnt a problem for you maybe stay at a hotel that is close to the hospital as your due date grows closer|`|ev8ZZYx2aa	If this is your first baby the chances are that you will have a long enough labor to get to the hospital. You will probably spend hours in early labor.|`|382b69da7c50fc8ccf68048ab522a879aa	You could always call a cab? But then surely your partner would be allowed to leave work to drive and be with you. I would hope so, anyway!|`|bQTATDTyaa	You will be fine getting to the hospital in plenty of time. Most women have long labors first time. Worst case it will be super fast and you will just have the baby, if it's that fast there won't be any issues most likely, all you need to do is catch.<br>  <br>  I had my baby at home with just my husband, planned, childbirth is not a medical procedure.|`|aca803aafd407291581b58b9be71df4daa	Can you contact your husband at work?  Labor can be a long process.  If it is just contractions then contact your husband and tell him to come home.  You should have plenty of time.  If your water breaks call 911.  Once you are at that point you won't give a crap who delivers your baby....just that someone delivers it.|`|e6ffc07866095f4a39c50bd16b9859e5aa	I don't know where you live, but if this is your first baby you will have lots of time for your partner to get home and take you to the hospital. most first babies take 20 hrs + so don't worry|`|oXIYHsDaaa	You will have lots of time to get to the hospital, when your contractions start call your husband and make sure you leave the house by the time your contractions are about 8-10 minutes apart and are steadily getting stronger.|`|8oAlBL91aa	I'm sure that when you get closer then he can tell his work that he may need to leave to take you to have the baby, most jobs are very cool with this situation. There letting my husband take his vacation when ever the baby comes usually they ask for a 2 week notice but they said he can say I need my vacation tomorrow and they will allow him.
1ezYfkX7aa	I had 3 c-sections and felt great 3wks after. The first week was the hardest, the 2nd week was a little sore and my breasts were killing me from being so engorged...by week 3 i felt great!|`|KihffCc5aa	Oh hon, it's different for every woman, and it also varies on her weight and if there is excess fat covering the wound.<br>  <br>  Realize that a C-Sec is a surgery.  There is recovery from it.<br>  <br>  You should expect to be sore for several weeks, a C-Sec chops through muscle, nerves, etc.  If your wound is healing well, then KUDOS, your c-Sec will be healed fast.... 4-6 weeks.<br>  <br>  C-Sections are a major surgery, if your wound is healing well, great!  But, your muscles and more need up to six weeks to heal.    You cannot expect our body to heal after a surgery so fast for a baby.
jYPeis3Saa	its normal to get emotional when thinking about the birth of your baby. my birthing experience was not at all what i planned for. 20hrs of labor then an unplanned c-section. it still bothers me to this day almost 16 months later. but life goes on. <br>  <br>  the fatigue is hard to get used to. i would sometimes fall asleep on the couch while breastfeeding my son in the middle of the night. the funny part would be when i didn't realize that i had fallen asleep and wake up a few hours later to find my son sleeping across my lap on the bobby with my boob hanging out next to his mouth. oh well guess you had to be there to find the humor in that. <br>  <br>  the achyness in your back is probably from the epidural. if its severe then get checked out by your doctor. but generally yes, its normal. <br>  <br>  i had the "baby blues" i would cry if my husband even so much breathed in my direction. its normal and its all hormonal. mine lasted about 2 weeks. If you feel any negative thoughts about your child or have thoughts about hurting yourself or your child then get evaluated by your doctor for post partum depression. <br>  <br>  good luck|`|oXIYHsDaaa	It is very common to be emotional during the post-partum period, if you are worried about it (which it seems you are since you're posting) you might want to talk to your doctor or midwife. Post-partum depression is a very common problem linked to the sudden decrease of feel good hormones in your body. It happens to lots of women and if you need it, meds can help a lot. I've never had a epidural, so i'm not sure about your back, but I know i had aches and pains all over for the first couple of months while my body tried to get back into prepregnancy form.|`|842e7245d92a9eaaf5883492a9c11008aa	yes, that's all normal. the back pain comes from both the epidural and just from the delivery or c-section. it will hurt for awhile because your body just went through a drastic change and a major surgery. the crying spells, etc. is all normal. you will get more used to being a mommy after awhile and it will stop. hang in there, you will be fine|`|vXXDzBaKaa	I delivered my first child vaginally, I had a epidural. My daughter is almost 4 and I remember to this day the pain in my back from that epidural. It didn't hurt to the point where I wanted to cry but it ached really bad for like a week or so afterward.<br>  <br>  The crying thing you are experiencing sounds like post pardum depression. Go see a doctor for a.s.a.p.
oDlDrjF1aa	my son is with me 24/7 i dont work so i mean 24/7|`|UVwRSpDjaa	He's with me all the time unless I'm working BUT he is really close with his grandpa and he usually calls once a week to pick him up for a few hours. I let him because my son gets so happy and he gets to play w/ his uncles. He enjoys it. Now...if he cried when he picked him up I wouldn't allow it because I would feel bad. I use this time to clean the bathroom or laundry or even take naps (i'm 5 months preggers). I don't think it's wrong that I let him spend time w/ his grandparents often. They both enjoty it and I'm so glad they have a special relationship. My son does not like shopping w/ me or running errands w/ me so why not let him be where he will have fun?|`|aca803aafd407291581b58b9be71df4daa	I have my son ALL the time.  I have never left him with anyone for over a few hours and that was only 2 times and it was in the afternoon.<br>  <br>  I decided since my husband and I don't have help I needed to establish a consistant bedtime routine.  I do the same thing every night and my son goes to bed at 7:30 pm.  This give me all night to have to myself.|`|b9035adcbdf28a53a5a80e18a3dc49d7aa	My baby is always with me. (She is 9 months) I have left her for no more than an hour (to get the occasional MUCH NEEDED pedicure lol) and I ONLY leave her with Daddy. I do not feel comfortable leaving her with anyone and do not plan on it for a long time. Don't worry about it. You are building a trusting bond with your child that will last forever :)|`|vXXDzBaKaa	YES! I have to small children 3 n 1....they are ALWAYS with me! If they are not with me they are with their father (my fiance), the only people I allow to watch my children are the grand parents. I would love to have some free time. Is someone giving free time away??|`|pXSKSS3daa	Noah is ALWAYS with us. If one of us goes out for something quick(something for dinner we forgot, to get gas, etc.) the other stays home with him.<br>  <br>  Our family lives out of state and, really, they are the ones I'd trust most with Noah but I'd probably still end up taking him with me to most places.|`|ggETPqedaa	My son is with me most of the time when I'm not at work. My mom will babysit, like on a Saturday...if my fiance and I manage to get the same Saturday off so we can go out and eat at a resturant or just spend time together for a few hours. Though other than that, yes, he's with us all the time. There are ways I get around it once in awhile, my mom will watch him.<br>  <br>  Just like when he was two weeks old, I called my mom up crying. I hadn't slept much and my mom took him so I could sleep. The next thing I realize, it's five hours later.|`|OI3bf4yjaa	I am always with my daughter. Partly because I never want to leave her, I'm always paranoid when she's not with me or my hubby. Some days I wish we could have some alone time to ourselves, but when we actually do have time to ourselves, all we do is miss and worry about our daughter! We do have free time when we put her to bed, though. That's good enough for us!|`|c4e0f4398cbb2577d252628c76d0781baa	Lilah is always with me as well.  Like an above poster said, I don't work so she is with me 24/7.  There is an occasion where I will run to the grocery store while my mom is over, but that's the extend of Lilah staying with anyone.  I only trust my mother or my grandmother to watch her while I run to the store at times.  Other than that she always goes with me.  In fact, the greeters at Walmart know her by name lol.  We live in a small town with a Walmart and a grocery store and at both places they know her name and have watched her grow up lol...they are always making comments on how big she's getting (especially all the workers at the grocery store since we are there all the time)! haha...gotta love small towns!|`|FHT6wsUpaa	I never have anyone watching her when I could be watching her myself.<br>  <br>  My husband and I both work full time - 40+ hours per week - and have sacrificed time with each other by working opposite shifts. This way, we need very little child care. She is almost always with one of us. I treasure the time I can be with her. Being a working mom is hard, and being away from my daughter is even harder.<br>  <br>  So, yes...whether I'm grocery shopping, running errands, whatever...if I'm on my "free time" my daughter is always with me.<br>  <br>  This doesn't mean I don't get alone time. She naps pretty regularly during the day, and my husband takes over when he gets home from work at night. I feel that I get adequate time to clear my head during the day.|`|IXBl5l5kaa	My daughter is with me 24/7 except for when I am at work 4 nights per week. She is breastfed so I kind of always have to be there. I prefer her not to have bottles when I am able to feed. I wake up with her, I'm just always there. I am ready for free time. The last 7 months has been this way and I need a break. **I get no sleep. My hubby doesn't wake with her because honestly he's about useless haha, she prefers to nurse to sleep but I'm working on fixing that.. Momma can't do it all the time.**<br>  <br>  I think I'm going to start this or next weekend going to the tanning bed on Sunday's. First of all I'm white as crap, and secondly I would LOVE 20 minutes to myself lol.<br>  <br>  My husband and I tried to have a night out a couple of months ago and we dropped our daughter off with a co-worker who really wanted to babysit. We got to Applebee's, got our meal, ate it, were about finished, then I got a call saying she had been crying the whole time. We packed our stuff and headed off to get her. My daughter is just a momma's girl and strangers don't cut it lol.<br>  <br>  <br>  ***Ugh, don't let me lie to you guys. Thursday I got my hair cut and highlighted (THANK GOD) and my hubby works next door to the hair place. He took her for a couple hours or so while I got my hair done... but he kept popping in every 20min or so :(|`|reO9Dgmsaa	I do not often get time alone, no.  As a SAHM, it's what I signed up for lol!  But there are times I need it, so my husband will take care of Sophie while I run a few errands alone, or take a long bath, or have a girls night out!  :)  The other day was his turn; he went snorkeling with some buddies.<br>  <br>  I have never left her overnight, but have had a friend watch her here and there so we can have a date.  :)<br>  <br>  I'd say overall I get a bit of alone time 2x a week, including those times when Sophie is still home.|`|04ZBuoqWaa	I am a stay at home mom with a 3 y/o son. I am with him all day every day. When my husband gets home, the only thing he does is eat dinner and fall asleep on the couch. By the time I feed and bathe my son and do the dishes, etc, I'm lucky if I can get myself to the bed before I fall out. About once a month, though, my mom is nice enough to keep him for the weekend so I can have some time off.|`|0c6afe76e38ea505da9f14e4c238a25caa	I ALWAYS have my son with me! my mom raised me with attachment parenting and that what im doing with my son. i don't know how old your daughter is but maybe your mom or your husbands mom can watch her for you guys can go out to dinner or a movie. its nice to hear that shes either with you or your husband instead of daycare all day : )|`|jYPeis3Saa	alone time? whats that? <br>  <br>  my son is always with on or both of us. <br>  <br>  if i have an errand to run and m y husband is home they our son is with him or vise versa. i dont like people watching my son. i dont trust anyone for that matter. <br>  <br>  that is very weird that both mother and father would be out at the store at 930 at night while their child is in bed. unless they were out on a date and had a babysitter and the sore was just a pit stop on the way home i hope they had a babysitter at their home in case something happened.|`|Y8Suz0l3aa	I always had my kids with me. Always. My kids are much older now, 12 and 14, and they are still with me, ha ha.|`|DzunYgWOaa	what's that|`|1d02fcff81d2bb070fc361fbe28e3606aa	We always had our children with us when they were little and I don't regret it at all.  They have all grown up to be great kids.  In fact, because we took them everywhere with us, I think that's how they learned to behave so well in public.  We never had a problem with our kids throwing tantrums or bothering people around them.  We took them to five star restaurants, live theatre and really nice hotels as well as water parks, arcades and zoos.  And I also have to point out that we are no-spank parents so I can't say their good behaviour was the result of our disciplinary measures.  They just knew how to behave in public because they went to so many places and saw how other people behaved in public.  Now that they are older and into their own things though like theatre, sports, etc., hubby and I have lots of time for ourselves!|`|692c8795f68a0ba95a0d09139d70c98caa	My daughter is still young, so if im not at work i do have her but i do occasionally leave her with my mom to go to the store or run a few errons.  She has also taken her once when i went to the movies with my her father.    Before i had her i tried to get atleast one night a week to go have some me time.   Its very healthy to get you time to keep your sanity :)   but right now even an hour without my daughter i go crazy lol..  <br>  <br>  My son is 5, if i didnt get an occasional break from him id go nuts!   haha, but he usually suckers me into taking him with me :)  But he is so much fun most days!

ev8ZZYx2aa	There are a couple of different reasons why women express milk. For some - they have to work so when at work they pump so the baby can receive breast milk instead of formula and it also helps to keep mothers supply up. Some women tried to breastfeed from the beginning and had very bad luck so they pump so the baby can have breast milk. Some women do not like the idea of the baby feeding off from the breast. It makes them feel uncomfortable so they pump instead. <br>  One of the biggest disadvantages to exclusively pumping is that the mother can and usually does notice a decrease in her milk supply after awhile. The breast pump does not stimulate the body the way the baby does and it is not as effective as emptying the breast the way the baby can.|`|Kaudz4Msaa	Usually, women do this if a pump is not available.  It is very convenient sometimes...just need a spoon or cup to feed your baby, whether it's colostrum or milk.  I first used it for colostrum in the hospital, while we were just getting used to latch...just dribbled a bit in my baby's mouth.<br>  <br>  I have a very unusual situation, but basically, I have never been able to pump effectively due to my tubular breasts.<br>  <br>  I don't have a lot of milk.  My baby loves my milk, but I have little glandular tissue (hence my tubular breasts.)  So I breastfed but supplemented with mostly formula.<br>  <br>  Once he turned 3 months, he started to get really angry that my milk flow was so little, compared to his bottles.  So, he started screaming and pulling away when I put him on my breast.  I have been expressing milk since.  <br>  <br>  It has kept a little flow going but I don't even have as much as I used to have (which wasn't much.)  <br>  <br>  Generally, it works better than pumping for me, but for the past few days, I've had milk tinged with pink blood from one breast.  Ugh.|`|oXIYHsDaaa	I express milk for my husband or other care giver to feed my baby if I'm not around and for mixing with baby cereal and home made baby foods and baby friendly baking. I even have breast milk ice cream for my little one who is too little to eat cows milk ice cream. <br>  I wouldn't want to try to exclusively express milk instead of nursing because it's way more work to express the milk then to just put baby to breast.|`|IXBl5l5kaa	I work full-time so I pump at work so that my husband or DCP can give bottles of express milk. The advantages are that my daughter can continue to have the same nutrition provided to her even when I am not available. I don't have to wrestle with the effects(like finding the right one that works for her) and prices of formula, and it helps me to maintain my supply when she is not directly nursing.<br>  <br>  The ONLY disadvantage to pumping is what little bit of time it takes out of my day like cleaning the parts and getting it ready for work, and the two 10 minute breaks I take each night. Sometimes I just dread pumping but I have to and it's not so bad once I get going.. and i'm done pretty quickly.<br>  <br>  Pumping FULL-TIME, however... it can be very time-consuming and can cause your supply to decrease. Not every woman responds to pumping as well as others may. The average person can only pump about 1-2oz total from both breasts.<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.kellymom.com/bf/pumping/index.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.kellymom.com/bf/pumping/index...</a>
q0JTN9QAaa	I had teachers that would slap your hand with a ruler and stuff.<br>  <br>  I had a teacher I really hated one time though.  I transfered schools and they would not let me take pre cal because I had not had algebra 3 but algebra 3 at the new school was just the second half the book we covered in algebra 2 at my old school.<br>  <br>  So every day while she was teaching a lesson I would get out my sylibis and do my homework.  Well 2 weeks into the class I was done with all my work.  I never took notes, would sleep in class, and when she asked why I told her.<br>  <br>  Of course she did not belive me and when our first test came she accused me of cheating off someone that got a 70 and I had a perfect score.  After I took the test again at her desk she believed me a little bit but I hate her.  She would constantly tell me I was disrupting class because I would put my head down or would draw or stare at her blankly all day because I had nothing to do.  She changed up the sylibis once and that kept me busy for 3 days.  She finally let me take all my tests one right after another.  It took two days but I finished the class with an A and just roamed the school during that class after that.  She told them she did not want me in her class anymore so they made me an office aid.<br>  <br>  I had the same teacher for art and had to go to the principle 3 times because I kept failing color test she would give.  She refused to believe I was really color blind.   We had to send in doctors notes and everything else and she still tried to make the grades stick.  I finally said my mom called a lawyer and said we could sue if we wanted.  I quit having to go to that class too but still got an A.  I never turned in any more work in that class.<br>  <br>  I hit an oposum on the way to school one day and put it in her ceiling it stunk for months.  They never did find it.  Payback sucks.|`|kc2Sa7ibaa	My science sub teacher is a fat obese lady with grey hair and sent me outside for flicking my hair back off my shoulders... :-\ And it was raining outside as well.. She also subbed for math one day and I smiled at my friend who walked outside and got a detention.<br>  <br>  This other teacher started crying in our class because someone said they liked her shoes 'sarcastically' but it was a compliment :-\ She begged the class not to tell the other teachers she cried... She was really freaky.|`|F9EvPa1Uaa	well, when i was in the 4th grade we had a substitute, and she was acting like a real B!tch, then one kid grab their cell and recorded her. She was cussing at us and everything, I thought she turned into a SheDEvil, then she ran out the room, and told the principal she Quit!, and actually did. ( Still today i thought that woman has serious issues).  She did that because some kid wouldn't copy, "I would behave in the classeroom" (something like that i forgot) 1000x, because the kid sneeze, and she said the kid was carrying BACTERIA|`|p25p9jTYaa	ugh.. ms. honn|`|TbM4K6Ytaa	in 2005 when i was yr9 i had the worst and strictest teacher ever. when we wanted to sit in groups and needed to bring an extra desk she got really angry about it. she slapped a couple of the kids in my class on the face and she chucked someone in the classes books & stationery out into the corridor just coz she got really angry with the person and the person only answered back to her i think.  she obviously doesnt teach at our school anymore after that.<br>  <br>  and the weirdest teacher was my yr11 art teacher. sometimes she would just break out into song, and take paintbrushes from our hands and change/butcher our artworks. she also swore heaps and she would bring her dog into the class sometimes and once the dog walked over my art folio i had worked really hard on.|`|mfBkH3qtaa	Strictest- I had this substitute teacher and she HATED it when the students talked. I had her the last hour of the day so she was pretty upset by then because I have a talkative school. I freaking SNEEZED and she gave me detention. <br>  <br>  Weirdest- I had a teacher who we would get started talking on her life story. So for all my last hours of EVERYDAY we had school she talked about her life. Well not every day because some days she wasn't there or she didn't talk. But she always talked about how bad the school was she used to teach at and how we would all get jumped if we went there, and blah blah blah|`|dXDLeHNZaa	One time I had this sub. If you smiled, looked up or said a word... You'd be SCREAMED at. She was horrible. And she turned off all the fans because she thought they were heaters. I tried to tell her, she just screamed me down... It was a 40 degree day too :|<br>  <br>  Oh, I've had a few weird teachers. My English teacher at the moment, well I swear she has ADD. She's always so happy and hyperactive. And she will act stuff out... And one lesson she spent aaaaages describing an imaginary butterfly. That was weird. My science teacher always begins talking about his life. And tells the same stories over and over again. He always says "Who's in?" or "How cool is that?" atleast 5 times a lesson.... Expecting us to put our hangs up each time.<br>  <br>  Oh and my maths teacher last year... She used to come in and tell us how much she hated us and how we were her worst class.<br>  And my music teacher, im primary school was HORRIBLE. One girl left the school because of her... If you couldn't play the recorder well or sing well.. She'd go off at you (And remember, not everyone is musical) and continuely made children cry. She kicked one kid in the face, and ripped out another girls earring. I have NO IDEA why she is still at the school. SO MANY parents have complained about her!|`|MrNkNnhyaa	i had  a sub,she was like an older woman,and like i you didn't behave like she wanted you to,and if you didn't do your work,she would make you copy the WHOLE dictionary,and if you didn't finish it in class she would make you take it home and do it,and if you didn't have it finished the next day you had to do it twice..:[<br>  <br>  she was a pain in my rear..:[<br>  <br>  <br>  i never had to do it thankfully,but ugh she like had something against me..:[<br>  <br>  <br>  old fart..:]<br>  ^^^^^^<br>  jay kay.:]]|`|8xCtSGsCaa	His name was Mr. Hunter. It was the first day of French 1. He walked in the door and just yelling at us in french and I had no idea what he was saying! He never spoke to us in english we had to translate everything he said by using a dicitionary it was so dumb! I got sent to the deans office because he said i smarted off to him in french.I HAD NO IDEA WHAT I WAS SAYING!!! I was so mad.|`|bdWO9wSAaa	My Digital Design teacher.<br>  <br>  One mintue she's screaming, and the next she's giggling. <br>  One minute she's angry, and the next she's joking around.<br>  <br>  She never stops talking.<br>  <br>  She makes weird noises at her desk.<br>  <br>  She threatens us with tests if we don't do our work, and so far we have only had one test that was about 20 questions this year, for finals.<br>  <br>  She's nuts.|`|NaYTDqmnaa	Mr. Margirite he is a perve he looks down girls shirts he was a music teacher he is like 50|`|RALpRu54aa	Once, maybe 8th grade, a teacher got mad at me for putting my hands in my pockets while talking to her.|`|4YDpeKbOaa	I had a fair few weird teachers, I had one who would call everyone "Honey Bunch Delite" she was strange, there was another one named Mrs Hegarty who looked like a transvestite, then she got pregnant so it was obvious she wasn't a guy O.o<br>  And then I had a drama teacher who couldn't control our class so he sat under a desk for the whole lesson crying. That was funny.|`|X57gC6Xjaa	I had a teacher who wore bright neon spandex track suits all the time (not a pretty sight at all!) and she had bleach blond hair past her butt. She wouldn't let you used the bathroom unless you held up your pointer finger in the air signifying you had to pee, and 2 fingers signifying you had to go number 2. (This was in 8th grade mind you). If you misbehaved she would give you this death stare and say "God will get you." What a creeper.|`|QFgRs6moaa	The weirdest teacher I ever had was in grade 6 band. He was gay. (Yes we actually got a confession from him) Then for the first 6-7 months of the school year he thought I was a guy and started hitting on me. It was so creepy! <br>  <br>  Strictest teacher I ever had was my grade 5 teacher who would, in science make us write out a word 50 times each time we got wrong. Even really hard words|`|wmRxv3rqaa	My science teacher Ms Wilson sang our notes to us to the tune of BYOB by System of a Down..<br>  <br>  i like her.<br>  :)<br>  <br>  And i have a home economics teachers who never teaches us anything, she just blabs on about how she went to Korea and shows us pictures of Asian scene kids.|`|7NrFzS2haa	weirdest-i forget his name, but he calls everyone darla and spanky and makes up lil rascal names for everone.<br>  <br>  Strictest- Mrs. Henry. shes weird too, she would be saying that her mom was awesome and she would always quote her. she was an awkward sub, and she would make us look retarded.|`|gMwSxdpCaa	dunno his name but u have to be silent in his lesson or he will bite your head off lucky i dont have him|`|5tqh0akYaa	i was in a history class last year and now im that teacher's TA (teachers aide) and we like hang out, he gives me advice and its really good to talk to him.<br>  <br>  there is a PE coach that starts dancing and his shirt pops open (ew!) and then he like threw up his food and then ate it agian<br>  <br>  then there is a history teacher that started this thing that if you wear green on thursdays it means your hornyyy <br>  <br>  haha yeah lots more|`|EJpiaCMQaa	When I was in my 8th grade English class, this boy, Tony, goes up and touches the teachers boobs.  I couldn't believe he did such a thing!  The teacher just smiles and looked like she enjoyed it.  I would've smacked him and escorted him to the Principal's office if I were a teacher and some boy did that to me.  Very, very strange.  And this was in the 1970's.  Some things haven't changed much over the years.

yRCBRNOgaa	Some of these wives tales do sound somewhat silly.  Don't listen to all of them. There is a little truth to the wrapping up tale, I see some babies with no blanket or anything when it's very cold out. Your situation was a little different though, 80 degrees is a little warm. You didn't do anything wrong.<br>  <br>  Your mom just worries. I suggest listening to her a little, after all, she took care of you and you survived.<br>  <br>  Good luck with the strange advice.<br>  <br>  Best of luck.<br>  What I would do...smile and do as they say but as soon as they leave, do what you want.|`|pXSKSS3daa	I think your mom and grandmother mean well, of course, but they aren't right. You cannot ALWAYS cover your baby up or they'd get way too hot! My husband's grandmother told us, while we were visiting them in FL and it was 90 degrees outside, that his granny(great-grandmother) would give us talking to because Noah wasn't wearing socks. I think it's just an older generation.<br>  <br>  As far as the other old wives tales go, LOL! I've heard the period one before(not the reason, just that a woman on her period cannot hold a baby) but haven't heard the other two.|`|706fa9fa645a352ed4dc9e7315894893aa	i think they are crazy hahaha...... I think its fine to take your baby out as long it not cold or anything then i would say wrap the baby up but if its 80 outside then your totally fine!|`|90Pb6eooaa	The one about wrapping the baby up isn't an old wives tale.  Generally if your taking a baby out in night air he/she shouldn't be in a onsie.  If it was truly stifling in the house, the baby is sweating.  Then you take this newborn baby that is now wet, outside in night air?  I think you should take heed to the fact that the baby is probably a little young to be chilling outside in a onsie.  Now the other stuff I'm not certain of its validity.  But we live and we learn.  Congrats on the new baby.|`|692c8795f68a0ba95a0d09139d70c98caa	hahaahah my daughters dads family is so big on wives tales!<br>  <br>  If your child doesnt wear socks they will catch a cold.<br>  Cats smother babies<br>  Standing will cause their legs to be crooked.<br>  an a few other strange ones i cant think of..<br>  <br>  My boyfriends other daughter has a cat, who she adores.. he asked me if we should get rid of the cat before i had the baby.. so the cat wouldnt try and kill her!  I laughed so hard at that one.. he said "but my grandma says...."|`|jYPeis3Saa	interesting.<br>  <br>  if it was 80 degrees then you really dont need to have a baby all bundled up. they would overheat and most likely end up in the hospital. <br>  <br>  i hope you werent sitting in direct sunlight.|`|gWiZAsfBaa	I've heard of that one. I was given hell for it too! But there is some truth behind it.|`|2U0BtIZ8aa	i personally have no babies<br>  but then i live around many babies who are my cousins children.<br>  anyways, we have heard of many of these old wife tales and we never follow them<br>  it is rediculous. we've done all of those things and all our babies had grown up healthy and normally. our babies didnt get constipated when someone with their cycle holds them, their growth was normal and they are always crawling on the dinner table (when there's no food on it ofcourse), and they play around/infront of mirrors and their teeth are jsut fine,<br>  those are jsut old myths. no worries.|`|vXXDzBaKaa	lol my mom use to say the same thing! I never listened though.<br>  <br>  The thing with the mirror I heard a little bit different. I heard a baby can't look in the mirror or else it will stunt his/her growth.|`|75c40712ce4c1c9063d61b17387937f9aa	LOL those are cute. Drs say that for infants, dress them in one layer more then what you are wearing. but honestly, they baby will let you know if hes hot or cold.|`|AA10354985	Hi, this is  common in a lot of cultures and it is just that, old wives tales. I come from a family of 12 kids and we ran around half naked most of the time when our neighbours were warning my mother that we would all get sick and die. The reason said for this is that the cold causes illness and cold, flu ext. <br>  <br>  All 12 of us are as healthy as can be and the reason for that is that we were not confine to hot stuffy houses which held in the virus that spread these bugs.<br>  <br>  The worst thing that could happen is perhaps a sun burn and I am sure you would cover up the skin with protection if you were to be out for any lenght of time.<br>  <br>  Of course you know with such a big family and eight of us girls, we all took care of the younger ones with no problems.<br>  <br>  My mother and dad being farmers also did the tab boo thing of feeding us well mashed up potatoes, vegetables and fruits from the farm as soon as she stopped breast feeding and she never believed in formulas etc. We drank from the cows milk right from the cows in the barns and for this reason I am sure we all do not have weight problems, health problems, we have  great skin, strong bones, good eye sight and everyone of us is intelligent.<br>  <br>  Only after your mother sees that these things will not happen to your children, she may decide  to educate other women who are mislead.<br>  <br>  The good thing is she is doing what she was taught and she cares!<br>  <br>  Go  ahead and take your baby outside and don't wrap your son in a lot of clothes, good fresh air is very good for the lungs and we all need some good old vitamin d that comes from the sun<br>  <br>  I hope this advise helps and the teacher of time will be the only lesson she will believe in. Good luck
68d8ad07f5b8eb2e788d4d05c809eeeaaa	The only thing would help me  is the hot water and massage. I remember I would sit on a bath tub, put my legs under running hot water and massage them for like 3-5 minutes every night. Also try to eat more bananas.|`|ROdHsYVAaa	Have you talked to a chiropractor? You could be pinching a nerve as your abdomen (sp?) gets bigger...there are ways of correcting restless leg without medicine.  It definatly sounds like your back is out a little bit...<br>  <br>   There are chiropractors that specialize in pregnant women (I used to see one, she was married to another chiropractor - she was very nice and had 3 healthy kids and had been "adjusted" throughout all of her pregnancies...)  A chiropractor could also give you advice on how to sit or lay to avoid pinching nerves as the baby gets bigger.|`|GAHFiIqSaa	It sounds like RLS, which is really the feeling of a spirit in physical contact with you, and has nothing to do with pregnancy. If so, it will not hurt you.<br>  <br>  When it next occurs hold an open hand near the location of tingling. If you feel the same tingling with your hand, you will be feeling the causative spirit. This is typically an interaction experienced by the saints, and the spirit involved is the Holy Spirit. Consider it a blessing.|`|HXh7u0lEaa	I have it and have had it with my previous pregnancies, my book (What to expect when you're expecting), says the they don't really know what causes it and that there's no real cure/relief for it. They did say you can do leg exercises the same ones you do to relieve cramp but they don't always work.<br>  Sorry not a great answer I was pretty disappointed when I read it too.|`|CJkrXeDgaa	RLS or a bit of sciatica can get pretty annoying during pregnancy.  You're already uncomfortable!  Just make sure that the way you are sitting (or even standing) isn't putting anymore pressure on the tender spots.<br>  When you sit, lean your stomach off of your lap.<br>  When you stand, alternate putting weight on either leg and keep your knees bent.<br>  Try a heating pad when you are at home before bed and sleep with plenty of pillows put wherever you need them to be comfortable.<br>  And make sure you are getting plenty of potassium (bananas, etc) so that this doesn't turn into leg cramps.|`|75c40712ce4c1c9063d61b17387937f9aa	it sucks, but theres nothing you can really do about it. i have RLS without being pregnant and being pregnant made it MUCH worse. i went to my Dr to see what i could do. she told me that while i was pregnant, that no, there wasn't anythin she could saftely give me. there are alot of suggestions on how to relax yourself, warm bath, some say calcium helps, i found that only tylonal would help, but not much at all. i feel for ya, its sucks!|`|e1V8YWeSaa	i think its normal.  im 15 weeks preg and i get tingling sensations too.  but i get them when i sit or lay down improperly.  when a women gets pregnant theres so much things that changes our bodies it not even funny.  but if its preventing you from sleeping you should speak to aDoctorr. try sleeping with pillows under your legs. or put heat wraps on them.  good luck
ev8ZZYx2aa	good information - thanks for sharing|`|twHXC9Draa	wow im a guy and just answering ?s but that is pretty interesting i didnt know that ultra sound was using radiation mods ill tell my fianceeeeeeee she is going to have a baby in 2 months so............. thanks!^_^|`|7mKNHl2zaa	nice to know|`|p0prrzf2aa	i had no idea : /<br>  <br>  is it the same with the dr's doppler and ultrasound machines?<br>  <br>  <br>  & i was thinking about getting 1 too, glad i didn't!|`|jgtfWjE4aa	interesting...
IGcS9K62aa	Pregnancy symptoms can be explained away. <br>  <br>  Wait for your period. If it doesn't come take a test. Do it in the morning when your hormone levels are the highest. Just wait until it gets here though.. some test do say they can predict pregnancy 5 days before your missed period.. however at that point they're only 80% accurate vs 98-99% when you actually miss your period. Its hard to wait-- but its for the best!|`|a59e66ccd067c54ffacd8913af678510aa	you could be pregnant, take a test in the morning
L7uz5Xmzaa	SOB! Aw honey, that was so sweet. I would not change a thing. If you or Nicole want to chat email me a Yahoo with my screen name. Trust me, you are very mature for your ages, God will certainly bless you for the Gift you are giving someone.|`|AA11763588	Looks good to me. <br>  <br>  Good luck to both of you!|`|SWQyuVzGaa	wow.... you guys are brave for adoption but if you think that its what is best for you both then go for it... i just went through the same thing.... i wrote my mom an email....pretty much in the same way except that i am keeping my baby... talk it over with them or email this leter it all looks good to me! dont be scared if your parents are anything like mine they will understand my parents are very high class religious by the book parents...and since your already 5 months....i bet your mom already knows is just waiting for you to tell her....she is going to be more upset that for 5 months you have tried hiding it... i told my mom at 6 weeks pregnant... but anything is better then before you go into labor! good luck you guys and dont be scared god puts obstacles in everyones lives and how you handle them and look back on them makes you be the person you are in your future! good luck!|`|Asrxi2ZQaa	To me...Sounds golden. Wish i would have thought about that before i told my parents. Then again i am 20, pregnant and married. (married before pregnant 1 year and a half) Good luck and sounds good!!! Best wishes and Congrats!!!!|`|mgiJVjaKaa	I think it's good as is. I would personally want to tell my parents in person, although I can understand a letter helps you get everything out there and be as "soft" a blow as possible. <br>  <br>  I hope her parents are supportive of you guys and your choices!|`|vFBOFecQaa	I just want to say that the letter is wonderful and I commend you for being a man and being there for your girlfriend.  I wish you both the best of luck and stay strong!|`|41U6UBu5aa	The letter is great. But I must say, this is why they need to teach safe sex in school. If they dont teach it, people dont learn.|`|tp6t4QrDaa	It is incredible. :) Hope whoever reads this has to say.. You've done a wonderful job :) <br>  God Bless.<br>  Good luck on what happens.|`|sXpGfHWWaa	Thats way to long no one is gonna read that.|`|OHmVVB9Iaa	wow, that is perfect<br>  good luck to both of you<br>  may god bless you|`|4Cq268Ofaa	You may have heard this, but I think that the both of you were grown and mature enough to lay down together and create this life. You both should be adults and sit down with her parents to let them know.  I was 15 when I found out I was pregnant with my first son and I had to tell my parents myself. It is not as bad as you think it is. I think what is going to be most upsetting is waiting this long to tell her parents. I am now 29 with 5 boys. 13,11,6,4,and 2. I love them very much. I owned up to my responsibility and my kids have everything they could ever ask for. I think adoption is great, IF you really really cannot take care for this baby. Otherwise I think it is a cop-out. Who's to say that she has this baby and you give him/her up. That she will not become pregnant again, and then what? I also can safely assume that there has not been any prenatal care for this young lady and her baby. I think you both should own up to what you have created. Having a baby does not stop you from being successful. I wish you both the best.|`|caWdGcvgaa	Sounds like a good letter to me. I think it shows a lot of maturity to admit that you are not in a place in your life to raise a baby, and there are tons of people out there who want children more than anything and they are not able to have them, so kudos to the two of you for making a responsible and informed decision.  I wish you the best of luck in all you do in life!|`|w1UTuYDHaa	Very Good letter but I would take out the part about looking at it as a positive way and putting it up for adoption.  Like you said you were irresponsible and it was a mistake I am sure people do not intentionally have babies to give it to a family with none.
FEhmNTL2aa	Well at times kids can take things too seriously, but on the other hand I can see why that comment would hurt him.  He probably tries really hard in football and she shot him down with that comment.  Easy solution, call the mom back and mend things and then tell your son it's his choice whether or not he goes over there anymore.|`|Xb6Tso2baa	i know one time i got int a fight with my friend and my friends mom called and said "Yes its really affecting her and blah blah blah" and my mom kinda thought wtf wy wpuld she call me. I think you should call her in a day or somthing. :D<br>  I hope i helped!|`|BRT2teSqaa	Why is this a question?  This is so stupid.  She probably just wants to talk to you to make sure you know that she isnt mistreating your son.  Perfectly reasonable for her to call you.|`|949517353a847c7e512b934758a0b451aa	you should call her back and ask her y she thinks that your son thinks that she hates him she must have did something to him|`|JMEIP6G5aa	She probably feels bad, I think she doesn't want you to think anything bad of her, just call her back saying you are returning her call.|`|AA10943329	No mother wants a kid to think you don't like them when you. Call her back and just tell her thanks for the call, you know your son is sensitive and it will be good for him to hear she likes him as you have been telling him that for ages|`|prqrQcd1aa	She is probably thinking that you don't like her now because your son has said that she hates him. I'd call her back and see if she is sincere or not, it is kinda odd for a mother to call and act like that on a message! Why did your son say that to begin with? Maybe call her back and see what actually is going on!
kIad9ffRaa	Your best bet would be with classics. Something that grips their imagination. That is constructive and meaning full. I would recommend any of these books: Anne of Green Gables, Red Badge of Courage, the Janette Oke books, Black Beauty, Call of the Wild, Tale of Two Cities, Moby Dick, 2000 Leagues Under the Sea, Uncle Tom's Cabin, the Laura Ingalls Wilder series, the Sugar Creek Gang series, Boxcar Children series, Heart of the Wilderness( mostly for a girl). That should be a start!<br>  Hope that helps.|`|44op1EWmaa	-The Princess Diaries series.<br>  -I had to read a book called, "Shabanu, Daughter of the wind" in a literature class, its a good book.<br>  -Roald Dahl books.|`|zETO5Kv1aa	the outsiders <br>  of mice and men|`|aOCfLAJJaa	H.I.V.E<br>  <br>  It stands for "Higher Institute of Villainous Education".<br>  <br>  It can get a bit technical at some times, but the story is really good!<br>  <br>  There's 3 books out and 1 more in September.|`|TgfSqo9maa	Lola Rose by Jacqueline Wilson is a really good book. Most of Jacqueline Wilson's books are good, and you can relate to the characters in them.<br>  <br>  Kelly|`|V6EgDitqaa	My sister read "The Nobodies" in 4th grade, but it's <br>  alright for an 11-13 year old. I also suggest "So B. It". <br>  It's a fantastic book.|`|BRT2teSqaa	Maniac Magee<br>  The Outsiders|`|gl4DFLVGaa	Hmm...Try Judy Blume books. Those are good for every age!|`|0kIwehVbaa	carl hiaasen books. They"re great. :)
vGbUxAoJaa	First of all, i can't believe these doctors told you that what he has could be deadly, and didn't admit him into the hospital until they found out for sure what he had!!! You have to find out what's wrong with him. That's why they have doctors, so they can run tests. Don't let the doctors tell you they don't know. If it were me, i'd make an appearance 3 or 4 times a day until the hospital staff got so sick of seeing me that they took me seriously and found out what was wrong with my son!|`|0jQcNWITaa	No one here is going to be able to tell you what is wrong with him. Even Doctors like to be in the same room with the sick person. Have you taken the child to the emergency room? Think I would. This could be everything from germs to a very severe allergy.<br>  Good luck to you.|`|2NGCD7y2aa	This is an experience of a child with some infection, & her symptoms sound a lot like your son's:<br>  <br>  'Payton's Website'<br>  Tuesday, December 27, 2005 4:08 PM CST   <br>  to   Monday, January 2, 2006 9:58 AM CST   <br>  <a href="http://caringbridge.org/wi/paytonelizabeth/history.htm" rel="nofollow">http://caringbridge.org/wi/paytonelizabe...</a>|`|DwFDF0A2aa	If you have seen five different doctors, I would assume that this has been going on for quite awhile.  I would give him some motrin and alternate that with tylenol to take his fever down.  Put a luke warm towel on his body to bring down his fever and then take him to the emergency room.  If your motherly instincts are telling you that he might DIE, get him to the ER and have them do tests on him. <br>  Good luck, I am so sorry your little guy isn't feeling well.|`|IJ2QhfKEaa	take him to emergency instead of the drs cuz then they will admit him for tests. dont waste time,,, take him. you will never forgive yourself if he was to die whilst you sitting on the computer trying for answers off ppl who really cant help you|`|75c40712ce4c1c9063d61b17387937f9aa	kinda sounds like the flu. i would think if you took him to the hospital that they would have to admit him and do some tests if he was that bad off.|`|WgdduoRDaa	You need to take him to a hospital before it gets worse. What are you doing on the computer wasting your time asking strangers when you should be taking care of this.
9OmQXGMLaa	You are not alone! I am a single mother also, and I've felt much of what you're feeling now at one point or another. <br>  <br>  At times, I felt like she completely took away my social life and my freedom all at once. I knew it was not her fault but sometimes I felt guilty because I knew that in some way I was taking it out on her. My downs usually happened when something else in my life wasn't going my way, like when she would keep me up all night. I'd think of all my friends who could sleep all they wanted and go out every night of the week while I sat at home. I was really pissed at them..lol! And yes, there were times I decided I just didn't want to be a mother anymore, but you jsut take one day at a time and choose your battles. Sometimes we make things harder than they have to be! If I'm having a rotten day and my child says "Hey mom, I really don't want to wear socks today"..I'll say ok! It's really just not worth making both our days worse and ..why not? So she doesnt' want to wear socks! One day at a time. I still remember right after she was born and I was completely overwhelmed and unbelievable depressed and my mom said "This, too, shall pass." Everytime my daughter is ill or going through a rotten phase, I tell myself this and it's just so true and helpful to realize.<br>  <br>  My daughter is nearly 4, and honestly, there are still days that I regret becoming a single mother, but I don't regret my daughter. I love her dearly and I've just accepted my life as what it is. When I decided to become a mother, I decided to sacrifice alot of the things I was able to do before she came along. <br>  <br>  ANYWAY, don't feel like crap. Don't apologize for your feelings, but please, get help. Talk to someone. If you can't afford or have access to professional help, talk to a close friend or parent. The best thing you can do for you and your child is to get help. Feel free to email me if you'd like, and good luck.|`|itC6iSgzaa	Regardless of whether or not it is 'right' or 'wrong' to want to give your daughter away, look out for her best interest. I respect you for considering the fact that she simply can't keep up with the lifestyle that you want to live. Feeling like crap is normal. It simply shows that you have compassion. What may be destroying her is a mother who doesn't want her. You know your situation better that I do, but it seems as though you may not be fit to nurture her. I go to school with tons of kids whose parents seem to love them, but have little or no way to care for them. Depending on how serious the circumstaces are, she may be harmed by living with you. GIVING HER AWAY seems sketchy. There are many infertile etc. couples and singles out there who would die for a child. You should seek therapy to get your priorities straight.|`|q0JTN9QAaa	Should have took care of it 6 years ago.  If you gave her away then it would not have messed her up in the head like it would if you give her away now.<br>  <br>  I'm sure you got a raw deal from your baby daddy and all but if you have time to date you have more time than I have and I am married to my babies mom.  We only have one kid and nobody to baby sit so don't feel that bad.<br>  <br>  Put off dating for a while.  You don't need a man you just want one.  It will be easier to date when she is lets say 13 and can watch herself for 2 or 3 hours and go to sleep overs.  I would not bring men in and out of her life at that age because it can be just as damaging as if you put her up for adoption.|`|ZZzQLjaKaa	You have the signs of clinical depression, you should see someone immediately for the sake of your child and yourself. You deserve to feel well.|`|4NiGsqnCaa	you should love your daughter and keep her...it isn't normal to want to give her away, you are probably just stressed out and it seems like too much to handle at the moment. don't give up on her!|`|CiFR2xuBaa	It is normal to have these feelings, but keep in mind that she didn't ask to be here. You chose to "do the nasty" and that's what comes along with it. I was a single mother and I had these feelings, but I came to realize that even though my life changed drastically, my daughter is a blessing to me. I love her with all my heart and could never think of giving her up. If you give her up, you will regret it in the end. She is no one else's responsibility but yours and even though you didn't make her by yourself, sometimes we have to live with the fact that we're the ones who chose deadbeats to father our children.|`|tjNJAn75aa	its not normal but yes people do sometimes feel like this. Parenthood doesn't come without restrictions but as they get older its gets easier. You have a responsibility as her parent and trying not to sound too mean, you need to suck it up and deal with it. A child can be the best thing to ever happen to you. You're looking at it all the wrong way. Stop dating for a while and concentrate on your daughter. Giving yourself time will help you sort you situation out and help you spend more time with your daughter and properly bond with her. After that you may just be in a better frame of mind to choose a man who is right for you. Concentrate on you and your daughters relationship and everything will get easier after that. Don't give up on her, you'll regret it in years to come. You can get help too. Speak to your doctor about counselling if you can. xx|`|949517353a847c7e512b934758a0b451aa	i think you want to do it for the wrongs reason and your daughter will hate you for it if i was her i would. i kno u cant help the way you feel but i think there are ways to get help. my son's father isnt there and i work my son goes to daycare there are programs that will help pay for it or a babysitter there is help out there but u have to be willing to help urself|`|IJ2QhfKEaa	no ir is def no normal. get some help about this topic. dont ever ever ever give up on your child. it is the worst thing a person could do.|`|170fmwTXaa	dont you have any family that could help with your daughter once in a while so you can get a break? if not, do you have a church or organization in your town for unwed mothers? check google for anything in your area. youd be surprised how many people are out there with the same feelings and hardships. dont give your daughter up, unless you feel you could become a danger to her. trust me when i say children are a constant source of love if you can just look at what you have instead of what you think you dont have. never the less you need to seek counseling and get some help so you can be the best parent possible for your little girl. Dont give up|`|DwFDF0A2aa	It seems like these feelings are something you should really listen to.  You seem depressed and resentful about things that you are able to change: ex: your body, relationships.  <br>  You cannot give your child away.  She is six years old and needs you.  I think you need to seek counseling and possibly start working out.  I would also suggest that you start bringing your child to after school care so that you can have some time to yourself.  <br>  If you can't find anyone to babysit her, go to a resource center in your neighborhood.  People are out there to help you in your time of need.  You are sacrificing EVERYTHING to raise your daughter, but you will never forgive yourself if you give her up.  She is too old and will only go from foster home to foster home.  Her life will go down the tubes.<br>  As for men, I think you might need to work on your own self esteem, concerning your body, so that you can feel more confident towards men.  The right man will come along, but remember that you are all that your daughter has and if you have made it this long, you must be doing something right! <br>  I know this is a long answer, but I really feel for you and your situation.  Please get some support and confide in your local resource centers so that you can have some back up.  Good luck!|`|YCr7zcIHaa	My opinion is that 6 year old should not be sacrificed. If you wanted to give her up, you should have done that before she got old enough to create a bond with you. Childbearing does ruin your body and any man who truly loves you will look past that saggy, wrinkly tummy. I don't want to be rude but it kinda seems to me you are being a bit selfish and need to get over it. You should have taken care of this a long time ago. There are so many people in this world who would have loved to have a baby, and your complaining about it. I don't believe in abortions, but if I felt this way about having a baby, I would have to think twice.
uYRPFlJWaa	I like how you think!<br>  <br>  With that you may want to say something like, "In lieu of gifts, we request your attendance and a homemade card!"|`|75c40712ce4c1c9063d61b17387937f9aa	you could put on the invite that the kids could bring a gift to donate to a local charity. they could give the gift of money for her bank account. they could hand make the gifts they bring. they could bring a gift to share, if you want to give gifts to your guests, then have everyone bring a unisex toy and before they leave, let the kids pick a different wrapped gift then what they brought. good luck:)|`|WgdduoRDaa	Say something like, you are blessed to have all you need and that if they still wish to bring something you may bring canned goods or stuff to donate to charity.|`|vR4k5iVCaa	i mean honestly you could put on the invites no gifts please.  your appearance will be the greatest gift you could give this year|`|5RtRppZaaa	You could say "instead of gifts this year "Ashley" would love homemade cards and to give you a gift instead!    Please reciprocate her offering!"|`|3F8f1SoQaa	why not do a party where the gifts are actually for a charity? Every once in a while I see a news story about a kid who asks that people bring donations for the local food bank, pet shelter, etc<br>  <br>  as for the wording on the invite you could say something along the lines of " X would like all her friends to bring donations for Y instead of presents for her this year"|`|IJ2QhfKEaa	good on you for oyur idea, very selfless. just write on the invite that you prefer no gifts. the 1st person who answered had a good idea. explain to the kid though thay wont be getting anything so she wont get upset

My husband is the same way I am actually in the hospital with pregnancy problems now and he will come up for a few mins and then be bored and leave to go find something at the house too do. All I can say is call call call.

But i Bet ya it would work!|`|vFBOFecQaa	I'm very sorry that he's not responding to your phone calls.  Pregnancy is a very serious thing, and I'm wondering if he's trying to deal with his emotions by avoiding coming home.  I know you've probably sat down and talked to him about it, but if you haven't make sure to express your concerns.  <br>  <br>  Scaring might not be the best tactic because it could result in excess medical bills (from going to the doctor with a fake emergency) or him not trusting you if he finds out you were faking something to scare him.

You have to go to court and everything. It will make you guys grow way farther apart. But you can always do counseling at the end of her stay. Or you can just make her go on weekends. So there's a time when she won't be doing anything. You can put a separate alarm clock in your room for her curfew during the week and if she's not home by the time that alarm goes off tell her that's another weekend added to her going to juvenile hall. Or if she messes with it another weekend of juvenile hall. Trust me teens LOVE there weekends and that is when we do most stuff.

I cried when I saw the result of the test and each time it said positive. I told my fiancee ( who asked me to marry him before we knew I was expecting) who also being 18 freaked.

If you were to get pregnant during that time, your due date would be Thursday, November 26, 2009. <br>  Of course, you may not conceive right away. But here's good news: 85 percent of couples who simply stop using birth control conceive within a year. You'll only increase your chances by knowing your fertile periods. <br>  <br>  Here are the days you're most likely to be fertile over the next five months -- as well as prospective due dates if you conceive.

So if you really are having a 28 day cycle, you should be ovulating around 3/3 - 3/7.  I answered in another one of your questions how to know when you're fertile though.  Check out the book below. You know when you're about to ovulate based on your cervical fluid.  As you get closer, it becomes more like egg whites.  You can also take your temperature.  When you ovulate, it raises about .5 degrees.  Take it first thing in the morning before getting out of bed.

Hmmm, sometimes it is best to just lead by example... Show her how you are supoce to act and be as a person. Talk to her about her problems if she comes to you for advice, and see if maybe she will talk to someone from school to get some counseling, sounds like she has been through a lot and is just acting this way to deal with it all. <br>  Also maybe talk to her father about these things, he may not know they are going on. If she gets mad at you now, which she proabally will, she will thank you later on in life. I know it doesn't seem that way now, but trust me. I am the oldest of 5 kids, i know how these things work.

AA11763588	Take another test in 5 days. If it is trying to show a positive then you don't have enough HcG hormones in your system. Wait and let them build up and try again.|`|4hNdYjjraa	how long did you leave the test before this line appeared. I do see the fatal line. I had a negative test before i got positive and after 6 Min's the positive line faintly appears and i showed someone at the chemist and told them it was a no but it showed up after an extra min. she said almost all turn positive after 10 Min's and it was probably just that. Your test looks just like mine did. But after i pissed the period for two weeks i took it again and it was a positive with a Dark line. so i was preg though... bit confusing.

The only other thing that I can say, and I am not an expert, so I don't know if this would be possible, but I don't know if the hormone changes from being on the pill the way you did it with skipping a period, I don't know if that can effect a home pregnancy test.  I would call the doctor so you can take a blood test because I know it's bad to keep taking the pill daily if you are indeed pregnant.|`|OVMb4V7Maa	Yea, I think you're pregnant, but it's very early in the pregnancy, meaning you don't have as many pregnancy hormones, so there was a fainter line.|`|AA11471943	def pregnant!!! any line (no matter how faint) in the second window means the test has detected the pregnancy hormone. how dark it is can depend on how far along you are!<br>  congratulations.|`|twHXC9Draa	cho are def preg grl<br>  lol just kidding about the speech part but yah you are having a baby!<br>  i hope that you are exited you better be if you arent then ill be watching you!|`|qQJdi0p1aa	stop your birth control!! you just might be prego.... wait a few more days and re- take your test....good luck honey!|`|2448af06b59df00dd8a1a3ac6d057c75aa	u r pregoo just very ealry

5XFGNmVuaa	I assume that you're asking about the government paying for it.  While I do believe that caretakers should be well compensated for their work, it needs to be paid for by either the grandmother or the rest of the family pitching in.  It's simply not the taxpayers' responsibility to be paying for her when she's had an entire lifetime to prepare for these golden years, and we're certainly not responsible for paying him to raise his kids.  Your only option should be to call a family meeting to arrange for each member to contribute to his salary, or to agree on an amount to be paid for with her life insurance, when it becomes available.  Make it clear that this is compensation for her care and is in addition to his share of any inheritance.|`|pXSKSS3daa	If he got laid off can't he file for unemployment?<br>  <br>  Here is a link I found when I googled this(compensation for members staying hom to take care of elderly relatives). I'm not totally sure if it will help out or not, though: <a href="http://online.wsj.com/article/SB123197145248583055.html" rel="nofollow">http://online.wsj.com/article/SB12319714...</a><br>  <br>  I'm sure a nursing home or even hospital could steer you in the right direction as to who to contact.|`|IGcS9K62aa	California has Paid Family Leave. You can get some supplemental income for taking care of a sick relative. Call the IL Department of Labor (that's who governs the Family Medical Leave Act for the US gov). If you call your states they may be able to direct you to programs. Your hubby should be able to draw unemployment. I'd also look into getting your grandmother a "worker". In CA counties cover helpers for individuals who need it. It can be anyone--even a family member. Call your local department of health and human services. If there is a program like that available in your state and county they will know or be able to direct you!
