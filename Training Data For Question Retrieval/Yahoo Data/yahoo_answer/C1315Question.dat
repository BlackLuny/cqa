20060712172820AA4EMHn	Science & Mathematics;Physics	Does time not exist on the subatomic level? Is this why cause & effect don't apply to quantum electrodynamics?	It's been said that there is a direct link between gravity and time (think of Einstein saying that gravity warps space/time).   But, it's been said that gravity does not apply at the subatomic level, or it is so weak that it can be ignored.  Does this mean time can be ignored too?   Also, it's been said that subatomic particles are made of standing electromagnetic waves (light), which move at the speed of light.  But, at the speed of light, time stops.     If time doesn't apply, or if time is stopped on the scale of subatomic particles made of standing electromagnetic waves - Is this why cause and effect does not apply on the subatomic level?  Is this why you can't predict exactly where an electron will be, but you can only give the probability of where it will be?  Is this why a quantum bit can be ON, and OFF, both at the same time, or somewhere in between?

I start knowing:      dp/dz = 2*A*z + B   p(z) = 0 @ z = L/2 or z = -L/2      I integrate dp/dz to get:      p(z) = A*z^2 + B*z + C      And then I'm having a hard time using the initial conditions of p(z) = 0 @ z = L/2 or z = -L/2 to find C.

20070615104703AA8KDNs	Science & Mathematics;Other - Science	Secondo voi esiste il destino? Un'ipotesi potrebbe essere questa...?	Ovvero.. Dal big bang a oggi l'entropia è sempre aumentata, fino a che inevitabilmente sarà tale da aver reso inutilizzabile ogni energia. Se al termine di tale processo l'entropia seguisse il processo inverso (e cioè anke il tempo scorresse al contrario fino al ritorno alla massa iniziale del big bang) infinite volte, si spiegherebbero molte cose. Conseguenza di questo sarebbe che noi involontariamente faremmo le stesse cose (ora con il tempo che scorre in un verso, ora al contrario).. Spero di essermi spiegato. Secondo questa ipotesi quindi esisterebbe il destino, infatti noi saremmo prigionieri di un susseguirsi di fatti già stabiliti e indipendenti dalla nostra volontà, ma apparentemente frutto di libera scelta. e il tutto fino alla fine dei tempi. CAPITO?? CHIARO? Se non avete inteso chiedete pure..      P.S. Questa ipotesi mi sembra molto sconcertante....

20090131101540AAObMz7	Science & Mathematics;Physics	Physics tuning fork lab?	You are conducting an experiment where you strike a tuning fork and hold it above a column of water. You raise and lower the fork to determine the location that causes the loudest resonance to sound. You then measure the distance from the top of the column to the water level. This represents the length of the tube for the equation:    f = nv/4L.      You must calculate the speed of the wave using this equation. The "length of the tube" is 0.25 m. n = 1. The speed comes out to be 341.3 m/s, which is also the frequency. WHY is the frequency 341.3?      And...   How would using a different tuning fork affect your data?

A ring of material orbits this massive object; the ring has a diameter of about 18.0  light years and an orbital speed of about 240 km/s.      a) Determine the mass of the massive object at the center of the Milky Way galaxy. Give your answer in kilograms. Take the gravitational constant to be (6.673x10^-11N*m^2/kg^2)*(1 light year) =9.461x10^15m   b) Give your answer in solar masses (one solar mass is the mass of the sun). Take the mass of the sun to be 1.99x10^30kg   c) Many astronomers believe that the massive object at the center of the Milky Way galaxy is a black hole. If so, what must the Schwarzschild radius of this black hole be? Take the speed of light to be 3.00x10^8 m/s

If you'll notice, the tornado warning areas on weather maps are always shaped like a rhombus.  Always.  No exceptions.  Does anyone know WHY this is?      Before you attempt to answer, let me put an end to a common misconception:  these areas shown on maps have absolutely, 100% NOTHING to do with counties.  Counties come in all shapes and sizes, but tornado warnings are ALWAYS in the shape of a slanted rhombus.

Then we watched a video by Nasa about them going into space and landing on the moon.   But before that I watched a documentary about Nasa going to the Moon and it all being a huge hoax. That back then they didn't have enough technology that it just was not possible, and that it was all filmed in the Nevada Desert. Apparently there is no atmosphere on the moon and that there basically is no wind, but why did the American Flag flutter in the wind? And why, whenever they looked up, there was no stars? Clearly if we can see stars,  obviously on the moon you will see stars!   Thanks [:

I don't know if this is going on globally, but here in the states, USA there have been many sightings in the night sky. Can someone that knows about stars and planets explain to me what it is that people are seeing? The reason this has picked my interest is because of what I saw last mon. night exactly a week an a half ago there was a bright sphere of some sort, like a star that was red and orange, and it was pretty big enough to catch my eye. Really cool! It didn't last long though, it slowly disappeared. Where I live you can see so many stars at night, especially when It's cold, and clear. I thought it might have been the two satellites that collided, but not sure? I would love it if someone could explain, or tell me what I saw? Please don't say little green men..LOL!

20090131133606AAMK0ia	Science & Mathematics;Mathematics	You're opinion welcome -- what is wrong with me?	Here's my problem -- and I welcome your comments and suggestions.      I've taken just about every math class you can take. Graduated from college several years ago. I consider myself a pretty good math person -- but not the best. I would say average.      But I can't tell you the number of times that I answer a question -- check it over carefully for mistakes -- find none -- click send -- and all of a suddend I notice not one mistake, but several! And they are the dumest mistakes ever!      Good example: Yesterday I answered a question: "Factor f(x)=6x^2-9 using the quadratic formula."      So I gave this detailed answer so the person would know how to use the quad formula, etc. Checked it over -- it was perfect!      Then a fellow Yahoo Answers person was kind enough to send me an email -- suggesting I edit my answer. Why? I had actually CHANGED the function to f(x)=6x^2-9x and that little added "x" made a major difference.      I do this all the time and not just on Yahoo. I am a HORRIBLE test taker -- not because I don't know the material or because I rush through -- but for some reason my mind just doesn't see my stupid mistakes.      Does this happen to you? Comments? Suggestions?      Thanks!!!

20090131143022AAS66Xx	Science & Mathematics;Physics	An Athlete throws a basketball toward the east?	(a)An Athlete throws a basketball toward the east, with initiall speed 10.6m/s at an angle of 55.0degreess above the horizontal. just as the basketball reaches the highest point of it trajectory, it hits an eagle(the mascot of the opposing team) flying horizontally west. the ball bounces back horizontally west with 1.50 times the speed it had just before their collision. How far behind the player who threw it does the ball land?(b) This situation is not covered in the rule book so the officials turn the clock back to repeat this part of the game. The player throws the ball in the same way. The eagle isthoroughlyy annoyed and this time intercepts the ball so that at the same point in its trajectory the ball again bounces from the birds beak with 1.50 times it impact speed, moving west at some nonzero angle with the horizontal. Now the ball hits the players head at the same location where her hands had released it. Is the angle necessarily negative(below the horizontal) or could it be either? Give a convincing  argument, either mathematical or conceptual, for your answer.
