Try moving the stud around in your nose awhile to open the hole up and it will be painfully but... pull....and hold your nose with the other hand..

The Suave copycat of Shaper is pretty good.|`|2RzOqHObaa	go to www.myspace.com/codydcshoes|`|GqVaHA7Iaa	Remember to spray hairspray on the underside of the curl to keep the volume, and the exposed portion of your hair you touch will still feel soft.|`|1DT7OUuHaa	It's a bit pricey but it is so so so worth it and most drugstores carry it!  It's "Samy Fast Style" and what it's a gel and spray in one and it adds tons of volume and keeps your hair really nice and soft and full and it STAYS that way all day!  Just try it once and see what you think.  Walgreens carries it for sure at $14.99 although it might be on sale.  Let me know what you think!  I have really long thick wavy hair that just kinda hangs there because it's so thick and long and it gives it all this volume without being all sticky and it actually stays that way.

It sounds crazy, but it works, its really cute if you do a base of black then do green, orange, pink, and blue dots. Extremely cute. Good luck.|`|MElM0XDCaa	nail polish pens.  Sally Hansen and Nic by OPI make them, and they come in a lot of different colors.  They all cost under $10, and they can be bought at WalMart and CVS.  They have the ease of a pen, so you are more in control of the dots.  Nic's Sticks come in a lot more colors than the Sally Hansen brand, though.  You can always go to the sally hansen or OPI websites to check them out for yourself.  Hope this helps.  Good luck|`|hJagdJIQaa	I use the point of a pen.

4vqzkIr4aa	It is actually called Love Hate Tattoos. It is named after the owners bar Love Hate. There is shop there in that location called Miami Ink but they only sale Miami Ink apparel.    I would not waste my time or money in that overrated hoopla of a joint. There is a place just north of there in Hollywood, FL called Twisted Heart Custom Tattoo. Joe, the owner, is by far better that any of those fad frenzied sale-outs on that show. And the would be 1/3 the price.|`|zzkmdusEaa	Yeah, it will actually take a long time. You can fly down there (Its actually called "Love Hate Tattoos", the shop "Miami Ink" is a merchandise store.) and get your tattoo started, but then you will have to heal up, let the scabs fall and go back, and that will most likely be weeks later. I take it you mean 3/4 as in 3/4 sleeve? Yeah it probably isn't a good idea, unless you don't mind staying in Miami for quite awhile, longer than a regular holiday. What you could do instead is fly down to Miami, visit your dad, and get the drawing of your sleeve down that way it is ready to stencil for when you get a tattoo.|`|nnKtP60Oaa	it depends on how long u can do a sitting....give them a call....    1344 Washington Ave  Miami Beach, FL 33139  (305) 531-4556|`|YIplumj8aa	I assume by 3/4 you mean 3/4 sleeve.  If that's the case then that is going to take several sessions over an extended period of time.  You might be able to do a sitting for a few  hours (3-4) in one day - that may cover a bicep tattoo (depending on how big you want it) but a 3/4 sleeve tattoo will definitely not be done in one sitting.  For that you will need several sittings of 3-4 hours each.  And after each one, you will have to wait until the tattoo is completely healed before you can continue with the rest of it.|`|4YZBPfhRaa	eww :/ miami ink suckss boo :/

zhzJoZ26aa	It's AMAZING! I bought it about 3 weeks ago and it makes my lashes so long.|`|2ZtKyUoLaa	i heard its great    i like Lash Blast the best though|`|MElM0XDCaa	In late 2008, Maybelline New York introduced 'Lash Stiletto' mascara; the name refers to the length and height of the stiletto heel, thus insinuating that it can make your lashes stand out long, too.  It also includes a hint of shimmer and it is a lengthening mascara.    Since I am a Cover Girl devotee, I reccomend that you buy the new Lash Blast Luxe by CG.  Whereas Maybelline Stiletto only comes with a black shimmer, Lash Blast Luxe comes in four(!) different, subtle shades of shimmer, including black with shimmer, black with blue shimmer, black with green shimmer and black with burgundy shimmer.  Aside from having a better variety of colors, Lash Blast works as a thickening AND lengthening mascara, so it really makes your eyes pop.  Plus, depending on your eye color, picking the right shade of Lash Blast can make your eyes look amazing.  Finally, I recommend Lash Blast Luxe b/c it's slightly cheaper than Stiletto Lash (Lash Blast costs about $7 or $8 on avg., whereas Stiletto Lash costs $9-$10).    I hope this helps you out|`|A7ovwP94aa	Iam dying to try that as someone said it was great|`|VBYvj7Abaa	its the best
js2TUHFdaa	I have used the brand ION in the past, you can find this at sallys..usually only about 99 cents per pack..and it will last you a few washes. OR for a DIY deep condition...wet your hair in the tub, and put ONLY conditioner on it, then put a shower cap on..covering your whole head..and blowdry your head for about 5 minutes. it works i've tried it! it will NOT make you oily.

60c7b85533ff654ef788c2cbd51c8788aa	The "permanency" of your swollen lip is probably due to internal scarring, that is extra skin or mark left after a surface injury or wound has healed.    To remove it probably would require some minor plastic surgery otherwise there's not much you can do, this is how the body reacted to heal the wound although trying one of those "wrinkle creams" which shrinks the skin to remove wrinkles might be worth a try.  Go to a Cosmetics store and talk to an experienced clerk who might suggest one of their creams which, if it did work to some extent, would not be a permanent cure but something you'd need to apply on a daily basis until you were able to have a surgical treatment which would take care of it once and for all.|`|1ImZoSaUaa	well i would pray hope for hte best or try any facial cream dats wat i wuld do

Make sure that you straighten your hair in sections rather then using big chunks at a time. If that doesn't work, there are definitely sprays that you can use to keep your hair straight. If you use hair gel, then your hair won't look natural. Hope this helps.|`|aEpPt9koaa	You need a better flat iron and make sure you are doing small sections when u flat iron your hair.

NDQS5HJyaa	Lice are actually more attracted to freshly washed hair. The oils from not washing prevents lice, I think.

acfd7907edce364d509ad8e43b8f4f0faa	What exactly does your school allow? You can always wear natural face makeup, such as blush, foundation, powder, etc. and I'm sure the school officials wouldn't know. It would cover any face flaws and not make you look like a "troll" As for eye makeup, it's probably best to keep that natural, as well. Does your school allow any makeup at all? Or just not dark makeup? Here's a few natural eye makeup photos. <br>  <a href="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/_AyW8XkSQfVc/SAARm1c4HJI/AAAAAAAACKI/8VDeTN9jaqI/s320/IMG_7200.jpg" rel="nofollow">http://2.bp.blogspot.com/_AyW8XkSQfVc/SA...</a><br>  <a href="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_7KV6h0i6rQ0/SAME2TUM72I/AAAAAAAAC6A/K_HusaYXjNc/S1600-R/Ayumi-Hamasaki-Miss-Understood-370015.jpg" rel="nofollow">http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_7KV6h0i6rQ0/SA...</a><br>  <a href="http://www.asianfashioncity.com/images/beauty-products/contact-lens/black1-before-after.jpg" rel="nofollow">http://www.asianfashioncity.com/images/b...</a><br>  <br>  As for your hair, you don't necessarily need it dyed for it to look emo or scene.

They thought it would bother other students, keeping them off focus, which I thought was stupid. It's not as if everybody is going to be so preoccupied with your hair and not pay attention in class. Middle school kids don't pay attention in class anyways. Good luck with your situation. You'll be out of the school soon enough.

Literally on the line bit under your eyes, no thicker than that and you should be able to get away with that. You could wear black eyeshadow (again, don't layer it on and you should be able to get away with it looking vaguely natural)<br>  My school's pretty strict on makeup too, but there was a girl a couple of years above me (left now) who used to somehow get away with wearing really obvious eye makeup (maybe she just refused to take it off? I don't know)<br>  And anyway, with the hair dye thing, what's the worst they can do? If your parents are fine with you dying your hair, just dye it, then the worst they can do is call your parents or send you home, and then it doesn't make any difference.

However, a good daily multivitamin taken with eating healthy foods will help to keep you nutritionally sound.  Avoid smokey areas, and anything that can over process your hair like blow drying, dying (including highlighting), perming and swimming (in either the ocean or pool water).  It's more about not doing stuff to your hair than it is about doing stuff.      Take a look at your pinky.  The last knuckle is just about how much hair you will grow monthly--a little more in summer and less in winter.      Patience and care is what you're going to need if you want long hair.  A regular trim every 6 weeks is also beneficial to keep the ends clean and decrease any hair breakage.  Good luck!  : )|`|wZYs1Nz6aa	Nothing will actually make your hair grow, but Vitamin B12 and Calcium will promote healthy hair growth.

s63bm0Guaa	hi there.<br>  unfortunately they only way to get rid of the perm is:<br>  1- cut it out<br>  2- get it chemically straightened<br>  3- flat iron as you have been doing<br>  <br>  so no, that solution your friend gave you, will not work. you need to chemically reshape the bonds in your hair to make it straight again.<br>  if anything that solution will keep your hair looking even more curly because the oils condition your hair, and the more conditioned your hair is, the more bounce you'll get to the curls.|`|1O6Yh1esaa	No. A perm permanently changes the shape of the hair by breaking disulfide bonds and resetting them when your hair is around the perm rod. There's no way to get your hair back to its natural texture other than letting it grow out.|`|5rwCUi5Qaa	First, Make sure your hair can withstand this process. If you have brittle hair, it is best you just let it grown out. Otherwise, Make sure to deep condition your air the day before doing as follows:<br>  <br>  When you are ready to straighten your hair, wet your hair and towel dry it. Apply the waving lotion (perming solution) to the wet hair and comb it through your hair using a wide-tooth comb. Be sure to completely saturate all the hair. Depending on the length of your hair, you may need to enlist the aid of a friend. The important thing here is that you be able to comb your hair and allow it to hang straight. If your hair is long, you will want to have a friend combing the hair while you lean back and keep your hair hanging over a deep sink or the bathtub.<br>   <br>         Continue combing the hair with the waving lotion on it for 10 minutes. At this point take a look at the hair and you should see that the curls have relaxed and that the hair hangs straight. If this isn't the case, leave the waving lotion on the hair and keep combing for another 5 minutes, until the curls do relax. Then rinse the waving lotion from the hair using very warm water. Continue rinsing for a full 3 minutes so that you get all the lotion from the hair.<br>   <br>         Once rinsed, use a towel to blot the water from the hair. You can squeeze the hair inside the towel, but don't rub the hair. At this stage you can damage the hair easily. Once the excess water is removed, apply the neutralizer to the hair and comb it through exactly as you did with the waving lotion. Continue combing the neutralizer through the hair for five minutes.<br>   <br>         After five minutes, rinse the neutralizer from the hair using very warm water for a full five minutes. Finish up the rinsing with cool water for another minute. (The cool water helps to close the cuticle layer.) Apply conditioner and rinse it through the hair if desired. The conditioner step us useful to prevent tangles and make combing out the hair before drying easier.<br>   <br>         Once again, use a clean towel to blot away the excess water. Remember to pat and squeeze to remove the water, do not rub. You can allow the hair to finish drying naturally, or use a blow-dryer on the lowest heat and air-flow settings. While drying, use a vented brush to control the hair and keep it smooth.<br>   <br>         This process will remove the permed curls, and give you straighter hair. Be sure to follow up by conditioning your hair every day to restore the moisture and help to reclose the cuticle layer, even if you don't shampoo.

70kh6VSoaa	aww. no you don't need to ask. it's not your mom's vagina. shave it. use shampoo so you don't get razor burn.|`|HR6wT7ojaa	I wouldn't ask your mom. I mean if you two are super close I guess so. Shave downwards the first time. That doesn't give you a super close shave but it helps a lot. Also if you choose to shave upwards after shaving downwards kind of pull up the skin so it's tighter. Just make sure to trim it first and then shave. Be careful!|`|j6PrOaZgaa	just shave it and no u dont have to tell your mom. almost everyone does it when they get older just not at your age as much. so dont tell people about it because they might think its weird to talk about it at your age.|`|fzQIZPCTaa	why would you need to ask your mom? i mean unless she looks at your vag she's never going to know. just shave it like you would your legs -- waxing is too annoying and expensive to keep up at your age. so yep, just shave. don't worry if you get some razor bumps every now and then, they'll go away quickly and are nothing to worry about.|`|YmwzubmFaa	brazillian|`|W1lqSWR7aa	do you like it?if not cut it either chin short or shoulder length|`|2g7JjxWMaa	First trim all the hair with a good pair of scissors or trimmers.<br>  Make sure you have a good razor, a very good razor. Take a hot wash cloth and cover the area to be shaved and let it stay there for a few mins or soak in hot water for a few mins. <br>     Now use a good shave cream that has moisturizers and use plenty of it.<br>    Take your time and use two razors if you think the first one won't do the job. <br>    When you are done shaving rinse the area thoroughly with warm water then splash with cold water.<br>    To avoid razor burn you can use conditioner kind of like a lotion, just use a tiny bit. I always use alcohol though it's just a preference.<br>     Just take your time and be careful of course!<br>  It really is up to you whether you ask mom or not. Are you allowed to shave your legs and underarms? If so than I think that your safe to go ahead because technically it is all pubic hair...<br>   By the way in tropical areas like Southeast Asia it is normal for women to shave all of their pubic hair because it is considered good hygiene just like shaving underarms.|`|c7db39975c64a358eab6a0044a8a7223aa	I wouldn't remove it all, I tired that once and it led to irritation. Like itching and burning. So, I would just trim the bikini line and maybe cut some of the length off for it doesn't curl.

WLuEIwp5aa	You could get it done with a 10g needle and have it stretched right there by the piercer up to 8g.  But you'd have to wait 6-8 months before stretching up to 6g to be sure it's fully healed.  You can't go directly there without literally cutting a chunk of flesh out of your earlobe, and I don't think you want the permanence of that.<br>  <br>  I would personally just go get it pierced 10g, wait 6 months, stretch to 8g, wait 2 months, and stretch to 6g.  6g is probably the size you want, I have flesh tunnels that size and it's about the same as a drinking straw.  If you want to go to 4g, you should wait another two months before going from 6g to 4g.|`|x2DweOpqaa	you need to pierce your ear first with a 18g or 16g. after you pierce it, you should wait a couple months for it to heal before you start the gauging process. when you start the gauging process, you shouldn't go straight to 6g or 4g. you should start with a 10g.|`|0o36t5WSaa	You can get pierced at the size you want, or at least within a few gauges. Dont get a regular piercing because it will take forever to stretch up|`|7bf21413e2e3f54d05c3c67fc6e65a6eaa	they normally pierce you with a 20 or 22 (if you get it by gun at least) an 8 to a 6 is the size that you want. If you want your ear to shrink back to size don't stretch them too fast and don't stretch them past a 0g. Use a lot of lube and once you get up to about 14-12 make sure you wait at least a month sometimes two between stretching it another size. Don't ever force it. If it feels like its ripping then it might actually be and that causes blowouts (it makes it look like an a$$ hole when you take it out lol). Good luck!|`|bAYVSfdJaa	If you want your ears to ever shrink, get pierced at a small size and slowly work your way up to the desired gauge.

0841c7c0f9ce722c1d8e3a20b07fddd5aa	Go to a quality hairdresser as they can advise, if your face is thin or thick your hair should be cut a certain way to complement your face. So good luck|`|7fzpCERXaa	Scene hair style would totally suit you.  You may wanna get either darker highlights or lowlights to go with it though<br>  Try wider bangs too|`|YyKBGfTpaa	u shouldnt cut it its already short! <br>  i think u should just color it a light brown and straighten it and it will look cut maybe with a side bang!<br>  ::::)|`|OfQ5zq1Maa	Your hair looks great the way it is!|`|oA066Stbaa	layers and side bangs definitly.|`|XuT22hD5aa	<a href="http://www.hairfinder.com/haircuts/hairstyle108.jpg" rel="nofollow">http://www.hairfinder.com/haircuts/hairs...</a><br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.totalhair.net/hair-styles/Celebrity-Hairstyles-Women/Kristin-Cavallari/Kristin-Cavallari-010752.jpg" rel="nofollow">http://www.totalhair.net/hair-styles/Cel...</a><br>  <br>  <br>  I think these would look really cute on u hope i helped|`|jsP9C82Vaa	Don't cut it, its cute:D|`|GmghrL4Iaa	i think you need to get extensions .
XmvVy5TVaa	It really shouldn't make a difference.<br>  I am assuming you are a skin type II, and your mom got you the kit for skin type I?<br>  A lot of people will bump up a skin type in the winter (I am not sure what kind of climate you live in though.) When I used to use Clinique, in the winter I went from a III to a II and I was fine.<br>  If you look at the website, you will see reviews of people who are skin type III (combo oily to oily) who use the Clariying Lotion type I (which is what you have) because it is milder, and it evens out rough patches more effectively.|`|spXPpyP0aa	ua|`|2UlLayugaa	It shouldnt <br>  But your prob just betta of exchanging it
TgIMTXPMaa	It depends on the dress. <br>  <br>  I'm assuming you meant for a 15 year old?<br>  <br>  It depends on the material and the dress<br>  <br>  If its for prom, think around the $100 area or more (my bff had hers made for $325)<br>  <br>  If its like a day dress usually less than $100, more like $50
6juV48RWaa	nothing toooo over the top! i do this every weekend, all you need to wear is some cute jeans that make your butt look good, and a super dressy top, like from wet seal or forever 21! straighten your hair and dont forget to accessorize! i throw on my uggs but it doesnt matter what shoes you wear cuz i always kick them off when im running around the party having fun lol.|`|kmAMgkiraa	Wow you're really immature. Getting drunk and partying doesn't make you cool OR gets guys attracted to you. Sorry. :]<br>  <br>  Edit: Or you should check yourself. You're trying to look hot so obviously you're trying to attract guys. And if you weren't trying to be cool you wouldn't care about looking so hot and you wouldn't be drinking in the first place. Get a personality and grow up a little. People can tell when you're trying too hard, which obviously you are posting a question about what you should wear to parties.When it doesn't matter anyways cause you'll be made fun of and end up looking sloppy and trashy.|`|cJQdhGYJaa	dark wash skinny jeans <br>  some peep toe heels <br>  and a solid color or tank top <br>  if you wear a tanktop you could wear a scarve too and <br>  the color just go with your favorite color<br>  hope this helps or is a good idea<br>  GOOD LUCK HAVE FUN!!!!!!!!!!!!!!|`|hg5I1O2xaa	Here's an idea.<br>  <a href="http://www.polyvore.com/cgi/set?id=6762574" rel="nofollow">http://www.polyvore.com/cgi/set?id=67625...</a><br>  <br>  Lol, just having fun!

These things usually blow over and get forgotten about quickly. Or if you can just make a joke about it like saying that you wear them so you can see to avoid dropping the soap, it will all be forgotten.|`|19CRBg1Eaa	/"\<br>                  |\./|<br>                  |   |<br>                  |   |<br>                  |>~<|<br>                  |   |<br>               /'\|   |/'\..<br>           /~\|   |   |   | \<br>          |   =[@]=   |   |  \<br>          |   |   |   |   |   \<br>          | ~   ~   ~   ~ |`   )<br>          |                   /<br>           \                 /<br>            \               /<br>             \    _____    /<br>              |--//''`\--|<br>              | (( +==)) |<br>              |--\_|_//--||`|mbI3LCW0aa	Dont the lenses get foggy?|`|2tn8EALqaa	wow, that is messed up.<br>  I'm not going to lie though, I thought that was weird at first.<br>  I wear glasses for seeing far too, but never in the shower.<br>  <br>  Is it possible you can shower alone?<br>  Sorry but that is the only option-- that or ignore them|`|lTDeZ0Obaa	I don't wear my glasses in the shower. I can't see past the end of my nose, either, without my glasses! But, in the shower don't your glasses get all covered with water obscuring your vision anyway? And, how much do you need to see in the shower? I've really never heard of anyone wearing glasses in the shower, I guess it's a personal preference, but I know it just drives me crazy when it's raining and my glasses get wet! I can't imagine in the shower. Plus, don't they get fogged up in the steam, too? I do think it's kinda' weird, but to each their own!

So I can say from experience that unless you are going to a very confident, very professional (very expensive) hair dresser I wouldn't try it - no matter how good you think it will look.|`|5ZyiHyVhaa	sorry no but a light carmal brown would!!!<br>  answer mine?<br>  <a href="http://au.answers.yahoo.com/question/index;_ylt=AieUgsCVoKeufykBFMucTVng5gt.;_ylv=3?qid=20090222194643AABQ6JC">http://au.answers.yahoo.com/question/ind...</a>|`|OixcAoYxaa	I don't think so.

OGiuTVEfaa	You can go to aeropostale.com and check the sizing chart to be sure. I wear a large in most of hollister tops and I wear a large in aeropostale. Hollister runs much more tight then any other store so you may want to make sure at other stores you don't buy a size too small unless you like your shits super fitted.|`|fzQIZPCTaa	i'm pretty positive aeropostale runs even smaller than hollister. i'd go with a medium. you can always go to aeropostale.com and click on a shirt you like and then check the size chart (inches vs. size) and do the same at hollisterco.com|`|BspjUTP0aa	Hollister runs small so I would get a Large there but for me i wear a large at aeropostale but a medium at Hollister so you may be different|`|DEwEDWIfaa	I find that the sizes are mostly the same. It all depends on the shape or cut of the shirt, but mostly the sizes are the same. <br>  <br>  :)
fGYbzEBvaa	I actually really like the brown-red hair kind of look, so I don't think you should dye it. I love H&M and Top Shop (A little pricey).<br>  <br>  Forever 21 is nice if you really dig into it, you could find some cool stuff.<br>  I like to go little thrift stores and you have to keep a close eye for good deals. I've actually found a lot of vintage in a lot of stores. <br>  <br>  I basically just like to look around and I usually find a store, which is having a sale. They'll most likely have amazing deals. <br>  <br>  Remember that most shops have a sale section and I'm usually there. You can find some amazing, cheap clothes if you keep an open eye. I even find cardigans and sweaters for eight dollars. I think it's just lovely.|`|jsP9C82Vaa	Green eyes and red hair is as good as it gets! Make those gren eyes pop!!!! Wear green and your eyes will look amazing:D|`|AgvkO91Gaa	Don't dye your hair, that's a beautiful color. Forever 21, Deb, Dillard's, and Kohl's, Marshalls, Ross, and TJ Maxx have great stuff.

9h5phsluaa	Hey beautiful :)<br>  <br>  Sooo you are interested in the world of pageantry? Well it's fun, but it's work, NO LIE.   <br>  <br>  First thing i need to say is that if you dont take rejection well then pageants are NOT for you. I did pageants for about 5 years before i finally won. Now, some people go in their first time and ace it, good for them, but it's not normal.  It usually takes a little experience before you are "good" enough to win. Also, pageants are EXPENSIVE.<br>  <br>  There are ALOT of pageants out there. I've never done the small town competitions, so i'm not as experienced with that, But i've done 2 of the larger names.  If you want to learn about pageantry (and all the different competitions), you should check out Pageantry Magazine (www.pageantrymagazine.com).<br>  <br>  Now, what are the two most famous pageants?  Obviously "Miss America" & "Miss USA". Beneath these are several large but a little less prestigious competitions including "National American Miss" (www.namiss.com)  and "American Coed" (both of which i have participated in). I personally prefer National American Miss.<br>  <br>  These are great pageants to test yourself with. They will send you a series of magazines and training books after you are accepted and help you every step of the way if you have any questions or problems. One very positive aspect is that THERE IS NO SWIMSUIT COMPETITION. <br>  <br>  Your fellow contestants are generally very friendly and supportive; even if you dont walk away with the tiara, you'll definitely leave with great new friendships. <br>  <br>  Just check online for contestant rules and application.  www.namiss.com also has sample videos.<br>  <br>  hope this helped!<br>  xx|`|mpva3zDyaa	um you can try <a href="http://pageantschedule.com/" rel="nofollow">http://pageantschedule.com/</a> and click on month view.|`|AwKLdiKdaa	Not sure|`|hg5I1O2xaa	Depends where you're from.

VN2wyTnFaa	The main focal point behind 60s/mod/Twiggy/Pattie Boyd makeup is really wide, doe eyes. A lot of makeup tips that you find now are going to teach you how to do more of a cat eye, which is the exact opposite of what you want to go for. For the mod look the eyes are supposed to be really round and wide, so you'll want to avoid winged eyeliner, but something that will really help out out is white eyeliner on your waterline will help you out. When you line your upper lid, try not to go as thick on the outer half. That's all I can think of right now but I hope that helped! Good luck!|`|iPje1iyGaa	Very natural with some really intense eyelashes.. Stick to eyeliner and mascara only.

IYgiWL3Haa	Hey there! <br>  <br>  That palette is great I have it and use it all the time! There are also 88 palettes and 96 palettes on ebay and starsmakeuphaven.com you can check out those are good too. And don't worry the eyeshadows don't have silica in them. I am the one who made the video about silica on youtube and it's only the silica powder that has silica lol So you are safe. <br>  <br>  It has nothing to do with the eyeshadows BUT if you are going to get the 88 or 96  they are a lot cheaper from starsmakeuphaven.com so I suggest getting them there if you do. Or the 120 palette is only on ebay. I don't think anyone else sells it. Hope this helped!|`|Fe5i7UCxaa	Yes! I've been seeing some really good reviews on youtube about that palette. they say it's great quality for such a reasonable cost the only down side is that each pot is about the size of a dime. It has almost every color u would ever need which would save u a lot of money in the future. the palette comes in shimmer and matte so u'd have to choose between those two textures :)|`|TrY5fwLraa	if youre refering to the costal scents one, beware that the e/s conatain Silica which is very dangerous.<br>  but for the price you're getting nice quality eyeshadows.|`|s3AwAF4saa	no|`|spXPpyP0aa	if you want|`|49mlxtXsaa	I think an eyeshadow palette is worth every penny especially the coastal scents 88 color palette. I have it and it was a really good investment. The colors are really pigmented which is perfect because you can do some really amazing looks with them. I would say they are really similar to mac eyeshadows. I have a review on the 88 color palette on youtube my profile name is kmt1224 i would watch it to see what you think and if you have any other questions dont hesitate to let me know. I would give it a shot if i were you 88 eyeshadows for $20 is an amazing deal!!!|`|djtrHXsbaa	shyyyit if i had the money i would!! i would have so much fun with it... if you have the money and love makeup i say why not!!|`|NDQS5HJyaa	What brand...?

Colorful tuxedo accessories are considered a rookie mistake among experienced dressers.<br>  <br>  Stick to a black jacket and pants, white turndown collar shirt, and black cummerbund and self-tied bow tie.

I checked Tuxedos.com and went to accessories and found that they have it in lilac which is a light purple and also peri which is kind of a darker purple/blue.  Actually I think the lilac would look better.  However, when you go to rent your tux they will have all kinds of stuff at the rental store for you to pick from.  You might want to have your date go with you I don't know.  The sales people can help you though.  I would get a black tux with the lilac vest and tie.  You could also go with a white tux which looks nice too two my sons wore white tuxes to their proms.  Their dates wore a seafoam green dress.  It was very pretty

eow59EaEaa	If her eyes are big and "buggy" line the inner rims with a black or dark brown liner. This will make them looks less round and "pop out" less. <br>  <br>  As for eyeshadow, first use a matte flesh color all over the entire eye lash line to brow bone. <br>  <br>  Then, use a medium  slightly shimmery shade all over the eyelid (I don't know her skin color, but for people who have light-medium skin tones Urban Decay in "Toasted" or Lancome's "Mannequin" are perfect colors for this).<br>  <br>  Then use a dark shade on the outer corner of the eye and slightly in the crease, well blended. It should probably cover the outer 2/3rds of the eye.(a charcoal or black if she's wearing black, a chocolate brown if she's wearing nudes, tans, browns, a dark plum if shes wearing purples, etc.)<br>  <br>  Use a matching eyeliner to the darkest shade over the entire lash line.<br>  <br>  Remember: Dark colors "recede" (make something look "flatter or deeper") and light colors "protrude" (make something "stick out") so you never want to use light colors on the actual eyelid only. It will just make her eyes look even bigger :) Hope this helps!|`|TrY5fwLraa	dark shadows can make her eyes look smaller but more smouldered.<br>  bright shadows will bring more attention to them.<br>  try not to make her eyes any rounder, try elongating them with liner,|`|spXPpyP0aa	eyeshadow|`|9yP43Peiaa	black eyeliner is nice

CxQ3XW4eaa	Serums can be real good - however just put them on the ends never the roots otherwise it will make hair look greasy - some/most recommend to add on damp hair but I put it on once i've dried my hair so your able to see exactly which parts need it.  <br>  <br>  Also if you put mousse (hair mousse that is!) on wet/damp hair it will leave it looking 'wet' if you put enough on.. although on a childs hair I wouldnt recommend using any product too harsh as she will have beautiful natural healthy hair :)  <br>  <br>  ALSO Vaseline! it may sound odd.. but I use it just at the ends of my layers.. I just have a little lip pot of it and put a small amount on the tips of my fingers and run it through the ends of my hair - it gives it that glossy look and im pretty sure its less harmful than any hair product. <br>  <br>  AND finally lol sorry - but if you moisturise your hands and use a tad too much then just run your fingers through the ends of hair and that also works - good luck ! remember its all about the ends not the roots ! :) and dont use anything too harsh for your little girl - hair is beautiful when its natural and once you start using products its hard to get away from it.|`|fRMUUDvuaa	My little sister has the same kind of hair, and she uses a gel<br>  and scrunches it to give it that wet look.<br>  all you do is but a dime size drop of gel<br>  on the palm of your hand. rub together and then <br>  scrunch her hair. do this all over and do it untill <br>  it feel sticky and is hard to let go of. <br>  blow dry it on low for a few seconds to make the hold stay<br>  then that should create a wet look for <br>  her. (This does not work on all hair, sometime it just doesnt<br>  stay!)|`|AA12307935	yes! I use gel that hardens the curls. I don't know if you have this product, but it is called LA Looks and I use one of the higher numbers. Once she comes out of the shower, don't towel dry the hair. Apple the gel ASAP and "scrunch" the hair by crunching it in your hands. Then let it dry, not with heat though. It should look good for about two days.<br>  <br>  My hair tends to get really frizzy and my curls are springy too so this way should definitely do the trick!|`|NqMmvvgVaa	Get a curl enhancer or hair moisturiser. Go in to your nearest priceline and they will definitely be able to help you. I have one from a brand which I think is calledd FX, and instead of it being like a gel, its more of a product to help it shine, so it means the curls stay loose and soft, but gives them a bit of definition and stops them from going fluffy. <br>  <br>  Went and had a look for it in  my bathroom. Its called FX Special effects, Extreme shine. Under the title it says that it is for weightless shine and anti frizz treatment. It is brilliant. It works well also on repairing split ends and frizzyness. It also smells very nice. You just have to make sure you dont put too much of it on the roots, just try to mostly put it on the lengths of the hair. You also don't need much of it. I have had my bottle of it for over a year, use it daily and its still only half used. I got it from priceline and it was under ten dollars. Definitely recommend it.
O6Zvb9Nqaa	it depends if they accept USD money and if they ship worldwide perhaps if they have a contact us option use it and ask
fzQIZPCTaa	your stylist must not have heard you correctly, if you want to match your roots then yes you should get a light brown! natural instincts by clairol is nonpermanent color so it won't damage your hair and if it's too dark it'll wash out in 28 or longer shampoos so you can get the shade lighter if you need to. i'd get a light golden brown, but you could start off with a dark golden blonde and see what happens. and if you don't like it, you can always cover it with the light golden brown!|`|jez0O0bXaa	DO NOT USE BOX COLOR!  Go to Sally's and get the more pro products and they can assist you. Your hair is dark blonde now are you trying to just change the tone? You need to use permanent if you want to go darker because you have removed pigment and it still may lighten a little after shampoos.  Why not lowlight in your natural color to make the <br>  transition easier
bx0ZZEyeaa	Are you kidding? You can't get much better than vintage. No one is affended by vintage. If you buy something vintage, it's almost like buying somthing new.

cfkuPoMaaa	I used to have this. It's okay. You're 15? If your skin is in good condition DO NOT wear foundation. you will be glad for it when you're older. If you're skin is not in such good shape its okay to wear foundation/cover up (but make it look natural). and PLEASE don't wear heavy eyeliner EW! just a little eyeliner on the outside of the top lid, mascara, a quick sweep of nars blush in orgasm and chapstic.  <br>  <br>  How to apply foundation. <br>  <br>  The foundation you have (the one i used to have) i found that it had a sort of uneven texture as well. I bought a makeup sponge and soaked it in water. While the sponge was still damp i rubbed it in the matte and it was better.  <br>  <br>  I would recommend though using a different foundation. <br>  <br>  If you use a liquid (get oil free and hypoallergenic) use a makeup brush as well and evenly blend all over or only where needed.  If you have a pimple. Apply the cover up first then dab the sponge rather than blend over the cover up.  <br>  <br>  If you use a powder. Well i would only use a powder if you know how do apply it correctly. Powder tends to cake. <br>  <br>  Final tip-go to a makeup store (ULTA, Sephora) and ask them to find your perfect shade.  It is the worst to see someone with a foundation line, orange face, or pale face and tan body.  <br>  <br>  Goodluck!|`|pmOnEwEuaa	it's probably going on unevenly because of a few dry patches on your face. exfoliate lightly beforehand and apply a moisturizer, then let it sink in for a few minutes. <br>  <br>  if you're already doing that, use a damp sponge or soft foundation brush to apply the foundation.. fingers aren't always the best tool to use (although they often are). apply in circular motions and blend edges with a dry sponge, then set with a light dusting of translucent powder. hope this works well for you!|`|Wehx6UPIaa	get a foundation that suites your skin colour the best.<br>  & when you put it on make sure you blend it in really well.<br>  sometimes with make up less is more. <br>  <br>  i hope it helps =)|`|uKSsXz2iaa	I have it and I'm not a fan. I just smeared it around my face with my fingers. It always made my face look like it had a ton of dry patches.|`|2UlLayugaa	I used that once and it dried up my skin i ended up taking it back <br>  your probably better of with mineral makeup its much better for your skin and blends easier<br>  Try Body Shops mineral makeup<br>  <br>  OR <br>  If u still want to use that get a foundation sponge dot some on your forehead your cheeks then chin and a bit on your nose then blend and work it into your skin and add a light powder over the top<br>  Try Clinique blended face powder in invisible<br>  <br>  Hope this helped:)

Its not always cosmetic, and even when it is, we are creating a world of more confident people that are more likely to become successful because of their confidence. I don't think plastic surgery is bad. I just think its bad when people use too much of it because of greed and they use money on repairing things that arent even that bad when they could be giving the money to charities.<br>  I think its a perfectly respectable job. :)|`|24Xy8qWtaa	Well if you don't do it who else is going to find self conscious people and turn them into clones?|`|IVF4lyJdaa	no its not wrong at all, you make money doin what you love thats all that matters|`|JZMfUDylaa	no but you need to work hard on your grades in high school and then work extra hard in collage if you want to be an actual plastic surgeon.

AA11092803	i wouldn't say it's wrong but how about this thought process: if you don't like something, try to accept it then embrace it.<br>  not loving yourself is obviously making you quite unhappy, and believe me i know what it's like to feel ugly. as matter of fact i know what it's like to always be insecure, and feel unloved because of my physic. <br>  do you wanna know when all this changed? when i started accepting myself. when i started loving myself. i realized then that it's the outside that's wrong, it's the inside. and that is something that nothing or noone can change for you. only you can do something about it.<br>  once you start accepting yourself (REALLY AND HONESTLY) you'll realize that yes, you're not perfect. as a matter of fact you may be very far from perfect. but chances are that you're not ugly either. when you think about it, there are very few really ugly people. you'll start noticing that even though your nose is not well shaped, it's not horrible either. and your thighs are not that fat, and that your breasts are not that badly shaped...and so on.<br>  but IF you still think you don't have the right body, think about this: would you really want someone to love you just because you have slimmer thighs or bigger boobs or a straighter nose? is that really what you want? there is nothing more beautiful than being loved for yourself. and trust me, there is always someone out there to love wholly and fully for who you are. it may not seem sometimes but it's true.<br>  <br>  so yes you're right, life is too short, don't waste it whinning about your image and if you really wanna change something change the inside. use the money you'd have put in the surgeries to travel the world for example and see for yourself how fortunate you are. how fortunate in so so many ways and you'll see that your body and your face is nothing compared to what you could offer the world, and those who can't see it aren't worth it anyway. make the world a better place and you can start by not being superficial. appreciate yourself and people will love you for it, i guarantee it.|`|jsP9C82Vaa	I don't like that thought process. Be happy with what you have is a way better and healthier way to think. Embrace your natural beauty and what God gave you.

DJ3QGkYiaa	I worked in a Salon for quite some time and I know this sounds gross...... but mayonaise will do the trick. Shampoos can strip hair of essential oils making it dry and brittle. Conditioners don't fix the problem just make it a little more manageable.<br>  <br>  The best way to go about this is in the summertime when it's warm, but apply enough mayonaise to your hair to saturate strands. Then wrap saran wrap around your hair and head (like a shower cap) This helps to trap heat, and keep it frmo getting on everything else. Then just hang out in the sun. The heat will help your hair absorb the oils in the mayonaise and give you a glossy shine (after you shampoo of course)<br>  <br>  If it's not warm where you live you could always use a hairdryer to heat up your strands, its just easier to let nature help.|`|JbSebJJYaa	Paul Mitchell's Super Skinny Line is AMAZING !

You won't be able to walk in the 9s, especially once they stretch. You will look stupid stumbling around in those 9s. I am sorry to be so harsh, but it is true. In all honesty, you probably need a 7, but you can give the 6s a try. They will fit fine, but over time you will wear a hole in the toe area.<br>  <br>  Call around to shops, you may find your size in stock. I know in the United States, many stores got their Spring shipments in, and they got regular colors too, not just the new spring colors.

DcWan3qxaa	My mom, me, my boyfriend, all have nose piercings.<br>  <br>  They don't really hurt at all, it's like a pinch, with a slight warm feeling.<br>  I have my septum, which is the thick center  piercing, in between your nostrils. It hurts a lot worse,than a side nostril piercing.<br>  <br>  If you go with a small 16g stud or ring in your nostril, it won't hurt that much. Unless you get it infected.<br>  Just keep it clean and you should be fine.|`|SndrZbn8aa	It wasn't that bad as far as pain. The healing process was rather long as the nose is made up of cartilage. If you've ever had the tops of your ears pierced it's rather similar to that. Also the piercer put this little rubber finger glove on and put his finger in my nose which was incredibly weird. I guess not all piercers do that though. Also after it's healed it still closes up rather quickly. At least for me and a friend of mine. We've both had ours done for years but when leaving it out for even hour I have a hard time getting the jewelry back in and it hurts a bit.<br>  Any piercing is going to hurt. Usually though the toughest part of it is the healing. Keeping it clean and free from infection... good luck.|`|ohyRPg1Uaa	It's not bad at all.. It stings right when they pierce it but, other than that.. it's all gravy baby! lol.. good luck!<br>  and make sure you clean on regulars|`|Lqdi9Xswaa	mine hurt less than a regular ear piercing.|`|ss48BEk5aa	It was the second most painful piercing I got, surprisingly. I have had many piercings and most of them honestly did not hurt at all, just a quick pinch. The nipples hurt like hell and I would not recommend them to anyone, lol. The nostril was second place for pain, but wasn't bad at all. If your talking about the septum, that also didn't hurt.<br>  <br>  Go to Fillmore Tattoo and Piercings in Fillmore. <br>  Great people and good deals. Here's their myspace link<br>  www.myspace.com/fillmoretattoo<br>  You can check out the piercers porfolio<br>  Tell them you know Lindsey!|`|7V7iQBZSaa	i have had my nose done 3 times now, i have to take it out for work and it has closed up but i have it done again now.. trust me when i went to get it done the first time i was expecting real bad pain, it was nothing like i thought it would be, it stings like any needle in ur arm but not unbearable, then thats abt it, the pain lasts for like 2 seconds, its nothing, if it was that painful i wouldnt have gone back and got it done again, also have my eye brow tongue and belly button done, they cant be too painful cause im a wuss when it comes to pain|`|NhOQ3mRxaa	Oh my gosh who ever told you it hurt that bad was lying well actually it depends on your pain level when I got mine done i hardly felt it, it was like a pinch and then it was done. Trust me sweetie it don't hurt|`|TnQEOdX0aa	It all depends on your nose. I got mine done, and it didn't hurt at all, but my sister's was alot harder. Hers took a bit of pushing to get through the skin and it hurt a whole lot. The piercer had said that she had a "hard nose".|`|uKSsXz2iaa	I had mine done.. it really wasn't bad. I got a ring, not a stud.. and it was extremely difficult when it came to washing my face and sleeping, it was verrrrry sore afterwards. And even after having it for a year and a half, if you take it out, it will close up.

Ex: If you have a low cut dress on and you don't want a nipple exposed put some fashion tape which is double sided tape that is strong enough to adhere to clothing and skin and stay in place. You just put it near the area you don't want showing and your clothing should stay in place when dancing or jumpin..I saw it at victoria secrets but you could buy it at beauty.com and its called hollywood fashion tape.|`|nJr3Ey0naa	idk...

HeOwMaxaaa	you dont have to be tall to be a model. but you you do if you want a serious modelling career. you can do commercial ads, advertisements etc. i think you should take modelling classes before you do anything if you dont know anything about the modelling world even though take quite alot money but dont pay for anything else besides the classes. after that send photos to an agency, see if they accept you or not. but remeber you can only do commercial and advertisemt like in cataloges or something because your not so tall.<br>  you can still be a model, but do something else while your at it, because you dont have a promising career as a model because of your height ( your only limited to do commercial modelling or advertisments).. unless your outrageously beautiful or have something unique about you that they would pick you over a 5'8 model...lol so while you do another job see if your modelling career is going  great, if it is then quite your job and focus on modelling, but ONLY if you modelling career is taking you somewere!!<br>  <br>  good luck hope i helped!|`|4381ce1eabe1bba2f5000ef04b6611caaa	"Get taller" and "lose weight" is the basis of modeling.

kCdISEGqaa	If you're asking honestly to get honest reactions, I'll say I think it is very plain for half sleeve.  It will just be a skull with a bandanna over the mouth.  Tattoos are forever, and for a half sleeve, you may want to think about taking the bandanna off of the mouth, and adding something more than smoke behind it.  Just my opinion though, like I tell everyone, it's your choice, do what you want.  No one else has to live with it.  Best wishes!|`|zmjAccMFaa	It's not very much for a half sleeve.  I would maybe add some more to it and take the bandanna away.<br>  I mean it is your body so get whatever you want, it is on you forever just keep that in mind.|`|iTP5CNtuaa	I like the design. One thing though, I think the sun's basic design should be altered to replicate the feel of the rest of the tattoo.

NOSWANvNaa	CURLING<br>  I'd reccomend getting a new curling iron that has REAL ceramic plates. Sedu, Chi, FHI, GHD, etc. are all good brands, but they are expensive. Try buying one from Sally's and ask someone who works there what they reccomend, they most always get it right.<br>  Now how to? It is very hard to explain in full word detail so I just would reccomend to visit YouTube and search for, "How to curl hair with a curling iron". There will be many results.<br>  <br>  SCRUNCHING:<br>  Well gel does work, but scrunching gel works the best. I'd buy the Garnier Fructis Scrunching Gel. I use most Garnier products and would definitley trust that one. You pretty much just spray it in your hair or rub it in between your hands and fix it into your hair. Then you take parts of your hair and scrunch it up by closing your hand with the hair inside. I'd reccomend searching on youtube on how to scrunch also, because it is easier to watch someone do it.<br>  <br>  Last but not least, look for a diffuzer. If you want your hair to be more curly/wavy then you should buy a diffuzer. You can search how to use one on YouTube also. <br>  <br>  PS: I do not use a curling iron, scrunching gel, or a diffuzer. Although I do know about this stuff because I like to study things before buying them. I also help some friends with the curling irons because they have the tendacy to burn their neck. I have a diffuzer with my hair dryer but I do not use it, It does help though.<br>  <br>  Good Luck!<br>  <br>  By the way, please no judgers. Just because I am a guy does not mean I cannot know about hair care. I'm not gay and it does not mean I am. I do not care if you think I am but it's disrespectful because an uncle of mine is and it upsets me when people judge.|`|1aziEu6Jaa	i have the same hair. well the best way to scrunch ur hair is to have it damp and put gell in it and put ur head upside down and scrunch it with ur hands. then i spray it with hair spray and put it upp in a bun for a few minutes. or if you want you can buy a "diffuser" it goes on ur blow dryer or usually comes with it. that works veryyy well also.. help this worksss|`|1MBQqDETaa	scrunched hair is so 90's|`|AA11615154	try youtube to get a good visual on this.<br>  it easier to show than to tell.<br>  <br>  type in hair scrunching or something similar.

1b765faa7cd93e80b10dbdec7b2240e5aa	Well, it really depends on the ingredients.  I've heard from cosmetologists/estheticians that your skin will get used to ingredients after awhile, and that you want to change it so often.  Also, your skin might need a different regimen depending on the season. You definitely want to avoid hydroquionine (not sure on spelling?), that's been shown in studies to be damaging for long term use.|`|NigoVXX1aa	Depends on the ingredients,if is natural,that's alright otherwise don't use it.
jp9OzuXoaa	I would say it should be gone within a week. I actually didn't experience any of that, luckily enough but it's totally normal so don't worry about it. :) I've actually heard it can do that for up to six months (not quite as intense as time goes on though). The worst part is within the first couple of weeks.<br>  <br>  Edit:<br>  <br>  And yes, you can get infections without signs of pus/bleeding. Your ear can start to hurt like a mother and/or your ear can start to swell really bad. If that happens, go the the doctor as soon as possible and take the earring out. :)|`|NigoVXX1aa	Apply oil to your pierced ear,it will help but don't let water get in the pierced area.
ZyV2InIPaa	go to the LUSH website there is this product that looks something like this lol H'shuan hdsajksdn <br>  it's the name of a cantonese hair goddess.

Do it about every week or so ! It will help. Just be really careful what you do to it for a while. Let it rest (: Also, try taking some prenatal vitamins.

jez0O0bXaa	Do you have well water? That would do it. You probably just have red undertones and pull red. Put in highlights and get it up to a lemon pulp color then you can use a cool toner and maintain with shampoos for blondes.|`|rAAHHYEWaa	dont use any hair color with ash i have the same problem you have natural "red" hair and ash makes it come alive lol|`|5j1Uhg2Gaa	Well don't color your roots if you want to stop dying it. And ask them to cut out some of the color and if you keep doing this your hair should be back to normal after about 4 times doing this. And make sure they are only coloring the part of your hair is already colored.|`|JbSebJJYaa	With all the color you have done in your hair, it is stripped the pigment thus the color is having a hard time finding something to hold onto. You should just leave it alone because it's only gonna get worse. I know from experience with clients. Just get a really good strengthening shampoo and conditioner and keep your ends trimmed.<br>  <br>  - Paul Mitchell Salon Professional|`|LVRBtXGuaa	see ive dyed my hair red time after time, and im only 16, and i have had problems getting the red to go away, the only thing you can do is strip your hair, which will take any color out and make it a light blonde.. and then you dye it whatever color after that, but wait a couple days before dying it after stripping..|`|fRMUUDvuaa	Black is the hardest color to get rid of. trust me i have black hair. <br>  so your best bet is going to a beauty supply store and buy a color <br>  strip treatment.<br>  Trust me, i am having the same problem as you. <br>  lololol
e633afd58fd578ab66287bf7228318fcaa	Well I guess that is the flip side of padded bras, really - makes the moment of truth more "scary" almost.<br>  <br>  It is just a hurdle you need to get over - and really it is his responsibility to get you over it... but you should not make it completely impossible for him.<br>  <br>  And maybe also try not to the wrong compliments in his mouth.. if you understand what I mean. Like if you lament that your breasts are small, like it was a mistake (did you really say that too him?) then maybe you almost force him to say "oh no of course they are not small"... and then it all becomes weird. Because you need to hear that they ARE small AND beautiful.<br>  <br>  But all youngsters have their trouble getting closer to each other - due to different kinds of shyness and self-consciousness... Sometimes it is good, because I guess one is not supposed to get close to everybody ;o)<br>  <br>  Annd sometimes, it is a little that one has to get over to become really grown-up. If you want to test the reaction without going the whole way - maybe you could try using a bra with less padding - that way you know that he knows... and if he still likes you, then you will feel much more secure.<br>  <br>  I think girls' breasts are always something sweet to guys - and one of those things that good in-and-of-themselves. I mean not really needing to compare: oh theis other girl had another kind of breasts.<br>  <br>  It is usually the girls themselves who don't see any magic in those awkward body parts of their own, and therefore start comparing; "oh that girl has another kind of breasts, maybe she it is better than me".<br>  <br>  But in most cases, I think the guy will feel HE must be doing something wrong, if you withhold your female beatifulness from him.<br>  <br>  So you holding back too much and being too self-conscious may be a huge hurdle - your breast size is not ;o)|`|WoltH8VCaa	Dont let him do anything with you until your 100% comfortable with him!<br>  mostly if just depends on the guy. and your like me! i wear push up bras as well, to hide my flatness.

Who am i to say right....i had my first bf touch my boobs when i was ur age...but i seriously wish i had waited with the sexual stuff. U need to feel comfy with urself, and who u are. it doesnt matter what anyone says to u- if u dont like u, then no one will....u know what im saying?? im 20something now, so i have experience. It doenst matter how big or how small ur boobs are: if a guy likes u, he will touch u and want to see u and etc (in other words, it doesnt matter how big or small u might be) if the guy likes u, he will like u, and he wont mind about ur boobs.<br>  <br>  Just make sure u are comfy with urself...and leaving ur clothes on during sexual stuff takes the fun out of it i think.|`|KhgOZeb9aa	don't worry i feel the same. I am 14 and have very small breasts. I also wear a padded bra so my breasts appear larger than they actually are. I know mine are still developing but i wish they would hurry up. if your not ready for him to see your breasts then don't go for it. when he is ready and you are ready, you both will feel comfortable with eachothers flaws.|`|E4vAGtUOaa	The most important thing is you and how you feel at the time. You are really young so I don't know if I would do too much to fast. Don't care what anyone says, one thing does lead to another and you have to be ok with that. If not than I would express that to him...if he respects you then he will let you become comfortable with yourself before he pushes you any further. You are young girl! Give yourself a chance to grow up :-)|`|Au80s2OJaa	A guy will prefer naked boobs to covered ones, whatever size they are.|`|dXcKyKwXaa	Let him see and if he says something about it tell him he has a small dick and that would shut him up.|`|ip6yFmC2aa	Advice that was passed on to me that I'm passing to you  (I'm small as well). <br>  <br>  "Anything more then a handful is a waste".<br>  <br>  =)|`|y6Myl0Imaa	i used to feel that way but then i grew out of it i love mine same size same age|`|EhspTl0kaa	I know how you feel. Well we have an age difference. I'm 19 you're 15; I wear a 34A to or 32B. I had to get used to being small. All girls are different and for their own reasons. You do still have time to develop. <br>  <br>  Anyway to answer your question about letting him see your boobs, let him touch them first. Don't just throw them at him or be nervous. I guess I'm saying he'll like your boobs either way. Big or small. Either way guys get turned on. Take that as a compliment. Hope this somehow helped. <br>  <br>  Also you don't have to worry about having such a heavy asset to cover up or carry around. You're probly petite.|`|bx0ZZEyeaa	Seriously, you have NO idea. Be happy with what you have. you'd be suprised if you knew what guys actually like. The fact that you have them is MORE than fine for men. I'm currently wishing mine were smaller. My husband says he likes them fine the way they are, but also says he's not usually much of a breast man. Most of my men have not been so big on breasts but haven't minded mine so much. Mine have always been slightly bigger than usual, but now that I've had children, I can't ask for them to be small enough.<br>  <br>  However, in general, you'd be suprised how sexy the "smaller" look is to your usual man AND woman, and you have NO idea how many women are jealous of you.|`|1pZLQSz0aa	leave it on with the sexual stuff if ur not comfortable, but work ur way up untill ur totally comfortable.  But if u hold back, he may think hes wasting his time.

ygcbrp5Uaa	Wow... Um, don't know about the horse shampoo, but taking care of your hair and scalp (making sure that they're well hydrated and not exposed to chemicals) is an important start. Try taking vitamin E or eating olive oil in your diet to insure your hair's health. Also, keep a good amount of protein in your daily diet, because that's what hair is made of. Once your hair gets going, keeping it well brushed and in a braid or a bun will prevent it from breaking before it has a chance to grow to its potential.|`|YwHl37Hgaa	Lavender oil has been shown to increase hair growth so massage the oil once a week and soak for 30 minutes before washing.

m845uIx9aa	it's best to apply a pencil eyeliner before your strip eyelashes so you can see exactly where to place them, and to prevent any skin from showing between your natural lashes and the false ones. Next place your false lashes in your eyelash curler. Try to place the curler as close as you can to the base of the false lashes. put the glue on it and put them on... the closer you place them to your natural lashline, the more natural they'll appear. you can follow with a liquid liner to help disguise the lash band and it will also seal them in to make sure they don't fall.|`|e33d8d3e0ec2509a9d2f30e691a5c124aa	Read the instructions...|`|AA11390361	Since most of the eyelashes that you buy are all the same length they need to be trimmed to look natural with your eye shape hold the eyelash to your eye with no glue yet and with tiny scissors trim the ones that are too long mainly at the sides of the eye to give thm a natural look since lashes are longer towards the middle and then taper in length at the sides. Its actually best to buy individual eyelashes and fill in the spaces  where your lashes need filling in to make them look thicker-most of us need fuller nd not esp longer lashes.Be sure to already have put mascara on YOUR Lashes before you start. When putting glue on the Lash Edge where the glue goes squeeze out very carefully and just a little is needed for too much glue gives you a mess.   If you have a old doll practice putting the glue on lashes and gluing to eye that will assure you put just the amount needed when doing yours.  Some Hair Salons esp the ones that offer eyebrow waxing will for a charge put the eyelashes on for you Call around perhaps you'll find one near you and have her/him show you so you'll know   Good Luck|`|157960fe1180eb6429f1e7c48124e1a0aa	<a href="http://www.videojug.com/film/how-to-use-and-apply-fake-eyelashes" rel="nofollow">http://www.videojug.com/film/how-to-use-...</a><br>  A very helpful vid.|`|9b78e97cd2dc64785fa40b334d313a23aa	Follow the instructions and then practice practice practice. Reading how and understanding what to do is easy. Learning to apply them can only be done by actually doing it.|`|c81165879f070611977cc43186249fabaa	Applying fake lashes is best left to your makeup artist, but with a little patience and practice, you too can master this art. So don't try it five minutes before leaving to a big party. Andrea lashes are great and they are available inexpensively at the drugstore.<br>  <br>  Keep a piece of paper handy to hold the lashes, and a magnifying mirror, which makes the job a lot easier. <br>  Using a tweezer, dip the base end of the lashes into the glue, then place the lashes as close to the baseline of your own as you can, filling in wherever you want the greatest impact (generally, the mid to outer lashes look fabulous in false lashes). Press gently, but firmly with something blunt. Hold the lash in place for about 5 seconds until the glue has a chance to hold.<br>  <br>  Let the glue dry, and then apply a dark eyeliner to camouflage the line of the fake lashes and then apply your mascara. The mascara will help blend your own lashes with the fake ones, and make your eyes look fuller and larger.<br>  <br>  To remove, gently pull them off with tweezers.|`|pThWK0Dwaa	read the instructions, it should say.<br>  and, i dont wear them or anything,<br>  but maybe getting a friend to do them for you is better because she can see and you can't as much.|`|d333f859e4e042ee32b591a038a04b67aa	they are sticky so stick then to your eyelids.Duh!or have someone help you put them on.|`|fnQlLL63aa	You pull the eyelashes off a dead baby and glue them to your own.

That's why I've been told that they are fun. I had mine for 3 years and took it out just last week.|`|9tyaBnAJaa	I wasn't real crazy about mine.  It made simple tasks like licking envelopes and eating ice cream cones difficult.  I took it out, and it was like heaven.  I could brush my tongue again.  It doesn't particularly hurt getting it done, just make sure the piercer gets it right in the center of your tongue, in the cartilage between the two muscles.  It won't swell up nearly as bad.  The sexual thing, it was different, but not necessarily fun.  The fun part was that nobody knew that I had my tongue pierced, and when I went on dates, they noticed and were surprised.  Ha ha!|`|RuYyVWWJaa	if you are a jittery person, it can be fun to play with(once its healed otherwise it just hurts) but it does make thing more difficult at first til you get used to it. i had mine for 5 years and loved it, but every once in a while it would annoy me and then it would be real hard to talk, out of know where id just start slurring my words. over all i would say they are worth it, as long as its something you think you would like personally and you get it done at a trustable shop.  Forget all that sexual crap, it really has no effect on either person, its just a dirty rumor by people who either dont know what they are talking about or just like attention.

a3d023d364e04ebe419bb0614846f0bbaa	Hello, je porte des lentilles, et il m'a fallut que une petite semaine a m'habituer à les mettre, c'est vrai la première fois il m'a fallut une heure! lol et j'avais les yeux rouges! Mais mtn après plusieurs années tout va bien, il me faut que qlq secondes pour les mettre. Normalement, tu peux le garder max 8h, mais moi je les laissent bcp plus lgt et il y a aucun problème, Avec la fatigue tes yeux peuvent devenir un peu secs, mais il existe des gouttes"larmes artificielles! Voila|`|0c890d294086739ae3bd0f5b6d3406d3aa	Attention ! Avant de manipuler les lentilles de contact, les mains doivent être très propres ! Les lentilles de contact sont très faciles à appliquer. Il suffit de poser la lentille c?té face bombée sur le bout du doigt, d'ouvrir grand les yeux, d'écarter légèrement la paupière inférieure et d'appliquer la lentille sur l'oeil. Elle se place automatiquement... Si l'oeil est un peu sec, appliquer quelques gouttes de larmes artificielles, voire du sérum physiologique. On s'habitue très vite aux lentilles, rassurez-vous (pour ma part, quelques jours m'ont suffit)... Il est recommandé de les retirer tous les soirs... Pour les porter, c'est comme bon vous semble... Seule petite contrainte : l'entretien, il doit être scrupuleux... Il faut changer tous les jours la solution décontaminante !|`|26063b2fbf516f78cb560c1257ab48eaaa	C'est un coup à prendre mais non<br>  Quelques heures normalement<br>  oui, et tu verras que tu le feras de toi-même, ?a tire en fin de journée!|`|UjCwHbJ7aa	Rien de plus facile! Juste le faire deux ou trois fois le temps de t'habituer, mais rien de bien sorcier! Tu les mets le matin après les avoir nettoyées et tu les retires le soir avant d'aller dormir. Je te conseille les souples,on s'y habitue mieux. Surtout ne jamais oublier de se laver les mains à chaque contact avec les lentilles pcq les infections ne sont pas rares, même si souvent bégnines.<br>  Perso, moi, après en avoir porté pdt plusieurs années, je ne les supportes plus que qq heures par jour. En effet, chez certaines personnes, les lentilles favorisent la disparition du liquide qu'on a ds l'oeil et celui ci ne revient plus. C'est ce qui m'arrive :-(<br>  Mais sinon c'est dix fois mieux que les lunettes! :)|`|c64072808a2a30e14e6530d46fbbac0baa	<a href="http://www.lentillesdecontact.com/pages/default.asp?PageURL=lentillesdecontact.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.lentillesdecontact.com/pages/...</a> <br>  - lentilles rigides,<br>  - lentilles souples : les traditionnelles, les journalières et les à renouvellement fréquent<br>  - lentilles colorées|`|41b1ccca83c3550116324bf00890db6daa	?a dépend des lentilles (souples, dures?). demande à ton opticien de te montrer comment les mettre et surtout comment les enlever. et à toi la liberté! attention: hygiène impecable et mains toujours propres sinon gare aux infections!|`|EVCFxG6caa	pour la difficulté : c'est comme tout, c'est en forgeant qu'on devient... performant. Surtout, il ne faut pas avoir en sacro-sainte horreur le contact (indirect) avec ton oeil. A part ?a, il faut tenir son oeil ouvert et la lentille se ventouse facilement par les larmes. Les gentils opticiens ou ophtalmo t'aideront de toute fa?on.<br>  Personnellement je me suis vite habitué à ne plus sentir mes oreilles tirées et mon nez écrasé 16h par jour. (en 1 semaine tu devrais être habitué, sauf si tu n'as pas de main, ?a peux être plus long!)<br>  Après il y a des gens qui ne les supporte pas, mais le seul moyen de savoir c'est d'essayer.<br>  Enfin, il faut les retirer tous les jours et tenter de ne pas les porter plus de 8h par jour, parce que ?a pompe plus de larme que s'il n'y avait rien dans les yeux.|`|xbh4KaT1aa	non au contraire ce né vraiment pas difficile a mettre mais attention il faut les portées avec délicatesse .sa peux prendre 3 jour comme plusieurs semaine chacun si adapte comme il peut .oui bien sur qu'il faut les retirées chaque jours é personnellement je vous conseille d'allé voire un ophtalmologue il vous guidera mieux|`|838934cdd07376f48fae419814af7902aa	Nath, je suis d'accord.<br>  Etant d'humeur joyeuse à 2 heures de mon hospitalisation, je voudrais SVP me permettre.<br>  <br>  Les lentilles peuvent permettre le contact, mais parfois elles donnent des gaz indésirables. De là à dire qu'en fin de journée, tu tires, c'est pas gagné à tous les coups.
i3TIW7vtaa	The brown colour is so nice!<br>  I'm dying mine darker soon.|`|QaVLgTQCaa	Looks nice as is|`|M9tH99gfaa	i think it looks good...but do a darker brown if u want...i wouldnt go blonde|`|ToFU2oOAaa	I like your hair's texture. It would look better if you lightened it a bit. (like a sunkiss color) What would look nice with your complexion would be dark red/brown highlights or dark blonde highlights.<br>  <br>  here's a good example of what I mean by sunkissed:<br>  <a href="http://farm1.static.flickr.com/200/514548821_42c1267470.jpg?v=0" rel="nofollow">http://farm1.static.flickr.com/200/51454...</a><br>  <br>  You see, she still keeps that natural brown color overall... but the blonde streaks and sunkiss effect makes it exciting. <br>  <br>  Cute smile, by the way. :)|`|uKXgg9heaa	A little more blond hi-lights will look nice!|`|nsYRh67daa	I like it|`|UoMOLXdfaa	NO! absolutely not black! i like the blonde though. get blonde high lights. that would be so pretty. but i actually like your hair. your really pretty dont worry im not trying to make that sound weird lol! but get blonde high lights don't go dark. maybe like this<br>  <br>  <a href="http://i198.photobucket.com/albums/aa58/fcukkk_/MaryKate20and20Ashley201.jpg" rel="nofollow">http://i198.photobucket.com/albums/aa58/...</a>|`|YGbz1V8naa	Your hair color is already nice, but adding some subtle highlights and lowlights in to give you something a little different without a dramatic change would look good.|`|l95YdgMJaa	i think that since we are going towards spring and then summer, that adding the blonde would look better now than adding the brown, i like solid dark colors when it comes to winter|`|uYJdvnqxaa	You're really pretty. :]<br>  <br>  I say keep it the color it is,with maybe some streaks of a darker brown.|`|V5AliBPMaa	I like it like that|`|2glmH9Jbaa	its relaly cute! if you want a change maybe get some blonde highlights:]|`|hdcrxbSTaa	i like it! but if you want to change it go darker for sure.|`|ohyRPg1Uaa	it's cute like that!|`|OVBOCRpzaa	you are so prettyyyy! your hair is gorgous! i like it the way it is but if you are going to then use blonde highlights!|`|JXTPydxJaa	it is awesome.<br>  dont go blonde or streaks.<br>  if anything you'd look nice maybe a touch darker

ND9ljP8aaa	You can towel dry your hair, and then use a hair gel to scrunch it, and leave it wet.|`|fnmViEXaaa	Absolutely, I do it all the time. My hair is naturally curly. After washing and conditioning with Bumble and Bumble Creme de Cocao, I squeeze out excess water with a towel, then apply Kiehl's Silk Groom (for style, shine and protection from heat). I put the hairdryer on a low setting (medium if I'm in a rush) and scrunch just as I would with a diffuser. I used to use a diffuser, but it kept falling off my dryer and eventually broke. I found that it's much easier without it. Technically, it will give you less heat, which is good for frizzies, but a lot of that's in the haircut, product and drying technique. <br>  <br>  Good luck!|`|KgdN8BKZaa	Of course! Just turn your blowdryer on low,  make sure you have gotten as much of the moisture out of your hair as you can with a towel. Use a little bit of product, flip your head up side down and gently blow dry your hair using your hand to cup your hair like the diffuser would. Make sure when your cupping your hair that you get to the roots with the air to give it lift and body. It takes time, but it will look just as pretty!|`|WspsE7Sraa	you could just get some kind of hair cream and after you put the cream in your hair  blow dry it. while you are blow drying, scrunch your hair and hold the blow dryer to the hair and repeat
66eb00bd969ddfc9a608ea531f6fbebcaa	There's no new medicine as of late.  The most recent FDA approved solution is a portable laser hair therapy called HairMax LaserComb.  It seems to be the latest craze for hair loss solution.  It's only FDA-approved for men.  They are still in process to get it approved for women.  However, it's been marketed for the past few years for both men and women, even before the FDA approval.<br>  <br>  Also, there has been improvement in non-ingested solutions  mostly as shampoos/conditioners that help thinning hair, but not necessarily hair loss.  Nioxin has been around over 15 years catering to thinning hair.  Their product is the first product that I used.<br>  <br>  Lastly, do you really have any real concerns about losing more hair or even thinning hair?  If so, then think about changing your diet to further promote hair growth.  Remember the old cliche, "You are what you eat".<br>  <br>  I have some info on various hair loss solutions in my website below.|`|AA11892949	i know a traditional way of curing it Its really simple a little wierd but TRUE----<br>  1.Mix egg,coconut and grease in water<br>  2. after applying it go to school with it.<br>  3.when your friends make fun of you punch them hard in the face<br>  4.once you get rustigated just buy a wig!!!!!!!!!|`|OB8bJmsAaa	Try asking your doctor as it might be dandruff or something.

Just talk to someone like Bosley or Hair Club for long-term solutions.

21d816fda91a16202b2cba12cfd98f4faa	Well I've actually had the opposite experience -- I am smaller in juniors than in womens.  I'm a 3/5 in juniors and a 4/6 in womens.  Although I admit it is hard to find a size 2 in most women's stores, so I am not sure if that would fit or not; some 2's I have tried are too big, and some too small.<br>  <br>  So I am thinking a 9 in juniors is a 10 in womens.  But all brands of clothing run different, so you will just have to try clothes on and see what works.  I would look for 8s and 10s and see which fit you better.  For shirts try small and medium, because I find shirts are cut much tighter and shorter in juniors than in womens.  Womens shirts tend to be boxier and less form-fitting.<br>  <br>  Just don't get caught up in the number on the label in your clothing!  What matters is how good you look in the RIGHT size for your body, not the smaller or bigger number on the label.  Better to look rockin' in a size 10 than squeezed like a sausage in an 8!  :-)|`|NaVriAR5aa	Well it just really depends where u shop it would stay the same most likely but you may also go down i size like 8 in pants and a small in tops! Well go to the mall and try on some womens clothes and see which size fits better!|`|3eVJ3NCaaa	Size 8 in Misses I would think.|`|GKwCel1Kaa	Usually in junior sizes your bigger. So go down one size for womens. Example I'm between a 5-7 junior and in womens I wear a 4 or 6.

759b251cb1f96062263eb5c2b92cf46eaa	You can have cellulite even as a child, I had it from about age 10! It's usually hereditary and hormonal and made worse be an unhealthy diet. It has nothing to do with whether you have excess fat or not, but it is difficult to get rid of. The best way to avoid it, or to try to reduce it's appearance is to cut out unhealthy food and drink, that cause toxins to build up in the body such as too much salt or sugar, fizzy drinks, coffee, etc and get plenty of exercise as well as drinking 8 glass of water per day. You can also try body brushing and regular cold showers. HTH : )|`|f62ab1de7c1d8229896aa194fefb1dbcaa	There no age limit in getting cellulite it depends on how you take good care of your skin.

Has worked for years <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  You can find olive oil anywere, but the other oils you will have to buy at a local organics store, wholes foods or BJ's health corner. <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  Source: <a href="http://www.myspace.com/creaturemermaid....." rel="nofollow">http://www.myspace.com/creaturemermaid.....</a>|`|146cecc891fb5393e48a6ec94e670215aa	wigs.|`|SPFu40yXaa	and I've got an extremely rebellious temper...anyone to tame me?

Those white mascara primers are used as a kind of thickening agent and unfortunately can sort of gunk up. My advice would be that if you really want to make your eyelashes look fuller naturally then use an eyelash curler and make sure to go over with mascara twice for a fuller affect. But if you really want something dramatically longer then there are lots of different fake eyelash kits to choose from. Good luck and the best brand of mascara is Lancome.|`|d3752fa5075a69b9f0d6993080f1b61baa	Try using Castor Oil every day. Heating the oil up a couple secs in the palm of your hand will be more effective. Remove your eyeliner after 8 hrs of wering it this will help the eyelashes from falling too! Hope this helped.

AA11110627	I think you should go into the salon with your hair the way it naturally is so she knows what she is dealing with. As far as highlighting, it depends on what kind of look you want. Going 1-2 shades lighter than your natural hair color is subtle, but it should look nice. If you wanted something more noticeable, go for the lighter and brighter colors.|`|bWYhXrMDaa	It would look great with those highlights it would be a subtle change. I think you should where your hair natural but definately explain that you straighten your hair regularly|`|6HoWKncWaa	The general rule of thumb when going to a new stylist for the first time is to go in wearing your hair in it's normal style, the way you wear it most often.  If that's straightened for you, go in with it straightened.  It will be important for her to know the usual style for you anyway...if you usually part it on the right side, don't go in to the salon with it parted in the middle.  This ensures you get the cut you desire.<br>  <br>  As far as the highlights go, 1-2 shades of lighter brown may not be nearly as noticable as you'd like it to be.  If you want something different (since you don't want the blonde streaks, etc), maybe try getting lowlights instead, depending on how dark brown your hair is.  Lowlights are the opposite of highlights but they give a whole new dimension to your hair.  If the hair is VERY dark brown, a lighter brown highlight may work, but it may be more than 1-2 shades lighter than natural hair color.<br>  <br>  Good luck!

WFIkRvNHaa	No creo que ese sea el secreto..mas bien yo diría que son personas que tiene buen sentido de la estética ...que saben como combinar colores y también un poco de estudios o lectura sobre maquillaje...por que aun que no lo creas para ser un profesional es necesario estudiar y practicar mucho no importa la profesión que tengas|`|7340bfc18e6ad8c2b9b4fc28f708efa8aa	No, en absoluto. <br>  Y el mejor ejemplo soy yo...jejej..soy pésima dibujante, y excelente maquilladora (todas mis amigas me piden que las maquille y soy muy aficionada a la estética y el maquillaje en general).<br>  <br>  Además, el dibujo no me atrae nada, y en cambio el maquillaje sí.<br>  <br>  También conozco gente, por ejemplo una amiga mía, que es una maravillosa pintora y expone cuadros, y en cambio no sabe maquillarse ni maquillar a los demás.<br>  <br>  Son actividades totalmente diferentes, que no están conectadas entre sí.<br>  <br>  Todo depende de lo que te guste cada actividad. La pintura y el dibujo son más bien un don.

d0525a8d2ba99ba12fd06b8f3eaf5662aa	I was on accutane twice, I didnt feel depressed and it cleared up my acne, but there are other side effects, like very dry skin and vision sensitivity to light. Also, you must be on birth control to take this medication. Other then that,  I was pleased with the results.  Talk to your dermotologist.<br>  <br>  Best wishes.|`|a1cac6a6e70b595d8e55cc64d4d1d264aa	I was on accutane about 9 years ago and asides from less cystic acne i still suffer from constant pimples...i'm 30. accutane didn't make me depressed per se however your skin goes through a really nasty dry spell where it hurts to even smile. my lips were raw. i basically lived and died for petroleum jelly as lip gloss. depending on your personal situation...i'd explore other treatments first. but then again i've done them all and found Proactive works best on a more consistent basis. But i haven't been to a dermatologist since and i'm sure treatments have expanded in the last 9 years. i should check it out....anyways- good luck to you and my mother was on accutane twice....It worked for her after the 2nd round.|`|AA10311099	I am on accutane right now, and i am actually a very happy person. As your face gets clearer, you feel more confident about your appearance, etc. I don't know why someone would get depressed on a medicine that is actually helping them...<br>  <br>  But, yeah, your lips do get really dry. The only suggestion i can give is use Aquaphor as a lipgloss/chapstick...i got a sample from my derm. and it's really great! I put aquafina raspberry lip gloss on top of the aquaphor and it usually lasts for a little while!|`|lvMxLemSaa	my older sister uses that....it really helps....she said it doesn't make her depressed at all....but you should really consult a doctor about it (specifically a dermatologist) before getting any acutane...its kinda strong.... i wanted to use acutane too but the dermatologist said I wasnt old enough yet....

DJXMF8bfaa	No it will not make your hair straighter becuz u'll still have the same type of hair. Try using some moose or soft gel while flat ironing your hair.|`|qutCIUljaa	The hair tends to sit on the shoulders and molds around them in the shoulder length range. When I cut my hair below shoulders, it flips inward (which is worse for me).<br>  <br>  I like to have about 2 layers. One longer layer which tends to flip out, and on top a shorter layer above shoulder length which flips in or frames the face.|`|gJYHTleHaa	no it will make it curl more, you should definatly get some layers but none off the lenght, when you straighen it twist your wrist under .|`|bba4dea6a611e56db169dba42b0ce1f0aa	u prolly jus have split ends cuz my hair does that 2 when i hve them...so jus get ur ends clipped|`|h7xnzqQnaa	hairspray
nq5SWFSvaa	it is really great,but i suggest u buying a small bottle because as we all know that we all have different skin, u dont know it might make something different to ur sking so use it first by getting a small bottle and test it on a small area of ur skin if it works then just go on :D|`|342759ae65992ddcf5ee4f6d8aee4f07aa	tried it...<br>  but didn't like it that much...|`|PsxRTMyMaa	in my experience, it ends up working, but only after the bottle is almost gone, and you have to use it EVERYDAY, because if you skip one day, it wont really work. in the end, its not really worth it. you have to keep buying more, and have to use it everyday, but if your up for that kind of commitment, then go for it.|`|AA11434640	Yes, but remember that it only darkens the very top layer of your skin, so as you naturally lose dead skin cells, or if you exfoliate, you're going to lose some of the color, too. I've been using it for awhile now and thats the only real downside.|`|75NzrTs3aa	Yes, it will give you a bit of colour gradually.  It is not as noticeable as self-tan products though.|`|006ed0be5fe4d5038edb0687a8ef5597aa	Yes, I use the one for light skin tones.  Don't overuse or you'll end up rusty looking.|`|1b08883862cb444ce91ad529730cfccbaa	Someone else had asked this same question a while back, and I originally told them I hated it.  But recently I thought I'd give it a try again, using the new firming stuff they have out now.  Plus I got the darker kind in medium/tan (I'm very white).  I saw good results the first day.  It is true that it only colors the top layer of skin, but if you apply it every other night you should be good.|`|NkN4HoFpaa	Yes,but the results are not dramatic.|`|SxtdMexPaa	yep have it it works great!
AA10621612	What I would try is something like Oil of Olay radiance lotion. It has self tanners in it that build up, so you have less chance of getting those orange lines. <br>  Make sure to put sunblock on 20 min before  Most people don't reapply often enough.<br>  Scarred skin is so sensitive, I had road rash once, than I got sunburn on top ( ouch)<br>  I don't know about Dermablend, having never tried it, but I know there are foundations out there that are sweat  resistant. <br>  Also, there are places in Asia where it would be appropriate to cover up regardless of your own beliefs, so I hope you will take that into consideration.<br>  Good luck with all of  it!|`|CAYpusldaa	ulta cosmetics has a ton of waterproof sweat proof make up and concealers and you can try them first good luck|`|naUtCixfaa	a fake tan may not help because it can discolour -- its like tanning over a scar -- discolouration -- <br>  and while swimming you may want to remain covered, because you dont want the sun hitting it, and it is even more intense in the water because it is being reflected.

k3xSCxFraa	As far as I know, there are several ways to have hair extensions. If it's just for your formal, I would suggest getting your paws on some Clip-in hair extensions. Anything else will be more permanent and much more expensive. If you are looking for some sexy hair that lasts after Prom, there's another form of attaching hair extensions called "microlinks". They don't use heat or chemicals, and the extensions last for several months from what I hear.|`|CAYpusldaa	sewing weaving or gluing

See the first link below in my sources.  <br>  <br>  There's also a very helpful web site for curly hair - see the second link below.|`|vfYNFeGwaa	find a redken salon and have them do a chemistry system. this is not a chemical service! it raises the pH to a perfect level 6. keep doing them once a week until you feel as though your hair is more moisturized. i also suggest buying some all soft shampoo and conditioner or clear moisture shampoo and conditioner. (both made by redken) also get extreme anti snap! this will put protein back into your hair making it less brittle! hope this helps! DO NOT USE PANTENE! it will dry it out more in the long run! it has polymers in it which causes a buildup! which in time can  cause breakage! polymers are plastic. sure they make your hair feel soft and shiny but thats not your hair thats plastic!!
Hw0wTTC2aa	I started using Arbonne's revolutionary anti-aging system (hydrating wash, balancing toner, facial serum, transforming lift, corrective eye cream, day crème, and night crème) last year and absolutely love it! It makes me skin look radiant! It is specifically formulated to reduce the affects of sun damage, decrease fine lines and wrinkles, while it works to combat the visual signs of aging. The system consists of botanically based products that contain natural collagens (hyaluronic acid), giving your skin a natural lift and others to deeply condition and hydrate your skin. They're all pure, safe, beneficial, hypoallergenic, dermatologist tested, and formulated without alcohol, wax, dyes, chemicals, fragrances, acetone, or mineral oil which makes them perfect for all skin types. They're unlike any others on the market as they are formulated in Switerland and made with all 9 KEY anti-aging elements (KOJIC ACID, NANOSPHERES, COPPER, VITAMIN C, ALPHA & BETA HYDROXY ACIDS, PEPTIDES, BIO-HYDRIA, ELHIBIN & STIMUTEX, and ALPHA LIPOIC ACID), giving you maximum benefit. <br>  <br>  Their products are also formulated with nanosphere technology which makes them beneficial for all skin types and adjusts to your skins specific needs by applying more moisture in dry areas and less is oily areas. Research shows that 6 months continued use of this system will give a 68% decrease in DEEP density lines and wrinkles; however I started to notice results within a week or two. <br>  <br>  Arbonne allows their consumers to try before they buy. They also offer an option to become a wholesale buyer and saving 35-75% off. If you're not completely satisfied with the products, you can return them within 45 days. <br>  <br>  If you're interested in learning more, you can visit the website below or email me at jdio@myarbonne.com and I'll be happy to help you.|`|AA10177020	i love oil of olay- it has great moisturizers in it so you're skin won't get all flaky from the treatment- my favorite is the self heating face scrub with glycolic acid- it's a mini face peel and it leaves your skin so soft!!|`|CAYpusldaa	oil of olay|`|bb68241d8791000c504cf50f36e28b24aa	I do were well.just use soup and water.i soak my face in ice cold water every morning it greatest thing for shrinking the wrinkles then i wash it with dove soap.|`|LbnUR7Ycaa	Olay is a actually a great brand .

A brief list is below, but there are sure to be more.<br>  <br>  BROWN: Light browns, bronzes, soft purples, light blues (brown eyes tend to have smaller flecks of different colours, often green, and these colours help recognize the different flecks)<br>  BLUE: Delicate silvers and grays will give your eyes a soft, sheek look.<br>  HAZEL: Bronze eye shadow goes great with hazel eyes, because hazel eyes tend to be a variety of colours which the bronze can evenly reflect.<br>  GREEN: Green eyes are rare, so take advantage of this pretty and unique feature. Use a soft lilac, as it will bring out the green in your eyes. Combine with a soft brown or a pale gray.<br>  <br>  Now that you know a few of the basic colours that blend well with different eye colours, you can start experimenting. Take half an hour to an hour and just experiment in your free time. Blend colours and find unique blends that really work well. Have plenty of makeup remover on hand if you feel you will need it. Who knows? You may find a look you love!<br>  <br>  TIPS:<br>  <br>  -If your eyelids are slightly differently coloured than the rest of your face (this is common in many women) and if you want your eyeshadow to stay on longer, use this simple trick. If you wear foundation (preferably powder foundation) or a powder toner, apply a thin layer on your eyelids. Then dust on the eyeshadow. This helps to even out the tone of your skin while helping the eyeshadow have something to cling to, therefore keeping it on longer without requiring constant re-applying or touchups.<br>  <br>  -Put a darker colour or shade in the crease of your eyelid to make your eyes really stand out and "pop".<br>  <br>  -When applying pink eyeshadow, especially to paler eyes, don't apply too much, especially if you like to add it under the lower lashline. It can make your eyes look puffy and/or infected.<br>  <br>  Good luck!|`|a663f4d84f4c552e2564e36b54f9cbddaa	they say cool colors for your hair and eyes|`|jzf9V3KDaa	In general I'd say wear whatever you like, whatever colors you're attracted to.

Try the covergirl trublend bronzer called "Golden Sunrise". Just take a brush (after applying foundation)and blend it on the sides of your cheeks, nose, and forehead.Also try Jergens new tanner for face. If you want to have fierce looking eyes use brown eyeliner and brown shadow. Then apply a gold shadow to finish. And if you want playful eyes do the same thing in a purple or a green shadow. To finish off your eyes use "Lash Exact Waterproof mascara in a black or brown"(also by covergirl) Then play your look all off by applying a pink gloss(try" Wet & Wild").|`|eGwzN5Vraa	im actually a makeup artist for Clarins.

You can buy anything! It all pops and nothing looks wretched. Here's a tip, though...remember 1st grade when you learned about the color wheel and complementary colors? Here's where that comes into play. To make brown really pop, you should use it's complementary color, opposite from your brown (near orange, look on a more detailed wheel) on the color wheel. That color is blue. I don't know the exact color of your eyes, so experiment with different shades of blue, or look on the color wheel (link below) and scroll to where your brown appears. Look at what blue is across from it, probably darker, or try a mixture...trial and error from there. Have fun!|`|jR5oQjDSaa	I have brown hair and brown eyes.

American Laser has locations almost everywhere in the United States.  I also saw an infomercial about American Laser a few weeks ago on television.  American Laser is becoming more popular.  It probably costs more to get laser hair removal at American Laser, but you can be certain that your money will be spent well.|`|d5065693519b5b048f87de49a76bf961aa	Any laser treatment has significant risks.

Some suffered a lot of pain and swelling, <br>  Like all laser treatments costs are not cheap. You have to ascertain before you start on the number of treatmrnts you will need.
afab6b496cc4cf44dee95f839b81ef1daa	Keep it conditioned. Dont use a shampoo or a conditioner that will dry out your hair and that I mean if you have dry hair use a shampoo thats for dry hair, check the bottles and brands you're using. Dont do a lot of chemical services (color, perms, ect.). For the summer and in the sun use a leave-in conditioner. Get your hair cut 1inch every 3 months. Dont always use a hair dryer when drying your hair, let it air dry or dry naturally. Dont abuse your hair by putting a lot of product in it everyday and dont pull on it a lot.|`|8TgOg6aIaa	There are several things that you can do to make your hair more smooth, straight, and manageable without using chemicals or heat. Moisture is extremely critical  to make  your hair straight. However, you need to infuse your hair with long-lasting moisture that won’t weigh your hair down.<br>  <br>  Tip #1:  Do conditioning pre-wash treatments to your hair before shampooing it. Simply whip up 2 tablespoons of Mayonnaise, 1 teaspoon of lemon juice, and a 1 egg. Let it remain on your hair for at least an hour. The lemon juice will act as a straightener. The mayonnaise and egg will strengthen and moisturize your hair. Do this 2-3 times a week.<br>  <br>  Tip # 2: Buy a high quality, all natural hydrating and straightening hair care product for your hair. I have tried several hair care products for African American hair, including Carol's Daughter, Giovanni, Ojon, KeraCare, and Motions. However, I recommend using GodHead Silky Smooth Hydrating Shampoo & Conditioner. It will hydrate and smooth your hair while infusing your scalp with essential oils made to grow and treat dry, coarse, and damaged hair. The product also contains moisturizing Aloe Vera, Coconut Oil, Vitamin E, and Jojoba, which will heal and moisturize your strands and make your hair more bouncy, shiny, smooth, and healthy.  The product will also soften and detangle your hair better than most, if not all, products on the African American hair care market. As a result, your hair will be more manageable and more straight.Of course, it will not straighten your hair like a relaxer, but, after flat ironing your hair, your hair will lay down and not puff up. And, the more you use it, the less you will need to  flat iron your hair. Go to wwwdiscoverb4acom to find the products. It is available under their ethnic hair care section.<br>  <br>  If you don't want to waste any more money, I would buy this product.  But, if you go with another brand of products, make you stray away from traditional, unnatural hair care products available for purchase in most drugstores or beauty supply stores. They contain synthetic emulsifiers and harsh detergents, such as Ammonium Lauryl Sulfate, Phosphates, Dimethicone, and Sodium Lauryl Sulfate. Unfortunately, these products are loaded with toxins and chemicals and will strip your hair of moisture and nutrients it needs to be soft, smooth, healthy, and hydrated.|`|e555953c78993ae5e5a4dc18bce6f22caa	Keep it washed and conditioned. Try some anti-breakage products too. A good product that is both conditioner and anti-breakage is Infusium 23.

I have tried this numerous times on my own hair and it works, but you will need to wash it out thouroughly in the sink and not the shower<br>  <br>  I got this from <a href="http://www.cosmeticsdiary.com/hair-mayonnaise.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.cosmeticsdiary.com/hair-mayon...</a><br>  <br>   Depending on the length of your hair, apply  approximately 1/2 cup of mayonnaise to your dry  hair.

When your body is dehydrated, your hair shows it. Dry hair equals brittle hair. Brittle hair equals split ends.<br>  <br>  2) Buy High Quality ALL NATURAL Hair Care Products<br>  Unnatural hair care products are a no-no for someone who wants long-lasting, healthy hair growth and moisturized hair. Find a hair  product that contains essential oils, natural herbs, and vitamin rich nutrients your hair needs to survive.  Look for products with ingredients such as: Aloe Vera, Citrus Fruits, Jojoba, Vitamin E, Coconut Oil, Grape Seed, Honey, and Amino Acids, and Ylang Ylang.  Natural oils add moisture to the hair.<br>  <br>  Although there are several natural hair care products on the market, make sure you read the ingredient list. Most “natural” and drugstore hair products still contain phosphates, sodium lauryl sulfate, petroleum, mineral oil, and other lab created humectants that ultimately damage your hair and dry it. <br>  <br>  I use GodHead Emergency Split End Repair Conditioner and Silky Smooth Hydrating Conditioner on my clients with dry, damaged, color-treated, or splitting hair. It is a great restorative treatment combo. It makes the ends soft and supple and your hair shiny, healthy, bouncy, and smooth. The base ingredient in both products is Aloe Vera, a hair and skin natural healer, and natural oils, like jojoba, coconut, and grape seed. I see an improvement in the condition of my clients hair after two uses. You can find them at a salon near you or skip the upcharge and buy them online wwwdiscoverb4acom.<br>  <br>  3) Manage split ends from home:<br>  <br>  Give yourself homemade protein treatments. Apply 3 tablespoons of avocado, 1 egg, and 1 tablespoon of honey to your hair. Let it sit on your hair for 30 minutes.

d61546f907ad89f5849cc56da60170a8aa	Proactiv works wonders. I'm now nearly 22 years old, but I developed what would become moderate acne at 19. After trying dozens of over-the-counter products, I finally broke down and decided to give Proactiv a try. Before I go on about how well it works, let me paraphrase the FAQ on Proactiv's website: <br>  <br>  You should notice visible results within 6 to 8 weeks. A complete clearing of your complexion will take 3 to 6 months. <br>  <br>  This is absolutely true. I saw no improvement for about 8 weeks, and just as I was about to give up, I noticed that my breakouts were less frequent, and I could finally smile without my face hurting somewhere. So, I stuck with it, and in about 4 months, my complexion became perfectly clear. I mean absolutely clear. It was such a shock, in fact, that I thought maybe my whole acne problem was just a fluke. After I ran out of Proactiv I decided it would be safe to stop using it; let me tell you, this was a big mistake. I broke out worse than I ever had before, and over-the-counter products, again, weren't doing the trick. Finally I started to use Proactiv again, and it's working like it did before. I'm currently on month 3, and I haven't had a severe breakout in about 3 weeks. <br>  <br>  So, here's the moral of my story: Proactiv does indeed work, but you MUST be patient. It will take a while for it to work, and your use must be consistent. But, believe me, it all pays off. Just give it a chance!|`|niE7GzM8aa	Well the commercials say like 2 days..... NOT GONNA HAPPEN lol! it depends on what kinda skin u have, my skin used to be kinda bad... but then i used it after about 2 weeks my face was completly cleared... its a good product, just takes some time|`|Bm8cVP3daa	its supposed 2 start after a week or 2 but it shood b totally cleared in a month or 2 so u shood start seein sum good results soon otherwise return it n try a new product|`|Jc89EnMEaa	I have had Proactiv for several months. i dont really see results like clearing up scars or marks left over, but it just helps me keep a the overall number of pimples down.

Hopefully it'll clear up any leftover marks too!!|`|OJleGwaHaa	abour 2 weeks|`|bYLhFUzWaa	If it doesnt start working in a month tell them to switch you to the stronger based proactive. Its the same price and it helps me better|`|QSin0YFuaa	well i'm past week three and i've seen minor results. and my face was horrible. so it is helping. keep using it. and i know for a fact Proactiv will work because i've used it last year and it clearded my face completely and that's why i got back to it. if you have more questions feel free to ask me. acne has taken a downfall in my life. and i dont want you to suffer. so just stick to if for 2 months. it'll help and you'll be glad you did. :)<br>  <br>  oh. and someone mentioned about marks. it will clear those up too.|`|QppJ7APWaa	It might take another week.  I've used it for a year and have seen great resluts. Don't get discouraged!  It takes time.  If you need a quick fix for your acne, use the refining mask.  Make sure you don't touch your acne or let your hair touch it.  The oils irritate the acne and make them worse.  Wash your hands before each time you wash your hands!|`|dSVUI1KGaa	i used proactiv once and it took some time to see results but not after just two weeks like most people say,but if you stop using it it will stop working and you will break out so your best bet is to keep using it:) wait a little while longer|`|kNzKJ3iGaa	I started to see result right away, but dramatic results took about a month.

Yes frequent use of lipgloss does change the colour of your natural lips. Also the sun can damage your lips making them darker as well. The best thing u could do to stop them from getting darker is use a lip chap, such as blistex that contains at least a SPF of 30, then if you want put your lip gloss on over. This will protect ur lips from the sun and avoid them from getting darker.|`|dQSLOxnlaa	#1 - first of all dont't drink to much of tea and cofee.<br>  #2 - to make your lips pink and soft spread unboiled cow milk on your lips than keep it for 5to6 minutes and wash it out with cold water.<br>         After that mix corriender leaf paste and lemon juice and put it on leaf again for 5to6 minutes and wash it with cold watey, repeat this process every alternate 2 times a day.<br>             and don't lick ur lips.(personal experience)|`|fPMHECbVaa	you need to scrub your lips with a wet toothbrush and put some vitamin e oil on your lips.|`|qBeOsHevaa	Apply foundation on and around lips and then define the look of your lips using the lip liner.<br>  If you lips are naturally full and large, don't use the lip liner though you can soften the edge using a Q-tip and avoid glossy and shiny lip color.<br>  If you have thin lips, use light shades to make them appear fuller. Define the lip using the neutral lip pencil from slightly beyond your natural lip line and then apply lipstick covering up lip defining line. Another trick is to apply white shadow on center of both lips over lipstick very lightly and spread it gently.<br>  If your upper lip is too thin or does not have a good shape, outline it with the lip liner similar to your lipstick and in the center portion, draw a second line giving it the precise shape using a brown pencil. Apply color including the brown line. This will make your lips look fuller.<br>  To hide lip lines, apply lipstick vertically<a href="http://www.facenbodycare.com/Beauty_Tips_for_Luscious_Lips.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.facenbodycare.com/Beauty_Tips...</a>

As long as you're a good person and follow "the golden rule" you'll be better off than debating about skin colors.

I find the air conditioning really dries out my skin. I think most people feel a bit gross after such long flights. I usually take some facial cleansing wipes with me to freshen up every now an again. Something really refreshing is good, witch hazel, tea tree, that kind of thing. You can usually get them in packs small enough to fit in your purse. Also, take a light, oil free moisturizer with you to stop your skin from drying out. Avoid something too heavy or oily because that could end up making your skin feeling even more gross. You are allowed to take cosmetics on board with you so long as they're in a clear ziploc bag and they don't exceed 100ml.<br>  You can also take bottles of water with you, so long as you buy them after you've gone through security, Make sure you drink plenty of water to keep your skin hydrated.<br>  <br>  I'd avoid wearing make-up too. It'll clog your pores and make your skin feel gross. If you really want to wear make-up, try a light, tinted moisturizer rather than foundation and concealer, it'll be less heavy on your skin.<br>  <br>  As for your hair, you'd probably be better off tying it up if you can. I just put mine in loose pigtails so it's not uncomfortable if I want to sleep. If you still have trouble with it, once you've put lotion on your face, run your hands over your hair. The little excess lotion on your hands will help control any flyaways. Just make sure there's not too much left on your hands, you don't want your hair to go all greasy, especially if it's quite fine.|`|bbrwgrP7aa	For your face- buy some Dove facial moisturizing cream to periodically massage into your face while on the plane.

(Don't spend too much money on them either, I have found that those cheap brands work just as good as expensive brands).<br>  <br>  For your hair- buy some hair static guard. Also, style your hair in a pony tail so that it won't get too crazy. If you don't like tying/wearing your hair up, buy some static free gel or mousse to try.<br>  <br>  Good luck, and have a safe flight! :)|`|c3fde71f5b10ef751fe71f64a2202551aa	You're in tight quarters with a bunch of nasty random people who may be festering with who knows what bacteria and hidden horrors and your worried about greasy skin.

Blend the pulp in blender till smooth.  Add 1/2 the mixture too 1/2 bottle of your shampoo and mix well.  Put the other half in another bottle or container with cover.  Once or twice a week (whenever you wash your hair) rub some of the pulp your scalp.  Leave in for a few minutes.  Shampoo with shampoo/pulp mixture, rinse well and condition.  It's not an overnight miracle, so don't get discouraged.  Do this until you see results.  Good luck.
KBzDedgvaa	What I do is very simple and cheap! I wash my face with just a mild cleanser twice a day, and I use an apricot scrub about 3 times a week.  In the morning I use a cotton ball and apply hydrogen peroxide to my face, and then use an oil free moisturizer (I use clean and clear morning glow). At night after I wash my face I just apply the hydrogen peroxide. It works pretty well for me, better than all the other acne medications I have used, and a huge bottle of hydrogen peroxide, which you can find at any store, is a dollar if not less. Hope this helps!!!|`|fHxYh6ZHaa	lol i had and kinda have the same problem. try putting toothpaste on ur pimples it helps by drying the pimples out and it takes the redness out. but be careful not to put too much because it will leave a weird burn or rash type of mark(that happened to me and it look horrible) lol i tried these creams too but they don't work on my face either. i use a simple home remidie and it takes my pimples away and i only get them occasionally like once a month but thats totally cool...better than having a head full of them! i mix baking soda with water and mix it into like a paste then i wash my face with it before i sleep. also wash your face with cold water...hot water irritates your skin and it causes acne. also, don't stress out because tension is the #2 cause for acne. so don't worry because not a lot of people don't have PERFECT skin not even celebrities because it's all makeup! good luck!|`|GF1si26Daa	ACNE FREE its just like proactive but cheaper and u can get it at drugstores so no credit card needed|`|AA11286983	Honey, ProActiv is not considered expensive in this arena.  However, it sounds as if your drying products are not working for you.<br>  <br>  I would suggest saving your pennies and getting products with Retinol in them.  While now considered an anti-aging ingredient, Retinol products were originally created to...fight acne!  And they do it very well.<br>  <br>  In addition, I'd like to suggest that you may be over-drying your skin.  Surprised?  Skin that is over-cleansed or cleansed with products that are too drying can "fight back" by producing too much oil, which will cause pore blockages and blemishes.<br>  <br>  Also, if your blemishes are "monthly" just keep up with your skin care and your blemishes will be small, infrequent, and disappear quickly.|`|Tkl5LK1uaa	i did a combo of the clearisil three step thing and these little chewable pills that were in walmart. i can't remember the name of the pills but it came with a 2 month supply and "vanishing crem". it had a box for women and a box for men. kind of generic looking clear-ish packaging.  it worked great for a few days for me, but mine came back(i later found out i had a staph infection). my teenage niece also tried the combination and it worked great for her. hope that helps.|`|fc819c6cf43cf393575c2e293ab36198aa	I dont know how much proactive is, but Arbonne has a great system and is about $60 every 30 days or so.

TjPwxbuJaa	I've answered you before on this, but it appears that your goal has gotten larger. Well, I've served as a firefighter with large stretched ears, and it hasn't been a problem. It definitely hasn't been a safety issue, as the nomex hood protects your head and neck, and if you are worried about metal, you can always wear wood or organic plugs, or just leave them out.  However, I can't speak for all departments. It could be that there may be somebody in charge who is conservative and simply doesn't like them and will claim they are a safety issue. I don't know.  I understand why you want them, and if it's something you really want, then do it but realize like a lot of things, there are potential costs. I have them and they haven't hindered me in my career goals as of yet.  Also, I should warn you that since your goal has increased to 7/8 inch, you will find it addicting and once you get there, you will likely want to go to 1 inch or beyond. That was my experience. I swore I wouldn't go beyond 1/2 inch, and I now have 1 1/2 inch stretched ears.|`|bTScpdbqaa	I shouldn't think so - being a firefighter is about saving lives, not looking 'smart'.  Unless it's impractical, like it means it's difficult to get head gear or anything on i'm pretty sure it will be OK.  They're not very common I don't think, so I guess that's why you've never seen a firefighter with one on!|`|m1493Va4aa	well the guy above me said he knows a firefighter with plugs  soooo  i think it's possible    mmm you'll be a firefighter with tats and plugs  very sexsay    bow chi ca wa wa    -Kandy    ;D|`|9e0b3eb053495521ed772cef2058be0faa	Personally, I would keep them fairly small until you`re hired and in the union (assuming they are unionized where you are - they are here). I can`t see it being a problem unless there is some kind of safety hazard (I can`t imagine what that would be - but I know beards aren`t allowed because of the breathing aparatus) But you could face discrimination from the person doing the hiring.    I never had a problem with my stretched lobes (only 2 gauge at the time) or tattoos when I was with the ambulance service, but they were hidden when I was going through the hiring process.|`|lU8e0VQFaa	They have to be able to pass inspection in their uniform (like a cop or military). So I would highly doubt that 7/8 would be ok, even if they are smaller with jewelry out. Plus, since the holes are still rather large you run the risk of catching them on something and having them rip (yes I know a helmet mostly covers it but it's still a possibility).|`|NUcmCNGraa	uhm, i think you'll be the sexiest firefighter there is!|`|gzTS429Laa	i really dont know.  why dont ya ring up the firestation (not 999  lol) or visit to ask, or maybe a school/uni teacher will know?  ask around mate x|`|Dr3mi0f4aa	LMAO DYLAN YOU LOOK COOKED

L9ySbDvMaa	Yes, coloring your hair with koolaid does work. I just did this myself yesterday. I have really dark brown hair, and so does my friend, and I was able to color our hair a bold red without bleaching our hair first. All I did was pour a packet of koolaid into a cup and added not even a teaspoon of water. We only did bangs and streaks at the time. I read online after I did our hair that you can use conditioner an djust leave it in there..but i used water and it was fine. I then straightened our hair instead of using the blow dryer and it turned out great. Not fried..not messed up..just red! I don't know how long the color lasts, I just did this yesterday and plan to add more streaks ((I really like the results)). I'm just telling you my success from using koolaid and how easy and cheap it was compared to going out and spending money. I hope this helps you. And there are a number of sites that can tell you how to do this..just search on google for..how to dye your hair with koolaid. :)|`|lys5kB9Daa	yea i tried it in high school. you have to have real blonde hair to begin with, brown wont show up at all. and even in the blonde hair it only last like a day or 2 until you wash it. you have to buy a bottle of color developer (they have at places like sally beauty or it comes in some hair dye boxes) it looks like conditioner and you mix the kool-aid into some of it to get the kool-aid into cream form and just put it on like reg dye (dry hair) leave for half hour rinse out. but it's kind of a pain seeing as how it only lasts a day.|`|WpaQKpckaa	its not so temporary.. im telling you my friend had koolaid in her hair for a good six months before it wore out a little.|`|vxjOpKruaa	First you have to bleach you hair.<br>  Next you need to mix up the Kool Aid. Choose a color you like, the brighter the better. Mix two packets of unsweetened mix with a double quarter sized amount of conditioner. I cannot stress enough that this must be unsweetened Kool Aid. If you use the sugar-added type, your hair will be a mess. If you haven't bleached your hair first, go wet it. Put on a pair of gloves and apply the Kool Aid to your hair. If this is not enough to thickly coat the hair, mix up some more and continue. Wrap your head in plastic wrap and leave it. Leave it as long as you can stand it, all day if you can. The longer you leave it, the better the color will adhere to the hair.|`|YGhtWspiaa	You dont.<br>  <br>  Who told you that? You go out and buy hair dye. Follow the instructions.|`|BabNC5pMaa	just pour it on babyyy! ;]|`|uvOhOUllaa	i wouldn't try that...|`|sTvZSmBwaa	it depends on how vivid you want the colors to be... <br>  if you want to die it brightly first you will have to stip the color out of your hair naturally, and that takes bleach... then you make a paste with kool aid and water and put it on the stipped hair...<br>  If you just want some cool colorful "highlights" all you got to do is make a paste with kool aid and water and put it in your hair... <br>  This is VERY temporary if you don't use the stripping method... will wash out after a few washes or so...<br>  If you looking for natural dies, try henna... it's a redish brown tho, not funky like kool aid!<br>  good luck!|`|nALZjZZgaa	I wouldn't do it if I were you.<br>  Just go to a shop and buy some bright dye or something. Most home dyes dont work. I tried to dye my hair... with food colouring!! I tried to put some red bits in it (I'm blonde) and it turned out bright orange, it didnt fade for aages and i still get teased bout it sometimess.<br>  Buy some dye?<br>  Or get it done at the hairdressers, they'll be professionals and you know it'll turn out right - but it'll be more expesnsive<br>  <br>  x|`|b23QlMvLaa	I wouldn't do it with kool-aid or jell-o.  Judging from the times I've seen people who used that, it looks terrible.  If you want a funky color, go to a beauty supply store and get a dye there that is meant to be a hair color, not food.|`|AuaL29Eaaa	Don't do it you'll have red **** all on ur face and clothes. It runs if u sweat.|`|0509a790fe9f326fe979c75e17a81017aa	I'd say, make if as thick and smooth as you can to have the most color.  Just don't put too much water in it.|`|Nnplp5Qqaa	you can do that?!|`|Baxqbf4oaa	it wont work|`|rDT0fqx9aa	So you've decided to change your hair color to something a little bolder. Well, good for you. But before we begin, you need to make sure that's this is going to be ok. People, especially parents, tend to freak over wild hair color. So if you have a real nine to five job, or you're under eighteen or still living with your parents, make sure you have given this some thought. You may just want to buy a wig instead.<br>  <br>  Still with me? Great! Now, first of all, you need to determine if bleaching is going to be necessary. Brunettes will need to bleach to achieve any kind of noticeable color, as will redheads. If you do have red hair, please understand that this may not work at all. Red is the hardest color to dye over. If you have darker hair, but all you're looking for is a tint of color, you don't need to bleach. Blondes will not need to either.<br>  <br>  Do you want streaks or over all color? The basic instructions are the same for both. The difference is that streaks should be separated from the rest of the hair by wrapping in foil.<br>  <br>  Bleaching is relatively simple. Buy a bleach kit from the store. You want a kit that specifically states bleaching. A blonding kit will not be enough. Mix the ingredients according to the directions in the box and apply to hair in a well-ventilated room. Put on a shower cap and wait the recommended amount of time. At this point, check the hair to see how much it has bleached out. If not enough, put the cap back on and wait another ten minutes. Keep checking your hair until it had turned a yellowish white color. Then go rise the bleach completely out. Do not use the conditioner that comes with the kit. This will close off your hair to the color.<br>  <br>  Next you need to mix up the Kool Aid. Choose a color you like, the brighter the better. Mix two packets of unsweetened mix with a double quarter sized amount of conditioner. I cannot stress enough that this must be unsweetened Kool Aid. If you use the sugar-added type, your hair will be a mess. If you haven't bleached your hair first, go wet it. Put on a pair of gloves and apply the Kool Aid to your hair. If this is not enough to thickly coat the hair, mix up some more and continue. Wrap your head in plastic wrap and leave it. Leave it as long as you can stand it, all day if you can. The longer you leave it, the better the color will adhere to the hair.<br>  <br>  Over time, the color will fade out. If you want it out quicker, toothpaste will speed up this process, but if you bleached the hair or you have really light hair normally, it will not remove the color totally.|`|Xwis4lJhaa	Take packets of unsweetened Kool-Aid and mix it with a little bit of water (just enough so it's not quite a paste but not really watery).  Bring it to a boil on the stove.  Let it cool for a minute or two and dip the hair you want colored in mix.  Let it sit for about 10 mins then wash out the excess.|`|PAa9XIbkaa	wow.thats dumb.go to a salon, if you want temporary dye they can do it.whoever thinks dyueingg your hair with koolaid works is dumb. koolaid is just a bunch of sugar and food coloring with water, it doesnt have the chemicals or anything needed.|`|vmg0WyxNaa	I did it and it lasted about 4 weeks.

CRozjN6vaa	I stopped eating all grains. If it was a seed I don't eat it. If it was intended to feed a seed I ate it. This also rules out rice and potatoes. I only eat fruits veggies,  lean cuts of meat and seafood. In my first six weeks I lost 22 lbs. It stayed off, in fact right now I sit 8 lbs off my peak condition at 20 years old. We are not genetically engineered to digest seeds. We can but our bodies see this as emergency food and tries to store it for lean times to come. So tell your ancestral genes that it is the season of succulent fruit. Then don't let it think hard times are coming no more than 1 serving of a flour based treat ( cookie cake pastry) .

I wouldn't recommend any fad diets and just go for the healthy eating and exercise if you want to tone up|`|ZAofj1X8aa	you will lose 10 lbs in 2 weeks i promise if you follow the low carb diet or also called Atkins, it sucks really bad, but it works, and if you're playing lacrosse it may only take you a week, idk. for breakfast eat eggs anyway and any meat, and you can eat as much as you want, for lunch eat some cheese and some more meat, and then for dinner eat a big salad with cheese, eggs, bacon, tomatoes, and full fat ranch dressing. that's what i did and it just came off with no exercise, but you can't cheat, you have to stick to it. look up low carb on Google or something"<br>  <br>  u should have lost more wait doin your sport ...u don't no gogle dos not always tell the truth? ask ur doctor|`|a88b0f44a1d7abe4bce01e6a248dbc64aa	only if you don't over do it. <br>  <br>  what the doctor told me once is that  your body doesn't know if you are stuck on a deserted island or not, so when you go without food for a long while and you finally eat something it will retain it. so i recommend for you to eat a lot of light meals. <br>  <br>  think about is like a campfire. if you feed it small sticks, it will get bigger and bigger but if you just dump a big log in it it will slow way down.<br>  <br>  so a lot of little meals = good<br>  one big = one not good.

1CQISjMIaa	i think the haircut will suit you very much. I like it. When you go to your hairdresser, take the picture with you but explain that you want it a little less 'extreme'. You can change the colours as well, if you want to add colours.<br>  Good Luck!<br>  <br>  By the way, you're kinda cute, lol =P|`|fB49H9Obaa	the way you have your first pic is cool, that's how i have it. just trim the back so that it doesn't start to look like a mullet. btw im sure you prefer answers from girls but im bored, lol.|`|8UtLYssXaa	I actually didn't like the hair cut you wanna do but I personally think that you'll look so cute if you just get the sides and the back short and spiky up the top.....|`|VIFxtHdPaa	Cut you hair from the side, <br>  get some gel, <br>  and make a fohawk.
AuaL29Eaaa	the gap. they have a style called Curvy fit. <br>  and most urban styles fit girls with hips.<br>  Dereon, akademiks, apple bottom, etc...|`|KPebdUzqaa	If you're normally a size "0" you most certainly DO NOT have an "hourglass figure", you need to go look up what that phrase means...|`|o1ibwPKPaa	I have the same problem as you but I have found that most pairs of Silver Jeans fit me. SIlver also makes jean capris and shorts.|`|rf4KHt4baa	I have the exact same problem with pants, although without the hourglass figure.  i shop at American eagle, they have great sale deals in smaller sizes, target has some great fitting sizes, especially if your a bit taller and keep getting stuck with pants that are too short because you need it for the waist, Kohl's has great size  pants along with Deb.  i would shy away from aeropostale as in my experience their pants are very pig for a size 0.  also, depending on your height you may even try petite pants as they tend to be for the skinnier, but shorter.|`|SXrjZYmgaa	I have the same problem (although I haven't been a size zero since I was your age). There are no great answers. I have to set aside whole days for shopping when I have to buy jeans because I just have to try on pair after pair until I find somethign that works. If you have a Deb at your local mall, I would suggest trying there. Quite a few of their brands are made for women of color (which I am not, but I've got the hips and butt for it) and they tend to fit better and around the curves. My problem is that I have to go a size up for my hips, but that always makes the waist too big. Good luck finding what you need!|`|33ad7557ca0d7c2188f6f4d4f5e9f6bbaa	You might not want to shop and places like hco, or aeropostale for jeans because their jeans are more straight legged. old navy is a great place to find tons of sizes and fits. steve and berry's is also good but their zippers are cheap and break easily. walmart and target have good fits but i'm not sure they carry 0s. hope i helped :)|`|ubnJbsLxaa	PLEASE DONT SHOP AT HOLLISTER or A&F or AERO.<br>  That may be asking way to much, your thirteen.<br>  I would take a whole day to go to every store in the mall. and try on EVERY pair of jeans, except the ones metioned above.<br>  Your thirteen so you are probably easily swayed by hollister and other crap like that. I went into a Lord and Taylor and found the perfefct pair of jeans, however they were 168 bucks. Shop around, you never know.|`|UB6rjU5Vaa	im very curvy to and have a hard time finding jeans that fit!, but old navy jeans  fit me pretty good, you should try those out|`|2pEiG2MPaa	Off the Wall and A&F fit well I find.|`|0S5ihmiZaa	yes|`|4hWSai1Haa	same here.... plus i'm kinda short so it makes it worse.

rYX6Owfraa	yes its over the counter.  you can get it at any drug store. its probably like $6|`|eytlIKITaa	Yes you can buy it at wal mart- over the counter- it's not all that expensive.  Just make sure you follow the directions- you have to put it on at night, before bed.      Have you tried Secret Clinical?    Really?

TTnhPnohaa	My grandma uses perfect 10, it completely covers grey and she doesn't have ONE grey hair in sight :) !!! It's by CLAIROL ( Nice'n'Easy)<br>  <br>  <br>   BEST OF LUCK!!!! And the easiest way is to go to a salon, but yeah, EXPENSIVE!!! LUCK!!<3 PS if its just a few you could pluck or use that hair dying wand stick thing, it looks like mascara but is actually hair dye. you could probably buy any of these things at shoppers or superstore|`|sCR5nbZhaa	Well if it is only a few stray grey hairs, I would just pull them out! But if it's more than a few, and your serious about dying your hair. I suggest starting with a semi permanent color (which is WAY less wrecking to the hair) Loreal Color Spa carries a shade that is dark brown, but is actually very very black!!|`|68pQcnINaa	get root touching hair dye like.. l'orel or what evers there. they all are good.. and do the same.  and get the color that matches your exact hair color the best|`|zvC3wsntaa	i dont know.. but if its just a FEW gray hairs.. the best and easiest way is to just PULL THEM OUT! :D|`|d4557f7e61d1c17f8559a35c72dedb33aa	buy one of the sticks that look like mascarra but is actually hair dye. its fast and easy. try Sally's|`|xtOhapROaa	pluck them... or just use one of them stick thingys... then you don't have to dye and damage all of your hair...
AA11813834	I use fluid line by Mac. My favorite colors are black track and dip down.|`|AA12391930	I like liquid eyeliner because I feel like I'm going to poke my eyes out with the pencil kind.  However, a little goes a long way with the liquid stuff.  It's easy to get raccoon eyes if you aren't careful.|`|VpG08kciaa	I use pencil eyeliner in brown for day, and black for night. I apply it in a sideways 'v' on the outer corners of my eyes, like ('<' or '>'). Good luck! Oh, and don't go overboard with the thickness!|`|031c1e7bb47e848ee50db939b909030eaa	i use a very soft kohl pencil on the inner rims (MAC is the best) and for the lash line on the outside i use a retractable one, the one i use is Bourjois and it's got wax in it so it won't smudge down my face. and for the top lid i use the pencil again.<br>  <br>  it does depend on your colouring, but i really think black looks best and most striking. i use a brown waterproof pencil for the smoky smudgy look, but right now i'm into midnight blue colours.<br>  <br>  liquid liner i wouldn't really recommend, especially if you're just starting out in the world of eyeliner. it's very awkward and difficult to use and control.|`|AA10565292	For me I love the retractable eye liner for everyday use.  For a more dramatic look I'd use a pencil to blend better.|`|oPv9G6ujaa	I use Barry M or Rimmel, i think theyre the best and not too pricey. Barry M has a range of brighter colours and glitzy colours whereas i buy black and brown Rimmel eyeliner.<br>  When yout applying it, be careful not to poke yourself in the eyeball! And dont overdo it, you dont want panda eyes :P<br>  Good luck :)|`|42lexo8Haa	I use pencil and crayon eyeliner. Sometimes in charcoal and other times in black. I would smudge but I'm very bad at it so i don't reccomend you to smudge. Keep your make-up neat and natural.|`|515c7985787d152b2140408e1ce74753aa	Hi. well, the color is mainly depending on your eye color. I have dark brown eyes so i use a metallic blue eyeliner but i don't over-do it. if i don't do that, i usually use a light brown color. if you have green or blue eyes...probably some sort of brown eyeliner because black will not blend with your eyes. I say usually brown eye liner is the way to go. Black eyeliner can make your eyes too dark or they just won't blend with your eyecolor. I hope this helps. Good Luck. =]|`|YhTqC4j9aa	I use Clinique (really black) and it works very well. Unlike most pencil eyeliners, it has a round end that you can twist, so it doesnt poke your eyes out. It moves wherever you want it to move. It also has a smudger on the other side of the eyeliner if you want to go for a smokey eye look. <br>  <br>  Its also allergy free, and its about $15. Im sure other brands work just as well but I use Clinique and it works well. Its sold at Sephora, Macys, Dillards, Saks Fifth Avenue, and other department stores. <br>  <br>   If you want to go for a funky look with different colors, use Urbay Decay. It has colors from tropical blue, green, purple, red, ect. I use the green one on the sides and it looks cool.|`|lBPfrhCxaa	I use MAC FluidLine eyeliner..i love it...you gotta use a brush to apply but it stays on all day and it doesnt smudge!

tDU347knaa	It sounds like it was a whitening toothpaste. If it was, then there's nothing you can do. The spots are not removable.|`|AA11330407	Did you wash it in the washing machine or just in the sink? I don't know why but toothpaste will not come out of my clothes unless I actually put it through a wash cycle. All the dabbing and wiping with a washcloth seems to do nothing but make it worse. If you've washed it and the spot is still there try making a paste out of baking soda and water. Rub it on the spot and let it set for a few minutes then rinse and put it through a wash cycle. i hope this helps!

AA12246142	cuando apliques el maquillaje ten la cara bien limpia y humectada con una crema facial que sea para miel mixta a grasa.<br>  busca entre un maquillaje que sea hipoalergenico, de preferencia con fps. actualmente existen muchas presentaciones para el maquillaje: liquido, en barra, etc yo creo que vas a tener que experimentar hasta que encuentres el que mas te acomode o te guste. personalmente los de barra me parecen muy buenos.<br>  cuando te vayas a dormir, retira bien todo maquillaje y no olvides volver a humectar tu cara.<br>  ahora, para combatir tu problema de acne hay cremas y productos mas especializados que las marcas comunes que encontramos en cualquier supermercado. yo he encontrado Vichy muy muy buena, te la recomiendo. por ahi tambien estan biotherm y clinique, que tambien valen la pena.<br>  remedios mas caseros, hay una crema de concha nacar y tepezcohuite que venden en tiendas naturistas, es buenilla y ademas huele muy rico, y una mascarilla de miel de abeja (natural) y azucar mascabado, te la aplicas dandote suaves pero firmes masajes por varios minutos, la dejas unos 15 o 20 minutos, la enjuagas, te lavas y luego aplicas tus cremas. es una verdadera maravilla, ayuda mucho a disminuir cicatrices. 100% comprobado.<br>  suerte|`|zkS6j5juaa	Pues, recomendación de abuelita (ya sabes, no fallan) ponte concha nacar, venden la crema en muchos lados... se supone que lo mejor es dejarla reposar en la noche al aire libre para que le caiga el sereno... borra las cicatrices es muy buena|`|16ddacc8eee3d40960f863532a5a42d9aa	no se-|`|qlPMbAV4aa	Alguno con que tenga como base Concha Nacar para ayudar a desaparecer la cicatriz (si no es muy grande)

They fit my body the best.  Levi's cost around $30-40 and Sevens $50-70.  I have wide hips and a big butt, and Levi's don't gape at my waist like most other jeans do.  Also, because I have a long torso, I can't wear pants from places like Abercrombie and Wet Seal.  Their pants are just too low for my body type.|`|AdqfouDTaa	pacsun..it's the only place near my house that'll fit me....<br>  <br>  about 50 bucks for two pairs<br>  <br>  but i only have three pairs of jeans<br>  <br>  i got a couple abercrombie pairs once and they fit great! i wish i  could go there....|`|q5lreoiWaa	Care for them correctly, always wash them inside out with the waist button fastened so they retain their shape and original color.If you spend your hard earned money make them last.

Dramitically Different is very light, even the lotion, and it has never clogged my pores when I switch in the winter from the gel.<br>  The only thing that bothers me is that the Nivea is a cream, and that overtime may clog your pores.<br>  Whatever is cheaper, go with that.  But Clinique isn't that expensive when compared with a lot of other department store brands.|`|2vHIn8VMaa	Nivea|`|XspPX1Ugaa	NIVEA|`|H2tkkWyPaa	Nivea works best for me I'd use that all the time.
m4Zjdzc6aa	You can't make yourself taller. <br>  You do not need to be thinner (don't be stupid). <br>  No one cares about the difference between "dark dark dark brown hair" and black, and your parents are quite right not to let you dye your hair. <br>  What do you want to do with your skin? Try fake tan if you must, but olive skin tones don't usually suit.<br>  Buy some mascara.<br>  Live with your teeth. <br>  Stare at your nose a lot if it makes you happy.<br>  Once again, you do not need to be skinnier at 103lbs, in fact your BMI is underweight - it's completely unnecessary. <br>  You can't do anything about your cup size, why don't you try eating more? <br>  Yes it will fade.<br>  You can do whatever you want with your ears.<br>  <br>  Personally, I think you're being extremely fickle. |`|84292698e17a6186413c7edc12a662c4aa	honey u cant do all of tht by the time school starts. but here:<br>  high heels<br>  u dont need to b thinner im a model nd i way 20 more lbs. than u but vertical stripes make ppl look thinner.<br>  idk about the hair<br>  straight leg jeans<br>  eyeliner nd mascara <br>  whitening strips, baking soda<br>  padded bra.<br>  it kinda sounds like you have a self confidence issue. u could do all the stuff i wrote nd still not feel good about urself. accept urself the way u r nd ppl will learn to love u 2.

eiUZLJibaa	The worst tattoo I ever saw was a girl who had the male genitalia (shaft, scrotum and all) tattooed on the middle of her chest between her breasts with the head close to her neck.  It was very detailed with pubic hairs coming out of the scrotum and everything!  At the bottom of the tattoo it read "#1 Di@# Sucka!"  Oh, that was so awful!  U can't even cover that up for a job interview or anything important in life.  And no one could ever respect you looking at a big penis at the bottom of your neck!!|`|INmVAjsgaa	The worst one I have seen on the internet was a portrait of a young girl during her prom (or something fancy). <br>  She must have passed away and it was a tattoo to honor her.<br>  Not only did the tattoo look NOTHING like her, but the artist made her teeth look like blocks and shaded in the dark parts. It was awful, and sad because it was supposed to represent her life!<br>  <br>  STFU NOOB would be an awesome tattoo! I would never get it, but it would be cool to see.|`|99a00236e5bf93dac8248227d2334a65aa	I don't think its that awful. I love knuckle tats, I've wanted to get 'STAY GOLD' on mine forever but I want a political career so I cant have any visible tats. I think it is something that will be regretted in the future, though.<br>  And the worst I have ever seen was 'white trash' written on a garbage can on someones neck. I mean, sure, its funny, but yet again, in the future that's going to be regretted. |`|hkKmFEfhaa	iv seen some bad ones,where the artist has made mistakes.<br>  That girl must like hers-personally i think they sound awful.<br>  At the end of the day its what the individual likes,but im not a huge fan of the cartoonie type tats,i know many who regret getting winnie the pooh on there arm!|`|KRUFgUcvaa	I've seen one's with spelling mistakes in them. like this one i saw at a concert had "Jen and Luke - I'll love you forever and eternety" i thought "oh thats sad." how could a tattoo have spelling errors in it, really?<br>  haha, i couldnt live with stfu noob, but maybe jus stfu. she probably plays world of war craft or another online game. thats where that whole thing originated from. haha.<br>  |`|tyNKoQ5Paa	The first gym I joined back in the 80s was a bit of a spit and sawdust place with some interesting ink.<br>  <br>  One guy had been a Para in Korea, or Vietnam - I forget which and had <br>  "F*ck off Gooks" tattooed on his chest, but the one I think about for this question is the guy who had <br>  "Free Nelson Mandella" tattooed on his fist.  Wonder if he still has it? |`|mAcRtRUQaa	mine....haha<br>  <br>  My tattoo is on  the inside of my right foot just below my ankle bone and its a heart outlined in black filled in with red and dripping "blood" from the bottom....it's terrible haha<br>  <br>  AND NO! i would not get STFU NOOB tattooed on my knuckles :)|`|753e067be64c9ece92a2479e27c527d9aa	My brother knows a guy with "Stupid" tattood across his forehead.<br>  <br>  He is the most idiotic person ever.<br>  <br>  I think I win this one love.|`|sZ1sxdMCaa	Some dude had this tattoo of an egg being fried in a pan..

Target.com has a bunch.|`|KDrztUEpaa	The hat is interesting. . . I can't decide if I absolutely love it or absolutely hate it yet. <br>  <br>  I like the style, but the flower is just so big, but so fabulous at the same time lol. <br>  I don't think I like it in red, but I do like it in black!
hpBpLFyeaa	Instead of asking for a number show them how long you would like it or bring a photo.  If you're getting it cut with clippers maybe you could try a scissor cut instead.  Clippers might not go to a high enough number to get the length you want.

105af51f2ae5c537647558c22ceb8defaa	One option is to get a white sheet and some big safety pins.  You'll need to experiment with different folds to find a fold that fits you.  This won't be totally realistic, since a cloth diaper needs to have a waterproof cover over it, and you won't have one.  But if you use big pins, people will figure out what your costume is.  Check out the link below for some folding ideas.<br>  <br>  The other option is to go to any drugstore and buy a pack of real adult diapers.  Get the kind with tapes, not the kind that pull on. |`|BRfnNPN5aa	great costume um.... use paper towels?paper clip|`|ny94EXcGaa	just buy an adult diaper... or you can use a white pillow case you just cut it to size and pin it like a normal cloth diaper. |`|4g0LLCz7aa	u can use a white sheet and cut it in half then put in on and saftey pen the side

That's what they claim anyhow but to be honest it's not that much different from A&F or Hollister.|`|5cbb6a8aaa7b4dfd907174a7fa2a8e9aaa	ive heard of it but never been 2 one. it is actually just like a&f and hollister because its from the same brand so u should already know what kind of clothing they are probably carrying.|`|pP82MKehaa	its not new, people have been shopping there for practically four to five years. you just didn't know about it. it's not really A&F style. it's better and not at all like hollister and abercrombie. you can't get the same thing at all of those stores. they sell different clothing.
2YkEQrmvaa	No, hair growth is hair growth.  Putting something on the cells does not make them push out the protein any faster.|`|AA10774852	No.  There is nothing you can use, either externally or internally, to affect the rate of growth of hair.|`|Kljf6URZaa	No, for starters the prenatal vitamin has to broken down in the body and then absorbed.  Secondly your hair doesn't grow from prenatal vitamins it grows from the hormone changes going on in the pregnant body, and while it appears you grow more hair when pregnant you actually don't you just loose less hair than the normally daily amount everyone loose that isn't pregnant,  that is due to the hormone changes that slows down hair loss, that's why women go through a phase when they feel like they are loosing a lot of hair after they give birth, but it's actually the body balancing out.|`|A0tiM0HBaa	I'm a guy, and when I first grew my hair out a few years ago, I used Mane 'n Tail shampoo and conditioners.  It's really a "horse shampoo" that encourages fast and healthy growth, but is perfectly safe for human use and is sold alongside other hair care products in your local drugstore or grocery.
ePlug3dBaa	Not too much.<br>  Keeping your hair as healthy as possible, getting trims ever now and then, and little heat make it grow faster.<br>  <br>  Hope ive helped.<br>  |`|4jW9rERFaa	Probably not. Hair cuts do. |`|LwS75xPPaa	Vitamins work in your body, not outside.  The hair above your skin, no matter how gorgeous or ugly, is dead.  Shampoos and conditioners coat your hair with chemicals to make your hair react a certain way.  Shampoos and conditioners may not mix well with a supplement if you try to break it up and mix it in and will do you no good in growing your hair faster.  <br>  <br>  Cutting your hair doesn't make it grow faster either.  Cutting removes the dead ends that will split up the entire shaft if you never cut your hair.  If the ends are trimmed and then allowed a breather from perms, relaxers, flat irons, etc. then, your hair will have a better chance of growing past a previous plateau.  <br>  <br>  Also, if you want to be good to your hair, try to get a shampoo and a conditioner that is sulfate free and paraben free.  You have to read the label.  Google the ingredients from your current shampoo and conditioner, you are in for a shock!  <br>  <br>  A lot of them say that they're nourishing, moisturizing, etc., but read the label.  Sulfates are very drying not only to your hair but the skin that the shampoo comes in contact with.  And parabens are known irritants to the skin and eyes.  Some people become very itchy and many people have allergic reactions after a period of using shampoos and conditioners with these chemicals.<br>  <br>  Getting a trim, laying off the heat, perms, harsh colorants, and relaxers will help your hair grow faster.  Also, if your hair is naturally curly, sleep on a satin or silk pillow case.  This will help keep the natural oils on your hair and lessen the chance of breakage.|`|2SCWFVVTaa	i've heard prenatal vitamins work well with the hair thing as well as nails. for some it does actually work and others it doesn't. i'm one of those who notice it does. but everyones different.|`|HcPqvegWaa	No not at all. 
7bf7fbd4987902f29965a776571e4aaaaa	No, there is no miracle oil that will make hair grow. The key is to take care of your hair. Shampoo, condition it, use a heat protectant if you use heat on your hair. Also, getting it trimmed when necessary.|`|hi2nQNXsaa	no,hair just grows some grows faster,but not because it is wild or oily.it grows best when it is shampooed conditioned and trimmed. oh sometime a good vitamin for hair and nails.|`|rhC8cOayaa	umm... no i tried it; a couple of times. Didn't make a difference. What did make a difference was getting vitamins from GNC or a Vitamin store. I noticed my hair and nails were looking healthier, and my nails were growing quicker than ever before. Just take vitamins for hair, skin, nails it's the best.
JJYSmhb4aa	I've tried everything in the book with foundations. From Revlon in CVS to Chanel in the department store.<br>  <br>  The BEST foundation I have found is Lancome Teinte Idole. It goes on perfectly smooth and light. It gives moderate coverage. It's recommended for combination skin. (Mine is oily and I have some acne, so it doesnt cause breakouts). You don't need a whole lot to apply it and a lot of people don't even know that I have foundation on when I wear it. It looks so flawless and doesnt get cakey during the day. I thought Chanel would be the best, (because it's really really expensive) but this product is a lot better. It runs for about $37. You can get it at any department store with Lancome or Sephora.|`|31b861fbf7a9f7e122b6fe1940a57363aa	If you have a sensitive skin, you might want to try a foundation from Clinique.

I am a Mary Kay consultant if you need one.|`|GQI1sizraa	it's like 93 degrees where im at rite now & using liquid foundation just feels horrible.  & breaks me out.<br>  <br>  what i love is Everyday Minerals.  have u ever seen the 'Bare Minerals' infomercials?  miraculous, light, flawless mineral coverage bla bla bla .. well, "Everyday Minerals" is cheaper and supposedly it works better because it doesnt leave a weird sheen on your skin.  And it's tons cheaper.<br>  <br>  u can get free samples here:  <a href="http://www.everydayminerals.com/g?t=kits" rel="nofollow">http://www.everydayminerals.com/g?t=kits</a> <br>  <br>  it looks good even if you're sweating, and it just feels good on.|`|ImBXmT5Maa	The best foundation I've ever used is made by Philosophy and it's called The Present.  I love it because it's clear!  No color!  And it makes my skin look great!  I don't know how they do it but it really improves my skin and makes me look like I'm airbrushed!  Sometimes I use it alone and sometimes I add a bit of blush.  You can get it on their web site.  If you try it, I hope you love it as much as I do.|`|mCIkK7JJaa	Mary Kay has a nice foundation that is light weight with good coverage.

5yISR0iyaa	It depends on the store and the managers policy but they are typically free or free with purchase of $40 of cosmetics. MAC doesn't make samples so you won't get anything for free. Call the store and ask about having a makeup application appointment. You'll get better service and they'll spend more time on you if you make an appointment. If you do a walk in sometimes the beauty advisors are busy so they'll just slap something on you quickly. Always best to have them set aside time to work with you one on one so they can explain what all the product is and what it does.|`|lfE9X6Jnaa	its like 40 bucks and i think you have to buy 40 dollars worth or products too?|`|c808302751a71d561d8e73760f170969aa	they put make up on you for free.<br>   and they give you nothing free.<br>  <br>  and there like 3x as much as your drugstore brand stuff.<br>  <br>  check out there website for pricing

gmAcm2gxaa	Great features. You are extremely lucky to have brown AND hazel eyes. That means you could pull off almost anything! Now, if you have beige skin, like most women, buy a creamy/gold/shimmery/mellow/ yellow eyeshadow. This look works on ANYBODY, or you could play up your hazel eyes and go for a caramel/brown eyeshadow. To make the brown in your eyes stand out: use icy and solid blues and jade greens. Minimal blush, minimal foundation, minimal mascara. Definitely sheer lipgloss. You could also skip the eyeshadow and just use white eyeliner. This looks fabulous on your eyes. Don't use black eyeliner with any of these looks. All of these make-up choices will work with you hair.|`|cb60f4a75a4ce44b6b421b462d74e4edaa	try a mineral foundation...it looks a lot more natural than liquid. Loreal has a good one.<br>  try brown eyeliner instead of black...less harsh and more natural and flaturing (maybelline has one that lasts pretty long)<br>  a rosy blush on the apples of your cheeks for some natural color<br>  and a simple clear gloss, i prefer chapstick<br>  its simple and natural, try some light eyeshadow..still can look natural (light browns, creme, light colors)<br>  <br>  good luck, :)|`|9OVs0UxOaa	ya,,,i would use like peach blush and like paint your nails like a hott pink and your lip gloss shouldnt b to dark|`|QuYwaVUFaa	it depends how fancy u need it to be! if u have hazel eyes green or purple eye shadow will make them show the best. brown (not black) eyeliner and black no glop mascara. use only a little blush (if u squint ur eyes and look in a mirror u shouldnt be able to tell u have any on) and depending how fancy either shiny/shimery gloss or subtle red or brownish lipstick.|`|aapFvNg3aa	check out almay's nude color make-up and bring out the hazel or play up the hazel make-up.. i've got brown eyes and use the one designed for girls with brown eyes and it works wonderfully
fiEzZUp4aa	i live in san diego and a lot of things are in style.. its not really a region thing, its mainly a fashion thing... skinny jeans and peep toe patent leather heels are in, and so are leggings... all types of colors and they can be worn with mini dresses and cute colorful flats... bright colors are really in right now like red and yellow... im not a great fan of yellow, so i'd suggest you wear whatever you like most, denim skirts and short shorts can never be wrong during the summer, if youre completely clueless and dont know where to start, go to stores like forever 21, charlotte russe, papaya, reference and wet seal so you kind of get a clue of whats hot right now.... pick whatever is in stores that suits your style.. you can never go wrong with clothes and accessories from those stores... <br>  good luck and have fun shopping!!|`|cf317f9aa6cf3aa76f007feb51e1d445aa	you don't sound like a snob!!!=]  <br>  okay, so i live in Southern Cali. and now that i think of it, the people here have all different types of fashion(ex.  gothic, lolita, punk, prep, etc).

RO2rE9e1aa	I use totally twisted by herball essence. It smells really good and takes away pretty much all the frizz. They also have a product just for frizzy hair and tames frizz. Another product I use is the hair serum in the Victoria Secrets "So Sexy" line. It smells wonderful and leaves my hair silky and smooth without making it sticky or greasy looking. Just don't use too much! Whenever you get out of the shower don't towel dry your hair too much either. Rubbing the towel against your hair causes your hair to become frizzier as it dries. Another option is misting your hair with a loose hold hair spray once it is dry, just a little so it won't be stiff but will block out humidity which can cause frizz.

Veamos como cuidar esa parte del cuerpo tan importante para la salud como los órganos internos.<br>  <br>   <br>  <br>            Una mirada crítica a nuestra imagen en el espejo y reparemos en nuestra piel: sin vida, con poros obstruidos por granos, grasa acentuada alrededor de la nariz, frente y barbilla, además de acné en distintas partes del rostro. ?Será que hemos descuidado esa parte del cuerpo que tanta atención merece? No se trata solamente de estética, sino de salud. Estos consejos valen tanto para hombres como para mujeres.<br>  <br>   <br>  <br>            Además de la higiene diaria, la piel necesita de una atención especial. Veamos lo que ocurre: si la primera capa de piel (epidermis) no respira, por tener poros obstruidos, las otras dos (dermis e hipodermis) no ayudan a que la sangre circule por todo el rostro, acabando por alterar las funciones de las glándulas y células que existen en esa región. Resultado: una piel precozmente envejecida.<br>  <br>   <br>  <br>            ?Cómo apartar el peligro? El primer paso es, sin duda, el más importante: consultar a un dermatólogo especializado: él evaluará las condiciones en que se encuentra su piel y, si es necesario, recetar o hacer una limpieza.<br>  <br>   <br>  <br>            No se debe limpiar la piel sin la opinión de un especialista. Podemos estropearla, porque el uso inadecuado de productos de limpieza y cosmética, a veces causan alergias y manchas indeseables.<br>  <br>   <br>  <br>            Para aplicarlos, hemos de conocer el tipo de piel que tenemos: grasa, seca o normal. Para saberlo, basta pasar un papel suave por el rostro limpio y verificar si deja manchas de grasa. Si la respuesta fuera positiva, es que poseemos el tipo más común de piel, debido al clima benigno y, a veces caliente, de Espa?a. La piel también puede ser normal o seca. La primera está hidratada, no tiene granos, espinillas o manchas, en cuanto la segunda está resecada y sujeta a arrugas precoces. Mientras la grasa y la seca necesitan de cuidados semanales, tal como aplicaciones de lociones tónicas y esfoliantes, en el caso de la primera e hidratantes en la segunda; la normal no requiere una atención especial, a no ser, claro está, la higiene diaria.<br>  <br>   <br>  <br>            Evitemos clasificar la piel sin la ayuda de un especialista, pues además del diagnóstico, si fuere el caso, podemos recibir un consejo profesional para normalizarla.<br>  <br>   <br>  <br>            La formación genética, que origina poros dilatados y grasas, asociadas a una higienización mal hecha (pensemos en la cantidad de polvo en suspensión y la polución a la que nuestro rostro se enfrenta diariamente) acaba provocando que los poros se obstruyan, que cuando está acompa?ado de un proceso infeccioso, genera en las dichosas espinillas.<br>  <br>   <br>  <br>            Al contrario de lo que generalmente se hace, no se debe sacar los granos y las espinillas exprimiendo la piel con las manos. Los granos profundos y blancos en su interior (solamente se vuelven ****** cuando se oxidan en contacto con el aire), la mayoría de las veces dejan de ser extraídos en su totalidad. Es porque las personas no disponen de lentes auxiliares, como los tienen en los consultorios y, por no verlos en su totalidad, acaban por dejar parte de ellos en el rostro. Un profesional, además de retirar los granos por entero, utiliza instrumentos desinfectados, lo que raramente hacemos en casa. Una asepsia deficiente y restos de granos en los poros, acaban generando acné. <br>  <br>   <br>  <br>            Este es otro problema para los especialistas. El acné puede tener varias causas y solamente un dermatólogo tiene autoridad para diagnosticarlas. El problema surge por causas genéticas, disfunciones hormonales, stress, dieta pobre en fibras y rica en alimentos grasos, medicamentos usados indebidamente, exceso de vitaminas B en el organismo (B6), ingestión periódica de anabolizantes, problemas psicológicos, infecciones internas no tratadas y, algunas veces, tendencia orgánica a producir la bacteria P.Acnes, en número mayor que el considerado normal.<br>  <br>   <br>  <br>            Cuando alguien aprieta una espinilla, además del riesgo de quedar con una cicatriz permanente en el rostro, apenas limita el efecto. Y como la causa, o sea, el factor que hizo aparecer la espinilla continúa, los otros puntos con acné volverán a hacer su aparición. Por este motivo, el tratamiento aplicado contra el acné ha de ser medicamentoso. Existen infecciones que sólo son combatidas de modo eficaz con antibióticos y, por eso, la aplicación de muchas cremas y pomadas no dan resultados.<br>  <br>   <br>  <br>            ?Qué hacer para evitar el acné? No existe un medio 100% seguro, pero evitar alimentos grasos y sustituirlos por una dieta rica en frutas, verduras y cereales integrales puede ayudar a que la piel se normalice. El estre?imiento sin duda perjudica la piel, pues si el intestino no funciona bien, aparecen las espinillas.<br>  <br>   <br>  <br>            Una higienización diaria bien hecha puede ayudar a prevenir el acné. Muchas personas utilizan jabones no adecuados, excesivamente alcalinos y perfumados, al lavar el rostro y, con el tiempo, acaban por deshidratar la piel. Lo ideal sería el uso de jabones neutros y agua, mucho agua. Dos litros de agua ingeridos diariamente, es lo mínimo que requiere el organismo para tener una piel saludable.<br>  <br>   <br>  <br>            Otro consejo es evitar el Sol. El efecto de cicatrización del acné que produce, es bueno, pero ayuda a aumentar la producción de sebo en el rostro y las espinillas tienden a reaparecer en mayor número, lo que es peor. Además, el Sol envejece precozmente la piel-<br>  <br>   <br>  <br>            No dejemos la limpieza de la piel hecha por un buen especialista periodicamente. El propio especialista evaluará de tiempo en tiempo si eso es necesario. Sin la orientación de un buen dermatólogo, personas con la piel seca o normal, que casi no necesitan de ese recurso, pueden estropear su cutis.<br>  <br>   <br>  <br>            Máscaras y lociones deben ser aplicadas bajo dirección profesional, a fin de que realmente beneficien la piel.<br>  <br>   <br>  <br>            Una piel limpia respira mejor y debemos hacer lo posible para que sea una realidad. Una persona con la piel sana tiene un gran crecimiento en su autoestima y se siente mejor en cualquier situación de su vida.<br>  <br>   <br>  <br>            La apariencia cuenta mucho.Y la piel del rostro es la mejor tarjeta de visita que podemos presentar.<br>  <br>   <br>  <br>  CONTROL EN LA ALIMENTACIóN<br>   <br>  <br>            No abusar del azúcar refinado, ni de alimentos picantes y muy condimentados.<br>  <br>            Evitar frituras y carnes grasas, especialmente la de cerdo.<br>  <br>            No comer tocinos, salchichas y salchichón así como chorizos.<br>  <br>            Eliminar de la dieta las carnes enlatadas y patés.<br>  <br>            Igualmente, grasas animales, nata, mantequilla y margarina.<br>  <br>            Frutas oleoginosas como aguacates, nueces, almendras, coco, aceitunas, cacahuetes, etc.<br>  <br>            Sal en exceso.<br>  <br>            Café y té *****.<br>  <br>            Harinas en general.<br>  <br>            Bebidas azucaradas y colas.<br>  <br>            Bebidas alcohólicas.<br>  <br>            Hemos de alimentarnos con alimentos naturales, ricos en fibras (frutas, legumbres y verduras).<br>  <br>            Zumos de frutas y legumbres.<br>  <br>            Beber dos litros de agua diariamente, como mínimo.<br>  <br>            Masticar siempre los alimentos hasta triturarlos por completo.|`|sDCn7PXqaa	ojala supiera, pero vos tenes suerte porque te salio un solo grano, a mi me salen varios! pero me dijeron que es por la edad que tengo, igual los odio!! jeje|`|teaSW7Kuaa	NO TE LO EXPLOTES!!! es malisimo, despues te quedna marcas.

nSGEyiywaa	yes gold would be VERY pretty, as would a bronze...... depending on your eye color a plum colored one would go great with your skin tone!<br>  <br>  if you have darker eyes you could probably still get away with the plum, but usually it looks AMAZING on light eyed girls that have your kind of skin......<br>  <br>  anything that is gold, bronze, or brown with SHIMMER (not glitter, but shimmer) would look absolutely stunning on you!|`|FYrFnpMZaa	try the maybelline new york dream mousse shimmer in bronze beam.|`|scwaket4aa	well you have the perfect tones because you can play with lots of things but stay away from white, instead of white try banana and taupe... also gold tone are great.

Definitely not blonde, your skin is fair so it would look bad.|`|CoxTzgHlaa	You would look best with your hair the color it is because you have very dark eyebrows.

My hair has been natural for 5 years now and i was not going back into a perm.  They Will definitely make your hair straight without a perm. There method is setting your hair with rollers, without setting lotion.  Then after your hair is dry, they will blow dry your roots with the highest heat and with a round tooth brush.  It hurt like hell but they sure made my hair straight|`|QASLKmeIaa	You could always just use the straightener everyday and straighten close to your head.<br>  <br>  My hair is naturally straight/really loose waves so all I do use straightening shampoo and conditioner.

When I blow dry my hair I brush my hair out straight and then use the blow dryer while continuously brushing my hair straight.<br>  <br>  I hope this helped! : )|`|NIIE61rbaa	Press your hair with a straighting comb.|`|pTKFmXMZaa	umm cant u use the straightener??<br>  u can try to use a one inch straightener....

I guess its the small details that count to them :]|`|G51N3XFsaa	My nails are filed to mimic the shape of my nail bed, which is oval. Nails that are filed square with an oval or round nail bed look awkward, and vica versa. What ever shape you choose, natural always looks better than fake nails.

lhs5dVhraa	might be worth getting weaved in extensions instead of clip in.<br>  weaved is where ur own hair is braided and strips of hair sewn in. no chemicals, less likely to damage hair and looks natural.<br>  <br>  problem with clip in is, its more jus for those who wanna add length for a 1 night or so, so they arent made to match ur own hair, where as weaved or other methods of permanent extensions are custom cut to make them look as natural as possible.<br>  <br>  i'd avoid using glue or bonded extensions on ur hair if ur hair is thin tho, it can damage hair beyond repair but also look very fake.<br>  <br>  me personally, altho i am trained in doing bonded extensions, i wear the weaved ones in my own hair and no1 can guess they r extensions|`|bc5e848b650f7c23320e43210b9e4538aa	Instead of using clip ons, Go to a salan and get the fusion strand by strand.

OM8XLlmzaa	I get mine from Claires. Wal*Mart probably has them too.<br>  <br>  Price range is probably between $1.00 - $5.00. Their so cheap. <br>  <br>  You can also make your own by  taking chop-sticks, coating them in a thin layer of glue and wrapping ribbon or dipping them in glitter. Let it try and you have your own, homemade, one of a kind hair sticks.|`|oqiWY1QBaa	they dont have them. you can get them at hot topic, but they are around $6.50. u can always get the throw away chopsticks at a chinese restaurant and paint them.. (i did last time for my costume 1 year and they looked awesome.)check  it out:: <a href="http://i6.photobucket.com/albums/y209/danisamoon/7.jpg" rel="nofollow">http://i6.photobucket.com/albums/y209/da...</a>|`|4uD8fdSPaa	just travel to China and ask for Ming.

Fp7WMrbEaa	it was horrible. me and my friend did it on halloween. we shared it, it wasnt his first time. it leaves a sour feelin in the back of your throat and i coughed alot. never smoking again|`|rpPT4x5Baa	Coughed. It tasted like serious ****. It was hard to inhale because I was coughing so hard and I thought I was going to gag myself.  |`|SU8z0TUoaa	It is different for everyone. I didn't inhale the very first time, but it wasn't long. And when I inhaled, I didn't cough. It was like the most wonderful feeling!<br>  <br>  Learning to smoke is basically teaching your body to not cough. When you first start inhaling, you should take small puffs, and inhale them VERY slowly. During the inhale, when you feel the urge to cough, stop inhaling and hold your breath until the feeling passes, then exhale the smoke. After just a few times doing this, you will be able to inhale without coughing and you will love it.<br>  <br>  At that point, you then start building up your tolerance so that you can smoke whole cigarettes without getting dizzy. Write if you need help.|`|7e076a0be67ad9199649156f6917847caa	I coughed, I choked and I puked...unfortunately, the 2nd one was better and I became a heavy smoker for the better part of 25 years. I suggest you never start!!! Its expensive to buy them and the health problems as a result of smoking will cost you a ton more in medical bills!|`|ruS47Twmaa	i coughed when i inhaled lol... alot.|`|cTk2rswnaa	I coughed, I felt the tobacco sensation throughout my body|`|0SD0K6Staa	hahah exciting<br>  btw can you guy's help me answer my question i really need help i'm soo confused<br>  <a href="http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index;_ylt=AkZvOFrzw2FsqZSrN0KAlUXsy6IX;_ylv=3?qid=20081117171537AAokvLl">http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index;...</a>|`|1G0Db60daa	because this is about beauty...|`|9dUAQXNmaa	Coughed but not loads.<br>  (:
TJxb7bpiaa	No, but replace the mascara after 3 months.<br>  This is because bacteria can grow on the brush, and you don't want any infections in you eye now do you? Also, never share your eye makeup with ANYONE.<br>  <br>  I hope this helps!<br>  <br>  PS: replace your eyeliner after 3 months too.<br>  <br>  PPS: You do not have to clean it, but if you feel the need just soak it in warm water and soap. and rinse it afterwards.|`|8Hg35Prkaa	No you do not have to, but it is recommend to change out your mascara ever 6 months because of bacteria that will grow.  If you change your mascara at least twice a year (if not more) you should be fine.  Sometimes when mine gets kind of clumpy and gross on the brush I just rinse it with hot water but as long as you keep the brush in the mascara you should not have to clean it or worry about it drying out.  But if you want to wash it after each use feel free, it definitively won't hurt!|`|IANlViUqaa	If you have an eye infection (pink eye/etc...) and you use mascara (although you're not supposed to), then definitely clean the brush.<br>  Normally, though, it doesn't matter what's on the brush since it all comes out of the formula.<br>  But if you're using a brush and switch mascaras but keep the old brush, then clean it before your first use.|`|b828ddba40aa6e1da1e0783e330d189baa	No.<br>  No matter what the facetious and finicky people out there say, no, you don't have to clean the brush after EVERY use. Regulary is enough. Lessay, after every 7-10 uses.<br>  Cleaning it after every use will just wear the brush out.<br>  <br>  ^_^ Hope I helped!<br>  <br>  -Rele007|`|YUH0Rnxvaa	no, every week or so. I just wash the brush under water and run my fingers up and down it. Especially if it a expensive one like max factor. If you use a cheap one, then dip it in. It works great as the expensive stuff because its the brush that does the work. Becarefu when you wash it, incase you ruin the brizzles. :D|`|SSLHEPa3aa	you have to be very careful with bacteria it will form on the brush then go to your eye. if this happens you may get sties on your eyes. they are very painful. you never share mascara with anyone. do not use it more than 3 months before getting new one|`|6kiL9hBXaa	No, of course not, you'll end up drying out your mascara this way and wasting it. Now, make sure you don't lend it to anyone for even one use, because that way you can get some kind of infection. |`|wtKcmkQWaa	You don't have to clean it. If you really want to just use warm water and soap. Use your fingers to clean the bristles. It is recommended that you buy new mascara every 3 months.|`|9FlAKRSRaa	No because it's going to be black again anyways. Unless if you dropped it in some dirty place then yes, you'll have to clean it.|`|x06SrRGbaa	no you don't. my mother doesn't. i don't although i don't use mascara. but i don't believe you have to.|`|YTEuq1fYaa	i have never cleaned mine.it works just as well as if u don't.i have seen  pl clean it tho and it ruined some of the bristles.|`|TWZ9X2XRaa	I don't clean mine....And I don't think you need to. It's going to go back<br>  in the same place as it was before.<br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  O___O|`|4ONb3yFkaa	I don't clean it but you are suposed to replace it after three months or if it begans to smell bad.|`|8L7MbIYQaa	i dont clean it... you dont need to... u need to get another mascara brush if someone wants to use it tho.|`|9F8V6Bwtaa	I don't clean mine. I don't see the need to...|`|WzNejqYeaa	you dont have to clean it|`|h0XrmUrMaa	I'm quite sure that you do not have to clean your mascara brush. But it is suggested that you get new mascara every three months or so. <br>  <br>  I found that information in the link below towards the middle of the page.|`|L2hoEusEaa	You should clean it once every two weeks, the reason being because bacteria builds up on the brush best way is to soak it in warm water and eye makeup remover.Nothing else, and yes replace after 3 months.|`|IQKT37Vbaa	No not after every use just every so often to soften and clean up the bristles as the mascara tends to clump them together |`|ELMjqTiYaa	I only wipe any clumps off I don't clean the brush. I just use the one until it runs out or I want a new kind then I throw it away.|`|66058bedd02fc47f0229dc38476d93b8aa	you can ,but i do not it still works good|`|zV6XoU4Kaa	You don't clean it.

amd6CmoLaa	Liquid foundation is best applied with a foundation brush, or at the very least, a makeup sponge.  Also, if you want it to look more natural and soft, you should try getting a skin primer.  Rimmel sells one, it's in a white tube and is called, "Fix & Perfect."  It evens out your skin and keeps a barrier between the oils your skin produces and the foundation, so it doesn't get oily and rub off.  You can get it for less than $5 and it works very well. <br>  <br>  Happy makeuping!|`|4w9gmvumaa	Pressed Powder by MAC--Studio Fix.  And I use a light ocncealer under my eyes.  I get so many compliments.  You dont reallly need to wear a bunch of ofundation on a daily basis.|`|AaYEgDwWaa	This is what I learned about the difference between Powder & foundation. <br>  <br>  Powders: great for people who have Oily or Combanation skin types<br>  <br>  Foundation: more dry to combanation skin types<br>  <br>  Both used together, I have combanation skin if I were to use a Liquid foundation I would just produce more oil on my face. So you then Use the Powder foundation to set the foundation and give it a smooth fresh look. <br>  <br>  Now im useing jsut powders I went from Sephora brand powder foundation to MAC yesterday so far so good it's kept my oily spots under control without me having to add lots and lots of oil absorbing powder. <br>  <br>  <br>  BUT in the winter time Im going to use both together on because it's winter and my skin/all of our skin gets drier so im going to use the liquid foundation from MAC and then alittle bit of my powder|`|LzBJmZIhaa	i like to use both. i usually us a nice moisturizing foundation (maybeline is what i use and it works very well) and i apply it by putting it on a make-up wedge. and painting it on to my face. i make sure to get it as close as possible to my hairline and spread it under the chin and blend well! and i like to finish off with a small amount of powder over the top to take away the shine. i like to apply it on the t-zone and chin area. and depending on the eye make-up i where that day i either use a nice natural blush on my cheeks to play up my lips. or i use a bronzer to play up my eyes, =]<br>  hope i helped! |`|jsDICEoPaa	i always use concealer and powder also.. seems to work better.

I put my foundation on with my fingers but you can use a brush or sponge if you feel like works better. If you're taking care of your skin, you shouldn't need concealer unless you have dark under eye circles, in which case you should only apply it under the eye. If you're using a high quality foundation it shouldn't look cakey or streaky, just remember that a little bit goes a long way!|`|IRL73jJRaa	I use both,<br>  clean makeup liquid foundation from cover girl (it's really great)<br>  and estee lauder lucidity pressed powder (this is also awesome)<br>  the secret to not making it looked "caked " on <br>  it to apply littlet bit of liquid foundation<br>  and also you have to buy the right shade of foundation<br>  or else it won't look natural...same goes for the pressed powder foundaton...if you put too much on it's not going to look natural<br>  so always remember when applying makeup <br>  don't put too much on...a little goes a long way <br>  <br>  *I hope i was able to help* <br>  |`|TxvIoWVGaa	I prefer a powder. A powder will absorb oil from your skin, so it will not clog pores. And, when it absorbs the oil, there is not much oil left on your skin and the makeup will stay on longer. The more oil on your skin, the more likley your makeup will come off. To apply powder foundation, use a big brush and apply to your face. Make sure to get a foundation ONE shade paler than th<br>  e one you think is perfect for you, because if you do not blend it in it will not look like a discoloration.<br>  When it comes to foundation, its always best to apply lightly. Most have oil and pore-clogging ingredients, so the more you put on the worse for your skin. Make sure your foundation has 'oil-free' on the label, or 'non-codemongenic' (which means it wont clog pores) and the best is non-allergenic products are great too, which means you wont have a reaction to it or turn red from irritation.<br>  To apply a liquid foundation, first you should wash your face and apply mostuirizer. The mostuirizer is a great base for foundation, and it wont come off as easily.<br>  Apply a small size dollop onto your finger, and work outward from the cheeks. Add more to your fingers if you need more. NEVER add alot in the begginging; if you add to much, you can't take it off without irritating your skin. Start with a small bit and gradually add more. They make foundation brushes, too, and if you have one do the instructions above but substitue your finger for the brush.<br>  People can notice too much foundation, so only apply as much as you need. No over applying!<br>  Thanks and hope this helps!<br>  Sarah Senemon, dermatologist<br>  SUGGESTED: a tinted mostuiizer is great for those who want a little bit of color without too much. :-) |`|z5RW9NQQaa	I like to use just foundation because when I apply powder on top it ends up cakey and looking flakey - WHICH IS NOT GOOD :)!<br>  So I dont apply powder on top when using it.<br>  When I apply foundation which is ... everday I firstly<br>  Use  a primer because it always helps keep my foundation on during the day and also it stops my foundation from looking dry and dull and adds a glow to my face.I reccomend you buy one of those because they really do help your skin look and feel better.

Make sure you use moisturizer and rub in foundation, dab it on forehead, nose, chin, each cheek and spread it out and go over it with a sponge.|`|FuZ7Upk7aa	i like powder better cuz it doesnt clogg ur pores. and plus... its easier to put on and i doesnt look like ur wearing a mask like foundation does! lol|`|sIwm2FzHaa	Never use. used to a power girl, now au naturelle|`|c506JMjMaa	powder!<br>  i hate using foundation, it makes my skin feel icky and tight!|`|431zhNe6aa	*The best way to put liquid foundation on is with a makeup sponge.  You can buy them in most stores that sell cosmetics.  You can either put the foundation (a little bit) on the sponge and then spread it onto your face or, you can slightly dampen the sponge with water which will make the foundation go on more smoothly for now and it will also be a lighter coating .... especially until you get the nack of it.  One thing that's important to remember is to NOT have your foundation end abruptly at your chin line.  Smoothe it onto your neck, making it lighter and lighter as you go down, so that it blends in with your skin and doesn't have a line of foundation at the bottom of your face.  Personally, I don't care for powder but I do usually put a powdered blusher on after my foundation.  Or, there are also bronzers that you can brush on all over your face after your foundation.  Good luck.  I'm sure you won't have a problem.|`|YWNVXkPZaa	Use small amounts of concealer on problem areas like a zit or red spot. Let it sit for a minute then blend in with your finger, then foundation, use a little at a time the best way to even it out for your face is to get the little foam wedges or they come in circles to help rub in and even, then powder, and blush is a must. You need color in your cheeks! ( one last thing, make sure you blend it down towards your neck,  or under your chin, you don't want a distinct line of your skin and the makeup|`|mG58CuwNaa	Foundation is my favorite because it has the best coverage. You can buy cheap foundation sponges..and if you find your foundation too thick you can always add a dab of water to the sponge.<br>  If your face looks orange when you first use is, its because you have the wrong color. I would suggest going somewhere where they can match the foundation with your skin tone. It will help a lot and they don't charge to do it.<br>  <br>  Hope this helps. and good luck.|`|rqMmS78Iaa	well use AS LITTLE concealer as possible. AS LITTLE<br>  meaning a little little little bit. try buying a stick of it. not <br>  the really liquidy ones. after you apply it, usea  powder foundation.<br>  the problem with the liquid is that once you put it on, if it's not the right shade, it looks really weird because your face and your neck have different skin tones!|`|XRrbXcg7aa	Depends on what kind of coverage you want. Powder usually gives you a sheer to light coverage depending on how much you put on. Foundation, depending on the type [liquid, mousse, stick,etc.], can give light to heavy coverage. It's just all about finding whats best for your skin type.|`|jtO9CRhTaa	well you shouldn't apply alot of foundation. and it has to be a good brand my friend uses the cheap kind and it looks very cakey. i would say try prescriptives its sooooo good. they tell you how much to use to cover your whole face. i only need to use a nickle sized amount. |`|qKf6TY80aa	I personally like powder.

VdLuqgiGaa	No, 5'11" is average/tall side of average for men in most western countries. In the Netherlands the average height for a man is easily over 6 feet, so it would be an exception there, but not in most places. A lot of men throughout the world, in Asia in particular, are around 5'5".|`|KBpjoJruaa	5'11" is probably still considered average, but generally people are larger, so the perception is skewed.  <br>  <br>  The other issue may be your build.

AA10356921	I've had trouble with most colored eyeliners of the pencil variety. <br>  <br>  The only kind of eyeliners that I currently use are the creamier retractabe liners and liquid liners. You can get liquid eyeliner from Avon and mark in a variety of colors and it lasts a while, you just have to be careful to let it dry when you put it on. Avon also makes a product that is a liquid eyeliner that you rub into any color eyeshadow and basically make your own eyeliner from whatever eyeshadow you want. <br>  <br>  |`|tkycjyVsaa	yeah, my hot topic one doesn't work either. |`|47w1gnSIaa	Hairspray....? HAHAHA. <br>  <br>  You have to set your eyeliners if your using it on your top lid or outside you bottom eyelashes. <br>  <br>  If you use black then just dust black eyeshadow over the liner so it holds.

For gentler shampoo with fewer chemicals, you need to buy them at a salon.  Grocery and drug store shampoos use a chemical detergent (usually sodium laureth sulfate) that can dry and damage the hair and scalp over time. Sodium laureth sulfate is a cheap and effective foaming agent, which is why almost all grocery and drug store sold shampoos use it.  Even the ones advertised as "gentle" or "moisturizing" simply add moisturizes to their formula.<br>  <br>  I'd recommend Aveda.  Go do a decent salon (not a chain) and ask them.  They'll be happy to help.  But, be prepared to pay more than you're accustomed to paying for shampoo.<br>  <br>  As a final tip, even once you switch to a better shampoo, try only shampooing your hair every other day (just rinse it on off-days).  The flakes will be gone in no time.

Most girls these days look really young especially your age and younger. Dont try to look older just have good hygene and healthy diet. It will help you look really pretty when you get older. Stay fit too but dont wear make up. you're too young and most make up messes with your skin color and makes you look horrible when you dont wear it so dont start wearing it til you're at least 17. The glasses are ugly sorry but they are and make you look like a spoiled little girl so get rid of them. get some that are more you and look good|`|xf0tAcLjaa	yaaa ur very pretty for your age|`|HzmKMLEqaa	um no and ur a little too young to be on here|`|7DJkwzKDaa	you look really young for your age!! :)<br>  and umm yeah your pretty/average.|`|k8pjXNChaa	live in a house with ALL boys|`|MbFS6XFQaa	Shouldn't you be watching Spongebob or something?|`|mgM1Ot3Oaa	you cant really tell the pictures small and both of them look the same.|`|j51RT5vAaa	yea ur cute for a 13 year old

u0JCNh8zaa	It gets easier with practice.  Make sure your eyeliner isnt the hard wet n wild kind.  The softer it is, the easier it will be to apply.|`|GqEAun7Baa	You put it as close to your lash as possible. Try with a pencil eyeliner first because it is easier to remove if you mess up.|`|eJ4IR5Epaa	Best way to describe how to do that is <br>  - pull the outside corner of you eye area, near the end of the lashes.<br>  - raise your eyebrows up a bit so your lid is nice and tight. <br>  This will need to be close close to your mirror of course. And you need to be really really still. <br>  - start from either corner, swipe lightly to other end. <br>  - and back until it is as dark as you like.<br>  You don't want the line too thick, or it will overpower the natural beauty of your eyes and they will appear small. <br>  - apply mascara to the ends of lashes and curl|`|Qipr2kVeaa	close your eye and kinda stretch it out. also, aim for where the eyelashes are and a little above. that way it looks more natural.|`|Z7dShLRLaa	use a pencil eyeliner its easier :]<br>  <br>  the little tube eyeliners are harder Dx.<br>  <br>  <br>  it shard to explain jsut keep practicing|`|JZMfUDylaa	<a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LJavDGyKAP0" rel="nofollow">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LJavDGyKA...</a>|`|pOfOdldnaa	Its a bit hard to explain really, but there are videos that you can watch on how to apply it on things like youtube.<br>  I can do it very well, i just trace a rough line on the top then i pull the end of my eye and apply more so that it isnt transparent in any areas. <br>  When im done all that i hold my eyelashes down and apply it again so as to get the spaces between your lashes|`|gY3Fe4tYaa	I like my make up lighter, so I just line it above my lashes and use the smudger at the end of the pencil. Make sure that the pencil line is right up to your lash line.<br>  <br>  It will take practice, just get it as close to your eyelashes then you can. Thick lines can look trashy.|`|yCMrOQE9aa	i just put alittle on my top eyelid starting alittle in and working my way back, and then smudge it alittle.<br>  if you add some mascara to the top it also helps blend it in.<br>  but not to much or too defined, it'll look bad.|`|uHzBl17maa	this is soooo simple, just make sure the point of the eyeliner is well sharpened and smooth, put the eyliner between your upper and lower lid and squint so the eyeliner touches the top and bottm, then go from one side to the other|`|0lewWYJdaa	start in the middle, gradually draw the line thicker as you draw it OUTWARDS. make it thinner as you draw it INWARDS. <br>  go to youtube and look up eyeliner makeup tutorial or something XD|`|H9DY3ElFaa	Just do the same thing that you do with your bottom lid. Just go over the eyelashes, or then a thin thin brush and do a line right over the lashes. That usually looks really pretty.
MhpCLLKWaa	yes u can! try to keep the rest of the look simple so it will look classic and no over the top, also consider that since u r just starting u can do better with a lower one for a while, but there is nothing bad in wearing them|`|pHTSL3Ylaa	sure, go for it|`|AGbusTqGaa	I think you could, the other guy is right though 5 inches is kinda high...|`|TRM8tJ7laa	I think you can def wear a heel but I would not wear a 5 inch stiletto....leave that for the strippers.|`|q1KTVTNlaa	5 inches is a bit too big, that's for pro's!  U can wear sstilettoswhen you want tho. but make it subtle. remember less is sometimes more. Just depends on your whole outfit and whatever you feel comfortable in. :)|`|LaczJGJ7aa	OF COURSE   your definetly old enough|`|Pfcl9roBaa	yes im 14 and i wear them haha. (: and y not! go for the 5in!! lol|`|NGmTv3nraa	If you can pull off the look, do it up :)  but i suggest not to wear heals that are too high. You probably aren't use to walking around in heals yet, so you should start off wearing a lower/thicker heal rather than a 5 inch-needle like heal.    More comfortable the better, some heals KILL after a while! and sometimes you have to break the heals in (wear them down) before they are comfortable. You might get blisters :( but thats life :P|`|Q3IPDjtNaa	Sure you can wear whatever you want to!! I wouldn't wear 5 inch ones though cuz you'll probably break your ankle (I know I would lol). Also that would make you way tall like I'd be 6'2" with five inch heels! :)
4299ce4363ec1d5effe1ad495c3d8cc0aa	clean and clear :))  unlike neutrogena this doesnt peel your face ;D    good luck!|`|ug7xWZoXaa	Proactive doesnt work for everyone.  Dont feel bad.    If your acne is stubborn, you may want to try a prescription.  I did when I was about your age (maybe 14?) and stayed on my prescription until I was 20!  It worked really well and I almost always had perfectly clear skin.  What I took was called monocycline, but your doc can figure out what is best for you :-)  In the mean time, I would switch to clean and clear.  They have a 3 step anti acne kit (kind of like proactive) that is supposed to work better and faster than proactive.    Your gonna want to stick with an anti acne face wash even with a prescription.  Worked for me!!|`|qOXOZtK3aa	perricone md at sephora|`|6HFZRDmPaa	Those Clinique ones. I use them and my acne's really clearing up, try it!|`|pKW753Pnaa	Awww you poor thing!  you should really try clearasil ultra. OMG it works the best  i use it all the time and i m constantly acne free. Im not thirteen but i used it then. Heres what you should get:   -acne scrub (its got little blue things in it)   -acne clearing pads (or something like that)  -vanishing cream  just apply those on every night and you will have a clean face :-)  You hafta follow the directions on the back though!  Good luck!! :-)|`|piuofGMQaa	my teenage daughters went to our gp who gave them a prescription called zineylt. As soon as it looks like you are going to get a break out, put this on, it stings a little but in 12 hours it looks 75% better. after 2 days ....All Gone. Ask your parent to take you to your own gp. this prescription comes as a 2 part mixture that you shake in a bottle for 5 weeks only per bottle. Good luck...This does work. I promise. Also try using only hot and cold water for your face only. No other products or gimmics|`|VBYvj7Abaa	my sis had acne problems but she got practice nd it worked but all skin is diff so y dnt u try skin id it sounds like thts just like wat u need|`|PpJF4sctaa	non iodized (iodine irritates skin) sea salt.  apply daily before going to bed.  wash your face normaly then gently smear it all over your face.  leave on for 5-20 minutes then rinse.  i usually just leave it on while i brush and floss my teeth.  you can then moisturize and apply acne products if you want.  i saw results after just the first application and now ive got awesome glowing skin.  give it a try!|`|nLFr9csfaa	Well this is what I use and my face finally cleared up. First I wash my face with a good cleanser like Neutrogena face wash (foaming). Then I use St. Ives Apricot Scrub. This stuff is wonderful. It removes all the dead skin cells that can trap oil and bacteria. After that I use another Neutogena product that has acne medication basically the same as the first one but has the acne fighting medication in it. You could actually use the same product for 1st and 3rd step . Then after you clean face use a moisturizer. I highly reccomend Cetaphil. It's for people like us who have sensative skin. Maybe this will work for you too. Good Luck. Oh yea I almost forgot for a great overnight rememdy on a nasty red blemish...try Calamine Lotion...but it has to be the pink kind. It will dry it out. Plus it works as a great concealer under make-up.|`|F5MQtPEgaa	Okay.. I'm 23 now and I had acne from 11 to about 4 months ago. I was using everything, st ives, clearasil, neutrogena, prescription grade stuff,  expensive cosmetics, proactiv, neutrogena, clean and clear, everything.... i went back into the drug mart and stood in the acne section, and realised i had tried almost everything and that most of these washes/scrubs/rubs/lotions all have the same active ingredients (benzol peroxide or salicilyc acid)  so i decided to try it the normal... gentle... natural way and with the help of the pharmacist picked out the following products that have worked so wonderfully (also my skin doesnt get oily all day, it used to oil up within like 2 hours of washing it... and those dry patches of skin that clog your pores don't exist anymore because im not using harsh cleansers to dry my skin)  WASH- SpectroJel (green) for oily skin  SPOT TREATMENT- dab a cottonball in 1/3 unpasteurised apple cider vinegar 2/3 water (use filtered if you have hard water)  TONER- witch hazel (omg.. i love this stuff...)  MOISTERISER- Vichy Matte moisteriser    maybe you should try this rather than jumping from cleanser to cleanser to scrub to whatever.... maybe you're actually making your skin worse.

IOxB1uU8aa	It sounds to me like you have extremely thin skin under your eyes.  My sister has the same thing..  She uses Dream Matte Mousse and then the Dream Matte Powder over top of it and it usually does the trick.  They're pricey though, so if i were to choose one I would personally try the mousse if i were you.  It's worth a try right?  Or try this..  http://www.dermatologistrx.com/DisplayPr...

xzHr3pRYaa	It long but really descriptive: It all depends on your skin tone and how heavy or light you want to wear your make-up, but here's some stuff I use that's not going to cost you a ton.   -Maybelline Dream Matte Mouse - it last forever and looks natural       -apply with swisspers Cosmetic rounds  -Wet n Wild Mega Glow Bronzer       - apply with large brush  -Wet n Wild Ultimate Expressions eye shadows       - They come in neutral colors like shimmery browns that look great  - Clean & Clear oil-free Morning burst, shine control (use as a base it helps make your foundation hold better)  - Covergirl perfect point plus eye liner       - It goes on really smooth - put on inner bottom eye lid, before your eyelashes start and on top same place. you can do a thin or think line above your top eyelashes but make sure it blends in good, because if you can see skin between your line and your lashes its tacky!  - cover girl lash blast mascara in the orange bottle       - it lifts and separates lashes:)  Hopefully this helps you out.  Wet n Wild works just as good as the expensive stuff and it is so cheap! You can find all this at walmart. Good Luck!|`|FklngtvCaa	good question!  - concealer  - foundation  - moisturizer  - neutural eyeshadow  - chapstick  - brushes / sponges  - blush  - lip gloss|`|c1d312af4250951e942d357ba46d734caa	Eyelash curler.

I use CoverGirl Lash Blast in Waterproof Black. That's the best one I have found so far. Then I'd invest in a face powder or foundation just to smooth out your skin. Use a lip gloss with a sheer tint. This look is simple and not too "over the top".|`|aXXcdIjtaa	Eye liner, mascara, eye shadow, lip gloss, cover up  [:|`|hGGsEaCkaa	Foundation- i prefer Bare Minerals  A natural fiber brush set  Neutral eye-shadow palette  light pink blush- if you want to go really basic there is a lip/cheek stain from smashbox I think that is great  One dark eyeshadow (grey/black) that you can use as eyeliner/smoky eye  Mascara  Eyelash curler    If you spend the money on these, then expand with other cheaper eye shadows or eyeliners, you will be fine. You will spend the most on tehb rush set and foundation- go as natural as possible or you will have acne and skin issues.

fga75inTaa	Pilates that are aimed for the abdomens is the best way to get rid of the little pouch. It doesn't make you lose weight any where else except the targeted area. They concentrate on the abs and the moves in there will definitely get rid of the pouch on your lower abs.<br>  <br>  I would recommend the Gaiam beginning Pilates Mat workout. That one focus' on the abs.<br>  <br>  Make sure you watch what you eat as well. You have to get rid of all the fatty foods so the pouch completely disappears|`|nsx7FfDkaa	you have a weak lower back, work that. A lot of people who focus on their abbs have that problem. It is important to do the back as well when you want to improve your overall appearance. My advice would be to do some back excersizes and a little jogging to reduce the fat, though even that may shift when you work your back:)|`|Ba6SSkzBaa	Sometimes you can't lose the weight (i'm assuming your a woman) because of your bodytype. however, your bmi indicates that eating healthy and doing cardio might help.|`|ZSqOK0KMaa	Just do sit ups, jogging, and walking everyday stay active, engage yourself in sports or dancing it will help to tone down your body fats.|`|pi3UAJgKaa	haha your lucky  you have abs<br>  ill trade with you xD <br>  get p90x hahahhah|`|WOfQZiiJaa	lypo|`|h4IWXPNoaa	are you a kangaroo?|`|hGUYTMGRaa	my EXACT problem. i'm gonna fix it by running more|`|oBhNEA0Paa	If you are looking for a super secret way to losing that belly fat, well you are going to be disappointed. I know you probably dont want to hear this but... the only effective ways are to do ab routines that involve your entire body hanging (Like you would do a pull up), than simply preform leg lifts or hanging ab crunches. 20 minute runs provide amazing results too. Also, if you want true defintion, you MUST NOT cut fat, or carbs from your diet. If your body does not consume enough of these essential energy sources, the easiest place for your body to take energy from is not fat, but muscle (the stuff that you are trying to show!)|`|lcvHfGUYaa	stop doing so much cardio to lose fat <br>  <br>  start gaining weight intentionally by building the muscles in the areas you think still look "flabby"<br>  <br>  the coin term is "skinny fat" and it really doesn't look healthy....<br>  <br>  build the muscles- check out bodyspace.com for articles, tips, motivation and support. <br>  <br>  And remember: Looking healthy and beautiful is not all about numbers on a scale or body fat indexes.|`|QcXSzFnOaa	After I had my daughter, I had the same thing.

Increase your water intake (2litres in a day) and each day have at least 1 (up to 3) warm lemon drinks (hot water and juice of half a small lemon with honey to sweeten if you need) or black tea.<br>  Lemon is astringent and will cleanse away any uneeded fats.

7r4Z2vRPaa	Don't you do 76 over 100?    And it's reduced to 19/25...I don't know if that helps; do a proportion?|`|GNUC0uvaaa	o.76 is numerically greater than 1/6,  19/25 is the converted  value as fraction for .76|`|qEIZ9fT5aa	calculator|`|ynGJ8Iqbaa	Well .75 is like 3/4 soooooo um......yeah, .76 is bigger.     .76 would be 76/100 as a fraction, so it can reduce.   :D Mmmmmhmmm.

It is a new tool that will let you reach into other people's networks to find what you are looking for, you could sumbit a post and someone may know where to find it?    In case you are wondering...how does ReferQuest work?  REQUEST:  Requesters post what they're looking for (for example, qualified candidates) along with a dollar amount they're willing to pay as a reward for the successful referral.  REFER:  Referrers respond to posts by connecting Requesters with the people in their networks.  REWARD:  When the Requester gets a satisfactory referral, they pay the referrer the posted reward via PayPal.  IT'S FREE TO POST. You only pay a reward when you decide you've found the results you want. (ReferQuest receives 20% of the posted reward as a commission and the referrer keeps the rest.)    So people can refer their 'network' for posts and get monetary reward in return.    It's new - try it out and let me know what you think and submit a post for it.  Worst case is you still won't know where to get it:-)
YEd9Q5KZaa	I remember hearing that it could take from two to four months.|`|ug7xWZoXaa	most of the time it take 14 weeks to see full results.  Keep it up|`|8IqgfXl9aa	I'm sorry, but I've NEVER heard that your skin gets worse before it gets better. If you've been using this stuff for a month and half and it's not working, it probably doesn't work. Try Clean & Clear Continuous Control Acne Cleanser and the Gel that comes with it. It's like 8 bucks, try it. I've been using it for about two weeks, and I have clear skin.   This is my rule with skin products: if it doesn't change your skin much in three weeks, the product doesn't work. I agree with you, that was a waste of twenty bucks.|`|AA10626996	Some products take a long time to work but all products have a immediate response at looking like they are working. . If you don't see at least a 40% change then no its not working . It's been what 6 weeks?    Some other tips: Make sure you are eating right. Cut out any and all foods that you know cause your skin to break out.  Wash your face at least twice a day.  DO NOT touch your face. The funk on a hand is enough to send someone obsessing. Really hands are incredibly dirty.   Take a multi vitamin. Really does help.     Also, skin does not necessarily have to get worse in order to get better. I only got worse w/ one product I used but when I found what worked , I didn't break out worse ..  I use Pernox. It is a scrub . Its a bit harsh so if you try it take it easy or you will get serious dry skin. Its a bit pricey 20.00 dollars for a 5oz. but ti will last almost 2 months if you use it right.    Use a good moisturizer. Contrary to belief , a moisturizer is really important on even acne prone skin.   I use Clinique . It's the best and has never broken me out in 20 years.     The Pernox is listed as a lotion . That is because it has a consistency like lotion not that it is a lotion Okay.    Hope I could help

58THMcy5aa	No.To get rid of black circles under your eyes wash your face everyday in the morning with cold icy water. That will reduce the circles and puffiness under your eyes. Or you can put a metal spoon in the freezer and in the morning take that spoon out and put it on your eye for a about 2-3 minutes each. Also try cold cucumber, they work too.  Eat a lot of vegetables and get a plenty of sleep  Some people have these dark circles because they take too much tension or they get depressed easily about things. So don't worry and try to stay Happy. Consult a doctor if you need to.    Honestly these methods do work if you have patience and you do it everyday. Eventually they will go away    Hope it helps!  :)|`|pIbqCoiTaa	nope, it will blend in more tho!|`|d8jH5lU1aa	No they will appear darker|`|SS87lbOCaa	no you need concealer for that
KcvinDvgaa	I think you're gorgeous!  Accept there are height requirements for runway models :P  I think it was 5' 9''/5' 10'' or higher.  But if you're not into that sorta thing, maybe some modeling locally would be nice :)  Who knows you might be the next top model :D|`|b9MbC3Uraa	yeah! You have a nice smile and a pretty face.|`|8q82dLS8aa	Modeling is a hard job. It may sound easy, but if your not completely confident in how you look, it's going to be VERY hard.    That industry does everything it can to make you feel like total crap: people will complain about every single feature of your body at some point, you'll be reject repeatedly, you won't be treated like you should.     Just because people say you should do something, doesn't mean you should. Especially when it comes to modeling. Maybe, they were just giving you a compliment.|`|HeOwMaxaaa	no|`|YFKwT1owaa	I don't think so|`|qPmQvqJXaa	I didn't look at the pic, but I am assuming that your girlfriends are just trying to build your self esteem.  Don't all girlfriends say things to each other like that?|`|oR82hsS6aa	hey you wanna grab something to eat..grab a movie.. or somethign|`|FpcKeNKLaa	you do have a pretty face but don't count on being a runway model. maybe more commercial|`|xgsZ083Yaa	no. you don't look like a model. too short anyways..|`|eWfBYZA8aa	worth a try,you are pretty good looking|`|rjac15O0aa	You could do print ads!|`|POzCKBzvaa	I'm a 43 year old pedophile.

If you ever look at most models, they look weird with a funny now and stuff, don't worry about looking pretty. Looking like a model also counts. I've seen some full on FUGLY!!! models but they still make it through the business.  I don't think you're fugly like alot  of models I'm just saying that some look stunning and some look weird (like a frog :D) .     You actually look like one of the pretty ones!!|`|VSzF36Ywaa	You're way too short.  And your face isn't pleasant.|`|6zXpA0PNaa	Go to newmodels.com    Judging by your face, it's a little too round for modeling. You need to have a face that looks standard pretty...but I think you're almost too pretty and unique looking for modeling. Great Smile and eyes! Standard pretty is kind of boring anyway. I think acting would be great for you. Height and weight isn't too much of a factor, as long as you look attractive. I think you look like you could fit into any role...bad girl to good girl...things like that.    Good Luck|`|SC3jqHZCaa	You asked this twice!! and it's hilarious.|`|3ivRqDQ9aa	nope|`|FakmKM71aa	i don't think so.  u have a cute face, not not model-like. ur too short.|`|pbqsiqt2aa	predator?|`|LrwXlS2daa	There's something really pretty and unique about you.  I think it's worth a try. (:|`|9lXivaJMaa	You just want us all to say your pretty  girls do this all the time  I'm sorry but you couldn't be a model|`|TWfuO1xoaa	your too short to model - maybe some other job in the fasion area would be good for you if ur interested in that kind of thing|`|RFK9sG6zaa	You are a very good looking woman.  Go for the job.|`|ayPAKhngaa	u aren't ugly, but not model pretty. but hey lots of models arn't pretty they just put on a look of make up and do photo shop. anyone can be a model if they are talll scary thin and will stand and stay still for a long time. its not just takin pics, you have to be able to smile with ur eyes and connect with the camera. being a model is torture  but if ur really into it go for it|`|rSe6BAynaa	Dont let them put u down your beautiful and if you want to be a model you should be. it might seem cleshey|`|qXD9Hs5waa	i am a model and you dont have to be pretty to be one because every one is beautiful in their own way and you just have to know what your doing be dedicated and work hard i say you give it a try|`|ALWtUIdiaa	totally! ... you are pretty!  but if you still have doubts, models don't need to be pretty... have you seen some of those runway girls.... uck... but beauty is only a perception of whoever is viewing (beauty is in the eye of the beholder)     What they look for is confidence, and obviously with a bikini pic and a smile like yours on face book, you have plenty of it. (anyone who would consider pretty, but shy and depressed would be an awful model - see what I mean)    You go girl!|`|0lg8v8dgaa	I think you have potential. You should definitely try to work out more, though. As for your height, you might be too short. But it's worth a shot, anything is possible if you set your mind to it.|`|VlP7ESH1aa	In my opinion, all friends say that their friends should be a model. I don't want to insult you, but you yourself definitely aren't pretty enough. DON'T TAKE THAT PERSONALLY. My sister is a model and she was rather ordinary, red hair, freckles, about 5'6 and a healthy weight. She wasn't what you would call "Model Material." Trust me, you don't have o be drop dead gorgeous. they apply SO much makeup, those models really aren't that real.|`|NQI1YnNGaa	your very pretty.  but i dont think modeling is right for you.  but being a model is over rated. they judge you solely on looks.  and i know that theres more too beuatifu girls then looks. your a bit short for the biz too. which is horrible because people come in all shapes sizes and heights. it should be a more open profession. but sadly it isnt. its tough out there. trust me i know ive tried. but i always come up short. literally): im 14 and 5ft. im too short for runway and i couldnt afford the classes for the ads. so here i am, not modeling. i think that if you like modeling you should try acting or designing clothes or something that is less stereotypical. because no one wnats to be hurt. but i say no matter what if its your dream to go for it because your very pretty. but wear knee pads because your bound to fall and get hurt. it happens to the best of us. just remember your beautiful and nothing some stuck up agency can say will change that. good luck! :D  yours truly  -savannah|`|3rYEz5vSaa	ok i dont know how to put this.  your like school pretty..like how guys call girls "hot"  your hot but your not like that pretty model type. likee you dont have the facee for itt. your pretty nd all but not model type. sorry.|`|1eda3d9bfa2960f8a35f1155f4cf0e02aa	there is a reson for model to look like they do, all designers do their clothes (for fashion clothes) in a standar size for a woman tall enough (at least 5'8'' and skinny) so their clothes and their show look very uniform (some brands or designer prefer ceirtain looks like an all american girls or boys for example for abercrombie or a very classic elagant beauty for chanel) this r high fashion models    now there is also other kind of models like magazine models or tv models, for magazine u dont need to be tall but there is even more people looking for those jobs. if u really want to u can try a model agency (a local) u wiould not get many jobs but u can try.     but my opinion is dont waste ur time, u r a pretty girl but not model material, im sorry.|`|N3V4ZZI6aa	Anythings worth a try. Even though your short but maybe you'll still grow a couple in.s   but your eyes.. don't really grab my attention they don't.. connect with the camera. perhaps if you practiced then maybe you could be a model !    but you are pretty (:|`|6e4a568371a58035dd49dc6471ccc26daa	no. sorry but your not pretty at all. trust me you would never make it in that Business.|`|iLiD8MEKaa	You're wearing too much makeup. Modeling agencies want to see what you REALLY look like, not how well you can fix yourself up. Take a picture of yourself with no makeup.     It depends on what TYPE of modeling you want to do. You could try out commercial, print, or cataloge modeling..they usually take all body shapes and sizes. Unfortunatley, you are too short to do runway..you have to be at least 5'8 to do runway.     Being a model isn't just about being "pretty"(that's why we have beauty pageants.), you have to have a personality that your employers like and a look they like as well.     If one agency turns you down, don't get upset or take it personally. Every agency looks for something different, so just move on to another agency!|`|i2no6X14aa	I dont think model when i c u.....sorry!|`|4PK0hiWeaa	You are pretty but not model material|`|EK4NGPJMaa	Honestly, I think your very pretty, but they won't except short people. They like tall people. That is so mean..I'm short!|`|xzJGhhN0aa	You aren't ugly, but you aren't model material. Your height and weight won't cut it either. You're still pretty though! You have a unique appearance.|`|bfc067ab537555ada57edd464a8dfb97aa	You're too short, models are 5'8" and above its the standard.|`|llQwjX5Raa	No i don't think you should. You have a nice face and things. But i don't think your body is good enough.|`|AA11177214	Kate Moss is pretty short too...  It all depends on what kind of modeling you would like to do.  You are pretty, but that isn't all that modeling is. You have to be unique, and be able to sell whatever product you are selling, successfully.|`|24Xy8qWtaa	How old are you? I think you're cute but not so sure about modeling, you just don't come off as a model to me.|`|03e31964ea48bacd64475706a14630b1aa	I think you could try. I think you are pretty enough. But, if it doesn't work, then you can always say you tried.|`|AA11901859	I'm sorry; I don't mean anything rude by this, but there is nothing about you that looks like a model|`|l5zJ1bldaa	lay off the makeup!  and honestly, no.

ALh5R37jaa	I hate those kind of stores. They're for stupid people who want to look like everyone else. They are ridiculously priced, and bad quality. All the stores sell things that look exactly the same, and everyone buys them. People who wear those brands like hollister and abercrombie are conformists, and obviously don't have a mind of their own.|`|HS44HUrgaa	i shop at thoes stores. they have nice clothes theyre just kinda pricey.|`|asSAl651aa	hollister and abercrombie are for people who have to have the brand to be cool.  american eagle is more fashionable and modern in my opinion.|`|JqDkLWeTaa	i like all of them each one have amazing quality and are very stylish|`|NiG85hAPaa	generic and overpriced. A status symbol.|`|s3FWCRGxaa	too expensive, not very fashionable.   i really only like hollister tank tops for summer lounging cause theyre casual. abercrombie is too expensive, and AE is okay. its more for highschool kids i think.|`|EKlBQub6aa	overpriced crap shirts|`|kDoCgzOraa	i don`t even look at those stores as "preppy." i`m FAR from preppy && half of my closet is areo & american eagle. i just love the way their clothes fit && look. it`s not part of a "style" i`m going for. it`s w/e is clean && looks good to be honest, lol!|`|d2SkSAXDaa	i love all of them. the stuff is pricy but i love it when they have a sale! it is so awesome. I got shirts for $5 at aeropostale and a $100 coat for $30 so i love sales|`|hiK0XsSqaa	it is a crock. no1 should have to pay $50 for a shirt. it is retarded. plus what they sell shouldn't be considered clothes if a skirt is the size of a belt. i perfer to shop @ hot topic. at least there i can find clothes that look awesome. otherwise prep stores can shove it.|`|OHP6Hxz2aa	they are going out of style... well for older kids anyway. I've seen 4 year-olds wear abercrombie and I'm not the type of girl that like to look just like a four year old. the clothes were nice in middleschool but now I like forever 21, charlotte russe and of course Guess :). You can put together better outfits and look different from every one else. + four yearoolds don't fir into their clothes.|`|TISztkWLaa	love all those stores.|`|EeBpGOQPaa	Well, it is nice trendy clothes but a bit expensive.  I used to wear nothing but those brands but now its just old. Is having a brand name stamped all over every peice of clothing really in style? I consider myself very knowledgeable in fashion and designers. Out of all of them AE is my favorite, its not as branded and actually has a real style. I do still shop at those stores but not as much as before. I think i just got caught up in all of the hype and thats why i went all crazy over those brands. I reallly like designer clothes though that actually have some substance.|`|5iEIhEmZaa	Bad quality and bad style.  All of those stores sell pretty much the same clothes, and the whole brand name plastered all over their clothes looks so tacky.  I shopped at Abercrombie a lot my freshman and sophomore year in high school, but then (thankfully) I transitioned from that to nicer clothes like from Nordstrom.  I pay more, yeah, but the look and quality is so much better.|`|XGQTFhH5aa	The clothing can be expensive, but when they have sales you can get really really good deals!!!|`|kDnRouWVaa	expensive, and gets so old. all of the clothes are the exact same even when they come out wiht a new line of clothing, i like tobe more fashionable and different therrefor i like forever 21 the best.|`|Lb810XRqaa	Tacky cheap. Not preppy just trashy.|`|ZqBvHABhaa	I believe their clothes are overpriced and look the same.  Anyone who wears them doesn't have a unique style because Hollister, Abercrombie, etc are ALL the same clothes.  Personally, they probably have no style sense.|`|FlZ76mDQaa	i like their clothes.  i don't label them as preppy though that's dumb.  they have cute clothes. half my closet is hollister.  they have good quality clothing. nothing i bought from there has ripped yet.|`|9qGtZ20raa	i like them(esp hollister) but i hate how people think that your retarded or a snob just cuz u shop there. and how they think u only shop there because everyone else does. what about those(like me) who shop there because we simply like the clothes. They give a nice clean look and i like that. not like ghettoo neon splatters all over a shirt like wtf ew.and not evryone thinks their overpriced. and i dont really get how their 'cheap' i mean my clothes dont rip or shrink or anything. alos i dont really label them as preppy more just like casual & comfy  so yeah theres my opinion :]

Here's what I do to make my eyes pop:    Use a plum eyeliner instead of a black one.  The purple will compliment the green.  As a matter of fact, wearing any kind of purple/plum/burgundy eye makeup will make your eyes pop, as purple is known to accentuate green)  Don't forget to curl your lashes, too.    Almay and CoverGirl make mascaras that are specifically colored to accent different colors of eyes (the have a dark plum mascara for green eyes).  I have the Cover Girl EyeBrights mascara made for green eyes and it's the best; the CG mascara even has hints of shimmer to REALLY make your eyes pop!  They are very inexpensive and can be bought at just about any dimestore.  Hope this helps!|`|cx4YMBSAaa	Use brown pencil instead of black.  & Pink or Purple eye shadow makes green eyes pop :)  brown or golden tones look nice too.    you're so lucky btw  i wish i had green eyes.    http://www.howtodothings.com/fashion-and...|`|irAlfTveaa	If i had green eyes i would use brown eyeliner. A little on the top and a little on the bottom. Try different browns for eyeshadow. Browns and dark greens with copper or gold highlights are also an awesome choice!    Dark purples, plums and metallics work too. Coppers and golds will make a really elegant look. I personally really like the way deep purples look with dark green eyes.|`|GcWb7IRdaa	uh, black coloured eyemake-up is the worse thing, on anyone, it makes you look tired, and old- but in a bad way    I say use purple based brown, or a plum purple..|`|CCqqTw6paa	ditch the black  try a light shade of light purple to compliment your green eyes|`|FakmKM71aa	brown eyeliner would DEFINITELY make them pop out, and leave the black mascara.|`|PpfmPV44aa	try going to hot topic and buying some purple eye liner it looks really good with green eyes :D|`|76usxNkvaa	a golden or brownish eye shadow and not too much eyeliner|`|0EkJQEV9aa	def pink eyeshadow and maybe some interestin base color for above your eyes..like a pink white sparkle.. thats wat i do and ppl give me compliments all the time|`|AA10598531	Pink(probably your best bet), gold(will bring out the gold hints in your eyes), purple(will help them pop), or brown(neutral and natural) eyeshadow, and skip the black eyeliner and opt for a dark brown or plum colour instead.  Also you could get that mascara that is meant to enhance your eye colour from Cover Girl. I use it all the time and I always get compliments on how my eyes pop, but they're brown.  Hope that helps!!!=)|`|t2tYfRnaaa	I also have olive green eyes, and I found that certain shades of  eyeshadow really enhance the color of my eyes. Try different shades of purple, from a light lavender to a darker burgundy - you really can't go wrong! Also, try different shades of gold, because it brings out the highlights in our beautiful eyes!! Lastly, what I like is a brown eyeliner pencil because I think the black is too harsh. Then you can create a smoky effect which looks really hot!  Good luck! Hope I helped!!|`|4oWcXL5vaa	Purple is the way to make hazel or green eyes pop!  I have hazel eyes and I got a set.  It has 3 shades of purple shadow, brown liner and an eggplant mascara...looks really nice.|`|s3aVfaZPaa	ANything purpleish!  Purple will definitly do the trick.|`|hGGsEaCkaa	I have green eyes with some brown in them, and the recent trend is to go with eyeshadow that matches your eyes- I wear the tri-green palette from Covergirl. It has the highlight green which is shimmery, then a matte olive green and medium green. They do wonders for a background to make the eyes pop.     Always curl your eyelashes, that helps to open them. I prefer black eyeliner, and only line the top waterline to give appearance of thicker lashes

af644b7256e7bf5a53974bb99a32d482aa	Go to the drugstore and look for a product that you can paint on the skin- it tastes HORRIBLE, so you won't want to bite.    Nobody likes seeing ragged, bloody fingers, so I hope you are successful.|`|EMh3cD7Maa	There is a product available at the Pharmacy, over the counter, that you can apply to fingers that tastes bitter.  It is used for babies that suck their thumbs.

Pyu4fQf4aa	i would do your normal routine, but add some color over your black eyeliner to soften it. Use a champagne-y cream color under your brow bone to the lid, use a taupe-y tan on your lid and a bronze or gold in the crease and under you bottom lid. Browns, blues, purples, golds, bronze and purples will look very nice. I have grayish blue eyes and pale skin too|`|AA12240091	I used to have the same problem.<br>  I got this bright blue eye shadow and use it underneath my eyes like an eyeliner and then put some just below the crease on my eyelids. Then above the line I put a sparkly creamy color|`|RMkNJ8nWaa	man, you are just too young to be worried about such superficial hell ***.|`|RjGGsPInaa	smokey grey do not do natural toned colors since your eyes have grey and blue because green is the opposite of blue kinda and grey is the oppposite of brown kinda
c4U2KvoZaa	Here's a hair routine I would swear by:    1) Make sure you have your hair trimmed at least every 6 weeks so that you don't have split ends.  That keeps your hair healthy so it can grow long.    2) Deep condition your hair every other week.  This repairs damage and keeps hair from being brittle.    3)  Deep clean your hair every other week when you're not deep conditioning that week.  This prevents buildup and again just helps keep your hair healthy.    4) Take vitamin E caplets.  Vitamin E is notorious for healthy hair, skin, and nails.  It's also the vitamin in prenatal vitamins that allows pregnant women to have such great skin and nails.      If you do all this things plus try not to over style, use a lot of hair dye, or perm your hair a lot, your hair should grow pretty long and healthy.  However, keep in mind that some people, especially guys, can have a harder time than others growing long hair.  It's just hereditary I think.  Hope this helps.|`|YwHl37Hgaa	Lavender oil has been shown to increase hair growth so massage the oil once a week and soak for 30 minutes before washing. Try http://solutionsforhairgrowth.blogspot.c... for more details.|`|lhgmgAVHaa	Hey!  Massage your hair well and comb it every day. Try to really mess it up before laying it down again. Don't blow-dry it if not necessary and eat a lot of vegetables and fruits. Try to get enough sleep and do some sports. Like that your hair will grow as fast as possible.  Good luck,  tienne

g3MBOYDPaa	Nexxus Humectress conditioner does the trick. You dont need much and it needs to be washed out well.

ceebbd5b347bf3b3c44701e742d76f97aa	Two things are going on, you need to heal the lip and you need to heal the mind.<br>  <br>  1. Get some serious exercize going. You have extra energy that has turned destructive. Make sure you get 20-30 mins of sweating a day.<br>  <br>  2. Go to the doc, get on a low dose of anti-depressant. Even if you don't feel sad, this OCD is a chemical imballance. The med will help you over the hump until you break the habbit. You don't have to stay on it forever, maybe 3 months?<br>  <br>  3. Go to the natural store and get a balm with 3 things in it, Almond Oil, Beeswax and Vitamin E. The oil moisturizes, the wax provides consistancy and occludes the moisture inwards. The vitamin acts as a natural preseravtive.<br>  <br>  Avoid: Coconut oil, Mineral Oil, Parabens, Colors and Flavors, especially mint, camphor, or spice. All these things can make things worse if you are sensative.<br>  <br>  Break the habbit. Find a substitute activity. Try a bracelet that you can open and close, or a ring you can twist around. <br>  <br>  Apply moisture before the urge to pick starts. Focus on how soothing the moisture is, and how happy you will be when it is healed.<br>  <br>  Give yourself a pat on the back for taking care of yourself.<br>  Good Luck, God Bless!|`|Fh0fOUzDaa	To get the dead skin off, you can brush your lips with a toothbrush. It feels really weird, but it eliminates most of the stuff you could pick at.

I must admit ive never used the cold-sore ones but the blister ones take the pain away and reduce healing time so i would imagine the coldsore ones do the same. it would probably make it more difficult to keep scratching the area.<br>  <br>  You could also try diversion tactic. when you feel the urge to scratch, do something else like brush your hair or your teeth, anything so that you associate something else with the urge to pick at the scab.<br>  <br>  hope this helps and good luck. x
8jFId3dJaa	you did everything right.. <br>  i dont even use goggles. i just keep my eyes closed. i think that those goggles are fine. it doesnt matter if you use the fan or not. personally i never do, its a superstition that you dont get as tan if you use the fan, i know that that makes no sense, but i feel better if i dont use the fan. <br>  i loveeeeeeeeee that lotion that you used. go again tmrw!!!!

It helps to hide a hairy chest, covers up your nipples and wicks moisture away from your outer shirt. They may also be worn as your only shirt at the gym, playing certain sports, or just hanging out in a very casual setting. It is a very versatile item.<br>  <br>  By the way, the correct name is sleeveless undershirt or athletic undershirt (A-shirt). Wife beater is an unfortunate slang term that is used to describe this article of clothing.|`|MlyqlmTgaa	it's just a sleeveless shirt, but the name 'wife-beater' came from the term police used to identify the REAL wife beaters (the person now) who were commonly using this shirt when they were taken in|`|8iR6XOD7aa	you put it under a see-through shirt or just to wear|`|Hjm6AY7Jaa	It's mainly meant for layering.

rOY2J0UAaa	i think you should if it's something you know you definately want then you should go for it. however, do take into account the lengthy healing process and the fact that helix or cartilage piercings are prone to infection etc - if you look after it, though, it will be sweet. also make sure you're old enough!! :D <br>  <br>  i wouldn't say the piercing is really painful, it hurts a wee bit, but well worth it! when i got mine done the needle didn't hurt at all, the best thing is that you can see it and before you know it, it's through! the bit that is slightly painful is when they put the ring through. it's not pain that will make you cry or anything it just doesn't feel say... pleasant. - that takes about 2secs though so don't worry. <br>  it does really depend on your pain threshold though, i had both lobes done twice and didn't think it hurt, but some people do. maybe going in with a friend might help? <br>  <br>  the "pain" you will get the most frequently is that during the healing process. the reason for this is it takes cartilage a while to heal and in the mean time sleeping on it or getting it caught on things does tend to hurt. it is just a quick sort of sting really that goes away, but at some stages it may ache. mine kind of goes in and out of soreness -sometimes i can sleep on it, sometimes not. make sure you don't play with it, keep your hands clean if you touch it and clean it regularly with warm water and sea salt.<br>  <br>  as for not showing your parents... well they will probably see it at some stage, and by then it's kinda too late ;) maybe you could talk to them and just see if they would be alright with it - reason with them. <br>  i have my hair all messy everywhere and no one really sees mine, only if they are sitting behind me or somewhat creepily staring at my ear! unless your parents are on the look out for it, it wont be overly noticeable - especially if you get a bar not a ring (rings are easier to keep clean though). maybe wear hair out or messily over you ear or never talk to your parents with that side of your face showing!! <br>  <br>  good luck with it - as i said before they are well worth it. <br>  btw DON'T get it done with a gun!<br>  <br>  :)
