S0APZr5Aaa	He's crazy looking at him and hearing his music you'd never think he'd do such a thing. Rhianna and him are "supposedly" back together now. It ironic because all his music are about his love for girl and how he'd treat them well and now look what he's done! He said he grew up in a home where his mums partner beat her and said how he couldn't imagine putting another women through that and now look! Sure he could have had a reason to be angry with Rhianna but to continuously punch her like he did is crazy. They said if Rhianna testifies against him he could face 4years and 8months behind bars that's alot of time behind bars but that what you get when you act without thinking. His life might as well be over he cant leave his home he cant make anymore music and now he going to be locked up!<br>  <br>  <a href="http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index;_ylt=Aueqf1WCX14dtFDHMJA_19nsy6IX;_ylv=3?qid=20090307075705AAjP6og">http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index;...</a>|`|MVgm17o3aa	I want him to serve some time..he beat her and wanted to kill her...he needs to pay something for that so we know woman beaters or even men beaters know they can not get away with this, celebrity or not|`|Rw9gGBiWaa	He only has fans left because of his looks.<br>  It's stuuuupidness T.T<br>  He deserves to be in jail.|`|9Zdt7E56aa	Only sissies beat on women? By that I take it you have already assumed that it was premeditated, that he took pleasure in it, that he doesn't regret it, he's an evil person and all of those ridiculous assumptions people make. Maybe he should go to jail, but I can't commend that  kind of shallow attitude.|`|akcGfgdcaa	Yeah but only idiots like Rihanna who have no respect for themselves go back to the 'sissy' and make it seem like his behaviour was justified.|`|sR4HjV9Paa	No, dear. Only cowards hit women. And other women.<br>  <br>  Sissies are cool. That leaves less competition for the chicks.|`|UJD2eYebaa	Absolutely & I hope he really gets charged/litigated for this!  He really does deserve to be punished for what he did!|`|8iWtJR8waa	I honestly don't know what to think. Yeah, he needs some jail time for what he did, but at the same time, Rihanna keeps going back to him like a dumbass, so I don't see why we're wasting our time on this topic. If she wants to keep crawling back to him there should be nothing more to say.|`|ARycuiedaa	i cant beleive what he did. i would have enever guessed it. he needs to go to jail.|`|EiQtzZHPaa	im sorry to have to say this but neither Cris brown or Rhianna should never be in the public eye again they are role models for children and both have let those kids down!|`|x62wDqmRaa	Men want him to be brought to justice too.

CznD93mXaa	That is so sweet.  I love it.  You should totally go on American Idol.  A good song for you would be:  "ordinary day" by vanessa carlton.|`|cDZJgM4jaa	That was okay but I don't think that was really the type of music you should be singing. The Katy Perry one was better. If you want my honest opinion, I don't think you have anything special but you can carry a tune and you don't sound bad. If singing is something you love to do than I think you should go for it. You probably ought to sing softer pop music.|`|9044049de30a44bf02cd045c6e508f31aa	that was great!i can sing too but i wish i had a voice like urs|`|mVU7d850aa	YESS, U SING MORE SONGS!<br>  U ARE REALLY GOOD!!<br>  U ACTUALLY KINDA SOUND LIKE TAYLOR SWIFT =]|`|G03EHYj8aa	Wow, i love your voice.

F60JZOU3aa	At the dawn of Japan's Azuchi-Momoyama period (the late 1500s) two rival clan of Ninja, the Iga Tsubagakure and Kouga Manjidani, are engaged in a bitter blood feud that has spanned for centuries. The fighting finally ends when Hattori Hanzo the 1st succeeds in forging a cease fire between the two clans by conscripting both into the service of Tokugawa Ieyasu (the man who seized power to become Shogun and form Japan's first truly stable form of centralized government). Regardless, hostilities and bad blood remain between Kouga and Iga, ensuring a tenuous co-existence at best.<br>  <br>  Fast forward to the year 1614; Ieyasu has retired from power (although he still wields considerable influence within the government) and passed the torch to his son Hidetada. Unfortunately, a succession dispute has risen concerning which of Ieyasu's grandsons are destined to take up the reins of power when their father finally decides to step down. The various government retainers are beginning to take sides and the Tokugawa Shogunate is on the verge of tearing itself apart.<br>  <br>  In order to solve the problem before it spirals out of control, Ieyasu orders the no hostilities pact between Kouga and Iga canceled and promptly commands each clan to send 10 of their best ninja to enter a ruthless and bloody competition of kill or be killed.<br>  <br>   <br>  The ScrollEach clan will represent one of the two factions supporting Ieyasu's grandsons; the names of their selected fighters recorded on two identical scrolls to be marked out in blood upon their death. The clan that slays the chosen ten of the other will be given favor for a thousand years while the grandson they represent will be pronounced the undisputed heir to the Shogunate.<br>  <br>  But not all parties involved are willing to seek blood in the name of ancient grudges. Prior to the conflicts renewal, Kouga and Iga's two young heirs (Gennosuke and Oboro respectively) were betrothed to each other in the hopes that their union would finally dispel their clan's long-seated animosity toward each other. Forced headlong onto separate sides of a conflict they want no part of, Gennosuke and Oboro must now choose whether to kill the person they love or lead their entire clan to annihilation. Against centuries old hatred and the horrors of war, is love even capable of surviving?|`|P6xuhlgTaa	Synopsis is already given so i ll just tell differences<br>  Shigurui is lot more adult like and bloody.its more the real thing and less romantic fantasy for battles, technics, the love and hate parts. Also better animation and music. <br>  The 2 are about love stories and also hate between 2 ninja clans or 2 samurais<br>  <br>  Shigurui is a real story of 2 japan samurais coming from a historical book success where basilisk talks about a legend that didn't happen the way its told of 2 real ninjas clans

d02c709e184c7a1f7828d9e3e00c32b4aa	Perhaps we can contact the Sci Fi channel to film a special edition of Ghost Hunters, where they track down the spirit of the "great" Kurt.  Then we can hear it directly from the source; "Yeah, I was a depressed drug addict who actually DID have a gun, so effing what?  You'd off yourself too if you had to be married to that witch Courtney."  Should be a ratings bonanza and would put an end to these pathetic Oliver Stone-like theories.<br>  <br>  MA - That's difficult to answer with any degree of certainty.  Judging by Kurt's unhappiness and band turmoil, I'm not so sure they would've been able to come out with more than just another album after In Utero.  I think as a band they were very close to the end of the line.  Kurt was never exactly very comfortable being in the spotlight.  But let's say for the sake of argument that Kurt didn't blow his brains out and Nirvana were still together right now.  My best guess is they'd be about as relevant as Pearl Jam is at the moment.|`|dc49d60c4d19a92e193ce2f41c92cfedaa	Maybe just haunt the people who think he was murdered<br>  <br>  I think Nirvana would have broke up even if Kurt was still alive he just didn't seem to want to do it anymore and Foo fighters would have still formed and blah blah blah.|`|MwiBGBK1aa	I agree. It was suicide. Period.<br>  <br>  You wanna know an interesting fact about me? <br>  <br>  Come on.. I know you do!<br>  <br>  I own every single Nirvana album, even the Rarities and B-Sides... but I don't own Nevermind. I have it on cassette somewhere. Can't find it.|`|7fEVNng5aa	nah, I find the conspiracy theories mildly amusing. Besides, if he were still around the Foo Fighters might not have happened, and I much prefer them to Nirvana. <br>  <br>  MQ-I imagined they'd have continued to level off, but still releasing albums to critical, if not commercial, acclaim.|`|33f4c852804fa42db9a7cbb912480080aa	Dude, it wasn't a theory that he was randomly killed...<br>  <br>  There was a theory out there that Courtney Love killed him in a domestic dispute...i.e. cause he beat her up...You know, Chris Brown-Rhianna I type thing...However, I think it was suicide myself...<br>  <br>  What is very rarely said in the media, but true, is that Kurt had a MAJOR problem with migraine headaches...Whether that was due to heavy drugs or whatever is up for speculation...<br>  <br>  But, if the migraines were that severe, you could get irrational...Point is that's another possible reason he killed himself...|`|OTFzJbaMaa	hello peaches. i am going to edit my answer as i am not focused right now and thid question deserves full attention. ill be back<br>  <br>  k im here ha<br>  ive said it before and ill say it again, kurt cobain killed himself. if you watch documentaries on nirvana you can see that leading up to his death he got more and more depressed. yes he had a daughter that made him happy but im pretty damn sure that she was the only thing keeping him together for a while. he became increasingly more depressed as the documentary went on and you can see it in his eyes. he was a gifted man but hated the sucsess he had, and in many ways never even wanted. if he were alive nirvana would have self destructed. like i said kurt did not like being famous., and for that matter he didnt want to be veiwed as a idol of any kind by his fans. he just wanted to be a normal person and because of that mentality nirvana would have imploded no more then a year or so after the day kurt woulda ]( and did ) kill himself.|`|rFBypeEfaa	Yeah... what the hell would a band have been supposed to do *two* albums after they've been credited with the monumental achievement of changing the entire nationwide radio format?<br>  <br>  In Utero was just one album afterward and you're right, they were already sliding down to "just another band" status. People who weren't around wouldn't recall, but right around then there were just as many people, if not more, who were making fun of Nirvana as there were people still celebrating them.<br>  <a href="http://www.amiright.com/album-covers/images/album-Weird-Al-Yankovic-Off-the-Deep-End.jpg" rel="nofollow">http://www.amiright.com/album-covers/ima...</a><br>  <br>  I assume that their music would have plateaued off, as you said. There's only so many ways to mix around Sonic Youth, the Melvins, and the Pixies, after all. My hope for them though, had they stayed around, is that they would have used their fame to leverage some greater exposure for some of their influences, such as the 3 aforementioned groups, or all of the 80s metal underground artists that Grohl celebrated on the Probot album a while back.|`|7bafd319faa1b5da147c395306caa37daa	Kurt had a few family members who also committed suicide, he was pre-dispositioned for that end. He was very addicted to heroin which also causes extreme mood swings and depression. If he was alive, Nirvana would most likely have faded in popularity much as Amy Winehouse has. Drug addiction makes musical creativity fade as it worsens the creator's mind over time.|`|k4GqiB6taa	I wasn't around when Kurt Cobain was alive,if I was then I was probably just a teensy little baby,but had Cobain never commited suicide then I think the band would be just were Pearl Jam is right now.  <br>  I'm sure they would probably continue to make albums but none of them would be as good as Nevermind.<br>  Just like Pearl Jam,everyone thinks that Ten is there best album.<br>  Personanly I disagree.|`|yS61H04haa	Even better, I wish he would come back AS IF ( all stinky and rotting) to scare them into shutting the hell up. <br>  <br>  <br>  MQ: Nirvana was almost done. I don't think they ever had the staying power that AIC had. I think that they would ahve moved on and probably Kurt would have drifted into a heavily medicated state of obscurity.|`|C7YbYUYPaa	Yea, I am mighty sick of hearing murder theories.  I don't know why people can't just accept the basic facts.  Denial is one thing, but they are just going too far with some of this stuff.<br>  <br>  MA: I think they were well on the way to the bottom.  His suicide was really the only thing that kept Nirvana relevant, and I don't think they had anything left going for them.|`|s9Pwnb87aa	I find suicide cowardly....<br>  <br>  No one has the right to judge Kurt, but I could see and hear the loss of hope in his music.<br>  <br>  Would you believe me when I told you.....Your the queen of my heart.<br>  Love Buzz......<br>  <br>  He had a great mind and I miss the fnck out of Kurt.|`|f948d748facdf196074d849ea9c465c4aa	Yes, Kurt would also diss all those stupid commerical post grunge bands.<br>  <br>  But honestly Kurt would have tryed to kill his own career, he hates being famous. Krist Novoselic went into all these underground bands and Kurt probably would have done something smilier.|`|DzIlM76Xaa	I'd just like him to smack the crack outta Courtney.|`|lEQ4PhpLaa	I am in my late 20's and I lived through all that. I was one of the fans who bought the albums as they came out. Yes I am sick of hearing murder conspiracy theories about him, but I disagree that they had reached their peak. Kurt was a visionary, not just a great musician.He made a voice of a generation. I miss him so much but I'd REALLY like to hear his take on all this "EMO" crap, I mean what is that? I'm saying no, it's a dangerous trend and yes I understand how hard it is, that's no excuse.I worry that youth are finding it "fashionable" to hurt themselves which is a load of CRAP! And yes Kurt would not like "EMO"! I am Bipolar myself. I hate being this way and everyday I work towards trying to get better. Kurt was not about being "trendy/Fashionable" and he certainly wouldn't like to see that type of stuff going on. I really hope that the younger people as hard as it is , can find better stuff then that. I KNOW they are very smart capable people, they have much hope but we have such a messed up world. I just hope people don't delude themselves with the "EMO" thing, it's not even safe.|`|QzezKBmnaa	Oh hun, they still wouldn't get a life. If it ain't Kurt it's Kennedy or TuPac.<br>  <br>  And yes, I think sales would have leveled out.|`|thTNfqbbaa	I disagree entirely because I think Nirvana had something left in them yeah Kurt couldn't make it through his depressed life due to earlier experiences but wouldn't you  imagine since the Drummer for Nirvana is Dave Grohl the Lead Singer-Guitarist for the Foo Fighters would have eventually pitched new Ideas for the Band like Instead of The Pretender and Everlong being Foo Fighter Songs they might eventually would have been Nirvana Songs Instead. Ya See that's the only problem about Nirvana everyone always thinks about Kurt and Not about the other two members. Enough Said

I worked in the cafeteria to help pay my tuition. My parents were not rich, but they wanted me and my sisters to have a good education.|`|m7fbc0Fyaa	Nope. You can find 'rich, stuck up, snobs' in public schools too.<br>  Depends on the person.|`|UNFlbMzpaa	No|`|sxk08R2caa	i go to a private school!<br>  <br>  you sound like a stereotypical person! just because our parents have sent us to this school doesn't make us snobby! after all, we are kids like everyone else!<br>  and FYI, most of the kids at my school aren't snobby either! it honestly depends on the person tbh!|`|K4bJgTF4aa	not in the least bit. i know more ppl that are "rich, stuck-up snobs" that go to public schools.|`|827282d53bd3bb00c860804c45daba9baa	I go to a private school, and i'm definitely none of those things.

AA10558731	Then why take her? Watchmen is not a film for a three year-old child, it's a film for teens & adults. Little kids make a lot of distracting noises when forced to sit through movies they don't want to watch, which will piss off everyone in the theatre, causing them to stare at you, make disparaging comments, and throw their popcorn at you. Do everyone, including her, a favor and leave her with a babysitter or wait until it comes out on DVD. Make sure the babysitter has plenty of Barney or Sesame Street videos for her to watch, that's more her speed.|`|NbjJiSJJaa	Um...she'd probably be more scared than confused about whats going on....<br>  <br>  And if you're her dad, that's being pretty selfish of you. Stay home with her! AT LEAST get her a baby-sitter!|`|5nfqY9T7aa	You're just going to bother the other people in the theater if you can't keep her quiet! I HATE THAT!|`|3890f326e072192e79ea3f718551dfb8aa	Find a babysitter. Let your child be a child without polluting her mind with those kind of images. I'm sure she'll perfectly understand one person breaking another person's arm and all the other carnage. What she won't understand is that it's all fake. Plus, it will only create a distraction for all the adults in the auditorium when she starts crying because she's scared or upset by what she sees.|`|b7ff0c6859d6ba5cc891050de578e39daa	Sure she will.  My 3 year old nephew asks about the consequences of violence he occasionally sees on the TV.  He talks about the consequences of natural disasters all the time.  He learned all about natural disasters from the Rescue Heroes and I have no doubt that he understands what is going on.|`|Klb4ZYcVaa	wha..? 3 year olds? you must be kidding. I remember seeing the most stupidest parents in the world, taking a 2 year old to The Grudge movie. Kid was yelling, screaming & crying, & the parents just sat there eating their popcorn. Christ.|`|6d23176153348f28063046fb89cccc33aa	Definitely a bad idea. The movie is very, very long (I was getting twitchy about two hours in). Even if you think your 3-year-old is strong enough to handle the explosions, the blood, the dead bodies, the gore, the gratuitous sex, and the large swinging penis (my boyfriend had a lot of trouble with that last one), I doubt she can sit still for three hours. The rest of the adult audience at the theater I went to was shifting uncomfortably before the end.|`|Bh1eq1pNaa	I've been watching movies like Predator, Terminator, Killer Klowns from Outer Space, A Nightmare on Elm Street, Halloween, & Godzilla since I was 4 years old and I'm not a psycho killer or anything.|`|VF14bk8iaa	Nooooo don't take her. She will annoy the crap out of everyone else AND she will probably understand more of the violence than you think.|`|qXvFsnOcaa	You're insane. It's loud, there are lots of flashing lights, and people scream a lot. She'd be terrified. Why not just set firecrackers off in her stroller?|`|04f66f1c66b0524d97b2f5defbc9979daa	Unless she is demanding to see it which I doubt, leave her at the Babysitters  or take her to see a kiddy flick.|`|iPLKizKuaa	Umm no|`|BsDv3k5iaa	She will understand a lot more than you think!  Don't take her!|`|1dNBZFPbaa	Yeah, why would you bring her? Just leave her home. Poor kid.|`|yAImuQIsaa	The violence is extremely graphic, as are the sex scenes.  Nothing is left to the imagination.  I wouldn't recommend it.|`|VDjaypqpaa	I don't think any 3 year old should be watching anything violent.

G9FiXGvmaa	I only have one regret.  That I didn't push my boss (the jaggy one) down the stairs when I had the chance.  I actually didn't think of it at the time.  Hindsight SUX!|`|7u8hX3Hkaa	No , <br>  <br>  There is always some act , or lack of acting that I would have <br>  changed if given the opportunity.  Instant replay in ones mind<br>  never changes anything , it just offers us the opportunity to evaluate <br>  things and the chance to redeem ourselves .|`|3TLuSf9Yaa	I have had a life time of no regrets, only lessons well learned.

KubD1fBLaa	wow six tails, naruto is losing himself...hope yamato can stop him...(^_^)..|`|P6xuhlgTaa	Hinata seems out of danger<br>  <br>  Cliffhangers are part of a good manga.<br>  Suspense make you buy the magazine and help you writings your wishes and thoughts on fanforums^^<br>  <br>  Nagato peace vision is harsh but not so out of reality and lot more realistic than Naruto vision when nations are involved. Having the better solution from a human point of view and realtionships don't bring peace if you are alone thinking this way<br>   Atomic bomb helped a lot for Us/Urss never get in a direct war. Sixties were happys days for citizens when you think about it. Fear is great for long peace intervals and help militarys officers not being too greedy<br>  <br>  I don't think the recovery solution will come from yamato with the first hokage crystal destroyed...Kyuubi being beaten cold by pein can be a safer way for naruto coming back too and there is always a sage clone in the frog mountain as a last solution^^|`|tSU1BmGtaa	I did! Is Yamato gonna stop Naruto at the end? I don't think Hinata will die. I hope not.|`|ckeBvt23aa	I read it, and I like it.|`|wdJS5MuUaa	I read it!i know it`s not fare that they leave us hanging waiting for the next new chapter!and i will admite this but i really wish that hinata would die.I DON`T LIKE HER!|`|OyoJL5YAaa	I read it.|`|fv2GAAdPaa	ok<br>  <br>  =]|`|f4ed8d9c313d778ec37048e45a66bd35aa	i just did damn i hate pein i hope naruto ends him in the next one ><  that guy sucks
yQ1UfuZWaa	take her on as helicopter and u could go sky dive. take a backpack with a picnic in it. tell the piolet to come back for u guys like 4 hrs l8r. have a nice little picnic in a hilly meadowy olace w/lots of flowers. <br>  <br>  then get down on your knees and ask her to marry u!!! JK! (but u gotta admitt that last part would be a nice touch)
spYpsixUaa	Sometimes I do and sometimes I like to keep it entirely in my head until I am done thinking it.  There is something magically changed when you are explaining something to another person.  In some cases, I want the idea that I am thinking to be entirely my own, and so I follow it through and rethink it entirely in private, so that I am only explaining it to myself.  I find that talking about an idea to another person forces me to explain things that may not make sense to THAT person, and that such an explanation would become different if I was talking to another different person.  Knowing that helps me to choose who I would tell such things to.|`|6mBpkt3Daa	No, because it feels awkward and silly, you know?|`|3TLuSf9Yaa	Your strawberry is making me hungry. That's what I do on Y/A especially. Here they have no reason to lie to you where a friend might.|`|63BzEtMVaa	No i don't.. I keep many things to myself. There were so many times in my life that I've trusted people on important things and got betrayed or they just judged me behind my back.. My life is much better now that I don't trust such people anymore.|`|AA11705909	Yes I do. I like my chats with my pal Jim, he was in charge of R&D at an international electronics company and knows a lot. I do like debating things with him, it is cerebrally stimulating|`|VQPgNedQaa	me and j lar had a nice talk about girls and monkeys|`|bc672f6eb9191dfc00d1b8146c3ccbbfaa	when deep in thought then its more of a persnoal nature..so to discusse it with other ppl you would have to be close to them and trust in them also.<br>   aslo depends on the thoughtss i mean if its kind of a sexual thought then dont, keep it to urself cos then its more of ur fantasy.<br>   if its like ur being a hero in saving some one ..then to be honest we all think about  stuff like that ( remember the peoguot advert on tv a few yrs back when tht gus runs out in the road and saves tht child). <br>   having that perfect job well yeah tell all...lol<br>   i think the reason it differs is what you said,, its "deeper thoughs" and there the personal ones. we all have them so don't worry...lol<br>  <br>  <br>  good luck.|`|k5juzSBMaa	it depends! usually, whenever i share an idea, someone immediately publishes it and makes money!!!

Although sharks seem to be very angry and tough creatures, they do have weaknesses. If that were me, i would punch or kick the shark(s) in the gills. Which is like kicking a human in the throat.

9794VMZ9aa	No. <br>  <br>  There are various documentaries on it, but no new film. You can't really build on the film already out, can you?|`|5nfqY9T7aa	NO|`|L0gaodtTaa	Nope. and if there was, it would be definitely be a horrible movie|`|IaK4SRHpaa	NO!!  I hope not.  But then they make sequals out of just about anything nowadays.|`|WSIZKAQcaa	I hope not. There is no possibility for a sequel.|`|Klb4ZYcVaa	WHAAA?!?! haha.|`|ZllkWRIOaa	there are a few out|`|fnXN6cKSaa	It would have to be a prequel!  There was only ever one Titanic, which sank, and the starsof the movie both died!  So I wouldn't hold my breath if I were you. They could make another movie though, and call it 'Underwater Lesbian Vampires In The Ghost Of The Titanic'  That would be some great movie!|`|3890f326e072192e79ea3f718551dfb8aa	As a matter of fact, there is a film called Titanic II,but it's not what you might think.  It has nothing to do with the fake trailer available on YouTube. It's a 30 minute short film and it has only played at a couple of film festivals - the last one in 2005. <br>  <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0472570/" rel="nofollow">http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0472570/</a>|`|E4W6KxCMaa	Not on film, but in reality.

Most folks do not know the Titanic was filled with yo-yo's in it's cargo hold.  It sank , came up and sank again 57 times.<br>  So there will be a Titanic 3,4,5 and and so on.|`|AA11995384	Nice one!  Well just how many times can it sink?|`|E1qOtwZ3aa	no.<br>  and there wont be.|`|sLgI3cRpaa	no{pe}|`|vbq0tFRCaa	nope|`|ClETpYZQaa	No - they had considered a prequel but neither the director nor cast were interested ... plus it would have had nothing to do with the Titanic obviously.<br>  <br>  Leslie Nielsen tried to get "Titanic Too: The Missed The Iceberg" into production, but by the time they had a script approved it was way too late to be relevant. Or funny.|`|fDo7CG6vaa	There is a short film released in 2002 by that title, directed by James David Walley.<br>  <br>  Here is a link to the IMDB website where you can read the plot summary, who are the main actors, etc:|`|26414b2f3237391dde0fd3b0221fcffcaa	If you're serious, then I think you've misunderstood something. The Titanic sank. If you're thinking about another re-make, then I haven't heard anything.|`|OjoRulRUaa	No. But there's a few different Titanic movies out there! ! !|`|rP3HZ0zOaa	No. Why would there be?<br>  <br>   There was only one event that involved the Titanic.<br>   It sunk. People died.<br>  <br>  <br>   End.|`|6YADkFr7aa	Yes their are 2 Verizon's one from the 1950s and the other from 2000 era|`|2SScKK2Gaa	Nope <br>  well atleast not with the original characters...but im pretty sure theres not.|`|vKHHiymOaa	I never knew there was a titanic two.

u8ia6oKxaa	I've starred this and will listen later.  I've heard Dragons Kiss and like it, but not Scenes....and I'm at a Library with no headphones.<br>  <br>  Ok, so I listened to all links.  As I thought i would I liked Dragon's kiss better.  I just like him doing that style more...it suits him imo.  I still liked his playing in Scenes...good riffs and good solo as expected.<br>  <br>  BA:  Hmm, I like Megadeth the best, but I think overall he was at his best with Cacophony.  The RIP album he was pretty good as well
yOLeRiTZaa	.<br>  <br>  ~_~.<br>  <br>  FreeRunn--<br>  <br>  Well.....I searched around looking for the definition, to "gay before bed". I found TONS of references to the saying, AND many others asking what does it mean. To which, the only  reply is...Watch UF.????<br>  <br>  So...I am going to take a stab @ it. I have 2 guesses. Oh! And I noticed ...It's exact term is "PLAY Gay Before Bed". I think the word "play" is important.<br>  <br>  Ummm, the 1st guess is the obvious one. They are going to mess around "in bed", with some gay lovin'.<br>  <br>  My 2nd guess, is playing an old game we all did, when we where young.... "WHAT Would You Do IF..."<br>   BUT, with a TWIST!!<br>  <br>  They have turned it into, "WHO... Would You Do, IF You Were GAY?" <br>  (Eliza Dushku, would be my answer by-the-by, But I'm not Gay or Bi)<br>  <br>  OR Maybe I have a 3rd guess, and that would be both, and they do the role playing thing or something?? <br>  <br>  I suppose the thing that Bothers me most about this, 4 Word Statement, is that NO Body out there Wants to give an Answer to Any Body. I think that tells me, that they TOO, DO NOT Know the Correct Answer----- OR-----They are Ashamed that they DO Know the Answer. Ya Know?<br>  <br>  Hope you are Satisfied with MY Answer, Which, YES, I Know is a Total Guess. BUT I DID Really Try.<br>  <br>  Take Care, FreeRunn!!!!<br>  <br>  ____________ ~_~.<br>  <br>  .

3890f326e072192e79ea3f718551dfb8aa	I think the R rating was fully appropriate. The people who complain it should have been NC-17 were probably just upset because they took a young child to see it thinking it was just another superhero movie. <br>  <br>  Less (or more) inappropriate is a relative term and depends on your expectations. As a parent, it's not anything I would take my 12 year-old son to see, but as an adult I didn't think it was any more or less appropriate than most other R rated movies.|`|Klb4ZYcVaa	Well, if you aren't the boy teen who talks about how disgusting was the blue penis, you truly watched the film with no stuck in scenes inside your head. You have no idea, even 16 year olds, older than you, complained about Dr. Manhattan's penis. Christ, it's just a penis. & he was blue! So what?<br>  <br>  I came out of the theaters so disappointed. The story, plot, just the whole thing was ridiculous. I didn't mind the nude scenes, it's natural. But i just loved the graphic novels so much, i was really excited seeing the movie. Just stupid. My boyfriend Kevin had it BAD, haha.|`|dOeE9GCcaa	You could just have a tolerance to movies like that. I am a 24 year old and I had my eyes closed most of the time through that movie.. lol.. at least you got to see most of it. Plus you are 13, I think you are old enough to not have nightmares because of scary movies anymore. You understand that they are not real|`|b74222ab84625a98e519e55038843a30aa	The film earned its R rating.  Whether you had nightmares is not what is important.  Watching things like this may numb you to real life tragedies over time.  Particularly, if you are watching these things at a young age.  I think you are not mature enough to realize that fact.|`|FD14nOKoaa	We saw it last night, with two 12 year olds, it was definitely inappropriate.  The gore was bad but the porno was worse.  You may be mature for your age, but kids don't need to see this movie!|`|E4W6KxCMaa	You've just been desensitized by all the junk on TV and happening in the world.<br>  It's good that you're mature and know what's going on.

sc4BtGxGaa	I am a profesional flutist and teacher since 1971, and would advise you AGAINST getting a Bo-Pep - the are rock-hard, tend to slide, and will scratch your flute.  You can go into and drug store and go into the aisle where they seel things for bad FEET - and get some moleskin, sticky-backed foam, or some kinds of corn plasters or anti-rub pads,  Stick one of these where you support the flute, adn see if it helps.  You should always have both hands in balnace ergonomically, so stick on where yo support the flute with your RH, too.<br>  <br>  You can look for a THUMBPORT - it will make your RH more stable, and take stress of your left.  See Fluteworld for these.<br>  <br>  As an expert in Repetion Stress Injuries and Cumulative Trauma d Disorders, I have made many orthotic devices fro flutists who are suffering. However, I would have to SEE you to advise anything.  If this is ongoing and sever, you need to see a LOCAL teacher who can assess your biomechanics and advise about what can help you.  Having any radiating pain into the palm is not good.  This sounds random, but is important - do you lower teeth hurt, or feel pressure, or looseness?  That is clearly a pressure problem, but again, must be SEEM by a teacher who is particularly aware of thses problems, and has studied how to fix them.<br>  <br>  I wish you luck - but do not let this continue without help, or you risk genuinely hurting yourself.  Good luck!|`|m17MXOsGaa	You might try purchasing a device to cushion that spot, if you're not already using one.  I know Bo Pep makes some which are fairly affordable, and I'm sure other companies do as well.  They clip onto the body of your flute, and they exist for the right thumb as well as for the left hand.  They should be available online or through your local music store.|`|vsy4QMHMaa	A bo pep might be useful. It happens because it's not a great position for your hand to be in. It's kind of a two fold problem. You are trying to support the instrument upwards with that hand, and you are providing leverage at the center of the instrument holding the mouthpiece toward your lips while your other hand is pushing the whole instrument away from you.

EwK9iZj6aa	Hell yes!!! I am sick of this dumb loser! He is a womanizer and a woman beater! He is a vicious animal, to destroy that women's face the way he did! He doesn't have any remorse for what happened! Rhianna might need a nose job! Now somebody needs to beat his *** like that! and see how he would like it!|`|PZGpFzTsaa	I'm sick of him. What he did was horrible. He should go to jail, but he's not because he's famous. I just know it. I think if you abuse your girlfriend, even if you just hit her once, you should go to jail. And Rihanna is like one of those battered woman who thinks that they love their husbands or boyfriends who hit them. She says that she is partially to blame.|`|aYghne2oaa	im sick of rihanna! why didnt she just smack him back?? i would have xD|`|bmwR7RdMaa	yes, i'm sick of him and really want him to go to jail but he cannot because rihanna is not testifying against him|`|8jxoTBWIaa	im sick of him. but im also sick of all the questions about him and rihanna. sorry dont mean to offend you. =[|`|otYTWy2uaa	yes I think most of us are pretty sick of him by now. He should have some type of jail sentence for what he did and it would prove good to the rest of us mare mortals that no one is above the law. to mike above me you are an @ss for bring that type of hate up in here.|`|ujkugcn1aa	yeah im sick of him. he gets charged for felonies and yet he can only get up to five years in prison. if a regular person did that he would get even more years in prison. thats not fair.|`|VKMGfp2laa	I never hated Chris Brown or liked him that much.

EwK9iZj6aa	I think hollywood has a negative impact because mostly every one is stick bone skinny! I am not skinny, not fat neither! So someone like me would be considered fat because I am curvy! I think hollywood needs to be more Diverse in body image! All these young girls think that skinny is beautiful. Another thing hollywood is doing, showing young teenage girls that it's cool to have kids early! Look at it this way, mostly all young people look up to celebs. When they see celebs with babies on their hip, they think that's cool and hip! Hollywood Is a mess! and I don't look up to it!|`|kJ7mcPLbaa	Negative. The only indsustry that's worse is politics. Hollywood used to be filled with talent and class. Now it's a cesspool of lying, cheating, talentless, fake people who enjoy playing the victim when REAL life happens to them, poor babies. BAD examples for anyone. All that money and they have no class at all!|`|IaK4SRHpaa	Negative because I think most of the celebrities have negative impact because of how they act by drinking and doing drugs.  However, there are a select few like Brad Pitt and Angelina Jolie, Nicole Kidman, and even Donald Trump who use their celebrity to help raise money for charity organizations.|`|8s5npA54aa	Negative because it makes people think that they have to look that perfect all the time, when really, it's a lot of airbrushing and stuff. Also, celebrities aren't really always the best role models for young girls. Like how Rihanna took Chris Brown back? Young girls should know that that's not okay.|`|ujkugcn1aa	negative. some people get obsessed over celebrities and their lives, and thats unhealthy. there are even bad celeb role models and little children follow them and might become bad too.|`|Yazpoadnaa	Either way, <br>  You can choose to look up to someone <br>  I dont know why all celebritys are supposed to be role models. <br>  Its basically just a job.|`|aJB1OPoFaa	I think show business is probably one of the dirtiest form of business ...alongside with politics <br>  <br>  well on the other hand positives? they can use fame and money|`|VVA3nDTtaa	Celebrities have a negative impact on society because they act like little whores and jack asses. "OMG that's so hawt." "Chill out mom I just had sex with him because he bought me dinner." This has caused an ideal in the children of American (And the rest of the world) that this is how the rest of the people of the world are supposed to act. So young teens go out with someone for a day and then their like "OMG I LOVE HIM SO MUCH." When they don't even know them. Since they saw the people on T.V. do it, it's ok.

You can choose your most favorite part in source files through setting the start point and end point.<br>  <br>  You can download RZ Video Converter from rzfun.com, following is a step by step guide:<br>  <a href="http://www.rzvideoconverter.com/rzvideoconverter/videoconverteruserguide.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.rzvideoconverter.com/rzvideoc...</a><br>  <br>  Please note, the RZ Video Converter trial version will add watermark on the target video, but if you only convert audios, it is free without any limit.<br>  <br>  Hope it can help you.|`|OjoRulRUaa	dunno!
1879d070aa100c3521e7b105cc7b3112aa	That's about five questions, I think.<br>  <br>  1. Do you really need the bottom head of a drum?<br>  In short, no. Many drummers in the 1970's removed their bottom heads for a more "open" tom sound and to have the ability to mic the batter head from underneath very closely. The mics of the 70's were no where near the quality of even the cheapest mics today. In the late 70's and through the 80's, Ludwig made "concert toms" that actually had no bottom lugs or hoops specifically for the one-headed tom.<br>  <br>  2. What are bottom heads for? <br>  This depends on the type of drum. On a snare drum, the bottom (resonant head) is used to lay snares against and get the "snare" sound. On rare occasions, drummers will go without a bottom snare head and strain the snares across the bottom of the batter (top) head. On toms and kicks, the bottom head is used to adjust overtones to make the drum ring more or less depending on what sound your looking for. It also adjusts the overall tonality of the drum. <br>  <br>  3. Do they reduce overtones?<br>  They can reduce or increase overtones depending on the tuning. Most drummers today play with single-ply bottom heads tuned up a bit to create an overtone that simultaneously shortens the ring and deepen the overall tone of the drum.<br>  <br>  4. What is the best way to tune my drums?<br>  That's like asking the best way to make a pizza. It's really up to the taste of the chef...or the drummer, in this case. Even after 25 years of playing professionally, I am still experimenting and learning about different tuning techniques. The more I learn, the more I need to learn. I think this is true of all drummers. My current personal technique is to tighten each lug until each lug barely takes tension. Then, I place my left palm in the middle of the head and press down with good force but not hard enough to cause damage to the head. This will cause the head to wrinkle. Then, I tighen the lugs until the wrinkles smooth out. Then I strike the drum and listen. Generally, it's pretty close to perfect. If it needs a little fine tuning, I do it by ear. <br>  <br>  5. New rock sound. Tighter or Looser?<br>  Unfortunately, the tension or tuning of the head doesn't really factor into what you hear at a pro show or on CD. Most modern rock recordings are so over-produced the sound you hear is no where near what the real kit sounded like when it was played in the studio. The same goes for the band when they play live. The sound of the drums is the work of the audio engineer not the drum itself. This is done with triggers, drum replacement programs, thousand dollar mics and half a million dollars in compressors, gates, subs, mains, crossovers and other processors. A $150 kit with a plastic heads would sound the same as a top-of-the-line kit.  To make your drums sound like the CDs you're listening to, start with quality heads. I recommend Evans G2s or Evans EQ3s for your toms and snare. I personally use the Evans EC reverse dot head for my snare. The king of all kick drum heads is by far the Evans EMAD. They're all a bit pricey but once I hit 'em, it was money well spent. (No, I don't work for Evans.) If, however, you're into a more retro sound (Bonham, Phillips, Mitchell etc), and you still want to keep two hoops on your drum, Evans offers Black Retro Screen mesh heads that brings back the classic sound of a single-headed kick while still keeping your shell in round. <br>  <br>  In any case, keep researching, experimenting and tuning. It's an art not a science.
000db28fb52ab31dee59ac037328db75aa	I think it's about past relationships seem like different lives. Sometimes when you go to places you've been before you are reminded of happier times. But right now, you're lonely and not in a relationship. But sometimes it's good to remember what it was like.
xTioPxaVaa	Don't but the tuner based on that.  The mic probably has a limited bandwidth.  Enough for the tuner but not enough to sound good through the amp.<br>  <br>  If you're wanting to plug your acoustic into an amp, then buy a pickup made for that purpose, and then get a tuner with a built in mic.<br>  <br>  <br>  Greetings from Austin, Tx<br>  <br>  Ken
xAfxWOx6aa	I don't know, I looked up the lyrics on google. <br>  <br>  But listening closely to the quality of the composition, recording and the singer, I have a strong feeling she's an amateur singer-songwriter who has never been signed to any label.<br>  <br>  A song like this would probably never be released into any market because no one would want to buy it.|`|andgb1hDaa	i don't know the closest i got was this song-<br>  <a href="http://www.allthelyrics.com/lyrics/eric_clapton/shes_waiting-lyrics-143533.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.allthelyrics.com/lyrics/eric_...</a><br>  but it's not right.

They are strong in certain areas, but in the areas where they are weak, you are strong.<br>  <br>  So Virgos can be pretty cold when they want to be. Are you very warm and nurturing? Virgos are also wound up tight about cleanliness. Are you a little messy?  Maybe you are the type who asks for help. Virgos have an innate desire to help.<br>  <br>  Analyze what it is you have to offer, and see if that isn't what the Virgo lacks. I think you're supplying them with something they don't have within themselves, and they admire you for it.|`|eFvBGBbyaa	because your pisces durr|`|41fe712a36ecf2746af8f97a562a2794aa	Pretty much?

7B5puxVOaa	Does this really surprise you?  I'm an American, and I thought your question was witty, with an element of truth to it.  I knew some jack-off would report it.|`|VfYvJypEaa	Because the English and the Ozzies are proper hard ( even though the Ozzies cheat at sports ) and the Septics are over sensitive and lack a sense of humour .<br>  <br>  Ozzy ; Who was it that one the world cup in Sidney ? Even when the ref' was clearly on your side . Not to mention the Olympics .|`|yE1VgFhiaa	What did us Irish do to ya....why didnt we get insulted!!<br>  seriously-it's their sensitive little souls- they cant handle a slaggin|`|UjPArJZ6aa	The English and Aussies share the same sense of humour. We both have the ability to laugh at others, but more importantly, at ourselves. <br>  <br>  Americans don't seem to understand when someone is just taking the p*ss in a tongue in cheek way....perhaps they need to remove that iron rod they seem to have stuck up their ar$es, hee hee...<br>  <br>  << Is waiting for all the thumbs down now. Oh and Rik, we don't cheat hun...you guys just need to toughen up some and actually give us more of a challenge...it's sports, not bloody tea and crumpets time, hee hee...<br>  <br>  Add: *Mumbles something about not knowing anything about that*  :P|`|1uIbCMmiaa	Just be grateful they only deleted your question..|`|8uIfskigaa	Pass no heed there is always someone ready & waiting to report.. :)|`|xe6wc0jXaa	That's because Americans are so paranoid they think everyone is out to get them. Which is true. And now in the true american spirit I expect them to give me thumbs down and report me cause that's what their like.

I couldn't see anything wrong with it, but why Yahoo Canada.  I am English|`|PlRYgRcoaa	I understand, what your saying, yanks are easily offended take everything so serious.. Anyway they'll be washing our cars soon, because they as a nation are on the slide down.|`|dqZrq7Zeaa	Maybe Americans are totally fed up with being the world's little whipping boy.|`|1K8NPRUOaa	maybe American's have no humor like the Australians.|`|YljbIqskaa	I had nothing to do with that.<br>  I said what I had to say and was dun with it.|`|PMGXddjgaa	It shows democracy works well in the UK and Australia!!!!! xxxx|`|q0FslERqaa	because America is the super power|`|Nhz3LHXGaa	Because most Americans are egotistical cry-babies.|`|Pp9Bl4QDaa	it's probably how many americans.  i don't see your point

I don't think giving stars away is a good indicator of whether or not a contact is supportive. I'd much rather stay in touch with my contacts through email rather than give a star for the sake of it. That is how I gauge close contacts from casual ones.|`|K5L63wbeaa	I star any question I think is good, and I always look at my contacts questions in that space on your profile. I also open up all my favourite's profiles and look at there questions to make sure I didnt miss a good one.|`|iKmkRaqBaa	Many never care to star a question.

N9pKl35Xaa	When you give me the address|`|Jy6dFXjVaa	To be truthful, it all depends on the situation and how urgent the need was as to how I would go about answering this question.<br>  <br>  First thing I would ask is, 'are the kids okay?' And if they are, then I'll ask if there's any particular reason that I need to come home right now? If I'm not given a good reason, then I'll say 'I will be home when I get home. I'm still at the doctor, hair salon or out shopping.' Whichever one I happen to be doing when I get the call.<br>  <br>  If my husband or son need something in particular or if they just want me to pick up some fast food and hurry home, then yes, I'll give them an approximate time as to when I will be home. But there are other times that I just want to have some quiet time to myself and I really don't want to be bothered (unless it relates to something that I consider to be really important, of course). And for Pete's sake, don't call me when I'm at the dentist having a crown put on one of my teeth just to tell me you are starving and ask if I will pick up something to eat and come home asap. Things sometimes get complicated requiring more time than we had anticipated and things don't always work out exactly the way we expect them to.<br>  <br>  It can be very aggravating when I receive five or six calls if I have been away from the house for two or three hours, especially when I get calls wanting to know when I'm coming home, just for the sake wanting to know how much longer I'll be gone. The world isn't going to end if I go to the salon to have my hair cut, go to get a back massage or if I get lost in Barnes & Nobles looking at books. But anytime our son has a good reason for asking when I'm coming home, I'll drop whatever I'm doing and I'll rush home. An example would be like when my son calls me from school and he needs me to bring him a clean shirt because some idiot spilled his / her lunch all over his shirt. Or if he is in the nurse's office and he's running a temperature, I'll drop whatever I'm doing to go pick him up immediately. Once in a while, I'll get a call from my son wanting to know when I'm coming home and when I ask him "why do you need to know," he'll tell me it's because he misses me and he wants me at home to spend time with me. I think that is a sweet reason, especially considering that he'll be turning 17 in three weeks. That will often do the trick to get me to wrap up whatever I'm doing and I'll come home asap. Like I said, it just depends on the situation, especially considering that I'm almost always at home, as compared to the ocassional times that I'm away from home.<br>  <br>  Sorry.

Shortly afterward, she told him that she was pregnant. Not wanting his wife to know, he gave the nurse a sum of money and asked her to go to Italy and have the baby there. <br>  <br>  'But how will I let you know the baby is born?' she asked. <br>  <br>  He replied, 'Just send me a postcard and write 'spaghetti' on the back. I'll take care of expenses.' Not knowing what else to do, the nurse took the money and flew to Italy. <br>  <br>  Six months went by, and then one day the doctor's wife called him at the office and said, 'Dear, you received a very strange postcard in the mail today from Europe, and I don't understand what it means.' <br>  <br>  The doctor said, 'Just wait until I get home and I will explain it to you.' <br>  <br>  Later that evening the doctor came home, read the postcard, and fell to the floor with a heart attack. Paramedics rushed him to the hospital emergency room. The head medic stayed back to comfort the wife. He asked what trauma had precipitated the cardiac arrest. <br>  <br>  So the wife picked up the card and read: 'Spaghetti, Spaghetti, Spaghetti, Spaghetti - Two with sausage and meatballs; two without.'|`|zhK1PGioaa	LOL. totally unexpected.<br>  =]|`|fPN2KV1Taa	Haha.

N9pKl35Xaa	Yes. But when i was at school (only just Graduated last year lol!) But when i was at school a fair few teachers had Facebook and a lot, nearly all, would not accept students who were at school, but would accept them once they left and they were 18yrs of age. I don't know if that is a "Law" or its something that teachers just do. <br>  <br>  I've not yet added any or tried to search for any, but i would definately add them maybe not any time soon because i just left and it would make me look a little desparate lol!

I remember watching the summer Olympics as a kid and then the winter ones, I always made sure I saw decent amounts of winter, and just highlights of the Summer games.

Its a lot harder and more irrelevant to cheat in the winter games, which are a lot faster paced and intense, plus theres that added difficulty of the environment which just makes things even more entertaining.|`|yaZ6tnxxaa	summer...it's a lot more exciting in my opinion. but winter is good too. i just have a hard time finding which event i like in the winter olympics.|`|XENd8mNhaa	My  answer is if you picked summer you have picked a winner.|`|zM9Lj21waa	both, bobsled events in the winter and track and field in the summer...|`|LgNqYUECaa	Winter|`|yf0Qm9gMaa	Winter X)|`|0QXiPW9eaa	Summer!<br>  <br>  Winter Olympics make me feel cold. xD|`|iBH7NTl3aa	Brrrrrrrrrr the summer hun!|`|U23DRFtbaa	Summer|`|qSQkZVlwaa	SUMMER!!!!!!!!!!!|`|CplYpG8Naa	both ............ sports is gr8 nyewayzzz!!!|`|wmBK9uASaa	Summer....|`|thcr8Y5vaa	Summer Olympics...|`|YTQGKzuqaa	I prefer the Summer Olympics =]|`|shvhgzXeaa	Summer|`|T5DbLLgQaa	Both!

gQEtEtLQaa	I really don't want to see Sam and Dean facing off against each other at the end of this season but everything I've seen and read seems to suggest that that's what we're heading towards.  I would like it back to the way it was in the first couple of seasons too.  Season 3 was really intense with them trying to find a way out of Dean's demon deal and that was great!! But I guess after taking their relationship to that level the only way it could go would be down.  I always hate it whenever they take a swing at each other - granted it doesn't happen very often but Dean has hit Sam a couple of times now like in 'Bloodlust' and again in season 4 - not to mention the brutal fight they had in 'Sex and Violence'! And every time it happens I just wince!  Sam and Dean have the best brotherly relationship ever and after everything they've been through with Dean selling his soul and going to Hell for Sam - they've got to work things out and they will - but I think things are going to get a helluva lot worse before they get better :*(|`|k4T1Jgblaa	You said it: "I just want them back the way they were."<br>  <br>  I wish the whole show would go back the way it was.  I mean what on earth have they put these ridiculous ANGELS in it for ?<br>  <br>  The whole show has kinda lost its way - - - it always happens when the writers run out of ideas.  Like the X Files - - -|`|fHgbL046aa	I would hate that, but it doesn't seem to mater what we think. The show is finished by season 5. Which I'm upset about because I love Sam and Dean and the show Supernatural. I do believe they will fight at the end  because that is the direction they are heading. Will have to wait and see.|`|b2F8e4R3aa	No, we already saw them fight last episode and that is enough for me. I really want the old relationship back, I miss it a lot. Especially the true sibling joking and small fights. Maybe more pranks? But that is not likely to happen due to the whole big appocalypse showdown this season is focused on. With the new big plot, the boys are going to be a lot more distant. Especially with the whole Sam-Ruby demon power thing, and Dean being visited by angel's, it draws a line between the two brothers. I don't really know what will happen, but things have already been put into motion and I doubt the brothers will ever truly be like the used to be.|`|u2EUom6daa	No i really do not want them to fight each other as they are so close as brothers (well at least they used to be) i love there relationship and would be very disappointed if supernatural was to end with them fighting to death i want to see the guys back to pulling pranks on each other and being very close.....

kXxaUnSUaa	Personally, I love it!<br>  <br>  If you like any kind of teen/high school movies you will love it. It's really the original high school movie, which spawned all the others and really set the stereotyesp for high school characters.<br>  <br>  Definitely worth a watch!|`|3a224bc9c288ac93308b66bc4c330f97aa	If your a Teenager - you can relate - my daughter watched it and really liked it - have to admit that I enjoyed it as well - went to school with the same type of kids - so all in all I thought that it was a pretty good film -|`|wwlb1lznaa	It did a good job of depicting high school cliques and outsiders, but I doubt in real life the character's would have tried to get along, even for 5 minutes.|`|ngIBXfnsaa	i don't think it's the movie for everyone<br>  i was really bored at it|`|B1mEwSXWaa	My dear Spencer....<br>  <br>  Well...honey...I've not seen the movie yet...and I guess I'll be waiting until it comes on TV...(in order to save the $$$)-smile-<br>  <br>  Send you my best wishes for a happy weekend and all my love...Annette***|`|Y4RS35M7aa	It may not be for everyone, but most people really love it!

She is currently dating someone who is 20 and she is 16 (that's illegal). I just don't like the things she has done and don't think she is nearly as good a single as everyone seems to think she is.

My sister did that and got a few offers and now she has an awsome roommate.<br>  Just make sure they are reliable and honest.

bXF1gDTcaa	there are still actresses and actors and singers that are much older than that and have an amazing career. it doesnt matter when you start, all ages are always needed. and everyone has a birthday. aging is inevitable. yes, we all hope to do it gracefully and not appear to be quite as old as we really are, but age isn't going to affect your ability and talent if you're working at it. <br>  <br>  go for it :)|`|sxk08R2caa	yeah- everyone should have the same opportunities. it's during the second year in that i start to judge celebs

9EjzebnFaa	I donate all the time.  Make sure to drink plenty of water the day before, eat a good sized meal a few hours before you donate, and take a big breath and relax.  <br>  <br>  I've also fainted before (NEVER while donating) and it's not scary.  Just embarrassing.<br>  <br>  One more thing to keep on your mind, research has shown that donating blood can actually prolong your life.  When you donate blood regularly you are making your body develop fresh, new red blood cells to replace the old ones.  Donating on a regular basis is actually good for your health and it helps so many other people.|`|4c2cb618b8c167d7beb0c2cc5a36fe4faa	You are worrying unnecessarily. You will be given coffee and biscuits to have soon after you donate blood. You wont faint unless you have made up your mind to faint. Before donating blood, they check your weight. If a person weighs less than 45 kilos, then that person cant donate blood or else he/she would feel weak. In your case, if you weigh more than 45 kilos, then you need not worry at all.|`|dqZrq7Zeaa	No, it's not scary. If you lie down ... It's much harder to faint. Just get up slowly. Most people lay down when giving blood.<br>  If you feel like you're going to faint... sort of dizzy and strange... remember people don't have problems after a simple fainting spell.<br>  And good for you! Giving blood is a fine thing to do.|`|7nRom97Daa	slight to no chance|`|48WkXo1Taa	I've donated blood 3 times... Before you donate blood make sure you eat really good.As long as you eat well the chances are low..  and they wont let you if you weight less than 110-115. I weight 117 and I have never fainted.  Once your done donating blood they give you food so you dont feel sick.<br>  good luck..|`|Rmbwvm2uaa	I've fainted once while giving blood, its not scary, the nurses there have seen it happen so many times they know exactly what to do.<br>  I'd say the chances are maybe 1 in 20 if its your first few donations, and after that its pretty rare.|`|krZeHyouaa	I don't think you will faint, but if you do, some people say you dream stuff something like that. So don't worry x|`|fe3cf86ee176021daf6b79ae5ae6df7daa	Very little chance. You are being a good person for giving blood. So proud of you!!!!!|`|BQkjwC7Caa	All I would say is have something decent to eat before giving blood.|`|AA11569882	I faint!  I've given blood four times, the first time I was sick, the second time I fainted there, and the third and fourth time I went home and fainted... I'm not allowed to do it anymore.  However, when my boyfriend does it he doesn't feel any different.  It all depends on the person.<br>  <br>  Eat a decent breakfast and lunch before you go, and drink loads of sweet drinks - like ribena or orange squash all day.  I think that's where I went wrong.|`|FgRUdQOBaa	Relax, you wont faint. <br>  You are doing a very good thing, good for you.
C8DOT8Y7aa	I will have fear|`|d23F89ECaa	I've worked for allot of people and had allot of bosses.

2qVOjNvhaa	It's difficult to say considering that CBS has not announced it's 2009-2010 season yet.  However, given that NCIS has (1) been doing consistently quite well in the ratings; and (2) grown it's audience in it's sixth season (a rare occurrence to be sure), there's every reason to believe the show will be renewed.<br>  <br>  CBS upfronts are scheduled in May, which is the usual time for announcing the new fall season.  We probably won't hear anything definitive before that.|`|AA11504809	I'd say there is a 100% possibility that there will be a 7th season of NCIS, it has really high ratings this season, even the re-runs have higher ratings than other big shows which are not re-runs. they don't announce that a show will return next season until after the current season ends.
FgRUdQOBaa	Hahahaha<br>  <br>  noooo, she is not fat.<br>  But to be perfectly objective I should see more of her, just to be sure.|`|456d68efa2a1d62c7af67d47f76d8bf0aa	Nope!

ckeBvt23aa	The only hero's that have died in Shippuden so far have been Asuma and that older Sand elder. The rest of what people are saying have yet to happen because they are referring to the manga. Also, Hinata is not dead yet but we can presume she will survive. Kakashi isn't dead for sure, it is a theory that he is having a death experience most likely he is dead, but here's hoping he isn't.|`|olSj12Vkaa	first of all, you've got some grammar issues going on<br>  <br>  second, Kakashi Sensi , Shizune and Hinata are presumably dead, Asuma Sensi died a while back and a bunch of other minor characters have died too.|`|wdJS5MuUaa	The only hero`s in naruto  that i know died were Tsunade and Jiraiya.|`|f4ed8d9c313d778ec37048e45a66bd35aa	hopefully Pein and very peinfully and then sasuke XD sick of those 2|`|SY2dabbzaa	Jiriya then probably kakashi and shizune<br>  asuma

zxKhnbhNaa	I'm no work of art myself, but she does have a pretty dodgy, angular face. If you combine that with her degree of intellect and non existent charisma, i think it pretty easy to see why some find her unattractive, inside and out.<br>  <br>  Even her own grandfather thinks she's disgrace.|`|8j70Neqeaa	skank|`|LDSL0DUiaa	Cuz shes fake and shes covered with tons of surgery and a covergirl mask|`|gDEFlWnOaa	I just don't think she's pretty, and her eyes just... I don't know. Her eyes are weird, she's too skinny, and not to mention her diva- personality...|`|q2AsDnjpaa	Her actions make her ugly. Not her physical features|`|8juUgSK2aa	I think most people just think she is ugly on the inside.|`|luwBPdE8aa	She is ugly and too skinny.|`|d07797575b9836110677f24a37896268aa	I think she is too thin, is a bit dumb and lacks a personality, and no personality means ugly to me.|`|SBpl494Uaa	she is not totally unattractive but I personally like my women with more meat on there bones.|`|84eecd1a05ce02d2c2c9fb77423f6e95aa	Her features are too plain to call her pretty.  I wouldn't call her ugly, though.|`|GmTMVmASaa	jealousy|`|rPoKRm8gaa	I think shes pretty :)|`|YUkwTD2gaa	it's just her eyes. it makes her look like she's stoned or somin' :/|`|PMGXddjgaa	Paris Hilton and "think" just dont go in the same sentence!!! xxx|`|eMSv7RwYaa	i think it could be a lot to do with her personality.|`|2eztcCO0aa	Paris Hilton is unattractive because she has nothing to offer anyone except her wealth and her physical beauty (such that it is--most of it is the result of a lot of make-up, the right hairstyle, expensive clothes).<br>  <br>  The truly beautiful woman is intelligent, witty, kind, and has a purpose in life other than to be on TV.|`|hojXkBgfaa	Maybe it's how they view her on the inside and that's what they find unattractive,<br>  and all the makeup and photo-shop in the world can make anyone beautiful.<br>  Personally I feel she's a bad example for girls that are constantly having that idiotic baby talk shoved down there throat<br>  and thinking it's cute to act stupid, and for that she's disgusting to me.|`|dCtTXwACaa	Plan to Strengthen the Economy<br>  The Problem<br>  <br>  Wages are Stagnant as Prices Rise: While wages remain flat, the costs of basic necessities are increasing. The cost of in-state college tuition has grown 35 percent over the past five years. Health care costs have risen four times faster than wages over the past six years. And the personal savings rate is now the lowest it's been since the Great Depression.<br>  Tax Cuts for Wealthy Instead of Middle Class: The Bush tax cuts give those who earn over $1 million dollars a tax cut nearly 160 times greater than that received by middle-income Americans. At the same time, this administration has refused to tackle health care, education and housing in a manner that benefits the middle class.<br>  Barack Obama and Joe Biden's Plan<br>  <br>  Jumpstart the Economy<br>  Enact a Windfall Profits Tax to Provide a $1,000 Emergency Energy Rebate to American Families:Barack Obama and Joe Biden will enact a windfall profits tax on excessive oil company profits to give American families an immediate $1,000 emergency energy rebate to help families pay rising bills. This relief would be a down payment on the Obama-Biden long-term plan to provide middle-class families with at least $1,000 per year in permanent tax relief.<br>  Provide $50 billion to Jumpstart the Economy and Prevent 1 Million Americans from Losing Their Jobs: This relief would include a $25 billion State Growth Fund to prevent state and local cuts in health, education, housing, and heating assistance or counterproductive increases in property taxes, tolls or fees. The Obama-Biden relief plan will also include $25 billion in a Jobs and Growth Fund to prevent cutbacks in road and bridge maintenance and fund school re pair - all to save more than 1 million jobs in danger of being cut.<br>  Provide Middle Class Americans Tax Relief<br>  Obama and Biden will cut income taxes by $1,000 for working families to offset the payroll tax they pay.<br>  Provide a Tax Cut for Working Families: Obama and Biden will restore fairness to the tax code and provide 150 million workers the tax relief they need. Obama and Biden will create a new "Making Work Pay" tax credit of up to $500 per person, or $1,000 per working family. The "Making Work Pay" tax credit will completely eliminate income taxes for 10 million Americans.<br>  Eliminate Income Taxes for Seniors Making Less than $50,000: Barack Obama will eliminate all income taxation of seniors making less than $50,000 per year. This proposal will eliminate income taxes for 7 million seniors and provide these seniors with an average savings of $1,400 each year. Under the Obama-Biden plan, 27 million American seniors will also not need to file an income tax return.<br>  Simplify Tax Filings for Middle Class Americans: Obama and Biden will dramatically simplify tax filings so that millions of Americans will be able to do their taxes in less than five minutes. Obama and Biden will ensure that the IRS uses the information it already gets from banks and employers to give taxpayers the option of pre-filled tax forms to verify, sign and return. Experts estimate that the Obama-Biden proposal will save Americans up to 200 million total hours of work and aggravation and up to $2 billion in tax preparer fees.<br>  Trade<br>  Obama and Biden believe that trade with foreign nations should strengthen the American economy and create more American jobs. He will stand firm against agreements that undermine our economic security.<br>  Fight for Fair Trade: Obama and Biden will fight for a trade policy that opens up foreign markets to support good American jobs. They will use trade agreements to spread good labor and environmental standards around the world and stand firm against agreements like the Central American Free Trade Agreement that fail to live up to those important benchmarks. Obama and Biden will also pressure the World Trade Organization to enforce trade agreements and stop countries from continuing unfair government subsidies to foreign exporters and nontariff barriers on U.S. exports.<br>  Amend the North American Free Trade Agreement: Obama and Biden believe that NAFTA and its potential were oversold to the American people. They will work with the leaders of Canada and Mexico to fix NAFTA so that it works for American workers.<br>  Improve Transition Assistance: To help all workers adapt to a rapidly changing economy, Obama and Biden will update the existing system of Trade Adjustment Assistance by extending it to service industries, creating flexible education accounts to help workers retrain, and providing retraining assistance for workers in sectors of the economy vulnerable to dislocation before they lose their jobs.<br>  End Tax Breaks for Companies that Send Jobs Overseas: Barack Obama and Joe Biden believe that companies should not get billions of dollars in tax deductions for moving their operations overseas. Obama and Biden will also fight to ensure that public contracts are awarded to companies that are committed to American workers.<br>  Reward C|`|vZDUwF0Naa	personally her nose is to long, bt really wat makes her ugly is her personality, shes so boring and so big headed and thinks the world revolves around her, stuck up person who ***** give a damn for anyone bt herself, who cars if shes rich, i would rather be a poor person than to be like her !|`|u40H1TDGaa	People are attracted to people like them really. <br>  So big, stupid guys will fancy her.

ZbpaRKkUaa	I'd never read the X Men before it came out. But I took to it like a duck to water. Now I am an expert.

You don't have to read the comic to enjoy it.|`|ErmcT4uUaa	Im a big fan of the comic and read it when it came out in single issue form way back. I have been waiting for them to make it into a movie but had no idea how they could pull it off. Well they did.<br>  It was great and I was real happy with it.<br>  I think they made it easy for people who never read it to like also. You wont need to read the book to understand it at all.|`|r9lfDeRmaa	You might like it even though you have read the novel, I have never read the novel and am stoked to see it. It could be a hindrance to have read the novel before because then you would be expecting different things from the outcome of the movie. I pretty sure I'm going to like it.

W49O7Lvpaa	The actual experience of clubbing is not very pleasant...unless on drugs or highly intoxicated lol<br>  <br>  It is basically a smelly,sweaty,claustrophobic boring experience in general.<br>  <br>  I would much rather pubs,travel and spending my time doing things that basically all your senses can enjoy!<br>  <br>  To enjoy the music is good...but would you really feel any better if you had spent the time waving a glow stick around in a muddy field somewhere?<br>  <br>  Probably not!|`|PTwQMnTRaa	It depends on who you're clubbing with.  Yeah clubbing at a random club alone . . . yeah that sucks.   But go with Cousins, Friends, sorority sisters, frat brothers - or any one fun you know and it's a blast.  You wont even notice the other people there. That is, until they notice you- Enjoy life.  Everything in moderation.  There are people that all they do is club.  That is pointless.  That's like eating cake breakfast lunch and dinner daily.  But here and there can give you great memories.  It's good to unwind|`|ZeYYHByTaa	too noisy<br>  girls = too revealing<br>  too much drink consumption<br>  <a href="http://uk.answers.yahoo.com/question/index?qid=20090505130508AA4lf5X">http://uk.answers.yahoo.com/question/ind...</a>|`|9GYrj5W9aa	2 months till im 18 and i start going out :P<br>  i cant get in any where atm xD|`|5BOV76bmaa	Well i personally like going clubbing but i also like going to the little dive bars and pubs too. Im only 18 but i know i will soon go off clubbing. People these days are too violent!

It was Thursday and girls only had to pay a penny to get in. I thought it was the tackiest waste of time I had ever spent. Drinks cost a fortune, and I couldn't understand why the girls in the toilet hadn't put their make up on before they came out (I was pretty young and didn't know about touching up your make up). The drinks were expensive, the noise and heat were horrendous and it was 80's music which even in the 80's was pretty dire. <br>  AND I NEVER MET A SINGLE DECENT GUY THERE EVER!!

7dBAgFK8aa	Just work on you finger placement. Pick one chord (G or C) and play it over and over again. Make sure your fingers are arched enough so the section of your finger from the tip to the first joint is completely straight. This might be uncomfortable at first, but you'll get use to it eventually.<br>  <br>  If you have small hands, it might be a good idea to buy a guitar made for younger musicians, or even a girls guitar, as these usually have smaller necks/bodies to compensate for that.
qBvDaOzeaa	Yes, I get very animated when I'm on the phone, more than if we're standing face-to-face.

That was rather amusing lol|`|v0Bk9fWGaa	ians bum tattoo Aunty~]|`|lTmrWBRlaa	I thought the time when Dot got an i pod was hilarious !|`|WxWiP3QJaa	Eastenders has always had comical characters and situations in it - I think the very first "living" character shown in the show was a character called "Lofty", the first character shown was a dead bloke sat in an armchair. <br>  <br>  If you're younger than 35 you won't remember Lofty, or Rod (another classic comedy character from the show) - but Lofty was pure comedy (though with plenty of tragedy too, as any drama should be) and became a national icon for a time. Both Ian Beale's and Dot's character (the two longest running characters) histories are strewn with comical moments.<br>  <br>  Ange - ok, 34 then ;P|`|IwvszgPdaa	i thought the tent thing was hillarious. i will always watch eastenders. i love the characters and i always think when someone leaves that it will never be the same again but it always is. i can take or leave corrie. dont really bother with emerdale.<br>  eastenders is funny in a realistic way.<br>  by the way lee.h ive  turned 34 in january and i remember the 1st episode and all the old characters such as mary the punk, kelvin, barry & colin etc...|`|qqVcuEB3aa	I didn't find that particularly funny, but I have enjoyed the funnier scenes between Ian and Jane recently, and the night Tanya and Jane went out and got  merry and Ian grounded Jane.  Ian should have more comic scenes it makes his character more three dimensional and he can still be a prat, just a funnier one|`|cku5S9WLaa	I didn't laugh at the tent thing. But I really enjoyed some Dot scenes, particularly Dot learning to drive, Dot learning to use the computer and Dot learning to use the Ipod. Dot is my favourite.

6CAsx3jaaa	i got this and i dont think you have to be scared. your sitting comfortably next to your teenage sis. and melanie is in charge of the driving. melanie in other words is  in the drivers seat and your arent in control right now. i dont anything about you but this would suggest that you  havent started living on your own and taking on all the adult responsibilities yet. you mention a dock so i wonder if there may be some health issue for someone in your family. long pathway means your looking at your future and its a long one of being independant . but to start the foundation which is the unmaintained dock is not solid. you are also unsure of the wisdom of a decision melanie is making , possibly related to your independance. you fear that you will sink in the lake. the family members watching means that you believe that they wont be rescuing you. cell phone and cigarettes are you assessing what you have . i think they both represent your current social life. smoking  and talking to friends.  the conclusion of your dream is that the fear doesnt matter so  you will stop sweating it.|`|jrfUS1mqaa	thats strange haha idk|`|AA12016383	uhh, well dreams normally symbolize emotions, so depending on the behavior of the water that behavoir symbolizes how u feel|`|FqOewVGcaa	dreams.com i think type it in goodluck i gave u a star.|`|QGy0fBRJaa	Dreams of death represent the ending of one phase so that a new one can begin. It can show forthcoming finalities such as the end of a marriage or career.  If the dead person is someone you know, consider what aspect of yourself that person represents.  You may also be expressing your hidden feelings about the person shown. Do you have a secret resentment towards them or desire to be independent of them? <br>  <br>  Dreams of drowning or struggling in treacherous waters may represent your fear of being swallowed by forces hidden in the depths of your unconscious. The dream may show you are being overwhelmed by your emotions. You may fear sinking financially or be drowning in your difficulties. Do you feel that, in waking life, you are being 'sucked into' something you would rather not be a part of?|`|af4ib8kbaa	haha thats weird<br>  have you watched The Happening recently?!<br>  <br>  To dream that you commit suicide, suggests that conditions in your life are so frustrating that you no longer want to deal with the situation or relationship You may be harboring feelings of guilt that you cannot get over and thus turning the aggression on yourself. You need to start approaching problems from a different angle. Alternatively, it may suggest that you are saying good-bye to one aspect of yourself and hello to a whole new you. It is symbolic of a personal transformation or a new stage in your life. <br>  <br>  To see someone commit suicide in you dream, highlights your concerns for that person. Also consider what characteristics and qualities in that person you may be trying to "kill" and annihilate in your own self. Perhaps you hope that you are not like that person in some way and are making attempts to get rid of those traits within your own self.<br>  <br>  thats what it said for commiting suicide|`|66NeNxwyaa	<a href="http://www.dreammoods.com/dreamdictionary/" rel="nofollow">http://www.dreammoods.com/dreamdictionar...</a><br>  I always use this site|`|hCpqhn27aa	Dreams don't mean anything; they're just random firings of neurons.|`|w6Bfrosqaa	It means that when your sister is old enough to drive you should not get in a car with her lol|`|40LtlYXOaa	it means you are going to die in 4 days

jvHIqtp2aa	The chicken, who had slipped on some oil while trying  to cross the street, was brought into the hospital. The intern on duty gently laid the chicken down on the bedsheet. There was a minty smell in the air. "Have you been eating toothpaste?" the intern asked. "Yes", said the chicken," I am too small to be a roaster, I guess I will always be a fryer" The intern thought for a moment, "Why don't you come home with me for dinner". Thanks said the chicken, I feel much better now. The End :Answer to poll, sleep.....|`|cYsPx9sSaa	i woke up in the morning and found my bedsheet covered in chicken feathers and oil, what a dream huh? i shook my head and went to the toilet, my toothbrush was on the toilet seat, freaked out i grabbed a spare one and squeezed out some toothpaste onto the brush, only it wasnt toothbrush that came out!!!! it was mushy ants! i screamed, dropped the brush and ran. later on that day, in school i was sitting in the classroom, when my teacher called out my name, "klueless!" she screamed, "tell us, what does intern mean?" i didnt know what it meant to i shrugged my shoulders and woke up. What a night!<br>  <br>  <br>  um i would chose sleep, coz im in serious lack of it|`|WLoQOpPSaa	She reached for the toothpaste,knew she'd be late for her job as an intern.

So then while she was washing her clothes from the oil, Johnny [her little bro] switched her toothpaste with __[fill in the blank]__ so she went to her job interview and  became an intern. She went home and beat her brother for switching the toothpaste, cuz it made her teeth electric blue. She said he was a chicken and he beat her. hahahahahaha|`|ZxmyAQZvaa	In a land far far away, the toothpaste was chasing the oil down the street, as the toothpaste needed the oil to cook the chicken.

The end.  Did I win? :)<br>  <br>  poll: sleep|`|gwjBvXTbaa	The INTERN (known as Jerry) at the hospital was bored. The doctors never put him to work. He was always set to the boring tasks, like janitorial tasks ... sweeping and mopping the floors, changing the BED SHHETS, making sure all the light bulbs in the hall way where working ... *sigh* When was he ever going to be a doctor?<br>  <br>  That day the Jerry was set to the task of emptying garbage cans. Of course they would set him to the task of emptying the garbage cans full of toxic waste: the trash was filled with pulled out tonsils, TOOTHPASTE tubes filled with drained puss, removed moles, that sort of thing. Jerry sighed to himself: "What is the point of being an intern if I'll never get to be a doctor? I might as well just quit." And that is  exactly what Jerry did. <br>  <br>  Jerry was then on a job search. What job would best apply his skills he had learned at the hospital? Well, he hadn't gotten any skills from the Hospital besides those of cleaning. So, Jerry applied to work in a fast food restaurant until he could find someplace better. McConalds hired him right away.<br>  <br>  Working at McConalds was no different than Jerry's jobs at the Hospital. At McConalds Jerry had to empty the trash cans, that were full of the toxic waste left over from the cooking OILs. Jerry was skilled and was soon promoted to Manager. <br>  <br>  The first thing Jerry did as manager was to stop working with the toxic cooking OILs. Thank god he didn't have to do that job again. Jerry then assigned himself to the task of making sure the customers of McConalds were happy.<br>  <br>  One day he was patrolling the restaurant when a man started to choke on a CHICKEN wing. The wife of the man was yelling historically, "Somebody! Call a doctor! Quick." <br>  <br>  Jerry, without thinking, ran over the suffocating man. He opened the man's mouth and looked down his wind pipe. "The bone of the CHICKEN wing is lodged in his trachea," Jerry said. "This man won't make it in time to a hospital. We need to get it out here. This needs surgery!" And with that, Jerry grabbed a plastic knife and began to cut strategically into the man's throat. The operation was long and tedious as all the customers in McConalds looked on ... at last the CHICKEN wing bone was pulled from the man's mouth. The Man sat up and smiled at Jerry and gave him a hug. "Sir, you saved my life!"<br>  <br>  Jerry is now Chief at the hospital. He had achieved his dream. He was a doctor.

I also know at that at point in history, the common man was extremely naive/easily convinced, and would believe almost anything he was presented with.<br>  Had the events of the bible happened today, I'm quite sure we wouldn't be as easily impressed, and the events would no doubt be the basis for something on The Discovery Network, then scientifically explained. There's also a good chance that Nancy Grace might spend 6 months ranting about these events on CNN. Or, at the very least, Jesus would have a time slot immediately following David Blaine and Chris Angel on the FOX network.<br>  You can also pretty much guarantee that mankind would not have a religion based on these said events 2,000 years from now.<br>  <br>  Yes, I believe in love.|`|vVYj8b74aa	Do I believe in love? what kind of love.

I know i've done worse but can't think right now.|`|bKpTiFuraa	My boyfriend cheated on his ex-girlfriend because he found out she cheated on him. Then he broke up with her.|`|AA10197672	Left  my ex even though I knew it would crush him. He lied to me all the time, and hurt me over and over. The thing with me is though, if I do take a revenge on someone, id feel bad later on and then I'd have to go take it out of their hearts - i know stupid eh? Its like I can not stand anyone being mad at me,  or see them sad because of my acts, even thought they are the ones who hurt me to begin with, I always wanna please everyone. So i've never done revenge but when it came to my ex, i had NO choice but to leave and thought omyself that was the best revenge. Since we were married I could have taken him for all he had, but i did not....<br>  ..|`|sg9eywx5aa	when i  was mad at someone i put a fake love note from a secret admirer inside a gys or gurls locker telling them to meet me some where and i woulod have the uglyist loser sitting there waiting for them..but the hand writing has to be preppy and girly so they dont think somethings up and not go...=]|`|zDJVWlscaa	I used to get bullied a lot by a few girls, but quickly, the tables turned and the bullied became the bully.<br>  It is unbelievably satisfying seeing the ones that hurt you being hurt too...|`|fgK1zOSiaa	Yeah, you do have the power so use it wisely.

My ex cheated on me on top of all the bull I've put up with. Well, I left him. I took everything and left in 3 days. Then everything just unfolded. First, his car (a really nice lexus) got broken into and pretty much messed up while he was out clubbing with some hooch. Second, he got fired from his job. Third, his family fell apart and his parents separated after many years of marriage. THAT PART I NEVER WANTED TO HAPPEN. I MEAN NEVER. Other things that happened...oh and his relationship with the other girl ended in a matter of 2 months. The first time, I broke up with him, he got pulled over and had to go to jail for a DUI. I'm telling you, karma will get you. So whenever someone does something bad to me, I just let nature take its course.<br>  <br>  Back then when I was immature, I subscribed my ex to some gay publications/magazines and had them sent to his parents house. I signed him up for stuff like herpes information packets and such and had them sent to his job- where they open his mail for him. I signed him up for online dating and some other foul stuff like that. And that's just a little preview. Those days are over though.

14429844ed295bd6b6714b0da476f998aa	Perhaps it felt you spend so much time typing in Yahell that you do not need it anymore, and it took a vacation. <br>  <br>    The good news is that if you think you've lost your voice, chances are you haven't really lost it. What's more likely is that you have some degree of hoarseness, and there's plenty of help for that.<br>  <br>  How do you tell? Try to cough or clear your throat. If you can do that, you are actually vocalizing. Though your voice may be unreliable at the moment, even severely hoarse—it's just mislaid, not lost entirely.<br>  <br>  Doctors say that complete aphonia—loss of the ability to speak—is extremely rare. When it does happen, it may be the result of emotional or psychological stress.<br>  <br>  It is possible for your voice to give out entirely after abusing it—rooting too loudly at a football game, for example. You can also lose your voice for a time after a prolonged episode of laryngitis (inflammation of the vocal cords). Straining to talk through laryngitis can actually tire the muscles you use for speech to the point where they just quit working for awhile.<br>  <br>  Although it's very unusual, a tumor in the chest or lung can injure the nerves leading to the vocal cords, causing loss of the ability to speak. An accident or head or neck injury might also injure these nerves. And losing your ability to speak can be a sign of a stroke.<br>  <br>  Symptom Relief<br>  <br>  Resting your voice and drinking plenty of fluids can help ease a lost voice. But anything that helps a hoarse voice can also help one that's faded away.|`|ut3u2e65aa	I've been searching since yesterday...

Maybe you were shouting too much or singing too loud.|`|3069b01c6af41fae2223419a7bf91c01aa	Check the lost and found section of your local newspaper.|`|jvHIqtp2aa	Hire a private detective, it may be fooling around on you.|`|7b5CfjeWaa	do u talk alot??|`|Cq1Qsg8Vaa	its prolly on vacation with mine.

YCXxP43Laa	Everyone does not hate Jade Goody; there are a lot of people who aren't fans of hers, but NO ONE should ever wish cancer on anyone!!<br>  <br>  What Jade Goody is, is a creation of our celebrity culture; one where you go into a reality show and become famous, without any discernible talent.<br>  <br>  She caused a lot of offense when she bullied Shilpa Shetty in the Celebrity Big Brother house; the monster that created her threatened to destroy her, she lost magazine deals, book deals and perfume deals over it.<br>  <br>  Before the Shipla incident most people were indifferent to her, she was famous for being in a house and displaying ignorance.<br>  <br>  It is highly offensive for anyone to say another human being deserves cancer, it is a horrible disease, she and nobody else who suffers from it deserves to die.<br>  <br>  I wish people would just leave her in peace, it isn't a game and she is dying!|`|MfsV8mh3aa	I don't hate her. I don't know her. I don't have much time for her but more because I'm not too interested in minor Z list celeb watching.<br>  <br>  It was her appearance on celebrity big brother than finished her 'career' but it wasn't much of one before that.<br>  <br>  I won't bother answering the last part- stoopid question|`|Vge3KBaMaa	people are so evil thats why|`|1UOIoOzKaa	She's is a little annoying, and no one deserves cancer!<br>  But, she was getting letters from the hospital and ignored them for 7 years, that's what turned into cancer. So it's her own fault really|`|707gOCvbaa	Does anyone deserve cancer? How old are you? Cancer strikes a lot of people. Someone in your family could  have it right now and not know it. It's okay to be curious as to why people dislike her but to insinuate she deserves to die so horribly is unethical of you and makes me wonder if you have a soul or is simply too young and naive. I hope for your sake it's the later.
VtMgUpMYaa	My first "solo" was nerve wrecking, it was in front of my whole school around over 1000 people and I'm very stage shy.<br>  you just have to tell your self you are that good, your better then the rest because you got it, they chose you for a reason. you could have never got it if they didn't think you could do it. when your actually singing hold your body high. your legs will shake (because your nervous) but stand firm. Not like a statue, still show emotion and pride in what you are singing. You don't need to worry about smiling when your done it just happens, your face just lights up.<br>  <br>  A few tips:<br>  you don't have to look at people, look at the back wall or a flag<br>  don't stare look at different spot in the room<br>  do take deep breaths before and after<br>  if your too close to the mic you can move back a tiny bit<br>  Have Fun, even if you mess up at least you got the chance to sing|`|aHoUwtCvaa	I agree with Britanny. Don't look at people. Look near them so it seems like your looking at them, but don't look at them. I do a lot of acting and I used to practically pee myself I was so scared. I would just sing/ act to the back wall. It looks convincing and is a lot easier on you.|`|DIpR6TBYaa	I think you should just sing and focus on listening to your singing so you wont focus so much on ppl|`|Ap8tyiUlaa	What i do is i just dont look at people in the eye lol|`|WBl8htsBaa	You seem to be confident that you can perform, so when you step on stage just let all that confidence come out. You must just believe in yourself and have fun... I always say the only person who can judge me is myself. So i am confident in front of people. So, just take a deep breath in........ and out (do it again if you still feel nervous) and relax and GOOD LUCK!!! :D|`|ww3lai2Zaa	Smile. Relax. Don't worry. Look at everyone, but to people you know mostly. Remember: if you mess up, it'll be worse so do your best. Think this way: it's not like all of those 300 people know you, you'll do fine.<br>  <br>  GOOD LUCK! :)|`|nGkCWpRVaa	look over the top of the crowd|`|quIDrXktaa	I think it's all about where your head is at.  Remember how many people in the audience would love to be where you are. The centre of attention. Remember how rarely you're the attraction rather than the audience. Revel in it. You'll be great.

8xdcBKfUaa	Yes, little Michael Morgan Corinthos III, is indeed coming back. But Dylan Cash will not be portraying little Michael, and he won't be so little, either. I've read that he will be at least 16, will come out of the coma with no memory. It is evident that General Hospital is combining two of their key story lines of the past, and putting them into Michael's situation: Jason's brain damage and Laura's return from catatonia. This new brainwave procedure does wake Michael up (as in Laura's case), but he wakes up with no memories...or compassion...of his friends and family (as in Jason's case). So we'll see just how this story line turns out, but in short, Michael will be awake by the summer.|`|NGNeT3rYaa	Yes although it will first be thought that it didnt and Carly will accept that he is in the coma for good but his fingers will move and his heart rate start to pick up.These things won;t be noticed to anyone but viewers.They have to reacast Michael first so it may take a bit.|`|D3Fyxj0raa	yes it works and he wakes up by this summer|`|xXa3eQOeaa	Sure, he will come back, but instead of "the little Mobster" that Dylan Cash had come to portray, he will actually "like" the idea of being a Quartermaine! THAT would be funny! It would drive Sonny & Carly, and Jason nuts, if that happened. He could change his identity to A.J. Quartermaine III, what a hoot!!|`|RVABrMeSaa	yes however he'll be more like Jason was after his accident.  Total personality change and no memory.|`|ppE0GtkIaa	as long as that other red head Michael doeesnt come back, he was a creepy kid.|`|7XM4QJiuaa	I heard he comes out this summer.|`|ZmGOL8kCaa	They do the surgery on Michael next week, and all they said is that his finger moves. Whether the person they'll be operating on will be Dylan Cash or someone else; I don't know. But I expect him to come out of his coma sometime in the next few months (at least before September). He'll be at least 16 when he comes out of his coma. :P|`|ADBMrG87aa	Yes and Michael will wake up but will have no memory and personality will be similar to Jason's.  This will take a few months to play out and Michael will wake up as a teenager.<br>  <br>  (\__/)<br>  (='.'=)<br>  (")-(")<br>  Sweetie|`|tgVGE2Umaa	It will work...eventually. Not right away because I don't believe that they have anyone cast to play the older more Jason-like Michael. But my guess would be sometime before summer.|`|VU7YIW5haa	I hope so. and I hope that he is not really old now.

Ow3O7h4caa	I love your persistence :-)<br>  <br>  By basing youself on 1000 chart, that would give a pretty good insight as to the frequeny of certain planets having a marked influence. And if you indicate a second and third prominence in your research, that would be nice even if the third prominence would be only 90% accurate. <br>  Having said this, the periods in a life, when the individual is likely to experience a specific event, condition or disease toward which he or she has a predisposition are indicated by certain major pogressed aspects. That is often used to determine any disposition.<br>  A person is not born bi-sexual, gay or whatever but rather, it is a developed constant and this explains my answer as to progressed asepcts.<br>  One other interesting point. I agree that you do not HAVE to be an astrologer or belong in any association to validate a theory or make a point.|`|32P3hG0Laa	OK... This is interesting to a degree... but I would imagine the best you could do would be to isolate "unusual sexuality" or perhaps in homosexuals of earlier generations, "hidden love."<br>  <br>  So where do you anticipate publishing this? I am curious to read your theories and examples.<br>  <br>  Also, do you have any professional status? Are you a member of the AFA or the NCGR?|`|nwdwKnS7aa	So what exactly do they have in common?|`|qNKK4hLDaa	wow!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!|`|635890b7eaf69137233c1c37ceeecf6caa	I'd say A million more.|`|531f08d2bae7afb19dbace61520eb62caa	Well it looks like you will be one of the most famous person in history for the century. Congratulations. Any chance that you will tell us how? Does it work for both male and female homosexuals?<br>  <br>  Publish the results so others can confirm the data. Go into detail which people you researched and what are the controls. That is what scientists do because to be factual it must be repeatable by anyone. You may have to have a larger sampling. Also do they all have to be "famous" homosexual people?<br>  <br>   When others do verify this, then you can claim the million dollar Randi prize. For being the first person in the world to prove astrology. Fame is right around the corner.|`|SlhdAZzpaa	wat are the aspects?<br>  can u tell me the signs? and the signs in each planet plz?|`|sVDW5mVUaa	attention whore|`|SxaSQFZGaa	36 more.|`|3VKiFmMJaa	Tell us!!!! Pretty please|`|GEobi7EAaa	tell us? :( please! :)|`|EuwjIJ3Zaa	In all honesty, you should post this in the Psychology section.  They might be able to give you more concrete examples for how studies on people should be properly conducted.<br>  <br>  Also, the best way to approach astrology, is not in this aspect or that aspect, and what specifically this one aspect represents, for the entirety of an individuals life.  To interpret astrology, which in essence would be the psychological make-up of an individual, it's extremely unhealthy to attempt to 'prove' anything.  This is not only dangerous to the astrologer perspective, but also to the person who is receiving the interpretation.  It heightens the chances of transference, it minimizes a holistic approach, which should be bountifully maximized, at every opportunity.<br>  <br>  To focus on what can be proven alone, is largely underestimating astrology, and it also speaks towards to a serious underlying, if only unconscious and hidden tendency, towards whacked out binary oppositions in a persons point of view. <br>  <br>  To assume that it's any simpler than that, is a huge mistake.|`|cuIX13BKaa	I find it interesting that you have found a thread...but before bragging rights ask your self this ONE question...."Am I right about myself....to those around me & is my attention in the right place?" ~ You can come up with a fair 100 just to prove a point. It seems that you want the glory of patenting what is right and what is not according to your method(s). If you strive for any number of this/these qualities look to where you are NOT right and then re-ask the question. Those whom you 'think' have been gay or have an alternative lifestyle might surprise you beyond whom we out hereon the other side of your question are may have the same qualities....so make it 1000 or over "IF" you can and I doubt that you can. You are making soup out of humanity....or trying. I too have seen threads' about this...and I do not doubt for a minute that you think that you are correct.....but be careful and be quick...you are not the only one and it seems that your humility could stand a challenge...so challenge yourself. Interesting question...are you trying to get someones attention here that you have not already managed to? Just stop talking and go do it. 64 is a fair enough beginning...but how many have you thus far been wrong about? Have you been absolute in your findings or is there reasonable doubt? You are looking to mandate a One Size Fits All ~ And yes you are using Magi Astrology but I think that you are terribly insecure or sour to even think of asking this question so soon into your studies on this...What I want to know is "Why on earth an alternative lifestyle" matters so much to you.....I hope for your sake that you are, if you are that gifted, also trying several other theories simultaneously...so as to give yourself perspective or you will be consumed by this and will miss something. By the way are YOU one of the 1000 people you are speaking of.....what was this born of? And what is your definition of 'Famous'. So many questions to be asked here.....I have brought up MY thoughts on this...yes I find it incredibly interesting...but not so quickly that if you cannot yet share it...that i will bother any more than with this column and in and of it my own thoughts. You are arrogantly asking for a stat....you claim to KNOW stats. Answer your own question.<br>  While you are at it do the math on Monogamy, Love and Attraction. I do NOT mean to be coarse with you, you want a realistic answer...well honey here it is.<br>  <br>  Garbo<br>  <br>  BTW~ Magi Astrology does NOT deal with the time of birth...so I REALLY wonder how you are basing this. It is a whole different kind of coordinating....so with that being said....just go and do it.<br>  <br>  Edit: You won't give up on it...you will simply stop talking about it.

uLZMNIYQaa	I second Megan's answer. I ADORED the movie. I adore Keira, adore period films, and the wardrobe of that time. I've actually found an ebay seller who will make replicas of the dresses... but she asks anywhere from $500 to $800! As badly as I want one, I'd have nowhere to wear it and wouldn't be prepared to spend that kind of money on a dress. But the details and fabric she uses are exquisite... just marvelous. Definitely worth the money you'd pay for them, I'm sure! Left a link to her below for those interested.|`|p5ZJfiIaaa	I love period pieces, and I LOVE Keira, so the movie was good by me :)<br>  Definitely on the sad side though...

oRaYQNXxaa	I think that having 4 judges is a bit to much. But I really think that Kara could easily take Paula's place. But Paula is funny to watch, so I doubt they'll be getting rid of her anytime soon. <br>  I think Kara is a better judge and has more to offer the contestants. She has more experience and knowledge under her belt and knows more of what she's talking about. Kara actually gives good advice. Rather than Paula talking about the moon and stars and how "they complete her" lol. <br>  Paula is just a hot mess! LOL. <br>  But yea I am getting annoyed at how long it takes now just to hear all of their opinions. Say what you gotta say and shut up! <br>  If you want TV time go somewhere else please Drunken Hines!|`|CNRPR22Oaa	Kick off the two girls. Kara spent about five years summing up the performances on last night's show, and Paula's crazy ramblings really make me want to cringe.|`|Xbgd5h8zaa	probably Paula should be substituted with Kara. WAY QUICKER SHOW!!!!!!!!!!!!!|`|BSvbYLi7aa	Paula looks like a monkey. (no offense...)|`|AA10050051	Paula wants to be the only female on that show that centers around both Randy and Simon. But, with Kara there, she makes Paula sound just as intelligible as ever before. There are people out there who thinks that Paula has something mental going wrong with her and that she really does need help. And I agree with the rest of the people out there who thinks she babbles on and on about stupid things that makes no sense what so ever. At least with Kara, she tells the performers exactly what there problems are and what needs work. So, I think Paula needs to keep quiet or else they are going to send her packing and keep Kara.|`|e7UOFx1faa	totally agree and what make it take so long i they have some many commericals and unnecessary stuff

Mentos first appeared as a liquorice-flavored candy which can still be purchased in the Netherlands as "Drop Mentos." New flavors were initially test-marketed in the Netherlands and throughout Europe, but more recently, most flavors are available worldwide.<br>  <br>  Mentos BoxesOther flavors include green apple, cinnamon, strawberry, mixed fruit (which contains a mix of cherry, strawberry, orange, and lemon flavors), grape, wintergreen, raisin, grapefruit, peach, plum (or ume), spearmint, strawberry yogurt, lemon yogurt, pineapple (pine fresh), red apple, wild fruit mix, cherry, watermelon, fresh cola, cassis (blackcurrant), red orange, currant and two versions of black licorice flavored Mentos.<br>  <br>  LOVES IT!!!

LoKJBLF1aa	It is sick and wrong.If you already earn alot of money and are in the public eye,you should not be doing commercials for even more money.Jesus, how much money do  these people need? You are off the artistic roll-call, and become no more than a corporate WHORE, a greed-head who has lost your soul to be fcked up the a.s.s by big business.Commercials should be given to young, starting-out actors to get their careers going, but after they acheive fame and wealth from their profession, they should not do another one.Ever.People I used to think were moderately cool, or at least had a social concience, like george clooney or urma thurman, have done commercials for huge fees, and have become nothing more than poodle bitches for big business.So now you can tell who is a corporate ***** and who is not - watch the ads!

You said she had a huge crush on you and one day of you looking bad due to lack of sleep won't change that.

AA10515207	I'm so paranoid I don't even tell my family what story I'm working on. Heck, even in therapy I'm afraid to voice my thoughts on what's wrong w/ me because I'm afraid will use that w/ another patient of his.<br>  <br>  Sorry about your Mom. I'd have a hard time not telling that woman off. Maybe your Mom could read that book & give an entirely different slant to it. She could do it in 3 "voices"--the leader of the kids, the shyest or youngest one, & the "rebel" who learns to work w/ others & not put himself first. Maybe she could write it for a different age group. It could also be from an adult's POV (parent) & that person's child. Sorry--unsolicited advice.

Don't know if you'll like it or not.<br>  <br>  I once took a bus trip that was hours long. I don't remember exactly how long it was, but it  was l - o - n - g.  In addition to music, I had a couple of books on audio that I listened to during the trip. It helped pass the time.<br>  <br>  I would get tired of listening only to  music all that time, but then, I'm not a teenager. I think books might add a little variety to the hours of travel.

jbQOC5kJaa	From her teens she was given drugs to control her weight (probably amphemines), consequently drugs to help her sleep.<br>  All can be addictive as is alcohol.<br>  <br>  To keep up with the frantic pace of making one movie after another, Garland, Rooney, and other young performers were constantly given amphetamines, as well as barbiturates, to take before bedtime (reference: "Judy Garland: By Myself" in the American Masters series on PBS). For Garland, this constant dose of drugs would lead to addiction and a lifelong struggle, as well as her eventual demise. In her later life, she would resent the hectic work and she felt that her youth was stolen from her by MGM. She was plagued with self-doubt throughout her life and needed constant reassurance that she was talented, despite her ability to fill concert halls worldwide with fans eager to hear her, high critical praise, and several awards.|`|jipqICzVaa	Insecurity, drugs, people taking advantage of her. The necessity to work punishing hours. Who said stardom was easy.<br>  <br>  <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Judy_Garland" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Judy_Garlan...</a>|`|3A0R0jz7aa	At least through her eyes (which is all that should really matter), she was not depressed or miserable. She was actually very optimistic, despite the trauma that she had to endure. She never thought of herself as a tragedy and was always very thankful for what she had.|`|fgbZugDlaa	She peaked at a young age and then her career dwindled down after peaking.  A long list of film executives critiqued her looks and weight, convincing her she was ugly.  She then didn't find as much work, but her success forced her to live a lavish lifestyle.  She soon became in serious debt while battling drug addictions.<br>  <br>  That is depressing.  It happens to a lot of actors and actresses who peak and then have nothing to do, so they try and retain their fame by partying like they are still famous.<br>  <br>  It is sad.|`|akUVg7CEaa	Who can really say why a person becomes depressed.  The stresses of her work probably helped, but it may just have been genetics.|`|zEoRcL91aa	She sang for a long time afterwards. I cannot understand. She had a lovely daughter and had a chance to work in film. Not everyone has the chance she had.|`|0f0787dc56665a4dff2f8ce6033c5254aa	Because of her wobbly vibrato. This question is in the wrong category.
1C123Xdsaa	Yes, the UK is watching the same episodes of LOST. LOST is aired in the US on Wednesdays, and the same episode is shown in the UK 4 days later.|`|198642e2b6a641fb943c1346409924d9aa	We're all watching the same show but being British is a big advantage to solving it.<br>  <br>  There's a big English connection that connects most of the backstories and events on the island. Its unlikely other nationalities including Americans will have enough British knowledge to notice it.<br>  <br>  You can find it in the numbers too. Solve the rest of the numbers and you solve Lost - you quickly realise you're right as there is a teasing metaphor for the solution somewhere on the island.|`|SSlz82Djaa	I believe that Handsome was making an observation that because we are British, we are inherently more intelligent than our American cousins and are therefore more capable of following the complicated and intricate storyline(s) that make up the show, Lost.<br>  <br>  If that is not the case, then apologies Handsome if I have misinterpreted your answer.
PMGXddjgaa	I think if Talula is offering a good meal.. then you should pay to eat xxx|`|BBVfRheyaa	agreed.|`|wW6NJk4jaa	lol actually I think it should, it's happening either way, and what's the difference between prostitution and porn?|`|FZ1dy9uCaa	Lissa, the difference is at least watching porn you cant get diseases haha :)<br>  <br>  Yeah, I could care less. I dont pick up prostitutes anyways|`|TeJuytjZaa	Yes.<br>  There will be prostitutes either way-legal or not. And anyway, people should be allowed to earn money whatever way they want. And it has nothing to do with me. So, why not?|`|433165e2c7b432dcd07898d64f6f19c8aa	Probably wouldn't be such a taboo if it was legalised, but still have reservations..|`|AA10140520	adults only with a "hooker licence"?-lol|`|UnqAjpVOaa	It might as well be, legal or not people are still going to sell their bodies. I suppose it's good that it's illegal because of how dangerous it is (STI's, Attacks, perverts, murders etc...) but then again some prostitutes are normal women who struggle to get a job and need to make a living to support themselves and sometimes to support their children. In a weird way, some prostitutes are doing it for the right reasons, even though they are aware of all the dangers; I take my hat off to them :)|`|Y8OKGMkwaa	Nah, just let it be the way it is..people are already paying for some. your daughter might end up being a prostitute if that happens, let alone you...prostition should be illegal. but if you want some, i can easily hook you up to a joint of hussy sisters...lol|`|gQudMMTXaa	It is legal here in Australia and i see no problem with that at all, each to there own and they probably have more money then me :)|`|EmUMa0f8aa	No Prostitution should not be legal because it it a sin. That why people get STD most of the time if they continue in sin|`|h4upp71daa	yeah, though not an eager person myself it would ravage the industry of pimps, STIs, and criminal conspiracy.

IddUYNR3aa	I think most of the work-at-home schemes widely advertised are a good example of "If it sounds too good to be true, it probably is."<br>  That includes the craft schemes where you buy the kits and then have to find your own buyers, etc.|`|VwpQTUBQaa	All mailing jobs are scams, If you don't like it don't do it.|`|Wi9nmYIEaa	absolutly.....and no job should cost you any start up fees of any kind.....it should be law.....they want workers....that is the company's responsibility  :  )|`|69aae2afc5ec35c06042c874dc59e82faa	I find people who are susceptible to such simple ploys, sad.<br>  Why would you even pay someone who claims to be giving you a job, shouldn't it be the other way around?
akcGfgdcaa	Disney has dropped Narnia. I think the main reason was because of the profit margins etc:<br>  <br>  The Lion, The Witch, and The Wardrobe cost $180m to make and made them $739m.<br>  <br>  Prince Caspian cost them $200m to make but only made $419, which was a pretty big drop from the first film.<br>  <br>  But don't worry, FOX has picked up the rights to the third movie: Voyage of The Dawn Treader, and it should be releasedin 2010.

Even just on a nice shopping trip?<br>  <br>  For my 12th birthday, I had three friends stay over and we watched films, played Twister and stayed up all night confessing our dirty stories.|`|vnWBhgcFaa	no way. i went bowling with a bunch of friends on my 12th|`|A1lVrI8Yaa	Your never to old for a birthday party.

fKcr6KU0aa	Where is D.Gray-man on your list.  Did I miss it?  If not, check that one out, definitely.  <br>  <br>  Also:<br>  Soul Eater<br>  Tenjho Tenge<br>  Trinity Blood<br>  Peacemaker Kurogane<br>  Shounen Onmyouji<br>  Tales of the Abyss<br>  Tsubasa: RESERVoir CHRONiCLE<br>  <br>  It doesn't have fantasy/supernatural, and does have guns, but Monster.  That's the one that people always recommend when someone wants an anime like Death Note, BTW.  It's brilliant.<br>  <br>  Saiyuki also involves guns, but you may like it anyway.  It's an anime version of "Journey to the West."<br>  <br>  Fafner in the Azure (Soukyuu no Fafner) is mecha anime, but is really good.  (I say this as someone who doesn't usually like mecha anime.)  It also has supernatural elements.<br>  <br>  Seconding Get Backers and Rurouni Kenshin.<br>  <br>  ...you might like Hikaru no Go.  It's...the most actiony non-action anime I've seen.  How an anime about a board game can be that intense, I don't know.  Also involves the supernatural...one of the main characters is a ghost.  The artist is the same one who did Death Note, though the author is different.<br>  <br>  I'd rec you Katekyo Hitman Reborn, but that one DEFINITELY has guns.  It's about the mafia.  Also, not such a good plot till further in.|`|HMFklJMHaa	NINJA SKROLL see you dont have it on ur list a lil older than the recent stuff but very good story|`|QWhrxorIaa	higurashi no naku koro ni?|`|sS352szAaa	Get Backers<br>  Ragnarok<br>  Shura no Toki<br>  Rurouni Kenshin<br>  The Slayers<br>  Basilisk<br>  Berserk<br>  Bastard!<br>  Akira<br>  Ninja Scroll<br>  Vampire Hunter D|`|bl8co4hUaa	Try these:<br>  <br>  Mirage of Blaze (2002, series)<br>  High schoolers Takaya and Yuzuru are best friends who share an extraordinary bond: They're conduits for ancient psychic powers. Street-savvy Takaya is always on the lookout for Yuzuru, but even he can't single-handedly stop the war they've inherited from Japan's chaotic Warring States Period. The two friends must band together with others like themselves to battle the clutches of long-dead spirits that have begun to re-enter the living world.<br>  <br>  Descendants of Darkness (series, 2001)<br>  Despite the fact that he's no longer alive, supernatural detective Asato Tsuzuki has an important job to do: making sure that the rest of the dead stay that way. In this collection of episodes from the popular animated series based on the manga by Yoko Matsushita, Tsuzuki goes up against the toughest case of his career armed only with his own set of skills and the help of his inexperienced new partner, Hisoka Kurosaki. <br>  <br>  Kyo Kara Maoh: God Save Our King (series 2005, and there's a part 2 series)<br>  In this deft anime blend of comedy and fantasy, nerdy teen Yuri Shibuya stands up for a schoolmate, only to be flushed down the commode by a group of bullies and sucked into a bizarre world inhabited by warring demons and humans. Next thing you know, a shocked Yuri finds himself crowned king of the Demon World. Trouble is, his pacifist disposition is at odds with his subjects' quarrelsome temperaments. …

FX2gTnORaa	Today it is Closer NIne Inch Nails Idk singer and the song is about freaky sex I think lol and it is alternative/grunge|`|mH8UscHdaa	My favorite song is My Friends Over You by New Found Glory. <br>  <br>  It's about how a girl breaks a guys heart and she acts really fake trying to get him back. It's basically he would choose his friends over the girl. <br>  <br>  It's Rock/Punk<br>  <br>  The reason I like this song so much is that it was the first song I heard by the group. I've been hooked since. It's the kind of song I could sit around at home and just play till my speakers blow out.<br>  <br>  Great Question and your welcome.|`|YcWGDKvkaa	I have 3 (but they are only my favorite song at the moment)<br>  <br>  1. "Iris"=by the Goo Goo Dolls, it tells the story of how the singer's passion is incredibly intense for something he cannot be with, but he just wants her to know who he is.<br>  <br>  2. "Angels" by Robbie Williams, it tells how you can easily fall in love with someone who watches over you with love and affection whether your right or wrong, and when you think that love is dead...you're loving angels instead. (it's wonderful!)<br>  <br>  3. Fix you by Coldplay. It's definitely mellow and it talks about how a life can be unfair at times but there's always going to be someone who will not make the pain completely go away but will try their best to fix you...<br>  <br>  Hope you like it!!! and hopefully you can tell me your favorite song!|`|kDSSW82eaa	Friends by Stephanie. It's a japanese song but the meaning is so deep and touching. It's sort of rock but still good. It tells about being friends forever even though your miles apart and i dedicate it to all my friends.

It's basically Eric Clapton's song for his past wife after they separated. I chose it because it tells us how we can never get over someone after we've loved them no matter how much we try. <br>  <br>  Old love just never dies.<br>  <br>  Our hearts break and fall, but we just never really learn from all that pain.

Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince | 100 % Favourite ( After watching trailer )|`|qlVQ8GxHaa	Hary Potter and the Order of the Pheonix.<br>  LOVED it!<br>  but for book the Deathly Hallows is my favorite.<br>  for the movie they have to cut the book into 2 parts!<br>  ugh!<br>  I cant wait for the Half-Blood Prince to come out|`|axytiZkhaa	The chamber of secrets and the goblet of fire were the best so far<br>  I loved the 5th book but the movie wasn't just good enough the cut too many parts|`|c7b5a51f903147f207464d68a3155e5baa	Goblet of Fire|`|21Lnhdfeaa	I loved Sorcerer's stone and Chamber of Secrets.  I was less impressed with Prisoner of Azkaban, I absolutely hated Goblet of Fire (it was also my least favorite of the books, so that could have something to do with it).  Order of the Pheonix began to restore my faith in the translations from book to movie.|`|PYKlBVmAaa	The Order of Phoenix hands down.|`|09fdLaeIaa	i loved The Prisoner of Azkaban<br>  and The Order of the Phoenix|`|kaZZRrlsaa	ALL OF THEM but if i had to pick the 5th and 4th and the 1th (it's so awsome)|`|1ZW2rzkYaa	GOF|`|klzmFfjZaa	Goblet of Fire
SMrG7A9laa	I would have to say Andy Baldwin or Andrew Firestone. They are true gentlemen and when they broke up with their fiancees, they DIDNT do it on national television. Jason should be voted worst bachelor of the series history, not Brad Womack.|`|0fygxRHLaa	who watches that show?|`|szwFTvNaaa	None shows booring and set up.|`|e4ZxaNxKaa	it USED to be jason|`|ltJn1y0uaa	Ugh, i hated all of them. The girls were really sweet though. But did you hear that one bachelor cheated on that one girl! I saw it on access hollywood. It sickens me.|`|d721a0a7c3aab6382c7b8b60122b1763aa	Mine was Brad Womack.....I still think he should have picked DeAnna|`|5TNDDsFzaa	umm the first guy|`|AA12390047	Oh, that's easy.  Andrew Firestone was my fave and then Matt.  Loved both of them.|`|RNi6gytSaa	Andy :)
WJW4qOlUaa	I am thinking someone will have some really bad news to share with there class mates! Not sure who it will be though.<br>  Gosh I love that show! They still have the drama even after 20 years.

kJiwGPCPaa	They haven't decided weather they will put Breaking Dawn in production. if they do they think it will be split into two movies cos its so long...|`|rSq790ksaa	Don't listen to everybody else.<br>  <br>  Kristen Stewart confirmed they're making Breaking Dawn. If New Moon and Eclipse do well in the theatres they will definitley make it into a movie as well. They didn't buy the rights for it yet but that doesn't mean they never will. Technology is not the issue. The only person that said technology was an issue was Stephenie Meyer, she is not a filmmaker, she doesn't know.|`|7NnBhdNEaa	yeaa eventually|`|klzmFfjZaa	I damn well hope so!! Me and my mum were debating over that last night...again!<br>  I know people are saying it would be possible with Reneesme, but, really, I don't see how. I know we have so much computing on movies these days but it still would be hard. Unless they started making it now and released it in about 5 years, with the actress playing Reneesme growing a lot, I don't see how they could do it. I do really hope so. And how many people would they need for the Volturi thing at the end!!!! And the length of the book!!! They would have to either make it like, I don't know, a 5 hour movie to fit it all in. Unless it was two movies as one book.<br>  <br>  <br>  I know I'm being a downer but I really do hope they make it a movie!!!!|`|Yh7GOkZHaa	There is a lot of different rumors going around, but stephanie meyer said that it would be hard to do renesemee and it would have to R-rated, but its hard to say. We'll have to wait for New Moon and Eclipse first.|`|4593057a35a6cd4bd6202267b788e26eaa	They will make another movie with new moon and eclipse mashed together...it's gonna be even worse then the original movie =___=''|`|FXPglziDaa	Hey yall, Its Miley.<br>  Yes there is going to be a Breaking Dawn movie. I know because my daddy is friends with the director and I might be starring as one of Bella's friends in Eclipse!|`|X0BrFsfSaa	yea probably i mean twilight is already a movie new moon trailer is on youtube....so i mean if its making money they are going to make more|`|Wa44n8RCaa	I don't see it happenig becuase of all teh visual stuff like all those hot guys goin in the nud and bella giving birth|`|CmPvZ6Ucaa	people are debating because of renesme but because of our technology becoming better i don't see why they wont|`|TXToyWXJaa	It's not confirmed yet but New Moon and Eclipse are . . . so I guess.|`|wyieWcBfaa	Yes, all of the twilight books are being made into movies.|`|mbgBFjKOaa	Uh, let's wait for the other two first?

pEVLqUm8aa	It really depends on the the people working at the theater. She may have to buy a ticket for herself and walk you in. Make SURE you keep the ticket stubs though. If you get in the theater workers love to walk into R movies to bust kids. All you need to do is show them your stub and you're set. If they start asking questions tell them your mom is in the bathroom OR you can sit next to an adult. Good Luck!|`|cAyMzxXfaa	They can buy the tickets but the law requires them to stay with you through the entire movie. They don't always check in movie teaters though.|`|hdhZHqV0aa	no..she has to go with you. the people wont let kids in unless they go in with a parent..but u could ask people who are going to the movie if u could pretend to be going with them..|`|nW0MpCogaa	only if she goes with you...|`|NtWslbpraa	No, because she is not all of your moms. You have to be blood related to the person who is 21+ buying the tickets. She cannot buy tickets for your friends if they are not her kids. It's against the law kiddo.|`|t4cesSHQaa	Only if she goes with you. She could purchase a ticket and walk in, then you could simply go into the theater and let her leave. She'll have to pay extra just for that, though.|`|ARTqP2w6aa	R is adults only but if the ticket collector doesn't check ID then you can get in|`|OEB6GcmBaa	yeah i think you can|`|nqhZ0Elraa	Yeahh<br>  I do that all the timee|`|JGj8TN2saa	yeah|`|zod8Ehd9aa	yepp|`|BILIAKSOaa	Yeah, all you need is for her to buy the tickets and give you permission to see the movie.

Inhale, then start singing. Easy. Practice, practice, and more practice. It would help if you learnt an instrument. That will help with correcting your pitch and tone. You dont want to be tone deaf do you...<br>  <br>  Then you go to some studio, record a demo, distribute it to some amateur radio station. Work your way up. Also gain recognition on stage. And through competitions. Hire an agent as well.|`|45ZcITSyaa	You could also audition for shows such as x factor :-)<br>  And if you are really good but still dont win you will be noticed and maybe giving a record label<br>  <br>  Good Luck And Practice :-D <br>  x

And also, with Orichimaru (one of the three legendary Sannin), he was also trained and he was given the cursed seal, which gives more chakra to the user.|`|Jn8St19vaa	Its obvious he got so fast, he copied Lee's movements, plus Kakashi's training and Orochimaru's curse mark, why wouldn't he get so fast?!|`|7EdDelD7aa	bcause he is incredible|`|INioiAJTaa	Kakashi explained it as him using the sharingan to mimic Lee's moves and put Sasuke through extreme training in order to reach a sufficient speed to use the Chidori, though Sasuke managed to gain extreme speed, its still not up to Lee's speed and his stamina is nowhere near Lee's and he cant maintaine the speed for very long. Hoped that helped.|`|BrUNUMNiaa	Correct me if I'm wrong, but Sasuke never fought against Lee during the Chuunin exams.... When Lee took off his hidden weights, he was fighting against Gaara, so actually we won't know whether Sasuke can follow Lee's speed or not. That is, if I remember correctly. : )|`|ckeBvt23aa	They rubbed cooking grease on him and said "#$@% look at that bacon sizzle" lol...........no Sasuke was fast to begin with but you have to remember he learns techniques and such at a very fast rate so even if he doesn't use his sharingan on things he does learn at an exceptional speed.|`|HV0cFX5saa	I think just because Sasuke is a genius, and the author wants to show us how serious he is<br>  So, it's reasonable to explain why Sasuke can defeat Orochimaru and may crush Konoha then.|`|f80f4fccfa6cfbf5720b905152d8cc81aa	I guess its because they marketed him as a 'tensai' or genius... <br>  <br>  Could probably think of his 'speed' as a reduction of time used to carry out each move... leading to an overall increase in speed...<br>  <br>  haha..|`|6PSnZDhDaa	Let me correct you... It doesn't say anywhere that Sharingan cannot copy speed... If it can copy Justus... like how Kakashi was able to perform the Jutsu at the same time as Zabuza... That was fast enough to perform at the same time... Or when Sasuke could keep up with Naruto's inhuman speed at the valley of end... after his Sharingan had three spirals... <br>    Also this may have something to do with the cursed seal, that enhances power... besides like others say.. Sasuke is a genius... <br>    besides i don't think he was as fast as Lee...|`|tL5vlITcaa	He's on coke.

I was never in love with him.  I loved him more like a brother.  I probably would have stayed married to him but he did somethings that pushed me away and out the door.  But if had stayed, I would have been settling.  And my ex deserved to find someone that truly loved him, as a man, not as a brother.  That taught me a huge lesson............never settle.  I felt terrible and had a lot of guilt to have messed with someone's heart and life like that.  I have never done it again.  That was 26 years ago, and now my ex is happily married to a wonderful woman that I can call a friend.  I wish them both nothing but the best!|`|77b89da50334d58ffae963702c00caaaaa	The last heart I knowingly broke was that of my current husband.  We were dating at the time.  He asked me if I loved him and I told him I didn't know.  The look on his face was like I had ripped his heart out, slapped it down on a cutting board and chopped it into tiny pieces with a clever while he watched.  I instantly felt like the most horrible person on the face of the planet.  But it did cause me to re-evaluate my feelings for him.  We have been insanely happily married for 13 years now.|`|1OgBUegUaa	It was a few years ago and I felt like complete ****...like a totally bad person but then someone made me realize everything doesn't work out.

3ijzNrkEaa	I found this on IMDB. <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  The violence Betsy was suffering was her reliving the rape. <br>  <br>  It was psychic phenomena, Betsy was causing it the whole time. She suppressed the rape, but the emotional trauma was so great that after the woman "cursed" them, her mind decided to take action to make her remember what had happened. <br>  <br>  We only use about 20% of our brain, so there are a lot of possibilities for what we could do if we were unable to unlock more of our mind. Psychic investigators often find that poltergeist activity occurs in a home with a child who is in some form of emotional turmoil. They believe that it's actually psychic manifestions of the child's emotions. <br>  <br>  Anyhow, that's what the whole business of "Remember" was in the movie, it was her mind finally opening up, the mother finally remembering odd instances, and Betsy deciding that her father had to die. <br>  <br>  Even the "ghost" in the last few scenes set in the present really could've been a psychic imprint, but were more likely the woman's mind hallucinating a ghost as she realizes what was going on with her daughter and her ex-husband. <br>  <br>  <br>  AND..about the ghost, It was said that it was herself at a younger ager when was still innocent before what he father did to her...

l23ttRePaa	Answer all america was searching for and makes perfect sense to me.<br>  <br>  If I had to pick one song, my softest spot, it would be "Blowing in the Wind." If you could imagine the March on Washington with Martin Luther King and singing that song in front of a quarter of a million people, black and white, who believed they could make America more generous and compassionate in a nonviolent way, you begin to know how incredible that belief was.<br>  <br>  And still is. To sing the line, "How many years can some people exist before they're allowed to be free?" in front of some crummy little building that refuses to admit Jews in 1983, the song elicits the same response now as it did then. It adresses the same questions. "How many deaths will it take till they know that too many people have died?" Sing that line in a prison yard where political prisoners from El Salvador are being kept. Or sing it with Bishop Tu Tu. <br>  <br>  You have to look at the whole song and possible answers to the various questions.<br>  <br>  READ THE LYRICS & DECIDE FOR YOURSELVES!<br>  <br>  Blowin' In The Wind<br>  How many roads must a man walk down<br>  Before you call him a man?<br>  Yes, 'n' how many seas must a white dove sail<br>  Before she sleeps in the sand?<br>  Yes, 'n' how many times must the cannon balls fly<br>  Before they're forever banned?<br>  The answer, my friend, is blowin' in the wind,<br>  The answer is blowin' in the wind.<br>  <br>  How many years can a mountain exist<br>  Before it's washed to the sea?<br>  Yes, 'n' how many years can some people exist<br>  Before they're allowed to be free?<br>  Yes, 'n' how many times can a man turn his head,<br>  Pretending he just doesn't see?<br>  The answer, my friend, is blowin' in the wind,<br>  The answer is blowin' in the wind.<br>  <br>  How many times must a man look up<br>  Before he can see the sky?<br>  Yes, 'n' how many ears must one man have<br>  Before he can hear people cry?<br>  Yes, 'n' how many deaths will it take till he knows<br>  That too many people have died?<br>  The answer, my friend, is blowin' in the wind,<br>  The answer is blowin' in the wind.|`|nTJQMzlHaa	I means that the answer is undefinable. Just like the wind, you can't grab the answer.|`|cToeqF0Daa	Love that song! Erm, not really sure, maybe he meant the answer is all around but you have to look out for it.|`|wlfOhnDoaa	I think its kind offf saying that the answer is like drifting round, like you're waiting to find the right answer, Lol x|`|c8lBbWtQaa	Nobody knows the answer you cant catch the wind or tie it down so you will never know|`|JmHBplRIaa	The answer is always moving and always changing?|`|rpOkkLtoaa	the answer is clear but no one is smart enough to see it. bob dylan rocks|`|bwjf8D31aa	means he farted|`|ft8t98Pnaa	I was just listening to this song....lol|`|WmyubCCjaa	i love bob dylan! <br>  ermmm, i guess he just means the answers there if you want to find it, like its not a mystery|`|nqkXE1cUaa	He is saying the answer is non-existent, or invisible like the wind.|`|EMYImof1aa	maybe that the answer is so obvious it's all around you in the wind, but idk i'm not a huge dylan fan|`|Y8rB9iuHaa	he means that the answer to the question is a matter of fate.  It could be found anywhere and from anybody.|`|mQwyWWHtaa	he wrote that because he wants you to ponder what the answer is...|`|ivjHOJ8daa	Well, when he wrote the song.. he was with his girlfriend right..<br>  And she said...<br>  "Bob, do you love me?"<br>  Bob looks at her, staring, deep in thought...<br>  he then leans towards her, gently..<br>  then lifts his leg and farts!!!<br>  Then replies with "The answer, my dear, is blowing in the wind"|`|dSkV8q7kaa	that weird because i am listening to that song atm! this song is about war, and bob dylans all into peace. he's saying the answer is as clear and obvious as the wind, and its right in front of us even though we can't see it... i think he means people need to stop fighting.|`|ygGr1nX7aa	Hard to say.  Bob Dylan was left-handed, which made wordplay harder for him.

797085541186c24819b4827d65d67f25aa	Daredevil, he always has his five senses very high, and few times he actually fought against spider-man, and spider-man though Dare-devil had some kind of "sixth sense", and always catches spider-man before he makes his move on Daredevil.<br>  <br>  Dare-devil can almost always dodge Spider-man's punches and his web unless Spider-man makes so many of it, Dare Devil can't scape (he usually cuts it up in pieces anyways).|`|0e7PIzPNaa	Daredevil, Popular Marvel Productions company's fictional character . Although blind, the character's remaining four senses function with high levels of superhuman accuracy and sensitivity, giving him abilities far beyond the limits of a sighted person. Daredevil can "see" by means of a type of "radar sense" that allows him to sense the proximity of people and objects around him. Daredevil's radar sense is connected with his hearing (thus it is technically a form of sonar, using sound rather than radio waves), as the bouncing of sounds and vibrations off his surroundings enable him to "see" what's happening around him. However, Daredevil's main weakness is his vulnerability to excessive sounds or powerful odors that can be used to incapacitate him or temporarily weaken the effectiveness of his radar sense [26] since his enhanced senses make him more susceptible to them than they would for a person with normal senses.<br>  <br>  Though he has no superhuman physical attributes, Daredevil has great natural strength, speed, stamina, agility, and reflexes, due to both extensive training and the heightened sense of balance his superhuman hearing affords him. He has shown himself to be a superb acrobat with abilities that are superior to those of an Olympic-level sighted gymnast. Daredevil's training by Stick has made him into a formidable hand-to-hand combatant. His typical moves are unique blends of the martial arts of Ninjutsu, Jujutsu, and Judo combined with American-style Boxing while making full use of his gymnastics capabilities.<br>  <br>  Daredevil's signature weapon is his specially-designed billy club, which he created. Disguised as a blind man's cane in civilian garb, it is a multi-purpose weapon and tool that contains thirty feet of aircraft control cable connected to a case-hardened steel grapnel. Internal mechanisms allow the cable to be neatly wound and unwound, while a powerful spring launches the grapnel. The handle can be straightened for use when throwing. The club can also be split into two parts, one of which is a fighting baton, the other of which ends in a curved hook.<br>  <br>  Some stories have depicted Daredevil's suit as being made of a metal mesh as well as being insulated.<br>  <br>  As Matt Murdock, Daredevil is a highly skilled criminal defense attorney with an extensive knowledge of the American legal system, even going so far as to defend some of his former adversaries in court.<br>  <br>  Spider-Man is also a fictional character owned by Marvel Productions. A bite from an irradiated spider causes a variety of changes in the body of Peter Parker, giving him superpowers.[29] In the original Lee-Ditko stories, Spider-Man has the ability to cling to walls, superhuman strength, a sixth sense ("spider-sense") that alerts him to danger, perfect balance and equilibrium, as well as superhuman speed and agility.[29] Brilliant, Parker excels in applied science, chemistry and physics. The character was originally conceived by Stan Lee and Steve Ditko as intellectually gifted, but not a genius. However, later writers have depicted the character as a genius.[30] With his talents, he sews his own costume to conceal his identity, and constructs many devices that complement his powers, most notably mechanical web-shooters.[29] (This mechanism ejects an advanced adhesive, releasing web-fluid in a variety of configurations, including a single rope-like strand to swing from, a net to bind enemies, a single strand for yanking opponents into objects, strands for whipping foreign objects at enemies, and a simple glob to foul machinery or blind an opponent. He can also weave the web material into simple forms like a shield, a spherical protection or hemispherical barrier, a club, or a hang-glider wing.) Other equipment include spider-tracers (spider-shaped adhesive homing beacons keyed to his own spider-sense), a light beacon which can either be used as a flashlight or project a "Spider-Signal" design, and a specially modified camera that can take pictures automatically.<br>  <br>  As we can see, if Daredevil vs. Spider-Man , Of course , Spider-Man will win . But they can make a good team. Marvel company has publish 4 comic books featuring Daredevil and Spider-Man combined together vs. thier arch enemies .|`|espnzi9Zaa	Daredevil no contest.|`|u9RwzLPnaa	They already had a fight and Daredevil beat the crap out of Spiderman.

HqyFyF8haa	Hmmm<br>  well the probability is kinda low. <br>  Since the damn creator said Lulu really did die.<br>  And if they make a series with him dead, what kind of show will that be?<br>  <br>  But I really wish there would be an R3 <br>  Because I love the show and the ending wasn't satisfying enough to me >.<<br>  <br>  But for all we know, there could be another season<br>  And Lulu might NOT be dead (oh for the sake of anime, please make him alive)<br>  Because if you notice in the show, a bunch of people "die" and then come back alive. And that could be the same with Lelouch's case.<br>  So we can either hope the creator is joking about him being dead or hope that he will change his mind, think of a way to make Lulu alive again, and make another freakin fantastic show. =]<br>  (Hint Hint: There is a chance Lelouch could have gained immortality)<br>  <br>  SO keep your fingers crossed for another season.

CLndtRtPaa	If it was in sharpie, go over it with the same color sharpie and immediately ironing over it. Do this 3 times and then just keep ironing. Wash so it won't shrink. Keep it clean. I'm guessing it's white, so buy a bleach pen for any stains. This is sacred to you, so treat it with respect. Be careful not to shrink it, because the sig. will get all demented. Be careful not to scorch with the iron. Have your wife or sister do it. Also, every 5 times or so that you wear it, reinforce the signature again. Good luck! It is especially important to keep clean also because you can eventually frame it.|`|Vbrn4GQNaa	dude dont wear it <br>  just buy another shirt keep that skirt wat ever u do no matter wat that signature will fase if it gets wet best way to keep it safe it to preserve it buy a frame and pput it in their or lik hange it on a hanger in the back of ur closet|`|aJB1OPoFaa	you can wash it as long as the pen was used is permanent I did try that once with a shirt and it turned out okey.|`|QQYq2BAyaa	i think the best thing to do is to dry clean it.|`|bwKZ8MWWaa	Frame it, never wear it again|`|6LdCn0YPaa	you don't wash it ... you buy a frame to preserve it!

QBiojYKIaa	i thought the movie was incredible. i read the book and going into the movie i was a little scared they would totally mess it up but they didn't, they stayed true to the book for the most part. i definitely recommend the movie to whoever has read the book. everyone that played the characters were amazing, i was really happy when i walked out of the theatre. it was pretty long, but it's worth it. the one thing i was really happy they showed was the comedian's past, the rape scene and the killing of the pregnant lady, i wasn't sure if they would show those parts because not everyone would be happy to see that, but they did and i'm happy they did cause it showed the deeper meaning to the messed up character to the comedian. long story short, go see the movie! :)|`|i6Th0lItaa	Yes.

7Lmdrxicaa	Don't know what it actually is about. The song is from their suite "A mind beside itself", which starts with the song "Erotomania", then "voices" and then "the silent man" in the end.<br>  The suit seems to deal with religion, and it roughly symbolises the word 'paranoia.<br>  <br>  "A God with no belivers", sounds a little meaningless, so maybe the song is about sadness or something like that. "suffocate their faith" sounds like their losing their faith.<br>  But it's just something I think the song might be about.<br>  <br>  If you like the silent man, I would recomend you to listen to their song "The spirit carries on" from their "metropolis part 2" album.<br>  It's a very nice song with acoustic guitar in. Have heard that some people have even used it in funerals.<br>  I think the lyrics on this song is easyer to understand :P<br>  <br>  The spirit carries on:<br>  <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W70LZxzp2js" rel="nofollow">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W70LZxzp2...</a><br>  <br>  You and your'e friend have really good taste in music!

In the past two years (as of 2005) Fall Out Boy has played almost 500 shows. On their first tour ever, with Spitalfield, in two weeks they had only played two shows. Patrick was accually a drummer for years. Fall Out Boy is the first band he ever sang for and he has never taken a vocal lesson. Fall Out Boy is the fourth band Pete and Andy have done together. The original cover for "Take This To Your Grave" was deemed to have too many copyright infringements and was only used on the vinyl. The original names also considered for Fall Out Boy were: Short Story, Unhappy Ending, and Forget Me Not. No auto-tune is used on the vocals on any of the Fall Out Boy records. Fall Out Boy's Biggest Fans facts:--------- Joe is obsessed with Starwars Andy is Veagan Pete's foavorite movie is The Nightmare Before Christmas-MINE TOO!!! Pete overdosed on a anti-depress pill Pete thinks he is ugly Pete almost died in a Wal-Mart parking lot Pete's naked pictures were stolen from his camera A teacher at Liberty High School named Mr. Bishup used to be a member of Fall Out Boy but they werent becomeing famous so he became a teacher (they still play together) The song "Where is your Boy Tonight?" used to be "Grand Theft Autum" Patrick's last name Stump use to have an "h" at the end of it but he changed it for the record deal Pete is the one who writes the music (get that through your head) Pete use to be a HUGE nerd Patrick IS a nerd (but we all love him) Pete likes Kanye West The reason Patrick wears glasses in real life and not when he plays is because their are 2 Patricks and the 2nd Patty has a 2 behind his left ear and thats why he always wears hats too...(hahaha) Pete made up that last fact Fall Out Boy dosent write a certian kind of music...they dont play "emo" music they play "Fall Out Boy" music Everyone complements Fall Out Boy even haters like my brother he said they "played good music" Pete is A Gorgeous Beast!<br>  Even tho Pete is bysexual.<br>  <br>  hope this helps!!<br>  x|`|mbgBFjKOaa	People of Britain?!

I wish I could help you with the Reba song, but the only mother-daughter song she sings that comes to mind is "Fancy," and I'm sure that's not it. <br>  <br>  But I'm posting a few other songs with lyrics (including one by Reba) that you might take a look at or listen to over the net.

InAICv25aa	You should definitely switch to the 4/4 size violin. The sound will be much better, and anyhow all the good higher-end violins are size 4/4, just in case you want to upgrade in the future.<br>  <br>  It will of course affect the way you play a little. You will probably need to rework your intonation because all the intervals between every note will have changed on your left hand. That isn't really horrible, though, and you should be able to get used to it pretty soon.|`|CjPtAEzmaa	It will actually make it much easier in the long run. It'll take a little getting used to, as the space between the notes will be a little bit larger. But just practice, and I'd say after maybe a week tops you'll be really glad you got it. :)|`|bP5r9KeQaa	As the fingerboard grows, the distance between notes will be bigger.<br>  <br>  But the sound of an 4/4 is better, more volume and less strident.|`|MXXycyYiaa	Naaaw You'll be fine! It's just a matter of getting used to the new size. Practice, and you'll be great!!|`|64R1DrtHaa	yes definitely, it will affect your playing - it will take some getting used to. You won't get worse.

2b5799147194d19d72182c8e2216fa41aa	This is a good riddle, and although some people have justified carrying the day plus two people because they are saying the dog isn't a person, I think in this riddle, because you state the dog can't drive that the dog is included and counted as one of two occupants that the boat can hold.

XBGaYJ2waa	It is somewhat different from the films, but I think it will still lead up to them.  Why?<br>  <br>  1. I don't think Lex is actually dead, I think it was probably a clone or something like in the 6th season finale when Lana supposedly "died"<br>  <br>  2. Michael Rosenbaum aka Lex Luthor said that he might guest star later in the show if he was allowed to wear a bald cap.<br>  <br>  Good question|`|NgL2Onqhaa	Yes and No.<br>  <br>  The Series is basically an 'alternate Universe' story arc as evidenced from the start by Ma and Pa both having full heads of colored hair, Pete being black, Lana reverting to Pre-crisis: object-of-lust status and the existence of Chloe (post- crisis Lana w/ a side of Lois). (which might have been considered simple ret-con), but with over 8 years worth of story committed to film (or at least script) certain angles and points have had to be amended causing Smallville to best be viewed as AU<br>  <br>  but Chris Reeve said in an interview when he started his guest arc as Dr. Swann, when asked about his feelings of Welling's work playing Clark,  That he viewed the series as an expansion of the time frame of the film in which Jeff East had played Clark, so that comparing his Clark to Welling's was essentially apples and oranges<br>  <br>  that was also 4 years back or so, so he had no idea the series would get approved for a 9th season

1204e9a4f0121ebac48e7d8f61d56242aa	If I understand correctly, your trumpet part is in the key of C (no sharps, no flats ?) - so to change the music to be played by the flute you would lower the key and notes one whole step to the key of Bb. The flute key signature would consist of 2 flats (Bb and Eb) and all the notes would be moved down 1 step (2 half steps) , so the trumpet note C would now be a Bb for the flute. Depending on the range of the trumpet part you might need to raise the flute part up an octave to a better range for the flute player.<br>  <br>  Musician, composer, teacher.|`|vsy4QMHMaa	The easiest of all transpositions.<br>  If the music is in the key of C for a Bb clarinet, it is in concert Bb.<br>  <br>  .... so everything gets transposed to Bb for (strings, flute, oboe, bassoon, chimes, harp & other concert C instruments.)|`|WdmUoCZIaa	it's easy.<br>  <br>  b flat major scale : Bb  C  D  Eb  F  G  A  Bb<br>  c major scale      : C    D  E   F   G  A  B  C<br>  <br>  write this on a piece of paper, when u want to transpose it, just look on this chart.<br>  <br>  Example :<br>  u want to transpose Bb D F<br>  <br>  see the letter under Bb D F(straight under it)?<br>  they are : C E G<br>  that's the keys that u should play, and it had been transposed to c major scale.

I am the biggest Harry Potter fanatic! However I enjoy the Twilight novels, and I really don't understand why everyone hated it so much? Some parts weren't exceptional (but lets be honest, the Twilight series' writing is no where near the Harry Potter series'!). The thing I dislike most about the Harry Potter movies is the changes and cuts they make while filming that differ from the novels, which are so much more in depth. I was actually pleasantly surprised that the Twilight movie was so close to the book. Very much so, and I think because of this I liked it 10x more than I expected to! Most movies don't do books justice ever, but I was satisfied with Twilight, and even though the Harry Potter books are so much more well done, I greatly appreciate and enjoy *very* much watching everything from the novels come to life on screen in the Harry Potter movies!|`|0fviV0lNaa	Harry Potter and the Half Blood Prince|`|3Nr9o9UDaa	NEW MOON ALL DA WAY!!!|`|p5ZJfiIaaa	Definitely Harry Potter. I love the series, and even though the movies usually disappoint me, I still get all giggly and excited when I see the trailer....I'm 23...<br>  <br>  As for New Moon... well, I'll probably wait to rent it. I have read the books and enjoyed them, but the movie was NOT good. So I'll rent from now on.|`|EilAm0Dkaa	Both :D<br>  <br>  But harry potter more :]<br>  <br>  I need another harry potter fix!|`|yeuvDa0Yaa	I am looking forward to seeing both...but I am more excited to see New Moon.|`|WyGp1Wmnaa	i hated twilight!!!<br>  and probablly will hate new moon too<br>  <br>  im a loyal hp fan so.......<br>  <br>  Harry Potter And The Half Blood Prince BABY!!!!!!!!!!|`|c20c4d84460a49d05f43e645019ad43eaa	New Moon, however, I LOVE Harry!|`|LXkGS7Q5aa	I want 2 see new moon......I CANT WAIT!|`|GQD3TLmGaa	NEW MOON BABY!!!!!

jU0dGPzUaa	When an artist announces tour dates, the tickets don't usually come out right away. Usually about a week later, they come out.<br>  If you want to figure out exactly what day and time tickets go on sale, go to www.ticketmaster.com and then type in your artist. It will usually tell you the tour dates and what day and time they go on sale. I hope I helped!<br>  That's what I did when I wanted to see Celtic Thunder, and I bought front row seats! I can't wait to go March 22nd! (:|`|oe5eNuH1aa	Tour dates are when they announce where the artist(s) will go. For example, the Jonas Brothers are releasing their tour ates, like where they will play at! Check Ticketmaster or the artists Youtube or something like that! They should announce when they go on sale.|`|M9EcpbmDaa	i think i know who you mean to :)<br>  and clever for not saying really cos now you get proper answers haha<br>  but normally you get some notice, when i bought tickets for them it was 1 day notice i think?<br>  and because this is a world tour it will give notice im sure! (i think the band you think i think is the one i think..LOL that made no sense!)  :]|`|MgOzpSs6aa	I Dont think so, maybe the first few city's they will be playing concerts at will have the tickets on sale...did that make any sense whatsoever? lol.

Hope they come to chicago!|`|WUVGFINnaa	go to ticketmaster.com<br>  than search for your show|`|BC0oVruEaa	they usually come out like one week later?<br>  are u talking about the jonas brothers world tour? lol.

CvtDsOB4aa	Yes I Love That Poem|`|GBSnBbWiaa	ya|`|2LpWgU20aa	the first time i read it i thought it was supposed to be a joke, not something serious, so i would tell it to people thinking it was a joke/riddle. until someone finnaly told me its not supposed to be that way!! haha, but its a clever little poem.<br>  <br>  Its this poem, right? <br>  <br>  One night a man had a dream. He dreamed He was walking along the beach with the LORD. Across the sky flashed scenes from His life. For each scene He noticed two sets of footprints in the sand. One belonging to Him and the other to the LORD.<br>  <br>  When the last scene of His life flashed before Him, he looked back at the footprints in the sand. He noticed that many times along the path of His life there was only one set of footprints. He also noticed that it happened at the very lowest and saddest times of His life.<br>  <br>  This really bothered Him and He questioned the LORD about it. LORD you said that once I decided to follow you, you'd walk with me all the way. But I have noticed that during the most troublesome times in my life there is only one set of footprints. I don't understand why when I needed you most you would leave me.<br>  <br>  The LORD replied, my precious, precious child, I Love you and I would never leave you! During your times of trial and suffering when you see only one set of footprints, it was then that I carried you.|`|1hiImyBdaa	Yes.My favourite poem.<br>  <br>  One night I dreamed I was walking along the beach with the Lord.Many scenes from my life flashed across the sky.<br>  <br>  In each scene I noticed footprints in the sand.Sometimes there were two sets of footprints,other times there was one only.<br>  <br>  This bothered me because I noticed that during the low periods of my life,when I was suffering from anguish,sorrow or defeat,I could see only one set of footprints,so I said to the Lord,<br>  <br>  “You promised me Lord,that if I followed you,you would walk with me always.But I have noticed that during the most trying periods of my life there has only been one set of footprints in the sand.Why,when I needed you most,have you not been there for me?”<br>  <br>  The Lord replied, “The years when you have seen only one set of footprints,my child, is when I carried you.”<br>  <br>  In my most difficult times,when my heart is filled with sadness & despair,God is always there for me!|`|6pk6HnuSaa	yes it is - but the satires of it are really funny ?|`|DNadX5Vgaa	I agree with read my lips, i definatly wish Jesus wrote it!|`|8iHbDmHmaa	It is very nice, and I'm not religious.<br>  <br>  ADD: Just because someone doesn't believe in God doesn't mean they are rude and negative.  I've met plenty of religious people that are rude and negative.<br>  <br>  You don't have to be religious to be inspired by spiritual things.|`|s7UWLOS9aa	Sure. Never heard of it.|`|COEMM8eVaa	Everyone has their own opinion.|`|N1eWhoFJaa	Yeah.<br>  It's also my mom's favorite poem :)|`|G6JXHvZKaa	put it in writing i like to read it really  and guess what im no atheist!!!!|`|wsF1bXL3aa	keep the faith whatever the answers say.|`|T6WYXtdfaa	It is quite beautiful. I just wish Jesus actually wrote it.|`|oMj8WAHFaa	yes that poem inspires me, it also touches me.|`|xNOh4KIUaa	yes, i actually think it is. <br>  i read it for the mothers day tea at my school when i was in grade 3 and i still remember standing on a stool because i was tiny and reading it to 30 mothers including my own and a bunch of them teared up. <br>  i still have a bookmark with the poem on it.|`|GB4oQCtQaa	One night I dreamed of walking along the shores of different lands.<br>  I could tell that You were with me by the footprints in the sand.<br>  As I gazed upon the heavens, I saw pages of my life.<br>  It was then I realized that You remained there by my side.<br>  When the clouds began to gather and the rains came falling down,<br>  I looked to only find one set of footprints on the ground.<br>  I said, "Lord, why did You leave me in the troubled times of life?<br>  I believed that You would always walk beside me day and night." (Then I heard:)<br>  "My precious child, I'd never leave you.<br>  I have carved you on the hollow of My hand.<br>  It's then I carried you in My arms,<br>  When you see one set of footprints in the sand"<br>  Dear Lord, will You be with me as I travel through the years?<br>  Will You be there in the struggles? Will You wipe away the tears?<br>  As my eyes turn toward the ocean and the shores of distant lands,<br>  I'm still thinking of the single set of footprints in the sand. (I heard Him say:)<br>  "My precious child, I'd never leave you.<br>  I have carved you on the hollow of My hand.<br>  It's then I carried you in My arms,<br>  When you see one set of footprints in the sand."<br>  Will I hear the angels singing, as my life comes to an end.<br>  Oh Lord, I long to see You. Will You be there once again?<br>  My eyes turn toward the heavens, along the path of foreign lands,<br>  Once more, I'm thinking of the set of footprints in the sand. (Jesus said:)<br>  "My precious child, I'd never leave you.<br>  See your name carved on the hollow of My hand.<br>  I'm here to carry you to your home.<br>  You will see one set of footprints in the sand<br>  <br>  What inspirational thoughts reflected into one perfect masterpiece. I do agree highly. Thanks for posting-hope this helps!|`|y7lUgd3aaa	It's very inspiring to Christians.  We actually have this poem hanging in our church which must mean that it's very inspiring.|`|EOaFZoNtaa	Hi i am athiest and  i think it is a nice poem.<br>  Don't down all the athiest because your religous. <br>  Not all are a like.|`|IdGbtvaLaa	I have always love this poem..!!|`|WoI3Hichaa	I have never heard of this poem...EVER...|`|HCbgV86zaa	It's lovely :-)|`|IKGhRJVsaa	Yeah|`|HJdsty5uaa	No, it's corny.|`|CBJGaDA7aa	yes|`|qg9l2gcPaa	my mom gave me a necklace with that on it a few birthdays ago|`|y3xCDNC0aa	Yes, it makes me cry.

Yeahh, I would, I would be so scared but once I'd done it I would wanna do it again!<br>  <br>  But if you mean normally just jump out of one whilst it's flying, with no rope, then no chance. Unless it was to save someone elses life, and that person I loved very much.    <br>  <br>  <br>  :)|`|1e9837b90fb6cd2da8f7ba59782f65a1aa	Why would any one jump out of a perfectly good airplane?

But I never had to open the hatch and jump.|`|GHD8JicSaa	In some cases,  yes.<br>  <br>  Paratroopers jump out of planes all the time.<br>  Sky divers do it too.<br>  Most of the time those are relatively slow moving turbo-props.  <br>  <br>  But DB Cooper did not seem to do very well jumping out of a jet.|`|UbM3YHS5aa	Hell yea!|`|Lat2BDgeaa	Eh, maybe.

tDUs971eaa	At 8:46 I was watching news on CNBC.<br>  A reporter said a Cessna flew into a World Trade Center building.<br>  When I saw all the black smoke, I called my son on the West Coast.<br>  Told him to get out of bed, wake up his apartment neighbors and<br>  watch TV news.<br>  Then called my daughter here in Michigan. We watched the second<br>  airliner crash into the WTC building. We shortly after watched the<br>  two buildings collapse.<br>  I was happy to be living in a sparsely populated rural area.<br>  A morning we will never forget.|`|RmIeoU7raa	I was 11 years old when it happened and on my way to school.  I found out about it after I got to school and was in class.  A few of the kids came in late during 1st hour because they were watching it on tv.

QxcRUl9haa	Poll Answer D.<br>  <br>  I live in New England and I wear flip flops until I utterly cannot anymore, usually the first big snow storm, or when my toes feel like they're going to fall off from being so cold. Right now I probably have about 6 or 7 pairs of flip flops one of which is convertible and you can change the patterns on the straps. I can't choose a favorite color.|`|LK26v0z3aa	My favorite color of flip-flops is either pink or blue. <br>  <br>  I wear flip flops:<br>  B, and mostly during the summer.|`|nL8s4ozIaa	theyr really not good for u. u can loose ur arch. but i wear them in the summer
Rak2TnaXaa	But then who am I supposed to ask?  haha<br>  <br>  It's worth going to.  Just hang out with friends and go some place after it.  That's prob what I'm gonna do and I usually think dances are lame|`|8RW6FV6raa	I think you should go to at least one of your proms. It is an experience that you will not be able to get back once you leave high school. I went to my junior prom. I didn't go to my senior prom. I'm glad that I went to my junior prom. I got a lot of great memories. People that didn't go regretted it years later.|`|jvHIqtp2aa	I didn't have a very good time at mine, I spent alot of money on a dress and, well it was a long time ago but I sure could use that dress money back. Plus, the guy I went to the prom with ended up becoming my husband, Now, there is another good reason to avoid the prom at all cost.|`|bvsXX1Cgaa	i don't really want to go, but my friends want me to, and i got the dress already so i'm going to go, you should to, you are only in high school once|`|PFNFTAtgaa	If you have a hot date or enjoy the music and good company|`|e1jG5fhLaa	I guess not if you dont wanna go..|`|vVYj8b74aa	NO|`|qwvijKexaa	nope, all you do is dance|`|CMUMhXaiaa	The things that make prom worth going to are:<br>  1. Getting laid.<br>  2. The afterparties.<br>  3. The HOTEL afterparties, as long as you don't get caught.<br>  4. Not coming home until the next day and not worrying about what your parents say.<br>  <br>  If you don't plan on doing any of this, then you probably shouldn't go.|`|rTPofcWRaa	Yes, it is because it's your one and only chance to go, and there will be lots of memories made there!|`|aufBhECNaa	well im not going to prom yet...im barely going to high school,but you shouldn't miss it.Its once in a life time.|`|ulrg90Laaa	yes|`|HIO0yvK0aa	Yeah! i get to see my beautiful girlfriend in a gorgeous dress =D<br>   but appariently my tie won't match her dress :S ahhhh! :S:S|`|B1GjfOUdaa	I have a great photo of my sons prom he enjoyed it.|`|t0mb150gaa	Yes it is one of the lasting memories you will have of high school. It is also a time to be with friends that may be going away to college and most often then not the friends you had in high school go there different ways in life so it may be the last time you and your friends can enjoy together.|`|sFASHCNRaa	yeah! even if youre not dating anyone, just go with some single friends and you'll have a great time!<br>  <br>  i'm a sophomore and i'm going with my friend to her junior prom =D<br>  <br>  wtf why'd i get a thumbs down. >_<|`|jpH4IjWnaa	No, it's not worth it, I'm not gonna go to my prom, which is next year.|`|KaAXJJo8aa	yes. i loved prom:)

8CL8o8K0aa	Focus on your education and stay out of company that will cause you trouble.|`|VpuK1qTmaa	private's school is immense....no different to a public school...ive been to one public school and it's so different...you might find that  you're a bit behind at first, but it will be alright...seriously, don't worry about it, it's seriously really good (:<br>  <br>  at my school, quite a lot of people outside of my school hate us and think we're really stuck up, so just be aware of those people<br>  <br>  <br>  hope everything goes alright for you :D|`|Qih2hKqkaa	Yeah, good for you!  Public schools suck!|`|cYuWbvSKaa	Yeah:<br>  <br>  People may tease you and call you a rich b****<br>  because you get to go to private school.<br>  I'm not kidding! Don't mind them. Ignore them.<br>  You will get more and less friends at times.|`|h2XQaIAmaa	good luck my friend (:<br>  stay out of trouble  (x<br>  <br>  oh and if there is any drama just screw it (x|`|UNFlbMzpaa	Watch for the giant oatmeal|`|aprgVgxMaa	I'm not really sure what type of "advice" youre wanting, but I went to a private school and they were really strict. We wore white polo shirts and khakis every day. The classes are a lot harder than public schools, and the teachers expect a lot more from you. However, I do think it's a better education. I went to a public high school though, and now I've chosen to go to a private college simply because it is small and religiously affiliated. hope that helped a little.
VALxlwYSaa	No your not a bad daughter. He'll probably be mad for a little while because he expected you to want to be there for him.<br>  Or he understands and really wants you to go to school there.<br>  <br>  Though, even if we JUST moved and I got excepted in a good school I would probably go with him anyway.|`|CZ8szX0jaa	no hon, but your dad is a bad father for being so selfish|`|ul76tLdKaa	im sorry i think it is i mean his mom is dying your grandmother i think you should go to india and maybe next year go to the other school and explain  the reason you had to turn them down i really hope for the best for you
h9YPMFEJaa	For me, I would like some action, good characters, and cool outfits. I also like it when there are some romantic scenes and some funny scenes. The outfit I like the most for a manga character was when this girl had a half-top and baggy jeans, and she also had long hair in a pony tail. She looked really cool!

4XFlifZTaa	Salt water tastes terrible, but its easy to float/swim in it.|`|sc8Eaahnaa	absolutely|`|7u8hX3Hkaa	It's the new trend . <br>  <br>  Saltwater pools are less maintenance .|`|BDPc9P4Faa	Yes.|`|AA11370204	Yes, it'll have less bacteria!|`|mggll8dRaa	It Sure is....!!|`|P4WJD6Cpaa	Yes chlorine can be a very dangerous chemical.|`|Hzf3QK9faa	The newest thing lately in pools. Supposed to be healthier, safer and easier to take care of.|`|bDUbJ7aAaa	yeah, my friend has one and its a lot better cuz it doesnt sting your eyes! lol|`|iFTa9FqZaa	yes, way better for you
d23F89ECaa	Maybe.<br>  <br>  But here's something that will help.<br>  <br>  You get sea sick because you're body is moving up and down, left and right all at the same time in a very unnatural way.  And your head has no idea why.  So all the nerves and muscles in your central area, the tummy, don't know what's going on.<br>  <br>  If you go out and look at the horizon and what's happening to the ship in comparison to it, you see what's going on and your eyes can see for themselves why you're moving up and down, left and right.  In time, your body will adjust itself and in even more time, your body will just know.<br>  <br>  I was practically raised on a small craft and live on the Atlantic Coast so I know.  And my body does to.  But before I did, I always got sea sick.|`|G1VsV0wWaa	Possibly, but not necessarily.<br>  A lot of it has to do with what level of the ship you are on.<br>  The lower you are the more motion you'll experience.<br>  You can buy sea sickness pills at any drug store. I advise getting the kind you take once every 12 hours. They come in various quantities, and you can buy a pack that will last the duration of your cruise.<br>  My wife got seasick a few times, but since she started taking the pills she's had no furthur problems.|`|7u8hX3Hkaa	I hate the feeling of constant motion .<br>  So , I' would never pay someone to put me in that position and<br>  lose the ability to stop it at my request .|`|786cdd812ce5aab02a737d9a44746cdbaa	It's possible, all I know is your system could have adjusted since the last time you had gone sea side. I do suggest you be careful.|`|lEjYhwxkaa	Oh yes the ship rocks alot.|`|AA11370204	No, the new cruise ships are more stabler than the older ships.|`|CMuL7XpKaa	no\t|`|iFTa9FqZaa	nope, you can barely feel the boat is moving on a cruise. My brother gets seasick easily, but didn't when we went on a cruise.<br>  <br>  but have a pack of that anti nausea meds, which i'm pretty sure they sell|`|Hzf3QK9faa	Prepare for the worst and hope for the best. There are lots of methods to deal with motion sickness whether at sea or on land including motion sickness bracelets, new treatments, herbal remedies. Look into it ahead of time and use only if required. :)|`|mggll8dRaa	Possibly, but I thought it was a great feeling, just 'go with the flow'....!!|`|cYFAo75Yaa	yes...just take some dramamine before you go
AA11370204	No, it's better to have a traveling companion or relative to go with you!|`|mggll8dRaa	You'll be fine, be careful around some strangers, as is the case anywhere....!!|`|Hzf3QK9faa	Probably fine but you do need to be careful. Maybe talk to others who have cruised before. Consider seeing if a girlfriend would go on a cruise as a roomate and buddy?|`|7u8hX3Hkaa	I am highly suspicious of cruise lines .<br>  Too many people get raped , robbed , and disappear on those <br>  things .|`|P4WJD6Cpaa	I don't think there will be anything to worry about. Just be careful though and make sure you will be safe.
3TLuSf9Yaa	They can get over it & move on sometimes you just have to show them you are not the same as the others.|`|Hzf3QK9faa	As has already been stated, both men and women can get over these things, it is a choice.|`|Hy5XeA0Waa	aww, so sorry hon, there are good men out there, one is looking for you right now  ( :|`|iuWfp2fEaa	Yes, I'm sure both men and women can and often do get over it and move on.|`|T9xbywGPaa	It is the same for men and women. It is based on each individual person, not just men.  Some get over it and some don't. <br>  People can get over it.. doesn't always mean they will.|`|i15KoiJhaa	If he can't get over it, then get over him...<br>  <br>  Sheesh who wants to hear someone continue to complain and cry about some a** clown that did them wrong?|`|786cdd812ce5aab02a737d9a44746cdbaa	As a man, I can tell you the best option(for me, at least) is to move on and go on with my life.|`|AA11885973	The common denominator in ALL my relationships has been me.  You might want to look at that.|`|eeyfLIeMaa	sure, just have enough failed relationships so that your so used to it you just dont care. then it becomes easy. but ya gotta get back on a lot of horses|`|WQvDIhmgaa	Can' t the same be applied to women? To answer your question yes.|`|fT15YEkFaa	I keep it to myself, always|`|AA11370204	No, there are some men who will never get over it and remain bitter old men!|`|mggll8dRaa	I will never forget Bad treatment from Low-Class In-Laws, mostly a bunch of Losers. (I know, I 'Picked Her.....lol).....!!
3TLuSf9Yaa	I disagree they just think they have more fun, they actually have no self respect, no morals & values. Why do you think they do that most are lacking in father figures growing up. The guys usually know this too. Those kind of girls also allow themselves to be second best too, mistresses if you will, just waiting around for a family to fall apart. They aren't the ones that will be there through thick & thin they are too selfish for that. Good is always best, bad is too easy. Stand strong you desirve it.|`|7u8hX3Hkaa	I choose my actions based on how they make me feel personally .<br>  <br>  If I do bad things to others , Then I feel bad inside . So , I try not to <br>  do anything they makes me feel bad .<br>  <br>  But , equally true is , I do things that I like and enjoy that make me <br>  feel good which others would say is bad !<br>  <br>  It's all a judgement call anyway . If you can live with your actions without regrets , then it is OK to do them .|`|jNUYkCZxaa	No sometimes I prefer to stand on my milkcrate while wearing big old 5" Frankenstein clunky wedges cuz it makes it a little harder for people to reach their feet that high.|`|fQ2veTIhaa	Well ......My Dad ....Always Did The Right Thing ........we all knew that ......<br>  the key is .....not to keep score ........just play fair and deal in good faith ......<br>  It may not make everything OK ......but it is the right thing to do ......<br>  and you wont have to be ashamed .......|`|786cdd812ce5aab02a737d9a44746cdbaa	All I can say is you have to follow your heart and do what you feel is best for you, no one can live your life for you.|`|Hzf3QK9faa	No, I try to be myself, best me I can be. If there are problems encountered with that I stand up for myself. And I have friends who watch out for me too! :)|`|Hy5XeA0Waa	never change <br>  <br>  good can be bad, just let your naughty out to play, lol|`|BXbnLxNJaa	no, because the good I do is meaningful good, not for my own self satisfaction.|`|Akt4uZsAaa	You are thinking exactly as I was thinking because it seemed like everytime I did something good then two bad things would happen so i thought well im going to do some BAD things and see if good things happen to me. but im a nice person i couldnt do anything bad...%|`|T9xbywGPaa	I have learned not to keep letting that happen, but won't change who I am or how I am. <br>  Is changing how you are going to really make you feel better about who you are? If not, chances are it isn't worth it.  : )|`|l5zWxw1Aaa	man, so true.<br>  i am the nicest person, well, in real life, lol.<br>  and i feel like i'm thrown around and kicked all day!<br>  it's horrible. :(<br>  i feel underappreciated.|`|adLSRFrZaa	Sometimes doing the right thing is being realistic.

Women like to think their men want them, not other guys. I also think the reason women can do that is because we're naturally more comfortable with each other.<br>  <br>  That's just my opinion, who really knows though :]|`|7Z2sxcVDaa	Maybe becuase Girls have more interesting stuff on their body<br>  <br>  than Boys <br>  lol|`|PMGXddjgaa	Woman understand the pleasure... <br>  <br>  Men will get turned on seeing Daffy Duck and the Road Runner Have it OFF xxx|`|1C123Xdsaa	Because two guys would do each other up the a$$.

ONWCXzUMaa	Rolling Stones, they are the first rock band to give us that heavy back beat before any other rock band. They were the total opposite of the Beatles who were almost 100% pop at that time. And the only other band that played that style at that time was the Kinks, and then the Who, then The Faces, Jeff Beck Group and then along came Cream, which lead us into, Southern Rock [Allman Brothers and Lynyrd Skynyrd], and at the same time bands like, Free, Led Zeppelin, Mountain, Aerosmith. Then Southern Rock gave us bands like Black Oak Arkansas and Blackfoot. Then form Aerosmith came Queen, Montrose, Kiss and then Van Halen, Def Leppard. This was when music was just called Hard Rock. Then Heavy Metal came along with Jimi Hendrix, The Yardbirds, Cream, which evolved into Led Zeppelin, Black Sabbath, Then there wa NWBH Bands such as Judas Priest, Motorhead , Iron Maiden Which then gave us the Blak Metal, Venom, Mercyful Fate and Hair Metal which gave us Gun's N Roses and Ratt, and then Thrash Metal which was Anthrax, Megadeth, Metallica which then broke down into, Death Metal, Grindcore, Nu-Metal, Scandinavian Metal, New Wave of American Heay Metal, [Lamb of God, Killswitch Engage, Agalloch and then Stoner Metal and so on and so on.<br>  <br>  Because of their earlier music which was completely differeant that any other band at the time, In their day, they were the Bad Boys of Rock, When the Beatles where still in to pop.[I do like the Beatles by the way, but not back in the day, all rocker's back in the day were Stone fans, not Beatle Fans, of course then the Kinks  The Who just started to make us rockers better. And you know the rest of the story.<br>  Take care, and a very good question.<br>  dave|`|5HvdcWvBaa	Heyyyooo :)<br>  <br>  Well, I never know if I explain this very well but here goes...<br>  <br>  I always feel like there's a Queen song for every situation or every emotion that I could ever be feeling. Pretty much :) Its like I know that Queen can cheer me up (especially Freddie), even if my day totally sucks. <br>  <br>  And I don't get quite that feeling from any other band. That is why Queen are FANTASTICAL XD<br>  <br>  ---<br>  <br>  Hahaha!! I did ask Shred, just so everyone knows!! I have asked everyone, I'm not just stealing avatars, here!!

And getting drunk and putting maple syrup on are ham is just a everyday routine.<br>  <br>  Americans seem to think we say "eh" after every sentence, which isn't true.  We just say it when we give a strong opinion and want the person to reply. eg. "that was awesome, eh?"|`|9Lu8Dldxaa	no that's def not true. <br>  and we don't live in igloos either in case you thought that too. <br>  <br>  we have the same stuff that the states has. but with more greeneery perhaps? <br>  I've only been to the states once.|`|jeZmqhNcaa	When I went to Vancouver it was the exact same as USA, cept the girls there were actually sluttier lol xx|`|yGm29f3Eaa	I think they like to go ice fishing too|`|lLN8VD20aa	yeah ... but the fun comes in when they decide to name something new ..."ham"|`|2oXy22pvaa	No. I live in canada.<br>  We do a HELL of a lot more than that.<br>  <br>  Though it's hard to believe.. most of canada is exactly like the states. We just have colder winters. Which makes for a lot of shovelling in the winter.. but anyways. <br>  <br>  Ugh,..<br>  <br>  1) we eat more than maple syrup, and ham. I've never ever heard of anyone eating then together.<br>  2) Hell no about the drunkness! <br>  3) Yeah, some people play hockey, it's a big sport. But no one just does that. I can't even skate never mind play hockey.<br>  <br>  People who would say that obviously have no idea what they're talking about it. And if anyone believes that.. well you'd sorta sound like an idiot.. just to say<br>  <br>  And maybe saying, eh, is a bit more common here. But it's not something we do all the time.

n6nwpanAaa	Well, that is very complex, due to the nature of the disorder.  Unlike most mental disortders, cutters have a Personality Disorder, which does not work itself out with time, meds, balance in chemistry, etc.  People with personality disorders are always trying to manipulate people for whatever reason, usual some agenda involving attention, but do not posess the ability to stop.  Plus, they experience so much mental pain, the actual realease of th cut, brings relief, sometimes euphoria, and that's hard for them to pass on, sometimes impossible.  That is a profile with a true cutter, I used to work extensively with them.  Then you have your teenage (usually, not always) girls, who always need excessive attention much the mothers who harm their children with Muncheosean (sp) disease because they gain sympathy and attention, only that one is real too..  It has become fashionable to become "bipolar" and it's rediculous because half of these kids on this site haven't a clue what it is, and the other half answering them are even worse.  I got so obsessed once with trying to offer these girls some guidance and correct advise, but I just could not keep up with it.  Yeah, it is a trend and fad,but real to some who cannot cope other ways and only a specialist can make the determination.|`|0utZQuyeaa	Hmm, I dunno. I don't think its TOO common... Well, perhaps.<br>  And no, I haven't done it; haven't known anybody who's done it.<br>  <br>  But naah. Not a trend or a fad. Simply people trying to get attention because they have a problem deep down inside. They want people to notice that they're cutting themselves, & help them out.<br>  [they do not want to die!]<br>  But, yeah. It could lead to being suicidal.|`|mqdkcHDFaa	I'd be surprised if any teen didn't know someone who did or currently cuts themselves.  Therefore, I'd say it's fairly common.<br>  Also, it's not just emo kids who do it- I've known popular girls who just can't handle their stress that cut, as well as jocks who can't stand the pressure.<br>  As for myself, I love my life (most of the time).  I mean, I go through periods when I just can't stand someone, or when I feel uber-stressed, but I've never been tempted to self-mutilate to make myself feel better.  In general, my group of friends and I are a happy bunch.  Plus, it's a pain playing tennis during a hot Texas summer in long sleeves.<br>  I don't view it as a fad, actually.  Just because the media has moved away from it doesn't mean it's not still happening.|`|Ew7hXGFtaa	Well, before not long ago I would have just said anyone who cuts is emo and that's that. But my views on it have changed cause I know people who have just been very depressed and been through a ton of tough stuff in there life so they do it and they feel so bad about it after. <br>  <br>  I've never cut myself before but I'm just saying I can see how someone would do it.<br>  <br>  I really have no idea if it's here to stay or not. I guess it will just have to be one of those we will see kind of things. If I had to guess I would say teenagers will keep doing it cause it's in peoples heads now.|`|IMu3wBu8aa	I don't think it's a trend or fad. I think it's a person who needs a release, and that's what they do for one. Loads of depression and stress build up, then boom...they have an addiction. I know someone who did it and they didn't know anyone who did it too. That person didn't do it because others were. That person had no idea what cutting really was. It just happened. Maybe, in a lot of cases..it would be considered a "trend". When someone does it for serious reasons, it's not a "trend" anymore, it becomes a serious problem. <br>  <br>  I guess, it's always been around. I guess, people started opening their eyes. Usually, a lot of people have to suffer before people are warned or told about things like this.|`|k4GqiB6taa	Yeah its a much more recent thing.<br>  I don't like it one bit!<br>  I told my dad about "emos" in my school,he did not even know what it meant.<br>  My dad is kind of young by the way,grew up in the 80's.<br>  Anyways,back to the point.  Yes I know a lot of people who do that in our school.<br>  Some of them do that just to be cool or get attention.<br>  It really sickens me because there are some people who cut themselves because they are really depressed and they need help.<br>  Its sad really.  I think MCR is making cutting look "cool".<br>  I don't like it and I never would do that.|`|hJTvbbKnaa	i dont know. most people who cut and tell people are attention whores.<br>  i use to. for a while. i didnt tell anyone, i didnt want anyone to worrie about me.<br>  cutting made me feel better. like i felt like i had all this anger in me then i would cut and it would all come out thought the cut. and id feel so much better, then i stopped just because. my exboyfriend use to cut a lot and i hated it.<br>  i think its a trend.|`|cLTbby44aa	Just because the media has been exposing this phenomenon recently doesn't necessarily mean it's new, IMO. I think it could have been around longer than we think. Can't say I really view it as some kind of fad or trend. <br>  <br>  Yes, I know someone who used to do it, a very good friend of mine who was going through tough times. Strangely enough though, she isn't even into any kind of Rock music (let alone emo). Not at all your steretypical 'emo kid' at all.<br>  <br>  To be honest, the whole concept of cutting yourself is beyond me. I don't see how it helps in any way.|`|NJZA6Pktaa	It isn't really a recent thing, I myself had a problem with that in my late teens/early 20's which was a while ago. It just wasn't something anyone spoke about. I think it got to be a "cool anti-statement" in the recent past, it isn't cool it is a sign of someone who is hurting, in my opinion. It was when I hurt so much inside I would cut to balance it out, and see the pain I was feeling, I guess that is how I can best describe it|`|T6PzMyPBaa	well it's somewhat becoming a fad but at the same time if people cut they obviously have mental issues and i don't think people take it as seriously as they should.<br>  cutting could lead to alot of other things and it has nothing to do with "emo".<br>  it's a mental problem|`|OLcXtWQyaa	in the 'old days' it was considered to be more abnormal than it is now. i did it for many years. only others i met who did it were patients in a mental hospital.|`|d29f5682f080f113ebb06c1d1e8e6cc9aa	I don't think its a very popular thing now a days. I don't know many people who do it, and the ones who do are loonies.|`|PQpafDsDaa	I work in a mental institution.  Every cutter I've seen is borderline and seeking attention.  I'm over them.|`|OWdoFmKqaa	I've known someone who'd went through this type of issue before, t'was my best mate actually. I remember she had been going through a very tough time back then, she couldn't handle what she's been responsible for, what's she been thrown at and so inflicting physical pain on herself was found to be comforting somehow. <br>  <br>  With the moral support she badly needed but had neglected at first, she passed through with that phase before it was too late for her. I remember phone calls in the middle of the night, listening to her crying, listening to her every breath hoping that it wouldn't be her last [while she was cutting herself]. It was a hard time for her and everyone around her, we were all concerned, coming to school wearing long sleeves trying to hide her scars from us each day by day was unbearable to her friends, the people who wanted to help, we just wanted her to stop.<br>  <br>  It wasn't just simple cuts, or mere bruises, those letters were bloody carved into her arms; most just on the fragile nerves. That girl was morally weak, she was on her worst behavior, avoiding us and always walking away from help. I'm not making this seem as a larger matter than you think it is, but it is as serious as I saw it myself. <br>  <br>  Just listening to a teenage girl constantly talk about death and suicide isn't much of a pleasure to anyone, that time was dark for all of us. My friend was a part of me, and just watching her do this to herself was unbearable, the fact that I couldn't stop it was was just horrible. One piece of advice I would offer anyone who has a friend starting off like that, tell their parents, ruin their moment, show them that this is not only about them, go to their home and snatch the razor right out of their hand if you have to. <br>  <br>  I can tell you it's no trend or fad, it's what they consider it to be a satisfactory utility, it's what eases their pain, calms them down, "brings them to their senses". I asked her, and more than anything, all she wanted was attention.<br>  <br>  Self harm was never new, it was never a trend, or anything that goes and comes anytime people want it to. It existed long before this emo craze people now follow, part of being emo is viewing yourself as the only person the world circles around and truly, being emo is being all about you, it's about centering everything around you. This is simply just another way of showing people how conceited and self-indulgent they can be.<br>  <br>  Ah - To hell with this accursed fad.

Family is family, you will have to call them at least twice a year (their birthday, and Christmas- no, it doesn't matter even if you don't believe in celebrating Christmas). You don't get many 2nd chances on having brothers and sisters. So lend a brotha a call, and tell him you called to check up on him.<br>  <br>  :D|`|y7lUgd3aaa	NO!

YQ1Q7XeEaa	Watch "It happened one night" starring Clark Gable then you tell me if old movies are any good.|`|hLSIRDtZaa	Yeah, 1970's on up. But those from 1920's hell no! LOL The 1980's put out more hit movies than anyother generation. You should have said something like 1960's on down, unless it was a Western with Clint Eastwood that would be the only reason for me watching a 1960's movie. I tried actually watching a movie on American Movie Classics that was like 1930's, it was one of those man and woman falling in love movies.....I fell asleep. Those movies are boring as hell! LOL|`|NbjJiSJJaa	Not really, only horror movies from the 80's. I was born in '96 so ya.....|`|80ehnLBJaa	I adore classic movies. I grew up watching the great black and white films. By age 4, I was imitating Bette Davis.  I love silent pictures, pre-code films (1929-1934,) film noirs, screwball comedies, Hitchcock films, etc.  I can't remember the last modern film I saw at the theatre.  I'd rather stay home and watch Turner Classic Movies.  I love the storylines, costumes, set designs--in general, almost everything.  They didn't need to rely on special effects because the stories were strong enough to hold the audience's attention.  Because of that, those films are timeless and still enjoyed to this day.  I guess, I was born way too late.  That is what I have been told.  Just off the top of my head, some of my favorites include:<br>  <br>  "The Thin Man" (1934) William Powell & Myrna Loy<br>  "Baby Face" (1932) Barbara Stanwyck & George Brent<br>  "The Women" (1939) Norma Shearer, Joan Crawford & Rosalind Russell<br>  "Now, Voyager" (1942) Bette Davis, Paul Henreid & Claude Rains<br>  "Dark Victory" (1939) Bette Davis & George Brent<br>  "Libeled Lady" (1936) William Powell, Myrna Loy, Jean Harlow & Spencer Tracy<br>  "The Lady Eve" (1941) Barbara Stanwyck & Henry Fonda<br>  "Double Indemnity" (1944) Barbara Stanwyck & Fred MacMurray<br>  "Rebecca" (1940) Joan Fontaine & Laurence Olivier<br>  "Night of the Hunter" (1955) Robert Mitchum<br>  "The Unknown" (1927) Lon Chaney & Joan Crawford<br>  "He Who Gets Slapped" (1924) Lon Chaney & Norma Shearer<br>  "The Enchanted Cottage" (1945) Dorothy McGuire<br>  "Random Harvest" (1942) Greer Garson & Ronald Colman<br>  "Red Dust" (1932) Clark Gable, Jean Harlow & Mary Astor<br>  "Dinner at Eight" (1933) Jean Harlow, Marie Dressler, John and Lionel Barrymore, etc.<br>  "Grand Hotel" (1932) Greta Garbo, Joan Crawford, John and Lionel Barrymore, etc.<br>  "It Happened One Night" (1934) Clark Gable & Claudette Colbert<br>  "All About Eve" (1950) Bette Davis & Anne Baxter<br>  "Sunset Boulevard" (1950) Gloria Swanson & William Holden<br>  "Ball of Fire" (1941) Barbara Stanwyck & Gary Cooper<br>  "Leave Her to Heaven" (1945) Gene Tierney<br>  "The Patsy" (1928) Marion Davies & Marie Dressler<br>  "Jezebel" (1938) Bette Davis, Henry Fonda & George Brent<br>  "Sunrise" (1927) Janet Gaynor<br>  "The Heiress" (1949) Olivia de Havilland<br>  "City Lights" (1931) Charlie Chaplin<br>  "Strange Interlude" (1932) Norma Shearer & Clark Gable<br>  "To Each His Own" (1946) Olivia de Havilland<br>  "Jewel Robbery" (1932) Kay Francis & William Powell|`|6oWIKqS7aa	some classics are awesome, like hitchcock's are still good. and i love casablanca= masterpiece!!!<br>  though old films... performances tend to be cheeeeeeeeese, so generally, i prefer after 80s and so on...|`|FomIa9jQaa	i do|`|p5ZJfiIaaa	YES, 1940s and 1950s were the best era of Hollywood in my opinion. Everyone was always so...classy  :) Plus I LOVE musicals. Those two decades gave us incredible films, some of my favs being:  On the Town (one of my top 3 favorite movies of all time,) Seven Brides for Seven Brothers, Singin' in the Rain, Miracle on 34th Street, An American in Paris, Guys & Dolls, Carousel, South Pacific, Dumbo, Fantasia...  <br>  <br>  They just don't make movies like that anymore. There was just something about it back then, and Hollywood is so completely different now. These days it's all about shock value and sex and violence and things. But back then it was about romance and classic horror. Things like the original "The Haunting" where you never even SAW anything really creepy but it still had you on the edge of your seat! Or all the Hitchcock films, Rear Window, Vertigo, North by Northwest...<br>  <br>  Ah, now I just want to make an afternoon of watching all these films :)|`|1g8uChdyaa	1970s included some of the greatest movies; The Godfathers, The Rockys, etc.<br>  <br>  But I don't really watch movies from an earlier time than 1970.|`|0Ikzr2Taaa	Yes I look movies from the 1970s to 1980s.

I hadn't added in local taxes.<br>  <br>  When I was lied to in school (educated) We were taught that the government was set up for the people, history and information tells us that this wasn't entirely true.<br>  The government was set up to manage the stolen lands from the people, then as the industrial ages came  and  the land owners (lords)  had to pay to keep their work force well, with bath houses and schools etc. to share this cost for the lords a  central body was set up to manage funds, (income tax and national insurance and other taxes) so that the basic living and healthy living was available to the workers and that the pockets of the lords wasn't effected.<br>  <br>  The first recorded people who saw this, were hung as trade unions started.<br>  All that's is happening from the high taxes is that we are paying the lord of the lands ( factories and business owners in modern times) and we the people/workers/slaves have to pay for this as we have done for centuries.<br>  You should not forget, that the government think that you only need ￡48.75 per week to live and about 40% of that they will get back in taxes when you buy what you need. anything else is fair game to them to take from you.|`|HRY7cD2yaa	We just lie and cheat a lot.<br>  A lot has been learned since you numpties got into power.|`|7sXNwFynaa	they are idiots|`|YY806Xn0aa	stop acting like gordon brown, its not funny, its not clever its just annoying...

It's a lot more exciting than something like basket ball or soccer in my opinion, since all those do are move the ball back and forth across the field.<br>  <br>  ^_^|`|j4iGya06aa	well...if ye have never played its understanding...i play gaelic football...and nothing beats the feeling when you catch a ball in the back line and kick it to our forwards, or when you block the ball and run up the field beating two or three defenders and scoring for your team, you never loose the felling know matter how many times you have done it, when i watch football i get that feeling back a wee bit!!... dont knock it til ye tried it, obviously some games are like watching paint dry, but sometimes ye get to see a little flick of genius!!<br>  :)|`|mZ1tUoacaa	since it  involves lot  of drama , suspense , team spirit , etc in a 120 min<br>  of time which you cant even expect from any Hollywood movie also. so we watch it.|`|QRbCnBgFaa	I really like football. Just give it try and see how fun it is.<br>  I like playing it more than watching it,though,<br>  <br>  :)|`|wZc2gsq0aa	i dont cant stand it

I think the only time I will is if I'm saying "ohhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh", but then I'll do this: "ohhhhhhhhhh...oh.", which could or could not be taken as a joke, either way is fine with me.<br>  <br>  (Shrugs) It's funnier when you improvise it.|`|HXpR2bw0aa	Yep, all the time!<br>  <br>  There's certain words that I do it to mostly tho.

G3P5htn7aa	Without every one in the room really believing in it it won't work.<br>  The ouija board can be very dangerous so I really hope you know what you're doing. I use to mess with it all the time more so cause I don't think any of us believed in it but then one night a bunch of us (20-30) got together and we all agreed to really put all our thought and effort into it as well as believing in it and let me tell you it worked. Since that day I have never touched another ouija board. A day that I will remember for the rest of my life.|`|dh48AkbCaa	i only have one piece of advice....stay away from ouija boards, get it out of your house and destroy it.|`|l5zWxw1Aaa	sounds like fun, don't take it too seriously, just have fun. :)|`|4ACYeKUwaa	i say dont do it.

BC3oQiIhaa	Oh, this was a very long time ago, but some friends and I were out drinking and went to a club that was located in a downstairs of a bowling alley.  I was well and truly stocious.  There was a "little person" taking the cover charge and checking ID's sitting on a stool at the bottom of the steps.  As I approached, I started waving my hands over his head and yelling "Where's the strings?!  Where's the ** strings?!"

5rraSJRVaa	I think so, I mean, someone who has a symmetrical face looks nicer than someone who has a lopsided face right?<br>  <br>  Nevertheless, I do know that beauty is influenced by the Golden Ratio :)<br>  1:618..|`|eAhkr1ruaa	I suppose that is part of it.<br>  But sometimes not having symmetry can also make beauty.<br>  ?.blondy|`|PFNFTAtgaa	No imperfection can be seen as beautiful|`|emJ79qagaa	Yes actually, it could be. But also features that stand out from the crowd.|`|WQvDIhmgaa	Yes it is....shouldn't be but it is....|`|IM6UsVC2aa	No|`|AA11938631	Yes , there has been research on this, apparently people are more attracted to a face that is symmetrical .|`|qNKK4hLDaa	my geometry teacher told us a fun fact that the more symmetrical a persons face is is supposedly how good looking they are<br>  <br>  i think its pretty true, most symmetrical faces are considered "ttly hawt" but i think thats boring lol
e55d4a01420a2827c4108baf10b7d77daa	No, but I have LITERALLY weathered storms before. Once I was in a microburst on a highway in a car. For those who don't know what a microburst is, it feels like a tornado, but it's just warm air shooting up, pushing cold air down. The wind blows in one direction (no swirling) but the storm is just as intense as a low power tornado. The sky was a deep purple/brown (despite it being daytime), and if you went over 40 mph water shot up around you. How I got home was knowing the road.|`|70OHpjySaa	I'm a storm right now.

Jy9KORHDaa	I wondered the same thing, especially since his mother Hope was blind. when he tripped I dont even think he saw Heather watching him?|`|SXwlw9N2aa	I was also wondering that too. Especially when he was sitting there reading the book and then threw it across the cell. It was like he was struggling to read it, then when Heather came back in, it was like he didnt even see her. If he is going blind, this is really going to be an interesting storyline for him. I am ready for him to get out of jail and cause some more turmoil in GC.|`|5JgchYUEaa	i had read somewhere in a spoiler where they said that adam is supposed to sleep with phyllis. i couldn't see how in the heck that would happen with him being in jail and she not particularly liking him before he went to jail. it does make since that with him going blind, victor would get him out, he would be upset trying to deal with his blindness and phyllis would find out that nick and sharon have either slept together again or have been kissing again. phyllis connects with adam and there you go. i sort of like the facial hair he is sporting now. kind of sexy.|`|r7sgshwKaa	I think he is, and when he ran into that desk and Heather saw him I think she was wondering the same thing. That would be very sad to see that happen to him. But considering the way he treated people when he thought he was in charge at Newman, that's probably just a heaping good dose of karma. This might bring him and his dad a little closer though.|`|4kuWOZowaa	omg i totally forgot hope was blind..i hope it dont happen to adam this early omg|`|EPPb5pRBaa	It said in a Spoiler he is going blind and Victor is going to get him out of jail.|`|6tqGKoREaa	Yes then he will see the light of his mistakes.|`|uUzbqGh5aa	So l've read. Then Victor is supposed to wave his magic wand and "poof" Adam gets his get out of jail free card! I don't understand where the writers are going with this one but l'll be happy to see him out of jail.|`|Qo6UWVaeaa	i was wondering this to! but no you didn't miss anything.|`|IsxB0Qi7aa	I think I must've missed something, too. I remember Adam throwing the book & stumbling around, but I never considered he might be going blind. I never liked his character, but he's already in prison & has some unknown rash, I feel bad for him if he is going blind, too.|`|5f0111f71db8592710a5d1cb4897be4aaa	I was wondering the same thing,,,but maybe he was just ignoring her and didn't want her to see just how bad he's doing ( mentally )<br>  <br>   He so deserves to be where he is !|`|rqwXqmyTaa	It said in a soap spoiler that an eye doctor is supposef to examine Adam....I didn't really put it together until now....so there could be a chance that he is losing his sight.|`|mXQYbFiiaa	Looks like he is

xJYh9zriaa	Sure man, take a highlighter or a sharpie (any thick pen) and use a shoe string to tie it up. Tie a knot on one end and on the other wrap it up as much as you can and tuck it back under itself. It's not quick to move/remove but it does work.<br>  <br>  <br>  Good luck and barre chords are your friend but only after you have all of the open chords down to instinct.|`|fI2uesEwaa	Well, a capo pretty much just holds down the strings at a certain fret, so the sound is different. It's just like you barring all six strings, so find something that can do that, a clamp maybe, or even someone else's finger???

CtJLXDJjaa	nah, ive never though revenge was sweet.... i think its awful, but as of late, i have been known to take it when it comes to me.<br>  i wouldnt say its better than ANY candy on this earth.... well not  at the moment at least, but soon enough you may get me into believing that lol<br>  <br>  damn, i would have never thought i would EVER be saying this, but yeah, lately i have been the type to take revenge.... ugh and it feels sooo awful, but feels soo good at the same time lol.<br>  RAWR!.... should i really be doing this lol..... onside of me is say "no, dont do it, your not that kind of person".  and the other side of me is say "go on do it, they deserve it, let it all out and go after them!"<br>  <br>  <br>  ahhhhh i dont know what to do lol.......|`|bgtNYOp5aa	No, I forgive and forget. With me when people are mean to me I usually find outu something bad happens to them eventually anyways with out me involved and that is revenge enough.<br>  <br>  However revenge movies are my favorite like Harrison Ford the Fugitive and Patriot Games. Anything Clint Eastwood plays is great.|`|jS4YILT5aa	Nope, no time. <br>  I move on to the next thing by then.<br>  <br>  I would love to but they are just not worth my effort. I'd rather do something positive or fun instead of unnecessarily obsessing about revenge.<br>  <br>  Edit: It worked out well. Some of my enemies ended up becoming close friends at one point or another in my life :)|`|YMnTveWuaa	Actually, I thought it kinda tasted like Fajitas.|`|TjleZszfaa	No & No|`|noUZuLV8aa	revenge is like a piece of delicious cheese cake .. wz extra chocolate  =D<br>  <br>  and yea am kinda the one who likes " but not like always " to  take revenge ..if i was really hurt ...|`|XuGFt3boaa	Yea.  If anyone talks about me, I get my revenge.|`|FJPKtZN5aa	THREE CHEERS FOR SWEET REVENGE!!!<br>  <br>  <br>  ans kinda but not really|`|l2foFWFjaa	No, it certainly is not. Revenge is the best way to take a situation from horrible to worse. It makes you feel even more awful than you were before. There's too much anger and hate, you just need to let it go. Sometimes, yes, I do take revenge but I really try to avoid it.|`|K3RzcMRTaa	yes, i guess it'd be sweet if your a sadistic loser and you have nothing better to do than make peoples life miserable.|`|Jucak0HLaa	Kind of,but then what comes around goes around,and they do it 10 times worse.|`|8Zcu55Braa	yes ...very sweet more than honey|`|blbd7e1Qaa	Oh YEAH! Really sweet indeed...<br>  (Especially in military context)<br>  <br>  I tend to be "the revenge incarnated". The deadlier the revenge is, the better it is... And not only "love to revenge", but with excessive multiplying factor... So, my personal enemies "learn to regret their own existence" when encountering my wrath...<br>  <br>  So, as example, if some islamic terrorists would kill one of us, I would be the first to demand the revenge to "kill em all to extinction...".<br>  (Believe me, I would love to see the last samples of islamic radicals being mummified and displayed as extinct species in the museum of natural history)<br>  And after that, I don't need to fear their revenge, as extinct creatures do no longer revenge... (So, I do not believe in the spiral of reprisals.)<br>  <br>  So, (regarding Q2) I am "a typical avenger".|`|g7uMKvEzaa	No, I am never happy with revenge,,It only makes things worse. It will bring you down to the other persons level and I would not want to be like them. I am older and wiser. If you seek revenge..it will only be a temperary feeling and if you have a conscience...you will or should feel worse...I just ignore that person and that is like erasing them out of my world..No thoughts ,,No deeds, No attention...No worries..No problems.....Move on with you life, don't dwell in the past of ugly stuff.|`|s7UWLOS9aa	I absolutely love revenge. It's funny you should say, because I am a big fan of it, and I NEVER stop until I get my revenge! :)|`|5uzHW4CYaa	no and no... i couldn't do it even if i tried.

OXvH2CgLaa	Coldplay is an overrated band that is strictly for the mainstream. I say that because my sister only knows about their one song Viva La Vida because of friends in school. They have too much recognition and their stuff sounds the same to me!<br>  <br>  Beware Trolls: He asked what I think so I simply told him my honest opinion :\|`|ebxwADDcaa	no, I never thought Coldplay was good and am suprised they even got to be famous. they are boring and repetitive, which would be cool, but its boring and repetitive with a synthesizer to the major scale, and when their singer does sing, he sucks.<br>  <br>  and I'm american.|`|xp4mhkqgaa	I agree.  I quite liked them, years ago, when they first came out.  I remember buying Parachutes, and then A Rush Of Blood To The Head.  But, they're crap now.  They're so boring.|`|WGYlzefnaa	Well, from an American point of view, they're great.<br>  <br>  They can come and move over here for good and then you'll be done with them, how's that? Then everyone is happy :-)|`|t7U9rliVaa	I've liked Coldplay since 7th grade and I'm in 10th now, so yeah...I didn't just get into them 'cause of Viva La Vida or anything.|`|4807bf37399c1bbed94e157394933bedaa	From the point of view of someone that lives outside of the US, Coldplay is amazing and both their new album and EP are really good.  Although it's really different from their previous three albums, it's really catchy.  Overall, they are a great band that tried something new that worked out for them.|`|L0AZ6tHGaa	This is a personal preference question. Considering their album sales from Viva La Vida , it's safe to say the majority of people believe this is their best album. I own all of Coldplay's albums and i thought Viva La Vida was basically amazing.<br>  <br>  And what's wrong with us Americans loving Coldplay?|`|LQtqYMP3aa	yes i love there <a href="http://www.derok.net/images/music/coldplay%20lyrics.jpg" rel="nofollow">http://www.derok.net/images/music/coldpl...</a>|`|LcBCLiTqaa	Well, I think they were better in 2005. <br>  Now the songs that they make today, I like.<br>  But in a few days they're forgettable.<br>  <br>  -VALy, <3|`|avhgLEu8aa	I've never really been a fan of Coldplay to be honest. Some of their songs are OK, but I don't think I would buy any of their albums.

Its never been a conscious rapper thing and theres been a misconception of what hip hop really is...its all goes in cycles"<br>  <br>  I agree, hip hop has many stages and cycles and this dance fad will fad and itll move to something else.  Music sampling is down, and artist like Wayne, T-Pain and others provide creativity, meaning it cant possibly be regressing, and therefore can only be moving forward, therefore getting better. <br>  Different but better.|`|YfmeV34eaa	I think it's going down, because it's like there is no structure in most of the lyrics of the rappers. the are just rappers not Hip-Hop Artist.|`|UXg8bA3aaa	<a href="http://www.iwantmuzik.com" rel="nofollow">http://www.iwantmuzik.com</a><br>  <br>  it is the best site for this

anLAHKQEaa	I love Britney Spears.  I actually did not like her at ALL untill this year.  My friend had her CD Blackout, and after listening to it for a while, it was great.  Then seeing everything that she had been through on Britney: For the Record on VH1, she went through hell.  But she never gave up.  Her parents pushed her at a very young age, and I think her parents are partly to blame in what happened becuase she was always used to listening to what everyone told her.  I LOVE HER!!! I bought her CD Circus-the delux edition and it is AMAZING-I love it.  She just seems like the type of person that you could really talked to and go to her and she would be amazing and talk to you.  She is doing so great right now, and I am so happy for her.  She is really getting her life back together.|`|eISzHe5maa	She's a really good entertainer despite the fact that she can't sing. Used to when she was younger on that Mickey Mouse Club, her voice was fantastic then. But her concerts are always very fun, I went to one when I was younger. As for her personal life, I'm not going to judge because I don't know her personally, but I just hope that she continues to get better.|`|8RW6FV6raa	I think she is a slutty person. She's let Hollywood and the party life style suck her in. Her life gotten so out of control. I do admire her for getting help. She is trying to clean her life up now for the sake of her children.

YuuoWS14aa	I dont think that you ever get over them, I think its saying that they have a special place in your heart because they are the first person you have ever fell in love with, you experience good and bad times with them and it was probably the most akward.  I think they are special because you both know and shared the same experience.  Its probably not a sore spot in your heart, but a warm spot, because youve both been there.|`|utGddhnVaa	I'm to young to know. but i think its true|`|jGRB7uSMaa	I heard that it's a scientific fact that it takes 10 years to fully get over someone you were in love with.|`|jErUxdV2aa	I think it depends on how you were treated in the relationship. I don't think anyone in their right mind would love someone who treat them like they don't matter. If you're first love treated you like you were everything to him and it just so happen that you had to relocate somewhere else for some reason of course you would continue to love him regardless. Once you have that love for someone you will continue to love that person because love these days is hard to find.

r9lfDeRmaa	I am going to assume no, because it is a prize from being on the show. I mean if you won a ford from the price is right should you pay ford every time you drive it, or your friends ride in it. He most likely gets paid per episode or on contract for the season that would be his job, to revamp crumby restaurants.

So in places like Africa, they are better protected from the sun. Those with lighter skin are at a greater risk. It doesn't mean that you're getting skin cancer just because you go outside but it's not good to always be in direct sunlight on hot days.|`|DGk7Wszmaa	As far as I know its not about the heat the sun causes, but its about the rays themselves.<br>  <br>  Well, yeah, they are more exposed to the rays of sun, I dunno..|`|BpTlXUj9aa	I would say War
vH2OF9z8aa	sure just stay away from Temptation): Daydreams and things seen in the glass of contemplation. The scattering of energies by strong desires and unrealistic goals. The pursuit of illusions and the dissipation of energy on false choices. Intoxication, delirium, and hallucination, leading to the negation of effort. Under rare and extreme circumstances, may indicate the revelation of transcendental spiritual truth. <br>   The card to the right represents the thoughts and feelings that underly your attitudes. Six of Swords (Science): Trusting in intelligence and intuition and setting off into the unknown. Leaving an untenable situation and charting a new course. Passage from difficulty and progress towards a solution. The road to recovery. Travel and exploration. <br>   The card at the top represents how your attitude is evolving and will evolve in the future. Page of Swords: The essence of air behaving as earth, such as a steady wind: The approach of an unexpected challenge, to be met with clear thought and just action. A person filled with an eager appetite for all matters of mind and logic. The gathering of information through unfaltering vigilance, careful examination, and subtle spycraft. The use of reason or eloquent speech to penetrate the veil of confusion and cut to the heart of the matter. <br>   The card to the left represents how others perceive your attitude. King of Cups: The essence of water behaving as air, such as a billowing cloud in the blue sky: Great maturity, endless patience, tolerance of other points of view, and a deep knowledge of human nature. One who intuitively knows the strengths of those around him, and gently cultivates them. Remaining calm and relaxed in all situations, and making artful use of diplomacy or a quiet word to resolve conflicts. The ability to listen to what another person is saying, and truly understand what is in their heart. A rewarding partner and a beloved leader. <br>   The card at the bottom represents what you cannot confront or are hiding from yourself. Knight of Wands: The essence of fire, such a great conflagration. One filled with vitality and passion for life. A sexy and exciting person, daring in their actions, cocky in their attitude, and utterly without fear. Absolute sincerity, coupled with violent emotions that swing wildly from one extreme to another. Boundless creativity and lust for a change of both pace and place. The rapid approach, or more likely departure, of something that sets your world ablaze. Often suggests travel or escape.

(: <br>  I mean, i really do like today's music, but the old stuff definitely had more care and thought put into it.. <br>  <br>  Im not too sure what you were asking, but yes - we ARE becoming less creative as a society. Well, from what I have seen anyway.. <br>  <br>  well, hope i answered your question :] <br>  have a nice day, <br>  ~Rweo. x

I'm a Gemini and dated a Cap boy, and  well to be quite honest everything went well in the beginning and  in love and all that jazz. Then things got bitter, since Caps are prone to being selfish and withdrawn from their feelings AND get depressed, we always argue about stuff off and on.  From what I read about Caps they like their egos to be stroked and like to be in control. And yes my ex loved to play mind games, just to get you to do what he wanted you to do. Also they can be very boring too and in bed. <br>  <br>  And they way he's acting conceited is him trying to get you to prove to him that if you're worth the risk of being in a relationship with him or not. So yeah, they love mind games.  And warring they joke about everything and don't care if they hurt your feelings, since Capricorns are detached from their emotions. If you show any bit of unsteadiness they will be turned off by you. If you are willing to go through the drama that Capricorns bring, than be strong minded and play the game like an expert.|`|0ccVGwsyaa	not at all.. dont always go by that stuff|`|QmpQ3qoNaa	i'm going to say this as bluntly as i can, that **** don't matter|`|WlQsYcWiaa	Not hardly.
cbp7Gukbaa	I agree with that.I watched predator in full on sky the other day and its a total classic.The acting and everything in it is really good.Arnie is so cool in that movie.This was when he was in his prime as an actor.Some would argue that terminator or total recall are his best but i agree with you.The first predator is his best movie.Did you know the same guy who directed predator also directed die hard? They are both 5 star action movies and both classics.|`|40kCOPicaa	one of his best movies, i watched a few times Predator, still as good as ever|`|dM0IBXwiaa	Yeah I like it better then Terminator 1, 2, and 3. One reason being the special effects look more real in movies where they don't try to create things that cgi can't make look very real yet like hair for example. Or in retrospect the liquid terminator was a techinlogical advancement but was just a silver blob that talked. Tghe Predator movie had a lot of suspense. Both of the Predator movies were very good. The first was a little better but the second one was really enjoyable in a way also. The whole idea of the Predator running around L.A. was cool.|`|fkTb2TiYaa	really i hate Arnold schwarzenegger, i think he sucks, but ya i would say that was his best movie|`|Bh1eq1pNaa	Predator is my all time favorite movie I've been watching it since I was 5 years old my old man insist that I watch it and still to this day I get chills when Predator says "Anytime"|`|akcGfgdcaa	No it's Twins!

aizHCizlaa	Yes they brought her back to the wild card round but then eliminated her. The Top 12 is set and Twatiana is not one of them.

I heard that in order to that you have to block cookies from MV, and work offline once the video is fully loaded.

ptPazvB8aa	i used to not like naruhina. and i used to like narusaku. after that last chapter, i think if hinata lives, it doesnt matter who he'll end up with, as long as its one of the two- sakura or hinata. sakura because hes known her for so long and hes had a crush on her since forever ,and in shippuden shes actually showing some love back. and hinata because she told him she loves him and naruto went six tails after "loseing her", a close friend, after losing his teacher and village and wat not.|`|TuebEiKKaa	I am a HUGEEE narusaku fan and i was really pissed when I read this chapter :[<br>  arghhh.<br>  it didn't change my opinion though.|`|TCqicdBpaa	No, I've always like the NaruHina idea.<br>  <br>  1. they are both outcasts (hinata from her clan and naruto from the entire village)<br>  <br>  2. their personalities compliment each other<br>  <br>  3.

7zBUVlccaa	I LOVE music. It seriously is my life, and I take my ipod everywhere. Its like my lifeline (: <br>  <br>  The thing about music is, people think you must have a preffered genre of music, and you dont. I love everything from MSI and slipknot to The Red Jumpsuit Apparatus and Meg+Dia. (: <br>  <br>  Try these genres and see what your into- <br>  Heavy Metal, Rock - <br>  Slipknot, Silverstein, Alesana<br>  Alternative, Emo- <br>  Dashboard Confessionals, The academy is.. , <br>  Im not too sure if I put those in the right genres but those are some bits i love (: <br>  <br>  I really like AFI, theyre american. But, you might not. <br>  <br>  I say get yourself an ipod (if you dont have one) and get different stuff. Put it on your ipod and just listen to it, see what you like and what you dont. Get some nice, calm music.. but then get something like "Omen- The Prodigy" on your ipod. Its great! Just listen to music when you can, or when your writing or something just have music playing in the background. I think it really helps me. <br>  <br>  But you might not be a music type of person. Until last year I couldnt have cared less about music, and I couldnt stand it, really. But i changed, and so can you if you want! :D<br>  <br>  Have a great day, and I hope I answered correctly. <br>  ~Rweo. x|`|WdmUoCZIaa	learn how to play musical instrument. don't need to be a master, but when you see what's the meaning behind a song, u can see that people tell stories in their life using songs as a media.<br>  sometimes, if i feel sad, i play songs that fit my mood, then play another one that can cheer me up. i guess that what music is for..|`|cUO2zYsnaa	Listen to the radio, just music stations though. You'll find that the variety blows your mind, and then you will start to get into it. You will eventually find your favourite type of genre, mine is R&B. It took me a long time to find that out, believe me. I always thought I liked techno, but then it got boring after a while.|`|TFqVw3qnaa	If your a geek i got no pointers but if your a punk try some Avenged Sevenfold or greenday.    If ur a prep try Hanna Montanna.  If your a jok try something like hip hop.

I've been dying to see it!!!!|`|7gDeqlfnaa	It sucked like what wow! don't bother, unless you are curious anyway.|`|ub1sZbkVaa	well if you like boobs and 'some' scary moments ..yah go ..better than staying home watching crap on tv ....;O)|`|oaKSRhXyaa	yes , if you like the cast and it depends what age you are|`|OaCOFOLKaa	its just like the others ones, nothin new. people die. jason kills|`|M1OKvcqYaa	Its alright, predictable and a but dumb its easy viewing, + Jared Padalecki   so all's good, xD<br>  A good choice to watch with your bro.|`|wV3Fs9Ebaa	nothin big<br>  the old one was better<br>  not scary at all<br>  i yawned never screamed|`|w2WFDunnaa	No I saw it when it came out with some of my friends..<br>  wasn't good at all seeing has you're a girl..if you do decide to go just be in for some really nasty scenes such as..topless girls,girls and guys having sex etc.The killing wasn't all that either at the end jason bust out of a wall and takes whitney AGAIN..stupid stupid movie.but I mean hey if you really want to see it go. But I suggest you just wait to rent it's more cheaper then the movies.<br>  <br>  BTW-IT was a porno in disguise.|`|Is3pmbbKaa	It's pretty stupid if you minus the scary parts. Jason Voorhees just goes on a killing spree, and if my friends wouldn't stop screaming, I prolly would've fallen asleep. I was mostly texting through the whole thing, anyway. And I'm not saying this to try to be cool. It was seriously nothing big.|`|b4Ha48Avaa	It's pretty good minus the sex scenes and boobs.<br>  It's scary and interesting.

The director totally did a good job of remaking him. Go see it!|`|oTV3Bro5aa	Please don't waste your money. There was like no story line. It was just the same thing. Jason killing people...boring. The only plus was that the guy playing Clay was sexy!|`|V4LECaohaa	it has alot of nude scenes from what i have heard|`|AUcPY9Veaa	no.they say that Friday thirteen is a bad day.|`|bQisGgSsaa	No, it was like a Regular day to me.|`|aIjOfkM8aa	no its horrible the old one was better

G9FiXGvmaa	I think the word "bum" is reserved for people who truly don't care about being unemployed.  I also think that's really one of the few things that you care about, or at least I'd like to think so.|`|jS4YILT5aa	I was lucky enough to get a temp job in Dallas :) <br>  <br>  I was bum for a year while I lived in Atlanta.

wA8Dyhq7aa	I cannot lower my standards that far after growing up listening to Kitty Wells, Loretta Lynn, and Rose Maddox.|`|AA11510033	Yes I think see is a great singer|`|1UKAho1iaa	I can't stand her. She can't sing at all, her songs are poorly written and immature and they all sound the same (not to mention they are really crappy pop songs that she tries to pass off as country), and she seems really phony and like she thinks she's better than everyone else. I can't figure out why so many people like her.|`|WaYZQhnHaa	As a pop artist, yes.  As a country artist, not really.<br>  <br>  I think she is a pretty good role model for younger music fans.  I've heard she's a very serious artist who works hard, and she does show talent as a songwriter.|`|2K3LqnNsaa	sure, why not.<br>  i love the love story song she has out now|`|At7iKpONaa	As a person I have no problems w/ her. As a singer, I can't stand her. And her being called country makes me gag.|`|61fcf832e5d4b87f1c941578ef4bacd3aa	Not a fan. Sorry. I think she's highly overrated.|`|JQXFG2ABaa	She's not remotely Country merely a 'pop' singer so the answer is no|`|19a16fd526f17ef5281ba84b9310daa2aa	like is a weak word! more like LOVE! she's awesome!|`|FpEkLUdIaa	she's okay...she annoys me though. I agree with the first answer..she's too fake|`|5VUlOWSLaa	YES!!!!!!!!!!!!!!<br>  <br>  I LOVE HER!!!!!!!!!!|`|zwi5vdYuaa	yea i luv her!<br>  alot of girls can relate to her songs|`|gCwXJR1Daa	As a person- No<br>  <br>  For her music- yes|`|OwznjQ9daa	Nope i LOVE her =]|`|XDSphN1laa	Hell no!!!! Every time I turn on the radio, one of her songs is playing no matter what kind of station it is. She considers her self country when she is definitely NOT!!!! I wish she could just get off country radio and just consider herself pop!!! country radio stations play more of her then they do true country singers like George Strait, Alan Jackson ect... It saddens me what has happened to true country music :( Just listen to Patsy Cline and Reba, then listen to one of taylor swift songs and tell which one is country.....I bet I know which one!!|`|fI2uesEwaa	Taylor Swift is amazing, Her songs are incredible, and they're just like what everyone goes through in life. Plus, she's not one of those celebrities that gets botox, or in trouble a lot. She's a great role-model.|`|dW3HSba3aa	Yea of course!!! Shes my favorite singer!! I love all of her songs, they are easy to relate to. I started writing my own songs cuz of her and I might get a guitar for my bday! YAY im so excited!!|`|8SOjngS0aa	I love Taylor Swift :) A lot of her songs are just what I'm going through, so I can really relate to them.|`|IWRJuZCiaa	no no no no no no no!!!!!!!  I hate her!!|`|DtG0d7hXaa	I definetly LOVE her. Her music is amazing and I can relate to them.<br>  And she's an inspiration to me!|`|mtQfJlH6aa	nope i cant stand her!! shes too fake!

u6YpiCg9aa	He does not have a wife. He is still single. His career is making him busy.  NOPE, he is not gay. At his audition, Adam claimed that he had a crush on Paula when he was ten. I think his rock-emo style made people think he is gay. He did not admit he is gay or his actions doesn't show. We will just wait and see in the coming weeks in the competition. :)<br>  <br>  Adam and Danny are my fave this season. :)|`|gfuwrAkFaa	Probably, YES?<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.dailymotion.com/video/x8gb45_adam-lambert-is-gay_fun" rel="nofollow">http://www.dailymotion.com/video/x8gb45_...</a>|`|YhuH2k4Caa	i dunno but hes a guy that really seems to like tight pants.|`|4KF4v3Dcaa	i love him|`|Tf08zxgZaa	I think he is not gay.. really hoping he is not! :) He does not have a wife. Still single. :) Probably he is just waiting for me.. lol! :)|`|EQbW1RCxaa	He does enjoy the nut huggers.  Adam wears more mascara than my mom and she's dances in Vegas, so I'd say probably gay.|`|r7bmz65eaa	guys who wear skinny jeans are gay|`|eI5rgLcraa	he behavives like a queen, but not as "super gay" as nathan marshall.  that guy is over the top

ZyGyDLsDaa	Heavenly Creatures (1994)<br>  IMDb synopsis:<br>  Pauline Parker (Melanie Lynskey) and Juliet Hulme (Kate Winslet) met in school during the 1950s in New Zealand. Instant best friends, they proceeded to spend every minute possible together, often writing about a fantasy land of their own invention. More and more estranged from their respective families, the two girls realise that they are extremely different from most other people, and agree to take any steps necessary to ensure that they are not seperated. The two families are increasingly concerned about the girls' friendship in a strictly moralistic era. // The film is based on fact, and Pauline's narration contains passages from the journals she wrote.<br>  ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~...<br>  At one point, while in the woods, they are loudly singing "The Donkey Serenade" (they idolize Mario Lanza) and undressing as they run until they are in their underwear, laughing and having fun. They burst out of the woods, where they are confronted by a man. Here's the scene:<br>  <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oHqS406XE_Y" rel="nofollow">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oHqS406XE...</a><br>  <br>  Juliet has had tuberculosis. At one point, in class, she starts out laughing at Pauline's history report then begins coughing harder and harder till she's spraying her book with blood, which signals that she is becoming very ill again. Here's the scene at 6:32:<br>  <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZdxWX8Mx2Fw&feature=related" rel="nofollow">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZdxWX8Mx2...</a><br>  <br>  Here's Part 1 on YouTube, which looks as if it might have the complete film:<br>  <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ALXQHg5EGSU&feature=related" rel="nofollow">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ALXQHg5EG...</a>|`|p5ZJfiIaaa	How long ago?

I even though I am totally against the whole "damsel in distress" thing, I don't think soap operas really apply, because at least the girl is usually trying  to do something for herself and trying to escape, not just waiting for prince charming to ride in on his white horse and rescue her.  I also know that soap operas are not real, so it doesn't really matter, anyways.|`|Y5jv0ybFaa	If you are referring to Claudia on GH at the end of the show, I did not fantasize about it at all but was hoping Jason would rescue her before the bomb goes off. It is a soap and is entertainment.|`|jfriQ8pmaa	I don't fit into either one of your scenarios.  I just go with the flow.....I usually have some idea who will rescue her....or perhaps get out herself, which in my recollection, is often what happens.|`|msUIsv8maa	Its a soap what do you expect|`|poVMemoXaa	Well most of the time when i'm stuck watching a soap opera since I lost the remote and that kind of things happens on the show I tend to react in an angry mood because of what's going on, here's somethings I might say or do...<br>  1) Scream at the 'hero', "HOW CAN YOU NOT KNOW WHO TOOK HER?!"<br>  2) Question myself why the damsel in distress can't just come up with some way to get out of there.<br>  3) Scream at the 'villain' , "Is she really freaking worth it?!"<br>  4) Look for the remote more or turn off the TV.|`|nnoMVbLkaa	Out of the two that you listed I would have to go with the romantic/adventure. If it is a character that I like male/female I am like someone hurry and save them.

u9RwzLPnaa	While they don't really go into this on Sponge Bob.<br>  <br>  I believe Mr. Krabs is an immigrant (if that is a British accent lol ) and his daughter was born here in America ... er Bikini Bottom. :)<br>  <br>  Due to the shows nature, at one point Mr. Krabs must have been married but lose his wife to tragedy or divorce which the nickelodeon censors must have deemed okay because of a lot of single parent households. Most likely, due to Sponge Bob trying to get Mr. Krabs to woo his traffic school teacher. Ms. Puff instead of his Mr. Krabs wife. We can safely assume that she must have passed away and that she was a whale.<br>  <br>  Moreover, Pearl is just a stereotypical rich girl. Nothing more.|`|WJQ66OvLaa	krabs has a british accent? lol i thought it was like sailor accent, but that's a good question my and my siblings can't seem to answer it either lol and omg she does have her little annoying tantrums doens't she lol|`|btrMdy5Uaa	The answer is Pearl is Mr Krabs daughter, not sure if they went into any detail other than that (like a wife, etc) and the reason she throws tantrums is because she's the classic rich, spoiled, teenager....although her dad is cheap|`|AxeOdUFQaa	ya mr krabs is her father<br>  <br>  mr krabs killed his whale wife cuz she was too fat<br>  <br>  and then he turned the body into a krabby paddy|`|zq5OGNeFaa	Pearl is Mr. Krab's daughter, but not really sure how that came to be. She is of course a "daddy give me this girl" and sometimes she does get what she wants.|`|ry42ObN7aa	Yeah, Pearl is his daughter.

0HGqGJYTaa	The rule would be mud, or water and earth (Capricorn and Pisces).<br>  <br>  But, I know some married Libra/Pisces couples. What I would suggest is that you look at your chart and your potential mates. Look at your moon, venus, mars, and rising. Do you lend towards earth or air? Do you know their birthdays? If not, go with what feels right to you. Just follow how you feel naturally. As long as you are being true to your own desires, I'm sure you'll find nirvana somewhere :)|`|oAMmIbRVaa	I hope this will answer you question. Pisces compatiblity?is?with Taurus, Cancer, Scorpio and?Capricorn. The Pisces profile however is incompatible with Aries, Gemini, Leo, Libra, Sagittarius and?Aquarius. Pisces symbols?can work well with another Pisces and the?Virgo sign.
L1qQBNbbaa	I was shock this film received any attention at all, I thought the story was dull and actually quite disturbing ( pedophilia , Nazis, emotional detachment) I found Kate Winslet character unlikable from the beginning and less and less i did have any sympathy for her as the film progressed.<br>  I couldn't buy that Ralph Feines was the grown up Micheal and I didn't like that Kate Winslet's Character destroyed the grown up Micheal's ability to enjoy and communicate with women. I think it was strange and unrealistic that in her defense  trail she didn't admit she couldn't read ,when the majority of her charges was for reports and signing death warrents at first, i thought she's doing it because of her guilt but everything she said at trail made her look heartless.<br>  I do believe a couple of things though, I believe the Academy has history of awarding people the Oscar for a body of work versus the actor or film at the time Kate Winslet  has deserved an Oscar for a few films , Titanic , Eternal sunshine of the spotless mind, Little Children.<br>  Also I feel that the Academy awards best actress awards for doing nude they did it to Halle Berry too for Monster's Ball.<br>  I've seen all the nominated performances and feel Meryl Streep deserved it this time around.|`|Klb4ZYcVaa	The film just made me cry, I do believe Kate Winslet deserved that Oscar. Not many actresses are comfortable doing nude scenes, she saw this movie as a pure love story, she wanted to keep it that way. I'm also reading the novel, she was GREAT. Besides, Kate WInslet is a six-time Oscar nominated actress, the youngest person ever, especially on her work on Titanic. She FINALLY gets an Oscar.<br>  <br>  & immature teens (& I'm 18) would view this movie as sexy, just b/c there's a mild sex scenes. Christ, if they had any clue how extremely beautiful was this movie. Kate flashes her boobs, big deal. Everyone has boobs. So what?

In the credits part of your film put music, artist, producer followed by "all rights to this music have been copyrighted to the producers of the corresponding score.

hsZnjZvoaa	First of all, good luck!<br>  <br>  Sing the style you're most comfortable with, but it seems that country is more universally "appreciated" by judges at 'talent shows'.  If you can do it well, cover a Martina McBride piece... she has such a vocal range that you can probably find something you like. <br>  <br>  Again, good luck.... errr... make that "break a leg".|`|zC37KW2naa	well if people tell you have a country sound, you definitely go for Carrie Underwood's "Jesus,Take the Wheel" or Taylor Swift's "White Horse" or "15"|`|GS20sIkMaa	How do I live without you by LeAnn Rimes

XdMcYDgbaa	what...did he cheat on you...if yes then that is normal cause geminis expect you to cheat as well...and maybe have a threesome with you and the other guy. gemini is a whore for excitement and versatility. they need not be bored, that is the only moral value they have. to him...whatever he did...it is a very normal thing. i do not think it will work with you guys...you usually know its going to work with a gemini right at the beginning of a relationship.<br>  <br>  anyways good luck|`|c05702374b5bc85f3a1502d55060a46eaa	I am Gemini and not like that at all, anyone any sign can be "shiri", I think nothing be different you take him back, he just make campaign promises.|`|SlhdAZzpaa	Gemini are mutuable in quality, they are also weird and so outgoing, they also have the tendencies to be liars and can be deceptive, they can change in exact way they think, so bec, ur a libra, ill match so to aquarius.<br>  <br>  im aquarius, nd my GF is Libra we are almost 1 year, and there had never been misunderstanding in our relationship.|`|n46eVHBmaa	It depends on the situation.

qLqYSeqRaa	I think it depends on my mood. I don't think I can really choose between old and new, though, because I love both so goddamn much.<br>  Waking The Fallen would have to be my favorite album, but that's followed closely by Avenged Sevenfold.<br>   My favorite old song is definitely Second Heartbeat. AHHH I love that song so much! Followed by I Won't See You Tonight Part 1! <br>  My favorite new songs are probably A Little Piece of Heaven, Bat Country, MIA, Seize The Day, and Afterlife<br>  It's really hard to choose though!<br>  <br>  I LOVE A7X!!!!

It is a really good idea and I never even thought of it!|`|k4GqiB6taa	That is a good thing you are doing Riki.<br>  Good deed!<br>  MQ:Yes,like that Commercial for animal abuse with the song "In The Arms Of An Angel" playing in the background.<br>  I saw an episode of Supernaturall and they played the song Silent Lucidity by Queensryche towards the end.|`|h1yGVkkfaa	Great video.Riki<br>  I've been clicking the link ever since you posted it up here.I click it everytime i visit yahoo.<br>  <br>  <br>  Edit:Thats the up most LEAST i can do.Some people are to lazy and can't click a link(as peaches said) and its true its not like its costing them anything.|`|12QJ9QMRaa	Absolutely Riki.<br>  <br>  on the more commercial front, the best I have heard is in Trent Reznor's own words.<br>  <br>  When Johnny Cash covered "Hurt", Trent recieved a CD of it, and was like...it's ok... but it just sounded.... wrong.<br>  <br>  Then a couple of weeks later, he recieved a DVD in th email, and it had the Video for it...and he said at that point, the song was no longer his, the way the anguish in Cash's voice combined with the imagery of the video, pretty much forever made that a Johnny Cash song.<br>  <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GlzjqPGdOSM" rel="nofollow">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GlzjqPGdO...</a><br>  <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SmVAWKfJ4Go&feature=related" rel="nofollow">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SmVAWKfJ4...</a><br>  <br>  "Angel's Son" by Sevendust kinda catches the back of my throat each time, as it is a very prsonal song that hits home with my own past.  The video just nails it (either version)<br>  <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w7KliFJQaM4&feature=related" rel="nofollow">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w7KliFJQa...</a><br>  <br>  If anyone has seen the old cult classic "Harold and Maude", the use of Cat Steven's music throughout it raised the bar for both the movie and those songs.<br>  <br>  and of course...then there is your Video my friend.  I honestly probably would not have rum out to get that song had I heard it on the radio.  It was one that seemed good...but not gripping.<br>  <br>  But combined with your video, it was so suited for it, it became much more poignant.  It was actualyl the perfect match.<br>  <br>  ***And I like the Idead Devil's Reject has of posting it to the profile.  After all the yammering I did, I never though tof that.  If ya don't mind, I will do likewise.|`|OTFzJbaMaa	ive watched this before and i thought it was absolutey beautiful and i appreciate what you are doing very much. this video is amazing is really is. i plan on doing something in my life to help animals who need it so this video makes me wana help even more so. thank you for posting it again. everryonee needs too watchh this.<br>  <br>  ***<br>  its really no problem  i have a huge soft spot for animals as i see you do! <br>  and i hope you dont mind i posted that in the question i just asked and probably will alot from now on if its ok|`|o8y7MYi0aa	It all depends on your own experience. If you've been through a similar event as the one in the song, it tends to be more powerful. If combined with an emotional scene or video, the power of the song is dramatically increased.<br>  For example, My Heart Will Go On by Celine Dion is an incredibly emotional song, but the song was much more powerful in Titanic.|`|dFacbjIZaa	Of course it can, this one makes Me tear up every time.

Ew7hXGFtaa	I love 90's old school rap. For some reason I love all the rap groups like NWA and Public Enemy for example. I also really like Eminem too. But any of the stereotypical rappers like Souljia Boy and whoever else is big today are just awful.|`|5HvdcWvBaa	It goes something like this...<br>  <br>  I've only ever heard one song in the rap genre that I can claim to actually wanna hear again. And that is thanks to one of my lovely contacts :)<br>  <br>  However I know some people love it and thats cool. <br>  <br>  Its just not so much my cup of tea/coffee/random beverage. <br>  <br>  Although I don't deny, talent is definitley involved.|`|O3l33DVJaa	I personally feel "Hip Hop is Dead" and if any body feels any different about it apparently knows nothing about the history of hip hop/rap music.<br>  <br>  I was influenced at a time when hip hop was fun to listen to & was just as fun to dance to (The Early 80's - Late 70's) now hip hop is not about that ,its about who got more money,more woman,more killings,drugs,bling bling & crap that don't make no sense.<br>  <br>  What ever happened to the true Lyricist in today's hip hop??<br>  <br>  I am sorry if you truly think Lil Wayne,TI,Kanye West is the best that today's hip hop has to offer is a crying shame & someone made a statement "The 90's best rep the hip hop culture" is dead wrong,people you are forgetting who pioneered this ,Dj Kool Herc started spinning in the early 70's at the rec room in New York which opened the door to the legends that took emceeing to another level ,Grandmaster Caz , Dj Red Alert,Krs One,Rakim,Africa Bambatta,Grandmaster Flash,Kool Moe Dee,Run Dmc,Sugar Hill Gang,Kurtis Blow just to name a few that paved the way for such artist like Biggie,Tupak,Big Pun,Snoop,Wu-Tang,Nas,Jay Z,Eminem and we all know that 3 from this list are dead so what leaves us with not much.<br>  <br>  I am an old school brother from the Boogie Down where it all started and i wish there are some artist's that can reestablish what once was the greatest form of street art "True Poets" & i agree there are a hand full that is still trying to keep it alive but what i notice they are getting no love from the people of today that has embraced the new school "Hip Bop" (Not Hip Hop) commercialized street pop with weak lyrics (Like Cat in the Hat Verses) and so called rappers that you can not even make out one intelectual sentence that comes out of there mouth full of metal !<br>  <br>  To each there own but you did ask for opinion's and this might get thumbs down due to people not excepting the truth but if i get thumbs up is due to people who has knoledge of the old school & knows the difference between real rap & real crap.|`|f948d748facdf196074d849ea9c465c4aa	Dont know much about it, but judging by what i do know it was much better in the 90s because it actually adressed issues in the african american community and raised awareness of ghettos and stuff. Now its mostly just crap like soulja boy.|`|C7YbYUYPaa	Public Enemy and Run DMC were great.<br>  <br>  I can't make myself listen to anything modern.  The lyrics lack feeling and most of the beats sound the same.  Those guys I mentioned were revolutionary and did it with purpose, not for the money.|`|8R2UMbNHaa	Well it's not my type.  I have had some fun dancing to it at the clubs here and there but don't own any albums.  I love rock, I'm pretty agressive and that's what gets me going.

Rap just never appealed to me, altrhough it has to many of my friends.|`|yQH4Fpoiaa	Almost all of modern rap is awful.

POqwp3Fiaa	A woman was at her hairdresser's getting her hair styled for a trip to Rome with her husband. She mentioned the trip to the hairdresser, who responded, " Rome ? Why would anyone want to go there? It's crowded and dirty. You're crazy to go to Rome . So, how are you getting there?" "We're taking Continental," was the reply. "We got a great rate!" <br>  "Continental?" exclaimed the hairdresser. "That's a terrible airline. Their planes are old, their flight attendants are ugly and they're always late. So, where are you staying in Rome ?"<br>  <br>  "We'll be at this exclusive little place over on Rome 's Tiber River called Teste."<br>  <br>  "Don't go any further. I know that place. Everybody thinks it's gonna be something special and exclusive, but it's really a dump, the worst hotel in the city! The rooms are small, the service is surly and they're overpriced. So, whatcha' doing when you get there?" <br>  <br>  "We're going to go to see the Vatican and we hope to see the Pope."<br>  <br>  "That's rich," laughed the hairdresser, "You and a million other people trying to see him. He'll look the size of an ant. Boy, good luck on this lousy trip of yours. You're going to need it."<br>  <br>  <br>  A month later, the woman again came in for a hairdo. The hairdresser asked her about her trip to Rome . <br>  <br>  "It was wonderful!" exclaimed the woman, "Not only were we on time in one of Continental's brand new planes, but it was overbooked and they bumped us up to first class. The food and wine were wonderful, and I had a handsome 28-year-old steward who waited on me hand and foot. And the hotel was great! They'd just finished a $5 million remodeling job and now it's a jewel, the finest hotel in the city. They, too, were overbooked, so they apologized and gave us their owner's suite at no extra charge!"<br>  <br>  Well," muttered the hairdresser, "that's all well and good, but I know you didn't get to see the Pope."<br>  <br>  "Actually, we were quite lucky, because as we toured the Vatican a Swiss Guard tapped me on the shoulder and explained that the Pope likes to meet some of the visitors, and if I'd be so kind as to step into his private room and wait the Pope would personally greet me. Sure enough, five minutes later, the Pope walked through the door and shook my hand! I knelt down and he spoke a few words to me."<br>  <br>  "Oh, really! What'd he say?"<br>  <br>  <br>  He said, "Where'd you get the awful haircut?"|`|2BEMSGPdaa	I don't know many jokes but the hairdresser one went upstairs already.

kGkUG0fKaa	You obviously have a lack of confidence and paying for a kiss will not boost that confidence. Not to mention you want your first kiss to be something to remember and not something you wrote off as an expense in your account.<br>  <br>  If you have been rejected so many times, maybe its time to re-evaluate how you approach women. How you look and lift your level of confidence up. Try joining a fraternity to help you gain that male machismo and confidence you lack! join a sport or something like that. Its not easy to make friends when you are going about it the wrong way.<br>  <br>  Since you have $1500 to spare, try getting a make over. New haircut, clothes, adapt a new style. Go out places like local college hangouts, buy a chick a drink and walk away from her, show that male camaraderie and coolness! <br>  <br>  I wouldn't agree with you using that money to buy a kiss!! Instead I really think you should work on gaining self confidence! you probably have only been rejected because a woman can sense when a man isn't confident! when he is scared, you know. You're in college now so grab hold of those balls and strut ya sh-i-t!! Show them what they are missing out on...........|`|Nc637a6laa	Hello Unknowng..You are just too good to be kissed by just anybody that's why You haven't experienced it yet.  But don't be afraid Your best time is yet to come..and don't be trying to pay for one that will just cheapen the experience and You will feel so cheated. One day soon You will be getting so many kisses You will be wondering why You even had these thoughts.  Please don't say You hate Your life!  I have been lying in my bed for 2 months with a messed up back, not being able to walk, carried around by my wonderful husband and having everything done for me by him and everyone else.  I had my little pity party saying I too hated my life..but then I Woke Up and realized at least I had a life. Glory says lots and lots of kisses are coming your way soon, very soon, just like my back is going to get better!|`|8vfCRg7Caa	put that money back in your pocket young man and the economy is down. No need to be wasting money like that. You might have to change your style a bit. in my 20's i had a hard time picking up women cause i had no confidence and no game and no style. Eventually i got noticed when i changed my clothes that i wore and cared more about how i look. I quit trying to be like everybody else and i was patient and not afraid or shy to step out and ask people out. I cant say im successful in relationships but i will tell that i can pick up women easily. And thats all about confidence. If they talk to you they talk to you, if they dont they dont. Their loss. <br>  <br>  You cant be afraid of rejection. Its one of the only powers women have.|`|9G5m0Mgjaa	It's not your fault.  90% of women these days are so superficial it's scary.  Don't stoop down to paying them that much money for a damn kiss.  That's insane.

Just bring out Franklin over there and you got them.|`|CmNSdnWIaa	Honestly,for that much money you can get a lot more than just a kiss,lol.But seriously,chill out.The less you worry about,the better.Like one of the other answerer's said on here,go to a bar.Drunk girls like to kiss random guys.It'll work,but it might not mean as much as it would if you got it from some one who wasn't hammered.|`|JqhQSjQFaa	Oh come on, i dont think that you are that unlucky.

IsxB0Qi7aa	Now that you mention it, I looked at pictures of both of them & they do have the same bone structure & long thin nose like a witch. Some of the pictures they even have the same hairstyle & part their hair the same way. I don't know about the body though, I think Paris Hilton has a smaller frame & a better figure.|`|arjB50zBaa	Actually I didnt notice Paris Hilton, lol.<br>  But I have thought for awhile now that the way ashley acts and the things that she does for Victor reminds me of Sabrina. <br>  I feel like they got rid of Sabrina ( fine with me) to bring in Ashley who has more ties in the show but are making her character more Sabrina like. Which I am not particularly found of. I wish they would just make her a strong independent woman that she claims to be and quit letting the mustache control her.|`|SXwlw9N2aa	LOL..That is a good one. I wish Ashley would update her look. Do something with the highlighted hair and get some clothes more her age.|`|4kuWOZowaa	Nah..ashley can never be paris|`|6tqGKoREaa	Paris Hilton resembles Ashley.  Go back years ago and you will see Ashley was way ahead of Paris with the only difference being I cannot find a self made porn of Ashley on the internet.|`|r7sgshwKaa	The wicked witch of Genoa City is all I see her resembling and now she's pregnant with a goblin.|`|EPPb5pRBaa	She does need to update,plus she is getting old.|`|uUzbqGh5aa	One could only wish! I can see where you're coming from, but l don't think that Paris and Ashley resemble at all.|`|uKXgg9heaa	Not really, but she is pretty. I hate how she's acting towards Jack!

I have been literally been down in the bed for 2 months with my lower back (compressed disks and pinched nerves).  Pain killers( Demerol) very strong just put me out then the pain came right back.  I've been seeing a good chiropractor and also using a spray called Biofreeze (I swear by it) You can find it at pharmacies like Walgreens or CVS It cost about $13-15.00 but it is so worth it. It gives You relief for at least 2 hours. and You can use it at least 4 times a day.  I do suggest a good chiropractor though.  I could not even walk for 6 weeks and had to be carried everywhere, now I am using a walker.  Hope this helps and Good Luck to You and God Bless!|`|T93PeFvFaa	you can get this cream or pads that put a warm heat in the mucles and bones.

EzxeHsLHaa	I think it will be extremely popular, because people have been waiting for such a long time to see it. It was supposed to come out last fall!<br>  <br>  Anyway, the trailers look awesome I think. I am especially looking forward to the young Tom Riddle, which will be the best part of the movie in my opinion.<br>  <br>  I have a slight feeling that they might mess up Dumbledore's death though and make the funeral too cheesy.<br>  My favorite scene out of the whole book is Harry running after Snape, yelling "Fight back, Coward" and Snape answering "Don't call me Coward". I am really, really looking forward to this, but I have the slight feeling that they will get it completely wrong and it won't sound angry enough....<br>  <br>  They also added a scene that wasn't in the book (deatheaters attacking the burrow), which will spike great controversy among the fans.<br>  <br>  Lastly, I think it will be the funniest movie out of them all, especially with Ron and his love potions :)|`|5ZCGZXSfaa	I'm just glad that quidditch will be back in the sixth one.  I was so mad when they cut the whole story line of Ron being horrible at quidditch out of the fifth movie.
hGTuCqeEaa	Try reading the notes written on the staff to determine whether the chord is in root position or an inversion. Here's a trick that will work for triads (except suspensions) and 7th chords which are shown in consecutive order (no skipping of a chord tone): look for intervals greater or less than a third- the upper note in that interval will be the root.<br>  If a given chord or inversion can be played in more than one position on the neck, then let the chords which precede and follow that chord determine which option you choose; otherwise, you may well wind up getting frustrated with moving positions up and down the neck rapidly and often.|`|hJP9y6kjaa	If you don't understand tabs, you really should learn. It's not like it's difficult or anything.<br>  <br>  Usually it's one of two things.<br>  <br>  if it just says D, then you assume D major. I'd start by playing a D major open or barre chord.<br>  <br>  it may also be a D power chord, depends on the style of music.<br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  Saul

May sound a little different but its better then lalala ( Deep Breath ) lalala ( Deep Breath )|`|qVXmSEVGaa	practice little "short hops" exercises, like Yah-yah-yah on c-e-g. Feel how the muscles around your waist pulse with each tone. make sure that they are not pulling in, but pulsing gently outwards.  This gives you an idea of what these beath support muscles can do in a little exercise.<br>  Now try the same exercise, but catch a little breath between each tone. ( it might feel as though it is only a sip of air) If you can ahead and keep on singing, then your breathing msucles have responded correctly.<br>  Try extending this short exercise by adding in notes, or by taking a line from your favorite song and first "pulsing" it and then by pulsing and breathing between each note.  Yeah, sure it's very boring, and not at all musical. that's why it's an exercise.<br>  When you get the feeling that you can pulse away, or pulse and breathe without having to concentrate on it, then try singing the line as it should be sung.  See how your breathing muscles step up and respond by giving you a very solid, stable feeling around your waist. No pushing, no pulling. It's like having a swim ring inflated around you to keep you afloat in the water.<br>  In this way, you are training breath support. that will keep the air/sound waves moving. For when to breathe, a good rule of thumb is to follow the sense of the text. Breathe where there is a comma or period.  If you need to breathe in the middle of a phrase, try to keep the sense of the text clear.<br>  In regards to the nasal sound, you'll probably want to check out your soft palate, the spongy group of muscles on the roof at the back of your mouth.  When you go to yawn, you will feel this group of muscles rise.  With a little practice, you can make this happen at any old. time.<br>  If you you pay attention and keep your soft palate lifted while singing, the sound will stay in your mouth ( where it sounds the best, after all)<br>  and not in your nose.|`|CznD93mXaa	Try to find a pause in the song (a place where you stop singing temporarly).  Or if you are reading music, there are commas and periods that you can breathe after.

Some of its ingredients are olive oil, garbanzo beans (chick peas), tahini (sesame seed paste), lemon juice, garlic, salt and olives.  Those are all very good for you, however, hummus has an extremely high fat content.  Here is the nutritional lowdown:<br>  <br>  Chickpeas - main ingredient. One cup of chickpeas contains 286 calories and 5 grams of fat, but it's not saturated fat, so no cholesterol. Chickpeas improve blood sugar levels, fight cholesterol and are high in protein.<br>  <br>  Tahini - another main ingredient. It is high in calories and fat, but again unsaturated and has lots of protein and calcium.<br>  <br>  Olive oil has the highest fat content, but olive oil is a healthy oil and the fat is mainly monounsaturated.<br>  <br>  Now I have to go make some!|`|x2rmsjIXaa	ppl use it as a mayo substitute. <br>  it can be really yummy, if it's made right.<br>  hold on, i'll find you a basic recipe.|`|hoZE1vi0aa	Well, it Does have that 'fiber' thing going for it.

d23F89ECaa	I'm a classic rock fan.<br>  <br>  Meaning music when it was really music.  Meaning the emotion and feels from the moment is what makes the music.<br>  <br>  So it's pretty much impossible to lipsynch that kind of thing.  Every show I've ever seen from anyone of this genre has always been different in so many ways.|`|1AdzD6bmaa	Yes, it would.  Unless it was more of a dance show.  <br>  <br>  My worst concert experience was way back when the Allman Brothers Band was at their hottest.  Greg Allmon came on stage so obviously waay under the influence (of what, I can only speculate) that he could not perform, yet tried.  He was slurring his words (what words he could even remember) and missed several notes on the keyboard.  I'm sure it was because of him that the band played only two short sets.  I was P.O.'d big time.  I payed for a show....and that is what I expected.  <br>  <br>  On the way home I listened to the radio and even they were were talking about how horrible it was.  <br>  <br>  I think performers should give their audience what they paid for.  If I wanted to hear a recording, I'd listen to the CD or radio or watch MTV.  <br>  <br>  Favorite music: Classic Rock (but I like variety)|`|EjfJaNn7aa	kinda.. ot really... never mind yes it would<br>  <br>  rock|`|AA12254647	Um yes <br>  but i would go to tours <br>  like warped tour and not POP concerts <br>  ugh my parents still think im to young tho im 14 and they stil have only let me go to stuipid country concerts gag <br>  <br>  Alt Rock / screamo <br>  fav type Chiodos|`|j6poSs16aa	yes! it would!!<br>  I like alt rock and some pop|`|KPKv5hwqaa	Of course!

jr2yqSJqaa	That's a good question!  I think a lot, probably but Robert Kardashian was also a successful attorney for many years before and after as well.<br>  <br>  Some of their money could also come from their stepdad, Bruce Jenner and now the fact that the Kardashian girls will appear just about anywere for a fee.

POqwp3Fiaa	A New York City yuppie moved to the country and bought a piece of land. He went to the local feed and livestock store and talked to the proprietor about how he was going to take up chicken farming. He then asked to buy 100 chicks. <br>  "That's a lot of chicks," commented the proprietor. <br>  "I mean business," the city slicker replied. A week later the yuppie was back again. <br>  "I need another 100 chicks," he said. <br>  "Boy, you are serious about this chicken farming," the man told him. <br>  "Yeah," the yuppie replied. "If I can iron out a few problems." <br>  "Problems?" asked the proprietor. <br>  "Yeah," replied the yuppie, "I think I planted that last batch too close together."|`|Y1aAGPURaa	Here are a couple that should make you smile:<br>  <br>  There were these two statues in a park; one of a nude man and one of a nude woman. They had been facing each other across a pathway for a hundred years, when one day an angel comes down from the sky and, with a single gesture, brings the two to life.<br>  <br>  The angel tells them, "As a reward for being so patient through the hundred blazing summers and dismal winters, you have been given life for thirty minutes to do what you’ve wished to do the most."<br>  <br>  He looks at her, she looks at him and they go running behind the shrubbery. The angel waits patiently as the bushes rustle and the giggling ensues. After fifteen minutes, the two return, out of breath and laughing.<br>  <br>  The angel tells them, "Um, you have fifteen minutes left. Would you care to do it again ?"<br>  He asks her, "Shall we ?"<br>  She eagerly replies, "Oh yes, let’s! But let’s change positions. <br>  <br>  This time, I’ll hold the pigeon down and you sh+t on its head !"<br>  <br>  --------------------------------------...<br>  <br>  A teacher noticed that a little boy at the back of the class was squirming around, scratching his crotch, and not paying attention .<br>  She went back to find out what was going on. <br>  He was quite embarrassed and whispered that he had just recently been circumcised and he was quite itchy. <br>  The teacher told him to go down to the principal's office.<br>  He was to telephone his mother and ask her what he should do about it. He did and returned to his class. <br>  Suddenly, there was a commotion at the back of the room. <br>  She went back to investigate only to find him sitting at his desk with his 'private part' hanging out. <br>  'I thought I told you to call your mom!' she said. <br>  'I did,' he said, 'And she told me that if I could stick it out till noon, she'd come and pick me up from school.|`|NnFEYwUHaa	what is the difference between roast beef and pea soup?<br>  <br>  (its so stupid but im easily entertained)<br>  You can roast beef, but you can't pee soup... lol :]|`|lTmrWBRlaa	An elephant goes to a camel - <br>  "Why do you have 2 boobs on your back"<br>  The camel replies - <br>  "That's rich coming from someone who has a dick on their face!<br>  <br>  Cracks me up everytime!!|`|bU1TtPdEaa	why did chicken cross said road?<br>  <br>  other side seemed much more appropriate

41fe712a36ecf2746af8f97a562a2794aa	You all remember the ones that come true, but not the 1000 ones that don't huh?<br>  <br>  Statistically, if you make enough plain, boring 'predictions', one of them will come true sooner or later.<br>  <br>  I predict:<br>  <br>  One of you will cut themselves tomorrow.<br>  Receive good news.<br>  Buy something they later regret.<br>  etc etc etc. <br>  <br>  This is just chance, but it WILL happen to some of you simply because with 6 billion people milling around this planet, it happen all the time.<br>  <br>  If it was possible to make 'predictions', don't you think Obama would have used it to save millions of $, or the FBI to avoid 9/11 ??<br>  <br>  Get real people. Why do you need to cling on to the impossible?<br>  <br>  Edit: Irrelevant. "You'll have a job sometime in the next 7 months" was said to you after you'd been out of work for a month. You don't sound stupid, so saying you'll get a job sometime in the following 7 months would be an accurate assumption (esp. as he knows more about you than I do).<br>  <br>  A prediction would be: "On the 4th March 2009 you'll receive a job offer", not: "sometime in the next half-a-year something might happen at any time".<br>  <br>  Buddha (above) is a classic example. If you knew someone was going to hit your car, why didn't you move it/get out/ do something to avoid it?|`|OgaJqkSQaa	Yes, I've had many predicitions that have come true. I know a good psychic though. My psychic tapes every reading and I transcript them and tick off things that come true. From my readings years ago, I look back and 80% is ticked. Slightly too much to be coincidence methinks. (Not that I can be arsed to try and convince anyone that psychics do exist ie Dave.)|`|CcgDj9GIaa	Yes; I had a psychic tell me that I was going to become pregnant the following year back in 2007.  Lo and behold I became pregnant in October 2008.|`|7i6qj4OXaa	Yes, on 7th December last year, I knew that someone was going to hit my car from behind.  It was about two minutes before it actually happened and was written off.|`|T3962BhHaa	i got told a few years ago i was going to fall in love with a gay man<br>  <br>  and yes it came true - sort of<br>  <br>  the gay was John Barrowman - im not complaining|`|7rrNvFK7aa	some psychics are really good and maybe your uncle is and doesn't even realize it.<br>  Cool thing. Jobs are so hard to find|`|ZkBLNj6Vaa	Yes.  A psychic approached me on the street and told me that I would get a bunch money really soon.  She was right, I got $700 two days later.  <br>  <br>  Of course I knew too, but the fact that she knew without knowing me and without me telling her anything in advance was remarkable.|`|vH2OF9z8aa	so you new job was the  End of an old situation and the beginning of a new one.

3ovQFPZvaa	I would have to say verbal. Whoever said "Words are wind" and whoever made up the sticks and stones quote is an idiot. Words have power. Listen to some of the most famous speeches for instance. Words can incite war, or bring peace. They can scar you for life, or they can help you heal after a lot of suffering.<br>  <br>  The point is, words do hurt more than physical abuse. Allow me to quote the Bible for a minute. It says that life and death are in the power of the tongue and what comes out of your mouth can defile you. It also says that a soft answer turns way wrath, but grievous words stirs up strife.<br>  <br>  Based on those readings, my understanding and experience, verbal abuse is way harsher and more unbearable than the physical abuse I got.|`|BBVfRheyaa	Verbal abuse.|`|50UbJp14aa	Phyical|`|tgbO359Aaa	physical, u don't get bruises from verbal abuse lol|`|5XyBxxYAaa	They are both as bad as each other.

O5KOwhovaa	"The Wicker Man"|`|vhlORK4Waa	Beat me to it MOI!!  yes the Wicker Man in which he played a policeman burnt to death.<br>  <br>  A hard-nosed, deeply religious Police Sergeant, Neil Howie (Edward Woodward) receives information that a young girl has gone missing. This is told in an anonymous letter from Summerisle, a remote island off the coast of Scotland. The Sergeant flies to Summerisle to investigate.<br>  <br>  He shows a photo of the missing girl to the locals, but they deny her existence. Howie starts noticing the islander's bizarre customs and lifestyle with increasing incredulity. Eventually, he meets Lord Summerisle (Christopher Lee), who explains that they are all practicing Pagans. Howie is deeply offended, and accuses them of murdering the girl as part of a bizarre ritual. He then attempts to leave the island in order to report his suspicions to the chief constable of the West Highland Constabulary, but finds that his plane has been sabotaged.<br>  <br>  Cleverly attempting to catch the islanders at whatever twisted game they are playing with the girl (whom he decides is still alive, but destined to be sacrificed), Howie is instead snared by the islanders. They imprison him in a giant "Wicker Man" and light it afire. It is their belief that his virginal, Christian life will appease their Pagan gods, and bring bounty to the next harvest. <br>  <br>  MOST IMPORTANT<br>  <br>  Make sure you watch the 1973 original and NOT the 2006 remake which is appalling.<br>  <br>  Halcon|`|1f1723a276a7a216646a15bc2761f1b8aa	Hi there.<br>  "Wicker man", burnt alive.

He would then try to get into the porn industry under the name "Buck Naked".<br>  <br>  Kramer would rejoin Newman in their goal of creating a New York rickshaw service.  <br>  <br>  Elaine would go back to work at a publishers office ironically enough named Vandelay Industries.|`|hnaOgmapaa	hahahah that's a funney question! lol my dad loves seinfeld and got me hooked on it lol....i think kramer would take over newman's job and be compleatly crazy like he already is and elaine would open a soup store|`|Zs6tGDvsaa	I heared that there is going to be a reuinion so the gang will get out of jail.|`|87abb67fdea86bc93c669613a70f1f3eaa	Jerry and Elaine and George would still be looking for their perfect partners.

d23F89ECaa	I'm a Scout Troop Leader.<br>  <br>  I have helped two of my youth get this award.<br>  <br>  First off, well done.<br>  <br>  Secondly, talk to a Scout office in your area.  They deal with this very seriously and I'm sure, even if you are or not a member of the Scouts, they'll give you more than enough information to get it sent off.<br>  <br>  I to have seen mistakes made and papers lost.  Angers me.  If the people responsible for just mailing a handful of papers took even a portion of the dedication and hard work that you put yourself through the past few years, it wouldn't happen.  But sadly it does.<br>  <br>  Hope you get your award and keep up with the program.

No, not under thirty seconds, I can't name top ten, I can list ones I like, and I more like have a top three (AFI, Aiden, and Greeley Estates).  Other artists I like in no particular order are The Killers, William Control, 30 Seconds To Mars, My Chemical Romance, The Fully Down, Drop Dead, Gorgeous, The Devil Wears Prada, Alesana, Metro Station, Giles, Sky Eats Airplane, A Skylit Drive, Tiger Army, Blaqk Audio, Madina Lake, Farewell to Freeway, +44, My American Heart, The Click Five, Franz Ferdinand, Panic at the Disco, Forever the Sickest Kids, Cobra Starship, Blink-182, This or the Apocalypse, and a lot of other stuff...<br>  4. out of your top ten favorite bands, who is your absolute favorite and what is your favorite song by them?  I can't pick a favorite, that's too hard.  Same for songs.  They have so much good stuff you just can't pick a single favorite song!<br>  5. do you have any pets? what are they and what are their names? I have three cats, one is specifically mine.  Mine is old, senile, has a leaky cyst, and he could die any time now, named Boots, who is black and white (stereotypical, I know).  My sister's cat, Lysander, is less than a year old, a dumb (just because he's still young) cat that is getting bigger all the time, he's like an orange tabby.  My mom's cat, Sissy (Cecilia), is a small tabby-ish cat that is shades of brown, and I'm pretty sure she lost weight after we got Lysander, she was a seemingly healthy weight before he came.<br>  6. how does a chocolate bar sound right now?  Really really good, I'm hungry and waiting for my sister to bring me lunch from Tim Horton's.<br>  7. what's your favorite color? Orange. :P<br>  8. where is your mom/dad right now? My mom is upstairs sleeping, and my dad could be at his house, or out running or shopping or something.<br>  9. what is your favorite tv show?  I don't watch much television, so I don't really know.<br>  10. how do you feel today, in five words or less? Okay, Hungry, NOM NOM NOM.<br>  11. finish the lyric!

OHIOOOOO! ?<br>  12. what time is it right now? 2:01 PM<br>  13. do you like americas best dance crew? who is you favorite this season, and who should have won? I like ABDC, but haven't watched it since the first season, cause I don't watch much television anymore.  I wanted Kaba Modern to win the first season, but Jabbawockeez deserved it. :)<br>  14. what other tv shows do you watch? Sometimes: Fear Itself, Medium, Cold Case, House, CSI...<br>  15. have you ever answered a question, and then really regretted saying what you did, like you insulted someone? I have to be honest, so I didn't really regret it.  I feel like I insult people all the time though. ;(|`|gCoqslUGaa	1. alex (duh!)<br>  2. um brown<br>  3.

FcHplZtQaa	I LOVE Law & Order, so I was a bit worried about the UK one, it's knowhere near as polished as the US one, but good if not completely different, I'm sure I'll like it just as much after a few more episodes!|`|jtoxFsdYaa	As a fan of the original US series I was keen to see how the UK version works and got to see it for the first time last week but was rather disappointed with it. Part of the reason might be that living in the UK I understand more about our laws and can see flaws in the storyline that I might not be aware of in the US version. Whilst I am always happy to see the lovely Dervla Kerwan on any TV show her character was for me quite unbelievable but I will give it a few more weeks before finally making up my mind about the show.<br>  <br>  As for us copying the Americans, I don't really see why not, they have been making US versions of many of our popular TV shows for years.<br>  <br>  Whatever they do, here or in the US, they will never replace the sadly missed late Jerry Orbach.|`|iXwA5wAlaa	Nearly, not as polished as the US Law and Order though.<br>  The state the ITV company is in will, unfortunately, lead to less and less polish.<br>  They produced some good stuff in their heyday.|`|ca45a20110b39435a05dfafc8745bf11aa	I saw the last one. Thought it was a bit weak and so did the reviews. Apparently it down to Dervla Kiran (?) being unconvincing as the defence. <br>  Good ending though when the prosecutor said he had done no favours in winning a conviction.|`|W6wamWLLaa	No, it sucks!!<br>  But I dont like the American one either. <br>  Its far too serious and boring.|`|52pZj3WFaa	Nope.

w36yKN6Kaa	I would suggest Music Forte, because they have been in business for several years, they use EV SSL which is an expensive security measure for online transactions (if you plan to shop online).  They provide phone support MF 9-5, and are a registered S-Corp in the state of Illinois.  <br>  <br>  In regards to the music you are looking for, I have two great ideas that you might not have thought about.  <br>  <br>  First (not as good as the next idea), you may want to try a MIDI compilation of Jazz Standards.  I've put an example below in the source.<br>  <br>  You may need a 3.5 disk drive, as MIDI is not all that popular.  However, the great thing about it is that you can transpose the music instantly on your computer in play it in the exact key that you need it.  In fact, you can really work your vocals well, by practicing the same song in different keys that challenge your low and high range.<br>  <br>  Next, (I think this is better), something that is new and becoming increasingly popular is the Pro Vocal series, which is in CD format.  It is enhanced for computer playback to adjust the key (without changing tempo), but is also playable on any CD player.  I think this is better, because the music is real, and not computer midi generated music.<br>  <br>  Also below is a link for books that contain Heart's, "Crazy On You".

Kevin & Amber have gotten closer with this Mrs. C thing & because Jana & Daniel don't really believe, they are probably going to get together, which is sad because I really like Jana & Kevin together, but they have been a little boring lately. I have always liked Amber's character, she's tough & feisty, I can see future sparks flying between Amber & Kevin, but I wonder what that means for Jana, I guess we have to wait & see...|`|4kuWOZowaa	I know it made me cry..I wonder what is going to happen to kevin|`|uUzbqGh5aa	Yes it was a pitiful scene, but l'm sure Colleen felt just as "breathless" as Kevin did when he locked her in the freezer/chiller sometime ago. Kevin is a really good actor and l hope he gets nominated for this role.
cr5TQgmUaa	According to DaytimeRoyalty.com: This week, both SOD and SOW have articles about the Katherine story. Included on the site is a summation of both articles.<br>  <br>  Spoilers follow:<br>  <br>  <br>  After the explosion, Kay decides to act like she can't remember the explosion. She tells Amber and Esther that she doesn't remember the last couple of months. She doesn't want to keep hurting the people around her.<br>  <br>  Billy walks by her hospital room door and she says "What are you doing back from Hong Kong?" That would not be something Marge would know. Kay asks him things that would be in the stream of Katherine's knowledge.<br>  <br>  When a psychiatrist shows up to discuss her memory loss he tells her that her dental records are missing. She realizes the doctor is going to keep her "in the loony bin" until they figure out who she is. So she declares "I'm Marge. I've been lying all along. Just give me my clothes and let me out of here."<br>  <br>  Kay doesn't think she'll be able to prove her true identity if she's stuck in the hospital.<br>  <br>  Jill walks by and hears Kay's declaration. Later she goes to Nikki and tells her all about it.<br>  <br>  CBS Spoilers say: ?Kay fools the doctor and Jill when she announces she is really Marge, but will her plan take her one step back in proving her true identity?<br>  <br>  ---- > So it looks like they're going to drag it out for a while longer. Probably when Mackenzie comes home|`|SXwlw9N2aa	I don't think anyone got killed, but I have been reading rumors that they are in the hospital and that Mrs C doesn't remember Murphy and anything about the accident. I am so sick of the memory loss storyline. They have drug this out for so long, and now having Mrs C not remember Murphy, that just makes me mad.|`|pCq9BPJBaa	Mrs C lived ! shes in the hospital , but doesnt remember the explosion murphy and she doesnt remember anything about the accident "death" but other than that shes fine [=|`|4kuWOZowaa	Im not sure..I hope nobody did.|`|AA11111233	I have never heard anything about Katherine dying, but I think this is the final climax of the Katherine/Marge storyline where she gets her old memory back, thusfinally proving herself to be alive and legit.  Jill will be shocked shitless when she realizes Amber and Kevin have been telling the truth all along.  Did anyone say anything about Jess Walton contract being up, because as soon as she realizes this, and that she is not Katherine's daughter, she will be running out of town with her *** in between her legs.|`|2Hl4AAP7aa	mrs c is ok but has lost her memory about everything that happened since the accident with marge. she now remembers her old life, but it was sad that she didnt recognize murphy and pearl when they came to see her.gloria the b---- had a reporter with a camera come to the hospital and told the reporters she was mrs c's good friend and that she had saved her life, what a crock that was.
IsxB0Qi7aa	I know what you mean, I can't believe Ashley's birthday gift to Victor was to tell him she got him something she made, I mean they made together... UGH! How corny!!! You would think it would be dangerous for someone as old as Ashley to get pregnant again considering she almost died of cancer then had a miscarriage with Brad's baby. I don't think Victor should've announced it at his birthday party until they went to an actual doctor to verify Ashley is pregnant & it is safe for her to have this baby. Well, at least this time we know who the baby's Daddy is... or do we? LOL!!!|`|arjB50zBaa	Ashley, Ashley what can I say. <br>  I cant stand her when she is with Victor. Whenever she gets involved with the mustache all her common sense goes out the window.<br>  What I cant stand is the fact that Victor had a vysectomy some years ago and keeps managing to knock everyone up.    Its a miracle (sarcasim)!<br>  He is like 60 something the last thing he needs is another kid, he cant even manage to carry a relationship with the ones he already has.<br>  Needless to say I am NOT happy with this storyline. The only way this will be intersting to me is if another man, from Ashleys past, comes into the pictue...whos the daddy>>>not Victor.  But I dont see that happening.|`|VAp5ICaBaa	I was totally grossed out and I can't wait until she finds out Victor is the one behind buying Gloria's stock and making Billy CEO instead of keeping her as CEO.|`|5f0111f71db8592710a5d1cb4897be4aaa	lol,,,don't you know it ! <br>  <br>   I cant see anything good coming out of this pregnancy  ONLY another woman left to raise a child on her own IN Genoa City.|`|5JgchYUEaa	I am so tired of victor making a crap load of babies all over the place. i mean geez! he's old and gray and still making babies! stop the madness! please!!!|`|AA11739978	Didn't he have a vasectomy or was it reversed? And I agree... eww.|`|4kuWOZowaa	lol..yes we see how abby turned out..yuk..such a brat...and i wonder if the writers forgot he had a visectomy.|`|uUzbqGh5aa	Ashley is not a tranny, that was cleared up years ago.<br>  No l'm not grossed out about her being pregnant, in fact anything to put a smile on Victor's face so he could stop for a minute and not think about another conspiracy or vengenance, l support.|`|cdf9bde60acfd0a622e4bbdccdc9e515aa	I know!

6iCOMx8laa	It is scary and a little sad, but there are people with whom you will always be in touch. No matter where on earth we live BFF and I have always been tight.  Plus you will meet so many new people.  <br>  <br>  There was an exchange student at our school, my freshman year. We got to be friends, plus my dad loved him as he was from Germany, like my dad.  Well, Chris went home at the end of the school year. Sneaky guy, had arranged to be an transfer student at  our school and lived w/ a friends family the next year.  Again, they graduated and we all felt bad, thinking we'd never see him again.  He went to a college in Florida and visited our town to see his bud and "family".  I moved and ran into him at a concert in LA.  He was living in San Francisco. A few years later we (group from school) arranged to meet at concert in Phoenix,  After we ran into each other again in Chicago, we just decided to stay in touch.<br>  <br>  Sorry that got so long. My point is some people  you will always have in your life, even though you may not expect it right now.|`|8vfCRg7Caa	i never wanted to see anybody in highschool again. So i cant feel you on that. When i first read the question i thought you were talking about REAL FRIENDS like when you move. i was in the military and there was a girl who would go to the beach me everyday in my last days in the navy. It was hard to say goodbye to her. i wish i knew her name, had her email or something but i was so pissed she left i didnt get any of that. Dumb me. Now i would pay thousands of dollars to find her. She had a boyfriend and who ever married her is a lucky man.|`|AA12254647	I grew up in a small town 3,500 people <br>  <br>  and I know for sure that i wont see certain people again <br>  It makes me want to cry <br>  and then i think of all the people i will never know and it makes me sadder <br>  ugh im emotional today <br>  oh well|`|8tRY1U2Iaa	Try being military, and making friends in training who have different jobs, and who will be sent to different places, and then suddenly knowing that you may never see them again after the training phase.|`|v6RjD1vWaa	definitely.<br>  saying goodbye to my ex boyfriend was one of the hardest things i've had to do.<br>  because i knew i'd never see him again, considering he was moving to another state.<br>  i miss him at times..<br>  but i'll never forget him.|`|vC00rC4Laa	Yes , i agree with you. Im not in the 10th grade yet, but thinking about good-byes make me sad.|`|DS33Wl4waa	That happens in life but then you meet a whole new group of people|`|KPKv5hwqaa	just know that that is how it is supposed to be. Good luck|`|tguEmxVyaa	Only if you see them again.|`|rUMGPXqwaa	yeah it sucks, but it's worse when your fiance is a Marine and gets deployed.|`|CmNSdnWIaa	I think it's scarier meet people for the first time.Yes,it sucks to say good bye to friends and family,but with cell phones and the internet it's pretty easy to keep track of people now.If you think I'm wrong about meeting new people,just imagine what your first day of college will be like.I've yet to go myself,but I'd be willing to bet that it will kind of feel like the first day of Kindergarten.You get to walk around confused,scared,excited and missing your folks,all at the same time.|`|OdUZ7NNnaa	nopes<br>  i keep in touch and hope to see them again|`|T8OVFYrdaa	it's not bad if people are just moving on.<br>  <br>  try saying good-bye to someone who's seriously ill... now THAT's rough...|`|eS9nPWqBaa	Yeah my ex was in the army that was really hard for me..<br>  <br>  <br>  But it didn't hurt as much as him CHEATING!!! loser.

0UK5mRcQaa	I don't like it either!! Dakota Fanning is NOT meant for the Twilight series at all! The second movie is sounding so bad. They're ruining it! I don't think the director has any clue what the fans want to see! I think I'm gonna wait for New Moon to be on HBO lol.|`|LRLu1ofNaa	I really couldn't care less.|`|u9NxzS1Uaa	i think it is funny cause she doesnt seem to fit the caracter, this movie is gonna be worst than the first....the only person they seemed to get right was bella and she sucked at playing the role also.|`|pEDavW3caa	i agree with you. i think she just doesn't really look the part of jane. anyway did you know if she plays jane then she will be in eclipse and breaking dawn too. i'm worried that her complexions would change because she's only 15 and that would mess up the story cuz jane isn't suppose to age. anyway it annoys me too. just like if vanessa hudgens was going to play leah.|`|SLnq7j5jaa	I the book series, but I despise the movies. They made a big joke out of an amazing book series. I adore Dakota Fanning, because she's so laid back, but her playing Jane? It doesn't look good.|`|jH9iRq2Uaa	NOOOOOOO!!!!!! i love dakota fanning and HATE ALL THE TWILIGHT BOOKS!!! y wud she play in such a movie based on a very STUPID book|`|ZL3HRix5aa	its really for sure no she can not play that part in the twilight series they describe her as scary look and dark hair and really child like i highly doubt that Dakota would be able to pull it off i have seen a few movies with her in it its not going to happen she sucks at acting she is pretty and stuff its just that she isn't suited for playing the part of Jane <br>  <br>  <br>  NO SHE SUCKS !|`|RXLFDkf3aa	I don't like her for the part - she is playing Jane, who is meant to be a young child, and Dakota is 15.|`|oLli98mMaa	Omg she is for sure???

t9zEzx3naa	They have already answered a lot of stuff this season. There is only one season left, so they will answer all the other burning questions. After the series ends, then you will probably miss watching it every week. i know i will!|`|nDDnbAq2aa	Wouldn't say I'm sick of it, but it does drive me craaaazzy!  I wish someone would just answer a damn question, or even ask one!  Jack doesn't ask Ben anything about why he's beaten up, Sawyer gets a chance to talk to Richard in the 70's, how about a 'what up with that smoke monster thingy?'  Or ask Rich about the statue!  Jin couldve told the other losties he saw the statue when he was on the boat, only now' it's only a foot and 4 toes!  Also, when John went to convince Jack, you know how Jack and everyone thinks John's just a crazy old man, not special, obsessed, etc...   Maybe he should have told everyone how he was totally paralyzed and then when they hit the island, he could walk again.  I mean, that's really why he is so willing to believe, because he experienced a miracle.  The island didn't do anything miraculous for them, so maybe if he woulda told them, they woulda believed too?!|`|YfYjVPudaa	No ,It never bores me and I never tire of it !|`|NwYwLdsNaa	I'm not tired of it yet.  :)|`|frA6KJwIaa	i'm not tired if it, that is what makes this show so great. why do you always wanna know everything. dont you like a good mystery? we know so many things we don't wanna know these days. we are at war with 2 countries, we are in recession, and soo much more.<br>  <br>  isnt it nice to just escape in this impossible world of lost every wednesday night?|`|Qu7GIg6Haa	Not sick of it. I rewatch the DVD seasons and find a new clue that I previously missed every time I watch them. I'm not sure I'll get sick of Lost unless they totally crap out at the end and it turns out to be somebody's dream or something lame like that. THEN I will be mucho miffed. But not yet!!|`|DUg1IkTIaa	Heck no.  I'm new to LOST and loving every twist and turn.  It does seem like the writers aren't able to "tie up the ends" very well, because there are a lot of unanswered questions still being introduced into the plots.|`|87abb67fdea86bc93c669613a70f1f3eaa	I just started watching it this season and I love it!|`|dMBSE8ilaa	No, I will never be tired of Lost, it's an awesome show.

You're so right, every episode she'll make some snarky comment to his face.|`|WGYlzefnaa	ya know, I personally really dislike her immensely, BUT they seem to work well together and if he is happy with his b~alls in her hands (constantly squeezing) then who are we to argue?|`|MNa3e8Mdaa	i hink that they really love echother . she is messes around with him!|`|SQhkDn24aa	I find this an extremely hurtful question. Why would you ask such a thing?<br>  <br>  This family has enough things to worry about as it is with 8 young children. Leave them alone with your insane questions.

AA10053661	I've never been good at rating things 1-10. I have so many variables that totally botch up any statistical reasoning when it comes to friendships. <br>  <br>  I think the men I'm most attracted to when I meet someone I might go out with are men with a similar intellect....... or those that are so funny or witty.... which truthfully is ONLY possible if they have a quick mind which shows their intelligence. But not ALL people I'm around have to be witty or funny or brainiacs. Just willing to be open-minded enough to understand and be aware of others and what they like and don't like.<br>  <br>  As far as overall attitude, well yes, that becomes very important. Probably more so than the intellect. Egotistical people really don't mix well with me. Or people that are so cynical or paranoid or insecure that they come across as superior. That inferiority/superiority thing really gripes me! Admit what bothers you rather than holding it in to make people think you are perfecto when you have flaws naturally like we all do! It's just being honest with yourself and others.<br>  <br>  Simple-minded people are seriously a bit more honest and forth-coming. I like that. If you see things in a more concrete/ black and white way you tend to open your mind up to listen and learn. I like that in a person. And if someone is less intelligent? Well who am I to say whether someone is or is not..... but I'm a teacher and so I kind of tend to explain things to others anyway if they ask questions. It's my nature and I'm find with it. It's what I do.. it's what i'm used to. And I would NEVER ever judge someone for not understanding something that most others would assume people would know.<br>  <br>  I think it is because I am a teacher that I can not rate people on a scale. I LOVE the fact that everyone is different and we aren't only mixing and mingling with clones of ourselves. I do feel we migrate towards people with like attitudes and similar demeanors and I know I love being around funny fun-loving people. I love to have people challenge my mind and peak my passions. But I would be lost without the diversity that we gain from a variety of personalities.|`|grifjdr0aa	I find that if I am willing to "dumb down" I'm apt to learn a helluva lot more.  Being intelligent doesn't necessarily mean having all the answers.|`|kGkUG0fKaa	I love when I am around people who I can hold a stimulating intellectual conversation with. It makes the conversation and time spent worth it. I wouldn't say it is ultimately important because not every conversation I have with someone has to be intellectual. Some conversations are just whimsical and that's okay if they are.<br>  <br>  I do dislike simple-minded people who act dumbfounded. It annoys me when I am talking to someone who cannot comprehend certain vocabulary choices that I choose to exercise in what I am saying at that time. Or people who have literally nothing to say. I have friend like that who has nothing interesting ever to talk about, it's really annoying!<br>  <br>  My reaction to people who I see are less intelligent to me is just me thinking in my head how less intelligent they are than me. I do not put people down. I am a nerd, I happen to be this way by choice. I read dictionaries and I study test books and give myself quizzes and such but this is what I find fun for me and it is okay if other people do not feel the love for knowledge that I do, to the extent that I do. It doesn't make them dumber than I or smarter. We could be equal in so many other ways than intelligence. I'm not the smartest person I know or think I am the smartest out of my friends and such but I am an intelligent young lady and it's perfectly fine if not everyone I know is a nerd like myself.|`|BBVfRheyaa	7/10.<br>  <br>  I can't talk such difficult stuffs easily.<br>  <br>  Intelligent is not always almighty:}*|`|AA11705909	I value it quite a bit, an 8 perhaps?

Im very smart myself but I dont brag and it doesn't fase me to talk to a completely dumb person.<br>  I  only like talking to people with similar attitudes as me (timide, easy going, humble).  I hate people who run their mouth, cuss, show off, and brag.

32P3hG0Laa	The actual birth time is what matters. You could have a Mercury and/or Venus in Libra, your rising sign could be Libra... there are 10 planets in your chart. You need to look at the whole picture.|`|531f08d2bae7afb19dbace61520eb62caa	Pasting one of my other answers because it will save me typing.<br>  <br>  Time is the astrologer's god. However, few people know their real birth time. You are counting on some intern to get it right, if you are lucky. What if the intern forgot about about a time change and did not set her watch? Now you better have a GPS in the delivery room. Some countries do not even record the time. In the British Commonwealth nations, time is not required just day. Except for twins, first out is the legal heir.<br>  <br>  Some astrologers think that first breath by the baby is the switch that activates this magical concept. Premature births babies often need a ventilator because they can not breath on the own. So they are not taking crucial breathing on there own.<br>  <br>  Not including the premature births, about one third of the births in the U.S. are induced labor or c-section. A lot of these may be of convenience (Based on a doctor's golf game), a deadline, or an emergency. Not very natural. Now there is the science to freeze embryos for years beyond conception. Science can screw up what would be a "natural" birth time. As a parent, is it not better that medical science can save preemie's lives? Instead of worrying about a made-up, ancient, unproved and bigoted concept? Not too long ago this may not happen.<br>  <br>  If you choose to accept that people have no free will and are programed like computers, then you need a a proper chart. This will set all your stereotypes, so accurate time is vital. No astrologer will use a "what if" birth chart. Moon and Rising signs and the planet positions (real and made up) are very important to the astrologer. They need the whole picture. But also no two astrologers will have the same results. It is after all magical thinking.<br>  <br>  Of course free will makes astrology pointless.<br>  <br>  If it's not science, it's superstition.|`|7rrNvFK7aa	the actual birth of time unless one ofthe nurses' watch was slow or needed abattery. In that case, i agreewith chainlighting|`|77afc9c6ef5c9139b7b20cfeb0ffb2bbaa	actual time of birth is important<br>  and u should focus more on ur ascendant in a birth chart<br>  if that doesnt match, change from western horoscopes to Vedic horoscopes u might find that more accurate for urself|`|Ow3O7h4caa	The time of birth for that moment is what counts, not the expected/natural time. Could you imagine if that was controllable and order a birth time?<br>  <br>  As for being a Virgo and not having Virgo traits, Libras are perfectionist just as much as Virgoes. Virgo love to analyze and Libra love to weigh the pros and cons, see both sides before taking the decision. Virgos often base their relationships on intellectual stimulation and Libras love to communicate intellecually as well and both are reserved in their emotional expression, Virgo is reserved, Libra is superficial.<br>  These are some of their similarities.

qWSfV7vNaa	Dude, I was just thinking about this whole question. Right now Ulquiorra is pawning Ichigo and while I was reading I'm like, "What are the other Captains doing right now, just standing there?" lol. Anyway Here are my theories:<br>  <br>  1) Stark VS Kyoraku - Totally going to be the best battle in the history of bleach, it will possible be a draw hopefully we get to see some releases and Bankai's before it ends. <br>  <br>  2) Barragan VS Soifon - Of course Soifon is going to win, she will probably get her a** kicked in the process though. Hopefully we will see her bankai aswell.<br>  <br>  3) Halibel VS Hitsugaya - Judging from the Manga, Hitsugaya is going to get his butt kicked, he probably wont win because he already released his bankai and Halibel hasn't even tried yet. Probably someone else is going to help in that battle since Hitsugaya wont be able to do it on his own.<br>  <br>  Hopefully Tite will finish up this Ulquiorra VS Ichigo part, It's good though. :)|`|ZtM6wDMfaa	i totally agree with you<br>  the espada are so much stronger<br>  but its bleach so the captains prolly have some intense secret power.<br>  its always like that, they just cant die LOL<br>  but i think it would suck if the bad guys won|`|afZdehfzaa	i think the espadas would lose because something always pops up and maybe ichigo would have enough straight to use his banki again, and or this hallow self will appear<br>  <br>  one way or another the espadas r going to lose

vH2OF9z8aa	your future is filled with Love): The perfect harmony of union, in romance, friendship, or business. A deep and palpable connection radiating joy and contentment. A great concordance or pledge of fidelity. The joining of male and female interpreted in the broadest sense. The sanctification of the natural through that which exists on a higher plane. May indicate the meeting of a kindred soul, marriage, engagement, merger, or partnership. <br>   The card to the far left represents the first false path that may lead you astray. Death: A major change or transformation, possibly traumatic and unexpected. Freedom from the shackles of the past. A new beginning. Death coupled with rebirth, usually related to consciousness and lifestyle. <br>   The card in the middle represents the second decision along your path. Two of Swords (Peace): Contradictory characteristics brought together as a means of resolving a conflict. Refusing to be ruled by negative emotions. Strife brought to a close through clarity of mind and restraint of force. Turning a blind eye to the minor infractions of others. <br>   The card at the lower right represents the second false path that may lead you astray. Ten of Coins (Wealth): Completion of material prosperity and riches. Freedom from financial anxiety, the security of home, and the enjoyment of family. The passing of inheritance along to children, or the gaining of inheritance from parents. <br>   The card at the top represents one possible mask of your true destination. Charity: Kindness shown to the weak and downtrodden. A firm and helping hand. Being magnanimous in victory, and showing generosity to the defeated. Giving someone the skills and resources to succeed on their own.

And I am 17 thank you very much, and my sister is 19, and my friend is 16, ....wow that doesn't look like 9 to me....<br>  <br>  <br>  So why don't you get a life, stop criticizing someone you don't know, stop telling people how much you hate the jonas brothers, and go do something productive with your life.  k?  <br>  <br>  <br>  and frankly i could care less what you think about the jonas brothers.  I know people don't like them, and I'm not saying you have to like them or us crazy jonas fans are gonna come kill you in the night.

Here's a poem about them:<br>  <br>  Nick Says keep on Rockin'<br>  You know hes doesn't like stoppin'<br>  Rockin all night with joe by his side<br>  Nicks in for a wild, wild ride<br>  <br>  The J bros dress up worse than Hoes<br>  They wear your sisters clothes<br>  put on make up and wear high heeled shoes<br>  wearing tight shits, with lots of enthuse<br>  <br>  In the music industry, they have failed,<br>  but each other they have nailed<br>  There is one rule to prove that you are a fool<br>  You like to watch them do it on a stool<br>  <br>  Nicks hair is nappy<br>  Joe's singing is crappy<br>  Kevin's gay but happy<br>  Because his bros are sappy<br>  <br>  They make big guys cry,<br>  they make happy people want to die<br>  they make you want to apply, for the FBI<br>  To make the jonas brothers die<br>  <br>  Because you know,<br>  they got know flow,<br>  just like afterglow<br>  Boring but fortunately common<br>  <br>  To sum it all up, lets start with nick<br>  he sucks die<br>  Joe is a hoe <br>  and Kevin's screws his bro!<br>  <br>  A kid at my school wrote this!|`|SeYFrGzZaa	No. Nine-year-olds drool all over them because...well..they're nine.<br>  <br>  plus they're like rockstars to them. kids @ nine wouldn't know about the damn beatles, or the big time singers like rite now- Beyonce, Leona Lewis, or whoever. Their TV's are set on Disney Channel and Nickelodeon. <br>  <br>  The people who HATE the jonas brothers are older (mostly teenage) people who are hatin on them because they're our age and they're making more money than our parents. That's why Chris Brown was hated when he was 16 thats why people HATE Miley Cyrus...Beyonce wasn't even the favorite back in our days with Destiny's Child.<br>  <br>  So basically the Jonas Brothers are mainly for kids and mid teens.<br>  Big problem with americans..were just a bunch of haters.|`|Mwb5UkPBaa	It's become so popular because so many tween girls though Nick was cute and decide to make a big huge circus out of it then it evolved into this annoying fan-crazed frenzy over three talentless young adults. Personally, I'm with you. The Jonas brother can't sing. The crap they sing doesn't even deserve to be called music.|`|1VdgsZPoaa	It's kind of like...NSYNC, and the Backstreet Boys, and Britney Spears, etc.  They are a non-talented fad that shall soon pass.  I do hate when they are compared to the Beatles though.  The Beatles had musical talent and will go down in history.  The Jonas Brothers shall not.<br>  <br>  So glad my 9 year old does not like them.|`|kqk1Mqqsaa	well the other one's Kevin, just so you know........  :)<br>  and I actually don't like them either, I just know a bunch of high school and middle school girls who think they're "cute" or something.  it's really dumb.  I like GOOD music!|`|qjjY07Lsaa	Yeah. He's just older than the rest of them. Nick is famous because he dated Miley Cyrus. Joe is famous because he was the main character in Camp Rock.|`|9SZ1zLIHaa	i think it's absolutely  RIDICULOUS that they're even in the same sentence as The Beatles.  <br>  don't worry, soon all the 12 year olds will grow up and forget about them.|`|iS94TGdxaa	people dont--  just 13 yr old girls only becuz they think there cute--if they were 40 yr olds no preteen girls wouldn't likethem all -and they wouldnt have any fanbase|`|QUcxqoABaa	well, i don't know why people like them, and probably I'll never know;don't care anyway. And if the other jerk doesn't get as much attention, who cares???? he makes as much money anyway|`|Sofk2yO8aa	they're basically for silly kids with no taste in music and with raging hormones.|`|xJPPZh7Saa	if you dont like them then why spend your time talking about them?<br>  <br>  (btw i'm not their biggest fan either but people who put themselves out to insult bands unessessarily need lives)|`|55Xq3a5Laa	They're garbage.|`|EmC8wvMsaa	It's all about the FADS|`|kBBFbTPiaa	Cuz there mega hot!! duh!|`|MUDLsPpHaa	they are annoying to me, so idk|`|LQtqYMP3aa	I love all of them, for all of the reasons that isiticedtea and Th3 G!Rl ..... tht loves nick j! said, because those are the reasons that I came up by myself (and they're using them (even though I'm the one who came up with them in the first place). I get that they agree with all of those reasons, but if you were in my place, and you wrote something, and you noticed that other people had the exact same answer that you wrote down, wouldn't you be a little upset? Or am I blowing this way out of proportion?<br>  <br>  Anyway, to answer your question (now that I'm completely off topic), I'd just like to add that Kevin used to be my only favorite, but now I don't know, b/c I like Nick A LOT more too (even though I'm older than him). So maybe Kevin + Nick are both my favorite (Sorry Joe :-(. I love you too! But I can't pick all 3 of you :-(. Can I?<br>  <br>  I love Kevin, b/c he's soooo sweet, and nice, and a lot of JB fans don't like him, or think he's ugly, or gay (but he's not). He's an awesome guitar player, and the JB wouldn't be the JB without him.<br>  <br>  I love Joe, b/c he's soooo funny, and he raps sometimes, and he has a great voice, and he's the most fun of all of them.<br>  <br>  I love Nick, b/c he plays the most instruments (guitar, keyboards, + drums), and has the best singing voice of the 3 of them, and he seems to be the most serious/focused JB, even though he's the youngest (not including Frankie). And his lyrics and music are amazing (he wrote SOS by himself, and it's one of my favorite songs ever). And I love his hair, and when he smiles, it makes my heart melt (Nick J is off the chain!)<br>  <br>  And I know this doesn't answer the question, but I just wanted to throw it in anyway. My 3 current favorite songs right now are A Little Bit Longer, Take On Me, and When You Look Me In The Eyes.<br>  <br>  I love how A Little Bit Longer is Nick's song, b/c it's about him finding out he had diabetes, and how he learned to manage it. It's the perfect mix of ballad (Nick playing piano at the beginning), and rock (with Kevin + Joe on guitar). And since I had cancer a couple years ago (but I don't anymore, after I got treatment for it), I can totally relate to that song.<br>  <br>  I also love Take On Me. From the intro (+ Joe going 1,2,3,4!) to Kevin + Nick going crazy and shaking their heads and jamming on their guitars, it's an awesome song, and I love it! I can't get it out of my head.<br>  <br>  And When You Look Me In The Eyes is an awesome song. Why else would they name their tour that? And I love it because Nick's on piano, and it's a beautiful song, and the lyrics are awesome. I love that song so much!|`|jug5aK5xaa	The popularity of the Jonas brothers arises from their homosexuality. They are not strait. and for proof, when that guy got a bra thrown at him he spazzed out.<br>  i think gays are automatically liked.<br>  maybe its because people think theyare funny and charismatic.<br>  who knows.<br>  but yes i agree.<br>  they are not good.|`|fKAFNW3Baa	yeah i agree with ya.. people need to go to listen to some REAL music. they're lyrics are totally worthless.can't they sing about something else other that love? and why do ppl love jonas brothers?? i don't get it.<br>  i find all of them gay, talentless and ugly..|`|4jbVgo4aaa	well i don't have nothing against them..its Kevin yeah i forget his name too. i don't like them that much either. they really don't have good voices its just the timing they all came out.

zy5qcc0Raa	Love match: Cancer<br>  <br>  Quickie:<br>  Problems in your romantic life don't have to ruin your day. Distractions abound.<br>  <br>  Overview:<br>  Don't let your guard down (much) today -- you've got to keep watching out to see who's really who they say they are. New people are especially troublesome, but it's at least half thanks to your own odd energy. <br>  <br>  Monthly:<br>  Indulge yourself on the 1st. Not on too much Rocky Road ice cream, but with a long romp in the woods with a few of your favorite people and some kids. There's nothing like watching a child's delight at the wonders of nature to put you in a good mood. Afterwards, head to the old-fashioned drug store on the corner for that scoop of Rocky Road, fountain style. How sweet things are, sometimes. You'll need to really focus if you want to get any meaningful work done on the 4th. Somebody is holding a butter knife behind their back on the 8th. Are they getting ready to help make bite-sized salmon bagels for the meeting or do they want to metaphorically stab you in the back? Be on your guard (but don't worry, it's not sharp). If work is frustrating you, focus on your personal relationships on the 12th. It never hurts to check in with friends and a couple of your close friends or loved ones could use a little TLC, so they'll appreciate your attention. Plan your future carefully on the 17th -- these plans could come to fruition quicker than you think. Watch your money on the 22nd, but don't worry too much on the 27th. Cut to the chase on the 30th. You'll be glad you did.<br>  <br>  Year 2009 Overview:<br>  In order for Capricorn to accomplish their goals in 2009, intelligent brainstorming is a must. Connecting with others satisfies your mind, and friends are a source of stimulation and inspiration, adding to the scientific developments you like to explore. That said, be sure to take time for yourself. You don't have to master everything in a day.<br>  <br>  You thrive on making new discoveries and developing opportunities. Call upon your inner guidance to help get the job done more efficiently. If you feel any uncertainty, other people are there to confirm your ideas, and allowing yourself to explore your inner thoughts will help you align yourself with a greater sense of awareness and meaningfulness.<br>  <br>  Capricorn rarely shies away from highly concentrated work, and you are able to meet challenges as they come up in 2009. This is a time of great self-discovery and transformation for you. As you work to manifest your best possible self, you will see things from a deeper perspective than ever before. Hidden beneath your desire to work hard is the key to making your life easier. In other words, you won't have to strain as much if you surrender to a higher knowing. Using your powers of concentration to tune into universal knowledge will help you manifest your highest dreams. <br>  <br>  Daily Flirt:<br>  Your people may be concealing some big stuff from you today, thinking it's best for you. The thing is, you're actually not in the best position to take dishonesty, even if it's well meant.<br>  <br>  Daily Couples:<br>  You'll have to work a little harder to turn today into something good for you and your lover. If going out seems like too much, plan a cozy and restorative evening at home instead.<br>  <br>  Daily Singles:<br>  You're prone to experiencing a total loss of control in one or more aspects of your life.

Even if you change the radio station, a new perspective will help you walk through it.<br>  <br>  Career:<br>  It's not an easy day, if only because work issues keep popping into your mind. Be careful not to project them onto those around you. If your friends appear as people they are not, doubt yourself.|`|F8Yj3U9caa	horoscopes dont work on me :(|`|BnvHNVNvaa	www.tarot.com<br>  <br>  enter all the info there. all the horoscopes are scarily accurate.|`|zxnvdSS3aa	you'll go to a party around the 19th and have fun with one of your buds and his cool guy friends according to 17 magazine|`|gDfGfpMfaa	horoscopes are evil, lying, and just superstition

The really sad thing is that this guy had a lot of potential but will now forever be branded as the vegetarian vampire who sparkles like tinkerbell in sunlight. A true tragedy. And he truly isn't very good looking and has a definite issue with personal hygiene. The real freaky thing is that there was this study, where prepeubescent girls were told that edward cullen doesn't exist and that pattinson's just an actor, and most of them burst out into tears, saying that 'he was TOO edward' and that would marry him when they grew up. Makes me weep for generation next.|`|03GNhNcsaa	& what world have you been living on?<br>  <br>  yeah, he's hot. i admit it(:<br>  but we're surrounded by teenagers who actually believe they're gonna marry nick jonas.<br>  what's worse?<br>  us mature twilighters, or those immature 'mrs. nick jonas' fangirls?<br>  <br>  just now, i found a question saying 'how can i get the jonas brothers to answer their fanmail?'<br>  <br>  robert pattinson is hot. he also has a cute personality(:<br>  i see interviews, so..|`|pEDavW3caa	i think girls think he's cute is because he's edward from twilight. without that, the girls wouldn't look at him twice. i don't think he's cute or hot but he plays edward so you just have to believe that. i only thought he looked cute in the movie. but other than that i don't know.|`|SvHr19zJaa	First of all he isnt a kid.

But now that I saw that movie I see why the girls do love him."<br>  Honestly my mom and my aunt could be like freaks sometimes, they love these boys 10 years younger than they are.

KTg4Gl1faa	It is all one series.  Issues 1-17 are titled Angel: After the Fall, and starting with issue 18 the series is called Angel: Aftermath but it is a continuation.  The name change just reflects that the original story arc is completed a new arc is beginning.  It also relfects that Brian Lynch and Joss Whedon are no longer the writers.

1UvZd7Eraa	I agree with Nix's answer. <br>  <br>  All of the verses is society's view on Britney, they think they know her but they don't, and they also only see her as someone they want to sleep with. The breakdown goes:<br>  <br>  "So tell me if you see her<br>  (Nobody knew what she was wearin' or what she was like)<br>  'Cus I've been waiting here forever<br>  (Nobody knew if she was goin' out her mind)"<br>  <br>  The part in parenthesis is saying that nobody knows how Britney feels or what her thoughts are, they just wanna do her lol.<br>  <br>  The chorus is Britney saying that despite her problems etc. etc. all of the boys and all of the girls are begging to "If U Seek Amy" (F-u-c-k her)<br>  <br>  It's a deep song actually if you pay attention to the lyrics. lol.<br>  <br>  Calling her "Amy" in the song is also just a way to make the wordplay "If U Seek Amy" make sense in context of the song|`|vFL1H4s1aa	About her phase of having no control and everyone wants her.

As people grow they don't have time watching this and mostly earn money for living same as me now.

SB4N01OOaa	I think it's because Naruto adopts the theory that the cells in our body only have a set number of times they can divide and regenerate, so when Naruto gets injured and heals super quickly he's using up that set number of cell regeneration faster than his body normally would, and so his life span is shortened.<br>  <br>  It's like when Tsunade used the power of the chakra on her forehead to heal herself during Her vs Jiraiya vs. Orochimaru and she automatically aged a lot. She used up her cells ability to regenerate so much that her body then physically resembled that of someone much older.<br>  <br>  Hope that helps!|`|M8qLP7MLaa	Tsunade, while fighting Orochimaru, used a seal on her forehead to heal herself. When this was happening, she explained it as something like when she releases the seal, the chakra expels from it and stimulates the proteins of her body to increase the speed of cell division and reconstruction of cells until her chakra runs out.<br>  <br>  Naruto includes the theory that cells can only do things like that a certain number of times before you die, so when you speed it up your life shortens.<br>  <br>  When Naruto heals right away, it's because Kyuubi is basically doing what Tsunade's seal did for her. He's increasing the speed of cell division and reconstruction to heal Naruto's body. So Naruto's life is shortened.

You have a logical mind and you have a sweetness about you. This makes it easy for you to make friends. But there is another side of you that is deceptive. This deception is not limited to just other people. You even deceive yourself.<br>  <br>  You have a nice voice and know how to control it. The moon seems to have a profound effect on when you attract people.<br>  <br>  You have the Fallen Angel aspect. This means that you need a lot of positive reinforcement as to your worth. You know that you are talented but have a hard time profiting from your talents.<br>  <br>  This is not complete. Just a little sample.|`|9azX3N4Laa	Sun in the 12th House: (House of Secrets, Sorrows and Self-Undoing). Piscean overtones color this placement that indicates what you have brought over from a past life to work out in this life. You must choose between serving and suffering. Any limitations you face are directly related to the past misuse of power. Your early conditioning may be affected by your father, for good or bad. You can be lonely, even in a crowd, or avoid close relationships. You may lack self-confidence. You can do well in the fields of medicine, psychology, research (especially psychic research), or someone who works with those who are limited or afflicted in some way. Most of your work will be done behind the scenes. If the Sun is afflicted, you may be overly timid or neurotic, or you may want to secretly control others. In your search for power and recognition, your ego may permit entities to use you as a medium. You may have powerful yet unknown secret enemies. You've allowed your ego and destructive tendencies to have control in past lives and now you must pay your karmic debt either through service or suffering-- the choice is yours. If the Sun is heavily afflicted, you can be your own worst enemy, but you can change this if you so desire.<br>  KEYNOTE: To transcend.<br>  <br>  Moon in the 1st House: (House of Self).You're emotional, sensitive, changeable and have a strong imagination. Your mood depends on the environment you're in and your actions depend on your mood. You can be successful in public life once you overcome an innate shyness. You're so eager to please due to a need for recognition you often allow others to use you and then become resentful if your efforts are not appreciated. Your self-awareness and self-expression are strongly colored by your emotions, early environment and family matters and are too easily influenced by others. You can be psychic or a medium. You have close ties to your mother but, if the Moon conjuncts the Ascendant, you may have a mother complex. You're physically active and, if in a cardinal or mutable sign, you may be restless. You often lack long-range purpose and direction. In a male's chart, there's too much femininity.<br>  <br>  Mercury in the 12th House: (House of Secrets, Sorrows and Self-Undoing). Your thinking is strongly influenced by unconscious memories and habits stemming from past experience. You're likely to be secretive about your inner thoughts and ideas, hesitating to say what you really think. You have a very active imagination, but your mind is subtle. You're often shy and prefer to work alone or behind the scenes. You lack self-confidence but hide your insecurity. You base decisions on feeling rather than logic but you're good at analyzing others' problems. If afflicted, you may find it difficult to relate to your external environment and may experience learning difficulties, especially in your early childhood. You feel like you're not understood by your relatives or those around you and, if afflicted, you can have neurotic tendencies, mental illness or a fixation on the past. If well aspected, especially to Uranus, Neptune or Pluto, you may gain valuable ideas and knowledge through dreams or intuitive or psychic ability. If afflicted, you may have been raised in a foster home, orphanage or boarding school. You should center you mind on serving those who are limited and/or afflicted in some way.<br>  <br>  Venus in the 11th House: (House of Friends and of Hopes and Wishes). Your friendships and social/romantic relationships often begin in group activities, so you usually share the same interests with your spouse. You have many friends, usually of the opposite sex who is often an artist or musician. Your friendly, diplomatic nature and kindness to others gets the same from them and they often help you fulfill your hopes and dreams. Your friends become romantic partners and your romantic partners remain friends. If afflicted, a wrong choice of friends may cause suffering. You tend to be too idealistic and need to be more realistic to accomplish your goals. You can be self-indulgent if Venus is afflicted.<br>  <br>  Mars in the 1st House: (House of Self). You're very self-assertive, self-confident, independent, positive, physically strong, ambitious, courageous, competitive, impulsive and impatient. You throw yourself into everything you do but only if you want to do it. You won't stand for any interference and if afflicted, you can be so headstrong that you disregard others' rights and take what you want through strength. You have the ability to lead, organize and work hard. You tend to be destructive if you're idle. You're not content to watch-- you must be actively involved. You are prone to accidents due to haste, impulsiveness and a tendency to run personal risks. If afflicted, you can be violent or the victim of violence, such as physical fights. You often have a scar on your head or face. You must learn to think before you act and, if afflicted, to overcome your temper and your ego. You seek recogni
AA11014312	I've been going gigs for over 10 years, we typically turn up around 30minutes before the doors open to get in to see the support act,and hour for a larger band, later if u are not fussed.<br>  Unless you want to be at the barrier (in which case you want to be there at least 5 hours.<br>  <br>    the crowds tend to shift in the arena (what with breaks between bands, late arrivals, trips to the bar and, in general the way that the crowd is dispersed.<br>    Not everyone wants to be at the front so you can usually snake your way through the crowd as long as you are polite. <br>    Although from what I have heard of the more commercial bands people can be a little bit more, well, hostile.<br>  <br>    Tip: the quickest, easiest and most hassle free way to get near the front is to snake round to the side (near the speakers) where you can usually make your way in from there, but you'll get a pretty good view from there alone.<br>  <br>  And PLEASE.. do not Push or Shove... you'll be surprised how much a little curtousy will get you.

iT9S20zvaa	I'd suggest listening to each of these instruments separately (perhaps by going to youtube and typing in oboe solo, flute solo, etc) to see which sound you like the best.<br>  <br>  The flute can produce a happy and melancholy sound.  I hate the clarinet...but that's just me.  The saxophone is great once you learn how to really play.  The bassoon can be okay, but it has a very mellow sound.  The oboe can be melancholy and happy (all of them can).<br>  <br>  This is really up to you, and it all depends on what sounds you prefer.  This is coming from someone who should have played the cello or the electric guitar instead of joining band and playing the flute.  I regret doing the wrong thing.  Be careful about your choice, and don't let anyone else influence it.<br>  <br>  Clarinet (a bunch of them together; you won't sound like this when you first start learning how to play): <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qxkp36ZVZQo" rel="nofollow">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qxkp36ZVZ...</a><br>  <br>  Oboe: <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s1k-RMSB76M&feature=related" rel="nofollow">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s1k-RMSB7...</a><br>  <br>  Flute: <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jAJ4i1L3y5M" rel="nofollow">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jAJ4i1L3y...</a><br>  <br>  Bassoon: <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vhyVvH6FPYI" rel="nofollow">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vhyVvH6FP...</a><br>  <br>  I didn't include saxophone because there were just too many.|`|oSXgtqYCaa	Hi! First of all, good for you for wanting to take an instrument. A lot will depend on your body size, what the band needs, how you test in band for instruments, and what you like. All the instruments can sound mellow and happy, so not to worry. I am a clarinetist professionally, so I love the clarinet unlike one of your other responders. But all instruments are both fun and difficult for different reasons. <br>  If you play sax, you really ought to start with alto. If, later on, you wish to learn the other saxes, that is fine, but start with alto. The oboe is probably the most unique, some say the most difficult, of the winds. It is one of the most beautiful instruments when played well...just listen to Tchaikovsky's 4th Symphony with the St. Louis Symphony Orchestra to hear Peter Bowman play the solo. It's incredible. The bassoon plays mainly low notes and is difficult to start with, unless you are pretty tall. Most bassoonists start in 8th grade or even later, but they learn another instrument beforehand. The flute is easier to play at first...it's higher pitched than the other instruments. <br>  <br>  Reeds are a consideration and can be a distraction to making beautiful music for all woodwind instruments except the flute, which you blow into like over a pop bottle. Double reeds are the most difficult but single reeds have their own headaches. <br>  <br>  Whatever you decide, please learn your notes and try not to just play by ear. And many, many of us play the piano along with a band or orchestra instrument, which makes everything easier. <br>  Good luck to you!|`|2BSBnRqYaa	Don't play saxophone.  Please.

hJP9y6kjaa	Umm.... you can't get it with a Marshall amp? Boost the gain, cut the mids slightly, boost the bass a little bit, crank the treble way up. Should be pretty easy.<br>  <br>  You can get a distortion pedal... even a DS-1 should help you get there.<br>  <br>  Boss is a great brand of guitar pedals... the link below goes to their distortion pedal page, which has sound clips! Go for the one that most closely matches the sound you have in your head.<br>  <br>  I've used the Metal Zone for years (when I didn't have an amp that had great built in distortion, or when I wanted that scooped metal tone at low volumes), and recently have picked up a Metalcore. I really like both - the Metal Zone has a more scooped sound like 80's metal (think early Metallica, or most of the death/thrash/black metal bands of that time period) but you should know that it doesn't have the low-end chunk that the Metalcore does (think modern metal distortion, more like Zakk Wylde or Lamb of God, that kind of thing).<br>  <br>  The Boss sound clips are pretty accurate, I think, so you can base your selection pretty reliably off of those.<br>  <br>  There are some cheaper but still decent pedals out there... I like some of the Danelectro pedals like the Fab Tone for instance. More fuzz than distortion per se, but with some EQ you can get a pretty decent array of distortion tones out of it.<br>  <br>  <br>  Saul|`|nbZMSCkSaa	I'm not massively into either, but I just had a bit of a listen to fall out boy to refresh memory. I definitely heard the familiar and unmistakable tone of premium high gain amps (Boogie, bogner, egnater). Most probably being fed with humbuckers. So I would think it would be quite difficult to copy that sound just with pedals with the setup you have (I'm assuming you don't have a JCM900 or a fender with humbuckers). If u are using a single coiled fender then most of all I'd think you'd need something to fatten up your tone. An eq pedal going into your amp/distortion pedal would do nicely I would think. Not only would it boost the right frequencies but an over all boost would be helpful too. I hear that the secret to that modern hi-gain tone (that we hear lots with bands like fall out boy and some of their heavier cousins) is actually to give your preamp a clean boost from a pedal and drop the amp gain rather than to have the preamp shitting itself, so that might be something to think about. <br>  <br>  Definite +1 on the Boss DS-1. It gets ragged on alot by tone wankers like me, but plenty of pros use them and I reckon for the price it sounds pretty damn good. <br>  <br>  So, yeah, I reckon a pre-distortion eq to give your tone some more balls and an overall boost if u are using single coil pick ups, and maybe look into a clean boost pedal (or an OD pedal with the gain/drive knob turned down).  Also distortion modeling pedals like the ME-50 or the OD-20 (I think that's what its called) isn't too bad and its really great to be able play around with a million types of distortion cos u never know which one will flick your switch.

As a professional classical musician, it means a lot that you are such a music lover. <br>  <br>  Brahms wrote some beautiful works for piano and string quartet, as did  Schubert. There's a wonderful piece for piano and orchestra by John Adams, and though much of it is fast, it has some beautiful slow parts.<br>  <br>  But by FAR my favorite would be Ravel's Piano Concerto in G Major, the second movement. It's sublime, and I think you will love it. <br>  <br>  Best wishese to you!|`|T5DbLLgQaa	Look no further than Chopin -lots of great music there!|`|rNqF4gIVaa	Einaudi's music is pop pap and not classical.

(Most likely there are other people that don't like him, maybe they will jump in) then just hit and dodge. Size really doesn't matter. Since he is bigger he is probably more slower so be quick. Use your size to your advantage. OR, if your not much of a fighter then just tell a trusted adult and ask for advice. Don't mention the guys name be like: Mr/Mrs. Whatever, I have a problem with this dude and I need some advice, could you help me? Try your councilor they will probably offer the most help.

aihogb26aa	Yep, it's pretty much completely live. They have a dress rehearsal in front of an audience on saturday night right before the show from about 8pm-10 pm where they finalize the sketches. They often even cut sketches in dress rehearsal just an hour or so before the show if they don't get a good reaction or if the show runs too long. They are making changes right up until 11:30 PM. The only things that are pre-recorded are the digital shorts/ mini movies/ music videos  and the fake commercials.|`|6vzpHTqQaa	I believe that they are performed live, but they have a whole week of rehearsal to get things like timing down right (and to tweak the dialogues of the sketches).

What I did personally is i talked to a person at my school that video production and he did it with his really extreme editing tools. Also if you upload the video straight to your computer then you can do minor editing (default stuff) such as brightness, contrast, redeye, and others. It depends on your phone as well as the media file. so i would suggest to find out what type of file it is save it to your hard drive on your computer and try editing it with what might be on your computer. <br>  <br>  if you have microsoft office then there is also an editior. <br>  try these few suggestions <br>  then try google but you need to tell us (the people on yahoo answers) more info to best help you|`|kZzasq1laa	Mac:  iMovie.<br>  Windows:  Windows Movie Maker or a trial version of Cyberlink Powerdirector 7 Deluxe!<br>  <br>  And another really cool program...probably wouldn't be used with your video...it's free and you can like put a video ontop of another video.

Don't think that's too unusual to be honest.|`|DufCLIMsaa	The very end of the bed - I think.  Your foot is at the end of you body, so it would make sense if they meant at the end of the bed.  But that isn't the weirdest place - is it?|`|9TE9lOKBaa	it means the very bottom of the bed, where your feet go.|`|wh3EJtZeaa	By the foot of the bed she just means the bottom of the bed, I think she was just being a little sarcastic in Friends, as if to say she hasn't done it anywhere very weird/interesting.|`|O5KOwhovaa	The part of the bed where your feet rest.<br>  <br>  <br>  That's where her head was.

omEC1DWcaa	Well, I suggest that you read the novel itself. It's well worth the time.<br>  <br>  However: <br>  <br>  *SPOILER ALERT*<br>  <br>  the difference is that Ozzy gathers together a team of scientists/artists ect. who create an "alien" and then puts the alien in New York at the same time creating a psychic attack that kills millions of people in New York. So the whole world bands together against this alien, rather than Dr. Manhattan. Also, he kills his three Vietnamese servants with the wine at the end rather than the scientist team.

N62uLMf3aa	See, I had my itunes on shuffle a couple weeks back and The Thompson Twins "King For A Day" came on and it's wierd because all I could think was "this is refreshing" which is weird because I don't think I ever thought like that.

They're always changing their sound, growing as a band, making different music... It's a real treat to hear them grow and change!<br>  <br>  Let me edit, I have more to tell!<br>  <br>  Okay, so here's a track off of their first album "Bergtatt"<br>  <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v2Qrz1dH6jc" rel="nofollow">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v2Qrz1dH6...</a><br>  They really have a black metal sound here, but that doesn't mean they can't be good or different!<br>  <br>  "Kveldssanger" is their second album. Its an incredible folk album! Definitely worth a listen for all music fans!<br>  <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VPQYx0Dxk7g&feature=related" rel="nofollow">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VPQYx0Dxk...</a><br>  <br>  They went back to the black metal sound on "Nattens Madrigal", but its still Ulver. <br>  <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=38_N8IbARMo&feature=related" rel="nofollow">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=38_N8IbAR...</a><br>  <br>  "Themes From William Blake's The Marriage of Heaven and Hell" is when they get to be really different!! I love this album, it stands out so much in the world of music. <br>  <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rIZkNK0_3ZM&feature=related" rel="nofollow">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rIZkNK0_3...</a><br>  <br>  "Perdition City" is my favorite Ulver album! It's absolutely stunning! I would recomend this album to everyone! Here's my favorite track. It's definitely one of my favorite songs of all time. <br>  <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8tJNWFdfuko" rel="nofollow">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8tJNWFdfu...</a><br>  <br>  Here's "Theme 7" from "Lyckantropen Themes" <br>  <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Sh9c55DNBo" rel="nofollow">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Sh9c55DN...</a><br>  It took forever to get my hands onto this album... Its one of the most magnificent pieces of music I've ever bought!<br>  <br>  "Svidd Neger" was another hard one to get. I spent hours searching the internet for it, but I later found it at one of the local stores here. Its another that shows their growth as a band.<br>  <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E0xgDceS6Ro" rel="nofollow">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E0xgDceS6...</a><br>  <br>  I remember when "Blood Inside" came out actually... If I think about it, it was probably one of the first metal albums I bought, even though its not really metal...<br>  <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lg2CaurXsDs&playnext_from=PL&feature=PlayList&p=41D6DC5E32AB39F4&playnext=1&index=23" rel="nofollow">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lg2CaurXs...</a><br>  <br>  "Shadows of the Sun" is just a plain old great album! I love Ulver and everything they've put out, and this is just another great piece to top everything off!<br>  <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bcvKDrDTcp0&playnext_from=PL&feature=PlayList&p=C3643ABDB3909791&playnext=1&index=3" rel="nofollow">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bcvKDrDTc...</a><br>  <br>  I hope my journey through the discography of Ulver was a great trip for everyone!

Its always nice to listen to them because no track or album is really the same!|`|OTFzJbaMaa	call me crazy, but i think disturbed actually have a refreshing sound about them. its like fresh i dont know how to explain it its like walking outside after being cooped up in your house for way too long and breathin the fresh air. * and trust me i know something about that haah*|`|7l5V6CsGaa	The Shins|`|uhZ38xYkaa	Black Tide|`|IYdgEQ4kaa	I prefer the bootlegged warmth of epic hazed out 70's rock shows myself.

9azX3N4Laa	Every Aquarius is different tell me your birth day, birth time and birth location and i can tell you more. This is the average Aquarius.<br>  Sun in Aquarius (Detriment): (High Mind-Low Profile). Astrologers are fond of this eleventh sign of the zodiac, for Aquarius is the sign of the future, of the visionary, some say of astrology itself. Aquarians are unorthodox, original people---sort of wacky, witty madcaps who refuse to follow the crowd and go their own way. You like being different. You not only march to a different drummer, you make up new music as you go along. <br>     Intellectual independence is your most marked characteristic. In the sign of Aquarius, the combination of a fixed quality (representing persistence) and an air element (representing intellect and communication) under the influence of  change, Uranus, creates a personality that is liberal, progressive, yet fixed in opinion. Your inflexibility shows up when others least expect it (in keeping with your penchant for unconventionality). It may be in defense of an idea you have, a trip you’ve decided on, a habit of yours you refuse to give up---whatever the cause, someone will suddenly come in conflict with your Aquarian obstinacy. You refuse to compromise or give an inch. You’re a strange mix of an avant-garde thinker whose opinions are written in stone. You cheerfully ignore what others think and strike off on new paths, unbound by precedent, because there are so many more exciting things for you to discover that way. You think boredom is a communicable disease and take every opportunity to avoid it.<br>     Your character is a system of paradoxes. You enjoy being with people but are content to be alone. You like to travel but love relaxing at home. You are friendly and outgoing but also detached and reserved. You have both a scientific and an artist turn of mind. In career you often are involved in two distinct areas of work. <br>     Your astrological symbol is the water bearer---often Aquarius is mistaken for a water sign. Aquarius is an air sign. You are a communicator, an idea person. People born under this sign live most intensely in their minds. The “water” being poured out by the water bearer stands for truth. You are a truth-teller; you give out opinions and observations. You dispense wisdom. You are a seeker of knowledge, rational, open-minded, gifted with breadth of vision. Chock full of information, you still search for more. You always want to know what lies on the other side of the mountain. One Aquarian recently declared. “It annoys me to find out there’s something out there I’ve never heard of. I need to know what it is!” <br>     You can be objective in judgment, for you don’t let emotion get in the way. This appears to give you the ability to stand outside yourself, to rise above ordinary human frailty. Your built-in distrust of emotion compels you to struggle against its chains, and this may become a source of inner conflict.<br>     Problems arise when your sense of identity becomes inextricably linked to your ideas. Like Gemini, another air sign, you have a lot of ego invested in your opinions. When others disagree, you take this as an attack on your personhood. Your fixity turns into willfulness and rebelliousness for the sake of being a rebel. You deliberately refuse to recognize that your idea isn’t working in the real world of your relationships or career---and you sabotage yourself by insisting on your way even if your way proves to be unfeasible. <br>     You are very people-oriented, addicted to the study of human beings and an inveterate people-watcher. Outgoing and amiable, you attract friends wherever you go. You have a talent for making people laugh with a witty phrase that sums up situation---though those who tangle with you quickly discover how sharp your verbal skills can deflate pomposity and pretension. You possess a true common touch, yet never lose your own strong individuality. Whomever you meet, you remain you---that amusing, inquisitive, interested person who wants to know what makes others tick. Your gift is for dealing with all kinds of personalities from every walk of life, no matter what their station or status. You never put on airs, nor are you cowed by anyone’s wealth or position. If you met the Queen of England, you would be your natural self. We’re all related, you believe, because we’re all human beings. You are genuinely interested in why a person thinks this way or that way. The nicest part is that you do not judge. You willingly grant to others what you consider an inalienable right: the freedom to be unique. For you, the ultimate liberation is simply the freedom to be oneself.<br>     As a student of human behavior, you have great tolerance for the weakness and foibles to which all mankind is heir. You are a humanitarian, concerned with the welfare of the world, but do not get deeply involved in intimate relationships. There is always a certain distant quality to you, a detachment or aloofness of spirit. You seem

ab250551cde4aadbf54a0fea8a7b14e1aa	Escape to Witch Mountain (1975)--Tia (Kim Richards) and Tony (Ike Eisenmann) are two orphaned youngsters with extraordinary powers. You can watch film clips at the first link below.<br>  Escape to Witch Mountain (1995) (TV)--<br>  This '95 remake of the film changes several details of the original. The twins, now named Danny and Anna, are found by Zoe Moon (Perrey Reeves) a young waitress, who notices when the children's hands touch, they create a wave of purple energy. However, before she can do anything, the infant children are separated. Danny and Anna are eventually reunited, adopted by a meany by the name of Edward Bolt, and befriend a shopkeeper.<br>  During one of their outings, Anna uses her powers. As a result, the owner of the shop takes them aside, revealing that he possesses the same powers they do. He goes on to say that there are many more like them, all extraterrestrials from a planet where everyone has a twin. They came to Earth to explore but were unable to return to their home planet. Finally, all the twins go up to the mountain top and are transported home in pairs, with Danny and Anna being the last to leave in a cloud of purple smoke.

A4IaSaaqaa	A saga is a narrative account of a certain event or person's life, though it usually deals with the latter more (kinda similar to how epics narrate a hero's adventures and quest for -insert goal here -). It is also usually long and detailed and can span from the hero's early beginnings up to his very end, including everything that happened in between.<br>  <br>  Arcs are parts or sections of a whole that usually highlights one specific character's life or event. It differs from the saga in the sense that sagas deal with the whole quest or journey thing. Say for example, the entire Dragon Ball franchise can be considered a saga while the part where Goku fought Maginbo is considered an arc. The entire Rurouni Kenshin franchise is also a saga of Kenshin's life, but the specific fight where he fought one of his strongest opponents is referred to as the 'Kyoto Arc.'|`|bsnnEsp5aa	Saga is an account of the main character (the protagonist of that section of the anime OR the main character of the whole anime)<br>  <br>  Arc is a focus on one particular characters story or a section of the story devoted to a side plotline. <br>  <br>  For example.<br>  <br>  The Saga of [Characters name] is the section of the anime devoted to that character and what happens to them<br>  <br>  The Arc of [insert characters name] could be a side character whos story has been brought to attention or a main character but a subplotline or defined section of the plot.<br>  <br>  In the case of Clannad for example, there is an arc devoted to Kotomi even though she is a side character, but the saga is of Tomoya Okazaki (the main character).<br>  <br>  Hope this helps :D|`|MTr4dy3naa	Arcs are part of a saga...like mini sagas in a saga.<br>  They could also be the same.

Maybe he was all too human.<br>  <br>  edit @ calerak. I wouldn't and couldn't argue with you on that.|`|x9WmBlu4aa	was he a human?<br>  or was he dancer?|`|Hcc9fxqJaa	ummmm....... this question is somewhat disturbing sooo<br>  <br>  yeah whatever|`|a4LWildhaa	Probably he did.|`|TJQzViCxaa	has big lips..lol|`|AA10026476	Yes duh, and he's a math genius too|`|547Ln6rNaa	He didn't have a learning disability, he was just to smart for all that crap. Lots of hugely intelligent people did not put in the effort they should have at school. He didn't speak for years - but he was thinking. He was super-human, but I pretty sure he still did what boys do in that department.|`|UKPYoPKuaa	I don't see what you mean about that pic. Theirs nothing obviously wrong with him their.. I don't think many people know this but he had aspergers syndrome, I have aspergers & I've had problems with people percieving me as 'weird' or a 'loner.' We are human but we see the world differently.|`|oRr9SOIqaa	Bahaha like that thing they do - - . . . . . . . . . . . . .|`|xIT3eregaa	If this is a joke, it sucks. But yeah he's a human.|`|VALxlwYSaa	Wft.. <br>  He looks fine? Heck, if he had longer spikier hair he'd look like a lot of 14 year old boys today.|`|70kJJJ7uaa	He was smackin the bishop just like the rest of us. Resistance is futile.|`|CqcEhI2Kaa	Wow he looked sane.|`|R0mZqqfXaa	I doubt it.|`|JDM2UUSOaa	that looks like a brave boy<br>  <br>  you talk about people shaping music and stuff like that.  there's a guy who's shaped the world today<br>  <br>  i guess you could say he shaped modern science<br>  <br>  i'm not into science much so i don't know a whole lot but still<br>  <br>  not many people leave stairs for people to walk but he did<br>  <br>  i bet he didn't do drugs either or hang with the wrong people<br>  <br>  i think he cared for people in a way that wasn't emotional<br>  <br>  or maybe he was just some nut who knew so much stuff about something and just went wild<br>  <br>  there was probably no one there to show him how<br>  <br>  keep the proper proportion ye know<br>  <br>  i bet he was just like well i know i can make these differences so i'm just gonna boot it while i'm alive and discover so much then leave it all for the rest of the world to pick through<br>  <br>  or leave it for them to rediscover|`|TCpWVW4Raa	He's got an interesting look to him!<br>  <br>  @hypocrite, Yeah but I think alot of people that under achieve or do badly at school can have great success. He could have been simply bored or not entertained enough by the education system at that time. I know I wasn't a few years back when I was learning.|`|nUmSMO9oaa	I guess I know what u mean with "what most 14 year old boys do"<br>  <br>  and my answer is: NO, he was NOT a sick b.a.st.ard like you... he didn't do that... he didn't play with himself... LMAO|`|e1a7bc55a49362ce6489ded532083a8eaa	He was one of those special edition humanoids that God unleashes on mankind to tease those wretched creatures!|`|qxqrZuobaa	Lol yeah, I think he DID do what most other 14 Year Olds did. I know what you mean.|`|rzLGCrlfaa	yeah and he thought about his cousin while he did it funny how most history books forget to put that part in but i guess history is written by the winners|`|cSrWQokbaa	Actually he had learning disabilities and almost flunk out of school,|`|P1Ahvv3Saa	I think he was too busy study it and not enough touching.
vewWuiWNaa	The fact that its hard to make friends and that everyone finds it fun to pick/make fun of me because they know i won't attack back with cuss words or by hitting them (in school). If i saw them out of school and they tried that, they would get hurt...I play rugby -insert evil laughter here-|`|vfv7YqhPaa	I hate that I cannot put contacts in my eyes. I want them so badly and I hate my glasses.  Apperently I have to pass a "test" before I can get contacts. I had to sit in a tiny room with this german woman sitting across from me. I sat in that room for like 45 minutes trying to put them on and every time I tried, she would point out every single little mistake. It was so degrading. I had to leave, without success, because my eyes were getting to irritated. UGH!  I don't know what to do.<br>  <br>  <br>  So that's what I hate about myself.|`|j7HncXuuaa	negative thinking-disturbs me and can be a major downer to people around me.|`|wdNl0BB6aa	i have no willpower to do something..<br>  like lose weight i really really want to..<br>  <br>  but i talk i dont do.|`|kwhOcN0taa	My weight, I am too fat.<br>  Plus I'm not popular, and not the person I want to be.|`|P1J8Tg8Qaa	I procrastinate so then Im always in a rush.|`|3reHk4I1aa	i am kindof paranoid and it freaks me out|`|AMZs3LWAaa	My hair-trigger temper! As I get older, I am finding that I have ZERO tolerance for bull***t! I nearly slapped the $hit out of my boss this past Friday because he was acting like a complete tool!|`|gWleYSuIaa	hate?  nope dislike? maybe|`|Jsvz996Baa	I hate that I can't so no to anybody when they ask me to do something 4 them.Im getting better @ saying no.|`|28eea98fddd54ae673d51f8522541419aa	My quick temper. I am always apologizing to family members for flipping out on them.  I know it when I am doing it but I can't seem to stop.|`|3oUSroiZaa	Nothing I'm no EMO!|`|eBHQBeF7aa	That i don't live in Cardiff yet.<br>  But i am in a couple of years.|`|AXAyuFW8aa	my face|`|ekEj2Mbiaa	I care too much.<br>  I care about people too much and have very high expectation for them.<br>  I hate it because whenever I have high hopes for someone, and they don't turn out to be who I think they are, or who I know they can be, I get very dissappointed and it depresses me.<br>  <br>  I'm very sensitive.|`|cw7Ubhh5aa	I hate my awkward shyness because it's very annoying.|`|YbmklSzGaa	Nothing.

I like my personality even if others don't that is their problem.<br>  And my personality, well I get upset extremely easily. if I do one thing I shouldn't have done I will cry no matter how minor it was. <br>  And I am to shy, I don't want people to not like me, I am very timid, and I am also paranoid... I am scared very easily too.|`|CqcEhI2Kaa	My teeth, they're gross because when I was a kid I never wanted to brush my teeth. I have nasty cavities and they're crooked =/ <br>  <br>  But I don't have any insurance so I can't go to the dentist.<br>  <br>  =/ I wish Obama's "Stimulus" could fix that, but it focused on business and insuring honey bees.|`|ffab01a92e978af828e5f1703775e5ddaa	The more I like a girl the harder it is for me to talk to her. If I think someone is just "alright," I can go right up to them no problem. If I think they're beautiful, I hang back and hope they'll talk to me first.|`|HBFHZXybaa	Overobsessing about my weight. Thats all I worry about lately and I can't enjoy life. And my attitude, I hate it sometimes I act such a brat sometimes.|`|mgdkr6hvaa	what's not to love about me? lol<br>  um well hate's a strong word, i don't like that i have suicidal thoughts, and that i kinda have some anger issues.|`|v9bTfQGMaa	My height.

She was so mean too, she knew what i was doing and she got me to talk, cause it was uncomfortable.|`|55Xq3a5Laa	One would be the other day when my english professor said something and I snickered and the entire class knew I had a sexual thought because of it (We were on the topic of Valentine's). Then the professor made a comment about it lol!

vNP5nmiTaa	Man, I have had a lot of sad moments:<br>  <br>  When I left my father's home at 15 with no where to go because I was tired of him beating me. <br>  <br>  When I was 6 years old and my own mother took me to my grandparents so she could get established in a new place/new city for us, and she never came back for me. (Then I went to my ****** dad)<br>  <br>  When my mother-in-law always talked suicide, and attempted twice, then came to my room one morning before she was to go home and in a very eery voice said, "I am leaving....I just...I just wanted to say, good-bye." I let her walk out the door knowing what that meant...she killed herself that night. <br>  <br>  I'm a nurse, and I see people suffer and die...especially cancer patients.

ksya426Uaa	no.. people tend to overreact when someone they were used to seeing as a wholesome 'goody goody' famous personality gets to express theirselves. some people get skeptical when others do something out of the norm they just want to stick to what they were doing :)|`|AA11707096	Not particularly, but she kind of has this sweetie-pie, nice girl image and even though they were not at all racy compared to some, the act itself was questionable for the image she was attempting to create.  Looks like she made it big anyway, so if the pictures did bother anybody, obviously they didn't do anything about it.|`|kJ7mcPLbaa	I haven't even seen them because there are no links anywhere. I don't like her though, she's annoying! Maybe if someone taped her mouth shut permanently, I would feel differently!|`|8bbe5bcc7c0d988a341bc7f24981c504aa	I agree with AGS Girl. she is annoying and has that raspy-sounding voice that just cuts through you.

4imsjgE2aa	I Love Wilson -<br>  <br>  Wilson W. Wilson Jr. (played by Earl Hindman) - Tim's neighbor and confidant, As a child, his parents did not allow him to speak to his neighbors. He proves during an episode that this is the reason he likes talking to Tim and Jill so much. <br>  <br>  A recurring gag was that all of Wilson's face was never shown, the bottom half was invariably hidden by several different props—the most notable of which being the fence in the Taylors' yard. However, there was at least one instance where the bottom half is shown and the top is hidden and another instance where his whole face was shown but he had face paint.|`|fEhR7bOMaa	Wilson's Face - Wilson was inspired in part by a neighbor that Tim Allen had when he was too young to see over his neighbor's fence (and therefore unable to see his neighbor). As a result, the bottom half of Wilson's face was almost never seen on the show. Initially he was always seen with his mouth obscured by the fence; the gag quickly became covering the lower half of his face with other props, wardrobe, set pieces, other characters' heads, or using unconventional camera angles. Occasionally, the top half of his face would be covered leaving only the bottom half visible, and rarely, his entire face would be shown disguised by makeup for a costume. Earl Hindman's face was fully shown following the series finale episode while taking his final bow, though he did come out holding a miniature fence on a stick over the lower half of his face for one last gag. However, his full face is very briefly seen over the fence in the pilot episode. <br>  <br>  <br>  i think its funny, that joke about his face =]

Right when you get to youtube.com it will show a bar where you type in the video you want to see go to the bar and type in power rangers rpm episode 1 and somewhere on the page it will show road to conrith part 1,2, and 3 and that where you can watch the power rangers rpm episodes. They haven't showed the other episodes after road to conrith and fade of balck. The next episode after fade of balck won't come until march 14th. So on youtube.com they are only gonna have road to conrith and fade of balck. Good Luck.

vH2OF9z8aa	he sounds like A sexy and exciting person, daring in their actions, cocky in their attitude, and utterly without fear. Absolute sincerity, coupled with violent emotions that swing wildly from one extreme to another. Boundless creativity and lust for a change of both pace and place. The rapid approach, or more likely departure, of something that sets your world ablaze. Often suggests travel or escape. <br>   The card second from the top of the staff represents your hopes, fears, or an unexpected element that will come into play. King of Pentacles: The essence of earth behaving as air, such as a diamond: A true businessman, with a gift for identifying opportunities and taking advantage of them. A person well informed about the world, skilled in all things physical, and eager to encourage others. A pillar of practicality and dependability, embracing tried and tested methods, and possessing an innate understanding of the material reality. A philanthropist and devotee of both luxury and hard work, whose word is as good as gold. <br>   The card at the top of the staff represents the ultimate outcome should you continue on this course. Seven of Cups (Temptation): Daydreams and things seen in the glass of contemplation. The scattering of energies by strong desires and unrealistic goals. The pursuit of illusions and the dissipation of energy on false choices. Intoxication, delirium, and hallucination, leading to the negation of effort. Under rare and extreme circumstances, may indicate the revelation of transcendental spiritual truth.|`|gUUtGcbBaa	he will forgive you just give him some time to cool off and stuff...trust me ...give him time and he will realize how much he misses you and come back to you.|`|jrmvEmEKaa	Scorpios and Caps or Virgos are more of a soul mate match but that's just how every astrology book and website thinks. Pisces are an emotional sign and love to be in love and fall easily too!  Scorpios are intensive and have emotions and can be very strong on it. If you are in love with a Scorpio, please be 100% honest and be faithful to them, because they are possessive and get jealous and HATE to be betrayed by anyone and will always remember and hold a grudge til they die.  They are also very serious when it comes to love so be careful. Scorpios also like to have one romantic interest and  be serious about it. If you want to date him, make sure you make you're choice and be solid with it, for Scorpios love the respect and honesty and being monogamous in a relationship.

CcgDj9GIaa	Most Taurus women are indeed not like that (as you stated).  I myself am a Taurus woman and don't behave in that manner.  Are you sure it's because she's a Taurus?  What about her ascending/moon signs?  Perhaps these are the culprits?  Moon signs tend to delve from within the person, try and find out what her moon sign is, find her weakness, and work with that to your benefit to keep her away from you.<br>  <br>  And like the poster above me stated, Geminis are great at intellectual conversations/arguments (I should know, I dated one before -_-)  Try to use your smooth words to keep her at bay, and convince your coworkers that this woman is nothing but trouble and should be kept away from her for the most part.<br>  <br>  Good Luck|`|BLmfR6Ezaa	Hey! Don't say that about us Taurus Girls!<br>  haha|`|WUKDoGJRaa	All the Taurus WOMEN (not men) I know are sooo superficial and jealous. You can tell they are thinking more than they're saying. Very sneaky. They haaaaate when you steal the spot light and will go out of their way to get attention and make you look bad. It's annoying. I dont get along with them.|`|7rrNvFK7aa	you can always invite her to a bullfight and throw her in the ring if she is 2-faced. Ignore her. Gemini is a good sign and you are twins. So get the two of you to send her a wheelbarrow full of words. Nobody can out-talk a Gemini.<br>  That's weird that you can't shut her up with words....Hmmm|`|fgK1zOSiaa	Are you sure it's only a "bit" of scorpio?  <br>  <br>  Sometimes the things we find most annoying in others are the things we like least about ourselves.|`|HEnAekUxaa	shoot her with a tranquilizer dart.
OUkiotELaa	truth or dare is boring. play something else. like hide and seek. no matter how old u are, u never get too tired of playing that wonderful game!<br>  <br>  Or, do only DARE. No truth. Truth just makes the whole thing lame. Make little cards that have different dares for a person and place them in the middle. (e.g. Card 1: Maggie - I dare you to cover your face and knock on the neighbor's door, and spray them with water from the hose.)<br>  <br>  Try these:<br>  - Gather eggs and throw them at a nearby car<br>  - Smell socks<br>  - Dance like a retard and have someone video tape it<br>  - Eat chili powder for 30 minutes<br>  - Have the person with the worst voice sing a song and video tape it<br>  - Prank call a neighbor with *67 before the number {If you have their phone number) and tell them if they want to donate to the local charity foundation. If they say yes, say this: "Alright. Our conversation has been recorded. You will donate $4,000 every month. If you deny, then you can be in trouble legally. You have no option. Now, will that be in check or cash?"<br>  If they say no, then say the same thing. <br>  - Scream like you need serious help and make sure your neighborhood knows that it is coming from your house. Scream this: "HELP!!! PLEASE!!! SOMEONE IS TRYING TO....AAAAAHHHH!!!!!!!!" <br>  Sound like your being murdered. If anyone comes knocking on your doorbell, open it and talk with them like you don't even know what's going on.<br>  <br>  OR<br>  <br>  If anyone rings the doorbell. Don't answer it for a LOOOONG time. If they knock harder, still don't answer it. If they call the police, and the police come, answer the door and act like nothing happened.<br>  Best of luck to ya!|`|EjyD1sXeaa	attempt a 20 second handstand<br>  coat your tongue with sugar (or salt!) and swallow<br>  dance around the room for 30 seconds<br>  do a cartwheel<br>  limbo under a stick held by 2 other people see how low you can go<br>  swap your jersey with another player<br>  loudly sing your favourite song<br>  act like you've been shot<br>  crawl on all fours pretending to be an animal of group's choice<br>  do 5 push ups<br>  do 5 crunches<br>  mime pouring a cup of tea<br>  mime getting dressed<br>  dance with a cuddly toy as your partner|`|IKg9iiG7aa	dare: run down to the end of the street and back, naked<br>  truth: don't have 1 soz

AA10522987	It would be helpful to know what kind of event you are going to see (concert, hockey, etc).<br>  <br>  Generally speaking, HP Pavilion isn't any worse than the other arenas in the area.  Keep in mind that the whole arena holds less than 18,000 people - a bit smaller than most.<br>  <br>  Section 201, row 4 are actually good seats for being in the upper deck.  When I watch the Sharks, I am usually 9-10 rows up in the upper deck - no complaints.  The seats in section 201, row 1 usually sell for more than parts of the lower deck.<br>  <br>  The only thing that is a bit annoying about the upper deck is that the seats aren't raked as steep as they could be, so if the person in front of you leans forward, it obscures some of your view.  This is probably not a problem for concerts, but it's mildly annoying during hockey games.

kjAQj3i7aa	You don't have to be famous to be a model. The vast majority aren't.

Good luck!|`|ksya426Uaa	im sorry. no.<br>  i think that's the guy from the movie eragon or storm breaker lol|`|0UK5mRcQaa	I've never seen him on any advertisments so I'd say no. I think this guy is trying to trick you. You gotta be careful with people online!

JY4YLoh1aa	in the beginning of the movie, there was a little girl playing hide and seek in the house. she saw what happened to her friend when he went inside the house so she knew what went on there. her purpose was to serve as sort of a warning that Juan didn't listen to. also, the reason Juan didn't have the knife wound was because the Juan in the "other world" didn't have the wound, and when Juan went back in for his kid, he got trapped there and the ghost Juan got out. That is also why his wife was flipping out in the amulance screaming "You're not Juan." Confusing, yes.<br>  <br>  I watched that movie last night with a friend and we laughed quite a bit when you see the ghost chilling under the bed.

Then open up iTunes and plug in your iPod (this makes it a whole lot easier to put the lyrics on). Go to the song you're putting lyrics on and hit "Get Info." Then copy and paste the lyrics onto that page. Then eject your iPod and you're all set.

Ow3O7h4caa	Myspace has templates already, try them out. The worse thing that can happen is to remove it and substitute with the existing template. That is a personal question. What I like or others like doesn't mean you will like it.<br>  Take a look at your friends 'myspeace' and ask them what they think.
