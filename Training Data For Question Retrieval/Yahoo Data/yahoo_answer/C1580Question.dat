20090205034034AAbnc8V	Travel;United States;New Orleans	Is French still spoken in Louisiana?	Some French textbooks show that French is spoken in lots and lots of areas in the world (especially in Africa) and that it is spoken even in Louisiana, the United States.  Admitting that Louisiana was first developed by the French settlers in the long past, it's a bit hard to believe that it is still spoken there.  Texas used to be a Mexican territory, but the Texans now speak English, not Spanish.    If it is true, how much is it different from standard French?  And don't they have any difficulty in making a conversation with people from mainland France?

It is a small city and it seems very difficult to track down blades/skates in my size - and the stores I've been to tell me that it's impossible for them to order in my size. I was advised to look in Taiyuan, Xi'an, or even Beijing or online. I can't read/write much Chinese and so my online ability is limited.      Is anyone able to tell me where I might have more success? I would prefer blades (inline skates) but if I can only find skates then that would be okay as well.      If anyone knows a Chinese retailer or manufacturer website that lists them in this size that would be more than enough, as I have Chinese friends who can provide me with translations.

20090205044128AAzEuoV	Travel;Asia Pacific;Malaysia	Will you continue or quit this job if you were me?	In this kind of situation:   - Two bosses and two women colleagues   - One of the bosses sit beside me, whatever i do he can see (the other woman designer colleague is sandwiched between the 2 bosses, (i was on the right side) which seem fine for her as they are really close, like family. Another woman admin is slighty away from my desk)   - Boss delayed a month only gave me confirmation letter which dated back a month earlier.( which i think so that he could have 1 month extra to consider whether he want me or not)   - I have been working for more than 8 months, and:-   - Never give me any access card to enter the office, but other colleagues all have   - 1 access card is hung on the partition of the admin, so whenever  i need to go toilet, i can take the card from there but have to put it back right after i come back from toilet. (inside office doesn't have any toilet)   - so every morning when i reach the office, i have to press the door bell    - bosses never let me email feedback to client, even when every time the designs are confirmed and only slight changes, i will have to email the changes to the bosses. they will feedback themselves. But the woman designer colleague can feedback client, i can't   - the woman admin colleague can send email to client too, but i cant   - bosses never introduce suppliers to me, so whenever my designs are confirmed, i have to give my files to the woman designer colleague, she will output/send the files to supplier, if the woman designer is busy, boss will do it. The bosses will never  train me/allow me to do output or get to know the supplier.   - Client never know me, supplier never know me. Even when supplier come to the office, boss never introduce. If client comes to office and accidentally sees me, boss will say something like. "she is colleague", no name introduced.   - i cant use the phone as no one will call me also    ( all these make me feel like a ghost designer, or like a "mistress". Unlike my previous companies, i got to deal with client and supplier, which gave me a sense of importance and accomplishment)   ( i think they might be scared that i might steal their clients, because i think that might just be what they did to their previous employers, that's why they didn't introduce me any client. They told me before they become bosses they were also designers working for agency. And as far as i know they first set up a company at somewhere, later moved here and changed the company's name also. They didn't tell me this, i accidentally found out when i saw a company's name frame kept inside the store area when they tidy up, and they have boxes of letterheads printed with the same name)   - sometimes when my designs are confirmed, they just copied my files from the computer and output without telling me, later only i know when the printout is sent to office by the supplier and put on the desk and i happen to see it is my design.   - When i ask bosses some questions, they need to really think before they want to teach me any knowledge   - i have taught them more things than they have anything to teach me   - When i went interview, the 2 women colleagues were sitting inside silently listening to my interview as well, i didn't know because i didn't see inside as it was covered. later only i found out. (it was a small office too)   - the two woman colleagues know my salary (which i think shouldn't happen, if in small company only the bosses can know. In big company only the HR can know n must keep confidential   - the 2 women colleagues and bosses are so close, they know each other's friends, previous colleagues, relatives, etc Most of the time when they chat something or someone in very incomplete sentence, they all understand. I never get to know anything   - although bosses are quite generous in spending lunch a few times, but they really are kiasu about the work   - everytime go out eat lunch (drive car), i have to follow, as they are more afraid to leave me alone in their office   - even before sending the visual to client, boss himself want to change here change there (which are all minor details, move this point up a bit, the small line  dont want lar, not nice etc). There are some designs done by me clients liked them very much, but client will never know is me who did the designs. Because i was not introduced to anyone. So clients think the designs were done by bosses themselves and compliment them, like" i'm so impressed by you"   - the place is so damn cold (centralised air-con, i dont really blame this , just to add in), and my chair is so uncomfortable(unadjustable and cant move, like the chair for people to sit at the government office), sit on the edge side the chair will move forward and fall. But all of their chairs are executive nice leather chairs with adjustable height, and can lean forward and lie on the back type)   - When year end dinner, bosses and the 2 woman colleagues will bring spouse and children to eat together but for me, only i was invited (didn't invite my

OPTIONS:      * Lake Forest and Redwood City, California   * Connecticut-Storrs, Connecticut   * Miami, Florida   * Atlanta, Gerogia   * Chicago, Illinois   * Coon Rapids, Iowa   * Louisville, Kentucky   * Mendon, Massachusetts   * Beatrice, Nebraska   * Santa Fe and Albuquerque, New Mexico   * Eugene, Oregon   * Houston, Texas   * Ogden, Utah   * Arlington, Virginia   * Washington DC, Bellevue, Brewster and Seattle      Thanks to anyone who takes the time to read this and answer! :)

I dont speak Italian so well but i am learning.   Please can you explain each paragraphs in your own italian words but simplified? (dont translate it to english just simplify it the simple but good perfect italian)   Its based on medieval history explaining the historical events during the medieval period.    I need to give a speech on it...   All help will be greatly appreciated   Here it is (please ignore all punctuations as it may have been written in a slight rush):      Cristianita   Dopo le grandi invasioni del IX e X secolo (vichinghi, unghari,saraceni) L'assetto politico e la sicurezza nel continente europeo si consolidano grazie al bastione rappresentato rappresentato dall'impero bizantino, alla nascita di una cintura protettiva di regni cristiani   (Ungheria, Polonia,Bulgaria ,Principato di kiev alla controffensiva christiana in sicilia e spagna e alle crociate in terrasanta. Per gli uomini del medioevo, tuttavia non esisteva una nozione   di europa se non in senso puramente geografico . Era il concetto di Cristianita a definire la comunita culturale e religiosa del continente.      Europa feudale    Il perno del sistema di potere nell'europa tardomedievale era constituito dal sistema feudale affermatosi tra IX e xi secolo, ed incentrato su una rete di rapporti di dependenza tali che,   alla concessione di un beneficio consistente di norma nella signoria su un determinato territorio (il feudo) corrispondevano una serie di obblighi di reciproca fedeltà e mutuo soccorso.   Questa rete, che in origine legava sostanzialmente il sovrano ai nobili più potenti,allentò e allargò progressivamente le propie maglie fino a configurare una serie di signorie autonome e un intreccio straordinariamente complesso di rapporti di dipendenza, di cui   i sovrani non detenevano più il controllo. Nei territori di loro pertinenza i signori feudali esercitavano un potere coercitivo nei confroniti delle popolazioni contadine e amministravano la guistizia.      il numero degli uomini   tra il 1000 e il 1300 si verificò in Europa un imponente cresita demgrafica. Se è impossibile determinarne le cause in modo univoco, si puo tuttavia indicare un insieme di fenomeni di    diversa natura che favorirono l'incremento della popolazione miglioramento delle condizioni ecologiche, fine delle invasioni consolidamento del sistema feudale, diminuzione dell'infanticidio   e, soprattutto, la possibilita di cui cominciarono a godere i servi di coltivare autonomamente la terra. L' aumento della mandopera conseguente all'incremento demografico portò alla    colonizzazione di vaste regioni europee fino allora occupate da foreste o da paludi.      il progresso delle tecniche    Agli inizi del XIII secolo la societa medievale aveva carattere prevalentemente agricolo: la terra era la principale fonte della richezza e del prestigio socale , L'aumento demografico fu sostenuto da da importanti perfezionamenti delle tecniche agrarie : impiego dall' aratro pesante,rotazione triennale delle colture, diffuzione del mulino ad acqua, maggiore produzione e miglor qualita degli utensili (dovute ai progressi della metallurgia ). Le rese agricole aumentarono atestandosi mediamente intorno al rapporto di 1;4, 1:5 (ciò communque, non provoco un considerevole miglioramento delle condizioni di vita dei contadini).      la ripresa del urbanesimo    incremento demografico e aumento della produttività agricola stimolarono lo sviluppo urbano, particolarmente evidente in italia, in fiandra, Nella valle ddel Reno. La città a sua volta esercito ma forte attrazione sulle campagne, diventando punto di riferimento dell' attività agrocola e dando ai servi che vi si trasferivano, per diventare operai o artigianai, la possibilità di ottenere a libertà.Sempre più si accentuò la divisione tra attività rurali e attività urbane.

Calling me her Mahal ko..  She is asking me to promise to her that i will serve her and be there for her...   I know for a fact she has told her mother and father and various friends...   Her brothers are very, very, very protective over her and don't like the idea of her getting attached to a white European guy...   Her friends are also against it and say she is turning her back on the Filipino culture...     Is she serious about wanting forever?  Promising to serve me in the future?  And telling me that i have to adjust a little...?    This is moving way too fast and i am worried about her brothers and/or friends being hostile towards me... As they have something called "Filipino pride"...     She is here in the UK before anyone suggests marriage scams, but i just want to know how serious she could be ...   Being a Pinoy Filipino...    Thanks all answers are appreciated and opinions too...

I want to be able to receive and send MMS.    I already called Smart, and they told me to text MMS ON and send to 3401. This is supposedly to configure the SIM pack. They cannot configure the model yet because (according to the one I talked to through *888,) they don't have the Samsung U600 in their database yet.     I followed their advice re: sending that text to 3401. I did not receive any confirmation messages, so I texted MMS ON again, sent to 3401.    3401 replied saying " Service feature is already active."    So it means I just need to figure out how to configure my phone. Does anybody know how? I called Samsung 1800-SAMSUNG, they told me to text MMS ON send to 2333, or try texting SET MMS U600 and send to 211.    I did all these, but I have not received any confirmation messages.    What do I do now? I really need to send and receive MMS asap. Can somebody please offer their expertise on this? I feel like I'm going in circles.

20090205074632AAUGKJg	Travel;Africa & Middle East;Israel	How is Christian extremism any different to Islamic extremism when it comes to the subject of Israel?	I am wondering if there is any difference in these two forms of extremism?  Besides of course, the obvious, that they are two different religions.    Some fundamental things that strike me as similar are these:  1- They both think there should be no separation of church and state, but with their own prospective religions being the rulers.    2-  They both are willing to use, or condone violence to get there points across.  3-  They both are dogmatic, and intolerant of other religions.    Now, when it comes to Israel, they both think that they are the ones who are right.  We already know that Muslim fundamentalists do not want a state of Israel.  But the difference is, some of them are just fighting occupation, whilst others just want every Jew out of the country.  This was not the case pre- 1948  Now, from what I have been seeing from posts on this site from Fundamentalist extremist Christians, they have no qualms about condoning, and even supporting violence and killing in Israel, with money, and political support.  They agree with ethnic cleansing.  As one 'Christian' poster put it, she thinks every single Arab should be kicked out of Israel, and all it's occupied territories.  If they refuse to go, they should be forced out with violence, and if they fight it, they should be 'blown to kingdom come'.  She lumps all of them together.  This person has also condoned the actions of General John Pershing, who was said to have murdered Muslims by having them dig their own graves, dipping bullets in pig blood and fat, and shooting them, then burying them with the dead pigs.  The extremist Christians do not understand how the 'heathen' Arabs can not understand that their biblical version of God gave Jews the land they themselves had been living on for hundred, maybe even thousands of years in some cases.  They expect them to bow to their own 'christian' doctrine, and call them terrorists when they won't oblige by leaving Israel.    The Christians believe it is their business to do this, aid and abet the Israeli's in ethnic cleansing of Israel, because then they believe the second coming of Christ will happen.    To me, this is ridiculous, just as much as Fundamentalist Muslims and extremist Muslims behaviour.  But somehow the Christian extremists don't understand that their actions are just as bad, and worthy of the label of terrorist.  Why is this?  Also, I am giving the person who brought up John Pershing's 'methods' as she puts it, a chance to explain what she meant by this.  What were the methods you were talking about?  If you think you are right, you will have no problem in explaining yourself.

The link:    http://arabnews.com/?page=1&section=0&ar...       The headline:   Al-Manie responds to NSHR concern on child marriage      The story:   JEDDAH: Health Minister Hamad Al-Manie responded yesterday to a letter sent by the National Society for Human Rights (NSHR) regarding child marriage by asserting that such practice could inflict physical and psychological damage to the young girls.      The NSHR had sent a letter to the minister regarding the guidelines and procedures surrounding how premarital testing should be performed as related to marriages of young girls.      In his response Al-Manie underscored the adverse health effects that pregnancy can have on young girls, including anemia, miscarriage and high blood pressure, which can lead to kidney failure, hemorrhaging, and seizures. He also mentioned that there is a significant increase in cesarean sections and mortality resulting from complications during childbirth by girls.      In addition, to these health effects, other consequences of underage marriage also can have detrimental effects on the unborn children of underage spouses. Citing the same report, Al-Manie also said that suffocation of the fetus within the mother’s womb could occur from intense restriction of blood necessary in feeding the unborn child.       ...      ___________      Follow up question:      How does the government convince people to not emulate the Prophet Mohammed in this one aspect?

Then maybe drive up to Savannah, GA (we're big "Midnight in the Garden of Good and Evil" fans).  Can anyone tell me if the beaches at St. Augustine are warm in June?  I know Florida is generally warm, but I really like it hot.        It's either that or we head over to Tampa, definitely do Busch Gardens, and then make our way over to the Naples area.  We both like adventure and wild activities, but we're not much for nightlife, so we're not interested in Miami.      Thank you!

I'm 12 years old and my father is 73, and we are thinking about moving to the Philippines this Summer, and together we make about $4600 a month on social security, insurance fees, etc. maybe a little more. Anyway, would it be possible to live like a king in the Philippines. For example, a five bedroom apartment with 3 bathrooms, and such. And where could we live the best with that money. Not to much in the rural areas, but not in the heart of the city either. I've been reading up on the Philippines, and I've heard that you can get a cook or maid for about $30 a month, plus the cost of food, and a room. Thanks, David      PS: Where can I live, and how well, some details would be helpful.

My mother wanted me to come in the US, but I don't like it here much. I am currently in college. I am like a puppet being controlled, I never wanted to chose RN, but I seem to be doing okay...btw, am still taking the prerequisite - I just need Microbiology and AnP. She wants me to join the army, navy, or marines, but I don't want to. We couldn't agree that I didn't want the benefit of joining the army - I DON'T WANT TO! I am fine, atm. I don't like this place as well ( bloody snow ). I want to move on, and I am not worried abotut her because my bro and step dad will be with her. Maybe I could transfer to Aus, other than quitting college. So yea...what are the procedures - buy airline ticket online, bring passport, driver's license..what else? I have friends living in Aus, I could stay with them for the mean time.

20090204214426AAZzyNK	Travel;United States;Phoenix	Finding nature in AZ?	I moved to AZ about 2 years ago, and got married not long after that.  In all of the hubbub of a new place and a new life, I lost touch with my spirituality to an extent.  My husband is currently deployed, and while he's gone I've been working on getting back in touch.  Recently a friend back home suggested that I take a trip somewhere alone for a few days to a place where I can be alone with nature and my thoughts.  Finding such a place in the general Mesa area had proven to be quite difficult, so I was wondering if anyone had any suggestions.  I'm not adverse to a short car ride, I'm just looking for a place to stay for a few days, out away from general civilization but not too dangerous (i.e. I really don't want to camp in the open desert where I may be attacked by coyotes or snakes when I get in their way).  I was thinking Flagstaff as I've been there before, but I'm not too hip on driving up the mountain in my tiny car.  I just don't know much about Arizona yet.

There is so much information to go through and I am getting a bit lost!.      So far we have done as much as decide to get married. I have applied for my Certificate of No Impediment and my police record when I have this will travel to Morocco when we will get the Certificate of No-Objection and the Certificate of Nationality.      I know you have to go to a family court so could we for example get the certificates on wednesday and go to the court on friday and use the days in between to go to the doctors and the police there? After the court say it is ok can we then go and get married straight away?      My man thinks you can just do it all at the same time so there is no need to book anything, you just turn up.      How long should I expect to be in Morocco? I just don't want to have any problems at work.      I would really like to speak to someone who has done this whole process and now has their husband with them in the UK. I came back from Morocco on Monday and it just gets harder and harder every time I leave and so many times I have been close to just giving up everything here and going there but I know it will be bad because there is no work and my French and arabic is limited so it is worth letting this ride and one day it will all be over and we can be together.      Thank you.      My email address is joannev16@hotmail.co.uk if you would like to email me.

20090205082505AAqpUub	Travel;United States;Honolulu	Should I take the chance to move to Hawaii before visiting?	So ive never been to Hawaii before but I have had friends who have been and they have all said they loved it there and want to move out there. My situation is, I hate where I live right now but I got this opportunity to move out to Hawaii for a job. The longer I wait to accept the offer, the higher the chance someone else may take the position before me.  Now the only thing good about staying where I am right now is, even tho I hate where I live and bored with it, I feel I have dug myself a nice little hole and have gotten in my comfort zone and can save up alot of money. But whats holding me back from moving to Hawaii is that I have never been there before and im worried it may be a complete culture shock to me and I may end up regretting my decision. I dont know what to do. Should I take the chance and move to Hawaii even tho I never stepped foot there once or should I be more wise about it and stay where I am and wait for other opportunities in the future?

My wife and I along with another couple are going to Tenessee this weekend and we are looking for a place to go and hang out. We are all around the age of 30 so not really looking for a piano bar type place, just somewhere to go and dance. Also don't want just a restaurant with a bar like Applebees or something like that. If anyone knows of anything please let me know. Thanks.
