BB6HGbnPaa	Its how long you can run a mile. So my running pace would be 6 minute/mi. and the 2nd mile would be 12 minute/2mi|`|AA10241450	Running pace in generic terms is how fast are you running generally expressed in miles per hour in America for distances over 800 meters or km/hour for countries using the metric system. <br>  <br>  How long does it take to run 1KM is probably best measured by running around a regular track or 2 laps and 200 meters.  Probably best to look at pace tables which will come in handle for racing.  Good luck on your running.|`|V7k55BC6aa	Your running pace is usually measured by your average mile time, or at least, by what I understand. I'm a competitive distance runner, so I'm also familiar with the term "Race Pace" - which is the pace you run at during a race. These are different.

5x5Bpq2Saa	I go by about 20,000.<br>  You'll want to do the the barrel and the feeding chamber with silicone spray.  Just spray for maybe one second at most into the barrel.  Fire some shots to get the extra cleared out.  Then the same for the feeding chamber.<br>  <br>  Then for the gearbox, use a gear grease and just apply to the gears.  Make sure you clean out the old grease and dirt before putting in the new grease|`|268Rwp6zaa	If I remember correctly you are supposed to properly lubricate your gun's barrel and hop-up area (I'm sorry the name escapes me; it's inside the magazine well, where the BB's are fed into, there's probably a piece of plastic that will fit around your magazine feeding hole) every 3,500-5,000 shots or so, 1,000-3,000 for gas guns. If you install a precision barrel, you are supposed to clean it after each use! But I'm assuming your is stock so...<br>  <br>  Lets start with the barrel.<br>  <br>  First, make sure that the gun is on safety, the battery is removed, the magazine is removed, and the hop-up is set to neutral. First, you should take the cleaning/unjamming rod that came with your gun and make sure it's nice and straight. Then get some soft cloth (I use cloth diapers, and they are excellent) and cut a strip about 1 cm wide and about 6-8 cm long. Then feed it through the cleaning side of the rod. Wrap it around so that it is secure and evenly distributed on it or else it will be too thick in one spot and won't go into your barrel. Then take some *100% silicone spray* and spritz the cloth so that it gets coated, but not drenched with oil. Then carefully try to slide it down the barrel. If it doesn't fit, try making it more even or cutting a bit off the length, and try again. Go slowly down until you cannot anymore. DO NOT FORCE IT!Once you have reached the bottom, pull it back up/out in a twisting motion. Once it's out, inspect the cloth. If it is dirty, then repeat the process with a new piece of cloth until it comes out clean.<br>  <br>  As for the place that I forget  it's name, Just hold the spray maybe about 3 cm away from the feeding hole and spray for about .5-1 second. Not much to this one. Don't over-lube.<br>  <br>  You may also want to lube your magazine. Open up your hatch (If it's a hi-cap) and spray some into the reservoir real quick, and some through the feeding hole as well.<br>  <br>  You will see a decrease in accuracy for about 100 shots, but it will correct itself and be even better than before; it's just cleaning the extra oil out of the system.<br>  <br>  You will see an increase in accuracy and maybe even a bit of an increase in FPS, and will help prevent jamming.<br>  <br>  If you are confident in your knowledge of your AEG, you may want to re-grease your gears, but if you don't know how to do this, don't try. Clean out the old grease first!<br>  <br>  <br>  Hope I helped!|`|AA11806779	As far as the barrel goes, you should clean with the lube (almost none should be left) as if too much is left it will mess with the accuracy, and the same goes up with the hop-up bucking. Use silicon spray for this, most airsoft stores carry it.<br>  For the gearbox you will have to use a different kind of "greasier" lubricant, and your going to have to take it apart, clean most of the parts (within reason) and apply the stuff to what pieces move (gears, piston head, etc) though be careful not to put too much and cause undue friction. Oh, and if you haven't already, it might be worthwhile to add metal bushings and reshim it.<br>  good luck!

74c2c81fbc662051f28724d07c2a0b98aa	okay good question i asked my trainer this same question. he told me that max running is four to five times a week. That's only once a day. If you are not careful you can start to tear your cartilage in your legs. I had done that before and it is not fun. <br>  <br>  I make sure that when i run I make it worth the time. If you still have energy later on in the day it's best that you just wear yourself earlier. Make meals smaller at dinner. If losing weight is your goal then drinking A LOT of water helps you energize your muscles and body for your next run. I run over an hour 4-5 times a week. If later on i feel i have energy i'll do quick sprint but then ice your legs immediately or the muscles will freak out. <br>  <br>  <br>  good luck!|`|hK3McnOqaa	if u enjoy running and u really want to burn fat, u should deffinetely run again after dinner, infact, u could also do half an hour of running after work or school. the more u run, the more fat u will burn but if u get too tired, try not to strain yourself.<br>  <br>  hope this helps|`|V7k55BC6aa	If you aren't a competitive runner, a half an hour to and hour in the morning is fine. Of course, there are other factors such as pace and strain, but on average a good 30 minutes or hour of running should burn  fat fast!|`|8to6MsWuaa	20-30 min. is good. You don't need to run twice a day. a 30 minute run should be just fine. Keep up the good work.|`|BB6HGbnPaa	you never want to eat on a full stomach so maybe thats why u feel sloppy after dinner. if you running to compete, run at LEAST 5 times a week. but if its to get in shape, probably run 2-3 miles 3 times a week. u dont want to run twice a day because the first time you run, u would be tired alrdy and wouldnt have enough energy. plus.after a run, u feel pretty tired and dont even want to do it anymore.

Gj8JTJGRaa	It is said that if you hit someone hard enough in the jaw it will knock them out that's why in boxing they have to cover their chin.<br>  <br>  but i`de say the most painfull would be the nose form my experience in life.|`|Ghiy6Cwlaa	nose|`|HVTXfd8Laa	I think it would be nose.|`|4a4c6f67f834620fbf409b518828d5d4aa	Most definitely the nose hurts the most, I have taken many punches to the eyes, cheeks, ears, forehead and jaw/chin but the most pain comes from being hit in the nose.  I did quite well in my match last September until I took a good punch to the nose, I started to see stars, felt light headed and had a hard time regaining my composure.  I did finish the fight, the scores were punch for punch even,  though my opponent won for the two knockdowns in the three rounds after clocking me in the nose.<br>  <br>     Most definitely: "THE NOSE"|`|xUKSGsx8aa	i would say first the eye so that the person can't see then the jaw...dat way the pain would last and it would be double pain cuz first of all there is no vision then there is a swollen pain in the jaw...|`|AA11459304	I agree with everyone else. The nose because the feeling last longer. Next would be the jaw.|`|nfJeZ27Haa	alot of people are saying the nose but i say a nice direct hit in the eye is definatly worse atleast the nose has alittle bone for protection but the eye is just completely soft and it blinds u... in my experience the eye is worse<br>  <br>  EDIT: i still say the eye... idk everyones diffrant and dont get me wrong the nose hurts but ive been hit real hard right square in the nose in more then 1 occasion and even tho it hurt the eye seemed worse for me... i guess u wont know until u get hit in the face then u will draw ur own conclusion|`|0H62CSkKaa	the nose by far.  when you get punched in the nose, your nerves go out of thier way to make it hurt.  a hard enough blow to the nose can push your nose up into your brain.    <br>  <br>  P.S.

ptQ5SkPVaa	There is an upside to this. As bad as Don West is and he can still keep a job gives me hope that I will land a job in wrestling when I get old enough. If West can do it then so can we.<br>  I think it should be Nash, he was pretty good at it and since he can't really wrestle anymore it would give him something to do.|`|UWJinEbIaa	...who else is going to shrill the TNA merchandise over the interwebs?  Don West is the best salesman the company has :)|`|smcDn76jaa	I do believe that's Jeff Jarret's decision. I'm pretty sure VInce Russo was buddy buddy with Jarret back in their WCW days. That's why he has a job. I have no idea what Don West to get a job. He does suck at the table. I would rather have Chet Lemon and Black Snow. Maybe throw in Tenay for some seriousness.
H3nbC71eaa	I think it would be a good idea to use them for a Wrestlemania. It might be something old but I think it would be something new to the young kids watching Wrestlemania, I think it would intrigue them. I know when I saw Wrestlemania III it was a nice twist to the entrances.<br>  <br>  The only problem is that back then the entrances weren't as spectacular and filled with fireworks as they are today. So there was nothing really to miss from a wrestler's entrance besides them walking to the ring. Back then it was something different done in an entrance.<br>  <br>  Today the entrances are more elaborate...so though it would be interesting to watch it might take away something from the entrances of the wrestlers. Maybe they can still do the fireworks in the ramp away..after that then have the wrestler hop on the mini ring and have it drive them down to ringside.<br>  <br>  It has to be done in a big arena though..like has been said the Pontiac Silverdome was huge..so that played a factor into using the mini rings...but I think as long as the Stadium is big enough it can work.|`|xKXu0Qb2aa	I'd like to See it Again , but it Probably Wouldn't be a Good Idea.<br>  The Kiddies Wouldn't Understand it , & Entrances Have Gotten So Creative in the last 22 Years , that it would Actually Take AWAY from Them.<br>  <br>  Do You Really Want to MISS Undertaker's or HBK's , or Edge's or Y2J's Entrances?|`|97jqpA54aa	I dont really think so <br>  I feel a big rush when a superstar comes down the ramp<br>  the mini rings wouldn't give people the same feeling|`|VlvektSJaa	I think only Legends should get the mini ring entrances.|`|gXeDKVLJaa	yer true that would be good 4 like 1 match<br>  <br>  with a couple of legends|`|OLxM59Abaa	Interesting idea, but personally i wouldn't do it. One of the major reasons they did this for wrestlemania III was because the ramp to the ring was so long and it would have taken forever for the wrestlers to get to the ring. I have been in the Reliant Stadium where WM25 is being held and it is no where near the size of the Pontiac Silverdome (where WMIII was held) so it would be a bit pointless.|`|lJ3icYSKaa	NOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO|`|9x1w6Tg0aa	yeah thad be cool but only for like the main event and im not talking bout hhh vs rko

6tGYe5roaa	I don't think so really. I personally wouldn't wear another team's gear. But that's just me. I know a lot of people that do that. I knew this kid who was a Mets fan but he had baseball caps from various other MLB teams. If he liked the design, he would buy the hat and wear it from time to time. The only think that would be weird is if you started wearing a Yankee hat being a Red Sox fan. The kid never owned a Phillies or Yanks hat.|`|Tg2Gm6q6aa	That depends. Do you like the Mets even a little? The team you wear stuff for doesn't have to be your favorite, it just has to be a team that you like more than most. As long as you avoid stuff from your favorite team's rival (in your case, Yankees stuff), you aren't selling out. Remember, your friend is a Yankee fan who knows you are a Sox fan. He's probobly just trying to mess with you.<br>  <br>  A Red Sox fan rooting for the Mets is kind of under the "the enemy of my enemy is my friend" thing.|`|utTFiz3gaa	well, i like certain players so i have their jerseys but i wouldn't really personally wear any other team's gear :)|`|Rz9vY53Aaa	no but you may not be a die hard sox fan then..but then again..why the hell root for the sox..they blow ha|`|3XFHK7a8aa	No, it isn't considered being a sellout. As long as you avoid Yankee gear you're good, hombre! I think it's wicked stupid when people judge like that. My favorite player isn't on the Red Sox, nobody considers me a sellout. ( It's AJ Pierzynski)|`|38d6d7d6011bdd646925e15a23ec4590aa	Well good question it depends how you feel .. just my opinion if i go watch other teams and it not the Yankees i just go in regular close i don't wear the other teams stuff that is just me|`|4uSRVZNNaa	I think the term "sellout" is an overused term.  it's not like you are jumping ship or anything.  I say you are being smart.  being a sox fan in yankee country can get you killed or worse.  save your azz man, it's not worth it.<br>  being a baseball fan first, and a yankee fan second I do wear gear from other teams.  but that is because I like to go to different stadiums and get gear as souveniers.  one of my favorite jerseys is a throwback ernie banks cubs jersey I bought at wrigley.  that being said I wouldn't be caught dead in sox gear...<br>  others may call me a sellout or not a true yankee fan but I don't care.  it's just their opinion and they are entitled to it. <br>  <br>  ps-I live in jersey and you are not my king!!  XD|`|cGOBkGwwaa	well normally i'd say your alright...but since its the mets...yes theres somethin wrong with this picture. METS SUCK!<br>  GO PHILS :-)<br>  <br>  honestly tho no, not really.

Cantu has once again proven his relevance at the plate from when he was a top 2B, now he's a top CI with both 1B/3B eligibility.

7RCvVYqQaa	Hollow 800s at goal 800 meter race pace (This means run a 500 at whatever you're goal race pace is, 5 minutes rest, run a 300 at goal race pace.

You want to train your muscles to handle anaerobic workouts and handle oxygen debt when your doing the 800, 1500 and steeple.  My suggestion is making sure you have a balanced intervals in your program from long intervals to short sprints.  This develops your PR's for all your races since you run from the 400 to 1500.  <br>  <br>  1) 1 miles X 2 at 5K pace or 800 X 4 at 5K pace<br>  2) 400 meters X 6 at mile pace <br>  3) 200 meters X 12 at 400 meter pace      <br>  <br>  Try to do 2 of these intervals per week followed by an easy run.  For instance do 1) on Monday and 2 on Saturday especially if your meet is in the middle of the week.  Remember to warm up and cool down!  Good luck!

mwxKnUleaa	From my point of view you can't go wrong with these two greats. Both where dominant on defense and have some of the greatest rebounding performances combined. Wilt was a better scorer,but they played a different style of play in Boston. In the end I would give the edge to Bill Russell because he got eleven rings and that is an amazing accomplishment for any player to have.|`|yWcPOTsAaa	Wilt the Stilt|`|7100wGi3aa	Bill Russell: 5MVP's,11 rings<br>  Wilt Chamberlain: 4MVP's, 2 rings (and only one against Russell, during Russell's rookie year as playercoach)<br>  <br>  Russ is better than Wilt. <br>  <br>  First, in 1972, when Wilt submerged himself into a Russell-like role - low scoring, outlet rebounding and defensively focused game - in the Lakers, under the guidance of Bill Sharman, Russell's former Celtic teammate, his team went on a 33 game winning streak with a 69-12 season record, enroute to the championship. In retrospect, Russell's unflashy style of play is more effective in bringing in the hardware than Wilt's.<br>  <br>  Second, despite of Wilt's impressive talents, the man is a PAIN to work with. These explains why his former teams like the Warriors and 76ers was willing to trade him for LESSER talents, just to get rid of him. Russ has a much better attitude and despite of his aloof manner in public and private life, he exudes a sense of camarederie whenever he steps into the court or inside the locker room.<br>  <br>  Some of Wilt negative attributes which could be traced to his primadonna personality includes:<br>  <br>  - disrespecting and criticizing his coaches publicly (eg. Neil Johnston, Alex Hannum, Dolph Schayes, and of course Bill Van Breda Kolff all had bad memories working with Wilt.) <br>  <br>  - demanding a high salary (eg. One third of the Warriors gate receipts goes to Wilt's salary but Wilt doesnt even want to do publicity gigs to boost ticket sales)<br>  <br>  - complains like a baby to the media (eg. threatening to quit but not carrying it out)<br>  <br>  - rarely practice and travels with his teammates (eg. Wilt had had feuds with Baylor and Hal Greer).<br>  <br>  If i was a coach in real life, i would dread the idea of bringing Wilt Chamberlain on my team. Hell, Alex Hannum had to challenge Wilt in a fight just to get his respect. Ask yourself what kind of a basketball player would push his coach to such lengths just to earn the player's respect. Its not worth it having him on the team unless his talents are programmed in an android devoid of his personality.<br>  <br>  The problem with Wilt is that he did played with TALENTED teammates, he just DOESNT GEL well with his teams w/c is why their performance are not commensurate of their talents.|`|mIpOcWplaa	Bill Russel

AA10241450	Parachutes will give you an edge however your probably only use them a few times a year and really not as you say worth the value.  Better use if you jumping out of an airplane.  <br>  <br>  Try instead T.O.'s resistance bands and use them for instance I hook them up to a running vest and practice acceleration drills from the door.  You also love them for simulating catches since it develops your reach with strength and flexibility something that would be hard with regular weights. Also practice jumps, running and bounding drills will help your speed.  <br>  <br>  The best way really to become a good wide receiver is running track.  Also run short intervals on hills since it will develop your strength and increase your stamina for breaking tackles in the 4th quarter when the game is on the line.  Good luck!|`|JNTQwvtTaa	You can get a Resistance Running Parachute for $4o.oo dollars? <br>  <br>  No, you should'nt buy one. You should buy two.<br>  <br>  Those things are worth their weight in gold. You are a wideout and you are running track to prepare for fall football AND you want to buy a Training Chute?<br>  <br>  How did you get so smart? I am impressed. Most coaching staffs at some major universities aren't as intellegent as you are.|`|BB6HGbnPaa	Parachute and bands are basically the same but I think parachute is worth the money for what it does. It gives a lot of resistance than resistance band. It will increase your speed a lot other than working your muscle on your leg (resistance band). If you think about it, the parachute with its resistance is like having a 200 pound guy one you trying to pull you down. If your going out as a receiver, parachute is definitely for you.
plTYZU85aa	You sound like a point guard to me, and finally someone like me who likes to shoot midrange. Try 2 ball dribbling drills, and keep shooting midrange, the deadliest type of player is one that can take 2 dribbles and hit a jumper.|`|H7AcXAyaaa	Shoot 1000+ shots a day.|`|pIMXHktGaa	You could play a shooting guard ( the 2 or 3 ) i think you would be really good there. I would practice dribbling by doing drills like practing cross overs, dribbling with your weaker hand, ect. Also i guess work on defensive skills (moving your feet, not reaching in, stuff like that).|`|zULt6WAHaa	At 5'3 your main position would probably be point guard, but for that you would need to do lots of ball handling drills to get good ball control. The only other real possibility for your current height would be shooting guard and for that well obviously you need to be able to shoot. So you might need to work on your outside jump shot. <br>  If you want to work towards being a point guard some basic ball handling drills you could do are on these links:<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.coachesclipboard.net/VideoClips.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.coachesclipboard.net/VideoCli...</a><br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.basketball-drills-and-plays.com/ball-handling-drills.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.basketball-drills-and-plays.c...</a><br>  <br>  To work on your shooting the only real advice I can offer is to shoot a lot. Work on your form, keep your elbow under the ball and follow through.<br>  <br>  Good luck.|`|RMKvHJdnaa	dude ur just like me...but like 2 yrs ago...if ur still growin...u will find where ur range is...this is my thing...practice shootin from where u feel comfortable like u dont hav to force it n work on tht...u sound like a shooting guard|`|NI8pKCEpaa	depends on how old you are... and if ur still gunna grow. you should jump rope so u can jump higher and learn to dribble with ur off hand

Clearly, they're not as good as they claim. <br>  Interestingly, If you try to replicate their tests at home, you'll void the warranty. Doesn't inspire much confidence at all.<br>  <br>  AUS8A steel is mediocre steel at best, their Carbon V used to be a good steel, but since they constantly change its formula, these days it's not as good as it used to be.<br>  <br>  I've owned quite a few Cold Steel knives, including fixed and folder blades, eventually moved on to better brands.<br>  CS fixed blade reviews here - <a href="http://www.zknives.com/knives/fixed/prod/index.shtml" rel="nofollow">http://www.zknives.com/knives/fixed/prod...</a><br>  CS folder reviews here - <a href="http://www.zknives.com/knives/folding/indexbymk.shtml?Cold%20Steel" rel="nofollow">http://www.zknives.com/knives/folding/in...</a><br>  <br>  Both benchmade and Spyderco make better knives with better  steel.

Often its just very dubious and unrealistic statements  about competitors or their own knives performance.<br>  Not many companies in the knife industry do that. <br>  <br>  One more thing to consider for you is the serrations on Cold Steel knives. Unlike Benchmades or Spydercos, you can't sharpen them yourself.<br>  <br>  On top of that, those needle like teeth break under serious use. I've had a few serration teeth broken on my CS Voyager Tanto. I didn't do anything nearly as abuse compared to their show off videos, still, it broke. <br>  <br>  There are bunch of much better folders for you to consider out there, here's a few dozen reviews for you - <a href="http://www.zknives.com/knives/folding/index.shtml" rel="nofollow">http://www.zknives.com/knives/folding/in...</a>|`|ZsujbEjJaa	u can't go wrong with cold steel

IMu3wBu8aa	The scale will break. Shawn Michaels has been part of my life since I was 3 years old. He's been there for my whole life. Even when he was "away" he was still here. When he retires, that's it. He won't be back for a really long time. I'm sure he will stick around like SCSA...but the first part of his retirement will be at home with his family. He will be away for a good amount of time. I don't know if I can handle that. I'm not prepared at all. I knew the time was going to come, I just won't ever be ready for it. In the last 3 years it's really hitting me hard. The time will come sooner than later. I'm still not ready. I don't know how I'm going to handle this. I've seen many people's careers from their debut. I wasn't born in time to see Shawn's, but I have caught up with it. I watch 80's Wrestling and have seen just about everything of his. He's different than all of my favorites. It's Shawn Michaels. I remember watching him in my old apt...the Iron Man Match. My mother was like "so Shawn is your man, and Bret is your brothers?!" That's when I officially became one of his number 1 fans. :) My mom put a stamp on it lmao Even now when I ask her about Wrestling, she always says Shawn was always my favorite. When I met him the other day, she was glowing when I told her. She hasn't done that in a long time. She was actually happy for me about something...not just something...Wrestling (aka my life) :) <br>  <br>  WQ2: Yes. He did. He's been there consistently since his debut. Flair has been everywhere else. He's done so much for the business. He still is. He always will.<br>  <br>  WQ3: I honestly wouldn't be surprised if he did. I honestly hope he does. He deserves it.|`|rseD4OG2aa	A 10 man, no other number fits. Shawn Michaels was the reason I got into wrestling back in 1996. I love watching him. I know that he's lost a step now but he still has the potential to pull something amazing whenever he steps into the ring. I think that his match with The Undertaker at Wrestlemania is going to be one final classic from HBK.<br>  <br>  I know some people won't agree with this, but I think that Shawn Michaels has done for all of wrestling than Ric Flair. As for WWE, there isn't any question about it. When wrestling was falling on hard times before the Attitude Era back in the mid-90's, Shawn Michaels was the guy, and to a lesser extent Bret Hart and The Undertaker, that kept it all going. <br>  Shawn Michaels was the guy who really changed professional wrestling from being about Hulk Hogan like cartoon characters that couldn't wrestle at all to what we have today. <br>  <br>  I think so, yes. It's no secret that Vince McMahon is a huge HBK booster. He's been more loyal to WWE than anyone in company history except The Undertaker. <br>  To me, Shawn Michaels is the best wrestler of all time. He's such a classic and has just given us so many memorable moments. <br>  Is there anything quite like seeing HBK fly off the top rope and deliver a flying elbow...|`|Z5bH2LOZaa	I wont feel as bad as I did when Stone Cold retired. But it will still be a huge loss. The WWE will not be the same, HBK is charismatic and will never be replaced.<br>  <br>  WQ2: Yes HBK has done more. If it was not for him then the WWE would have crumbled in the 1990's.<br>  <br>  WQ3: He will get a bigger send off. Unlike Flair, HBK has stayed loyal to WWE all these years and as a fan I really appreciate that.|`|xKXu0Qb2aa	Ah , My Favorite Answer:<br>  <br>  Clown , A Scale Upon Which to Measure the Saddened Grief I Shall Feel When the Horrible Dark Day does Eventually Come , Has Yet to be Invented by the Geniuses of the World...<br>  <br>  <br>  WQ2 - Um , Yeah.<br>  Flair Never Really Did Anything Special in WWE.<br>  All His Spectacular Work was in the NWA & WCW.<br>  <br>  <br>  WQ3 - He Sure as Hell Should.<br>  Hopefully Vince Knows This & Will do the Right Thing.<br>  Maybe....Shawn WINS His Last Match (Ala Trish Stratus).<br>  Maybe Even with....A Sharpshooter?|`|0BhcnLVbaa	HBK single handedly broke up one of the best tag teams in the late 80's, the Rockers by underhandedly taking out Marty Jannetty with a Superkick.<br>  <br>  HBK was involved in the most controversial match in WWE history and it changed Bret Hart's life from then onwards.<br>  <br>  He broke kayfabe by hugging with the Clique.<br>  <br>  Never have I seen a superstar so arrogant and self-centred as HBK.<br>  <br>  Despite this, my answer is 10. It was HBK that put my *** in the seat for every single RAW is WAR episode.  He was arrogant, but he was the guy that he loved to hate. He was the veteran that worked for two decades in the WWE and gave it his all. He was the guy that helmed DX, the most popular stable in the Attitude Era Days. He could put up an excellent match with almost anyone, from Cena to Undertaker to Jericho to Triple H to Bret Hart to Razor Ramon, and the list just goes on and on. HBK is the most dedicated wrestler to WWE I have ever seen. Whether is it playing a cocky heel, a serious face or a comedian, HBK can perform his role very well. <br>  <br>  WQ2: HBK has contributed much more to the WWE than Ric Flair did, putting up several classics and being the whole package.<br>  <br>  WQ3: It will be a much greater send off for a veteran like HBK, a veteran who has worked tirelessly for WWE and never looking back. HBK would be sorely missed as he changed wrestling in a greater way than Flair did.|`|ULSUqmeZaa	10 being the saddest, I'd be about 9. HBK is my second favorite superstar. <br>  <br>  Yes, he has done more for the WWE than Flair. WWE can't take credit for all of the things Flair has done. He was popular before he went to WWE. HBK grew up in the WWE, he's been there from the beginning of his career pretty much.<br>  <br>  I think it'll be about as big as Flairs sendoff.|`|Q143OQNbaa	1. 10! he's my favourite superstar<br>  <br>  2. I agree, Shawn Michaels is an entertainer: hes the showstoper, the main event, the headliner, the icon, mr.wrestlemania, the HEART BREAK KID......SHAWN MICHAELS!!!!!!<br>  <br>  3. I think he should and he will|`|qpb8l4Mkaa	10.<br>  <br>  You can never create the pure excitement of HBK entering the ring and participating.|`|GQWGLSexaa	WQ 1- 9 because he work hard for WWE and had made some great matches <br>  <br>  WQ 2 - Yep<br>  <br>  WQ 3 - Yea,|`|4tvI9WYjaa	9/10 i is going to be big lost to the wwe    im hoping he have one last run as world champion that be great cause hbk  one off my favorites off all time  but really could you picture wwe with  out the show stopper ?<br>   and yeah hbk has done more then ric flair cause shawn michael's is one off the most conterversal superstars in the wwe history he had the most memorable match in wwe and wwf history  and i have a feeling best is yet to come<br>   <br>  i really don't know cause ric flair had a pretty big retirement sent off it be hard to beat that  but  i think if any one should out do flair it be hbk  plus he was one off the most respected superstars off all time.|`|ZbNXVQu7aa	On a scale from 1 to 10, HBK's retirement will be a 5.5 on my sadness meter.  I have a great deal of respect for many things he's done, but I may never be able to fully forgive or forget the Montreal Screwjob.  Add his (kayfabe) betrayal of Marty Jannetty on The Barber Shop all those years ago, and, for better or worse, I'm torn right down the middle.<br>  <br>  WQ2: Based solely on their WWF/E careers, I 100% agree that HBK has done more than Ric Flair has.  As for why, I can answer that in a single word: ladder.<br>  <br>  WQ3: It's difficult to imagine anyone getting a bigger send off than Ric Flair received last year, but if anyone does, it'll be either HBK [or Undertaker (even though this question isn't about him, I couldn't stop myself from adding this)].

aYVPZjLVaa	Clint Eastwood is directing a movie based upon a book. The book is Playing the Enemy by John Carlin and really doesn't have that much to do with rugby. The story does culminate at the RWC but the story is more about Nelson Mandela's struggle to unite a nation (which he didn't quite accomplish but he did do quite a lot). The book's quite good and fairly easy to read so I'd definitely recommend reading it.<br>  <br>  As for characters, the rugby players will only feature in a small part of the movie (if it follows the book at all) and the All Blacks in an even smaller part (since they, of course, show the Boks a lot more).|`|HWmjIOaBaa	There will be no suzy!

UYPfC5YVaa	I think both of them respect the big man. they both only get the publicity this time because their team is both on top of the standings. It's a good business for the NBA to publicize players that has numerous fan base because it brings money to them as well as the products that the two players promote.

There's nothing exciting about his game, he doesn't have near the number of post moves as an al jefferson or someone like that has. but the ones he does have..  very effective. .|`|LlQq72xOaa	he's a great player just doesnt have nuts like kobe|`|AA10248312	First off, Kobe has three titles.<br>  <br>  It's time you learned what Sportscenter is all about. Sportscenter is run by people who can't dunk.  Therefore, they are all overly-impressed by people who CAN dunk.  To Sportscenter anchors, the only reason none of them are in the NBA is because they can't dunk.  Sportscenter anchors think that basketball is all about dunking.<br>  <br>  Tim Duncan has a great all around game.  He likes to bank it in from 8-12 feet out.  That's not the kind of stuff that impresses Sportscenter anchors. Therefore, it's not gonna be shown on Sportscenter.<br>  <br>  Some Sportscenter anchors can hit an 8 foot shot.  Therefore, thery're not as impressed by Tim Duncan as they are by Lebron and Kobe. Lebron and Kobe, after all, can dunk!!!<br>  <br>  Even if a guy's on a breakaway with no one around him, if he dunks, it's be a "top 10" play...guaranteed.<br>  <br>  Kobe and Lebron have immense respect for Duncan and his game.

You are either going to be a sprinter and run the 100m 200m 4-1 relay and other things like that or your going to be along distance runner and run the 800m 1600m 3200m. What you have to do is decide what type of runner you want to be before you think of program to start following. So you have decide if you want to be a sprinter or a long distance runner. Because those two types of runners are completely different and you can't be both at the same time you have to be one or another.|`|e5e7b6abc96b5c6e410bc10bc14ce363aa	What you should do is run the 20-30 (add 5 more miles every 2 weeks) miles a week and then get in at least 1 tempo for 15 minutes at race pace. then you should do what we call broken 8's where your run a 800, jog 100, then do another 800, jog 100, walk a lap.<br>  then run a 600, jog 100, run a 500, then jog 100.<br>  walk one lap.<br>  run 400, jog 100, run 300.<br>  walk one lap.<br>  run a 100, jog 50, do another 150 jog 50 and then finish with another 100.<br>  (*these should be done with ur 800 times*)<br>  u should also run 4x400's<br>  8x200's<br>  12x100<br>  1x1600.<br>  this will help u get out fast and help u stay the same speed due to ur speed training<br>  <br>  trust me i got my 2 mile time down from 11:56 to 9:56 in a year

He draws me to NASCAR. Without him, NASCAR is going to lose me.

To some crunches and sit ups to develop those muscles and they wont hurt.
S2tBYhCKaa	Sleeping bags retail for far less than cost that labor and materials<br>  will consume reader.  Coleman makes a 40 degree sleeping bag<br>  for twenty dollars.  If reader intends to beat yourself up be advised<br>  mixed layers of fleece, polyester, and water resistant nylon shell<br>  is sufficient for warm weather.  Use upholstery thread, YKK brass<br>  zipper, and make a cord sealing nylon stuff sack.|`|KkZE2NDYaa	It would really be much easier and cheaper to buy the type of sleeping bag you are describing with all the features you mention. They make double wide bags of every weight. But if you really insist and money is no object, then the design will take some serious thought. Goretex is just a lining that is waterproof but breathes. It needs some other cloth to bind it to. It's not an insulator. Some of the best insulating materials that would be easy to work with and are relatively thin are Thinsulate, Polar-tec and a few others. Really you are talking about an inner liner, an insulating layer, and an outer water resistant layer to do this right. I think I'll stick with my first suggestion, buy one. Look through outdoor supply company catalogs for ideas.|`|3Twg9Uuuaa	I have always thought that polar tec 300 would make a really good lining for a sleeping bag. Weight becomes a problem though.<br>  let me know what you try out.|`|h2KkiKK3aa	two wool blankets sewn together and then cover with nylon cloth, be thinner then most others and very waterproof and breathable, lighter then most too.|`|lTeXIjpOaa	if you are doing so just to have a wider sleeping bag, they do make wide bags, check at a local sporting goods store, also, you could always buy two bags and zip them together
1etquz5Naa	Definitely DO NOT wear the Pumas for training and running long distances on the pavement. Training and racing shoes are completely different. The Pumas with the small studs and the light weight are good for racing, but will mess up your arches when you train for many miles for endurance. Definitely invest in a pair of training shoes that provide good arch support. If you have a normal arch, go for a neutral shoe and if you are an overpronator or have flat or low arches, go for a stability or motion control based on the severity.|`|GgkCiNvBaa	For starters, are you sure your Puma's aren't Spikes? Spikes have legit "spikes" going out, and they are EXTREMELY lightweight. Please look at below website: If this is what you have DO NOT EVEN CONSIDER RUNNING WITH THESE ON PAVEMENT. Running on pavement with these not only ruin the shoes, but are completely terrible for your feet! Spikes are used on squishy tracks (made out of normal, rubber-ish material) or used on Cross Country courses, which are normally in grass and/or forests. Spikes are used for traction.<br>  <br>  As for long distance shoes, I would recommend using Brookes, Mizunos, Asics, or New Balance. I have had a pair of New Balances, and they aren't bad for your money. I got 700 or so miles out of them, but I was told by many that they were surprised I wasn't injured by them. I swear by Brookes, I have had two pairs and I'm still in love <3. But honestly, it's all on what you feel about them. Try them all on. Run around the store a little. Then purchase the best ones.<br>  <br>  BUT TO ANSWER THE ORIGINAL QUESTION. If the below shoes are your own, DON'T USE THEM ON PAVEMENT.  DEFINITELY not good for you! And check out some of those shoes mentioned before.<br>  <br>  Enjoy your runs! And I sincerely thank you for serving our Country :]|`|1IZov1Byaa	Go for Nike Air Pegeaus 25 they are super comfortbale and well cushioned. i'm an xc runner myself and it lasted me many races!|`|777d96dc0fd85404642787620d16b927aa	try asics or adidas; no nikes! they fall apart on you...well they sucked when i used them for xc.|`|RWEyZZXWaa	Go to www.runnersworld.com and you'll find the amazing and accurate answer.<br>  You are going to need sturdier shoes then those Pumas.  I will always say go for Asics.|`|BB6HGbnPaa	You could run on pavement on cross country shoes but it will be uncomfortable. Try buying trainers which is for practice and they would be good for running anywhere.
Q1MI6L96aa	I've run the Boston Marathon, competed in "tin man" triathlons, cycled one-day events and played tennis & hockey...and driven WOO hot-rods...drivers at the world-class level like NASCAR are athletes.|`|BovpXrk1aa	YEP<br>  THEY CAN DO BACK FLIPS OFF THE ROOF OF THEIR CARS<br>  MOST NFL PLAYERS COULD NOT DO THAT!|`|m3KM6Xnvaa	An athlete is defined as a person trained or gifted in exercises or contests involving physical agility, stamina, strength; a participant in a sport, exercise, or game requiring physical skill.<br>  <br>  By that definition, NASCAR drivers are athletes because it takes a tremendous amount of strength to drive one of the cars. It's not like driving to the store. Drivers endure up to 3-4 Gs in the corners, and to control a car when G-force is pulling on you takes strength and stamina.|`|Q2sZhNmJaa	Yes they are and Nascar is a sport.  Only people who are properly trained and conditioned can drive a car at 160+ miles per hour  for 4 hours in a hot environment.  It takes a lot of work and concentration and skill.|`|mIdcJEJNaa	Name all the other athletes that can sustain a ten pound weight lose, in under three hours, and still walk after they're done competing...<br>  I'll be looking for the answer..<br>  Next time you feel "a little bloated", try it.. And let me know if you can even stand..|`|tUrrwplgaa	Yes they are. They always have to be in control, and handel a car at 165+ under 4-5 Gs and sometimes taking hits 6x the force of gravity.<br>  <br>  Can you do that?|`|IRbkrJUWaa	Why not? This stupid question again?<br>  <br>  It requires someone of energy, good health and a fit body to be able to drive cars for 500 miles at 200 mph.. No fat man or a lazy kid can do that...<br>  <br>  It takes a good mind set, it takes patience, it takes good thinking, strategy.. all of it requirements for a sport, is it not my friend? You cannot deny that.. I know you must be a fan of a different sport.. certainly.. if not, then this question is based on no prior knowledge...well, then you are excused... if you are a fan of a different sport, then I have just made you a little bit more knowledgeable... and less ignorant..|`|9vcZjFl6aa	this one again   ok yes they are they hold their pee or nothing  to eat or drink maybe 1 hr b 4 a race there are no door handles they swerve back and forth to put heat in their tires and clean them either become a nascar fan or wait 6 mo till nfl is back|`|58h70voyaa	Yes,  they are very physically fit takes alot to do what they do not just anyone can do what they do!! Nascar drivers are as far as I'm concerned some of the best athletes to look up too!!!!!!!!!|`|zdh6aq8oaa	Definitely, as they should be.|`|yt4PN1R4aa	yes and if you disagree with me I suggest you turn a lap in a racecar.|`|JfGVUh9aaa	Yes. Do you consider Golfers athlete's?|`|yZ6quPZlaa	Yeah they are.In Australia V8's are a type of sport.
Q1MI6L96aa	Richard Petty - and we would be driving hot-roads at Daytona|`|AA10688277	Danica Patrick...If she would let me do the driving.<br>  <br>  We may never get to the finish line, but, it would be lotsa fun in the pit stops and I wouldn't mind it one bit if the guys took their time changing those tires!|`|9ULvTxPLaa	Definatly Cristiano Ronaldo the best soccer player in the world and hes so hot and we both share the same birthday,so that would be the best present ever!!|`|DGDhQBwpaa	shawn johnson!
UTau2Bx2aa	Racism is so prevalent in soccer.  We went to Montenegro for the soccer reality show One Shot One Dream and our players had to deal with it all over again.  It was like stepping back in time.  One guy said, "I've never seen a black guy in person before."  The "N" word was used too.  We wrote to FIFA but they never did anything about it.  These were Champions league teams in country that is part of the European Union.

XaFYUMRSaa	I agree the media is just out to get the dirt on players now.ESPN is like star mag for sports.That's why I never watch espn news!|`|c4b596d15eac948f611f72b6a99f85a0aa	You're bang on with your screen name.<br>  <br>  And I believe it's part of the CBA that players have to pay lip service to the media, especially QB's.<br>  <br>  And you'd be 3rd string on the practice squad if you didn't want to talk to the media, so don't worry bout' that Super Bowl.|`|xeX7vHJSaa	While it may be viewed as self-centered to speak with the media and have interviews it can also be a good thing. Skilled,yet humble players are all the rage nowadays and its important to set an image for yourself that fans can see and understand. Many great stars in the  NFL have a background that fans want to know about so that they can go and say ''if so and so can do it, why not me too''. Showboats like T.O. and Chad Johnson give interviews and talking to press a bad reputation.|`|51e7baee76cfe5758f817c35c038f4c7aa	No interviews means no marketability because no one knows who you are.  You'll never get endorsements so you better invest your money wisely.  Fans won't know who you are so they won't care about you.  You'll just be another nobody on the team.  You may even be tagged a wierdo like Steve Carlton (Phillies pitcher 1970's) was because he was the way you describe.|`|gvfFLFS0aa	You feel that way, most athletes don't.  Most should though.  Blame it on ego.  I would say that I would do the same thing, but fame and talent tend to increase ego, so unless you actually are famous, it's hard to say how you would handle it.  <br>  <br>  There are some people who seem to focus solely on their profession, though.  Roger Federer and Mariano Rivera come to mind.|`|c03a1e29209b69a15065f8edab5c54daaa	Please, you'd see those dollar signs with the 7 zeros lined up behind them and you be pushing old women and children out of the way to step up to the podium at a presser.
SJEXY7Ufaa	cause the NFL is a big business and whether you like it or not, if you want to play then you have to talk to the media....it's just good business...promote the money machine silly|`|c03a1e29209b69a15065f8edab5c54daaa	A lot of players - especially high profile players like QBs - have clauses in their contracts that say they have to spend "X" amount of time with the media answering questions.  Now if you had a particularly bad game and didn't want to talk right away, I bet they'd let you slide but at some point you'd have to stand at the podium or sit in front of your locker and take some questions from reporters.<br>  <br>  If you wouldn't sign a contract with a media clause in it, then I can just about guarantee you that you wouldn't be playing for any NFL team.|`|bc830b1601cd7380ec1f17c83fef3a4eaa	It depends. If the franchise tells the media that you are going to be present at the post game news conference, then you have to be there. If you don't show, then you will be fined. Some players have their contracts written with clauses that they have to make themselves accessible to the media. If they don't show, they get fined by the team. If you have a franchise QB making $15-20 million a year, you would want him to talk to the media to give your franchise a face. Otherwise the media will trash you and the team. I agree that the media access is too important in the NFL and in professional sports, but they are an evil that anyone with aspirations to play professional sports must deal with.|`|BqVcz1R1aa	Like if you just want to punch in and out??? That would be selfish of you, cause people admire you and they would be willing to pay a lot of money just to watch you throw a ball. Yeah, football is exhausting, but do it for the fans. After all, you would be the reason why you would be making millions of dollars. If no-one cared, you would be screwed. No fines, but its a shameful thing to do, especially to kids and all.|`|8KmGcTW8aa	Umm .... that would be kinda of a bad winner and loser. Its not that hard to answer a couple of questions asked by the media, you won't have a lot of fans if you do that.|`|hpYwgDyeaa	I'm not 100% but I think it's in their contract. Football's a business and a QB is a commodity. He has to entertain win, lose, or draw.

7zXZpv8iaa	Okay, im a highschool swimmer, I hope I can help you here. Im not much of a distance guy, im a sprinter really, but I know some pretty fast guys. <br>  <br>  To Improve & lengthen Stroke:<br>  **Catch up freestlye  (before you can stroke again you need to touch the hand that you just stroked with)<br>  -This greatly improves form, and allows you to lengthen stroke, which, after repetition, if you can get your arms churning as fast as before, will make you much faster.<br>  <br>  **if you want to practice with more drag, wear shoes, maybe even a full set of clothes, I know a few teams who have done that.<br>  <br>  **consistency is key, swim A LOT. I was swimming 3 hours a day 5 days a week during season DO IT.<br>  <br>  Try to keep your legs parallel when kicking to avoid kicking yourself, the less you kick yourself the more kicking momentum you maintain.<br>  <br>  Breathing is also key, make sure that your breathing is as unobtrusive as you can make it, quick breaths to the side that dont create much drag, and dont move your body around too much while you breathe<br>  <br>  Less breaths in general will increase speed, flipturns (especially with good form and technique) will make you much faster <br>  <br>  (if you dont do these already you should, basically keep momentum, swim into the wall, and then before hitting it, do a frontflip landing on the flats of your feet, and kick off hard in unison with both legs, maintain streamline for a bit, breach and continue swimming)<br>  <br>  Otherwise, just try to minimize body movement when swimming except for the parts that basically need to move, and if you really wanna improve and youve tried all this, train hard, and get like racing goggles or a fast-skin|`|AvFfBF1Zaa	You just really need to practice the 500 and 200 in practice.

Hope that helps x|`|btX6mM3Taa	When you are swimming the actual event, do not slow your tempo down. Keep your arms rotating with a fast turnover and keep on kicking. It should not be as fast as a sprint, but it should be pretty fast.

y8b86tTEaa	As far as I can tell you're looking for a fixed blade knife, not for a folder, correct?<br>  <br>  Requirements for hunting and camping knives also vary. Hunting knives are optimized more for light/medium cutting. Camping knives can be  used for rougher jobs including chopping and prying. <br>  Given your budget, you could get a very good medium size knife 5-7" long. <br>  <br>  As for the brands, as others mentioned Benchmade and Spyderco are very good choices. Becker also makes good field knives. <br>  All three use modern steels and quality materials.<br>  Benchmade and a few other fixed blade reviews here - <a href="http://www.zknives.com/knives/fixed/prod/index.shtml" rel="nofollow">http://www.zknives.com/knives/fixed/prod...</a><br>  Alternatively you could consider Fallkniven - <a href="http://www.zknives.com/knives/fixed/prod/falknvna1.shtml" rel="nofollow">http://www.zknives.com/knives/fixed/prod...</a><br>  <br>  If you really want high performance knives you should check out Swamp Rat Knives - <a href="http://www.zknives.com/knives/fixed/srkw/index.shtml" rel="nofollow">http://www.zknives.com/knives/fixed/srkw...</a><br>  Made from SR-101 steel, which is modified 52100 steel, they have exceptionally good edge holding and toughness.<br>  <br>  Even better, but more expensive Busse Combat Knives - <a href="http://www.zknives.com/knives/fixed/busse/index.shtml" rel="nofollow">http://www.zknives.com/knives/fixed/buss...</a><br>  <br>  Cold Steel, Gerber, CRKT are ok, but lower class compared to benchmade and Sypdies. SOG belongs to this group as well. They stick to AUS8 or AUS6 steel, donno why but they discontinued their field knives made of Latrobe BG-42 steel. I got two of those, they held much better edge than AUS8.<br>  <br>  Chris Reeve Knives are quite expensive, made of A2 tool steel, which is one of the toughest steels, but there is an endless debate about them heat treating A2 steel below its optimal hardness, thus compromising toughness and edge holding ability.<br>  <br>  And, finally if I were you,and looking for the high performance, non-custom blade I'd look for modern knives. As time goes on steels used by manufacturers improve (mostly) and metallurgy moves forward too. So, it's very unlikely that 30-40 year old knife will be anywhere near today's knives. Bakc then 50-54HRC was considered high. Today 58-60 is more or less a norm and better blades go higher. Hardness alone isn't an indicator of knife quality, but better steels can be hardened higher.<br>  You might want to check knife steel FAQ too.

C8DOT8Y7aa	Get a running buddy. It is highly recommended this be carried out with someone who runs about the same speed as yourself if possible. Training alone is not discouraged but training with a team of similar runners is a huge motivation booster. <br>  Set your mind to it. Whether your goal is 5 minutes, 6 minutes, 7 minutes or even more, it can't be overstressed that one needs a lot of motivation to break a personal record. The mind has a habit of emulating your thoughts. If you believe something won't happen, your actions will make it so that it doesn't happen. <br>  Stretch before and after practice and meets. Always do a 5-10 minute warm up and cool down. These will help keep you from injury. <br>  Learn how to run properly. Posture is crucial and sometimes is what prevents many people from running faster. <br>  Start with distance running and stick with this for about 4 weeks so your body gets used to long runs. Keep the pace consistent. Right now you're focusing on increasing your mileage. For the first week, do thirty minute runs each day (20 if you're out of shape). The second week, increase this to 40 minutes, then to 50 minutes the next, then 50 - 60 minutes the fourth. But remember that there are many different techniques you can use, so read up on how to run longer. <br>  Take Sundays off except for some stretching or cross training. <br>  Incorporate speed work in the fifth week. These are known as tempo runs and should be done once or twice a week. They should be at least two days apart from each other to allow for recovery. Tempo has three parts: Practice pace, race pace, and practice. Say you're doing a 30 minute run. You would run 10 minutes normal pace, run race pace for 10 minutes, then slow it back down for the remaining 10 minutes. For simplification, race pace is any pace above your normal pace. <br>  Do tempo runs for about 2-3 weeks while continuing with your distance runs on the other days. Distance runs should now be about 40-45 minutes. By the 7th or 8th week, you should be comfortable with running. <br>  Stop your tempo runs at around the 8th or 9th week. The aim here is to do intervals of 2000m, 1000m, 400m, 300m. The exact number isn't necessary. The longer the distance, the fewer the repetitions. So on one day after a 20-30 minute run, proceed to do 4 repetitions 2000m with rest in between around 3 minutes. By your last repetition, you should feel like quitting, that's how tired you should be. Always a have a recovery distance run in between the days of your sprints/speed workout. Recovery runs are very light and relaxed runs that last about 30mins or less. On another day you could do a 6 x 1000m or 10 x 400 or 12 x 300. The repetitions are chosen arbitrarily. You can even mix then up on the same day such that you do a pyramid. 2000m, rest, 1000m, rest, 400m, rest 300m, rest 400m, rest, 1000m, rest, 2000m. Speed workouts should last 2 weeks. <br>  Run your mile. Here's some lap-by-lap strategy: <br>  Pre-race: Warm up. Do a few paced sprints to get your heart rate up. Mentally go through the race in your head. Know what times you want to have at each lap. <br>  Lap 1: You'll want to start out a little faster than what is necessary to get your target time. The fact of the matter is that psychologically, you're going to slow down as you get further into the mile, so make sure this one is good to compensate. Keep in mind, though, you don't want to spend it all on this lap. A good example would be, if you want to run a 5:00 mile, each lap would need to be 75 seconds. A good time for your first lap would be 71-73; not too fast, but fast enough to give you some slack. <br>  Lap 2: Fall into pace. This is where those 400 meter intervals you worked on will come in handy; know what it feels like to run the pace you need to run. This is the lap which should be right on target. In the 5:00 minute mile we mentioned earlier, THIS is the lap which should be exactly 75 seconds, so your time at the halfway point should be 2:26-2:28. Your adrenaline rush will probably start to wear off midway through this one, and you'll start feeling it, but focus on your running form and keeping the pace. <br>  Lap 3: Mentally and physically, this is the toughest lap for most people. More often than not, this is the one which will determine if you get your target time or not. Chances are, you will slow down from your original pace. In our 5:00 mile example, most people will run from about 77-78 seconds. However, since the first lap was hopefully strong, this puts us almost perfectly at 3:45, which is exactly on target. Nonetheless, it is important to make a conscious effort to keep pace on this lap, or else you will fall behind. Remember, your next lap is the last one! <br>  Lap 4: This is it. You're almost there. That's what you need to be telling yourself at this point. You probably slowed down on your previous lap, so you need to really strut your stuff on this one and mentally push it to get to that time. Especially important is the last 200 meters- on most tracks|`|AA10241450	You want negative splits or for the 3200 meters - your second 1600 should be faster than your first 1600.  You need to develop pace training.  My best tips for you would be to do longer intervals:<br>  <br>  A) 2 miles X 3 at 10K pace with 30-45 second recoveries <br>  B) 1 mile X 4 at 3200M pace with 30-45 second recoveries <br>  C) 400 meters X 8 at mile pace with heart rate down to 120 heart beats per minute <br>  <br>  Do 2 of these workouts per week - I like working out on XC courses however around the track is fine too or around the grass since you need your splits to be exact.  Remember your runs are about pace.  Also add resistance exercises to your scehdule!  Good luck!|`|2mX8K8bdaa	It sounds like all you need to do is stay patient.  With the work you've been doing, and your ability, it sounds like you will be able to go 10:30.  Just keep going out in 5:10-5:15 and holding on that last mile.  As long as you don't give up, you will run way under 11 minutes.  When it gets to the big meets, you'll have people to run with.  I promise you will get to 10:30 if you just stay the course, and keep working hard!|`|e5e7b6abc96b5c6e410bc10bc14ce363aa	What you should do is run the 30-40 a week and then get in at least 1 tempo for 15 minutes at race pace. then you should do what we call broken 8's where your run a 800, jog 100, then do another 800, jog 100, walk a lap.<br>  then run a 600, jog 100, run a 500, then jog 100.<br>  walk one lap.<br>  run 400, jog 100, run 300.<br>  walk one lap.<br>  run a 100, jog 50, do another 150  jog 50 and then finish with another 100.<br>  (*these should be done with ur 800 times*)<br>  u should also run 4x400's<br>  8x200's<br>  12x100<br>  1x1600.<br>  this will help u get out fast and help u stay the same speed due to ur speed training( it will get u used to running fast for a long period of time)<br>  <br>  trust me i got my 2 mile time down from 11:56 to 9:56 in a year|`|PJzd8iJaaa	well u could try slowing down first mile alittle and keep it steady... from 5:16 to 6:00 says u went out to fast.
OOeoFvB6aa	Backflip.  The first guy is completely wrong with his physics. Your feet might be going forward, but for your body to move forward over your feet, which is what a flip is, you have to manage a very serious shift in weight and actually overcome the forward momentum of your feet.<br>  <br>  With a backflip you actually give in and let your feet sail ahead of you, and you can see the landing the entire time.<br>  <br>  To learn either of these moves, practice someplace safe before you do it over snow.|`|c08708aebaf627e023dde432dde5dc5aaa	Front flip....its the direction you are going....|`|UZ8IcCwtaa	backflip you have to completely shift your weight forward for frontflip which doesnt give you as much momentum as a backflip in which you would just add onto the momentum you got from the 45 degree angle from the jump. I agree completely with the guys above me, except for the first guy.|`|Xd2MYQEsaa	Backflip by far. As the guy above me said, shorter rotation and you spot your landing halfway through the jump. On a front flip it's basically a blind landing until the last 15 degrees of the rotation. Plus, your inherit momentum will carry you through the backflip, you have to make a conscious effort to pull yourself through a front flip.|`|9Kt7p7Vfaa	Back flips are easier. Most jumps are at least 45° so to do a back flip, you only need to rotate an additional 315° or less. With a front flip, you need to make up the angle of the jump plus the 360°. Also when doing a back flip, you can see the landing much earlier than when doing a front flip.|`|yMpg9CrKaa	backflips, You can spot your landing the whole time, and the momentum is already going for you. You lose speed when you pop off of your toes, and you need to pop harder for frontflips.

qMnuRO50aa	In cross country they taught us that 'the best runners know that the mind tires before the body'. Even if you THINK you're tired, the truth is you can still push yourself a LOT further. Just do something to get your mind off how long you've been running, and how far you still have to run.<br>  <br>  Try to ignore everything except the stretch of road right in front of you. Focus on that. If you focus on something far away, it will make you feel more inadequate because it will seem like such a long way.<br>  <br>  Also, if possible, listen to some music that inspires you and/or gives you an adrenaline rush while you run. It will help take your mind off the running AND help motivate you to keep going.|`|RWEyZZXWaa	RELAX!  You have got to relax and concentrate on being smooth and rhythmic.  A tm has a little tendency to pull you along.  When your running on the roads your doing all the work.  Start slowly and just concentrate on running for 25 mins.  Go to runners world.com and use the route planner and plot out a run that is the distance of your PT test and concentrate on running that distance regardless of your time.  It doesn't have to be fast in the beginning, be consistent and the speed will quickly come.  If you are becoming winded slow down but do not stop, drop to a slow jog.  Even if you feel like (and perhaps there will be) jogging grannys could outrun you just keep chugging along and you'll be o.k.<br>  Good luck!|`|e4ebc08557e7843458d66e6d4375e253aa	STAY OFF THE TREAD MILL!  Sorry I didn't mean to yell. Run outside or on a track. Just allow yourself to get used to it. Good luck.|`|1etquz5Naa	As the others are saying, being on a treadmill is not the same as running outside because you are doing more work in propelling yourself forward. However, also take into consideration the air quality of an indoor gym and the outside. The air in the gym is usually more humid so it provides more moisture, but the air outside is usually drier. This results in your lungs having to work harder and your muscles having to move your body forward on its own. Take your time and pace yourself. Consider the distance your running and set a good rhythm that is comfortable, but still challenging.|`|777d96dc0fd85404642787620d16b927aa	Choose a nice area and remember to take deep breaths..start off slow<br>  ! a lot of ppl people get tired faster because they use most of their energy on the start...so build up a pace and just keep it goin! :]   try not to stop; just go slower if you feel a little tired, stopping only makes your heart and head pound, well I personally think so, good luck :)|`|BB6HGbnPaa	Running on a treadmill is different from running outside. Treadmill is basically you running in place for 20-25 minutes but you arent pushing yourself forward like you would outside. Just keep running outside and get us to it.

giWvSwqRaa	I would get the drive plus, the extra length will come in handy when you need it.|`|Kzhu4bkMaa	It really depends on you, and what you are comfortable with.  If you have a 27.5 inch racket now, get the Plus, just to keep it the same.  If not, get the Standard.  If your serves are more important to you than your backhand, and are a bigger weapon, get the Plus.  If the backhand is more powerful, get the standard, because you don't need the extra length with a one-handed backhand.

Hopefully we'll get Crabtee|`|bc830b1601cd7380ec1f17c83fef3a4eaa	I like the strong silent types.<br>  <br>  Reggie Wayne can get after the ball. He is quiet and doesn't enjoy the spotlight as much. Fitzgerald is great, but the media spends too much time tooting his horn. Maybe if they would lay off the hype, I would be more open to him. Boldin was good, but his off field problems with his contract and the way he and his agent handled it was ridiculous. Hines Ward used to be a great receiver, but he has become too cocky lately. The guy on the other side of him is pretty good, but with his recent run in with the law, I don't think he is a good person.<br>  <br>  So I will stick with Wayne for now, until he starts to dwindle in terms of production or causes major locker room problems.|`|gvfFLFS0aa	After the year Larry Fitzgerald had (playoffs included), I think it's hard to argue against him at this point.

TCehI17kaa	I will wait till this season is over before i really pass judgment but only thing i will say is that he wasn't the same player after Manny left last season.|`|1yuUIN9Aaa	Well, we'll just have to find out won't we?|`|c68b31739ffbee17f6dfc635bbe9ffddaa	Good point! We shall soon find out. Baseball is an individual sport.<br>  He did average approximately: 39 HR, 120 RBI, .295 BA. over his 6 years with the Red Sox. If you recall he had a number of clutch hits(HRs, against the Yanks and others). You can't take the past away from him. He has been a very good hitter.|`|PkCqIfMFaa	That is a great question. David Ortiz has been a large build his whole career. He raked at the minor league level before being promoted in the Twins organization. I remember seeing him at a young age, and feeling like he would be able to crush a ball if he ever got a hold of one. His whole career before becoming a Red Sock, was injured ridden seasons. He never had a full season until he entered his tenure with the Red Sox. His last season with the Twins you could see his power numbers increasing, but I do think Manny helped him in becoming a primetime hitter. Hitting has a lot to do with patience and understanding the strikezone and reading pitches. Something Manny is the best in the game at, especially in the clutch. So learning from Manny, and also being protected by him in his first full season with the Red Sox allowed him to be able to understand his true potential. David Ortiz, yes I agree if healthy, can hit 35+ homeruns, and 120+ RBIs. Specifically in a stacked Red Sox lineup. If you calculate his statistics from last year, he would definitely have over 35 homeruns and 110 RBIs if healthy throughout the year. Hope I helped because I have wondered the same thing for years.|`|Rz9vY53Aaa	his own talent but red sox suck without rameriz behind papi|`|eac78f41a64d286478c23785cf30be23aa	I think having Manny next to him helped greatly, but when you really break down Ortiz's hitting game it's actually very basic...and it says a lot about modern umpiring and pitching philosophy.<br>  <br>  Ortiz looks like he's sitting in a lounge chair at the plate.  He crowds the plate, digs in so deep that a wrecking ball couldn't push him aside, and waits for his pitch. He looks so comfortable up there you'd think he should be wearing a straw hat and sunscreen.<br>  <br>  And that's the point....he can act so comfortable up there because very few pitchers today even attempt to do what EVERY pitcher would have done thirty years ago -- Knock him off the plate.<br>  <br>  I don't know if it's the metal bats in high school and college or the umpires who have emasculated pitchers, but most just don't seem able or willing to take control of the inner half of the plate.  I'm not saying to hit him in the head...but the simple fact is that "fear" used to be a big part of a pitcher's arsenal<br>  <br>  If they were still around, guys like Don Drysdale and Bob Gibson would have made sure that first pitch forced the batter to do a little dance if he took so much time digging in as Papi does.  <br>  <br>  To his credit, Ortiz has developed great plate discipline as he has gotten older.  But part of his ability to "wait for his pitch" is due to the fact that certain hitters today are allowed a protective "cushion" by umpires and pitchers who cannot pitch inside.<br>  <br>  In short, Ortiz is a very good hitter, but I believe his success is as much due to modern baseball pitching/umpiring culture as it was who was behind him in the lineup.|`|d065d40a6781127c80dc5959554a2d4faa	I'm going to have to say its his own talent. No matter who is hitting behind you you still have to perform. His numbers may be down a little but he has been injured lately and isn't getting younger. Its hard to say that he isn't a product of his own talent when he is performing, you don't see the guy hitting in front of Manny Ramirez now having an amazing season.|`|LVp6OkwOaa	Ortiz is a Product of his own Talent.If he can get and stay healthy he is one of the best hitters in baseball|`|zsvDuHfEaa	ortiz has a lot of his own talent but there possibly was some tips or pointers from manny|`|628c0a7848ead945064eefd161db35aaaa	Manny helped him alot ..but Ortiz is  past his prime now..dont see any huge yrs left...

plTYZU85aa	Maybe a couple months, I recommend this training aid called Jumpsoles, it is just like doing toe raises/calf raised, but all of your body wieght is on your calfs, and people have gained like 6inches in 4 weeks on there verticals.|`|IiWz11Kraa	same as myself. Im 5'10, and can touch the rim 9'6 - probably 9'8 now. If you are trained effectively, you'll dunk in two months or less. I watched videos with kids improving fast (i hope some of that is true).|`|XnhJZQvfaa	If you really want to improve your Vertical jump, first you need to figure out what type of Jumper you are, a power jumper or a leaper, as using optimal biomechanics is just as important as having explosive muscle power. Next you need to figure out what type of power or strength you are lacking. The three basic types of strength are: Base strength, transitional power, and explosiveness or "Reactive" power, they are all different and must be trained in different ways. Now I know a lot of you are wondering what's the difference between the three. Well in short Base Strength is how much weight you can move, Transitional Power is how fast you can move said weight and explosiveness is the maximum speed and distance you can move said weight with each single movement. A good Vertical Jump training routine will include the following exercises:<br>  <br>  Base Strength <br>  1: Traditional Squats and Pistol Squats <br>  2: Deadlifts/base building olympic lifts <br>  3: Lunges <br>  4: Core Work (Functional Performance Core Strength= The ability to make your pelvis and spine "lock" and work as a single stable unit, not simply having a 6 pack or being able to do 100 crunches) <br>  5: Stretching<br>  <br>  Transitional Power: <br>  1: Box Squats/Tempo Squats <br>  2: Power Cleans <br>  3: Push Press <br>  4: Core Work <br>  5: Stretching<br>  <br>  Explosiveness: <br>  1: Ballistic and jump squats <br>  2: Traditional and Compound/Hybrid Plyometrics <br>  3: Sprinting <br>  4: Core Work <br>  5: Stretching<br>  <br>  You'll also want to figure out which individual muscles/muscle groups are working inefficiently. You can figure this out by completing a full vertical jump test progression and a baseline fitness test to diagnose any muscle imbalances that you may have. Remember no matter what type of training program you do you must make sure that opposing muscles are strengthened and balanced (e.g. Quads and hamstrings, abs and lower back) so don't skip the quad extensions and hamstring curls. If opposing muscles are not strengthened they will lead to weak links, energy leaks and imbalances will result in poor or slow improvement and raise the risk of injury significantly. Do a routine that combines plyomertic/bodyweight, free weight and or acceleration routines. Make sure you are consuming lots of protein to aid in muscle repair after tough workouts You'll also want to replenish your bodies ATP and glycogen stores as they are the fuel for those type IIa and type IIb muscle fibers you will be (AKA FG and FOG) shredding during your workout. In order to gain inches you'll need to tax your central nervous system and force your body to create new motor pathways. If you train correctly you should gain at least an inch a week. <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7PxcPllTyRA" rel="nofollow">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7PxcPllTy...</a><br>  <br>  Jump 20 inches higher in 10 weeks:<br>  <a href="http://www.program51.com" rel="nofollow">http://www.program51.com</a>|`|z6CBWSnFaa	now. the shortest guy to dunk is 5'3. and its ok being 5'8.<br>  <br>  i found out that i could dunk at 5'11. i am 14 now, and 6'2.<br>  <br>  just practice speed. and timing. gd luck :p|`|cWnmJDBEaa	Upto 25 years It will be|`|jDi063pQaa	Just check out this guy.

Manny is one of the best hitters ever to play, but Lowell and Youk can and i think will fill in nicely (even tho Youk just struck out with the bases loaded... overrated bum... I hate Youk, he has a poor attitude)|`|nxymxSUFaa	The best way to explain it would be that with Manny hitting behind David, the opposing pitcher could not pitch around him.  If he walks than Manny has at least one man on base when he comes to bat.<br>  <br>  Pitchers can now pitch around David because there is no one of any consequence, (certainly without the power of Manny) to be concerned about.  The Sox need someone like Manny to hit behind David once again.  If they can find someone I'm sure Ortiz has a few good productive years left.|`|1uSoU8Lpaa	We're teasing Manny like the Bash brothers here. <br>  Maybe you can't have one without the other.  <br>  <br>  Manny was the backbone and Ortiz fed off of Manny. It's never bad to have 2 hard hitting guys on one team.|`|5IOeWcOxaa	Well my friend, it is very simple.  <br>  <br>  Manny Ramirez was already one of the best hitters in the game before David Ortiz showed up in Boston.  Ortiz was a subpar player while he was with the Twins.  Then when the Red Sox picked him up, Manny did in fact help him out with a couple of things.  But the thing is, Manny Ramirez batted fourth while Ortiz batted third.<br>  <br>  Pitchers threw really good pitches to hit to Ortiz because they didn't want to throw junk and let him walk when they had a guy like Manny on deck who they knew could hurt them even more.<br>  <br>  Thats it basically.  Batting in front of Manny allowed Ortiz to hit big fat juicy fastballs all the time.  That is why he was known for hitting walk off homeruns.  The pitchers never got to Manny who was on deck because they gave their best hittable pitches to Ortiz,<br>  <br>  Now with Manny gone, Ortiz has no protection behind him or in front of him and he is not even close to the same hitter that Ramirez is.<br>  <br>  Basically, Ortiz is gonna suck again like he did with the Twins.<br>  <br>  The Red Sox after this year will be terrible again.<br>  <br>  I really hope you're not a Red Sox fan because you'll have to wait like another 90 years or so for your next title.<br>  <br>  Manny literally was the difference maker.  <br>  <br>  He has never ever been on a losing team.  Everywhere he goes the teams make the playoffs.  When in Cleveland, then he came to Boston and made the differece because who was Boston in the 90's?<br>  <br>  Then in L.A he carries the Dodgers to the NLCS.  <br>  <br>  Manny is no coincidence, he's just the X-Factor.|`|zsvDuHfEaa	they seemed like best friends on the team <br>  and what they did reflected the other<br>  so they kinda were very strong together<br>  so its like loosing your best friend who when he was around was like your good luck charm because you were so close to him|`|e9dHHGCSaa	Manny, like him or not, is one of the best hitters ever.

Njom1Wbtaa	In Saturday, the main event of the schedule would be Miami Heat VS Cleveland Cavaliers, or should I say Dwayne Wade VS Lebron James. They've scored twice on their careers 40 plus points against one another. It would be fun, but the Detroit Pistons VS Atlanta Hawks would be my choice of being the best game on the particular schedule. Simply, because:<br>  <br>  - The Pistons broke their slump, and now winning, and beating teams such as Boston and Orland, not to mention they did it on the road. <br>  <br>  - Richard Hamilton VS Joe Johnson is the match-up I really like to watch.<br>  <br>  - The chemistry of both teams are fitted well enough for a close and decisive game.<br>  <br>  It would be a good game, but if anything goes wrong, I mean badly wrong for one of the two teams, the result would be a rout.<br>  <br>  In Sunday, the schedule is just plain obvious, San Antonio Spurs VS Phoenix Suns, these two teams bring the best of each other, may it playoffs, first game of the season, first game of the playoffs or even outdoors.|`|AA11110524	Saturday, of course Miami/Cleveland<br>  <br>  Sunday, Orlando/Boston<br>  <br>  But of course i will be watching the my team the Warriors play(and yes i know they're bad)..|`|W6jjsiMxaa	San Antonio vs Phoenix, when they play it's always exciting because of their rivalry!<br>  <br>  BQ: I'm going to watch the Spurs/Suns game.|`|adM9rI7Faa	phoenix and san antonio is always a great match im lookin forward to that game i think dat one is gonna be da best.|`|s1IkFOJVaa	miami heat vs cavs|`|0ytjj1EGaa	Orlando boston is THE BEST GAME<br>  <br>  <br>  And Yes There R Some guys missing|`|5FypDafWaa	miami and cleveland|`|BhrT5Sagaa	miami/cleveland dude!!|`|SpAv1g2maa	I will see today game between the Miami -vs- Cleveland and enjoy tomorrow game: Suns -vs- SA, Today the Cav's will win and Sunday's winner will be the Spurs,Can't wait to see the match between Shaq & Gooden,who just arrived to S.A.|`|bnCRvs3zaa	Definately Orlando/Boston. These two play each other close all of the team. Both teams also got big wins tonight which should help for their match up on sunday. Although the San Antionio/Phoenix game should be a great one to watch as well.|`|IZ1nLtKOaa	Miami VS Cavaliers....go MIAMI!|`|xhHfXuKFaa	on sunday im gonna watch duke beat UNC and the hudson river rivalry (nets vs knicks)|`|Ch9TedMcaa	San Antonio and Phoenix.

0BhcnLVbaa	I think HBK as he is more experienced. Undertaker has been working in WWE for 18 years, HBK even longer than that at 20 years. These two have been holding the company together for nearly 20 years and they always provide quality matches (From the 1st ever Hell In A Cell to the Royal Rumble match a decade later) and I would hope to see them spar for one last time before either retires. HBK will surely provide a stiff test for the Undertaker with his technical nous like never before & will be the greatest threat to the streak as a believable competitor.<br>  <br>  For Cena, he will fall like any other competitor before him. Although Cena has a long history of beating the odds, the Undertaker is no pushover. If Triple H, Kane (twice), Edge, Diesel & Sycho Sid failed to defeat Undertaker, why would Cena be able to beat him? On virtue that the kids that will be rooting for him? It would be a big match, but Undertaker is a legend at Wrestlemania and he will leave with his streak intact.|`|aEB5p3pPaa	HBK- because he's the Showstopper,the Main event and he's Mr.Wrestlemania.so anytime he can beat Undertaker.and he's also in the same level as the Undertaker is.Cena is nothing,he can't even beat Undertaker.|`|8Mt0vgryaa	well HBK is going to retire after WM 25 because it'll be a retirment match, so unfortunately cena|`|9QKu9ynxaa	it all depends on the writers...come on dude, theres no surprises when that **** is predetermined. dont tell me u think its real?|`|yl86ZQ6Daa	HBK would be a bigger threat as he has more experience...|`|ULSUqmeZaa	A lot of people would be pissed off if Cena broke the streak.|`|fRC3SLJMaa	HBK|`|6LQNK51uaa	I think no one is a threat for his streak..I believe he is going to retire with his streak <br>  Or if I have to chose one in this two than HBK is the biggest and only threat for his streak..b/c it can built him as the man who can end any thing in pro wrestling.|`|xKXu0Qb2aa	Cena.<br>  Simply for the Fact.....He's John Cena.<br>  He's the Poster Boy of the New Generation & The Face of the Entire WWE.<br>  With All the Media Outlets He Dominates , All the Money He Makes , & How Incredibly Over He is with the Kiddies....It Honestly Wouldn't be Surprising if it WAS Him.<br>  <br>  That Said , Even if Cena DOES face 'Taker at WM26 , He's Still Not Gonna Break "The Streak".<br>  It's Just NOT Gonna Happen.<br>  No One is Gonna Break the Streak. Ever.<br>  <br>  Even Cena Doesn't get to do it.<br>  No One Does.|`|Z5bH2LOZaa	Well by then Cena should be a lot better wrestler. He is getting better all the time. So if he keeps improving then I think that this could be a good match. They need to change Cena's gimmik to.|`|2569693fcb1ad34247c096f0e4bd3ffaaa	Cena because he is a bigger money maker and can market himself better to kids then HBK does and he is as Vince's butt kisser so he might be able to break the streak|`|Y5RDEkElaa	The Heart Break Kid because he is the one who broke Vladimir Kozlov's undefeated streak + he is known as Mr. Wrestlemania!|`|1EKMsuXpaa	I think I will wait until next year, and if that's the case he's going to beat HBK.
5fwIsT9Baa	Don't know never really thought about it suppose Merinourinho
ReaD6u4paa	martin oneil..he is doing a great job at aston villa and fergie once touted hinm as his replacement<br>  mourinho- great coach though arogant<br>  carlos quieroz-good coach and he knows the team very well|`|wQUkZm2Oaa	For me Martin O'Neill would be a great manager at United and also believes in entertaining football unlike Mourinho.|`|7x4VtGtFaa	Definitely NOT Rafa Benitez.|`|ro4fyuI8aa	prob keane or mark hughes but mourinho wudn be bad either hes great manager|`|9v9W73HLaa	either jose mourinho or mark hughes, because jose is brilliant and i think mark hughes is a very very good manager who even thought he's not doing great at city (but to be fair it was a poor team to begin with and now its got a few brazillians), and he didn't abandon his morales of using youth players by buying every half decent player in europe like chelsea did just because he had the money|`|0ytjj1EGaa	i am not and man fan<br>  <br>  <br>  But i Think Mourinho is good|`|tIBZ9Gi3aa	Mourinho,anyone else would be a downgrade.
dcivVK8haa	Martin O'neill, Phil Brown, David Moyes All deserve a chance at a big club. Basically there is no plan B. As an arsenal fan i would like to say that i dont moan about us not winning trophys as i trust wenger completely and i enjoywatching the way we play entertaining and fluent football regardless of win or loss. the day we play like liverpool or chelsea is the day i hand back my season ticket.|`|AA12370193	Who's moaning.. I certainly do not want him to leave. I can't blame him for players getting injured.|`|LReOvHEdaa	Good answer From Mrme..<br>  Arguably majorty of fans worldwide are fans of Arsene's Arsenal.<br>  Next Manager would be Pat Rice I guess....|`|7Xridrxaaa	Dennis Bergkamp jk
bNykcEVXaa	Not sure .. but you OBVIOUSLY are not talking about me..lol<br>  you having problems with the OPTION..?lol<br>  <br>  <br>  dR bad<br>  but is this a real footie question..? and would you mind if it was endless anti-Man Utd questions.. ?<br>  <br>  y'know with you being an ABU and all?<br>  <br>  Edit: To be honest.. (personally) I ask a lot of questions about Chelsea/Man city/ Arsenal/liverpool..and even Spurs when they lose... (just ask their fans on here ..lol) I absolutely slaughtered Chelsea after the liverpool/Man Utd games... whichever top 4 team that messes up will definitely get stick on here...  (chelsea get the least because they have the least fans)|`|fpbLkbJzaa	I think you've answered your own question - they're too dumb to experience boredom or to appreciate how boring they are to others.<br>  I hear more sense from a bowl of Rice Crispies.|`|0dTXkBopaa	Man i agree 10000000000000000000000000000000%<br>  <br>  there saying all this sh!t about oh yeh 2nd in the premier league still in contention for the champs league<br>  <br>  big woop<br>  <br>  havent won the champions league in 4 yrs <br>  havent won the PREMIER LEAGUE<br>  <br>  ever<br>  <br>  and in my mind gonna come 3rd or fourth<br>  this is their only "stand out" year<br>  where there not battiling for a 4th place champions league spot.|`|AA12370193	I don't think it can ever get boring because the way most Liverpool fans react to them (or don't react) is priceless.|`|3lFDvyY9aa	I have to agree with you it does get damn annoying|`|cjNtjOZtaa	It's all part of the Package . I think people just need to accept  that .  And take it with a pinch of salt .|`|lVjBfpYOaa	Having read a lot of the questions on here, most of them are just about a supporter of one team slagging off another, which can raise a smile for about 2 seconds and then becomes useless.|`|xLyNsywiaa	Like someone said its a forum, the anti- Liverpool question can usually be known from the headlines, so just don't click it...|`|7x4VtGtFaa	It's a free world mate. You can ignore it if you want.|`|a7CAbI9jaa	That's not even a question you freak!! Liverpool of this century are just not classy enough! You will ALWAYS walk alone!|`|8caee7090c48436f326e0f2dd5b622d6aa	its the same with the ABUs .. also arsenal get a lot of stick ...they are big clubs bloosboy its to be expected ...lol...|`|JCRdicqXaa	Not bitter about Chelsea's lack of attention are we ?
IiWz11Kraa	Probably in Detroit next year. BTW, I am so happy for Ai for agreeing to be a sub. If he really meant what he said, he's really matured and deserves more respect. he's like "I will do whatever it takes to win a champ for Detroit, even coming off the bench..." really, i changed my mind about him. He's a true team player.|`|vFbzBo4eaa	He will go to the NYK or some other team|`|qWI3XBnCaa	I think with portland or pistons again.|`|7cvr8qVCaa	He will resign with the Pistons|`|4DcvpQXfaa	I hope yes|`|5FypDafWaa	he will be with some sucky no name team|`|J03Qy5aoaa	I think he will be grabbed by a team like the buck's, someone who is not so popular.|`|YEz9iq6Yaa	No, they are too satisfied with Andre MIller, and he may be picked up by New York or Houston|`|IZ1nLtKOaa	I think Detroit will be his last team.
7x4VtGtFaa	Aston Villa was the last premier league club to field an all-english squad. It happened on 27-02-1999 at Villa Park in a match against Coventry. <br>  <br>  Aston Villa 1 - 4 Coventry.|`|28V4Tffaaa	Yeah it was Boro and was pretty much made up of local academy lads most of whom are now first team regulars (Downing, Wheater, Turnbull, Macmahon and Johnson)|`|WWnkLkqqaa	aston villa 10 years ago|`|Pfq2zRejaa	hi phil.....sick name kid|`|J7pIy1LWaa	Middlesbrough. Happened in the 2005/2006 Premiership season. Steve McClaren's last Prem game in charge of Boro. They played Fulham and drew 0-0.|`|9v9W73HLaa	i'm not positive but i think villa have done it this year, otherwise as someone has already said boro 04/05|`|fcFBAsrhaa	villa did it and it is almost 10 years ago|`|FNiWMyhkaa	As im late to look at the question, the answer is above me a couple of times. it was middlesbrough.|`|H4E3P4pyaa	its never happened, if it has it would be a newly promoted club.
QtdO1RlQaa	Yes I think, its always not about the coach, its the team, the captain, the players, the morale. If u remember, we even won the T20 WC under Lalchand Rajput not Gary Kirsten and even (unless Im very much mistaken) part of the Tour Down under last year, Kirsten was not available. India is completely safe, since there is no political turmoil and better co-ordination, I think we are definitely in a better position than Pakistan is at the moment (sadly). So if Kirsten is going to resign because of these concerns, I would call him a fool, specially when his team is doing so well.|`|cOm8LQ1Daa	Yea, Team had started their golden ride before Gary came into play! Team India will still be there standing strong but Gary's resignation will be a huge loss!!!<br>  <br>  Gary is being just concerned, i don't think he will resign bcoz India is quite safe! Security in the border areas has been tightened and our intelligence authorities are quite vigilent, now a days!! I'm sure BCCI will provide Gary with the recent security report.....India is SAFE! Gary won't be leaving. BCCI & our Indian govt. will take care of everyone!|`|b7f6b1292b666a974a7a9c247d278b21aa	He has kindled the winning hunger.  The team is molded.  The Selection Committee is sensible.  The players are talened and young.  So there are very bright chances.|`|k7Rtcqfraa	Yes, we were doing well under Lalchand Rajput as well.|`|Zl8svqUGaa	For as example- india team did well in t20 world cup, indian team won in australia common wealth odi series and also they had won in england in test series.<br>  So, this is enough to tell that they did well without coach in the past and they can do well in the future because it is almost same team which had played before.<br>  I agree that gary has done brilliant job but also youngster should get credit for playing very well.<br>  <br>  gary doesn't have any magic wand from  which he can make win matches for indian. Atlast indian team players has to perform on a field.|`|bN6S0FJEaa	Its players who are performing well for India.<br>  <br>  Gary is an excellent Coach but the players have to perform well.<br>  What did Pak team did in 2007 WC, when they had coach like Bob Woolmer (Late).|`|rjWRMDYUaa	yes,i am sure even without gary kristen india will keep their success going.<br>  We need an indian coach ,i don't know why we took foriegn coaches .|`|VbWhiBAHaa	Yes|`|04Mvb5dmaa	Yup.<br>  Why not?|`|e7f9613d5b480e9758d037bfe66ac6b9aa	yes|`|RGxMkT0zaa	Yes. India was doing well before he joined.
f3f63c87e27f64c3e9f1679c165409b8aa	I've used it (and other scents) before with limited results.   Like you I think there has to be a good (1 to 1) ratio for it to work well.  If you have lots of does then the bucks don't have to work and sniff out new honey's as much as they normally would.  Just seems like the stuff works better when there's a one to one ratio.|`|elJHDb1jaa	I have had good luck with smoke scents. I know they work after watching bucks come running in with there lips curled and deaf to everything around them. No scent is going to work if there are no deer in the area. Do you r homework and make sure your stand is in a good spot. Then use your scents as something to bring the deer in when you want them in.|`|llcbe14kaa	I've used it with varying degrees of success. Last year, I started using a product called "Deer Herd In A Stick" that looks like a stick of deodorant but smells like deer. I started doping my spot with it about 2 weeks before the season opened and I had filled my tags within the first 10 days of the season. I normally only have deer passing through, even when I feed and put out minerals but they seemed to be hanging out a lot more this year.|`|0tpLq6meaa	Most of the deer lures do not work.Some have had limited success with a few of them, but you have to understand,there is not enough captive deer in the US to supply deer hunters with all the doe in heat lures that are sold.What does that tell you?|`|XI6ZxyWVaa	CODE BLUE!<br>  I get results everytime I use it.
bNykcEVXaa	Skill... and hard work...(apart from Berba-TOP of the league)<br>  <br>  <br>  dR bad|`|FFE9Qztzaa	If by Guardian Angel, you mean Brown envelopes, then yes .|`|fLpnC8qtaa	Hard work and dedication have their role, SAF has his as do the players and leaders like Giggs and Scholes so its a combination, yeah, with lots of Guardian Angels who watch over the team and club..they are all our now gone hero's, players and staff alike that loved this club United and our beloved Sir Matt and his babes !! May they long watch over and guard United :))|`|0t8XYZKRaa	The secret to success is:<br>  Determination+Hard Work+Skill and that is simply what Manchester United have and that is the reason why the red devils are at the top of the Premier League.|`|8caee7090c48436f326e0f2dd5b622d6aa	its all down to one great man SAF . and martin edwards who stood by him and gave him a chance when it took 4 years to land his first trophy..|`|7x4VtGtFaa	The old saying still holds true:<br>  success = 1 percent inspiration + 99 percent perspiration|`|51H2omf5aa	Although I hate to say it Man Utd are the best team in the world right now, I think they will win 5 trophies this season. If they do Ferguson should retire!!!!
wnbiRwSKaa	Man United if it was a matter of life and death:)|`|2689a1282752ca7ffe2179109138b9ceaa	Aston Villa, (because of the M.O.N. link, and for the last four years I have lived in the West Midlands.. but NOT in Birmingham). <br>  My 11 year old son supports the Villa too, but like me 'ra Bhoys will ALWAYS be his 1st team.|`|pMFOw0kfaa	Go Spurs! Also Southampton and Aldershot Town.|`|5Agn35EKaa	Liverpool.|`|IWM1khX7aa	Chelsea or Arsenal.|`|F3faAmsSaa	F.C Chelsea is my favorite but if i HAD 2 choose, Liverpool|`|QGU3kURjaa	it will be arsenal .|`|CpfFZ9exaa	Spurs|`|i4XwcScXaa	LIVERPOOL YNWA<br>  <br>  how could any of the dumb cu.nts here say theyd support a team because of MON he is one of the biggest wankers in footballs history. FACT|`|FPWKga43aa	just liverpool|`|GHefTsUyaa	Never.|`|BdiQPKn0aa	Leeds then Chester|`|OYYYNCyCaa	already support Man Utd<br>  <br>  <br>  then it would be Aston Villa<br>  <br>  reason Martin O'Neill|`|bzwSCm6taa	always looked out for the man city scores....the blue side of the city is always the best|`|euZRbiA2aa	Nottingham Forest|`|SiPGcBnYaa	manchester united
ApFh12Sqaa	I agree.|`|GswnLKtQaa	I think yes, last year stuckey have done a great job playing from the bench. Rip should start but it's only the only problem Pistons have right now. They also need to play motivated...which they aren't. Iverson should be a pass first PG he can do it.|`|Y32OY6PAaa	the only reason he is starting is because they want him to become the future pg for the Pistons. and plus you gotta admit hamilton is a SG but AI cannot play the PG. He plays 10x better at the SG|`|4DcvpQXfaa	I still think give Stuckey another chance|`|F05yVezraa	yea he is  not experienced compaared to AI

8caee7090c48436f326e0f2dd5b622d6aa	i like torres .. i like the way he puts himself over ... shh dont tell any liverpool fans i said that ... lol..|`|0t8XYZKRaa	Fernando Torres is already in a club that sits in the 2nd place of the Premier League but I think he deserves better because he is a pure quality player and deserves to play in clubs like Man United, Barcelona, Inter Milan etc.|`|JCRdicqXaa	You mean like Aston Villa ?|`|7x4VtGtFaa	You mean like Real Madrid. Ho ho ho!|`|9v9W73HLaa	well if he went to man utd he would have won something by now and wouldn't get as injured as utd have better physios|`|Az4OVLdFaa	Ye definitely, i always hoped he would have signed for united when he played for atletico|`|51H2omf5aa	We'll swap Heskey for Torres!|`|NDr2iTeWaa	yes, he should play for someone wayyyy bigger than liverpool!|`|7Tw7s6HSaa	Yes i do, he's a good player, deserves trophies, lol|`|FFE9Qztzaa	I read that, Deano ;-)
q71osfkiaa	Rafa is going to stall more on the contracts...|`|1IG4GdGqaa	I honestly think it means that Rafa gets one transfer period to make a big deal go through (whether that's three prospects that blossom into LFC heroes or just one big signing remains to be seen) However if he can't and LFC can not win the premiership then I think Rafa is out. I also think this hurts LFC's academy which Rafa wants control over. There is no need for a manager to have control over that. He needs to manage the team and nothing else. I am starting to think Rafa is getting to much power, this could be very bad for LFC and i hope Parry gets a good job soon. He's a great guy and CEO.|`|PrsbAjZAaa	2 points?|`|AA12362958	It will mean that Reds' long awaited New Era has finally arrived! Rafalution didn't help the club enough, maybe a New Era will!

Benitez has been Liverpool's most successful manager of the last 20 years, winning the European Cup and the FA Cup and qualifying for the Champions' League every season, which the article has conveniently failed to mention. Without continued support from the boardroom, how is he supposed to build a team that can challenge for the title and remain competitive for the whole season? Anyway, it would be madness to let him go if Liverpool did not have a better alternative manager waiting in the wings, and at the moment there is none.

8xyFCsMRaa	i for one is excited to see valero fight real competitors.<br>  <br>  he is currently a myth right now as everyone is doubting the credibility of his wins.  but who can dispute the fact that those KO's did not go beyond 3 rounds.  i say the guy is a raw but gifted fighter.<br>  <br>  the rumor that the welt dela hoya got while filming 24/7 was caused by valero who sparred with dela hoya adds to the myth.<br>  <br>  i think everyone is curious bout this boy.|`|dh48AkbCaa	valero deserves to gain recognition in the states, and hopefully the world, but he really needs to tighten his defense before taking on the big guns.|`|cyqGJZNOaa	I am excited.

ae530cfc7c3f9fd6506b72dc76a8d126aa	During the last Rugby World Cup there had to be some matches played on a Friday night. The French RFU were very pleasantly surprised by both the turnout and the television audience for these matches and wanted to experiment with this kick-off time for the Six Nations.<br>  <br>  The Welsh RFU saw merit in this arrangement and agreed to take part. So the 2009 France v Wales and the 2010 Wales v France matches will kick off on Friday night. The experiment will be assessed in the spring of 2010.|`|bR5Dzulsaa	Because the French wanted to make life difficult for everybody!<br>  <br>  Nobody wants matches on a Friday night!<br>  <br>  The great thing about the 6 Nations is that you can ake a whole day out of it. <br>  <br>  If I go to Cardiff to watch Wales I would leave Ystalyfera at about 10:00, gt o Cardiff around 11:00. Have a meal at 12:00, a pint or two before the match. Go in and watch the match, then out for a night in Cardiff.<br>  <br>  If the match was on a Friday I would have to leave work at 6:00 on the dot, get to Cardiff around 7:00. Straight into the stadium, then wach the match. After the match it's really too late to go out, so you just go home.

When he's on the field and actually giving an effort he's incredibly fun to watch and will give you those moments where the only word you can say is "wow".
AA10259042	There are a few more differences than that.  One of the main differences is in the eye relief.  The extreme has 17 mm eye relief and the action only 12 mm.  The difference is mainly important if you wear eye glasses.  As for the water proofing of the extreme, I would not put a great deal of faith in that ability.  Porro prism binos are extremely difficult to waterproof, it is my understanding.  I read a complaint from a birder concerning a different brand of porro prism binos that were supposed to be fogproof/waterproof that failed in Costa Rica.  He had to put them in the oven to de-fog them.

PrsbAjZAaa	Because the majority of the time , the decisions go United's way , i meen atleast one time in the season the ref will go towards one team more than the other , but it just seems to be United more often than not.|`|lSa6lV7Maa	... because they do?<br>  Not as much as people make out, but it does happen<br>  They get away with a few things that other teams woudnt.<br>  Im sure theyd still be topping the legue even without the refs turning the occasional blind eye.<br>  <br>  just found this as well:<br>  <br>  "Why hasn't Ronaldo been charged for his off the ball kick at an opponent last weekend? with Wright-Phillips & Stokes' Etherington currently serving 3 game bans for similar offences, surely the FA will be keen to prove Benetez's accusation of 'one rule for United & one rule for the rest' wrong won't they?

Even if MU gets screwed by the ref, there'll be someone out there who will say that the ref should have sent off the whole team.<br>  <br>  That's the price you pay for success.

9kfmdYXyaa	that's the beauty of the game, if the club can only be represented by players from the same country, then why not just host fifa wc every year? what's the point of playing club football? henry scored for barca in midweek, ribery and toni scored twice each in midweek for a german club, and inter strikeforce are two foreigners... it's not just english teams... tell me, who is chelsea and liverpool key players? lampard, terry and gerrard names will definitely pop up although torres, drogba all are key players.. if you look at barca, they depend heavily on an argentine, french and cameroonian to win every game, and ac milan is star-studded with beckhan and samba stars of ronaldinho, kaka and pato|`|e6TD1j1gaa	I understand that a lot of big Premier League teams have players from non-British countries, but don't you want the best players from the world on your team? Doesn't that raise the level of play that allows the Premier League to remain the most competitive (and fun to watch) sporting league in the world?<br>  <br>  Plus, Man United has 14 Brits on their squad alone, that's far more than any other foreign nation has on United.|`|VsPUNQehaa	Yes I will feel proud! Thats the way things are these days, and not just in the premiership...Inter didnt field a single Italian against Utd, and Liverpool had more spanish players playing than Madrid.<br>  <br>  Once these players show honest commitment and love towards your club I think you should be happy. As a liverpool fan I am very happy, we might not have the best squad but everyone tries their hardest for the club (as seen on wednesday). Thats the connection between the fans and the players (foreign or otherwise), its the want succeed, to win trophies!|`|0t8XYZKRaa	Hmmm Robbie that is a very good, interesting question.<br>  I would ofcourse feel very proud because I don't really care if the foreign players at my club score. The only thing that I would probably care about is my favourite club winning the Champions League and the other trophies that they can win.|`|SRPwwLJ9aa	i feel connection because there are human and they are playing a wonderful game like football and most of arsenals english players always end up leaving because they don't want to be patient and wait, if you check the premiership and lower divisions you will be amazed how many came from the arsenal academy to any other premiership club|`|7Tw7s6HSaa	It's the team i support, it doesn't matter who scores or plays.<br>  This could be classed as racist, some folk are very touchy on this section, no names of course|`|fpbLkbJzaa	That's a rather parochial view, surely ?  Days of essentially local participation and support have long gone- now that the global game can be watched by countless millions, from Los Angeles to Tokyo.  The influx of foreigners hasn't changed the quintessential English style of play - which is far more important than the accidents of geography.  The reach nowadays extends to millions buying shirts, paying TV subscriptions, etc across the world- a key source of income the purely locals couldn't generate (and thereby enable the big clubs to pay top dollar for the best players).<br>  Scouting locally (and beyond) and youth development programmes are better than before and I for one don't think the presence of foreigners restricts or limits home grown talent - it raises the bar for them to aim for.<br>  And I think it's a compliment to our game that the Bergkamps, Zolas, Henrys, Ronaldos etc chose/choose to play in England -  alongside our Rooneys, Lampards, Ferdinands, etc. They helped us match the Italian and Spanish 'giants' and added to the rich traditions of our own big clubs.|`|v8Q9bs8jaa	ok you're right<br>  but look at man u and chelsea last year...<br>  <br>  paul scholes scored the only goal against barcelona to take man u to the champions league final....<br>  <br>  <br>  frank lampard scored that crucial penalty to take Chelsea to the champions league final......<br>  <br>  <br>  both teams made it to the champions league final becoz og ENGLISH players...<br>  <br>  ok arsenal don't have that many english players ,just like liverpool<br>  <br>  but Theo walcott was are best player this season before he got injured and steven gerrard is liverpool's best player....<br>  <br>  <br>  ehat i'm trying to say is that the heart and sooules of Chelsea,Liverpool,Man U (and Arsenal) is english|`|g2QUNwZzaa	i think these teams try to atone for spending all their money on foreigners instead of developing local talent by making an englishmen captain (terry, ferdinand, gerrard)<br>  <br>  except arsenal, who seem to do everything ***-backward.<br>  <br>  and no, in answer to your question, i dont care what country the player who scores the goals from is on. im italian and as such hate french football, but will i be upset when anelka scores on buffon? no way....|`|mK06dus9aa	Yes, of course.

gBO908P6aa	Despite popular belief MMA is not a style, but a sport fighting competition and training methodology that allows two trained fighters to battle under a set of rules using any number of techniques from the stand-up striking styles to clinching, throwing and finally groundfighting styles.  <br>  As such, fighters in MMA train in striking and groundfighting techniques pulled from a number of disciplines - Brazilian Jiujitsu being one of them.  <br>  <br>  Brazilian Jiujitsu is a groundfighting style originated by the Gracie family of Brazil, that has evolved into being widely used for MMA competition.  It is a full blown style that has it's own history, techniques, culture, competitions, etc.<br>  <br>  The birth of MMA competition in the US began when Rorion Gracie, along with Art Davie and Rob Meyrowitz founded the first Ultimate Fighting Championship.  Rorion's brother, Royce, dominated the early UFCs using Brazilian Jiujitsu.|`|CkIeCNS4aa	Different.  MMA incorporates many martial arts.  Jiu Jitsu is just one of the martial arts involved.|`|nRBC4E5saa	They are different.  MMA is a training/competition format.  BJJ is a martial arts system.  BJJ is a grappling system with a specific lineage, that involves training with a gi and focuses on ground attacks.  MMA usually involves training in BJJ (although there are exceptions: Fedor Emelianenko, Karo Parisyan, Josh Barnett), but also includes training in other disciplines, such as boxing, Western wrestling, Judo, Muay Thai, Taekwondo, and so on.  MMA competitions do not usually involve a gi, and the emphasis is on equal parts striking and grappling.|`|lj3hNR9baa	MMA is exactly what it says, Mixed! In MMA you have fighters who have studied several different styles taking the best from each style. Such as taking the punching from boxing and the kicks from taekwandoo. In Brazilian Jiu Jitsu (which I am studying at the moment) is mainly grappling and ground work. When I say ground work I'm talking about the arm bars, the chocks, and the sweeps. Also, there's also some take downs. Brazilian Jiu Jitsu is not a striking style. Striking can be incorporated into the style though.|`|WUVGFINnaa	MMA is a mix of any art like fighters can have their own styles anything from judo, to Jiu Jitsu, Karate and Muy Thai...MMA is just a mix of that all in one its more of a type of combat over a martial art thats why its called mixed martial arts...Brazilian Jiu Jitsu is just one of those arts|`|JMnu0rBiaa	Brazilian Ju Jitsu is grappling, on the ground.<br>  You use your body to bend or choke theirs, easiest i can put it.<br>  <br>  MMA Is a mix between a few different standing and slight ground fighting marital arts.|`|AA11440402	MMA is a group of martial arts (including jiu jitsu) that is used in the UFC or other fighting groups.

7cvr8qVCaa	The Sacramento Kings selects Blake Griffin.<br>  <br>  Blake and Kevin would be deadly. Also add JT and Hawes. Equals Kings to the playoffs in 2010.|`|c4b596d15eac948f611f72b6a99f85a0aa	Blake Griffin.<br>  <br>  Doesn't matter what team gets the pick, Griffin is the unanimous #1 pick.|`|vFbzBo4eaa	Blake Griffin|`|0ytjj1EGaa	I Dont know Much about NCAA<br>  <br>  but I Hear about BLAKE GRIFFIN|`|ruYcE8i0aa	Sometimes the choice is obvious, like 2003 with LeBron James. Everybody knew well ahead of time that the team that got the first pick would draft James regardless of how well he actually fit with their team or what they thought about the others in the draft. When a pick is that good, you just make room for him. <br>  <br>  Blake Griffin is that guy this year, unless he gets injured or has some sort of meltdown. Practically every mock draft has him on top. I agree with response #4 that there are other guys in the mix, but I think they'll actually be competing for the second pick. Griffin is #1.|`|9ymzwJwqaa	the obvious answer is Blake Griffin, however, stepping aside a moment from his gaudy looking stats, you'd have to analyze Griffin as a pro-prospect firsthand.<br>  <br>  Griffin is listed as 6'10, which means hes probably only 6'8 ish, which is not your typical PF build, he gets the numbers he does because its college, I do not believe he was any more of a dominant player than Michael Beasley or Kevin Durant, he's probably not even as dominant a big man as Kevin Love. His entire offense consists of a 3 foot baby hook and dunks, basically the offensive arsenal of Dwight Howard when he first came into the league, except Dwight is light years ahead of him in terms of physical potential.<br>  <br>  Even though he probably will end up as the #1 pick, I personally think that the best prospect is Hasheem Thabeet from UConn, he is 7'3 and a true dominant center, something you don't get alot these days.|`|HcSQPUYWaa	Hasheem Thabeet would be the number one pick.  Sacramento would be foolish to pass up on the next Dwight Howard.  People are just now starting to realize that Blake Griffin is just Michael Beasley in a different uniform.  Any team that takes him number one will be disappointed!|`|VZMLMHLpaa	Blake Griffin, Brandon Jennings, Ricky Rubio, or Tyler Hansbrough...it all depends what the team wants. they could be looking for immediate talent or someone they can develop.|`|UYPfC5YVaa	You're Kings is so lucky this draft year.

My examples are pretty poor but they will give you an idea how names might develop.|`|8bTder08aa	The Dread Pirate Roberts gave a good explanation.  Let me see if I can expand on that a little.<br>  <br>  Back in the pre-industrial revolution times, things were a lot more localized than they are now.  Various regions developed types of horses (and other types of domestic animals) that had become over time particularly adapted to the demands of the region.  And people from other regions would refer to those characteristic animals by the area where they were found.  "Those big bay horses with the feathery white legs and blazes that you see all around Clydesdale" would eventually become shortened to "Clydesdale horses" and "Clydesdales."<br>  <br>  Other livestock with regional names:  Jersey and Guernsey dairy cows, developed on the islands of Jersey and Guernsey;  Holstein-Friesian cows, from the Holstein-Friesia region of what's now Germany;  Hampshire sheep, from the Hampshire area of England; Dartmoor and Exmoor ponies, from the Dartmoor and Exmoor regions of England.<br>  <br>  Here in the US, we have somewhat the same phenomenon:  Missouri Foxtrotter horses and Tennessee Walking Horses.  The breed of horse that came to be known as the American Quarter Horse was originally a physical type of horse that was known by a variety of names, such as "Steeldust horses" from the name of the stallion who stamped his get with very definitive physical characteristics;  "Waggoner" or "Kleberg" horses, from the breeders who were known to produce horses of that physical type.  (When the breeders who started the AQHA stud book got together to organize, it was partly to overcome personality issues and to avoid jealousy that they went with the name "American Quarter (or Quarter-running) Horse" rather than "Waggoner" or "Steeldust" or "Kleberg".)

lTeXIjpOaa	there is no exact amount that it will cost you, a lot will depend on choices you make, such as what tack to buy, or you could even borrow tack from another member/leader, it will depend if you are buying a horse, already own one, or will be borrowing a horse, same with a trailer and show clothes; for our 4-H club, you must pay a state fee of $10 a year, half goes to the state, half goes to the county and our club dues are $20 a year per child; 4-H is much cheaper than showing in open shows or on a circuit though, and most of the kids in my club pass clothes around, also, once you buy tack you will have it for a long time

o7gV56ngaa	You are dead right. America is not a breeding ground for good footballers (soccer players). The system that America is used to where they get players from college just doesn't work with football (soccer). The best footballers can sign professional contracts at 16 in civilized countries. College has nothing to do with it.
nfNuphJQaa	the heat would not make it to the playoffs, the lakers would probably be the same except they will only lose 11 times.|`|UK0iFTyeaa	i think you are a jerk..|`|vFbzBo4eaa	I desagree with the second guy.I think Dwayne WAde can fit if he plays in the LAkers.He will set up a lot a peole and get to score by him self and will rise the level of the defense.<br>  <br>  Kobe will not fit in the Heat.He's a ball hog,he's selfish,he's just a scorer and many peole don't agree with this what i am i saying but it's the truth.He can only score and shot,he's slelfish and doesn't know the word "pass"|`|hLSIRDtZaa	LOL...Ain't going to happen. My Wade would never go to the Lakers. Anyway, Wade will do better no matter what team he's on. Wade is Wade- the god reigns supreme! Wade has the heart of Bryant and James put together, he'll battle with anyone on the hardwood and win!|`|w7gm67dPaa	Kobe is a semi-established good defender (i kno how many all defensive teams he made), wade just started hitting the steals this summer. Kobe is more of a compliment to Gasol on the inside and his wing players (Vujacic, Farmar, w/e). Wade is shorter, stockier stronger definitely but his passing needs work, he gets high assists, but who does he usually kick it out to? if kobe's having a cold shooting night, there is a better chance gasol or odom (less likely) will step up and at least make it competetive, than NE1 on Miami's squad when Wade goes cold. seriously, who consistently scores when Wade sits out? Beasley, Chalmers and Cook have their nights, but not enough experience to be clutch (in more than one or a few games). LA might win in the reg season, but in the playoffs, their lost synergy gets them out in the semis, 4-2 in the conference finals at best. Miami would definitely tank, it'd be JUST like LA from 04-07, kobe sits, Miami disappears. it wouldn't work well and they'd need another overhaul that'd take 3 years and more drafts<br>  <br>  Z-boy...the question was HOW WOULD THE TEAMS DO???? we know who the players are, how would the TEAMS benefit...|`|ZvdiIVONaa	Seriously, 45 wins then 42 wins with a team of:<br>  YOUNG players<br>  Kwame brown as starting center...<br>  Smush Parker as starting Point Gaurd...<br>  In consistent Lamar Odom as starting PF/SF<br>  <br>  Wade got a chance to have: <br>  Shawn Marion and Jermaine Oneal, yet he still struggles to bring Miami to an elite status.  In Miami Championship year, he needed Shaq, Alonzo Mourning, James Posey, Gary Payton,Jason Williams.<br>  <br>  Wade only gets more assist because he plays more minutes and he doesnt play the Triangle offense like kobe does.  Still, his assist is just padding stats because he doesnt make his team better, they are still terrible|`|BfhIqYYzaa	wade is better,, bottem line,, i have said it before and say it again,, dont get me wrong kobe is great ,, but hugely bennifited by playing for phil jackson,, in a running conference,, kobe average would drop dramittically in the east,, wade would be much better in the west|`|J03Qy5aoaa	i think the heat would win a lil more and lakers a little less.
GfOR2H0kaa	"Dropping a dime" on someone = calling the police on a person. (10 cents into a pay phone) -- assisting the police in catching a criminal.<br>  <br>  It worked its way over to assisting a teammate in scoring -- dropping dimes --> assisting someone.|`|Bm5TLWgdaa	its slang for decision being made on a dime. being it was last minute decision.|`|p9W2CysKaa	Slang|`|v77SnunOaa	Its a drug reference. On the street a "dime" is reference to 10$ worth of what ever drug you like. For example weed would be a "dime bag".

gBO908P6aa	For $13.50 I'd say it fits the knife and if you want something cheap to practice with give it a shot.  As a real collector's item or for serious quality, I'd look elsewhere.  The "Stainless Steel" marking on the blade tells me it looks like one of those common "Made in China" untempered steel blades found everywhere these days.  I'd be careful and see if it is really steel or some cheaper metal alloy.  There's a whole thing about blades alone that I won't be able to get into from the method it's made to the grind to the materials and hardness etc, etc.  I'm not a hardcore knife buff but you see what I'm saying.  Some handles chip and break after flipping so many times.  I know I've encountered one that literally broke in half in my hands.  When I checked the handle it was nothing more that cheap metallic alloy with chrome painted on.  In addition to this, the pins for the joints began slipping and falling out.<br>  There's really no other description or anything based on this auction article so there's not much to go on.  It's your money, it's your call.  Personally if it were up to me, I'd look for something that's better quality.  Maybe something from Benchmade perhaps, better quality, good weight, etc.  Though I must warn you they will be expensive...<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.benchmade.com" rel="nofollow">http://www.benchmade.com</a>|`|r5AMG8g7aa	First youtube is a bad place to get information. Much of it is pure junk. As for butterfly knives (ballisong). They vary a great deal. I've seen many that are almost useless because the side the lock is on hinders the any attempt to open it fast. The when holding one you should be able to flip the lock off with your little finger(of the hand holding the knife)while starting the opening swing. The blade will swing back against your hand. If the lock is backwards the sharp side of the blade swings back into your hand cutting your hand immediately.  Many of the Ballisong knives I've seen are this way. If your knife is this way many of the ballisong techniques will not work. Many of the ballisong techniques are designed to use the opening move as a simultaneous cut. <br>  <br>  As for how good are ballisong....... Well they are no better or worse than any other knife. It always comes down to the skill of the user. Make your own judgment as to its merit. And yes it is illegal at least here in the U.S.A.|`|3KQRw8sPaa	its a fast and kinda sturdy knife great starter and never get the ones with the holes on the handle there fast but they brake easy!!!|`|JpU6q3zzaa	I used to play this game called 'johnny jumped the fence' with a knife like that.

BJJ is a ground-fighting martial arts system.<br>  <br>  MMA involves striking, takedowns, and ground grappling.  MMA fighters draw their techniques from a variety of backgrounds.  BJJ is the most common ground-grappling system, but Catch wrestling, amateur wrestling, Judo, and Sambo are also popular.  Takedowns usually come from these systems as well.  For striking, Western boxing and Muay Thai are the most popular, but fighters with backgrounds in karate, Taekwondo, and kempo also participate.|`|skDPEcc8aa	WHO DO U THINK GOT THE UFC STARTED ROYCE GRACIE AND IT INVOLVES ALL KINDS OF DIFFERENT FIGHTING STYLES
gBO908P6aa	Largely use of the name "Gracie" as a trademark and the type of emphasis the names stand for.  Brazilian jiujitsu IS from the Gracies so the names are synonymous.  However, over time and various schools of development (and lots of business bickering) the name Gracie Jiujitsu became wholly owned and trademarked by Rorion Gracie.  As a result, while the fighting style is the same, the names represent slight differences in approach.  Gracie Jiujitsu is still holds the approach toward self-defense while the more generic term of Brazilian Jiujitsu nowadays emphasizes more of the sport fighting aspect.|`|3DnX9NmAaa	Same thing.

TZi4ChYYaa	Well I have 2 opinons it's diffuiclut cos I'm a coach (gymnastics) but I get coached too. lol<br>  <br>  1. Coaches<br>  We should be aprochable, easy to talk to, easy to get along with but also be able to disipline particpants and strech the particpants to achieve their best.But be in control<br>  <br>  2. Particpants<br>  I may sound strange but I want a coach who will tell me if I'm slacking! If I do stuff not to best make me do it till I do it right. Not give us a task then we just chat about things! For example. there is one coach who i personally prefer cos she's nicer to me but doesn't strech me to my full potential. Then there is another who I don't like personally cos she can be a bit bitchy. But she will strech you and be bluntly honest with you about what you do sooo. I prefer the latter!<br>  <br>  I think as a person you have to have some intative and just strech yourself in a way coach yourself!<br>  Good luck|`|iaiF105Eaa	Id go for the pain in the *** :)

AtdiXf9oaa	The two players are both very good, but play differently...C. Ronaldo is more fancy moves while Messi is pure quickness and speed...I like them both but i prefer Messi|`|aNJYexPRaa	i've been playing and watching football for a while and i've noticed that players have changed significantly over the years. along with this, style, flair, speed of game...almost every aspect of the game has changed so drastically over the last few years. what i have noticed is that the two players you've mentioned are prob the best in the game.<br>  <br>  Christiano Ronaldo - Portuguese winger who prefers to use his right foot however he is really able to use both. he is probably the most flamboyant player in the history of football...he is extremely quick and has immense skill and control. if you have a look at youtube...you can see some of his ability...personally i look up to him as a player and try to mimic his overall style of play which to be truly honest is the best thing in football. he is the single most player to create the most fear in his opposition with his insane skill, absolutely amazing freekicks and insane ability in the air. he has revolutionized freekick taking as he can establish fear in a keeper from way out and at times, from acute angles. <br>  <br>  Lionel Messi - Argentinian winger who is left footed and is rarely seen using his right foot and has been compared to his idol and former Argentine player Maradona. he is heavily underrated and has immense skill and ability. he may not have the flamboyant style of Ronaldo but he his close control is second to none. he can take on anyone and can almost always bring the ball onto his favored left foot which is an amazing plus. personally, watching him playing...its poetry in motion. its inevitable that he will come out with the ball and he has insane vision and ability to read the game. another skill is his ability to score with almost no effort and make look good. <br>  <br>  both players are the best in the game however could be better compared if they played in the same league. keeping this in mind i think Lionel Messi is in my opinion the better player and can only move up and improve his game...Ronaldo has set such high expectations and his arrogance will be his ultimate downfall<br>  <br>  hope this helps you|`|dZoE4ItYaa	I like Messi more but I have to say Ronaldo is probably the better player|`|F3faAmsSaa	Messi , Right on!|`|0ytjj1EGaa	LIO MESSI|`|ZnXk0nlYaa	Thats easy<br>  Cristiano ronaldo!!!|`|IWM1khX7aa	Lionel Messi is the best soccer player in the world. Sure he's young, but that doesn't mean he can't be the best, because the performance he has had this season is undescribable, which is proof of his greatness. CRonaldo is a great player too, and obviously as good as Messi, but his performance is just not like last season's, where it was no question he was the best. Tides have turned a little bit since then, and Messi seems more wiser and has played better than anyone else in the world. He's the main reason why Barcelona has been the best in the world this season. Last season, everyone thought Ronaldinho would be the best again, but he was too slow and wasn't good. <br>  <br>  Messi and Ronaldo have different/same attributes. Messi is a little faster with the ball, but Ronaldo has more skill. Ronaldo can also take a beautiful free kick. But Ronaldo is overrated and he's very selfish, also he dives a lot. Messi is not overrated, less selfish, and he hardly dives at all. If you think you've seen Messi at his prime, think again! He's going to get better and better until he starts to get old. By then, he would have accompished many things. Lionel Messi is less selfish and people know him as a great footballer. Girls like Ronaldo more because of his looks, which I do not like because I don't care if the best player is ugly. <br>  <br>  However, if either player wins the Champions League this year, one of them will be the best player in the world. Right now, I have to say Messi because he performs better, and he is better.|`|a3y63ODRaa	i dont like ronaldo he dives when hes got a good opportunity and he does his stupid skills every time he gets the ball. he doesnt even seem to be trying for the team and it looks very arrogant. i really like messi and i think hes probably better on average.<br>  wanna put his name on the back of a barca shirt :)|`|U23DRFtbaa	Messi|`|BA1TOMr9aa	C.Ronaldo is the best player.

En el Ciutat de Valencia (2005) y en Balaídos (2006). Fue el encargado también de empatar el partido de la final de la Champions que ganó el Barcelona y segun dicen es el delantero que más goles a marcado en Espa?a desde que empezó el nuevo siglo.

AA11720887	Mauer is one of the best catchers in the game. Atkins has fair power and gets you good RBI's. Kinsler is great. Zimmerman is on several free agent lists. No power for a 3B and no speed. Jeter won't hurt you as SS. Good numbers at all categories. Soo is a good hitter for average but not much on any other numbers. 14 HR's for an outfielder is weak unless he has speed. He doesn't. Beltran and Pence are very good. Weak bench for hitters. Good pitching is your best hope. You look good there. Search free agents for a closer and if you find one, dump Litsch for him. Your best chance is finding players as free agents. Span and Hermida are usually free agents.

I can say more but my point is Mexico without Atlas and Chivas players is pretty much lame. Put in the whole squad as Chivas would be kind of a good idea but just take Reynoso and put in Rafa back there. Take out Baez and put in Pavel in there. Take out "Venado" and put in Guardado.|`|YSvICGAfaa	They think that they are all that.

And to the Barcelona-Chivas, Chivas goalie (Sergio Rodriguez) that was barley his second PROFESSIONAL game, imagine that, against Barcelona. Barcelona is more then Chivas of course they will win but its not like its impossible to beat Barca.

You do that way too much, and thats what you base EVERYTHING on, just like this question. Cause I know if your hear more than one Chivista say that your gonna say we ALL said it, we didn't. It's true, Goal.com did start that. They were saying that they should replace the Mexican National Team with one of their 100% Mexican club, since they are "more Mexican." I'm pretty sure the reason your hear Chivistas & others saying that is cause ALOT of people hate the fact that Sven is calling up naturalizados for a MEXICAN NATIONAL TEAM. Mexicans have alot of  Pride, we don't like the fact that, Argentinians or Brazilians represent OUR TEAM. From the outside point-of-view what must people think? That don't have talent! But we do.<br>  <br>  Yeah, I'm not sure if you know what I mean...|`|oBn8Mha1aa	chivas is the supposedly base of el tri, knowing they use more chivistas in el tri then how come mexico has been playing weak, and i know i know ya gonna say cuz of sven o extrajeros balh blah balh but ,still if chivas have been using top notch players for el tri, isnt the tri suppose to be good o getting better, chivas is a good team but get to cocky and say too much they aint suppose to say cuz in the end quedaran mal for big mouthing,, chivas talk to much, i aint hating but they seriously just shut up please, we tri as one no everyone revolves nomas around chivas, por eso el ser orgullo mexicano cuz we all from other teams represent mexico as one|`|AA11358486	well they have always been like it will never change <br>  i hear that sometimes when errikson calls up some of chivas players for a match like chivas has some good players but not seleccion type they are just jugadres de equipo like for example el venado medina<br>  <br>  well there is at least some cocky fans from each team .........

eAbSM1U6aa	There are several ways of determining caliber.  Some use the diameter of the unrifled barrel.  Others use the diameter of the barrel between grooves for rifling.  Some like the 38 special are not actually caliber but come from black powder days.  7.92x33 (AK rounds) are actually identifying the cartridge not just the caliber.  The 7.92 is diameter of the bullet in mm.  The 33 is case length in mm.|`|H4dswqRlaa	"Caliber" is a loose term, and is as quaint as people can stand! For example, 45 caliber in old handguns is .454" bullets, newer handguns it's .451-2", and in rifles it's .458". All properly called 45 caliber! Look up a caliber in a reloading manual, before deciding anything at all concerning loading of a firearm, or you might get an amusing surprise, and the attention of lawyers! Well, okay, if a specific caliber name is plainly printed on a gun barrel, then your worries are reduced to whether it can take +P ammo or not. If you want to use the +P, a reloading manual will often specify which models can take how much of it. Also the inspection by a gunsmith is always a good idea if one is not personally an expert, before shooting any new gun. An older gun might no longer be cleared for +P, and many K-frame 357's are no longer cleared for 357!  Regards, Larry.|`|h3xSRh8Taa	diameter of the bullet head. 45 ACP is is 0.05 inches smaller than 50 cal.<br>  <br>  the second number is the length of the cartridge case up to the neck wear the brass tapers in to the bullet diameter. This measurement is called the case length|`|cmvPENvoaa	the diameter of a .45 acp is really only .05 on an inch smaller than a .50 BMG, but you must take into consideration that diameter means nothing about the case length or the length of the bullet. the .45 acp usually has a weight of about 230 grains while the .50 BMG can weigh more than 600 grains.<br>  <br>  for your other questions, the x is used the same way you use it to dimension a 2x4, that is by 2 inches x(by) 4 inches.<br>  <br>  the second set of numbers shows the case length. a good example of this is the difference between the 7.62x51 NATO and the 7.62x39 Soviet. they're both have a caliber of .30 (7.62mm converts roughly to .30 cal) but the case length for the latter is 12 millimeters shorter than the 7.62x51 NATO.
ybzMow2zaa	Its a difficult one buddy it has to be said. Because swimming requires a high level of dedication but if you put as much in as possible then you should improve. I would recommend concentrating on your technique as this will help you as you progress. It would be wise to invest in some Books/DVDs which detail how to improve your technique. You I don't know what your level of fitness is like but you need to concentrate on what you eat as well as how much you train as it is vital that your body receives the correct blend of nutrients to build muscle. You also need to start attending meets to determine what events you are likely to do well in and gain valuable experience as to the structure of the event. Hope this helps buddy but it will be tough.|`|NPoTi5mWaa	You cant really get any faster than your capability but if i was you i'd keep training hard and take as many opportunities for swimming as possible. Perhaps aswell as keeping up with people in your age group you could also dedicate yourself more by going to lane swimming with the public and self train yourself but i dont mean to be horrible  but dedication is key and 7 months is impossible to beat your time by a lot im afraid.<br>  <br>  I swim at county level and i have to dedicate myself a lot, generally choosing swimminh over my friends which is harsh but if you want it so badly then you got to be willing to train and commit.<br>  <br>  Perhaps you could try to join a new club to gain a fresh start?<br>  I hope this helps x|`|WNXbM5Doaa	there's obviously something your doing wrong for you to be getting 54 secs. you probably want to be in the 30's for a 50 free. umm try asking the question again but record yourself swimming so we can see what's wrong. Also you can go to a local pool and usually they provide pretty good swim lessons for the individual if you don't mind paying that much money. I just started swimming last year with no prior swimming experience not even lessons or anything and my first 50 free time 30 secs. i had no skill at all but i had a lot of muscle so it evened out. either your weak or your form is bad. Good luck
268Rwp6zaa	You're fine. Next time just be more careful. take the mAh of the battery and divide it by the output of your charger. So a 2100 mAh battery charged by a 300 mAh output charger needs to be charged for 7 hours. If it's not hot, or burnt, or smelly, it is fine. Most batteries get warm after charging, it's just what happens.<br>  <br>  I might suggest getting smart charger; faster charges and is less likely to burn your batteries.<br>  <br>  -edit-<br>  <br>  Your gun will be fine too. you can use it.|`|RQP8P6Xbaa	Depends how overcharged. Whats the MaH?|`|CH0iOoWZaa	it wont damage ur gun but overcharging the battery is bad for the battery cells. it just wears down the battery life when it gets overcharged.|`|39SZUJj3aa	it wears down the battery or if its on the charger toooooooooooo long it could start a fire.
dDas43FZaa	Lately? He's always been hit or miss. I have written him off.|`|kvWF1a2Yaa	some have. im thinkin the ufc DOESNT want rampage as a title contender. they throw him at w silva and now jardine. they only wanted him in the 1st place so chuck could avenge his loss. they didnt bank on keeping him . one or two more losses for rampage and i think theyll cut him.|`|CnNAOoWgaa	Yes he's very hit or miss but he's one of the most crafty and unorthodox fighters out there and that's always a big wild card.  Its very difficult to train for someone who's as unorthodox and cerebral as he is and that could give him an edge over Jackson who probably hasn't faced anyone like him before.  Rampage will have the edge when it comes to speed and strength but never underestimate the power of craft and cunning in the cage.  If Jardine could upset Griffin and Liddell, there's no reason why he can't do the same with Rampage though the odds are definitely against him.  Rampage looks like a new man after destroying Wanderlei and he'll be eager to continue that momentum.|`|gq7HZoGRaa	You know what everyone cant write him off all they want, im sure he prefers being the underdog, was he supposed to beat Chuck Liddell NO but the did, think he was supposed to beat Forest Griffin NO but he did, is he supposed to beat rampage NO but i think he will cause when hes the underdog 2 out of 3 times hes won,only time he lost when he was not favored was when he lost to Wanderlei Silva, so do i think he has what it takes to beat rampage ABSOLUTELY.|`|yHCAB60Paa	Its just because the violent way in which he has lost. He has gotten destroyed (by two of the worst knockouts in the past 5 years) in two of his last four fights. Jardine is on his way down the latter, while Rampage is going back up.<br>  <br>  I think the winner should fight Machida, but only a Rampage victory will make the fight with Machida for title shot contention.

gI44aIddaa	It's not "allowed" in NHL hockey.  It's a punishable offense, but the penalties in college hockey are more significant.  On your first offense, a fight in college hockey is an automatic one game suspension, as opposed to 5 minutes in the box for NHL fighting majors.  The face cage makes the removal of the helmet a bit tricky but you learn how to rip it off at a young age.  I do think, if the punishment were reduced, fighting would be almost as prevalent in college hockey as it is in the NHL.<br>  <br>  EDIT - how the frick did I get thumbs down for my answer?|`|x7NtYD8Aaa	Would their be more fighting? <br>  probably.<br>  Would they be good fights?<br>  probably not due to the cages and the refs would move in quick.|`|AXwJsjQ2aa	uh yeah that seems pretty obvious|`|Jb5itwHtaa	Do you think on a clear day, the sky would be blue?? Kind of obvious, if you can do something, more people will do it..
Z8UV6S3baa	Ohhh, you've opened a can of worms here. There have been different views of stance, grip, head position, one eye open, both eyes opened, gun angle for literally decades. In fact, what you see above from "Gun - Toting Liberal" is textbook what the military taught for a number of years and may still.<br>  <br>  So, lets try and sort some stuff out:<br>  <br>  1) Stance, there are two basics, the Weaver and Isoceles. (There's also modified Isoceles which is sort of a blend, but we'll leave that for later.) The Weaver stance has your toes lined up similar to if you were shooting a rifle with your strong hand straight out, and your weak hand bent at the elbow. In this stance it is typical to tilt your head slightly to align your eyes to the sight because you need to line your eye up to your arm. Fundamentally, this is a tougher stance to use in your case, because you need to tilt your head more to get your dominant eye in line with the sights. <br>  <br>  The Isoceles is something which you see as much more common in virtually all forms of action pistol shooting. It involves having your feet slightly more than shoulders length apart, and facing the target with squared shoulders. This stance is much easier for a shooter like you to manage, because both of your arms form a more or less equal triangle in the center of your body with the pistol, (thus the term Isoceles) and moving the sight alignment from one eye to the other is trivial and you can do so with your head straight up. This is favored by action shooters because it allows for a strong body position for fast shooting and doesn't favor one side or another in transitioning from target to target.<br>  <br>  2) Eyes - the argument for one eye closed is that it prevents the distraction of your sight picture, which is true. However, when you close one eye, it is virtually impossible for the remaining open eye to stay normally opened. You tend to squint which reduces the light coming into your eye, and slightly compresses your eyeball creating slight optical distortions much like looking at something through a soapbubble that you distort a bit. Keeping both eyes open puts you in the situation where you can distract your sight picture, but this is also why you shoot with your dominant eye. In fact, shooting with your dominant eye virtually doesn't matter UNLESS you shoot with both eyes open. If one eye is closed it doesn't much matter which one.<br>  <br>  3) Grip and hands. Again up until about Jeff Cooper, alot of people taught something called the "Teacup Grip". Which you can see in older movies. Strong hand is holding the gun, weak hand "cups" the bottom of the grip. I don't really know the origin, it may have come from Europe where most semiautos have the mag release at the bottom of the grip and you have to rip the mag out on a reload. However, again, most modern competative shooters use something called a "Crush" grip. Strong hand grips the pistol like normal, but with the thumb up. Weak hand puts the fat part of the palm under the thumb directly on the weak side grip panel as high as possible on the gun. Wrap 4 fingers over 3 and lay thumb over thumb on the weak side of the pistol. This give you much more uniform pressure on the grip surface of the gun improving your left to right stability and reduces the need for a really tight grip with your strong hand. Most say 70% of the strength should be with your weak hand, the rest with your trigger hand. When combined with an Isoceles stance you create a small amount of dynamic tension in your body by pushing with your strong hand, and pulling with your weak hand just enough to give your "triangle" a tight, strong feel. <br>  <br>  Off hand shooting? Well, I definately practice shooting one handed with both of my hands. I also practice shooting right handed two handed (I'm a lefty) just so that I can when teaching someone else, but not for more reason than that. When shooting off handed one handed, I keep my head straight up and down and tilt the pistol just slightly to get the sights aligned with my eyes. This also helps with recoil control.<br>  <br>  Good luck.<br>  <br>  Thinkingblade|`|AA10517492	I to am right handed. I shoot a pistol right handed but use my dominant left eye with no loss in accuracy. It's funny but I shoot a rifle left handed. To find out which eye is dominant, point at something far away with both eyes open. Then close each eye and see where your finger is pointing. Your dominant eye will have your finger pointing right at the far object.|`|7a12de476870e2b442c9dc6e7662bf84aa	Well I'm still right eye dominant but I have practiced shooting "weak hand / eye" my whole life and to be honest I'm better left then right.  I would suggest trying everything/ combination of hands/eyes etc. BUT keep your head level at all times if you can as it helps with bullet placement. I would also say instead of leaning your head, get it into position and bring the gun to your left eye alignment. I do this by placing my left foot forward and quarter my body away from the target while holding right handed as that puts the weapon in front of my left eye. Practice, practice,practice !!!   After awhile you'll be comfortable right or left.  On my hunting and fun handguns I use a red point/dot instead of iron sights anymore, it's much easier as our eyes get older.|`|v6vSrcgvaa	First, make sure you're truly left-eye dominant.  Just do a search and try a couple of the tests.  If you are left-eye dominant, shooting a pistol should still not be a problem (it's much more difficult shooting a rifle with this situation).  You shouldn't contort your head to line up the sights.  A balanced, relaxed stance is necessary to be an effective pistol shooter.  Next, view this video of top pistol shooter Todd Jarett: <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ysa50-plo48." rel="nofollow">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ysa50-plo...</a>  With a correct stance and grip, positioning your left eye in line with the sights is only a matter of moving your hands over a couple inches, and/or possibly SLIGHTLY turning your head towards the right.  Keep both eyes open for self-defense training. Peripheral vision is important if your life is ever on the line, not to mention that the overwhelming majority of shooters in a self-defense situation will focus on the attacker rather than lining up the sights ("point and shoot").  This is true even for trained professionals.  Lastly, practice, practice, practice!  Take lessons at the range or take along an experienced shooter so you have an observer.  It's hard to pick up on your own technique flaws because you can't see them yourself, though dry-firing at home in front of a mirror is possibly the best practice you can get (practiced safely, of course).  Best of luck, and stay safe.|`|wB9b1De9aa	DO NOT TILT YOUR HEAD.  Keep your head straight as you shoot.  Tilting your head throws off your natural point of aim.  Simply bring your dominant hand over so that the pistol is in line with your dominant eye (by this point the inside of your right elbow should be about 2 inches from your chin) with your right arm straight, left hand supporting the right one.  SHOOT WITH YOUR NON DOMINANT EYE CLOSED!  Get (proficiently) comfortable shooting with your dominant hand before trying your week hand; it may take years to get to this point.  Weak hand shooting with a handgun would only be done while shooting from cover when it is more convenient or tactically proficient than using your strong side.  Forget about dual-wielding two pistols; that's just silly (no matter what you may have seen in the movies).<br>  <br>  As far as technique, breathe naturally when you shoot.  Slowly squeeze the trigger (using your entire hand, not just your trigger finger) during the natural respiratory pause in between your exhale and inhale.  Stance: there are several different ways to stand.  I always use the isosales stance with my legs shoulder width apart and parallel to my target.  Lean back slightly at the waist with your shoulders square to the target.  This is a perfect stance for target shooting, and will be (slightly modifed of course) what you would most likely assume during an armed encounter.  Always focus on the front sight tip and do not stare at the target as this will also throw off your aim.
jTaW3goeaa	They enjoy skiing because they can't snowboard.  Snowboarding takes more work than skiing and skiers don't like that.  Thats part of the reason they are so nasty towards snowboarders.  They don't like the fact that snowboarders can do more and that each year there are more and more people snowboarding and less people skiing|`|fwr63lByaa	because everyone has different likes|`|T2UZXarLaa	I would argue that people like skiing more because it is harder to master. Sure boarding is harder to learn but once you have learned it you can do almost anything and its easy to advance your skill.  Skiing on the other hand most people can get down in an afternoon but becoming really good is hard because of all the coordination it takes to distribute weight between skis and what-not.  <br>  <br>  I like snowboarding better but ive heard of a few people who started out skiing tried snowboarding but then eventually went back to skiing because they just didnt feel challenged on a board<br>  <br>  But most people are just afraid of getting hurt snowboarding|`|fVKtG2pRaa	I began snowboarding, but i couldn't do it.  So i changed over to skiing, and got it almost instantly.  With boarding i was on my butt half the time, and i sprained my wrist. I never did figure out how to go toe-side. Skiing has been a lot easier.|`|XoTH3zIwaa	Skiing is just a different feel.  Most people who ski were brought up riding them, and they don't want to change.  I am a boarder but skiing looks sweet, especially in the park.  It's different, many people do both though, so keep your mind open.

Yg1QR4mmaa	Maybe violence but not the most damaging to each other. I believe that the Marquez-Vasquez trilogy were the most physically brutal on the combatants. It was just two guys trying to systematically break each other down and succeeding. Graziano-Zale from what I have seen and read were more of a brawl or fan fight if you will, while the Marquez-Vasquez fights were two guys with one punch power dissecting each other with precision.<br>  <br>  Bowe vs Holyfield 1 was brutal especially the punch to the back of the head from Bowe.<br>  <br>  We can not forget Chacon vs Limon IV either.|`|kqP7GwOcaa	For pure violence, Dempsey was hard to top, his fights with Firpo and Willard are up there with the best of them.  In modern times Hagler/Hearns and Hagler/Mugambi jump out at you almost immediately.  I got to put Ali/Frazier in this mix, the third of their trilogy actually created the concept of a "boxing trilogy" and it was murderous.|`|dh48AkbCaa	the first merqui sosa vs prince charles williams fight in 1995 was stopped in the seventh round and declared a draw, because it was considered too brutal.(i never seen this fight, but i was recently reminded of it looking at an old article which mentioned it).<br>  <br>  ali vs frazier had 2 (out of 3) tough fights, the third was particularly brutal.<br>  <br>  greb vs tunney & robinson vs basilio both come to mind as well, but zale vs graziano is up there with the most brutal.
Yg1QR4mmaa	Interesting fight but I believe that Schmeling was he more technicallly correct fighter of the two.

Julian Jackson gets two on this list, his victims were Graham and Norris.<br>  <br>  4. George Foreman's right hand that got Michael Moorer crowned Big George the oldest heavyweight champ in history, and as a historical achievement, it makes the list.<br>  <br>  5. Mike Weavers bomb against John Tate belongs on the list.<br>  <br>  6-7.  Even though they actually staggered away from them, the shots Thomas Hearns landed against Cuevas and Duran for all intends and purposes ended both of those fights, and they belong on this list.<br>  <br>  8. The left hook Michael Carbajal landed in the first Humberto Gonzales fight to stave off defeat belongs on the list.<br>  <br>  9. Sugar Ray Robinson's left hook that KOed Gene Fullmer certainly has a place on this list, so Ray joins Hearns and Julian Jackson as a two timer.<br>  <br>  10. Mike Tyson's three knock down with one punch shot off Trever Berbeck's temple ends my list.<br>  <br>  I am sure that there are many more deserving punches that I have forgotten, but these came to me first.
8fa17d06395754a44604a2b42063588daa	Quarry takes a decision because Bonavena can't box worth a damn.  He's IRON Tough but Quarry is ornery enough to stick around and "Ping" enough shots of Oscar's "Leno" to score points in the early rounds. <br>  <br>  Quarry runs into trouble as things become a bit too easy for him.  Oscar shakes him in the 7th round but fails to finish him.  Quarry is smart enough to keep a safe distance.  The fact that Bonavena didn't KO him by now sinks in and he realizes to leave the "Tough man" act for some other time and be smart.  This is an easy one.  <br>  <br>  Quarry survives a few scares and takes a unanimous decision.|`|Yg1QR4mmaa	In a ten or twelve round fight I think that Quarry would of taken it, but in a fifteen I can see Bonanvena winning on points. It all depends on whether Quarry fades in the middle rounds like he has in so many fights.

Logic goes with Quarry and so will I.<br>  <br>  My pick is Quarry by UD.|`|dh48AkbCaa	two guys who would dominate today's scene in their respective primes.<br>  <br>  these guys fought the best (and the greatest) of their day, but i think quarry just about shades this one.|`|Ghiy6Cwlaa	Bonavena in 15 round split  decision|`|kqP7GwOcaa	Quarry would have taken Oscar, Jerry was a far better schooled fighter with much better power.

kqP7GwOcaa	Agreed, Valdez was out classed by both Moore and Rock.  Marciano would have KOed Valdez inside 10 rounds.
PIu1ZcYEaa	The most brutal beating, for me, would have to be the Jack dempsey vs. Jess Willard Bout. Jess was knocked down 7 times in the FIRST round.And from there was beaten from ring post to post. Dempsey's back was covered with Willard's blood. Those in the crowed were even yelling for the fight to be stopped.( But Jess bravely told the referee no.) After the bout Jess sustained a shattered jaw (Broken in several places.) Missing teeth, broken nose (Completely smashed.) Broken cheek bone, fractured eye socket, smashed lips and broken ribs.THIS was a brutal beating.  Never again will there be a beating this bad with our modern rules and careful watching over fighters in a match. A large part in Willard's severe beating was the fact the neutral corner rule and standing count wasnt in effect at that time. Another part in Jess's beating was a fierce and very savage Dempsey. In fact, I think you could just about match any of histories greatest Heavyweights with the Toledo Jack that day and they would all find themselves in a brutal do-or-die battle.<br>  Honorable mention - Gene Tunney vs. Harry Greb #1 - Tunney suffered a severe mauling and beating. Some of the newspaper descrptions of the day of Tunney 'Looked like meat through a grinder". 'Looked as if he had been in on the wrong end of a lost knife fight'. Gene himself said he was banged and cut up beyond belief and had lost a large amount of blood. If I remember right I believe Gene went to the hospital right afterwards and remained in bed for several days.|`|Yg1QR4mmaa	Joe Louis's fight with Two Ton Galento comes to mind, and both of his fights with Schmeling.<br>  <br>  Liston's desctructions of Floyd Patterson and Chuck Wepner.<br>  <br>  Ali's fight with Terrel.<br>  <br>  Ken Norton and Joe Frazier both delivered horrific beatings to Jerry Quarry.<br>  <br>  Tommy Morrison's fight with Joe Hipp.<br>  <br>  All of Joe Grimm's fights at heavyweight, he was a fighter who would be considered less then a tomato can, but his chin was above world class and his manager and handlers used that fact as a money maker.|`|ZpShIvylaa	When Rocky Marciano beat Joe Louis.

This was as brutal a beating as it gets. Tyrell and Mike hated each other in the amateurs and couldn't wait to get at each other in the pros. But Tyrell, although a decorated amateur boxer, was no match for Tyson in this fight. It was brutally one-sided after the first round. By round seven, Biggs bleeding and staggered was knocked down twice in the closing seconds before the fight was stopped. Watching this fight it was obvious Tyson was carrying Biggs and administered an extra dose of punishment. Truth be told, he was torturing Biggs in this fight. Tyson admitted he wanted Biggs to remember this night and he did. After this fight, Biggs was reduced to trialhorse status in the Heavyweight division. That fight ended his career as a top-tier heavyweight contender. <br>  <br>  A close second is Muhammad Ali vs. Ernie Terrell. Ernie kept calling Ali his "slave name" Cassius Clay which angered Ali so Ali just simply pummeled him over the course of fifteen rounds. Terrell did the best as he could but he was outmatched and outgunned. Even in rounds eight and nine he added to the humiliation by calling Terrell, "What's my name? What's my name?" Unlike the Floyd Patterson fight, Ali seemed intent on trying to stop Terrell but Terrell stayed the whole fifteen rounds. It was a prolonged vicious beating.|`|NG6eeCfuaa	Randall "Tex" Cobb getting worked over by Larry Holmes for 15 rounds.

kqP7GwOcaa	Man, I always wondered about this one, if ever there was a fight between two forces of nature, it's this match up.  I always figured LaMotta would have been too strong for most middleweights, and Basilio was really a welterweight who out grew the division with age, so Jake would have been a slight favorite.  Still Carmen would have made this one one of the greatest middleweight show downs in history.  If you could picture Hagler/Hearns like action for 15 straight rounds you get the picture because neither of these guys really knew how to back up, it would have been epic.<br>  <br>  A 15 rounds blood bath that ends in a majority decision draw.

In the 147-160 range, during that or any other time,   there might not be two more similar fighters.  Both Jake and Carmen are pressure fighters with great stamina and above average power.<br>  <br>  Neither boxes well so there would be no search.  Carmen has a good chin.  Jake has a better one.  Carmen can punch.  Jake can punch a bit harder.  Carmen can take it to the body.  Jake can take a little more.<br>  <br>  See where this is going.  I don't see anything Carmen can do that Jake Lamotta can't do better.  It's all a matter of numbers and time.

He would jab his way in, and flurry. People have this misconception that Basilio was just a brawler and he wasn't. He was good at slipping punches and he was hard to hit clean. La Motta's defense was his chin and you don't win fights just by walking through punches. I also don't think La Motta has the handspeed or the workrate to really put Carmen on the defensive either. <br>  <br>  My pick is Basilio by close, clear UD.|`|dh48AkbCaa	this could be an out and out brawl, similar to the second basilio vs saxton fight, (ring magazine's fight of the year 1956), and basilio i believe would get the better of jake, taking a close decision over the bronx bull.|`|Ghiy6Cwlaa	a bloody mess to great fighters with with a sharp shooter in the upper deck with is gun on the ref if he tried to stop it lol in there prime great fight 6 rounds to 5 4 even for jake lamotta with both rushed to the hospital
8fa17d06395754a44604a2b42063588daa	There is no doubt in my mind that Lennox Lewis wins easier than the first time.  As a boxer, Lennox, like Larry Holmes, has it all.  There are some things he doesn't do as well as others.  He's not as fast as Ali or as powerful as Forman but he can compensate for whatever he might lack as a fighter.<br>  <br>  The one thing that has been consistant about Lewis is that he improves after any sub-par performance.  People like to make light of Klitschko's performance.  Lennox' greatest weakness is that he sometimes does not take certain opponents seriously. <br>  <br>  Another thing to remember is that Lennox wasn't even originally supposed to fight Klitschko.  There were so many issues leading up to that fight.  Lennox was not in the best of shape, just as in the fight with Rahman.  <br>  <br>  True, his performance wasn't very good in the Klitschko fight.  However, there is no doubt in my mind that Lennox improves the next time around.  Klitschko can not improve in any way.  He was at his best and gave a good account of himself.  But Lennox was not at his best and he's a proud enough fighter to learn from his mistake and improve the next time.  <br>  <br>  The McCall rematch doesn't tell much except that Lennox knew what he needed to do to win.  However, the Rahman rematch was one of Lennox' best performances.  THAT is the Lennox Lewis I would put against any heavyweight.  <br>  <br>  I hate to say this but many Americans are still reluctant to give Lennox his due credit.  I can't count the number of times I have heard comments about his heritage or lifestyle or even the way he speaks.  That has NOTHING to do with what he does in the ring. <br>  <br>  I give only Larry Holmes and Muhammad ALI the best chance over a Prime Lennox Lewis.  Even the Immortal Joe Louis is about 50/50 at best by my estimation.  I just don't see any way the others can beat Lewis at his best.<br>  <br>  Vitali Klitschko is Certainly NOT the man to beat Lennox Lewis.<br>  <br>  Lewis by KO in 5<br>  <br>  and this time with no cuts.

I remember watching it and noting that Lewis had only enough juice to fight a good 30 seconds each round.  But as each round came and went, Klits was slowing down and Lewis was still able to sputter out 30 good seconds per round.<br>  <br>  What I'm saying is that Lewis would have been able to better control the fight as he'd be ready for Klits the second time, and would repeat the first performance, but in a much more solid fashion.|`|dh48AkbCaa	if lewis was confident of beating vitali again, he probably would have fought him again,personally i think lewis would have had enough left to win a rematch,  but it's really a pick 'em.|`|kqP7GwOcaa	Lewis wouldn't have bothered to try and out box him the second time, Lennox would have came in with both guns blazing and KOed Vitali within a round or two in the rematch.|`|Fx2lB9LYaa	lewis

CgMyTpwGaa	well, batsmen don't wear helmets because they're facing a slower bowler. generally if the batsmen know that their going to face spinners for quite a few overs then they won't wear a helmet. but its still risky because of the unpredictable bounce or a miss timed sweep, which will hit your face.|`|fsLMFIpgaa	Facing a quick he would be crazy, but slow bowlers would be reasonably safe enough to leave your helmet off.|`|Qq2MKeXUaa	They never use to wear helmets.  I guess if I was facing Brett Lee, I'd be wearing the padding that they use in American football and some.|`|R0NfdgzLaa	i bat without a helmet, but i'm not facing anyone as fast as brett lee.  i've never batted with one and i don't see any reason to start now.  if i do have to face a real fast bowler, i just don't play anything from in front of my face, but i'm pretty tall so usually i can pick bouncers off my shoulder.<br>  <br>  you get what you give, so if anyone wants to bounce me, they're gonna cop some chin music when they're batting too.|`|aN4SUKkRaa	I'd go the crease wearing a helmet and after facing a few deliveries or so, I'd take it off!! That used to really get the bowler pissed off!! He'd start bowling shorter and going for the bouncer. Then the umpire would step in and give him the "warning". Our comp had a unwritten rule that you wouldn't try to bounce the tailenders!! I was a specialist batsman -- a "ferret" -- which meant I went in after the "bunnies"!!<br>  <br>  Also I could bowl a more than useful bouncer myself in return!!|`|8T0Z0Y17aa	If the bowling you are facing isn't quick and the pitch isn't bouncing then I'm sure a lot of people would.<br>  <br>  It's probably more comfortable and you have slightly less weight to carry - slightly quicker between the wickets (A fraction of a sceond can make all the difference on some run outs. I say probably, because I'm 16, so I not permitted to not use one yet under ECB guidelines. I think it's 18 (possibly 16.

Gua2EEWraa	A goal keeper needs good agility to get down to shots and to reach the shots by diving. So a good practice skill is to get some cones or somthing and put them either side of ya and get a friend to keep kick the ball to the cones alternately with a bit of pace and keep diving to each cone. Make sure you do it quickly so as soon as he has kicked it once get back up as soon as ya and get down to another. So tell your friend to do really quick. The more you do it the more agile you will become.<br>  <br>  Obviously ya need to practice your kicking, catching and throwing as well. So get a friend to stand quite far away(unless you wanna keep fetchin it yourself) and just keep kicking it as far as you can and eventually you will pick up your own technique. If you wanna throw if far make sure you do it over arm and do a big swing to get more power. With the catching get a friend to stand a few yards aways from ya and keep dropkicking to each side of you for you to catch it and make sure you grip it firmly each time.<br>  <br>  During the game always keep on your toes and if you get a one on one close him down as quickly as possible. The closer you get to him, the less of the goal he can see therefore most of the time the ball will just go straight at ya.<br>  <br>  Dont lose concentration and have a jolly good game dude.|`|KhkEl9c4aa	Reflexs catching and kicking then u will be an amazing keeper <br>  hopes this helps and good luck|`|uXXbegw5aa	Practice throwing and catching a ball :P|`|wurimjbnaa	Well you need to dive when the ball is shot, you as a goal keeper must always come out towards the player when it's 1 on 1 to reduce chances of the person scoring. <br>  <br>  When kicking the ball from the goal kick always lift your leg up to give the ball an upthrust, producing: height, distance and power.<br>  <br>  Practise catching the ball with a friend, then move on to shooting and you must catch the ball from a weak shot. Then you need to throw the ball, keepers can throw it further by doing an overarm throw, this is effective and you must use full power when doing it.<br>  <br>  I Hope this helps.
jSkHquK5aa	Goalkeepers are the last line of defence in a game of soccer. Good goalkeeping can save a team many times so it is important to have a decent keeper.<br>  <br>  Speed, agility, lightning reactions and excellent handling skills are some of the obvious qualities required to be a good goalkeeper. There is much more to the art, however, goalkeepers have to be brave and be prepared to go for the ball with striker running towards you. <br>  <br>  <br>  The best keepers dominate their penalty area, both physically and with a powerful set of lungs! A powerful, decisive keeper makes defenders lives much easier. In soccer matchs, goalkeepers are often seen shouting at team-mates. This is crucial, as they are in the best position to spot any danger signs early. <br>  <br>  Commanding goalkeepers must give confidence to the outfield players, and strong defences are built on confidence, just as technical ability and good positional play. The other quality keepers must have is concentration. <br>  <br>  Goalkeepers may have nothing to do for long periods, then find themselves facing a high-pressure one-on-one situation. It is important for keepers to stay focused on the game at all times. <br>  <br>  Goalkeeping takes lots of practice to perfect, just like any other skill.<br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  Shot Stopping<br>  Goalkeepers must try to get as much of their body behind the ball as possible. It is better to use two hands than one. Of course, it isn't always possible to get your body behind the ball, so it is important to try and get something behind the ball, be it your hand, fingertips or even out-stretched leg. Even the slightest touch can change the direction of a shot to prevent a goal. <br>  <br>  Shots along the ground<br>  For shots along the ground, most keepers drop to their knees and scoop the ball up with two hands. Others bend their back and stoop to take the ball. Depending on what you prefer, it is a matter of indivudual preference. Although it is safer to use the former when pitch conditions are bumpy or poor. Low shots along the ground are some of the hardest shots to save. It is vital to try and get low to the ground as fast as possible. <br>  <br>  Low Shots<br>  For shots between knee and waist height, get the body behind the ball and use the scooping technique to bring it into the chest. If the shot is low, the body will naturallt topple forward, but the ball will be safely cupped to the chest before you hit the ground.<br>  <br>  Shots at chest height<br>  Goalkeeping made easy. These are bread-and-butter saves, they are going exactly where you want it. Two techniques are commonly used. One is to cup your hands around the ball as it hits your chest. The body should yeild on impact to provide a cushioned surface and help the ball stick. However, the danger with this technique is that the ball may rebound off the chest before the goalkeeper can clutch onto it. For that reason, some keepers prefer to catch the ball out in front of the body. Here, the fingers are spread and pointing upwards.|`|5tAmSY3baa	here is a piece of advice from Brianna Scurry, former USA goalie, as published in Mia Hamm's book.<br>  <br>  Courage in goalkeeping is so important. Many aspects of the position require that you stick your head into places that most people wouldn't dare. Sometimes you get kicked in place any sane person definately wouldn't want to get kicked in, but that's just part of the job.<br>  You have to play every game with confidence, and that confidence has to be real, and it has to be evident to those playing with you and against you. You must have an aura about you that says, "Things are under control in MY penalty box." All your catches must be solid, you must never be indecisive, and you must always rule the air! All good goalkeepers have this presence in the nets.<br>  But no doubt, to be a good keeper, you must be willing to work at it and work hard. Goalkeeper training is physically demanding and very fatiguing. You are constantly hitting the ground, getting back up, and diving again. You must be one of the fittest players on the team. Your training is a bit different from that of the other players, as it is more anaerobic than aerobic, but goalkeepers should take pride in working harder than everyone else. You must still try to be a good long distance runner like your field player teammates. Goalkeeping can also be painful, especially when you have Mia Hamm and Michelle Akers shooting at you mercilessly from 12 yards away.<br>  If you get scored on-and every goalkeeper does- you must have the mentality to bounce back right away. Some goalkeepers lose their composure after they let a goal in, but the great ones shake it off because that next save might be the one that wins the game for your team. If you dwell on your mistakes, another ball will be whizzing past your ear before you know it.<br>  Finally, as a goalkeeper, you must take pride in your responsibility to the team as the last defender. Your team must know that they can depend on you. Even on the National team there are defensive breakdowns, and when the shots do come, your teammates need to know that you will be there to bail them out.<br>  That kind of respect is not given. You have to earn it. The harder you fight for the team, the more defensively they will battle for you.<br>  <br>  <br>  And from my side just remember this...<br>  <br>  you have to kick the ball with the right technique. It is -upper body leaning backwards, non kicking foot next to the ball, knees bent, backlift of the kicking foot, striking the ball upwards at the bottom of the ball, and following through. The key is to practise hard.<br>  __________________
MxfjoVrMaa	Use the laces on your boots to get more power on it, but to make the goal kick more accurate, then use the inside of your foot. Just a little tip, dig a bit of a hole in the ground with your studs, then place the ball just in front of the hole that you have dug, so that when you run up to the ball, you can put your foot in the hole and bring your foot up under the ball. This will help get height on the ball.|`|9GpIvHknaa	to kick a well controlled, impacted goal kick, you should point your foot down, run up to it from behind and chop at it and follow through completely.  if you watch the keepers in the professional games you will notice that there planting foot is usually a foot away from the ball.  if you do this kick correctly (also known as a driven cross) the ball should have down spin and fly straight. good luck mate|`|09SjyOHkaa	hit with the laces an specifically the part along the foot with that hard strong bone|`|79b2yM3saa	I use my laces, and strike under the ball to get it high.<br>  I occasionly use the inside of my foot thou, it depends if the coach wants the ball in short or long.

Glee and heartbreak will once again prevail, perhaps in equal parts, as coaches and players struggle to organize competitive youth soccer teams.<br>  <br>  Because of the growth of the sport in teams and players, the great majority of coaches who will be selecting youth teams never played soccer in their youth, never took part in a soccer tryout, and don't have enough experience in team management to recognize many common tryout perils. Similarly, most players and parents are driven to tryouts by misguided motivations that arise partly because of the lack of a long cultural history in the sport. <br>  <br>  These players and parents look to their youth experience with other sports and subconsciously use the behavior of coaches, players in these sports as a model.<br>  <br>  Despite their best efforts, coaches will make tryout mistakes that will handicap their newly assembled teams for months or years to come. Similarly, many players and parents will fall into tryout traps that will provide at least a year of regret and, in some cases, lasting difficulty in the game. <br>  <br>  We explore here some common myths about tryouts, and then look at fourteen ways to fail as a coach at tryouts, and how to learn from these failures. We conclude with a practical plan for clearing out problem players before tryouts begin. <br>  Tryout Facts and Fiction <br>  <br>  There are many common beliefs about tryouts that are simply wrong.<br>  <br>  Fiction: The purpose of tryouts is to find the most competitive players.<br>  <br>  Fact: A series of successful tryouts actually sort out the players and<br>  teams so that players are lined up with teams with other players of similar<br>  skills, similar competitiveness, and a similar commitment to training.<br>  <br>  Fiction: Coaches can easily recognize all the best players.<br>  <br>  Fact: Many youth coaches do not have sufficient experience to reliably distinguish between players with slightly varying ability levels. Many do not quickly recognize promising project players, or overlook gifted players who have crucial abilities to read the game or make clever attacking passes. It is too easy to overlook such players in favor of larger and faster players, or players who use the ball a great deal.<br>  <br>  Fiction: The best players are selected.<br>  <br>  Fact: An assortment of the best and not-so-best players are selected.<br>  <br>  Fiction: Many players got their position through politics.<br>  <br>  Fact: A few players get their position through politics. The coach's daughter, the board member's son, these are common. In some cases average players make a better team because they provide transportation for the star player who has no ride to practice and matches. It happens.<br>  <br>  Fiction: Good teams don't have vacancies.<br>  <br>  Fact: Healthy teams change a few players each year. Job relocations, injury, and commitments to other sports take a few players away every year, even from the best teams.<br>  <br>  Fiction: Coaches will always want the star players.<br>  <br>  Fact: Some star players have nightmare parents who are never happy and who annoy and disturb most of the other team parents. Better coaches avoid these "stars" for the sake of protecting team chemistry.<br>  <br>  Fiction: Players who aren't on the best teams by U14 will never make it.<br>  <br>  Fact: U16 is more like it. Many U14 stars disappear by U18. Some who depended on athleticism are passed by those who develop skill and tactical speed. Others fall to injury, bad home situations, and interest in other activities.<br>  <br>  Fiction: There is nothing that a player can do to improve at tryouts.<br>  <br>  Fact: There are many effective steps to follow in preparing for a tryout. See How to win friends and influence coaches at ODP tryouts. All other things equal, better skilled and more athletic players do better at tryouts.<br>  <br>  Fiction: The best players should try out for the best team.<br>  <br>  Fact: Below U17, it is more important to get excellent training than to be on the best team. Parents and players should seek out the very finest trainers available, even if the trainers don't yet have killer teams. Many early "killer teams" are built by enthusiastic parent coaches with limited training ability but great organizational and recruiting ability. These teams fade away during the high school years, overshadowed by teams that gained their playing ability through extensive training and player development.|`|lhTYZ3dWaa	the best thing you can do is be a team player.. thats wat a coach looks for in tryouts.. make sure you give alot of pases and when you dont dont stand around move to an open space for a give and go... also be loud make sure you a heard talk to the other players.. but the main thing dont walk jog to an open space..<br>  best of luck<br>  :)|`|09SjyOHkaa	dont eat fast food!!|`|WbUrwR2Haa	Do not overwork 2 days before tryouts.

5VSAuCwiaa	I don't think he has, all the - in my opinion - good  decisions have been taken by Max and the FOTA lately. Bernie seems to be falling deeper and deeper into senility. He keeps pushing for his Rome street GP while Max and Luca beg for a real italian circuit to be used. He's pretty good at keeping his business profitable but sooner or later he will have to be replaced. Even the FOTA has great ideas about how to improve the TV show with the racing lines and GPS positioning and Max has commented on how little F1 makes use of the internet. Shouldn't Bernie be the one who comes up with this stuff?|`|KTxxd700aa	Well its do or die really.<br>  If the manufactures pull out of F1, there will be no F1.

Well the good tracks are slowly going, less engine variety, the hope of KERS helping overtaking is slim at best, the slick tyres and limited aero will undoubtedly spice up close racing scenarios but overtakes will only happen on overtaking lenient tracks, as always. there's been whinges of limited overtaking from casual fans for as long as I can remember, 16 years and though I'm expecting a few more, its not going to turn into single seater touring cars!<br>  If Bernie gets his medals, I'm sure there will be a little  bling ...|`|wBzv5awkaa	the viewing public will see benefits from Bernie when they/we are all multi millionaires. til then he doesn't care much about us peasants!!!|`|c09e1f232acd578a9f591c5b83a68f43aa	Maybe he's been visited by the ghost of Christmas future...|`|d720cd234b26aec0b10b06cc2d725085aa	Maybe he's due a reallity check and his wife might be about to give him one.

Few punch's have landed harder than some of the shots Earnie used to throw, but almost no heavyweight in history, including the all time greats hit as hard or with the impact of Earnie Shavers.<br>  <br>  My vote goes to the "Acorn"|`|4d7b908cfe24bf3f1177a5cca13feb22aa	Shavers had the all-time strongest single punch.  I think the PSI was measured, and it was some ridiculous number.  I also think his hitting power was so good that he neglected the other aspects of boxing because he didn't really need them.
kqP7GwOcaa	Thumbs up to Maurice, I too have it Tua, Morrison then Cooney.  If all three of them landed three shots to the chin of a fighter, the combined efforts of the trio wouldn't equal the damage of one clean left hook from Joe Frazier, but without a doubt Tua was the best of the three you named.|`|NG6eeCfuaa	1) Tyson's short, inside left hook<br>  2) Joe Lewis's bomb of a left hook<br>  3) Prince Naseem Hahmed<br>  56) Cooney<br>  104) Tua<br>  368) Morrison|`|PIu1ZcYEaa	1. Gerry Cooney - Out of of 28 wins, 24 were by ko (Left-hook) Cooney beat Jimmy young, Ron Lyle (Broke Lyle's ribs.) and Ken Norton (54 secs. of 1st. round.) all by ko. Ron Lyle, Larry Holmes George Foreman, etc. all said Gerrys blows (Left-hook.) were the hardest they had ever taken. Keep in mind Larry's statement was made (Of Cooney) after he had already fought the very hard hitting Earnie Shavers. And Big George had faced some strong hitters, even the great left-hooker Joe Frazier, yet still felt Gerry's was the most brutal he had encountered.<br>  2.David Tua  - A close second behind Cooney When considering just the left-hook, but better overall power.<br>  3. Tommy Morrison - Very strong left-hook. I think Tommys left-hook, while not quite as powerful as Cooney's or Tua's, was however much quicker and more textbook.|`|d61511600922f016b452fc8b39ab7408aa	Cooney<br>  Tua<br>  Morrison|`|dh48AkbCaa	tua<br>  morrisson<br>  cooney|`|Fx2lB9LYaa	BUM BUM AND BUM

Well done!<br>  <br>  I heard something a while back that Graham Henry, current NZ coach, once said that the most passionate rugby supporters he has ever came across, are the Welsh.

Ireland Beat France but Ireland wouldn't have got the ball off the french team we played..there are many  many things that make a team put in a incredible performance and win on the day.

Make no mistake though - this sevens win will be a massive shot in the arm to the six nations team.|`|0LUBf2Juaa	I'm quite happy that Wales will go on to be Six Nations champions once again.

I think that they can help a swimmer have a mindset of going faster which may make the most difference. My team high school suit this year was a Speedo Aquablade and it was a pretty good suit. They do fit very tight and do help compress your body. I was a little nervous at first because the fabric is very thin, but mine has held up through about 16 meets like my coach said it would be good for (it's still an okay suit, but it doesn't fit quite like it used to since it has stretched out).|`|ybzMow2zaa	NO. If you think that they are a waste of money then you are wrong.<br>  If you do your research then you will able be buy an excellent pair.|`|fHJqqMzLaa	I personally think it depends on what type of swimming you do and the environment in which you swim.<br>  <br>  Nylon or Lycra skins like the ones in the following link<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.visibilityunlimited.com/page/scuba/CTGY/Rash-Guards-and-Lycra-Suits" rel="nofollow">http://www.visibilityunlimited.com/page/...</a><br>   offer little to no thermal insulation so they would be a waste in indoor heated pool swimming.  In outdoor pools and swimming in lakes, ponds, quarries etc.  They would offer protection against UV rays that cause sunburn,  In the ocean they would also afford you protection should you come into contact with jellyfish or stinging corals.  These need skin to skin contact and the lycra acts as a barrier.<br>  Because the lycra and Nylon skins do not add thermal protection, their use would be limited to recreational swimming and/ snorkeling and scuba diving in warmer waters.<br>  <br>  The other types of skins  like the ones in the following link<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.love2splash.com/category/12057806741/1/Lycra-Neoprene.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.love2splash.com/category/1205...</a><br>  <br>  offer the same benefits of the lycra/nylon skins (UV protection and barrier against jellyfish and corals) but add a measure of thermal insulation.  Thermal insulation is important because the body loses heat, in water, 20 to 25 times faster than it does in an air environment.<br>  The suits use what is called a closed cell material such as neoprene rubber which does not allow the was to penetrate the material itself.  The idea is to trap a small layer of water between you and the suit and rather than your body trying to heat up  the entire pool, lake or ocean, it just heats up that thin layer.  You will still lose heat but it is at a slower rate than the heat loss of a person not wearing it.  This makes iit ideal for both indoor and outdoor environments.  This thermal insulation also allows for swimming in cooler waters.  The neoprene skins come in different thicknesses which are governed by the water temperature.  The colder the water, the thicker the suit.  Fitness, competative and triathlon swimmers will benefit more from these suits as will snorkelers and scuba divers.  The common thicknesses include .5 millimeter (mm), 1 mm, 2mm, 3mm, 5mm and 7mm.  Swimmers should not have to go any thicker than a 3mm suit unless you are planning to swim in water that is colder than 68 degrees (too cold for me).  The thicker suits are more for scuba divers.  I teach scuba diving (for <a href="http://www.visibilityunlimited.com" rel="nofollow">http://www.visibilityunlimited.com</a> if interested) and tend to be in and under water for very long stretches of time (sometiesd 3 to 4 hours during a pool session) so a neoprene suit is what I rely on to allow me the opportunity to be comfortable temperaturewise.<br>  <br>  I should also mention that you lose 75% of your body heat through your head and that they even make thin hoods that can be worn to slow down this heat loss.<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.love2splash.com/category/12057806741/1/Lycra-Neoprene.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.love2splash.com/category/1205...</a><br>  <br>  As far as what I like/dislike about skins in general.<br>  The older model suits made of the neoprene had a flexibility issue which made doing swim strokes less efficient.  This has changed over the last 15 years though as the manufacturerers ar using more flexible rubbers these days.  Had they not been made in the stretchier material,  I guess flexibility would have been my only complaint.|`|pXhoYvzkaa	umm they are pretty expensive and you can only wear them a couple of times but they work great,
jSkHquK5aa	Soccer heading is a skill that shouldnt be ignore. Soccer players should spend a certain amount of time practicing this. Soccer is a game often played along the ground but sometimes a high ball is the option that some players might choose. Once the ball is in the air, both teams will want to challenge for it. If you wait for the ball to drop, you run the risk of losing possession, or even maybe conceding a goal. Heading is a skill that can win and lose games. A defensive header should be used to clear high balls from crosses or corners. <br>  <br>  Heading doesn't come naturally, it takes practice just like any other skill. Most people, including myself, go into self-preservation made when we see an object hurling towards our faces. This defensive reaction causes us to close our eyes and turn away - the very things you shouldn't do!<br>  <br>  There are 4 main points to keep in mind when heading the ball:<br>  <br>  Use the forehead. This is a relatively flat surface and will make controlling the direction of the header easier. The skull is also thickest here. Even a ball coming at pace will not hurt. Finally, because the ball will be coming towards your forehead, you will be able to watch the ball right upto the moment of impact. <br>  <br>  Try not to head the ball with the very top of your head. This can be very painful and cause you to be dazed.<br>  <br>  Keep your eyes open. Many still photographes show that even the professionals close their eyes at the precise moment of contact between ball and head. This is quiet normal. Try to keep your eyes on the ball for as long as possible. <br>  <br>  Attack the ball. Meet the ball, dont just let the ball hit you. if you wait for the ball to come to you, it is likely that it wil be intercepted. Be positive and don't be scared of the ball. <br>  <br>  Arch your back and nob our head. Most of the times, you will want to try and get maximum power into a header. By arching your back and snapping forward at the point of contact, you will give your head forward momentum when it meets the ball. Even more power is ger=nerated if you use your neck mosucles to punch through the ball at the same time. <br>  <br>  Try to keep in mind all these 4 points when heading a ball. It is best to have someone throw you the ball lightly and practice heading the ball at a slow pace. Then gradually as you get better, add more pace. When you think you are ready, practice heading for goal . It is harder to head a ball when there are defenders in the box.|`|nJ5kceMBaa	As a centre back, heading is a big part of my game too. It's a daunting sight when you have the ball, 30 feet in the air, flying towards you and you're expected to head it. But the only way to overcome your fear is to put it into practice. Get somebody to volley a ball towards you, and just practice heading it out. It's much easier to focus on your header in a relaxed environment where all you have to concentrate on is the ball. Once you've started successfully heading it, you'll suddenly become an awful lot more confident, and you'll then be able to bring it into a game situation. That's the way everybody learns and conquers their fears - by practicing and realising how easy things are. I've been doing this practice since about the age of seven, and that's why I'm so confident and comfortable with the skill now.<br>  <br>  Good luck.|`|0dyIrY8Gaa	i have the same issue, im 13 and have been playing since i was 5,  and i just hate heading the ball off a punt. Im gonna try out for the high school team next year, and i just plan to practice a lot and work on like, heading it from a further and further away throw/kick. practice makes perfect i guess (:|`|JRqTrv3Qaa	haha, well, the best advice  can give you is, if you really want it, you have to go and get it.  Think of it as a short header. I don't head much, but i like helping people out.  The reason your stopping is because your afraid you might hit it in the wrong area, or at least that would be logical. if it hits you on top of your head, possibility you can get a concussion, you can also break your nose, and also, if you've ever had the ball kicked in your face.  That's the reason i don;t head balls.  Just face your fears!!|`|7BIiofbaaa	I agree with el nino here. You have to be strong and have confidence as you're going to the ball. I've had (and sometimes still have) the same problem. You just gotta go after the ball and have confidence. Like he said, you have to head the ball; don't let the ball head you.|`|k9PT5kfhaa	dont let the ball head you, head the ball<br>  thats what my manager used to tell me, it works and doesn't hurt|`|UAETk7DWaa	ive always had problems heading the ball and ive been playing since i was 6 and im now 15. Ive also played at academy level, so it goes to show no matter what level you play at or how long you've been playing for you can still have problems with heading the ball, my coach told me:<br>  <br>  if you let the ball land on your head then it will hurt, because you have no control of where it is going to hit your head, but if you head the ball then you are in control and you are positioning the ball in the correct position on your head so it doesn't hurt. aim to get the ball right in the middle of your forehead, and attack the ball don't let it drop on your head. position your body while the ball is coming towards you and compose yourself, try not to close your eyes, stay focused and just go for it. you control the ball it does not control you.<br>  <br>  what i did was get someone to throw or kick the ball to me and i head it back, then build the height speed and distance that the ball is thrown/kicked and this should build up your confidence with heading the ball so next time your playing a match and it comes to punts from the other teams goalie you should be able to go for it.<br>  <br>  good luck. hope i helped.<br>  :)

yqx9YTBJaa	First off, he's a guy so he's probably going to laugh at you.  Or smack you on the butt.<br>  <br>  If you're talking about a rapist or something, the fact is you stand very little chance.  The answer to your question is to pull your pistol and shoot him before he gets within arm's reach.<br>  <br>  Any of that other feel-good crap is just going to get you killed.  Punching him with your keys between your fingers, clawing desperately at his eyes, doing cardio-kickboxing dances in front of him...that might stop him if he dies of embarrassment.|`|HlD9dRF2aa	Jeez, the obvious answers are so VERY VERY WRONG.  Why would you ask Girls only?  Ask someone that actually has experience in fights with a Strong man but has a significant size disadvantage.<br>  For example, ask a guy that's 5'4" and 125lbs (that's me) how he would take down someone 6'4, 230lbs.<br>  <br>  Grab his pinky or the finger next to it, if you can--BREAK IT, twist and don't let go. Make it feel like you're about to rip it off if he makes any move, squeeze and walk him over to the nearest law enforcement.  Make sure to keep the pain intense enough for him to realize you're not bluffing.<br>  <br>  Ripp off ears, gougle eyes--do a Hannibal Lecter and chew off his lip if he attempts to kiss you--If get lucky and manage to bite off part of his tongue it will swell and he will have a lot of trouble breathing and choking on his blood. <br>  <br>  Another NASTY move is GRAB his nuts and dig in, even through jeans you should be able to find some purchase--then pick a direction and start running--without letting go.  The primary rule is NEVER STOP FIGHTING.<br>  <br>  And during the summer, poolside-- Take lifeguard certification training--remarkably useful in subduing someone twice your size in the water. Push/pull them into a pool, lock your legs around his waist from behind, choke from behind, squeeze and pull him under till he stops struggling.  You should be able to hold your breath at least 30 seconds longer than the amount of time it takes him to go limp--considering you'll be using him as a flotation device.  You are under no obligation to perform CPR.  I watched a 102lb lifeguard nearly drown a drunken 210lb a**hole at her sister's pool party.  It was very--educational.<br>  <br>  Peace|`|9pDEhA1Xaa	You have got to be kidding!<br>  Why in the world would you WANT to fight a man!<br>  What jerk would agree to fight a woman!<br>  <br>  I'd find the nearest exit,...& try to out-run him!|`|jtvrSod4aa	kick him in the nuts then he should either be unconcious or on the ground when that happens he's helpless so take advantage by using any available legal weapon.

xOReEw6Waa	6.5x55 Swede would be a minimum for me; most moose and similar sized game in Europe are taken with the 6.5 and it does a good job. 270 Win would be similar enough to use as an elk rifle too. <br>  Cartridge selection from 6.5 to .375  isn't as important in hunting elk as good shot placement and bullet selection. I would find a rifle I'm very comfortable with, like my 30-06, and know where it shoots from 100 out to 400 yards. Even with elk and a great shot, 400 yards is a stretch. I've been close enough to slap cow elk walking by before. I use a quality Bonded construction bullet at 165 grains, could use anything from 140 to 200 plus depending on rifle and bullet choice too. Just make sure you have a bullet with a controlled expansion and you will be fine on most shots. The problem with all hunting shots is when to shoot and when to pass up the shot. If you can find a copy of "The Perfect Shot" for N. American game or even the African one at a library that would be a good resource. Elk have a kill zone the size of an 5 gallon ice chest broadside to you, but that area gets pretty small pretty fast with a quartering shot. Below are links with Game-Cartridge applications to help out.|`|h2KkiKK3aa	minimum? .260 remington, heard really good things about it, no complaints at all about hunting elk with it.|`|6KaMW1Vzaa	I have your Swede, and even a 6.5x68 barrel for my switch-barrel rifle (the other barrel is 8x68, and that's my primary elk rifle). But I wouldn't use the little thing, even with its tremendous penetrating ability, on an elk hunt myself. It's a corollary to my deer experience, where I used 6mm for twenty years but now use it only for varminting. I'd feel fine using 7x64 or 280 Remington. Maybe if I gain more experience with my 270 WSM I'll feel better about it, but we do have to draw the line someplace, don't we?|`|3b8557f01cef58611c2e78e57d57b1e5aa	According to the Winchester Product Ballistics Service Manual they recommend nothing less than a 30-30 caliber for Elk.* However I prefer the 30-06 myself.* Magnum Calibers are not needed or necessary to harvest Elk.* Elk can be Harvested with a 55Lb Bow and Arrow also.*|`|It2jlZXmaa	G'day mate i would use a, 243,270,308 30 06,7mm,7mm08 as an all rounder,except varmints shooting but i will say 7mm 7mm08 is a bit of an over kill on wild pigs or an animal of that size.depending on how far yr shooting yr target.But i wouldn't use a 243 on an elk.But i understand in America you are all gun hoe so just use a cannon,or a nad.cheers mate|`|2XusVa4jaa	I would use a 30/06 220 grain round nose soft point. The 30/06 is the most versatile caliber around.|`|5pejaYlAaa	The minimum caliper for elk should be the 270 WSM, and with that I would practice, practice, practice! It is a great caliper but I would not recamend it for a novice. If you want a great all-around caliper then the 30-06 would be the one, I have killed elk with the rifle and more with the bow and I can tell you they dont go down easy, with the 270WSM you have to place your shot carefully, with the 30-06 you can bust a shoulder and get away with it.  GOOD LUCK!|`|cc198e7f4ab424c24743237d7bdb642aaa	We are caught up in a "high-power" craze nowadays. You are probably gonna get a lot of answers saying .300 Win Mag. and up min.  I don't buy it personally.  I recently read (I think a Craig Boddington) article about all the elk and other large game that had been shot with the .257 Roberts.  That's pretty close to your 6.5.  That being said, I own a 6.5x55, and love it.  It's a great caliber for deer, and quite accurate.  It wouldn't be my first choice on an elk hunt though.  .270, .280, 7MAG, .30-06, any of those would make me feel more comfortable, especially since the 6.5 gets tired pretty quickly after 200 yards.  But if it's was all I had, I'd hunt Elk with mine.  It just means having to get placed for close shots, and making that shot count.|`|UrNVuFx6aa	I wouldn't consider anything less than .270 Win. using a minimum 150gr soft point for elk. Just my personal opinion, nothing says you can't try other calibers.<br>  <br>  Shoot straight and stay safe.|`|datmqg7Aaa	A 270 with a 150gr bullet in it,I wouldn't use anything less than that on elk.

I still think they are the best in the land, ("The Greatest Team of All" as our song goes), and am looking forward to them playing well to win tomorrow's NAB Cup and then take the 2009 flag...two flags in three years is a great result.<br>  <br>  I have always liked Richmond for family and Hawthorn and WCE for friendship reasons, but have come to "respect" Hawthorn as well.  <br>  <br>  The Hawks were the second best team over the course of 2008, played a brilliant game in the Grand Final against the threat of a mauling, and have a few stars of their own.  Hawthorn are also a traditional club, a family club which is as much about their community as they are about the trophies.  They are committed to developing football in Tasmania, (even if Tasmania would rather their own team), and have been for over forty years when Tassie men were regularly donning the gold and brown (along with the red/white/black of Darrell Baldock).  They have made the sensible decision to base themselves in Launceston rather than Hobart which shows they know what they are doing from a statewide point of view.<br>  <br>  No wonder they are such a Happy Team at Hawthorn.  ;-)<br>  <br>  The only team I don't like is Port Power...having had dealings with their fans their hatred for anyone/anything else is scary.  The Crows seem for the most part to have got away from the "We hate Victorians" mentality, or have at least reduced it to the level of friendly rivalry: (I was at a Cats/Crows game at AAMI in 2008 and had a great time, thanks Adelaide!!): but the Powers are what Collingwood used to be, and there's no need for that in a national showpiece in 2009.<br>  <br>  You make good points about Essendon: well done, and yes they are an admirable outfit.  Perhaps that is why the AFL chose them for both the recent Bushfire game and the annual ANZAC match.<br>  <br>  ;-)|`|mj1bC73gaa	Cats supporter (as you know) and most admire the Doggies.  I've loathed many of their players but admire the way their fans have kept them afloat despite years and years of under-performance.  They hale from what was traditionally the poorer side of town but their fans pitched together to save the club and are unwaivering in their loyalty.<br>  <br>  Players like Chris Grant have also been very admirable, but toe-rags like Liberatore and Akermanis ... well happy to see them on a losing side any day!|`|mYmh4a7Zaa	Collingwood is my preferred club also.<br>  I don't get how you get the space in your heart to admire Essendon Rivals for years with the pies but anyways........<br>  The other footy club i admire would be richmond because of their great appreciation of sadly ,not the premiership cup ,but the wooden spoon in most recent years.<br>  Thanks Tigers! :)|`|Z5OCROpwaa	I barrack for Carlton, but aprt from them my most admired team is the Bulldogs, they just are a hard working team and have good work ethic. They have Brad Johnson not the biggest guy but plays full forward like a big man. They also used to have Libba one of the hardest working players along with E.J Whitten.<br>  EDIT: They also nearly went out of business but the supporters made sure the club kept going.|`|keIqjnijaa	Hawthorn is great. You never really hear of any players that are involved in any crimes. Their a great team, when they play you can see the teamwork they produce. They also have really nice players.

914043d184dc2c85adfe8a17183cdb07aa	Your best shot at making the team is by showing the coach potential. If you show your love for the game, and your commitment to improving yourself you should be fine. From my experience, coaches prefer a lesser skilled player with a positive team spirit, over a better player who is cocky and only cares about himself. Oh and don't go around throwing clubs if you hit a bad shot, be well tempered, mature, and respect the game. <br>  <br>  Good luck!|`|W2R8TRDmaa	Being a very good golfer is a 7 day a week job but for most good golfers, its a labor of love.  Put some hard work in and do the best you can.  Just showing up and giving it your best shot will earn the respect of the other players.
a6ad0dab900f8c5525de517f336270dbaa	hey chill wit the caps.... you are decent for a freshman..but not to brag or anything im a sophmore and freshman year i got a 56 in the 100 free and got to state. 1.20 and 2.51 arnt BAD times. <br>  <br>  BIG POINT HERE!!!!<br>  you say you want to get scouted? first off (not to be rude) forget highschool times. no COLLEGE gives a rat's *** (DO NOT ARGUE ME...I WILL EXPLAIN) about your high school times. you want to get scouted? fine. you will have to be willing to work hard for it. Do the local swim club, because those are the events that are not included in highschool and those are the events that matter.<br>  <br>  highschool is just publicity. will not atract colleges UNLESS you are very good VERY GOOD and by good i mean split 40s on your 100 butter fliy and 21 lows on the 50 free. you better your state heat too. <br>  <br>  highschool swims YARDS...not METERS!! colleges are looking for GOOD METER swimmers. hell yea its impressive if you go 48's on your 100 free but go liek 6'11 on your 500. ITS MUCH MORE IMPRESSIVE if you go 9 lows in your 1000 meter and STILL do a 48-51 sec in your 100 free (yards). colleges have a plan and their plan is to buff you up. they already know that you can swim, they know they will make you better, they just want times. and its more of a benifit to them if they get a pro distance because it covers both side (sprinting to). <br>  keep at it, you will not regret it. cheers :P|`|sJS4ZZMoaa	I hate to break this to you.  But you need to get a lot faster to get noticed by scouts for swimming in college. Your time in the 200 IM is 30 seconds off of the state cut in my state.  Your time in the Fly is 10 seconds away.  If you want to even walk on to a big school, a good D-1 school, your times need to be faster than 2 mins and 1 second on your 200 IM and about 54-55 seconds on your 100 butterfly.  To get recruited by a smaller school, you need to drop a good bit of time still.  I don't know what times you need for smaller schools to recruit you.<br>  <br>  If you are truly serious about swimming and want to swim on a college level, then you need to get on the best club swim team in your area and start swimming year round.  I am not going to lie to you, year round swimming is hard, you will have to push yourself very hard and you will not have very much time to hang out with friends on the weekends.  Many swim teams practice in the mornings before you go to school.  You will always be tired and you will be sore all the time.... trust me I know.  You will also need to get a coach from one of those teams to spend time with you individually, to work on your strokes and turns.  Those are very, very important.  Your goal for senior year should be to make your big regional meet (by regional I mean like Southeastern Swim meet for the southeast, not your area's meet).  You really have to sacrifice a lot to become a good swimmer.  To swim for a big school you have to be one of the top performers in the state.  To give you an example... a teammate of mine won state in the 50 and 100 freestyle events and is having to walk on to a school in the southeastern conference. (he did have scholarship offers to other schools)<br>  <br>  Commit and work as hard as you can and it is possible for you to swim in college (even if it is for a smaller school).  Good Luck!|`|6rS42uSdaa	yo man i used to sux last year when it was my first year.  I worked soooooooo hard, at the end of every practice i could barely walk, i ran, i did lifting, i made it to every single practice on my club team.  Im not saying im amazing now but my 2im is 217 my 100 free is a 55 my 200 free is a 158 my 500 free is a 516.  You need to work. work work work|`|SVdVbYsFaa	i hate to tell you but sticky is right. i never was really into swimming till my sophmore year in highschool. by my senior year my best 50 free time was 21.95 i did not get aproached by anyone i had to go out and make the calls and get my self noticed i am thankful that i found a d1 school that would give me a full scholarship but i was tough work you need to get alot faster
c819b9c0e601697d9b53e747cb45c707aa	When you book a TEE time and don't fill up all 4 spots you can be playing with Golfers of all or any skill level , So  whats the problem you are always going to be playing with someone who is better or worse than you , the point is you get to play this wonderful game called golf and enjoy a wonderful day out with some nice people and enjoy yourself , Key Word : Enjoy Yourself .<br>  <br>  Have a Great day.|`|CBVlu3Gvaa	The simple answer is to find a fourth. so that you book the entire tee time.

There are two different leagues, one in Florida (grapefruit league) and one in Arizona (cactus league) with ALL the MLB clubs represented.

BB6HGbnPaa	Well..you can look at it like this. It goes thru your nose and out your mouth like when you eat food, it comes out the other way. Its so you can constantly breathe without being clogged thru one opening. When you breathe thru your mouth, you are breathing harder than you would when your breathing in your nose and out your mouth.|`|hHjh19PEaa	do whatever feels best for you -- i breath in thru my mouth all the time and seem to get more air with each breath-- if you are gasping for air while jogging then you need to slow down to a speed that you can breath at|`|BOzeeAN2aa	breathing in through your nose helps the oxygen get into your bloodstream better thus getting into your muscles...it also helps if you alternate the count that you breath on...ie...in for three...out for four.|`|yIYEmkZyaa	it helps cos if you don't breathe you will die
JpEQYumUaa	Breaststrokers tend to be very flexible in their legs, especially their quads. A very good strech for this is too start standing, get down on your knees, and gently lower yourself back so that your back is on the ground and your legs folded beneath you. It's best to do this infront of the TV so you have something to do lol. Hold it for as long as you feel comfortable, but stop immediately if it starts to hurt, and if you expierence any pain whatsoever, while getting into the pose, STOP. Not all people are able to do this, and you could cause injury to yourself from pushing too hard.<br>  <br>  Also, starting from the same position on your knees, move your legs out to the side of your thighs. When you do this, it should in some way resemble part of breaststroke kick. The same applies on this one as above on how long to hold and any pain.

It takes several days to adjust to the altitude and you will be exhausted after a full day of skiing. There are restaurants and some souvenir shopping. Other than that I would take games, cards and videos to use at your condo or hotel.|`|AA10254101	I live in Northern Utah and there are lost of things to do in Salt Lake City besides skiing.

jSkHquK5aa	A typical game of soccer comprises of 11 players a team. Here are the soccer rules that you must keep in mind when playing a game. <br>  <br>  The Rules<br>  <br>  1) The rules so a game of soccer are really quite simple. A game is soccer is played with 2 teams. The aim of the game is to score goals in the opposite opponents goal. The team that scores the most goals after a set amount of time wins the game. <br>  <br>  2) Before the start of a game, the teams can flip coins to decide which team plays at which side and also which team will kick-off first. <br>  3) A traditional soccer game usually lasts for 90 minutes altogether. Teams usually switch goal sides after about 45 minutes. This is known as half-time. This soccer rule is not as important as smaller games will probably be shorter. <br>  <br>  If neither team is the winner when it is full-time, a draw can be called or the game can be played for another 30 minutes. If there is no winner after the extra time is played then a penalty shoot-out will be played to decide a winner. <br>  <br>  4) You cannot use your hands or any part of the arm to make contact with the ball. Only the goal keeper has that privilege. If this does happen, a free kick where the "hand ball" was committed is awarded to the opposite team. <br>  <br>  <br>  Soccer is best played on either grass or astro turf (artifical ground). <br>  <br>  5) When making a tackle for the ball, players must genuinely make contact with the ball. This is where it can get messy and fouls can be committed if tackles are not timed right. A foul is committed when the player makes contact with the opponents legs without touching the ball first. Slight contact with the opponents legs may not be deemed as a foul if it is not enough to make the player fall over. <br>  <br>  If a foul is committed, a free kick is awarded to the opposite team. If the foul was inside the penalty box, then a penalty kick is awarded, otherwise, its a free kick. <br>  <br>  6) Goal keepers may only handle the ball when inside the area marked on the pitch. <br>  <br>  7) The keeper is prohibited to handle the ball when a team-mate intentionally uses their feet too pass the ball or from intentionally handling the ball from a direct throw-in. The goal keeper may still use their feet or other body part to re-direct the ball<br>  <br>  However, if the player uses any other body part besides the feet to pass the ball back too the keeper, (e.g. head) the keeper may handle the ball without committing a back-pass. <br>  <br>  <br>  If a back-pass is committed, am in-direct free kick is given to the opposite team. The kick is to be taken from a point on the forward edge of the goal area closest to where the back-pass was committed.<br>  <br>  <br>  Like every sport, if you want to improve, you must do soccer drills. By putting your body through different types of training exercises, you can become faster and stronger, mentally and physically. All the greatest athletes you see today did not get to where they are now by sitting at home and watching T.V. <br>  They worked hard for it! Thats right, if you worked hard, you can also improve. <br>  <br>  Too maintain peak performance, you have to make sure to stimulate your muscles in a certain way to help it grow and become stronger. <br>  <br>  Just like everything else, the more you do it, the better you will become at it. Soccer players tend to focus on building their leg muscles as soccer is played with the legs. <br>  <br>  There are different lots of different exercises you can do to improve. Each one will work on a different area, like shooting, conditioning, defence etc. <br>  <br>  Here are a few that may help you become a better soccer player. <br>  <br>  Soccer Shooting Drill<br>  Soccer Fitness Drill<br>  Soccer Passing Drill <br>  <br>  Remember to keep working at it, even if you are not good at first as you will improve. <br>  <br>  Most importantly, have fun!|`|79b2yM3saa	-put the ball in the back of the other teams net<br>  -go to goal<br>  -pass with a purpose<br>  -learn some basic deception moves (stepovers cuts ect)<br>  -use deception moves in game<br>  -pass to teammates<br>  <br>  streches<br>  -just copy what all the other soccer grls r doing

TJRMNDHPaa	Ween yourself off of meat, if you aren't already a vegetarian/vegan. You might be thinking crazy diet, but when I stopped eating meat, I lost fourteen pounds, with some help from yoga and swimming. But if you don't want to go veg, try doing these.

4d7b908cfe24bf3f1177a5cca13feb22aa	Definitely a better defensive boxer than Sugar Ray Leonard.  But Ray had a good power advantage, plus had the hand speed to put those punches into Whitaker's body and head.  I don't think Whitaker could have beaten Leonard, but he would have given Leonard fits.  I could see Ray scoring a few flash knockdowns to cinch a decision win.|`|I9Y6fxguaa	Ray wins by split. Faster, smarter, good chin and stamina. He would had pepper Whitaker good 12   rounds.|`|dh48AkbCaa	i agree with elmer, leonard bigger and stronger than sweet pea.
pSOmwwlIaa	Like I said before, Gio is barely starting to regain his level that he lost from SUB 17 and SUB 20. He's starting to lose his fear of getting tackled hard. How he's just going in for it. I'm glad he stopped just caring too much for his legs and lost his fear and now he's back.|`|VjMpfA2Yaa	He dosent want him on the team, he just put him in vs. Shaktar to show him off so another team can pick him up.

I think he better go back to spain quickly before he rotts in the reserves.|`|jUeiFZfmaa	Yeah it really sucks Gio is trying his hardest in every game but the coach has no confidence in him its sad.

Watch what you eat and train HARD!!!!|`|WNXbM5Doaa	try asking the question again and add you height and weight that would help people answer it better. and it shouldn't be too hard to drop that 100 free. i just started swimming with no prior swim experience and i got 1:09 the first meet i practiced for 1 month and dropped it down to 1:01 just push harder kick faster get your will power up. you could definitaly drop that time just with a faster mind set lol good luck swimming is hardd|`|A0MTKSoiaa	alright don't try losing too much weight, that won't help you. lifting will though, for your level, you want to be doing about 8 pound on each arm, 3 sets of 12 reps maybe. as to how can you swim better, ask your coach! i can't give you advice without seeing you swim.|`|9dhr9UNTaa	swim faster|`|9Zv86nF3aa	Not knowing your age or skeletal make up, I can't tell you what weight or number of reps needed to start with. But ...I can tell you that whatever you decide to lift in weight....make sure you do it slow with emphasis on making your muscles long and strong. Now....regardless of your physical make up, focus on technique, technique and technique.The better your technique, the more you'll get out of every yard swam. Turns are also very important when trying to drop time. You mentioned the 500 Frestyle. Think of all the time you could drop if your turns were just .5 seconds faster than they are now.Thats a 9.5 second drop without becoming faster between the walls. If you train hard (making target times within the set interval) and improve your technique (breathing, stroke count, 6 beat kick etc.) you will drop time. Ask your coach to watch your turns, arm strokes and kick and then make suggestions as to how and improve them. You might also want to have a friend or family member video your swimming technique and then go over it again with your coach. Skip Kenney and Richard Quick (2 former NCAA and Olympic Team coaches) have videos you can buy that cover all 4 strokes as well as starts, turns and drills. I look forward to hearing about your improvement and wish you the best of luck.|`|MzYUXD9gaa	lifting weights wont matter<br>   my 50 time is a 27 and all you have to do is practice your drills and make sure your flip turns are fast. try and breath only 4 times the whole 50 or even less you will go faster and also drink more liquids than you eat solids

IsQckOXraa	yes!<br>  The Jackson Competitor with the mirage blade would be perfect, it comes with the quality and support that you will need throughout the freestyle levels, and will still be a good skate when you are learning your axel and double jumps.  I have a pair of Jackson freestyles (learning doubles) and they work great, but that is the next level up boot from mine.  <br>  Have fun skating!<br>  :)|`|WJ7BhjM2aa	It really depends on your foot, height and weight.  Most people are of the opinion that a name brand equals better.  However, the best skate is the one that fits you the best.  <br>  <br>  The DJ2270 is a great boot if you are a small/petite person, if you are a 6' guy weighing 180 lbs, you would need a step up from that just because you are going to be putting a lot of stress on your ankles with the jumps and a less stiff boot will break down quicker.  I wouldn't necessarily pick the Mirage Blade. It's a good blade for beginners, but if you are starting to work on edges and jumps, you may want to get an intermediate blade like the protege or legacy.<br>  <br>  The best place to get information on the different brands of boots and blades and which one is the best for your level,  go to <a href="https://www.kinziescloset.com/Skate_Selection_Charts.html." rel="nofollow">https://www.kinziescloset.com/Skate_Sele...</a>
AA10326275	try to find a boxing gym nearby and start working out there. depending on where u live it may be VERY hard to find one. ive been boxing for years and had a professional trainer but i had to drive an hour and a half to meet with him. so u have to be very dedicated for it to work out. i also am a boxing coach and have all my workout equipment in my heated garage.

eAbSM1U6aa	A lot depends on the flow rate of the spring.  If the flow is not high enough it will freeze in the winter.  Also with a low flow rate the chances of plugging the spring when digging and causing it to move to another place are higher.   One thing you could do is try sinking a pipe into the spring and use the flow out of the pipe to fill a barrel.  That way if the flow is too low to prevent freezing, you can undo it.  Its also way less effort.

b8Os9wJLaa	As for weight, the vapors are about 4.2 ounces lighter. Adidas are about as heavy as nike 90 strike II. I have seen one of my friends get f50.7 and they lasted for three seasons. I know 2 other people with the vapors, one got them this last fall, so i dont know if they are holding up, but the other person has had them for 3-4 season. So it looks as if they hold up the same. The only thing that makes the f50.9 better is that you can change the studs. You may also want to look at the vapor superflys. they weight 6.8 ounces and cost 350.|`|toW3SdxWaa	The Vapors|`|0floKHTIaa	no. get the adidas. those last longer..|`|7BIiofbaaa	I'd definitely suggest the vapors. The F50s are made of plastic or something like that and don't give you as good a touch on the ball as the vapors do. Plus, if you don't screw the studs in tight enough on the F50s they fall out, and if you screw them in too tight, it'll strip the cleat. This is spoken from experience: I currently own a pair of F50.6s. If you look at a game on TV, you'll see more players wearing vapors than F50s.

You will probably need club heads that make it easier to get the ball in the air. Most club heads including many of the 'famous 'brands are mass produced in the east and assembled elsewhere. The big companies spend a fortune on promotion, including sponsoring 'Tiger' and many more, hence the high prices for their clubs. There are many smaller companies whose clubs are just as good and they do not have the overheads of the majors. Once you know the specifications after being checked out on a swing machine, you can them buy through the net or on Ebay for either new or 'as new' clubs, there are plenty of people who take up the sport then find it too difficult and retire early, there are plenty of good secondhand sets around for sale at bargain prices $200 to $400 should get you are good secondhand set including a bag.

I had thought nascar was the stupidest sport in the world. Well my boyfriend watched it. And seeing He was a nice guy about my soap opras I thought I would be nice and watch it. He liked jimmy johnson and I wasnt going to be a follower, so I decide to pick the pettiest car. That was the number 18 car Kyle Busch. When i said that my boyfriend laughed and said, Ive never seen him finish a race not on his top. Well after a couple races I was hocked and Kyle Busch kicked but last year with a ton of wins and he will this year to. but the point is , its not to late . YOU pick a driver Dale JR. will probly disapoint again this year , he is not him daddy .Kyle Busch is Daddy. What the race tomarrow on fox ,starts at 1:30 They probly will not get going till 2 or 2:30. You will love the recks.

Also, just practice your foot work and release time. By way off, do you mean above the 1Bmen's head or too low? If you mean high then work on maybe not popping up after grounders too high and just try throwing a little bit lower little by little.

For the small streams a fancy reel makes no sense.  A rim control reel with spare spool is a good starting place.  Load one spool  with backing and floating line.  Check with the local people to see if they even allow sinking lines on your streams.  A friend returning from S.W. england chalk streams said they would not allow him to swing midges as we routinely do here.  If such is the case, the spare spool will not be needed.  If ok, load the second spool with an intermediate sink.  Get some leaders and flies and get on the water.  Skip such things as vests, waders, and other gadgets untill you have a better idea of how you would like to define your activity.<br>  <br>  Tight lines and fine companionship|`|wXyoo8mNaa	Welcome to the sport it's very unique,skip the little stream try big saltwater,you'll be hooked.

PcgbafaEaa	First off you should have that at about a 4 if you want the fresh water feel. 3min for 500 is not the best (sorry). I am a coxswain 5 3 and 95lbs and I pull 2:30 for a 500. But the best thing I can say is do longer low parts. Like a 5k and just try and maintain one number. <br>  <br>  Good Luck!|`|mr0Hb5fvaa	for new rowers you should be between a 2:20/ 500m and 2:40/500m. this is a good pace to learn at, and until you build up the muscles you need, this will also give you a decent workout. the setting on the erg is a weird thing. level 10 gives you more drag, so you row more meters per stroke, but it takes more effort to do so. this setting is rarely used. the setting you want is a level 2-4. this will give you a good idea of what it will feel like with actual water. if you are new to rowing, and want to join a team, you would be good for a novice team. look at local clubs, they will be able to teach you the basics. your time will improve as you learn the correct way to take a stroke, and as you build your endurance. eventually you will be able to pull under 2:00/500m. keep up the good work!|`|OjKjvCbUaa	first there is no reason to put the setting on a 10 especially if your inexperienced. a 2 or a 3 is what most start out on. on that setting, for girls... a very good time is a 2 minute split or 8 minute time altogether. which would be 2:00/500m. putting the setting on a 10 is just not a good idea for someone inexperienced because you don't no the proper technique and you will strain or pull a muscle. <br>  i suggest asking someone how to properly urg before you even jump on the urgometer to prevent injuries ESPECIALLY if you are putting it on a 10.<br>  i don't say these things to discourage you because crew is an awesome sport, but if you have terrible technique and your sloppy, your time doesn't matter.<br>  deffinitely get help from some one you know who rows and keep trying! :)
BB6HGbnPaa	Is your shoes old? If it is, you need to change them.|`|AA10241450	For me warming up and do wall stretches are helpful and more important doing resistance training such as toe and calf raises.  Also do toe walks and duck or heel walks doing them forward and backwards.  Also do figure 8 moves or circles with one of your foot when your sitting down in a chair.  Practice more karate type or yoga stretching exercises or look for shin split stretches on youtube.  Remember to massage your shin splits and ice after your runs if it's bothering you.  Good luck!|`|cKXZOLJSaa	I have them,<br>  ice them after practice for about an hour then about an hour before you sleep ice them.<br>  you need to stretch them also.<br>  stand up on your tip toes for about twenty seconds, then on your heels for twenty seconds, and repeat about three times, do this before you run.|`|AA11264136	Yo, <br>  Sorry to hear you have this. Shin splints suck immensely. Good news is you can get rid of them fairly easily. <br>  <br>  1. Ice cups-- get a Dixie cup and fill it with water until the water is about a half an inch or an inch from the brim of the cup. freeze it. then rip off the top half of the cup so the ice is sticking out of cup. Massage your shins with this for about 15-20 minutes and then break for about 30 minutes. This really helps.<br>  <br>  2. The golf ball-- get a golf ball and massage your feet with it (rolling it on the ground with your foot). the foot is the first point of contact with the ground. if the muscles/tendons in your foot are stiff then that can throw off your normal step, causing shin splints. <br>  <br>  3. Duck Walks (aka heel walks) -- walking on your heels for about 10- 15 meters will strengthen the shins. <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9UWRekYDp0Y" rel="nofollow">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9UWRekYDp...</a> <-- put this in your URL, if you want to see how it's done.<br>  <br>  4. Calf raises-- this also helps strengthen your shins to prevent shin splints. <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GJwRFpRXZzY&feature=channel" rel="nofollow">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GJwRFpRXZ...</a> <-- this shows how to do them. <br>  <br>  5. Stretching-- This is key. Like preventing any injury while doing exercise, you need to stretch. many people neglect this (including me at times). Make sure you are properly warmed up before you stretch. stretching muscles "cold" can cause more injuries in some cases.<br>  <br>  6. Shoes-- Make sure you have good shoes, old ones can cause shin splint cause they are worn down. a good pair of running shoes has a life span of about 3-4 months. if you really pound the pavement (ie. run a lot) then it would be lcoser to the 3 month range.<br>  <br>  7. Doctor-- consult your doctor if your shin splints persist. Your doctor will be able to tell if you have a stress fracture in your shins, which would require you to not exercise (at least your lower body) for a longer period of time.<br>  <br>  Runnersworld.com  <-- this has good info on shin splints and other injuries. plus some other good info as well.<br>  <br>  Hope this helps! If you get rid of your shin splints keep strengthening them to prevent any further injury in your shins.|`|xpvFbcJqaa	I used to get these all the time too, I learned that if you just simply hydrate, stretch real good (before and after running) and you have a good pair of running shoes than you won't get shin splints anymore.
ioogYI2baa	It's probably your achilles tendon. The best way to stretch that out would be to do the one where you push up against the wall, except for bend your knee in a little bit to get the heel off the ground. You should feel it right above your heel in your lower calf. That's the best stretch I know of to work through those kinds of injuries. <br>  <br>  If the injury is the front of your leg, it's probably a shin splint. There may be some stretches you can use, but the best method would be to ice that.|`|jtvrSod4aa	Shin Splint.

ScCZh0vQaa	I also do track and my coach tells us that the more you are relaxed when running, the faster you'd run.<br>  <br>  Some tips he gives us when running:<br>  - Keep your mouth open; you should feel your lips vibrating. That makes you able to breathe easily.<br>  <br>  - Your arms should be close to you, not swinging everywhere. Don't make a tight fist because that doesn't make you feel relaxed. Your thumb should be on the top of your index finger not making a tight fist.<br>  <br>  - Run like you're riding a bike. The front of you foot should be touching the floor first, then your heel. Good running shoes help. Shox aren't good shoes for running track.<br>  <br>  - Make sure nothing above your hips is moving; only your arms and feet should be moving. Your back shouldn't hurt when running, if it does that means you aren't running right and kneeling backwards. <br>  <br>  We started track yesterday so those are just some of the tips he told us so far. Good luck! :)|`|Qh2rc1DNaa	I saw a clip on sports science that said the number one factor in speed is leg strength....Time to hit the weight room!  Good luck|`|ocHNtbQZaa	The key to getting faster is to get stronger and run as relaxed as possible. Locomotion science shows the fastest runners have the most muscle support force so they don't collapse at the ankle/knee at ground contact. Try leg presses where you lift the weight with both legs but hold in place with one leg, on ball of foot, knee slightly bent. Hold as much weight as you can for 10-20 seconds. Do 4-6 holds on each leg a few times a week. Also run short under distance sprints to practice running as relaxed as possible.|`|joZllyOgaa	well im not kidding either just today i went to sports authority and bought a running sled it works amazingly but only do short sprints like 10 yards bout 5-10 times or untill your legs burn real bad that builds up your starting speed and accelaration. Also buy ankle weights i use them i love them and use track cleats when you are getting timed it sheds off the tenths of a second and do striders bout 10 times if you dont know what a strider is just email me at vinnytheginny77@yahoo.com <br>  Hope i helped
cKXZOLJSaa	You just need to practice more!|`|AA10742014	whiten your teeth
cKXZOLJSaa	Well, it will probably take longer than two weeks.<br>  but try to get into some 400m races.<br>  It can help you sprint.<br>  and if your school has one of those running parachutes, use it.<br>  it will help you with sprinting.<br>  and run with ankle weights.<br>  you get fast with those and you'll be faster with them off.<br>  wear them when you walk around school and at practice, you'll feel the difference|`|l7iZhjoSaa	Repetition and consistency are the keys. You want to do 100's every day, and do a couple of longer sprints as well. Push yourself on those until you literally can no longer walk. For two weeks that'll be the best way, from my experience. Also practice your starts, it is amazing how much time you can take off by having a good start.

jSkHquK5aa	Soccer tryout season arrives soon for many players and coaches. Glee and heartbreak will once again prevail, perhaps in equal parts, as coaches and players struggle to organize competitive youth soccer teams.<br>  <br>  Because of the growth of the sport in teams and players, the great majority of coaches who will be selecting youth teams never played soccer in their youth, never took part in a soccer tryout, and don't have enough experience in team management to recognize many common tryout perils. Similarly, most players and parents are driven to tryouts by misguided motivations that arise partly because of the lack of a long cultural history in the sport. <br>  <br>  These players and parents look to their youth experience with other sports and subconsciously use the behavior of coaches, players in these sports as a model.<br>  <br>  Despite their best efforts, coaches will make tryout mistakes that will handicap their newly assembled teams for months or years to come. Similarly, many players and parents will fall into tryout traps that will provide at least a year of regret and, in some cases, lasting difficulty in the game. <br>  <br>  We explore here some common myths about tryouts, and then look at fourteen ways to fail as a coach at tryouts, and how to learn from these failures. We conclude with a practical plan for clearing out problem players before tryouts begin. <br>  Tryout Facts and Fiction <br>  <br>  There are many common beliefs about tryouts that are simply wrong.<br>  <br>  Fiction: The purpose of tryouts is to find the most competitive players.<br>  <br>  Fact: A series of successful tryouts actually sort out the players and<br>  teams so that players are lined up with teams with other players of similar<br>  skills, similar competitiveness, and a similar commitment to training.<br>  <br>  Fiction: Coaches can easily recognize all the best players.<br>  <br>  Fact: Many youth coaches do not have sufficient experience to reliably distinguish between players with slightly varying ability levels. Many do not quickly recognize promising project players, or overlook gifted players who have crucial abilities to read the game or make clever attacking passes. It is too easy to overlook such players in favor of larger and faster players, or players who use the ball a great deal.<br>  <br>  Fiction: The best players are selected.<br>  <br>  Fact: An assortment of the best and not-so-best players are selected.<br>  <br>  Fiction: Many players got their position through politics.<br>  <br>  Fact: A few players get their position through politics. The coach's daughter, the board member's son, these are common. In some cases average players make a better team because they provide transportation for the star player who has no ride to practice and matches. It happens.<br>  <br>  Fiction: Good teams don't have vacancies.<br>  <br>  Fact: Healthy teams change a few players each year. Job relocations, injury, and commitments to other sports take a few players away every year, even from the best teams.<br>  <br>  Fiction: Coaches will always want the star players.<br>  <br>  Fact: Some star players have nightmare parents who are never happy and who annoy and disturb most of the other team parents. Better coaches avoid these "stars" for the sake of protecting team chemistry.<br>  <br>  Fiction: Players who aren't on the best teams by U14 will never make it.<br>  <br>  Fact: U16 is more like it. Many U14 stars disappear by U18. Some who depended on athleticism are passed by those who develop skill and tactical speed. Others fall to injury, bad home situations, and interest in other activities.<br>  <br>  Fiction: There is nothing that a player can do to improve at tryouts.<br>  <br>  Fact: There are many effective steps to follow in preparing for a tryout. See How to win friends and influence coaches at ODP tryouts. All other things equal, better skilled and more athletic players do better at tryouts.<br>  <br>  Fiction: The best players should try out for the best team.<br>  <br>  Fact: Below U17, it is more important to get excellent training than to be on the best team. Parents and players should seek out the very finest trainers available, even if the trainers don't yet have killer teams. Many early "killer teams" are built by enthusiastic parent coaches with limited training ability but great organizational and recruiting ability. These teams fade away during the high school years, overshadowed by teams that gained their playing ability through extensive training and player development.|`|ojwRgCLqaa	You have to be aggresive, know some tricks, have good defense, and don't back away from the ball.<br>  <br>  Good luck:)<br>  <br>  Guys please help:<br>  <br>  <a href="http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index;_ylt=ApjJ.iqsSOGetRkM_4rt3qfsy6IX;_ylv=3?qid=20090306194025AAJXEcJ">http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index;...</a>|`|2g1rxroVaa	I think just by having confidence in you. Being agressive and playing hard you will get your chance. Just be yourself|`|n9eG4Zguaa	actually, it's very important to just watch soccer games.  Coaches look for a few main things.  Game sense and first touch.<br>  Watch pro soccer games on TV (anything, mexican is good too because its on like every day almost).  Try to predict what a player will do.  When you're wrong, learn from it, and try to get it right next time.  It really will help a lot.<br>  It's very important to have a good first touch.  Some coaches don't even know why they think a player is good, but many times when they feel this way, its just because the player has a good first touch (trapping the ball, etc.) So practice kicking a ball against a wall hard and trapping it  When you trap it, the ball should always stay near your body.  Doing this will get boring, but if you focus while doing it, it really will help you a lot.|`|hch4DBiJaa	An easy way of getting on the team is playing a position nobody wants to play.

oMjVp4zGaa	First off they aren't called poles any more! It's a rod and I actually remember quicksticks I am pretty sure they came in a black plastic lockable case, holster (could mount on a belt) and either a spin cast or spinning reels came with them. I am sure they were made by Daiwa right? About five one foot pieces make of the rod? I used one for years in the sierras and kept it in my truck (just) in case I needed to fish some days driving by a lake or pond screaming at me to stop and catch something. The problem the spin cast reel had was the bell was soft metal and would wear a groove in it caused by the line and the fact that any fish over two, two and a half pounds was too much for them. They almost always were gray in color too.

Hes AMAZING.!|`|0c4bef4bb2a1a8053209bc8fb005359baa	Somewhat alright, but I would make some changes-<br>  <br>  Jorge Posada might be a great addition to your team if he can stay healthy this year. Plus, he is starting to get a little old....<br>  <br>  Berkman is not the same guy that he was when he was in the outfield. His numbers were not the usual for him. I would possibly get rid of him and bring in someone like Miguel Cabrera from the Tigers, Derek Lee from the Cubs or Ryan Howard from the Phillies if you can get them. They should continue to dominate at the plate this year.<br>  <br>  Alexi Ramirez- I don't know much about him. I would keep your eye on Cardinals' outfielder Skip Schumaker as he makes his transition from Centerfield to 2nd Base. So far he has looked sharp this spring. I wouldn't drop Ramirez right away for Schumaker. Give it a month and see where you go with Ramirez.<br>  <br>  Jones & Jeter- Where can you go wrong? They are doing alright this spring. I would watch out for Jones, however, as he spent a little time on the DL.<br>  <br>  Doumit- Had a pretty good year last year. He wasn't your one guy that had a breakout year, but he was somewhat steady. Good choice.<br>  <br>  Bench- Rick Ankiel would actually be a better outfielder instead of David DeJesus. Ankiel will most likely get the starting job in Center or Right for the Cardinals this season. <br>  Renteria is a decent backup for shortstop for Jeter. Although Jeter is your starter, Renteria should have an "Alright" season as the Giants' starting shortstop. <br>  Kotchman, Johnson, Kendrick and Beteancourt are vaguely familiar names to me. I remember Beteancourt plays for the Mariners at 2nd Base. He should be fine, but beware if he goes down on the DL<br>  <br>  Outfielders- DeRosa and Lee- What can we say? They had outstanding years last year as they made their runs toward the Playoffs. They should be healthy and great this season.<br>  <br>  Pitching Staff- The Yankees have bought themselves a lot of talent this off season- C.C. Sabathia, etc. While they are an All-Star like rotation, there is a slim chance that they could have a fault in them.<br>  <br>  My projection for you: Middle to Upper Middle in your Fantasy League.
It2jlZXmaa	G'day mate, i don't think yr going to get anybody selling there air rifle here,In Australia you need a gun license to shoot those guns now.But any how we don't need full auto guns to hunt pigs and deer here in Australia we only need one shot.cheers mate|`|Q4IguUL6aa	Scott I hope you are not serious - this thread has been reported to Australian Customs - thanks for listing your email address.|`|ZsujbEjJaa	no offence but some of the the laws in oz sucks, there are too many restrictions on everything, try to get one shipped piece by piece and don't have a label on it with the words gun/firearm or something that that will get the customs suspicious. label it as something else.|`|KKAVGtKtaa	Yes... I live in melbourne and i am an importer and have imported over 1000 guns(both bb and real) and i haven't go busted yet... its really simple just import to New-Zeland which doesn't have as tough laws as australia (within gun laws) and then i get them sent from there to  melbourne and haven't got busted yet so if u would like to purchase one contact freckles_dot@hotmail.com
HuDn5MMtaa	We had a Jack that loved to hunt pheasants.  He was good at it. If you took a shot gun out it made his day. I never went rabbit hunting with him.

They are incredibly smart, but also incredibly hard headed and difficult to train.  They have a mind of their own and a natural instinct to hunt.  Training one to pursue a specific animal is very difficult.  They are easily distracted and may start off chasing a rabbit, will then get curious about a butterfly near by, then by a bird flying over, and then be the cows grazing in the next field over.  <br>  Good luck<br>  Great dogs but like I said...hard headed as a piece of rock.

vGrYHJCMaa	I swim on the team at UCLA so I deal with this every day. I have lighter tinted goggles (black ones give you more of a tan). Another thing we do (which is weird looking but works) is put eye black under our eyes. It deflects the sun and stops the goggle tan. Eye black is the stuff football players put - it sounds crazy but if you're really serious about getting rid of it, that works!!|`|SVdVbYsFaa	swim indoors....yay best answer all the way

rTCYEHQhaa	LaHair will most likely be starting  the season in the Majors, listed second on the depth chart at First Base behind Branyan.  Most people inside the M's believe that if Branyan gets off to a slow start, LaHair will get a shot at starting.
BB6HGbnPaa	People who say dont breathe with your mouth is stupid. Try breathing in your nose and out your mouth. If you breathe only thru your nose, you wont get enough oxygen in your lung. It is normal to have dry mouth. Just drink water when your mouth gets dry or becoming dehydrated.|`|hHjh19PEaa	just make sure you drink alot of water the day before and some before you start to run --otherwise try not to think about it or else think how good some water will taste when you are finished|`|DPPW93JFaa	drink one beer 10 minutes before your race, that will help alot, it did for me, but just one tho dont just drink for the hell of it|`|koaVQVnJaa	Breathe in through your nose and out through your mouth.

yererDcnaa	try putting your pointer finger on top of middle finger. this puts more pressure on the ball with your middle finger which creates a tighter spin, and gets rid of the resistance from your pointer which slows down the spin<br>  <br>  try throwing the curve right over the top to make it drop straight down
A3tg75UDaa	This is an interesting question to me. but your link isn't working. See if you can fix that. <br>  <br>  I don't know how to throw a curve, but it sounds like you need to work on throwing it faster so it takes just a little bit longer for the stitches to bite on the wind forces.|`|eNGgmsA6aa	the slower you throw a curve the more it will curve. So if you want a curve to be less loopy throw it harder. If you want to throw a breaking ball that will go straight down try a sinker. I throw it by making a kind of thumbs up with my fist like i'm about to have a thumb fight with sumbody. Then I set the ball in front of my thumb and let it lay on the top of my index finger. When you throw you should let it roll off your index finger and the ball will spin backwards making it drop. You can get it to drop almost almost 3 feet if you really spin it. Plus it's better for your arm then a curve ball.

Z5xgSATSaa	Depends on how big the lockers are. Do you have any friends who have BMX bikes? If so, ask to borrow a front wheel. If the front wheel from a BMX bike won't fit in your locker, then no folding bike will fit in there either, no matter what the price.

XUnsJ2xjaa	Everything takes its own time. You will find that you cant "dramatically" improve your tennis within two weeks. Depending on how good of a player you are, depends on how much room there is for improvement. As the old saying goes "practice makes perfect" <br>  Get out there as much as possible, get a really good coach with as many sessions as you can. They will give you all the tips you need. <br>  -mentally-You need to keep your mind FOCUSED (such a hard thing to do, stay away from distractions) <br>  -physically-talk to your coach about this, it will require some serious effort..<br>  -technically-talk to your coach<br>  -how to play like nadal- Nadal has been playing for quite some time, and is extremely experienced. Do small excersices, like putting a few cones around each other, or lines...whatever, and practice small, sharp steps. <br>  -strategically-once again, talk to your coach...<br>  <br>  Hope this helps...<br>  and i really do hope you improve..

AA12198742	what exactly do you want help with?<br>  <br>  I would suggest that if you are freaked out by the incident that you get a clear shield or a cage for the helmet, and as far as the cut- if you are that concerned, get it checked by a doc.<br>  <br>  Hope that helps...|`|9ujT56Maaa	2 or 3 hours?  That's all?  It sounds like you just got cut good, but the redness might just be raw skin from underneath the layers that got ripped off.  Either way, all you can do at this point is obsessively keep it clean for a few days until it heals up.  It might scar, but I doubt it'll be that bad even if it does (besides, assuming you're a guy, chicks dig scars).
poAJPWh9aa	The Rose River Loop would be a nice hike (dogs on a leash are welcome).  It is a four-mile loop, (rated moderate due to the 900ft + ascent).  It starts at mile marker 49.4 of Skyline Dr, in the central district of the Shenandoah National Park.  You will see a number of pools and cascades, including Rose River Falls.  You can also take a short side trip to Dark Hallow Falls.  <br>  <br>  Details:<br>  Park at mile 49.4 at the Fishers Gap Overlook parking lot on the west side of Skyline Drive.  Walk to the north end of the parking lot and cross the drive to the east.  Go down the fire road to a cement post (very short distance).  Turn left onto the Skyline-Big Meadows horse trail.  It is blazed yellow at first, then veer right (0.6 mile) at another cement post.  The horse trail goes left (north).  You will go right and stay on the blue blaze Rose River Loop Trail.  The Rose River Falls is about another 0.6 mile.  At around 2.1 miles, you will cross a bridge and start following the Hogcamp Branch.  This is where you start to ascent.  At about 3 miles, you will come back to the fire road.  You will go right to return to the Fishers gap Overlook parking lot.  This is where you can take the short side trip (once on the fire road, just across the bridge on the left) to Dark Hollow Falls (0.3 miles).<br>  <br>  Have fun, and be careful.<br>  <br>  Tommy
1b98dcf55f3a990e7013ba04e6691faaaa	That's normal.  Your Ruger P89 basically follows the 1911 design.  <br>  <br>  Here is a 1911 animation.  Note how the back of the barrel drops down as the slide comes back.  <br>  <a href="http://www.m1911.org/loader.swf" rel="nofollow">http://www.m1911.org/loader.swf</a><br>  <br>  (Click on the hide button for the slide so you can see the barrel)|`|ewbuVeTTaa	That's how it works as stated. What you have is a Browning swinging link system, like the 1911 has. It uses a link to drop the barrel slightly to help load a round in to the chamber when the slide is opened. then tilt up to firing position when the slide is closed, locking the breech. When you fire, the round's energy forces the slide back, tilts the barrel down, the extractor and ejector pulls and eject the spent round out of the chamber and when the slide returns forward, the process starts all over again when you fire a round. The 1911 series uses this process as well as the Ruger P series. <br>  <br>  Most other Browning inspired guns use the cam system, which instead of a swinging link, a cam on the frame and lugs on the barrel cause the tilting of the barrel to do the same. <br>  <br>  You'll find how it works here:<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.m1911.org/full_1911desc.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.m1911.org/full_1911desc.htm</a>|`|ZsujbEjJaa	thats normal, the barrel has to unlock itself so that it can eject the spent case and reload the next round and then it will tilt straight again.|`|AA11729094	Yes it tilts, barrel is not bent.

WYWx9j8Maa	lay on your back...<br>  lift legs...where your body is at a 90 degree angle. <br>  you may use a wall if you're having trouble keeping your legs up...just make sure if you do, that your legs are STRAIGHT UP against the wall and not slanted. <br>  <br>  with your right arm, reach to touch your left foot.. (no, you won't actually touch your toes, but you get the motion)<br>  <br>  then with your left arm, reach for your right foot.<br>  this works your sides.<br>  don't go too slow, but don't go too fast.<br>  do about 2 sets of 25.<br>  <br>  then reach both arms at the same time. that works all the middle and lower gut. do 2 sets of 25 on that one too.<br>  <br>  not sure if it makes sense but it really works.<br>  <br>  but if you really want to lose weight AND get toned. <br>  i suggest running 4 days a week.. and cut all sodas from your diet. and stay away from bread. lol unless you're an athlete.|`|HsrRNnIBaa	It sounds like you look great already! Every girl needs to have tummy fat to protect her reproductive organs. And a little tummy fat is really sexy. And so what if your thighs are a little big. You have no need to lose weight. Real girls look so much better than skinny models in a bikini.|`|2U4U22cxaa	I would start doing pilates if you can and some light weight training using less weight but doing more reps. Also drink tons of water and limit fast food and other junk foods and get proper sleep. Also try to find a flattering suit and color might, try on some one pieces because some are very cute. But core training and pilates will help slim you down along with eating healthy but your weight seems very normal so just follow those tips.<br>  <br>  good luck|`|RGG30rbkaa	Losing exercise is up to you, but I might have some tips not including weight loss to help you look bettter. <br>  <br>  1. Instead of baking yourself until you look brown enough, why not use spray on tan? Its the new thing! Plus you wont increase your chance of skin cancer and you can looks good at the beach! CAN IT GET ANY BETTER??<br>  <br>  2. If you are self concious about your 'so called' fat thighs wear boardies, but remember it use Vaseline around your short line. Cos nothings worse than having chafe!<br>  <br>  3. Cut your toenails! I hate it when people go to the beach and their toenails look like shrek toes.

xxq5JAM6aa	Hmmm..A beach cruiser is retro and has big, fat tires that would smooth out that rocky dirt road a bit. You can put on what ever kinda saddle you want. They come with fenders, but no gearing or shocks.<br>  <br>  Next best would be a hybrid or comfort bike. Comes with large tires, full gear range, and a front shock that would really help on that rocky road. Sorta retro. You'd have to add the fenders, so make sure and get one that has the attach points. Slap you leather saddle on that. Your local bike shop can fix you up.<br>  <br>  A mountain bike is not retro at all and has no place for fenders. Forget that.|`|HiAVqwHDaa	check out a steel cyclocross frame with fender mounts(holes for the "tire cover things") then put some retro looking handlebars on it, and fenders (tire cover things). Don't go with a mountain bike because they are inefficient for everything except for actual trail riding. Cyclocross bikes are like a mix of a road bike and mountain bike, so they are lighter and can be ridden on roads as well as trails and the rocky dirt road you are talking about. If you want a leather seat, check out the brooks b-17. they are considered the most comfy seats after they break in, and they last many, many years.|`|UmRyUrSZaa	i would choose mountain bike.|`|LlfLa4Twaa	A mountain bike!|`|aNlT1NRqaa	What you're looking for is either a comfort bike or cruiser. I use a mountain bike for everything, but cruisers will be more comfortable for casual, short distance riding. You sit more upright, they have wider handlebars, and wider smoother tires. Cruiser bikes usually don't have shocks, but the seats have springs to smooth out cobblestones & rocks.<br>  <br>  Comfort & cruisers usually come with fenders. You can add fenders to a mountain bike, if you get one.<br>  <br>  Cyclo-cross bikes are not what you want. They are like road bikes with a little changes to make it tougher for dirt. You have to be tucked down in an uncomfortable position. Exactly the opposite of what you described.<br>  <br>  Go to a bike shop. Here we have R.E.I. and Performance. They will have some models you can sit on & ride in the parking lot. They will help adjust the bikes to fit you so it's as comfortable as possible.

So I suggest going to a store that specializes in sneakers (like Marathon Sports). They will watch your stride and pick out the right show for you. And plus, if you say your school name/team, you get a 10% discount!<br>  <br>  I really don't think your diet should change much. But if you eat a lot of junk and empty calorie foods, you might want to lower that down.|`|eo3lDZDWaa	You really don't have to go crazy. Track really is lots of fun. The coaches will tell you how much to run. They keep track of how good of shape everybody is in. You need regular tennis shoes. When you go shopping, they will probably have shoes on a shelf that says running. Try and find asics or new balance. They are the best brands. And you have to wear regular gym clothes and make sure you will be warm enough if it is cold outside.|`|cpXyyY1Zaa	it kinda depends on what level you're at, you know, middle school or high school. there's a lot of differences between the two|`|cKXZOLJSaa	Well, to start, probably look into asics as a brand.<br>  They're good for track, I own about three pairs.<br>  second, try running around your neighborhood/park and time it.<br>  then try to beat that time and keep making goals for yourself.<br>  Also, you should lift at a gym if possible to build your muscles.<br>  eat healthy also.<br>  but don't be too conscious about it, you'll burn most the calories off when you run.<br>  Don't forget to stretch and make sure to push yourself but not too hard.
Y4mz8BShaa	Recharged it a few times? You very likely just killed the battery. You don't overcharge batteries. They crash, burn, and die.<br>  <br>  Who makes the airsoft gun you have?|`|aw3Rhd5Jaa	Maybe try lubing it. That might do the trick
p0e9jh79aa	sumo|`|e6194ade1f407494b6f0be00450abb7caa	For my club team, we do a one hour circuit most of the time before swimming. This includes jump ropes, ab work (anything works), dumbbell lifting, lunges with weights, medicine ball tossing, stretch chord workouts, don't know what it is called but you stand on a ledge and lift your body up using only your feet, using a yoga ball and lifting weights on it (in sitting position and then on your back), any machine that works your legs, pull ups, elevated push ups. the list goes on but im sure you get the idea. for all of these stations, we do one minute on, 30 seconds off. So you get to go through the motions and do some work. It is good because you are not body building, your are getting the muscle size that is perfect for a swimmer. Running is a great thing to do. Do some distance running to build up some endurance. Good luck!|`|RUBrEPCpaa	Well, I have seen a vest thingies, and it holds you up, and you have to swim, like if you hold your dog above water, and he/she "swims", you couldtry that!
9vq0oSD2aa	I didn't believe it until you said it! I just ran to the TV. Wow, you know, this could work for the Bills because he signed a 1 year deal. But if he doesn't get his catches, and even if he does, the Bills don't win, then it could be bad. But he usually behaves himself for the first year.<br>  <br>  Cheers!|`|IidCp0KDaa	The Bills need some star power, and plus it was a one year deal.  If they don't like him then he's instantly gone.  I see no problems with the deal in any way.  I think overall it'll be good for the Bills.<br>  <br>  To everyone:  Tortuga was just quoting what T.O. said in an interview with playboy magazine when he questioned Garcia's sexuality.  I think any sane person knows that Garcia is straight.  Just look at his wife for example, he's gotta be doing somthing right because she's crazy hot.|`|HiMx0NkPaa	Any Bills fan that doesnt agree with this decision needs watch football at all.<br>  This is the best thing to happen to that franchise within the past 10-15 years.

He's caused problems everywhere he's gone|`|170a76cbeacabb7009b301453f25b9e5aa	T.O will make a mock of Trent Edwards...think about it|`|NG6eeCfuaa	I would have liked it more if JP Losman was still the starting QB. Losman is a laid back So. Cal guy who really is a "happy go lucky" type guy. He never takes the game too seriously. Trent Edwards however, will never cope when T.O gets out of line. I wonder what it'll be this time w/ TO in Buffalo. Lets see, we've had thus far:<br>  <br>  Jeff Garcia was gay<br>  Donovan McNabb was so nervous during the Super Bowl that he could speak to call plays so TO called them in the huddles<br>  Romo had private play calling sessions to freeze him out<br>  <br>  Poor Trent Edwards. This Stanford guy is never gonna know what hit him.|`|RK9bJPOmaa	He might help them out a little bit. But they need a WAY better QB if that will ever work.|`|uGsvU3GCaa	contreversy i agree with you. go chargers. and the bills are cool.<br>  tortuga garcia is sick, he's a man. Quentin JAmmer broke his nose and Garcia was playing the game with blood pouring down his face|`|7B9KEqCnaa	Bills needed star power to sell seats.  Plus they play like what 2-3 games in canada.

I feel sorry for him for all of the the blame and crap he is getting. During season where he's actually healthy, he performs well, always one of the top performing QBs in the league. Yes, he does have consistency problems, but not bad enough where he bombs the entire season away for his team. And he really doesn't have much receivers to work with throughout most of his tenure in Eagles. He's really only got Westbrook to get the load for him. Well.. and maybe TO for the one season.|`|LpR9sLSlaa	He's a good QB, that has consistency problems.<br>  His seasons really tend to be up n down a lot,<br>  you're ever sure which McNabb is going to show up, <br>  and the NFL rewards consistency.<br>  <br>  He's gotten the Eagles into the playoffs a lot, but doesn't have the best record in the playoffs.<br>  I saw him miss some relatively easy passes this January, by a big margin.<br>  <br>  You've got to be hot, the WHOLE month of January.<br>  Warner showed that this year.|`|smFHGStuaa	"Can't win the big one...."|`|1i9mrq5Yaa	yes very under rated

kqP7GwOcaa	Give me the Irishman over the Brit any time.  I have to disagree with the majority on this one.  O'Grady was as tough or tougher than Hatton, had better lateral movement and hand speed, and in truth was a much slicker boxer.  Ricky might have a slight edge in power, but O'Grady would have easily handled the straight ahead pressure Ricky would bring, and I think Sean would have boxed Ricky's ears off.<br>  <br>  O'Grady by a surprisingly wide and comfortable decision.|`|8fa17d06395754a44604a2b42063588daa	The Battle of Tissue Paper.  <br>  <br>  Both fighters bruise easily and have busy styles.  O'Grady would pick Hatton apart and shake him a few times in the first 3 rounds.  Hatton would quickly learn that he can not afford to allow this.  Sean can certainly get your attention with his power shots.  <br>  <br>  Don't let the Mayweather fight fool you.  Hatton can take it on the chin.  His sheer disdain for Floyd had him so tense he burned himself out.  Floyd would have won anyway but Hatton did not fight a smart fight.  <br>  <br>  Ricky would not use his new found skills, courtesy of Pappa Mayweather,  No matter what Big Floyd could teach him Hatton can only change so much.  The mistake would be to stop the "Hitman" from BEING the Hitman.  I think Floyd would figure that out by round 5.<br>  <br>  Hatton begins to put the pressure on Sean.  After 11 rounds Sean looks like he was late for cheese n crackers.................with a bunch of dobermens.  Hatton "roughs him up" a bit and begins to push him.  Sean doesn't give ground but takes a terrible beating for his bravery.<br>  <br>  Good thing for him Ricky can't punch very hard. <br>  <br>  Hatton by clear unanious decision.|`|PIu1ZcYEaa	I totally agree with Blog's answer.(great comment) Sean was the better and slicker boxer. And with Sean's record of 81-wins, 70 of those were ko's. I figure if Mayweather can put Hatton down so can Sean. Sean by Desc. or even ko.|`|dh48AkbCaa	hatton is the naturally bigger man, and and beats ogrady by decision|`|thcr8Y5vaa	Ricky Hatton...|`|Ghiy6Cwlaa	i like sean on this one by 15 ko moved to good to big to fast

PIu1ZcYEaa	Some great points by everyone.This would have been a great fight/matchup.It could go either way.Monzon was a all time great, but so was walker. Carlos has the height/reach advantage and used it very well against smaller oppoenents. But that dosent mean alot when were talking about mickey walker. I ask myself could Monzon have pulled off what Walker did with far heavier opponents? could Carlos have drew with Sharkey? Could Carlos have moved up and got as close as Walker did in the Tommy Loughran bout? (And remember Loughran was a ATG, and when still young and green gave Tunney all kinds of fits.) Watching footage of walker he combined very good footwork with shoulder rolls.Even the great Loughran had a tough time with this.I could see Monzon troubled with it as well<br>  Also Mickey was bull-strong and would move in on the bigger guys and bust their bodies to peices (How he beat the bigger guys he fought) Mickey was one tough, rugged s.o.b. and about one of the better body-bangers ever p4p. And Walkers record for going up against far larger guys is astounding.<br>  I think it would be a close fight. With Carlos being a bit better tactican he could eek out a desc. If he played it smart and kept the 'Bulldog" at bay. But if he(Carlos) started out too slow (and he often did.) Mickey would be on him, in close tearing that body apart, with Carlos finding it too hard to make a comeback. Giving Mickey the win in the mid. to late rounds with a tko.|`|Yg1QR4mmaa	Walker may have fought bigger opponents but he could be outboxed and that is what I see happening. Monzon is durable enough to fight through the blitzs of Walker and punishes him with right hands on the way in and out. Most of the rounds would be close but the cleaner more effective punches would be coming from Monzon and it wouldn't surprise me if he even staggered Walker a few times in this fight.<br>  <br>  My pick is Monzon by a clear UD.|`|kqP7GwOcaa	Walker fought competitively against world class heavyweight opposition during his career, I think as great a middleweight as Carlos Monzon was, the size advantage would work heavily in favor of Walker.  Much like Ray Robinson had trouble with Joey Maxim, I think Micky Walker takes this on grit and size by decision.|`|dh48AkbCaa	monzon by tough decision|`|8fa17d06395754a44604a2b42063588daa	Easier than you think.  Mickey Walker is certainly one of the best of all middleweights.  He's in the second half of the TOP 10.  He ranks that high as long as he stays away from Carlos Monzon. <br>  <br>  Walker would give Monzon ALL KINDS OF HELL in the early going.  However, he would fail to hurt Carlos.  Walker went the route with Jack Sharkey, a full-fledged heavyweight, but Sharkey was no boxer and Mickey was able to score and tough enough to take what Sharkey could land.  <br>  <br>  Still, Monzon was also tough.  He was no killer in the mold of Greb, Ketchel or even Lamotta.  However, he was crafty enough to stop Mickey from doing what he does best.  <br>  <br>  Walker takes the early rounds, giving ground in just a few of them before round 8.  He has a swarming style and that's one way to beat Monzon.  However, you also need a good misture of speed and pressure, where Mickey would fall short.  <br>  <br>  Monzon gets his range and starts to take the later rounds.  He sweeps rounds 10 - 15, nearly taking Walker out in round 14 with his sheer accumilation of punches.  Walker hears the final bell but he's in no shape to make much of it. <br>  <br>  Monzon by clear unanimous decision.|`|thcr8Y5vaa	Mickey Walker...|`|Ghiy6Cwlaa	walker split decision

0dTXkBopaa	catching- throw the ball up in the air then jump and catch it when its coming down.<br>  throwing- go to a bit past the 18 yr box or something close to that and just throw until you get better- try new techniques and yeah. <br>  kicking- just go to a big field, and practice your kicks. Also you should do squats- it helps your muscles to kick better<br>  saving- hit it against a wall and save it. Or if your have a trampoline or those little crazy catchers chuck it at them and dive after it.|`|lkNJNnlSaa	It's extremely hard to work on your keeping skills on your jack. Find some friends to have a kickabout with a couple times a week.<br>  <br>  That's what i do (as well as training) and i'm a top class defender.|`|wurimjbnaa	Well you need to dive when the ball is shot, you as a goal keeper must always come out towards the player when it's 1 on 1 to reduce chances of the person scoring. <br>  <br>  When kicking the ball from the goal kick always lift your leg up to give the ball an upthrust, producing: height, distance and power.<br>  <br>  Practise catching the ball with a friend, then move on to shooting and you must catch the ball from a weak shot. Then you need to throw the ball, keepers can throw it further by doing an overarm throw, this is effective and you must use full power when doing it.<br>  <br>  For saving same as before, ask somone to put weak shots and you must dive left or right to stop the ball. Then start going to stronger shots and see from there.<br>  <br>  I Hope this helps|`|m2zXOREJaa	If you want to practice on your own,i'd advise you to use a brick wall as it's easy to throw where it comes back,kick either side of the wall at any power and when it comes back dive and catch,also for best agility more power on the kicks as the more you save the better you will become.|`|mMovSJ3qaa	Get one of your mates to shoot with no power and tell them when they shoot to chip the ball up and then increase the power|`|O5KOwhovaa	Throw/kick the ball against a wall and practice catching it|`|f6d7c6d91c363f156f7b6ae7975913abaa	ok get one of those nets that make the ball bounce back at you when you throw something at it...if you throw hard enough, it will help you in practicing your throwing and your catching because it will make you have to have fast reflexes to catch the ball on time. As for the kicking, just drop kick into a goal net of there is one available to you...

r5AMG8g7aa	Kung-Fu covers between 300 and 400 different styles. Each is vvery different. Many have no belt ranks system. some use a system of sashes. A few use belts now. Each system/style has its own way of recognizing rank / or proficiency.<br>  <br>  You mention 5th degree black belt and ask is that dragon or Tiger. That phrase makes no sense to me. 5th degree black belt is usually a masters rank in Japanese styles. There is a style of Kung-Fu known as the tiger or sometimes Tiger-Claw. There is also a dragon style of Kung-Fu. These terms have nothing to do with each other.  I hope this helps!|`|hlqj0pvxaa	Chinese arts do not have a ranking system like the Japanese does. <br>  <br>  It is more a title like Junior Brother, Big Brother, Senior Brother, etc. <br>  <br>  Ranking systems like belts and grades are adapted. <br>  <br>  Schools that do adapt ranking all have their own configuration.|`|YDpT2ClBaa	from my understanding not all kung fu systems use a ranking structure like slashes.<br>  kung fu is chinese and they dont use a belt system like the japanese, okinawan or koreon's do, they use slashes.<br>  i believe they state off with color ones similar to the others. the black slash i have seen go as high as 10th degree.<br>  <br>  dragon or tiger are styles and not ranks<br>  <br>  kung fu under a good instructor can be use for self defense.|`|3DnX9NmAaa	They don't use belts like in Japanese martial arts.

lNHqduIQaa	i started running bleachers- running up & down the aisles in the  football stadium bleachers and that really improved my endurance. it also focuses on knee lifts and speed. start out small- with around 1 mile or so and add a little bit more every 2 or 3 times you run them. this really helped me.<br>  good luck :)|`|JNDk1LUmaa	Are you eating before you run? Stomach pain could be from what you eat, how long its been since you've eaten, and how much you bounce when you run. Stay away from dairy....no caffeine...and if you have to eat before you run, do it 2 hrs. before you workout, and make it Oatmeal! yum!|`|eo3lDZDWaa	If it hurts that much, you should probably start smaller.

jSkHquK5aa	1) its not really on just kicking the ball and see how far or how high its thrown. I think that its really the practice you have and how good you are at soccer. Because you can spend years of your life practicing soccer but if you just dont like it or not good at it, you can't do anything about it. And if your life its soccer and that is what you only talk about it with your friends, by having little practice you can really become a high soccer star. <br>  <br>  2) The best way to kick a ball far is all in technique. The most crucial things are when kicking the try to get up under the ball, curve your run like shown. Also, a good angle is abt 45 degrees or somewhere in the middle of 0-90. If your foot hits on top of the ball it will dig into the ground. If you hit it too low it will just go up, but not far.|`|Jxiffj8xaa	ask someone to show you in person. much easier to be honest! <br>  :) hope you get the hang of if soon :)|`|O9Ct72Eyaa	well the way i do it is u come at the ball with a slight angle, strike the ball with your laces, and instead of placing your plant foot right next to the ball plant it a little short not a lot though. This allows your leg to be on the upward part of the swing when you connect with the ball. Also lean back a bit when you strike the ball.|`|IDF1AgIhaa	lean back when you kick it|`|mMovSJ3qaa	Use the side of your foot and when you come to hit it hit under the ball|`|ZmPNvmtkaa	get your foot under the ball

911851b2b251a8cb71cb5ba956d76d89aa	Well he is definitely top two, either him or Pujols.  SS is an extremely thin position and Hanley can put up 100r 30hr 60-70rbi 30sb and hit about .300 from there which is all around balanced stat line and good production while Pujols isn't going to get steals he can hit upwards of .330 and 120 rbi's but you can get Berkman/Feilder/Morneau with your next pick all of whom's stats combine better to any shortshop you would get aside from hanley/reyes/rollins who will all be gone by your next pick. btw even some of the 1b in the later rounds can put up pretty good numbers though if you pick Pujols your best bet is probally to pick up Michael Young later on.|`|pX2ZraBVaa	pretty certain first pick should go to either to hanram or pujols<br>  personally im going to pick him too because is very rare to find a ss that can provide so much offense and still provide decent defense<br>  <br>  also ss is not very deep and this might be a problem if u dont pick him first|`|oblnqjenaa	Yea definitly!

oblnqjenaa	Hey, i'm the exact same way! I'm 12 and i need to get better at hitting. A few tips i've learned: <br>  <br>  ~ Have your knuckles lined up when gripping the bat.<br>  ~ If you take a step when swinging, do NOT step anywhere but straight forward.<br>  ~ Do not bail out on an inside pitch that is not going to hit you. stay in there, swing, and take the sting from the ball hitting the inside part of the bat.<br>  ~ Do not look up when you swing. When most kids hear "keep your eye on the ball," they watch the ball for a little bit and look up when they swing. What you want to do is watch the ball hit the bat. You want to see it hit the bat.<br>  ~ Hit 'em where they aint!<br>  <br>  TeamUSA4Life|`|zSFpcXI5aa	hand eye coordination drills.|`|nDOWKhwCaa	steroids of course!|`|OXHLqBuwaa	Work on Your Forarms.<br>  *tie a rop to a pole that u can hold with ur 2 hands out in front of you<br>  *then tie the bottom of the rop to a weight (any weight of your choice) <br>  *then move ur wrist up and down to role it up

Average MNs go from $60-120 depending on what condition they are in, if they have matching serial numbers etc. <br>  <br>  Also, you will have to decide which model you want. The 91/30 and M44 carbine are probably the most popular, and hence the most widely available. However, you can find all sorts of models if you search the internet, gun shows, gun shops, etc.<br>  <br>  As for ammo, there are oodles of surplus ammo readily available.

If you live in California, Big 5 sporting goods has them. I also heard that you might want to get one made before 1938, as they are nicer and were not used in combat, although it sounds like you want a war era one for the historical aspect of it. The ammo (7.62x54) is very common. I wouldn't say cheap, though, with ammo prices being what they are today. I also hear it has considerable recoil. You might want an m/38 or m/44 model if your son is going to shoot it, as those are the shorter, carbine versions vs the 91/30 which has a 27 inch barrel.|`|5sEgGWJlaa	If you want the best mosins battle rifles ever made you need to look into Finnish M39 rifles.  These rifles were used by the finns in the Winter war prior to WWII.  The finns never made receivers for their rifles, they just used capture Russian receivers and replaced the barrels and improved the sights.<br>  <br>  If you find a antique rifle on the internet (receiver made before 1898) you can have it shipped directly to your door.<br>  <br>  Check out Pat Burns Rifle site at gunsnammo.com  I bought one of her M39 and it by far the best mosins I ever shot.  She have many to chose from and also carries M39s with antique receivers.<br>  <br>  As far as Russian M91/30s I wouldn't by more than 100 total.  You can get a FFL 03 Curio and Relic lic. for $30, good for 3 years, and have old firearms mailed to you dircetly cutting out the transfer cost.  You see Mosins all of the time on sites like jgsales.com and aimsurplus.com for around 59 to 70 dollars.  Shipping runs around 15 dollars.  If you have to you can have on shipped to a ffl in your area and have them transfer it to you, in my area that runs around 15-30 dollars.|`|O3TuQZItaa	First, learn about the guns themselves.

gCPu04gTaa	Interesting ideas.<br>  I presume that you don't want a full lion costume so:<br>  <br>  Step1<br>  Take a light brown-colored hooded sweat suit one size larger than what you usually wear, and turn it inside out. This will serve as your "furry" upper torso. <br>  <br>  Step2<br>  Cut an oval of brown felt or fur, which will be the furry belly. <br>  <br>  Step3<br>  Stitch the felt or bur on with brown thread, or use fabric glue to adhere it. <br>  <br>  Step4<br>  Cut out 2 ear-shaped pieces of felt or fur. <br>  <br>  Step5<br>  Stitch the 2 ears to the top of the hooded sweatshirt. <br>  <br>  Step6<br>  Cut out long strips of felt or fur. Sew them around your face on the hood of the sweatshirt. <br>  <br>  Step7<br>  Sew as many strips as you find visually appealing. The more strips you attach to the hood, the thicker the mane will look. <br>  <br>  Step8<br>  Create a tail for your costume. You can cut out a long strip of fur and sew on small strips at the end for a fringe. <br>  <br>  Step9<br>  Attach the tail to your matching light brown track pants. Put on your pants and shirt. <br>  <br>  Step10<br>  Attach a piece of felt/fur to the top sides of your skates. <br>  <br>  Step11<br>  Slip on a pair of tan-colored mittens to complete your costume. <br>  <br>  For the robot you can hire cheap silver all in one suit from fancy-dress shops.
jSkHquK5aa	How to strike the ball<br>  There are two general types of kicks based on the position of the ball, ground kicks and volleys.<br>  <br>  Ground kicks<br>  In order to produce a quality kick you'll need balance and composure. The placement of your supporting foot is just as important as your other, kicking foot. To control the height of your shot or pass, be aware of where your supporting foot is, in relation to the ball. By placing your supporting foot in line with the ball, you will achieve power while keeping your kick low. By placing it slightly behind, you will produce a rising or lofted ball. Your upper body also plays a role when kicking the ball. When you lean back, the ball will rise and if you lean forward your kick remain low and hard.<br>  <br>  In order to get the maximum power from a strike, the knee of your kicking leg has to be above or in line with the ball at the exact moment you make contact. Follow-through in a sweeping motion in direction of your target. If you have trouble understanding this concept, try landing on your kicking foot after you strike the ball.<br>  <br>  Volleys<br>  When striking the ball in the air, proper balance is essential. Therefore, you need to adapt to the path of the ball by making quick adjustments in your footing. You are ready to swing only after you have positioned yourself at a proper distance from the ball. You should not attempt a volley, if you feel that you are reaching out too far or when the ball is too close to your body for a good swing.<br>  Some situations may require jumping and volleying at the same time. Stay composed and concentrate on timing your leap.<br>      <br>  How to practice kicking<br>  The best way to practice your technique is against a keeper (or a friend) who consistently serves the ball back to you. If that is rarely an option, then any regular wall, ledge or flat surface can work as a replacement. Beginners should work on kicking dead balls (meaning they must trap it before kicking) while advanced players can practice striking the ball without settling it first. Many variations and drills available, such as aiming at a target on the wall or dribbling (in random directions) before you kick. Being able to strike the ball from any situation will improve all aspects of your game which include kicking, for example passing, finishing, clearing and so on. In order to learn the proper mechanics, practice with as few interruptions as possible. Also, look at better or more experienced players and study their technique.<br>   <br>  A friend can be very useful when you're working on your volleys. Ask him to throw the ball at your feet and try to hit it back to his hands. Practicing volleys is slightly more of a hassle when you're alone, but it can be done. Simply toss the ball (or kick it) upwards and strike as it drops down. Stay composed and adjust to it its path. Don't swing desperately if the ball is out of your reach.<br>  <br>  <br>  Different methods of striking the ballInside of the foot (push pass)<br>  Put your supporting foot about 10 cm to the side of the ball with your toes pointed in direction of your target. With your ankle locked at about 90 degrees, bring your kicking leg back and swing through the equator of the ball. Your kicking ankle must be perpendicular to your supporting foot. Contact the ball with the arch of your foot and follow-through in the direction of your target. When well executed, the ball will roll smoothly rather than bounce or skip along the ground.  <br>  <br>  Outside of the foot<br>  When planting your supporting foot next to the ball, your toes have to be directed about 15-30 degrees outward from your target. This will let you drive your other foot straight at the target, hitting the ball with the outside of your laces.  <br>  <br>  Instep drive<br>  Place your supporting foot in line with the ball and toes aimed at your target. Bring your kicking foot back and swing it forward in one swift motion. Don't pause between retracting and extending your leg. Accelerate your foot through the ball, as if it doesn't exist. The toes and the ankle of your kicking foot should be stretched and locked. To keep the shot low, meet the ball at the equator or slighly above it. Lean forward and keep your shoulders over the ball. Strike it with the inside of your shoelaces and follow through in the direction of your target.  <br>  <br>  Inside curve<br>  Position your supporting foot to the side of the ball with toes aimed at your target or slightly to the side of it. Swing forward with your kicking foot and meet the ball with the upper part of your big toe. "Slice" the ball not in the center but low on the outside, so that a spin will be produced. Follow through in the direction of your swing, not directly towards your target.  <br>  <br>  Outside curve<br>  If you're kicking the ball with your right foot put your supporting foot on the left side of the ball or vice versa. The toes of your supporting foot should be aimed at your target or slightly to the side, in the direction of the curve. Bring your kicking foot back and swing forward a|`|7e6ZjOqiaa	damnnn dude<br>  i dont think it would matter though<br>  how tall are you?|`|6y9Bqok9aa	i have size 13,im 13 and 6ft.<br>  <br>  size of your foot wouldn't matter, not unless you want to do a banana kick. then you need a smaller foot.

jSkHquK5aa	Becoming a soccer player requires a lot of hard work and dedication. If you want to play professional soccer, you must really really want it. It is much harder to enter the professional world of sports, but it can be done. You are going to need the right equipment, coaches, determination, and support from family and friends if you are serious about becoming a soccer player. Here are some guidelines that will help with the process, from the early years all the way to adulthood.<br>  <br>  Step 1<br>  Buy a soccer ball for your child and begin kicking it around with him as early as you can. This will help get your child use to the idea of the sport of soccer. Spend some time each afternoon playing with your child so he understands what practice is like. <br>  <br>  Step 2<br>  Sign your child up for a pee-wee soccer team and allow him to work his way up. Having him join a team when he is young is important. It will get him use to the rules of the sport as well as the competition aspect of it. <br>  <br>  Step 3<br>  Start having a child work out at least five days per week. This is important to do once your child reaches the age of 12. He will need to be in good physical shape if he wants to continue to play soccer at his best and be able to compete with others. <br>  <br>  Step 4<br>  Register your child at some summer soccer camps. These camps are designed to help your child improve on the technical aspects of soccer. Your child can learn new moves that will really help improve his game. <br>  <br>  Step 5<br>  Once a soccer player is in his teen years, he should hire a private coach. If he is serious about playing soccer professionally, he will want to hire a private coach to help him hone his skills. <br>  <br>  Step 6<br>  Attend professional soccer games. Don't just watch professional games on television, attend some in person. These events will evoke the feeling of what it would be like to play a professional game. Games might also offer the chance to talk with professional soccer players. <br>  <br>  Step 7<br>  Research and then attend colleges that are known for their soccer teams. Scouts are not going to be looking for future soccer stars among small town college teams. An aspiring soccer player needs to get in to a school that is going to get him some exposure. <br>  <br>  Step 8<br>  Watch for soccer try-outs. This can be for semi-professional teams. A player may need to work his way in to a professional team by starting with a semi-pro team first. Scouts will also be watching these teams to find new talent. <br>  <br>  Step 9<br>  Get contact information for the professional teams. Send them a video. If coaches watch it and like it, they may just give you a call and ask you to come try out.|`|pSpWOsiQaa	practice,practice,practice. even if your not playing a game, go to a park by yourself run with the ball a lot|`|n9eG4Zguaa	Practice:<br>  buy cones, practice dribbling around them<br>  go on youtube, learn some simple but effective tricks (Scissors, stepover, etc.)<br>  find a wall, kick a ball against it.  Start with unlimited touch, then two touch, then one touch (go to one touch if your first touch is already good).<br>  Workout:<br>  Run every day.  Stamina (endurance) is one of THE most important parts of soccer.  A decent player can make the Varsity team if they have good endurance.<br>  Do Ab work, and leg work, and some upper body work too.  Suprisingly, upper body work is important also.... but not as important as the leg and ab work.|`|DIG78Pcvaa	wanna know how? first dribble with the ball up and down the field. second learn how to take shots. your foot should strike the ball with your laces either the middle or middle-top part of the ball. third learn how to AIM! learning how to aim is a key feature in soccer! different angles make the ball bend differently keep that in mind.<br>  <br>  learn easy tricks such as the "L" or stop and reverse. etc..

mMFJrPbvaa	Ocala National Forest would probably be your best bet.  Theres a few good lakes inside that have really nice areas to pitch a tent and the lakes definitely produce good size bass.  It`s about a 5 mile hike in to the lake which isnt bad at all especially since it is all flat.  But Ocala is definitely your best bet since its about 45 minutes outside of Orlando|`|aJp3BbWcaa	this will help you <a href="http://www.elmonterv.com/rv-rentals-orlando/rl-40.aspx" rel="nofollow">http://www.elmonterv.com/rv-rentals-orla...</a>

95bb76d0439c02bb72678f77c90632acaa	I could simply be condensation on the tarp. That pool water is cold right now. If it's cooler than your air temps, it will condense water vapour out of the air and form on the tarp.<br>   To find out, simply take a piece of tape and mark the current level. If it drops more than 1/8 inch over night, yes...a leak. I'm giving you a 1/8 th margin of error here because the pool may evaporate a bit.|`|2VCYL0F3aa	sounds like you have a leak but on way to find out for sure.stop adding water measure the water depth wait a day or so measure again at the same point and compare measurements if pool is leaking finding it is the hard part(or cold part)put on a swim mask swim around looking for holes in the liner get a small bottle of food color or dye when you find what looks like a hole put some dye on the hole if it goes into the hole you found a leak now all you need to do is patch the hole|`|hMF3kg3Baa	It is just march and you are putting up a pool? Anyway you may have a hole in your liner they have patches for that at every wal mart or pool supply place.

Cl6KbcAGaa	You passed on the left when it was safe to do so and you have absolutely nothing to worry about doing this. You will not get a ticket, and there is absolutely nothing for you to worry about at all. Edit: McG you make a good point and I am only assuming that the merge was done in a safe manner then this would likely be overlooked even if it were witnessed but every case is different and time will tell....?|`|WAGpAh8oaa	bikers have the same rights to the road as motor vehicles. they also have same rules as motor vehicles. you  shouldnt pass them. it is illegal to cross double yellow. and how the hell do you do it safely? i hope you get a ticket. serves you right|`|DOVbF4Piaa	I would not worry about it, you are very courteous about passing a cyclist and the cop would recognize this.

You can't safely pass bikers without going into the other lane and you aren't expected to go 10 MPH...|`|CttL3LmBaa	By the letter of the law, a bicycle has the same rights to the lane as any motor vehicle.  Two abreast in some states is also legal and the bicycles do not have to vacate the lane for the automobile.  If it is a double yellow line -- by the letter of the law -- you are not allowed to pass by taking the oncoming lane.  Sorry for those that opine otherwise, as that is the law.  <br>  <br>  It is a totally different question regarding if you will get in trouble.  That is up to the law enforcement witnessing your driving.  Chances are if you did the pass in a otherwise safe manor the officer would probably disregard the double yellow.  If you had to pass where your right side tires had to go left of the double yellow and oncoming traffic had to slow or swerve to avoid you -- expect a ticket in violation of Georgia code 40-6-42 Improper Passing.  If you get some slack and slide on it, take a deep breath and drive on.<br>  <br>  As to the price of the fine, $40 to $60 depending on circumstances: <br>  <a href="http://www.ci.savannah.ga.us/RecordersCourt/RC-WebFAQ.nsf/212e53c61a69275c85256ad2006b0eb1/281a8ae6ed91e99885256ad20063591d?OpenDocument" rel="nofollow">http://www.ci.savannah.ga.us/RecordersCo...</a><br>  <br>  The number of points on your license is either 3 or 4 (speeding and less than 19 mph over the speed limit is only 2).<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.ms-firm.com/georgia_points_system_for_traffic_violations.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.ms-firm.com/georgia_points_sy...</a><br>  <br>  So if the officer takes your actions seriously, you could get hammered with $60 + court costs, and 4 points on your license.  At 6 points in 2 years, you have to take remedial drivers education.  At 12 points you loose your license for 2 years.
NRg4dreTaa	The ball consists of two rubber hemispheres joined together under pressure ( or using a chemical decomposition process to form internal pressure)so that the 'core' formed has a specified resilience and gives the finished ball its required properties. The fabric is first woven using cotton as a backing (warp)and a wool / nylon for the covering (weft). After felting the fabric is dyed and finished before transportation to a ball making plant. Two 'dog bones' of fabric are cut after application of a latex backing and stuck to the latex covered core - the 'ball' is then cured and the result is a proper tennis ball. Finally logos are applied and the ball packed under pressure to preserve its internal pressure. <br>  Modern balls are made from rubber mixed with 14 to 18 chemicals to get the proper consistency. Approximately 85% of the ball weight is the rubber/chemical mix. Over 90% of tennis balls are produced in Southeast Asia where the natural resource is abundant. The most expensive ingredient in the ball is the felt, which is adjusted in various ways to produce different properties. Steaming the felt raises its nap to make it fluffier, which increases wind resistance and control (through increased resistance when striking the players' rackets) while reducing bounce and speed. A compact nap causes the ball to skip on hitting the court or a racket.|`|mgkjqIqUaa	Fuzz and a lot of hot air juice and some rubber and some donkey poo<br>   and
HlD9dRF2aa	Martial arts = conflict resolution.<br>  First action is to avoid conflict.  This means avoid using martial arts unless you see no other way.  A) Your life isn't worth any amount of money you're carrying and neither is the other person's. B)  A kick or ridge hand to the temple to someone that is untrained can be fatal.<br>  <br>  Marine corps martial arts.  MMA or Tae Kwon Do to get you in shape and balance -- just aim for the knee and collapse the leg.  Wrestling or grappling such as Gracie Jujitsu is another option.  90% of all fights end up on the ground--fancy kicks and punches don't do as much as a good choke hold or a thumb to the adams apple so find a martial arts that combines long, short and close combat styles.  Kung Fu styles are a good blend.|`|5Aw8zfruaa	No need for MA.Kick em in the balls and leg it. If you're after some super secret move that you can "Put a beat down" on someone, then you're asking the wrong question|`|CMUMhXaiaa	If you aren't afraid of getting bruised up at boxing lessons, I'd go for those with some simple American karate on the side. I took USA Karate, which is just a fighting/grappling system developed by some 1970's karate instructor. But learning quickness and dodging blows is very important, that's why I think you should take it. Take boxing lessons to learn how to connect a blow with power, and actually compete against others your age to eventually develop your own method of kicking ***.|`|j0oAmuycaa	you sound pretty tough already..but get in a class like karate or boxing and find one you enjoy going to,,and be good at what you do and be able to hit #$%& hard. ( working your heavy bag and lifting weights).  You'd be suprised at what a basic punch combo and kick between legs or to knee will do to someone.<br>  most of all, enjoy it.|`|Vr9i1yRiaa	Work out in the gym enough and NOBOBY will mess with you.|`|df412c3bb405234c8f6a8353600d0b23aa	muay thai or jiujitsu.  Depends on what you are more comfortable with, both are excellent and have been battle tested|`|bkeA5NMzaa	if its a life and death fight kick to the balls gouge to the eyes and run, repeat until other guy is blind and/or immobile.  Krav maga and system are the two most know self defense martial arts is there's a gym near you that trains one of those you might enjoy that.  I have been doing muay thai and it is pretty awesome i think.  A grappling marital art is also very handy.  I think the most underestimated one is judo, you throw someone on concrete they are pretty much down.  So in my opinion i would say you should do systema for self defense it uses the environment around you a bit as a weapon i believe. good luck and stay in shape
