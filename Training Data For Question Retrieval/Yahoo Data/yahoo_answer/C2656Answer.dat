Je pense que certaines personnes aiment leurs animaux autant que leurs enfants (si ce n'est parfois plus) parce qu'ils les traitent comme leurs enfants : c'est  dire qu'ils se sentent tellement responsables d'eux, de leur confort, de leur bonheur, qu'ils finissent par s'en occuper exactement de la mme manire. Et il faut reconna?tre que parfois les animaux rendent davantage  "leurs parents" que les enfants : pas d'insulte, pas d'ingratitude, reconnaissance et affection vidente.... et donc les parents obtiennent enfin tout ce qu'ils n'ont pas pu avoir parfois avec leurs propres enfants.|`|UPdheSlAaa	Je suis mre et depuis que ma fille est dcde j'aime ma chienne comme un enfant, c'est grace  elle que j'ai pu sumonter l'enfer.... avant de dire que vous trouvez ? inou?, il faut voir tous les cas de figure, cas par cas, je prcise que je n'ai pas fait de " transfert " sur ma chienne, mais son amour m'a fait me raccrocher  la vie, soutien que je n'ai pas trouv chez les humains qui se contentent de dire qu'avec le temps tout passe !! choque cendrillon ??|`|V1RN7UKXaa	oui je trouve ca normal !|`|db392f14b9d9198f7a521d229fb93fb7aa	Je pense qu'il y a un soucis dans ce genre de comportement.

Ceux qui font vivre leur chien comme s'il tait humain ont un problme psychologique, ils ne diffrencient pas l'aniaml et l'humain, or l'animal n'a pas le mme mode de vie que l'humain. Le chien ne doit pas manger et dormir avec son maitre, cela fait de lui un dominant; mais le chat ne fonctionne pas pareil, s'il dort dans le lit de son maitre, ?a ne fait pas de lui un dominant pour autant, les chats ne fonctionnant pas sur le principe de la soumission/ domination.    En revanche, les animaux font souvent partie intgrante de la famille, nous dpensons des sommes folles pour eux, ils nous font rire, nous font pleurer, nous nous inquitons pour eux, quitte  n'en plus dormir... Pour ma part je ne "considre" pas mes animaux comme mes enfants parce que je sais faire la diffrence entre animal et humain,  mais ils ont autant de valeur  mes yeux que s'ils taient mes enfants, ?a c'est certain!    Les personnes ages parfois considrent leur petit chien comme leur enfant parce qu'elles se retrouvent seules, et cet animal est la seule prsence qui leur reste  la maison; elles font donc un amalgame; mais ce n'est pas pour autant qu'il faille les blamer pour cela.    Et puis, certaines personnes ont tendance au contraire a sous-estimer la valeur de la vie animale. Pour certains, les animaux s'apparentent  des objets, et leur vie ne vaut pas grand chose, et dans ce cas c'est certainement encore pire !!!!!!!!!!! Rsultat : abandons !!!

ZFk0uZTtaa	You said your dog never was aggressive with other kids.  Do you really think it would be fair to your dog and daughter if you put the dog to sleep.  You need to try all avenues to train him better.  You really need to go to a trainer and do everything exactly as they say.  If you just cannot keep her and can't devote that much time to get her better, find a no-kill shelter. She can be placed in a family with no small kids.  You can also keep her away when you have small company.  This really can be rectified, please don't give up on her!!  You need to get more than one opinion and include trainers, not just behavioralists.  She has been a good companion and family member and she probably felt that your daughter was threatened.  She is probably defending her favorite person.  I also know from my uncle,  your daughter(even as an adult)  will have a hard time forgiving you with this.  The same thing happened to my uncles childhood dog and he is 41 and still does not forgive that and he was 6.  Worst case seniorio if I wasin your position,  I would get training but if it did not work I would keep the dog because it has been devoted and loyal to the family(your daughter especially).  She has not been any threat to your family so the only thing you would have to do is keep her away from young visitors.  I do not think this is a reason to put her to sleep,  that is permanent.  You can just be responsible and not let her around young visitors she does not know>      I read it all over again and I really think that this boy probably in the past proked the dog somehow.  Maybe the kid is at fault oand your dog was trying to protect everyone including your other dog.  No matter what training does or the behaviorilist says, don't let this kid around your dog,EVER!  Ther is a reason why she feels that way only about him and it probably is not your dogs fault.  He sounds like a wonderful family pet,  please get that option of killing him or getting rid of him out of your head:(|`|eWpeQBDTaa	This is a situation that could get worse.  The trouble with hitting the dog after the incident is that they will not always associate the hurt with the aggressive behaviour.  Yo will then get a vicious circle of her being aggressive and hitting and her not learning.  I would reccomend a head collar on the dog so that you are able to take control gently.  When she is around the child it is important she is under complete control.  Speak with the child and see if there is anything they do that could cause the problem.  Some dogs will react to something a person has eaten or been in contact with.  You could also find that this is a jealousy problem.  You behaviourist will need a detailed description of the indcident and your response.  They will also need details about the dogs health and daily routine as well as any other problems they may have such as illness or recall or pulling on the lead.  Make the most of their evaluation as they are normally really worth the money.  Finally don't feel guilty if you do feel the best course of action is putting the dog to sleep but try every other option first|`|5O7op0oIaa	Your dog has not bitten anyone. Putting her down would be hugely unfair.    If you really can't go to the bother of working through this problem, have her rehomed.|`|d8fSVX23aa	until you can get to the bottom of her change in personality you should make her wear a mussel around others,     is it a behaviour problem, or is she ill, ear infections can make a dog very grumpy    has something happened to your dog involving a child you don't know about     Don't put her down until you have checked every last things.    or re-home her through a rescue that knows she is like this with children and find her a new home away from them.    BUT KEEP CHILDREN SAFE FROM HER UNTIL YOU DECIDE WHAT TO DO    good luck|`|AA11900069	I wish you had been more succinct and used some paragraphs!         Obviously, you cannot let a dog maul a child.  This isn't Borat-Land my friend.  If you cannot keep your dogs away from any kids then you cannot have the dogs.  If you can keep them apart, you CAN have the dogs.  It will take eternal vigilance, to make sure there is always a bolted door between the dogs and any child who visits you.  If you can do that, keep your dogs!|`|3AXlgGgUaa	I think you need to learn how to add details to a single post instead of making several separate posts...|`|dWed21jUaa	Calm down. If you're that scared get a muzzle. My dog Duke would attack me almost daily until I figured out how to handle him.    First get a muzzle, a basket one, not a nylon. When out in public, children are near, etc have it on her.     Look up Nothing in Life is Free- practise this with her. If that means you have to hand feed her and make her sit or lay down for every bite, so be it.    Excersise, how long is she taken for a walk ? (a walk, not let loose in a yard, but a walk. I had to take Duke for 2 hour HIKES daily so he'd calm down)    Training, do you do any of that with her? If not get yourself a bag of treats and start working on the basics.    Don't ever hit her again though. Hitting an aggressive dog will only make matters worse. And for the love of dog don't listen to any advise about the dog whisperer. He scares the dogs into listening to him. Nothing in life is free and positive reinforcement training is the way to go. Trust me on this.    Almost forgot, think back on the incident, nevermind what the child was dong, what did your dog do? Did she stiffen up, her ears go back, tail up? Did she whine/yip, make any sort of noise? Keep a close eye on her body language. She'll tell you when she's getting ready to. Duke for instance, he start out with a really high pitched whine. Or if he was guarding something, he'd lower his body, his ears would go back, and his tail would stiffen and go up.     When you figure out the signs, correct her before she does anything, say her name loudly (make a clapping noises somthing) and shove a treat/toy under her nose to get her attention on you, then tell her to do something (sit/laydown)
gaTIey7baa	I think a black jacket would be fine it is what i wear! Have fun!    To all the people who covered this question with abuse, could you PLEASE just leave off.

Do not be so cowardly as to abuse people on Yahoo answers, when they just genuinely want a question answered. It was about what to WEAR, for goodness sake!

Foxes are sneaky little critters that often eat eggs you use for food.  Think about it...    Edit...Also, foxes do kill other animals.  If the wern't fought off by famers and all, you may not have any chicken or eggs to eat...but of course that's no big deal because foxes are cute and cuddley and deserve to kill our food that they won't even eat...lets see you say that when you have no food to eat!  (yes, I did overexaggerate this a bit)|`|AA11900069	The only other thing you need, is to abandon your sensiblities.  Animal cruelty is linked to violence to children and child abuse, and physical abuse of partners.  Obvious really, when you fail to empathise with the plight of the fox.|`|mfXDUkRYaa	Go nude.    It does make me laugh when people say anti-hunters are townfolk. I live in the country! And when I lived in a town, there were much more foxes! Humans cause much more destruction. All you need to do is look after your livestock properly, but that's probably to much to ask from people who obviously don't care about animals. Would you prefer if all our native wildlife was wiped out? What a nice world that would be!    You do realise that it does nothing to affect the fox population don't you? It's just a fun trip for the blood thirsty! Have fun!    Foxes are great. Long live the fox.|`|bE1AuHORaa	I believe it's scarlet, maybe to hide the blood. And even if foxes are vermin, which is a debatable issue, there is no excuse to rip them apart in a sporting activity.      Actually as one of the narrow minded, nutter townies being referenced here, I must just add, that as a townie, I know very well of the damage foxes may do. There are hundreds of foxes in my locale and they can be a ruddy nuisance. However, as a narrow minded nutter, I do not see how ripping one or two of them to shreds and calling it sport is acceptable. If they are vermin, then humanely cull them. Don't rejoice in their demise and call it sport. That is the real narrow minded, nutter mindset.    In response to see arr harr.    You can have no way of knowing that the foxes neck is broken quickly. It might well be torn apart while still alive. The screams suggest this is so at least some of the time. Hunting certainly is not the best way of controlling the fox population. It dispatches a single fox at a time. And while I concede their are problems with shooting and snaring, there is no reason why other more humane methods like that used for other vermin cannot be used.  And even if it does have to be that foxes are culled, it is immoral to turn it into a sport and glorify that need.|`|uec7RIhbaa	just ignore all the narrow minded anit hunting fools!!!!  i mourn the day fox hunting was banned in the uk.  anyhoo, i believe it's a tweed jacket, i'm not sure if this changes later as i'm no expert.  all the rest sounds just fine as far as i know.  have a great time|`|8eyIcLc4aa	I am totally against hunting cute Foxes....But then again glad to help.

I would check what type of hunt your going to be attending, if it's a formal hunt, you'll need a black and for a cubbing/autumn hunt you'll need a tweed :)|`|0j453WcMaa	Try a noose ..........|`|SzW9GmRsaa	*rolls eyes*    Ahem!    Yes, buff/beige jodhs, long boots and a stock are correct.  The jacket depends on a lot of things, including your age: a lot of packs like juniors to ride in tweed all season, and if you have a native pony, they're often ridden in tweed all year too.  A lot of it does depend on the pack, though.  Best thing you can do is ask the person who invited you, or phone the secretary if you can.  Hunt secs tend to be approachable people and absolutely don't mind answering a few questions on etiquette especially for a first timer!  (Also - a lot of hunts run newcomers days.  These are far more laid back and give you a chance to see what goes on and let you make a few mistakes before you're hunting proper - check if your local packs are doing this!)    The most important thing you can do is to stay well back from the master, and keep out the way of his staff.  They are all there for a good ride but the staff have a job to do and don't want to have to deal with lunatic horses with no brakes!  (I nearly got myself barred for whizzing past the master - luckily I was 10 and on an unstoppable pony, it's quite unforgivable in most circumstances.)    If you are unfortunate enough to meet sabs, the best thing to do is ride past.  They will hurl vile abuse at you, but really you're best just riding on and trying to ignore them.    Good luck, and have fun.    Edit: for those who don't know (either because they assume, or have been persuaded by the LACS etc.) foxes are not ripped apart by hounds when still alive.  The neck is broken very quickly and sharply by a single hound - *then* the fox is torn apart, after it has already been killed.  Hunting is the best way of controlling the fox population.  Shooting requires a very accurate man with a good gun; if the fox is wounded but not killed, it will die slowly and painfully.  Snaring, gassing and lamping are all far far worse.  We do not mind that you don't know the facts - what we mind is you insulting us and refusing to be told the facts.|`|s89zZCWcaa	I HEARD THAT THERE IS A HUNTER TYPE SPORT WHERE YOU RIDE AND JUMP THE HORSES.    OFCOURSE DOGS ARE MORE THAN WELCOME !!!    BUT DUMP THE FOX HUNTING .......    THERE IS NO SPORT FOR A DOZEN DOGS TO RUN DOWN AND EXHAUST A FOX.....ONLY FOR IT TO BE RIPPED APART....    PLEASE RECONSIDER AND FIND THE OTHER SPORT I SUGGESTED.  |`|cIBDSGvsaa	Starting from top to toe. Hard hunting Bowler hat, if your hair is longish, wear a hair net, white shirt with stock and stock pin (usually gold), I always wore a black fitted jacket with red lining, cream breeches, laced and a pair of long boots. A pair of short roweled spurs, good strong string gloves especially if you don't have rubber reins. Carry a hunting whip. Be prepared for a strong sherry at the meet! If your horse is a kicker, tie a red ribbon at the top of his tail. Hounds are called "hounds" not the hounds or dogs!  Tweed is OK for the cubbing season (pre-hunting) and put a hanky in you pocket. If it's your first time hunting, be prepared to be "blooded" You will have the dead fox's blood from a paw dabbed on your face. If hounds are behind you and need to get passed, pull over and shout "hounds please"|`|HM1kA77baa	Well, there is a fine collection of nutters out and about on here. These are people that live in a city and have no idea about the damage that foxes do.  If you are going cubbing, you wear ratcatcher which is your tweeds, horses remain unplaited. Black boots are fine, most people will wear spurs, stock pin, buff jods are fine.  When the season starts, you then need to plait the horse up, white or buff jods, black or navy jacket, black boots, white stock and of course your hat.  If you are in any doubt about your horse kicking in company, tie a red ribbon to it's tail - major faux pas if your horse kicks someone or even worse a hound.  I used to hunt with the Brocklesby and then with the Cowdray, Chid and Lec in England and loved it. Have a great time and tell the hunt sabs to kiss your ***.|`|sqso3NKKaa	I live in the country and yes they are vermin but still deserve the right to be culled in a proper manner and not ripped to death by a pack of hounds, my ex-husband is a gamekeeper and i agree they require to have some control of the amount around but doing what your doing is inhumane and deserves to be banned throughout the whole of the british isles. Yes i have seen the havoc they can cause and unnecessary kills they do|`|YP5b7a3xaa	you dont go fox hunting at all .. they are not vermin .. its there way of life .. andd there are defenceless agaisnt u and all ur little dogs shredding them apart .. u could wear a t-shirt saying that u enjoy chasing and killing animals for fun .... its not really fun if u think about it .. it would be different if u were horse hunting etc !!!    i dont get you people !!!!    oh and dont think u could post this and not get ant hunting posts becos most of the population despise this sport !
44Wu02QBaa	From the description you've given I would recommend a ferret.  Ferrets are extremely social and lovable animals who aren't biters and will play with you to your heart's content. Ferrets want nothing but to be your friend!      Ferrets can get along with dogs or cats and if they don't get along they will have no problem getting away from them when the ferret is out of its cage.  You would never have to worry about losing your ferret though, as they will always come back to you for more play time!     But remember, never leave your ferret out of his cage if he is unsupervised. They can get into things and possibly get hurt.  If you are around though feel free to give your ferret the run of the house!      The only downside to ferrets is that they CAN smell, but that is only if you neglect to clean the change regularly.  You can purchase a liquid that you put in their water that helps decrease odor from waste and most ferrets come descented when you buy them.  Ferrets can also be trained to go into a litter box.  If they do this and you empty the litter box regularly you should have no problem with smell.    Good luck!|`|AA11900069	A Python!  |`|RF02U7NUaa	Get a Russian dwarf hamster.

Rats like to live with each other also, but need bigger cages. However they are more sociable than smaller rodents    so i would definitely say best guinea pig or mini lop bunny!!!|`|UOgefwp9aa	a hamster.because they sleep all day unless u want to wake them.so they wont be lonely when your away and the a cool|`|fLKhh655aa	I have 2 rats and my mum has 8 and not one has ever bitten...they are funny and ver sociable do need some love and attention. I dont recomend a hamster as they can bite and if un tame can just hide in their bed all the time (boring) I don't think mice is a good idea either..  they really do smell and most are very shy. I also have two ferrets and dont think you should get one of them as much as I love mine they are a handfull. they smell and can bite when playing rough! I would choose a rat they truly are a loving animal. you would need two animals which ever you choose so they have company. You can also litter train rats (like mine) which makes for easy cleaning and do not need messy sawdust. hope i helped|`|54DOIwyzaa	Well, if you'd like something cuddly that doesn't bite, I do think a pair or trio of male rats would be good for you. They don't need you there all day because they have each other, but will love out of cage time exploring or simply getting cuddled by you. I recommend males because although their.. err, parts.. are rather large, they're the lazier and laid back gender. I'm also still at school and I'm planning to get rats after I move. They're not the easiest pets to look after because they need a lot of space and a rather unique diet, but I think it'd be worth it.    I also recently got a syrian hamster. He's a darling, too. He never bites, but doesn't really like to cuddle. He'd rather explore and go behind desk drawers then proceed to fall asleep and refuse to come out for a while xD He also feels the need to run on TOP of his wheel, instead of in it. Hamsters are cute, not a lot of work, but also don't thrive on attention or aim to please. Plus, if you get your hamster from a crappy pet store, it won't be socialized well and probably WILL bite you.|`|1RTrlQcpaa	rats are overrall best.
gzx4YeK1aa	An adult Rats would be notably bigger than a mouse...If they are 'wild' rat-s or mice then no I wouldn't keep them, if you can't ring yourself to trap or poison or 'kill' them or call in an 'exterminator' ....Then there's the option of humane traps OR do a search for 'bucket trap' and make your own - simple and effective. Once 'caught as mentioned you will need to take a few miles away to release as they WILL try their best to get back to their 'home' and familiar territory.."rats are notorious disease spreaders and are also incontinent " This is wrong. Rats aren't incontinent but will 'mark' what they consider their territory...rats or mice in a kitchen aren't good - If you haven't already make sure all food is secure in air tight containers, block up /fill in any visible holes / 'entrances' make sure your kitchen is stupidly clean - no crumbs - easy food and generally make their life difficult. They're more likely to go for food in traps humane or otherwise once this is done, it's a pain but really makes a difference. One other thing I did - had mice in the house we moved into - was to take the bottoms off the kitchen cupboards and squirt neat bleach under there ( once I'd cleaned it out under there all - yuk - mouse poop) and leave it - discouraged them from using under the cupboards as a 'run' and brought them out into the open - and into traps placed alongside the wall. Hope some of that helps you !  |`|a4e950b61cb1447e34460ba0d35e5f08aa	try opening the back door and see if it wants to leave that way.|`|TRgc8Wvwaa	you're gonna fix that rat, that's what you're gonna do, you're gonna fix that rat.    http://uk.youtube.com/watch?v=4u9a6l54id...|`|f101Liydaa	plz dont kill it!!  trap it with a cage and then take it some where FAR AWAY|`|RuZ5tLSYaa	ok first a mouse not a mice and you can buy humane mouse/rat traps a wal-mart superstore or a doller store. |`|3aaf6ebe08937cd16bf94a6a8ed8f64faa	You need to get the council in or the landlord if it is not council property, to get rid of this for you once and for all.|`|OCgZACJqaa	They say where  you see one rat/mouse there are lots  more you don't see.

It has a little trapdoor and everything.    IF you want to keep it then i would take it to a vet first, to make sure it doesnt have rabies and/or any other diseases.    If it IS wild, then i would not recommend keeping it but i guess you could.    Good Luck!|`|oEM2YL6Laa	It's probably a wild rat- and no you can not keep it in a box as it is not domesticated and would probably die of stress-related heart failure if you tried doing this. Furthermore as it is a wild rat it can be carrying all sorts of nasty diseases!     Rats are territorial and it's not going to want to move out of a centrally heated home with food on tap! Therefore if you don't want to poison it then you will need to buy a humane trap- bait it with a bit of chocolate :) then you will need to get in the car and drive around 5 miles away before releasing it. Any less then that and it will come right on back again as they have a surprising sense of direction and you will just keep on having to do it.     Alternatively you could poison it- However this is only advisable if you don't have any pets or children or are able to put the poison in an area where it can't be disturbed. Be aware though that the rat may well die under a cupboard or somewhere you might find or be able to smell so you will need to be prepared for this.     What ever you do decide to do you need to make sure you do it quickly as rats are notorious disease spreaders and are also incontinent so the longer they are there the more likely you are to come down with something and the more rat urine gets spread around your home!|`|lYLUwM8Jaa	Please trap it humanely and take it far away from your place and release it, don't keep it.|`|INzs3XJkaa	my daughter had a rat in her kitchen it was living in her cooker were its warm we put poison down we have never heard or seen it again she had to buy a new cooker and we have also put a jml plugin they have a high pitch mice and rats dont like you also need to find out were they are coming from because you could end up with a few more with the weather getting colder|`|5291a9a99454d23e77cfc29e0c5f7e95aa	first you have to get a humane trap and catch them dint keep them if they are wild let them go free but not in your garden a field or woods will do if they are tame then keep them  |`|aI1xCe9Laa	Well I think you should catch it using a humane trap. And then let them go free. He might have come in to your house for warmth. Also they are harmless and are more scared of you then you are of him. That's why he ran to a corner. Also when you trap it maybe you should keep it in the box and go to a forest or somewhere like that but not Your garden or any one Else's garden cause it will just walk back in to the house and then you will be doing the same thing over and over again.

bd66294f5b010757f7e834890feae1d3aa	A hoarder is a person who takes in a lot of dogs yet cannot properly feed them or give them vet care. These dogs wind up being chained to a small area. Because the hoarder does not have enough time to care for all the animals they do not get fresh water or fed more than once in a while usually with food scraps or cheap dogfood.    I have 7 Chihuahuas and a Redbone Hound plus 2 cats. My small dogs eat Purina O.N.E. and the hound gets Purina Dog Chow. The cats get a combo of Purina Cat Chow and Meow Mix Variety.  They all get their shots yearly and are taken to the vet if anything happens regardless of the cost.     In WV there has been several cases of animal hoarding with neglect and abuse. Some were dogs- 20 or more, one was all cats over 50, I think, and one was a horse hoarder.     So as long as your dogs are healthy and well-cared for then you are not a hoarder. However unless you are a  breeder you should have your dogs spayed or neutered as a preventive. It will save cost on vet bills because it will prevent certain cancers and health problems plus the dogs will live longer.|`|5bd3e0303eb54c7ab326f114e79329e9aa	I don't think that it is just the quantity, it is also the quality that you invest in your dogs.  As long as they are all well cared for and not over-running your property you are good.|`|nhnL6ygfaa	It depends on the state. I belive in florida its 5 and its around the same for other states|`|AA12136244	A hoarder has any number of dogs and (here's the key) they live in horrible condition BECAUSE of the number of dogs. Also if a person supposedly is trying to foster dogs or help them otherwise by taking them in but never tries to place them that would also be considered a hoarder. You may have 7 or even 70 dogs and as long as you take proper care of them you wouldn't be a hoarder. Just like people in Alaska with 50 sled dogs aren't hoarders (well most of them).|`|ddf03b3b1b0f092aa23c64758a85a19baa	If two is company and three is a croud,  four or more must be a hoard!|`|e1c3dcae98896e570e91902828751e01aa	It depends what purpose you have them for.  7 is reasonable for hunting/working dogs, it's excessive for pets.  I'd think they'd be happier if they had fewer canine companions and more human attention.|`|AA11603761	The following criteria are used to define animal hoarding:        * More than the typical number of companion animals      * Inability to provide even minimal standards of nutrition, sanitation, shelter, and veterinary care, with this neglect often resulting in starvation, illness, and death      * Denial of the inability to provide this minimum care and the impact of that failure on the animals, the household and other family members.    Hoarding is sometimes considered a mental illness.|`|AA11743129	The fact that you are asking the question suggests you are not.|`|dfbfdcf9b2aafeca1078702e876fd283aa	only 1|`|AA11244754	It depends on how many you are legally allowed to have in the city or town that you live in.|`|f8be0a59f4ae196fee609c52bd995808aa	More than 5 dogs and I would consider a person a "collector...or hoarder".

j8qCtJK3aa	Apart from the warm fuzzy reasons (unconditional love etc) and the protection angle there are three good reasons that have been reseached and proven.    (1) Patting a dog lowers your blood pressure.    (2) People with dogs are healthier (and are less likely to suffer weight issues) - presumably this is because people are more likely to go for a walk if they are walking a dog.    (3) People with mental illness (such as depression) are less likely to commit suicide if they own a dog (or other animal). They believe this is because it is a natural reaction for family members to look after a child of a person who has suicided but not thier animals. People who have attempted suicide or thought about it have often quoted that worrying about the future of their pet was what stopped them from trying or attempting suicide sooner.|`|mh0QRDE9aa	Companionship! |`|aCqSF87Raa	Any particular reason? Hope you're not trying to "convince" anyone that they want a dog when they've already expressed their wishes NOT to have one...    My number one reason would be companionship.     Dogs should not be relied on to be your body guard or personal protection (unless professionally trained for a specific reason.) |`|3ffb3b89c4d7e5f341def84b65cd6d10aa	because you get a work-out partner, a best friend(who only wants food and maybe a belly rub), they will listen to you and never judge you and countless other reasons|`|3GAiVmEAaa	The best reasons for getting a dog are that everyone that lives with you also wants one, you can financially support the dog even if there was an emergency,  and you have the time and energy to dedicate to training, and you have no reason to believe that this will change within the lifetime of the dog. You need to meet these requirements over the life of the dog.    YOu cannot ignore negative parts of getting a dog. Obviously they are lovable and cute and can be a good friend. None of that matters if your parents don't want one, you will be moving away from home in a couple of years, and it will be years until you have a job that pays enough to allow for you to properly care for a dog.|`|KxjUim7yaa	 It has to do with need. My need to provide him with the things he needs to be the happy, healthy, best dog that he can be. He will return my love 100 fold.|`|afcLu9YMaa	Dogs live for NOW, so whatever your mood they are there for you, they forgive humans so many of our failings that no other human would, they ask for nothing, want to be part of our pack, are there at our side when the weather is bleak, they help with the work the best they can (and are often better than us) Whatever age you are you can paddle in the sea, if you have your dog with you can chat up those good lookers especially if they also have a dog, whereas you wouldn't dare speak to them as normal, they are your best friend who you can confide in and they never tell on you, whatever your secret!  But please don't buy a dog if you are looking for 'reasons' you should buy a dog because you couldn't imagine life without one!|`|NP8TX87Naa	To protect yourself.

This is the wisdom which my dogs share with me.|`|ZHlktWk6aa	They are more loyal than any Friend you will ever have. They will give you unconditional love, like you never had before. They will always meet you at the door and welcome you home. They are grateful for anything and everything you do for them. and the  1 best reason, they won't argue or talk back!! lol.And they don't hold grudges.|`|BpZe1oAWaa	They teach responsibility,patience, and companionship|`|u1VbLLazaa	Companionship of course but there are health benefits associated with pet ownership as well. These are:  Improvement of mood  Better control of Blood Pressure  Need to exercise your pet makes you exercise as well  Enable social support by making you more approachable  Helps with loneliness and provides unconditional love  Helps with stress relief  I'm sure there are many more but these are some that I've seen.
YOdwOvziaa	Definetly offer a reward! I lost my dog and the person that took her drove by the poster on my mailbox but didnt bring her back.

I hope you find your dog!!|`|6Whz1p5Eaa	Call around to local kennels to see if they have possibly picked him up|`|ydshiNrKaa	Notify all the local vet clinics, humane society, rescue groups, police departments and give them a description of your dog. Offer a reward for the dog and put an ad in local papers.  Post on the internet maybe craig's list.  Take walks in the wooded areas around your house and call your dogs name.  put out some food near the wooded areas and sprinkle some flour around the food bowl - check for paw prints.   contact neighbors and friends to see if they will help you walk the woods.  They usually don't move too far away unless they are found and taken by someone.  One of our rescue group volunteers lost her dog in the woods for over a week before they got him back.  Keep looking he will show up.|`|JpdVidqxaa	I hope you find your dog.  Did you call the police, notify the local vets and check with the shelters?|`|AA11298562	Try posting his picture and description on pets911.com.|`|vvWXajKvaa	Call the local kennels and call the local vets so they can also keep and eye for your dog.

8694e349acd50235e44b47ea36ba2d45aa	even at a young age your pup can develop a superiority complex.  How to tell if your dog has a superiority complex    Most bad behaviour in dogs happens because of a very simple reason. Your dog has a superiority complex. You can take the dog out of the wild, but you can't take the wild out of the dog. Dogs instincts are basically identical to the instincts of wild dogs and wolves. The only difference is that dogs view humans as part of their 'pack' and wolves and wild dogs do not. The 'leader of the pack' is responsible for the saftey and well-being of all the pack members. The leader of the pack has certain rights and privlages that come from being the pack leader, such as; the pack leader decides when to show affection or ask for affection, eats before all others in the pack, leads the 'hunt' or walk, and decides what is dangerous to the pack. eg. other dogs. Signs that your dog may feel that he/she is the leader are; pawing at you, staring at you,nipping and mouthing, leaning against you or jumping up on you, barking at you, protective of food or toys, barking at visitors out windows or at fences and when someone comes into your home and pulling on the lead when you are walking, hyperactivity and dominace with other dogs, people and objects, eg. 'humping'  You need to assert your leadership to your dog.  Your children show also participate in this.  You must start the steps of a bonding proccess called, 'Amichein Bonding'.  These simple steps will get the message across to you dogs that they are not the leader you are, and therefore they do not have to worry about the responsibilities of being the leader. eg. barking at people when they get close to the houes or yard.  when you first enter the house from being away, you must show your authority.  the leader has a personal bubble of space that can only be penitrated when the leader says so.  you must ignore your dogs when you come home until they have settled down.  do not look at them, do not acknowledge them and do not pet them.  once they have calmed down you may call one of them to you, tell him/her to sit and after they comply you may give them all the love you desire to give.  If, however, they start to jump around again you must start all over.  They must understand that you will give them affection but only on your terms, no one elses.    The second step is gesture eating.  The leader always controls the food.  The leader always eats before the rest of the pack. Once the leader has gotten his/her fill the rest of the pack is then allowed to eat.  I am not a big fan of eating a whole meal infront of my dogs so there is  something else you can do that will get the message across just as well.  You should never free feed your dogs.  This gets the message across that because they have full access to food at all times that they are the leaders. Take a cookie or a cracker and place it on your counter. Place your dogs food bowls beside your cookie and prepare the dogs meal.  Before placing your dogs food down for them to eat, make sure that they are watching, and eat your cookie or cracker infront of them.  You dont' want to make a big scene, but you do want them to see what you are doing.  You want them to think you are eating right out of their food bowls.  And when you are finished it looks as if you have taken your fill and the rest of the pack can now eat.  Third step. The leader always has a personal space in the house that no one else is allowed into unless allowed by the leader.  For me it is my living room.  My dogs are not allowed in my living room unless I say it is ok and not before.  At first this may be hard to do.  The best thing to do is go and get a few baby gates and place them in the opening of the room that is 'off limits' to your dogs.  After a while your dogs will get the picture and you will be able to take the gates down. After that it is a constant reminder to your dogs that you are not welcome unless the leader says so.  My male, who is a pure bred border collie stud, constantly tests me.  He will put one foot into the living room and check to see if I am watching, If I don't see him right away he will put another foot in and check me again.  By this time I have caught him and all I need to say is 'out', and he will retreat.  However, there are some days that he will test me further and that is when I only need to stand up off the couch and he will back away with a look of, 'I'm sorry, your the leader.'  You should never give your dogs full run of the house.  Not even when you are home.  Fourth step. The leader is always the one to lead the pack on the 'hunt'.  The hunt being anytime you and your dogs leave the 'den' house.  If your dogs pull on the lead or walk infront of you at anytime, the walk is over and you return to the 'den'.  The dogs must understand that the 'hunt' only takes place under your rules.  This may take quite a few times, but it is very important to follow all steps.  Your dogs will be looking for any sign of weakness from you for them to try and take over again.  Practicing 'heal'  in a controled environment eg. in the home or in your enclosed yard, on a lead at all times, is a good way to train them for the hunt.  All these steps take time and effort, but they will work.  I have tested these theory's time and time and time again, not only with my dogs but with numorous clients of mine.  This is a way of life with your dogs, not just a quick fix.  Once you go back to your old ways your dogs will return to their old ways.    This will get rid of that unwanted behaviour.

So many thousands upon thousands of shelter dogs needing a home. Not only that, but buying a dog from a pet store may give you problems in the future as most pet store dogs come from puppy mills with a variety of genetic health problems that may not make themselves known until years down the road. Shelter dogs are the best, they sence you are rescuing them, and will give you unconditional love till the day they die. Check petfinder.org by typing in your zip code, prefered breed, sex, age, etc... or simply go to your nearest shelter/animal control, you are more likely then not to find the perfect dog for you on any given day in any given shelter as there are just too many.

AA12272528	I have no idea but in my opinion electricity is cruel. Why couldnt u buy just a normal fence?|`|471ca0c8552c4633e525815ba702310aaa	I also have a electric fence. I didn't take 4 days off work to train her though. I find they work great, as long as you don't pile snow from your driveway on them(my question). Anyways. When I trained my dog for it, I walked her around the inside of the little flags without the collar on, then I put the collar on and walked around again so she could hear the beeping. After that I let her run around as usual. She got a few zaps but she learned very quickly what those little flags were for, and what the beeping meant. During the night and while at work, she would be a on a dog run, just in case. We slowly started letting her loose for longer and longer periods. Now she's free to run aroung the yard all the time. We did have a problem though, since it snows here I'd pile the snow from the driveway on the wire. BAD idea, it gave her enough hieght to get out without a zap. I stopped pile the snow on the wire and she stopped running off.|`|358b7cfe9b12186d7ae5f6e9e52f0e1aaa	what are their views or tips on it?

You do have to take the time to train your dog where the boundries of the fence are.  I think that's one thing people who get these don't think about.  You can't just set it up and let your dog loose, you have to take the time to properly train the dogs.  Not sure how long it takes tho.|`|AA10099648	I am always amazed that people that say they love their dogs would use this kind of torture on the animal.   Would you use that fence to train your child not to run into the street?  Why would you inflict a shock of electricity to run into your dog's body??     Fence in your yard or walk your dog. Better yet, if you want to shock your dog, why not give him/her away to someone that will care for him and train him the right way?|`|8185b6e35201a0b05e53274a96080596aa	i think that electric fences are really mean becuz that is just like a shock collar. train your dog to stay in the limits of your yard by taking him there everyday but then bringing him back. he will learn that he cant go any farther.|`|d5dc4b7ce610fa16578fcaeba67fdd12aa	That's awfully disgustingly cruel.|`|60d638adb7d9f4a7086caa24a31392aaaa	Its cruel for the dog or any other animal or bird which would sit on the fence.

Just think of it this way (no sarcasm meant) how would feel if every time you went to  the water closet,if you steped one wrong step,you'de be shocked out of your wits. Not a pretty picture.  Hope this helps!|`|ed2f78fe7a142e4742735e407e697f26aa	I think the brand with the collars, sold at pet supply stores are over priced, and if you have a really stubborn dog you have to upgrade the collar for a bigger shock.  My best friend has 2 pit bulls that would visit her neighbors yard, they are very nice and sweet but she was very worried about them getting out of a fence all together and someone doing something to them. She spent $50 at a Tractor supply center (here in Texas) and bought the kind of electric fence you nail the runners into the wooden privacy fence posts and string the wire through. She didnt have a problem with them after that. Another friend I have that shows dogs has the kind you are talking about and her dogs run through as fast as they can get a small shock but once they are on the other side the dog runs the neighborhood.  There is a certain amount of training you have to do with these kind of collars and not leave them unattended with them at any time.|`|6bd707c77ee82c3124346483484e89daaa	they work pretty well for most dogs, some larger dogs dont care about the shock tho, but i have seen it backfire once on the owner, the dog got out, but then was afraid to go BACK into the yard because it knew it would get shocked.  a few people that live down the street from my BF have them, the dogs just run around the yard and sit at the edge of the property, i have never once seen them try to escape, and they are all large labs.  i will tell you that dumb dogs wont care about being shocked.  we have a spaniel thats as dumb as a rock, and we used to have the shock collars for barking.  she killed 2 of them, not like ran the battery out, like destroyed the shocking mechanism cause she just didnt care (it was only a 9 volt shock, so its not like it was a lot, just lick a battery to find out for yourself if you think its cruel, mostly its just a surprise) so we knew the fence would never work for her.      just take it slow with learning how to use it, dont expect your dog to understand right away, i hear it can take a few weeks of working with the boundry line for them to learn where it is, and what the beeps mean.|`|d26778e74597bd61ec4ff7386e65455faa	Look every one has opinions on this subject. Unless you've had the invisible fence no one can really say what they think.Ive had the invisible fence for 6 years ,installed by Dog Watch. I've had 3 APBT trained to the boundry lines successfully. It's not cruel ,it works ,and it's a god send.In the 6 years i've had the fence I think my dogs may have been shocked twice. Once in training and once when they learned the boundries. Now my dogs can go out with out their collars and go no wheres near the boundries. Once you put the fence down you have to take the time and train your dog to the boundry lines. You just can't take the dog ,throw on the collar and expect the dog to know what's going on. It wont work.It'll take about a week of walking the boundry line with your dog and the boundry flags until your dog learns.    Again it's not cruel .It's not like a shock collar that you can shock your dog when ever you want with a transmitter. Once your dog learns he wont go near the boundry.|`|d9aa61350f66b20e3a6666e959e57defaa	never used the underground fence just above ground....it is not cruel you are protecting you pet from getting out good job wish everyone took the time to be sure their animals were housed properly we would have lees animals in our garbage & getting hit in roads    and as for martina yes i would use on my kids it keeps them out of the road too|`|dbf44b2d4b9b4b0f7045d0d83d7016faaa	I've never used one, but from what I hear and from what I've seen, they seem to work nicely.

AA12310378	You don't !  African cichlids are freshwater fish and although some of the lakes have extremely hard water they are not brackish.  You test hardness with GH & kH kits.    Your tank is very small for mbuna & too small for Haps. It could hold a trio of yellow labs or P socolofi but small Tanganyikans would be a better choice IMO.  Depending on the shape of the tank you could have N lelupei or one of the smaller Julidochromis speciesand a bunch of N similis or similar shell dwellers.    If you source water isn't hard you could have African river species - jewels or kribs?|`|6c2184561c773735f80f72c324d56cfaaa	...You shouldn't be adding that much salt to your tank (at least so much that it would require your measuring it on a regular basis). African Cichlids are still freshwater fish. 1 Tbsp for every 5 gallons is all that you should be using---and only adding more if you remove water (evaporation does not require adding more salt as salt will not evaporate).    Anyway, a hydrometer, or refractometer is your best method to measure salinity in the water. Either should be available at your local Petsmart or Petco.|`|546ff4965eaf61087c552b78b1a4438aaa	with a hydrometer|`|AA12260782	There is a special "do-hickey, thingy" you buy at the pet store.

eb7b3f653ea0e97bafa2dd3ddf8e6ac8aa	Just for the record, the coloring of your fish is called calico.  Unless it's a comet and then it's a shubunkin.  Anyway, usually when goldfish are blind, their eyes are white.  I don't think he's blind.  It's just his coloring.  He's not dying just because he sits on the bottom.  With the exception of comets, goldfish are fairly slow, easy-going fish.  Even my comets in my pond will sit on the bottom for long periods of time because they were just plain bored.  Also, we humans don't give animals enough credit for actually having personalities, but they do; even goldfish.  Each one is different.  Some are outgoing, some are shy.  Some eat anything, some are picky and will only eat one special thing.  He could just be very submissive and doesn't like to "fight" for his food and picky about his food too.  You may want to try putting him in his own tank and try giving him an irrestible food like frozen brine shrimp.  Try flakes, try pellets (if you feed pellets, you need to soak them first).   Keep trying different foods until you find one he likes.  They have this rule about feeding fish that whatever they don't eat in five minutes, you're supposed to remove, but if I did that with my goldies, they'd starve.  They like to take their time with eating.  AND, they don't like me watching them either.  These are my goldfish and this is their personality.  Like I said, all fish are different.   Also, goldfish will eat less the colder the water is.  If they are left outside through the winter and there's ice on the top of the water, for instance, they may not eat the whole winter long.  If the water is just very cold, but not freezing, they may only need to eat once a week or so.  Three days may not necessarily mean much with a goldfish.  Their body shuts down into hibernation mode.  Goldies water temp can be cold, just adjust their feeding accordingly, but a good average feeding temp is 72 degrees, but not more than 80.  Anyway, try putting him in his own tank.  Try special foods.  Give him a week or two, but educate yourself about goldfish diseases and watch him just in case.|`|AA11032183	Even if he is blind,he would find the food with his other senses,for certain.This fish is most likely ill.|`|828d0ecb2bd9c59f22cca05fe04b7ec0aa	maybe you write him a little note in goldfish Braille and find out what the problems is|`|708d841f5a655649c762deee63592c64aa	Sadly, it usually means that it's dying. That happend to one of my goldfish once, and it may not be that it's blind, but it just doesnt eat when it's dying. When it does, it usually spits it back out into even smaller pieces because its body can not digest the food. In about a week it will most likely die. So just dont pay too much attention to it.|`|62ca23868845a29692764a8a80fe8eb6aa	i'm no expert... but i think it's his/her time. i know this may be hard for you, but it's also a hard time for the fish.  luckily the cost of a goldfish is like under $10, right?    sorry, i know nothing dude.|`|6e5192d5dc4236fca82f358ecf363e39aa	Fish usually will spit things out after every bite...I don't think they swallow all that well.  I'm sure he can see fine, and if he couldn't, he would smell the food and go after it...if he had vision or not.  He could be lazy, or maybe depressed, or maybe you should change your food...We had some fish that wouldn't eat the food that was recommended.  Try tropical fish flakes!  Also, keep in mind, a fish only needs to eat as much as the size of his eyeball...in one day.  If you could hold his eyeball in your hand (which please dont do that), you would see that it really isn't that big, and that he doesn't need that much.|`|c198441b171eb7a4c1b2916dc48107b3aa	yeah my goldfish is like that too.  i dont know why?  My dad told me its because im standing there watching it eat the fish food. So it gets scared.   Im not so sure, it could be that maybe the fish doesn't like eating by the other fishes.   I think its because of the fish food, your fish probably doesn't like it. My fish spits it back into tiny pieces, the only fish food he eats is the pink flakes.

7e4e678f3871f9d7ec791969476ce809aa	Nutri??o: qual o melhor alimento para seu c?o?        Por que alimentar seu c?o com ra??o?    O c?o  um animal que tem carncias nutricionais diferentes das nossas. Por isso, sua dieta deve ser direcionada a atender essas necessidades. Quando alimentamos os c?es com comida caseira, na grande maioria das vezes (quase sempre) n?o estamos promovendo uma nutri??o adequada. Por mais "sem gra?a" que possa parecer, a ra??o  a melhor op??o. Por qu?     Podemos dar alguns argumentos favorveis ao uso de ra??o, ao invs de comida caseira:     - necessidades do c?o - Por mais variada que seja a comida do Rex, n?o conseguimos oferecer-lhe uma dieta completa e balanceada. Mesmo dando carne, legumes e ovos, ainda assim n?o conseguimos balancear esta ra??o; e macarr?o, arroz e fub n?o s?o comida de cachorro;     - a praticidade - Hoje em dia poucas pessoas tem tempo para fazer seu prprio almo?o, muito menos a comida do cachorro. Para comprovar, basta observar que as vendas de comida congelada e desidratada tm aumentado de maneira significativa;    - O CUSTO - Se colocarmos na ponta do lpis a despesa na elabora??o de uma dieta para um c?o, com carne, ovos, legumes, complementos vitamnicos e minerais, e o trabalho que teremos adicionando cada ingrediente na medida certa para equilibr-la, comparado ao custo dirio da alimenta??o  base de ra??o, sem dvida a op??o mais econ?mica ser a ra??o (mesmo se esta for importada).    Onde est a diferen?a?    Nossos amigos peludos tm sua origem em outros candeos selvagens, como o chacal, os cachorros-do-mato... Estes animais, em vida livre, alimentam-se basicamente do que conseguem ca?ar ou, mais frequentemente, das sobras de outros predadores (le?es, leopardos...). E foi por este hbito que os c?es primitivos se aproximaram dos homens primitivos, visto que o homem sempre foi um ca?ador, at aprender a plantar e colher. Quando um candeo se alimenta, come a carne, o plo, a pele, os ossos, as vsceras e at o contedo intestinal das presas. E, respondendo  pergunta, o bom e velho Rex precisa de uma dieta t?o variada quanto a de seus parentes de vida livre, para que tenha uma vida saudvel.    O que comprar?    No Brasil, hoje, temos diversos tipos de ra??o com qualidades diferentes. Para facilitar o entendimento, vamos classific-las em trs grupos.    Ra??es Populares - S?o os produtos mais baratos que existem no comrcio. Normalmente formuladas com subprodutos de milho, soja, farelo de algod?o, etc. Tais ingredientes, na ra??o de uma vaca ou de um cavalo seriam de excelente digest?o, mas, voltando quela historinha, nosso amigo  um carnvoro, e precisa de protena de origem animal, pronta a ser assimilada pelo seu organismo    OBS.: Os vegetarianos de quatro patas tm a capacidade de transformar protenas e carboidratos de baixa qualidade em "produtos mais nobres". Os c?es e gatos precisam dos produtos nobres j prontos.    Ra??es "Standard" - S?o produtos de empresas de renome, que, na maioria das vezes, buscam atravs da mdia uma fatia maior do mercado consumidor. Por serem produtos de empresas maiores, tm um compromisso maior com a qualidade, e s?o formuladas com ingredientes qualitativamente melhores que as ra??es populares, ou seja, n?o s?o "t?o subprodutos" assim. Contm farinha de carne e ossos, glten de milho, gordura animal, etc. Porm ainda n?o s?o "ideais" a nvel de digestibilidade, mas s?o melhores que os "subprodutos". Quanto ao custo, est?o numa faixa intermediria de pre?o.    Ra??es Premium e Super Premium - S?o produtos de primeira qualidade em nutri??o canina, por isso mais caros. Tm sua formula??o baseada em carne de frango, ovelha, peru... Porm, realmente carne, ou resduos de abatedouro, como digestas de frango, por exemplo (o que  diferente dos "subprodutos"). Tais ingredientes, de origem animal, tm maior digestibilidade, ou seja, o trato digestivo canino tem menos "trabalho" para metaboliz-los. Esta  outra caracterstica das ra??es premium: como a digestibilidade  maior, o consumo dirio de ra??o  menor (o que ameniza o pre?o da ra??o). Promovem ainda uma vida mais saudvel, e reduzem o volume das fezes do animal.    As Ra??es super premium s?o assim classificadas a partir de um certo percentual de digestibilidade, o que pode variar de acordo com os interesses dos fabricantes, pois n?o h um "padr?o" neste sentido.     Como consumidor, para saber se a ra??o  de alta digestibilidade, ou n?o, basta analisar na embalagem os ingredientes que comp?em a ra??o. As fontes proteicas devem ser de origem animal (carne de frango, carne de peru, digestas de frango, carne de ovelha, ovos, etc.). E as fontes de gordura tambm, ou pelo menos leos vegetais nobres como, por exemplo, leo de linha?a. Fontes proteicas vegetais como soja, glten, etc. n?o tm alta digestibilidade.  bom desconfiar de produtos que tm em sua rela??o de componentes coisas como "carne de aves" (urub tambm  ave / e de que parte da ave est?o falando? Pena e bico s?o protena pura e de baixssima digestibilidade).     O que pode aumentar a digestibilidade da ra??o  a presen?a de fibras de moderada fermenta??o (p.ex. polpa de beterraba branca), que aumenta a eficincia absortiva dos entercitos. Outro ingrediente que melhora a digestibilidade s?o os F.O.S. (fruto oligo sacardeos), que alimentam a microbiota intestinal, ou seja, beneficia o crescimento de "boas bactrias" no intestino, o que leva a uma melhor fermenta??o do bolo alimentar.    Resumindo, quando compramos uma ra??o para o amigo peludo, devemos estar atentos aos nveis de garantia (percentuais de protena, gordura, etc.) e a qualidade dos ingredientes. Por exemplo, uma ra??o para cachorro deve ter, no mnimo, 18% de protena. O que  relativo, porque carne  |`|d22c910df58a7d9e3dfbd2bdc06b2143aa	Porque eles nao podem dar as ra?oes para nos!|`|dd23cSd7aa	 como vivem dizendo q nos devemos ter uma alimenta??o sadia e balanceada...sen?o podemos ter problemas de sade do tipo engordar demais, colesterol, problemas cardacos...ent?o o mesmo acontece com eles j perdi uma pincher pq ela esta mto gorda e a veterinria me disse q essa ra?a por serem mto estressados s?o propensos a ter ataque cardacos , e foi o q aconteceu n?o tive nem  tempo de leva-la ao veterinrio.por isso devemos alimenta-los s com a ra??o q tem tudo o q eles precisam qndo mto pode dar uma fruta ou legume cru.

Elle s'en est occupe avec beaucoup de patience, d'affection et de tendresse.     Un chat est plus sensible que les chiens aux ultra-sons. Celui que vous avez recueilli est aveugle, mais il vous voit  l'aide de son odorat (qui doit certainement tre plus dvelopp que les autres chats) et ses vibrisses.    Son comportement est  la hauteur du calvaire qu'il a vcu. Cette petite boule de poils doit tre certainement ne aveugle (cela arrive parfois) et comble de malchance, il peut aussi tre n dans la rue. Je ne vous apprendrai pas que certains propritaires n'ayant pas pris les prcautions requises (ovariectomie) jette  la rue une femelle pleine. C'est scandaleux mais cela fait partie de la lachet que nombre d'humains font preuve  l'gard de nos petits flins entre autres.    Si j'ai bien lu votre rcit, vous avez d'autres chats et l'entente semble bonne. Comment vos autres chats se comportent-ils  son gard ?     Mon conseil personnel serait que de temps  autre vous arriviez  l'isoler des autres et que vous vous occupiez uniquement de lui. Asseyez-vous  mme le sol, parlez-lui d'une voix douce, appelez-le par son nom, complimentez-le.  Essayez de le faire jouer avec une ficelle au bout de laquelle vous aurez mis un petit objet faisant un bruit lger. Les gestes devront tre lents pour viter  votre protg d'avoir peur (suivant les mouvements il ressent plus ou moins fortement le dplacement de l'air qu'ils gnrent). Petit  petit peut-tre parviendrez-vous  le mettre en confiance. Il est possible que vous arriviez  faire en sorte qu'il s'approche. Dans ce cas ne tendez pas la main tout de suite, attendez qu'il soit le plus prs possible de vous et donnez-lui une friandise  chaque fois. Pour en arriver uniquement  ce stade cela peut prendre du temps. Puis, quand vous aurez constat qu'il vient vers vous sans crainte, vous pourrez essayer de le caresser et petit  petit il y prendra go?t (n'oubliez pas la friandise). Surtout ne tentez pas de le porter car cela annihilerait tout le travail prcdent et il vous faudrait tout recommencer. Peut-tre qu'un jour vous russirez  le prendre dans vos bras, mais ce n'est pas gagn car certains chats mme sans avoir vcu ce que le v?tre a vcu, n'aiment pas tre ports.    Vous russirez votre challenge uniquement avec de la patience et de la douceur.    Je vous conseille fortement de lire le livre : les chats de hasard crit par Anny Duperey. Ce livre formidablement crit et m'a appris comment approcher ces adorables flins abandonns  leur triste sort. J'ai pu en apprivoiser quelques-uns, les soigner et les placer par la suite. J'en ai gards qui sont devenus des chats extraordinaires. J'en ai placs d'autres qui ont oubli leur mauvais traitement grace au dvouement de leurs nouveaux propritaires. Mais tous ont gard des squelles plus ou moins visibles de ce que l'humain leur a fait. Cela se voit, par leur fa?on de regarder autour d'eux, leur fa?on de manger, leur fa?on de jouer, leur fa?on de se pelotonner dans un coin, leur fa?on de fuir quand quelque chose d'inhabituel survient. Tous ces dtails que nous rappellent combien les tres humains ont pu tre cruels avec eux !    Toutes mes flicitations pour votre dvouement  la cause fline.    Je vous souhaite une excellente journe et plein de caresses  vos petites boules de poils et en particulier  celle qui fait l'objet de votre question.|`|CynkTnp1aa	Comme ce chat est aveugle et utilise son odorat encore plus que les autres je vous conseillerais de laisser une couverture ou un linge qui porte votre odeur de fa?on  ce qu'il s'y habitue... Ca serait dj un bon dbut. Ensuite c'est vrai que comme cela a t dit plusieurs fois auparavant si ce chat a t traumatis il va tre s?rement difficile de l'apprivoiser...  En tous cas bon courage et bravo d'avoir recueilli ce minou abandonn ! Bonne chance pr la suite !|`|Oh9erWMnaa	j'ai eu une minette aveugle, mais elle se dpla?ait sans problme car connaissait l'appartement.

Le fait qu'il est aveugle n'a peut-etre rien  voir avec cela, surtout que pour le reste il s'est habitu  la maisonne et aux habitudes qui y ont cours. Donc ,hlas pour vous , il ne se rapprochera peut-etre jamais plus(???) tous les chats (comme les humains ou autres,  ne connaissent pas  le bien-etre des marques de tendresse etc....) Mais qui sait  ?  peut-etre qu'il y prendra quand meme gout ?? A-t-il connu les calins avant d'etre  la rue?? Quoiqu'il en soit je vous souhaite bonne chance et de toutes manires ,il est plus heureux avec vous qu' la rue et il ne doit plus chercher sa nourriture etc... C'est dj trs important!

O periodo de cio dura de 2 a 4 dias e ocorre em intervalos de aproximadamente 2 semanas.O ciclo normalmente se repete 2 ou 3 vezes no outono ( principalmente em mar?o e abril) e no inverno ( principalmente em junho e julho), tendo algumas vezes um terceiro perodo de atividade em setembro.

q1zqQfPJaa	Ol,    Bom, alguns veterinrios aconselham a vermifuga??o dos animais depois de 30 dias do nascimento.  Eu sou veterinria tambm, e penso um pouco a frente, se ele tomar com 30 dias, depois de 15 dias, ele ir tomar a primeira dose de vacina. E o vermfugo  como a ra??o mas em propor?oes menores (baixa a imunidade do animal).  D a vacina com 45 dias, e no mesmo dia voc pode dar o vermfugo.   aconselhvel que 3 dias antes voc d a eles ESTIBION (compre em petshop), ele segura a imunidade, e os c?es n?o v?o ficar t?o tristonos e suceptveis a fungos, ou estresse excessivo.    45 dias - 1a dose  60 dias - 2a dose  75 dias - 3a dose    Se voc comprar o estibion, voc pode come?as a vermifuga??o aos 30 dias, desde que 3 dias antes da primeira vacina, voc d 1cm de ESTIBION para cada c?ozinho por dia. D trs dias e pare. A o esquema muda:    1o dose - 30 dias  2o dose - 45 dias  3o dose - 60 dias.    Qualquer dvida, entre em cotato comigo pelo perfil ou pelo msn (que est no meu perfil).

hPjWNUF8aa	It was really just like wet sandpaper. I dunno, maybe a little smoother than sandpaper, but you catch my drift. My dog's tongue (boxer, very slobbery) was about 2 1/2 to 3 inches wide. I dunno how he fits the whole dang thing in his mouth... ha ha  Um, I don't think this is a weird question or that it screams bestiality. It's a simple question, why do you people have to read so much into it? Just because he asked it doesn't mean he's into that kind of stuff, and just because I answered it doesn't mean I'm into it. Cool out! Jesus...|`|fEcNMm05aa	HAHAHA.  ohhh man.|`|C1eHfhrHaa	their tongues are huge, but they are usually only slobbery if it is hot out or if they have just eaten or had a drink.  If you've ever been licked by a calf, the sensation is similar.|`|0Ew1HY3haa	that's creepy lol. majorly. bestiality is a sin. seek help. |`|6TVZ4fdlaa	Um yes but what kind of question is this? It's like a soft rag or something...|`|FPaJ1AU0aa	Yes, its tongue was massive lol, i was licked by a big Saint Bernard.  What do you want to know?

qGy9fR7xaa	Yeah, that's a good idea. I should actually try that!!  You should stick pictures in and everything - oh, and for the weight thing, i tried that once. I just put the rats on my weighing scales, and stuck some treats on it, so she's sit and eat the treats while being weighed.  I'm sorry to be unhelpful, but i've got no idea how much rats are meant to weigh! Try looking on the internet like google, or something.  But seriously, i think the diary things a really good idea - and i'm gonna do that!!

83334d0d7e697d6b24c2172168996034aa	I'm so glad my vet is an animal nutritionist too.  He's okay with our raw feeding.  The owner of that dog is feeding racks.  I don't know how large the dog is, but enough racks constitutes enough calcium.  Most vets don't know enough about nutrition and rely upon the big pet food companies to elucidate them.|`|3giaPYe8aa	This is such an interesting subject to me.  I have never fed raw, and probably never will.  I'm not against raw.  I had a conversation with a retired Vet Tech friend and mentor of mine about this subject not too long ago. (She bred Dobes for over 35 years)  She is far from being the "dog food police" or promoting the foods that Vets recommend.  She does not believe in feeding raw.  Her theory is this:  a canine is a canine BUT our domesticated dogs have evolved so much and so have their digestive systems.  This is the way I look at it:  no matter what food you feed, if the dog does well on it, why change?  I feed Nutro for almost 30 years, and my dogs did great, up until around a year and a half ago.  Well, when I saw a change in my dogs, I decided to make a change.  I now feed Merrick.  I really don't know if it's the best, but I know it is better, because I can see the results.  Maybe my dogs would do even better on the raw diet...I don't know because I haven't tried it.  I, for one, would not let any Vet or any other person tell me what to feed my dogs.  I know many people who feed crap dog food, IMO, and their dogs do great on it.  So, I can only "preach" for someone to try a change, but I can't make them, just like I personally don't want to feed raw.  This has nothing to do with what my mentor Vet Tech friend says, it's because I can't even stomach to look at raw liver.  Yes, you know that I do eat sea kittens and drink cows milk.|`|bIaywrBCaa	I wouldn't want a big lecture like that but maybe he knows what he is talking about. I don't feed the raw but don't really know enough about it to form an opinion. Vets do know more about overall dog care than the rest of us do. If he was a good vet in every way, I would continue to use him.|`|nctxHm8Qaa	I would simply comfort myself with the fact that vets know extremely little about nutrition.  I would let the vet know that I respect her feelings, but that I am confident in my choice.  I would give her one more chance, and if she continued to guilt me, I would find a new vet.|`|tPGxPDvBaa	I would probably change vets.  Even though the vet was doing what they considered right by the dog, they actually have very little nutrition training.  Raw feeding is an excellent way to feed your dog if you are doing it correctly.  I would go back & research more to be sure I wasn't short changing my dog also.  There are vets who support raw & have more experience with it & that is who I would choose.  I want an open minded vet not one set in their ways.|`|E5gaKzCsaa	First point is the allergy thing. If allergies are a good candidate for the cause of the ear problem, then diet is the first place to look. However, that doesn't mean that RAW is the problem, just maybe the particular type of RAW. I don't feed RAW, but I think I'd be much more comfortable with a vet who at least respected my choice and was willing to work with me on it. I'd look into the phosphorus thing, though. There could well be something in that. Tough call, though. If the vet is a really good vet aside from this, I might speak to him/her and see whether we could agree to disagree.|`|AA10412922	I would be impressed the vet knew  about calcium/phosphate balances .Having a vet against raw feeding is still the norm but who are they to push a cooked diet on the client.I disagree with not feeding fruits and vegs,in the wild they are in the gi tract of the animals dogs eat|`|Rva0ocMOaa	I would switch vets just because i would be so irritated every time i went there.     ADD: Why the thumbs down? it is just my opinion. I would not continue to see a vet who basically told i am killing my dog when i know how healthy he is. I would make sure i found a new vet with a better fit for me and my dog. To me, this is a hypothetical scenario.. i don't even feed my dog raw.|`|uBFhKXgHaa	Depends on how the vet was aside from nutrition (how good he/she was with my dogs and how medically knowledgeable they were) as well as how pushy they were about this issue.    I'd politely inform them that I had no interest in their lecture and had no intention of altering my dog's diet based on their information. I might even counter their information with some print outs of my own. If they continued to be pushy or to bring it up every time I went there, I would seek a different vet.     Darksong~|`|MLC97M1Baa	Taking raw out of the question, and assuming my vet dissed my food choice, and seeing how well Moko was doing on the food, I would discontinue seeing her/him.   I would have lower respect for the vet ... I would stick to my food I was feeding because I know my dog is healthy and happy. I would seek out another vet, one that has knowledge about my food choice.|`|18f339d2d88d8a05cc418425220b52e1aa	If you can do all that for your dog that must mean that you are living pretty high on the hog too.    I can't afford to feed myself the way that the rich people fed themselves, nor can I afford the fancy food for my dogs.  I try to live with in my means & it simply cannot be done.    Do the best you can by your dog & that is the best you can do.  So what if he eats a bit of corn,  look at all the fillers that go into our food.  Should we feed them better than ourselves?  I don't think so.    If you can afford it fine but if you can't, that's cool, you can't if you can't.    If you have done the research & know, I mean reall KNOW, that what you are feeding is the best you can do then so be it.  make it so.|`|p7swtBYzaa	Raw feeding is one thing, but seems to me that you give your dog no carbs at all and no veggies - how healthy can that be?    Is your dog healthy or not would be my entire criteria - if he has problems then you need to consider what your vet said.  Does he have an allergy?    I don't think you are telling the whole story here -- why would your vet say he has an allergy to some food if he doesn't, I don't see what she gets out of advocating that you feed him some decent complex carbohydrates, that just makes sense for any mammal.  This raw diet assumes that dogs are wolves or hyenas - and they are not.  They have evolved same as humans have over many thousands of years and I don't think a completely meat based diet is good - maybe better than the corn meal junk in supermarket dry kibble, but why limit your dog like this?      If I knew my dogs are eating healthy (and I certainly think they are on Canidae Chicken and Rice supplemented with lean beef or white meat, skinless, boneless chicken, some boiled rice, yoghurt, veggies, low fat cheese) then I would continue to feed them that if they are doing well.  However, I did change over from a good kibble to Canidae because 2 were having allergic reactions to the premium brand I fed them before.  All depends on whether your dog actually does have a problem - why would your vet spend so much time and effort if your dog is perfectly healthy?   Something not right here - think about this logically instead of being so irate at having your judgement questioned.  Your vet doesn't get anything out of trying to get you to feed your dog properly - most don't even bother with nutrition, so I would ask why she is saying this.|`|9ea79964f4ddad1359a8089c6729bb4caa	I wouldn't quit going to a good vet simply because they disagree with my choice of food. Most vets are against raw diets anyway and 99% of them think that Science Diet is the best food on the market. So it really is hard to find a vet that is on board with canine nutrition since most of what they know comes from the one class on nurtrition they had in vet school, which just happened to be taught by none other than Science Diet.   Now, if the vet was already bugging me in other areas, you bet this would push me over the edge......but if he/she was good about everything else, I'd thank them for their advice and continue to feed my dog they way I thought was best and avoid talking with them about food in the future.|`|bMYv0fBHaa	Most likely, I would go home and pick up some more research--based on the fact that I would be questioning myself (even though vets know very little about nutrition--they peddle Science Diet for crying out loud).    I would give her maybe one more chance, but I would definately switch if things didn't improve.     I seriously doubt as well that a RAW diet caused an entire litter of pups to have breaking bones. And while allergies can pop up overnight--it's just the same as with kibble.|`|XwQxKwRcaa	In theory, if I was lectured by my dog's vet about her diet, I would probably be taken a little aback, but also curious as to why he/she was so passionate about the issue.     In this specific case, it just shows that the Vet actually knows what she is doing, so I would actually be very comfortable. Since this isn't an original wild wolf I'm feeding but, you know, one of those that have evolved since then?|`|b71b424fc067bf9c2eea3e5af4efb630aa	It all depends on how the vet is otherwise.    Is he a GREAT vet who just doesn't agree with the food I feed, or is he a so-so vet and I could probably do better?    If I liked the vet and valued his medical opinion, I would just ignore the "food rant", if I questioned other techniques the vet used, I'd look around for another vet.|`|iLrp65oXaa	I would probably switch vets.  I don't feed raw, but if my vet tried to get me to switch from EVO to Iams or something I would be furious.      I would look for a different vet that saw eye to eye with me on raw feeding.  It would keep coming up for the life of the pet and be a constant bother when going to the vet.  I would not want to feel like crap about myself every time I took my dog to the vet.|`|v60IQGRZaa	I'd keep going to her because she seems like she really cares. But I know I don't have time to really fix a dog a meal every single day. Also you need to personally look into the pros and cons of a raw diet. There is alot of bacteria and things in raw meat. So I wouldn't suggest it. But I have a dog *Westie* and he is on a wet and dry food diet. I do part wet and part dry. Also you might want to find a dog food that has some of the things in it that is on your very long list. Also if you go to a petsmart they have a huge variety of dry and wet foods, along with toppers. I actually found a full coarse thanksgiving meal for my dog in a can. Honestly it had real meat, a full multiple variety of veggies in it and my dog loved it. So it's not like you can't change up food.|`|99Znmg81aa	Were you there for a routine scheduled visit, or because of a problem?  Why did the issue even come up?      If your dog is healthy so far, and you're confident, I'd stick with what you're doing.  But if your dog is having some issues, then I'd start eliminating certain items from the diet for a week or so at a time and see if the dog improves.  Maybe your dog really is allergic to a specific meat....    And if the vet is *so* emphatic about this that it's going to be an ongoing issue, then I'd find another vet.  Maybe if you ask the vet's office about their opinion of raw feeding in advance, you can save some time/money finding a vet who's a better fit.|`|KxjUim7yaa	Short answer is that vets don't know everything. If she is good in other respects you should keep her. My vet didn't suggest so much that I switch to my dogs current diet as agree that something needed to be done and I did the research and did it. They approve my results. If they continue to lecture you, I would change.|`|qqUvoC5uaa	I would be displeased obviously.  However it's expected from a vet to give that sort of uneducated rant.     Vets are nutrition "educated" by a certain pet food company. So obviously instead of giving the vets facts to base their practise on, they tell them everything that their food includes.     The thing with that is that if anything does go wrong (which we obviously hope nothing goes wrong with your dog), be prepared to have it all blamed on raw. From the sounds of this woman she's ready to blame raw for anything. This may lead to a misdiagnoses.     I'm still unsure on how my vet feels about a raw diet. Not that it's a huge issue.    Also, dogs don't NEED veggies. Like humans they do not secrete the enzyme cellulose which is the enzyme that breaks down plant matter in the digestive system.   However unlike humans, dogs have a significantly shorter digestive tract and do not need veggies to help keep things cleaned out.   Sure, they can eat them fine, but they wont benefit the dog, give them a carrot and watch for it to come out looking the same out the rear end|`|tiRZwBPuaa	i wouldnt listen to ur vet and try a new one i worka t a pet store and i know alot of ppl that feed raw and they love it.i am goin to start to feed raw in a few months because i have to get her teeth pulled.i have heard nothing of feed her raw and no one has told me that raw is a bad food.there is alot of things in there to keep her healty...but do u buy raw or do u make it urself.i would buy the raw dog food than i kno wut is in there.but i guess either way it is ur dog and u kno best.its kinds like havin a kid it is ur kid dont let ppl try to tell u different.raw is a good food.  this has differnt myths about feeding raw food:  http://rawfed.com/myths/|`|isF1nhVfaa	This person seems to have a questions about what she's doing to begin with.    In this case, the Vet is right (diet and all). She probably could've been nicer about it, instead of waving a stack of papers in this person's face.    I'd stick with the vet.   But this woman could probably bop around town to TRY and find a vet that agrees with her.|`|QdQcAHqaaa	The deal with vets is that many dog food companies sponsor vet schools, and many of the scientists from those companies write the textbooks. Therefore, vet students go through school hearing all the virtues of store-bought food, and since nutrition is a separate science from medicine, vets really are not experts at choosing food.  I'm pretty ambivalent about raw feeding myself, but I feel like raw is pretty close to what their ancestor, the wolf, eats.  I also think that canines are omnivores and are not harmed by eating some vegetables, but potatoes seems excessive.    I agree with your stance, ditch the vet and go with one who understands raw or is at least knowledgeable about it.  Check out the link for more info.    Edit - Ellen Farrah: COOKED bones will splinter inside the stomach (hence not cooknig the protein). The bones of a young animal are very nutritious and will not harm the stomach. If you don't believe me, there are people who eat bones.|`|u4WU01EXaa	Have a good ring around and get some other vets opinions see what they have to say before you change, you can actually buy a bone grow formula from most pet stores that has added calcium too make their bone strong and healthy.|`|OiLqzwnyaa	ok so far all u have done is argue with everyone who has answered your question, if u are not going to take what people say seriously, and your obviously not if your arguing every ones answers then why ask?     the only thing that you mentioned above about the food your giving your dog is protein, protein, protein, what about calcium, vit C, zinc, ect...yes protein is important but so is calcium, especially for a dog, the vet probably was very concerned for your dogs health, and that's why she came across that way, yes i would continue to tke my dog to this vet because obviously she really cares about him and his health or she would not have been concerned at all about your choice of diet. i don't think that raw is the best type of diet for a dog, while i do believe in making my dogs food and not buying i wouldn't choose a raw diet, because it is laking in some areas of nutrition.     if my vet was telling me my dog is laking needed vitamins i would defiantly listen and do what i could to change that.

9biWjSweaa	Ever thought that it might not have been the breed of horse that was dodgy, it might have been their training? If this morgan breeding farm hasn't give them proper training then that is probably the stem of all these problems.     I understand why you say what you do though, it's only natural for you to come to that conclusion and I can't blame you for it - we all do it =)|`|5eu5P1hYaa	Morgans are the BEST breed in my opinion.  But, you really shouldn't ride one if you fall off easily or don't like their kiddyness (by that I mean they almost all act like little kids and have way to much energy).  Morgans are feisty.  Don't ride them if you don't like them, and any one who reads this, remember that if you fall of easily and/or don't like t when a horse tries to have a little fun, DON'T RIDE A MORGAN!!! I have two and they have both thrown me a few times, and I've fallen off all the morgans that aren't for beginners.  But it doesn't bother me because I DON'T CARE IF I FALL!!!!!! I NEVER BLAME THE HORSE!!! Seriously, if we fall it is because we made a fault in our riding, not because the horse started cantering...    Oh and No, I don't have a least favorite breed.|`|BCZ1ezXMaa	i havent had any experiences with arabians, i just hated the way they looked. but for some odd reason... i want one now. and whenever i look for buying horses, i search in arabians!|`|meoRbjgCaa	I think in general breeds that are often frowned upon are the ones that require a more skilled rider then your average "look I ride a horse" person.  These breeds are usually more sensitive and considered "hotter" (arabs, morgans, saddlebreds).  For the good of the horse the rider should always be engaged to handle whatever they may shy at or scoot away from.  But some people sit on a horse like a potato sack would.  That is okay, but it normally doesn't mix well with a horse that is aware of every move your body makes.    I have ridden quarter's, arabians, morgans, and ? breeds of horses.  I love them all, but I choose to ride an arab.|`|lTeXIjpOaa	i love saddlebreds, i started riding one and absolutely love him, he is so sweet and so great to ride that i have now fallen in love with the breed, i haven't felt a dislike for a certain breed, even though i have met my match with an arab and a quarter, i havent had enough bad experiences with one specific breed to shy away from them|`|Of0fyh2Saa	I used to dislike Appy's when I was young before I knew that there's really no bad breed.

For a long while I absolutely hated Arabians because one almost threw me off into a river (didn't come off, luckily) and a couple others I rode were just horrors. Then, about eight months ago, I rode this beautiful Arab called Bubs for a lesson and she was an absolute angel. My friend who has also ridden her, said she was a really bad horse etc. I loved her and she always gets an extra pat when I'm down for my horse.    At the moment, I don't have a least favourite. Just my opinion. (:|`|wYBU1B1qaa	I just love walkers.  I've ridden saddlebreds, TBs, quarters...but I always go back to walkers and that's the only breed I fell off of!!!

I don't dislike any breed but I've definately learned that different breeds have strengths in different areas!|`|BIR9olyxaa	No. Not at all. I think it's awful to judge an entire breed based on a couple of bad horses. And even if the breed is all "bad," there's always exceptions. It's like saying you hate all basketball players because they're rude- they certainly aren't all; there may be some, but not all.|`|0nos1iXlaa	I think eveyone has a least favorite everything.  Food, soda, season, etc.  As for me, I do not & never have liked appys.  Why?  Well, in my opinion, pencil necks, twiggy legs, mangy manes & tails that look like they have been chewed on by a goat.    Never have been an Arab fan either but for different reasons of course.
5knGTf5paa	right above the water|`|x6pUKUdNaa	10-12 inches above water line is fine. You don`t want it to close. The UV shield gets extremely hot and a few drops of water from it being to close will explode it.Plus the height will cast the light to the edges of the tank more.

Go what you think is the best for ur pet...|`|Jguzosm2aa	No, a hamster cage is much too small for a hedgehog.|`|wCDAYGd0aa	NO they need room to move and a that would be cruel|`|s80ED7Ygaa	Depends how big the cage is. I would have to say no though. The hamster cages are usually even too small for hamsters.|`|7a0b8d7dd5636ea72eeaaf763882e180aa	no a hedgehog CANNOT live in a hamster cage, it is WAY too small, hedgehogs need a large FLAT cage (they are not good climbers)its actually better to MAKE a hegehog cage out of a large underbed storage box.
iXijnCxOaa	Decreased testosterone is going to change some things.      In my experience (here come the thumbs down) spaying/neutering increases some things like separation anxiety and some fear responses (fear of thunder).      I've neutered a LOT of adult dogs.    From a common sense perspective... what types of behavioral, and physical changes would you expect to see if you decrease testosterone in a human male?  Google it.      People act as if spay/neuter doesn't change anything.  It does.  There are both positive and negative side effects.  In both my breeds spay/neuter softens coat and increases it tremendously.|`|csDhZDvraa	Bodily his sprem count will drop to zero because he is no longer in tact. Besides that there should be no other bodily changes. By this age he is obviously done growing  so his size will not be affected by it.     Emotionally he will calm down with not having to be always on the alert for females in heat.    He may still mount and tie with females who are not spayed(my neutured males will dog this if encountering a female in heat)    He may also still fight with intact males because the behavior is so ingrained.    EDIT: He may also be more intuned(less distracted by females) to his handler but thats more of a training thing then a neuturing thing.|`|bIaywrBCaa	I have had several adult dogs neutered and had no negative effects whatsoever. If anything it calms them down.|`|tPGxPDvBaa	I don't believe there are hardly any major changes.  Mostly helps with the roaming & aggressive behavior since they aren't looking or fighting for females. Otherwise I haven't seen much difference with my males neutered as adults.  They might be calmer & more loving /wanting more human attention.|`|qioH81tiaa	Behaviour is pretty much formed by the age of two, let alone 5.  A neuter at that age will do one thing, and one thing only - remove the ability to produce sperm.      There is obviously a reduction in testosterone - but most behaviour, even in male dogs, is NOT based simply on testosterone levels.      So, there are no negative consequences for neutering at such a late age - all physical and mental development is long finished.  Of course, any ill-treatment, or a poor temperament to start with, can result in changed behaviour in any dog, whether it has balls or not.|`|P8Q39vA4aa	There are no negative consequences or changes since hes fully grown.     Really there are more negative consequences with a dog neutered too early. There is no maximum age to neuter.|`|0I9Fm00Naa	5 years of age is really not a very ripe old age, Most dog's can be spayed or neutered up to about  10 years or age depending mostly on the breed and the physical condition of the animal.|`|tiRZwBPuaa	i got my dog spayed at the age 6 and it clam her down a little bit,but that was the olny thing.|`|eEeCIRDaaa	Neutering greatly reduces the risk of prostate cancer in dogs.  But my dog lost his will rome and became very chubby.  As far as emotions are concerned, dogs arnt people, they don't really realize that a piece of them is missing, it doesn't bother them.|`|9ea79964f4ddad1359a8089c6729bb4caa	As a rescue volunteer, I see many dogs go through spaying/neutering at an older age and the ONLY changes I have seen in males are: Less tendency toward marking of territory and less aggression toward other male dogs....that's it. Their personality and activity levels do not change at all. I have never seen a dog have dramatic changes from a neuter later in life, or early in life for that matter.    Edit: Calmer? I don't think neutering makes a dog calmer at all. It could possibly 'calm' the dog down in a sense since the testosterone level is down resulting in a more 'relaxed' dog.....but as far as happy, playfulness, that would not be decreased at all. My two neutered dogs are running around chasing each other and wrestling as we speak and both were neutered well into adulthood. I assure you, they are every bit as active and playful as they were before they got snipped.|`|ff4be252ca1bd5dd48919f16e87d90c2aa	To what I know there is no negative consequences about having a dog neutered however changes are it will chill the dog out, and calm it down if it was a little (or alot) giddy before.|`|18f339d2d88d8a05cc418425220b52e1aa	The changes will be hormonal.  There is no longer any testosterone surging through their blood stream.  Hormonal changes or the loss of a hormones varies in each dog.  As does menopause in women.  If a woman takes testosterone she will grow hair on her face & body.  If a man take estrogen he will develop boob & be more delicate.    Look up testosterone & see what it does.  Like all the different hormones each will be responsible for something.  One governs the size of the animal or person.    If you were to have your nuts removed what do you think it would do to you?    This site will tell you all about testosterone just apply it to dogs.  The chemicals & actions & reaction are about the same in all mamals    http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Testosteron...    I just had an adult rescued dog neutered about 6 weeks ago & he hasn't changed much.  Havn't noticed anything different, really.    He'a a fence dog & he still raises holly hell at the fence.|`|26PPwzrWaa	5 is not that old for most dogs.|`|70878cc978ee2e4a79b3b53284340f9caa	There are no negative consequences.I had a German Shepherd years ago.He was 3 and not yet neutered.He was aggressive towards some dogs,so I had him neutered and enrolled him in obedience classes and although he was initially aggressive towards a young,male black Lab that attacked him at the first class,by graduation,they were doing 5 minute down-stays together! Anton was never dog aggressive after that,and I believe that the neutering helped.Neutering also helps prevent prostate problems and of course prevents testicular cancer.As for your dog's behavior,he is getting older and more mature and is just calming down.He may also have cabin fever if it is cold where you are,and when warm weather comes,he will be happy to go out and play!    Edit: Yes,the whining may be due to him trying to adjust to his new home.He misses his old family,even if they treated him badly.|`|Yu7y6yfraa	Neutering would not cause psychological, emotional or physical consequences; with the exception of problems occurring during the surgery or after wards.  This is quite rare.    I have found most 5 year old dogs to be more layed back than ones up to 2 and 3 years old.  I think he has just mellowed out a bit.  Also, moving into a different environment could affect his behavior.    I am going on my 40+ years of living with pooches, as well as many years rescuing greyhounds from the racetrack at TJ, Mexico, and caring for them before and after being neutered.|`|7a0b8d7dd5636ea72eeaaf763882e180aa	truth be told, none have been documented in terms of emotional side effect.  dogs do not develop a manly "bond" to their testicles like human males do...the surgery itself can be a little harder to recover from in an adult but otherwise.    the only negative side effects of late neuter that have been documented are  late neutered dogs tend to continue marking and humping  they also are more likley to continue any dog agressive behavour.    it could be that the situation made him the dog you knew 3 yrs ago...new situation = new dog...without knowing the entire story its hard to say.  but as a behaviourist id be willing to say that change to behaviour was more situational than medical, though i would have a full blood panle done ot make sure theres also no underlying illnesses.|`|RT8LZy7gaa	The best thing about neutering, at any age, is that the dog is not likely to develop testicular cancer, which many intact males get later in life.  If he had any aggression issues, those should lessen. They probably won't go completely away, he may need additional training if this is an issue.    They say neutered males tend to be lazy. But if by lazy means they don't go in search of females and risk getting hit by cars or get in fights with unvaccinated dogs, I'll take lazy any day.    Besides any pain from surgery, there should not be any lingering physical pain after the scars heal if thats what you mean by psychological and emotional.  Dogs don't realize what's happened to them while they were knocked out so they can't hold grudges, etc.  that's reading too much human into a dogs make up.    He'll be much healthier in the long run.|`|701e2d7f00a2115b6c84b87bd5dfce4caa	Neutering has no negative consequences that I know of...unless there was trauma from being left at the vet but I've never heard of any.  Neutering is actually proven to protect the dog from getting certain cancers and diseases.|`|4c53bf469dfe96ac19d353f625f2d1daaa	I have never heard of emotional changes that are negative. The only thing I have ever heard was females leaking after spaying. So I don't think you need to worry, it should just mellow him out. He still has the chance of prostate cancer. Because it was done late but I think thats the only negative. I think he may be depressed a few days, but thats from hormone changes. So I hope I helped.|`|e2467d7f948480d119ffefaeb0f5655baa	I also have my own opinions on spaying and neutering. And I don't think 5 is an "old age" I believe that 5 is early enough to avoid most diseases associated with intact males/females.    At that age however, they can go through a sense of "loss" and sometimes even "depression" they lose a lot of hormones pretty fast and continue to lose the rest of them over the few months following the surgery.     Neutering and spaying later in life will often lead to weight gain as well as sometimes a calmer demeanor (which is why some people say to neuter because of behavior problems) as they don't have the hormones to lead them towards their ultimate goal of reproduction.     As for negative consequences, I really can't think of any except for possible wight gain but thats easily controlled!    I personally don't neuter mine before a year of age at the EARLIEST!   Hope I helped! =)
KxjUim7yaa	Whats with the apple cider vinegar? Maybe slip it in the food and leave the water alone|`|26PPwzrWaa	close the door then.     Putting out a bowl of water next to the toliet.|`|AA12322387	You said that you are treating their water?  Perhaps they don't like the taste of their new water and are seeking fresh water.|`|e2467d7f948480d119ffefaeb0f5655baa	They probably aren't drinking becasue of the treatment of vinegar in their water, the apple cider vinegar is beneficial but small amounts in their food or just syringe fed is sufficient, if it's affecting their drinking, just give them regular water.     As for the toilet, put non-toxic treatment in the toilet for a while, they sell toilet bowl cleaners that arre non-toxic to put in the tank (the stuff that turns the water blue but non toxic) and it keeps them away!   Hope I helped|`|Ti476VHkaa	Scowled him. Yell NO! If that don't work. Hit him (not in an abusive way) with a news paper.|`|4c53bf469dfe96ac19d353f625f2d1daaa	I don't think your dogs like what you are giving them. Just be sure you let them get enough water so they don't dehydrate. Like someone else said tell them no. But make sure you check and see if they will drink plain water in there bowl verses the potion you have mixed. Good Luck!|`|kBjzKyZyaa	they have latches you can install on the toilet lid that way the dogs wont be able to get it open|`|CjIMwg1Qaa	put viniger in the toilet   then let the dogs go to the toilet by themselves  or try leading them there  then when they try it   all they'll taste is bitterness  so maybe that will make them stop    when my sister wouldn't stop putting her hands in her mouth   my dad put lemons on her fingers and she made a face  and that made her stop for a while|`|Iyl5N9EKaa	Put a brick or something heavy on top. Give the dog a minute to figure out that they can't get in. If the dog keeps trying give him a firm "no" and lead them out of the bathroom. I told my dog all the time.. just be consistent and they should stop. I put ice cubes every now and then in my dogs dish as a treat or if my dog wouldn't drink when she was panting. Hope this helps.|`|UvFLnV9uaa	do u know of any thing ur dog is afraid of or doesn't like? maybe if there afraid of a toy or something put it on top of the potty. or try putting any food or juice they don't like in the water.|`|AxWxXdIZaa	You should spray something on the toilet that he doesnt  like the smell of or keep the door closed>|`|0I9Fm00Naa	In the first place you should have prevented it from the start, Dog's and cats are susceptible to some of the same deceases and bacterias the we humans are. You wouldn't let your own child drink from the toilet would you ? Then don't let you animal's either. Your best bet now is to place a mouse trap on the Lid seat and get in the Habit of keeping it closed, Tape it down if you have to. When they go in there and start fiddling around with the lid the trap will snap , even if it catches them on the nose it's alright They will quickly learn that this source of water is no longer available. Just make sure you have plenty of fresh drinking  water available to them.|`|pc7ZjexJaa	Close the bathroom door|`|gjD8pndjaa	Same thing you'd do when you want to discourage any behavior, scold with  a sharp "No!"|`|lTsDwY9Paa	Put a baby proof clip on the toilet seat. They're made to keep toddlers from opening the lid so they should keep your dogs out.

I just wear a cheap, but warm down jacket, with a hoodie sweater underneath, and I wear thin earmuffs underneath.  Also, if you wear sunglasses, it keeps the wind from whipping into your eyes.  Also, if you have any, wear thick riding boots.  If you don't, go bareback (if you can) and wear your winter boots.  They'll do.  Or you could wear thick fuzzy socks :)  I just ride bareback in the winter.  Last time I rode with a saddle, it snapped (literally) in the cold.  Fortunately it was its last few years we would be using it.  It was really old and starting to become brittle, but still.  Shouldn't have happened.  Okay, so also, wear winter glooves with grippies on them.  dont wear snowpants, they make too much noise!|`|cGRyDCpQaa	I have many winter getups lol. When I'm actually riding I wear jeans/breeches, boots, two pairs of thick socks, tall socks, tights, two shirts, a sweatshirt, two pairs of gloves, a headband, and a winter coat... if I feel like putting all that on (sometimes I'm too lazy lol.) Otherwise I just wear snowboarding pants and a winter coat (say if I'm just going to be standing around.)|`|Pn9tPYKbaa	i wear my dads big giant coveralls, and his wausal tobogin, with my moms worm fuzzy gloves. a few pair of socks under my boot, and a hoodie under the coverals, and my big fuzzy coat. its kinda hard to get in the saddle, but heck, its worth it:)|`|9IZ0CmxPaa	My friends make fun of me because I don't own a jacket...

Usually a headband because it's required for riders under age 18 to wear a helmet at my barn (i'm 16) and a hat doesn't fit under my helmet. :)     It gets really cold here, but I work at the barn so I'm moving around a lot and I'm usually warm.

RT8LZy7gaa	Sounds like they're doing ok at the moment, sizing each other up.  As long as you're in the room, that's ok.  I'd separate them when you're not home until you know they are friendly towards each other.    Right now I have a stray in my den, but my male cat hisses at him through the door. The stray is friendly, but my male has dominance issues.  We'll see if he will be able to live with me or if he'll need to be adopted out.  If he and my male can come to terms, the other cat - my female - has no problem with other cats usually.  The stray is used to other cats and dogs so he's not the problem.  But my boy is the master of his domain....we'll see!    Good luck with yours!  It sounds like they're off to a good start at least!|`|xAibdGsTaa	Yeah that's really good if I were you I would bring them together slowly,  like a little at a time then the more and more you do this the More they will start to like each other.|`|AA12322387	If cats aren't properly introduced they can dislike eachother for life.  Cats are very finicky creatures.  There are many sources on the net that provide advice when introducing cats.  You should research it and choose the one that seems to be the best fit for you.

rsp33Aysaa	1.  10-20 strides?? seriously?  I can only tell the distance 2-3 strides before a jump.  And I usually approach jumps with only 5 or less strides.  But no, my horse isn't all that great at striding (I'm not good at it either!) so it's always 2 strides before the jump where I either collect, hold, or push.  2. If you've been teaching her for months, maybe she doesn't need to be pulling manes.  3.  Don't get nervous.  Heels down, chin up, chest out.  In hunters you want to be snooty yet professional, and just let the course flow.  You'll be practicing a lot at home, so just ride it at the show like you do during practice.|`|Oiabe82gaa	1) I don't know exactly what you mean by your horse telling you distances, but I am assuming that you are trying to say your horse strides out his own distances while you are jumping.  Most horses have a pretty good idea about jumping, but for them to be in the exact spot for take off (approx the same distance off of the fence as the fence is high), well that's your job!  2)Some people find it easier to learn something by watching others do it. So if you are competent at Mane Pulling I would show her and talk your way through it so as she picks up as many pointers and tips as possible!  3)Find out about warm-up ring etiquette on "A" circuit.  Try to relax as much as possible, I know this is hard, but your horse WILL pick up on your anxiety. If your nerves do get the best of you (like mine do before EVERY Dressage test I ever do), give "Rescue Remedy" a try. It is 100% natural, does not make you drowsy in any way, but simply takes the edge off of your stress. I have used it for last season and it is amazing, and my Dressage results are WAY better because of it!!!  Good luck!|`|ejj2N3uaaa	1. Uh, a good horse may see the distance by himself, but not 20 strides away. You have no way of knowing if your horse sees it from that far away. Too much can happen in that distance. And I'm not sure, exactly, how he would "tell" you? My horse doesn't generally speak English. My jumper automatically rates himself; he'll find his own distance without my help, but he's not going to say (20 strides away), "Hey, you up there, you see that dark spot in the dirt? That's where I'm taking off from...got it?"    2. Some people are not as adept at mane pulling (or braiding, or banding, or clipping, or whatever) as others. Personally, I hate doing that stuff--my mother bands my horses at shows and also puts their fake tails in (I show AQHA all-around). Practice makes perfect, though, so until your friend has a chance to practice over and over after watching someone who knows how to do it, she can't really "get it."    3. If you've never shown before, I don't think the 3'0 children's hunter at an A show is the place to start. You may be skilled enough to jump a 3'0 course and you may have a horse nice enough to pin at an A show, but you need to know ring etiquette and standards before you attempt that type of show. Otherwise, just talk to your trainer and she'll tell you what you need to work on and master as well as what you should expect. I'd also suggest visiting a similar show (watch that class at that level) and seeing what people are doing--in terms of warm ups, course decisions, riding attire, etc.|`|RUzBDX6Jaa	1. I'm not sure.  Put on a muzzle so your horse can't tell you stuff anymore.  My horse doesnt talk to me (i dont jump, either)  --------------------------------------...  2. google it, print off an instruction sheet, or buy a grooming guide in book form for your friend.  --------------------------------------...  3. Pretend that you're schooling your horse, but try harder :) That's what I did in my first show!  It worked.|`|9IZ0CmxPaa	1. My horse is actually really good with his spots but you know what you could do? A lot of people put a pole half a stride from the fence you're going to jump and that teaches a horse where to take off from. Be careful with this though - your horse can become dependent and it may be hard to get him away from depending upon that pole. Or you could try practicing with smaller jump and teaching him to go slow. I imagine if he jumps too soon he's probably going a little too fast to begin with. Keep him slow and collected and work from an "ex" fence and just get bigger and bigger.    2. How old is your friend? Perhaps it'll take her awhile to learn... but keep at it. It's sort of an important thing to do if she herself wants to learn... I don't really have any tips for making the mane pulling process any easier haha    3. Just make sure you have a lot of confidence and you know you're hunter's good, so prove it! I'm actually really nervous, I just got my new boy and he just turned five and I've been training him to jump for the last year... this Spring were going to go into the Baby Greens which is just two foot, but still! He's never even shown in his life! So we're both in the same boat :)  -and if you're horse show doesn't go that well, oh well! there's always next time. Never work yourself up over a bad ride, it'll kill you in the end :P    oh and about the pole thing I suggested, you said you were jumping 3 feet and I've never tried it for a jump larger than 2 feet so if you do try that technique go smaller first and see if it helps at all. (my horse was trained to jump like this)
ejj2N3uaaa	It's extremely common with young and/or green horses because they haven't learned to balance themselves at that speed yet.    A lot of it is just a time thing--even though you might feel like you're not making any progress, consistent riding and canter work will help him build strength.    Don't push too hard with the circles/collection or you'll end up putting him in a "false" frame/collection--he might have his head cranked down, for instance, but not really be "through" in his back and hind end. It's better to allow him more freedom with his head/neck right now and teach him to engage his hindquarters (lots and lots and lots of transitions!!) and move forward. Eventually, he'll also straighten out and settle (I'm guessing he probably wiggles, feels like his head's one way and his tail's another, may be too fast, and feels like he's going to fall over on the turns?).     Use a fairly soft bit if at all possible and do light half halts while pushing him forward with your leg. Don't force his head down/in, but encourage him to give to the bit and lower his head/neck while at the same time pushing forward from the hind end. If he's not moving forward, let go of his face--you'll only teach him to travel on the forehand (been there, done that).     Be patient, be consistent, and it'll all come together. Don't worry if he's not looking so great now--it's normal. He'll get it eventually.|`|h38M7Eofaa	lounging with side reins will definitely help!  not only does it get the spunk out of your horse, but it makes them so so flexible (it'll take time)!  circling is good if you're having troubles with leads.  it is totally normal for a young horse to be in consistent at canter!  it will take time and if you're a good rider, he'll get it faster.|`|74HBMPduaa	My gelding is almost six and I just started him under saddle a few months ago.  This is still pretty young and it is common for them to feel unbalanced.  I have found that it really helps to focus my weight to the outside around turns.  This keeps them from leaning in and doing 'motorcycle turns'.  Also, once he is pretty calm at the canter in the arena, take him out to an open pasture.  You will find that balance often has to be relearned without the arena wall to use as a crutch.  Just focus on keeping your weight on your outside seat bone. This works because the horses tendency is to lean into the turn which causes them to rush.  You sitting to the outside makes them step under themselves in an attempt to keep you centered, they will slow down and balance more in turn.      Good luck.|`|RUzBDX6Jaa	Its perfectly common.  Lunging work will help, and so will a BIT of counter-cantering.  And yes, collection and circles will help.  So will plenty of transitions!  :)  My horse has never been unbalanced, but she's a dressage horse.  Yes, its common, and with more practise, it'll get better!|`|3YHZUuhyaa	Is the horse doing a really speedy canter? My horse had the same problem (he was also 5). He's now 6 and he has a really nice canter. It's not speedy anymore!   To get him to slow down his canter, I would tell him "easy" and pull back without letting him break into a trot. If he just ignored me, I would stop, back up, and try again. Just keep repeating that until he understands that when you say "easy", it means slow down. Do a lot of circles and transitions (walk to trot, trot to canter, canter to walk, walk to canter, etc.)    Stay consistant!     I hope this helps! good luck!|`|dL1MJPYhaa	Young horses are more often than not unbalanced in their work. They are still finding their feet. I like to use the outside rein a bit. If you feel your horse is losing the control a light check to bring him back in is really effective. Leg yielding is really effective too. Start on a small circle and leg yield out. It makes them think.     Hope this helps!
wF52XMxAaa	An off the cuff list of best-talking birds (more by clarity of diction than vocabulary, or budgies would be on it)    1) African Grey. see http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WKeY9j5P6...    2) Yellow-headed amazons (yellow-nape, yellow criwb, blue front, maybe orange wing). see http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVBILtDrg...    3) Mynah birds. see http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iYNCAT6NJ...    4) Eclectus. see http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x2BXhgXV-...    5) quaker parrots. see http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0niAeb0po...    6) Indian ringneck parakeets, Malee ringnecks. see http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bauj-buxR...    7) Senegal (or other poicephalus - red-bellied or un-cape) see http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iYNCAT6NJ...    But be aware than not all birds will talk, even if they're from a species that generally does.    Indian ringnecks do talk well.  The prices on any of these depend where you are - e.g., amazons cost about five times as much in Australia as in the U.S., while Mallee ringnecks are just the opposite.    All of these birds require a lot of attention, live a long time, and are from moderately to very loud.  You'll need to devote hours every day for 20-70 years to them.|`|Czh1fbQgaa	African greys are known to be the best talkers on the planet. Amazons are also very good talkers. They are both over $1000, but I don't know exact price.|`|uIk9MAnDaa	parrots|`|2DLqsVFcaa	penguins|`|IxuMTGd4aa	Hi    Just by the fact you want a bird that talks tells me you are a new owner, am I correct? Do NOT get a bird just because it talks! Some don't even talk, and they are a lot harder to care for then you think. And the best talking bird are some of the hardest to care for.|`|ecf159d9c2d48432e189d0cac81882e2aa	From my experience, African Greys.     My grandma's friend has one and she's learned to immitate the door opening and her husband saying, "Honey, I'm home!" And now she never knows if it's the bird or her husband!   They are very expensive, but exactly how much depends on where you get them and where you live.     I also know a Macaw and a Cockatoo that are really easy to understand.|`|IvrewcBXaa	The birds who talk the best and produce the best imitations of human speech are generally VERY long lived.  They are also intelligent enough to require a lot of attention.  When I say "a lot" I mean that to have a happy, healthy, talkative bird you have to spend HOURS a day with the animal.  Forever.     African greys, for example, can live into their seventies, and Amazons have been recorded living over 100 years.  Even "short lived" parrots are often 25+ year pets.    Birds who do not get enough attention can mutilate themselves severely or become destructive and aggressive.  It is very common to see adult birds pluck themselves bald and bloody due to lack of appropriate interaction.    Birds are not a beginner pet.  They are likely to outlive you, have health problems that are nothing like mammal diseases, and they require tons of work.    Oh, and they are loud: difficult to nap around, hard to find pet sitters for, and not welcome in all living situations.    They are amazing animals, but many end up in situations that do not have the resources to keep them happy and healthy.|`|q6zK7QNtaa	I currently own 3 cockatiel's and just bought an umbrella cockatoo. my cockatiels whistle adams family and andy griffith and a bunch of different whistles. you really can't hear them real clear as far as talking..some can depends on how much time you spend with them. some just won't at all.Some downfalls of the larger birds are..the poop mess is bigger,they have potential to break skin and fingers with their claws/beak(never happened to me but never say never),they squawk REALLY loud. that's just some but to me the pros outweigh the cons and wouldn't trade my cockatoo for nothing. I got a great deal on mine cage and all but the bird alone is pretty pricey . anywhere from $1000.00-1700.00 so shop around and spend time visiting with the bird before you buy 'cause once your in it you are in it for life. big birds also have long lifespans! cockatoo 80ish yrs cockateils like 35ish. so make sure you want that responsibility.Also decide who the bird will be passed on to and be taken care of when you pass or get to old to take care of it. just really do some heart and soul searching and go from there. don't buy one cause their cool or thinking they will talk. Talk to people that you trust that have experience with big birds..ha ha!  They are very social beings and curious oh yeah...left unattended they will chew base boards furniture anything. please dont buy one and leave it in or on the cage with no interaction that creates an unhappy and stressed life for the baby that can be avoided.  blessed be!!|`|ZVlWi6llaa	I have a male kakarikis, he talks up a storm, very clear as well.

Y4pfVX10aa	it will go back but you should take her to the vet to find out why and fix it or it might happen agian good luck|`|SqWJCZyeaa	Call your vet. It'll grow back, but the reason she's been biting her tail may vary. It may be fleas or ticks.|`|MQJ8w56Qaa	Why she bit the tail is the real issue.  Could be a health problem or likely a boredom problem.  Dogs will find ways to release energy if their owners do not help them to. Many dogs will tear things up in the house or yard, excessively bark, or bite themselves, etc.    All dogs need daily walks. It's what dogs do naturally. It is the best way for them to expend their natural energy.  http://www.cesarmillaninc.com/tips/basic...    Start taking your dog for 2 walks a day, morning and evening.  Your small dog only needs 15-30 mins each walk. This will be a great mental and physical for your dog and of course walking is good for us too.  You will very quickly see a new and improved, happier dog.|`|gjD8pndjaa	It will grow back, but you have to consider the underlying reason ti was bitten off in the first place.  Allergies, mange, fleas are all possible causes.  A vet visit may be in order|`|yLwKWzIUaa	if you've determined (through vet visits) that she has no skin irritation or allergy then the reason she's bitting her tail is probably because she's bored out of her mind. fox terriers are active dogs and need a lot of exercise. walk her more often and for longer periods of time. you can also buy Kongs which you can stuff with peanut butter, treats, etc.. to keep her busy.|`|t9Fxx75uaa	Wow, sounds like allergies or hot spots.  Get to the vet.  The hair will grow back but you have to see why the dog is doing this.

4253fb6106243c0983e2542e5a7a5adaaa	What happens to you if you wear high boots laced tightly?  When you go to do the same activities in slippers of low-top tennies, your ankles are weak.    Personally, I proscribe to the 'natural as possible' theory.  If you wrap a horse's legs all the time, the wraps become an artificial support which disallows the legs to become strong enough to support themselves without them.    However, if you're doing high-intensity workouts, not wrapping can cause undue stress.    I would say that if you're working slowly, there should be no need to wrap, but if you're turning a lot and performing intricate maneuvers, wraps are necessary.  Simple cantering around an arena carefully shouldn't require them, but turning and increasing rate, etc up and down quite frequently may require them.    A 3-4 year old horse has physically matured from the knees down.  They're bones are no longer as soft as they were at 2 or younger.  She's recently matured from the knee to the shoulder and likely is nearly as tall as she'll get.  Now gaining width, breadth and a small amount in height is how she'll grow.    Use common sense and be consistent.  Learn how to identify when her legs are fatigued and learn the proper ways to rub her down afterward.  You may find that at this point in her training, wraps aren't necessary, but a good leg rub-down after her workout does wonders.|`|IMPvzBk1aa	Most of the research I've read advises against it.  Wrapping interferes with the adaptation process that the tissues of the legs go through to develop strength and resilience.  Wrapping may prevent dings and superficial injuries,  but there are boots to protect against that.  Wrapping seldom is sufficient to prevent internal injury from over-exercising anyway, so there is really little good reason for wrapping a healthy leg.  Often more harm than good is done since it takes expertise to wrap correctly so as not to do damage. Also, overheating of the tissues beneath bandages can render tendons more vulnerable to injury.   This is a good article on exercise physiology..................    http://www.thehorse.com/ViewArticle.aspx...|`|RUzBDX6Jaa	Yes, it will because as she's young, her bones are a bit brittler :)  I would wrap her legs- just in case.  It IS your decision, but I know what I would do.|`|u1HahCoqaa	Wraps, for working (Usually polos) should not harm the horse, no matter the age. If they do, then you have messed up the wrap!     So you can if you want. If you think she needs the protection (Ie she overreaches or tends to hit herself) or the support (Not that polos are very supportive) then use them. Otherwise, well, it's your choice. It should not hurt them, and it might be good for her to get used to things on her legs.|`|rsp33Aysaa	assuming you are talking about wrapping her during the exercise,  wrapping shouldn't hurt her at all, especially if you don't do it very tightly.  The only reason to wrap her would be if you've seen her interfere while cantering on her own.  If she hasn't had any problems, she would probably be fine without wrapping.  You just want to make sure that, if you do wrap, you don't keep the wraps on for more than 12 hours at a time, as that tends to irritate some horses' legs.|`|5TCewPYRaa	I think wraps would be an excellent idea, especially on her front legs, but all 4 for proper balance and support...but the front legs are more likely to be injured and can "splint" where the splint bone breaks off from the bone and in an attempt to fuse it back into place a bump forms---the leg will always be weaker in this spot and the horse will put more weight on the non-splinted leg---over-time the leg with more pressure will splint out as well due to the added pressure and weight put on it...      A good idea would be Saratoga Wraps--they offer great support and can be used as the horse grows, unlike Sports Medicine Boots which need to be purchased in co-ordination with the horses height, since a 3 or 4 yr old is still growing you may find yourself needing to get bigger SMB's later on which can be quite pricey--better to wait until they are full grown before purchasing these...      Just Google Search "Saratoga Wraps" and you will find a few sites where you can purchase them--they are definitely worth the price! I've had mine for 9 yrs already and the velcro is just starting to wear out!     If you are going to go with the SMB's I recommend Professional's Choice SMB Elite (get the Value Pack--you will need all 4 boots anyways) or Classic Equine's Legacy System boots--great boots!     Good Luck!  BB|`|Oiabe82gaa	There are 2 trains of thought regarding this.  1, is use wraps and protect the horse, using overreach boots too.  2, and my train of thought, that has worked on both of the horses we have started from 4 year olds, is not to wrap. This way they learn for themselves not to overreachh or brush.   I use wraps and boots now, but know that in the event that we lose a boot or forget to put them on he will be safe.  It's the same when jumping, if a young horse starting out in jumping wears boots he won't learn how much it hurts when he knocks a rail, this way he wont respect them, When schooling over jumps I never use boots, this way he learns if he hits a rail it's gonna hurt.  I always use boots when competing!!!  Good luck!|`|gZ1XZBBKaa	yeah wrap them, and walk her around to make sure she is comfortable. or u can uses slider boots, like reiners use, they are great. lots of protection, and comfortable for them. and the dont fall off, and dont have a chance of comming undome and the chance of her stepping on the wrap and breaking her leg. that would be bad. hope that helped.|`|AUJ6uG0oaa	No for 2 reasons;    1.  It is not good for the legs of a healthy horse.  It is better to let their body move and respond to different physical demands naturally.  By wrapping the legs you will not be conditioning her tendons properly and it will do more damage in the long run than good.    2.  If she is a really green horse, she may not like wraps on her legs.  If you do decide to put wraps on, I would lunge her at walk/trot/canter first to see how she responds.  Not all horses take to it well at first.  If she is very green, it would be wise to test her from the ground first.  It would be safer to just not use them.|`|ejj2N3uaaa	You'll hear a lot of people tell you that you should ALWAYS have your horse's legs wrapped when riding, especially with young horses, or you risk all sorts of terrible problems.    Personally, I think most of it is stupid. In 20 years of owning horses, my family has never had a horse injure a leg (tendon, bone, muscle, or otherwise) while riding...only during turnout. That's not to say that it can't and doesn't happen, of course, because it certainly does. However, if your horse is physically developed enough to start ridden work (which I'm assuming she is) and you're taking it slow, the extra "support" provided by the wraps really isn't going to be all that necessary. On the other hand, if she's the type of horse that interferes a lot or is all over the place (hitting her legs with other hooves, tripping, etc.) then wrapping could help protect her from cutting herself.     I've heard that constantly wrapping a horse's legs puts the horse more at risk for injury when the horse's legs aren't wrapped because the muscles/tendons/whatever never had the chance to strengthen. This could be a complete myth, but I thought I'd pass it along :).     I've owned various breeds (QHs, Arabians, TBs, mutts, ponies, etc.), ridden multiple disciplines over the years (jumping, dressage, hunters, western performance stuff), and never wrapped for under saddle work and have not experienced a problem because of it. If a horse incurred a leg injury, it was unrelated to the lack of wraps. I did used to use splint boots and bell boots on my jumper, but I haven't used the bells since he caught one of them with another foot and flipped over a solid 2'6 jump. I quit using the splints because he never had any issues that caused interference, so they really didn't seem necessary. I did use bells on my QH the first summer I got him because of a hoof/shoe issue, but that was it.     Then again, my sister, who gives lessons and rides out of a fancy h/j barn, will never ride her horse without wraps.     To each his own, I guess, and if you are willing to wrap and have the desire to do so, go ahead. Just be sure you do it correctly because a poor wrapping job can cause more problems than not wrapping.|`|NiQAfFUPaa	I would not wrap the horses because you will develop the tendons as well as you would like.    If you put shoes on you may consider some polo's or some covering on the front.    Contrary to popular belief, a horse whom is not stressed at a young age will never gain the same bone density as one that was stressed.  This was determined from studies.  To much is not good; not enough is not good.
qw9ZjAlDaa	Yes, the BLM does have adoptions in the Northeast.  Here is their adoption schedule for 2009.  The horses come from other parts of the country, as there is no BLM land and no wild horses living in that part of the country.  http://www.blm.gov/pgdata/content/wo/en/...|`|vow5ULxTaa	the BLM has adoption agencys in the northeast but dosn't have preserves for the horses to live on.  Most of the mustangs and burros ae transported fro mNevad or there other western branches.

z01moLIvaa	It depends on the sizes of the rats for the ferret nation. Anything a rat can fit it's head through, it can fit it's whole body through. The bar spacing is 1" on the FN so you should only use it for adult male rats or larger females. The female rats are generally much smaller than males so a half inch spacing is recommended for them. If you need to, you could cover up the bars outside with a coated wire mesh (wire cloth) that's found at hardware stores.  I'd pick the FN because it's easier to clean, it's bigger, and you don't have to cover the wire flooring (because there is none). It also requires no tools to put together  Here's a forum that people have posted pics of their ferret nations. Some are covered with extra wiring for smaller rats-  http://www.goosemoose.com/component/opti...|`|qGy9fR7xaa	I like the first one, but i don't know if this is just my rats being unclean, but won't they pee on the plastic floors? I'm just used to a cage that has a bottom full of bedding, where the rats can pee, but not walk it. I haven't had a cage with plastic floors, so i just thought, wouldn't they pee on it and stuff!?  But, yeah, i think both cages are suitable for the amount of rats you're buying!  ~Good luck!!~|`|Jguzosm2aa	Go with the ferret nation cage - it's got solid floors, so it's more friendly on little rat feet.|`|FmIAKDJLaa	The first one so you wont have to deal with the wires|`|OtjXWzOZaa	the ferret one it looks nicer and lots space for the rats|`|R0WgaUdgaa	I would go with the Martins simply because of the spacing in between the bars. If you are getting young rats they will be able to get right out of it plus the shelves are solid plastic and when they pee, and they will pee, it will stink.  With the martins just make sure you get the powder coated so the metal does not rust from the rat urine. It also makes it easier to clean.|`|fdWzQMQqaa	Well I myself have a hamster and i used a wire cage because at first i used a plastic one and She has escaped because the plastic wore down. I understand u want about 4 rats. If they are small i would suggest a medium cagee not a ferret cage because ferrets are about the size of a kitten.   If they are large i would probaly suggst the ferret cage. Hope this helps!|`|z9NHRzk9aa	the last one isnt a cage its a playpen so i would go with the top one because it big and rats need big trust me|`|b6400b04a0e3413ba30570ad0aa8cd2baa	The ferret Nation is the greatest cage that you can get. I have it for my girls and it's wonderful. I don't like the Martins cage simply because of the wire bottoms. And a the Ferret Nation at only $150 is an amazing price so go for that one. Like the other person said though make sure that the rats can't fit through the bars. If so just get the wire mesh and it works great. That's what i had to do for mine and it works perfectly|`|bIynPnyGaa	The Ruud Cage (R-699)  thats what i recomend.  im getting that in a month.  i love it.
qw9ZjAlDaa	Polo wraps don't offer much support at all, they really are more about protection.  I wouldn't suggest them as a means of support for showjumping.  I would look at something specifically designed for that purpose.  Yes, they may be expensive but it's better to spend $100 now on a good pair of boots than thousands of dollars later on vet bills.  I like Sport Medicine Boots for good all around support...but they don't have the right "look" for the show ring.  You might also try tendon boots.    EDIT:  They do make quite a few soft tendon boots...either leather or neoprene that may work with her cold splint.  I know Roma makes some, and I think Eskadron may even make some too.|`|162JD1S5aa	there is no support in polos, they are only good for protection, i would use a running bandage or ace if its support your looking for, you can also use vet rap but learn how to put them on first, to tight an you will do more damage and to loose will do nothing, good luck|`|NlHRKeycaa	The wraps offer support but not protection if your horse over reaches and hits a tendon. thats why tendon boots are so popular with show jumpers. Why dont you try the eskadron boots with the sheep skin on the inside. they are quite soft.|`|7OBgjOaMaa	I'd try the TBOOTS, they have a soft gel inside them that conforms to protect around leg problems. They're also very, very inexpensive for the quality, and are defiantly show worthy! Or, you can try Saratoga wraps. They are my favorite!

They are not good for bearded dragons and yes they are hard for them to digest. Super worms, wax worms, phoenix worms would be ok. Also I do hope that you are giving him a fresh salad daily. He needs this too to help with his digestion.

If you keep him on sand or any other loose substrate, he could be impacted--a serious and possibly life-threatening problem.  These guys need frequent soaks/baths.

Just make sure nothing big is wrong. My dog snores and has the booger sounds every now and then. Good Luck!|`|Ee2fwrqoaa	Pretty doubtful that this problem is related to the neutering.  You need to have your vet refer you to a canine internal medicine vet.  We aren't vets, and even if we were, we certainly couldn't diagnose over the internet.|`|Fz5TpgISaa	I have a 11 yr old doxie.  He has allergies and has had them for years,,, he did not develop until later though.  At 2 years old, your dog just became an official adult.  It could be an URI or it could be allergies.  Your best bet would be to take him to the vet to get him checked out.  No one's advice on here will be a good enough answer, only the Dr.'s.  Good luck!
MQJ8w56Qaa	I think the walks during your lunch hour is perfect.  Also she will need a good walk before you leave for work and when you return at the end of the day.  This may be enough for her.

bDPVRtCNaa	All fish require tanks. Bowls are not suitable habitats.     You could buy a five gallon aquarium kit, and an aquarium heater and house a single male Betta.    All fish require maintenance on your part. You will have to perform weekly partial water changes of about 25%. Never do a complete water change.|`|Ik6WOcw3aa	There is no reason a fish should ever be in a bowl. And if you are looking for a fish that has the least amount of care needed, look for a different pet.

Dr.Lung|`|V1Ev5s1laa	DONT GET A GOLDFISH!!!!! they require a 20 gallon tank for 1. get a betta and 2.5-5 gallon tank with a filter and heater....set the heater for 78 degrees F. feed him 2 pellets a day and dont feed him on weekends. and do 20% water changes once a week and youll be fine.|`|dE5fs9yzaa	To be fair to any animal you get, everything needs some attention. If you want just one fish, get at least a 1-2 gallon tank with heater and then get one male betta. Without a filter you will need to change the water more often then with a filter, but you can get away with it. But don't get a betta and put it in a bowl. They need temp. around 76-78 and rooms are not usually that warm. Please don't get a goldfish and put it in a bowl either! Goldfish are dirty fish and need at least a ten gallon when very small and excellant filters. I'd get the small tank and betta.|`|dcZoWzeQaa	you can have shrimp. they are very exciting to watch. especially red cherry shrimp. you can have 10 per gallon since they are so small (1 inch) and produce little waste. and they easily reproduce|`|Fx9bxZ8aaa	ina bowl,no fish can be kept.you can try getting at least a 2.5 gallon tank and you can add a male betta.they don't require anything but water and food.they do not die easily.they will live for at least a year and a half.they cost from 2-14 dollars.depends on which type you want.you can get a normal one or get another one like a crowntail or a halfmoon or maybe a delta tail.by the way goldfish die super easily.and they grow huge and they can't be in a bowl.it's like you buy them and a while later in the tank they all start dieing.so unless you want dead fish then get goldfish but if you want a happy living fish that will not suffer like the goldfish then get a betta and problem solved.and by the way i looked at your question and it says that you want as fish that will blow bubbles.a betta blows bubbles when it wants a mate and he will make tons of bubbles called a bubblenest.|`|WIsxqR7caa	Sucka fish, they will keep their tank clean while eating algea, You practicly dont even have to care for em|`|kWpUh6uKaa	I just bought a goldfish.

bbf1ccedee90968c8671f9573ff1c7c0aa	It's not a good idea to get a pit bull unless it is a puppy or has been exposed to children in the shelter and assessed as it's hard to know its background and behaviour and whether it has been socialised with children.    I'm not saying all pit bulls are aggressive, some can be excellent family pets, but you need to know how to handle one and train one. They need a lot of exercise and some solid obedience training.     If your parents (or whoever owns it) wants to keep it they will need to get a behaviourist in to assess his behaviour and give you tips on how to stop the aggression. It can be possible, but not always. Giving your dog a couple of long walks or runs or bike rides a day (an hour each for a pit bull) will help calm him down. Also a 4 year old especcially can be overly excitable, tell her to act very calmy around him and with adult supervision them give him treats when he is nice.    For now the children shouldn't be allowed too close to the dog, especcially the four year old without an adult there. A pit bull is big enough to kill a four year old if he really did attack. Always have an adult with him around children and if need be use a muzzle if he starts to bite until you get someone to look at his behaviour.    If you either can't afford to get someone in or the risk is too great you can always rehome him to an single person or couple (without children) who have lots of experience with pit bulls.|`|4c53bf469dfe96ac19d353f625f2d1daaa	You need some experience to handle a 6 mo old pit bull pup. The best thing is go to a class to learn before someone gets hurt. Pit bulls are great dogs with responsible people. Please call a professional, its sad the dog is outside  they like to be with the pack. But if this dog is aggressive you need to maybe reconsider. Good Luck!|`|XV0b3ghgaa	NO they are not good to have around kids. Those dogs love to fight.Keep the kids away and keep them safe.|`|WbyFUQJbaa	Many dogs don't like little kids.  Kids can be rough and hurt dogs and not even think of it.  I'm guessing it wasn't attacking them from what you said.  Sounds more like it was trying to play.  My dog used to bark and be aggressive and bite, and he was just playing like a normal dog.  He grow out of this with training and age.  The dog you have is is a very playful stage, and you should not be letting the 4 year old around it.  They can knock the kid over running around.   Pit bulls are great to have!  They are like Labs, people!  Just because people train them to fight doesn't mean they are evil animals.  I thought America was informed of this already?  What did you do when this happened?  Are you SURE it was an attack and not just playing?|`|9a0a2aee22dc10abe447c3e37948f718aa	In all honesty, pitbulls are really not a child friendly dog - especially if it's an outside dog.... UNLESS it has of course had the opportunity in the past to adjust to children and has had a lot of human contact in the past.    Has the dog been neutered? If not, please speak to a vet regarding this. If it is a male, it can usually get aggressive.     Also, where were the children when the dog became aggressive? Was it in the area where the dog has free-roam? It could be a case of it showing its dominance over new people/creatures/etc.|`|izQn53q2aa	Pit bull are actually generally nice dogs for the most part.  However, they don't do well with children.  They don't like the fast movements and the noise.  So, while pit bulls are nice dogs, in this situation I recommend that you sell the dog and try another breed such as Spaniels, Retriever or lab.  These three are all great with children.  The dogs have just as much energy and love to take naps with kids.  I personally have a brittany Spaniel, and my cousin has a golden retriever.  Both are fantastic around kids.  This website   http://www.dogbreedinfo.com/   has information on just about every breed including the shedding amount and the temperament.|`|Iyl5N9EKaa	Pit bulls should not be first time pets. If its outside then it hasn't had proper training to be around people or other dogs. The owner and dog should be in obedience school.. i know this advice is always being told, but its true. It teaches the owner, not just the dog. If this isn't resolved NOW the dog will bite... especially a 4 yr old and the dog will be destroyed. They are naturally aggressive dogs. There were originally breed to be fighting dogs. I am not getting into the pit bull war as I am sure this question will start, they just require proper owners who have experience.|`|Fz5TpgISaa	This is a question I would LOVE to answer.  Pit bulls are wonderful pets (I  have a 6 month old).  One of the problems with this puppy is becuase they are an outside dog (lack of socialization).  It is most important to socialize your dog with kids, humans, and other pets when they are young.  He is probably unsure how to act around the children becuase he is new to his surroundings.  The children's high energy excitement may make his nervous and uneasy.  He needs to slowly get use to them... have the kids calmly let him sniff them with their hands.  Be calm yourself, dogs feed off people's energy.  Put yourself in his shoes... new home and new faces and the kids aare shorter making them right at his level... makes him nervous.  Be patient and give it time.. he will come around. Like I said pit bulls are great dogs and very loyal to their families.  Good luck!|`|SqWJCZyeaa	Your dog probably feels as if he is dominant over the smaller ones. Since they are small and he is big, he's in charge. I have nothing against pit bulls but since he tried to attack you should give that dog back to the shelter. If your family really wants a dog, go get a Labrador. So you really shouldn't have an aggressive dog in the house. Especially with younger children. You should love animals, they are are beautiful things, and matter much to our eco system.|`|Y4pfVX10aa	some dogs dont like kids but i would take a class and keep the kids away and if you have to give the dog away make sure they dont have kids goo luck|`|xAibdGsTaa	Well it might be because when it was really small the dog was abused  by little kids or maybe just people.|`|GLsCVPCuaa	if the dog is not going to be cared for and just left outside you guys may be in for trouble later...the dog needs to be in a home that understands him and allows him to live WITH them not outside...good luck    they should not be a first time pet|`|yh3OBqyTaa	If your six month old pit puppy is already showing a tendancy for ferocious behavior and you have small children at home, perhaps you need to re-think your choice of pets.

Brushing  with a rubber brush will also help remove the flakes & massage the skin & coat & help spread the natural body oil.  Zoom groom is the best one I have used.

Boston terriers can get dry skin from too much bathing. Only wash them when it is necesarry.  Or it is just winter and he has dry skin. Do some googling around.|`|dL1MJPYhaa	Hi there.    Use a good shampoo and conditioner once or twice a month. I recommend a product that has oatmeal and aloe vera in it. There are leave on conditioners but I would let it soak in for a few minutes and then rinse off. Make sure the shampoo is thoroughly washed off as that can cause flaky skin.    Feed a good quality food and you can add an oil to it. Vegetable oil is effective. Or tuna in oil is also good. Hill's foods make a diet for sensitive skin and I have a few clients who use it with good results. That is mainly used for itchy dogs. Flaxseed oil is good for dry coats.    Hope this information helps.|`|ALNOT9ELaa	Feed him a can of sardines and let him out to do his runny business....very good for the skin and coat!
Fz5TpgISaa	Definately Italian greyhound/ chihuahua mixed. As far as your question... Italian greyhounds are "needy" when it comes to getting affection from their owners... and chihuahuas are "needy" as far as being the number one in their owners life (more like greedy) but at the same time, they can very independant... so as far as him always being up your butt, thats the chihuahua and as far as being lovable and cuddly, thats the greyhound.|`|tPGxPDvBaa	Well he is extremely cute & easy to see why he is spoiled!

1dGdF6abaa	hey!  all these ideas are good, however, let me tell you what has worked for me.  the pic you included looks VERY easy to clean.  trust me i know.  except for the wood thing.  however, i saw in the grocery store the other day, that they actually make liners for rabbit and guinea pig cages!!!  making it sooo much easier and more sanitary!  so my first couple of pigs i put in 2 large rubbermade tubs connected by a coffee can.  they loved it.  SO much room to run around!  and enough space to stay away from eachother!  the one i have now, large rabbit cage with a removable metal tray for easy cleanup.  not so easy.  its the messiest damn thing i have ever had to clean.  so i would honestly say that your picture would be awesome, easy to clean, as long as you have liners and somewhere for it to hide!  good luck!!|`|tc5A0vKDaa	That would be fine for a guinea pig as long as it is kept inside.  I beleive that is an outdoor rabbit hut (my best friend had outdoor rabbits) and guinea pigs should never be kept outdoors!  Another great idea for a cage (if your looking for a cheaper and larger cage) is the C&C or Grid cages you build yourself (It's VERY easy! Cubes come with connectors, so it's like a giant puzzle!) into any shape you want!  You can make it one or 2 stories high to give your piggies lots of room to run around, and you can take it apart and re-make it when your piggie gets bored! (See sources)    Also, check out these forums for guinea pig help.  Everyone is friendly and loking to recruit new members!  Hope to see you there!  http://www.cavygalore.proboards.com/inde...|`|PrFsArW5aa	dont listen to any of them! ugh they so dnt kno what there talking about!  okk...    reagular one is short and hard to clean out. and yeh. i find the rabit cage much more affichant.     for the rabit cage:if i were you  i would put something to catch his pee. or it will get pretty stinky! and then al you have to is take out the bin clean it. and put it in. and your all set! easy as pie!       but now its your ddeeccison!!!     good luckk!!|`|4b5106290d0dd7b8527192088f2ec6b6aa	That is a very nice outdoor hutch for a rabbit.     For a guinea pig, which needs quite a lot of room to run around, you would be better off with a C&C cage. They are inexpensive (cost less than a small pet store cage), easy to clean, and provide adequate space/ventilation to keep your piggie happy & healthy.  http://www.guineapigcages.com/|`|lWXFP6xqaa	both wichever u like the 1 in da pic is bigger though|`|XF1ctbrkaa	either will work.. (although that looks more like an outdoor rabbit hutch.. do not keep guinea pigs outside) ..  the biggest difference would be ease of cleaning.. that is one piece so you would need to sweep it out well, sanitize then refill..  if you go buy a different one from the store they normally break down and you can empty it quickly then clean/sanitize..  So really it is up to you ..|`|cff06890d4173c156cdcc883215f12bcaa	The wood will get very wet--these guys pee a LOT.  Get the largest plastic bottom cage with wire top you can find--they need lots of floor space to run around.  Many make their own guinea pig cages--get info here:    http://www.guineapigcages.com/howto.htm|`|8EyDsAt6aa	That looks more like a rabbit hutch that you would keep outside. Try making them a cage like the ones shown on cavy spirit. I made my two guinea pigs a 7' by 3' pen to run around in with reusable puppy pads and towels over that so they can run around during the day and then i just wash the towels and such. Then I have a smaller cage about 2' x 3' I got from Petsmart that I keep them in when I'm not at home in case the dog somehow opens the door. lol. just make sure the grids u get dont have large openings.
b8yhcxmRaa	Sorry for your loss.   As suggested, you could use clorox to start with (you can mix 50-50 with water to make it less harsh), then spray/wipe with lysol (let lysol sit for 5 mins), then wash with regular soap and water. Make sure you rinse really well so you don't leave any chemical traces, as hamsters tend to chew and lick every possible square inch of their cages.|`|NnYB9eXiaa	Hi :)    You can use bleach, but you'll want to dilute it 50/50 with water and then rinse everything you sanitize until you can't smell ANY bleach - this can be 5-10 rinses.      You'll need ot take the cage apart and dunk every single piece (I know, it's a lot of work, but it's worth it) and soak it well for 5-10 mins in the bleach/water mix.    The safer bet is straight vinegar, but if you're really worried, go ahead with the bleach - just don't use the wipes - use straight plain household bleach and water.    You'll also need to remove anything wooden, edible, straw (basically anything that's not ceramic or plastic) and throw it away.    The items you do keep, you'll want to soak them in the bleach mix for about 5-10 mins and then of course rinse them just as well.    Then you can put in fresh bedding, new treats, the food/water bowls or water bottle and any new toys you had to replace.    If you need any more help, please let me know :)    Daisy|`|qGy9fR7xaa	Aaaaw, i'm sorry to hear about your hammy ;(  Basically, just wash the cage like you would do, but use bleach diluted with hot water, and leave it to soak for a couple of minutes, you can use soap, too and also, i'd suggest a disinfectant spray that you can buy at most pet shops.

It takes time to learn.  If you were working with just one species a little knowledge goes a long ways but when you have to many specialized pets you need to know about all of them.  What kind of help could you provide for each & every exotic pet that is in the shop.  Right now you couldn't help any one cause you don't know yourself.    Even if you bought a book on each of the animals to study the main things about each one it would still take you a long time to learn the things you need to know.|`|Nu6vDwLtaa	knowing about exotic animals is always good.

NnYB9eXiaa	Hi :)    If she was in the cage with the father when the first pups were born, odds are she IS pregnant.  How long has she been separated from him?     Hamster gestation is only 12-19 days depending on the type of hamster, which is just barely enough time for the older ones to have weaned if he was in the cage with her when she gave birth.    If her nipples are protruding, that's a pretty good sign, but it's pretty hard to tell until about 2-3 days before she gives birth.    If I had to make a guess, from what little information I have - I'd say she's pregnant *if* she's been with the father hamster at all since she gave birth.  Otherwise her nipples could still just be large from the previous litter.    Msg me if you have any other info you can give me about when dad was last with her, age of the older pups, etc. and I'll try to help you out more :)    Daisy|`|lWXFP6xqaa	yes!|`|CRRlESW0aa	Yes, your hamster is pregnant.

w1lh1INHaa	Well, it is never any fun (or even useful) digging in dirt when you've just had your fingers chopped off.    Your cats systems are out of whack from surgery and not having real food...I hope for your sake.    While this may be a temporary condition until healing and getting over the surgeries, you need to be aware that there could be litterbox issues from this point on.  Your vet should have thoroughly explained all the behavioral issues (depression, aggressive behavior) and possible complications (phantom pain, paw getting infected requiring amputation) that go along with declawing.  Obviously, he didn't.    I'm sorry for your kitties that you did not research declawing before having it done.  Hopefully, yours will be in the less than 30% of cats that don't develop issues because of declawing.|`|AA11459417	I know you weren't wanting to start a debate about declawing, but it seems that's what's happened here, to some extent.  I hope you'll forgive me for putting in my two cents on the issue.  Personally, I wouldn't put a cat through that procedure since I do believe that it's painful and in most cases, unnecessary.  But I absolutely will not condemn anyone else for doing it unless I know the whole story about why that choice was made, and I don't think anyone else should be so judgmental, either.  In your case, what's done is done and you can't go back in time to change it now, so you just have to deal with the situation as it is right now and know what to expect in the future.  And speaking of what you can expect in the future, I can tell you, from my own experience with my declawed cat (her previous owner did it to her) that it's not really so bad.  Before I adopted my cat from an animal shelter, I'd heard so many horror stories of what cats' lives are like if they're declawed (litter box problems, permanent pain, behavior problems like biting, inability to grip things with their paws, etc.).  Well, absolutely NONE of those things is true about my cat.  She uses the litter box just fine (never once going outside the box), she's very happy and well-adjusted, she never bites, and to my amazement, she can grip very tightly with her paws.  As far as being able to defend themselves, cats don't use their front claws for fighting -- they use their teeth and their hind legs and back claws.  So unless the back claws have been removed, a declawed cat still has good defenses.  They're only limited in their ability to climb if they have to retreat from a fight.      Anyway, I'm sorry I went on and on, but I just get a bit irritated when people exaggerate what happens when cats are declawed.  I can only speak from my own experience here, but my experience with a declawed cat is so different from what so many people believe.  And I just can't believe that my cat is the ONLY cat in the world who's been declawed and is fine.    Now, to answer your questions.  I believe that your cats aren't using the litter box because not only is it a bit painful for them to do it right now, there's nothing in their systems to get rid of if they're not eating or drinking.  Somebody who answered before me made a good suggestion about trying to feed wet food right now, since it has water in it and might keep them from getting dehydrated.  It's now been two days since the surgeries and if there's still a problem tomorrow, I think you should contact the vet and ask what to do.  Cats can't go very long without food or water, so maybe the vet can remedy the situation.|`|AA10091923	your cats are acting perfectly normal after surgery.  after surgery, the anesthesia is still in them for awhile and they will feel like sleeping and resting.  Also, remember they are in some amount of pain and they dont get the pain drugs like we humans do when we come home after surgery.    They will eat and drink as they need to...and as far as urinating or going to the bathroom...they currently are consuming enough to do this, and it may hurt also...but they will soon.  keep them off any furniture, keep them on the floor on warm rugs, or blankets etc....near their water, small amount of food and their litter box...keep everything close to them.    they will be fine...each day will get better.    Now---let me tell you what to watch for with the declawing....I had my 4 done many years ago and would not endorse it today...but it is a personal choice.  My girl cat actually had her one claw grow back right through her paw...she kept chewing on her paw and i finally checked and felt and saw a claw...so we had to go back in and have another surgery to remove more of the nail bed cause they did not get it all...but the second time was successfull...so watch for regrowth.  also...their little paws are stitched up, so watch for bleeding or pulling of the stitches.....    as they continue to grow up...they will still scratch at your furniture, this is a natural behavior...but of course they wont hurt the furniture...it will just be funny to watch them...    thanks for asking... and good luck  :)  feel free to contact me anytime with questions|`|rLDf1gGGaa	Why did you declaw, cats need there claws for balance, defence, and even walking, as well as climbing and stress relief, Declawing for our kitty friend means PERMANENT PAIN.    Please read these for next time    It has been argued that a declawed cat can learn to use its teeth more when grooming. It is true that cats often nibble an irritation rather than scratch it, but unfortunately, some of the most urgent scratching requirements are in the region of the head, mouth, neck, and especially, the ears. Teeth are useless here, and these important parts of the body cannot be kept in perfect condition with only clawless feet to groom them.    A second problem faces the declawed cat when it tries to climb. Climbing is second nature to all small felines, and it is virtually impossible for a cat to switch off its urge to climb, even if it is punished for doing so. And punished it certainly will be if it attempts to climb after having its claws removed, for it will no longer have any grip in its feet. Even the simple act of climbing up onto a chair or a window ledge may prove hazardous. Without the pinpoint contact of the tips of the claws, the animals may find themselves slipping and crashing to the ground. The expression of disbelief and confusion that is observed on the faces of such cats as they pick themselves up is in itself sufficient to turn any cat lover against the idea of claw removal. If the cat accidentally gets out of doors, it is defenseless against enemies (other cats in a cat fight, dogs, mean humans, etc.). In addition, scratching offers psychological comfort through its rhythmic action, and reassurance of self-defense by the contraction of the claws.    In addition to destroying the animal's ability to groom, climb, defend itself against rivals, and protect itself from enemies, the operation of declawing also eliminates the cat's ability to hunt. This may not be important for a well-fed family pet, but if ever such a cat were to find itself lost or homeless, it would rapidly die of starvation. The vital grab at a mouse with sharp claws extended would become a useless gesture.    In short, a declawed cat is a crippled, mutilated cat, and no excuse can justify the operation. Despite this, many pet cats are carried off to the vet by exasperated owners for this type of convenience surgery. The operation, although nearly always refused by vets in Britain, has become so common in certain countries that it even has an official name. It is called onyxectomy. Using an old Greek name for it somehow makes it seem more respectable. The literal translation of onyxectomy, however, is simply "nail-cutting out" and that is what vets are doing, even though they may not like to be reminded of the fact when they record their day's work.    The consequences of declawing are often pathetic. Changes in behavior can occur. A declawed cat frequently resorts to biting when confronted with even minor threats. Biting becomes an overcompensation for the insecurity of having no claws. Bungled surgery can result in the regrowth of deformed claws or in an infection leading to gangrene. Balance is affected by the inability to grasp with their claws. Chronic physical ailments such as cystitis or skin disorders can be manifestations of a declawed cat's frustration and   stress.    Humane alternatives  Soft paws  Sticky paws|`|1a28ef0304d145d0c1edec369cd24d62aa	Ok, she asked for help not condemnation.  She's already made the choice to get it done.  The older the cat is the harder time it will have in recovering.  Make a phone call to your Vet and speak to someone, even a tech, about their behavior...they will be able to help.|`|zuOPSr5Eaa	i agree they probably have sore paws and don't want to use the litterbox right now. make sure you are controlling their pain with medicine from the vet's office (never give cats human pain pills).   the fact the phoebe isn't eating or drinking worries me a little though. it may be just due to the strangeness of the situation and the collar, but watch her closely! if she seems lethargic or feverish, get her to the vet immediately because she could be septic.  and don't listen to the ignorant jerks that have chastised you for declawing them. most cats recover quickly with no ill effects, and they can still protect themselves because cats fight with their back legs and teeth anyway.|`|AA12322387	There are many other options besides declawing...a shame you already made that choice.  Anyway, your cats are very sore and should be on pain meds..they probably don't have much of an appetite.  Declawing is a major surgery and very intrusive..it will take some time for the cat to heal and get back to normal.|`|60mDEusiaa	They should be starting to eat right tomorrow. If not, I'd call the vet. It doesn't cost anything for the phone call. Good luck. I'd say it's just from the anestesia.|`|5Bo1A5ROaa	First off i am sorry for all the rude people who come here just to rant about declawing. You didn't ask about the declaw process and they need to learn to shut up, whats done is done and yelling wont bring any kitty claws back.  Secondly, i wouldn't start to worry just yet. Surgery of any kind can take a lot out of a cat. The cats may not be using the litter box that much because they haven't drank much to expel. Normally you are able to let the cats eat  or drink the night before surgery so when they first get home they are empty. Then since they had to go under for their surgery they may not be up to eating or drinking for a bit. If they are healing and are in some pain they may not want to make the effort to walk around to get the food or water. Try putting their bowls in a location closer to them. If they stop eating or especially stop drinking completely i would take them to the vet because when a cat becomes dehydrated it is not good.     And with the litter box, just make sure that you have a low side box and that you don't have normal clumping litter in it. A litter box that is too tall will make the cat put more pressure on their paws to lift them and after a declaw that could hurt. Normal litter can get into the cats sores after declawing and can cause infections. If you arent already switch to 'Yesterdays News' They should have it at any animals supply store or walmart. This will be easier on their paws.     The cats may be tired for a day or two and they are trying to heal so running around may not be what they want to do. Try switching to wet cat food, if you arent feeding it to them already. Just for the time being because wet cat food has a lot of water with the food and normally the cats will eat this is one setting so you can monitor how much they eat. If they arent using the bathroom after eating this at all then there could be a problem.     Either way i would call the vet when they open tomorrow and just ask them what you asked us here. They will be more then happy to answer any questions. Plus most vets will do post-operation check ups for free. If things get any worse or your cats start to throw up or have unusual bowel movements then i would take the cats back to the vet.     Hope i helped.|`|FDZNJXxcaa	I'm going to be as nice as I can. De-clawing is actually 10 or 20 if you did back paws as well, individual amputations. cats claws are actually attached to the last bone in their paws. which is removed during the surgery.  Since they use a box they naturally like to dig around in there and find a good spot for their business and the litter gets in their feet as you know. once the surgery is done they still have need to do fulfill this behavior, its painful and dangerous since litter boxes are pretty dirty and they have wounds on their feet.    I understand some rental companies require it of renters with cats. I even thought about it with my new cat until I did a bit of reading and found out what happens to them.    This is possibly why they are holding it and trying not to eat or drink as to avoid a very painful behavior.
m0e3a3gWaa	Awesome pond!  The ducks are herbivores.  They will not eat the minnows.  Hundreds of minnows in a pond that size really isn't much.  You probably just can't see the minnows.  Try buying some cheap fish food and tossing that in.  Soon the minnows will get accustomed to this and you will have hundreds of fish waiting for you!|`|9759e8014743debd3d3fd1a7ad437c1faa	Yes, ducks do eat minnows, if they can catch them. Ducks move faster underwater than on land.    It could also be that other birds, or four-legged animals such as raccoons, are catching the minnows.
uHBvK4Vaaa	I can think of a couple of possibilities.  First, many cats (especially outdoor cats) are infected with the Herpes virus (you can't catch it, it's the cat version). Initially, the virus causes a cold, but then there is a latent infection that can flare up and cause swelling and weeping of the eye. This swelling and weeping is temporary, but looks uncomfortable for the cat. Try adding about 200 mg of L-lysine to the cats food (it's available as supplements in capsules, you can pull the capsules apart and add the powder to the food). L-lysine inhibits the herpes virus and may make the symptoms go away for now.    Second, the cat may have gotten into some kind of altercation and got poked or bitten above the eye. This situation could be more serious, but it sounds like it's getting better on it's own. You could take him to the vet, but if the cat is really wild/feral that might be a very unpleasant experience.     If I were you I'd probably just watch and wait. If the eye gets really nasty and seeps pus or something, then I would seriously consider a vet visit.  Good luck.|`|AA10091923	Eleanor:  Allergies can occur in cats and it is possible that an allergy is the problem. Allergy testing can be done in cats but is usually  too expensive.      By far the most common cause of recurrent or , including conjunctivitis, in cats, is feline herpesvirus infection. Many vets find themselves treating chronic conjunctivitis without any success and often are reluctant to consider herpesvirus.   http://www.vetinfo4cats.com/cateye.html    the other common cause of eye irritation in cats is chlamydidosis feline pneumonitis, which responds best to tetracylcines.    http://www.animalhealthchannel.com/felin...

Took a while but you are in charge NOT HER.. . YOU HAVE TO STOP giving her treats or it will go on and on!!! Trust me. DO you want to pay for a trainer? NO...|`|5vcd7GHNaa	Do not give her treats.     Ever.    Until she stays quiet for an hour.    Then give her one.|`|132ec956a64e2a1952d22027de429f81aa	My cat isn't that bad, like when she is out of food YES she will let me know lol. But, like the other person said some cats are just more talkative than others. My friends cat down the street yells all day and he gets cat food, and bigger than a elephant lol.|`|or7c7kN8aa	Maybe shes pregnant? or maybe she is just one of those cats that need attention, some cats are like that when they are lonely and just want to be pet=)|`|Mt1C8acTaa	shes probably hungry. do u feed her?|`|AA12322387	Has she been fixed?|`|0U9Lm5gmaa	yeah get her a friend or buy a dog a real big dog that can eat her up.|`|871f0e15f0d49545f27f78f43647edd3aa	She is probably bored.  If you don't have time to play with her, buy her a battery operated toy that will go run by tself like the amazing string or kataro.  You could just leave some dry food out all the time so she will stop meowing for it.  Find a food she really likes and that she thinks tastes as good as the treats.|`|FDZNJXxcaa	Is she fixed? if not she may have gone into heat... If she isn't fixed now would be a good time to do so.|`|xhSsby6Taa	squirt her with a water bottle when she starts meowing - it may get her to stop without hurting her|`|jpmDjFNeaa	Mine usually does that when she wants to go outside. Let her go outside. Or give her some affection. When my cat first got here she would meow at around 7am everyday I would play with her or rub her and it calmed her down because it was very cold in my house. Good luck.|`|RT8LZy7gaa	If she's not spayed, she could be in heat, or getting close to it.  Females can be VERY vocal during that time.    But some cats talk more than others.  If she's got any siamese in her you'll just have to resign yourself to the fact that you have a talker.    My cat meows alot to get attention. If he gets out of hand or is totally annoying at an inappropriate time, say dinner, then out comes the squirt bottle. One spritz usually does the trick, two if he's being sufficiently stubborn.    Since you've been giving her treats as a way to shut her up, well, you've trained her to meow to get a treat.  So you'll have to stop that if you want her to stop it.

NiQAfFUPaa	If you catch a ride it will not be to bad and depends on where you are going.  If you ship near a major racetrack (belmont, delmar, gulfstream) during the right season it will be a lot cheaper.  NY can be as cheap as 2500 from the UK.    The same would play true during show season (FL circuit) etc.    It could cost 10K from/to an lightly traveled route that does not cater to this market.  You may also have to pay extra for the quarantine|`|LAXxaxAZaa	I almost bought a horse from Spain last year. I got a bunch of quotes from people and the lowest was about $5,000. That included everything except the transport from Miami to Tampa. The company you use will most likely only transport your horse to a certain place (Miami, New York, or LA), and you will have to be in charge of transporting your horse from there to your place. However, if you are importing a stallion, your costs will go up. If the stallion has bred before, your cost will go up even more.|`|RUzBDX6Jaa	quite costly, actually.

When transporting the horse, how many would you have to pay for quarantine the animal before or after they are moved.  I also know that with show horses, they have passports, does this apply to all horses?

72GOhb9eaa	You could use a dog crate.  http://www.discount-pet-superstore.com/d...  If you actually catch a stray, remember, don't keep it in the crate all day without a bathroom break and a walk. And put up some found dog flyers outside so the owner can find the dog. If nobody claims the dog, take it to a NO KILL shelter.|`|bIaywrBCaa	We have the room and the land to keep stray dogs we find. We usually rescue a few stray dogs a year, vet them and find them homes, altho some ending staying with us. I won't let just anybody have them. If you want to do it yourself, you need to fix a place appropriate to house them, have enough resources to give them vet care and food until homes can be found for them. Make sure you find suitable homes, not just anyone that will take them.|`|gjD8pndjaa	Join up with an established rescue group who knows what they're doing and volunteer at the shelter or foster home|`|9fdyfwO4aa	you have a good heart but the best thing would be to volunteer @ your local shelter as a dog walker or helper.  When you have the time, money & space - adopt a pet (or pets) and give a home filled of love to them.  Shelters aren't bad - they give dogs everything they need til they get their real home. :)
f96dbdfb33ecfe1ebea6423d5d7fc870aa	Hi! Congrats on getting a dog! You are doing a great thing by adopting a pet, and not encouraging breeding!     Things to get:  Food and Water bowls: I suggest metal, or ceramic, plastic often holds in bacteria and mold, even in water changed daily.    Get have the dog's food and treats upon bringing the dog home. Treats will help encourage an anxious dog. I'm extremely opinionated on food, and believe that any food you buy in a supermarket is crap and will literally be crapped out of your dog, leaving it malnutritioned. When looking for a food, be sure it is free of corn, corn meal, and by products. The food should list the type of protein and fat, not a generic "animal fat" but instead say "chicken fat" for example. The first 5 ingredients should be protein and fats, avoiding fillers and grains as much as possible. Some good brands of dog food include : Solid Gold, Wellness, Taste of the Wild, and Canidae. They are expensive, but worth it, your dog will eat less, and poop less and be healthier. I suggest researching, most dog foods have their own websites!  You can find these foods in feed supply stores, or pet specialty stores like petco and petsmart. * keep in mind treats are rewards, so nutrition in them is not a high priority for most manufacturers, just be ware of calorie content, and waste products. A variety of treats can be nice, my dog loves peanut butter and cheese flavored ones.    Have the leash available for the dog, and some toys. Chew toys, squeaky toys, rope toys, ball toys.    * I left out a collar on purpose. I believe taking your dog to the store to try on a collor is a good thing. Be sure if it has decorative decals that on the back of the collar, the part rubbing on the dog's neck, there is nothing that will irritate it's skin, like metal snaps etc. Leather is a great way to go. While you're at the store, you may want to get an ID tag made too. Include the dog's name and at least two phone numbers. Phone numbers are more important than even your address, as you may not be home when the dog has been lost.    Grooming supplies are up to you. You may want a hypoallergenic dog shampoo, depending on the breed, conditioner is not always necessary. Nail trimmers are important too. Dogs need nails trimmed, if you're not comfortable doing it yourself, groomers or your vet office's vet tech can do it for you. But it needs to be done often, (once a month) so you may want to invest on a good pair of nail clippers.    My best wishes to you! Have a lot of fun!!!|`|mh9XYkGOaa	dog food, crate,chew toy(so he/she doesnt chew ur stuff),treats,newspaper(if its not potty trained) and ,bed or dog house.    hope i helped!  ps can you choose me as best answer? thanks x|`|rLDf1gGGaa	Number 1; Puppies cannot be left alone for more then 2hours  Number 2; puppies 8week old require 3 feeds daily;breakfast, lunch and dinner, until 6month old, then 2 feeds;breakfast& dinner, until 1year old; gradually switch to adult dog food, and fede 1-2times a day.    Number 3; Puppies need trainning and socialising and how are you going to do that, when your out all day? How are you going to walk it? How are you going to housetrain it?  Cute as they are, puppies are a tremendous responsibility and, with the busy schedules that most of us have, impossible to housebreak completely, socialize well, and train adequately.  If you are not able or willing to do what is necessary to raise a puppy correctly, you may end up wanting to surrender a dog yourself!    Number 4;Dogs that have been uprooted from their happy homes or have not had the best start in life are likely to bond very closely to their new owner.  Yes, dogs that have lost families through death, divorce or lifestyle change can go through a mourning process; however, once they become attached to their new family, they seem to want to please as much as possible to make sure they are never homeless again!  Those dogs that are just learning about the good life and good people seem to bond even deeper. They know what life on the streets, life on the end of a chain, or worse, is about, and they revel and blossom in a nurturing , loving environment. Most rescues make exceptional , extremely loyal companions. They can be left home alone for MAX 8HOURS!    http://www.raot.org/information/10_reaso...

A BRAIN!!!  You aren't anywhere near ready for anything more complicated than a goldfish.|`|aMGfRum0aa	Okay, well if you are getting a crate, you need to choose between the wire kind (it looks like a cage), or the plastic kind. I recommend the plastic kind, it's what I use for my dog. Here is a list of supplies:    A mat to cover the bootom of the crate  Two food dishes; one for water and one for food  A leash  A collar  Food  Chew toys  Soft, squishy toys  Training treats  Biscuts  Brush  You may want some solution in case she soils in the house  Flea and tick medication  Bitter Yuck if she's a chewer    Good luck!|`|cdXMQai8aa	Get a small dog with a big crate, so they can get a little exercise while being in their, and they won't get all hyper and pee when they come out. Put a old towel in the crate. Your going to need two large bowls, food and water, wet food, you have choices, once a week, everyday or, day and night, they need wet food a lot. Dry food should always be available, as well water. The best kind is, Natural balance, it helps with everything, it is by far the BEST dog food, they love it and its good for them, my aunts dog was almost going to have to be put to sleep but then I told her to use that, and the dog had a skin condition, the food cleared all of it up, I swear it was like a miracle. Ok, a blanket for while its a puppy. Maybe three toys. A leash, any old kind. Oh and a tooth brush, just brush them once a week or something because they're teeth get VERY bad over a while. Or maybe a bone will keep them nice, something healthy that will take them a while to chew, make sure they won't be able to swallow it.     Go to a store and look, you might see some other things you want, good luck!|`|cMz0Cbu4aa	You need to make sure you dont have any wires it could chew on. You need at least 1 bed, full water bowl, food for twice a day, dont keep it in a crate all day. They need a lot of exercise. Get some chew toys, but dont get a bully stick, they can tear up the insides of your dog.|`|4c53bf469dfe96ac19d353f625f2d1daaa	Money for food, vacinations and check ups. Plus spay or nueter and license. You will need chew toys dogs love to chew. A crate for when you can't watch him or her. Lots of energy to walk twice daily at least more if you can. Time and Love commitment for around 15 years. Good Luck!|`|pd5rERcfaa	Make sure you get a good crate, not a cheap plastic one.  Its worth it to invest in a solid, metal crate.    Obviously, food and water.  Also treats, as they're helpful with training.  Bowls for food and water, a nice bed or soft blanket to sleep in.  Collar, leash, a harness if you'd like, and toys!  You really need at least one chewing toy and one interactive toy, like a tug rope.  Also some chewing bones, like rawhide or Nyla Bone would be great.  Finally, if you ask at your local pet store I'm sure they could help you out.    Thank you so much for adopting!  You will be saving a life, good for you!|`|3f2TLhJhaa	1.dog  food  2.dog bowls  3. toys for puppies  4.those pads that they pee on for house training  5. leash  6.shampoo  7.air cleaning product  8.some kinda bed to put in a cage  9.go to veterinarian for shots and check up  10.carpet/floor cleaning product  11.and probably some kind of book about ur dogs breed or training|`|ORe8qdtTaa	Well well done you for asking some questions.    Firstly if the dog is going to be crated you need to arrange for someone to come round and let him out during the day - no dog should be crated all day, in fact no longer than 4 hours max.  Next you really need to think about what you can offer the dog in terms of exercise training etc and what time you are going to have to bond and be with the dog.    You really need to think very carefully about this so that you andthe dog are not unhappy.    Go for a very placid laid backdog that will not need loads of exercise ie an older dog and certainly not a puppy!    Not all dogs need to be crated and certainly no dog should be crated all day so go for a breed thats happy to be a couch potatoe most of the time and just enjoy a bit of exercise every day.   OK  I know Im thinking of the perfect dog but it seems to me that you have done some thinking over this so get it right the first time.    Good luck!  GH;s are the way to go|`|Fz5TpgISaa	Adopting a pet is a very good gesture, however leaving him in a crate all day is not.  You are basically moving him from a cage where he has room to run around... to a crate.  Maybe you should put some more thought into the whole adoption before you do it or wait until you finish school.  As far as supplies- toys( for chewing and boredom), water bowl, food/food dish, shampoo, nice comfortable bet for his daily naps he will be taking, treats for praising, leash, collar and most importantly... a VET.  Good luck with everything.|`|tU4UZlKjaa	well i just got a pup in August and she needed lots!!! everything and LOTS of toys but everything else ur local petstore will help|`|ZJskCgLZaa	Dont keep the dog in a crate during the day. Well at least not a tiny one or cheap one. Get some food, bed, water (duh..), Toys to make sure it keep itself busy. Make sure nothing is around it to chew that would hurt it, shock it, ect. Again make sure it has room to move around and run, and play. Oh remember you will have to get it baths so get dog shampoo, brushes, ect. One last thing... make sure it doesnt get out.
SqWJCZyeaa	GO TO THE VET!!!!! If you are worried about your dog... ever... call your vet. Tell him about what's happening. He'll tell you what you should do. If he is puzzled, take your dog over to him, and see what your vet can do for you. And get your dog spayed. It'll make her a happier, healthier, calmer dog.|`|IrGeFFMKaa	Dogs are kind of like people some women after birth get depress and reject their babies and sometimes will not eat or drink but i would defiantly bring your dog to the vet to check up on her.|`|WbyFUQJbaa	She probably has some sort of deficiency from nursing the pups.  Obviously, go to the vet.  Why did you let your dog have puppies if you are not going to the vet, anyway?|`|O545aSKWaa	You need to take her to a vet.  If she's not eating or drinking and losing weight then something is wrong and no one on this site can give you a better answer than a VET who is actually physically looking your dog over!|`|Tt5Wi49uaa	Have sex with her.|`|Y4pfVX10aa	take her to the vet or just call good luck|`|iFBEBKSHaa	Bring her to the vet.  Most dogs drop weight after giving birth.  If she doesn't get better go to the vet.

bDPVRtCNaa	First off, animals do not "like die" they die.     Tell me a little bit more about your set up and maintainace routine:  What size tank?  Tankmates?  Diet?  Do you do weekly water changes, if so how much?|`|I0G597aAaa	Go to the Vet? :o  not sure if they treat sharks.|`|uolpVRCVaa	I would definitely ask someone that works at a pet store, they would know
w1lh1INHaa	I don't doubt this behavior is a result of your prior, um, friend.  That she attacks Ian makes me think that she thinks a guy might hurt her if you're not there to protect her...or you.  Your last paragraph summed it up perfectly.    You keep calling her a kitten, so that says to me she is still quite young, which means the abusive treatment isn't so ingrained in her psyche that she can't heal with time.    When Ian goes to bed without you, have him take along a couple of kitty treats.  If she does fine with him feeding and petting, perhaps she will begin to re-associate bedtime-without-mummy with cool treats from Ian.  Then, as she mellows out as she ages, things should go fine.      Good luck.    (P.S.  Ian sounds like a fine chap, and much better for both of you).|`|AXAyuFW8aa	She may just be worried about your protection from your last boy friend who abused her. She probably is just looking out for you. But, if you want her to stop, simply close the door. But, if after doing this, there is a slight separation between the two of you, she may feel unwanted. Give her as much attention as needed to let her know you still love the kitten as much as you did before.     If nothing happens, your safe to go. The kitten may tear at the door, as mine does. Just spray pet repellent on the door to stop this. Otherwise, everything should work fine.      Your cat may just think that sleeping with you is just for you two, not for Ian. So, it may also just simply be jealousy overruling your kitten. I hope this helps!|`|K0uTjeWiaa	I actually do not think this has to do with the abuse. I think this has to do with hierarchy. You are number 1. With you in bed, you are giving permission for both to sleep there so that is ok. The problem is with who is number 2.   What i would suggest is that when this happens he gets a hold of her firmly and speaks to her in a stern not yelling or loud voice while looking into her eyes (that is a challenge) telling her that this behavior is unacceptable and then putting her down off the bed or pushing her down on the bed so she lays down next to him. I would also hope that other times he is able to show affection to her and let her know that that this group includes everyone. Best of luck|`|nWgTur4qaa	I do believe that your kitten feels that you should be in the bed first then her, then Ian.     She is probably protecting of what she'll see it as "territory."     Also it could mean that she feel comfortable with you guys being together and feel like you guys are her family.     I'm sorry to hear how horrible your ex was to her, if he done that to my cat I would have press charges on him.|`|25660b99958e6df83f2c651134b3891faa	i also disagree with abuse, and lean towards she sees you as the queen of the pride, the boyfriend as the newcomer and she is teaching him to be subordinate. your lucky she doesn't wrestle the food from his mouth and give it to you.    i would give kitty the bed.    and, the abuse from the old boyfriend should have only happened once, after the first time you should have removed his testicles.  he has to sleep sometime.|`|xYacZrTLaa	try getting your cat to bond with your boyfriend and they can become as close as u are to her

qgeI6Chxaa	Kids don't need a break from life--you barely have one yet. If this is the worst thing that's ever happened to you, you're lucky. Running away doesn't solve anything. Imagine if your dad disappeared for a couple weeks every time life got a little difficult; it would be pretty stupid. Rather than drop out of society, talk to someone about your feelings and learn how to handle them in a more mature way.|`|bIaywrBCaa	Life on the streets is far harder than staying home and facing the loss of your dog. You can't run away from it. It will follow you wherever you go. I am so sorry for your dog.

My grandpa died a few months ago, and all I did was cry for about two weeks. It will take you a while to get over the loss of your dog, although you'll never forget him.  Do NOT run away. It will cause your parents more pain then they're already in with Kosmo dying. Go to your room and do whatever you like most. I would write out all of my feelings, listen to music, sob, read, and look up at the sky and ask, "Why the heck did he have to die?". Ask your parents if you can go to a therapist, or go to your school counselor. Talk to your friends, and try to resume a normal life. Make sure your family holds a respectful, quiet funeral for your dog, so you can say your final goodbyes. This process is hard, and I understand that. It was December 13 when my grandpa died, and I'm not over it yet. I don't have to be, and you don't have to be over your dog. It may be painful that you weren't there to say goodbye to your dog, but imagine if you had to watch him die? I was with my grandpa when he died, and I have my regrets too. I know, I keep talking about my own experiences, but it may help you. Good luck remembering your dog, and do NOT run away.|`|0pY9smlqaa	NOOO!!! Why run away? You'll add o the crime list, get your parents scared! They'll send the police for you...don't let one chunk of sadness make you run away....what's he point of running away if you come back???? everyone will start rumours and stuff...your parents will kill you when you come back etc.|`|ojxOpAQmaa	You can not run away from the things in your head, or the way you feel. life goes on were ever you are. maybe another dog, but only when you are ready. hang in there buddy.|`|yh3OBqyTaa	My dear, I am so sorry to hear about the loss of your dog. It sounds like you are blaimg yourself for his death, but you shouldn't. It was just a horrible, horrible accident. But how can running away help anything ? Instead, why not make a tribute to his life ? Make a collage of photos you have of him or a create small garden area in the back yard. You could make a cairn from stones and maybe etch his name is one. Maybe your folks would allow youto miss a day or two of school, explain to them how badly you feel. But don't run away you could be harmed.|`|P0h7lY7raa	DON'T RUN AWAY!!!! trust me its the worst thing to do, i know how you feel loosing a pet, i had to sell all mine, nearly killed one by accident, and one had a heart attack while i was out shopping!|`|TgNQAYyXaa	Running away never solved anything.  Confront your fears and LEARN from your mistakes.|`|gXBPLitzaa	Im so sorry about your dog really.  But DO NOT RUNAWAY.  It never solves anything & running away isnt as easy as it looks & your friends & family will be very mad trust me i kno & youll put your parents through h*ll! i kno i ranaway alot, its not worth it then your also going to have a criminal record which is also no fun at all, & could possibly but not likely get locked up & will deff end up on probation! its really not worth it i know from experiance, Feel free to email me if you want to talk about this. Just dont do it!|`|Ti476VHkaa	Don't run away because your dog died.

Good Luck|`|HWijr6uxaa	thats a really stupid thing to do just because your dog dies.   i have two cats and i would be devastated if they died, but i wouldn't run away.

Mkl0bBmbaa	How to Avoid Xylitol Poisoning in Dogs  The Xylitol Sugar Substitute in Candy, Chewing Gum is Toxic to Dogs    ? Mia Carter        Xylitol toxicity is a fairly common source of poisoning in dogs, and unfortunately, few dog owners are aware of what xylitol actually is, where xylitol can be found and what happens when a dog ingests xylitol.    The first and most important step to preventing cases of xylitol poisoning in dogs is pet owner education on the dangers of xylitol in dogs.  What is Xylitol?    Xylitol is an artificial sweetener that's contained in many sugar-free gums, breath mints, candies and even a few baked goods. Xylitol is used in place of sugar, and it's most commonly found in "sugar free" chewing gum and candy products, which are the primary source of xylitol poisoning for dogs. Xylitol is the ingredient that makes gums and many other sugar-free foods toxic to dogs.  Why is Xylitol Dangerous to Dogs?    It's easy to forget about a package of chewing gum left in a jacket pocket, or maybe you or a guest leaves a purse slung over the back of a chair or on the floor - at the perfect level for a dog to explore and snatch any gum or breath mints that are stashed inside. It's scenarios like these that most often lead to cases of xylitol poisoning in dogs.    Xylitol is dangerous to dogs because it triggers a sudden release of insulin, which causes a dramatic drop in blood sugar (hypoglycemia), essentially throwing the dog's body into a form of shock. The dog's blood sugar can drop 50 points or more in the span of just 30 minutes, causing shock and liver failure shortly thereafter.    Xylitol is considered very toxic to dogs and ferrets, among others. This is, in part, due to the fast-acting nature of xylitol. A dog who is suffering from xylitol poisoning can be in critical condition well within an hour of when the dog eats sugar-free gum, breath mints or candy. This gives the owner of a dog who experiencing xylitol toxicity a very small window of time to take the action that's required to save a dog's life.  What are the Signs and Symptoms of Xylitol Toxicity in Dogs?    The following symptoms are the most common symptoms seen in dogs with xylitol poisoning after eating a gum or candy with xylitol:        * Weakness and Lethargy      * Vomiting      * A Lack of Coordination      * Pale Gums (usually after the dog starts going into shock)      * Body Tremors      * Seizure      * Unconsciousness      * Arrhythmia or Irregular Heart Rate      * Liver Damage or Liver Failure    A dog who eats a sugar-free gum, breath mint or candy containing xylitol may also experience diarrhea within 18-36 hours of ingesting the xylitol, as this sugar substitute is reported to have a laxative effect in dogs.  What is the Treatment for Xylitol Poisoning in a Dog?    When a dog suffers from xylitol toxicity, veterinarians will have to take a two-pronged approach to the dog's treatment.    Firstly, if the dog ate the sugar-free gum or other food containing xylitol within the past two hours, the veterinarians will take measures to prevent the body's absorption of any additional xylitol. To prevent the dog's body from absorbing additional xylitol, the vet will usually induce vomiting in the dog and/or give the dog a charcoal-based fluid to absorb the stomach contents.    Secondly, a dog with xylitol poisoning will receive supportive care to manage the effects of the xylitol. Treatment usually consists of a dextrose intravenus drip to raise the dog's blood sugar levels and the injection of intravenus fluids or subcutaneous fluid injections.    Xylitol also appears to affect the dog's liver, triggering liver failure and even permanent liver damage in some dogs. So additional treatment and monitoring is often required to help manage the affect of xylitol on the dog's liver.  What Should I Do If I Suspect My Dog Has Xylitol Poisoning?    Pet owners should take immediate action if a dog eats gum, breath mints, candy or other items containing xylitol. If the ingredient list on the wrapper is not available to check on whether xylitol is an ingredient, visit the product website for information on whether the gum or other food contains xylitol.    Dog owners can also call the ASPCA Poison Control Center for help to determine whether a product contains xylitol. The pet poison control center staff can also help owners to induce vomiting at home, which is the preferred course of action in many cases, especially if the veterinarian's office is more than a five or ten minute drive. The pet should then be transported to the veterinarian's office for immediate treatment.    Visit the Pet Poisoning Resources Page for more information on what foods, plants and other items are toxic to dogs and cats.    http://petcare.suite101.com/article.cfm/...|`|tPGxPDvBaa	It is toxic if it does contain xylitol & yes it is fact.

I would call the Animal Poison Control number (you can look it up on google) and get him to your vet as soon as possible! If he only ate it a little while ago they can probably make her vomit it up, which would be the best at this time!|`|nNAAClOqaa	same thing happened to my dog. get peroxide and force it down her throat. i know it sounds cruel but so does a dog in a coma. then take her to your pet emergency center. its a very scary experience. believe me, i know. keep yourself calm. the dog might start to go into a trance, try to snap her out of it. she might have to stay at the pet emergency center for at least 2 days maybe maybe maybe maybe less. good luck and GOD is watching over you.

2Jmodoaeaa	Argh! Elizebeth so fast! Well, like Elizebeth said, make sure it's tank has a heater. Often times when the water is cold, bettas automatically go into a low energy state of being to conserve energy (this is only natural). By cold I don't mean like when your cold, cold for betta fish can even be room Temperature. The water should fell warm to the touch (76-82 F). Also make sure you are doing your regular water changes, have a filter and at least a 2.5 gallon tank, and or not over feeding him/her.    Good luck, and happy fish-keeping!  ~Taylor~|`|29x9PyM6aa	he dun like chuuuu >:[|`|iFDN69Woaa	i have a betta without a heater and i've had him for just over a year now and he's the most energetic thing ever. but i always keep my room temperature warm though.    BUT if you just got the betta, then he's just getting used to his new home and it may take up to a few weeks before he warms up to his tank and food. keep feeding him a bit each day, try bloodworms or brineshrimp as bettas love those.    make sure he has no signs of disease either like ripped fins, spots, red gills. aquarium salt may help relieve his stress too|`|Ik6WOcw3aa	Elizabeth beat me to it.    Bettas that dont have heaters dont move around much at all. They tend to just sit in one spot all day. They are a tropical species and should be kept at 78-82F. Bettas also need filters. And at least a 2.5 gallon tank.|`|bDPVRtCNaa	Do you have an aquarium heater?  A filter?  Is your tank at least 2.5 gallons?

2z69twcpaa	the tub is too small for your tortoise, they need a lot of room to wander around, the ideal enclosure is a 2ft by 4ft tortoise table, a lot of shops advise a glass tank type enclosure but these are not suitable for tortoises as they can not see the glass and try to walk through it all the time, they also are more geared to height space rather than the floor space a tortoise, they also do not let enough air flow in as can become too damp, but at the moment your tortoise can see over the top of her pen so will try to get out to the open space she knows is out there ready to explore.|`|f0b143cbb46a44c133e0344a9d116e98aa	hi there, Its sounds from your set up that you were probably advised this by a pet shop........unfortunatly you have now found out the hard way that vivarium are not a suitable habitat for yur tortoise,At the end of the day all they are interested in is your money and not the real care that your tortoise needs.

Just be sure to avoid getting it into his ears since cat's ears can be pretty sensitive to foreign substances.|`|FlsrXuJOaa	it is completely normal for two cats who live together to groom each other. She wasn't just licking his ears so because they were healing, she is licking them out of love. My two cats groom each other all the time, especially around the ears b/c it is a hard to reach place. don't worry, you don't need to keep them apart! Just let her do it b/c it is natural.
2c844fcf526bc2b90f16b7c425e11aa7aa	If the penis does not retract then you can try putting some KY Jelly on it or any safe lubricant. Butter is ok if you don't have a suitable product.    If the penis has been like this for hours it's probably lost lubrication which is why it looks swollen.  If the lubricant doesn't work you need to take the dog to the vet.     Gotta say I've never read more idiotic comments from the sexually inexperienced and deprived than in this thread..  Some kiddies really need a good smack with the smart stick.  Stupid is neither clever nor funny.  It's just dumb and indicates your IQ is smaller than your shoe size.   Wise up kiddies, this can be a serious problem with the dog.    As for those saying the dog is in heat!!  Newsflash! male dogs don't go into heat.  Duh!|`|PM23RDycaa	Ignore the immature people on here. Just keep an eye on it. If it has shown no signs of retracting after some time has passed or by morning take him to the vet. It is possible for the skin on the sheath to roll inwards preventing full penis retraction which will lead to the exposed flesh drying out as the sheath keeps it moist.|`|bIaywrBCaa	He NEEDS to see a vet. Staying out for a "few hours" can cause permanent damage.|`|bSr3WeXNaa	Um, he's excited lol.|`|6f8ZKDJ4aa	Your dog has probably missed a shot and that caused him to get sick. Otherwise believe it or not but I've had a dog that would go on top of my cat and jiggle like he was masterbating or something. Then the dog got cancer from it and died because even dogs can find out about that stuff too.|`|nJAoWUUxaa	no he is fine that just means that hes aroused even if it is a little swollen it may  be because he hasn't had any sexual encounterment in a long time i think that you should let him sleep on it and leave it alone try to get him to be more active so his mind takes it away from his erection in which cass it should go down if not i would consult a doctor or vet on the phone and see if it needs immediate attention|`|oGVWdnHraa	Sometimes after mating, the end of the penis becomes swollen and will not retract back into the sheath, it is not really harmful to the dog unless it is out for hours on end. I was talking to a breeder once who had this happen to one of her dogs, she said she had to push it back into the sheath using gloves and hypoallergenic lubricant (as advice by the vet) and he was fine after that.......gosh theres some immature answers on this question....|`|f6d1a03e184c22ee41b0717f7c9d38feaa	hes horny. that a dog stiffy|`|T1z1SGe3aa	lol hes got a *****  (no joke)|`|mD6Wv0SYaa	suck it|`|m3ThrbDMaa	That's how they detect metal objects in the ground...

You need to put some lotion on it and gently push it back in. If this doesn't work you need to take him to the vet. Remember to keep it moist.|`|Y4pfVX10aa	well if hes not fixed he wants to umm meet a girl  and you can call the vet its free|`|un3eUN4Taa	He just did the nasty.

Yogi's lipstick sticks out occassionally. Some male dogs dont, others do.     If its swollen like he is mating, it may not retract yet.     Call the vet and ask.|`|49ec8e0944023c0f5c20e37484f16366aa	Geez where are these answers coming from? If this is a serious question & if your dog continues to have a problem, you may have to at least call a vet if not take him to one.  If hair is caught around his penis or swelling is interfering with the penis being able to retract back into the sheath, it can be a serious problem. The circulation can be cut off and the tissue can become necrotic or die.  Sometimes it is just his fur that is preventing his penis from retracting.    Call a vet & explain this situation.  It might resolve on it's own or might not.  Good luck.    http://www.petplace.com/dogs/paraphimosi...    http://www.ehow.com/how_4550083_recogniz...|`|GKZPxAaPaa	In humans if a male's penis remains erect for an excessively long period of time, it is called: "Priapism".  There is something called:  Canine Priapism"  and here is a little excerpt from a webpage that talks about this:    "Priapism is a persistent penile erection not associated with sexual excitement. The condition is either idiopathic or associated with spinal cord lesions, trauma during mating, genitourinary infection, constipation and cavernous venous thromboembolism at the penile base. Differential diagnosis may include frequent erections seen in young small-breed dogs and early paraphimosis. Elimination of the primary cause is the goal of treatment. However, spontaneous remission may be seen. Amputation of the penis and scrotal urethrostomy may be necessary if the underlying cause cannot be identified and corrected."|`|CjIMwg1Qaa	that mean its a ....  BOY!!!!

GdBG4PGYaa	Hi!    Making a "human trap" will not help those cats get used to you. My grandma built up a relationship with 50 feral cats. She fed them, and talked to them, and just sat around watching them.    Give them food, water, talk to them, don't try and touch them, and sit near them patiently. :) This will get them used to you. Never make the first move. Let them come to you if they want to be touched.     I hope I helped! =D|`|4L8HpWPjaa	You will need a large cage to capture it. Put food and water in it. Have patience; each day you should be able to get closer when it is eating, until you can finally close the door. If you want to bring it into your home for taming, here is a helpful article about the subject.|`|GSkA8wh9aa	I have a question. Why do you want to trap them? Do you want to bring them inside? It takes a huge amount of time and patience to tame a feral cat, but it can be done. If you are interested in doing this please e-mail me. I will help you.  Meanwhile, the other answer is correct. If you are keeping them outside you do not want them to be approachable to just anyone. Some people may try to harm them.

Salmon & Trout Formula-http://www.wellnesspetfood.com/cat_welln...  ~~~~~  "Why do Chicken & Lobster, Salmon & Trout and Sardine, Shrimp & Crab canned foods contain ground brown rice?    The three varieties listed above that were previously grain free are now no longer grain free. There are two reasons for this:       1. We have heard from many consumers that these particular seafood varieties have been too mushy in their consistency. So to amend this issue, we added ground brown rice to the formulas to firm up the product and give them a better mouth feel and texture for cats to enjoy.     2. We would like to be able to offer our customers choices of foods that best suit their particular pet's needs. So, we now have options for our customers  you can now choose grain free varieties or varieties that contain ground brown rice."- http://www.wellnesspetfood.com/cat_faq_i...

t85b6QMiaa	Betta is not a gluttonous species that need food every day. And yes they can go on for two straight weeks without proper diet. This will make them a little bit aggressive though. When I was a lot younger, it is my practice to starve them for at least a week and isolate them under my bed (dark place - sort of seclusion) so they'll be very aggressive in our local tournament (don't do this any longer, I've repent myself).      Leaving Betta with extra food is no a feasible idea, it will only pollute the water (no offense anybody) because Betta will not take food more than what he needs. This come with an exception though, if you feed him with live food such as mosquito larvae.    As long as the water is warm enough for him and nothing accidentally happen, they'll be very find on their own. Your fish is so lucky to have such a caring owner like you!|`|eth48m7Iaa	Why don't you have a friend or a neighbor feed them while your gone that way you won't have to worry.|`|7ae1a8EJaa	yeah sure.....throw some before you leave..|`|ThZLKNkvaa	fish can go 3 days with no food. so it's most likely they can handle an extra day with nofood. and you can give fish these certain fish food that you put in your tank and it atomatically feeds them for 3 days! so that makes one week with them alone! so your betta will be fine.|`|4df2db93737062f3650667e92c4077ceaa	Yes it will be perfectly fine. I would not suggest to put in more food than what you normaley feed it. Your fish might eat it all thinking it is the normal amount. Don't worry! This is what makes beta fish great pets. They don't eat a lot, they can fit almost in any size tank/bowl,and they are absolutly beautiful!|`|fYmD4Wbaaa	Yes it will be fine, I had a fish that lived for 5 years and i did that a couple of times, its actually harmful to feed fish too much.  Also its only 2 mornings|`|H9Nvo2gxaa	He will be perfectly fine with no food for the weekend.     A healthy betta can go 2 weeks without food but i don't recommend it.|`|5JLGyaWUaa	put in about 7 food pellets in the bowl before you leave. that should be good they will surivie trust me we were gone for a week and left 14 pellets adn he was okay|`|iFDN69Woaa	no problem! bettas can live without food for about two weeks and it's better for him that way too so he can clean out his digestive tract.    don't use those dumb self feeders, they pollute your water and most bettas don't even like it anyway. i tried and now that i think about it, it probably would've been much better to just not feed him at all.|`|oMINgkuiaa	you can buy a weeken feeder at a pet store. its a tablet kinda thing you just leave in the water till you get home. it will release food particles and nutrients for your fish.|`|4zspYrGXaa	Hi,  Cayyy is correct.  You can leave your Betta's for several days with no after effects.  The pellets and the weekend feeders will cause them pollution problems.
bDPVRtCNaa	I'm sorry about your fish.    What size tank?  Did you use a heater?  Do you have a filter?    Betta fish will live longer, healthier lives in at least a 2.5 gallon tank with filtration and an aquarium heater.

Do not put hem in direct sunlight.
lyocWukKaa	what type of fish are they?|`|Ik6WOcw3aa	Well, what comes to mind is Exodon Paradoxus. Ive seen them in my local shop and they are kept in a tank by themselves, with "HIGHLY AGGRESSIVE" written on the glass in a real bright neon marker.    http://images.search.yahoo.com/search/im...    Im pretty sure they also go by "bucked tooth tetra". Regardless of how many of these fish you get... There will still be kills. These fish are known to back piranha and large cichlids into a corner.|`|5knGTf5paa	its just picking on the smallest one..get more of them if its a schooling fish keep them in shoals of 5 or more and they will be happy and if you get like 7 none will get bulled because there are so many if the biggest one decides to pick on some theres 6 different ones to pick on and just one wont be getting picked on the most it will be evened out and they will be fine|`|lsO714NQaa	Most fish will eat ANYother fish that it(the bigger one) can fit in its mouth.|`|9759e8014743debd3d3fd1a7ad437c1faa	Many fish are cannibals, in the sense that they will eat smaller individuals of the same species. Trout, for example, are notorious for this.    If you tell us what species of fish you have, you would get better advice.|`|t85b6QMiaa	It'll be more helpful if we could know the species that you have. Shoaling fish will always feels safer and happier in larger shoal. Adversely, they'll be very unhappy if the shoal is not large enough. That may also be another reason aside the little fish is being weaker.    The species will determine what size of their minimal member in their shoal. For 3/4 inch, they could be neon tetra, tiger barb (which are well known to be very robust), harlequin rasbora, almost anything - even young Betta (just joking, Betta is not a schooling fish and I know you know that).

I would go with what the Vet suggests.  A shot can abort the litter if it isn't past so many days.    I think they did breed & she may or may not be pregnant.  She is not mature enough so she may have rejected his sperm.  Or maybe she didn't let the eggs drop.  Maybe she is so sexually inmature that she was not develped enough for her body to accept the sperm.    Yes a male dog can mount several times a day.  Like most men,  they just rest up a bit & they are rearing to go again.|`|Y4pfVX10aa	yes they can|`|ySr7QlgNaa	yes a male dog can breed menny times a day|`|CjIMwg1Qaa	its up to the dog|`|3c0ad1411f70d3bd5b671e71cde1c60eaa	Yes, they can and do mate more than one time a day.  There is about a 99.9% chance that they mated.  She is way to young to have a litter, so you need to take her tomorrow and have her spayed.  You will not know for several weeks if she is pregnant and x-ray is only accurate if done after the 33rd day.  So, call your vet tommorrow and take her in to be spayed.|`|e2467d7f948480d119ffefaeb0f5655baa	Its pretty rare that the FEMALE would have bred and then IMMEDIATELY went back for more, he could have missed and gotten tired, has happened to me before! But as for your male, they can breed as MANY times as their little bodies can handle in one day...     There isn't a pregnancy test, you either have to spay her or continue with the litter, or just wait and see if she REALLY is pregnant.    How long were they missing because they should have tied and the tie can last up to an hour sometimes!

CdRlOsnyaa	what temperture is his tank lately? if its to low he might be trying to hibernate?|`|vS1Z0inOaa	Wow, I've never seen that before... I thought I saw it all with RES. Is his water around 75 degrees?     I see my RES digging in the rocks all the time, and they ike to sit there to relax especially after a meal. RES have extra blood vessels around their throat so they can get oxygen by gulping water and don't have to surface to breathe for a long time. I heard a record of a turtle staying under for 8 days... However, I have never seen my RES dig in and sleep for more than a few hours.     If yours eats and basks and your water is warm enough, I really wouldn't worry. He's apparently healthy... But, wow, I'd be puzzled too... Two days or more, I've never seen that. What happens if you take the rocks away?     What do you mean by a dry patch in his shell? He's likely coming of time to shed his scutes... But if you see white or fuzzy spots or if his scutes start coming off and revealing raw, red spots, thenyou should start worrying about shell rot. But likely he's just shedding and that's normal.|`|ld2vmypNaa	IF the water is not 80 degrees  he will not eat and bury himself in the gravel to try and keep warm.   These turtles in captivity do not hibernate their eating may slow down some but they will not hibernate. They cannot hear or see well so they feel you coming by the vibrations each foot step take    ***Some sicknesses they get easily Like shell its actual holes rotting through the shell, dry spots..   Respiratory sickness, lopsided swimming, coughing, vomiting, blowing bubbles from their nose. .    Fungus white cotton patches on their skin, treat by adding a 1/4 of a cup of aquarium salt per 5 gallons to irritate and hopefully kill fungus.

etVzcc6gaa	I dont know alot about it as I buy incubators. All I can tell you is to look on google, it has everything!! haha  I'm guessing the cheapest way to make one is using a styrofoam box with a lid (you'll find them in fishing stores), a lightbulb (you'll have to look up how many watt you need, the one in my incubator is a 25w globe), and a thermometer. It would be best to put a thermostat in too so that the light turns off when it reaches the right temperature and turns back on when it starts to cool. This could be a bit trickier to make, I have heard of people using thermostats taken out of old ovens for incubators.  Also there are kits you can buy that have all the equipment needed to build an incubator. If your interested have a look on ebay, I sometimes see them on there.    Good luck!

YpEswTQdaa	Okay... The rabbit who gave birth is pregnant again,right?  How old are the Kits(Babies),she already has?    If so,she should be fine--no worries. Just remember to keep her calorie/energy levels up,so she remains an ideal weight. A similar thing happened to me once,with the first bunnies,got 2 rabbits both were 'males',one turned out to be a female,as i discovered a litter in the hutch! Before we could split them up,they mated again,resulting in another--smaller,but none of the less,a litter,about 4wks later. Both litters were healthy Kits. If the litter she has at the moment is a big one(over 4-5 kits) after the 4-5th day she re mated they will be aborted,by the mother her self(when they are developing in her womb) if its a small existing litter,she should go full cycle. This is a true fact,research if you don't believe me. However since,its been more than 5 days(?) they weren't aborted.    She will be fine,don't worry! Just make sure she is fed well & has plenty of nest material. Here's a guide to sexing,for the Kits:http://www.rabbitnetwork.org/articles/se...    Hope this helps,good luck! xxx    ADD:Oh that's even better then! No,you seem to care well for all your Rabbits,so even though you didn't know she was pregnant,she's going to be fine.=) Congrats.|`|kSWV0tlxaa	shave her?  i hope shes ok!    Xxx|`|zSpAZF9Oaa	I'm sure Smokey will be fine.  I don't know that much about rabbits (other than the obvious-SO CUTE!)  But if it's because the Minilop is a bigger breed than the Dwarf Dutch that you're worrying about,  her delivery should be fine.  Continue keeping a close eye on her in case you need to use any midwife skills to assist her (I had to do this with my cat one time)  Have your surgical gloves ready along with some rags.  Most animals give birth at night when it's quiet and dark, so you could put a blanket over her cage to make it dark and cozy for her. Leave a little hole so you can peek in for time to time.    I don't find that you were irresponsible at all.  These things happen and it normally turns out for the best.  My DD is such an animal lover, she would consider having another litter the best thing in the world.  I'm sure your kids are excited too.  They probably are thinking you're the bestest mom in the world because of this.  Nice memories for them later on.    Good luck with all of your cute little newborns - I'm jealous.  Please keep me up-dated too.  I show the pictures to me dd, we love seeing them.|`|XI2iylR4aa	I think everything will be ok, but to prevent future "accidents" and to protect the health of your does, you should get them spayed.  They will live longer, and no more unexpected litters!    Good luck.|`|NuUdCz0Laa	I guess the first thing would be to change Smokies name to Smokette. It is time to get some more cages, because it appears that your going to run out of room soon.  Smokette should be okay, just keep a watch on her when she starts her delivery.  My first wife and use to raise rabbits, we had about 60 does, so be prepared, or you will soon find yourself in the rabbit business.  Good luck to you and Smokette.

w1lh1INHaa	Offer to pay an extra security/damage deposit and an additional $10-$25/month in rent.

If so, you might have a chance with paying the extra rent or security deposit.  However, many times the landlords are only the managers in charge.  The owners make the rules and they will not make exceptions.      My advice is to wait until you either have a house of your own or wait until you can move into a place that will accept pets.   Chances are you will not live at your current residence for the cat's lifetime.  What are you going to do if you move and cannot take the cat with you?  You will have to think about the future and is it fair to the cat?  Just trying to give you a few things to think about.|`|SuMwWNfyaa	tell your landlord that itll sleep in your room and youll move outside.      that way there will only be one animal living inside his house.|`|TKgfCYfOaa	make sure you get a femal cat .. get it fixed.. male cats can cause problems because they get ill easily|`|3aed218d7132fc2698b7dfdebaab08f6aa	Unless there's a specified pet deposit amount and there is an option of being able to have pets in your rent agreement, your not getting a cat. You can risk getting your family evicted and not being able to find a nice place if you bring a cat in without permission. If there is a "no pets" rule, there's no breaking or bending that rule. As horrible as it may seem, you should forget about getting a cat right now. Maybe you could volunteer at the Humane Society?
2f2c6f10c5560ebd511a3a0f309b0f01aa	Domestic horses cannot graze freely on spring grasses like wild horses can, simply because they usually are not able to cover as much ground in movement as wild horse can, which is up to 25-30 miles per day.  Wild horses can exercise off their excess energy from new spring grasses, whereas domestic horses usually are not able to.  Although some domestic horses do fine on mixed-pastures that include all sorts of grasses and grains and weeds 24/7 year round because of the mix.  Horses on spring 100% brome fields for example, would not fare as well because of the lushness.    It is best to have a place of containment, whether a smaller pasture or paddock, where your horses can reside during the spring peak growing season and beyond so that they can be pulled off the larger green pasture for proper management.     When things begin greening up, begin managing their time in the larger pasture.  Start out with about 20-30 minutes out early in the morning, when the grasses are less pre-disposed to higher sugar levels.  Also, when it rains, the sugars in the grasses are not as high.  By the end of the first week, they should be able to tolerate 30-60 minutes and by the end of the second week, they should be able to tolerate up to several hours.    Your horses health history and ages play a factor in how well they can metabolize their food, so keep these factors in mind.  Horses left to their own on rich, lush, green tall grasses can begin walking in with sore feet before you are able to realize what is taking place.  By that time they are in the early stages of founder, which usually affects the front feet first.    If in doubt whether your horse may be getting "hot-footed", you may take his pulse over the fetlock joint.  The normal pulse rate at rest is 36 - 42.  If his pulse is faster than normal and pounding, you likely have a horse that is hot-footed and need to take immediate action by keeping him away from all food except a small ration of hay and water until his condition improves (usually about two weeks to six weeks, depending on the stage of laminitis).    Also, never let emotion be your guide.  Your horses will always want to graze on lush pasture.  Avoid the temptation to let them out because it will make them "happy".  Stick to good management principles, to include constant observation of your horses, and you'll be fine.  Close observation of your horses can prevent acute conditions, large vet bills, and fatalities.  Just asking the question you did shows that you are a conscientious horse owner.  Good for you.|`|3wIZiZA5aa	Probably only a few hours at a time. Tun them out in the morning and put them back in thier stalls after a few hours.   Sorry I couldn't help more because my horses are out on pasture all year long as well as with hay in the winter and grain twice a day all year.|`|AA12048299	If there's no predisposition to laminitis, I'd start with an hour a day for a week, then two hours a day for a week, then 3 for a week. After that, you can up it by an hour after 3 or 4 days.    After exposure to grass, always monitor temp., digital pulse, manure consistency. If you notice anything abnormal, consult a vet and keep off grass until vet consults.     You're smart to be cautious.. grass is more rich in the spring, and it's easy for the horse to founder/ colic from eating too much toosoon.  ....................  ETA; I see your guys are already on grass. In that case, you may wish to cut them back to 3 hours a day for a month or two in the spring, checking feet and vitals each day as they come in. You can also be sure to give them hay before t/o so they're less likely to gorge themselves on the grass.     If you don't have a dry lot to put them in while not on grass, you can keep them on the grass with a muzzle. Just be sure it fits properly so as not to get caught on anything.|`|j45Q2ipRaa	This question will get as many answers as there are respondents.  But it is great that you are thinking ahead.  I am one that errs on the side of caution, so take it for what it is worth.    In my experience, I start with 20 minutes for the first few days, then go up to an hour for a week, then an hour and a half, then 2.  Once you hit the 2 hour mark, you are pretty safe and the fresh spring grass isn't quite as potent.    Watch the manure and your horse for changes.  Should you be getting diarrhea, back off the time.  Should you notices changes that imply the horse is sick (fever, etc) call your vet.|`|3LXbUg1raa	If your horses are already out on pasture and have been for quite some time, there really shouldn't be any problems letting them remain on pasture unrestricted as they are now.  Unless, of course, your horses have a history of stomach/GI tract issues such as colic, or have had a history of laminitis, IR (insulin resistance), obesity, etc.  It can take up to a full year for the microorganisms in a horses GI tract to fully adjust and multiply enough to efficiently metabolize pasture grass...however, if your horses are used to pasture and have been on pasture for while again, it should be fine unless your horses are predisposed to or have a history of ailments associated with richer foods such as green grass...If you are worried or your horses haven't been on pasture long, then keep them out for a few hours a day and increase the amount of time spent on pasture gradually over a period of time allowing them to adjust.  Early morning or late evening are the best turnout times, with early morning being the best for horses prone to laminitis.    Normally, though, if your horse is out on pasture all the time from the time before the grass turns green, as the new grass comes up the horse will usually adjust naturally to the green grass, since the new grass doesn't all 'poof' and turn green at once, but does so gradually as well, allowing for the horse to have time to adjust to it.  Also, to err on the side of caution, you can also keep feeding hay for a few days/weeks until you are sure your horses seem to have fully adjusted to pasture...over that course of time, slowly wean your horses off of the hay...|`|IMPvzBk1aa	Horses that are on pasture consistently every day leading into spring do fine without restriction.  Unless a horse is prone to colic, or has a history of laminitis, or has been diagnosed as insulin resistant, there is seldom any problem.  Fructan is the sugar that disturbs hindgut bacteria and causes all the problems. In early morning, fructan levels in the grass are lowest, and in late afternoon or early evening, they are highest.  The greatest risk is in late April or May, when levels peak.  but mowing the pasture to between 4 and 8 inches grass height considerably reduces fructan levels.  Levels become less of a problem in June and for the rest of the summer.  Also, some warm weather grasses are low in fructan anyway, while others are high.  Turning horses out in very early morning and leaving them out until mid afternoon goes far to prevent colic and laminitis in horses that are prone, for one reason or another.  Grazing muzzles which restrict intake are also effective, and allow the horse to be out all day without the concerns for over ingesting high fructan grasses.  I've seen few problems with this in horses kept on pasture every day coming into spring, even when grazing is not restricted.  But to stay on the side of caution, bring them in before late afternoon.
2Jmodoaeaa	It'd be a lot easier for us to tell you if you are overfeeding them or not had you told how much you feed them. I don't know if you give them 20 flakes each, or 1/4 of a flake.

You only should be feeding what the fish can eat in just a few minutes no more than 2 times a day.  If there's food left after about 3 minutes, then that's too much.    Are the guppies' scales sticking out from the body?  If that's what you see, then that's not overfeeding, it's dropsy.  Here's more about that.  http://www.fishchannel.com/fish-health/d...    Is your tank new?  If so, it might be cycling, which is building up bacteria to process the wastes from your fish.  While this is happening, the ammonia and nitrite can make your fish lethargic, so that could be at least a part of the problem.    More on that.  http://www.fishlore.com/NitrogenCycle.ht...    And are you positive the fish are males?  Females have a tendency to swell up and become less active, but for other reasons.  ;-)   Males have a pointed anal fin, the 1 at the bottom, but the female's is rounded.  http://www.aqua-fish.net/imgs/fish/guppy...  The male in the picture is also on the *well fed* side.
t85b6QMiaa	Sorry, no offense means for Austin C - but I didn't see any pea mention. If it is a term or a slang, I ask for your kindness to enlightened me.    Mr Sheer, Oscar is a very gluttonous fish. They really need a large amount of food. I'd say it is not a very good idea to starve him. The worst thing is that they become enrage and start attacking another member of the tank as well. A furious fish may also injure himself by hitting the tank glass or any accessories in the tank.    Just feed them as you always do. You don't have to be concern about their stomach.

thCmn0noaa	Sounds like a skin disorder, it may be as simple as an allergy or as difficult as the mange.  Mange tests are easy, the vet just looks at the hair follicles under a microscope to see the little critters.  Allergies are more difficult to determine because they have to do a different test per allergen which can get pretty expensive.  Are the patches bleeding or raw or just bald.  You could try switching him to an allergy special food to see if that helps.  He may just have a skin infection which needs some antibiotic ointment.  Hard to determine without pictures.|`|QVP8zSuWaa	It sounds like a skin disease. If I were you before it gets worse take a few good pictures and send it them to your Vet back here. If you post them in here someone might know exactly what it is.|`|FewhKlx9aa	Mastiffs need a high quality food ,no junk or cheap foods.The fact he is starting the patches sounds like he is getting a dermititis a skin disorder from the cheap food..This can be corrected with a very good all natural diet and because they suffer many health problems such as hip and bone disorders to keep him healthy and live a long life it is worth it to feed him a very good holistic-all natural diet..I personally feed my dogs Halo pet food and there are many others out there|`|svg71dazaa	Where in Africa are you? I live in South Africa and the vets are pretty good in Johannesburg and Pretoria and Cape town. Sounds like mange and it can be deadly for a puppy if not treated properly.|`|C1eHfhrHaa	probably demodex mange.  they inherit it from the mom as puppies.  Go to the vet for a skin scraping and if that is what it is, ask for ivermectin to treat it.  If it does not get treatd, it will continue to get worse.
pjrPYAasaa	if It's a Pot Belly Molly, than it's hard 2 tell....... FYI.....B4 she delivers... get a fry catch and separate the biggest fry... he/she will end up eating it's siblings...

Often a lot of them don't live so make sure you give them the right amount of food. Also, don't put them in with the other fish until they are fully grown. Hope this helps, good luck!!
ejj2N3uaaa	Unless you're showing upper level, you can easily pull off one outfit for both disciplines.    I'd go with your classic look of beige/khaki breeches, a white shirt with collar, nice field boots, and a navy coat. Going with anything less "traditional," while popular now in h/j (ie, brown or green coats, colored shirts), will stand out too much in dressage. Then again, you don't want to do the black coat, white shirt, and white breeches of dressage, either, because it's too dressage-y for h/j. The classic beige/white/navy works fine until you're showing at higher levels.    Ebay is definitely your friend :). So are used items.     I'm 21 and have been showing English since I was 12--for years I did both h/j, hunter u/s classes (both 4-H, open shows, schooling shows, Arabian shows, and QH shows), and dressage and always had the same outfit--the navy/white/beige combo. I didn't get my dressage tack until I was older and started showing in more dressage (and now I rarely, if ever, do dressage anymore); at that time I also changed attire and began wearing various colored shirts with a brown jacket for h/j and sticking with the navy/white for dressage.    In answer to your question, yes, one outfit is fine--as long as it's traditional, clean, and well-fitted. It doesn't have to be expensive! The only thing you might want to consider is that if you're showing and you get dirt on your breeches (or hoof polish, or horse slobber, or grass stains, whatever), you might want to have an extra pair--even if it's just a cheap pair that you use only for backup.|`|NiQAfFUPaa	You will probably be showing training level.  If so buy the hunter outfit it will work for both.|`|dt2DUI1uaa	Most hunter classes require beige breeches and the traditional for dressage would be white, but I think you would be fine buying one very sturdy pair, maybe a light beige or cream color.  You could also use the same show shirt underneath your coat if you are still in small shows, same goes for the stock tie or chocker...  I am not sure about the coats. You surely need a hunt coat if you want to show in Hunter Jumper, but I am not sure about dressage, sorry =[|`|RUzBDX6Jaa	you will have to buy 2 different jackets, at least :)  Black and white isn't the average colours for hunter/jumper, but it is for dressage.  Just get a red, green, or blue jacket and a black one, or something.  Or you could get a really dark navy blue, and pass it off as black :)  It'll work, and you could, if you wish, wear the white breeches in all classes, but you should wear white in dressage, and tan in jumping/hunter :)  Im no hunter/jumper, but I do ride dressage.  Your choice :)|`|qdtU1Q1Laa	Unless your doing 1st level and higher dressage, creme breeches will be perfectly fine! As for jackets you should be ok getting a dark jacket [[navy, black...]].     Hope this helps! :)|`|9IZ0CmxPaa	You will need different jackets for dressage VS hunters but I'm not sure about breeches...|`|lTeXIjpOaa	i know many riders who wear a hunt coat and the same breeches for their hunt seat classes and beginner dressage, i wouldnt worry about having dressage specific clothes until you get to large shows or an intermediate level, ebay is very cheap for riding clothes|`|WJJMZ9IQaa	S M M H or whatever, none of your answers are good tonight...  Hunters do not wear red huntcoats... that's more show jumping when you can go more "crazy" with colors.  Most hunt coats are navy or grey but they can be pinstripes, plaid, plain etc  If you are just at a beginning level of dressage and are showing at local shows you might be able to get away with a huntcoat but dressage jackets are different..... boots are also usually field for hunter dress for dressage (laces vs. no laces)    It depends on your age/level of dressage..  but usuaully you wear..  and outfit like this http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Hannov...  -white breeches  -belt  -stock tie  -white gloves (beginners sometimes wear black)  -and a solid black jacket  -beginners sometimes use helmets but you should wear a top hat that matches your jacket    Hunters wear   -Beige breeches  -White or colored ratcatcher (show shirt)  -navy, dark green, dark brown, **sometimes** black huntcoat  -Tall field boots (if young you can get away with paddocks and a garter)  -a certified helmet such as a charles owen or irh  -dark gloves should be worn   **NON-TRADITIONAL ATTIRE IS NOT ACCEPTABLE** very conservative and strict|`|RloOJ43haa	Hunter and dressage actually have different coats. Hunter coats have three buttons and double vents at the back. Dressage coats are always navy or black and have four buttons and a single vent at the back. However, for small, unrecognized local dressage shows, you can wear a polo shirt of conservative color or a nice jersey. You should be able to wear the same breeches. Dressage rules actually say they must be white or light. So, if you can get some light breeches for your hunter classes, you can wear those a both.     I'm not sure if you can wear a polo or jersey for hunters at a local show.|`|zk5VBdLEaa	i don't know about dressage but i do know a lot about hunters, in the hunter ring you should never wear a black jacket, navy blue or grey is ideal but for small shows green is acceptable, wear a white shirt and beige pants and that would be perfect!
dd29142df42d00c2832dc987bcd6b003aa	Ducks are not mammals they do not produce milk for their young ,ducklings begin to eat for themselves as  soon as they are able to move to the food container on their own,which is a few hours after they have hatched & are dry & Mobile.Ducks do not regurgitate semi digested food for their young as pigeons & some  other birds do to feed their  immobile hatch lings in the nest.|`|tRfgwT5saa	Baby ducks don't drink milk from their mothers.|`|M7pYK1rJaa	They don't drink milk.

kWwgWSSgaa	You will not be able to find a responsible Schnauzer x Poodle breeder, as it is contradiction in terms. Schnauzers & Poodles are completely separate breeds, with their own breed standards.    Purebred dog should only be crossed if an experienced breeder wants traits from both breeds for a specific function {for example a working lurcher} If that isn't the case purebred dogs should remain just that.    You may be able to find Schnoodle puppy advertised in your local paper, on Epupz or at a local shelter. As a rule of thumb people who breed popular cross bred dogs, ask inflated prices for them, so it's a case of buyer beware.|`|lhOd2hvXaa	Check your local Humane Society.  A Schnoodle is a mixed breed and there are plenty of them in need of good homes.    Good Luck!|`|gwUMipsUaa	Shelters.

RwQmN7Reaa	Cats are normally pregnant for about 60-67 days. Being able to feel the kittens inside definitely means they are growing but it's hard to give an estimate just because you can feel a bump. You will know when she is getting ready to give birth, her rear end will swell and you will notice blood starting a few hours before she starts to give birth. She may also begin to drip a little milk but you may not even notice it. If you need a more accurate estimate the only way would be to have a vet look and probably do an ultrasound they could tell you how developed the kittens are and based on that how long it will be before their birth.|`|Y8MZCLIQaa	It's hard to tell when because you don't know the date they were conceived. Chances are she'll give birth after it rains, if she goes missing at any point.. look under beds, inside couches (if they've got holes in) and anywhere else your cat could crawl that's nice and quiet.  You can take her to the vet and they'd be able to give you a more exact estimate but nothing is guaranteed.
NwwhSpYAaa	As a vet technician Ive been present in dozens of euthanasias, and during all of them the results are instantiations. We use what we call Fatal + a.k.a Blue Juice and it is an O.D of a anesthesia, theyre literally being put to sleep with this. I cant say its not painful (due to the prick of the needle), but I dont believe the actual euthanizing causes the animals any pain.|`|AztYCjc7aa	I honestly don't know if it hurts or doesn't all I know is what I observed. Seeing the whole process of my dog being put to sleep a few years ago didn't look like she suffered, she looked like she got very sleepy and just closed her eyes. I believe she went painlessly and can only hope that is the case.|`|4ZGRgUd2aa	i guess we don't really know. I remember my when we had to put my first dog down and when the started putting the stuff in her she let out the most horrible cry, but when my sister put her dog down she went peacefully. I can only hope that it doesn't hurt, because it would break my heart to think that their last moments on earth were painful.|`|u4WU01EXaa	The animal is put under anaesthetic before they put it to sleep so i guess they probably wouldn't feel it.|`|pvgwJwxvaa	because the euthanasia solution is literally an overdose of a barbituate.  ever taken narcotic pain meds?  they feel awesome!|`|sRCmVOY9aa	I'm an experienced vet tech of 8 years and have been through many euthanasia's not only with my own pets but other client's pets that I work with. Its an overdose of an anesthetic so the pet just basically falls into a deep sleep. Then it stops the heart. The pet is not in any pain and you can see it in their behavior before and after it is given.  Wish they had this kind of drug for humans for if I am suffering and I will never be cured, and it is my time to go..The that's what I would want.  Hope this helps!|`|P8Q39vA4aa	Because proper euthanasia is an overdose of anesthesia. Anesthesia does not hurt the animals, its designed to essentially put them in a deep sleep the overdose makes it so its  a permanent sleep.|`|tPGxPDvBaa	We don't  Same as putting a person to death by lethal injection- who knows whether it hurts or not.  Most dogs are sedated beforehand so I doubt it is painful.  I had to pts 4 of my dogs & they didn't seem to be in pain.|`|EeJMITyCaa	The same wawy we know that it doesn't hurt humans. How do we know that carpet doesn't hurt animals too|`|2u8teJkJaa	I does not hurt them but it does kill them. When using Tranq in addition to the Euthanasia it can be painful.|`|QVP8zSuWaa	I have been with everyone of my dogs that I have had to euthanize, They just went to sleep peacefully. No pain, no flinch, no whimper. I would know if my animals are in pain    I still miss everyone of them|`|9UttDvcsaa	I have seen several horses put to sleep.  The heart beats only in and out once and they lay down and are gone.  I would imagine it is even faster with smaller animals who have a higher heart rate.  Listen to the vet tech's post she is the most knowledgeable and I have heard the same thing.
3funFya2aa	I had a problem with my puppy after I brought him home.. He did this for a couple of months. Whined and whined for hours on end! And now that I actually think of it, he still does it! And he's about a year and a half old now.  He probably doesn't need to go outside the use the bathroom if you don't give him water before he goes to bed. He wants attention.     They do sell things you plug into the wall that's supposed to calm them down. Look on pet smart's website. I bought one dirt cheap on ebay. Not really sure if it worked though. My dog is not very bright..   What I did to get him used to the crate was made a cd with a "heart beat" track.. keep it on repeat. I guess it calms them and reminds them of the mother dog's heart beat that they're used to.   And filled a water bottle up with warm water and wrapped it in a towel, also supposed to remind them of their mother. It took a while for my pup to get used to.. but he quiet downed a lot more.    Yes. IGNORE HIM. Eventually.. he will get the point. And slowly move his crate OUT OF YOUR ROOM.|`|im3vWyv6aa	I wonder if you put his crate in the living room, if it would be better??? Maybe he's whining because he knows you're right there and he knows he can wake you.    Our puppy is crated in our living room. We keep our bedroom door open, so we would be able to hear her. However, we brought her home when she was 3 months old and she has never woke us up in the middle of the night. I have actually never heard her whine in her crate. But, we go to bed late and we get up at like 5:00 AM to get the kids ready for school... so she is really only in her crate 5-6 hours.    Best wishes...|`|JIvvg6f7aa	Do you keep his crate in your bed room? If not try that. Thats what shut up my dox. Good luck.|`|L22hVXTIaa	He is still a puppy and a toy breed at that.  He's physical ability to hold it has its limits.  Sometimes he may be able to go longer than others, but when he wakes you and whines to go out, you have to oblige him.  As he gets older, he will be able to have more control.  But for now, he's still a baby.|`|AztYCjc7aa	When you take him out does he scramble to make it to the bathroom? If so he needs to go more often, if not he is probably just ready to wake up and you are not, the best way to train him out of this is IGNORE the behavior, keep on sleeping or pretending to. He will whine for a while but BE PATIENCE this is a waiting game and your will must be stronger as you are reinforcing the behavior when you let him out when he whines and it's now a habit, let him out only after he has quieted down. Do not talk to him during his whining, do not shush or reassure him just remain quiet and patient. Also I would stop all food and water after 7 so his bladder is not in question for his behavior.    I would only try to correct his behavior if you are sure he isn't crying about needing to go, determine that first.|`|EeJMITyCaa	Just ignore him but I'm not sure I would because you'd get in the habit of ignoring the dog and then when it really has to go you wont respond and he'll go in th cage and that's a whole new probably. I mean he hsouldn't have to hold it anyway if you're keeping him in a cage. That's ridicolous. What if someone told you that everyday of your life you could only have access to the bathroom every 8 hours. Eventually one day you wouldn't be able to hold it for some reason (maybe you'd have drunk a lot of water that day or maybe have a urinary track infection). So if your dog is oly doing it the last two hours I would get up and take him to potty and then just put him right back in the cage.|`|O545aSKWaa	Well you're dog has officially trained you!   If you break down and take him out he's already learned that if he does it long enough he'll get what he wants.    What always does the trick is a squirt bottle. Cover his crate at night and play some music or talk radio to drown out all the ambient noise. If he starts to act up, get to his crate squirt him a few times and tell him to be quiet then cover him up and go to bed again. If you don't want to use a squirt bottle use something else like an empty soda can with a bunch of pennies in it. What ever it is that will get his attention.    DO NOT TAKE HIM OUT OF HIS CRATE!    If he does make a mess clean it up and put him right back in. Under no circumstances is he allowed to win. If he makes a mess and you let him out then you are going to teach him that making a mess in his crate is what gets him out.    Oh and BTW make sure he doesn't get water or food a few hours before bedtime and make sure he potties before bed time too. Good luck!|`|0TvSFiVMaa	just leave it alone ignore!!!  or if you must aekljf;ailjsefil;aj|`|hPhQkT79aa	Set your alarm clock to wake up earlier|`|isF1nhVfaa	I can hold it through a ten hour shift at work, doesn't mean I like it.

Take him out.|`|xqU1N1VBaa	it takes a lot of time and a lot of training. on your part and the dogs part. you need to work out a way that works with your dog. he might just be an early riser.    for our dogs right before bed we would take them for a walk. it doesnt have to be far just enough to feel a bit better, after the walk i would let them out in the backyard to romp for a bit. try to tire him before bed so he sleeps longer.     you could also change the feeding times so you can sounds crude but mold his bladder to fit your sleeping skills.
w4DIPHf1aa	2 tanks...sweet....    just some thoughts....      The 30    Cardinals are far better visually than neons, plus being a very timid fish school tightly even in peaceful tanks.    platies and guppies want salt in there water to live a happy life, i would go all live bearers or none.    your going to reduce the life span of either the tetras or the live bearers depending on what you do.    The dwarf gourami (honey) is a nice addition, great fish.      The 75    Angels can be really mean, make sure you get a gentle species if possible.    5 panda's? these are the most social of the cories. I would load up on these guys. For a 75 I'd get 10, they will swim like little squadrons around the tank.    Every else if those are the fish you like...sweet..    You may want try and find some Torpedo Bards...as an alternative if you like them.

The vet said it was because he could not urinate and his toxicity levels were through the roof.

She's probably in pain, and that's why the shiver when you touch her.    There are so many things that can go wrong with kittens / cats......swallowing something that obstructs( or tangles in ) their insides, urinary tract infections, diseases that they try to hide from us, chewing on plants that poison them, licking things that have been bleached, getting into pills that have dropped on the floor, roach/rat/mouse poison, etc etc etc...................    Also, if your female has NOT been spayed, she may be having a heat cycle.  This would cause her to "act weird"....or if she's pregnant ( lump in belly? ) she may be going to deliver kittens, and she's resting up for that!

Plus, if things don't work out well, you can at least take some comfort in knowing that you did all you possibly could to help her.|`|rsAqrbsgaa	take her to the vet you stupid boy|`|vM2o0Nicaa	Take him to the vet|`|8Ijjrl8baa	take her to the vet she might have cancer  or it could just be a hair ball..or pregnat  take her to a vet tho for shor
gzwdEZcMaa	i don't blame your dog it was your husbands fault for not letting her out. Madison n no offence but ur an idiot|`|L22hVXTIaa	Everyone knows - - it's always the husband's fault ;-)  Seriously though, the dog did her part - when you gotta go, you gotta go.  Next time tell hubby not to be so lazy, or make him do the clean up.|`|lzIN4loXaa	Let's face it it happens at least once to even the best trained dogs. They also say that if you get stern with a dog after the fact it just confuses it and makes it... sad (doesn't sound like quite the right word but you get my point). Unless you caught her in the act what's done is done. The best thing you can do is let it go, and if the chances are she isn't likely to do it again then, why bother really.|`|ORe8qdtTaa	Sorry but I think this needs discipline - you need to take a newspaper roll it up and beat YOU HUSBAND round the head with it!    Sounds to me your doing great with training your dog  hmmm husband could do with a bit more work though mate x    EDIT  ok this is weird but if you ever want someone to chat to in the UK let me know on this thread - just get thefeeling we would get on !|`|xwHAdsacaa	I AGRREEE WITH YOU....BUT IF ITS KIND OF TUFF HAVING TO TAKE OUT THE DOG EVERY LKE HOUR OR SOMETHING.I HAVE A 6 POUND CHIHUAHUA AND SHE KNOWS WHERE TO PE BECAUSE I BUY SOME PADS AND THEY SMELL THE PAD AND THEN THEY GO PEE OR SUMTIMESZ POOP ON IT  MY DOG SHE ACTUALLY GOES POO ON THE BATHROOM FLOOR  WE JUST PICK IT UP WITH A PECE OF TOILET PAPER AND THROW IT IN THE TOILET NO BIG DEAL.BUT also i agree with these people ...the pads r in walmart...just in case|`|r9naSarcaa	When your dog's sitting by the door, it's tellin you 'i gotta go, take me out please!" so it's toatally not ur dogs fault.|`|0I9Fm00Naa	I agree 100% with Katieeee  it was not the dog's fault and she should not be punished for the accident. There is no reason why your husband could not let her outside to go even if he would have had to gone outside to wait for her.|`|CkecSp4Uaa	I might have "disciplined" my husband for that one!  Of course, he knows better.  "Disciplining" a dog for eliminating in the house is generally pointless as most of the time the dog is doing it because they feel they can't hold it any longer.  If I catch them in the act I might "yell" at them to break their concentration and take them outside to finish.  But what's done is done and you just have to suck it up and clean it up.  Besides, every time my dogs have had accidents in the house and it hasn't been my fault for ignoring them they've always had a legitimate medical condition (like giardia) that made them truly unable to hold it any longer.|`|CNer40Xhaa	You need to discipline her|`|6XHesUihaa	yep, you're right, it's your husband's fault|`|KxjUim7yaa	You need to discipline the lazy slob of a husband.

It was your husbands fault..He didn't take her out when she adequately let know him know she needed to go.  He didn't listen--She went in the house instead.

p7swtBYzaa	I have four leather sofas, one in the living room, one in the master bedroom, one in my office, and one in the great room.  As long as you buy top quality, whole hide (not patched together strips), leather is far more sturdy than cloth - for animals and humans.    I do put throws on the sofas, especially over the backs because I have 6 dachshunds  and they all like to perch on the back of the sofas - and all over them in general.  Haven't had any damage from dogs yet.|`|0SHAY9TQaa	I own 3 dogs and 2 cats.    I bought 2 brand new leather sofas a few months back. My dogs love to jump on the furniture. But, they are scared of the leather! Haha, they haven't even tried to jump on it for the past 6 months.    But, I can recommend a few things for you. Lay blankets on the seat of the cushions. That way, if they do jump on it, they won't scratch the leather. Of, make the couches a no-dog zone. If they jump, pull them off and say "off."    Good Luck!|`|kWwgWSSgaa	I have a soft black leather chair that has stood up very well to being *much loved* by my two Dobermanns who enjoy snuggling into it. There are no scratches or tears, as I keep their claws short.    I intend to buy a leather sofa & chairs next, as the material sofa has not fared nearly as well as the leather chair.    I would suggest considering a black, brown, dark green sofa & avoid white, cream, beige colours.   http://www.flickr.com/photos/fallonbrook...|`|uHCIxJmqaa	should be fine if they dont eat or chew on the stuff you have now - just keep their nails short and things should be fine!|`|ZT0K3q2Aaa	Yes, their nails will scratch up the leather sofa, and give the leather a scratched up look. How about getting comfy dog beds and keeping them off the furniture?|`|wvrgyYoUaa	Leather couch -- Siberian Husky,  Mine is fine, just keep their nails short.|`|ATBtH7eTaa	I own all leather furniture and have 3 dogs.

But if your deadset on leather get all animals booties to where like socks it will do wonders.|`|V1pOG3Cgaa	With dogs and cats, leather sofas will be torn up especially by the cats. My sisters cats destroyed her leather sofa. I have 1 dog and I covered the sofa with those non-slip pads and on top of that I put thick slip covers on the sofas. But most of all I don't let my dog on the sofa. You can train dogs to stay off, but not sure of cats.|`|yEUo24Znaa	Trust me, get the leather.  Make sure it is 100%  leather if you have kitties.

You might want to grind the dogs nails down instead of only clipping so there are no sharp edges at all.|`|EeJMITyCaa	If they're nails are clipped they won't but it's a chance they could puncture the leather if theyre too long. Otherwise if they aren't destructive then nope.
OxFsslN8aa	I give my springer & my dachshund raw egg, venison, cooked vegetables (cooked because they do not absorb raw vegetables as well as cooked), olive oil & cottage cheese.  I don't give all of these every day.  Together with their dog food, I believe these will aid in my dogs overall health.|`|Os6VjLH0aa	I don't give any "supplements" as far as vitamins and such, as I do believe that a good diet doesn't need to be supplemented. That said, mine get a 5 star food, and they get raw knuckle bones, for teeth and for the glucosamin and stuff in them. They also get raw meat scraps from butchered game, raw eggs, organ meat and a lot of times, leftover dinner scraps with their food.  Just depends on what I have around. Meats that are good are raw chicken, turkey, game, like rabbit, goose, elk, venison, Raw beef knuckle bones, most anything a wolf would eat, a dog can eat too.  NO COOKED BONES, only raw. Heat realigns the molecular structure of bones, causing them to splinter.   My dogs only get dairy, like cottage cheese, when they are puppies, and pregnant and lactating bitches. Sometimes I use a little cheese as training treats or to get a pill down a throat.   Mine have gotten to the point where they turn down milk bone type treats, no meat, no eat, that's their philosophy!|`|a29qiNkvaa	I give my dogs fish pills I get them form Costco! This helps with skin and coat!   I also give them yogurt and cottage cheese! Beef Tripe is also good!     I am not sure I would give wither one of my dogs the brewers yeast or the vita coat! I have herd the brewers yeast is really bad for them and the vita coat if it ahs wheat germ it would be a NO! Both of my dogs have allergies to wheat anything|`|AA10412922	Solid gold seameal,omega 3s,mine get raw chicken necks but not in the same meal as kibble|`|CkecSp4Uaa	Personally I feel that supplementation needs to be done on a specific individual basis.  There is such a thing as too much of a good thing and over supplementing can be dangerous, even deadly (no, really, there have been a few cases of unexpected human deaths that were eventually tracked down to the person using too many supplements and/or herbal remedies).  Supplements are generally NOT regulated by the FDA and supplements are not even legally required to contain the things that the label claims they contain!  Supplementing your dog's diet is ok, but it is best to focus on a few supplements that are beneficial to your dog based on your dog's particular health.      Essential fatty acids and vitamin E are a good supplement to support a healthy coat and skin.  In addition to dermatological benefits, these supplements also seem to have some anti-inflammatory properties and can be especially beneficial for dogs with allergies and arthritis (both conditions usually involve some sort of inflammatory response by the immune system).    Vitamin C can be great for dogs with a history of urinary tract issues.  It changes the pH of the urine and can reduce the chances of an infection.  Vitamin C also seems to have anti-inflammatory properties which can help with the inflammation caused by bladder infections and there is some evidence that it can help with soft tissue repair and inflammation associated with arthritis.    Glucosamine supplements are great for joints and can make a world of difference with dogs who have arthritis or other joint conditions.  Most glucosamine supplements also contain ingredients that help reduce inflammation (such as MSM).|`|g2I2C68waa	try Nuvets

He sure sounds like a Female,although males will mate each other in dominance & young males(Bucks) can also have mood-swings,although not as commonly as Females(Does). Its very rare if a male,pulls fur.  My guess is 'he'--is a 'she'. Here:http://www.rabbitnetwork.org/articles/se...    XxX    ADD: Oh okay. Some males can act odd,my friends neutered male rabbit would occasionally pluck fur. Although,like i said before its rare. He's sounds like the 'under-dog',the other rabbit is 'Top-Bun'. I am guessing they aren't neutered,judging by the fact they have testicles. Neutering will help this. =)

lhOd2hvXaa	Titles are wonderful but what health testing have each of the dogs had?

vPde97E2aa	WHAT??????  Have you read this from the source or just "heard it through the grapevine"??    IF it's true,it sure is a gigantic load of manure!    My event is one-at-a-time until the highest level-Master Earthdog- & interfering w/the bracemate in that class is a disqualification;play or aggression. As a long time judge,I could immediately stop the test & remove the culprit from further testing. The host club can file a report & send it in for further action by AKC,including barring the animal from entering again. The same applies to conformation dogs,you know.|`|JtZfTiEEaa	It depends on your definition of "harrass".  Simply being an unruly, untrained dog is not, in the AKC's opinion, reason to suspend or ban the dog from performance events.    I know in obedience, if a dog is exceptionally out of control during the first portion of their attempt, the dog may be excused by the judge for stays.  (This is new as of last year, I believe).  Also, if  a dog breaks the first of the 2 stays (meaning wanders to another dog or away from their spot- not just changing to the wrong position)- that dog will be excused for the remaining stay.  However, the dog is allowed to compete the next day.    In agility, the dog may be excused by the judge if s/he is sufficiently out of control and has, in the judge's opinion, "stopped working".   However, that applies to that run only.    Should the dog leave the ring and "attack" another dog,  the dog and handler WILL be written off, and I think 2 incidences will ban the dog from competition.    I don't know a lot about the hunt tests, etc., but I believe that there are events where the dog must be "certified" before they can compete- meaning that the dog must show that he/she *can* concentrate on the task at hand.  Only after being certified is the dog allowed to enter the hunt tests.  I believe tracking is the same way.|`|JiCKFTuIaa	Every form of test/trial has it's own type of circumstances. So there is no way to have any kind of universal rule. With retrievers it is fairly common for a dog to brake from an "honor" and interfere with the running dog. The offending dog gets to go home, the dog that was interfered with gets a re-run. The one thing that a dog can be banned from is of course dog fights.  Oh, and the dog CAN NOT be disqualified for eating the judges lunch! (been through that one)    The one thing I get from judges seminars is that AKC feels that to many dogs are earning titles so the tests must be to easy, and they need to be made more difficult.  Their argument is that the dogs have become better (so much for improving the breed)|`|x8Vgu6acaa	I just went to an AKC Obedience seminar last weekend.  The rules in obedience are.    1. a people or dog attack inside the ring that results in an injury = dismissal by judge and reporting to AKC and the dog is banned from all events.  The owner can appeal and the dog is evaluated by AKC to determine if it can be reinstated.  2.  Unmanageable dog is excused & cannot go back into the ring for any of the remaining exercises.  3.  Any attacks on human or dog outside of the ring is to be reported to show super and the dog is to be removed from grounds and an investigation done.  The dog may be banned from future events.    I also know this to be true in agility also.    I don't know what field or coursing rules are.  Sorry.  In my opinion any dog that shows aggressiveness to people or other dogs needs to be banned.  At the minimum removed from the grounds that day until an official evaluation can be made to determine the safety of that dog.    ADD:   Just checked to Lure coursing rules.    Section 9;  a dog will be excused if it tracks another dog rather than the lure  Section 10.  A dog will be disqualified if it attacks another dog without cause.  It will be reported and not be able to enter any other AKC events until or if it is reinstated after a review.  A dog will not be disqualified if it is defending itself.      These are from the rules approved as of 1/1/09|`|Mcf33eLbaa	Their are so many things I question in all performance AKC events at times.  In obedience for example a dog can and should be excused for being unruly in the on or off leash heeling and for breaking a stay in the group exercises but some judges just seem to turn a blind eye.  I remember having one of my Flat Coats in the group stays in Novice.  We were doing really well and on our way to a high 190`s, well my guy was parked between 2 other dogs. Now normally when a dog breaks the judge is to tell the ring stewards to go get the dog and pull it out of the line up.  Well in this situation both dogs got up and walked over to mine and started sniffing and licking him to the point where finally he got up to get away from them.  The entire time I`m looking at the judge wondering if she was going to do something about it, but didn`t. Finally I got out of line and went and got my own dog, I was not pleased to say the very least.  Well the rest of the folks all returned to their dogs and the exercises finished and she started walking down the line saying passed or failed.  When she got to the dog next to me she failed it, when she got to me she told me that my dog had to do the exercise over after she was done and that she was surprised that my dog had stayed as long as it did with 2 dogs pushing it, then failed the dog on the other side of me.  I still can`t figure out why a judge would let a dog touch another. So many judges enturpret rules their own way in all AKC events.  Personally I think as well their should be an age limit for ALL performance events and probably show too.  I know here comes all the age discrimination advocates, lol.  Oh, and by the way my dog nailed it with a 198!  Good Luck and God Bless|`|zWFJBlJZaa	I know the AKC is busy revamping everything, so I'm not sure what they have done.  Obedience Rules had a dismissal for unruly behavior and all aggression incidents had to be reported on a special form to the AKC by the Show Secretary and if necessary a Show Trial Committee could be convened for any infractions that happened at the event.  If they have eliminated it from the Lure Coursing Rules they may have kept it in the General Rules for running an event or they may have left it in the hands of the exhibitors to ban together and file charges against the offending animal/owner team, which can lead to suspension of their privileges to show for 6 months to infinity.|`|qioH81tiaa	AFAIK, a dog at an agility trail can be dismissed, and ultimately banned, for disruptive or dangerous behaviour.  I'm more familiar with AAC agility, but there are rules in place to deal with things like that.      I can't see why they would take a rule like that out...
RN1wGlWWaa	If she is spayed, then you can keep them together.  But keep in mind he might be aggressive to her until he's neutered.  He will still have hormones for about 2 months after being neutered.|`|AA10091923	great question.    Yes they can be together....she cannot get pregnant and she is up to date on her shots.  he, i assume, has no diseases...and cannot get her pregnant...so you are totally good and since they will be housemates..they will need to learn to tolerate each other as soon as possible.    again, great question...good luck  :)|`|djLDZXoZaa	no, they should be fine together.  then they can become friends!|`|lTsDwY9Paa	Yes you can keep them together. The sooner they get to know each other the better.|`|5mpuacV0aa	Be sure to ask your vet. Does the male cat have any diseases?  Do they need to be quarantined until he gets neutered?  If he doesn't have his shots, perhaps they do.  You didn't give much information, so I can't tell you exactly what to do for sure.     Sometimes a male may abuse a female if the male cat isn't neutered yet.     To be on the safe side, keep them separated until you talk to your vet.      Have fun with your kittens and best wishes for their health!|`|8881wS3kaa	no no.. they have to go there own way..to be away from sibling. make it there own.. tidythat|`|FDZNJXxcaa	nope as long as one if fixed there shouldn't be a problem unless they have some initial personality issues, which unless they continue or get heated should be fine|`|iYI5TXCMaa	yes definatly.  unless they have any disease, but you should be ok in that aspect.  the male may be aggressive at first, but you will want them to get familiarlized with each other as soon as possible.|`|Y1nBbASUaa	keep them together they will have friends!|`|AA11580836	Im not sure but I would think it would be alright. Are they siblings or just separate kittens you have? I think either way it should be alright and they would probably end up being "friends" I guess you can say and will play when they are bored. I have an uncle who has 2 cats, one is alot older then the other and they are both girls but they play and run around and dont really fight.|`|6be65543422b4937c27d1761a2ed50a0aa	There's no reason to keep them separated.......Your male isn't going to be able to impregnate the spayed female.    You need to be aware.......when you bring the male back home, after being neutered, the female is going to hiss / spit / growl at him, even IF they've gotten along before then.  The strange odors that come from the vet office ( anesthetic, etc ) will make the male's odor unfamiliar to her again.  This will last until the odors go away.      If you take something with his (or her) scent on it, and wipe him down with it before he gets back home, it COULD help........no guarantees, though!    Another thing........while he's getting neutered, go to the pet store and get some BITTER APPLE spray, to spray his incision, so he doesn't try to chew his stitches out.  Also, try to keep him from jumping around for a few days.......and don't try to force him to eat the first night.  Leave water available, but he may not want to eat......he will, when he's ready.    Hope this helps.......Good luck to ALL of you........|`|VFQFTeNKaa	> Yes you can keep them together , they will soon be bffl
qdtU1Q1Laa	If you jump, I'd recommend getting a jumping/close contact saddle and not an all purpose.    EDIT: HDR is a pretty good quality brand. The pony club here has like three of them and they last a long time if you take care of them.    The seat on this one seems pretty deep, but it's best to try the saddle to be sure it's what you want. When I was trying jumping saddles, there was several that I was looking at, but only 1 had a deep seat. When in pictures, it looked like they all did.    Hope this helps.|`|9BwQMXycaa	This saddle is WAYY too cheap and badly built to even be considered.  I would never suggest getting a HDR saddle anyways.  But this one will tip forward on your horse causing you to tip forward as well, and the knee pads are much too forward for any type of low jumping or flat work.  I would save up some money and invest in some quality if I was you.|`|BCZ1ezXMaa	i personally like it.  the seat seems nice to me  and i dont like close contact saddles much either, but i didnt have a choice... but if you are experienced with HDR, then perfect for you!  congrats on the new saddle, and i hope you love it!
HkMhWvtgaa	Personally, I do not buy the whole "always get your pet from a shelter" idea.  It oversimplifies a complex issue.    It is true that businesses do what they do for money.  (Don't we all when we go to work every day?  It's called earning a living.)  They will keep doing what makes them money, and stop doing what loses them money.  If a particular business or type of business is consistently doing something you consider wrong, then by no means should you encourage them to keep doing it.  Don't buy what they're selling, and they'll find something else to sell.    However, this is a very individual decision.  Do not be bullied by the dogma of others into a decision you don't personally believe in.  Maybe you'll decide not to buy a kitten from a commercial breeder or from a store that gets their animals from a breeder.  But does that mean you should never take a kitten from a next door neighbor who happened to wind up with an accidental litter?  No, it doesn't!  Those kittens were going to end up at a shelter eventually, so you are still in a sense "rescuing an animal from death at a shelter."    When you take the "absolutely always adopt from a shelter, and absolutely always spay/neuter" doctrine to its logical conclusion, you are saying that ultimately there should be no domestic cats, and in the time between now and when that ultimate goal is achieved, there should be fewer and fewer cats descended from pets instead of from strays.  Some animal activists really do believe this, because they think that keeping pets is the equivalent of slavery.  I don't.      It's interesting to me that many people are far quicker to apply this hard-line anti-breeding attitude to cats than to dogs, even though the activists apply it to both.  To most people, the desire to have a dog of a specific appearance and temperament is apparently more acceptable than the same desire for a cat.    I think there will always be a place for animals specifically bred and socialized to bond well with a human household.  If you don't think commercial breeders are serving that purpose in a humane, legitimate way, then boycott them and give your business to those who do better.|`|DtkLsetkaa	Buying the kittens from the pet shop encourages the kitten/puppy mills or backyard breeders to keep it up.  Yes, its sad that those kittens are bred the way they are, and its a shame that by boycotting pet stores that sell kittens/puppies that they will not get the best home, but its all kinda part of the bigger picture.  There is just as sweet and loving a kitten waiting in a shelter that would probably make a better pet than the poor inbred kitten in the pet store.  Its all about the greater good i guess, stopping the mills in whatever way we can.|`|gM7VuCM4aa	The kittens in the pet shops will eventually be adopted because somebody will go in there and fall in love with them.|`|CPxmHjx4aa	yea they deserve homes too but the problems with pet shops are that the animals are overpriced and under cared for..  people dont want to buy from a pet store because it keeps them in business but at the same time innocent lives are paying for it..  if the prices were reasonable i would buy from a pet store just to free the lives that are in there..|`|K0uTjeWiaa	The more cats and dogs gotten from pet shops the more that will be born and sold to pet shops to replace the ones gone and the longer the abuses will continue. it has nothing to do with the individual animal   When you get a cat fom a shelter, you are already getting an animal that has been hurt in some way|`|AA10359186	the ONLY way to shut down cat farms and puppy mills is to STOP buying from the pet store - so that the store has to sell the kittens cheap just to get rid of them - this discourages them from selling kittnes in the future    read this link on what happens to pups in stores that dont sell.. the same applies to kittens - its excellent sence    http://www.gomestic.com/Pets/What-Happen...|`|YBcB0732aa	I think they kill them or sell them to research.

They'll give them away or they'll turn them over to a shelter    It is sad that these kittens have to pay the price for the greed of the store and the person who sold them to the store, but when the money is no longer there, they will stop buying them.    it takes financial resources to care for a kitten, so the longer they stay in the shop, the less likely they will be to take kittens in the future.|`|WqGxGJkbaa	Dont breed or buy whilst shelter cats die.|`|ppQ8lqKeaa	Tough as it is, the entire pet breeding industry should be boycotted.     I have a cat that I found starving and unwanted near an apartment complex. He had been neutered much too early so that he could be made saleable. This left him weak in mind and body, defenseless, and unable to take care of himself. Some idiot bought him, decided he was too much trouble, and dumped him.     I have a real problem with people spending money on special breeds of any animals, including dogs, with the exception of companion animals. The owners do it because it gives them status. Then they "trade up," and dump these breeds in shelters.    Meanwhile, beautiful animals shiver in cages, waiting to be gassed.     We know a lot more about the mental lives of animals than we used to, and we know that animals feel a range of emotions, including fear and a sense of abandonment.     There is no more justification for this than there would be for breeding and selling human beings.    Note: I just read Trish's post and I agree with much of it. It is true that if no one buys from a breeder, but only from a shelter, and if animal activists keep spaying and neutering strays, then the pet population could die out. It is also true that behind some of these efforts is an extremist effort to wipe out all  pets.     I'm not at all against pets; domestic cats have to live with people in order to thrive. And I have pondered the end-game here: if everyone adopts either strays (which is what I do) or shelter animals, then new pets won't be bred.     So I would temper the above statement by saying that when it comes to dogs, one should deal directly with reputable breeders.     When it comes to cats, which involve a more plentiful population of abandoned animals, one should still make every effort to adopt strays and cats from shelters.    I don't accept cautions against being bullied into doing the right thing; I think the choice of words there is a problem.     But thanks, Trish; you've made me think.l|`|5RRMLzvzaa	The only way to get a company (such as a puppy mill) to go out of business, is if we stop buying their product.  As long as they are making money, they will keep making their product, which unfortunately are living animals.  That's why we need to stop buying pet store cats and dogs.  When everyone joins together to stop buying a product in order to make something stop, it's called a boycott.    Yeah, the dog is cute and yes it deserves a home, but you know what?  If no one was willing to buy it, then the pet store would be forced to lower its price or send it to a shelter and the dog would be ok in the long run.  Sometimes, though, things need to be drastic in order to make a change, and that could mean that a dog gets euthanized in the process, but in the long run, it will be a good thing.
gM7VuCM4aa	That's really stupid that the shelters won't let you adopt because you live too far away for a home visit. Shame on them depriving a kitty from a good home over something like that! You said you are in Central London so I doubt you have any farms around, but farms often have kittens. They would need to be taken to a vet where as the shelters usually do all the shots, worming, etc. As a last resort maybe you could talk your parents into letting you have the two kitties from the other shelter...did you try crying?|`|AA10359186	typically children are not allowed to adopt - only adults can.    maybe they wont do a home visit but if they have permisson to talk to the vet about the care your last cat received that might work - have your mom call the shelter and ask them what they need if they cannot do a home visit.|`|76cAAPfBaa	Perhaps just tell everybody you know, that you want to adopt a cat or kitten for free. The word will get around, and you might have somebody give you one BEFORE it gets sent to a shelter! That's even better than getting it from the shelter after somebody gives one up!|`|ArBOK95aaa	is there actually a question in this?  Sounds like you are just upset at your circumstances.    I'm sorry you aren't able to fit into the guideline of the shelters.  They are there to protect the animals.  I know it sounds cruel to you since you have a home to offer, but since they can not verify that home, they have no idea what kind of home it is.    what you might want to do is do some web searching on WHY two kittens are better than adopting an only kitten, and present a report to your parents on why you should adopt a pair of kittens.  It really is in the kitten's best interest to have a play mate.  There is a lot of information out there to support this shelter's policy.  Maybe if you take the time to inform yourself then try to help your parents understand you'll be able to get yourself a pair of kittens when they become available in the spring.|`|IpkUUxdNaa	If you are so concerned about it coming from a shelter then why does it have to be a kitten?

Good luck and keep up the good work of trying to find a cat to rescue.  However, don't be blinded to the fact that you want a kitten.  It was dreadful that you lost your other cat to cancer but I am afraid that having a kitten is no guarantee that it will live a long life.  Cats and kittens can die at any age from all sorts of illnesses.  If you adopt a cat of about one or two years of age you will be able to see the cat's personality and how affectionate it is towards you.  The problem with kittens is that you NEVER quite know how they will turn out as they get a bit older.  Think about a slightly older cat - they need your love too and will return it 100 times over.|`|sIcPtOnkaa	i dont know!!!|`|JJ60Ppdvaa	you are a great person to care so much about the cats, but unfortunately it doesnt seem that you have another option.

AA10034577	Angel fish are pretty rough.  I would avoid mixing them.|`|t85b6QMiaa	They live happily when they are young. As there are only slight differences in size.     The problem may occur when the Angelfish grow into a considerable size. And they grow in a fast rate. There is a possibility that the Angelfish can develop an aggressive characteristic, which is normal if he/she is a single species.     You can reduce the possibilities by keeping the Angelfish in pair. And enlarge the size of your Neon Tetra. I'd say at least 10 member will be safer. Of course if you can afford more, it'll be better.      Planting a "high" plant such as amazon sword at the back zone of the aquarium will also help as Angelfish love to stand among them. Let it be an open space in the forward zone of your aquarium, it'll your Tetra shoal "playing ground". A large space will also help in reducing confrontation.    Good Luck to you.|`|Y8MZCLIQaa	Yes, they should be fine. We had a community tropical tank with both and we never had any problems. So long as you get a fair sized school of tetras they'll live happily.|`|ZVYY7nOlaa	The angelfish is still young at that size. Neons are already adults for that size. If the angelfish live with them since its young, I think theres a chance it might work.   I would not choose angelfish. They are aggressive. Neon tetras are their natural prey. You are getting a community tank. There are many more fish you can choose for a community.
wvrgyYoUaa	Every dog's situation varies.  In abuse dogs cases they are perfectly capable of loving a new owner but you have to realize their trust in humans has been broken.  You have to show her.    Always be postivie.  Never slap her or tap her to correct her, she has had too many bad experiences.    Provide lots of food,water, treats.    Try petting her, and showing her you care.    This next one might sound weird, but honestly, it worked.  Been through your scenario.    Lick her on the nose.  To dogs this symbolizes love.    Just try and keep your voice down, violence down and show positive emotions.

However not all blue-eyed or bi-eyes whites are deaf.   They are just statically more likely to be deaf than non-blue eyed cats    Edit:  Albino means they lack any pigment causing the white color and in cats blue eyes).   Not all white cats are the same.  White cats may have the dominant white spotting gene.  The same gene that causes white spotting (ie black and white cats)   has may presentations ranging from just white feet to a cat being totally white.  These cats may have any color eyes.   White cats may also result from the recessive white gene that is part of the siamees series.  Recessive white always have blue eyes.   Albino is a sperate mutation for the other two and is caused by a lack of all pigment.  In cats albinos always have blue eyes.|`|9Mr14w6Qaa	I have a white cat and he's not blind nor does he have two different coloured eyes,so if you see one you like ,go for it.He also isn't deaf.Albino means they are white like an albino rabbit|`|lavd3UHmaa	Deafness.

I think he had just gotten something like a hair in his eye because after I wiped the liquid off his face it didn't water again. Use a tissue with some visine or artificial tears on it in case you get too close to the eye.  Wipe it all off and check it again the next day.  If it is still watering make an appointment with his vet.|`|Umt80GyKaa	here go see a vet . it should be ok .  but steel  go to a vet.|`|iuNV9eOtaa	i have a cat and her eye waters as well and what i do is i just leave it because it's normal and it's some kind of allergy that i was told they can never figure out so it's pretty normal for your cats eyes to water. all it dose is bug your cat that's all.
Ik6WOcw3aa	Hole in the head comes from either feeding disease ridden feeder fish, or just simply not changing the water enough.    CHange about 35% of the water right now, and change another 35% tomorrow. And ASAP go to the petstore and see if they have any antibiotics for HITH.    Also, this is commonly associated with a tank being too small. A single oscar should have 55 gallons minimum, with no tankmates. A 75 gallon would be much preferable.|`|qJlZjzjWaa	as mean as it sounds i usually euthinize(butchered the spelling) the fish.  i don't like risking disease for other fish and its probably suffering.  by the way you are describing how he is, it seems like he is going to die shortly. get a small bucket of cold water and he won't feel a thing. i hate doing it but if its a contagious disease i personally don't think its worth the trouble.

It's best not to force the bird to do anything it's not ready to, that can lead to set backs.      Just leave the door to the cage open, and let the bird come out on it's own time. Lovebirds are extremely nosy little busybodies, sooner or later the bird will want to know what's going on and make it's way out. (If you don't want the bird all over the room clip it's wings)|`|7W8mw4qoaa	awww :p I got my lovebird when he was a baby, but the first few days he was here he just stayed at the bottom of the cage and really only moved when he wanted to eat or drink... but then after that he was fine, so honestly, I think that your bird just isnt used to her new place yet, but I think if you give her a few days, maybe even a week or so, she'll feel more comfortable around you and be more sure about her surroundings :)    oh and also, since your bird hasnt really been handled that much, spend a lot of time with her even if she's in the cage, just like sit next to the cage and give her a lot of attention, she clearly isnt really used to people yet, but that should make her trust and love you more :3|`|nFtOkcDuaa	well i may have never owned a bird but i helped one of my friends take care of hers. birds can be super shy when you first get them and they grow out of it as soon as they feel safe and comfortable in their environment.  and as for a name you could it misty/mist or mystic. and if you'd like a misnomer  you could name her bird brain! lol. don't that'd be the slightest bit cruel.  good luck! she sounds beautiful by the way.|`|YDoUcocqaa	Ciar (KEE-ar) is a good female Irish name.

How I'm doing it is I'm just leaving the door open while I'm in the room doing stuff. They eventually get curious and come out on their own when they're ready. For the first while it's best to ignore the bird while it's exploring.  Be sure you have a way to catch the bird so you can put it back in it's cage. Also, it helps if you have a command you say while trying to get your bird back into the cage. My command is "bedtime" so Luna knows that it's time to go back and if she doesn't run away, I don't chase her.
9BwQMXycaa	for the sizing, stuubens are actually SMALLER than any other brand.  So keep that in mind.  I got my thoroughbred (narrow) a 32...and it was tight on her.    I wouldn't say they are good for EXTREMELY high withered horses.  They are not cut back at all.    No.  The Juventus S only comes in that color.

But I've been trying to sell my stuuben for a while now.  People just don't seem to be interested in them anymore.    hope i've helped|`|FN5mv4L5aa	Stubbens are top  of the line German saddles and like jeans, saddles of the same "size" are measured differently.    Stubbens range 27cm-32cm with custom extra wides over 32cm.  31 is actually a Medium Wide, 28 would be narrow.  I would recommend you contact Stubben for a saddle fitting.    Without saddle fitting, I would suggest that if you have a high withered TB that is normal shoulder then your going to need a 28cm Stubben.  If its a bull dog TB then go with a 29.  We have about 70 thoroughbreds at our boarding ranch and they all ride just fine in teh 28cm and 29cm pending the overall build of the horse (wider in the 29, narrower in the 28).    I have custom Stubbens for my horses and the 28 fits both my TB with high withers (2 finger clear) and my petite mustang with normal withers(3 finger clear).    used Stubben saddles in Los Angeles sell in the $1000 range at consignment shops.  You'll never get full value at auction (like eBay) for a stubben.  These saddles are highly used in the Fox Hunting clubs and the most common size for hunting is a special order 28cm (USA usally only stocks 30-32cm Stubbens).    Hope this helps.

We found out that she was allergic to something in the carpet, and it irritated her skin enough to make her fur fall out. I put a towel on her favorite spot to sit, and sure enough within a month she'd grown all that fur back (fur that had not been there for YEARS!).    As for the back of the neck and between his shoulders, if he's acting normally (that is, he's still eating and happy as a clam), then I would assume he's been rubbing the back of his head and shoulders against something that's irritating his skin. Since he's an outdoor cat, I wouldn't even begin to wonder if this wasn't a wooden fence or deck that he likes to squeeze himself under.    Next time you let him out, check out where he goes - if you do see him squishing himself under something that you can control, put another material there for him to rub against, even if it's a bit of plastic tarp or canvas, and see if that doesn't help him out.
kUYRnmRRaa	No, you shouldn't be cooping a 6-month old up in a cage for this long, unless it is only a temporary fix for a chewing problem or something when you're out of the house.  If this is a permanent situation, then that's a pretty poor quality of life.  Dogs are very energetic animals and need to be "free range" pets, as well as having a daily exercise session.    You also need to feed your dog at least twice a day.  Even if he is eating the same amount of food, it is not healthy for him to have to fill up his food quota for the day all at one time.    This isn't something you should let slide.  Dogs are demanding pets, and you need to be prepared to meet their needs.  The environment you've just described isn't good enough for a dog to be happy and healthy in.    At least give a room to spend the day in if he must be confined daily.|`|I12oUQZPaa	Feed at least 2 times a day with healthy treats as needed. Read the dog food package for weight & feeding suggestions. Make sure he's getting enough fresh water so he doesn't dehydrate.     Highly recommend a walk & quality playtime with you prior to crating & also when you return home.  When you are home, leave him out of it.  Days you do not need to keep puppers in the crate this long, due to work or school, etc, leave him out of it.  Another idea, if you are away for longer periods of time, can you have a trusted friend or relative stop over to take him outside for you real quick?|`|tPGxPDvBaa	Crate time isn't bad but he does need plenty of exercise.  Feeding twice a day with small meals is healthy & easier on their digestive system.|`|O545aSKWaa	Do you leave the food out? How much are you feeding him?

Sounds like he's doing great :)|`|L22hVXTIaa	Small dogs especially really do better with two smaller feedings a day.  And 7 hours in a crate (other than at night to sleep) seems like quite a bit.

As long as your dogs is getting adequate exercise when you are home crating him for 6-7 hours is ok if her can hold his bladder/ bowels for that long (which he may not at 6 months).  You could hire someone to let him out midday if it bothers you.    You should feed that puppy in two meals not one at 6 months, especially with a small dog.|`|Y8MZCLIQaa	He needs to be fed at least twice a day. Especially at so young. He'll be hungry for most of the day otherwise and only feeding him once redcuces his metabolism which can cause him to gain excess weight. As long as he gets to spend plenty of time with you and gets lots of exercise he should be fine. And make sure he has plenty of toys and water in his cage.|`|gypCmdWqaa	HES A PUPPY HE NEEDS TO EAT AT LEAST TWICE A DAY ( ONCE ARE YOU KIDDING)  AND THAT'S WRONG TO KEEP A PUPPY IN A PRISON HE NEEDS A LOT OF ATTENTION IF YOU CANT GIVE HIM THAT  GIVE HIM TO A LOVING FAMILY THAT WILL|`|3funFya2aa	I feed my dogs in the morning or around noon and then in the evening when I have dinner.. keeps them from begging.     If you're at home with the dog, you shouldn't keep him cooped up in a crate. Crates should be kept strictly for bedtime and bad behavior.    My sister's old room mate kept her dog locked in a crate 3/4 of the time since she bought him. He was miserable in his crate, and when you let him out, he peed everywhere from being so excited that he was being let out. And then had such a horrible time trying to potty train him to do his business outdoors.

ZT0K3q2Aaa	Maybe some bone, pieces splintered in her throat. Or her throat could be really sore, and she doesnt want to eat because of it. If she doesnt eat for more than 2 days, i suggest bringing her back to the vet to get an x ray, to see if there might be splintered bones stuck somewhere. Also, Make sure your dog is kept hydrated. Remember, some dogs have been known to starve to death because they cant eat, from splintered pieces of bone stuck in their throat.|`|uVgqDlrcaa	Haha, chicken bones splinter inside dogs and cause bleeding.    She probably still has a splinter insider her and is uncomfortable to eat.   Or, just wait and leave the dog food out.

She might be more inclined to drink the broth than eat solids. If she does drink the broth she will probably start eating tiny pieces of chicken.  The broth will help to restore her appetite.|`|3c0ad1411f70d3bd5b671e71cde1c60eaa	Her stomach is probably just overly sensitive right now so I wouldn't worry about it, but if she still won't eat tommorrow I would call the vet.

It is possible to keep 2, but they might feel over-crowded, and you will have to change water more frequently.    If you want multiple colorful fish, get small tropical fish, like tetras or guppies. You'd be able to have 1 or 2 other medium-sized fish, but you'd have to make sure they were compatible with the guppies or tetras.    If you get tropical fish, you will probably need a water heater, unless the room they stay in is very very warm.  I don't know too much about tropical fish, I would suggest you do some research on your own.    My father was given a 5 gallon aquarium and wanted goldfish. I told him it was a terrible idea because they need so much space. So he is going to get tetras.    If you want just one or two goldfish, they make great pets. In my experience they are more intelligent than most tropical fish, and have tons of personality. But if you just like watching beautiful fish swim around in a school and something that will require less maintenance, I would go with tetras or guppies.    on a final note: Do some research on a fishless nitrogen cycle. You can better and more quickly set up the bacteria that break down waste in a tank before you actually add the fish to the tank. it will take about 3 weeks. This way the fish won't have to deal with the toxic ammonia and nitrite when you add them.|`|1iGp2etEaa	Guppies, Bubble-eyed goldfish, and Mollies|`|EoVEOR5iaa	Guppys, neon fish, algy eater  hope this helps|`|7JS2gfR7aa	The best thing to do would be to get 2 regular goldfish. Fancy goldfish are fine as long as you make sure to feed them a diet that consists of at least 60% vegetable matter. I recommend feeding canned peas. Fancy goldfish can suffer from swim bladder disorder if fed dry floating foods. All  in all, a regular goldfish will not need to eat as many veggies, but fancy goldfish will. In my opinion, get 2 regular goldfish. When I was a beginner aquarist, and I got 2 fancy goldfish, and while I have the swim bladder under control, the common goldfish will be much easier to take care for you. (Since you are a Newbie) If you decide to get the 2 common goldfish, feed a diet of dry flakes and pellets.     Good Luck
Ik6WOcw3aa	You dont really have a school. Get a few more. Even then, danios are loose schoolers. They wont school as tightly as most tetras, instead, they will just hang out in the general area of each other.|`|sSSpRtD2aa	you will need a few more if you want them to school more|`|t85b6QMiaa	I have an experience with this species before and are still learning their behaviour. Zebra Danio should be kept in a school consisting at least 5 member.  And I agree that they are a loose school, which I hate in schooling fish. In my personal opinion, a close-tight formation is what made schooling fish wonderful.    They may be in loose school due to the reason that they feel secure. Other species, such as Neon Tetra, kept in close formation because of their size and the feeling of insecurity.     I am planning to keep them in larger aquarium with a pair of Angelfish. Yes, Angelfish can be aggressive but they are not a predatory either. Maybe this will help the Zebra in its formation.|`|2kjGc7xvaa	Danios won't school they shoal. A shoal is a group of fish that stay in one general area together, a school is a synchronized shoal. A 20 gal tank is not huge so it won't be as apparent that they are staying near each other.|`|klbvBgU7aa	Dude, I have 10 zebras in my 30 gallon tank, and I honestly have not seen them school together since I put them in there. I've heard that since they don't school it means they're comfortable in the tank. Mine swim and play a lot but never in tight schools, often times not even all of them playing the same game of chase. I've personally come to the conclusion that they may like to have the company of more danios, but they aren't necessarily "schooling fish" in the sense they are always in a tight group.
26PPwzrWaa	Only 10.5 weeks, you must be expecting miracles.     Puppies need constant attention which you are not giving her.   Take her to a puppy kindergarten class to allow her to play.     And if you are working more than 30 minutes a day, and letting her stay in her crate, she will not hold, she will have to go because her bladder is not strong enough to hold it.      She doesnt have that control yet. She should be going out every 30 minutes. Min.     And if she goes outside, praise, reward with treats.   When you come inside, tether her to you and in 5 minutes, go back out and say the keyword.   If you catch her going, growl(puppies understand a growl, not a No.)    www.flyingdogpress.com can tell you almost what it takes to raise a puupy. (free articles)|`|t9Fxx75uaa	First of all, you got your pup too young.  You shouldn't have had her til at least 8-10 weeks old so she is going to have some social problems.  That being said, 10.5 weeks is WAYYYYYY To young to expect much from a puppy.  That is like asking a 4 month old baby to be potty trained.  It aint gonna happen.  You need to let her out more often (at least twice before work, then at lunch then every half hour while you are home....yes every half hour.  You are expecting way to much from this poor puppy.  I know it is your first puppy but this can take months especially if you got her too young, which you did.  She will get it but don't think it will happen fast, maybe by 6 months old, she can be relatively accident free.  I have had dogs my whole life and some learn faster than others but yours started out too young to be away from mom and sibs so you have extra problems.  Just be patient and positive rewards all the time. Do not ever scold or yell or hit your puppy unless you want her to fear you and hate you.  I wish you lots of luck.....why don't you ask that trainer who told you this was ok to do how to potty train?|`|3c0ad1411f70d3bd5b671e71cde1c60eaa	She's way to young to expect much more from her.  The best thing to do is to put her leash on her when you are in the house.  Tie her to your belt loop and have her go EVERYWHERE with you.  At the first hint of her needing to use the bathroom take her outside immediately (saying her "cue" word all the way to the door--we say "outside") and don't come in until she goes.  At her age she needs to be taken out 10 minutes after eating/drinking and immediately after playing or waking up.  Use an enzyme clener to clean your carpets, that way she will not be attracted back to the smell.|`|JCTEMzTzaa	instead of just showing her what she is doing wrong by spanking her and saying no, when she does potty or poo outside you should reward her with a small treat. then she will think when she goes outside she gets rewarded rather then going in the house and getting in trouble. i have to small puppies and have been able to potty train them successfully doing this. best of luck to you with you puppy!|`|xqU1N1VBaa	dont worry your doing quite well. your pup is just 10 weeks old, your child was in diapers from like birth until three.     what worked best for me was taking my pups out around 15-20 minutes after they eat. they are like clock work. for the messes in the house i would bring them outside so they would have the smell to go for.    you can buy puppy spray, people use them for paper training but it works well outside, just spray it where you want your pup to go.    it takes a lot of work and you need to be ready look for the signs, my dog gets a weird walk when she has to go number two. they may start sniffing around or act real antsy this is when you have to rush her outside.    i know it sounds gross but in the middle of when shes going try to pick her up and run her outside. as soon as the mess hits the ground praise her like she just gave you a million treats love petting anything you can think of. act like its the best thing ever!    she might be messing in her crate if its too large, since shes a pup and will be growing you dont want to buy a bunch of crates, you can put a block in the back to make it smaller. that will give her less reason to mess.|`|ymbGBJDxaa	LOL.  First of all calm down almost everyone goes through this.  I have a english bulldog 4 months old and I had the same problem.  Try this as soon as you wake up take the dog out when it comes back in feed it but give it very little water.  A dog at 11 weeks old can only hold bladder for about 4 to 5 hrs after that its really pushing it.  As they get old they develop more and it's easier for them to hold it.  My bully just started being able to hold it.  Keep in mind the puppy is a baby and trying to learn it will have accidents.  Take the dog out the same door to the same spot in the yard every single time and when the dog gets ready to go potty say "go potty" and when they do praise the hell out them like they justed saved the world.  My dog took a while but he knows he does good when he goes outside cause I always let him know when he went potty outside he did good now i say good potty and he jets for the house cause he knows he gets rewarded with treat or play time with me.  Keep dog on scheldule as far as eating the dog should go out 10 minutes after it has eating and drank.  If you take dog out the same door all the time the begin to understand that they need to go to that door to go outside.  Crate training is the best way.  Just remember to take puppy out when you think they might need to go that is crucial the less the have accidents the quicker they understand house is house and yard is potty.  Always say when going out lets go potty, then go potty, then good "dog's name" good potty.  Be consistent.  Your get it and so will you dog.  Also be sure to clean all accidents with amonia free cleaner cause it main chemical is a chemical in urine.  Try resolve for pets.  Clean spots very good cause they will go to same spot until it's cleaned.  Your be fine give this a go for a couple weeks.  Remember praise everytime dog goes outside let them know thats good.  Good luck|`|ORe8qdtTaa	http://www.dogsey.com/dog-articles.php?t...    Firstly read it - it will help!    Secondly chill out you have a puppy - she is a baby and good on you for realising it - just keep that in your mind.  This is not going to be a quick fix but takes time and patience and you have to have lots of both bt YOU CAN DO IT!    What training are you doing now?  How much time do you get with her to do potty training?  It takes time hon and you will get there but be  kind and patient and realise that this is a baby and gently does it.    Bear with it - it will get better|`|m57ylQ03aa	You have some very good advise here in the previous posts.  How big is her crate?   If it is too big she will use it to potty,   If it is huge, either give her a pad at one end to use for potty and a blanket at the other to sleep on or make it small enough she can only stand and turn around in.    follow the advise given here, they are all right on. But you must keep it up.  Use the treats at first or use a word or clap your hands and say Tinkle, Tinkle, when they finish,  Always praise and give reward, whether you pet them or treat them.  And the leash is a good thing when you can't watch her in the house. keep her tied to your belt, but first and foremost take her out often.  And praise when she does what you want. Never yell at her in the house if you didn't see her do it.  Your on the right path.  Don't give up.|`|gf6Xtyc5aa	i crate traind my to goldens you have to have a divider in the crate so there is just enough room for her to lay down. if there is alot of room she will go potty in the back and lay in the front. it took my dogs about a week or 2. i say lets do big boys they run to the back door wen they come in pet them on the head and praise them say good girl and give her eye contact thats really important.|`|2c844fcf526bc2b90f16b7c425e11aa7aa	At 10 weeks she does not yet have control of her bowels or bladder, just as a human baby has no control.  She won't have control for another few weeks yet so you need to keep an eye on her.     How long is she in the crate during the day?  She's not is in there all day while you are at work is she?  If she is, she has no option but to pee in the crate.  She needs to be taken outside every couple of hours.  People say a pup can hold it for one month more than their age i.e. at 2 months, they can hold it for 3 hours.  I've not found that to be the case because every pup is not the same.    Now that you know she needs to eliminate twice, put her in the crate after she's eliminated outside and then take her out again 10 minutes later.  Many dogs need to go twice to empty out.  Since she is already obliging when you take her outside means you are getting there with her.  You're not doing anything wrong, it's frustrating and seems to take forever but you're on the right track.    To protect the carpet confine her with baby gates to rooms that have tiled floors until she is reliably house trained.    If you are watching TV and relaxing rather than running around doing housework you could leash the pup to you so you can watch her.|`|0I9Fm00Naa	The dog trainer was right generally they will not soil their sleeping area. First thing in the morning when you let her out to go , you should be going outside with her and praise her when she doe's go. Constancy is the key . Watch her closely when she is in the house ,when she starts sniffing around with her nose to the ground is a good indication that she has to go.Take her outside immediately and encourage her , When she doe's Praise, Praise, Praise, Make a big deal out of the fact that she did it outside. she will soon learn that its good to go potty outside, If you catch her inside and she is starting to go shout at her "NO" loud enought to startle her and again take her outside , encourage her and again Praise, Praise, Praise, when she does. If you found she had an accident on the floor just clean it up as if nothing happened at all, If you punish her after the fact she will not be able to associate the punishment with the cause.Never slap her or holler at her out of anger, if you do you will have an animal that will be afraid to come to you because she already knows what she is in for .  If your having negative problems with her like chewing something she should not be put her in the cage and alway have some rawhide chew bones for her so she knows what she can chew and what she cannot.  Dont use the cage as a form of punishment she should be able to see the cage as a place of security for her ( thats her space) Consistancy is the key and lot's of praise for good behavior but always discourage bad behavior in a non-abusive manner and you will have a happy well behaved dog in the future.|`|EeJMITyCaa	I guess the trainer didn't tell you that since she is 10 weeks old she can't stay in her crate for more than 2 hours without going on herself. The general rule is that how ever many months she is is how long she can hold it. So she is 10 weeks which is 2 months and some change so she can only hold it for 2 hours so basically you're just teaching your dog to be a dirty dog because she's in the crate thinking "I HAVE TO GO AND I CAN"T HOLD IT ANYMORE" then she goes. Then she probably screams bloody murder trying to get you to  come get her away from her poo and pee. Eventually after days of pooing in her crate that his i routine and doesn't even hesitate to poo and  pee in the cratee and all her instinct of keeping her cage clean are lost. If I were you I'd find one of those training camps where you drop you dog off and then they train it to do basic commands and to either be litter box trained or to go outside since you are so busy.|`|bMYv0fBHaa	She just needs a bit more patience. Take her out more than just twice--take her out as often as possible. If you work long hours, you'll want to see if someone can do this for you, as she's at the age where she can only hold it for about 3 hours or so.    When you take her out, walk her around-that will stimulate her to go--and praise heavily when she does go. Treat if you must in the beginning, but eventually wean her off  of treats (for this purpose) and rely on praise. Do not let her in until she has gone.    If she goes in the house (and you catch her) say "no" firmly, then set her outside and ignore her. If she happens to continue pottying outside, or she goes outside after you put her outside, praise again. If you do not catch her in the act, don't do anything--just ignore, or she won't understand.    You may also want to heavily clean your carpets, as the smell of what she has done before may encourage her to continue going in the same spot.|`|1FPpglMpaa	oh honey, she is still a baby and the amount of time you are training is still very short.   She is getting it, just not completely yet.  dogs aren't considered fully trained until they haven't had an accident for 6 months so you have plenty of time..Please don't yell at her  or she'll just learn to hide and poop/pee without you seeing.   It is good that she is still having accidents in front of you and not hiding.    How long is she in her crate for?  puppies can only hold for the the amount of months they are plus one so for your dog she is good for about 3 hrs without a break.  she should also have just enough room in the crate to stand up and turn around.    Please be patient.

The shelter is a sad sad place to see any dog, especially the puppies :-(|`|JCTEMzTzaa	you can invest in some doggy diapers from petsmart or petco. once you have one you can use women's pantyliners and cut them in half and just put a half in the diaper for her. that way its easy to clean because normally dogs don't have a heavy one. definitely keep an eye on her and keep her away from any males. dogs heat time normally lasts a couple months so mark the time on your calendar and be prepared when it comes so you don't have to worry about it getting everywhere in your house. Good luck!  also you might want to consider getting her spayed if you are not going to breed her.|`|itHpeoFNaa	Get her spayed.  There are far too many unwanted puppies at our shelters and homeless animals in the world.|`|YdI0TLczaa	There is not much to do. Most dogs clean up after themselves pretty well. If your's doesn't, buy some dog seasonals. Some have replaceable pads that go in them, others are completely disposable. Do not let her go outside to do her business alone. Walk her on a leash. She will probably want to spray here, and there, and here and there. LOL Carry a spray bottle filled with water and set it on stream so that if a male dog comes around, you can spray him right in the face. It is a nuisance. If you don't want to go through it again, Spay, spay, spay. Also, my vet said the earlier a dog is spayed, the less likely they are to get mammary cancer.|`|om4Szik7aa	Well, some dogs are messy while others are not. My German Shepherd keeps herself clean, and very rarely do I see a spot of blood on the floor. I would give her extra affection during these times, and nourishment as well. If you let her outside, make sure she is on leash with you, as a male dog will find her ASAP and then there could be a problem if your not wanting puppies. She will bleed from 2-3 weeks. Mine usually does for 2 weeks or so, but they can still get pregnant after bleeding. So as a precaution, keep a good watch on her for around 4 weeks. Depending on the dog, they will go into heat 2-3 times a year. Once every 6 months, or once every 4 months (which Is in the case of my dog). If your wanting to spay her, do so after she is over her heat. If you don't want her spayed right now, keep track of her start day and make sure you know when she will begin again. Good luck!!|`|syT3XUAraa	DO NOT, I repeat, DO NOT GET HER SPAYED WHILE IN HEAT!!!! When a dog is in heat, the blood vessels in her uterus are swollen with blood, and spaying increases her chances of hemorrhaging and bleeding to death. I know someone who lost their dog in a case like that. Right now, just keep her far away from any males, and spay her about two weeks after she comes out of heat. If her discharge is really heavy, you can buy her a dog diaper. Some info on dogs in heat: http://www.howtodothings.com/pets-animal...  http://www.dogchatforum.com/dog_in_heat....|`|RN1wGlWWaa	Keep her away from any unneutered male.

NnYB9eXiaa	Hi :)    How long have you had her?  If it's only been a little while, she's probably still getting used to you.  Dwarfs, by nature, are more skittish, but once she's used to you she'll calm down some.  I'm going to give you some help here, it addresses biting, but it's also the proper way to handle her that will calm her down some :)    Remember to never wake your hamster up to play! They'll be calmer if they've been running in their wheel for a while as well, and lastly, just like a human -- they may not be in the mood to play some days!    1. Wash your hands carefully with a non-fruity or heavily scented soap - this will keep them from wanting to taste, and possibly bite your hand.  Others may advise you to wear gloves - this prevents the hamster from learning your scent, and you want them to know YOU when you're handling them, not the smells on a glove.    2. NEVER reach into the hamster cage and try to *grab* your hamster. Hamsters are quite protective of their homes and will try to defend them (aka bite you or flip over and scream -- which is a defense mechanism). Females tend to be more "cage aggressive" than males, although with time and patience, this will diminish with either one.    3. Hold a small cup or bowl in front of the cage door with a yummy treat in it - the hamster will crawl in almost every time.    4. Slide the lil guy out of the cup/bowl into your hand - and voila! You're holding your hamster and haven't been bitten!    Be careful as they will be a bit skittish (and dwarfs are little speed demons so it may try to run up your arm). Of course you'll want to be sure to be extra gentle as they are still animals and can bite when they get scared!  They may also lick/nibble your fingers, don't mistake this for biting, it just means they're curious.  Nibbling tickles - biting hurts ;)    Once your hamster gets more accustomed to you and how you smell, you'll be able to skip step 3 and they'll crawl right into your hand.    Best of luck - and have patience    Please feel free to send me a message if you need any more advice :)    Daisy|`|lc2WYfeTaa	Get one of those plastic balls and put her in it and let her run around the house they love it and still feel secure!!|`|cav0EBSWaa	well give her lots of exercise so then she becomes really tired then she will sleep in her cage and if u have a hamster wheel put her in that because that will make her tired as well|`|nO8HvYwCaa	I have been handling and owning hamsters for all my life. Here is what you should do:    Put a hamster wheel in its cage. It will love the exercise with being in its own home.    Build a small area with walls. (ex: use books, boxes, pillows) Place your pet down in the area. Gently pet it. Also, place some little hide-outs for him/her. Then take them out. Place a piece of food in the area away from the hamster and encourage it to scope the area.     I hope this helps.|`|moVaAmB6aa	Thats normal, i am vet assistant/ petco animal specialist. If staying in her enviroment keeps her happy, why not let her stay in there? And continue to clean the cage and all and care for her, just relax on the idea of having her out. Not all hamsters feel safe being out in the open and out of their typical enviroment!
9UttDvcsaa	I don't know how old your brother is but he needs to have some authority with the dog.  The dog may be treating him a lower pack member.  Teach your brother some commands you have taught your dog and have him take him on a walk without you.  He needs to do somethings with this dog alone.  Even a 20 minute walk a day without anyone but him and the dog will create a working relationship that will blossom into at least an understanding and hopefully a friendship.  Your brother must stay consistant with the commands given and do not interfere when he is working with the dog or the dog will see you as the ultimate leader and your brother as a lower member.  The goal is that the dog respects your brother.  Some dogs are just very 1 person oriented.  Your dog probably sees your dad as an authority over you and he accepted that.  He needs to see your brother as one notch above him.  Good luck and remember consistency is key.  If your brother gets snapped at, it is best that behavior is ignored but have him get the leash and go for a positive training session.|`|26PPwzrWaa	Little brother: How little?     Growling is good. You want that warning before a bite.     Yes, he is giving your little brother warnings that all of you are ignoring.     Training doesnt fix aggression if someone is being rude.     Describe what your brother is doing when he snaps?     My tip:   Learn Dog Behavior:   www.flyingdogpress.com(free articles)|`|gypCmdWqaa	yes, go sing him up for obedience classes  and have the family take turns taking him and everybody be persistent with training him|`|gf6Xtyc5aa	try finding a toy he loves thats what helped my dog hes a golden he loves toys so wenever he barks a toy is in his mouth. dont worry he had a tough life in a shelter and he barks cause thats what all the other dogs did he learned from them now he has to learn from you. it takes time he will be better in a week or so. tell your brother to play tug a war with him.    hope i helped|`|ymbGBJDxaa	Getting a dog that is older is tough cause they may have bad history as far as owners.  They make mussels for dogs only use when dog tries to bite or become aggresive and say no bad no no no.  When they settle down take it off.  Also try to have brother be around dog more and walk it and feed dog and water it and play with it.  Dog's respect those they know they need.  They are dependent on us  and if your brother walk him and plays with him he will be more comfortable.  If it makes brother nervous get dog to where mussel during there time together.  I promise you it will work try it out.|`|JCTEMzTzaa	you might want to try getting a muzzle for him just temporarily while you try to get your puppy accustomed to your family and your little brother. just to be safe ya know. also obedience school is great for that kind of behavior. hope this helps.|`|QbRpryXJaa	alright my dog used to do that to my friend she'd snap at him over and over... just a little at a time once a day, have your brother get used to the dog, let him know your brother isn't a bad person, that he's family. let me know if it works
2kjGc7xvaa	Algae....light increases algae production....reduce the time the light is on.|`|45Cbtd7raa	thats algae|`|pjrPYAasaa	it sound like alge...even though U have a filter, U still have to clean it the old fashion way to get rid of scum, alge, and water build up...use scrubbing bubbles cleaner...|`|FBupIlwEaa	EW i think that its algae    hope this helped|`|uJJfco2Iaa	Its algae. Algae grows anywhere where theres light. Scrub it off or it will eventually overcome your tank and make your water have less oxygen. If your too lazy to get it off. Buy a algae eater (a pleco is a really good one) Snails on the other hand arent so good. They tend to make swirls on the algae.
xoXkHOVsaa	Do you live in the united states?  If so then you don't need a license as far as I know.  They sell them in many pet stores.  If you are importing one from Australia you need to look up the laws in your state.      If you live in Australia you will need a license.  Check out the links below for more information.|`|8395f464f951baf847594ae5b8585b9aaa	they sell them at the nut house|`|bc5LZrsAaa	You need to contact the Environmental Protection Agency in your state. They will send you all the necessary paperwork. It will cost you a small fee to get your licence but is valid for a few years. Good Luck
9759e8014743debd3d3fd1a7ad437c1faa	Maybe some fish can. These would be (1) Saltwater fish, and (2) Those fish species that walk around on land.    Freshwater fish never drink, because they absorb water all the time. Saltwater fish drink pretty much all the time, so maybe you could say they're perpetually thirsty, but all they need to do is open their mouths, since they're already underwater.    Another category might be fish that actually leave the water for periods of time. This group includes the Climbing Perch and the Mud Skippers, among others. Since they spend time out of (but near) the water, maybe they can get thirsty.|`|m1oaS5Xpaa	I believe the plural to 'fish' is.....'FISH' not freaking fishes!   Ingles es muy bueno. Hablas ingles!!!|`|ZJsjD4JHaa	well i know they do need water so without it going through there gills they'll die so yea i guess|`|qusKbEmBaa	no, they live in water they never get thrist. but they can drown from too much water, it is possible for fishes to drown. but to answer your question NO fishes dont get thirsty. hope i helped.  ( i need the points so i was wondering if you can vote me as best answer. thanks)|`|fDCY1iX7aa	they do.Salt water fish drink seawater and filter the salt out through their gills|`|g2I2C68waa	i dont think they do|`|0muoNffmaa	fresh water fish are never thirsty because  the water always goes in and out of there bodies.     but saltwater fish get thirsty because they have to remove the salt from the water before they drink it.
8GDd6lrnaa	yes, very sharp one too. we had a squirrel monkey, he could bite and pinch real good. he would pinch the cows noses to get them out of the trough so he could get the sweet grain. i saw him bring one down to her knees by just pinching inside her nostril.|`|u3Hdoeiqaa	New world primates (like marmosets and tamarins) have claws. Old world primates (like macaques) and the great apes, all have fingernails like humans.    They will all use their nails/claws and/or teeth to get into their fruit.|`|g2I2C68waa	i think some have them|`|Gp80Zkbwaa	I don't think they do. They open bananas with there teeth.
oDVx7nSxaa	It sounds as though you have a cat that might do well in the Household Pet classes.  It's all about two things:  grooming and "presence".   If he can suck up to the judge, he'll be a big hit.  The next time there is a cat show near you (there is a calender on both the CFA and TICA web sites), go and watch the judging of the HHP classes.  It will give you a good idea of what the judges are looking for, and what wins.|`|gM7VuCM4aa	It depends on what cat show you go to. Since he is not a pedigreed cat he would not be entered in champion class he would be in HHP (household pet) class. The cats in champion class are judged against a pre-written breed standard for their breed and it's very competitive. Cats in HHP are judged more on their overall health/condition and personality verses a breed standard. The HHP class is a lot for laid back. They can still get ribbons and such in HHP. I've attached links below to two of the top cat registries that have regular shows, TICA and CFA. These websites will also give you information on registering for shows etc. Have fun, cat shows are a lot of fun!|`|RN1wGlWWaa	I show cats (pedigree and mixed).  In the household cat class, the judges basically look for a clean cat (bathed, eyes/ears clean and groomed very well).  Then they look for proper weight for the size (not too fat or too thin).  Then they look for personality.      How friendly is the cat?  What is the color (calicos are flashy cats), how playful are they with the judges toys?  They do understand that most cats have never been shown and may be shy - that does NOT count against your cat.    If your cat is over 8 months - he has to be neutered and cannot be declawed to be shown.  If you want more info on showing, check out the associations and pick a local show to put him in.  My first cat was a blue (grey) tabby and white and he got a lot of ribbons being shown :)    http://www.acfacat.com/show_schedule.htm    http://www.cfa.org/shows.html    BTW I was a household pet judge in ACFA, so I also have judging experience.|`|K1oOQqqVaa	Google cat show judging.  Ahhhhh Google - such a wonderful thing if you know how to use it...|`|OTxCCXa5aa	Don't you have to have a pedigree cat to enter a show, the same as with dogs?! since they judge the animal by the breed standard.|`|Umt80GyKaa	google ?????|`|qQ8fr8tYaa	He sounds fit, can I have him for my female cat?|`|XPB6Ogj0aa	It depends on many things.  Is your cat a pure-breed?  If so, then there are specific written standards against which your cat is judged, the shape of the ears, body, head, tail, eyes, etc.  The list is long and exacting.  The judges usually don't talk during their judging as it is known what is expected.    If you cat is not registered pure-breed, then you would enter it into the Household Pet class (HHP).  This is an open class where the judges have no standard but their own personal experience and taste.      I used to show my cats in the HHP class and it was so much fun, especially with TICA.  Most HHP judges will talk through their judging explaining what they are seeing and what it likes.  One judge told the audience that breeders work for years to get a certain eye color and God gives this beautiful color to a HHP.  Your cat must be healthy and immaculately groomed.  It must have it's claws clipped.  Even with clipped claws Foozie opened a judge's hand.  Needless to say he didn't final in that class.  They must be spayed or neutered.  The only "whole" cats allowed in a show are pure-breeds.    I strongly suggest that you attend a few cat shows as a spectator before you enter your cat.  It is an all day or weekend event with lots of distractions so can be very tiring.  Sit in on a couple of rings and see how the judging is done.  Talk with some of the exhibitors.  Most of them will be very happy to talk to you and answer your questions.  You will also be able to find out which group you will enter you fur-kid into.  HHP classes are divided into color group (bi-color; color point; solid; short-hair, etc.)  You can learn a lot.  P.S.  don't bring a lot of money as you will definately spend it.    Hope this helps.  Enjoy the cat show.
DLxh9CANaa	Unless you live in Canada or near it, your chances of finding it here in the US are pretty close to zero. The US is the only country on the planet which has a cultural taboo against the killing of horses for food purposes, which is actually rather sad, if you ask me. Horse meat is a a sought after delicacy across most of the rest of the globe, especially in Europe and the Pacific Rim countries. You may be able to find horse meat for sale if you go to a specialty shop which sells imported products from Europe or Asia- they sometimes will have the meat frozen. Otherwise, I am not certain what to tell you. Horse slaughter was outlawed in the US in October of 2007, and the slaughter plants actually closed some months before that, so it's been some time since horse meat has been available commercially here. That's why I think an import export place would be your best bet.     BTW: For everyone here who thinks that I am some sort of nutcase, I am not- I just don't believe that the USA is the world's food cop, and I also feel that we DON'T have the right or license to impose our beliefs and values on other countries, or dictate to them what they can or can't do. Horsemeat is a delicacy in other countries, and horses have been slaughtered for food since the dawn of time. The first relationship ANY human being ever had with ANY horse was a predator/prey relationship- and in most places in the world, that's still true. It's also worth noting that the USA'S OWN record on this subject isn't exactly pristine and pure, either- WE slaughtered horses for food too, and there are records from the first World War and from the Civil War which indicate that our troops were fed horsemeat when nothing else was available. It's only been in the last half century or so, with the Disneyfication of animals like horses, that people have come to see them as pets and playthings, instead of the livestock which they really are. Nobody wants to kill Black Beauty, Fury, Flicka, Rocket ( who was Flicka's mom)  The Black Stallion, his son Satan, his daughter Black Minx, or any of the other famous fictional horses, most of whom have taken on human characteristics. But this kind of thinking is recent- it hasn't been the way we always thought of horses. This tendency we have to project our own traits and feelings onto animals like horses is in large part what has led to things like the ban on slaughter. People can't seem to get past the idea that horses are ANIMALS, NOT PEOPLE, and that they do not share our feelings. Yes, they have a right to be treated humanely and decently, but that doesn't mean we need to treat them as if they were our own kids. If someone wants to consume horsemeat as food, I have no problem with that- I recognize that there are plenty of places in the world where horses are an important source of nutrition for millions of people. There are some countries, such as India, in which the slaughter of a cow would be as reprehensible to the people there as the slaughter of horses is to us in the States, because of their religious and cultural beliefs. Does that make them a bad society or people? HARDLY !!! India is one of the strongest allies the US has in Asia- and they are also a big trading partner for us. They have a right to their beliefs, just as we do- and there are a LOT of people here in the USA who are incredibly SELFISH not to recognize this.     I wish you luck in your search.|`|LOH6UVh7aa	Canada, France, Germany|`|AA11570905	Canada  France & other European countries  Japan  much of the middle east|`|KVkkPqumaa	Kazakhstan.

fWf3A3Ioaa	You should turn them as much as you can, is the BEST answer.  Turning twice a day is NOT sufficient.  While incubating the parents rotate the eggs probably anywhere from 1-2 times every HALF hour.|`|2rXWZkbnaa	You should turn incubating eggs about once or twice a day for best results. If you leave them in one position then they will die.Good luck on hatching them!|`|YhH0PNupaa	At least 3 times a day. Not an even number ever. B/c if you turn them an even number of times, then they are on the same side every night for extended periods. Last year, I turned 5-6 times a day. This year I have an automatic turner. They turn about 12 times an hr now.
5RRMLzvzaa	I only feed 3x a day, some only feed 2.  It doesn't really matter how often you feed as long as you pick an amount she should get and don't exceed that every day.  Divide her daily food allowance into how many feedings she gets.  You might be better off reducing her feedings to two or three, since if you're feeding her a tiny amount very often, she'll never feel full/satisfied, and will be more apt to bug you more.  With just 2 or 3 feedings, she can eat more at one time.    Cats usually don't know when to stop eating, and if you give them as much as they want, they'll wind up overweight.  Stick them to a diet.  If you're feeding canned food (which is a lot better for them than dry) one 5.5oz can per day seems to maintain the weight of my cats very well (between 8 and 10 lbs).|`|tc8nbxmyaa	Your cat is gonna be obese!

The question shouldn't be how much but what to feed.        Nutrition since there are so many bad things out there is very important to your cats health  Contrary to what you may have heard; dry foods are not a great thing to feed a cat.   Please read the label on what you are feeding? What are the ingredients? Do you know what they mean? Is the first ingrediant a muscle meat like chicken or meal or other things?  http://www.catinfo.org/ Learn_How_To_Rea...  http://iml.jou.ufl.edu/projects/Spring04...  Dry foods are the number 1 cause of diabetes in cats as well as being a huge contributing factor to kidney disease, obesity, crystals, u.t.is and a host of other problems. Food allergies are very common when feeding dry foods. Rashes, scabs behind the tail and on the chin are all symptoms  The problems associated with Dry food is that they are loaded with grains and carbohydrates which many cats (carnivores) cannot process.  Also, Most of the moisture a cat needs is suppose to be in the food but in  Dry, 95% of it is zapped out of dry foods in the processing. Another thing, most use horrible ingredients and don't use a muscle meat as the primary ingredient and use vegetable based protein versus animal. Not good for an animal that has to eat meat to survive.  http://www.catinfo.org/ My_Cat_is_Doing_...  You want to pick a canned food w/o gravy (gravy=carbs) that uses a muscle meat as the first ingredient and doesn't have corn at least in the first 3 ingredients if at all.      THE  BEST CAT FOODS CONTAIN NO GRAINS NO BYPOODUCTS NO MEAL  Cats are meat eaters not cereal or rice eaters   Fancy feast is a middle grade food with 9lives, friskies  whiskas lower grade canned and wellness and merrick upper grade human quality foods. I would rather feed a middle grade canned food then the top of the line dry food.   Also, dry food is not proven to be better for teeth. Does a hard pretzel clean your teeth or do pieces of it get stuck? http://www.felinefuture.com/nutrition/bp...

Vetinarian diets  The reason your vet thinks so highly of the pet food they sell probably has more to do with money than nutrition. In vet school, the only classes offered on nutrition usually last a few weeks, and are taught by representatives from the pet food companies. Vet students may also receive free food for their own dogs and cats at home. They could get an Iams notebook, a Purina purse and some free pizza.  http://iml.jou.ufl.edu/projects/Spring04...
DN7flVphaa	The most important thing for owners to remember is to be proactive. Do your research on the things concerning you and your horse.     Getting different opinions from professionals in the horse industry is ALWAYS going to be an inevitable part of our business. As an owner it is your responsibility to educate yourself as much as possible in order to process each opinion and apply it sensibly to your situation.    Without looking at this horse I can tell you uneven wear on a young horses' foot is a sign of developmental errors in their conformation and natural deportment (way of going without rider on their back) If corrective shoeing/trimming is applied at such a young age it increases the chance for this horse to stay sound with less stuff added to the shoe. No farrier can correct a structural error with your horse. BUT if your horse is conformed as to move a certain way (maybe not desirable) a skilled farrier CAN work with the angles on the horses foot and get the best possible movement. Placing SMB's (boots) on the horses leg will not change the fact she wears her hoof improperly. I am wondering if that because she may move oddly the trainer recommended the boots so she won't brush her leg with the hoof?...    Sounds like your mare might severely wing out with her movement or paddle in. Both types of movement can be detrimental to the horse's tendons and body depending on the degree of  this faulty movement.     I would start with a trust worthy and skilled farrier who is willing to work along with a vet to determine what is the best outcome for this horse. To a certain degree any horse can be made sound these days, whether it has the horse's best interest in mind or not. As an owner you must determine that!|`|ewwfcDDyaa	I'd believe the vet and farriers. I mean, there the ones who went to school! The trainers don't have any experience as being a vet, and probably don't know what their talking about, when it comes to health. You should believe the ones with the college degrees, certifications, education, and experience.|`|vow5ULxTaa	a horse can only carry so much body weight.  you said yourself that you are a large rider but the fact that your horse is only 8 makes me question the leg fluid one.  You can tell if she was having knee and leg problems by x- rays.      She may also wear her hooves down unevenly because of her conformation.  if her hooves turn in slightly she will wear more on the inside because the distributes her weight slightly different than a horse who stands straight.      Trust wise trust the most experienced(the farrier) you said yourself he knows arabs.  I also think that the riders weight will be first noticed(if problems) in the back before the legs.  both will be aggravated but the back will be noticeable before the legs.    a horse should only carry 1/4th of its body weight.    if the horse( arab is 800Ibs) then the rider should at max be 200Ibs( this includes tack and Accessories)    i otherwise see no problems.      i would also suggest a trainer that doesn't tell you to go buy something for your horse like sports boots.  My theory is that a horse should naturally be able to fix itself without the help of aids.|`|Xobbmd7Saa	I would get a second opinion from a vet. Ask them this question and which trainer to believe. Let both the vet and farrier know of both of the ideas and see what their opinions are. Good luck|`|mKWwz1uUaa	Well it's a tough call but another vet exam would be were I might start or the farrier, but I've notice you said last time farrier saw your mare was in Aug, and It's February, lasts a long time between trims?  Maybe you just need to have them trimmed, and more often?  I don't see how boots would help this problem anyways, and what age is your Arabian and what type of training and how often?    Sorry didn't see the age, but what about a hoof abcess that might explain the weight not being properly spaced, and the fluid on the leg due to the strain, but not sure, a vet is the best call on this one, best of luck and hope all is well...
139bcf1997c52bd2204b4f639a9bf88baa	Sounds like tape worms. She ingested a flea that had the tape worm larva in it. Then the larva hatched in the intestine. What you are seeing is the segments of the worm.  Now for the cure DRONTAL.  Tapes do not usually show up on a fecal float. You can have a nnegative float and still have worms as the pet does not shed the eggs all the time. Just make sure you have your pet on heartworm prevention as it also protects against the most common worms out there.   Also Hertz is worthless.|`|hZWup7xXaa	just go to your vet and ask them for a deworming pill, let them know the weight of your dog sense that is all they need to know about it. try to explain what the worm looked like, did it look like spagetti? how big was it? colour? the pill should only cost $12-$20. or you can get them to examine your dog again. but your best bet would be to go to the vet. hope this helps and good luck :)|`|gwUMipsUaa	It's not worthless.      But do call the vet as she's a puppy.    I bought store bought dewormer for my dog when I noticed on a Friday evening she had worms.  We decided if it didn't work, we'd take her to the vet the following Monday.  We didn't have money for an Emergency Vet due to having just made a house payment, lot rent, and paid a couple other bills.  But the OTC stuff worked, so no there was no need for a vet visit.    If Hartz was deemed worthless, people would have stopped buying their stuff long ago.  Companies stop making things that don't sell well.    I have used Hartz and Sergeants stuff on my other three dogs before Petco and Petsmart came to town.  So no one will ever convince me their stuff is *crap*.   I usually only go to Petco or Petsmart now for my dog because I can make a donation to shelters there.  That's not an option with Grocery Stores.|`|m1oaS5Xpaa	take her to the vet and get a de-wormer shot. I understand you don't want to do that but it's not extremely expensive and it works. My friends puppy had worms and he was 2 lbs. and we took him to the vet, got him a shot, and he's fine now.|`|RKQTD9Dhaa	I would call the vet and tell them that she has worms.  They should sell you the medicine without you having to pay for another visit.  I would even wonder if there was a mistake in the lab when they ran her test.    BTW I have used Hartz and it worked just fine.|`|vPde97E2aa	If it JUST had a negative fecal,it does *NOT* have worms!  It *may* need it's AGs emptied OR it might just have had a ITCH! Dogs don't have hands.you know.|`|TpOVmqpHaa	Your vet, if he/she is any good, will allow you to bring another stool sample OR just bring in one or two of the worms, and give you the appropriate meds without charging you for another visit.    Hartz isn't the best but it may work.  However if they are tapes (tapeworms) it will be ineffective.   Just give the vet a call and tell them what you've got,ie, describe the worms.   Negative stool samples aren't uncommon in infested dogs. I'm sure they'll work with you without hurting your wallet.|`|C1eHfhrHaa	Call the vet and pick some wormer up there.    Anyway- they have all of her info, so they shouldn't need to see her again.|`|qplKpji5aa	I would just give your vet a quick call and let him know the situation. It's not that big of deal and they should be able to tell you fairly quickly. I always take my new pets to the vet to get de-wormed, it's only a few dollars and I trust their medicine.|`|nvsVXlBlaa	call your vet. but try the meds for a few days.
2f2c6f10c5560ebd511a3a0f309b0f01aa	YOU must establish your leadership with this horse NOW.  I cannot be more emphatic about the danger of a horse usurping leadership over a human, which is what your horse is doing with you.  He is the leader ... and he weighs 10 times what you do.  Therefore YOU must be the leader or you will continue to be runover and worse.    Training him will not take any extra equipment other than a rope halter and lead rope and some gumption.  Begin exercises of just walking with him and halting.  Use verbal command "whoa" when you stop.  If he takes as much as one tiny step after you have stopped and said "whoa", correct him immediately by calmly backing him up several steps.  Continue this little exercise until he stops when you stop.  Then practice going through the gate.  Remember, he is not to take one step beyond your lead.  If he does, back him up.  Making him work a little will make doing the wrong thing uncomfortable.  When he does the right thing, scratch his neck and gently praise him.  He must KNOW that YOU are the leader for your safety.    I purchase a saged roping horse not long ago and believe it or not he did not exhibit the best ground manners.  He can head and heel in grand fashion, but he tried to rush past me while leading him through the gate.  We had a little lesson on the spot, by going through the little exercise I just gave you.      Read and study and watch DVD's that will help teach you how to communicate with your horse on the ground.  But do not keep things as they are.  You must implement some changes immediately.     And remember, you are establishing a relationship with you being a leader, not a dictator.  There is a difference.  Horses respond well to calm step by step training, never scare tactics or corporal punishings (aside from a flick on the nose or quick jab with an elbow when called for and done calmly and matter-of-factly for misbehavior such as nibbling on clothing or beards or pony tails, or any other kind of inappropriate behavior, which can be very dangerous if not dealt with abruptly and on the spot).      Remember also, if a horse can, he will.  It's up to you to teach him then, just when he can and cannot.|`|LAXxaxAZaa	Get a lead with a stud chain.  It can be like this:  http://www.blackswampleather.com/leliwic...  But you can get any type of lead you want... it doesn't have to be cotton.    Put the stud chain through the metal ring on the left side of his halter, bring it over his nose, and clip it on the right ring. You don't have to yank on him or anything... just the feel of it and the weight will make him not want to pull away.|`|uwrzB6Kzaa	when he barges off to eat grass, you may not be able to stop him doing it now but  when you do get control of him again take him back to the spot he was before he barged off and make him stand still.    i have dealt with alot of horses that barge which is dangeous when you think of what a horse weighs compared to humans.    when you are leading him around let him walk for a bit then make him stop. then once he has stood still for a while let him walk on again then stop him again. remember to speak to him loud and clear so he learns the words like stop and walk on. keep repeating the stopping and starting. it seems stupid but it gets your horse to listen to you and do what you want.    it is slow and you will need patience and inbetween you training him to listen to  you you will probably have some bad things happen but in time he should listen to you.    if you are still struggling to get him sorted out and cant afford a trainer why dont you offer him for part loan. someone who cant afford a horse of their own would gladly share time with your horse, if you find someone who has experience with horses like this and they can offer your horse time and training exchange for you letting them ride him.|`|4KY26xQqaa	Let him know who is boss. YOU ARE.   When he does this don't go awww... look he wanting the grass.  Yank his head back up with your headcollar and leadrope and give him a a firm smack with two fingers on his cheek or nose whatever is facing you! Whilst you do this, a clear and calm NO!   They soon learn the word NO mean NO!    Good Luck or you could try ground training parelli etc. But I don't because I don't let any horse take the mick out of me. Don't get me wrong I spoil them and love them soo much and praise then more than I give them into trouble, but when one steps out of line then I WILL let them know!|`|q9Dg8BdFaa	Sounds like it has some B-A-D ground manners. If the horse is over-powering you, then you should take your elbow and press it into the horse shoulder really hard and circle it many time to keep it from bolting ahead of you! I did this with my friends horse. Her horse spranged my wrist almost it was so over powering. But not the horse leads better. She finally rode her and the horse just calmed down. But on your sercum stances you have done rode this horse. Try yell in a voice you wouldn't like to show that's it's wrong and continue until it stops!Hope this helps!|`|GB8fSTw8aa	I think there are some good answers already, and i agree with most of them that i read, it is an issue of the horse not respecting you , or may be an issue of the horse just thinking it is the boss, in any case it is always better to know what the horse is going to do before it odes it, and thwart its efforts before it actually does anything that you do not want it to do. One thing i learned when i had a stallion was to have a luonge line whip in my hand and just waving it got the horses attention, he learned i would not hit him with it but he always respected it and paid attention to it when i waved it in front of him. I also would drape it over his back and he would stand real quiet when i did so. But the best way to prevent the horse from doing something you do not want them to do, is be attentive and not let them even start to do the thing you are trying to keep them from doing.|`|3wIZiZA5aa	Go back to the basic ground work to earn his respect. I bought Clinton Anderson's DVD Round Penning and it has worked wonders on my horses. They are a lot more respectful on the ground as well as under saddle. I bought it on eBay for cheaper than Clinton's website and it was in great condition! But in this situation I think you'll need his Gaining Respect and Control on the Ground series.    Here's a link:     http://downunderhorsemanship.com/catalog...    http://downunderhorsemanship.com/catalog...    http://downunderhorsemanship.com/catalog...|`|3E2CPpEqaa	Sounds like a respect issue.  I don't think the grass has much to do with why he does this, its just the treat he gets for pushing you around!  Don't get a chain to put over his nose or on his lip.  What you need is a rope halter with the pressure point knots and a day or 2 in an enclosed area.  Check out some of the Parelli or Clinton Anderson exercises for respect.  Any natural horsemanship answers will help you.  You need to get your horse to realize that he can have grass... when you tell him he can!  Make those feet move every time he makes a wrong move.  And let him make the mistake first and then punish by making him move, lots!  Make him tired over it and make him think about it.  It would probably take a good week of this, but you will break him of it.|`|KgNYZOFLaa	I agree with lancelot, Backing up...... it is an extremely effective way to train bargy horses, I have used this method many times, with great sucess read her answer and folow it.|`|lbJe2hNqaa	turn him out using a type of head-collar/bridle called a chiffney   it has a bit but it doesn't have brow band or nose band
JiCKFTuIaa	What a doctor would do is give a patient small doses of the allergens by injection in order to reduce the sensitivity. You can do the same thing simply by controlling the persons exposure to the dog.  My daughter owns a grooming shop and she was deathly allergic to cats. She now grooms cats an a daily bases with no problems.|`|AA12128656	take the family member to the Dr. and have them tested.  would it be fair for them to live with allergies?  would it be fair to rehome the dog because of it? no.   have the family member tested and find out.    my father's allergic to dogs, and his throat closes up. if he came to my house, he could require a trip to the hospital at the most, and a very uncomfortable visit at the least. i wouldn't voluntarily subject him to that.    i'm allergic to cats. they make my face and eyes itch and i cough, even if i don't pet them. it would be totally unfair if someone in my house adopted a cat!    you can't get an animal that someone is allergic to. that's literally making their life miserable.    hepa filters, etc. don't do much. because the dander is still in and on the animal.|`|IrwWyzMeaa	SELL YOUR DOG|`|thCmn0noaa	You can get a dog that sheds less, some kind of poodle mix or any dog that has hair instead of fur.  They are called hypoallergenic dogs but even still there may be a reaction to them.  Getting a hepafilter and making sure the dog is groomed outside would help too.|`|QikvnTnqaa	There are HYPO-allergenic breeds. Dogs that wont cause a reaction to people who are allergic to dogs. :)    You may not want to buy them from a huge breeder like this, but you can find out what dogs you can look for. :)    http://www.justawalkhomekennel.net/index...    http://www.associatedcontent.com/article...    http://dogs.about.com/b/2008/11/10/hypoa...|`|AA10620246	You need to find out if that family member really is allergic or not before you get a dog.  Have him/her play with a friend/neighbor's dog, and see what happens. If they are allergic, allergy medications would be a big help.If you get a dog, and it turns out that they are allergic, no amount of vacuuming or filtering the air is going to fix it. It might help, but it won't stop the allergy. You will either have to put that person on allergy meds, or get rid of the dog.|`|zWFJBlJZaa	Go to:  http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypoallerge...    Also, there is a topical product called Aller-Pet which helps to keep the dander down.|`|RZAjrv8Xaa	You are also able to get shots from the doctor or pills to help with the allergy. A friend of mine has dachshunds, three of them and is allergic to dogs but takes a allergy pill b/c he loves his dogs and there is no way he would just give them away. Also i would just go to the doctor and get tested for allergies to dogs. That would help eliminate what is bothering the person so much. I would also first test out at other peoples homes who have dogs before you decide to get one. I would really hate to know that you decided to get one and it just didn't work out and you had to give it away or drop it off at a shelter. Please don't do that. Hope all works out!|`|gwUMipsUaa	Don't get a dog until you have your own place.      The family member's health and well being is much more important.      As for right now, you can volunteer at a shelter and love those homeless dogs that no one else will love.|`|RKQTD9Dhaa	There is nothing you can do if the person has a severe allergy.  If they only have mild allergic reactions you can look for a breed that is better for allergy sufferers.      Of course, vacuuming, bathing the dog, and just keeping a clean house will help.  The person can also try allergy medicine.    Before you get the dog, you need to have the person pet the dog and see if their allergy is too severe.  You don't want to get a dog then have to find it a new home simply because a family member has an allergy.  It's too easy to avoid that situation by not getting a dog.|`|rDLTnjRyaa	First of all, have the family member get tested for allergens. If he or she shows positive for allergies towards dogs, then the doctor can prescribe the individual a medication. Two, make sure you are using vacuum bags made to suck up allergens and that the house is vacuumed every day. Three, consider getting a hypoallergenic dog like the poodle, for instance. Poodles don't shed and are great for allergy sufferers. Four, groom the dog as often as needed.

Crows don't normally attack unless provoked.

gM7VuCM4aa	Yes, what you are describing is tapeworms, they are like moving pieces of rice. The over the counter wormers that you can get at pet shops and farm supply shops do work. There is no need to take kitty to the vet, this is something that can easily be treated at home. Plus you'll save the expense of an office visit. I've attached a link that shows a popular feline tapeworm medication and it works very well, just follow the directions on the back of the bottle. Hope this helps.|`|YBcB0732aa	http://www.petsmart.com/product/index.js...    Tradewinds Tape Worm Tabs for Cats works. It was only available with a prescription but now it's available over-the -counter. It $20 a bottle, at petsmart, for 3 tablets that  really works. I used this for my cat.    Treat you cats fleas if if has any because your cat will get reinfected by eating fleas.    Flea larvae feeds off the  tapeworm segment that came out of your cat butt. The flea larvae become infected with the tapeworm. Your cat clean itself and eats a flea it get reinfected.(learn more about the cycle here: http://www.marvistavet.com/html/body_tap...

There are no over the counter medications to get rid of it. The vet will most likely give it a pill to get rid of them and the pill is NOT expensive at all.|`|hZWup7xXaa	you should be able to buy deworming pills from your vet, i have from all kinds of vets. just call and ask if they will sell you one (all you need is one pill from them) and this pill will kill the eggs as well so you don't have to keep treating them. it costs $12-$20 from them. you can buy deworming pills or liquid stuff from pet stores or walmart but they don't kill the eggs and takes longer for them to work. hope this helps and good luck with your kitty :)|`|fb8a814c78b9ea803ce553353913cea0aa	If you do get the pills/tablets and treat the kitty yourself, please beware that sometimes it is hard to get the cat to swallow a pill.  They have videos on YouTube that will show you how, but each cat is different.   The vet assistant told me it was a piece of cake to give a cat a pill.  It's not!!!  And if your cat has claws, you should wear long sleeves or cover her paws with a towel.  Try to sooth her with your voice and do it as quickly as possible.  When I gave my cat the pill (which was $5.00 for each pill, by the way), I gave her a little dropper of water to wet her throat first.  I'm sure it's not pleasant to a cat to have to swallow a DRY pill!    Good luck!|`|vl6OtBfWaa	Tape worms are NOT like rice a tape worm is 1 long worm in your cats intestine that eats almost all the food your cat will ingest if your cat eats anything and everything without stopping and is still bone skinny they have a tape worm .

Don't worry it is common and rapid treatment will have good results|`|99735a22fbfaab5561850052bda71db5aa	Why are you looking so closely at your cat's anus?|`|3ubzZjWYaa	I believe Petco gives the worming shots which will save you an office visit fee.|`|efaa37a6bc4099dfbc7b2158a2ec4965aa	It does sound like tapeworms, your vet can sell you a pill that will get rid of them.    I was told by a Vet assistant that you can tell if your pet has worms by lightly rubbing your finger on the roof of their mouth.  If you feel ridges, no worms, if it feels mushy, there are worms.  I don't know if that is true, but it has proven true for my pets.  Have a great day!
5f6fbccb8643408cbd62a8431b3e5c44aa	the moment you notice that a bird isn't well please seek medical attention, 99% sure this was a respiratory infection and it is very treatable. it can also be passed from bird to bird very fast. as always if you want to know what happened to him ask a vet and they can determine the cause of death so you know if you need to treat the rest of the birds or not. birds will get diarrhea when they have a respiratory infection and can die from dehydration really fast. i have been dealing with birds since 97 and i have treated several of my birds for this illness. it's very common and has to be watched for a lot.|`|2rXWZkbnaa	Before you rooster went through this sickness, was he acting weird before this?

469ca2d2bcd9b0f6f06c8d756b37b248aa	I bet everyone will be glad to see that you're back.  Some of the people that you remember will also be gone, but there will be some who remember you.  People come and go at barns all the time.  There will also be lots of new people to meet.  Maybe even some new horses!    When you talk to your old friends and acquaintances, you can tell them what happened, just like you told us here.  And you can say that you really started missing horses and riding and that;s why you're back.  I'm sure that you will be welcomed because you've got horse experience.  A helping hand who has experience is always welcome.    I understand that guilty feeling.  Once I bought a horse from some friends who sold their beloved mare to me because they needed money.  They never came to see her because it was so painful.  They felt guilty and it was even more painful, so they avoided it even more.  I junderstood completely.  The same thing happened with me when I sold my mare's two babies.  I realized that it was just too painful for me to go see them again, and I trusted that the people I sold them to were good to them.  Many people have the same experience and same feelings as you.   If you go back to the same barn and see your old horse and the owner again, you will be a rare one.  It will give you strength of character.  That's something that you can use all your life.    Most of all, you'll find that seeing the horses you remember will heal your heart and your guilt.  Horses are full of heart and have a lot to teach us about ourselves.    Good luck!|`|cLtzGveRaa	Ya know... I was raised to believe people noticed what I did... and were envious cause we were soooooooo well off.  (We weren't... we just had lots of stuff and even more debt).    Then I grew up and moved out and had a family of my own and began to realize that... ya know what...?  Nobody even notices.    Go back to the barn and talk to the owner.  Outside of him, I doubt anybody will even remember you.|`|IMPvzBk1aa	Only go back there if you can handle some snubbing.  People have the capacity to forgive and forget, but they may make you earn it.  If you truly feel badly about what happened in the past, it could be cathartic to face your demons and deal with this.  But it could backfire and make you feel worse if you aren't up to eating some humble pie.  I personally think going back may be the mature thing to do, but be darned sure you really want to commit to it this time.|`|lTeXIjpOaa	if that is what you want to do i say go for it, don't worry about what other people are going to think, do what is going to make you happy|`|RUzBDX6Jaa	I know that I would!  :)  EDIT  everyone else is saying that you can't take care of a horse.  I agree that neglection is not an option.  Just don't buy a horse... the most you should do is:  Take lessons.|`|3O2SfwIBaa	you need to ask yourself why you left in the 1st place. was it because of the horse. the people or the hard work. it sounds like nothing bad happened to you so i would put it down to immaturity and lack of commitment. if you really want to ride what other people say shouldn't affect you. i know when I was a kid I had to ride my bike for 10 plus kilometres(1way), with a heavy stock saddle on the handle bars to get where my horse was boarded and when I got there the ******** kids that worked there would tell me my horse was in the big back paddock so i would walk for 30 mins trying to find him only to go to the house paddock and he was there. I never let it get to me i just showed them up all the time, because i would work really hard. Plus i had the best horse there.  so you need to be 10000% committed and don't worry about others.|`|9IZ0CmxPaa	yeah, you should go back to it if you like it!!! I left because my trainer was slightly mentally unstable (haha, you think I'm joking!) I sold my horse and thought it would be nice and have the free time all my friends had... but really, it was horrible! I went right back to riding within a month with a new trainer and bought a new horse :P|`|XL62syrCaa	No. You shouldn't. Frankly you didn't have the commitment to take care of and ride a horse the first time. So no.|`|3YHZUuhyaa	I don't think anyone will really care. And if they do, who cares! it's not like there's no drama that goes on in the horse world. they'll get over it =D    It's not like you're a horrible person for recognizing that you weren't paying enough attention to horse and giving him a good home. there's no harm in that.   anyways..yeah i think you should go back to riding. it AWESOME!    Good luck!|`|04QDV97kaa	Definitely go back to riding. It one of the best things on earth. You don't want to keep missing out on that worrying about something that might not even happen. Even if they didn't like what you did don't worry about it.

I don't know where people are getting that you were going to buy a horse....    I think that if you go back to the stable no one will really care since you did the right thing by the horse.  Just go back and do a couple lessons to see if you really do want to get back into it.|`|Yr5zBsIHaa	go back, don't let things get in the way you want to do, and you will be able to see your old horse again! thats always a good thing.|`|0RLrs7Ajaa	Don't worry what people will think. Just think that back then, you did the right thing by selling your horse and never carried on not giving it the attention it needed. People will know that. As soon as you go back people will be glad to see you and the minute you step back on the yard all your worries will be over!!! Hope you go back, especially if you're missing it.|`|mUNJEh8baa	I think you should go back to ride, but first you need to think it through. Do you have the commitment and responsibilty to ride horses again? Are you going to help out around the barn even when its freezing?   If that is a yes, then you should ride again. I don't know if the people will dislike, some might and some might not. If you really love horses, then just ignore them.   Work really hard at your lessons and people will slowly start to like you more and more.     Good luck.|`|x1FyqVKLaa	I don't think anyone really would care that much. This sort of thing happens to a lot of people. We simply run out of time or lose intrest. At least you sent the horse to someone that would take care of it.    Some people just ditch them or let them get really unhealthy first.|`|DrEgX4QNaa	I'm Not Sure It depends On What You Think    Riding Is A Passion...I Could Never Imagine Leaving It     Whatever You Feel    (I know It's Sentimental But Honest)|`|3kqsbpIbaa	You should go back!  If you are missing it, then get back in the saddle!  Don't worry what others might think.  If anything, you should be commended for recognizing the fact that your horse was better off with someone else at that point in your life!  Giddy Up!|`|NiQAfFUPaa	I have owned horses for years  Sometimes you just don't feel like it.  I would think if it is full care your horse was taken care of, but remind yourself you recognized that you found your horse a home when you needed to.    If you had friends there and enjoyed, I would go back.  If part of the reason you did not want to go is because you didn't have friends, try a new barn.    Good luck
JCTEMzTzaa	I feed my puppies Iams and they love it but also what you feed your puppy depends on the puppy. One of my dogs will eat any food and the other one is picky so I found one they both like. I have never had a bad experience with Iams. I have heard Eukanuba (spelling?) is good but have not tried it much. Also make sure the food you get matches the age and size of the dog. Most foods have specialized puppy food for small, medium, and large breeds or dogs. Just make sure you read the bag before you purchase it. Good Luck!|`|EeJMITyCaa	I hear it is. Any dog food that has meats as the first two ingredients are of higher quality. Just don't get any Purina or anything else found at Walmart|`|KxjUim7yaa	Does it have byproducts or filler grains in it, if so then no. A good food can be found by reading the 6 star choices at dogfoodanalysis. Pick one your local pet store carries. I chose Solid Gold Barking at the Moon as an alternate to home prepared food. There are adult as well as puppy formulas rated.|`|gypCmdWqaa	my vet  has always recommend iams for puppy's|`|26PPwzrWaa	Nutro?     Its ok, not great, but now where near bad.

You can't find a good food in Wal Mart or the grocery store.  Buy at a Pet Food Specialty store.  Like Soldan's.  Don't get one with fillers, like beet pulp, and if it says corn in any way or by products put it down.    Feed qaulity and you will see the difference. Try and get an all natural food.  Innova, Chicken Soup for the Dog Lovers Soul, Solid Gold, Wellness, just to name a few.   Just read the labels.  If it does not have vegetables, fruit, meat and such, don't buy it.   Good Luck.|`|wvrgyYoUaa	Go with Purina Puppy Chow.  Despite what some people say, it is good.  It meets all major nutirition req. and keeps my huskies coat beatiful.

81675c7bcc2aa81478472216e01229f7aa	Stay away from "teacup" Pomeranians.  Size DOES play a role in price.  The breeders will charge you extra just because it's the runt of the litter.    You want a POMERANIAN.  They only come in one size.  Do some research and find a reputable breeder.|`|76nTvO4iaa	Pom prices in North Texas are high.    Depending his his pedigree, a Pom from a reputable breeder could easily be $1,500+    Here's a link to rescue Poms available in Dallas:    http://www.petfinder.com/search/search.c...|`|afPzgCSHaa	around 500$ depends on the breeder.  There is no such thing as "teacup" or "mini"!  just saying so you wont get tricked into paying MORE money.|`|gjD8pndjaa	Pomeranians belong to the Toy Breed group.  There is no such thing as a "mini" or "teacup" pom.  There are just dogs that are out of standard and runts  Size plays no factor in price, either, neither should color for that matter.    So a pomeranian puppys price will vary by breeder.  From a reputable kennel that health tests and such, it will probably be $500+ for a pet|`|wCDAYGd0aa	well I just have to Say,  You are going to have health problems with a breed that small they are just not equipped and the breeders are just not  reasonable for the creatures they are putting in this would|`|p7swtBYzaa	You sound as if you are buying an ingredient for a dish - by the pound, that's just plain dumb when it comes to a living animal.

Places like Vietnam aren't likely to have many breeds like Papillon or even many purebreed dogs. Poorer countries couldn't care less about Purebreed dogs unless they serve a purpose. Like a working dog. That's because many of the citizens of poor and when you can't even afford good clothes and a god house you don't tend to have too many Papillons or Yorkshire Terriers lol.|`|g71BoHXpaa	no not really if you were in washington some are even free!     you know i'm asian too you know i'm filipino and i certainly don't eat dogs i think that's cruel|`|om4Szik7aa	Well, if you dont live there you would have shipping charges on top of the dog itself, so you would probably end up paying even more for a dgo from Vietnam, then buying one from a breeder near you.

EeJMITyCaa	No one is going to let you keep that breed if they're responsible because they want to avoid any lawsuits and other problems.|`|PM23RDycaa	You are pretty much going to have to call around but look on the bright side, VA is one of the few states that have law prohibiting/preventing BSL and the local government level.    Your best bet will be to look for places with a flexible acceptance on the weight limit and have no breed restrictions. What I have seen so far are either nothing over 25lbs No agressive dogs or open weight limit (different pet rent/deposits for each weight rang) BUT breed restrictions.    I would definitely look into getting your dog Canine Good Citizen certified and mentioning that when you call around.     It could be worse you could be in a city that's more cat friendly than dog friendly. Took up forever to find our current place, no breed restricts or size limits.|`|P8Q39vA4aa	You want to live in the two most roughest areas in VA. Id be more afraid of someone stealing your dog and using him for dog fighting. Seriously those are two areas you do not want to live in.    Then you might want to start kicking because hampton and newport news are the two most roughest places, dozens of murders everyday that go unsolved. Many gangs. Michael Vick's from that area and look where he is.    Im in middle virginia about 3-4 hours away from hampton, my friends from that area she tells me everything.|`|om4Szik7aa	Sometimes you can get the dog registered with Good canine Citizenship and that will help with discrimination against certain dog breeds.|`|26PPwzrWaa	I will see what I can find, but your best bet as everyone else said is to call around and go to when you visit.  And before you sign, make sure its written in the contract, not spoken.
hIyjdXr9aa	Mollies crave vegetables, so they'd probably nibble at any steamed plants you give them.  Be careful not to foul your water with rotting food, though.  And don't forget that you still have to feed them fish flakes most of the time so they don't get malnourished.    As to the aggression, that often happens with mollies.  Most websites list them as "semi-aggressive", meaning that they're not going to necessarily come after you while you sleep at night, but they're not going to be perfect little angels to one another, either.  You may get some ripped fins if you overcrowd them or they are uncomfortable because of poor water conditions.  Mollies get less aggressive if you give them a lot of space and hiding places, a well rounded diet with lots of veggies (algae wafers are a great supplement) and clean water.      If you haven't already done so, try adding some live plants and aquarium salt to your water.  Mollies will nibble on the plant bits that come off.  If you add some salt to the water, then you kill off some of the freshwater parasites that might be in your tank.  And the fish don't mind salt at all; they can live in anything from freshwater to brackish to saltwater.
Toj8xh3laa	cat food won't hurt the puppy, no it is not good for them to eat it, but that is because it causes diarrhea in dogs...my dog used to do it all the time...about the white stool...i'm not sure about cat food, but it sounds like maybe she got into the cat's litter box...i've seen puppies do that too and have the same results...as long as she isn't still vomiting and is acting normal and drinking then i wouldn't worry, but if you are still worried, call the vet's office, most have an emergency number to call after hours, and you can explain it to them..hope this helps to ease your fears :)|`|JCTEMzTzaa	you should try to take her to the vet sooner or just try to give them a call and tell them what happened and ask them about it. they might tell you what to do over the phone. you definitely want to make sure she stays out of your cats food and make sure your cat stays out of the dog food. It is not good for them, as you have found out, to eat the others food. That is why food is specified for dogs or cats. I think and hope your puppy will be fine but you just might want to try to call the vet just to be sure. Good Luck.|`|afPzgCSHaa	she'll be fine. But it's not healthy for pups to  eat cat food. Don't let her eat it again.|`|gfksposqaa	Dogs drink out of the toilet and lick their privates, I don't think some cat food is going to hurt her.|`|4MxCAm6gaa	no worry. dogs get used to their food and anything other than that can make them puke. it'll be fine....don't let him eat anymore cat food
S9B8Fr4daa	None of those dogs are overly laid back or submissive.  A goldren retriever or lab are going to be the most laid back out of that group.  As far as submissive..Thats more of a dog to dog basis..You could have 10 of any of them and not guarantee any of them will be submissive.  Submission is a personality trait--not a breed trait.|`|ixOE0onnaa	Lab will be great! very cool!|`|60FT7Pzcaa	Golden Retriever for sure. Mine is scared to death of my mini dachshund. When my dachshund comes in the room, my big golden retriever runs and jumps in the chair. Its hilarious!|`|QdQcAHqaaa	Goldens. The rest of those dogs are either hyperactive or dominant.|`|K97esxDsaa	I wouldn't keep any dog with a wolf-hybrid at all, to be honest. I know it's not what you want to hear, but hybrids aren't dogs and it would be risky to keep it with a domestic animal.|`|AztYCjc7aa	I've trained many of these breeds in basic obedience and some agility work and I have to say Labs and Golden are generally the most laid back and submissive AFTER they are between the ages of 2-4, before then they are usually pretty hyper happy dogs. As far as compatibility with a wolf hybrid I'd have to say an alaskan malamute (they are one of the more primal breeds and often establish a great kinship with wolf hybrids) or boxer (they are often confident enough to be comfy with a wolf hybrid), however you may not get that laid back attitude with those two breeds!|`|c6gMZH33aa	Nothing small, due to the high prey drive.... Not a golden, lab, or dane. I would say something closer to wolves in breeding would be more compatible , like a German Shepherd or malamute.|`|FWVuePiNaa	labs because there yousally calm and are usally laid back|`|AA11328642	i would say newfoundland but thats not one of the choices.  maybe either lab or goldie|`|g71BoHXpaa	http://www.breederretriever.com/dog-bree...  check that site usually the most submissive is the affectionate one my golden retriever is so submissive when i walk to her she would just roll on her back waiting for a belly rub we also nickname her ms.wigglebutt sometimes she would bark if you don't rub her belly|`|wvrgyYoUaa	Ignore these answers.  A Lab is not the solution.  Trust me from experience, wolf hybrids have an INSANE prey drive and some can even take down baby calves.  A lab or retr. is easy prey if something they do sets your wolf hybrid off.  Get something close to his breed.  They will scuffle but become friends.    Your best bet is a Siberian Husky, Malmute (choose careful) or another hybrid.  Nothing smaller, nothing too docile like a lab.|`|Toj8xh3laa	the malamute is going to be the closest "relative" to the wolf hybrid...i had one for 13 years (wolf/husky) and i'll warn ya though, she didn't like any other female dogs or any male dogs if they were bigger than she was...she was also very very protective of my family...out of your list though...the great dane actually has the best temperment of any breed on there...actually the best temperment of most breeds...i have one and they are awesome with all animals even cats...but they are also very protective of their family....good luck..oh and also...a lab is Number 2 on the "biting" list of insurance companies...|`|TTs6GBBUaa	either the lab, golden, or great dane. If I had to pick I would pick the great dane they generally get along with everyone and don't need a TONE of exercise like the other two.|`|6pUzzsuhaa	a lab is really hyper and they need a LOT of exercise and they are not really that submissive either.. if not trained properly, like with any dog, they'll run the house if you dont train them right    i say get a malamute or German Sheppard or husky because of how closely they'll relate with your dog's prey drive- those dogs are working dogs and they are know for a high prey drive. and for the submissive part- make sure that the dog you get is the opposite sex of the dog you have and make sure BOTH are spayed and neutered to avoid any problems down the road     a lab and golden will be too hyper for a hybrid dog, and thus that will create problems- a dane is too skinny and 'leggy' for the dog you have, same with a boxer    female dogs are more submissive than male dogs.  if your dog is a male, get a female; if your dog's a female, get a male- to balance things out    a German Sheppard would more closely match the size of your wolf-hybrid better than any other breed  and majority of the time wolf hybrids are mixed with German Sheppard's, huskies, or malamutes|`|uHCIxJmqaa	im gonna sat golden retriever or lab they seem to get along with alot of different animals and humans!!|`|9UttDvcsaa	I would say Lab|`|tRfgwT5saa	Probably the lab.|`|9Y56hQRlaa	Golden retriever or lab. (my dog is a golden and will not fight any dog..... unless it fights first that is.... ) she gets along with everyone and everything.. people or animals. Labs are pretty much the same.|`|ZT0K3q2Aaa	I would say the lab. They have an overall good temperament.|`|ySr7QlgNaa	well you are taking great chances of a animal getting killed by putting it with a wolf hybrid but a great dane( or german shepherd can at least hod their own.
OyNJTWaiaa	If you are talking about the newly hatched chick you have in the nestbox, now is NOT a good time to change the cage situation. Changing cage or nestbox around when new babies are hatching from eggs is a sure way to stop the parents caring for the babies in the nestbox.   Any plans for a cage for a family should have been sorted out BEFORE you put a nestbox in the cage you have.|`|zRXkkh0Maa	If you want it to stay in there in the future, yes. If you want it to stay in BOTH next time, then change its cages on alternate days.    And yea, you can try letting it out to get use to you and the environment as well.|`|rqB7w37maa	It mostly depends on what you have now:  -If your cage is big enough to house the parents and the baby(ies), you probably won't need another one unless the parents bully the chicks, but it's always better to have extra cages on hand.   -It doesn't really matter, when my parakeets had babies, the baby just ran around and the parents followed him to feed him, so you can leave him outside when he first starts flying.
cI19nesraa	I would put a deeper layer of litter in his box and maybe change to a different litter.  If he is a large cat maybe he needs a larger box.  Also there are litter mats that help to take the crumbs of litter off his feet when he comes out of his box.  Hope this helps.|`|pXS9xa1Laa	Well if u try and switch to a larger grain/rock of litter then the pebbles will most likey fall off after wards. a larger box can also help with a little deeper sand in the box. Also, u can buy mats or a small section of carpet to lay outfront of the box that is supposed to help remove stuck on pebbes. hope this helps  and good luck :)
e7304a95864d064998cb6153f4d52b91aa	If he has been your friend for 9 years, maybe you could return the favor and have him put to sleep rather than break his heart by leaving him. In this case it would be the more humane thing to do.|`|agR89OPtaa	What an uncaring person you are.  Don't just dump him, if his cancer is terminal then just have the vet put him down.

If you have children or will ever have children I don't think you would find that the best idea for your children or spouse to abandon you when you become ill why would you treat the dog that way? I would euthanize him, some shelters and vets do so at low cost please don't abandon your friend.|`|KFu7596Paa	now this is a good example  why some people should'nt own dogs.    dont get rid of jim like hes trash you should look after him to the day of his departure     if by the wy you do get rid of him follow this advise      NEVER GET ANOUGHTER DOG YOU CRUEL PERSON|`|Q3WweuOCaa	So he's sick and no longer of 'any use to you?'  What about him? He is sick and being abandoned...people like you shouldn't have pets. I hope and pray that you only kidding.   Pets are MEMBERS of a family. If nothing else...go to the vet with him and put him down, hold onto his paw...and talk to him. My dog has cancer too, I just spent $1,500 yesterday. I have to put her down, and I don't mind that so much as how she feels and that we get to see her tomorrow and say goodbye. I don't want her to 'feel' abandoned. I want to look at her and feel the love that our kids and my wife has.|`|UyAGXNCsaa	You're a sick individual.  You should be put away.

Stupid dog, just laying around dieing and being sick and taking up your time    *rolls eyes*    f*cking a$$hole|`|Sm9cq8KKaa	How mean!  Stick it through till the end with your dog, if you truly care for the animal in the way you should, not basing your decision on whether he is "use-full" anymore. How would you like it if you were diagnosed with an incurable disease and those who were by your side all along decided to "abandon' you because they saw no point in associating with you any longer? How can you live with an animal for years and years and decide that this is going to come between you? Your dog is still the same old dog, with or without the cancer. He needs you now more than ever, so don't abandon him. It is a VERY bad choice!|`|om4Szik7aa	Are you freaking kidding me!?!?! Thats a horrible and insane decision. I cannot believe you would consider doing that!! I sure hope your posting this as a joke, because if it were anything other, you should be not allowed to have animals, period.|`|AA12069383	No. If you had a child that was just diagnosed with cancer, you wouldn't put him or her in the streets.|`|S9B8Fr4daa	A selfish one!  Troll.|`|KxjUim7yaa	How insensitive can you be? Pretty much so I guess. It costs next to nothing to have the poor thing put to sleep at the vets. God rest his soul. He won't be meeting you in heaven. It will be a happy place for him.|`|9UttDvcsaa	I always wondered how those older sick family members ended up in the shelters and what those people must be like, I guess I read up on one just now....makes me want to vomit.  What comes around goes around I guess, good luck in life.  I am sure one day when you are sick your kids will let you rot in a hospital bed and you will die alone.|`|a6an2aN0aa	There is no need to feed the trolls.|`|2c844fcf526bc2b90f16b7c425e11aa7aa	How disgusting you are.  Maybe one day your family will abandon you if you get sick. That would be justice.  Karma is a wonderful thing and you'll get back what you give. I doubt this dog has had a decent life with you at any stage.     Man up and do the right thing for once.  If you don't have the balls to care for your dog take him to the vet and stay with him while he is put to sleep. When it's all over NEVER get another animal, you don't deserve to own one.    You have it a$$ about.  It's not that the dog is of no further use to you.  It's that you are of no use to the dog and probably never have been.  You're probably of no use to anyone else either, with your attitude.    Most of us who have had dogs with cancer care for them lovingly and make sure they're pain free.  When they no long have quality of life   we take them to the vet and stay with them while they are being put them to sleep and we grieve for the loss of our loved dogs.    The shelter will euthanize the dog because you don't have the balls to have it done the right and proper way.  I hope you suffer the guilt of your neglect for a very long time.    Add: Just read your added comment that you are in financial crisis.  What goes around comes around so I guess life will become a lot harder for you, that is natural justice. You get no sympathy from me.|`|4j5BGoW2aa	you could do tat and the dog could feel lone and scared and have a heart attack and DIE|`|6IkgdwcQaa	thats horrible. im sorry but the least you can do is confort him and pet him. If the med. bills are too much for you than either give him up to another family or raise money. If hes gonna die soon, then jsut love him. my dog was very sick and we gave up on treating him with the med bills and three years later he made it through fine.|`|gfwK3SWIaa	That's pretty messed up.

Regardless whether or not you are in financial stress ~ there are resources out there today that offer help in situation of this nature;  SPCA, local humane societies, vet office, churches, friends and family ~ if you look hard enough I am sure you can find someone to help out.      This dog depends on your and you want to abandoned it and at a time in its life when it needs your most...|`|QbOYIixuaa	Of course it's a terrible decision. If you had a child and they were diagnosed with cancer, would you abandon them? If you got struck with cancer would you want to be abandoned by your family? You're very immature and selfish.

You don't deserve that animals love.|`|ySr7QlgNaa	your a disgrace to anny animal lover you pose to be . how would you like it if you got cancer and you mother or guardian or whatever abandon you because you weren't of anny use anny more your a selfish inconsiderate jerk.|`|gypCmdWqaa	let me ask you one question... while this pet was healthy and well, did you consider him a part of your family? With that said, would you abandon your child if they become ill, or become disabled?... Your question is so ridiculous, especially to think a person would ask a question like this to begin with. You should not be able to own pets if you are so willing to just dump them whenever you feel they aren't up to par anymore. You think that after having this dog while healthy, and then becoming ill, that you would be with your pet even more now than ever to help them and be by their side. Pets need compassion and love just as much as humans do. How would you feel if you became terminally ill and your family decided to abandon you? Is that a good decision?.... There's your answer!|`|aYuLexJKaa	What the heck???? Why would you do such a thing. That is heartless and cruel. Just b/c he has cancer doesnt mean you ditch the dog. I dont know why you got the dog then. Normally people grow close to the dog and bond. Dogs have feelings too. Dont get another dog if you are going to do that!|`|JCTEMzTzaa	NO! that is not a good decision. just because your child was sick would you abandon them? that lab has been your faithful pal for 9 yrs now and now that they are dying they deserve to die in a respectful way rather than being put to sleep by a shelter. Just try to take care of him and stick with him, he has stuck by your side and the dog might die sooner from stressing about being in a new environment like a shelter. i just hope u decide to stick with your lab.|`|60FT7Pzcaa	Excellent decision. Screw the stupid cancer dog!    p.s. are you mentally ill? that is the worse thing I have ever heard|`|YdI0TLczaa	Dear God!! Don't abandon him! Keep him as long as he doesn't seem to be in discomfort. When he appears uncomfortable, take him to the vet and have him put down. The injection they give does not cause a painful death. I stayed with mine until she passed. It's like they just go to sleep, no wimpering or anything.|`|YvNOfM2xaa	AWW no! Listen to yourself!   If you were your dog and you were sick would you want your owner to go "Oh Well I'm giving you up."    That is NOT a good decision to give up your sweet dog!    The shelter people are right! Too many people are giving up their pets and I hope your not the next one.    If you give up your Innocent dog, obviously your lab needs an owner that it can depend on.    ~Animal Lover~|`|PaKdsomYaa	ABSOLUTELY NOT if your going to abandon him then just have him put down if you take him to the pound he will die alone with no one to love him stick with him till the end   i mean how would you feel if someone left you alone to die when you had cancer think about it please|`|Xaw48PZ7aa	are u seriously that sick?  just take him to the vet and have him put down!  esp if he is in pain, the vet will recommend to put him down.  dont abandon him, thats really cruel.|`|u4WU01EXaa	ARE YOU REALLY THAT HEARTLESS IT WOULD HAVE COST LESS TO PUT THE POOR THING TO SLEEP THAN  THAN WHAT YOU PAYED FOR IT!!!!! and when you are sick i guess someone can stick you in a cage and forget about you. the chances of them re homing a sick dog is slim to none.

You were his pal in the beginning and now you just want to leave him for dead? thats not right|`|ol8BTJCfaa	no it is not a good decision u can nurse him back to help and take care of him!|`|0hv6xVVGaa	So what. Now that your dog is sick, an unhealthy, you just leave him to die? No one is going to adopt him, unless someone miraculously decides to buy a dying dog. That is a mean, horrible CRUEL hing to do.

Think of all the good times you've had with your dog, no doubt, since a dogs a mans best friend, that he stayed by your side, when you were sick with anything from a slight cold, to a near death experience. Now that your dog is diagnosed, with a disease that it not contagious to humans, you abanon him in his time of need? Please don't.    If you drop him off at the pund, he wont get trated nicely, he will get treated like a peice of ****. Your dog does not derserve this. Please don't.    Hopefully you get what I'm saying. Overall, your idea is a bad one. SO dropping him off at the pund?  Please.Don't.|`|6OysOF2Qaa	That's horrible!  If the dog is in pain you should put him down.

You don't deserve a pet.|`|5Up1iL3Saa	I don't see why you want to abandon your dog at a time like this. Don't you care about your dog anymore? If it were you would you want to be abandoned?|`|7NJibOe2aa	This question is hard to answer. In 2006 my australian shepperd/collie named Ozzie was diagnosed with  lymphoma(bone cancer). At   The time she was 11 and before then was a happy and VERY hyper dog.  We chose to keep her because we loved her as more than a pet but as a family member as well. She was on Chemo therapy for about 1 and 1/2 but then of course we hit the economy problem.  We continued as long as we could financially support her. In about Feburary of 2008 the vet said she was no longer going to have a chance at living and to begin saying our goodbyes, She kept living. Finally we did put her too sleep in April to put her out of her suffering. Now I am only 13 but my opinion is that if you actually love your dog you would not put them in the pound. If they are ill they chance are even worse at being adopted and your dog will most likely die, alone. Now would you like your child,sister,brother or loved one to die that way? When you adopted your dog, you promised to love it. Your are going to abandon your dog just because he/she is sick...I think it was a sick and wrong idea.....but I am glad i did not make your decision. I remember right before she died we gave her chocolate. You should have seen her face.....it was so happy. Do not deprive them of their happiness. Keep them wether you are going to do Chemo or not they will be happier with you than in a pound.|`|N5zSGjSQaa	It's absolutely disgusting that you see your pet as "having no use to you."  A pet is a companion, not an object that you can just throw away when you get tired of it.  People like you have no business owning pets.|`|nAoECygxaa	ur horrible let me dump in the streets cuz u have cancer....u are so mean i would never in my life do that to a dog or any one ..at least u can do is let it out its days with u....never have a dog or any living creature again.....
Bnkx4Wozaa	There are two possibilities how she would react:-    1) She will bounce back in no time, completely oblivious to the fact that she just had major abdominal surgery and will act just fine and go about her own daily routine like normal.    2) She will be very groggy, tired, sleepy and will act besides herself for a good few days. This is probably a lingering effect of the anesthesia, which wears off at different times for each cat. This scenario is most possible though.    Right after you bring her home from the vet, she will be disorientated and will pace around the house, wondering why she is feeling the way she is. She will need rest and quiet. It is always recommended that you place her n cage rest so she will not have the chance to aggravate her incision sites by running into things and jumping on and off high places. The vet will most likely ask you to discourage jumping and running but from experience, I can tell you that it is almost impossible, without cage rest. If you can't place her in cage rest, restrict her in a room/smaller area in your house.    She might not have the appetite to eat, regardless, just offer her food and water as usual. Some vomiting might occur as a result from the anesthesia but it's not a big concern unless she has been throwing up for a few days without any food consumption.    Some cats will take a huge interest in the sutures and will lick them and try to groom her belly. You must monitor her closely. If she has been gnawing at her sutures, there is a possibility that it might come undone and you do not want that to happen. Constant licking can also irritate the area and cause delayed healing of the site. Irregardless of whether the vet used a conventional sutures that needs to be removed or dissolvable sutures, check to see that the incision site is healing properly. A small amount of dried fluid or blood is normal for the first night after surgery. If it becomes excessive, oozes, feels hot to the touch, or if your cat is acting ill (decreased activity and/or appetite more than 48 hours after surgery), you must consult your vet at once.    Good luck with the spay and you are doing the right thing for her so don't worry too much!|`|eEeCIRDaaa	She might be a little sore and lye around the house, or she might be a little aggressive depending on your cats personality.  But it will only last for a couple of days then she will be right back to normal, so don't stress out too much over it.|`|YFzCJ1uaaa	well im getting a kitten soon  so i have no expierence or anything  but cats r known to be maybe a lil slow and sore and sluggish a few weeks after  but just pamper her extra and she will be as good as new  also after she gets spayed ask the vet if its ok   but you and ur cat should go to petco  and get her a new toy or something|`|8881wS3kaa	How wood it fill to get your nuts riped out of crutch, and go home to Look at the one who did idt ..but really it is better than having a bunch of illegitimate kids(kitten). think about the future|`|6be65543422b4937c27d1761a2ed50a0aa	Different cats react differently to the anesthetic, the soreness, etc, so it's hard to give a "definite" answer to your question.  It also depends on what kind of temperament your kitten has!    To be on the safe side.......while she's at the vet, go to a pet store and get some BITTER APPLE spray.  This way, when she comes home, you can spray around and over her stitches, to keep her from licking, chewing and tearing them out.  Better to "be prepared", than to be running around wondering what to do for her.    Also, by using this spray, your kitten won't need to wear an E-collar, which most cats HATE........    When you get her home, give her a nice comfy bed, in a quiet place and just leave her alone.  She may want to sleep for awhile, but if she doesn't.......try to keep her from jumping for a few days.  Don't try to get her to eat the first evening, but have water available.  She will go to her food when SHE'S ready.    Congrats on being responsible and having her spayed.  She'll be a healthier, happier cat.......and you won't have to worry about "unexpected" kittens.    Hope this helps.........Good luck.|`|4a4b9be516eeab81005bf8f97c61e37aaa	Rachel was spayed at four months of age.  She came home from the vet's, ran under the bed and came out right away minus the e-collar she was wearing.  She proceeded to jump about, run and play all evening.  She never touched her stitches which were taken out ten days later.    Actually the younger the kitten the faster the recovery will be.  It can depend on the anesthesia used.  There is no "lag time" if the gas is used.  Ketamine stays in the system much longer and the kitten might be out of it till the day following her return home.    It probably won't phase her much at all.  Your attitude is very important so stay positive about it.|`|x3RBy8Ljaa	She will be lethargic when you first bring her home, she will take it easy, and don't let her jump to high places.  You will be surprised how unaffected they are.  She won't be active at first,  she will be a bit sore but she won't show it.  Just let her be in a quiet room,  with food, water and a litter box and she will just fine.|`|isF1nhVfaa	She'll definitely just want to lay around for a bit. She just went through a major surgery! Gradually she will become more and more active and back to your normal kitten!|`|X4leB44Baa	Cats react differently. My first cat was very mellow, did not want to move, and slept almost the first week. My new kitten was very hyper and my boyfriend and I had a hard time keeping her from popping her stitches.    Basically just try to keep your cat from excessively licking or jumping around. Monitor their belly every day for any blood, puss, or large lumps. The lumps can be either a hernia or from moving around too much. Keep your vet informed.    Don't worry your new little baby will be better in no time.|`|AXJ89Jyaaa	My oldest cat was 4 when she was spayed.    She was also rather chubby, so it took longer for the anesthesia to wear off.    My younger cat was less than a year old at spaying, and of normal weight, so she bounced back more quickly.   Otherwise, the spaying didn't really impact their behavior/personality.|`|qs4k0D9vaa	well I just had my male cat fixed and he only acted like that for a couple of hours...now he is so hyper and off the wall its impossible to control him...I guess the answer depends on your cat...they are like humans they are all different...
8EyDsAt6aa	First off you should never use anything pine or cedar because it has toxins in it that could cause respiratory problems for your gerbil. I tried using it when I first had guinea pigs and I would break out in hives and my little sister had crazy asthma attacks. I switched to Carefresh which is soft absorbant pulp thats recycled and really is an awesome bedding. But yeah you should definitely try something else if you want your gerbils lungs to be okay.|`|Dy4g6nOaaa	No you are killing him pine is bad for his lungs.|`|f96dbdfb33ecfe1ebea6423d5d7fc870aa	just like to say the 1st answer above is spot on. pine and cedar can cause respiratory problems. go to the man made bedding or stick with the aspen hun. for your allergy try taking a Benedryl.. it helps for topical skin irritations as well as watery eyes, sneezing etc.
vJzCrX88aa	you may have researched on how to breed guppies, but obv not what to do with them afterwards.    you should go see your local pet shop and ask them if they will buy them off you or take them off you for free.. whatever you want to ask.|`|ixOE0onnaa	yes!!|`|uJJfco2Iaa	Well if you don't want so many guppies, just let your guppy drop her fry's the normal way (leaving her in tank until she drops) but have plants so some fry can survive. If you leave her in the tank while dropping she and the farther might eat some so you don't have to stress on about giving them away or something.    Another way is to get a breeding net and put your female in there when she looks like shes about to burst. That way u get to keep all your guppies but if you want them you can sell it online for 0.50 each or to your local fish store.|`|ZwjYKWrqaa	I personally like breeding danios more, more interesting to watch them. resarch how to breed them. Also the fry of zebra danios are cool looking. If you decide you like doing it Id suggest moving to angelfish, and if you're lucky you could get plecos to breed. Dont do those until you are farely experienced with breeding.|`|3n60UxgQaa	1.  Breed them anytime you want.  Because they live in an aquarium, you can control the "climate" persay.    2.  Guppies breed like rabbits on steroids.  You do have places to put the fry right?  Remember that you may get as many as 6 batches of fry per female, 50-100 fry each.  That's a lot of guppies.|`|HYw0YE7Gaa	ew dont breed fish! my brother did that and he has like 40 little fish and they are really gross.
rAAHHYEWaa	yes anything can|`|37Q4QMF1aa	Yes they can.|`|SyyBtXFuaa	animals can get almost everything humans can so yeah i think its possible|`|n7bok7NRaa	Yes they can.

So can dogs and many other mammals.|`|4hNRTWtDaa	There are different kinds of hernias, and yes.  If you think your cat has one, see you vet.  Sooner rather than later.|`|AA10091923	kim  yes...they can...but i wonder --- why-what makes you ask this...is your cat having symptons of a hernia    and there are several types:  Hiatal Hernia , diaphragmatic hernia, Perineal hernia     first i would suggest typing: cat hernia    in your local browser and do a bit of research of the type of hernia you think your cat may have.    then, absolutely, contact your vet  tomorrow regarding this problem.    hope everything turns out well....  good luck  :)
TYohMrlXaa	Sure! Stay away from iceburg though, Romaine or spinach is healthier.   They will certainly tear bites off themselves. Just remember to stick the greens in the freezer a little while to wilt them so they are softer and easy to bite and digest. It's nice to have a veggie clip if you can find one at your pet store. Take the lettuce out after about 2 hours.      The most important thing for growing goldfish to their full potential is the size of their tank, you may wanna look into a bigger one if they aren't growing. You must always do your weekly water changes too.    I would highly recommend this website for more ideas about goldfish food, also take a look around for tank size recommendations.  http://www.kokosgoldfish.invisionzone.co...|`|3n60UxgQaa	Take your time.    Don't attempt to try and make them grow faster.   1 thing to keep in mind is to make sure that they have sufficient space.  If they don't, they won't grow and will get stunted.    Yes, lettuce is fine.  Cut them into goldfish size bites. =]    Other things you can feed them:  Peas are especially common.  They prevent and aid in curing of bloat, constipation, and swim bladder disease.  Use fresh/frozen peas as the canned may contained harmful preservatives.  Deshell/defrost the peas.  Zucchini  Carrots  Cucumber    Make sure to cut the last three in pieces so that your fish can swallow it.    The veggies should be used as treats.  The flakes should be the staple diet. =]    Underfeeding is better than overfeeding.  Keep that in mind. =]|`|2Jmodoaeaa	5 goldfish sure is an awful lot! Are you going to be moving them to a pond or a like, 100 gallon tank any time soon? Well, I dunno, let me just answer your question . Yes, you can feed them lettuce, but let it be known that lettuce is not necessarily any good for them. It isn't bad at all, but it holds little to no nutritional value (at least for goldfish). Goldfish do however love to nibble on it all day. I would suggest feeding your goldfish pea's, they are really yummy and good for your fish too. You can feed practically and veggies to your fish, they will do no harm.     Good luck, and happy fish-keeping!  ~Taylor~|`|JPGLcIWqaa	I don't think that would be the proper food for fish,but if you want to find out,why don't you try out cutting the lettuce into flake-sized scraps and seeing if they like them or not|`|1iGp2etEaa	Lettuce is a good treat for goldfish but I wouldn't have it be the main part of their diet iwould only give lettuce as a treat not a main food.|`|ckeOS0fdaa	Zucchini is great. Don't worry about cutting it, slice it in half length ways and weight it down with a fork in the end. The fish will nibble at it and love it. The other foods would be  blood worm on occasion and Algae pellets. The best way to get your fish to grow is regular water changes with a gravel cleaner  about once a week. Good luck
tPGxPDvBaa	Quite a few houseplants are toxic so place them out of reach.  Pups are starting teething at this age & exploring, it is up to you to train her & keep harmful things way from her reach.   They don't know or understand so never leave her out unsupervised & crate her when you are not home. Everyone has to go thru this stage & is a good reason I don't want to adopt young pups so I don't have to go thru again.....ever.|`|jWmnSXlLaa	Yes some plants could make her sick. Some could even kill her. She is bored thats why she is doing this and she is teething also. It is a puppy thing in general. Get her some toys and maybe a Kong to keep her distracted. When she is chewing on the wrong things tell her no then replace it with her toy. She will grow out of this but if you dont correct it she might continue to think it is ok and lead to issues later on.|`|49ec8e0944023c0f5c20e37484f16366aa	You have to puppy-proof your house just like people baby-proof their homes.

Take it to the vet sooner then that, forcing him to walk on it will just make the sprain or break progress, which will also cost you more money.|`|1Q4GTAwdaa	You really haven't given us much info here.  What kind of dog is it? Different breeds can be susceptible to different ailments.    It could be arthritis, broken, sprained, dislocated, something stuck in between the pads of its feet.    Just take the poor thing to the vet.|`|9UttDvcsaa	There is no way to tell without a vet.  If it is a sprain you could try epsom salt in your bathtub and just soak her up to her elbows in it and let her move around or soak the leg in a deep pan (I don't know how big your dog is).  Use really warm water and a good amount of salts.  The epsom salt will draw out the heat and help with circulation.  I use it on my horses all the time and just recently discovered it is great for dogs too.  Good Luck!|`|S9B8Fr4daa	how are we supposed to help you!   Just take it to the vet..  Its not a waste of money if you don't know why its happening.  It would be selfish and cruel to not take her.    If shes limbing..that means there is some sort of pain associated with it and should be tended to immediately.|`|AA10072754	uhh well without any of us seeing it and that being as descriptive as it gets...we only can tell that the dog doesn't wanna put weight on it for some reason.    Any incidents?|`|ymbGBJDxaa	Not to scare you but worst case it could be a tumor which let's prey it isn't but also dogs tend to get into things when we aren't around like putting legs through crate wires and twisting so in may be a sprain but a vet is a must.|`|p6zy8vWiaa	your dog may have arthritis.

GSkA8wh9aa	Nah, sounds like he's feeling great! He's workin' those hormones out of his system. That's a good thing!  All the best!|`|AA10091923	no---nothing wrong with him...remember a 9 month old is the equivilant to a teenager (human).....he is still young and will have lots of energy for several years to come.  just cause you fix a male (feline or human) doesnt mean they lay down and just sit around...to the contrary....he will play for quite a few more years.....it will be around year 8 or 9 when he finally slows down.    I have four cats 18yrs to 15 yrs and they still have their moments of playfullness....not like a kitten...but still pretty playful.    enjoy him, take videso, and pics of him.....the time will go fast and it will seem like he was frisky years ago.....play with him now...feathers, lasers, balls, etc....    enjoy him now  :)    good luck  :)

gUsJlTvKaa	It sounds like they have white spot disease.  What you need to do:  1. Make sure the tank is in a warm area, or if you have a heater turn it up.  2. Do a 1/3 to 1/2 water change on the tank.    3. Treat them with White Spot Remedy right away.    4. Put Aquarium Salt into the water.    5. Don't feed them or feed them very little while this is happening.    5. Re-peat treatment in the tank as recommend on the White Spot Remedy bottle. ( which should be treat it again in 3 days )    6. Obviously don't add any other fish to the tank while you have this problem.    7. Figure out how you got white spot? It could come from new fish coming into the tank, new plants or could of been near a open window where cold air was being blown onto it.    8. Learn from it so you know what to do next time.|`|76b2313ad607b0e7b0eb85999b17c136aa	it's called ich     http://freshaquarium.about.com/cs/diseas...    GL|`|om4Szik7aa	It sounds like ICK. I would go to your local pet store and buy a product to rid them of it. Good luck!|`|GPO4UsyKaa	ICH    YRR fish could die.    Look it up on google.  GoodLuck|`|ckeOS0fdaa	White spot on fish is a stress disease, very much like cold sores in humans. You will need to buy a product called "white spot remedy" and follow the directions on the bottle carefully. While treatment is in the water, turn off your filter as this will only filter the treatment out of your water and be a waste of time. Also if they are tropical fish turn your heater up to 30 deg Celsius to help kill off the spores. Thoroughly clean anything that has been in contact with the water ie fishnets, to prevent contamination. Also a good gravel clean over the period of treatment will get rid of any spores that may still be living in the gravel.|`|Qwr3FvE6aa	Sounds like ich. Are they as small as salt grains and slightly raised? Do not buy meds, they can usually do more harm than good and for ich they really are not necessary. Raise your tank temperature to about 86*F. Do it very gradually though, like a degree an hour so as not to shock the fish. The high temperature can get rid of it. Good luck|`|vO7BVu43aa	yea its the ick.. my fish have it too... I bought this blue med called   Maracide and its seems to be slowly working. my fish are slowly getting rid of it.|`|X9DNi4pgaa	its ich its really easy to cure.  you can get the meds at walmart or a petstore.
ZT0K3q2Aaa	i guess, hes just showing how much he loves you. Which he must love you ALOT|`|Toj8xh3laa	some dogs just do this...i've heard my vet say that this sometimes is dominant in dogs with anxiety issues....or you might just have a lot of salt on your hands...what do you do all day? he might just like whatever is on there...there's honestly no telling|`|aYuLexJKaa	Hes showing his affection to you.|`|AA11667605	It's possible you're using a lotion or soap or doing something that attracts the animal. My cat tries to molest my mouth when i chew a certain gum.     Or he just really wants to let you know he loves you.|`|ymbGBJDxaa	Affection, nerves, or just wanted attention more then  likely affection and they want to play.|`|j3fV8lFkaa	Maybe the dog just smells something like another dog or food try washing your hand but its totally normal :)|`|N9pKl35Xaa	Some also do it because of stress
AA10091923	first let me start with why the peeing.  with 6 cats---(i have 4) they are all competing for your affection.  Each wants to claim you as theirs.  So when they pee...it is a form of 'marking their territory--YOU'.    There is a spray you can get at any pet store like petco or petsmart ---it is called Natures Miracle-just for cats.    get the spray and spray it on your bedding after you have washed everything.  Warning---this spray may keep your cats from cuddling with you, as it is not only a odor eliminator, but a detoriant  for cats that spray or pee.    good luck  :)|`|9Mr14w6Qaa	They have sprays at the pet store that cats don't like the smell of (lemon)This should deter them from doing this.|`|YIp9Q2DYaa	well, you can always try and get some urine cleaner, it takes it off the surface and makes the smell go away (anti-perspirant) and the smell stays away.|`|YAPYO7L8aa	NO MARK helps with this. But better yet is DUMB CAT and it smells nice too! I have 18 cats and about four of them love to spray. And two cats love to pee on my bed. If I remember to spray this on my bed morning and night... it seems to work.  http://gastricbypass.homestead.com/Anima... (My kids)|`|n7bok7NRaa	Your mattress should probably be thrown out at this point.    But if you don't have the money to get one right away, go to your local pet store and ask for a product that makes cats stay away.    As for why they do that, some cats when they feel their territory is being threatened may urinate or defecate in places they feel safe in. This includes changing their box, cleaning the house, or having loud and noisy company over.     The best way to solve this is to clean the box a little less often (since you have 6 cats, this really is not an option), or to leave the trash bag you've thrown the litter in to remain on the floor while you finish changing the box (and use just a little less of that Lysol). Yes, it'll stink a little more, but your cats will go "okay, my poop is still here, and I still own this area." By the time the smell has faded (for them, not for you) they'll likely have gone back to the box to investigate and thus marked it with their paw-scent.    But naturally, because your bed has become a place for your cats to mark with urine, they're unlikely to stop soon unless you give them some real incentive to stay away at all times - especially by keeping the door closed and scenting the room with cat-deterring odors.|`|9440e28b2ef820fd5eab4d5cfc34217faa	I've never met a cat who liked bitter apple or citrus.    In addition, you may want to ask your vet about if one or all of your kitties are ill- and speaking of the vet, if you haven't already, have them fixed.    Another thing you want to do is wash your bedding thoroughly. And if the mattress has been soaked through, get a new mattress: That way they won't have a place marked with their scent.    If all else fails, you may need to find a way to close them up with their boxes.    Good luck.|`|7nr9Sivnaa	you could try onion spray. you can buy it at wal-mart, petco or petsmart.  that should work|`|iRhXfrNXaa	This happened with me as well.  I think the problem is the litter that you are using.  Try a corn based litter, or some other organic litter.    Hope this helps!|`|VFQFTeNKaa	> Train your cat's    > Buy some lemon spray and spray it somewhere your cat's love to pee
W0buucLsaa	You must have a rabies vaccination certification. You can get that at the vet. The U.S. doesn't require a certificate of health, but some states and airports do, so you must figure that out before you travel (or just go ahead and get it).     You can get more info at the Center for Disease Control:    http://www.cdc.gov/ncidod/dq/animal/dogs...|`|9UttDvcsaa	You probably need a health certifcate, you can get one from your vet.  That is all I have ever heard of people needing.  Your vet will know what a health certificate is and what you will need.|`|AA10072754	Yes you do need documents.  Contact animal control for the state you are going into (and if you can, the county).  Everyone has different rules.|`|KxjUim7yaa	Make sure your dog is up on all vaccinations as a protection to him. Get the rabies certification from the vet. Have your dog wear his rabies tag and a tag with your home address and phone. Also consider a micro chip. These things help in case an accident were to happen.    Carry the certificate of valid rabies vaccination with you.|`|hZjPYyFTaa	All his papers proving his shots. customs checked my lou lou off as beef.|`|WIFKeDBgaa	I'm assuming you're coming from Canada...all you need is proof of rabies if you're driving. If you're flying, it depends on the airlines as far as health certificates. Northwest & Delta no longer require them. Either way, you have to have proof of rabies.
Dy4g6nOaaa	You have to take it slow. Put a old tee shirt that you no longer wear into the cage that smells like you. They will get used to your smell and come around to like you. Just take it slow.|`|XurYYreBaa	Sometimes it takes awhile, especially if your rats weren't well socialized before you adopted them.  Keep trying the treats & also spend lots of time in the vicinity of their cage so they get used to your presence.  Talk to them frequently & use their names.|`|R0WgaUdgaa	Hi Hun,  Congrats on your 2 new girls.   The best thing is time. The have to get used to the new cage, the new surroundings, smells, etc.  And if they were not raised together they have to get used to each other as well. Keep up with the treats though. The faster they associate you with food the better you will be.  A good resource to ask any further questions is www.ratfourm.com  Hope this helped a bit.
qqUvoC5uaa	NEVER shave your Malamute.  Cutting his fur short, or shaving will cause more problems than leaving it long.  Actually, the way the coats are on malamutes and like breeds, they act as an insulator. Which keeps them warm in winter and cool in the summer.   Having a short or shaved coat can actually increase the risk of heat stroke.     To be perfectly honest, brining your dog inside when it's hot to reap the benefits of AC would be the best thing you can do for your dog.     However, placing a small child's pool with water in it can help.  Always keep sufficient water out as well.   I have not heard of the fan though|`|b60b6e8062f11f6cf697468a2c93558aaa	Obviously keep the dog house directly out of the sun and in a shaded area and be sure the area is very well vented/air flow and on a grassy area.    You can also purchase pet pools at Petsmart and or misters that mist the area and beside helping out keeping the temperature down it helps put moisture in the immediate area.    I have also heard of people freezing bowls of water and putting one out each day so the dog has something to lick on but always be sure the dog has cool and plenty of water at all times.    You can also trim your dogs coat shorter in the the summer months since Malamutes are mainly build/breed for cold weather and don't take kindly to hot weather.|`|ZT0K3q2Aaa	You should also hose down your dog, and the backyard, so it stays nice and cool for him|`|ymbGBJDxaa	If you want to keep dog cool mainly cut dogs hair super short in summer and let grow out around fall.  Keep dog house in shade and be very very careful with fans or vents remember any wires exposed whatsoever the dog will get a hold of it count on it.  Also make sure there is a steel wire divider between dog and vent so they can't fool with it.  Main shade and plenty of water.|`|Toj8xh3laa	our malamute didn't get in his house in the summer...i'm sure if you go to a local farm store, such as rural king or true value, they can help you out.....another thing that malamutes love is having one of those small (about 4 foot across and 12inches deep) kiddie pools full of water...they like to lay in it when it gets really hot and it's quite fun for them....for you too if you watch they get very playful in them|`|AA11097877	Buy alot of fans but make sure it blow COOL AIR . I think air-conditioner is the best option and  serve the Dog with cold clean water filter with ice-cubes .|`|UyAGXNCsaa	How about bringing him in on hot days so he can enjoy the AC with you?  If you can't bring him inside, consider re-homing him - dogs don't like being alone.  That's sad.  A doggie pool would help too, but really - bring the poor guy inside.|`|9UttDvcsaa	We use box fans for our horse stalls, I wonder if you could somehow put that in the back of the dog house.  I am sure their our dog mats out there too that stay cool for the summer, you could line the dog house with those mats.  Good Luck and what a great thing you are doing for your dog :-)|`|70878cc978ee2e4a79b3b53284340f9caa	Put it in the shade and make sure the dog has a constant supply of cold water. If the temperature gets above 80,bring the dog in so he can cool off. The vents are a good idea,or even a window or removable screened or latticework walls.
wADItPRyaa	I do some professional grooming to make a little money on the side, so I do about 20+ clip jobs between September and February, but even though I do it for money, I care about the horses and I usually advise clients (or potential clients) not to do a first clip later than December. If you do a first clip now, it's going to be a bit of a shock to your horse's system, even if you blanket carefully. It can also cause problems with the new coat coming in (horses start shedding between Feb. and the early part of March and the new summer coat begins to grow in shortly after) and you don't want to mess with that too much.     So I'd say no, even though it's tempting to try and avoid all the shedding or to have your horse dry quickly after a workout. It's do-able, but I don't recommend it.|`|RUzBDX6Jaa	Listen to hedley.  Ya know its neeva too late!  Okay so anyway.  No, you still can, but you would blanket your horse, right?  AGAIN.  Ya know its neeva too late!  get up and start all over again!  haha.  Im just listening to that song.  And rambling on and on.  I'll leave now.|`|NaM4ZT64aa	As a general rule, yes.  It is ideal to clip between October and December.  You can still clip now, but it will prevent your horse's spring coat from coming in.  Also, they have no time to adjust to the sudden cold.    I would advise you to wait until next year.|`|ejj2N3uaaa	No, it's not, just make sure you have the proper blankets for him because he's not going to be accustomed to the cold weather (I'm assuming he's got a full winter coat now?).    My show horse was just body clipped last weekend because we're doing our first big show of the winter (he was off for an injury at the beginning of the winter) soon. He'd had a full winter coat while he was off, so he's now having to be blanketed all the time.    EDIT: My show horse from 2007 was also body clipped at this time of the year and had a great summer coat. Then again, we try not to allow our horses to grow a winter coat (my horse this year did because he was off so I didn't bother with blanketing him unless it was super cold) and keep it short year round. My sister's h/j barn (a pretty top-quality place) also body clips plenty of horses during this time for the shows coming up, because a lot of them haven't been shown since late fall. I've never seen a problem with it affecting shedding/new summer coat/whatever. Just make sure the horse is blanketed/has shelter.|`|NiQAfFUPaa	If the horses is overheating and going to get sick.  Clip the horse.    Not ideal, but I used to clip all the horses that came to the track in the spring in March.  They seemed to have fine coats in the summer.|`|Xobbmd7Saa	Um, you really should have done it in November/December, and when you do it in November they can gradually get used to the cold weather. Where as now, it is just cold. Their coat will also not grow in ontime for show season.|`|V0ENn69aaa	nope. my horse gets clipped whenever he needs to.

w6ls0I1uaa	You are in control of the situation.  What does your puppy do...interested in you or just sniffing around a lot? If its the later.... that's a clue!  Study your puppy.  Do you leave food and water out all the time?  DO NOT DO THIS.  Until the puppy has control over his bladder.  Restrict the times you have food/water out.  What is your pups potty habits?  Some puppies will potty 2-3 times each....each time its going potty.Sniffing 10 minutes between events  Are you giving it enough time outside? Are you watching? (not being outside with pup)  Always use the crate for everything, sleeping at night, traveling, quiet times.|`|9UttDvcsaa	When he messes in the house don't take him back to his crate just because he is empty he needs to be taken outside and shown where to go.  I would suggest putting him a bathroom for his loose time until he gets it and then graduate to a gated kitchen or bedroom and then the entire house but still watch him like a hawk.  He will associate not going in the crate with not going in the bathroom and eventually will graduate to the entire house!  If you have puppy pads throw them away, it just encourages them to pee on your floor.  Good Luck!|`|Yc3tBWBQaa	Well first of all don't put him in his crate for not doing anything.  That won't help because he will just feel punished and he won't exactly know why.  I've got a Shiba Inu and they get house trained pretty quickly.  Here are some tips:    1) Decide when he eats or drinks.  If he gets to eat and drink during the day make sure you are there to take him out often  2) Don't wait for him to show you that he has to go, take him out every 2 hours or 4 hours or so    3) If you are leaving for work or something, keep him in his crate.  I dunno about papillions but for most dogs they are very clean and won't try to spoil their bed.     4) Praise him alot when he does go pee and give him the xtra special treatment!    5)  Have a word for when he does something.  When i take my dog out i say: Get Busy.  You could also say:  Buisiness, Hurry up or pee    Hope this helps    Kelsey|`|7nr9Sivnaa	Well..first you can lay out some newspaper, or buy the training pads for puppies. Then you can either collect or rub in the smell of your dogs urine or poop. Then bring the dog over and have him smell it. The dog should pick up the smell and realize that he should use the bathroom there. And if you want it to go to the bathroom outside, put him in the grass and keep him there until he goes to the bathroom.(you should do this after the dog eats or drinks)
1FPpglMpaa	I agree with the 1st answer.. Reverse sneeze.  Many people think their dogs are having an asthma attack or trouble breathing.   It is perfectly harmless and very common in small breed dogs.  HOWEVER, because he has pug in him, if this should happen multiple times a day every day or something similar, then a vet check up might be warranted to rule out any breathing problems.  But at this time, go with the reverse sneeze and enjoy your dog..|`|18f339d2d88d8a05cc418425220b52e1aa	Sounds like a regular Pug to me.|`|9UttDvcsaa	Did you get him from a shelter?  He may have kennel cough that is what they sound like when they are gagging and coughing sometimes.  I would take him to the vet, they can listen to his lungs and get him on antibiotics before he gets bad and give him a bordetella vaccine if he hasn't had one.  Good Luck with your  new dog! :-)|`|seU9VwIJaa	It is most likely a "reverse sneeze". It's perfectly normal. Pugs, along with other dogs with snouts like theirs, do it often. My japanese chin does it and the first time I thought he was going to die! All should be well though! Congrats on your adoption!! =)|`|KxjUim7yaa	My pug used to do that. I think it is breathing something down the trachea and trying to clear it.|`|qqUvoC5uaa	Puggles can be a very dangerous mix.   Pugs are bracheophiliacs which means basically that they have a shortened snout and respiratory pathway. This can lead to a number of problems, including breathing trouble.   Beagles are notorious for their "reverse sneezes" which kind of sounds like what you have described there.     What you can do in this situation to help is gently stroke the dogs throat until it passes. This can help open the airways a bit better.     In a purebred beagle this is typical behaviour and usually nothing to worry about.   However I'd be concerned with the pug mixed in there simply because of their shortened respiratory path.
9f97f8a980cb5aa7360577720efbdd70aa	What exactly do you mean by "regular geese".  There are many different species of geese..so not sure what you are asking.
