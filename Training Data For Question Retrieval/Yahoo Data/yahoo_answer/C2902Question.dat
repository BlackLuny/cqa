20090203060913AAoePJ5	Environment;Global Warming	Why is it that the global warming debate never seems to mention the effect of Cold War nuclear arms testing?	Surely the hundreds of nuclear weapons tests that took place during this period have more to do with bringing about climate change than the total carbon emmissions output from global car ownership put together? Why is it that the environmental impact of these tests is always overlooked in the global warming debate?       Your thoughts?

20090220074043AAImwd9	Environment;Conservation	Why won't a magnetic power plant be introduced?	now the scarcity of electricity is an alarming problem in our country.   I think that a magnetic power plant can be introduced which will work with the principle of repulsive force between the magnets.i.e like charges repel each other.we can fix a powerful mega size magnet in the blades of the turbine with north pole facing outward.Now other powerful magnets(north pole facing outward) are placed facing each blades of the turbine.so due to the repulsive force,the turbine starts rotating.This is absolutely polution free and there is no need of external source.Am i right? Is it possible? .
