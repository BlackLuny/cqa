20090129040520AApHxeL	Pregnancy & Parenting;Pregnancy	Is smoking pot while pregnant bad?	My fiance is currently pregnant with our child. She's about 2 months along. She's been smoking Marijuana. I myself am STRAIGHT EDGE and I am completely against doing any kind of drugs but I refuse to force my beliefs on her.   I am worried that smoking Pot could cause problems for her health and the child. But than again I have a friend who is the biggest pot head I have ever known and her child was fine when she gave birth. No problems what so ever.  She smokes pot to help with her anxiety and morning sickness... Soooo... Should I stop worrying??? Or should I ask her to limit herself onto how much she smokes.

My boyfriend and I tried getting pregnant for over a year, but nothing. So finally he left, he said "he isn't going to marry a woman that can't bear children".

At about 6 weeks we started a bedtime routine and things were going great.  Last week he started sleeping through the night.  Suddenly, this week his routine has gone haywire.  He wakes almost every hour at night now.        I have read this is a common occurance at this age.  Has anyone experienced it and do you have an advice on how to get him back on his routine?

20090129042256AAtSS5o	Pregnancy & Parenting;Pregnancy	How high should a fever be to be concerned when pregnant?	I think I have the flu. I'm 11 weeks and have not had the slightest bit of morning sickness. Overall my pregnancy has been absolutely wonderful and stress free.      Yesterday around 2:30 pm, my nose started itching and I started sneezing like crazy. Over the next hour and a half, i felt like I was crashing. My nose would not stop draining, my throat got tender and felt like it was closing up and my head felt like it was filled with expanding cement. I took a tylenol and passed out. A few hours later (around 2:30 this morning) I woke up, took a bath and went back to bed. about 20 minutes after that I got extremely nauseous and threw up for the first time during my entire pregnancy. I drank some water and tried to go back to sleep.      Now I'm in too much pain to sleep. My head  feels 5 sizes too big, my body aches and I have a fever of  99.3. (my usual is around 97.7) and I feel EXTREMELY nauseous.      My question is how high should a temp be before getting concerned. I plan on calling my doctor in a few hours when they open, but I dont want to let this go if i might be hurting my baby. All answers are appreciated. Thanks!

20090129041804AATsdGw	Pregnancy & Parenting;Trying to Conceive	Could a short(ish) luteal phase be the cause of my miscarriages?	I have never properly tracked an ovulatory cycle until just now, and now I have, I discover that my luteal phase is 11 days long.      Now I know that it's under 10 days that is considered 'short' but I've also read that a 10 or 11 day luteal phase is 'potentially' a problem.      I have been pregnant 3 times.   - First pregnancy - no problems at all. Carried my son full term.   - Second pregnancy. Blighted ovum but the sac carried on developing and I only found out there was no baby when I had a scan at 9.5 weeks.   - Third pregnancy - saw a heartbeat at 6 weeks, but started bleeding a few days later and had a miscarriage at 7 weeks.      Could my short-ish luteal phase have contributed to my miscarriages? Or does a short luteal phase only result in very early miscarriages - i.e. before implantation has fully occurred?      And before anyone says 'ask your doctor' -I don't have a doctor as such to ask about this. In the UK you are only referred to a ob.gyn if you have 3 consecutive miscarriages. Until the I am under the care of my GP and I really don't think he would know much about this sort of thing.

20090129042017AAGVSDH	Pregnancy & Parenting;Newborn & Baby	Need to get some sleep?	I have a 3 week old, a 2 yo, and a 5 yo. I'm so exhausted. The baby doesn't sleep very good at night yet. I'm up with her just about every hour until the older kids are waking up. Then she finally falls asleep and stays that way for 3 - 4 hour stretches. I just want 2 curl up beside her but can't because I've got to get one off to school and take care of a wide open toddler. My question is how do you manage all of your kids day and night without neglecting anybody when you're sooo tired? And when did things begin to settle into a routine and become easier to manage? Any help will be much appreciated, feeling a bit overwhelmed! Thanks.

20090129041822AARopiD	Pregnancy & Parenting;Parenting	How to fly our babies over here?	You may have seen my other Qs, but long story short, found out my fiance of just 2 days (Bf of 4.5 years though.) has twin kids. They were concieved while he was on a 2week vacation and we were on a break. He never saw the woman again. She died last week, (Yes, at just 19.) And he is all these babies have. We wanted to find out ASAP if my fiance is the father, so his sample for the paternity test was sent over there by air mail, and arrived overnight, they got the test straight away, and he is the daddy!! So, now these kids are coming to live with us. He has legal custody already or something because she legally left them to him. Idk. I don't get it. (Yes, we will be checking all this.)   Anyway, The kids have been staying with a friend of the grandmothers for a week. (Grandma is unable to care for them.)    So their in CA, And we are from NY.    They are only three. Should we...      a) Send my fiance over there to get them. fly back same day?   b) send them on their way themselves?      We will make sure people on the plane know they are there by themselves, they always look after them? We just dont have $$$$ to spend on airfares. Thanks. xx

20090129041554AAEOH5j	Pregnancy & Parenting;Pregnancy	How far along am I in my pregnancy?	My husband and I found out we were pregnant on December 19, 2008.  Since then I have had the confirmation doctors appointment and then another yesterday (Jan 28).  At yesterday's appointment I received my first sonogram and pictures and I am thrilled!!! It all feels real now... and to hear my child's heartbeat was the most amazing sound.  I couldn't really say much because I was in such awe and really felt as if I was about to cry.  L o l, anyway, I am kinda getting away from my question, I'm sorry.  According to the L M P date I am 11 weeks and 1 day today but on my sonogram yesterday it said 9 weeks and 4 days.  The doctor said that the discrepancy was not unusual and we would stick with my original due date of August 19 and just know that the pregnancy could go for a little longer than that.  I am confused about how far along I am.  I had so many questions yesterday that this one just slipped my mind and I was hoping someone could help me with at least an explanation of the difference.  As I am sure most of you have realized this is our first pregnancy so we have several things we are confused, awed, and inspired by.  Thanks to everyone that tries to explain the answer to my question!!  I hope you all have a spectacular day!

20090129044337AATNm2F	Pregnancy & Parenting;Toddler & Preschooler	What do I do in this situation?	My husband recently deployed leaving me to play the role of single mom for the next four months. However, I feel like I can't get anything done. My 8 month old won't sleep through the night because he wakes up to nurse, and I haven't gotten more than 3 hours of sleep a night for the past week. I try to lay down at naptime when they do, but the past three days have had people knocking on my door, calling my phone, or my dog starts barking when he hears the neighbor kids start playing in the back yard. My house is trashed because I can't get anything done while the boys are awake (ex. I try and do laundry and my oldest son takes an entire stack of laundry I just folded and dumps it on the floor), but in order to get anything done it requires me to either put them in a corral-type enclosure in the living room, resulting in them screaming for however long it takes me to get something done. The neighbors have already complained to the housing office (I live in base housing) about how I just let my kids cry all the time (which isn't true) so letting them just cry it out isn't an option. By the end of the night and the boys are in bed, I am too exhausted to do anything but fall into bed fully clothed and just get to the point of dozing off before one of them wakes up. So to sum it up, my house is trashed, my kids are unhappy, I am stressed to the point I just feel like screaming, I don't have any family for friends that can come over and help, and I don't know what to do.......

20090129044805AAMswco	Pregnancy & Parenting;Newborn & Baby	Hysterical baby at bedtime...?	For the past few weeks my daughter has been hysterical when i put her into her cot at bedtime and leave the room. Usually i will feed her, when she becomes drowsy i put her into the cot awake and she will drift off to sleep, but for weeks now bedtime has turned into a nightmare when she realises i have left the room. So i have been going back up to her and reassuring her and most of the time lifting her out until she calms down and falls asleep then put her back in. I know this is probably the wrong thing to do and now she expects me to hold her until she falls asleep. At my wits end, last night i just left her to cry and after 15 mins she fell asleep but kept wakening up every few hours after that which she never does. She has been teething and cut 4 teeth over the past few weeks, could it be teething related or is she just doing this for attention? Has anyone else experienced this and how did you resolve it?oh she is 11 months by the way!

Yesterday (our second snow day at home) after he ate lunch, I was just letting him wander around the house while I fixed myself some lunch.  I wasn't really paying attention, I could hear him, so I knew he was okay.  Next thing I know, I heard some paper rustling around and was like what has he gotten into?  I put down the stuff that was in my hands and looked for him but couldn't see him... I called him and he responded, but I still couldn't figure out where he was.  I knew he was close, I just couldn't figure out where.      I finally opened the pantry door - and the little booger had closed himself in there and had gotten the huge bag of chocolate chips (we like to bake in our family) and was sitting there eating handfuls of them, with chocolate dripping down his chin!      I couldn't do anything but stand there and laugh at him.      He's 15 months.      Has your child done anything silly lately?  How old are they?

I know this is NOT a high fever and ordinarily, I wouldn't be worried. I am just worried because it went up after treatment. That isn't right.

She has no interest in an exersaucer anymore, I don't want to use a walker (they don't seem safe in this house) and I can't keep propping up couch cushions to keep her from bumping into things, because she just pulls them down or crawls over them. She also refuses to be in the playpen for more than 10 minutes.      so I guess my question is, while I am babyproofing the house, is there any kind of play station thing I can purchase for her that will allow her to move freely and still be safely contained? The problem I'm facing is that I am currently house-sitting through April so I really can't rearrange too much. I want to keep her safe and not have her destroy anything that doesn't belong to me :)
20090129052714AAQYDiW	Pregnancy & Parenting;Parenting	Left alone at the bus stop!! he's only 5!!?	I am so d*mn furious!! my daughter works 8-5 she has a sitter that comes and gets my grandson after school, well yesterday he was to attend a after school program "happy day club" and the sitter planned to pick him up at school after that, well the teacher put him on the bus and sent him home!!!! he was standing outside by hisself for approx 45 min in 20 degree weather!! Thank god the apartment manager saw him and went and got him, took him to office to warm up, she contacted my daughter and told her what was going on, my daughter calls the school and you would not believe how they are treating her!! they tell her it is his fault that he did not remind the teacher and that if he could not be responsible maybe he doesn't need to go the the club, and the principal says he feels sorry for the teacher because she now has to call other parents because she had FORGOT and sent 3 other students home on the bus as well!! they said "well i am glad nothing happened to him he is a cute little guy" WTF??  I AM P*SSED   in the meantime the sitter is freakin out because she can't find him and luckily the apartment manager noticed her driving around the complex   this is just absolutely ridiculous!!  they are placing the blame on my grandson, he is only 5 how is it his fault??i told my daughter they are treating her like that bcuz she is young and wait until i call them!! hopefully my grandbaby doesn't have frostbite, she said his feet socks and shoes were soaked and his feet were beet red!  everytime i think about it i want to cry the poor little thing he must have been scared to death, and she asked him if he went to their house and he said "no mommy, i'm not allowed to cross the street," thank god the baby does listen to his mom sometimes. if you were in our shoes what would you do???

20090129050237AAa2Bd4	Pregnancy & Parenting;Parenting	South Australia - advice on gaining sole custody of my child?	My sons father lives in a different state to my son and I. He has never met my son but will be visiting in march. He wants unsupervised visits after only 6 hours of contact, which I have denied. I dont really know his father, neither does my son, and I wont be handing my son over to a stranger, regardless of the fact he is biologically his.   I know that if things go bad and he does manage to get his son alone, he may take him back interstate with him. Neither of us has full sole custody, we are both listed as parents on his birth certificate.   How do I go about getting an order to make me sole guardian to ensure he legally cannot take my son away from me?

20090129045659AAkScUl	Pregnancy & Parenting;Pregnancy	18 Weeks Pregnant - Boyfriend got put in Jail Yesterday!?	My Boyfriend was in a gang fight back in 2007. It was pretty Big and only about 10 of the 40 got caught. It went to court and has been going on for ages - about 14/15 months now.   So Yesterday was the final case, we both thought he would get Tag or something like that as there were so many involved and it was so long ago. But he got put in prison for 15 months, 7 and half good behaviour and could be 5 and half shortest out on Tag.   I don't know what the hell I am going to do, Im devastated like you cant imagine. He has grown up so much in the last year and was getting everything sorted for us and the baby. He is so Lovely and good to me.   My baby is due on the 28th June so 5 months - He is going to miss everything, my 20 week scan on the 10th Feb and worst of all the Birth.   I  feel so distraught - he doesn't belong in prison, he really isn't that sort of person especially not now.   I have family and friends but I just feel so alone - he is my best friend we do everything together.   I haven't even heard from him since before he went to court so I don't even know how he is doing, He got took away last night.   What am I going to do? Has anyone else had anything like this happen to them? How did you cope?   I am 20 in a couple weeks and my boyfriend is 22 next month.   20 when the fight happened.      Please don't leave horrible comments - we all make mistakes and sadly my boyfriend as to pay for his by going to prison and not being there at his childs birth.      I love him so much and Im going to miss him like you cant imagine.      Some of you may know me on here always asking questions, my name is chanelle.   For some reason my other yahoo account got took away so I had to start again yesturday! Great Huh!!   Thanks for reading, I Just need to get all this of my chest.       I just want to stay strong for the sake of our baby but its so hard! Does stress and worry effect the baby alot?   xxxxx

20090129051621AA0TsrS	Pregnancy & Parenting;Newborn & Baby	Final question about breastfeeding?	Hi all,      I posted a couple of questions on this subject (BREAST MILK DRYING UP. HELP!!! and (BABY FORGOTTEN HOW TO SUCKLE BREAST. HELP!!!) and I think I am just about ready to give up ?      Okay, so baby is still able to tolerate being at the breast for a few mins, however does not want to eat but rather plays with my nipples and sometimes bites.  I do not shout or act like it is uncomfortable as I don’t want to scare baby.      Now I just noticed that when baby was able to play with it for a while then some milk came through and was quite put off with it.  I am not quite sure why and I wonder whether it is because had just eaten (formula) or whether does not understand why milk is coming from boobie.  Not sure.  I know that baby is okay with the taste of breast milk because will take it in a bottle so that’s not the problem.      Baby is 5 months.      I am trying to express as often as I can but I must be honest that this is not very easy so I think that if this carries on, the milk will eventually dry up.         I am wondering:      1) Shall I continue trying?  I have been trying to put to breast after food because I don’t want to do this when baby is hungry and will get frustrated because hungry and not enough food.      2) Do I keep at it?  It is very tiring and sometimes a bit heartbreaking, but I don’t want to waste time and energy if baby is not going to get the hang of breastfeeding again.      3) Has any one had this problem? and is there any hope?      What do you advice?      Thank you

20090129053241AAfCeWD	Pregnancy & Parenting;Parenting	Would you disown your sister if she kept allowing her loser bf's to disrespect you?	I have tried everything. Talking to her nicely...telling my family...but she , without fail, has been with guys who disrespect me. They are the type of guys who treat her like crap and feel they can control me and treat me that way too. Whenever I bring it up to her she is RUDE as usual and says " I don't have time for you".   How can someone act like that to their family? She has also pushed my family to the side so many times it's insane and yet they gripe to me and NEVER do anything about it. If I bring it up I am the "angry" daughter. What ever happened to family loyalty?   Her bf's are so ridiculous that they have sent me nasty messages on facebook and then went into her profile and blocked me. SHE DOES NOTHING.    I've had it...she simply does not care. I don't believe in disowning family but I can't deal with the anger in my life. It's like watching someone murder someone else and the police won't listen to you and keep brushing you off (ok extreme but an example.)      Like, I truly can't even deal with this..and she's my younger sister. I'm 23 and she is now 21 and living under my parents hold. She denied me on myspace and facebook so many times for no reason..and I didn't get it..I thought you have your family and close friends on there..and she never says anything..she just texts me messages and says " I'm not accepting your request".       At this point I have to admit I am getting pretty bitter and would like to just blow her and my mom off in general b/c my mom aids this behavior.

20090129052901AAWRdKH	Pregnancy & Parenting;Newborn & Baby	Washing baby clothes in baby detergent vs regular detergent?	Ok, at my baby shower my SIL gave me a bottle of baby detergent. I didn't really understand why but used it anyway. I've used it all up since then, obviously, and just started using my regular Gain detergent to wash the baby clothes. Now I just read an answer to a question that said washing baby clothes in a certain detergent was causing their child to cough. Well my son has been fighting a cold for a couple of months now with lots of sinus congestion and coughing and I'm wondering if the detergent could possibly be worsening his symptoms. And even if it's not the detergent causing the symptoms, is it still so bad to use regular detergent on my baby's clothes? He's 3.5 months old by the way.

20090129051427AAYR6sF	Pregnancy & Parenting;Adolescent	Why is it that your whole life can be messed up within seconds :(?	On tuesday i drove down to see my boyfriend (he lives 20 miles from me) but i stayed at my best friends house instead of his..  I went to see him that night but for some reason i wouldnt let him go near me and in the end i got in a mood and sat in my car for over an hour..  The next day i was telling my best friend that i didnt think i could be with him anymore and i didnt want to see him.. But the stupid thing is, i didnt want to tell him so i decided i would just drive home.  I got about a mile through my journey and i was thinking what the hell am i doing, and i turned around and went back to see him.. I realised how much i love him and want to be with him and the thought of losing him frightened the life out of me.  But the night before when he thought he had lost me he was texting my friend asking how i was.. but at the end of the texts he was like i love you loads and loads and tell laura i love her too..   And they always playfight with each other, and last night it was going all well and then me and my bf were playfighting and he really hurt me.. (by accident) so i bit him and my best friend said oi dont hurt him and that p*ssed me off really bad so i just flipped out and said you two both piss me off you are obviously in love with each other.. And i stormed out the house and drove home..    Anyway.. my best mate hates me now (not really bothered she betrayed me)   And she told my boyfriend everything i said about him but made up more and said stuff like i hate him and ive never been happy with him and stuff like that.. So my boyfriend text me saying its over and i couldnt stop crying!   I cant believe my best friend would do this to me.. Shes ruined my life, and stole my boyfriend.. I promised him i didnt say that stuff and he said she wouldnt bullsh*t me.. but she IS and i dont know what to do to make him believe me.  He told me he needs to think things through but i still dont know what to do because hes still friends with my best friend and its gonna be awkward.    What should i do? And does anyone know why i could have felt the way i did when i wouldnt go near him? that really confused me!    Please help me :(

Just curiousity on my part,  don't read the question as harsh; it's not meant to be.  We do live in a world where human overpopulation has stripped resources and left many starving.  Many species are now extinct or freefalling in that direction due to habitat loss from human populations encroaching on critical habitat.  How can you having a big family fix these problems?

20090129063107AAT8bXC	Pregnancy & Parenting;Pregnancy	How long can this last?	I apologize for being rude in my last question. Anyways, My boyfriend and I found out we are expecting on the 22nd. We had intercourse on the 25th, a few hours later I began to spot. It stopped on the 28th. But, when I woke up to go to the bathroom, I wiped and there was blood again. I'm not too concerned about this because I have done plenty of research and found that spotting can occur after intercourse in early pregnancy. As long as it doesn't get heavier, there are no clots and I'm not having any pain, I'm fine, tho I should tell my doctor. That's the thing, I have no medical, so I have not yet seen a doctor, but hopefully soon, by end of this week. My question is, how long after intercourse can spotting last?

I know its normal for kids to be sick alot because they are around alot of children but Im thinking my son might get sick too often? Im considering brining him in but thought Id check here first. He had a fever last thursday and now its back. My mom visited for 3 weeks and my son has been sick twice during her visit. My daughter on the other hand(7yo) rarely gets sick, no matter how sick any of the rest of us get. I attribute that to her having been been breast fed. Anyway, my son probably gets sick every month, not just little runny noses. Im worried, something may be very wrong with his immune system. Any thoughts from now until we see dr.?

It's really weird because my period is supposed to come in about a week & I had the gummy ovulation discharge & the egg - white discharge a couple weeks ago, but then I got a mix between both of them on Sunday.  It was like gummy & stretchy, but somewhat looked like egg - white discharge.  Is it possible that I was still ovulating?  We never use condoms & I came off the pill quite a few months ago .. & we had sex Sunday quite a few times, Monday quite a few times, Tuesday quite a few times, & then yesterday quite a few times.  We are in fact trying to conceive.  He was away when I had the gummy ovulation discharge about 2 weeks ago though, so we couldn't have sex then, but we had sex about a week before that.  I'm kind of confused, is it possible to ovulate for that long, could I in fact have gotten pregnant? Thanks for your help in advance, :]   xxo.

My son has had eczema on his body and face since he was 3 months old and have been to numerous trips to the Doctor for numerous creams and bath oils to ease the flare-ups and weeping. Some of the eczema will go away completely for a couple of weeks only to appear somewhere else like his elbows or legs or scalp. It is only now that my Doctor has refered us to see a skin specialist after all this time! I know there is not much i can do but wait until he grows out of it but I would like to hear similar stories if your baby had bad eczema and what you did to ease it? Does it really go away when they reach 2 or 3 years old? did you find out what triggered the eczema in the first place?

20090129054245AAC781D	Pregnancy & Parenting;Grade-Schooler	I think my 6yr old is hypochondriaciact, She says she is always sick.( long question sorry)?	My beautiful daughter is 6 yrs old. Her life started out sickly. She was premature, then developed severe jaundice, which required her to go back to the hospital, Then RSV (respiratory syncial virus).Which almost killed her at 4 months old. She was hospitalized for RSV for almost 11 weeks. It damaged her lungs, so now she suffers from Asthma. The list could go on and on. She has been doing fine other then a few colds here and there, But everyday she has been asking the teacher to go to the nurse. Either her stomach hurts, her eye hurts, something hurts or she doesn't feel good. She doesn't complain about a single thing until bed time EACH night and when she is walking out the door for school. I have kept her home a few times and there is nothing wrong with her. No vomiting no fever, just wanting to eat and play. How do i correct this behavior, i know i am tired of getting calls from the nurse as i am sure the teacher is tired of sending her.       Last night we were talking about how she is not going to ask unless she is throwing up, and she said fine i wont go if my belly hurts but can i ask her to feel my head? i think it is hot some times.

20090129062655AAXyfoz	Pregnancy & Parenting;Parenting	Moms what would you do if you were me? Please help me I dont know anymore?	Okey so here it goes,   My son had a rotovirus for about a week, which was about a month ago, than he got a cold, and our doctor didnt see anything that needs to be done during those two weeks because my son seemed to be playing fine, and he didn't have a fever. Than all of a sudden he started getting a high fever about 103.5 and we saw a boil on his buttcheek close to his anus. We went to the doctor and sure it was a boil and a full ear infection in both ears. She sent us to the hospital and all they did was give him some medecine and told us that the boil will go away since it drained, two days after that we landed back in the hospital because his fever was going to 104, and was throwing the medicine up, and guess what they forgot to write in on monday that he had an ear infection, even though my doctor told them so. So they gave him another medecine, and gave him a shot for his ears, than on thursday I saw my doctor again cause he had diarrhea all over, she didnt really do anything just gave him a cream. On friday I saw the a doctor at the hospital for his boil, and becasue he was throwing the medecine up, and they decided to leave him in the hospital, but then when they started filling in the papers all of a suddent they sent us home with a different medecine. (I think it was the public insurance that was the problem). My doctor gave him another shot for his ears, and they did all the blood tests. On monday I realized that he might have a yeast infection near his genitals and my doctor called me with the results and guess what it was yeast infection. So today is two weeks since the first hospital visit and since the boil first appeared. My boil keeps on appearing and disappearing, and my son is running a fever of about 100.5 from time to time. He says his head hurts, and his butt hurts, and he has really bad green, horribly smelling diarhea like never before, I am seeing our doctor tomorrow. What do you guys think, and what would you do? I am just so fed up with all the doctors, and my son being miserable and them not doing anything? Please help

20090129062941AA93zl4	Pregnancy & Parenting;Trying to Conceive	ERRRRGGGGHHH!!!!! I just don't know anymore!!!!?	Hi Ladies,      I'm just getting frustrated because I don't think I ovulated this month. I finished my second round of Clomid 50 mg, my first cycle I ovulated CD 17. This cycle I'm on CD 21 and fertility friend has not detected ovulation yet. I got a few high readings on my clear blue fertility monitor and then two peak readings on CD 12 & 13.      I was a little confused about the times I was taking my BBT, so I asked a question about that on Yahoo Answers and everyone was saying that I needed to try to take my temp at the same time daily. So on CD 10 (which was the day after my last Clomid pill) until present I have been taking my temp at the same time daily.But fertility friend hasn't detected ovulation yet. So I'm wondering if I might ovulate later this cycle. I just don't understand why I would get those two peak readings on my monitor and not ovulate. I didn't get peak readings the last cycle at all and ovulated so I'm just not understanding. I even went the extra step and used Preseed this time around to give me and my hubby a boost. So I really thought this was our month.       I have an appointment with my doctor next friday to see how things are coming along with Clomid. I guess I will talk to her about what is going on.      I guess I just need some advice and encouragement. Just let me know your experiences or any advice.      Good luck to all you ttc'ers and all of you mommy to be's!!!!

Of course I am a first time mom and everything worries me. =]      I am almost 4 months pregnant and I felt some suspious activity in my tummy. There has been lil pushes [for lack of a better way to say it] to the left of my belly button and then earlier to the far right of my belly button. Is this the baby kicking? I've never felt anything like this before.

20090129053833AAO8aWG	Pregnancy & Parenting;Newborn & Baby	Double standard at the doctor's office concerning use of medicine with babies?	As most of you probably already are aware based on the majority of my questions, my son has been battling a cold for 2 months. I've taken him to the doctor every time his symptoms get worse. Maybe about 3 times. The first time the doctor prescribed him albuderol (sp?) to be given through an aerochamber (a mask that fits on the face and the medicine is sprayed into the chamber to be breathed in through the mask). My son hates anything on his face and the medicine didn't seem to work so I stopped putting him through the torture for nothing. This week his symptoms got worse again so it was back to the doctor's office. I've been withholding giving him OTC medicine because everyone is so against using it in babies. This doctor (different from before) prescribed him albuderol again (even after I told her it didn't work the first time) but gave me a nebulizer to use instead. I asked her if there was an OTC she would recommend instead but she refused. So instead I went to the store on my own and just got him children's tylenol for cold. I hate the nebulizer because the medicine pretty much knocks him out. Well, the tylenol worked perfectly. I gave him about 2-3 drops and that was it. Congestion gone, coughing stopped, it was perfect. So, my question for all of you out there, why do doctor's give a baby PRESCRIPTION-STRENGTH medicine but refuse to suggest OTC, which is obviously not going to be as strong as a prescription?

20090129055836AANYEuO	Pregnancy & Parenting;Other - Pregnancy & Parenting	Why would you willingly damn your innocent BABY to a LIFE IN GAOL?	Research at an American university shows that boys who are given unusual names are far more likely than their more fortunate peers to commit crimes.      I had never heard the daft, made-up ‘name’ “Jayden” until I saw it in here about a year ago.  Then I noted that one of the teenaged thugs that gang-raped a disabled girl over Christmas was called ‘Jayden’!      So why would you give your innocent child a silly name that will make them a laughing-stock as a child and a failure in adulthood?  Vanity?

20090129064120AA8KKxQ	Pregnancy & Parenting;Pregnancy	Could I be pregnant even if I'm ovulating?	My boyfriend and I had sex three times this month. The first was when I was having my period. The second was 5 days after my period ended and the third was 11 days after my period. We never used a condom for all the three intercourses, however, he never ejaculated in me. I understand that pre-ejaculate may get me pregnant, and I fear that I might be. I experienced some mild abdominal cramps that started about 5 days ago, which lasted for about 3 days. Now, my breasts are sore and tender. Furthermore, I'm experiencing a weird feeling in my throat - it's like the walls have thickened up and it's making me harder to breathe and want to throw up. I've never thrown up though. Another thing that confuses me is the secretions my vagina is giving out. White viscous secretions started coming out 2 days ago (not the clear stretchy ones). This is a sign of ovulation right? So my question is, is it possible that I'm pregnant even with me "ovulating" after the intercourse?

20090129070356AABvzFw	Pregnancy & Parenting;Parenting	My 5 yr old snores heavily, is this normal?	For a long time now my 5yr old son has snored very heavily at night. I know a lot of kids may snore if they're blocked up and such but he snores every night, very loudly, often with snorting sounds. It's just as loud as an adult snoring and I can even hear it through his bedroom wall. He's otherwise well but does and always has had very large tonsils, he's had about 4 bouts of tonsilitis in the last 2 years.   Just wondering if anyone else has experienced this with their children and whether it's normal or something that should be looked into further?   Thanks.

20090129071326AAmWvpb	Pregnancy & Parenting;Parenting	Is it hypocritical that you do things immoral in your life and you forbid your children from the same?	I just asked a question whether a woman, as a mother, would tell her kids (if they asked her for advice) as to how many men she slept with before she got married. Nearly 90% of those responded were reluctant to say how many men they slept with. Only those who had sex with the child's father were happy to say "it was only your father".       The others were willing to lie, or to avoid the subject. And this is a child that is seeking advice.       Therefore, I cannot help but get the idea that we have one set of ideals or values for ourselves and one for our kids. That is hypocrisy!!    Isn't it??      If you are going to do something that you know will bring embarrassement to your children, i don't think you should be doing it.       I honestly think that we've become a society of liers and misfits.

20090129065806AAdZFxe	Pregnancy & Parenting;Toddler & Preschooler	My Child's Caregiver Physically Hurt Her...?	I am a member of a school for children from 0-5.  This school is for low income families and we are enrolled in one of their programs.  A person (she is not a teacher) comes and teaches trough playing the colors, numbers, and reading to my child one a week.  The school has a 4 star rating from the state.  My baby who is 2 and 9 months can be annoying and hard to control.  While I had a meeting at the school the caregiver watched over her for an hour.  When I came back my baby look at me relieved and sad.  She gave me a look like she felt humiliated or embarrassed.  When we got out of the school my baby told me that the caregiver cleaned her tears really hard.  She does not talk that much, so all she did was with sign language and she also said "like this (and said that persons name)" Her eyes were red.  How convenient to hurt her like that she was crying.  I feel betrayed and feel it will be hard to prove she did anything to my baby.  She had never done something like this.  She will lose her job if this is discovered, but how do I prove it.  I don't know what to do.  My baby was to start going to that school full time when she turns 3.  I cant do it anymore. She is coming to my house today, I had though of just talking to her about it but I know my baby deserves more then that.  Will I be able to prove it.  She knows where we live too and that scares me.

So yesterday when i was making something to eat i felt really dizzy so i had to sit down for a while, felt better after i ate, but then later while i was finishing up washing dishes, the dizziness came again. i attributed it to waiting too long to eat the first time, and the hot water overheating me the second time. today i felt it a little as i was going to the caf at my job to get breakfast, and now an hour later, after eating, im just sitting at my desk typing and im starting to feel weird and light-headed again...what should i do? i just want some opinions on what this may be before i call my doc, and if its important enough to call my doc

Ive tried smacking his hand but that doesnt phase him ive tried popping him on the butt but that doesnt phase him either. What can i do?? Is he to young for time out?  Also i was told that terrible 2's can start anywhere from 18 months-24 months, could he be starting already??

20090129071709AAkErJG	Pregnancy & Parenting;Parenting	Would you be annoyed/worried?	My 16 month old daughter was in daycare today (i was working) and when i went to pick her up the first thing i noticed when i walked in was that it felt like a sauna (it was 43/109.4 here today), when i got to her room to pick her up the room leader told me the air conditioning had been out since 12pm (it was just after 3 when i picked her up). Initially i didn't really think about it but once i got home i though"shouldn't they have called all the parents and informed them of this?" Im annoyed that i didn't have the choice to take her out and bring her home to our air conditioned home and am going to be saying something next week........am i over reacting?

20090129091548AAutaXA	Pregnancy & Parenting;Pregnancy	37 weeks, what is going on with me!?	I'm 37 weeks, 1 day pregnant and TOTALLY over it.  I've felt like I've had really bad PMS (of all things) for about 4 days now.  It's complete with the back ache, mild cramps, crying fits and mood swings.  This morning I had one bad cramp.  I don't really want to call the doctor because I don't want to be that girl that thinks shes going into labor every 20 minutes for the last three weeks of her pregnancy.  I guess my question is what the hell is going on!? Is this over all feeling like crap early early early labor or is it just wishful thinking?? Should I call the doctor or just wait until my appointment tomorrow?
20090129070457AAXv721	Pregnancy & Parenting;Pregnancy	Color hair while pregnant?	I am two and a half months pregnant and wanted to see if any of you has information about coloring hair (if you can do it or just shouldn’t). I was told that most salons have dyes that are not harmful to the baby, but I am more interested in the kind you do yourself at home (L’Oreal etc). Any help would be great.    Also, I heard that it’s ok to color hair after the third month but am not sure. The color I checked out in the drugstore didn’t say “do not use while pregnant” but neither did it say “safe to use while pregnant” so obviously I’d like to be sure.

20090129063028AAdJyA3	Pregnancy & Parenting;Pregnancy	Pregnant with Jury Duty Summons and First prenatal Appt same date and time?	I have my first Dr. Appt.  2/25.  However this morning, I received a Jury Duty Summons for the same date and time.  The thing is, I miscarried before and if I cancel this appointment, I have to wait until later in March for a rescheduled appt.  I am terribly nervous about losing this baby anyway, and I don't think I could wait an extra month to see my doctor!  It's not that I am trying to get out of jury duty, if it were any other day or time I wouldn't care.  I tried to call all the numbers listed for the Jury Summons office but can not reach anyone.  I called my doctor and she said that she would write an excuse but my question is, what are my chances of being excused?

20090129061825AAdVHBB	Pregnancy & Parenting;Parenting	What is the best way to get babies to get along?	Lol.      Well I have this friend who has a 14 month old son, and now a new 2 week old. We used to hang out while her son was younger, but Brody was also so small that they never interacted..   But now that Brody is walking, they can actually play.      But there is a problem..Her son isnt nice to Brody at all!!   And Im thinking it is because he isnt around other babies.   Brody goes to a home daycare and the kids and babies are nice there.       But Julius (14 mo old) will just walk right over to Brody and shove him down, Brody gives him a look of surprise, and gets right back up lol   Julius will walk over and try and SIT on Brody!! Over and over!   He pulls his hair! He grabs his clothes and yanks him!   So it turned me into overprotective mommy mode, and I said they had to stay seperated if he was going to keep being mean to Brody, because he even made him cry, and aww Brody's little face, he was soo sad!    Brody is even taller than Julius, but Brody wasnt being mean back at all! (my good little boy lol)      SO what would be the ways to go about getting them to get along?   The best way to approach Julius?   Just tell him No and to be nice, every time??   Has anyone dealt with this before?

20090129063110AAtRWUe	Pregnancy & Parenting;Grade-Schooler	I have a really SASSY, BOSSY, RUDE and Overbearing 9 year old daughter - what can I do about it? parenting ?	My nine year old daughter is about the sassiest girl I have ever come into contact with and I just don't know what I am doing wrong.  I constantly give consequences for the rolling the eyes, telling her brother to shut-up, yelling everything, bullying her brother (he is 11).  The list can go on and on.  Her brother is very soft spoken and doesn't have an ounce of sassiness in him.  Part of this I attribute to a boy v/s girl difference.  Also, the girls in her class are also very sassy, they lie, they don't have strong friendships (one day they are friends the next day they are enemies).        My daughter has always been very easily influenced by those around her (everyone except myself, my husband and her brother).  She picks up on Spanish accents when she gets a Spanish friend, she has other dialect nuances to her speech based upon who she has been a friend to.  I can just tell how her teacher speaks based upon characteristics that she comes up with since she has been in this teacher's class (for example, whatever word ends the sentence, the teacher (and my daughter) will really emphasize the ending sound of the last word in any given sentence.      It is because she is so impressionable that she picks up loads and loads of bad habits from the children that she is in contact with in school.  I need to debrief her all the time and I am finding that it is a struggle that I am not winning.      I have cut out all current day tv shows  (she cannot watch Hannah Montana, Drake and Josh, Icarly etc.).  I had limited them before but because she picks up things like 'jerk', 'shut-up', teasing, etc.   I just don't let her watch them at all.      I have tried to encourage her to do things that won't impact her this way - for example, reading, crafts etc.  That works fine but it is only as good as my available time and even then the communication can easily break down with her telling me 'wait, wait - I will do it, that is not right'.  In other words, she tries to treat me like she is equal to me or above me.      That is her background.  Mine is that I am a certified teacher (k-9).  Have had a wealth of experience with children and honest to goodness I have never experienced such an ongoing difficulty such as this.      Any advise, tips, etc. would be greatly appreciated.  Because I have to continually deal with this with her and NEVER have to deal with it with my son, my relationship with my son is smooth and amicable, loving and friendly.  My relationship with her is strained and stressful, on guard and defensive.  I don't want it to be that way but I tried 'choosing my battles' and found that I was enabling her to do destructive behaviors that were not fair to anyone else in the family.      One other thing, she has a tendency to start friendships with soft-speaking, sweet girls and those friendships end basically after the first play-date.  She is so overbearing and bossy.  I try to intervene and role model along with the girls and she still walks all over any soft-spoken friend.      Help please....

20090128223540AAtNJlg	Pregnancy & Parenting;Trying to Conceive	4 days later question... Stress? Help me please?!?	I had unprotected sex saturday night/ sunday morning, possibly around ovulation time, i'm not sure, i'm really irregular. I'm not 16 and don't need to be told to use condoms thanks. My problem is also not an STD as we've been together quite awhile without seeing other people... ok.       Well now its almost exactly 4 days later and the semen and all has come out of me already but I'm still really wet down there, more than usual and am having some cramping. The wetness isn't an actual discharge, its normal except for a bit more of it. And the cramping isn't bad, just enough to notice and know its not gas.       I know its too early for implantation or anything but does anyone know what this is? I don't believe its my period, I can just tell, its a different feeling.      Could it be because of me being stressed out? Does stress cause cramps? Would the cramping prevent an egg from implanting?      Thanks!! =)

20090129065800AA1FR5r	Pregnancy & Parenting;Trying to Conceive	Could I be pregnant and not have any symptoms?	Okay so I am four days late as of today.  No period and no spotting, absolutely nothing.  The only things that I have is a semi high cervix (which is really soft and closed), watery/lotion like CM, tired (but only at the end of the day I am fine while at work), and bloated.  Other than that I feel fine. My breasts feel full but don't hurt, I am not puking my brains out, and I am not so tired I can't stand up straight. I tested at 14 dpo and got a negative. I am waiting till I am pretty much a week late to test. I will probably test on Sunday which would make me 6 days late.  So what do you think?

I know everyone will say don't worry or stress it will happen when you stop trying and until yesterday when i found out we weren't (I was almost positive that we were!)

I just want a baby... Any suggestions or helpful comments would be appreciated
20090129084904AAq2zS5	Pregnancy & Parenting;Newborn & Baby	How do I deal with my "needy" baby?	I don't believe you can spoil a newborn.  But I do think that my daughter is very particular about things.  She is almost 3 months old and she only goes to me at times, not even my husband.  I joke around that "she wants to stay close to the food source" as I am breastfeeding.  She is fine with the babysitter while I'm at work and fine with my husband if I am not home.  She will sit in her swing or bouncy chair without complaint.  But if she sees me or what not, she flips out if I'm not holding her.  She will not even let me go to the bathroom without crying.  She doesn't like to go to anyone else if I'm home.  Once it gets to be 8 or 9pm at night, I'm the only one she will go to and I have to lay with her on the couch for her to fall asleep.  If Daddy is holding her and I'm home she freaks out, screaming hysterically until he gives her to me and then she is fine.  If I'm not there, she is very sociable.  Am I doing something wrong?  I am not one to let a 3 month old baby "cry it out."  I feel bad for my husband because he thinks she hates him but she does it to everyone.

Being a mom, how old would your son have to be for you to allow him to use public restrooms alone? We have split custody of our son and my ex-wife allows our 4 year old to use walmart (and other public places) restrooms by himself. Does that sound too young? I am kind of uncomfortable with her letting him do that. Am I way off?

20090129072333AAtoyRS	Pregnancy & Parenting;Parenting	Mom has a problem with the possibility of a relationship?	I'm 36 weeks pregnant on Saturday. A guy I know from high school (all together probably 8 years or so) and I have kind of been talking and getting to know each other better again (we both were gone for about 8 months, me living somewhere else, him in the Air Force). We're not rushing things, but eventually we both want/are open to a relationship.      Besides it being obvious, he knows I'm pregnant and is ok with it, is looking forward to meeting my son and kind of being an uncle if nothing else. (The father left us early on.) He's a great guy, and was "raised right." (takes care of his responsibilities, isn't afraid of hard work, strong morals, etc)      Mom doesn't want me to even consider going somewhere with him tomorrow night (not because of how close I am to being due, but because of him). She said now is not the time to worry about a relationship, I need to be focused on Jamie. Like I said, we're not rushing into a relationship and he understands that for the first few weeks unless he comes over and helps me with Jamie he won't see me because I'll be busy with him.      I don't see why she has such a problem (other than slipping into the overprotective mom/grandma role).      What do you think the problem is?

Baby dancing wasn't timed that well this month and the only one that actually "counted" would have been about three days before ovulation... perhaps way too soon. I was on Depo for 8 years, with my last shot being in March 2008 and I'm really concerned (rather, I've convinced myself) that it has caused some kind of infertility as I've been TTC for 7 months now with no success.

20090129080843AAsULWI	Pregnancy & Parenting;Newborn & Baby	Nursing the second baby as painful as the first?	Hi, I am 12 weeks pregnant and still nursing my 16 month old about twice a day (not a full feeding either time really...) and she is weaning. She will probably be off the boob within a month or two.       Anyway, the first month breastfeeding her was miserable. It was painful, I had cracked and bleeding nipples, and clogged milk ducts. I think this was mostly due to my inexperience. But I learned as I went and now at 16 months, I feel like an expert.      Anyway, my daughter will probably have stopped nursing for several months before I give birth to the new baby, so I'm wondering if it is painful to nurse a new baby?      So if you nursed while pregnant or stopped not *too* long before you got pregnant, did it hurt to nurse the second baby? Did you experience cracked nipples and clogged ducts, or did your expertise help you prevent this and were your breasts desensitized like they become after nursing for a while?      Or if you nursed your first child and stopped long before you were pregnant again (like maybe a few years) did you experience pain with the new baby? Any problems?      Thanks.

I really dont want to get induced and want the baby to come before this happens. But just wondering how high my blood pressure can go before i hit "danger zone"

He doesn't like to take naps.  I don't even think he's ever slept a full 8 hours before.  Don't even think 6 hours either.  is there anything that could be done about this?  He's growing up being used to being held all the time.  I tried to tell my brother and his girlfriend not to hold him all the time but they didn't listen.  I think thats a reason as to why he doesn't take naps very much.  and if he does take a nap, it's no more than 45 or 30 min.

But today he was talking with him work mates and told them the name.   They said it looks like Mah-Son, instead of May-Son.      We are now considering changing the spelling to Maison..    What does everyone think? Are his work mates just being silly or would you also pronounce it Mah-Son?      Thanks, Jess

I've been feeling dizzy on the odd occasion, lots of trips to the loo and also nausea, not as though I'm going to be sick, just a sickly feeling.  Most people say all these things shouldn't start happening till you're at least 6 weeks so why am I getting them now?  When I did my first pregnancy test 15dpo I got two very clear lines, not faint at all, then I did another 2 days later and the pregnancy line was even darker than the normal test line.  I know your hcg level is supposed to go up every 24 hours or so, but could I be carrying twins or something as someone suggested?  Should my line have been showing up that dark after only 15dpo then 17dpo.  Got my gp appointment tomorrow.
20090129081352AAwNjhd	Pregnancy & Parenting;Adoption	Father's rights when an unwed mother wants to give a baby up for adoption?	[This came up in a conversation over the weekend, and I had no idea what the answer was.  Perhaps one of you can answer this!]      Scenario...      A man and woman who are not married have sex, and the woman ends up pregnant.  For purposes of this question, assume that both the man and woman are over the age of 18, and that the sex was consensual.      The woman decides that she does not want to keep the baby, but chooses to put the baby up for adoption rather than getting an abortion.      Let's suppose that the baby's father wants to raise the baby, and let's assume that with the help of his parents, he can provide a good, stable home for the child.      Does the father have any right to custody of the child?        Just FYI - I'm not asking for your opinions on what is the ideal way to handle this situation.  If you can provide a factual answer,  either based on laws or a similar experience by someone you know, by all means answer.
20090129072101AAv5z0M	Pregnancy & Parenting;Pregnancy	What to expect when expecting has got me worried : (?	I was reading what to expect when expecting and it got to the section about the umbilical cord around the baby's neck. It said that if your baby experiences the hiccups often and they last for longer than 10 minutes at a time then the cord may be wrapped around their neck or they could have knots in the cord reducing blood flow which could lead to death in utero.      I am so worried because my baby boy gets the hiccups at least twice a day and they sometimes last over 10 minutes.   Do you feel your baby get the hiccups that often?   Have you ever heard of this before?   Sometimes i wish i didn't read anything about pregnancy because there is always something new to worry about: (

Okay so my cycle has been like clock work for years, I know when I ovulate and can pinpoint the day I start all with out bcp.  So in sept/oct 2008 (just a few months ago) I had an ovarian ectopic pregnancy and now my actual period is weird.  Instead of just starting on day 28, I spot really lightly for two days and then i start?

20090129075016AAmmAfK	Pregnancy & Parenting;Trying to Conceive	Another Question(s) About the Vacutainer process?	I have another question about the Vacutainer process, I'm doing a research report on different phlebotomy procedures. This is the situation:      1. Is it true once the rubber stopper has been punctured once, and the vaccum is used, it's finished? For example, if the vacuum only draws a small amount of blood, can a new needle be attached to the SAME vacutainer, punctured again (a second time), and try again? Or is the vacuum inside the vacutainer essentially gone after one try due to the negative pressure inside? So its basically one full swoop or nothing?  Then you'd move on to a new procedure such as a butterfly draw and discard the vacutainer tube.      2. The negative pressure inside the vacuum uses suction to draw the blood into the collection tube, theres no flashback into the vein, this is simple physics.      3. Vacutainer "holders" can be reused but its not such common practice anymore. Correct?      Thank you all so much for the help, especially the last question as well.

20090129075938AAsZHPN	Pregnancy & Parenting;Newborn & Baby	Anyone experience a 13 month old who can't crawl?	I'm a family day care provider and I have a 13 month old little boy in my care who seems to be developmentally delayed.  He can't crawl, stand alone, or feed himself very easily (finger foods such as Cheerios, etc) He only just learned to hold his bottle at about 10 months.  He also holds his arms back (hyper extended almost), they seem to hurt him if you try to move them up (to do games like "so big") and doesn't play with toys like all the other babies I've ever encountered.  When he was about seven or eight months if I put him on his stomach for belly time he'd just bury his head in the floor and cry.  He also cries excessively for his age.     Now I've tried to talk to both his mom & dad about my concerns, but they are first time parents and think that he's normal.  So, am I being a worry wart or could there be something wrong?  He breaks my heart because he watches the other kids play with such excitement and frustration because he can't do the things that they are doing.     Also he'll sit for long periods of time without moving at all.     His pediatrician recommended early intervention a few months ago but his parents think that he started doing better so they decided not to take him.  What do you all think????

I moved to Arizona with my girlfriend and the future mother of my son lives in California, my girlfriend knows about it but she says she is okay with that as long as I don't sleep with her again.  But the future mother of my son/daughter is angry and says "Don't even worry about my child, I can take care of him myself!!!" and that she won't let me see my son/daughter.  Her mother lives in another country and she told her to take the child to her so that I don't see him ever.

20090129073740AAvCL3k	Pregnancy & Parenting;Parenting	Question for Moms and expecting Moms...need some information please?	Hi! My husband and I are probably going to start to try to have a baby within the next year or so and i am curious about what all you Mom's go through during pregnancy.  Unfort. i have been one of those people who have a HUGE fear of vomiting and I just don't know how i might handle morning sickness (if i have it).  I'm the type of person where if i feel sick or get sick  i when i eat something, I'm just NOT going to eat.   How do you keep yourself healthy and eating right if you feel nauseous all the time and can't keep anything down when pregnant??   I know having a baby is worth all the yukky days you go through, and women have babies all the time, but I'm so scared of going through possibly morning sickness for weeks and weeks when it's hard for me to even handle a stomach bug. How do all you Mom's keep yourself calm and relaxed during your pregnancy?   Thanks girls :)

20090129074501AAUGvMJ	Pregnancy & Parenting;Pregnancy	Could i be pregnant?Please,help...?	Me and my boyfriend had unprotected sex a couple of times this month.He always pulled out before.But i have heard there is still possibility of getting pregnant.Three days ago he didn't pull out and finished inside me.Next day i got my period which was on time. My periods are very very irregular and always walk from the beginning up to the end of month,but last two times(including this one) it was on time.It lasts for 5 days,a bit heavy at the beginning and then slows down,but today it seems as it stopped.On 3rd day it never did this before.I have noticed that i started getting a bit of feeling as if im gonna throw up,but barely noticeable.Last night at midnight i ate two toasts with margarine spread on it.I eat toast maybe a couple of times a year and i don't like margarine also,but i did it last night.I started drinking milk mixed with coffee for no reason.Just like that.Also when i hoover or wash dishes,l feel  too tired,as though i was running for miles.My heart feels as if though its gonna jump out.Can signs show  off this early or maybe it is from one of previous times?What are the chances of me being pregnant?Sorry for text being too long.Its just that im worried..Thanks..

Tested 3 times and all negative.      I'm starting to freak out at this point because I have never been on birth control, have a regular 28 day cycle and never been late but once and that was 2 days.      My breasts are extremely tender, monthly is 1 week past due, metallic taste sometimes, feel nauseous at times, bloated, and I just feel pregnant although I've never been pregnant.      Could my hCG levels be low and not be able to pick up on a test?   Is there something else wrong with me?      I'm majorly worried because I have NEVER been this late. I've read that sometimes  people's hCG levels are low until the 3rd month!      HELP!!!

20090129075042AAYTeap	Pregnancy & Parenting;Newborn & Baby	Vaccines two days ago, non stop crying since.?	Let me start off by saying I already talked to the on call doctor and he is going to the doctor when they open, also called the hospital and was told to take him to my normal pedi. I am just looking for opinions.      My son will be a year old in two weeks and is normally a very calm, happy kid. Hardly cries, healthy eater, active player, etc. He went in for his well check two days ago, he had a slight cold and the doctor went ahead with his immunizations. He received another round of HepB and a TB test.    Since then he has been crying on and off (mostly on) like he is in pain, completely inconsolable. He will not eat solids past a bite or two and has to be almost convinced to drink liquids (milk, juice or pedialyte). Is having trouble going to sleep and staying asleep. Wakes up screaming after an hour or two. He normally plays a lot but is more inclined to just sit on my lap and scream now. I am pretty sure he doesn't have a fever but I do not know where my thermometer is at the moment. He doesn't feel hot.    I'm not an anti vaccine person, I obviously am for them, but now after reading things on thinktwice.org as well as a few other sights I am doubting my decision and need some convincing that this is not related to the shots. I also found out afterwards reading online that doctors are supposed to delay shots when a child is sick, mine did not nor did he inform me that he was supposed to.    A different doctor at his pedi's office said they would do a full exam and see if his behavior is vaccine related and we would go from there. I'm freaking out a little bit but hoping for the best. I need your guys opinions. I am tired from lack of sleep due to his screaming and concerned for his well being and would like to know what you guys think of this situation.          Any input or personal experiences welcomed.

I thought it would be the ones that make noise, but mostly I don't find the music cube he likes best that annoying.      However he has one teething ring thing that is different from the others -- it's bigger and harder and coated with some kind of rubber.  He loves it, for some reason biting down on the hardness really seems to make him feel better.  However, when he gets excited (like when his Dad comes home) he flaps his arms up and down.  I have been rapped on the knuckles so many times by this thing!  Sometimes I trade it for something softer, but I always end up giving it back to him because he loves it so much.      So what toy does your child love that you have come to hate?

I asked a question a while back about snacks for my 16 month old and a lot of people suggested trail mix. Well all the ones at the store were all full of salt and oil and crap so I decided to make my own.      I put in:   multigrain cheerios   unsalted, dry roasted peanuts (I wanted different nuts but couldn't find them without salt and oil!)   unsalted, dry roasted pumpkin seeds   And a mix of diced dried fruit that contains raisins, golden raisins, apples, apricots, cherries, and pineapple in little tiny bits.      It was a big hit with the 16 month old, and everyone else in the house!      Now, I'm trying to think of other healthy choices to mix in to the trail mix, what would you (or do you) put in?      BTW - It was a bit pricey but really fun shopping for all the ingredients for her trail mix and I let her mix it herself. Lots of fun. :)

20090129082256AAwwnIz	Pregnancy & Parenting;Pregnancy	Am i pregnant?? ...Symptoms...?	1. For two days now i have had sickiness at EXACTLY the same time. (midnight lol). I really really really feel sick and to the point for the last 2 days i have ran into the bathroom HOPING that i would be sick, but i havent. I feel so bad i want to make myself sick but i havent. It usually goes within 3 hours and then i feel fine.      2. i have had only what i can describe as 'strange' feelings. I feel very protective over my belly. I wont lie on my belly, i wont stretch, i am just basically acting like i am pregnant lol. And my work staff noticed that i was 'holding my belly' as i walked around. I didnt even notice i was doing this.      3. My nipples are stupidly sensitive to the point that they are permanently erect and sore, i cant even touch them.      4. My boobs have gone bigger and 'fuller'. I usually have quite 'saggy' boobs but they are really perky and lovely lately (apart from my sore nipples).      5. My belly is all rounded and fat even though normally i have a toned, flat stomach. And like i say i am very protective of my belly, always holding my belly etc.      6. My period is due 7th Feb but i have PCOS so i very much doubt i will be on time. My last period was 4 months late.      What do you think girlies??      I do have a test, but i am going to wait to take a test :) Thanks xxxxx

Okay, I"m due to start my period around the 5th of this month,  I am thinking we might have got lucky this month, i'm thinking if we did, conception was on the 17th.  I've been having some period like symptoms, but more cramping than usual, body aching everyday, along with waking up with headaches everyday, & i've been having some really long vivid dreams (for the last 4 days all this has been going on) I also (sorry about way to much info) but i have the most HORRIBLE gas, i had it all night last night, & since i've got up this morning,  i've had to go to the bathroom often but i drink a lot of water so that's not unusual, but it seems more often lately....... i have also had waves of nausea, my mouth starts watering really bad & i start to head for the bathroom & it goes away, this happens a lot too, so i'm either reading way to much into my period symptoms or i might have got lucky.... what do you think? some of those things don't normally happen  when i'm PMSing, and i'm not craving chocolate like i usually do so close to my start day... hmmm... ahh the suspense is killing me!! lol!

20090129082611AAYtPKz	Pregnancy & Parenting;Pregnancy	Dates suggest 8 weeks but scan says otherwise?	I had both an ultrasound and transvaginal scan today. My date of LMP suggest im 8w 1d but the ultrasound showed only a tiny wee sack that measured at 6w4d and you couldnt see anything in it. They did a transvaginal US and this measured at 7w2d and there was a wee heartbeat going strong.      Im a bit confused tho - do the U/S dates correspond to when you concieve or are they related to estimates based on your last period?      There were only two occassions i could have concieved and neither match up with the dates given and while i know theres always an error of margin it just kinda confused me.
20081014181705AA61usU	Pregnancy & Parenting;Grade-Schooler	Im a teacher, problem student.?	I am a pre-scool teacher, (Mr.W) is what the kids call me because my last name is too long. Anyway, I have a 4 year old student who keeps on excreting in his pants. I asked him what happend and that he should ask to go to the bathroom, and not go in his pants. He just replies saying "I go poopy" I contacted his mother and she said he has no bowel problems and he's just being a kid, but the Janitors refused to clean up his waste after the 3rd week in a row, and I have been stuck cleaning it up. I dont want to yell at him because hes only 4, but i want to knock his teeth down his throat....What should i do?

20090129082934AAE96Y1	Pregnancy & Parenting;Toddler & Preschooler	Putting my daughter in a toddler bed?	So when we moved we decided to take away the crib and put her in a toddler bed. The first night was great! She went straight to bed, no hassle, no fuss. The second night was a night of tantrums, screaming, banging on the door, and everything else! It was a mess, she gets out of bed, bangs on the door and screams bloody murder. I feel like my neighbors are going to think I'm abusing her! She also throws herself on the floor and will not stay in her bed.      I am also trying to take away her pacifier, which isn't going so well.       I have been just going to her room when she bangs on the door, not saying a word and putting her back into her bed, and leaving the room. But 2+ hours of this is enough, I'm going to lose my sanity! I have also gave her a big teddy bear to sleep with but she isn't having it.      Any helpful ideas to make bedtime smoother for her and me?

20090129083247AAcrcyw	Pregnancy & Parenting;Newborn & Baby	7 month old baby pooped 8 times in 24 hrs... why?	My 7 month old baby received some of her regular vaccines 3 days ago.  Well yesterday she started pooping constantly.  She has pooped 8 times in a 24 hour period.  Some of the stools were soft but a lot of them were regular, so it's not like she has diarreah.  Is this common with vaccinations??
