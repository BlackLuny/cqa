20090130100530AAef2VC	Home & Garden;Maintenance & Repairs	Kitchen clog question...my neighbor has a disposal and a dishwasher..when she turns on the water in the sink ?	it drains for awhile and then starts to back up. When you turn on the disposal to see if that will help drain the sink, it goes down temporarily and then sprays a spray like a geyser up and out. We tried a plunger and we tried baking soda with boiling vinegar with no luck. She bought some liquid plummer kind of stuff, but is says not to use it in dishwashers or disposals. Any ideas on what to do next?

I live in the Greater Rochester area in NY and I am having trouble finding a store that sells low cost furniture as most of the furniture I find that look decent are usually not solid. I am not afraid to buy used furniture, the only problem is I can not find a store like that.   Specific furniture I want is:      - Computer Desks   - TV Stands   - Bed Frames/Headboards   - And Night Stands      All I need is any store that sells low budget furniture.

20090130183942AAaWQRd	Home & Garden;Other - Home & Garden	Selling Kirby Vacuum cleaners?	My husband found this job as appointment setter, he has to set appointments so salesmen can sell the vacuums. He says he has to do a certain amount of appointments a week to get paid 2000 dollars a month. The vacuum cleaner itself sells for 2000dollars. Tomorrow they will give him a vacuum cleaner to bring home and experiment with so he can get to know the product. That right there, scares me, why would they trust him with a 2000 dollar vacuum cleaner   He went to the orientation and had his first day of work. And I don't know what they are telling him, but I am not feeling it, I want him to quit, I know it's a scam or a rip off. And I'm so scared we will get attached to something and stuck with debt. We are already struggling and behind with our bills. He has a PT job right now and that's our only source of income to pay the bills and he seems to be willing to push that job aside to go sell vacuum cleaners, and I'm just here worrying my butt off. I don't know what to tell him, but I want him to quit and get a real job. But he has been so manipulated.   The reason why I post this is, because I want to hear from other Kirby SELLERS (not buyers) what your experiences are.   And I also want to hear advice on what I can do, as his wife to make him realize that this is not the job he wants.

I'm trying to find a good location for my quince tree that I haven't put in the ground yet.  My front yard faces south, so it really doesn't get much shade in the summer.  I have room for it in the back yard where it would get some shade, but it looses its leaves in the winter, and I really would rather have some evergreen trees in the backyard for privacy.  It would look beautiful in the front yard, I just don't know if it would survive our brutal summers.
