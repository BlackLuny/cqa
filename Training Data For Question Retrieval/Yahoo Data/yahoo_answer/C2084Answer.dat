7u77AiBjaa	Switch back to your 360 image option in your Yahoo! Answers profile and wait.<br>  <br>  OFTEN it takes minutes, hours, days, or weeks for the system to catch up to changes made through Yahoo! 360. So, in the meantime, you will be without any picture on Y/A (a gray unisex icon), words/red "x" in box will show, or an old 360 image will appear. Just go through the process and let your picture stay that way until the Y/A system makes your 360 image appear. If you would prefer not to wait, then continue using a Yahoo! Avatar (<a href="http://avatars.yahoo.com)" rel="nofollow">http://avatars.yahoo.com)</a> and forget about using the 360 image (at least for now).<br>  <br>  Otherwise after a few days of waiting, you can certainly contact Y/A staff by posting a BUG report on the Y/A forum at <a href="http://suggestions.yahoo.com/?prop=answers">http://suggestions.yahoo.com/?prop=answe...</a> . I recommend putting BUG: to start the title of your message. Also, you can do a search on the forum and add a comment to messages other people have posted about the problem. This problem can only be resolved system-wide (temporarily or permanently) by Yahoo staff.|`|aitD50yuaa	That's happening to me to.|`|kAIXDVu1aa	mine dosen't work either look at my pic i wanted 2 change it to have a bill kaulitz pic but it doesn't work

Each user can be a top contributor in a maximum three categories.<br>  You earn it or lose it depending on your recent participation in a certain section.<br>  The more positively you contribute, the more chance there is that you will get a TC badge. Just like featured users or category leaders, it's another way to give credit to community members."<br>  <br>  The TC badge is awarded on the number of questions answered and best answers received by the user in a particular week, in a particular category.<br>  <br>  It is rumoured that you need at least a 10 percent best answers in your chosen category to get a TC badge although the actual percentage and the number of answers is Yahoo's secret. <br>  All you see and read on the subject is speculation, rumour, assumption, imagination, and guesswork.<br>  <br>  A user who is on the leader board may or may not have a TC badge, the criteria is measured on weekly participation in a particular category (number of answers and % of best answers in the category).<br>  <br>  The easiest way to get a TC badge is to concentrate on one category where many questions are asked and hope to get some best answers.<br>  <br>  The Polls and Surveys and Jokes and Riddles categories do not have Top Contributors.<br>  <br>  If you have contributed enough to meet Yahoo's criteria, the orange badge will appear below your avatar on Monday morning.<br>  <br>  It can disappear just as easily on Monday morning, if you don't keep answering questions in your chosen category.|`|5fb39523f75c15b623115ea5cd8f29eeaa	Top contributor is someone who is knowledgeable in up to three categories. the exact formula is kept secret by yahoo but the common theory is that you need a minimum of 10 percent best answers in each particular category and is said to be reviewed weekly. the top contributor badge is not permanent and can be removed at any time.

There are probably thousands of new websites created or appearing every day.  But so I don't get a violation for not answering, my answer to your question is "Yes, I do know some new sites."  I doubt they'd be of interest, although you didn't express what your interests were or what kind of sites you are looking for.

If you see a question that is a violation, you should either report it or ignore it.  If your negative answer didn't actually answer the question then it could have been reported by anyone for not being a valid answer.<br>  <br>  Some people (trolls) ask questions that are designed to wind people up so they will give answers that are violations and can be reported.

Its not just questions that can receive a violation, answers can as well.  I always think it is best to move on to another question.<br>  If you already have answered a question like that there is always the chance that someone/asker could report you because your answer was not to their liking. It is not really fair to do that especially if the question itself is not within the guidelines.|`|AA11252878	You'll expose yourself to a violation doing something like that. If you feel reporting the question isn't a good idea on your count, just ignore it and move onto another one. Remember two wrongs don't make a right.

suPD7c3gaa	I certainly hope your father is successful.  Clearly you're not getting an education going the home schooling route.  Your education is important.  Instead of hoping you dad isn't successful, why not let it be known you WANT to be in public schools.  Dropping courses, not bothering with work whenever you're not in the mood isn't doing you any good.  Hopefully, your father will prove that the home schooling isn't working and you're not getting the education you should be getting.  That's what will steer the ruling... if your father can prove what is best for you.  Your mother really couldn't have a leg to stand on if what you're saying about your inconsistent schooling is true.  Sounds like Dad cares.

AA10132204	Questions are only open/good for four days (7 if you extend it).  If it gets no answers, it is removed at the end of the "open" period.<br>  <br>  There are several reason questions are removed:<br>  <br>  1. It is a violation of the rules - you will get an e-mail when that happens. If you get one, post it here in a question and the users can tell you the problem. There is no statute of limitations on breaking the YA rules.<br>  <br>  2. There were zero answers when the time expired - no e-mail sent.<br>  <br>  3. The BA was reported as a violation - no e-mail sent.<br>  <br>  4. During voting, "No Best Answer" was chosen as the best answer - no e-mail sent.<br>  <br>  Look in your e-mail, including the spam folder, for a violation e-mail. If not there, check your activity tab in your profile. If nothing about a violation there, then the Q was removed for one of the other reasons.|`|suPD7c3gaa	It probably got removed because it received no answers during allotted time. You don't get your 5 points back if that is what happened.  If it was removed before time ran out, then it was probably reported for a violation, in which case you would get an email violation notice.  A question doesn't have to be offensive, rude, contain profanity or anything of a sexual nature to be a violation.|`|angW1Lkfaa	I got more then one answer deleted the question was what car was better BMW or Mercedes I said I couldn't afford either one so I never looked. I thought it was deleted by some panel but anyone can delete and there are some winners on here. You think they would ban some of these people I have seen many questions that have no reason to be on here.|`|0f644b00eccc311534ab8fe88a3eb455aa	maybe some wording was used incorrectly, or someone probably was being a jerk and clicked on your question and set it as offensive.<br>  <br>  sorry about that

BKjnDG99aa	if you're not the owner, it could be a setting they set and it also could be some one deleted the post(s). you'd have to ask this question per that group. if you do not see the 'message' to the left of the group, then the owner has selected a group setting

f202428f23f47abf8c99a259c26fc13eaa	Yahoo doesn't offer that feature on the free versions--altho, I understand that "Yahoo Plus" (which you have to pay for) does.<br>  <br>  The only draw back to the read receipts, is that it isn't automatic. The person recieving the mail, MUST agree to send a receipt back to you---(which is a pain in the butt)--AND if they choose not to do that---then you still won't know when/if they opened it.

AA11595360	I would certainly think you could get your deposit back. But why in the world did you give a deposit sight unseen. I'd pressure them constantly for your deposit and take pictures of the place if you can so you have proof of reason. Threaten to contract legal council or even the people who regulate rental agreements in your area.|`|008512e32e60fcef19c7029ae0dc4d45aa	i woudl take pictures and if they dont give you your deposit back i would take it to court|`|EjyD1sXeaa	why on earth did you give a deposit on something you didn't see?<br>  you shouldn't have signed a lease or given a deposit. Take photos see a good lawyer or move in and take the issue up with Landlord and Tenant bureau in your town|`|ygGr1nX7aa	Lease contracts usually include a requirement of a number of weeks advance notice of cancellation, in which case you will be liable for at least that.  Re-read the contract and, if you're serious about not moving in, to be safe you should notify the landlord that you want to cancel the agreement *in writing* immediately and keep a copy.|`|AJ38Xqyeaa	hhhhhhhhhhaaa|`|1h5RpINNaa	Unless this place has a heart...you are screwed.|`|eEu3zbVTaa	Since you have already signed the lease and put down a deposit, you are screwed.  The landlord will say that you should have looked at YOUR apartment first before signing a lease.  As a landlord he needs to keep up with any repairs.  Read your lease throughly and check to see what you can make him do to get your place cleaner.|`|BMV2KBsyaa	If you have signed an agreement, i would think you have to honor it. However, you can ask the landlord to clean up the apartment. <br>  <br>  Also, in the state of Maryland, you have something called the "Rent Escrow Law". You might want to refer to that.<br>  <br>  Also checkout this site -> <a href="http://www.rentlaw.com/" rel="nofollow">http://www.rentlaw.com/</a>|`|o57O3yMlaa	AWWWW:] <br>  ?|`|qdP5WAMgaa	wasn't this on ugly betty?|`|CVkW23mCaa	I don't think you're screwed.  I would take them right back to the apartment they showed you and then directly over to your apartment and tell them that, based on the difference in appearance, there is no way in hell you're going to move into that place unless they agree to have it cleaned up, carpets replaced and a fresh coat of paint put up.  That's typically what happens when an apartment complex has a vacancy.  They usually get the place ready by doing those things before they allow a new tenant to occupy the residence.  If the carpets are fairly new and they're not covered in stains and pretty much shot, then they may just have the carpets steam cleaned - but always put a fresh coat of paint up for the new tenants.  Don't let them get away with this.  You tell them that you were expecting your place to look "similar" (as they put it) to the model apartment you were shown and if they can't produce that then you're getting an attorney.  If they say fine, then have your Dad or a close friend who's a good talker call and say he's representing you and contacting them to see if they would agree to settle this situation out of court of if they would like to proceed and allow you to file a complaint in small claims court.  I wouldn't mess around if I were you....and I DEFINITELY WOULD NOT MOVE ANY OF MY THINGS INTO THAT APARTMENT!!!
44b4fdd7ed7cc42e599ec8a9302e9632aa	We would have to know the exact wording of your question in order to make that determination.|`|SOxdyWQOaa	people do that I had that happen to me once it was just no one like reading the truth|`|2f739e8b2a5530e501bad3e76a9cb2f7aa	The short answer is: Because somebody reported it. The true answer is that it may or may not have been. Factors that could affect this are: did it post in the correct category (while posting in the wrong category is NOT a violation, many users think it is and report for that); or did you get answers and respond to them with 'additional details' (posting a lot of additional details, particularly addressing the answerers by name, can move a perfectly GOOD question into the realm of 'chatting'). Personally, I don't consider this a violation and think you should appeal it, but only if you did not add 'chatty' details, of course.|`|zDQIPFH2aa	It may or may not have been a violation.  The wording is extremely important so you need to provide the violation e-mail you got.  For example, if you asked "Do you know what happened on .........?", that is chatting because it can be simply answered yes/no/or even idk.  It does not require facts or a real answer.  You have to word your questions properly like a teacher would want them to avoid the risk of a violation.|`|2BEMSGPdaa	Ah sweet mystery of life i'm glad It found you. The thing you have to understand is sometimes the reason is there is no reason.<br>  There is also the troll answer.

Just go through the process and let your picture stay that way until the Y/A system makes your correct 360 image appear. If you would prefer not to wait, then use a Yahoo! Avatar (<a href="http://avatars.yahoo.com">http://avatars.yahoo.com</a> ) and forget about using the 360 image (at least for now).<br>  <br>  Otherwise after a few days of waiting, you can certainly contact Y/A staff by posting a BUG report on the Y/A forum at <a href="http://suggestions.yahoo.com/?prop=answers">http://suggestions.yahoo.com/?prop=answe...</a> . I recommend putting BUG: to start the title of your message. Also, you can do a search on the forum and add a comment to messages other people have posted about the problem.

This is a yahoo problem there is nothing you can do to fix it.<br>  <br>  The fact is until yahoo gets around to fix this problem your only alternatives are to wait for the fix or use your yahoo avatar.<br>  <br>  Note: this glitch has accured before (5/6 months ago) and it took almost  2 weeks before the 360 avatars showed.|`|d48b0cce8366a9573fefff374501246aaa	See how it feels when you are no longer with us anymore.
gGZz2EGyaa	If I understand you correctly you have answered a question and so has someone else and you want to say something about their answer.  Well you will need to go into your answer by EDIT and add some more notes and then submit again.<br>  If you are the asker of the question it is the same thing, go into into edit and add your notes.<br>  Hope this helps.

If you haven’t created your avatar, at the top of the page, under “Nickname” is a line that says “Use my 360 nickname”. If you have not created your 360 profile, there will be a link next to it that says something like “Get my 360 profile now!” Click on it; it will be the easiest to use for the below.<br>  <br>  Once you set up the profile, you can click on the button that reads "Edit Personal Photos". That takes you to a page, where you can upload an image you wish to use as your primary photo. Remember, it has to be in the JPG format, and it must be 5 MB or less. After you have added the image, you can set it as your primary. Then, go to your Yahoo! Answers profile, and then click the button that reads "Edit My Info". You will see three boxes down near the bottom toolbar on the page, and the middle one reads "Use my Yahoo! 360 Picture". Check the circle next to it, and then scroll down and save your profile. It will take a short period of time for the picture to process, so be patient.|`|6lfm228eaa	WAIIIT!!<br>  <br>  dont do that yet ^^<br>  <br>  <br>  it will mess it up cus its doing it to evryone!<br>  <br>  < --- it will do that|`|5fb39523f75c15b623115ea5cd8f29eeaa	If you want a photo/custom picture as your avatar you need to make a yahoo 360 account. <a href="http://360.yahoo.com/login.html?.done=http://360.yahoo.com/">http://360.yahoo.com/login.html?.done=ht...</a><br>  <br>  The photo/image needs to be saved on your computer as a jpg file, don't worry about the size to much yahoo will adapt it.

suPD7c3gaa	I don't even think "deep personal questions" should be asked.  I think it's pretty ridiculous that people would share some of the very personal things they do on a public site with perfect strangers.  What some of them don't realize is this information stays in circulation on the internet forever, and can be found in other places on the internet, and if controversial, illegal or possibly damaging in anyway... it can (and often will) be found by prospective employers, colleges, organizations and more.<br>  <br>  So you think 40,000 points is a lot?  It's far from being a high number as points go on here.  My 96,000+ point total is quite low compared to others on here.

LgxVVDWraa	I AM SOOO GLAD I SAW THIS QUESTION...<br>  here's the deal,<br>  don't worry about what the guy says, look at his body language<br>  body language is universal in all cultures in general<br>  there are certain things that are different, but one things stays the same:<br>  if the guy looks at you in the eyes, even when he thinks you are not looking and he looks at your face, he cares.<br>  Pay attention to the corner of your eyes.<br>  That's how I can tell. There were these guys who would try to act like they were mr. right, told me things like they played with their nephews at chuckie cheese and only wanted sex when they felt he cared for the girl, told me they would never cheat, never hit a woman, blah blah blah. But, these same guys would look me up and down AT MY BODY.  When they had girlfriends, they would still check me out. If I looked them in the eye aimlessly, they would look away. The difference between lust and love..<br>  <br>  But, I did meet mr. right and I screwd up with him because I had been hurt so badly in the past I didn't know how to treat him well and I'll tell you what mr. right is like. My brother is also a mr. right, so I've met a lot of them.  <br>  Mr. right will smile at you like a little boy, grin so much that he cannot help it.  Mr. right will remember everything you say, because when you leave him for the night he loves you so much he'll replay these memories of everything you say in his head. <br>  This makes me cry..but I'm being honest so you don't make the same mistakes I did.<br>  Mr. right, will appreciate you when you're nice to him. He'll feel like he's the one you have been waiting for you're whole life.<br>  He'll love your smile and constantly look you in the eyes, it's all about the eyes.  He'll do sweet things for you, He'll kiss you in public because he doesn't care who is around.  He won't hold you in a disrespectful way, like on your butt in front of his boys because he's not one of those guys that will brag, "I slept with this girl last night her sex was awesome haha".<br>  He'll be shy sometimes, and ask if you like the way he does certain things because he's not cocky and just assumes you like him because he's some kind of mac daddy or whatever.  He may be confident in certain things, but he won't be stuck up and arrogant.<br>  He will support you in whatever you want to do with your life, as long as it makes you successful and he feels that it's best for you.  So Mr. right won't say that it's bad for you to go to college.  And it may hurt Mr. right to let you move away for work or college, but he'll try to visit you and support you for your dreams as best he can.<br>  He won't always want to touch you and have sex, he'll want to do simple things like hold your hand or dance to slow music, even just gaze at your eyes, talk with you about the things you love.  He'll talk about you more than himself, because he loves you more than himself and he's a good guy.<br>  Oh wow I am crying actually haha..<br>  <br>  and he won't be one of those guys that have a lot of girlfriends. He won't ask you to be his girlfriend the first couple of times he meets you, simply because he wants to take the time to get to know you and make sure you're the one, since he doesn't just get with ANY girl.  He is picky, because once he's in a relationship he's committed.<br>  He'll get jealous when you talk with other guys maybe, but he won't yell or make you feel hurt. He'll make you feel like a princess and spoil you.  That's how you know.|`|VqEJk0eiaa	Awww, he sounds really sweet!<br>  <br>  The 2 of u sounds like lovers 4 life...<br>  <br>  If u ever fight or anything, don't break up, work hard 2 make the relationship work and trust him.<br>  <br>  Good luck, girl! :-D|`|FDUUVAM0aa	WAKE UP most any guy would rather be your lover?? for the rest of his life... READ**** NO COMMITMENT!!!|`|1qKvCldEaa	Firstly, don't listen to your friend buzzing in your ear about him being in tons of non serious relationships, it means he is willing to be a better person for you. It doesn't sound like he's just sweet talking you. I wouldn't say there is any one rule of thumb for love either. If he is committed to you, willing to change for you, changing for you, putting you before himself, chances are he means it. A lot of times too, men mean well but they seriously foul up, which does not mean you should forgive them.<br>  <br>  Bottom line, I think he means it and one persons definition of love may be completely different than another's. I stick with the unconditional sort.|`|sbO02fYGaa	well i will tell you what i think..<br>  I kno where you are my bf says the same thing all the time and my friends have told me that they dont think he is ready for a long relationship. But from what your saying sounds like he really does mean ever word he tells you and seems like he is the one worth trying with. Just trust the way you are feeling i mean if you feel he really loves you then dont worry bout what anyone says or does you and him should be happy and trust that no one will be hurt by what you 2 decide to do.<br>  but thats as best as i can tell you!<br>  i hope it works out....<br>  ---Destiny---|`|usIUgISsaa	your probably the best gf hes had, and he feels lucky for that and knows that he doesnt want to loose you at all in the future. <br>  so i think when he sais he loves you, he means it but at the same time, sais it to keep you closer to him so he can feel secure.|`|cZ2WDB34aa	Stay away from men as long as possible. Stay in school, get financially stable and independent, further yourself in your career, have a savings account, anything. <br>  Men will say anything they dont know what theyre talking about. They tell you they love you, marry you, take care of you, then two years down the road you find out theyve been cheating on you the whole time and where are you?

This is a yahoo problem there is nothing you can do to fix it.<br>  <br>  The fact is until yahoo gets around to fix this problem your only alternatives are to wait for the fix or use your yahoo avatar.<br>  <br>  Note: this glitch has accured before (5/6 months ago) and it took almost two weeks before the 360 avatars showed.|`|6lfm228eaa	Yahooo is being a b*tch at the mo :)<br>  <br>  it wont let me have one either:)<br>  <br>  x|`|gG2CuoF8aa	ugh mine wont show either.<br>  yahoo better fix it. >:|

You can also click on  this link to switch back to Classic:<br>  <a href="http://us.mg1.mail.yahoo.com/dc/optout?s...">http://us.mg1.mail.yahoo.com/dc/optout?s...</a> <br>  Hope this helps!!!|`|e63450517215908d3a9a820dd7193140aa	Clear your browser cache of cookies and temp files, then type <br>  <a href="http://www.yahoo.com/">http://www.yahoo.com/</a> (or your country's domain) in the browser window - that should return the old familiar design...:-).
7u77AiBjaa	Create a 360 space at <a href="http://360.yahoo.com">http://360.yahoo.com</a> . Click "Get Started" button on the far right section of that page. After going through the activation process, you can click on the teeny tiny "Yahoo 360 Home" link on the upper right of that page (or the 360 main page) to get into the 360 space.<br>  <br>  Make sure a JPEG formatted photo (with .jpg, .jpeg, .jpe extension) under 5MB is saved to your hard drive.<br>  <br>  - Click your "My Page" link at the top<br>  - Click "Edit Profile/Personal Photos" over the empty picture frame<br>  - Click "Browse" and upload photo into an empty field. Then click one "use as primary" radio button on the right before saving (if you've uploaded more than one image).<br>  <br>  You can't upload more than 4 profile pictures (this includes an avatar). Make sure that you are following the 360 Personal Photo guidelines here: <a href="http://help.yahoo.com/l/us/yahoo/360/guidelines/guidelines-06.html">http://help.yahoo.com/l/us/yahoo/360/gui...</a> .<br>  <br>  Then, come back to Yahoo! Answers.<br>  - Make sure that it is the same Yahoo ID that you used for 360.<br>  - Click the "My Profile" link to the upper right of this Yahoo! Answers page, then click "Edit My Info" in the top left box on the Answers profile page.<br>  - Scroll down to the image section and check the option of showing the 360 picture. Click Preview and then the OK button. Then, WAIT.<br>  <br>  NOTE: The image may not show up right away in Y/A, as it sometimes take hours, days, or weeks for the system to catch up. So, in the meantime, you will be without any picture on Y/A (a gray unisex icon) or an old 360 image. Just go through the above process and let your picture stay that way until the system makes your 360 image appear. If you don't want to wait, then just use a Yahoo! Avatar (<a href="http://avatars.yahoo.com">http://avatars.yahoo.com</a> ) and forget about using the 360 image.<br>  <br>  OTHER TIPS: <br>  *** If the 360 space is recently activated, you may want to wait a few days before changing settings, as Y/A may not recognize that you have a 360 space right away.<br>  *** You may want to enable all the communication options on your Y/A profile and/or enable the Simple URL option in your Yahoo! 360 "Basic Info" and "Blog" settings pages. Sometimes that helps make the Y!360 image appear in your Y/A profile for an unknown reason. You still may have to wait for anything to happen though. <br>  *** Although, some people have found limited success in continually trying to re-select the 360 image option in their Y/A profile. I recommend waiting though, as to not inadvertently cause further delay.<br>  *** Some people never see an image show up. You can always post a bug report (or piggyback on other's bug reports) on the issue at the Y/A forum: <a href="http://suggestions.yahoo.com/?prop=answers">http://suggestions.yahoo.com/?prop=answe...</a> . This link between Y/A and Y!360 has been buggy for years.

RT58kdD3aa	Why bother to delete them?  Just mark them as spam and your email provider will deal with them.<br>  <br>  Sounds like you are getting a lot of spam which probably means you have been careless about giving out your email address or have been signing up to dodgy websites.  Guard your primary email address and only give it to people and websites that you can trust.<br>  <br>  It is best to create a disposable email address for signing up to websites you are not sure about, then if you get a lot of spam at that address you can just delete it and create a new one.  On Yahoo Mail you go to Mail Options and under the heading Spam you will see AddressGuard.  Click on this and it will tell you how to create and manage disposable email addresses to defend your primary address against spam.|`|44vgFcKcaa	No, the warning message is a safety feature.

2gaR06qraa	You can create the pages for that area of your site, yes, but...<br>  <br>  You'll need to publish those files to a directory set up in the File manager (Control panel at smallbusiness.yahoo.com).   This directory will need to be password protected in order to prevent unregistered users from getting to them.<br>  <br>  I would recommend calling Yahoo WH tech support to have them walk you through the process of getting this set up.

This is a yahoo problem there is nothing you can do to fix it.<br>  <br>  The fact is until yahoo gets around to fix this problem your only alternatives are to wait for the fix or use your yahoo avatar.<br>  <br>  Note: this glitch has accured before (5/6 months ago) and it took almost two weeks before the 360 avatars showed.|`|cb1c8e5fcd8492bc3787fd1b614481ecaa	Everything You Ever Wanted To Know About Your Avatar.<br>  <br>  Your avatar can be a cartoon figure or a photo. The cartoon figure is also used in Yahoo Messenger and appears on some customized Yahoo pages. The photo only appears in Yahoo 360 and Yahoo Answers. If you do not have an avatar then a shadow of a male figure appears. It can't be changed to female.<br>  <br>  № 1. If you want a cartoon figure then go to <a href="http://avatars.yahoo.com">http://avatars.yahoo.com</a> and create or modify one and then go to № 3. If you create one of the wrong sex then it can be changed in "preferences".<br>  <br>  № 2. If you would rather have a photo then you must upload it to Yahoo 360 from your computer.  If it is on the web then download it first. Create a Yahoo 360 account if you don't have one. You can get one at <a href="http://360.yahoo.com">http://360.yahoo.com</a> . Click on the "My Page" tab and then "Edit Personal Photos". You are allowed to upload up to four photos there from your computer. Mark the one you want to use as your avatar as primary.<br>  <br>  № 3. Now for either a cartoon or a photo save everything and go back to Yahoo Answers. Click on your old avatar in Yahoo Answers which brings you to your profile. Now go to "Edit My Info". You can pick the cartoon or photo to use.  BE SURE TO PREVIEW AND SAVE (OK) THE PAGE AT THE BOTTOM. Shortcut: <a href="http://answers.yahoo.com/my/my_edit">http://answers.yahoo.com/my/my_edit</a><br>  <br>  NOTE: Many people are having problems with the Yahoo 360 avatar showing up.

If you are discovered using the school/company computers for restricted sites, you will endure severe consequences. It's honestly not worth the tough repercussions involved.<br>  There are plenty of sites your computer will allow that are far better than that, and worth your time. Attempting to dodge security software processors will land you in sharp consequences.<br>  They are blocked for several reasons, and there is no changing that.

But the lowering of the age limit to 13 (from 18) and the closing of the message boards (releasing hordes of 'trolls') has caused the site to deteriorate over time. It can STILL be used well -- but you have to be extremely discriminating to do that, and expect to get a lot of 'trash' answers.

They'll never get rid of the childish, immature questions, or the totally useless silly questions.  But we have to be somewhat knowledgeable before taking to heart any answers given here.  You have to be a good judge of the quality of answers.  I don't ask many questions, but I asked one recently about filing an amended return (researched it first), and knew after the first answer that I didn't need any further answers.  You just have to have that instinct to be able to judge the quality and accuracy of an answer.  I'm not sure if I answered your question, but basically... proceed with caution and trust your instincts.|`|sCehoTIsaa	depends whether the question itself is silly. yes many don't take this site seriously, but it depends with me, good sensible questions get good answers and sometimes i might give a slightly silly answer that's a bit obvious.|`|fB8ujUVNaa	You have to be your own filter.
