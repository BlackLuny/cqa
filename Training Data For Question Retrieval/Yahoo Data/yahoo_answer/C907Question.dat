I also can't believe why the financing institutions or banks choose to give the homeowners the foreclosures instead of giving the home owners more time to pay their debts? What's the logic reasons about that since we always watch on TV, or commercials, or emails that someone else can buy a foreclosing house for $100, $300, $500 or what ever amounts that can't make sense. Why banks choose to do that instead of giving more time to the home owners? What is the difference for banks and what banks get it finally if the banks sell the foreclosing homes for that cheap? Or do those commercials just a bullshit???

I have a bulging disc between my L4-L5 vertebrae and a ruptured disc between my L5-S1.

Currently, I understand, that Obama is working on something for homeowners who find themselves behind on mortgage payments. However, it does nothing for those who are managing. My son is upside down in his house and he had an ARM. So there is really no cap on how high his payment can go and it has increased $800 over the past 12 months.       He doesn't qualify for help. You must be in default.       He explained that his house payment now represents 65% of his monthly income and was surprised to learn there is no provision for the income to debt ratio- which is a formula they use to qualify you for a home.  He took a second job to make his payments but is working 80 hours a week. I told him to go into default. What do you all think?      Bottom line, isn't a sad state of affairs where the government is practically making people and business go bankcrupt?  I understand that it is more financially advantage currently for a mortgage company to let you default because of the percentage of bailout money they receive when they lose you. It would seem that the only people getting help are the very poor or the very rich.

I was recently exercising my FACT options and trying access my free annual credity report, when trying to access the EQUIFAX report, it popped up stating that in July of 2003 I had applied for a mortgage loan.       Weird. Mainly because, in July of 2003 I was SEVENTEEN. And living in my parents' house, going to High school, all that good stuff. After some research, I discovered that my parents can be the only possible people who would be able to have enough information, and use said information, to do something like that.          So mainly my question(s) is; is that possible? Is it possible for a parent to use a child's information under the age of 18 to access things like that? Granted, I turned 18 in November of 2003, but I was 17 in July, if I don't remember anything about that year, um MY AGE would definitely be something I can clearly recall.       Secondly, what do I do about this? I wasn't even able to access my report because I simply clicked "I don't know/does not apply to me" for all of the questions regarding the loan, as that was the truth. I have no clue. So, I don't even know if this loan was approved, paid off or not, how much, or how deep this even goes. I'm 22 now, trying to get back into school (I took some time off to get away from my family and get my self back on track, financially speaking), and have had extremely minimal contact with my family in years. For all I know, they could be living it up on my credit :/ What do I do? Any help will be very much appreciated. Thanks so much.

(~ 100-200 / month)      My question is, since I'm contributing towards the loan payments, but not legally responsible for them, is this considered "my" debt for purposes of mortgage evaluation?  I heard they look at all your loans, credit cards, obligations etc.  since i'm not married i'm not legally obligated for someone else's debts. does it matter, if I only get a mortgage in my name?  or do they scrutinize everyone who could be living in a house I want to purchase/get a mortgage for?

20090304103405AArq0ls	Business & Finance;Investing	Mutual funds transferred to an Index fund?	Hey, certainly not the right place to ask important financial questions but did need some quick clarification...      Listening to NPR today and one of the top performing investor's overall recommendation was that basically, a basic index fund will, on average, out perform any Mutual fund.  And, because Index funds have less fees associated with them, the investor really will make out far better in the long run.  His advice was, of course, not to pull your money out of your investment account but to perhaps transfer it to an Index Fund.      Since this was really limited information, my question was really about how the mutual fund works.  I've lost, say, 30k in the 3 different mutual funds I have now.  Shouldn't I just leave the money in (since it's already a loss) and hope the value goes up in the next 10 years?  Or, within the mutual fund are the stocks constantly trading so the stock my mutual fund holds now, will not be the same stock in it 10 years from now.  If the later is the case, I can see why moving it to an index fund makes sense.  But if investors usually keep the same core stocks, then isn't transferring my money to an Index fund the same as pulling out of the market?  Does this make sense?

20090304134153AAFif6Y	Business & Finance;Taxes;United States	I received a 1099-a on a foreclosed property in April of 2008 in CA. Why not a 1099-c?	I received a 1099-a on a foreclosed home. It states I am not liable for the loan according to the 1099-a. It shows the Loan value and FMV and FMV is much lower than the loan. Do I report that difference as income? Does the mortgage debt forgiveness act protect me from being taxed that amount? Countrywide tells me that there is no recourse on my loan therefor I get only a 1099-a. I keep finding articles about 1099-c being given to people to take advantage of the mortgage debt forgiveness act but nothing on a 1099-a. Am I supposed to report the difference between the loan value and Fair Market Value and be taxed on that even though the mortgage debt forgiveness act is in affect? Do I still fill out a 982?

20090304140040AAr6CQx	Business & Finance;Taxes;United States	How long does it take for your State Return to be accepted?	I efiled my taxes at efiletaxreturns.com 4 days ago, and I noticed my federal return was accepted (3 days ago), but my state return is still waiting acknowledgement.  How long does it normally take for the state return to be accepted? I'm not sure if I made a mistake or not.  I had prepared everything 1 month ago at efiletaxretuns, then just signed in again this week, clicked a bunch of 'continues' and filed both at the same time.  When I was done, I noticed my state return was $673, which was obviously wrong, since it had previously shown $7, and another site, turbotax, had shown $7 also.  Later that day, I went back to efiletaxreturns and it had been changed to $7, so it should be right, but why did it initially say $673 right after efiling?  So very confusing.. any answers are appreciated!

Alright, with all the excitement in Washington about the discussion on Health Care and affordability I have grown curious.  Why do we need health care?  Why does it exist?  It seems like it's a big money gouging organization.  Can someone explain the gears of it to me?        For example, we know why their is a credit problem.

Clinton raised the personal income tax to 39.6% (same as the present plan) during a recession and that triggered the largest expansion ever. The republicans said that the economy would tank.      Europe has much higher taxes than the US and since 1995 their markets have either performed as well or outperformed the US market.

20090304151545AAeXmBJ	Business & Finance;Renting & Real Estate	How to phrase a misdemeanor conviction for larceny in the best way on a lease agreement?	I am filling out an application for an apartment that I really would like to be accepted for. Toward the end of the app. it ask if I have been convicted of any felonies or misdemeanors and I was convicted of a misdemeanor for larceny when I was 17. Three friends and I broke into our high-school to screw a with a teachers room that we disliked. We did that and that was supposed to be the end of it but one of the other guys on the way out saw the video projector in the middle of the room and wanted to take it. We were in a rush to get out so no one told him not to, we were just like "whatever, lets go!" So eventually when we were turned in the only thing we were charged with was larceny and we had to serve 20 hours community service and pay $4000 for the projector even though it was recovered from the guys house undamaged. So this is a pretty horrible sounding story that we stole $4000 dollars from a public school. How should i describe this conviction on the three lines provided on the application. I'm not sure how to take the punch out stealing from a school. I'm desperate for this apartment because I will be saving $150 from what I am paying now which is slightly more that half my income.

For anyone who works in Human Resources or does a lot of interviewing for jobs...what answer do you want to hear for why did you quit your job before securing a new job?  Does having a gap between jobs hurt my chances of getting a new one?      I've been unemployed for about 2 months and am currently job hunting again.  I quit my last job because I didn't agree with some of the company's practices and because it was a long commute to get there everyday.  At the same time, I wanted personal time to travel and be with family because it is right around the 1yr anniversary of my father's passing.        So when I'm asked this question, I answer that I didn't enjoy the commute so I left and I took personal time off.  If I'm applying for a job that would require me to commute, what should I say?  In reality, I am willing to commute a long distance but I just would rather start out with a new company.

I'm working in an architectural firm 2 yrs after getting my master degree.

I talked to them but they didn't really trust that I can learn fast.they think I should focus on drawing instead of technical stuff.       but in order to become a good designer, I need to learn tech stuff. now I'm starting to doubt about it, sure it's not my strength, should I just focus on my drawing skills and become a good renderer (who makes a lot of money too)? or should I try working on my tech skills and hope one day I'll become a good designer?

I want to be a day trader and make money in stocks. I've made so much money from stocks, but that was just by buying and sitting on them for a while. If I wasn't working, I could watch stocks everyday.      So if your only income comes from stocks, how much do you typically make a month? What's your strategy?       Suppose I had $100K....my plan would be to split it up among 10 stocks...so $10K each. And then whenever any stock makes a 3 to 5% gain, sell it off....and that's $300 to $500 I just made. If all 10 stocks make a small gain of 3% in a day, that's $3000!! I know I probably won't be able to make that everyday, but if I could do that once a week I'd be very happy!!!

He filed for divorce but his wife changed her mind and wanted to get back together with him. When he said no, she got mad and took him to court over custody of their two children for revenge (she admitted this). My cousin has very little money and just lost his job though so he could not pay for a lawyer and ended up representing himself. His wife, on the other hand has two very rich uncles who financed her. Because of this, she ended up winning custody over the children and my cousin isn't even allowed to see them. Now he's jobless, losing his house, divorced his wife and spent even penny he had trying to recieve custody over his children. He's extremly depressed and just wants his kids. Does anyone have ANY ideas on what he can do to get them back? Please!

20090304150923AAw6mUN	Business & Finance;Renting & Real Estate	How can a two-person townhouse be using 67kw of power per day?	For the past two months, my roommate and I have received shocking bills.  We are being charged for an average consumption of 67kw per day - which seems impossible!      We have:      - a fridge (very old and loud, I worry that it's sucking a lot of energy..)   - a stove   - a deep freezer (energy star)   - a tea kettle, toaster, and toaster oven which we keep unplugged when not using   - two laptop computers   - a tv which is only used about 4-6 hours per week between us.   - hot water (we limit showers to every other day, and the hot water doesn't last beyond 10 minutes in the shower anyways, so it's not too much consumption)      Our last bill was $187, so we immediately buckled down on the heating.  We turned our heat down from 18*C to 15*C (brr).  We keep the lights off until very late at night.  Our bulbs are the coiled, green kind.  From changing the heat, we reduced the cost from $187 to $182, which is barely a difference considering how we can feel the difference inside the house heating-wise.      The bill is still filed under the name of the previous tenant, and they actually have pretty much the same usage on the graph.  They used 62kw average per day last year for the same two months.      Do you have any idea what could be sucking so much energy?  For only two people, that usage amount is terrible! :O

20090227080419AAKBsrE	Business & Finance;Careers & Employment;Other - Careers & Employment	Question about whether or not to send in reference letters?	I made it through the first cut on a job as a tour guide. Part 2 asked us for references. Now, I made the mistake of thinking that they needed reference LETTERS so I got those, but now that I look at the application again they may just be asking for names and phone numbers. My question is, do you think I should send in those reference letters anyway, since I have them? I'm thinking they might give me an extra edge for the job, and I'm thinking that if they didn't want letters they just don't have to read them. Or should I just give them waht they ask for, just the names and contact info? It is for a tour company that seems to have a really fun and relaxed environment. What does everyone think?   Thanks in advance...

We just moved out of a house we were renting for exactly 1yr. we have a big family that includes children. The children stained the carpet here and there with koolaid and basically that's it.. but now as were moving the landlord wants to sue us for the stains!! bcuz i guess supposedly the carpets so bad she cant rent out the house like that. she now wants us to pay for entirely new carpeting throughout the whole house.. shes given us an option to either sue us or charge us $3,000 for entirely new carpeting. when we moved in the carpet wasn't even new.. it had tears on the door edges. so why should we pay for new carpet when it wasn't even new when we moved in the house?  Wouldn't our carpet situation be Wear & Tear?? or does she really have a case on us? she also wants to charge us money to repaint that whole house.. why, i don't know.. but the walls were not freshly painted when wee moved in..! isn't it her job as a landlord to repaint and everything? why should wee pay all this money to put in brand new paint and carpeting(the whole house but the kitchen & bathrooms carpet) when it wasn't new when we moved in and shes the landlord, where is she doing her part? we are willing to pay 2 maybe 3 hundred dollars for the carpet as contribution if she wants to get a new carpet, but that's all, that landlord seems to be being a little ridiculous no? Were not getting our deposit back, and thats ok. but now she wants moree money for this and that.. can she do all this? please help!!      The New House we've just moved into has such an awesome landlord, before we moved in he repainted the whole inside of the home and has offered to deduct money off the bill in regaurds to a new sink faucet. see he put in some work..repainting and such.. the other house's landlord has not. what the heck..........

I am currently working for a growing company, and our Office Mgr., has recently  resigned.  I've been taking on so much here at work.  I'm overloaded with all sorts of new tasks!  I am currently doing the following: accounts payable, ALL payroll, credit applications, keeping track of all vendors, inventory, filing, scanning, faxing, answering phones, compiling excel spreadsheets, HR + keeping track of all paperwork for new hired employees, and SO much more!  Also, they've been paying for my classes for payroll, excel, quickbooks, etc...  Im telling you what...I am incredibly OVERLOADED here.  They're in the process of hiring a new Office Mgr., however, since I have been taking on all of these responsibilities, do you think they would consider giving me a raise?  The reason I've been pondering on this, is for the following:   1) They gave me a raise in November '08 ($10 to $12 hrly)   I've been with this company a year and a half   2) They're paying for my classes (to advance in the company) and books   3) I dont have a college degree, however, I am still attending college.         I REALLY hope that all of this helps anyone out there that can help me decide if I should ask for a raise or not, and for how much?     I mean, I kind've see it like this: They're probablly thinking, if we can pay her a crappy $12 per hour and load her with all kinds of work...we are saving oodles of money!!  But for me, it is saddening.  Honestly.
