Soy alumno de ultimo a?o de bachillerato y tengo 16 a?os. no tengo ningun defecto o virtud importante puesto que me considero otro del monton, un comun denominador pues. El a?o pasado tenia amigos y siempre me reia y la psaba bien pero ahora no tengo nada que ecir y la gente solo me usa porque soy buen estudiante. Mi problema es que el estar solo en mi liceo se considera como lo peor asi que prefiero estar mal acompa?ado que solo. Tambien mis padres quieren que entre a la universidad pero no estoy seguro de estar preparado para eso puesto que nunca hago nada sin que alguien me acompa?e y si nadie me acompa?a simplemente no lo hago.

20080204084815AAikoxv	Health;Women's Health	Ayuda medica-Mi hermanito sufrio de dos invaginaciones intestinales.?	Mi hermanito tiene dos a?os, lo operaron dos veces una a los 4 meses y otra a los 8 meses.   Cada tanto anda con serios problemas intestinales, y con muchos parasitos, que le producen mucha diarrea y vomitos. Mi mama es nutricionista,por lo que el balance de las comidas es el apropiado.   Otras cosas que le pasa es que se endurece mucho a veces, y le recetaron Lactulon para evitar ese problema.      La cirujana lo vio hace un par de meses y dijo que no podia ser por las operaciones, ella es la mejor cirujana infantil de la zona.       Y si no son problemas en los intestinos es en la garganta.   Le da bronquitis,o serias inflamaciones en las amigdalas. Y estan haciendo tratamiento para no operarlo, esta tomando corticoides, creo que es asi el nombre.      Puede que le agarren tantos problemas, por las defensas bajas? Hay vitaminas o comprimidos que el pueda tomar para levantar las defensas?      Es muy bebe para que sufra tantas enfermedades y eso a mi mama la tiene muy preocupada.      Gracias!

I always get the normal "old blood day" the day after my period and this month I did and then it went to normal CM like every month. This yesterday I woke up and there was light pink on the T.P I didn't think much of it, I used a pantie liner just in case, throughout the day the color changed from light pink to brownish red to red. then back to brownish red. My boyfriend and I had sex last night and after sex There was bright red on the t.p it only lasted 5 mins or so. I had a little spotting when I got up this morning. Then it turned to a little more, more of a VERY light period. and it's still like that. Does this sound like implantation to you? I don't know what else it could be?! I'm still using a pantie liner and there are some spots here and there, Also I used the bathroom..number 2 (sry TMI) and the "blood" dripped out of me. only small drops, but i was pushing.   Listen I know that it is unlikely for someone to get pregnant, right before, on or right after there period but I do know it happens. I'm not asking for ovulation times and what the norm is, I'm asking about Implantation bleeding only.Thanks!!!!! :)

20090223124346AAdXPBb	Health;Women's Health	How do you get over the pain of a miscarriage?	In Nov I was taken to the hospital because i was having very bad pains in my stomach. Like cramps but way worse. I didnt think I was pregnant but knew there was a possibility. I was 16 days late. But when the cramps wouldnt go away and I had light bleeding I went to the hospital. I had a million tests done. They took a preg test and said it was neg, so they sent me to have xrays, then they told me the test turned positive. I shouldnt of had those xrays I joked cause i wasnt sure what they were telling me was true. So I had an ultrasound. there was a lump on my ovary. That was my baby. Obviously you cant have a pregnancy on your ovary, so they waited to see if my body would absorb the baby or if I would need something else to terminate the preg. For the next 10 days that followed, I miscarried, and waited for my hcg levels to become normal again. It was very painful. one of the hardest things ive ever had to deal with. I was 4-6 wks, not ready to have a child, im planning my wedding, and we want to have children later on but im still hurting and in pain.

20090223144604AAGnSAo	Health;General Health Care;Other - General Health Care	Heartburn question/help?	In the United States, almost 50% of the population has heartburn at least once a month; 7% have it daily. Heartburn is even more common during pregnancy, with about 1 in 4 women reporting it daily at some point during their pregnancy. Statistics on acid indigestion are difficult to find because the definition is vague, but it's probably almost as common as heartburn. What is the difference between heartburn and acid indigestion? What are some preventions and treatments for each?

20090223152551AA43kwc	Health;Men's Health	Does clamping really work?	Clamping is a technique that uses a constricting device, such as a shoe string, cable clamp, or a tight cock ring. The clamp is firmly tied, clamped, or put, respectively, on the base of the erect penis while "edgeing" (extended masturbation) with a firmly erect penis. Extreme caution should be used to prevent permanent damage to the tissue, and never use a metal cock ring, as they can become impossible to manually remove due to trapped blood i.e. engorging of the penis.      From Wikipedia.

In January I had two period which is strange for me but my periods are not always exactly right. For the past week or two I have been having some pain in my lower stomach(around my ovaries and mostly on the left) and a little pain in my lower back(also mostly on the left) I have also had some pressure like right at my belly button that almost feels like I have to pee but I don't. Last week it hurt when I had sex and this week it hurt after not during. I have been very tired. I have not had sore breast. Today I woke up and felt a little sick at my stomach and the I went to eat breakfast and ordered scrambled eggs with cheese ( I had been wanting then since yesterday. When I was about half way done with my eggs I started gagging. I am not suppost to have a period for another four days. I am going crazy not knowing. Could I already be experiencing early signs of pregnancy? I have a pregnancy test but I don't want to waste it if it is to soon.       Also I have been pregnant twice before and the first time I found out only because of bad pain in my lower right side of my stomach and went to the er. The second time, within 24 hours of finding out I was in the er again with same pains, the dr said the pain was just from being pregnant.

It's just that yesterday when I went to one health store to buy some "whey protein shake" (for the first time) one of the workers there told me that I should only start taking it protein shakes when im in really good shape (intermediate/advanced Weightlifter).

20090223152449AACAfXl	Health;Mental Health	Do i have depression?	For quite some time now, this has been my behavior....   Some days I feel like it would be better if nobody talked to me, and I didn't have to talk to anyone.      Sometimes it is hard for me to even fake a smile to someone. I'll try to be nice and laugh at jokes or even look like I care, just for the other persons sake and I can't.      I hardly have any interest in sex anymore. The only time I do is when I'm drunk and I feel better about my body.      Most days I just want to be alone and left alone. I find myself caring less when people talk too long I find myself getting very irritated.      I don't have the feelings of life is not worth it or thoughts of suicide, its just lack of caring...sometimes I feel like when I'm looking at someone, desperately trying to pay attention to what they are saying, that I'm just giving them a blank empty stare, because that is what I feel.      Is this just "the blues" or could I have depression?

20090223134930AASR92E	Health;Mental Health	Anxiety issues..advice please!?	O.k., so I am 16 years old and I might have a problem dealing with anxiety or something like it.  You see, I grew up going to a Catholic school.  It was really strict there, you know with uniforms and church and all.  Then in 6th grade i started going to a public school.  I mean, I started out as a shy kid but eventually started getting used to the freedom and diverse people.  Then in 7th grade everything started to go downhill.  I starting developing an eating disorder.  I dropped 20 pounds and luckily stopped starving myself; however, in 8th grade I started binge eating and gained 40 pounds in only a few months.  So now here I am in 10th grade.  My weight is normal, I get extremely good grades, and I have lots of friends.  But, I feel like I am going crazy!  I'm constantly worrying about everything!  From grades to speaking in public, you name it!  I remember I was seriously freaking out about a test because I though I failed it.  I came home crying and my mom almost called my teacher! The next day I get the test back and I got a 96.  And this happens with EVERY SINGLE TEST I TAKE.  Currently, I started going through these weird periods of depression.  I stop taking showers, I eat extremely irregularly, and all I want to do i curl up into a ball and hide.  The strange thing is, these periods of depression come and go.  I'm really not sure why I am experiencing these horrible thoughts.  Recently, I started obsessing over my cat and I am constantly afraid she is going to die.  Also recently, I feel as though all I want to do is run away from the stress and anxiety and live in some remote area.  I keep having reocurring dreams about moving into a more peaceful environment.  Someone please give me some advice?  No one, not even my doctors are listening to me (I have trouble talking to people, so whenever I tell someone about this it always comes out wrong and they get the wrong impression!).

20090223141547AARtHyd	Health;Men's Health	A question about my penis and about puberty?	Hi there, I am 13 years old and just have a few questions.      At the other side of my penis, there is a red line going up the middle of it, is this normal?      Also, to the side of that, and at the tip of my penis, around it there are some prinkly dots - what is this and is it normal?      Also - I have some hairs on my arms, kind of rising up and they were lightly coloured but now they are black.   On my testicles, there are hairs which are black and some are quite long although I don't have any hair above my penis and there are some quite thin layers of hair there which are barely noticable.      Am I going through puberty, and have I got anything to be worried about with the line and prinkly things?      Thank you :)

20090223150307AAPtnUO	Health;Men's Health	Please please answerr?	So i met my best friend I've ever ever had at the begining of the school year this year. We met in our PE class and decided to hangout one weekend. Ever since then we were inceprable. We did absolutly everything together for the next 6 months. We both agreed that we'd always stay best friends no matter what ever happened.    About a month ago her parents caught us up in a lie and told us we couldn't hangout for a month. It sucked but we still hungout anyways. We started not to get along as well we bickered alot but we still always sat together and talked at school.   Then I kind of did something bad (I'm not going to go into detail), i feel really bad for it. Her parents said we couldnt never hangout again. We weren't friends for like a week, but then I apologized to her face to face and she said it was okay and that we are still best friends. I thought everything was going to be okay, but we were sorta akward around eachother. She seemed like she didn't really care if we hungout anymore. She said she did but only said it once and doesn't act like it all.   How am I supposed to stay best friends with someone when there parents hate me?? I mean I wanna stay friends with her because she is still my best friend, its just hard because we can only see eachother at school. I just wish it could go back to the way it was when her parents let us hangout 24/7. Ahhh IDKK WHAT TO DO!!   helpp?

20090223153343AA5kCpH	Health;Other - Health	Help with random drug testing?	This is my situation...I've smoked weed for the past 3 weeks only once each week. I have a fairly high metabolism and have low body fat. I'm wondering how long you think it would take for me to be clean in case i'm drug tested. I've heard that weed leaves ur system in as little as 3 days so i was hoping that i was clean everytime i smoked again each week. If i'm screwed how could i pass the test? Please dont just say dont do drugs cuz that really doesnt help my situation or change my mind. THANKS!
20090223153516AAu5lP5	Health;Mental Health	How do I Recover Psychologically after failing a test?	In math class today, we got our test back. I thought I only missed a few, but ended up getting a 52%.      At first, I tried to shrug it off and think "I've recovered from tests quizzes this bad before, I can recover again surely." So, to say in short, I took it good. Then, at the end of the class, my math teacher has to say "What Happened here? Was it you didn't know the information?" and the face she had just made me feel terrible. She then went on to say that we need to meet and talk about it sometime, which trust me, is the last thing I wanna do...      I'll recover soon, I know, but for now, what's the best way to deal with it? I can't even go 30 minutes without remembering about it =(

20090223154144AAy8ta2	Health;Dental	Pre-Molars and Wisdom Teeth?	Before I got braces I got my pre-molars taken out, if I remember correctly it was because there was a bit of crowding, so they wanted to make space.      I'm getting my wisdom teeth taken out soon, and I was trying to figure out if my top wisdom teeth are impacted.  I have seen my x-ray and it clearly shows my bottom wisdom teeth, one impacted.       So, I decided to count my top teeth, from the front to the back.  I counted from the midline all the way to the back.  The diagrams I saw placed the wisdom tooth at number 8.  Would my wisdom teeth still be at number 8 if I've had my pre-molars taken out?      Yes yes, I can ask my dentist, but he's a French man that doesn't speak English; it's not a life threatening issue anyway.

20090223154359AAVSCdY	Health;General Health Care;Other - General Health Care	Please help me.. False nails have absoluetly ruined my nails?	I have been wearing false nails which i buy from a shop and attach using glue provided for what has been a very long time now. The glue provided is a superglue and is very strong. The glue has absolutely ruined my own natural nails, so much so that my nails are ugly and have gone so small that they will not grow whatsoever. Also, all of my nails appear inflamed. The main problem now is that my own nails have become so bad that i can not leave the house without having false nails on as i am so ashamed and couldn't possibly allow anyone to see the damage i have done to myself. Also, where there is no nail, the skin is very sensitive and hurts when something touches it. I have found i am hiding behind false nails because of how i feel about my own nails. I don't know what to do because i know people will just say stop wearing them, but i seriously could not let anyone see my own nails and i am not in a situation where i do not know what to do. PLEASE could you help me?

20090223154655AArXYzL	Health;General Health Care;Injuries	Should I go get my ankle looked at and have it Xrayed?	Back in 2000 I sprained my ankle really bad and went to the ER and they did an X Ray.  There were torn ligaments.  That healed without surgery but my ankle has always been a little week.   2 weeks ago I sprained the same ankle (right)  really bad.  I elevated it and iced it then wrapped it for a couple days.  I was able to walk on it the same day.  Well I am still having some pain and swelling in my ankle.  The last 3 or so days I have noticed a slight pain going up the outside of my leg and in the middle of my calf on the right leg with the injured ankle it feels really hot inside.  Not hot to the touch but there is a considerable heat feeling inside my leg down to my ankle.   I am still walking on the ankle without problem just a little sore.   I am wandering if there is damage inside my ankle that I should go get looked at or if this is normal and will pass.  Any input is appreciated.  Thanks!
