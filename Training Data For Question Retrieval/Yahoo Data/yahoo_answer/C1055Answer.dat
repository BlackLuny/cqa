i6uzNQcJaa	I play Titleist NXT Tour - great balls for a good price.  they last long too.  or you could try the Bridgestone e6+     --thats a good ball also i used to use them|`|de29070765c097b8f505a737e52df5bfaa	The round one?|`|61d3c794dd357fdcf1196d84a9115571aa	I would definitely have to say any Nike ball on the market is a perfect ball for practice as well as tournament play, they have great feel, durability, and amazing control, I play with Nike's every round and they are my favorite brand of ball on the market, I don't prefer Titleist or Callaway balls, price and marketing is way too overrated for them when a nike brand or even a bridgestone brand is just as good for a lesser price|`|phNBfltAaa	Definitely Titleist Pro V1s.|`|jJ5h7zgjaa	You could get "Recycled" Golf Balls.<br>  They are really cheap and get more than a regular pack.|`|EUrnLHsOaa	i use nike one black but their pretty pricey. but they last for a LONG time!!!!

bADza5pRaa	When the ball is passed to a player who is behind every outfield player in the opposing team.  If the player receiving the pass in onside but there is another player offside, then the play can continue unless the offside player is "interfering with play".<br>  <br>  In my opinion if a player is not interfering with play then he shouldn't be on the park!<br>  <br>  Not sure if you were kidding or not, but that's the offside rule! At least I think it is, they change it every week these days, lol|`|wdYVyZlhaa	anything for you princess.if i thought you would understand it,i wid tell you.that isnt cyber bullying is it.jeezo.im gutted<br>  <br>  hey thomas,20 years she said......and the rest.heheheheheh<br>  <br>  i mean,shes changed her avvie to look younger.hmmmmm.|`|PChsC9traa	Sorry but ladies do no understand football so don't waste your time,<br>  Ladettes will get it though|`|ePFdhsCYaa	As a player passes the ball forward, the moment the ball leaves his foot his team mate he passes to in front of him cannot be beyond the last opposition defender or he will be deemed offside.|`|57edf00d97af522b314c33475bf1e853aa	Bluebell i totally understand why u don't get it...cos i don't either.<br>  My mans tried to show me with ma tea tree candles and no joy....don't understand it and never will.<br>  <br>  He's gets soooo frustrated wae me.lol x|`|DpfJfK6Baa	right, i'm demonstrating it on my table....<br>  <br>  if this packet of baccy is the striker and the lighter is the midfielder passing the ball to him, the salt cellar is the last defender and this half-drunk cup of coffee is the goal keeper then when the lighter plays the ball the baccy is offside if he's between the salt and the coffee.|`|mSZoMKD6aa	Well lets just say their are two versions of the offside rule, 1st is the Worlds version of side and then 2nd theres the Scottish version, where decisions are 70% of the time wrong.<br>  <br>  no wonder your confused Bluebell.|`|VgwXLHl5aa	Okay...........<br>  <br>  Are you kidding???

Q1MI6L96aa	Probably ratings less than TNA. In this country, female wrestlers are "secondary" acts to the men and it would be tough to overcome that industry bias. In Japan or Mexico - for example - the concept has a better chance for success. You can see it with TNA's low-ball contract extension offer to Gail Kim, which has landed her in WWE.|`|smcDn76jaa	Of course it would. The Knockouts have been the highest rated segments in TNA in recent weeks. Plus it would attract more females, guys who think some of the Knockouts are hot, and actual wrestling fans. TNA would have to bring more women wrestlers and add some championship. Also stop having everyone job to Kong.|`|sqfjfR3iaa	Spike TV is not going to give TNA another Timeslot for the Knockouts to have their own show unless TNA were to expand their Roster of Female Wrestlers, add more championships and brigns in wrestlers from Puerto Rico, Japan, Korea, Mexico, the NWA and Shimmer.|`|41WXZPnCaa	Yes <br>  <br>  Why : Most Likely Many Many Guys (I Include My Self) Watch TNA Ko's Match For The Girls But Star Watching OK And The Wrestle Cool<br>  <br>  An Hour Per Week Show Be Cool|`|85aWKsptaa	Hell no|`|HnOIAdTYaa	not as sucsessful as WWE,<br>  but they may get more<br>  attention then they have<br>  now.|`|UDqMdvESaa	No a all women wrestling show wouldn't make it <br>  But TNA Knockouts are much better wrestlers then the WWE divas are|`|gr6bcnztaa	I think it wouldnt be successful as it could have been a few mouths ago|`|N0N9FzEhaa	I think it would be just as succesful as your mom's porn career.

GNmzjDHHaa	drive ur heel into his knee cap, he'll go down like a tall old oak, but u might cripple him so beware|`|Km9QC8a9aa	Nobody wins a fight.<br>  <br>  One person just walks away with fewer injuries.<br>  <br>  Once you've had your fight, you still need to resolve the problem!|`|b0faTDlJaa	Well if you watch UFCs enough like i do youll notice a reacurring phenomanom. It seem the taller and lankier a person is, the softer his chin tends to be, especially if they have a smaller head. I would throw somw power punches to the head, or you could take him down where his height becomes a diadvantage. Just pretend your Little Mac, like on Mike Tysons Punch Out.|`|cFMFNVj8aa	Basic over the shoulder judo throw done very fast and when he is on the ground step on his trachea, or a strait up kick to the groin followed by knees to the face, or dig your fingers into his clavicle and yank down as hard and fast as you can or if you are by a wall you can slam his head into it, or you can shoot in low and get a leg or both then twist and slam him on his neck or head|`|vExQCsNYaa	If your not in martial arts I wouldnt try a lot of kicking. If you don't know how to do it right, you might end up being caught off balance and on the ground. If you do decide to kick, try quick, straight ones to the knees.<br>  Is he a lot bigger than you or is he just tall and skinny? If he doesn't outweigh you by a lot, you can try tackling him (wrap your arms around his upper legs/waist, then lift with your legs). If not, get up close to get rid of his reach advantage and throw uppercuts to the jaw|`|ve4LsVszaa	All things being equal... The bigger fighter wins.  To neutralize the size advantage, you need to learn martial arts, weight train, and get your wind up.  <br>  <br>  Since you can't get trained up before tomorrow, use the element of surprise.  Don't worry about all this angling business. If you had that much skill you would not be here asking.  Just land the first punch and don' t stop until he goes down.  Move your shoulders like pistons left, right, left, right... while imagining punching his head off of his shoulders for power|`|lJJsKvunaa	Can you kick? Your legs have a WAY better range than your arms. If you can kick, you ARE taller than him. Remember that.<br>  <br>  So, fire in leg kicks. Kick HIS legs, right in the knee. With your SHIN. Grab the air with your right hand and pull it toward you (to get momentum, power) and bring up your right knee (or whatever leg your going to kick him with) and then when its in the air, turn it over and drive the shin into his knee/leg like an axe. He'll drop|`|FC0KZ1ySaa	I would say be really fast and angle a lot around him.  throw a lot of punches.  try to stay close to him because once you get past the length advantage that he has on you, you have a better chance.  also keep your guard up all the time.

I mean, think about it, its the internet where people can say whatever they want and not have to worry about any consequences.

3DnX9NmAaa	1. Yes.<br>  <br>  2. No previous training is required. Just walk in, pay $20, and train. However, Hatsumi Soke teaches on such a high level that you may not understand any of it or know how to do it unless you've had previous training in Bujinkan.<br>  <br>  3. Yes, Chiba, Japan.<br>  <br>  4. Bujinkan Budo Taijutsu.

lFLsbDZxaa	All you would have to do is practice jumping and actually palming the basketball, which is hloding the ball in one hand. <br>  <br>  To slam dunk, although, you would have to practice jumping, which I would use ankle wieghts. You starp them to your ankles, go running, walk around with them, etc. <br>  <br>  You will build up needed muscle in your legs that will increase your jumping abilities. Practice jumping in the too.<br>  <br>  Start off with a lower hoop so you can get the technique that you will need to dunk it and gradually move up, eventually you will get to where your slamming like a pro!<br>  <br>  Practice makes perfect!<br>  <br>  Good luck!|`|jjUxcE3Eaa	Absolutely.

AA11307224	Unfortunately there is no substitute for hard work in the area of marketing.  You need to get out and publicize your event.  It will help if you have a larger number of participants, because businesses will be more eager to participate.  <br>  <br>  Go out and offer hole sponserships.  Allow the business to put up a sign on the tee box of each hole they choose to sponsor and charge a set amount to be a sponser (ie $200 per hole sponsored).  I'd also go out and try to get your local sports talk radio show involved.  Many of them will allow you to come on during the week and talk about the event.  If you could land a celebrity to play, then you can have people "bid" to play with the celebrity.  They do this for benefit tournaments in the Nashville area.  Usually local celebrities will participate, and there have even been some events that Vince Gill, Amy Grant, etc.  have come out to support the cause.  People will pay to play with high profile people.  <br>  <br>  Mostly, just emphasize the cause that you are playing for.  Most people still have good hearts and will jump up to help out.|`|2xlCj4utaa	get some naked girls on each hole

mber3JoAaa	I'm also looking forward to see Andrew Jones playing, it'll be interesting to see what his eye is like now (he turns 50 in a couple of  months time).

I'm also looking forward to seeing how Mr Blewett goes.<br>  <br>  Fleming doesn't really excite me as much as he should, but this is because he has had a poor run of form playing for Wellington in the domestic t20 series, so I don't expect him to score too many.|`|N9pKHpngaa	Andrew Jones<br>  an awesome batsman who's played in Martin Crowes time so therfore did not get the recognition he deserved<br>  goona have a laugh at doully as well :]|`|YULPhBBHaa	Bichel & Healy.|`|BJ7XidIVaa	fleming,marshall and sachin cause they are the only players from the list i have seen playing...lolz|`|fsLMFIpgaa	Don't know whether we'll get it here, but I'd sure like to see Blewett again, also Fleming.|`|AA11088802	sachin.. but hes not playing|`|8T0Z0Y17aa	I unfortunately won't be able to see it (It sounds like it will be a good game!) but, if I were, Stephen Fleming would probably be the most exciting prospect for me.

IsQckOXraa	it is a major technique is skating <br>  it definitely looks alot cleaner and more proffesional <br>  it helps with changing edges too<br>  backwards crossovers are  used to gain speed to go into jumps and spins and to enter almost every jump.<br>  haha yeah  they are pretty important<br>  :)|`|S5fJrwGkaa	1) shows skill and technique<br>  2) nice body alignment<br>  3) gain speed and skate around the corners<br>  4) looks better<br>  5) spins and jumps|`|lnRMmSeyaa	it gives your more speed, and it looks cleaner then just stroking, and its a key element for going into jumps and spins<br>  <br>  figure skater of 6 years|`|ef729c7cc01585401c5937bb2ee1e6b8aa	its for turning corners and for speed.|`|uXJEisNlaa	Crossovers are very important in figure skating and ice hockey. In figure skating crossovers look clean and they are a major technique as well. Crossovers are a quick, good-looking, and useful way to gain speed quickly before a jump or before changing directions.<br>       For ice-hockey, crossovers are an important skill used to gain speed around turns or while skating backwards. In ice-hockey the crossovers don't have to look clean but crossovers are definitely needed.<br>       Also, you can't do a forward stroke instead because it would look awkard and a forward stroke is not as efficient. Crossovers are necessary in any ice sport and can help your skating.|`|akA3oJx6aa	It shows skill and you get more pushes out of crossovers. Each crossover consists of two pushes instead of just one. You also need to be able to turn corners and get on edges. It's too limited to just stroke.|`|hL4ETg0iaa	1) You can use them to gain speed on corners and edges<br>  2) You use them to go in to some jumps<br>  3) You use them to go into some spins<br>  4) They can be used to transfer from one skating element to another|`|AjqO1aJgaa	How else do you plan to get round corners fast?<br>  <br>  It's also a very early, very basic, "step". You know, the sort that skaters use to make up their programs. Brian Joubert wouldn't be half so impressive if all he did was forward stroke, no?|`|KkRb3paPaa	i think you mean forward crossovers. i'm not sure what it's for but it's a basic move. even though i'm still in the basic levels i still know that as you get in higher levels it builds on the basics. you have to learn a 2 foot turn before you can get to a 3-turn.  and it's probably the same with crossovers you have to know how to do it when you get in higher levels, because crossovers are in every skater's programs. it should be easy like how skating around the ice is after you're done with basic 1..lol

AND btw where the flying feck did that performance come from last night, i have to say liverpool didn't look like their usual bunch of headless chickens looking for a kind bounce of the ball.|`|jiFHJ6daaa	united............|`|EIsnATLxaa	I'm a liverpool fan and i think that arsenal would be the easiest team for us to beat..but id prefer it if we got athletico/porto/munich|`|bqvOOUwDaa	Chelsea.<br>  But would like to meet Liverpool to have a "revenge" match after last years champions league game, which we lost in the final minutes.|`|duJgBxUoaa	Yea Arsenal, They haven't been at there best lately :)<br>  <br>  @ Across the sea..I wouldn't mind playing United but they most probably will have the ref on there side that's why i didn't say them.|`|iQvkT8Doaa	Chelsea.|`|uXXbegw5aa	Arsenal or Chelsea.. they've never won it ;)|`|tIBZ9Gi3aa	I'd be most comfortable facing Liverpool.Frankly because we have a much better team.With Liverpool,if you can neutralise Gerrard and Torres,you're 50% safe,as we have shown in the League several times,this season notwithstanding.Ferdinand and Vidic have shown more than capable of shutting Torres out.Rafael can match Babel for speed,and Kuyt's industrious efforts will earn him nothing against Evra.Providing Anderson is fit,he'll be deployed to mark Gerrard,which Anderson has done brilliantly in the past.So our backline has basically shut out your whole attacking force.<br>  <br>  But with the luck of the draw,I'm pretty sure United would be facing Chelsea or Bayern in the quarters.|`|xU7AaQOdaa	As a Liverpool Fan, Chelsea, for two reasons:<br>  <br>  1/ We have History against Chelski, and most of our team know that!<br>  <br>  2/ Arsenal at that time will know their probable fate for next season- CL or Europa Cup- and if it is the former they may go all out for it! They have to click sometime this season!<br>  <br>  PS: Nobody wants Man U!|`|WdOAxQmoaa	hmmm man utd or cheslea  they would give us space to play football.  more comfortable with cheslea also.<br>  <br>  but liverpool wouldn't be a bad thing, i thought Arsenal demolished liverpool on two legs ,just a little bit of luck then we would of won.<br>  <br>  but yeh cheslea.|`|cf4d6d60fab75efc136a4d66dd5c03b4aa	Difficult, I would like to see an all English final.

For example, Penn State-Pitt is gone, but Penn State now has a big rivalry with Ohio State. Many Ohio State fans have said that the rivalry with Penn State is slowly overtaking the rivalry with Michigan in importance.<br>  <br>  EDIT: Cal Grad, Penn State rarely loses in bowl games, let alone gets blown out. Only blowout in bowls I know of for PSU is the 1992 Blockbuster Bowl where they lost 3-24. And that may not really be a blowout. Penn State has won 3 out of the past 4 bowl games, against the ACC champ, SEC third place team, and Big XII 4th place team respectively, losing only to USC, and has won the Big 10 two out of the past four years.|`|QtjnmEzoaa	Well, Michigan sucks, so the big OSU and Michigan game is pointless.<br>  Notre Dame has been sub-par the past couple of seasons, so all of their many rivalries don't mean anything.<br>  Oklahoma vs Texas, Texas vs. Texas Tech are huge right now because those teams are actually good. <br>  Florida and LSU is big because, again, those teams are good.<br>  So many rivalries have died down because the ability of the teams and coaching staffs involved have taken a plunge.|`|HtYGxZcCaa	throughout the years some teams just havent been able to keep up with the success of other teams<br>  <br>  rivalries like Duke-UNC,Michigan-Ohio State,Florida St-Miami,Florida-Georgia,Texas-Oklahoma will always be there, its just the smaller rivalries that have died down when one teams fade away or leaves a conference.

If there was much there they continue and rekindle when the records even out again.  Other rivalries, form as competitions get closer between other teams.  You don't have to be NC quality to have a rivalry or there  wouldn't be very many.  A lot of responses here wrongly think if you aren't going for a top ten national spot, it isn't a rivalry.

Its just that some teams have started to take a step or two backwards, thus diminishing the national media's interest.  Take the Big Ten.  The conference as a whole is down, so even though OSU-Mich. is still a big rivalry, its just that the rest of the country is no longer interested in it.

Only 2 Great rivalries left that can become a Big deal: Texas-Oklahoma and Auburn-Alabama.|`|bfeQ3miMaa	A number of reasons.  Take Notre Dame.  I think part of their downfall is directly tied to ending their rivalry with Miami.  Then claiming Navy as a top rival.

Id just like to add that since Wengers been here, he has spent less than everton and aston villa...yet people never stop praising the likes of those clubs for challenging for uefa cup spots every year. The success that wengers bought to the club and the way in which he has done it is amazing when you consider his resources.<br>  Barcelona come crawling every summer to try take the players that Wenger made, and if Wenger left Arsenal, theyd be first in line to come and try take him too.<br>  And liverpool fans - please stop living in the past.|`|LdJFFvSVaa	He's refused to follow the mainstream way of thinking which is buy as many expesinve players as you can and hope most of them are a sucsess!|`|nJ5kceMBaa	Arsenal just haven't ever been as big as England's top two clubs, Liverpool and Man United, and don't have the finances to buy their way to the top like Chelsea have.

Most of the mentioned players cost their teams large amounts of money to get while Arsenal used to promote players from their youth academy or buy some young players and make them MUCH better.

HZvdr8VLaa	Correct me if I am wrong, but I think Ohio is similar to Tennessee as far as sales go between private citizens... which is , NO RULES.  As someone else said, "give me the cash and you have purchased a weapon.   Private sales like this are a felony in Illinois and some other places, which is ridiculous.|`|kQSSz2X2aa	It depends on which sate you are in. If you buy a firearm from another non-FFL dealer in a private sale you usually do not have to get a background check or do anything at all. You will need to check on what your local laws are. A quick call to your local police department will let you know about your local rules/regulations.<br>  <br>  You can also sell it on gunbroker.com or another gun sales website. You can also go to a local gun show and sell it. Another option is selling it to a gun shop.<br>  <br>  Just make sure you get a couple of different opinions about the price and bring a third party with you who knows about haggling and gun prices so you don't end up selling it below market value.|`|mFa5ZDtcaa	I give you money, you hand me gun (or vice versa). I have at times drawn up a bill of sale listing the serial number, model number, etc. I don't sell to underage buyers.<br>  <br>  If I don't like you or your looks, I won't sell you my gun.<br>  <br>  It's how I have did it for 20 years. Never had a problem.<br>  <br>  As I no longer sell my guns, I don't worry about it anymore.|`|AVQzBE0daa	This is a "loophole" the anti-gunners have vowed to close.<br>  A free man can sell his property to another free man, in this case a firearm.<br>  You should and are obligated in some states to retain information of the transaction. Serial #, ID # of buyer and seller, and of course you want a signature to CYA.<br>  In some states this data must be kept for a minimum period-10 yrs. <br>  you can go through a licensed FFL but that may yield less $.<br>  Anyone in the Military would likely have access to an FFL on base who might help out too.|`|OYy1OmDPaa	Sell firearm back to dealer to prevent gun grabbing jack booted thugs' accusations later that you were a straw buyer operating an illegal business.|`|AA10652652	It depends on the state on how pistols and rifles are sold, but you can always use any gun dealer as a middle person.|`|392fb9fe3924e0ea502b517efe20098daa	There is nothing stopping you from just selling the firearm to someone else.  The problem is, there is no record of the transaction or any screening of the person you sold the firearm to.  This is another way criminals can get firearms.  The really bad news is that firearm is still registered to you so be careful who you sell a firearm to.  At the very least, get a signed bill of sale from the person.  If they won't do that, then something isn't right.  The best way is to go thru a licensed firearm dealer and let him/her do the proper paperwork.  This person may charge $20 or so, but it will be worth the trouble.|`|QI11kXKNaa	I don't know what state you live in, but in a "free" state like Georgia, you can sell a firearm to another individual without any problems. Private sales are legal here. However, as others will tell you, ALWAYS draw up a Bill of Sale since bad guys prefer not to sign one. In addition, get all the info from the buyer's driver's license/State I.D. Card/CCW Permit on the Bill of Sale and get it notarized for your protection. If private sales spook you a little, try a site like Guns America dot com or Gun Broker dot com.|`|lZuM2pxgaa	Depends on your state. Normally for a private sale you need to make sure the buyer meets the typical requirements (age, mental, etc). In Illinois, for example, all buyers must have a state firearms owner ID card. No need to wait 3 days for a private sale.<br>  <br>  To sell as a business, you need a federal firearms license. I started a business selling out of my closet. An ATF agent came out to interview me, but was fine with the closet (suggested a gun safe). This was many years ago and the requirements are stricter (you probably need an actual store now).

sBrYcT5daa	I had tickets 2006 in Germany. First of all you have to order them online. They ask you what country you support. That's how they make sure to put the hardcore supporters in the same section. In my case, Italy was on the West Stands and the US on the East Stands. If you choose another country (I clicked Germany) they put you in mixed sections.

7bx2XQlqaa	Well it would help to do a little research before you do your bracket.  But I'll give you some tips you might find usefull.<br>  <br>  1.  A 1 seed has never lost to a 16 seed, its automatic.<br>  <br>  2.  At least one 12 seed will beat a 5 seed in the first round.  It happens just about every year, so pick the one that is most likely to happen.<br>  <br>  3.  11 seed vs. 5 seed--->same as above ^<br>  <br>  4.  8 seed vs. 9 seed.  Games are pretty much a toss up, so don't pay attention to who has the higher seed in these games.  Pick the team who is the hottest at that time.<br>  <br>  5.  Pick a low seed (10, 11, or 12) to go far in the tournament, like sweet 16 or even elite 8 if you feel brave.  Every year theres a low seed team who goes far.<br>  <br>  6.  Do not pick all four #1 seeds to reach the final four.  Last year was the first time in history this has happened.  I guarentee, especially this year, this won't happen.  Pick a couple 1 seeds to reach the final four but not all of them.<br>  <br>  Here are some teams who I like to go far in the tournament this year.<br>  <br>  North Carolina (i think they're gonna win the championship)<br>  Louisville<br>  Pittsburg<br>  UCONN<br>  Clemson<br>  West Virginia<br>  Arizona<br>  Purdue<br>  <br>  Hope this helps, good luck with your bracket|`|ybWV2ftAaa	In high school, a kid who didn't know anything about basketball won it by doing this system.  Just put the lower seed teams to win over the other tean for every round.  The lower the seed, the better the teams record was during the season(the seed is the little number next to the name of the team...it will be 1-16) 1 is the best teams and 16 are the worst.  When you get to the final four teams, they will all be 1's...just guess from there.  This is the easiest way to win it.|`|miJnMchCaa	If i remember, ill send you my bracket once they are released on march 15. Last year i won the pool out of 15 guys. Im 14 years old and Uconn and UNC are the fav's right now. anything can happen though.
2C8Kjj78aa	It depends on who you are going in for, and where they should be in each serve receive rotation.  I have my team set up so that the libero passes from middle back on 5 of the 6 rotations.  He passes from left back on one rotation.  <br>  <br>  He plays back row for the middle hitters.  Ro 1 for my team has a setter in 1, primary OH in 2, a MB in 3, opposite in 4, second OH in 5 and primary middle in 6.  The libero jumps in for the middle and passes from zone 6.  (We run a 5-1.)  <br>  <br>  Some teams put the libero in for other players, or they line up with a middle behind the setter instead of in front, so my team's serve receive would not work for them.  <br>  <br>  Check your team's SR schematic for the player you're replacing.  I expose my outside hitters and my libero on serve receive and shield everyone else.
ZbNXVQu7aa	Price will be lucky to keep his 2009 ERA under 5.00 when you consider he's moving from the bullpen to the rotation.<br>  <br>  It's virtually impossible to predict how much of an impact Maybin will have in fantasy in 2009, much like it's impossible to predict how his team will fare in the NL East in 2009.<br>  <br>  If Wainwright can stay away from the DL, he's a lock for 15+ wins with an ERA hovering around 3.00 and a decent WHIP.  That kind of production is much better than even the best-case scenario for Price in 2009.<br>  <br>  Hunter is among the few players who is capable of contributing to all 5 standard hitter categories (runs, HRs, RBIs, SBs, and batting average).  Maybin might reach that level as early as 2010, but he won't in 2009.<br>  <br>  In 2009, the player getting Wainwright and Hunter is getting the better end of the deal.  In 2010, the deal might end up being a fair one.  In 2011, it's possible that the player getting Price and Maybin is getting the better end of the deal (although I certainly don't want this to be the case if Price hasn't changed teams between now and then).|`|560bTFitaa	I'm guessing this isn't a keeper league.  Player #1 gets the better return.  In 1 year formats, it is generally better to trust proven track records.  That said, I also really don't see Maybin offering much.  Nor do I see Price pitching more than 150 innings.
Oz7x0faxaa	Because they realized can't do it now so w8|`|piZ4xDBqaa	Only one player on the current Knicks roster is signed past 2010.  Even if they don't sign one of the big name free agents, they'll be in good shape to make some trades with teams desperate to shed a contract or two and get under the salary cap.  Also, there are a lot more big names who will be free agents in 2010 then Wade and LeBron.  The Knicks should be able to sign at least one or to of them.|`|C4mzZwiWaa	so they can get good player or free agents|`|5nAnWp3daa	they just letting go all them big con tract players to hopefully bring some real players to make them compete in 2010. but by no means do the new guys in the ny uniform not play.

A8oU68uBaa	According to some Los Angeles Wrestling Academy students that bought their tickets through Ticketmaster.com, the April 13 Episode of Monday Night RAW will Start at 8:00 PM Eastern Time, 7:00 PM Central (5:00 PM if you watch the USA Network in Los Angeles, California on Dish Network or DirecTV).<br>  <br>  ECW might not take place after RAW, although if you bought your tickets in Atlanta, you should ask any WWE Superstar that enters the arena before the show, OR ask the Box Office rep if ECW will be taped on the same night RAW will be live.|`|3k4tPNTGaa	It is confirmed that this would be a 3 hour show and like last year's Drafts every brand is goin to appear on Raw dt night.

rTSwouqXaa	First off Western riding origin is much different. Western riding developed from the work that cowboys had to do on the large cattle ranches. First off, in Western riding you do not ride your horse ''on the bit''. You ride with a much more relaxed rein. In a western saddle you sit a bit deeper in the saddle. A good western saddle is like riding your horse in a nice comfy seat...this is again due to the fact that as a working cowboy you are working from the saddle for a minimum of 8 hours a day. You need to be comfortable. As far as the style, it is more relaxed seeming. You only hold the reins in one hand because you need the other hand needs to be free to use a rope. <br>  <br>  Every event in Western riding has a use on ranches....even today. I own a ranch and even today many of the things in rodeo are used on not only my ranch but every other working ranch. Now riding in the US will differ depending on what area of the country you are riding in.<br>  <br>  If you like green fields with old forest you can ride in the southern states. If you think you would like to get lost in a sea of the plains with the open sky, the plains states. See the beautiful colors of the SouthWest deserts, the South Western states(whoda thunk). Ride in the mountains so rugged that reach the heavens, the Rocky Mountains.|`|5XV1ZFyqaa	Over the pond they ride side saddle.  The English are not quite sure why someone would want to ride a horse around a barrel.  I am not quite sure why you would want to run a horse over lots of obstacles over a long distance. <br>  Riding western less you hold onto a larger part of the saddle than what the British or English hold onto when they are riding  to fast. or to slow.  :)|`|Caj2XcqPaa	well i ride English and its basically the same thing only we have different terminology my mom was in England when she was a child and said theirs not really a difference

lK1VeYUiaa	You want an accurate throw or a pretty throw?  Either way you just need to practice.  Tried and True activity is the tire or barrel regiment.<br>  <br>  Hang a tire from a tree, pace out 40 yards, try to throw the ball through the tire.  This builds strength in the arm and accuracy.  Same with a barrel for pretty throws aka finesse throws.  Prop a barrel up and try to drop it in the barrel from 40 yards out.<br>  <br>  The yardage can vary but never go below 40 yards.  Try doing them on the run also.

ZbNXVQu7aa	If you have confidence in your other closers, you can afford to part with Qualls, even if you "don't need" Shoppach or Maine.<br>  <br>  If you feel you need Qualls to compete in the Saves category, see about trading CC straight up for Santana.  You already know what Santana's capable of doing for the Mets, but you don't know if CC will be able to handle the pressure of pitching for the Yankees.|`|439bb8e9dd46532d20f20e3ec0b9fa18aa	And...if you do the 3 for 2 trade, you'll have to cut someone to stay at the roster limit.<br>  <br>  I get offered 2 for 1 and 3 for 2 trades all the time.  A lot of people seem to think the can get your quality guys if the send enough volume over to you, regardless of if they are any good or not.|`|mCTmari9aa	I would do it. CC has been overworked and although he is a very cool pitcher to own he is no Johan Santana. Johan for CC and Qualls seems good to me but if he wants to give you the starting catcher for the indians and another solid pitcher in Maine then why not? It goes like this: Johan, Lincecum, Peavy, Webb, CC for me and yahoo rankings. <br>  <br>  I do understand that you dont need a catcher but you are getting the better pitcher. the best in the league. Johan had 6 games he left with a lead only to see his bullpen lose it for him. With krod and jj putz in there he should be a possible 20 game winner. Use what you get in the deal to get another closer from a team that doesnt have a catcher. But if I were you I wouldnt even worry about the closers. Is not like Qualls will be a top 5 closer in the league. Plus theres a lot of closers that dont have the job and a few that have others on their tails. there will be lots of people from FA getting a bunch of saves. Thats just my opinion though.|`|rvyvF3KAaa	Do don't it. Just because he is offering you three people doesn't mean it's a better deal. Also, if you don't need a catcher or another SP, don't make the trade because CC is just as good as Santana.

Home defense NO. As for the suggestion that you use bird-shot for home defense, i would strongly urge you against it.While granted that any shell is better than nothing bird shot was simply not designed to quickly and effectively stop a human or other large creatures. A good tip is to look at what your local LE agency is using and tailor your needs from there. If you ever have to use that shotgun to defend your life it will be easy to justify if a similar gun/ammo combination is found in every patrol car in the city. My suggestion is go with a 12 gauge and use bird shot to plink around with and have the 00 buck for home defense.I even have 1oz rifled slugs on the side saddle just in case.|`|tgROmqffaa	It is an excellent recreational gun.  For a home defense gun you would need buckshot.  With regular birdshot there wouldn't be enough penetration for it to be legal.  It would just stun or make the criminal madder.  Buckshot will have enough power to take someone down that shouldn't be in your house.|`|yeZgbgzVaa	i got 4 Mossberg's and i think they are a little to mutch fore home defense they will work but it's a little big.|`|t6sDVUI4aa	Yeah great gun go for it, I personally like the wingmaster, but I am a Remington fan so most of my American stuff is from them.|`|h2f6j0yiaa	yes|`|YrxLbfiIaa	The Mossberg 500 20 gauge is a decent choice for defense..... The 12 guage is better but for women, people of smaller stature or persons sensitive to recoil the 20 gauge is quite adequate......<br>  <br>  Buckshot is generally about $4.50 a box of 5 cartridges in most stores... <br>  <br>  $200?????   Mossberg 500 20 gauges usually are a little more than that --- Around the holidays I see the regular field models around $200 but most times of the year the defense models are a bit more......|`|fUDlbOP0aa	the shotgun is good, the caliber is not. <br>  unless locally you can find a good supply of 20 gauge buckshot shells and other shotshells besides #7.5 birdshot, 20 gauge isn't as good as 12. 12 gauge while having more recoil, it costs about the same as 20 gauge and has a significantly wider ammo choice as well availability. <br>  <br>  I've been having problems finding any local source of 20 gauge shells for my old 20 gauge shotgun besides #7.5 and #6 birdshot. Birdshot is great for plinking/target, and terrible for home defense as it lacks stopping power and penetration. It I knew beforehand that I would have problems in ammo choice and supply with 20 gauge, I would of gone with a 12.<br>  <br>  ammo for #7.5 birdshot is $21 per 100 at walmart, <br>  Walmart temporarily had 3/4 7/8oz slugs, $3 per 5 shells, <br>  online I found 00 buck 20 gauge for $6 per 5 shells. with shipping it'll be more like 9$ per 5 shells. so without a local supply finding home defense ammo would be fairly expensive.|`|4f6e1488eea68ccac928d6e0d6f6e5caaa	I think you should go for a mossberg maverick, it has a suggested retail for $199.00 and it is able to interchange with most of the 500's parts.  The Maverick comes in a variety of styles including shortened barrels for home defense.  <br>  <br>  Buckshot goes for about a 1.00 per shell, slugs typically are less.  Slugs about 3-4, Buckshot 5-6.  <br>  <br>  Box of 25 birdshot can be had for about 5.00|`|dpSr0icwaa	yes, the mossberg 500 is a very good and inexpensive shotgun.<br>  <br>  20 gauge is good for recreational shooting, hunting, and home defense.  It isn't as common as a 12 gauge, but it is more than enough powerful for home defense.|`|3b8557f01cef58611c2e78e57d57b1e5aa	Yes, use number 4 bird shot for inside home self-defense ammo.*Ammo is between 3 & 4 dollars.* Buy a good used shotgun and save lots of $$$$.* A new shotgun doesn't shoot any better than a good used one.*~~|`|Ui2WJH4Iaa	that might be the best home defense gun there is.  ammo is cheap.

Dermie had been doing this for ages and it was karma that someone did it to him (watch the video of this game to see).<br>  <br>  One of the tougher players going round now is Gary Ablett Junior. His old man was a tough customer too, as the Dipper would attest. A case of toughness in the family. Ablett Senior was the youngest of the three Abletts that were playing in the 80s (Geoff and Kevin were the other two) and so playing in the backyard against 2 older brothers would have toughened him up. An example of his toughness was in a match against Carlton when he and Wayne Johnston (nickname the Dominator, who was considered to be one of the toughest at the time) collided head-on at full pelt on the wing of Princes Park. The impact shook the grandstand! Ablett ended up on his back, Johnston just stood there. Ablett jumped to his feet and charged back into the contest. Johnston just stood there. Ablett took the ball and delivered a pass to a player downfield. Johnston just stood there. He was unconscious! Slowly he toppled over like a tall tree.<br>  <br>  In the past, in the golden era, when players were men, there was only one reserve player (a 19th man). Players would stay on with broken bones and blood coming from all orifices (no blood rule!). Coming off the ground would be tantamount to wearing a white feather and a yellow streak down the back. <br>  <br>  Two players who were tough (Jack Dyer mainly in the 30s and Ted Whitten in the 50s) played in different eras, but by a quirk of fate, Dyer's last game was Whitten's first against Richmond. Dyer, who was a gentleman off the field, extended his hand to Whitten before the bounce and said, "G'day son, good luck today." Seconds after the siren sounded and the ball was bounced, Dyer flattened Whitten with a perfect legitimate hip-and-shoulder! Many seasons later, history repeated ... Whitten did the same to another player in his first game!<br>  <br>  Leigh Matthews was tough, but also was a thug ... the first player to be charged with assault for king-hitting a player from behind during a game. But to crash into a behind post and snapping it off the base? Matthews wasn't born, he was carved out of rock!<br>  <br>  One particular player who was tough and had his career cut short (tragically killed in a car accident in the off season) was Darren Millane of Collingwood. He thought a back step was something outside the back door of a building!<br>  <br>  Some of the toughest players in the game were not big units like Jonathon Brown or Lance Franklin but the little blokes like Tony Liberatore. A good foot shorter and 20 kilos lighter than the bloke they've just tackled to the ground!!|`|HKwntKIlaa	Luke Hodge.<br>  <br>  Awesome player.|`|ExH0kBXFaa	glenn archer toughest player ever hopefully daniel pratt can fill the void|`|AUmdOhBbaa	luke hodge and barry hall because of there courage|`|wnZ0N3wjaa	Luke Hodge currently.|`|2s244jGgaa	Currently its easily Luke Hodge, being tough means that you cant be afraid to put your body on the line and that your rough at every contest. Strong and tough players deserve this title and luke hodge fits the description perfectly. He always fists the ball away from his opponent (when playing in the backline) and does a damn good job of it, hes hard on and will play on with injury. VERY deservant of the 2008 norm smith medal. Tough bloke!<br>  <br>  Past, id say Glen Archer or Johnny worsfold. Woosha could get away with the hardest hits and would always go hard at it. He would always know how to make a player feel pain and at the same time, he would do it in the best technique to not get himself in trouble. It was always well done but caused pain..Archer was probably one of the most toughest men our game has ever seen. Courage and strength are what he had on every occasion that he ran out onto the field.|`|lrqZHi9Jaa	Some of those old players were really tough, different times though where they could be.  My dad used to tell me about Jack Dyer and the reason he was called captain blood was because he would always leave the ground covered in someone else's blood.  He was so tough he used to run right into opposition players and if they got hurt, bad luck.  Kevin Sheedy was another who was tough in his day...well good at staging for free kicks but he could give it as well as take it and Leigh Matthews was another...who else could run into a goal post and snap it in two...(windy hill I think)<br>  <br>  Glenn Archer was probably one of the toughest players in a physical sense of recent times and, strangely enough I will say James Hird.  Who could have gone through the face injury he did and even come back to playing let alone all the other injuries he sustained - thats courage and mental toughness just to walk out onto a ground the first time afterwards.<br>  <br>  I know others have had injuries that have been awful but that face one...one of the worst I can remember ever.|`|nfZzdWGLaa	Cam Mooney, Barry Hall, Jonathon Brown now, in the past ablett snr, tony lockett, jack dyer, garry hocking|`|7Ek9YkUhaa	Beau Waters!|`|8840f90d1236990da5c34043fc11245faa	Dermott Brereton was tough in his day especially in the 1989 GF.

Didn't shoot at a target over about 20 feet. Most shooting was at 7-14 ft. <br>  <br>  I don't remember anyone flunking.<br>  <br>  It is just as important to them that you handle your weapon safely as it is to be a Dead Eye D1ck. You should be able to safely load, unload, and holster your pistol on command. It isn't a timed event either. They don't want to see you do it fast, just properly and safely. The will tell you what they want you to do and when to do it. Don't do anything they don't tell you to. They will tell you when to load, holster, draw, fire, unload, holster, etc. Again, speed is not what they are looking for.<br>  <br>  Did I mention they want to see how safe you are?<br>  <br>  Relax, practice with your pistol, pay attention in class. You will do fine.|`|AA11295048	Shooting test vary depending on state and instructors, self defense range has been legally set at 7 yards (21 feet) practice at this range and demonstrate that you can safely handle the weapon and not violate the safety rules. Your instructor must be confident that you will not kill yourself or any one else by accident.|`|WsFH6rUiaa	Like everone has said it depends on the state. <br>  In az we have it 1day class and the range I belive is 3 shots at 5 yards and 3 shots at 10.

So check with a local gun shop they should be able to tell you and possible offer the class.<br>  <br>  And for bigbad..

It's very easy.  As long as you hit the target (and you will) at the 3 and 7 yds you can completely miss it all 10 shots at the 15 yds.  It's simply a "pass" or "fail".  You don't actually get a score.|`|CyiQwe8vaa	Here in WV the range is 7 yards (21 feet).<br>  <br>  As for shooting, the instructor is more interested in how you handle the firearm than how many you get in a bulls eye.  <br>  <br>  Follow your instructors instructions and you should do fine.  The instructors will teach you the proper way to hold your firearm and how to load and unload the firearm.<br>  <br>  If SC is anything like WV you shouldn't have a problem.  The class is very informative and answers a lot of questions before you get to the range.<br>  <br>  Good luck.|`|4KvLIa6Saa	10' is the target as over that than you can't fire as there no threat> And all you have to do is hit the target 10' away not miss it> There's no points or rings or anything> Just want to see if you can keep it pointing forward and shoot straight>|`|OYy1OmDPaa	The shooting portion of my state's test is a joke.

zFTSg47waa	Drills. You can't just play, but you have to practice targeted drills to work on your weaknesses. The first thing you should figure out is stroke mechanics. Pretty much every pool instructional book goes over this. Second, make sure you can hit the ball straight. Aim the cue ball straight down the table and see if it rebounds straight back towards you, not off to the side. Then you can work on aiming and game strategies. Phil Capelle's books are good, and so are Robert Byrne's.|`|d7570355e6c141f9b4bc359d2fb03aa1aa	Practice as much as possible. Also play other people that's good and learn from them.<br>  <br>  Pool is easy, it's a game of angles. Same angle one ball strikes another ball or rail it leaves at the same angle.|`|sRvHkvJ2aa	Sorry, buddy. There's no shortcut in pool. The only way to get good is to play until you get there. It's best to learn some fundamental techniques from a pro (stance, bridging, aiming etc) so you get good habits, but getting a sweet stroke is still a matter of personal dedication.|`|X7OlyuEJaa	Hi, Play with the best players in your area that will play you, if it costs you a few bucks, chalk it up to the lessons.

B2eGb9ZEaa	That is not a loss. That is just a scratch. If you sunk the cue ball when you shot the 8 ball, that is a loss. It looks like the kid pulled one over on you.|`|H41u0B8Jaa	Assuming you are playing 8 ball If it wasn't on the 8 ball then he gets a ball in hand (place it anywhere on the table; the only time it is placed behind the head string is if you scratch the cue ball off the break) because you fouled...you only lose the game if you scratch the cue ball on the 8 ball.|`|mJOTOGuwaa	YESSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSS|`|gSwobfujaa	when u scratch on the 8 ball u lose the game unfortunately. lol. if u get the 8 ball in by accident during the game you lose and lastly if u do not call the pocket that the 8 ball is going into you also lose...even if it gets in another one.<br>  <br>  well u called it the white ball. so to me when u say last ball i thought u meant the 8 ball. so i no u simply reposted ur question but ur incorrect wording was still the same. for future..<br>  <br>  white ball = q ball<br>  black ball = 8 ball<br>  and in this situation last ball = 4 ball<br>  <br>  with this all said. no u didnt lose then. when u scratch he gets the q ball and can place it wherever he likes behind the breaking line.|`|zFTSg47waa	No, you don't lose. It's just a scratch and your son can put the ball anywhere on the table.|`|xZI6noJiaa	Yup. You lost.|`|1gPxH90Saa	Since this was only a "friendly" game of pool, usually meaning bar rules ignore the posts about ball in hand. That only applies to league rules or bca rules. <br>  <br>  If your "last ball" had been the 8 ball then yes you would have lost but since in this case it was only one of your object balls (the 4) the game continues as if you had scratched on any of your other shots, doesn't matter if it's the 1st ball you pocket or the last (other than the 8).|`|GuKofUzSaa	If you were playing regular 12 ball pool (not 8 ball), then yes you did lose. When you are going to hit the last ball in, the 8 ball, you CANNOT hit the white ball (the cute ball) in any pocket. If you scratch on this shot, you lose. You also must call which pocket you plan to hit it in. If you make it into a different pocket than the one you called, you also lose.|`|e1Ecc6pxaa	No you did not lose the game. If you scratch on a shot when you're still potting your balls it is not an automatic loss.<br>  <br>  However if you scratch when on the 8 ball and sink the 8 ball you lose.|`|zg1lIy7Oaa	Yupz. Sorry mom, you lose....|`|xwZV9jgPaa	yes that means you lost

FFE9Qztzaa	I see Heinze DOES have sense ;)|`|wrhqkEiMaa	Whoever thinks Liverpoop was dominant was probably watching the wrong game, or somehow confused Real Madrid for Liverpoop|`|ie5AKYToaa	Well the only reason why I kind of like Madrid is b/c Zidane played for them at one point. But really, I don't like Liverpool since they never seem to play as a team and their play is really boring.|`|gaOSUthbaa	The game should have ended 0-0 or with Real winning. The header is a classic example of "Right place at the Right time"
IJvwYe1yaa	Shash  you've got to be kidding me? Milan fan?   Hahahaha Woooh! <br>  But I agree.  It was a mistake.  I wish he hadn't signed. <br>  That C*** should have gone to Man. City. <br>  <br>  <br>  It's the coaching Marco.  He was **** when we won the CL in 2007 too.  Just the players had great performance.<br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  And Marco.  Milan are a laugh right now.   Idk what Imilya is talking about but you have a good day tomorrow.  :D|`|WS8MvKQAaa	Hug|`|3yqCKPzVaa	Marco... I'm speechless... I just am....<br>  <br>  No offense... but Dinho has made the Stupidest decision of his life when he decided to join Milan... =[<br>  <br>  <br>  Marco and Freshy... guys ... please.... I am too an AC Milan fan.. they're my fav in Italy... and I loved it when they won even when Dinho was in Barcelona... but seriously if Barca were that bad.. I'd criticize them.... and say that they totally suck,,,, whether or not Dinho played there.... AC Milan's defence is a joke... Their attack and midfield are awesome... Pirlo's amazing.. Beckham.. wow... Gattuso.. solid wonder rock... etc.. Pato, kaka... and Dinho comes way last cuz he's still not @ his best.... I love AC Milan .. I support them not cuz of Dinho... when they won the UCL two years back... I was the happiest guy in my neighborhood screaming YAAAAAAAAY at the top of my lungs!!! ... but now,,, they don't deserve to win anything... and i repeat... I don't support them cuz of Dinho... and in fact... Messi is my fav player now not Dinho.... AC Milan sux now and this is the sad truth... but we have to accept it and move on... Case closed...|`|wrhqkEiMaa	Dude R10 you're not a real Milan fan are you?<br>  <br>  Come on Marco, its just the UEFA Cup, remember? ;)<br>  You guys never gave that much importance to it in the first place.|`|VDh1fcGIaa	Dont know how you gave up a 2-0 lead at home, didnt watch the game so cant really say much about it.

Even if they've been bad in recent years, the history is still there.<br>  <br>  1. Raiders<br>  2. Chargers <br>  3. Rams<br>  <br>  Note: USC Football is probably second most hated, by its rivals. But thats college.|`|9M8lEQDqaa	Southern California? Aren't those mainly Charger fans?<br>  <br>  I guess it would be<br>  1. Raiders<br>  2. Broncos<br>  3.

92df82e95b3b1086d69d36994ca2effdaa	As mentioned there are some things that are fine to buy online.  It will mostly be the small parts.  And yes they are in many cases less expensive.  However, a knife is not a knife, and BC is not a BC.  And in the early stages of your diving, you are going to be looking for information on what a good "X" is.  Also for anything with sizes, you will want to try it on.  In order to do this you have to visit your LDS (local dive shop)  When you walk in there, you are normally going to ask questions.  The extra cost the dive shop charges is to pay that guy the 10 bucks an hour to be there to answer your questions.  If you really get into diving you will build a relationship with your LDS (or a few) as you are in there all the time to get air/gas fills to pick up pieces and parts etc.  So when you utilize their knowledge and then go save a few dollars by buying it online it hurts their business.  And when you have a question about it or it needs service or repair they are less willing to help.  So it's good to have a good relationship with the shop.   Also when it comes to annual service you can run into issues.  Each year things like BCs and Regulators need to be serviced.  (the o rings get hard, things loosen up, get a little corrosion etc)  If you buy a brand that a local store doesn't carry, it may be tough to get it serviced or fixed.  lastly there are some on-line places that sell gray market items.  You just have to watch out and know where you are ordering from.<br>  <br>  That being said, their are some great online stores.  They are usually associated with brick and mortar dive shops.  There is someone that can help you if you have questions, but you generally need to know what you are after.  So what should you get at a shop.  Your first full setup.  Fins / mask / weigh / booties.   BC / reg / gauge or computer  Then when it gets to the little stuff, online may make sense.|`|95bb76d0439c02bb72678f77c90632acaa	The manual is normally included in your course costs. It's going to be there for you on the first night of class. Nothing to buy.<br>   I'm hesitant of reccomending any online shop for dive gear that's life support.Your BC and regs should be bought in the dive shop. You'll probably find that shop will then extend discounts to other gear you purchase there at the same time. They want a repeat customer. Online sales for things like knives, snorkels or lights aren't a big issue as a rule, just remember that getting these items serviced may be a headache if your local shop doesn't carry them. A lot of dive centres will put their own customer's that bought gear in their shop, ahead of anyone that didn't when it comes to service. That's natural to expect. Shop around. Take prices you find online, to your local shops that deal that particular brand. Chances are pretty good that they'll either come very close to matching it or even beating that online price so that you'll come back for other dive needs. Good business strategy. You'll also be able to get that gear serviced quickly and cheaply instead of sending it off via courier if that gear is something not normally found in your area. You should be talking to the shop you're doing your course with. You're already a customer and they'll put together a package that suits you...not someone over the internet.<br>  <br>  Edit: 300 bucks is par for the course, pardon the pun. It usually goes for anywhere between 250 - 350 depending on the area you're in. Are you doing this via the E learning option in PADI? If so, sorry, but I'm not a fan of that. A live Instructor trumps an online course any day of the week.

IJvwYe1yaa	Whatever.|`|cOPCNP7Laa	I do. Idc what anyone else thinks either way and even if I thought otherwise they aren't going to win anything so it would be pointless.|`|cQoNzj5Gaa	I agree, and I don't understand, ronaldinho was such a good player at barcelona now he sucks.
Wv0UKUdiaa	They're out ... LOOOOL|`|cOPCNP7Laa	I predicted on an e-mail to another user, when we were 2-0 up, that we-d draw and go out. So effing predictable.
Epmny08zaa	He Said <br>  <br>  "If You Dont Win Then All Yall Will Get Raped By Me" <br>  <br>  YYY Todos De Chivas Were Playing All Good Now...U Saw Vergara Staring At All The Chivas Players! <br>  <br>  Hes Like "IM WATCHIINNNGGG UUUUU"|`|Cpm25Pekaa	"If we lose, I'll be stuck being the president of Chivas. If we win, I'll be out of Chivas and I swear on the holy bible." - Vergaman<br>  (But luckily for Vergaman, he crossed his fingers)|`|2P6VDNwSaa	He probably paid the other team to lose on purpose. Just look at how easily they scored 2 goals in 3 minutes. Nah jk chivo fans.|`|athSKc9uaa	I gave 'em cash for some Curanto, so don't worry, they'll make it easy for us.|`|6eEmDMMSaa	he said that if they dont win they will all be selling omnilife, si chicharito should be the starting forward against pashuka, oshoa its a great benchwarmer , hes been doing good at that position in all the teams hes been playing with.............24roch....................|`|KUDM3Q4Uaa	If we lose you all gonna die?<br>  or if we lose u gonna suck my penis|`|7Xridrxaaa	agreed|`|VjMpfA2Yaa	Nomas los fue a respaldar, even if they had a crappy start, he had faith in the team. It was all over the websites....I think thats all he said, even if he wouldnt of shown up, yesterdays team was really weak and Chivas would of won either way....<br>  <br>  <br>  About Chicharito, a starter? maybe just not yet...he had a good game yesterday and everytime he has came in as a sub he has shown much improvement. I think he should keep coming in as a sub for now, and maybe like in 2-3 games maybe start...we gotta wait and see how Arellano is going to affect the fowards when he comes back

How LeBron defends all five positions.|`|AA10263761	Lebron James makes players better then they actually are.<br>  Kobe can do it.<br>  But not to the extent that lebron does and on a day in and day out basis he doesnt like lebron.<br>  Lebron could score way more.<br>  Like for example the Back to Back games at the garden.<br>  When the Knicks Doubled Kobe he would just shoot over it granted he has the best Offensive jumpshot.<br>  When the Knicks Doubled Lebron He would penetrate and find other teams the reason why his all around stats were better then Mr Bryants.<br>  <br>  On any given Day Kobe can Exploud for more points but over the duration of a season he cant score like lebron because kobe takes lower percentage shots.|`|Pvbb90guaa	you wouldn't be able to tell that yet sense LeBron hasn't hit his prime yet but sense LeBron is so young and is doing so good a lot of people would say that..

mber3JoAaa	I do think the India series is more exciting than the Windies series, because the Indian team consists mainly of household names, whereas the West Indies team only had five or six. So the Indian team has many very good players, who will be worth the price of admission to watch even if NZ go down in a screaming heap. The other exciting factor about the Indian series is that it is 6 years since they were last here, whereas prior to the recent series, WI were last here only three years ago.|`|yovEpdIZaa	It should be a great tour, just hoping that it doesnt rain during the test matches as it would be great to see the fantastic four of Gambhir, Sewhag, Dravid, Tendulkar batting for the last time possibly in NZ.<br>  <br>  But no disrespect to the Black Caps.<br>  <br>  Go the CAPS!!!!|`|SbbpfaG7aa	Yup, more challenging, WI relies on Gayle all the time, if you take him out from the picture the whole team struggles, India can bat all the way down, more exciting and more thrilling.|`|eHcXI4jFaa	Definately more exciting.  to be fair It is exciting to watch Gayle/Sarwan/Chanderpaul.  but that is about the only quality WI have.  India definately a more exciting prospect.  especially since we play them very rarely.|`|aN4SUKkRaa	KiwiJoey said:<br>  India has more household names than the Windies.<br>  <br>  The Kiwis too have a household name, Neville Broom, can't be more household than that! When he was in Australia for the Chappell-Hadlee series I was hanging out waiting for him to play! <br>  Imagine the puns:<br>  "Broom sweeps between the fieldsmen", <br>  "Broom reverse sweeps through the covers". <br>  "Broom sweeps over the fence" <br>  "Broom sweeps all the way for 4"<br>  "Ponting sweeps, caught by Broom"<br>  "Broom attempts to sweep, the ball brushes his glove!"<br>  <br>  Pity the South Africans didn't play New Zealand, we could have had:<br>  "There's a collision in mid-pitch during that risky run. Steyn is cleaned up by Broom!!"|`|4cd30bf7558366b3b6c31ee6e5edf5d1aa	Yeah it is going to be a great tour.  We've spent the last few months trialing the team and Poor Andy Moles was thrown into the deep end in the Windies tour, made coach just a few days before the tour was started. He, the players and the team look far more settled and able to give a better showing of themselves in this tour.<br>  <br>  The windies were Chanderpaul, Gayle and Sarwan, India is looking a far better all round team and not relying on a few stars so it should be a good matchup.|`|561a42dcf730fd97fc3a2ebd788ea961aa	Yeah it is going to be a great tour.  to beat India and come to No 04 spot...<br>   New Zea land  is a quite a good team... you know~
CtJLXDJjaa	well from experience.....<br>  last time i played football, i ended up getting a conccusion.... and no i was not wearing the "armour" lol<br>  <br>  but then again, like you know, i always manage to get hurt alot lol!|`|AA12170560	Sadly, we keep less than 1% of the rugby players (every season) that wish to stay in shape for rugby. <br>  <br>  The answer is always the same: the collisions are too frequent and too intense. ...even with "all that armour"...<br>  <br>  Euro tryouts are in March - there's no age limit.<br>  Come on out and lets see how long you last.|`|rzZXJz0qaa	yea they need just a lil protection .. imagine a 6'7 275 lb guy running at you full speed kinda hurts hun.. NO MORE drinkin,, geesh lol well maybe one more if you give me a back rub *winks*|`|ZEP1K3oSaa	I agree and think everyday if those guys had to play like in rugby maybe they wouldn't feel so tough! Best of luck to us all!!!<br>  <br>  GAH|`|Hkb7xoaQaa	3 Reasons: 1)The players know that if they get injured they don't get paid, so they do their best to stay safe, and their commitees make sure their safe. 2) The people in the NFL weigh from 200lbs to 400 lbs, im not sure how much that is in kilograms but i assure you it is a lot, and i guarantee you they weigh twice as much as rugby players. 3) Lastly, football players spend a lot of time in the weight room, they are some of the stongest athletes in the world and i dont think the same can be said for rugby. As mean and aggressive as rugby players are, i doubt they could take a hit from a football player....|`|PCsW0gbPaa	Lol. <br>  There's a great Jackass episode where Johnny Knoxville plays without pads against a college team in pads.  It's pretty crazy.<br>  <br>  But seriously, though, I know that there are some huge hits that rugby and Austrailian rules players take so I won't say that Americans hit harder, but in American football those hits happen much, much more frequently.  If the players didn't wear all of those pads, no one would last the whole game.|`|666KRBlnaa	Rugby league also has huge hits and players are more than likely to get a concussion. Those NFL armor and helmet does protect and distribute the blow far better than a body to body or a bone to bone hits.<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xkrY3d1kvoE" rel="nofollow">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xkrY3d1kv...</a><br>  <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U-2o_jCwrjk" rel="nofollow">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U-2o_jCwr...</a>|`|iRFsu2kVaa	Okay. Go find the nearest 300 lb (136kg) man and have him run directly at you. When he hits you put your shoulder into him. Tell me how you feel.<br>  <br>  Then try it with pads.|`|ksst4K9Yaa	Ummm first of all its no called armor its called pads and second i want to see u get hit from brian dawkins and not have any broken ribs|`|j7i0zPpWaa	Protection? Maybe from be paralized or something worse. Running at full speed at 300 pounds can do some damage.|`|c4b596d15eac948f611f72b6a99f85a0aa	"it's not like ya need it"<br>  <br>  I guarantee you've never played. And no opinion is warranted unless you have.|`|zjpB2GARaa	Injuries are rampant in football.  Most of the players are injured all the time and play through the injuries.  However, many cannot (for example, some NFL teams had over 20 players placed on IR last season).<br>  <br>  The players wear shoulder pads to try to reduce the number of injuries in a very dangerous sport.

If Barca think people are going to go to the best side in Europe at the moment (ok, one of the best) and open up allowing them to attack freely and play attractive football they are mad, or deluded. Barca have to break team down, even if they defend heavly - Man Utd do it week in week out because they are a top quality side (and im a LFC fan) if Barca cant then they are over rated.<br>  <br>  On the act of scoring, the players providing ammunition are of such a high quality a peice of wood should be able to score at least 10 a season.|`|dT3xJ9GWaa	no|`|WS8MvKQAaa	true|`|WdOAxQmoaa	wasnt R10 a barca fan last season??<br>  <br>  anyway...Arsenal are the same, two 0-0 draws in a row at home becouse teams put 11 men behined the ball. they dont even do it at man utd or liverpool.<br>  <br>  least barca has quality to run through the defence in messi who do Arsenal have...EBOUE!! :\|`|3yqCKPzVaa	tbh i can't say anything..<br>  <br>  I'm still shocked after AC Milan's elimination from UEFA Cup...<br>  <br>  I understand Dinho and Kaka weren't playing but Come on...<br>  <br>  We were 2-0 ahead at the interval!!!!!!!!!!!!!...<br>  <br>  This is a joke!|`|sm2RK9Nxaa	Its EXACTLY the same for Manchester United......<br>  <br>  Is this something we FINALLY agree on???LOL|`|jLRpCt03aa	Yeah but I think the key is not to fall into the trap by rushing an early goal cos other teams kind of figured out our play esp our passing game fails when we start getting frustrated. Like in recent games we sort of push forward in the 1st 20 mins then when we couldnt get thru we started playing bad etc. And Pep has to do something abt Xavi being triple marked now, maybe Hleb should play more center when that happpens cos i dont see Keita being helpful there he cant dribble.I miss Iniesta damnn..|`|tEwZWXstaa	dk i just like real madrid and thats it...........i guess it would be hard.....the easiest way to score for barca is playing FIFA 09|`|2v5VMZugaa	well if you do play for Barcelona it don't mean that there not that good and can't score.|`|9kfmdYXyaa	same thing happening when teams visit anfield and emirates

What a freakin' miracle!!|`|IWM1khX7aa	Gio scored?<br>  Finally!<br>  That is the kind of talent that we should see from him every game.<br>  <br>  I couldn't find it anywhere.|`|ZWyKCsqBaa	wen can u giv us a link eazy?<br>  Edit - I just saw the goal on mightyfootball.com , it was badazz he juked out a defender, then curled it with his left foot to the top left post.|`|oCNFZhdraa	I saw it and dayummm it was a nice ******* goal,glad to see him back|`|2P6VDNwSaa	Yea. It was pretty good.|`|3OrAk94iaa	that goal was pretty sick the way he juked alot was tight|`|5x4MlPlHaa	i ahve a feeling mexico's players are gonna make a HUGE comeback|`|SvNcWfdJaa	cool<br>  so who did his team win?|`|pSOmwwlIaa	Great. I just got back from school and I'm watching the game on FSC and it all just got ruined. Anyways from apart that, I see Gio regaining his level, the one that he lost from the SUB-17 World Cup. Finally he's getting rid of his ego and starting to gain confidence. Like 5-6 months ago he was always scared to get tackled down, but now he's not. But we all gotta wait 8-10 games from now and see how he does.|`|nKNiKPn3aa	hell yeah le pego bien bonito lol it was great though and its makes it better because of how he hit the ball with his left foot.|`|KUDM3Q4Uaa	Im watching it to but i just started watching it so i didnt see the goal<br>  <br>  EDIT: dam thats gol was badass|`|6eEmDMMSaa	mmmm at least gio scored
H5Jrd0siaa	Its not so much the drug he has taken that everyones disapointed with but the fact he is [potentally] world class, regular england player, just signed for Bath and he risked the lot and all for what.<br>  I think the ban is more a message to others rather than to him,including the up and coming.<br>  I dont know the events building up to him coming out,usually its because some one is about to blow the whisle. Surely he knew he would get caught at some point as all pro players are tested although i dont know how often. <br>  the ban is also in line with other sports.<br>  I think he is a great player and admitting it or not. 2 years seems right.|`|HTiczN3Xaa	Not too much.  As Bill P has said, Sailor got hit with the same ban for the same offence.|`|ec7s9I0iaa	no he knew he was doing wrong was stupid thing to do for anyone let alone a world class sports man given the honor of playing for his country.|`|5vw7S7ZJaa	No not too much....<br>  <br>  Professional Rugby players get paid A LOT OF MONEY. <br>  <br>  This money is for thier performance and the way they promote and represent the club and thier country.<br>  <br>  If they cant keep away from drugs and stay out of trouble for thier playing career, which mind you isnt very long, say 5 to 6 years at top level, then bugger them.<br>  <br>  If someone offered me a LOT of money to play rugby and all i had to do was perform (obviously) and stay out of trouble then i would.... I would be at home in bed early every night and stay outta trouble.<br>  <br>  When my career was over, then i would go out and do all the stupid things i couldnt when getting paid mage dollars for playing rugby....<br>  <br>  Now he has to pay the price for his ill judgement... and this should serve as a warning to other players.<br>  <br>  Same thing happened to wendal sailor who was getting paid half a million a year to play and was booted from the waratahs for coke.<br>  <br>  Idiots...|`|tTfY7Esfaa	His punishment suits the crime. I want to believe that the ban is too harsh, on the grounds that the drugs are not perf enhancing, but when waying up the negatives this has on rugby i believe it's fair.<br>  The main point here is that it is illegal, the man broke the law. I know this type of crime is commonly perpertrated, but rugby cannot be seen in any way to condone such behaviour.<br>  Obviously i don't want my son to grow up idolising a known waster either.<br>  He seems like a nice bloke that messed up. He will recover. Look at Lawrence Dallagio and Wendell Sailor, they manned up(well Lawrence did sorta). And we don't want the sort of stink that the A Rod affair uncovered in American Baseball to taint our beautiful game.|`|AA11586164	It is a dangerous drug ,,socially  & physically & It's not only weak idiots using it.. HE DESERVES ALL HE GETS FOR BEING A DRUG ABUSER.. This is no recreational thing .It is a major threat to society ..let this b a warning to others as I [& many others] think a life-time ban is more suitable as a deterent  ..Kev|`|f9hiPMDxaa	I have to say no, particularly as Wendell Sailor got two years for the same thing.|`|ETarSy9Maa	Well, it's not even a performance enhancing drug, so it's kind of stupid to give him a suspension for that long, not to mention all of the facts stated above aswell.
dOpKsNYcaa	I think we should wait to see what happens next year and reserve judgment until then. Dubai made a terrible mistake by not allowing Shahar Peer a visa into the country and hopefully the fine the WTA imposed on them and the withdrawal of prominent players have made them see the error of their ways. Dubai is a great tourist city and fans of tennis in that country should not be penalized for their government making a political statement under the guise of security. If all players are treated fairly and equally next year, I think it's safe to assume that they've learned their lesson. However, if they do anything like this again, then they should no longer be a part of the WTA or ATP tennis calander.|`|yAA5NpiDaa	i think that Dubai should host the tennis open every year. Dubai hasn't done anything wrong it has all the right to do that .|`|VtjZ4DBcaa	Yes, this was not the first time a visa had been refused to an Israeli player. It is absolutely disgraceful that this Anti-Semitic behavior has a place in tennis today. I had hoped that other players would have the courage to boycott the tournament, but apparently the players have as much backbone as the WTA. The organizers, the players, and the WTA should all be ashamed that they allowed the tournament to be completed.<br>  <br>  britsknowsportstoo.blogspot.com

AA10702710	I've hiked pretty much all of the AT through NoVA, WV and MD and some parts of PA.  Here's the deal.<br>  <br>  1)  Be sure to get a map!  The Potomac Appalachian Trail Club sells them and I think that some REI outfitter stores have them too.  I dunno, maybe you can download them these days...not sure.<br>  <br>  2)  Make sure you have comfortable hiking boots.  Wool socks are a must.  (Cotton socks are the worst.)  I used to hike for 45 minutes, then take a break for 15 minutes.  Taking my boots and socks off and allowing my feet to stay dry.<br>  <br>  3)  Make sure you are aware of the weather forecast for the days you will be hiking.  Summer is best.  But, if you hike in the summer, be sure to have use a good insect repellent with plenty of Deet in it (ticks carry lyme disease).<br>  <br>  4)  I won't belabour the point of packing light.  You should know this aready.  Sleeping bag and tent should all be the newer hiker/biker styles that use SYNTHETIC fibers for insulation (goose and duck down is worthless when it gets wet).<br>  <br>  5)  Plenty of access points to get on the AT.  There's one on Rt. 50, on the other side of Middleburg.  Alson one on Rt. 7 on top of Weather Mountain (Snickers Gap).  Another one on Rt. 9, in West Virginia, as soon as you cross the state line...as you are headed toward Harpers Ferry.<br>  <br>  6)  I never had any issues, but if you park your car overnight, I highly recommend that you lock it up tight and possibly use a "club" to lock the steering wheel.  As I said, I never had a problem, but it's pretty obvious that when a car is parked at a entry point along the AT at night, there is a 99% chance that the owner is not coming back until mid-morning...so possible car thiefs know this.<br>  <br>  7)  DO NOT camp near the campsites.  Most people that use the AT are nice folks.  But, there are bound to be some local-yokals that are trouble makers.  Most AT campsites are within easy access of the roadways.  This makes it easy for AT volunteers to work at the sites and do maintenance.  It also makes it easy for teenagers to go there and drink beer and cause trouble.<br>  <br>  For camping purposes, find a nice remote, level spot at least 75 yards form the trail, where you are not visible from the trail.  Also, check for DEAD TREES that are still standing.  If you get a wind storm during the night, one of those huge trees may come toppling down on top of your tent and crush you.  Some might say this is absurd, but I used to work in a cemetery as a teen and we buried a few people that went hiking and camping and did not pay attention to the dead trees and tree limbs - which ended their lives rather early.<br>  <br>  8)  If you are going to be gone for 4 days, then I highly recommend that you do have a friend pick you up somewhere.  I used to do the 2 and 3 day hikes; hiking in half way, camping, then turning around and hiking back out.  But, you can obviously cover more ground when you go in one direction.  (Plus your vehicle would be safer.)<br>  <br>  I would highly recommend a hike that starts at Rt. 7 (Weather Mountain / Snickers Gap) and proceeds north through Harpers Ferry and ends in Maryland at Washington Monument State Park.  That would be an RATHER EASY 4 day hike with plenty of great views along the way.  I say "rather easy" because if you study an AT map, there are a number of places nicknamed "Devil's Race Course".  When you hike it, you'll know why!<br>  <br>  9)  Some more common sense stuff here.  But, be sure to take along the usual essentials.  Pocket knives, Swiss Army knives (with tweezers to pull thorns of out skin) and some snack foods as well as your usual meals.  I used to always use the US Military MRE meals when I went.  Also...TWO CANTEENS per person.  AND some WATER PURIFICATION TABLETS.  You can refill your canteens at the streams, but you'll need the water tablets to go with it.  WATER IS AN ESSENTIAL ELEMENT OF LIFE!  And you can find this out the hard way if you are 5 miles into the forest and you run out of water.<br>  <br>  10)  Lastly.  Carry some pepper spray or mace or...um...an unloaded firearm for protection...just in case.  Some tree huggers will scoff at all of the safety precautions I recommend in guarding yourself from the two-legged animals, but I once hiked the AT in NoVA one weekend only to go home and learn that there had been a double homicide on the AT in the vicinity of Harpers Ferry that same weekend; a man and a woman were murdered in their tent.  The police caught the "drifter" that commited the crimes as he was hiking through Harpers Ferry: they saw him wearing the man's boots and carrying the woman's backpack (items that were identified as missing from the crime scene).<br>  <br>  Have fun!|`|Lngb8ryFaa	the most spectacular stretch is in new england, specifically when traversing the presidential range in new hampshire..i always meet thru hikers while i'm on daytrips in the Whites who say the same thing...from northern virginia you're not too terribly far from NH if this is a trip you'ld be interest in..also, the White Mountain Nationa Forest Servie offers shuttles during peak seasons so you can hike thru without having to backtrack|`|qyATAaeXaa	You've got a great stretch of AT right in your backyard, friend. The Shenandoah National Park section is great for short trips. You don't have to go two days in and two days back either. You can leave one car at one trailhead and then both drive to another one. Park there and shuttle back to the start point after you are done....or get some sucker to drop you off and pick you up! It's been a while since I was on that section of trail, at least 8 years or so ago. I do remember it was really scenic and there were a number of parking areas where other people were also taking 3-4 day trips. We were there in mid-August. It was nice. Not too humid in the woods, but the ranger said the cooler temps were a fluke. <br>  <br>  Northern New England is also very good. Worth the drive from NoVA. The AT is good all through New Hampshire, it gets less scenic in southern Vermont. The good hiking in VT is all north of Killington on the Long Trail. That's where I spend most of my time when not hiking in PA. The AT is PA is not that great. If you can't go to New England, you're better off in the Shenandoah.
WfsOeqCWaa	that really stinks. make the cleaners come clean your house than pester them about it and try to get them to give in|`|xRPjgGs1aa	Ask them do you know where my baseball cards are|`|uh2bkRrFaa	My God, the "questions" have crossed way over into the absurd.<br>  <br>  Yes, we know the cleaning crew and have questioned them on the missing cards. They told us they do not have them. Hope this helps.|`|3QELIOU7aa	I have the binder and am holding it for ransom.
8MUj24s6aa	So those that voted for him...what do you say now.<br>  <br>   “A Liberal is a person who will give away everything they don’t own.” William F. Carling|`|JXMVNEQoaa	**** i dont have mine yet. GET AS MUCH AS YOU CAN!|`|U0Rvsabdaa	I don't think this one will sunset. I'm not quite ready, I still need to get out of CA so I can buy a Kalashnikov.|`|fUDlbOP0aa	no, my AK47 hasn't come in yet. I ordered it in Nov 2008, right after the election (had hope that McCain would still win), and its still not here yet. <br>  <br>  I don't mind the magazine restriction, in California the limit is already 10 rounds and has been so for the last 15 years. and how do you suppose will the government restrict magazines per gun? it'll be registering ammo, its next to impossible to enforce, there'll be major resistance to it, and the costs outpace any rewards. <br>  <br>  and now, we're in the middle of a recession greater than any before except the 1929 depression, people will think Obama didn't get his priorities straight. On top of that, the costs to enforce the ban would be so great that Obama will be impeached because he's not doing anything to stop the recession.|`|tuULGJS6aa	I wasn't ready for it when Slick Willie passed the first one, and I won't be ready when Slimy Snake Barack and accomplices pass another one. I do have some full capacity pistol magazines though. I miss Bush very much. I've had invitations to go to Italy and Japan, and I may decide to accept them to escape the Lunatic Left Democrat Dictator and his oppressive regime.|`|XaHdbNbRaa	that's a load of bullshit man,i dont own an assault weapon but i know what makes sence and what doesn't!,the magazine restriction is even more bull than the assault weapons,violence is created by taking away decent peoples rights.|`|hoZnJVXXaa	There are two versions of the text of the Second Amendment, each with slight capitalization and punctuation differences. The Second Amendment, as passed by the House and Senate, reads:[1]<br>  “ A well regulated Militia, being necessary to the security of a free State, the right of the people to keep and bear Arms, shall not be infringed. ”<br>  The original and copies distributed to the states, and then ratified by them, had different capitalization and punctuation:[2]<br>  “ A well regulated militia being necessary to the security of a free State, the right of the People to keep and bear arms shall not be infringed. ”<br>  <br>  <br>  WOW - sorta says it all there.|`|9bUxbTJAaa	Question for those who rember the last ban. Could you legally buy pistol grips by themselves and put them on your AR, and just hope you don't get caught doing it. OR where the manufactures forced to prevent you from having a hand grip on them. <br>  <br>  One last thing doe any have a picture of an ar or ak without the pistol grip from the original ban or where you allowed to have those if you did not have the bayonet lug?|`|0cLj35Fgaa	No, I'm not ready.  Everything is sold out and I simply can't afford to pay scalpers prices for firearms.  But I do have a few hi-cap mags for my ruger 10/22.  That's about as ready as I am now.|`|8A0JdS7Xaa	I am ready to support and defend the Constitution against all enemies, foreign and domestic. In fact I swore an oath to do it.|`|wMvNESfLaa	No. I need to "squirrel away" some more cash to buy an evil black rifle that is sure to be banned if President Obama gets his way. I figure I need another $900 or so.|`|9XTuDQSyaa	There shouldn't be an assault weapons ban and magazine ban to begin with.|`|HuDn5MMtaa	I ordered more primers and powder.  Don't know if the primers will show up.  Have you looked for primers lately?|`|f3f63c87e27f64c3e9f1679c165409b8aa	I've been curious as to why they call it an "assault rifle ban".  I mean, even when slick willie was running things you could still buy an assault rifle, right?  It just had limits on magazine capasity, folding stocks, and bayonet lugs.  But couldn't you still buy them?  I mean honestly I don't think any type of weapon should be illegal for a law abiding citizen to own, but there has never been a ban on miliary style weapons has there?  I won't go into detail as to why the ones that you can currently still buy are not "assault weapons" because I've seen lots of your answers on here before g/wolf and I know that you know the difference.  I'm just confused by some of the terminology that is used by the media.  When they say "assault weapons" do they mean the semi-auto kind that is currently legal, or do they mean banning the fully auto kind that only class 3 holders to currently have?<br>  <br>  To answer your question though I don't think any is too much.  If you decide that you don't won't/need as many as you do you can always sell it and make a profit.  Guns/ammo/magazines, etc...seem to be the only thing you can buy now-a-days that won't loose you money.  More than I can say for my 401K...lol<br>  I have a Rock River AR-15, a Bushmaster AR-15, a Colt Match Target AR chambered in 7.62 x 39, an AK-47, and 4 mags for each (I don't like calling them high capacity mags. because that gives that impression that we were allowed to own something scary and dangers by the current administration).  Serveral thousand rounds of ammo, and numberous handgun and other long guns too.|`|1IMY9t3Uaa	Well Glacier, I'm from Alabama.  Here in Alabama our firearms are important to us.  You should also know that our Senators know it - we let them know it.  Now I know some states are a bit more dependent on the the Government tit that most southerners but you should throw that yoke off.  Talk to your Senators, write them, let them know you wouldn't mind giving up some Pork in return for your rights.  Take steps to make sure your local economy isn't so artificially dependent on the the feds. You always slip into your answers that you are from Alaska.  Alaskans aren't quite as independent as they like to think maybe they should change their ways.|`|E8RyOYFWaa	He'll get impeached faster than he was elected president! Does everybody understand how a president gets impeached? Then learn!!
AA12034105	Haha I can't believe she did that lol<br>  It probably took her twice as long as it would have if she just went into the locker room cause she had to try to hide her modesty with the towel and everything haha :P|`|XtFsntdSaa	Well she doesn't seem to mind the attention, she doesn't really seem embarrassed. So I don't really think there's anything to worry about, <br>  <br>  maybe she should have gone to the locker room but being in a new environment may have made her lose concentration or maybe the locker room is disgusting and changing on the court is nicer. <br>  <br>  haha, the guy at the back is impressed, she actually did really well to cover up and change properly.|`|6KOEbjjJaa	LOL that is so wired and about that guy behinds her he looked so happy about that so she founds another way to make the crowd happy|`|cTcX7vumaa	ive seen this b4...shes not the brightest crayon in the box..but then again what do i kno...anyway..the sad thing is..this isnt the first time shes done this lol|`|VefSnu0Gaa	yes, i've seen this vid before, what was she thinking??<br>  she should've gone to the locker room.-<br>  and why did she change her shorts anyway?<br>  the guys behind her seem to enjoy it, ehhe, at one point one even claps.-<br>  :)|`|6S8KjBLQaa	Seen it, thought it was weird than, same opinion today..ew JJ is so discusting who would clap at THAT|`|AA10911150	Hey, we all need to change every now and again... even our underwear... in public. lol. I think she got a kick out of it, so it's all OK, Hopefully she'll start a trend on the WTA Tour. Let me know if Hantuchova or Kirilenko ever follow her example.
8jm84S32aa	NO, but it does erase the myth that everybody fears the Green.|`|FUoKu13Daa	Are you talking about worse loss ever or this season?<br>  <br>  Ever no this is not their worse loss ever and you have to take into fact that they were not playing without Garnett or Scalabine and just picked up a player in Moore that has not got a chance to learn their system, and it was a close game, not like they got blown out.<br>  <br>  and if you are talking about this year then that is debatable, during their skid they loss to New York but at least this game was close,<br>  <br>  You also have to look and think about what the coaches said,  " We got ready and played against a team with a poor record not with a team that has the personnel they have" Whichis true, <br>  <br>   The Clippers had a lot of injuries this year at the same time and it was mostly their big men except for Davis and they have almost all their player back except for Kaman and thornton was out too but anyway the Clippers has tons of talent and if they were together and maybe coached a little bit better they are probably a 4th or 5th playoff seed team in the west.<br>  <br>  So considering all that this is far from their worse loss ever.|`|AA10263761	See what happens when the celtics got Marbury They lose<br>  Marbury=Loser<br>  Celtics+Marbury=Losing Season|`|uwx7etCXaa	Anything can happen when you travel into Clipper Nation.  Top teams think they can go into anyone's house and beat the crap out of them, but it's not happening.  Boston needs to play hard, otherwise they will lose home field advantage when and if they reach the East Conference Finals.|`|PqmmyV6baa	Yeah any good team losing to a poor team can be embarrasing.|`|xRPjgGs1aa	Upsets happen|`|QJgcwXzxaa	it just happens.. like the Lakers lost to the Kings around two months ago.|`|25ymUKdraa	what can you expect? celtics has a depleted line up.|`|i5MInqeMaa	I doubt it.  Celtics have been in the league for many years and have lost many times to teams like the clippers and probably worse over the years.  Maybe most disspointing of this season, but not worse ever.|`|tzrLDbHWaa	No.  Its their worst loss this season, against a god awful team they should easily beat, but I doubt its the worst lost ever.  Upsets happen.|`|ZAh8CEoGaa	Upsets happen.|`|3teWTOPqaa	Of the season yes, they should have closed that game out.|`|7859db4349d703a0c747d4e81276b851aa	This season, yes. paulie pierce missed the last shot :D and rando fumbled lmao =P
dDhTMacAaa	False, sir.<br>  <br>  He remains unsigned by most sources say he is near a deal with the Boston Celtics.<br>  <br>  where did you hear the Raptors?|`|AA10263761	Not According to my sources|`|Pvbb90guaa	no but most likely he will be signed by boston..|`|iCRFNPg9aa	No but i dont think hes going to the celtics now that they have signed Mikki moore|`|c3tADklmaa	Where did you get this from?
TXUTwLLOaa	In my opinion USA vs Mexico wise, USA is better.<br>  <br>  USA vs everyone else and Mexico vs everyone else, Mexico is better.<br>  <br>  Just look at the previous 'Copa America'.... Mexico got third place. USA lost all three of their games. <br>  <br>  But then again, USA won all their first stage world quallifying matches while Mexico qualified oh so dramaticlly.<br>  <br>  Its complicated but as of now.... Of who is better than USA and Mexico..................... USA is better<br>  <br>  Just for the record I am Mexican... But I am being realistic|`|NV1hmsWLaa	well number 1 america are better than mexico<br>  and 2 maybe if the mexicans wernt such hackers they wouldn't get red cards|`|fEgK96Rhaa	don't believe usa thinks they are better. how many times in the past has mexico beaten usa? that is why they play, to see who is better on that day.      by the by, where are you from?|`|efGx6z3vaa	Evryone`s like that these days,<br>   The English press now beleive that since the EPL is the best league in the world they can write what they want. just read an English paper sports section, pure Bias|`|HLqzrBNmaa	USA team is second rate. Oh and its called football not soccer.|`|HKVFVS4qaa	Sorry to tell you, but, the USA is better, and I am not even American.
D6RSJ1BNaa	He's a great footballer who does not play to his potential in international football.  I really hope he gets his act together to lead the tri-color to South Africa.  C'mon Marquez!  Save your best football for World Cup matches!!!|`|TXUTwLLOaa	I think he is an awsome defender for FC Barcelona. Not so much with Mexico though.... In my opinion, he should be used as a midfeilder on his national team. Lavolpe used him on the midfield during Germany's Confederation Cup and he was just amazing. Seem's to me that he get frusterated when his national team doesnt do much offensive wise, thus losing his head but most important, he loses focus.|`|dQnQNpd5aa	I think he is the best defender in mexico and he is really a good player

wrhqkEiMaa	German teams are very underrated, they're actually very good and determined.|`|3yqCKPzVaa	:(((((( Have never supported a worse team in my entire life!!! =[|`|cOPCNP7Laa	Milan sucked. And I'm sucking up the fact that they did.|`|cf4d6d60fab75efc136a4d66dd5c03b4aa	Yes freshy German teams are underrated.
d00EEVWdaa	If they keep it small scale, low budget, play in small college stadiums, and attract maybe 8,000 fans per game, it could work.<br>  <br>  There was a WUSA women's soccer leage back in 2000, but that league failed quickly because they spent too much money on flashy advertising and commercials.<br>  <br>  This time if they keep it small, it can work.|`|IWM1khX7aa	I think it will be successful.  Obviously, soccer is played more by American women than any other sport.  So why not have a league?  I think it will just be like the WNBA.|`|5h0yIiLkaa	I hope that it isn't a failure, but i'm not super confident in it...especially in the US.
0618e1ffc3544105cebd7ba718fe439daa	in the UEFA Champions' League or UEFA Cup, if the scores are level after two matches, the first tiebreaker to decide the winner is the goals scored by the away teams in both matches. the teams which scored the most away goals will be the winner which they will progress to the next round of the competition on away goals rule. <br>  <br>  if both teams scored the same number of away goals, then there will be an additional 30 minutes of extra time (15 minutes on each half) to be played at the end of the second match between the teams concerned & if the scores are still level after the end of the extra time period, the match will then go to penalty shoot-outs. <br>  <br>  for example, here are the selected results from the 2008-2009 UEFA Cup last 32 matches: <br>  <br>  18.02.2009 - SV Werder Bremen 1-1 AC Milan<br>  26.02.2009 - AC Milan 2-2 SV Werder Bremen<br>  (aggregate scores 3-3, SV Werder Bremen won on away goals rule)<br>  <br>  from the above results, SV Werder Bremen scored two away goals while AC Milan could only scored one goal which means SV Werder Bremen progress to the next stage of the UEFA Cup & AC Milan are eliminated from the competition. <br>  <br>  19.02.2009 - Olympique Marseille 0-1 FC Twente<br>  26.02.2009 - FC Twente 0-1 Olympique Marseille<br>  (after extra time, full time 0-1, aggregate scores 1-1)<br>  (Olympique Marseille won 7-6 on penalties)<br>  <br>  from the above, both teams scored one away goal & there are no further goals scored in the second match as the aggregate scores tied at 1-1 which means the penalty shoot-outs were used to decide the winner. Olympique Marseille came out as the winner as they won 7-6 on penalty shoout-outs.|`|SmWoRu3kaa	If the scores are tied over two legs, the team which has scored more goals away from home wins the tie. If that doesn't separate the teams, 30 minutes of extra time are played. If there are no goals during extra time, the match goes to a penalty shoot-out.|`|4fb6edee8b5342751436eb2904dcd43aaa	First away goals count<br>  <br>  Then 30 mins of extra time, and if still a draw<br>  <br>  Then penalty shootout with five penalties for each team, if drawn at end of five then sudden death

Elway singlehandedly took an awful Broncos team to the Super Bowl 3 times in 4 years, then a decade later finally got a good team and won Super Bowls in his last 2 seasons.  Montana won 4 Super Bowls, only 2 of which were with Jerry Rice.  Elway and Montana put up good numbers as well, but they did so at a time when the rules were not as rigged in favor of the passing game.<br>  <br>  Brady's a great QB and was far superior to the overrated Peyton Manning (who always had great offensive talent around him and almost always had a crap defense that required him to score 40 points to win games).|`|CQgNXXsbaa	Here's how... His backup... a backup that hadn't started a football game since high school... took the same "UNDERDOG TEAM WITH POOR TALENT AROUND HIM" (your words) to an 11-5 season.<br>  <br>  So you tell me.

Nuff said.|`|RHxnMCO6aa	i wouldn't say he is the best ever but he is in the top 10. i can honestly see him being the best ever by the time his career is over. as long as he can come back from this injury to his old form.|`|GfwjOVGdaa	"********HIS ENTIRE CAREER HE HAS BEEN ON THE UNDERDOG TEAM WITH POOR TALENT AROUND HIM."<br>  <br>  Since when is the Patriots an underdog team?|`|4J519h4Oaa	Well you have this all based on winning congrats, you are only as good as the people that surround you. New England has been an elite team from the day he took over the starting job from Drew Bledsoe. But I guess you are looking at the bookies point of view in that win over the Rams. Upset maybe but I really think he is a top 10 QB but how would the Lions do with him, again you are as good as the people that surround you it takes more than one man to win championships. I hope he can comeback and be his old self we will see.

RCpkdx4haa	Jose Canseco's book came out and named specific players, including Bonds, as people had used performance enhancing drugs. When all the attention came about the government of the US wasted our money because somehow they thought this was worth spending millions on. Most players that were named had to testify in front of congress including Bonds, Mark McGwire, Sammy Sosa, Rafael Palmero, Miguel Tejada and so forth. Bonds told them that he never  KNOWINGLY took steroids, but was given the cream and the clear(later found out to be steroids from BALCO) and took them. His story is that he didn't know they were steroids. Now he's going on trial for perjury because they believe that they can prove that he DID know they were steroids.|`|n8UBfhgpaa	Because people ratted him out. <br>  I personally think they should all back off about the steroid thing. Who gives a crap anyway? I t makes it more exciting to watch. These players still have talent. If I started taking steroids tomorrow, it doesnt mean im good enough to get in the majors. All the steroids do was make there homeruns go 600 feet instead of the 450 they were going to hit it anyway. These pros still have the gift of bat speed, hand/eye coordination and skills most of us will never ever have. I say let them use steroids if they want.|`|4rG1lYFLaa	it actually may have been a fist fight, or something of the sort but the problem lied when it was realized that a man who broke babe ruthe's record was using steroids but claims he just started using them and theres no way to tell if those 600 something home runs were made while he was all streroided up|`|EvIWKqpDaa	He lied to congress.|`|Ar5VHDiBaa	parking tickets..... things kinda got out of hand after that|`|tvuhGTD9aa	Bonds was summoned to provide grand jury testimony in the original BALCO case.<br>  <br>  In his testimony, he claimed to have used "cream" and "clear" without his knowing they were steroidal.<br>  <br>  The DOJ says Bonds' claims of ignorance are a crock, hence the indictments against him for perjury and obstruction of justice.<br>  <br>  Bonds never was summoned to testify before Congress in March 2005.

Matt Hardy Said One Night On SmackDown That He No Longer Consideres Jeff His Brother And Their Is No Such Thing As The Hardy Boyz Any More.Ever Since Matt Has Still Been Jealous And Is Still Betraying Jeff And Injuring Him And All That So Yeah...Jeff Is Tring To Plan Revenge And The Hardyz Will Square Off This Coming Friday...|`|3m9DQuDRaa	As of yet, they haven't cleared that up.  Matt seems to be jealous of Jeff for some reason, but since he made him lose the title, it doesn't seem like they're really following up with it too much yet.  I suspect that there will be more to the story than is being let on at the moment.  But it all started with a beautiful chairshot to Jeff's head, laying him out and letting Edge take the belt...  and now we're trying to figure out Matt's whole plan, other than just being angry with Jeff for unknown reasons.<br>  <br>  Hopefully Christian gets involved against Edge, then maybe we'll see an "in spirit remake" of what got them famous in the first place...

JTSNljLhaa	Brady<br>  <br>  im goin to say the samething i told some other guy who said Manning was better<br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  not to mention thats Brady first year with a great set of receivers..Manning had those good receivers for awhile<br>  also is Manning an everyday anytime QB? No..take Manning out of that comfy dome and put him out there in the rain and snow he will be a interception throwing machine..he cant play in elements(rainy weather against the Chargers he got crush 6 ints..6 ints in one game!! then i cant count how many he threw against the patriots<br>  <br>  Manning is a Dome(indoor QB)<br>  put Brady in a Dome 8 out of 16 games<br>  <br>  im not saying this because im a pats fan everthing i just stated is a fact|`|zjpB2GARaa	Last season, the era of Brady and Manning came to an end and the era of the Ravens and Steelers began (and I expect them to meet in the Championship Game again, whether or not Ray Lewis decides to leave the Ravens and join the Circus).<br>  <br>  Of the 2, Brady was the better QB, as he showed once he had a supporting cast comparable to that which Manning had.  Obviously, Montana and Elway remain the greatest QBs of all time, but Brady easily ranks 3rd.  Manning is arguably #4.  Both Manning and Brady have already seen their best days and will soon begin to decline.|`|1uSoU8Lpaa	A guy who throws 50 touchdowns and only 2 interceptions in one season can not be called just a product of the system. I just don't think any QB in Tom Brady's shoes could have done as well as he did in 2007. He deserves kudos for what he did. I agree. <br>  <br>  This is a lot coming from a Packer/Favre fan. I need to go get a drink now.|`|c4b596d15eac948f611f72b6a99f85a0aa	1. No one says Brady is not in the top 50<br>  <br>  2. I think they're both great but I prefer Manning, as he's by the far the smartest qb I've ever seen.|`|CswtANgwaa	Brady and Peyton are good. But I don't think either deserve to be in that category. They have great supporting casts. The best QB's are the ones who put up the numbers without great receivers. Take John Elway for example. The broncos had pretty bad players except for him and TD. HE is a top QB because he won without guys like Randy Moss, and Marvin Harrison. Or take Ben Rothlisberger for example. He had arguably the worst line in NFL history, and he has two rings. Not a perfect supporting cast, but he played well and he in my book should deserve more consideration than both of those guys.|`|j7i0zPpWaa	Peyton Manning Stats<br>  <br>  Win/Loss 105-55<br>  Yards  45628<br>  TD's  333<br>  INt  165<br>  <br>  Games 176<br>  <br>  Tom Brady Same Source Compared<br>  <br>  Win/Loss 86-24<br>  Yards 26446<br>  TD's  197<br>  INT  86<br>  <br>  Games 113|`|o5jSID4Jaa	They are both good qb's. I am not a fan of Brady's. Randy Moss makes him look better than he actually is. Manning is a better leader. He calls all of his own plays. Manning is the best qb right now but Brady would have to be 2nd in my opinion.|`|bfeQ3miMaa	Even though I don't like him, Brady is better than Manning.  Manning is going to finish his career much like Dan Marino.  The only difference between the two right now is the one ring.  Ultimately its about winning championships, not stats.|`|g41vdiNHaa	I dont ever remember seeing Brady not  mentioned in the top 50.

AA12400459	I don't blame you for wanting to shave. The guys at my high school (in an era when they were in a strong winning streak) would do it as a symbol of commitment to the team. It helped them cement a strong emotional bond among each other. (Does your mom understand the statement you are trying to make?) They would typically get buzz cuts (1/2" or 1/4") for the district meet (the state qualifier), then shave all the way down if they made state. Would a tiered approach like that work for her?<br>  <br>  The alternative (which I really don't recommend), would be to clip (with scissors or a razor) a one inch patch of hair very short right in the center front. Your mother will probably beg you to finish the job.|`|e6194ade1f407494b6f0be00450abb7caa	cut some of your hair off, then you will have to get it shaved to even it out. Tell it is your head, not hers.|`|tYmEgxL4aa	Tell her that it makes you go faster, and that it is part of the sport of swimming. We had our big meet a couple days ago (our school is a BIG swimming school, we are undefeated) and those who just wore caps and didn't shave went slower than those who shaved. <br>  <br>  Also, you HAVE to shave your body hair, even in places where there isn't any visible hair, like your stomach, because it is just too small to see. <br>  And for your head, if you convince her, first go over it with a shearer (the big, barber kind)(your coach or one of the upperclassman swimmers will probably have one) and get all the big hair off. Then, use a razor (like Bic or Gillette) to get all the small hair the shearer left behind. It is hard to razor at first, and you should probably ask someone else to do it, because the smaller hairs are much more coarse, and if you did it yourself, it would be easy to cut yourself in the unseen spots like the back of your head.<br>  <br>  If she still doesn't let you, just shave it anyway, because she can't unshave it, it grows back, and doesn't really look that bad. And mine has already significantly started growing back in like 3 days.|`|EjClkCfiaa	Dude, swimmer to swimmer, shaving your head won't make you go any faster. You look ridiculous too.

WTw9BSOYaa	That depends on where you will be riding, if you are riding Coastal, you would want something a bit more waterproof, something around 15,000+ would be more than enough, if you are riding interior you would be fine with 10,000MM Water proofing.<br>  <br>  The first mountain range from the ocean is normally considered the Coastal mountains, anything past that range is Interior, so Colorado and the likes would be Interior, while California/Washington would be Coastal.<br>  <br>  Coastal ranges need more Waterproofing because the snow tends to be wet, and you have more of a chance riding in the rain, Interior ranges normally have very dry snow, and almost no chance of rain.<br>  <br>  The other important thing with snowboard outerwear is the seams, you always want pants with Fully Taped Seams, not Critically taped, but Fully, Those pants fit the bill on that, so id say they look pretty good.<br>  <br>  Being that you are only going to ride about 4 times a year, those pants would suit you fine, if you were riding more than that, id suggest checking out brands like 686, Bonfire, North face, and maybe Nikita, which is a Girls Specific brand.|`|uWBn5HpOaa	yeah i have those pants! they're alright. but they aren't too waterproof :[<br>  they're good, don't get me wrong. but i use them when i go just to fool around and have fun. but i wear different ones when i go to a serious mountain and try tricks.|`|jTaW3goeaa	They are good pants, you generally don't want to go below 10 K in breathability and waterproofing.  For what you're going to be riding in they will be fine.  I would still look around dogfunk which is a great site to buy stuff off of for another pair of pants with higher breathability and waterproofing ratings for around the same price because one day you could find yourself riding other than spring break in colder conditions
PCsW0gbPaa	Fullback is a position for someone that's not in it for the glory.  It's a dirty, rough, under-appreciated job.  It's also for someone with true character and honor.  You are the last line of defense for your quarterback, the only thing standing between a lost season with an injured QB, and one more first down.  You are also an earthmover for the running back, on a seek and destroy mission to level linebackers and clear lanes for the runner.  <br>  <br>  You need to learn how to read who's going to be coming into your backfield.  How to keep your balance and knock people on their butts.  You might also be asked to catch the ball, and move the pile (run right into people and keep going).|`|yJXeLhPuaa	Fullback is a good position to do it about being big,fast, blocking,running,and catching.I like your size it a good size for fullback. Make sure you hit the weight room .A good fullback understands "freeze" blocking. When busting it up the middle, my fullback runs straight at the nearest linebacker. This freezes the linebacker who waits to see which way he'll cut and, while he's waiting, the lineman blocking him has an easy target.

AA11482019	Curtis Hughes aka Mr. Hughes|`|ZbNXVQu7aa	For those of you who are insisting that the answer is Kevin Nash, you're overlooking the following details in the question:<br>  1. Nash is white.<br>  2. Nash played basketball, not football.<br>  3. Nash's finisher is the jackknife powerbomb, not the sitout powerbomb.<br>  <br>  After searching Ahmed Johnson and Tony Atlas, I found that neither fit the description, but then I stumbled across Mabel (also known as Viscera and Big Daddy V).  I still don't know if he ever used a sitout powerbomb as a finisher, but you might be thinking of the chokebomb pin (sometimes called Sex Drive, sometimes called Embalmer) he used as Viscera.  I also have no idea if he ever played college football.<br>  <br>  If I'm incorrect, then I have no idea who this wrestler could be.|`|63ce14dc7c788e16d783f90000ca7bc5aa	It is Kevin Nash, I liked that you pointed out his former football carreer and the fact that he was a bodyguard.|`|3g08yf94aa	kevin nash but his finisher is the jacknife|`|NXktxy8jaa	Kevin Nash|`|i5MxtGENaa	2 Cold Scorpio<br>  or Nelson Frazier, Jr., a.k.a viscera or big daddy v|`|Xwc9iF0Zaa	Definitely Kevin Nash|`|AA12290777	Mr. Hughes|`|oPTfkuaLaa	vader?|`|0mg4OBcMaa	Ron Simmons|`|VU6ODC5Baa	Kevin Nash|`|qwdh7N6saa	Kevin Nash|`|AA11435718	I got here late so I have go with Steve|`|GiVrrjTvaa	Darren Drozdov|`|N0N9FzEhaa	Did he bang your mom?

w1p1slURaa	in the traditional sense mma is an event where people of different martial art styles would go to fight and see what art was the best.. like karate vs. boxing or wrestling vs. kickboxing.. mma today has evolved into a sport where combatants try to learn skills from all of the martial arts. picking the best moves from each one that the learn.|`|AA10698309	Mixed martial arts is not a "traditional" martial art like Karate, Taekwondo, etc. It is the result of practioners of various martial arts evolving their skillset to become a more rounded fighter. Many say that Bruce Lee was the first mixed martial artist as he studied the strengths of many different arts to improve his individual fighting style. An example of a mixed martial artist would be a person who practices Karate learning some of the best techniques of Judo allowing them to fight on their feet or on the ground.<br>  Most of the guys you see in UFC and other similar arenas are simply really tough guys that learn a little boxing, kicking and grappling but are (typically) by no means experts or even hold black belts in any single style.<br>  <br>  <br>  I don't consider myself an expert in the history of MMA - but I am a first degree Taekwondo black belt and long time fan of mixed martial art competitions so I am not speaking out of line here.|`|Qpx6gCwFaa	You're kind of right. Almost all martial arts are a mixture of different martial arts.<br>  <br>  MMA is more of a ruleset. It's very difficult going into a more detailed explanation without it becoming confusing.
3074it1Qaa	yeah, im really liking the HHH/Orton feud. i like how HHH chased Orton and DiBiase backstage and the WWE actually showed it this time and didn't leave you hanging. haven't seen WWE like that in a while. also, the Cena/Edge and Vickie feud looks like its going nice too. i liked the HBK/JBL feud too and i can't wait to see HBK kick Kozlov's teeth down his throat and that undefeated crap cuz he lost at No Way Out. and when the legends going to kick Jericho's ***, its like bunch of men being mocked and beaten on. the only legend that struck Jericho was Flair. if they really want to spice things up then Jericho needs to get his *** kicked by a legend.|`|k8YSuKGpaa	Yes I must agree with you. It use to be that I didn't care if I missed a night of Monday NIght Raw. Now I don't want to miss a single minute of any of the three shows. They are doing much better with their feuds.|`|63ce14dc7c788e16d783f90000ca7bc5aa	Hells yeah man. I know what you mean. I love the storylines as of right now. Randy Orton vs the McMahons, Chris Jericho vs the legends and Micky Rourke. It's creative and they're doing a great job.|`|hNIyshmkaa	Yeah it's much better than what they've had, the JBL and Shawn Michaels feud was actually pretty entertaining but in a way didn't make sense. Anyway, overall I'd say they definitely improved.|`|wAiQOP0Laa	Yeah, because we haven't seen Orton/HHH or Edge/Cena before.  They're keeping it real fresh.|`|mUWy8ruJaa	yeah it is a whole lot better than before with just the same old stuff was really boring but now it isn't its more fun to watch and has a better story line. i hated when shawn Michael's worked with J B L he is a loser that doesn't seem to be able to do any thing him self.|`|b1648XnPaa	The main fueds coming into mania<br>  HHH/Orton seen it. <br>  Edge/Cena seen it<br>  Taker Michaels (possibly) seen it<br>  Random celebrity(rourke) VS one of your top stars Y2J seen it <br>  uhh what are the fresh fueds again|`|wdDYM7TJaa	Maybe, but no doubt WWE sucks right now, I stopped watching it, it's so boring.|`|q5rS0IXbaa	They have gotten way better right now.|`|Ya8Uaf7caa	Not completely because they ended up ditching some storylines too fast and some of them have been good.<br>  For instance the Kane-Kelly Kelly angle was pretty good it had me guessing who could be her man; turns out to be the uber bad guy Randy Orton who was already up to no good. How did that end? He "beat" Kane without an RKO. The story didn't even make sense b/c Randy, as alot of people already knew, is married with a child. So many places they could have gone with this...<br>  Rey v. Mike Knox: Knox attacks him for no reason; meaning the writers could not come up with anything<br>  Jamie Noble v. William Regal & Layla: did not settle<br>  Michelle McCool v. Maryse: those two have unfinished business but now they're a tag team all because McCool beat up Maria. Natalya should have a feud with McCool cuz she retired her friend and mentor<br>  Undertaker v. Shelton Benjamin: no inciting incident, did not settle<br>  Christian's return: why is he not involved with Edge and the Hardyz? At least say something!<br>  They don't keep up kayfabe: Orton's family, HHH marriage to Steph is real, Cena still can't wrestle...|`|Pvg6djVSaa	yeah

ZbNXVQu7aa	What is "stail"?  Sorry.  Couldn't resist asking, even though I know you mean "stale".<br>  <br>  I too have been a fan of The Undertaker since the first time I saw him, but I disagree with your assessment that the Deadman gimmick is "growing old".  If anything, it's gotten better because he's improved the mind games (which I didn't think was possible to do after the sheer perfection of his mind games with Jake "The Snake" Roberts).<br>  <br>  As the American Bad A s s, his mind games lost a step (although The Last Ride powerbomb made up for that), but as I already said in the previous paragraph, he regained that step as well as added another one after once again becoming the Deadman.|`|R4dXxh6paa	He is so shallow, he's gotta have a sign for Jeff Hardy that says "No Diving"....THAT was comedy right there!<br>  <br>  yea, but as I was saying he's supershallow and WWE is only riding on people who will love the deadman and can see through his completely shallowness or are completely oblivious to it, either one.<br>  <br>  He also has absolutely no mind games any more. Seriously, I was addicted when the whole Orton/'Taker angle was going on. That was his prime, his brakes have slowly been applyed ever since that as he gets closer and closer to retirement. I think the 'Taker/Edge Hell in the Cell match recently was his last hurah for his career. Sorry, but he's gonna go down like a Lead Balloon|`|3074it1Qaa	he's definitely being underused. he is basically getting jobbed cuz he will retire in the next few years. but don't worry the Deadman will get another shot at glory.|`|CC3FZj9Caa	he is getting staler by the day...first he loses to Triple H at No Way Out..now on Smackdown he will lose to Vladmir Kozlov according to spoilers|`|AA12290777	Stale? Please! Undertaker is still good, but not as good as he was before though, but i would definately not say stale. He has been wrestling for 25 years! He has had injuries and he prob doesn't want to go back to american bad @$$ cause in his mind its prob nonsense for a 43 year old man to go around riding a motorcycle; he might think that the fans would think that he is trying to be young again. I like the deadman gimmick. The way that the druids come out and hold the torches at wrestlemania still excites me.  He is still charasmatic and can move around just as good as he used to. To make a long story short, the undertaker is NOT stale!|`|Ya8Uaf7caa	it's like they don't know how to use him other than a measuring stick for the younger talent. He feuded with Lesnar to put him over, then Cena, then Orton, then Batista, then Edge, then Hardy, now Koslov, sort of now with Benjamin. They had him feud with the Big Show so that he could forget about Vickie.<br>  Bad a s s or not they have to use him better, like have him do a story line with his real life girlfriend McCool.|`|GExKoh1Gaa	leave a cup of tea in your room for a week then smell it,it will smell like undertakers gimmick.<br>  he is old,boring and never puts anyone over<br>  <br>  16-1|`|N0N9FzEhaa	hE IS GETTING KINDA STALE, I mean check it Jobbing to HHH, jobbing to Kozlov, Jobbing to your mom. He gave her a tombstone piledriver but he was holding her for like 10min b4 he dropped her.....hhmmnn odd.|`|WIiKPQZTaa	I think they will turn him heel one more time before he retires, make him face sooner or later and then have him go out big one more time at 20-0|`|hVqGuOOPaa	i think so 2 he isn't as good as he was before hes wearig out|`|BCyTD7nIaa	you fail|`|tEwZWXstaa	just give him time|`|JiCfYfLraa	hes getting old|`|KIOR56r6aa	ABA was overrated

XF6y29y3aa	Well I am kind of the same thinking as you but the sports hunting is older than pyramids. I agfree that they shouldn't allowed it.

Also the woodchucks damage fields the farmers grow your crops in...... So they invite me to handle the problem.....|`|m5FyTeYgaa	I'm not sure what you are talking about. I've hunted all my life, in many different states, and I've never heard of being able to hunt an animal for no reason.<br>  <br>  Most game is harvested for food. This is true of deer, elk, moose, waterfowl, rabbit, grouse, pheasant, etc.<br>  <br>  Some game is harvested for population control. Crows, groundhogs, coyotes.<br>  <br>  Can you tell me an animal that is hunted just for sport?|`|cR7Sf4cjaa	You are mixing words.<br>  <br>  Only natives are given the federal right to 'subsistance hunting' to put indiginous food on their tables.  This is one set of laws and regulation.<br>  <br>  For non-natives - the term they decided to use 100 years ago was 'sport hunting'.  <br>  <br>  I live in Alaska and my family can fish under subsistance regulations - but - we don't qualify for the subsistance hunting - so we have to hunt under the 'sport season'.  That does not make the food I put on the table any less important because the name is different.<br>  <br>  I have been a long time Alaskan hunter.  I do not know anyone, or, have meet anyone - that thinks killing an animal is fun.  Hunting is allot of hard work - ain't nobody sporting a smile on their face when gutting a moose and fighting off flies, mosquitoes and yellow jackets - then walking miles and miles making trip after trip to haul 700 lbs of meat out on your back pack.  If you think this is sport - please - come and help out.  No since in my family keeping all the "fun" to themselves.|`|6KaMW1Vzaa	It's not only allowed, it's encouraged and needed. Without sport hunting, the government would have to hire the job done, with a lot less effectiveness and huge expense.  The negative impact on both animal populations and the budget would be enormous.<br>  If you think it's "for no reason," then you have not the slightest clue what hunting is all about and shouldn't be critical.|`|FhHIAbmLaa	I have been hunting for 30 years, and I don't eat all my game. I usually give away squirrels, and just discard crows.<br>  <br>  I am thinking that by sport hunting you mean people who don't eat their game. I will say that hunting serves many purposes. It for one controls population of animals, as well as make healthier animals. It is self sufficient in most states, and even creates jobs. And it is also a great way to enjoy the outdoors as well as get in touch with the survivor/ predator in all of us.<br>  <br>  Now if my assumption of what you ask is incorrect, I suggest you refer to Glacierview's answer. He describes hunting as only available to Native Americans by law, with little or no restriction. The rest of us sport hunt meaning we pay for tags, and hunt during seasons.<br>  <br>  I hope this helps.|`|5z85xkfbaa	Why do they allow 'Fire Sales'?

6vzpHTqQaa	Brandon Lyon = yes.  He is a proven closer (in the past...for Arizona) and will most likely win the role in Detroit.<br>  <br>  Kevin Gregg = no.  Despite closer experience, the Cubs will most likely go with the younger, harder throwing Carlos Marmol.<br>  <br>  Fernando Rodney = no.  Detroit tried that last year and Rodney tanked.<br>  <br>  Joel Zumaya = no (maybe later on).  He is injury prone and, despite good stuff on the hill, the Tigers might want to keep him in the setup role.<br>  <br>  Billy Wagner = no.  Francisco Rodriguez is the closer for the Mets now and Wagner is out for the year with an injury.<br>  <br>  JP Howell = no.  The Rays have two options ahead of Howell at closer: Troy Percival and Dan Wheeler.<br>  <br>  Best bet = Lyon<br>  Maybe = Zumaya, Gregg<br>  Not a chance = Rodney, Wagner, Howell|`|ZyfYh4vdaa	Brandon Lyon- I don't think so<br>  Kevin Gregg-Only if Marmol fails as a closer<br>  Fernando Rodney-Highly Doubt it<br>  Joel Zumaya-Quite Possibly<br>  Billy Wagner-Out for the year<br>  JP Howell-Mabey|`|mqgS6Dfxaa	The best bet is Kevin Gregg.  He'll get a lot of saves for the Cubs.  I'm not sure on the others but I do know that Wagner won't pitch all year.|`|W7BZcdynaa	Lyon is Detroits closer.|`|xRPjgGs1aa	Lyon|`|6b4d4fb2e519a8ffe2f58e1c9e3c4a2baa	NONE OF THEM ARE MO RIVERA SO, WHO CARES?|`|5lIEEAUkaa	Lyon-Perhaps. More experience is the role, but with up and coming flamethrowers it'll be tough. Plus, he had a rough 2nd half last year.<br>  <br>  Rodney-Good stuff,plus change. Rough 2nd half last year.<br>  <br>  Zumaya-Obviously, he has filthy stuff. But the arm injury has made him lose some control. I'm not saying he can't gain it back, but typically it takes longer than Spring Training to get back to form.<br>  <br>  I give the closers job to Lyon, only because he and Todd Jones are alike, and he had success. If Rodney and Zumaya are in the 7th and 8th (Fast and faster), then bring in Lyon(Slow) it will throw off their timing. I'm gonna say Lyon. He needs to pick it up tho<br>  <br>  Gregg-This is the closest one, I think. Gregg vs. Marmol. Gregg has been successful over the past few seasons, but Marmol has been dominant. Either way it's a win, but I'm gonna go with Gregg only because he has more experience. But I have a feeling he will mess up and it will be given to Marmol half way through the season.<br>  <br>  Wagner is out for the season with an injury.<br>  <br>  JP Howell, doubt it. He's actually being considered for the rotation. It's between Percival(Is he even playing?), Isringhausen and Balfour, I believe. I say it goes to Percy or Balfour.|`|GW2HHBw9aa	Brandon Lyon has the best chance to close. <br>  Gregg wont close as the job will go to Marmol. <br>  The Tigers have shown no inclination to use Rodney or Zumaya as a closer as health is a bigger concern. <br>  Wagner is out until at least August and if he does come back, he will be behind Putz and Rodriguez. <br>  JP Howell has been effective as a reliever but Maddon prefers to use him in key situations and against lefties, not necessarily as a ninth inning guy. I would expect Wheeler or Isringhausen (if he impresses in Spring Training) to get saves for the Rays.|`|AA10263761	Brandon Lyon<br>  Billy Wagner is out for most of the season|`|hv8ytdaoaa	Kevin Gregg|`|uT7NxNvUaa	right now in detroit, i'd put my money on zumaya
Y4mz8BShaa	There's nothing wrong with your GBB. Smaller, lighter, cheaper, and gets the job done just as well.<br>  <br>  The Scorpion is a machine pistol, and, just as I always state, there's only one good AEP: The CM030. The Skoprion is built pretty solid, and performs great, but it's still an AEP.<br>  <br>  For upgrade parts:<br>  <a href="http://www.airsoftatlanta.com/parts_aep.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.airsoftatlanta.com/parts_aep....</a>
95bb76d0439c02bb72678f77c90632acaa	Yes. If your pH is low ( an acidic water condition), then expect metal parts that come into contact with the pool water to get eaten. Most filters and pump parts that come into contact with pool water these days are made of plastic, so there's little chance that you'll damage them, but if you own an older (20 years or more) filter or pump, they may have metal bodies, impellers or multiports and are susceptible to damage. If you own a pool heater, the interiors of them have copper heat exchangers that are quite thin and will easily hole if your pH is very low. They're expensive to replace, about 1/2 the total cost of an entire new heater. Not something you want to damage.<br>    The same can happen to a concrete pool's finish. It can etch and become rough. A vinyl liner pool can have it's liner become brittle and age prematurely. If the TA is low too, that liner can wrinkle around the main drain too. Those wrinkles will never come out.<br>  There's also the probability that the cause of your low pH has something to do with your Total Alkalinity being low as well. Take a sample into your local pool shop in a clean, pool water rinsed out ( don't use your tap water since it'll contaminate your sample), container. They'll run the usual tests. If it turns out that your TA is low, they'll ask that you fix that before attempting to adjust your pH. Most often, when you bring your TA back inline, your pH will follow by itself, requiring little or no adjustment unless your TA was really out of whack.

b299b6f7ae59c5434e4f37421a123123aa	If you are going to race then there is only one bike I would suggest for someone your size and taht is the crf150r.  Great little bike with loads of power.  Just check that they have a section for your age group that will allow you to race the bike as I know where I am you can only race them till 16 but I think it may be different for girls in other countries|`|d72a8e15b90497f4f828744386c193a2aa	CRF150R all the way!! That bike would be absolutely perfect for your size. I see some really fast girls at the track so you'll never hear me say girls need less of a bike.|`|0eA4gkHdaa	2 stroke dirt bikes are real good but if you can get a crf150r four stroke, it is a 4 stroke racing bike and good for trails and everything else.

I don't like chevys at all so I don't really pull for Newman in any way, but when he used to drive dodge, I didn't mind seeing him win races.  I don't really hear his name mentioned that often during races.  I wouldn't mind seeing him make the chase this year, just as long as he doesn't win any races or win the championship.|`|0MuRCU5paa	I don't have anything bad to say about him. I respect him a lot because of the time and money he and his wife put towards adopted animals awareness. I forget what the name of their foundation is.

GZYBSV7Raa	Jump roping will not increase your vertical leap. It might strengthen your toe and shin muscles, giving you an inch or so, but by itself it is an ineffective exercise to increase vertical jump.<br>  <br>  You want to focus on exercises that increase your strength and explosiveness. I found a great article on the best exercises to jump higher: <a href="http://www.jump101.info/articles/exercisestojumphigher.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.jump101.info/articles/exercis...</a> . Squats, deadlifts, power cleans, and glute-ham raises are the best.<br>  <br>  James T.|`|e7br8pIfaa	not really, no. boxer's use is to pick up their foot quickness when moving around the ring, so it'll help you gain maybe 2 inches, but that's about it. try doing lunges with dumbells instead, and some squats too.|`|vXFpzKRaaa	Jumping rope is great.  You can also try doing squats but do them in this fashion.  Go down slow, about 5 seconds to go down and explode up when you get your thighs parallel to the ground.  Even without weights, you can do this and it'll still help you a lot.  But without weights I suggest you take much longer to go down ( maybe 7 to 10 seconds) and explode up as high as you can.  Land and do it over again.  A variation would be to do the squats exercise but jump up using only one leg and alternate legs.  You can land with both legs but jump using only one leg.  Good luck.|`|vuh0i3Axaa	yes...<br>  <br>  just jumping rope normally helps your leg muscles...<br>  <br>  why do you think boxer's do it?

There is always drama on a team and for some reason, you don't want that to be (I know I wouldn't) so I think if your team opens up about how they feel about the team, the bonding will be there.

EjClkCfiaa	Wear goggles!!! I didn't for a time and my vision was very very blurry. <br>  Give your eyes some time to recover and take some drops, they should get better. If they don't see a doctor soon. <br>  <br>  Hope you get better!|`|YSa3Mdz3aa	The recent change in the severity of irritation may be due to an adjustment in the chlorine levels in a pool. Flushing with eye drops is always a good idea. Milk also works to relieve irritation because it neutralized the chlorine which is acidic and milk is slightly basic. Yeah ... I know it sounds weird putting milk in your eyes but it really helps. I have found that wearing contacts in the pool also helps lessen the effects of chlorine as it provides an extra layer of protection, but I need them for vision anyway.|`|gB7Paer0aa	i've been on a swim team for a loooong time, that only happens when i don't wear goggles...
AA11016927	I've only eaten Mudfish/Bowfin once. <br>  <br>  I was hanging out with some 'Glades Indians and they made me the classic "Mudfish & Grits". <br>  <br>  It was good. <br>  <br>  However, with the amount of garlic and spicy dry rub they put on the fillets almost any fish would have tasted OK. <br>  <br>  I tasted a piece without all the "extras" and it had an intense muddy flavor similar to a "muddy flavored Catfish". <br>  <br>  I agree with everyone else; why eat Mudfish when almost everywhere you go you can catch a mess of Bluegill? <br>  <br>  I'd take Bluegill over muddy-tasting Bowfin anyday!|`|q8dX0MsNaa	l have never caught or eaten one but l have been told they are fairly good. a number of people do eat them so they shouldn't be too bad. just fillet one out and have a go.<br>  l would imagine they should also be skinned.|`|XKdUGiwFaa	I have never eaten one.  I have caught many.  They have a smell to them that is not good.  I can't imagine eating one unless I was starving to death.  They make good fertilizer for the garden.  If you eat one, I would be interested in knowing how it turns out.  I'm curious, but not curious enough to try eating one.  <br>  <br>  There is an old joke about cooking Bowfin aka Dogfish.  It goes...The only way to cook a Dogfish is to roll it in um ahh...Horse #hit.  Then scrape off the horse #hit, throw away the fish, and cook that up,  umm, that's good eating.  <br>  <br>  Don't let my joke discourage you though.  Like I said, I have never eaten one so I really can't say for sure.  Good luck and I hope to hear how it turns out.|`|Ct0DRr5maa	i've caught countless numbers of bowfin in a local reservoir.  while i've never personally eaten one, i've given many fish to a poor family who ate anything of legal size.  they informed me that when cooking the bowfin the meat tends to bubble up and smell funky.  i would not eat one unless i was in a bad situation.  but try it out and see if i/my friends were wrong.

A reasonable guess would be that they're cracking down on this.  <br>  <br>  Given the legal precedents established in the Napster case, if I were you, I'd be a bit wary of watching, since you are, in effect, stealing copyrighted material.<br>  <br>  If you're not referring to online...your local sports bar would be a great place to watch games.|`|9GzkVwfGaa	justin.tv|`|ll2y4YIGaa	if youre going out, then you A.) should be worried about the other people<br>  B.) just go to the bar or a place with a tv|`|Jy9KNgSDaa	i would have to say the best place to watch free hockey is the bar|`|N1OnviExaa	atdhe.net|`|5etFAmrsaa	hockeywebcasts.com<br>  <br>  EDIT: Oh sorry, I thought you meant online. lol|`|WJpJ6CVpaa	Your best bet for highlights is youtube, but other than that I doubt there are any sites where you can watch hockey.<br>  <br>  try alluc.org thats your best bet but I doubt you will find what you need, sorry.<br>  <br>  Just go to your local rink and watch hockey :D|`|S7J9hUs4aa	atdhe.net<br>  <br>  you will find what you want so you don't have to go to your local rink.|`|RDdvsZM2aa	atdhe.net is not working for me anymore... nothing but stupid college hoops and soccer.

syzMIfLLaa	great, great picking, you have the two of the three top tier SS in the game.  Which is the second shallowest position.  (production from 2b tougher to get)  Pujouls is who everyone thinks should go number one, but you can get really good production from the 10th best 1b.  So getting a great SS is great, having two gives you a huge bargining chip.  Rolllins had a tough year last year, missed a few games and was injured, but will be great this year, you will be able to put him at Util., or trade him if the need arises.  The guy that said you should have taken an Ace with one of the first 3 picks is pretty shakey advice, think about it, let everyone else take the good pitchers, when they get hurt (several Ace pitchers spend half the season on the DL every year) pick up some sleepers, let your excelent relievers carry you, and you'll be in the top third of the pitching catagories, be in the top quarter of the hitting catagories, and you should win the league.  unless someone picked all of the "sleepers," You have a good team, you have several good relievers, if you get way ahead in the saves, about half way through the season trade one of them for a bat to replace your weakest position player.  between one closer and J Roll, you should be able to trade for about anyone.|`|B46t8gkLaa	i take pujols #1 over anyone but maybe your way will pay off. i like to take a staff ace (pitcher) with one of my top 3 picks.|`|CPF2kD3eaa	u might wanna package rollins in a deal this could be really smart people are always in need of a ss|`|QGvDi2U6aa	yeah I like that move, you have a UT spot I assume, so you can still use rollins, but SS is a really shallow position, So I'm sure you got some primetime trade bait right there...and dont listen to that other guy, 1B is SO deep this year, I'm sure you were still ok at other positions|`|SEcM9EDZaa	Great, you've got the middle infield spots covered and will scrounge for scraps at the corners. You should've grabbed a good 1B over Rollins.
UhPIYoriaa	Well, any grappling or close fighting, submissions and anything that can cause contact with it is a pontential danger.  Your best bet is to take it out before fighting and I would recommend not getting it at all, but its all about personal preference.|`|4ca485ab10aead5ea4089df6e7d8f86aaa	So long as you are able to remove the ring before training- and make sure you do, because as others here have noted, an accident involving it won't be pretty- it should have no impact on your training.|`|wJM0OD3Jaa	Great.<br>  Another 16 year old black belt.<br>  <br>  Got news for you little girl, lip and belly rings are not only tacky, but ask yourself why you would want to put a sharp piece of metal between your organs and someones strike.|`|AA11825974	ouch... if someone hit you in the stomach, it would hurt a lot and probably make you bleed or pull out.|`|Y1npBMS0aa	when they kick you on the chest protector or even while practicing it can hurt a lot. while practicing you should take it out. thats what i did with my earrings and any hair clips.|`|HQrqA2I1aa	most tournaments will disqualify you and it goes against most practices to get stupid **** like that.<br>  <br>  respect your body by not selling out to crappy trends|`|8aZC3PSaaa	dont get a belly ring its sort of trashy and if uit is a hoop it may get caught on something|`|WWnkLkqqaa	wait till someone hits you with a mae-geri and it rips it out, then you will realise|`|iySUY6Hnaa	i dont think it will
9zyJTQxuaa	Since you didn't specify what marker it is this is kind of a tough question. Many guns such as Tippman 98's A-5's and BT-4's Etc Etc, are all semi-automatic markers, Many company's have upgrades known as E-Grips, this will change your semi-auto marker into a full Electro marker giving you different fire modes such as Semi, Full Auto , Burst & Ramping. So just do a little research and find out if your marker has the option of upgrading to an E-grip and if so theres your answer.|`|13bc7214bebe9f20a8000b9480b7b9d7aa	For most markers you can buy an electronic trigger frame.  So yes.<br>  <br>  I hold my expertise with spyders and spyder clones.  In the old days, when electronic trigger frames were incredibly expensive (they are relatively cheap now) what we would do was take a file and file down the bolt catch on the trigger frame.  If done properly, it would create an "automatic" however, the bother with this is is to not file too much off or you would have a spell of problems.<br>  <br>  The trouble with that entire method is that it is irreversible, you cannot control the bursts, as the whole premise is not controlling the bolt, you do not know from shot to shot if it will fire once, or your entire hopper.  If you do succeed in doing this, don't expect to be able to play on any insured fields with this marker as most cannot have automatics.
cd51ab07fbecfef33f286305112484c4aa	Honestly, never heard of him before this question. At 5-8, 177 lbs. he sounds a bit small, but players his size have made it in the NFL. Could not find anything about him on any NFL Draft site, so I would have to say his chances are between slim and none of making a NFL roster.|`|Pa3OlB7taa	He could be a Wes Welker type player, but I haven't heard any draft talk.  He was a stud for Texas Tech!

NEtVRjplaa	They were trying to stop Spain and France from becoming unified.  England fought along with Austria, Prussia etc. and they were able to keep them apart. So England helped keep the balance powers... they might have gotten some land as well.

sywoTNKgaa	Haha I'm sure you didn't mean this to be  taken seriously, but if Federer is looking to take someone out I think he'd be aiming for Nadal. Murray might be a nuisance but Nadal is the one who is actually standing in the way of his legacy.|`|gP7IB2XCaa	That's really stupid...Federer didn't bad mouth Andy. All he said was that Andy shouldn't be considered the favorite because he is yet to prove himself. He hasn't even won a slam yet... That's totally  correct. Why would someone be a favorite to win a slam if they didnt even win one yet???|`|gCGbbIMcaa	How could Roger Federer possibily have something to do with Andy Murray`s illness??!! Man ive seen some ridiculous questions on yahoo tennis (some even posted by me ahaha) by boy! this sure does take the biscuit !! <br>  <br>  Andy Murray has a viral infection, its very simple to understand! Wtf i cant even be bothered typing anymore to this question sooo goodbye.|`|XtFsntdSaa	Funny question, you mean he secretly put something in his food or drink so he got sick or paid a trainer to treat him wrongly. No I don't think Fed is that sneaky and there is no way he could get away with it. But Federer could definitely be jealous of Murray's improvement.|`|i0e9DY9uaa	woooooooooooooooooooooow! how did u come to the fact that fed would do anything to win??????? have u EVER seen him doing something that is not athletic!? stop saying these none sense cuz he's just losing.he didn't badmouthed Andy... COME ON friend!!
b299b6f7ae59c5434e4f37421a123123aa	For someone who is just starting out and will no doubt be growing at a very fast pace O'Neal are fine.  They are not the best boot out there but you don't need to spend that extra at this stage as O'Neal will give your son all the protection he needs.  Steer clear of Thor as they are not good at all and are also not that comfortable.<br>  <br>  Once your son is a few years and a number of pairs of boots down the track you can look at a better boot like Alpine Star.  <br>  <br>  When he has outgrown the boots sell them on ebay.  I have sold so many pairs of boots my sons have outgrown and got good money for them as they were never worn out.  These days my youngest goes through about 4 pairs of Alpine Stars a year completely worn through so it isn't an option.|`|k6Sbm9qCaa	oneal is a perfect brand for kids boots they are reasonbly prices and last a long time.<br>  every other high-end brand like alpinestars, sidi, gernre are great boots but a seven yearold does not need a pair of 500$  boots.|`|HgBvRwjraa	Alpinestars definately make the best boots.  They have the most ankle support available to prevent ankle and lower leg injuries.  Tons of support to prevent broken bones.|`|8unHrIsDaa	i've got the o'neal element boots and love them. o'neal is very underrated and i would strongly recommend them to anyone, boots or gear.|`|638Re4Z9aa	Get Alpinestar or Gaerne, both very good brands, but if those are to expinsive, O'Neal is a good brand|`|EkfF2Pztaa	mm, get him alpinestars:]|`|tj2721jxaa	Sidi is the best boot company ever, i have them and they are already broken in the first time you put them on because of the hinge! its great. but oneal will be ok if you dont want to spend that much money. you get what you pay for! haha i know that sounds stupid but its true.
QcmNHRzyaa	it sure will|`|RuJYupFWaa	A remote line? Yeah, that will work.  It'll have an attachment that screws into the asa.|`|9zyJTQxuaa	Yes, a remote line is used to fit into any guns ASA without the tank having to be directly mounted on the gun. So I'm assuming you have a Tac vest/ pack to hold your tank as well, if not your going to need one to hold your tank. if not it defies the whole purpose of a remote line.|`|pW2yLol6aa	yes it will i got a mr1 and it worked

It wasn't until i was much older i understood the seriousness and tragedy of the occasion.|`|SIKuOevVaa	I was 19 and I think it was mentioned on the evening news in the U.S., but because it wasn't an American event we moved on immediately.  Probably not fair.  But if an American visiting England had been among those killed, the U.S. media would have flogged the story for weeks on end.<br>  <br>  It happened about 6 months before the earthquake that interrupted the World Series in San Francisco.  Nobody was killed in the stadium, but when the shock of the fires and the collapsed double-deck roadways on the Bay Bridge and the I-880 freeway set in it was emotionally devastating.<br>  <br>  I noticed that on the Saturday following the 20th anniversary of Hillsborough, Arsenal hosts Liverpool.  I hope there will be some sort of moment at the Emirates Stadium to step aside and take note of it.  I've also heard there will be a memorial game at Anfield featuring Liverpool old-timers.|`|FN11c540aa	3 of my mates died there it was a very sad and emotional day for me and my mates families <br>  they will never walk alone|`|uUitKmJMaa	Really sad day in Liverpools history.<br>  <br>  RIP.|`|rfCGWFNcaa	i watched in dis belief.....it was a sad day for everyone.....R.I.P.....all those involved......the bradford disaster i remember watching on grandstand what a nightmare and the same for the heysel disaster

QuGTZJIVaa	Transformed? TRANSFORMED? You can see it in Richard Dunne's face, they have confidence in the keeper now, i don't think the back 4 did when Hart was in goal.<br>  <br>  A rising talent that he should be, he's not the finished article yet and he won't take the club forward.  he is a player for the future, not right now.  He flaps a lot but could be a great England no.1.  He needs to swallow his pride and learn from Given, who i've wanted at City for donkey's years.  Given is the greatest unsung keeper the Prem has ever seen, and it shows by the fact we're unbeaten in 4 out of 5 matches.|`|BV2N3F8iaa	Joe Hart is a very good keeper and has played well in a team that has not performed in front of him, he is young enough to grow into a truly brilliant keeper as he has age on his side.<br>  <br>  BUT do we ever go away from a game and say Joe Hart was outstanding today and was the difference between the 2 teams with truly match or point winning saves? <br>  <br>  I have said this about Shay Given at least 4 times already......|`|hWaynBpMaa	I think all the players Hughes has brought in have now found their stride. Bridge looks brilliant, Kompany has settled the midfield now he is back after doing the defencive work, while Dunne was missing. Zabaletta awsome. De Jong getting better each game. Wright philips better than he`s ever been. Belamy a revelation. and look at the change in Ireland and is it me or since the portsmouth game has Micah Richards looked like the england international he once looked like. and remember petrov. johnson and Bejonov all near to comebacks. and shay is the best keeper in the premier. and also lets not forget ounoua|`|kRHXcsX7aa	shay given is a quality keeper....a very good signing for city....i dont think joe hart was playing that well this season even thou i feel he will develuop into a good keeper in the future.....shay given already has pure class about him .....on numerous ocassions at newcastle he was their best player and i feel they will miss him big time...... he went to man city to win things which he could achieve at newcastle.....mark hughes has made a really good signing in given.....his ablity will further breath confindence into their team espically their defence and breed well for the future in terms of watever big money signings they will buy.|`|htQX8Ywgaa	Given has given us a lot more stability, but the midfield have, too. Zabaleta has been great in there, and de Jong's passing is excellent. Kompany can always be called upon, too. And now with the  attacking players too, we seem to be going places!|`|tfotPdeZaa	Hmm. Perhaps :)|`|FN11c540aa	shay given is one hell of a goal keeper i must admit|`|x2mgUMb6aa	too early to say yet.<br>  great keeper though|`|LNfQSoPkaa	No the best signing is Craig Bellamy, Shay Given didn't do much tonight|`|7Tw7s6HSaa	Robinho, Bellamy and Given have all proved to be great signings|`|D7Dubtt9aa	I think Bellamy is flying at the moment <br>  Given was always going to be a class signing for any club I dont think many keepers in the premiership are better. Bellamy was a risk that seems to be coming off so far anyway.|`|0dTXkBopaa	I rekon he dogged newcaslte, they were in a time of need for a top class keeper, but he joined the richest club.<br>  And yeh i rekon joe hart was doing fine for city.<br>  He could of got an england start.<br>  <br>  Unlucky mate your still 22 or sumtin|`|NmSSKnnWaa	im not a hughes fan but if he signed given what a signing.always was a super keeper.but what about bellamy? he is on fire|`|lkNJNnlSaa	Yeah i think that's fair.<br>  <br>  I feel abit bad for Joe Hart though.|`|kLNhAEVpaa	Lol.<br>  Uhm...I guess.
Wv0UKUdiaa	The coach... we lost the title in the last ten minutes of matches last season!!!!|`|tIBZ9Gi3aa	I always put this down as complacency.If you're scoring goals and keeping attackers at bay effectively for maybe 75 minutes,you start to slack and feel that you've done your job,and/or the strikers couldn't penetrate for this long,so why could they penetrate now?Then you relax and move out of position for extended periods of time.It's just a matter of time before a through pass splits the defence in half.|`|jLRpCt03aa	Poor tactics. I think that pretty much decides a deadlock/tight scoreline like, in the last 1/4 of the match. I remember just fairly recently in a La Liga game, I thought Pep messed up his substitutions and/or didnt use his remaining ones and that cost us a tactical win.|`|mK06dus9aa	Nerves, or lack of stamina, or lack of mental toughness, also when it becomes a pattern it gives the opponents hope so they never give up.<br>  <br>  ha ha TD for a generalization - pathetic|`|QuGTZJIVaa	Feeling too confortable, complacency, cockyness, inability to deal with sudden pressure when they concede the first goal, nervousness, fear, heads drop, weak passing, tired legs and then the second one goes in.  By that point momentum is lost and its a lost game.<br>  <br>  I'm a Manchester City supporter, believe me i've seen it happen more times than i can remember mate. Commiserations about tonight.|`|8UOkX4Jnaa	Gosh its sucks to lose like that but really Ancelotti needs to leave, he did a lot for Milan and I really appreciate it but now its toooooo much to handle i say its time to say "We Love you Ancelotti, but its time to go..!"|`|IJvwYe1yaa	MJ got it.|`|WS8MvKQAaa	overconfidence|`|VpiYSQVnaa	i usually put it down to<br>  <br>  loss of concentration, feeling alittle too comfortable after you've obtained a comfortable lead, as the first answerer mentioned..inability to recover from a conceded goal and before u can get back on your feet, the opponents have already tied the game. Also, having an early lead may cause your opponents to fight harder, increasing their chance of scoring.<br>  Bottom line is, there really is no excuse for it, especially when it becomes a pattern, u would think something would be done to prevent it from happening again.

GyGhHpRraa	Absolutely not.  I'm stunned by some of these answers.  The Penguins have received numerous offers from other players.. some even cheaper than Whitney.  But no.. they trade Ryan Whitney (who most teams feel is a great Dman looking for a change of scenery) for 30 year old Chris Kunitz who makes just about exactly the same amount of money.  <br>  <br>  As I said in another answer.. being from Pittsburgh, it's hard to hate my home team.  These Penguins, however, are starting to really sh*t the bed.  I'm not a genius, nor a GM.. but I do have common sense.  Unless there's a miracle that Pittsburgh trades that washout/hack Jordan "The most overrated player in the NHL" Staal.. then I don't see Pittsburgh doing anything this year.  Way to go Pens.  You're going to do worse than you did before the AS Break, and you didn't even cut any cap room to sign a formidable winger in the offseason.  So enjoy your 30 yr old winger who's career best was on a Stanley Cup anaheim duck team of only 60 points.  Whitney is a Dman.. and his best was 59.<br>  <br>  1 point...<br>  <br>  <br>  My bf was born and raised in Detroit.. loves his Red WIngs.  I might just join this club very soon.  Call me what you want..<br>  <br>  Horrible trade.. absolutely horrible.  Congrats Anaheim for making Pittsburgh look like complete morons.|`|HTKSoWLTaa	I think it was a good move, Letang and Go-Go are better and cheaper defensemen.  Let not forget that our terrible defense might a little bit to do with Whitney and his soft play.  As far as what the Pens got in return, I'm more excited about the prospect.  Kunitz will provide some grit with a scoring touch.  Maybe stick up for Crosby a little.  I really hope all works out though.|`|pMIc1XXWaa	yes it was a good trade for both teams. anahiem needed to strengthen their blue line and the pens needed to try to find someone who can click with crosby. hopefully for them kunitz can do it.|`|ec3E6gSbaa	No, I liked him. I just don't feel like its right.<br>  This Kunitz dude better make a good first impression in the Blackhakws game Friday.|`|FY17j1Ajaa	Whitney has been brutal this season. He needed to go, but it makes you wonder if the Pens got enough for him. Maybe they did.|`|N1OnviExaa	The Pens are among the worst in goals against, and instead of trying to strengthen their defense they trade a good defensman for a forward. I don't see the point.|`|9f7c3a6b1c85a2b25fdaadcc6f4cc32aaa	They needed more scoring from the wings and Kunitz should be able to provide some of what they lost when Malone left. But the best part of the deal could end up being getting Tangradi who is a big kid that projects as a very good power forward type. Tangradi is big, skates well and seems to have come into his own this year establishing himself as a net presence. He needs to work on his game, inconsistency seems to be a problem but he is only 20 and when he arrives he will be a cap friendly addition (not a small thing in the cap world). Seems like the perfect deal for both sides, each gets help where they need it and neither appears to have been shortchanged (yet).|`|AA12172407	I see this is a win for the Ducks. When motivated (and he has NOT been this year in Pittsburgh) Whitney can be very dominating.<br>  The Pens get another forward...hardly what I think they needed. Their D is already super thin.|`|FEIXGtQyaa	He was and still is a solid player, and i wish him the best in the future.. Plus, he didn't average that many points per season.<br>  <br>  Oh well, he's gone and hopefully Staal will follow!|`|AA10943884	Yes.  Makes Mario Lemieux richer

r5AMG8g7aa	Not even close. There are millions in the U.S.A. alone. There is not way to know for sure since the Shake-And Bake martial arts schools (McDojo, Belt-Mills) Turn them out by the hundreds all the time. The fact that there are thousands of styles of martial arts makes it even more complicated. Bottom line is that there is not accurate number.<br>  <br>  <br>  EDIT: <br>  nwohioguy   schools must be a lot better where you live. I moved to Cumming, Georgia in September. Here there are tons of McDojo. Most are ATA TKD. Heck all for there students will get to black belt in no time if they only continue to pay and attend. There are only two classes I've found that are not ATA, Shake-And-Bake/ Black belt schools. One teaches Isshinryu. The other Ed Parker Kenpo. Other than that I'm the only one teaching self-defense that is not watered down.|`|UhPIYoriaa	Black belts, like the belt in general, then probabl a few hundred million or more.  Black belt owners, more than a billion.  Those who deserve a blackbelt, probably a few milllion.|`|cFMFNVj8aa	I would say because of the mc dojos and all the styles that dont use belt rank systems but other things to signafy mastery around 70 million roughly which is not very many people because the world has like 9 billion in it|`|ZiTIghRLaa	I have 2. They are leather and hold my jeans up a treat|`|fRosDAZEaa	Why? Who cares?|`|dc6f042f0a1f241b0647713f95aefc3aaa	Using the old method...100 Million study Karate...1 Million Black Belts (1% make it in real karate dojos)<br>  <br>  Using the modern method considering al the fast track crap schools out there who teach ineffectively 100 Million....5 Million Black Belts (5% which is being modest but I am considering the ones that are somewhat decent for the most part).<br>  <br>  Edit - Pugpaws we do have some of the oldest schools in the US in our area. Robert Bowles and Parker Shelton both have great schools in this area (they are Master Trias' first level black belts). In Indiana we also have Glenn Keeney, Ed Bethea, Dave Foreman, Herb Johnson, Phillip Koepple and more that are direct from Master Trias in traditional Karate. Mcdojos are everywhere up here as well including a lot of garage dojos with unqualified people who it is questionable if they ever really earned a black belt or not but I feel fortunate to have great traditional and authentic people in my area to train with.
ZdpaUoteaa	and what highlights have the gooners had this season....or the one before that and the before that ...and th....ah never mind just google wembley if ya need to see what it looks like!!!|`|QuGTZJIVaa	You've got the Carling Cup Final coming up, in a match you were 2-0 down in and likely to lose, it's understandable.<br>  <br>  Why Aston Villa played so poorly though....?|`|EJAvOHxGaa	Well I'm sure there will be a lot of chavs crying into their beer tonight.|`|FFE9Qztzaa	Actually, I'm happy for my boy, Dos Santos.<br>  Having to score his first goal with the Spurs :)|`|54ef14aee629dde270e28b8db2534f5daa	i am not a spurs fan but i think you have missed the point completely progress in europe means possibly leaving the premier league,so your harry in order to avoid match congestion and conflict is obsessed with spurs staying up in the premiership,he isnt bothered about any cup/yes you are going to wembley to face manchester united(i am no fan of them either)..the whole point of harry,s concentration on staying up is that he gets millions of pounds bonus if spurs dont go down,,its the name of the game,portsmouth erect a statue of your harry and he dumps them and walks away,just as he dumped southampton and went back to portsmouth when he has collected his bonus he will dump spurs just as quickly,with our harry its all "whats in it for me!"<br>  ps Gomez is a total liabilty|`|gjLmhE8Maa	If Harry is given time, He will turn the young ones into very good players,i just feel football fans of today are very impatient and want success now..|`|wurimjbnaa	When you scored the first goal I thought you were going to win.|`|p8lB73rdaa	Tonight meant nothing in the general scheme of things .<br>  Premiership survival is Harry's top priority .<br>  there's also the small matter of a cup final on Sunday .<br>  I know you always want your team to win but if I were you I wouldn't be too concerned about the UEFA.|`|7Tw7s6HSaa	You's did score, look on the brightside, you're going to wembley in the shittest cup competition and that's the highlight of your season

tzrLDbHWaa	Well, first of all, the Falcons don't want him.  Secondly, no team is going to step up and offer him multimillions.  I mean, some teams may be interested, but no one is going to pay him top dollar.  Lets be honest here, he's damaged goods.  Even at his best he was a below average passer but was an amazing athlete and could make plays.  Teams know this and he's going to have to prove himself all over again.  Any team that does take a chance on him also knows they risk pissing off some of their fans as well as animal activist groups.  They're not going to take a chance like that and also commit tons of money to him as well. <br>  <br>  I mean, its not like Vick is coming off a great season or like he's a top draft pick that has lots of upside.  He's a player who hasnt played since 2006 and he's a big question mark.|`|81675c7bcc2aa81478472216e01229f7aa	I'm hoping he is all washed up and if the NFL is SMART - no team will consider taking him!|`|HiuNSScLaa	i know falcons don't want him back the strongest rumor i heard was from john clayton the 49ers might be interested but who cares let the ****** burn in hell|`|H8u7gMAYaa	I think he is going to the Vikings. And of course, he never got in trouble with the NFL besides the dog fighting.|`|l7IdlcHSaa	i do he is a great man  i would love to see play for the rams|`|xfJuyHoeaa	When he does come back (which he certainly will be) he has a good chance to go to the Detroit lions who are struggling to sell tickets and could use some excitement or the Dallas cowboys with Tony Romo always playing hot and cold maybe they would be looking for a new QB who can take them deep into the playoff's or a 2nd string QB not to mention Jerry Jones (The Cowboys owner) Loves to get players who are controversial, always in trouble. And always getting fined.<br>  <br>  But maybe my Buccaneers would be interested in picking him up after cutting Jeff Garcia they might be looking for a QB.<br>  <br>  He could easily go to any team being's he will be very cheap for any team to pick up.<br>  <br>  I think He would be worth it for a Ball club to get him even if he is a bust think about how much excitement he would generate for that team.<br>  <br>  Hopefully he has learned his lesson and had a change of heart about his crimes and will go to inner-city kids to try and change there way of thinking about dog fighting.|`|YFFhkRSdaa	i say the 49ers his old qb coach is now the qb coach there <br>  no tampa bay like mccown, not new Orleans they have brees, raiders r a great possibility, he will get the league minimum the falcons don't want him expect him to be released soon he won't go to the vikings they have tarvaris jackson n will trade for sage rosenfels tommorow the bears don't want him they have kyle orton his best chance to play is san francisco or oakland|`|82Vo9DXCaa	i know some NFL team wants mike vick, if not at qb im sure he'll be able to play some other position, he's an athlete and if he can get back to the level of skill he had before all this happened, he'll be a good edition to some team.|`|bE6MZfxdaa	Chicago Bears Or 49ers mike singelatry was talking about it and he said he wanted to go to bears|`|aG0PtaK4aa	The Eagles could use him as a WR. The vikes, jets, niners, chiefs, and lions all need a QB.|`|bIbyAkHPaa	None. He is done in the NFL. Next........|`|P1I8u7Yvaa	I wish we could get him to play second string behind Drew Brees but if we still had that sorry excuse for a Qb Aaron Brooks I would want him to start but Drew Brees is the truth. Everybody needs to give Mike Vick a break he did what he did and served his time and said that he was sorry there are other players in the league that probably has done something far worst and have not got caught yet so I mean think about it what would jesus do I think that he has forgiven mike vick for what he has done so why can't everybody else I hope that he has gotten his life together and stays out of trouble and that this experience has given him a reality check good luck to Mike Vick and can't wait to see him in his pads again I think he can turn the jets around or stay in the NFC south and go to tampa.<br>  <br>  Lets Go Saints 2009-2010 Season Is Ours<br>  Drew Brees For MVP
EzazmdpZaa	A decade is a long time, but I'd have to say Triple H. Hunter went from being just the leader of D-Generation X to becoming a main event player, one of the 3 top faces of the Attitude Era, leader of Evolution, a Royal Rumble winner, and a 13 time world champ (5-World Heavyweight, 8-WWE). He can be both the top heel and the top face.<br>  <br>  I liked him best in the McMahon-Helmsley Era.|`|xEAYCmqHaa	Edge... 4 WWE Champion Ships and 4 WHC Championships arent much compared to HHH's 6 wwe and 5 whc plus a royal rumple... but Edge has 2 MITB's and 1 King of the ring which is also impressive... keep in mind that he is also the only man to have ever banished the Undertaker with an impressive TLC Win. Plus Edge was in 2 elimination chambers in one night... <br>  <br>  Edge may be a hated individual but I honestly can say that he has a slight "edge" (no pun intended) over each superstar in this list.|`|Ya8Uaf7caa	HHH cuz he's the reason why half the other guys are on this list by feuding with them and doing stables with them. I almost think he's made too much progress from the weak link in DX to the guy who beat the Undertaker after a tombstone.|`|psdgdidtaa	i hate to say it, but i gotta go with randy orton. hes a complete douchebag. but he plays his character so well. and he has a big future ahead of him.|`|1cce3acf3185671cce3210debc8d6a35aa	What about CM Punk?? He hasen't been in WWE long but has won<br>  <br>  ECW title<br>  MITB<br>  World title<br>  Tag team  Titles<br>  IC title<br>  <br>  Just a thought<br>  <br>  Points Baby!!|`|EzHyG66Uaa	John Cena.|`|e7L6cK0Uaa	EDGE|`|6E16tR6xaa	Edge definately!|`|ZbNXVQu7aa	Chris Jericho and Kurt Angle each accomplished much more than you listed.<br>  <br>  If you're a fan of Fozzy and/or don't value IWGP at all, Jericho accomplished the most.  If you're an IWGP fan and/or Fozzy hater, Kurt accomplished the most.<br>  <br>  As for me, I can't choose between them.|`|AA11435718	Chris Jericho should be #1 cause he is #1|`|OHBvEYKHaa	HHH|`|3nN1vTTuaa	I don't want to say it, but the numbers don't lie, it's Triple H.|`|3074it1Qaa	gotta be HHH
ZbNXVQu7aa	At first, I thought Triple H's latest title reign was the greatest injustice of this winter, and I actually kept that thought until I saw this question.<br>  <br>  As long as there isn't ever a 14th world title, there is no greater justice for Triple H than giving him 13 world titles, especially if you believe in the bad luck associated with the number 13.|`|AA11435718	Well look at Edge he has what 8 or 9 an he sucks worst than even Orton|`|wAiQOP0Laa	Yeah, but this is the first time in a while, it makes sense for HHH to be champ, in my book.  The previous 4 reigns were a complete waste, but there was no other way in this case because there didn't seem to be any other way.  The other options at the time were Kozlov (who's not ready), Show (who hasn't been built up enough yet), Taker (who's about to retire) and Jeff Hardy (who's reign didn't work out as well as his fans thought it would because SD's ratings actually went down while he was champion, hence the quick move to Edge in the first place).  HHH was the only available choice.<br>  <br>  Now they need to bring some new blood into the picture.  The WWE is getting about as bad as WCW was before they collapsed.  Not giving the young guys (Morrison, MVP, etc.) the chance to carry a brand, even though they are ready.|`|GExKoh1Gaa	edge =8 championship in 3 years=scum bag,is he sleeping with shane mcmahon?<br>  <br>  triple h return to raw=4.1 cable rating..highest in 2 years<br>  triple h merchandise sells=money for WWE to feed randy orton and legacy|`|313c56ee41b0ac0b7a96bc177ee6784aaa	On his own, Triple H would've captured several of those titles himself.  But the only reason he's got 13 of them is because of his marriage to Stephanie McMahon.|`|dOFVXmV2aa	Of course not he is the most hypocritical in the wwe<br>  ?Why? because is the husband of Sthephanie.|`|k0buVGFvaa	married to a McMahon or not, he is one of the most talented and most technically sound wrestlers in the history of the WWE and is deserving of at least that much. in fact, i wouldn't be surprised if before he retires, he beats flair's record, then they have some big ceremony where ric awards him the title or something|`|9PE90Mzoaa	In all truth, HHH is one of the best wrestlers, physically and on the mike. Some talent has one or the other. But they have limited that are real talents in both. Orton is physically great, but his interviews make me want to vomit. If you want someone to be the face of the company, he should be good enough to interest people. HHH has earned that spot, like him or not.|`|nIzmM8K3aa	What I've heard is that since Triple H is married to the boss' daughter, she can beg her dad to make Triple H better than everyone.|`|DvNZr4TAaa	no. he's only successful because he's married to the boss's daughter|`|w1gL0kiZaa	he's married to steph

AA12034105	Nooo you don't have to pay to go to the practice courts !!!  If you have tickets or a ground pass you're free to roam around as you like haha :P  that includes the practice courts ;)<br>  There's usually a lot of people at the practice courts and a lot of tournaments don't release the practice schedule so you kinda have to go around looking until you find who you want :(<br>  The players normally sign when they leave the practice courts but there's usually a lot of people waiting and pushing when they leave so you have to shove your way to the front haha :P or be first to the exit :P<br>  About the French Open, you don't know when he's gonna play until the order of play is released :(  Usually the top half of the draw plays on the first day but not always so it's kinda impossible to tell lol :(<br>  Haha I sound like a complete expert :P  I'm not really ahaa :P  Too much reading fan experiences on vamosbrigade haha :P|`|vjEv7MWtaa	not sure about the autograph thing, but i think nadal will play on the 1st or 3rd day because he is #1 which is the rank at the top of grand slam brackets. hope i helped!|`|YobE2TRMaa	if any of that doesnt work try ebay|`|6S8KjBLQaa	...stalk them?|`|gP7IB2XCaa	I went to the us open and there was a gate near the practice courts where the fans wait for the players to come out. You are standing there for quite a few hours and you have to wait until they are done to get autographs. Most players sign, but some dont. For example, venus and dementieva didn't sign :(<br>  But I got Nadal, Jankovic, Davydenko, Mauresmo, Roddick, Federer, and a few others...|`|ToZer2Adaa	I got Rafa's, Verdasco's and Nestor's autograph, at the Rogers Cup in Toronto.  You have to go to the practice courts (which everyone there has access to), and wait patiently with other competitve fans. In the end it was all worth it. There was hardly any people asking for Verdasco's autograph, but Rafa's was more of a challenge. I'm still working on Fed's and Novak's. :)|`|DExfjVvOaa	i got nadal's autograph by patiently waiting by the practice court  gate.  i had to squeeze my  way to the front of the barricade, then wait until nadal finishes his practice, then scream hy heart out so he'd know to go by my spot.<br>  <br>  it was in the us open labor day day matches.  i guess i was lucky to find him practicing at the same time i was near the practice courts.  there's a security guard who monitors the number of people who are in the "fans" area.  they dont allow too many people in that area.|`|s7l6oZANaa	i went to the australian open this year and i got a ton of autograph.. all i did was watched the players warm up for there game and or whateva.. and i just wait till they finish they they sign autographs..simple as thatt.. it is really simple except if  theres heaps of people waiting around ((some adults get a bit feral!))|`|SEcM9EDZaa	Show them some "love"...

tzrLDbHWaa	No NFL contract is guarenteed, so yes, it can be terminated.  But here's how contracts work.<br>  <br>  Lets say Vick signs a 7 year 42 million dollar deal with a 28 million signing bonus (just making up easy numbers)  They can set it up so his salaries are 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9 million per year... ie 3 in year 1, 4 in year 2, etc.  So Vick would get the 28 million bonus upon signing, but that doesn't count toward the cap for the original year, its split up evenly.  So the Falcons will actually pay Vick 31 million in the first season (the bonus plus the first year salary) but only 1/7 of the bonus, or 4 million is counted toward their cap number each season.  So, for the Falcons, toward their cap, it counts as 7 million the first season.  The second season Vick would count 8 million, 4 million in prorated bonus money and 4 million in salary, but he only is physically getting paid 4 million dollars.  Make sense?  So Vicks money would be as following, 31, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9 and the Falcons cap number would be as following 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13.<br>  <br>  Now lets say the Falcons decide to release after season 2.  Well, they've paid him 28 mil in bonus and 7 million in salary.  What happens to the rest.  Well Vick doesn't get a dime of it, he's SOL, out of a job, no more paychecks.  So whats the downside you say?  That 28 million bonus.  The Falcons have only claimed 8 million of it on their cap, for his first 2 years.  Next year, they'll be hit with a penalty of 20 million dollars on their cap.  Thats right, they IMMEDIATELY have to claim the remaining pro-rated bonus, the whole thing.  Thats 20 million that they can't use to sign other players.<br>  <br>  So, as a result, some teams would rather pay the man for doing nothing, as it hurts the team less overall than to severely handicap yourself next season with so much of a cap hit.  If they keep him a 3rd year for doing nothing, thats $9 million this year instead of $20 on your cap, and if they release him following that season its only a $16 million hit.  Yeah, they wasted $5 million in salary, but it hurts the team less in the long run.<br>  <br>  NFL salaries are complex, and no other sport really has to do as much finegeling (sp) as the NFL when it comes to their cap.  The numbers I used weren't accurate in terms of Vick's actual contract, nor would a contract really be structured in that exact manner, but using whole numbers makes it easiest to explain.|`|xFfskbjYaa	No, but more thsan likely they will terminate the contract and release him and take the cap penalty of about 6 million or so. There's a penalty for releasing players under contract.|`|NK6AtTWBaa	they can easily termate the contract by cutting him.  if he did get reinstated to the nfl, the falcon would do that right away or else they would have to pay 9 million dollars for their backup quarterback.|`|YFFhkRSdaa	nope he will be cut n get some of the money then he will be signed by a new team for the minimum
HZtcmRr9aa	I think he's trying to do that only in the EPL and not La Liga.  So, I far as I know neither Barcelona nor real madrid would be affected!|`|Wv0UKUdiaa	I would love it, that way the middle table clubs could keep their players and the domination of Real Madrid&Barca wouldn't be so strong anymore!!!<br>  <br>  And I don't agree that Barca would have problems.... Valdes, Puyol, Pique, Iniesta, Xavi, Bojan and 5 foreigners!!!
QuGTZJIVaa	Well if United win the Carling Cup and another team above us in the League wins the FA Cup, we'd be quite happy with 7th mate, but thanks for the vote of confidence!<br>  <br>  Though this flying the flag for England is a little bit daunting!!<br>  <br>  <br>  vvvv believe me mate, manchester City are VERY interested in every competition we enter vvvv|`|exARv7Bmaa	What's the point of allowing English teams into competitions if they are uninterested in trying to win. If I was a sponsor I'd be tsking a long ahrd look at where my money was going. Is this the start of the downfall of over-hyped modern football?  The same goes for the FA Cup....if teams are going to treat it with disrespect, ban them for 5, 10 years.....most of them will come crawling back eventually.|`|A7QROnjLaa	Man City have nothing else top play for (except the relegation battle maybe), so ofcourse they fielded their strongest team.|`|tfotPdeZaa	Sorry mate, everyone was cup-tied. As for Villa the poor guys had no chance. CSKA is much better than them :)|`|oPYw0QYqaa	Im sorry but t say the carling cup is nothing is pretty lame..... Yes if it was the quarters or semis then maybe... But a Final at WEMBLEY is always more important that a european tie that we had already pretty much lost.... And this is our only chance of getting back into europe as we wont through the league and winning the UEFA cup doesn't give you a place next season.... Are you telling me you wouldn't rather be playing a cup final at Wembey this Weekend rather that a league game????|`|p8lB73rdaa	In my opinion both Redknapp and O'Neill were right to field weakened teams .<br>  Spurs have a cup final on Sunday and are fighting for premiership survival .<br>  Villa are on course to finish in the top 4 and have champions league football next season .<br>  Makes sense to me !|`|7Tw7s6HSaa	Total lack of ambition
9PE90Mzoaa	The real point of what you say is that this is a real fight versus a sport. In such manner, you eliminate the points of one- shot kills, such as groin kicks, throat shots etc. You are competing to see who can combat best within a non lethal arena.|`|GpzvrlHdaa	MMA isn't anything even near a real "fight", by which I mean defending against a real attack.  No sport involves defending one's life from attack by possibly lethal means. Mr MMA doesn't have a chance, I would club him with the first thing handy. You are correct to think they are miles apart.  MMA doesn't allow knives or canes either!   .J|`|r5AMG8g7aa	What a joke. The only thing close to real fighting, Is real fighting. Every other style including mma has rules. Real fights have no rules and anything goes.  It does not matter how rough a fight gets if it has rules it is not the real thing. That does not mean that you can't get hurt. It just means that the realism is limited by the rules.|`|OURb1rnTaa	MMA not close. there are gloves, rules, a referee, etc. unless you are in street clothes and your opponent might have a gun, knife, broken glass, hypodermic needles and could be possibly HIV positive, which certainly would not make me thrilled to grapple on concrete with, then it's not. i recall some guy named jim arvenitas (sp) used to teach something called mu tao (martial truth) and it was supposedely the closest thing to a real fight. even bites were okay if it caused a hold to be released.|`|AA10698309	As stated - MMA doesn't train for more lethal shots (throat, groin, etc.) and therefore the MMA fighter does not bother to practice these techniques. Traditional styles (Karate, Taekwondo, etc) incorporate these lethal strikes as common practice. Therefore I feel the more traditionally trained martial artist has an upper hand in a "real fight".|`|UhPIYoriaa	Pugpaws, as usual, is right.  You can't get closeer to real fighting as fighting.  And in a real fight, I doubt you will want to lie down on the ground.  Your best bet is to stand up, incapacitate your opponent(ex:a kick to the knee) and get out of there.
Nldx247Yaa	relax a bit... the more you think about not making turnovers, the more you are going to make them... as a point guard, you're looking for the best decisions for your teammates on the court, you're looking to put them in the best situation to make a high percentage look. you need to stop thinking too much about stats... don't try to do too much, you know what i mean? make the easy passes... smart decisions... easy plays... don't get fancy(only if you do get fancy) cause those decisions easily lead to turnovers...
ESGQtKS0aa	I ski every day and wear a speed suit 9.5/ 10 days. They are the most miserable thing you can wear skiing. I just competed in a downhill today and froze cause it was freezing today (I race FIS and USSA levels). Nastar and high school racing are generally not that intense where you need the extra few tenths. Also, I believe high school racing is only slalom and GS, the events where a suit will matter least. Use the money to get yourself some nice tuning equipment and it will go much further (if you aren't sure how to tune try going online and getting some info, or get an instructional video).|`|lpz8mq5Raa	DUDE! If you aren't going to be skiing in intense, USSA / NHARA official races, don't get a speed suit. However, your high school may be made up of very intense racers. If that is the case and they all have GS Suits, get one. But my official answer is NO.|`|36zm5zK8aa	a lot of people in my high school's league have speed suits, at least the ones on varsity. i would wait it out and see what your league is like, or ask some kids already on the team|`|OrG2fBbKaa	Only if you are racing on a regional J circuit.  For nastar you do not need one except for the regional championships.|`|k1C70y8raa	Well i race ussa and everyone has a suit.  Unless you plan on racing competetively outside of high school racing i think its a waste of money.  not to burst your bubble but getting platinum and gold in nastar isnt that great of an achievment, seeing as they are ranked by average of the age group and there are a lot of bad racers out there.  if your getting a ussa or fis license and want to seriously race then yes, if not, no.
cd51ab07fbecfef33f286305112484c4aa	Whenever your'e good and talented and things seem effortless people will criticize you for whatever they can think up. Nobody playing in the NFL is soft maybe some are tougher than others but none of them are soft. Hope Brady is on the field next season.|`|ULw1777caa	Who said he is soft?  He probably gets his nails done though, maybe thats why.|`|QtjnmEzoaa	I don't like him, but I certainly wouldn't say he's soft. Whoever says that has never torn their ACL before. I can't imagine tearing an ACL + the MCL and maniscus and whatever else he did. And whoever said not even Brett Favre wouldn't play through that... well I'm pretty sure you CAN'T play through that. Unless you want to have your leg amputated as soon as you retire.|`|yuGhmhGuaa	They video taped the other teams defense,and as soon as they couldnt he got messed up. JP Losman could win a superbowl if he knew the other teams defense!|`|JTSNljLhaa	only Brady/Patriots haters say hes soft|`|8jm84S32aa	When the league changed the rules right on the field against the Raiders, just for him.  Tuck rule|`|kzYdVfifaa	No one's calling him soft, he did have HORRIBLE combine results. you can probably find the video. I don't think he's soft. When he takes a hit, he'll get back up. He and Peyton Manning are some of the toughest Quarterbacks to play. But they also hardly hit the ground.|`|kPskVCeJaa	the only reason people say that he is soft is because he is an amazing and gifted football player and he makes the other teams look like crap! and the only people i have ever herd call Brady soft are colt or giant fans. Isn't that a surprise?lol|`|msxGICJvaa	the jet locker room also the bill locker room and i agree with the dolphin locker room|`|H8u7gMAYaa	He is not soft.|`|8mH9j825aa	never heard that he was soft. unfortunate injury to brady. i doubt even favre would play through that|`|jLOCqhckaa	You know where it started...

lryFNKdEaa	if you run a 12.5 100, maybe you shouldnt run with spikes.<br>  <br>  actually leave the lane open and dont run at all.|`|jo9XtOZoaa	It all depends on how you run.<br>  Spikes could even slow some people down.<br>  There is not really a way to measure the time without actually doing it.|`|5rn8OzwAaa	12.4|`|b0SMjRvlaa	The general rule is 0.3 seconds per 100 meters, but can differ based on the weight of your training shoes, weight of your spikes, weight distribution, etc.<br>  <br>  When you run in meets, expect a time around 12.5 seconds anyway, because I'm guessing you're using hand times if you're in running shoes.|`|NK6AtTWBaa	it is different for everyone.  the main thing that they do is give you more traction and give you better flat line speed from the start.  i would say probably near the .2 category, but they feel a lot better on your feet than normal shoes, so i would recomend them.

He will be like a pit bull holding on to a bone.|`|RLQdhFWXaa	Yeah   it will be Matt still be leading in points.   He has too far of a lead.   He does a fairly good job at Las Vegas, so he wont lose that many points if any|`|vIcOdePzaa	I am gonna go out on a very very very long limb and say Matt Kenseth.|`|1IWEKwznaa	Kenseth has a hefty lead in the points right now. If Gordon wins and leads the most laps, Kenseth has to finish something like 22nd to relinquish the points lead to him.|`|3e1ELOgnaa	Kenseth will leave Vegas with the point lead but Gordon will come away with a victory. Look for Kenseth to finish top 5.|`|rxCwaaG4aa	Kenseth will be. With that big of a lead and Kenseth being as consistent as he is, he will be leading for sure.|`|YHYT8qMKaa	I think Jeff Gordon will win the race, but Matt Kenseth will remain the points leader with a top five finish.|`|xTTP2Bv8aa	Kenseth|`|AbDAdrXkaa	Matt Kenseth will probably stay at #1 for a while :)|`|P9wMY4Zpaa	of course it will still be Kenseth.|`|ovMt1MxVaa	Kenseth has an 81 point lead.

VgwXLHl5aa	LOL, leave bluebell alone. <br>  <br>  I've no clue why. It's kind of been a weird thing. I could say it was my da that got me into it but it wasn't because me being a girl he didn't really introduce me intae it. It's hard because i've always been into it. I guess just watching rangers on television and watching my dad and brother cheer at the football.<br>  <br>  Story is i would cheer when ever a football team cheered embarsling that included celtic when i wis young but thankfully i grew and learned they were the dark side, lol<br>  <br>  AYE SO BASIC line is I just grew up around the boys and followed that way instead of following the girls lol|`|AA11097492	See where I grew up?<br>  <br>  No, you can't, because it's a dot on a decent map that just doesn't exist on a bigger scale.<br>  <br>  So I got into football pretty much because there was f'all better to do. Then I started supporting the nearest team... which was Inverness Caledonian (okay, could've gone for Clach, but I've got some pride) so now I've ended up supporting Caley Thistle... which possibly means, at least on some Saturdays, that I don't really support football at all :) <br>  <br>  Bet big Yogi's getting squeaky @rse syndrome now though.

4ca485ab10aead5ea4089df6e7d8f86aaa	I think it would be a lot closer than many people think. Van Damme had a legitimate background in the martial arts, had two inches and twenty pounds on Bruce at his heaviest, had good kicks, and was built like a brick shithouse.<br>  <br>  If he stayed on the outside, he could actually give Bruce a hard time. Not that he'd really have a terrific chance of it should things go longer than about thirty seconds- Bruce's deeper, wider skillset means that he would outdo Van Damme at punching range and especially when grappling, and his speed means that Van Damme is *very* unlikely to be able to keep him at range- but Bruce would likely take a hard kick or two in the course of getting inside...and, having good technique, and being a bigger guy, a hard kick or two gives Van Damme a chance at a fluke victory if he gets it *just* right.<br>  <br>  Still 3:1 or 4:1 Bruce, but not a forgone conclusion.|`|UhPIYoriaa	If both were alive, I think Bruce Lee would win.

5lIEEAUkaa	When I played in little league the teams that have the best batters always won the most games. Most people think defense is more important than offense. To win any game, you need good offense and good hitters. You cant put your team on the scoreboard from defense. Even if you could stop the other team from getting a lot of runs with great defense, if you dont have good batting, its very hard to win. When i played, the good team keeps getting hit after hit and more runs while the bad team is always strikeing out. Is good defense really that much more important than batting and offense? I dont think so.<br>  <br>  The key words there are Little League. If you're talking about MLB, pitching is. No one can pitch in little league.<br>  <br>  Pitching wins Champions.<br>  Josh Beckett in 03?<br>  Johnson/Schilling in 01?<br>  Lackey/KRod in 02?<br>  <br>  And if you're so convinced hitting is better, why are you asking on Yahoo! Answers?<br>  Someone here likes to argue...|`|70aa0db8082ddead46f656ecb978193aaa	Look at who Major League teams stack their line-ups with....<br>  <br>  Are players like A-Rod, Albert Pujols, David Ortiz, Barry Bonds, etc known for their defense?  OK Pujols is a really good First Baseman, but he gets paid mostly for his bat.<br>  <br>  Your everyday players are your batters....enough said.|`|W7BZcdynaa	Pitching and hitting with RISP (Runners In Scoring Position).|`|sBrYcT5daa	The Roids are the most important part in today's baseball.|`|xRPjgGs1aa	50 50|`|1h5RpINNaa	I thought teamwork was the most important part....there is no I in team|`|RCpkdx4haa	You need both, really. It doesn't do any good to score 8 runs a game if your pitchers give up 9. Little League is A LOT different than the major leagues, obviously. In little league, yes, better hitting teams will always win. Kids aren't developed in their mechanics for pitching and fielding, typically because they simply aren't strong enough and coordinated enough. Pitching wins championships, because a good pitcher will get a good hitter out 70% of the time. Look at the SF Giants. They are stacked in pitching but can't get any runs so they don't win. The Yankees were opposite last year. They scored a ton of runs but couldn't make the playoffs. You need both to be successful. But if you get a GREAT pitching staff(think 2001 D-Backs and 2004 Red Sox) you will almost certainly put yourself in a position to win a championship.|`|0MuRCU5paa	Knowing the fundamentals of baseball is the most important part of the game. Every aspect of the game is important, not one is more important than the other.|`|q3bDjWR1aa	Consistency is the most important part of baseball.  With defense running a close second.

ThNC4f1kaa	Well, other than actual BJJ. I go hot yoga and weights.|`|3Z9npp2maa	Stretch alot and work on your anaerobic endurance. That means more sprinting and less jogging.

xqMeSFHzaa	There are many drills and exercises out there. I used to suck as well but I have improved. Try shooting easy layup shots. Ya... this seems pointless and stupid but it helps. Shoot with one arm and simply work on your form. Focus on one point of the room and always shoot at that point. Try shooting with only one hand. You are pretty tall so maybe try playing down low. Most big guys do not shoot well! Practice instead easy rolls, posting up, and other big man moves. Try putting more arch on your shot. I bought and arm sleeve, which really helped, and it kept my arm loose and flexable throughout the game. This drastictly improved my shot. Remeber when Ray Allen's fg% went up in the playoffs after putting on his sleeve? He, like I, and many other players buy our arm sleeve at Custom Sports Sleeves. Hope this helps!|`|eF60R7DPaa	just keep working on it...dont give up|`|xRPjgGs1aa	Try playing with other people.|`|zyrr9Igyaa	Camps, coaches,  and drills will all help you.......also just practice on the form and get the right arc and strength down|`|pfGaMoUeaa	Learn martial arts!

Unless you think its okay to throw passes to your offensive linemen. Intentional grounding would have resulted in a 10 second runoff and finished the game anyways. <br>  <br>  Even if it did get called an incomplete pass... do you really think that's why the cards lost the game? I mean do you think if they had one more play they could have easily thrown a 50 yard TD pass with 0:00 left on the clock with prevent coverage in place?<br>  <br>  Don't get me wrong, I was rooting for the Cardinals.. and was kind of surprised they ruled it a fumble. But the reality is it was not the reason the lost. There was many reasons they lost, mainly the 100 yard interception for a TD to end the first half. That was a 14 point swing! If someone could have just tacked Harrison in those 100 yards of running that could have left the Steelers with 7 points less and a Cardinal win. <br>  <br>  If the Cards were on the 5 yard line on the last play of the game I could understand peoples frustration a little more.. but they were on the 50 and needed a TD. I mean c'mon.|`|AJskIaxgaa	dude seriouslly the season is over.........get over it.|`|tBsMH9kGaa	Steelers won. The ref was on the field he saw it, not you.

They are good.<br>   Sonik are now doing bass, carp and sea rods and July will be bringing out boat roads. If I was getting a new one for sea fishing I would go for a ziplex or grauvel feel good with back bone and a good fight through it. I had a ron thompson rod for carp fishing it was pretty good and it I could use it for light sea fishing max 3 mackerel or good 10lb pollack was fine on the rod.<br>  I am an ugly stick fan a good place to try is www.gerrysfishing.com and www.fishingmegastore.com|`|KJWxqQHiaa	I agree with bassplayer, Ugly Stik's make types for sea fishing, bass fishing, catfishing and everything in between. Just check out cabelas, or bass pro, which ever you prefer ... <br>  <br>  Hope i helped ya out.|`|q8dX0MsNaa	if you happen to like ugly sticks, l'm sure they will have them to meet all your requirements. there are a complete range of these. may just need to check in various outlets to find all of them.|`|VJRqSueSaa	Try willis fishing supplies Bucks|`|yeZgbgzVaa	try a g lonas thats what i use it's kinda expensive but they work fore every thing

WWE 24/7 is crap don't buy it it is not worth it. Youtube is your best bet. There are web sites that sell VHS of entire years of smackdown and raw, but they are expensive. Those are going to be pure with no editing that's why they are so much. If i remember right it is like 100 or 200 a year...IDK if they include PPV's you could check it out just use a little google research.|`|5jIdcbyYaa	lol WWE 24/7 sucks... too much editing.

PvIFahGjaa	No.
9zyJTQxuaa	Size doesn't matter, i belive what your asking is what threads does your gun use. My Ego7 uses Cocker threads meaning my gun (and lots of speedball guns) use this threading but my Shocker (also a speedball gun) uses SFT threading and not using the right threads can screw up your gun.

d274f2ca5d8f175b22b25110ae68203caa	well we were playing against a really tough team, and I went up for the block and got smacked really hard in the face! it sorta hit my eye, and my contact lens popped out!! I played for a little while without my contact, but eventually I had to stop!! I was so mad!|`|jS4UoChZaa	well mine is preety funny(for other peope not me) <br>  <br>  i was blocking with a girl on a team and she went up to block and hitt me right in the nose..<br>  <br>  it started bleeding and i got rushed to the hospital.. i had to get surgery on it and for the rest of the season i had to wear a face mask!!<br>  <br>  it was so embarssing!!|`|t2bMd6TVaa	My experience isn't quite the same, but close enough. I'm a libero, so we get plenty of hard spike balls. One time I was trying to pancake the ball and it popped off my hand and hit me right smack in the face! Oh, and also another time I ran up on the ball too quick and it hit me in the boobs. But, for the most part, I don't get hit very often.|`|PJQ1Nm1Oaa	It's called a 6 pack.  It happens when the blocker gets too high and doesn't put their arms over the net to block, just straight up.  When I was practicing and coaching girls teams, it happened to me a lot.  I am used to playing on a guys net, big difference in height.  I have had the ball hit off the top of my head a lot when trying to block, not too much in the face though.<br>  <br>  What is worse would be getting knocked over when someone hits the ball at you.  I've done that to someone and it was rather funny.|`|N3ioHJwDaa	I took a shot to the face a few times while playing, but the only one that was really bad was once in I think 11th grade when my feet slipped right before I jumped and I didn't get high off the ground.  I was trying to keep from falling and a player on the other team sent the ball right down into my face before I could recover and it made my nose bleed quite a bit.  I ended up having to leave the game for about 5 minutes.|`|AA11825974	Me and my friends were playing around on a soccer field, just goofing around and practicing in a circle bumping to each other, when one person hit a really high one. my friend goes running after it....looking up. then while trying to catch it, she ran smack... right into the metal goal post.|`|ltHslyCeaa	Okay.... a really strong girl on the other team slams the ball down on her spike and nails me square in the face... the impact send me flying back onto my back and I am momentarily "out of it"... not comfortable|`|4gVUNnALaa	This one time in a volleyball game for my school in the cyc championship on game point I was about to go and pass the ball and a really bad player on my team was running at the ball so I punched him in the face and he started to bleed all over, but we won. I was suspended for 2 weeks and never allowed to play sports for that school again|`|orWQYU70aa	no i have not had that happen to me before but let me tell ya its amazing feeling in the world when you block somebody and it goes right back into their faces and they eat it... it really gets your adrenaline pumping....lol....|`|2nw5QWPKaa	once my teammate went up for a block it hit his arm then hit me in the balls.

I love how retro they are, and they remind me of Gretzky back in the day.
6cuZ5WdMaa	because if you love a sport you should want to play it.<br>  and they want kids that don't necessarily do good academically in school can shine in the athletic part.<br>  <br>  i find school sports really fun because you can make new friends.|`|z7JsVzcnaa	I played because they were fun and I like playing team sports.  9 years removed from high school, I still play regularly because it's fun and it's good exercise.|`|zFwjZy53aa	cause they like it, what do you want them to be as lazy as you and sit on the computer all day?|`|3C4zchTNaa	i agree with u altough i dont play sports because im a skater, i used to be in sports when i was like 9 but after all the coaches fighting i just said screw it im going to go skate and thats what ive been doing ever since and so far ive gotten pretty good|`|hEpL5MsWaa	Because some of them don't want to do creative sports and instead just want to play to be popular.|`|48SlX2Yiaa	Schools wouldn't be able to hold games, get new equipment (depending on the sport), or pay coaches if they don't have money.
XuGFt3boaa	With the lineup they have, the Dodgers will be a good lock for the postseason.|`|W7BZcdynaa	if they sign Manny they have a shot. They have a nice lineup, but someone said they have good pitching? Not a chance. The Giants, Diamondbacks, and I'd even take the Rockies pitching over theirs.<br>  <br>  <br>  Billingsley is coming off a 16 win season, but is he really an ace?<br>  Kuroda 6-2 at home, 3-8 on the road<br>  Kershaw- A potential Cy Young candidate, but so is Phil Hughes.<br>  Jason Schmidt- Always hurt, he's done<br>  Claudio Vargas- Released twice last season (Brewers and Mets)<br>  Randy Wolf- He's an ok 3 or good 4.<br>  James Mcdonald- Did well in the minors. Lets see if it translates to wins in the majors.|`|4cJuKxJbaa	If they sign Manny they take the NL West, if they dont get Manny they finish 2nd or 3rd. However even if the make the playoffs they DO NOT have the pitching to make it to the World Series!|`|hNfOgNNBaa	Cubs fans!!!  I got two words for you:<br>  <br>  Steve Bartman!!!!!!|`|AA12040384	I think that will depend on one thing and one thing only: If Manny signs with them.<br>  <br>  Last year after Manny joined the Dodgers they had more runs per game and were a better offensive team,and he was also the main reason as to why they made it to the playoffs(and to the second round).<br>  <br>  So if he does,maybe.<br>  If he doesn't,i wouldn't bet on it,but they would be better with Manny than without.|`|ZyR8ezBwaa	Man, I'm a Cubs fan. They are going to go 0-162, an the Cubs will win the World Series. Go Cubs!!!!!!!!! I hate the Dodgers!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! And the Sox!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! And the Cardinals!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! And the Marlins!!!!!!!!!!!!!!|`|b30195e932765839f31a572f8d05c0f8aa	I would say they have a chance but would have to remove the "pretty good" in front of it.|`|sh01nOWCaa	If they can get manny back. yes the dodgers have a chance. Without manny. no freakin way|`|VAx6qu58aa	DEPENDS IF MANNY SIGNS WITH THE DODGERS OR NOT|`|0BRnovJYaa	they always have a good chance, but they never do.|`|xRPjgGs1aa	7%|`|ONrFDcUTaa	only if they sign manny|`|bke1xKcCaa	The Dodgers by far have the best lineup in the NL West. If they get Manny back, in addition to Either, Furcal, Orlando Hudson and Matt Kemp they will definetly score some runs. Not to mention James Loney and Casey Blake. Their Pitching is a little suspect though.The lost Derek Lowe to FA and Greg Maddux who gave them a combines 405 innings last year. The number 2 starter Huroda has only pitched 183 in his major league career. They should win the West, but are by no means a lock.|`|84ac4d982b7f463269bd6bcc5459e59faa	they will most likely go to the postseason since the nl west sucks, but not the world series, that is up to the yanks, bosox, or rays( if do good)|`|2e8be0d5eae1c47f15b4e984eb812677aa	No they will come close to winning the division with the SF Giants but the Phillies again will win the World Series only because I have lived in Philly for 15 years and watch ing them win last year was incredible|`|tzrLDbHWaa	I think so.  They have a fairly good lineup, will be getting Manny soon, and their pitching is vastly underrated.|`|5xIroQjMaa	With Manny, there's a good shot at the playoffs. The World Series is possible, but it depends more on the pitching than the lineup. The Dodgers are going to be relying on some very young pitchers, who have tremendous talent, but are unproven. (Billingsley, Kershaw, McDonald, Broxton). I think all 4 have a shot at becoming stars, but alot of players with talent don't pan out. So I'm keeping my fingers crossed.
ST6O0oXsaa	Yes. Ellis is having an offseason mainly because of injury. A lot of his teammates are stealing the minutes he used to be getting like Crawford. <br>  I just picked up Chandler and he's rebounding like crazy. Plus Paul is on a tear and wants to prove Chandler should stay and David West should leave.|`|UMVWQiYJaa	nah, ellis should be back in about a week. i wouldnt, unless you need boards and blocks|`|vuh0i3Axaa	no...<br>  <br>  you shouldn't even consider that...|`|BQGHIoIqaa	yes|`|khbLZQHIaa	Haha, are you being serious?<br>  <br>  Tyson is having a down year.  And not only that, Monta gets more points and assists.  He gets a few steals too.<br>  <br>  So, Monta has points, assists, and steals over Tyson's rebounds and blocks.  Monta is better for fantasy.|`|5TPaYv3Vaa	you probably should

wAiQOP0Laa	What you feel is his natural charisma.  I've been on the Swagger bandwagon from the start.  He's probably the first of Vince's pet project (e.g., Batista, Kozlov), that I actually think he got it right on.  He doesn' t have to force you to hate or love Swagger.  He has IT.<br>  However, if they turn him face, like they did with MVP, he'll lose half of it.  He has a natural heel quality about him and it won't really translate to face well.  (Kinda like when they tried to turn Orton face.  Didn't really work that well, except for the women.)<br>  <br>  Just because you like someone doesn't mean that should turn face.  You need to have charismatic heels too.  Too soon to say whether or not he'll be one of the best of all time though.  But he definitely has all the tools.|`|xEAYCmqHaa	Jack Swagger can talk the talk... im just ready for him to walk the walk. He has potential and that is all he has at this point. Once he makes a successful title defense at a PPV against Christian he will earn a little more points in my book. Someday I can easily see him bein an ECW great.|`|d70cc7d2a9ac398c1d3fb0a9cea13ea6aa	he is pushed to quickly<br>  <br>  he would never beat matt, christian, and finlay if it wasnt for the writers<br>  <br>  he still has a lot to prove in my book|`|3nN1vTTuaa	I don't think he is on the path to becoming a face, if anything, they're working him to be even more of a heel.|`|31269476570b3829c86de1e8c487e423aa	he won't be face for at least another year and he looks like a beaver literally|`|AA11435718	He look like a cross between D.D.P an Kennedy|`|EzHyG66Uaa	Me. Aftherall, didn't he beated a sorry Christian Cage Tuesday night?|`|CC3FZj9Caa	he looks wierd|`|oJN0e7dEaa	I ABSOLUTELY LOVE JACK SWAGGER!!!!!!!!!! There's just something about him that I've loved since day one. His in ring style has that unique ammeter esk, his gut wrench powerbomb finisher which I have to give the guy credit for since most peoples finishers tend to be glorified neckbreakers or generally moves that everyone has already seen before. He has the hate to love sense and the cocky smile is excellent, he is simply a complete natural. I REALLY see BIG things in his future...Of courseas long as the WWE use him right.|`|B4RABc3saa	I think they are going to put him on a Kurt Angle/Brock Lesnar route to superstardom. Personally, I like Jack Swagger. He's a solid wrestler, with personality and a lot of upside. <br>  <br>  If he keeps working with excellent workers like Christian and Finlay, he'll develop into something special.|`|nIzmM8K3aa	Personally I don't watch ECW anymore. Although, according to what I've read so far, WWE is intentionally making him a heel so he can feud with Christian (babyface) and eventually Christian will be the new champion. So I'm not a fan of him that much.|`|cf692c4b2ad26ad5a1aad06ef4cfd9c1aa	Jack Swagger will be great. He still needs to work on his charisma however. But hes got the talent. The look and the physique to be a talent mid carder on RAW or Smackdown in the near future.|`|k0buVGFvaa	His definitely has talent, but his mic skills are alittle lacking. given time he has the potential to be great. no rock, stone cold, or ric flair, but great none the less|`|2FKHNIB2aa	I enjoy Swagger while he still needs some practice i think he could go on to be a top maineventer one day, but i don't expect it to happen within the next few years.|`|dcNT65mTaa	If you've watched ECW lately, you wouldn't see a 5 month old rookie in the ring. You'd see a hell of a heel who put on a better performance than most of the WWE. Lisp or no lisp, he will be a main event heel for a very long time.|`|iOICjcZcaa	I think he's great. I love him. In a weird way, he reminds me of Chris Masters. I think he's a heel that you still like because he's cocky but at the same time, he lives up to what he says.<br>  <br>  He's someone who has a natural heel look but can easily gravitate to being a face. I thought Swagger was lame at first, but he's definately caught on with me. He's holding his title well.|`|9Us6XYg8aa	It's funny when Jack Thwagger talks.|`|OHBvEYKHaa	NO I HATE HIM AND ALWAYS WILL !!!!!|`|7WmH2Qeqaa	jack swagger is great, but he needs to stay heel<br>  <br>  at least for now
Y4mz8BShaa	An AEG is not a sniper rifle, and never will be. Full upgraded, it will never be as accurate and powerful as a fully upgraded BAR 10. You can turn one into a good DMR though, at the cost of about $400 in parts.<br>  <br>  I don't know of any rails or rail systems for the G3 or variants, sorry.|`|AA10056762	My buddy has that G3 and claims it as a "sniper" rifle/weapon. It is nowhere close. Yes he gets a little more range than the other AEG's my friends play with but its no where close to where a sniper should be shooting. What you are looking for is a designated marksman's rifle. Unfortunately these cost around $1k and that is with upgrading you do yourself.
21J0IIZbaa	His attitude will hurt the Celtics.  Why would the Celtics play him?|`|7X1H2AfWaa	he wont because he has good stats in every season he played.|`|tzrLDbHWaa	No, he'll help them.  I mean, he's been a cancer on every other team he's played for, but he knows this is probably going to be his only chance to win a title.  <br>  <br>  Also, he'll likely come off the bench as a backup 1 or 2 guard (I know he's a pg, but many pgs, iverson, wade just to name a few, switched to 2 b/c they were ballhogs) and someone who will give some scoring off the bench.|`|2db7f31f8de2a63df2848a630426eea7aa	It's risky.<br>  <br>  But if he gets his act together, and comes of the bench. It might help them out. <br>  <br>  But, it all depends on Marbury. Who knows? Maybe KG will whip him into shape. And possibly make him cry.|`|fc5a2676d0a9ea687d91d44050637158aa	hell nah..<br>  <br>  after last night Rondo turning the ball over in the clutch..he is a welcomed edition!<br>  <br>  They thought the same about Cassel|`|7859db4349d703a0c747d4e81276b851aa	yup he will.|`|F3Z6fzcOaa	no. ainge asked the big three before signing him. hell play back up point. theyll move house to the back up shooting gaurd.  so essentially maurbury is replacing gabe pruitt. take your pick. and if all goes wrong ainge can easily release him. its high reward low risk for the celts|`|k3v9uO6uaa	yes...and way worse than sam cassell style.  Sam cassell had at least some knowledge to want to try and play team ball.  If Marbury likes the street so much...that's where he needs to go play ball.  Stay off the hardwood and go play on the street.|`|9HOXhuaUaa	Yes because if he comes it will decrease Rajon Rondo's minutes and he is a pass first point guard were as Marbury is a scorer plus he has a bad attitude|`|50PfC3OIaa	It would make sense. Almost every team he goes to gets worse.|`|j6R8OC7Vaa	Yes, Sam Cassell style|`|xRPjgGs1aa	Yes
sqfjfR3iaa	That's part of the reason I enjoy Ring of Honor. Ring of Honor brought wrestlers from Dragon Gate to the shows in Orlando, Florida wrestlemania XXIV and will bring wrestlers from Pro Wrestling NOAH to Houston for shows wrestlemania XXV Week.|`|uUDHEFrSaa	I've been trying to pass something like that for wwe for a long time, like dragon gate invasion nto WWE or TNA, or WWE into NOAH

Just like there are black-only colleges, women only gyms- if you and your buddies want to pony up 10mil apiece and build your own golf course and say only blond people under 25 can play, you can do it.  <br>  <br>  But does it really matter?  If a person has the money to pay for exclusivity and that's what they want, why shouldn't they have it?  I wholeheartedly agree that when it comes to public courses, everyone should be allowed to play regardless of sex, race, religion or even skill level.  But, I also agree that a private cub that is financially self-sufficient has the right to include or exclude based upon their own criteria.  That's freedom, whether it's 1809 or 2009.<br>  <br>  Butler National told the PGA Tour and the WGA to go pound sand and take the Western Open elsewhere because they have a no-female policy, and the no-female policy is still in effect at Augusta National- the members there told the protesters to go pound sand, and they broadcast the Masters for 2 years without any sponsors, just on their own nickel, and did just fine.|`|gAhHCpRNaa	im not sure about this but i think cypress might frown upon it. i heard a story that michael jordan wanted to play but he needed a member to play with him and nobody wanted to play. dont know if its true though.|`|KKh8rikGaa	1)  I'm with hubris, <br>  <br>  2)  so whats that got to do with Tiger

Last year the whole Lakers team struggled against the Celtics and Thibedeau showed himself to be a "defensive genius".  <br>  <br>  But when the Lakers win- the haters don't give Kobe any credit and say will why didn't he achieve this or that.  Oh he scored 61 but it was against the Knicks, oh 81 was against the Raptors, 63 in 3 quarters was against the Mavericks, oh what a ball hog (when he shoots a high percentage when he does that)... just pointing out that if you want to take away credit from him when the Lakers lose- he should receive credit when the Lakers win.<br>  <br>  The Lakers should make the finals and whoever they play it should be one heck of a series.  Losing 4-2 (with one game where they blew a 20 something point lead) i wouldn't call getting "whooped" that series could have easily gone the distance!

BRTa5h7iaa	There's two methods to get more consistency. Practice and spin. <br>  <br>  Practice will improve your consistency in everything. If you hit a forehand over and over and over again, you'll be able to hit that shot under pressure over and over and over again. Same with a serve.<br>  <br>  Spin. If you have ever played some type of video game or something of the sort, there are times when you have like 5 points or 10 points or something like that to distribute between a few categories. Let's say you have 10 points. You're limited between the options power and spin. You have to decide which you need more at that particular moment. For first serves, I would say 8 into power. For second serves, about 9 in spin.|`|f1UYyl3Qaa	Learn a topspin serve, its a bit advanced, but the topspin will make the ball dive into the service box. SO you can hit it as hard as you like. <br>  <br>  Other than that i would just look at form. Try to learn the form for a serve, preferably topspin but you can try any serve you want. Make sure you use your legs.|`|Wjp0niEhaa	Get a serving lesson from an instructor.  Ask him/her to specifically work on your serve.  Then just practice it often.  Once you learn the right serving motion, expect to hit about 3000 of them before you ingrain it into your muscle memory. To really improve your serve, it takes a lot of hard work, on your own.  Its boring and tiring to serve for 30-60 minutes at a time, but thats what it takes to really improve such a complex shot.  Good luck!|`|8qH5q7TGaa	practice makes perfect

mCTmari9aa	As simple as this... Billingsley is an ace and Joba wont pitch more than 150 innings. Joba is the fifth starter in the yankees rotation and could even be moved to the pen. Chad is the one that can improve if the dodgers get a full season of Manny Ramirez.|`|FMuEJ6Tuaa	billingsley cuz he strikes out more ppl and hes consistent<br>  and cuz joba is injury proned|`|9f7c3a6b1c85a2b25fdaadcc6f4cc32aaa	Both are young and dynamic pitchers with tremendous upside but the clear winner in this one has to be Billingsly. He has never had health problems and has an established role as a top of the rotation pitcher in LA where he has proven his abilities. Joba has the same kind of potential but he also does not have an established spot either in the rotation or even the pen for that matter. Right now he is just a great arm waiting on opportunity. And he has had a couple of arm flairups....love the upside but you must go with the proven guy if both are young. Keep Billingsley and reap the rewards....he was a 16 game winner last year with 201 Ks and a 3.14 ERA, those are the numbers you expect of a young stud pitcher. He doesnt turn 25 until the middle of the season so no fears of him suddenly losing his "stuff".|`|AA10263761	As a yankee fan im not sure joba can stay healthy<br>  Chad can so go with chad<br>  Though the upside with joba is un matched

I have no clue what other possible way you can do. Here it is:(It will be hard to explain)<br>  <br>  1) Put on The Sock Like Normal. With the Velcro already attached at the front, make that velcro stickk/attach to the velcro on your shorts. (Pull the sock up so that it sticks kinda close to the bottom of the velcro already attached)<br>  <br>  2Flip out the remaining velcro already attached and if its on your right leg, point it towards the right. (vice versa for left/other leg) Then, with the loose velcro attach it to the already attached velcro and the other end attach it to the velcro at the back of your shorts. Then Tape it with some clear tape (i dont like tape on my thighs but its just so that the velcro wont get stuck when putting on your pants and come undone so you can put it on as loose as you want)<br>  <br>  Hope It wasnt too Hard To REad!

13bc7214bebe9f20a8000b9480b7b9d7aa	For speedball a tippmann is not a great idea and smartparts has turned to some shady business practices (they say that their professional teams use their Ions stock and that Ions are tournament level markers, and they are, if you replace all of the guts, besides, they melt resin into the board so you cant upgrade it.) -sorry, rant.<br>  <br>  For under $450, I would go with a Dangerous Power G3, which will run somewhere around $300.  This marker is incredibly light, and instead of a normal switch trip system for the trigger, it uses eyes, like in the chambering of the marker to detect balls.  This means that if you can find the sweet spot on one, which, from experience, I have found easy to do, you can put out an exceptionally high rate of fire.|`|9zyJTQxuaa	Hey there,<br>  Are you in the GTA?

xOReEw6Waa	The RCBS kits at Cabela's are certainly worth the price as opposed to buying separate. The Rock Chucker single stage press is stouter than the Pardner press, but the Pardner is adequate for single stage rifle and pistol reloading. If you reload for pistols however the progressive turrent presses are a better,faster (more expensive) option. The kits will have the scale,press,powder measure,maual,case lube pad and various minor parts. You will need to buy the specific die sets for the calibers you are loading for, a case trimmer or caliber specific trimmers that Lee makes (very inexpensive), the bullets,primers and powder you plan to use. You will eventually need a brass tumbler also. All told you can spend close to $500 for the reloading equipment to get you started, but the better quality equipment will last several lifefimes of use. <br>  The Lee reloading kits will get you started reloading and then you can upgrade as wanted/needed. The Lee kits are much more economical and do function, but there is a decidedly better feel to the RCBS and REDDING, or Hornady products that cost much more. With the Lee kits you could probably get reloading for $200-$300 and still be making a good round. <br>  For shotguns the reloading advantages aren't as great as for rifles or pistols, since the cost of cheap shotgun shells offsets reloading investments in time and equipment. The cost and processes for reloading shot shells is similar to rifles.<br>  <br>  The advantage to reloading for rifle is in better accuracy,barrel tuning and Cartridge Oveall Length control.

Then clinch down, pressing your forearms against the sides of his face. Pull him down hard, and put your leg back as far as possible, and drive your knee into his face. If you can, get a rythm and switch to the left and to the right, and keep driving those knees up and clinching him down hard.<br>  <br>  Gotta be fast. its called the clinch. It works.

Wait for him to attack then attack him while hes vounerable after he misses. If he does. Street fights almost always end up on the ground so be ready for that. If you want to win, punch him as hard as u can in the jaw it'll knock him out. Remember not to pull your punches, when you attack... pretend you're pundhing 3 to 4 inches behind the target. For example, if you punch his jaw attack the back of his head not literally though. The point is to follow through with the punch for optimal power. But once you reach that point, pull the punch back or you're exposed to a strike.|`|2342825964248c03e3b4b0af44b00b59aa	First; you can't learn to fight in just one night.  That is unrealistic so you need to consider avoiding the situation.  Secondly you say yourself that the kid is overly aggressive, experienced, and spazy.  Sounds like a bully or bully with some mental problems.  People like that are dangerous to everyone and should be avoided.  Definitely let teachers and the principal know about the situation.  You may want to see if any of the other people this guy has victimized are willing to go with you to talk to the principal about this situation also.  You can also try to form an alliance with them and help cover each others back when this person is around as there is safety in numbers to some extent.  Try not to be caught unawares and unprepared by this person and if caught don't hesitate and don't fight fair.  There are no rules in a fight and if you can give a good account of yourself or kick his butt then he may leave you alone.  On the other hand it can also escalate things to a higher, more serious level so try to avoid it and the situation first.  Kicks to the groin, fingers jabbed into an eye, elbows, knees, biting as well as punching are all on the table if he corners you or pushes it and don't hesitate to use them and don't wait to use them if cornered.  Sadly this is a situation that many kids have to put up with and so you may want to consider enrolling in a boxing or fighting gym or a martial arts program to better know and understand how to deal with these situations in the future.  Most, if not all the instructors in this forum have some students that are enrolled just because of this type of situation.|`|8e92840faf3c865ae5b9e2addd58c913aa	I know you don't want to hear this, but you can't win.<br>  DON'T SHOW UP!

tJoxT0EXaa	Well, go to bed at a decent time, first-off, you can't swim as well if you haven't had a full night's sleep.  Eat lots of carbs for slow burning energy tomorrow. <br>  When I coached summer leagues for kids I'd always have them get really relaxed the night before.  Overstressing can play a huge factor in your swimming and your times.  Do some light stretches before you go to bed, clear your mind. <br>  In the morning, really concentrate on your movements esp. during fly on your warm-ups.  Do a few sprints, don't tire yourself out.  Make sure you are recovering fully from your arms on fly.  Really concentrate on your entry, make sure your arms are pushing down really hard when you are pressing down on your stroke.  Vision you are making a very powerful almost "Key shape" under the water.  Focus.  If you are confident in your stroke and are focused you will swim your fastest. 1:09 is a good time on your fly, be proud of it. 1:06 can happen! <br>  As far as breast, I have always worked on not breathing every time I surface.  You legally have to surface after every kick, but I have noticed it takes more time to actually take a breath each time.  Breath every other time you surface, it can actually shave off a second or two.  Also make sure you have a very nice streamline coming off the block and a very decent underwater pull.  Push off as hard as you can  from the wall after your turn (you already know  that) but make sure you are getting a good distance, about 12m before actually surfacing from your underwater pull.  This is critical.  <br>  Wind down with an ipod between events, don't stress.  Have fun. <br>  If you can, a few minutes before your event, go to the locker room and take a 2 minute hot shower, it'll loosen up your muscles, they constrict when they are cold.  Keep warm between events. <br>  GOOD LUCK! Let me know how it goes.|`|u2riBZGIaa	for breaststroke: eye down under and above water, reach full extension, send forward, finish your kick, use mini pull.<br>  <br>  good luck!|`|BE5HlQseaa	that's really good. on breaststroke, focus on shooting your hands out and gliding with your kick not like a frog and make sure you are doing it legal and don't eat anything too heavy or you will be slow. im a swimmer too. good luck
z7JsVzcnaa	If you want to play attack or offensive midi, you have to have good stick skills.  If you can't throw and catch well with both hands, you won't get a lot of time on the field.<br>  <br>  Flat out speed works more to a midfielder's advantage while quickness is more advantageous for attack.

Sure you can have fun doing it (driving fast) but it's a long way from that to making any money at it.  You will spend tens of thousands of dollars before that happens.  The difference between an amateur driver that thinks they are good and a professional driver that *is* good is more than most people realize.<br>  <br>  You could start with either karting or SCCA.  Neither will pay any money.  Karting will run you $5000+ and SCCA maybe twice that, to get started with a kart/car, then of course tires and parts and fuel and getting to the track and back . . . it's a long road.  Once you've established yourself well enough (win some championships) then you may be able to land some sponsorship or a ride with a pro team.  But that won't happen unless you know (or learn quickly) how to drive and I don't mean driving street cars fast but high performance (race car) driving, something everybody thinks they know how to do but most find out otherwise when they actually compete against someone that really does.
Wu0XyNspaa	Well, it depends on what system you're playing.  I have my team playing a 5-1 (1 setter, 5 hitters).  And you always match up your best left side and middle player with the setter (let's mark them with a *)<br>  <br>  <br>  4    3*    2<br>  <br>  5*   6     1<br>  <br>  So if 4 is your setter, your best hitters are going to be 5 and 3.  That way, most times you'll have 1 good hitter in the front row.  So that means that they should stay on, and then 2, 6, and 1 can get subbed in and out.<br>  <br>  I guess you could also do this with passing to.  Or, just hide the worst passer and pass with a 4-man or 3-man serve receive.|`|5bzJUmh4aa	I'm assuming this is true beginner level and that you don't play positions or do any switching?

It would be nice to see them with a better team, but I guess Leaf fans love hockey whether they win or lose.  Toronto fans are a strange bunch, but they just seem to stick with the team no matter what.  I sure don't like to see the increase but I'll still go watch them, I'm just a sucker for punishment.

If it is as bad as that pitch then any Test standard opening quick bowler would be dangerous. <br>  <br>  Obviously the faster and more accurate the more dangerous they would be, but although Courtney Walsh and Curtly Ambrose were no longer at their fastest by then, they were still lethal on that pitch.<br>  <br>  Worst would be an opening pair like Trueman and Statham, Marshall and Holding, Lillee and Thompson, Wasim and Waqar, because then it would be relentless from both ends.|`|3MoVd4xVaa	Malinga the slinger and Shane Bond.....I would stand a foot outside leg, close my eyes, swing and hope for no bouncers|`|IDBasYahaa	The scariest bowler according to interviews I've seen is Jeff Thompson. The 160km/h that he was recorded bowling at was not his top speed. His speed was recorded in the early 80's with all the fastest bowlers at the time, there was no batsman, they were bowling in a nets situation with a speed gun at the other end. In an interview about 15 years ago he said "A lot of the guys didn't think I could bowl accurately without a batsman to aim at, so I bowled a little slower to make sure I wasn't way off the stumps".<br>  <br>  If you look at footage of him bowling in the West Indies in the late 70's, he had West Indian batsmen scared to come out to bat. A mathematics expert worked out the speed of the balls that were being bowled from the amount of time it took the ball to travel from one end of the pitch to the other. The ball speed leaving Jeff Thompsons hand was 168km/h. However, this can't be used an an official speed because it wasn't recorded with an accurate & official speed gun.|`|AA11088802	i just consider ur q<br>  <br>  Holding and imran

aIhVHfMUaa	well i havent seen much of the guy, so my opinion is kind of limited, but the fact that he isnt making many 100s but a lot of 50s tells me the problem isnt in his batting, the problem is between his ears.<br>  <br>  if your good enough to pass 50 on a regular basis at test level, then there is no reason why you cant make 100s, i think he just need to get that one big score and everything will be fine for him again, however if there is a fault with his game, as Boycott points out about his hook shot, then he must get in the nets and work on it and fix the problem, especially if he wants to make big scores in countries like Australia and South Africa that generally have harder, bouncier wickets<br>  <br>  as for being vice captain, i'm not sure if that was the right move for someone so young, BUT he hasnt been VC for long (i think lol) so i think we have to give him more of a chance<br>  <br>  why is it tho, that this question is getting answers about India when it has nothing to do with them?<br>  <br>  EDIT: Very in depth there Oracale, you make a very good point as regarding 1st & 2nd innings scores, but there are odd occaisions when there is more pressure on you in the second dig cos you need to save the match for you side. if we look into that in depth, it may well give us yet another set of stats that may help us|`|AA11557440	Better him making 50's that insignificant scores. Its just a minor blip as Strauss said it appears to be a mental stumbling block currently, Once he gets one I'm sure the tons will begin to flow. <br>  <br>  As for the hook shot. Maybe one he should avoid.<br>  <br>  Just out of interest who would open if not Cook? There doesn't seem to be an abundance of contenders.|`|mZ2Uluioaa	England is a below average cricket team and i don't think any kind of evaluation further is going to help them. These evaluations are good when it is a marginal case but they are way behind lagging other teams by a big margin~<br>  <br>  hope this helps~<br>  god bless~|`|e9KQ4keYaa	England is not a good team, so it doesn't matter~|`|YULPhBBHaa	Give him a chance. He'll come back and amaze you|`|AA11088802	yes ! his conversion rate is not as good as other gr8 players.... he should concentrate more|`|Leoc8rlGaa	It's probably worth pointing out a few things that make a crucial difference between Messrs Bell and Cook. Over the last 12 months, Ian Bell has played in 13 Tests, scoring 708 runs at an average of 35.40, including 2 centuries. Alastair Cook has played 16 Tests in the last 12 months, totalling 967 runs at 37.19, and a top score of 94.  But the key difference is when the runs were scored. In the first innings, Bell has recorded 531 runs at 37.92, and in the second, 289 runs at 41.28. Cook has scored 616 runs at 41.06 in the first innings, and 351 at 31.90 in the second.<br>  <br>  This demonstrates that whilst there records may appear to be very similar, Bell's problems stem more from a lack of mental ability to grind out an innings, and he is more likely to perform better when the pressure is off. Cook has been struggling for form, but his ability to tough it out in the first innings, when runs are crucial, are the reason he retains his place. Yes, he is struggling with the hook shot. He has been around the international circuit for a few years now, so bowling attacks have worked him out. He needs to learn to adapt his game. The next twelve months are crucial to Cook's career. He must learn from his mistakes, and take his game to the next level. That is something Bell has failed to do: he is a classier looking batsman than Cook, but Cook has greater mental strength. <br>  <br>  I wouldn't say Cook's career is going backwards. He has plateaued of late, but the signs are that he is coming out of his slump. All players go through it at some stage of their career. It is how they deal with it that determines whether they continue as a Test player. Bell has consistently failed to improve. Cook has the appearance of a man who is trying.
DO7nz8aRaa	Yeah they should USA dosn't care about football while mexicans love it if they played in mexico the stadiums would be full|`|Cpm25Pekaa	The main reason is business.<br>  Remember this - "MONEY TALKS, BULLSHlT WALKS."<br>  <br>  But it would be great, and there should be a rule that when there is international friendlies. A FMF team should only use players age under 24 (mexican players). Except Pretemporada friendlies.<br>  <br>  And memmer I never say nothing bad about the best of Mexico. <br>  <br>  ARRIBA EL AMERICA|`|82fd54d1c65455ed9c17232b1e7b390baa	My dad says that the EPL has so skill of touch and the players are just ones that mess up alot. He prefers La Liga and Italian A teams better to play with. I like the EPL and I think it just won't be good for them to come to Mexico..|`|x9UgZbyVaa	EPL teams dont want to get paid in pesos...they want dollares!!!!! Not that they need them....when chivas opens their new stadium they are gonna have a little tournament and there are talks about a big european twam playing a friendly with chivas for the enaguration|`|pSOmwwlIaa	Well it's their decision to choose. I think it's because in the US it's safer than Mexico. Maybe the weather too. Maybe they made a deal with the US.|`|TXUTwLLOaa	Honestly I dont think Mexican teams are interested in playing EPL teams. Why you may ask? The answer revolves around MONEY, DINERO, MULA, $ or whatever you want to call it..... Because it would not benefit the Mexican teams to play a team that most likely isnt interested in playing Chivas, America, or any team they havent even heard of thus they wont take the game serious and wont try as hard. It would be a waste of money for Mexican teams to have EPL teams play friendlies in Mexico. <br>  <br>  Dont get me wrong, it would be nice to have top world teams come and play, but the games would probably be boring because there is nothing in stake. If they did come, their first priority would be AVOIDING INJURIES.<br>  <br>  ****Im sure Chivas and America ARE teams Europeans have heard about, BUT THATS IT. They dont care about Mexican teams. <br>  For example: Lets say that you always watch the sports channel. Every day you watch, they talk about teams on that show. They always talk about the favorite teams too like Man U, Barcelona, Inter, etc.... But they also talk about unkown teams from I dont know, lets say Saudi Arabia (sorry Saudi Arabians... Nothing personal, just using as an expample).... Ok you always hear about them and they are teams you know cause you hear about them all the time on the show but you dont care about them, I mean why should you, our league is way better than theirs.... See what im saying? Thats how EPL teams feel about Chivas or America. They will respect all Mexican teams because that is the professional thing to do, but they wont take them serious.<br>  <br>  And thats what I meant when I made that previous comment about being unknown teams.|`|7Xridrxaaa	yeah but european teams would rather get payed in Dollars than pesos and the EPL isnt that big in Mexico. La Liga is what Mexicans tend to identify themselves more with|`|CeiIz1Vbaa	Its because the usa admires England and their soccer, so they pay large amount of money to brin ELP teams. Which Mexico doesnt do, and they just stay in Latin America|`|wKnjGSU1aa	I wouldn't care about EPL teams, we've had teams like Real Madrid, Atletico Madrid, Barcelona, Boca Juniors, and other teams like that come and play friendlies in Mexico. It's probably just that the USSF has a good relationship with the English FA, that's why English teams come to U.S.A. Just like Mexico has a very good relationship with the Spanish FA and the AFA from Argentina. It's just on relations with a certain organization.<br>  <br>  Chivas And America not recognized? The Mexican league is broadcasted in parts of Europe, most known in Spain. You honestly think the world doesn't know Chivas or America? Come on now.|`|6uc8ROfWaa	yes they should it would also bring a lot of money 2 them|`|I5FsYmjIaa	That would be badazz|`|qbPbvLuLaa	It's all about the $$$
G9LSZQcaaa	Yes|`|9Us6XYg8aa	I agree.<br>  Orton deserves a REALLY LONG title reign.|`|0mg4OBcMaa	I dont think Orton's title reign was all that bad.  He beat HHH clean to win the title, beat HBK clean at Survivor Series, beat Hardy clean at Royal Rumble, proved how much of a chicken-**** heel he could be vs Cena at No Way Out and won clean at Wrestlemania.  He was booked pretty strongly as he won all those matches cleanly even though he is a heel.  I only think that one heel will win at Mania, and I dont think they are going to make both of the current champs reigns look worthless.  Plus I think the moment of having the top face in the company (Cena) hold up the World Heavyweight Title at Wrestlemania 25 as it goes off the air, createst a moment for this Mania.  Another point would be that, for all intensive purposes, Orton should lose.  Most fans pull for the faces to win the matches, and having HHH lose this match, after trying to avenge his wife, father-in-law and brother-in-law, does not satisfy a large number of the fans.<br>  <br>  Orton should win, but sadly, he will not.  I think that both champions will retain, or both faces will win.

Brady is an average QB in a great system.|`|U3KAgO0baa	I'm sick and tired of Tom Brady, He is a top 10 QB of all time, But Come on ! The guy is NOT Jesus!|`|LRczZ1Niaa	no i love TOM BRADY!!!|`|bIbyAkHPaa	Yes. We should all make a pact to block all the Brady/Pats* cultists<br>  <br>  I'd rather listen to whining Longhorns fans !|`|RS3fjNboaa	Yeah, it's worse than listening to Luke's millions of excuses as to why OU loses bowl games.|`|yuGhmhGuaa	No , what really makes me sad is they haven't put a asterisk next to the Patriots cheating Superbowl victories|`|39de4d27076c334630a8108a6bb9b519aa	It's O.K. if you guys are jealous about the 2nd greatest QB of the generation (behind only Peyton) whose legacy obviously trumps the 2008-2009 version of Trent Dilfer (AKA Big Ben).|`|AA12179372	No, what makes me mad is when 40 people ask the same question on the same subject, like currently the Vick thing is going on|`|SMX228Olaa	Well when a star QB gets injured they are usually going to talk about him..........|`|8mH9j825aa	yea cuz it means the bandwagon patriots fans are back.
RS3fjNboaa	Quincy Carter. He really sucked ***.|`|ntLUHiTAaa	College i would say former south carolina QB dandrell pinkins <br>  Nfl il go with Gus Ferotte|`|fz0Aw3hLaa	Ryan Leaf, hands down.|`|YJIivf2Haa	Ryan Leaf no contest biggest bust ever.|`|geih5vR8aa	Isn't Ryan Leaf the biggest bust ever?|`|QjO3m7QKaa	Ryan Leaf. He was a horrible QB AND a bust.|`|bIbyAkHPaa	Rich Campbell. He was the starter over me in High School (Santa Teresa in San Jose)because he was 6'5" and could throw 65 yards. He went on to Cal where he broke Steve Bartkowski's and Craig Morton's records. He got drafted high by the Packers. He got into one game where he threw 5 picks in one half! He quickly disappeared.|`|ZyR8ezBwaa	Rex Grossman from the Chicago Bears. I love the Bears and I know he took them to the Super Bowl, but he was garbage. I know he had a strong arm, but still. If he was trying to throw a simple pass, he would bomb it five miles the other way. His accuracy is horrible.|`|SMX228Olaa	Probably Ryan Leaf considering how people said he was going to be one of the greatest ever, and he was drafted in the first round.|`|z6pdWKa5aa	Ryan Leaf, Rex Grossman and Quincy Carter. Another guy shall join this list... Mark Sanchez! He's not ready for the NFL, 1 starting season at USC. He will be a huge bust.|`|VAx6qu58aa	KOY DETMER AND MIKE MCMAHON|`|KLU2fp1Haa	koy detmer..he blew!
7Xiz8iwPaa	I don't know where you live, but i played USTA regional tournament in central all the time in high school. As for calls, you do have to make your own and hope that your oppenent is a gentleman. I never had many problems because most tennis players are pretty respectful. If you have a problem, you can request the for the tournament director to watch your match for a few games and make the calls. It is very casual though, they are ran by local players and can be unorganized. <br>  <br>  In terms of the levels, a level three player is very intermediate. A level three player is someone who is classified as: You are fairly consistent when hitting medium-paced shots, but are not comfortable with all strokes and lack execution when trying for directional control, depth, or power. Your most common doubles formation is one-up, one-back. I got this information from the USTA website that breaks down the levels. If you have some tennis experience, you can keep up with most level three players.<br>  <br>  Hope this was helpful!
rseD4OG2aa	I think Jeff Hardy's, even though both were good. Jeff only recently became a true main event guy, even though he's been around for over a decade now. 2008 was really his year, despite the fact that he won the WWE championship right at the end of it.<br>  For pretty much all of 2008, Jeff really became one of, if not the, most popular superstars in the WWE, and that really speaks to his main event push. Think about it, how many other guys with two substance suspensions on their records get the WWE Championship? Especially if they aren't already a main event guy. The fact that Jeff was able to earn Vince's trust back and not lose the fans respect (well, most of the fans) speaks volumes about him and the type of performer he is.<br>  I really liked Jeff's feud with Triple H. I'm not a Triple H by any means, but I thought that the running program they had, with all of the great promos and matches, was fantastic. The only thing that I would change would have been for Triple H to put Jeff over cleanly. That would have been a perfect touch. Still though, I enjoyed it thoroughly. The whole "Jeff can't do it" storyline was really neat, and what made it so special was that I really didn't know if Jeff would ever win the WWE title.<br>  <br>  Edge is one of the best in the business, and for sure Money in the Bank was a terrific way to really vault him into main event status. When him and Lita came out at New Year's Revolution after John Cena had retained the WWE title after that Elimination Chamber match...That was spectacular. I love his "Ultimate Opportunist" gimmick, although I think it gets overused sometimes. <br>  The way that he made himself credible on Smackdown by cashing in Kennedy's MITB and beating The Undertaker after his cage match with Batista was great as well.<br>  <br>  Oh, and this is to Christian: The Saviour: What do you mean Edge didn't need drugs? He was suspended just over a year for drug use.|`|EzazmdpZaa	Whenever Jeff's in the title picture, the fans explode every time his music plays. For example back at the end of 2007/beginning of 2008, Hardy built up so much hype that it actually seemed impossible for him to lose to Randy Orton. The same happened at the end of last year during his many title shots.|`|caczNImxaa	jeff jeff jeff jeff jeff jeff jeff<br>  <br>  <br>  and jeff|`|L3MkAG6Qaa	Edge. Why? Because he was smart with his. He didn't need drugs, he didn't need high risk, and he didn't need to be a fan favorite (the exact opposite, and he still is wanted in the main event for every PPV). Not only that, but Jeff was about to get the push of a lifetime (like, the one he's getting now). What did he do? He went to TNA.<br>  <br>  So in my opinion, it's a no-brainer. Edge.<br>  <br>  BQ - Edge. People will get Jeff winning every match the same way and his boring mic skills.|`|xEAYCmqHaa	Edge... dont take it personally if you are a Hardy fan but Edge is so much more fun to watch than Jeff......<br>  <br>  I think Edge will have a longer reign because Adam Copeland is chill with WWE... while Jeff Hardy (dont know his out of ring name) is still fighting a real but strong drug addiction|`|E7TkNO00aa	Edge, he has Vickie Guerrero to back him up every time.|`|IMu3wBu8aa	Jeff's was more of an interesting story. I've been his fan since his debut. To see how far he has come and to see all that he has beaten to get there...well, it's great to see him finally become WWE Champ. It was a roller coaster ride, a long one. It was such a relief when the ref hit the 3 count! We all knew Edge would make it into the Main Event status. Jeff, was questionable after all that happened. I always had a feeling he would make it though. :) Edge's was also fun to watch, but Jeff's had a bit more action so-to-speak.<br>  <br>  BQ: I assume Edge. I hope Jeff gets more title shots though. I hope he holds the WWE Title again.
s6Vj6puHaa	First, thanks for Ellington, he is playing very well for us. Second ￡3 Million for Rob Earnshaw, hardly played a game, hardly scored and now he has moved to our arch rivals Nottingham Forest and is scoring in just about every match|`|xMEuz7otaa	Juan Sebastian Veron was a big waste of money.  I think Man United paid something around 28mil for him.  Once he moved to England his career just went down hill, I don't think he was suited to the style of play.  He was much better in Italy.|`|HVQvj72taa	Chelsea:<br>  Andriy Shevchenko|`|qDBeG26Saa	for american football<br>  the packers got a first round draft pick and paid him big bucks and he didnt start for 3 years and wont|`|HV9BICTxaa	Beattie at Everton.

ajkMt6gRaa	I like golf, but in some areas of the country ( dallas is where I am ) it seems almost like a inconvenience to even try to play.  I joined a private club and that didn't even help all that much.  <br>  <br>  I enjoy the game, but almost curse the increase in play ... and honestly I don't knwo why some people even play.  I'm a low handicapper and sometimes can't understand the attraction for the higher handicapper.  I guess I can see this as a possible frustration for you ... but maybe it's your type ... the stubborn that "suck" ( no offense ) that get in my way that bug me ??  Just my thoughts.|`|FWsv3Schaa	I love golf. its my favorite sport. if i am not out on the course, i am either at the range or practicing my swing in my basement. Its such a great sport and although its frustrating i love it and want to play in college.|`|z58NVkOnaa	For me, to be able to play a round of golf, is like getting away on a vacation.  For a few hours, nothing else exists except the visualization of the next shot.  All the stress of the week melts away as soon as I approach the golf course...from there, it is a fantastic adventure...<br>  <br>  As far as playing more the worse you get...I believe that the more you play the more your body understands what needs to be done, and your desire to do better is what is stopping you...try taking a couple of notches down from your amp'd up game of enthusiasm...by, just relaxing and swing with the flow of the gradual breeze, you will soon find out that there is a game within your swing...then, the enjoyment will soon develop...I envy you...I've been playing for a few years, but, to go through what your going through, is like a Marine revisiting Boot Camp again.  Enjoy the many mistakes of the moment...look at it as a test of your character...do you lose your temper? frustration and the blame game?  once, you overcome this, you will indeed be a better golfer & a person overall.|`|21XwrcP9aa	I absoulutely love it. Especially the times when i break 80. I am 15 years old and only have been playing for a year and 4 months. As for the worsening of your game. Your thinking to hard bro. Play how you know and get a couple lessons. The best advice that i got and when i started playing good golf was when someone told me " keep your eyes behind the ball'. It all clicked in my head from that point on and i started shooting consitantly low 80s|`|jTHJhy2laa	I used to think of golf as a good walk ruined.But as I got better at it I really began to enjoy it.I live three blocks from a decent course and I play it at least three times a week,weather permitting.I just wish they had an indoor golf facility in the area for the winter months when the snow is flying.

UhPIYoriaa	Real ones do, the ones that you see are too dull and poorly made to work.<br>  <br>  To answer how, here is an answer from ehow:<br>  The primary use of ninja claws is climbing. They are used the same way a cat uses its claws. When climbing a tree, the ninja claws dig into the bark giving the climber a foothold on what otherwise would be a smooth tree. When climbing walls, the ninja claws grip bricks, stones or other cracks to provide a hold that would be much more difficult with fingers. Ninja claws provide a climbing advantage when trying to mount any barrier or obstacle.|`|3DnX9NmAaa	They're called shuko. We don't only use them for climbing. They're also used as weapons. Very nice when you want to rip someone's throat out. The hooks dig into whatever your climbing or clawing.

BoO62GMJaa	i too find myself on the horns of a dilemma<br>  when my feet are up on sunday afternoon and am holding my can of lager, which of the two combatants do i wish to lose?|`|El7C2JsMaa	listen to the first answer, they are the only person talking any sense!<br>  <br>  The first priority is to make sure you stay in the league (make no mistake you are by no means safe!) after that its to maintain European football for next season and the best chance they have of doing that is winning the Carling Cup, putting out the strongest team available may have got you through the next round but you would then have more games which could hinder your chance at Premier League survival!<br>  <br>  I'm afraid it is you who are small minded, Harry is only looking at the bigger picture, its all about survival if you don't have any distractions in the shape of the UEFA Cup you can then concentrate on survival and if by some chance you actually win the Carling Cup you will have European football next season as well as the opportunity to fulfill your potential in the Premiership instead of falling into the Championship!|`|tfotPdeZaa	Gee, U must not be a real spurs fan because for your information sunday is a priority so that next year we can play in Europe, when we have good players available and not cup tied. And we will win the Carling Cup :) Also Harry couldn't field his best team because a. defoe is injured<br>  b. pav, keano, etc. cup tied c. modric is rested for Sunday. d. bent - bleh. <br>  Harry should be given a chance.<br>  <br>  Edit: my god you people are hopeless! HE HAD TO PUT THE SECOND TEAM! EVERYONE WAS CUP TIED OR BEING RESTED!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!... Everyone who says what you guys are saying are not real fans because you have no idea what you are talking about.|`|SIKuOevVaa	Redknapp is small-minded? Then he's a perfect fit for Spurs.|`|kRHXcsX7aa	well said ...its a disgrace putting out a 2nd string team in the uefa cup ....who the hell does he think he is...the fans dont want to see that.....and yes man u will win on sunday so we will see harrys face than when hes out of everything and fighting for his life to stay in the league.|`|A7QROnjLaa	The first guy had it right.

Dirk is more of a shooter/scorer only not so much on the defensive side of things.|`|tA5DrAPpaa	Tough question, Dirk Nowitzki has been able to get Dallas to 50+ for like 5 strait years, and even led the Mavs to a 67 win campaign.  And for the record, in the 2006 finals, 2007 first round match-up with the Warriors, and last year's match-up with the Hornets, Dirk was the only guy playing.<br>  <br>  KG was never able to get the T-Wolves anywhere except for the 2004 season when KG won MVP, but in the conference finals, they had to go up against a Lakers team that was literally the western conference allstar team during the late 90's.  But last year, KG took the Celtics all the way.<br>  <br>  Anyways, my pick is KG since he has been able to take a team over the hump.|`|GERlmBIUaa	Dirk cuz he has the height of a big man yet the shot of a guard... best answer plz|`|o6KAdVUSaa	Kevin "KG BIG TICKET" GARNETT<br>  <br>  dirk sucks hes an ASHLOCK|`|ur1bnkrZaa	dirk nowiski<br>  <br>  only cause he doesnt sport the green and white|`|AA12126447	Kevin Garnett|`|EKF2HdZKaa	KG<br>  cause of defense and better use of paint|`|fZ38PPgSaa	kg|`|Nldx247Yaa	KG<br>  he really knows how to lead a team and he really knows how to motivate his teammates... idk, i think if the two were put head to head in a championship game, KG would step up and make the smarter decisions, make the bigger plays, and just outplay dirk any day. just look at how big of a difference he's made on the celtics. can you say the same about dirk who's been on the same team for how long now with no rings??|`|5757a7039a02b4eab455cc05b9d7d636aa	KG has WAY better defense and good at dunking and shooting.

UhPIYoriaa	Do you have the link?  I need to see it to see how they did it.  But most likely a gimmick.|`|XFZmAMOAaa	CGI is cool,isn't it.|`|S0N3BRecaa	I saw a Wing Chun master (Scott Baker) take a whole section of the sunday paper and do the same thing but not with a punch, just striking it with the tips of his fingers and the paper didn't split in half. It exploded. As you can tell by my name and some of the posts i've done, i'm one of the most skeptical people on the planet but i was there when he did it. It was simply amazing.|`|1Z5r6h22aa	They did this on myth busters. It is possible for something as blunt as the hand to cut paper in half like that, but the human body cannot generate, nor withstand the force required for this to happen. The speed that the hand would need to generate the cutting action would tear apart the arm, because the hand is so blunt. This video is a fake. As for doing it with a pencil, I would say the same thing because the more blunt the object, the greater amount of force and speed it would need to accomplish the cut. That's why it's easy for a sword, and difficult for the hand.|`|8e92840faf3c865ae5b9e2addd58c913aa	Many of these types of feats are fake.  There are people out there that claim to be able to knock out someone without even touching them.<br>  <br>  Think about it for a while.

dcNT65mTaa	Although he's greedy in that he always wants a title, he seems to be satisfied as long as he has a title. He could ask for a rematch just like cena's asking for his rematch, but I doubt he'd really wanna fight a Triple H who's out for blood right now. He picks and chooses where he strikes where it'll benefit him most.|`|6E16tR6xaa	Doesnt need one, he's already got a title.|`|G9LSZQcaaa	Dont you mean John Cena?

qhTxeSnbaa	I hope so. IDK how likely it is, but there is a chance.|`|mJvZhdAuaa	Well, according to WWE, Ric Flair has 16 world titles to his name, Triple H has 13, and Edge has 8.  When you think that Edge has been with the company for 11 years, that he is 35 years old, and that he has at least 5 to 10 years left of his career, it it very possible.  Remember, he could even make it to be a 10 time world champion before SummerSlam.  Really, it's if WWE want's him to have that many, but with all of this time left for him, it's very possible, and maybe likely.|`|T13xM9iJaa	I wouldn't want it to happened but if it dose I would want TripleH to do it|`|Gr7My8FTaa	nooooo|`|3o8jPdWQaa	I really hope not that would be a upset|`|InX5Pfl5aa	I hope not.

Without seeing you, it's impossible to see what is going wrong. 31 isn't so incredibly old (I'm much older), so don't blame your age. <br>  <br>  My best advice is to find another instructor. People don't always "click," and it seems that whomever you've worked with in the past hasn't been able to convey to you certain basic principles (for example, you should be struggling so hard).<br>  <br>  You might consider tracking down a Masters Swimming program. They are geared toward adults. Some programs are very accomodating to beginners.

Also check out your local community pool and/or community classes. It may be that you are having a hard time because your body is unfamiliar with the motions and practice makes ... well better.

IWM1khX7aa	1. Lionel Messi (21 years old)- Best player in the world, has great ball control, speed and skill. He's going to better and should be the best player in the 2010 World Cup. He's already performing better than Diego Maradona.<br>  <br>  2. Francesc Fabregas (21 years old)- One of the best center midfielders in the world (when he's not injured). Already has a great field vision and leader. Will become one of the greatest center midfielders of our time.<br>  <br>  3. Sergio Ramos (22 years old)- Just like Fabregas. Already doing good in his position. Will become one of greatest right backs of our time.<br>  <br>  4. Alexandre Pato (19 years old)- Already excelling at a young age and should be a favoirte for the 2014 World Cup in Brazil<br>  <br>  5. Karim Benzema (21 years old)- In the footsteps of Zidane and has potential to be like him or Thierry Henry.<br>  <br>  6. Sergio Aguero (20 years old)- A great center forward, but he will be in the shadows of Messi.<br>  <br>  7. Diego (23 years old)- Almost 24, however, a great playmaker and very underrated since he is at Werder Bremen. <br>  <br>  8. Wayne Rooney (23 years old)- If he performs better, he could be England's top striker.<br>  <br>  9. Gonzalo Higuain (21 years old)- Already doing well at Real Madrid. Can be better than expected and he can be the full time striker for Argentina and Real Madrid.<br>  <br>  10.

NBi07o6zaa	yasss!|`|Tz5Q8uc5aa	I LOVE to swim at the beach.<br>  <br>  There's so much to do and so much to see its much more interesting than a boring pool full of chlorine and chemicals.<br>  <br>  The salt water feels so healing and rejuvenating every time I go in. Plus it heals quickly and has a lot of beneficial health connections. Its really good exercise to swim to begin with, and even funner running across the beach and looking for crabs and fish. The shells and rocks never bother me and I always always swim barefoot.<br>  <br>  It's even funner when you go tubing or jet skiing or play around on a water trampoline.<br>  <br>  In my opinion, everything about the beach is fun, especially swimming :D|`|QBQ7l7kYaa	love it i love the sand between my toes. the water  is really healing and there are all the cool fish and sand dollars not to mention HOTT guys then the breeze is almost heavenly no it is definatly heavenly. there are also guys there. then there are all the little crabs that have little pinchers on them ohh and then there is jetskiing and tubing and skim boarding. surfing .knee boarding. water skiing and like a billion things more. i love the beach i could live there. ohh wait i pretty much do lol oh one more thing there are guys with no shirts on|`|2UlIbjMUaa	no...i personally don't like swimming that much in the beach...just because of all the sharp shells in it, and i guess i'm kinda a little scared to go that far into it..probably because of currents...|`|e0Dj4Lejaa	No. It feels dirty, is crowded, cold, and you can't see anything. Plus it stings your eyes, and salt crusts on your skin. And you can taste the salt, whether you want to or not. <br>  <br>  And sharks. :)|`|yuGhmhGuaa	No it freaks me out
jSk6PjAPaa	I gotta say the new lebrons are great they are hot too but nike hyperdunks is what i have and the are great. some great aspects of the hyperdunks are the lightness the color schemes and the awesomness any nike basketball shoes are good.

1pytM8lgaa	Hi, I know that there are certain exercises that you can do everyday to improve your height. One of those is moving your both arms in a circular motion, hanging in a bar, both your hands holding on the bar and letting your body weight pulled by gravity.<br>  <br>  Well, I hope this helps, aside from taking growth hormones. There are more exercises that you can actually do aside from those that I have mentioned.|`|5Xmbd6RVaa	There is nothing you can really do to make yourself taller.

sy3zZA76aa	It really only depends on you and how you play. Some can practice forever and still not make the team and some can practice for a bit and make the team easily.  It depends on you but what i would suggest is to practice with people a bit better than you and a bit taller than you.  If your going for state tryouts, they're are bound to be taller players than you and coaches love to choose taller more talented players.  practicing against them will help your game improve and it will teach you how to play against taller more athletic people.|`|ZSAVHC84aa	25 hours a day, you need to literally freeze time for an hour to add an extra hour onto the day.

D1beU6MPaa	This race has drawn twelve entries with some of the fastest three-year-old horses in the country.

VTN4Qun9aa	Hate to say it, but Chris and PhoSho are mistaken.  To be honest, I'm not sure about the difference between cut and released (I'm also not sure if there even is a difference), but I know that if a player is waived, then other teams have the option to pick up his contract within a set period of time and continue to pay out the the rest of his contract.  If the player is cut, then any other team who wants to sign him has to negotiate a brand new contract with him.<br>  <br>  If a player is waived and another team picks him up off of waivers, then his old team has no obligation to pay him anything, not even guaranteed money.  His new team does all the paying.  If a player is waived and no other team picks him up within the time limit or if a player is cut or released, his original team is still responsible for paying him his guaranteed money, even if he eventually signs a new contract with another team.  The old team doesn't have to pay him anything besides guaranteed money though.<br>  <br>  If a player is waived and a team picks him up off of waivers, his old team has his salary cap impact completely erased.  If he's not picked up within the time limit after being waived, his guaranteed money still counts against the old team's salary cap.<br>  <br>  However, don't take these terms too seriously because they are all used very interchangeably by the sports media.|`|YeCOOzq6aa	ok when your cut its when you try out and you dont make the team when you are released is when you are on the team and they dont want you anymore and waived is when they lower your salary|`|wbIEau0qaa	if you are trying out for the team, they can cut you<br>  <br>  if you are on the roster, they can release you<br>  if you are making more money than your team thinks youre worth, they can waive your salary|`|goe3y4FPaa	IF U GET CUT IT MEANS U TOTALLY SUCK...

Ct0DRr5maa	it's not the carp eating the meat off the hook, in my opinion.  i would bet that it's bluegill, perch, or catfish nibbling the bait off the rig.  i have caught small white perch while fishing with huge chunks of chicken liver.  they just peck away and when you swing you get em sometime.  i've also caught tiny bluegill and bass using hotdogs for catfish bait.  stick to bread, corn, or boilies, or go after the carp with a fly.|`|5FVyVS9vaa	Eat the meat and use the bread. Meat comes of the hook with not much of a hit.|`|AlCfnJKYaa	I'm afraid you've been given some duff advice here. Hair rigging luncheon meat is dead easy. The only thing you need to do is use a longer than usual boilie stop below the meat to stop the hair pulling out. Obviously if you are trying to cast to the horizon it can pull out, but for a medium distance cast it works just fine.<br>  <br>  To make life even easier, this product is brilliant. <br>  <a href="http://www.chapang.co.uk/view.php?module=products&productID=1391" rel="nofollow">http://www.chapang.co.uk/view.php?module...</a>|`|EaBRGlLAaa	I guess you're in the U.K so don't be worrying about Bluegills and catfish , or using treble hooks with luncheon meat. If you want to fish it on a hair rig first pass the hair through a short length of rig tube then through the luncheon meat this will help stop the hair cutting the meat.<br>   Or prepare the meat at home by cutting it into the size pieces you want for bait and frying it ,also try flavouring it with curry powder, don't laugh it works .|`|KJWxqQHiaa	This is funny because, my dad and me crack jokes all the time bout fishing with Spam, HAHA. (We always bring it up when talking about how hard liver is to stay on the hook, and he has this story about slinging the bait off of the hook and hitting a women across from him LMAO) But, i would use a treble hook, and let the hook be visible next time, then see what happens.<br>  <br>  Hope i helped ya out.|`|KDNWFuZWaa	My friend has used cheese and onion crisps before crushed up in a tube and it worked but his best which horrified me and slightly embarrassed me too, was female pubic hair, apparently the scent works great. <br>  Bread I know works well, tightly packed around your hook, you could also get bloodworm and pack it in a tube with some brine shrimp.|`|q8dX0MsNaa	l'm surprised you can even cast it particularly with a hair rig. l would use the bread from my sandwiches for the bait and eat the spam myself. bread can be rolled into a tight ball and works well. stays on good too.|`|IVxuz1Anaa	Try to get an old pair of women's hose or pantyhose ,put the scent bait in a small square of the hose and tie a knot in it .don't worry about the hook showing .Liver and all the soft baits work well like this .good fishing .|`|PwB9aDiNaa	i think fishing with luncheon meat in for two year olds who came to a lake to feed the fish|`|ZvwinVnYaa	crayfish? just a thought.

yvpfphQNaa	A thick heavy rope right?<br>  You can use your feet and legs to your advantage here, as the rope won't bend out so much away from your legs as it would if it were light. Whilst hanging from the rope, bend your legs and turn them out sideways so that you can grip the rope between your feet. Then extend your legs to gain height and move your hands up. Then bend your legs again and grip the rope with your feet.<br>  <br>  Other method could be gripping the rope between your thighs, this is less dynamic though.<br>  <br>  Or just go through with upper body strength, but that's the hardest.

Y4mz8BShaa	If you plan on using it, go ahead. The M234 isn't that good of quality, though If you want the bolt action because you want to be like what you've seen in the media...don't. It's terribly different. ******' Hollywood..|`|AA10056762	Airsoft pro is lying to you...in order to get a BB to travel that far. You would need an upgraded spring...in which the M324 can't handle or support. Unless you buy EdGI ( <a href="http://www.edgicustom-usa.com/#m324_upgrades" rel="nofollow">http://www.edgicustom-usa.com/#m324_upgr...</a> ) I really would stay away from that rifle. Its stock performance is advertised as a nice 400 w/ .2's. Thats not going to get you far in the sniper world. An AEG can easily out-power you as they can shoot around 350fps with a bit less range. If you like your AEG...stick with it...chances are you will hate sniping.|`|zKMvdGruaa	UTG M324 is a great sniper rifle, I use to have one before I sold it, it was a gen 2 (Gen 1 and 2 were horrid but Gen 3 were a pretty nice improvment), and the gen 3's came out. I bought one of the kits that converted Gen 2s to 3s and it worked pretty fine. I added a DBC Custom 6.01mm  and a Laylax Hard buck to it and it actually increased the range and groupings. (I could make shots at 280 Feet 8/10 and I am quite the bad sniper)I also foamed in the stock to reduce the noise, although that didn't work as well as other people said. However, I really dislike how people just love to start sniping. Sniping is extremely boring, it usually requires a spotter to optimize saftey and the use of eyes. However, a good thing about sniping in airsoft is that you won't really EVER need to adjust your Windage, making sniping a WHOLE lot easier. Basically what I am trying to say is, unless you know what sniping is about don't do it and that a sniper rifle should never be left stock.

sy3zZA76aa	Okay i had the same problem as you, and in tennis too. But the way to get over it is to calm down.  When your practicing, you practice when nobody is there and its only you and maybe a friend, no pressure.  So when your trying out, you have come with that same mentality.  You have to play as if it were you and your friend, and dont get mad cause you didnt play right, it only makes it worse.  I made the team because i actually learned how to calm down and single everybody out.<br>  <br>  Hope it helps

9f7c3a6b1c85a2b25fdaadcc6f4cc32aaa	Without seeing him hit it would only be speculation by anybody to offer advice but here are some thoughts on possible problems. You mention he has a good eye and makes contact so the issue is clearly with some element of his swing. It could be that he "drags" the bat through the hitting zone, meaning he doesnt get "on top" of the bat at contact. Assuming he is right handed (just the opposite affect in any ides if he is left handed) the idea is for his right wrist to roll over the bat at impact. If he has his right palm up on contact that is the problem, a simple drill where he turns over the right hand in the center of his swing will add plenty of "pop" to the bat. Another possible problem, he "steps out" too soon. This simply means he doesnt stay square at impact and the hips get through the hitting zone before the bat and the front foot moves out before contact. Often widening his stance will help with that issue, it forces him to stay in balance longer making opening up more difficult. Another possible issue, he isnt extending his arms all the way. Could be he stands too close to the plate. If the arms arent fully extended it slows the bat speed and bat speed is a major element to driving the ball. Have him stand as far from the Tee as possible and still make contact with his feet staying on the round (no standing on toes or balls of foot) .  Finally it may be that he see's the ball well but still lifts his head off the pitch at the last split second, have him keep his head down on the ball all the way through the swing. He may be inclined to lift early to see where the ball is going, after he learns to keep his head down he will learn soon enough to get a "feel" for where the contact will guide the ball and will easily enough pick up the ball after full contact is complete. There are other elements but these are the most common mistakes of the young hitter....the mere fact he can see the ball and make regular contact suggests he needs a minor fix and will hit well. Contact is the most difficult element to achieve, once that is accomplished everything else is easy to adjust. So watch him swing and keep in mind the suggestions, dont jump around with the ideas, keep him working on one fix at a time. If it isnt the right fix it is easier to move on one element at a time rather than mess him up with multiple moves at once.|`|5vXgcAbCaa	Well, holding the bat tighter is the last thing that you want to have him do. Make his swing as short as possible. It would've been easier if we could know how he swings, but I'll just tell you what I know. Trust me, this stuff works. I went from being the worst hitter on the team one year to batting .525 the next season. Make sure he isn't holding the head of the bat behind his head. Make sure that is bat is at least even with his back shoulder. It will make the bat quicker to the plate. It sounds like he may be dropping his hands and swinging up on the ball. Make sure that he is bringing the bat straight from his shoulder to the ball. Don't let him take large steps either. Big steps change eye level and can turn a line drive into a weak pop up or a little dribbler. He shouldn't be swinging for the fences, that can change the swing and make the contact worse. Put however much power behind it as he needs, but not too much. Keep his head down and sure it does nothing but follow the ball. His head should stay down even after he swings. His head should start on one shoulder and end on the other. It's better to take the step a little early. My coaches called it "load and explode". Take the step and bring your hands back, then start swinging when the pitcher is releasing the ball. I hope this helps, I know it helped me. Good luck to your son.|`|ZX1nU9Vzaa	I wouldn't have him hit off a tee.  He needs to practice hitting real pitches, maybe you could take him to batting cages.  The idea is to make contact and hit the ball on a line.  His swing needs to be level, no upper-cut or downward chop.|`|UO3QU2yeaa	Try having him hold the bat with a tighter grip and swinging hard but not hard enough that he pulls a muscle in his arm/shoulder. (happend to me) make sure his bat isnt wobbly when he holds it up to swing. try pitching to to him slower and maybe he will get a better feel for hitting it farther. when he starts to get it try pitching faster. <br>  <br>  Hope this helps!|`|928f2e24b815567aa3bd1713a6c25333aa	( **Great answer "vipohockey4" **)<br>  <br>  This is not a problem at all. At 8 years old, he is still developing the muscles and tendons necessary to bring the bat through the zone with the speed and "snap" that he and you want.  <br>  <br>  I umpire a LOT of games for this age every spring and summer, as well as some coaching. For his tryout, what the coaches will be looking for the most is what he already has... defense and pitching.  They'll also look at overall hustle and  attitude. When it comes to hitting, they want to see CONTACT and they love to see that he doesn't swing at bad pitches.  Anything else to do with hitting the ball better and sharper they will work with him on.  That's their job, and when they start working with him and watching him they will definitely any little hitches or problems and help him adjust.<br>  ----  Grounder? Does he trot or does he buts his butt trying to beat it out? Pop fly? Does he drop his bat in disgust and just meander to first, or is he already halfway to second when the ball drops in a glove or on the ground?<br>  <br>  He should also have a comfortable bat, not too heavy, with the fattest barrell allowed. When he's at the tee, tell to practice a few in "slow motion". He should be turning his hips into the swing with the upper body following (maybe record a a game or two of his favorite team or player and slo-mo their swings if your DVD or VHS player will do it) and his head, nose, and eyes down on the ball all the way in...<br>  <br>  Lastly, and if he's serious, not necessarily a last resort, rent or buy a DVD (Google up "baseball hitting dvd youth"... Dave Altopp has a good series) and just follow what they say.<br>  <br>  Remind him and yourself, that a major leaguer will play 7 games a week, and get 6-8 hits out of 25-30 at bats... and they'll call him an All-Star!  (If every player got a hit every time, that would be a LOOONG game!) One day very soon, all of his practice is going to pay off, and he's going to come through for his team in a BIG way!  Best of Luck!|`|b4mDpU4faa	dont worry dude 8 year olds are just beginning trust me i have been there the way my dad told me was to check which eye i can see better with because im a natural righty (of course isn't everyone almost righthanded) but when i tryed to bat lefty i was doing good but that was when i just started batting lefty now im really good batting lefthanded and now im a switch hitter. If he can see equal with both sides than just keep your eye on the ball. also hold the bat tighter and if it is to heavy than try putting your hands a little higher from where he usally puts it. that way the bat isn't to heavy.

r5AMG8g7aa	Strengthening your wrist may be helpful. I do not suggest you do any conditioning of your knuckles. It is risky and will not make your punches necessarily any better.|`|UhPIYoriaa	I don;t think you should do it on rope.  Try sand first(fill up a bucket with sand, then punch straight down into it).

Some leagues allow you to play both as long as you don't play against the same team.  Best thing to do is ask your coach what the rules are.|`|zkzXmcgXaa	Yes. You can not play both games fully. You can only play one game combined. For example: in basketball if you play 3 quarters of jv, you can only play 1 quarter of varsity.

YHQgtP3paa	It should stretch well over the body, being tight everywhere, such that it would not cause any rubbing or chaffing. Lol. (:|`|zmhQdYbDaa	Everything should be tight. For a practice one-piece suit, you should try to take the straps and stretch them up. At their greatest extent, they should reach the bottom of your earlobes. If they reach above that level then the suit is too big. If it's really really hard to get it to the bottom of your earlobes it's too small.|`|YSa3Mdz3aa	It depends on what you are going to use the suit for. If the purpose is leisure i.e. lounging by a hotel pool, it should be comfortable. If the purpose of the suit is for competitive swimming or workouts it should be tight because the tighter the suit the less water resistance. It should be so tight that you have a little trouble getting into the suit initally because it will stretch as you wear it. Although many people train in an extra, baggy suit on top of another suit to increase water resistance (this is a good use for saggy worn out suits). You should not be wearing a bra when you try on suits but panties are kinda req for hygene/health reasons.

4j7rodV2aa	First answer is wrong....Tiger's driver is NOT available in stores. It's purely a prototype. Don't necessarily know the difference, probably the size of the club as Tiger's not a maxed out driver guy as he still likes the workability of the smaller heads. It may come out in the stores soon, but per almost every golf publication..Golfworld/Golfweek, etc...it's a prototype.<br>  <br>  Cink's driver DID eventually make it to retail. It was priced at $599 when it came out. It did come out MUCH later than the release of the "regular" 5900. The only difference was it had a hugher grade shaft and a CG location closer to the face for a little more workability.<br>  <br>  Callaway is planning on coming out w/ a "tour" hosel later on in the spring in lieu of the s2h2 set up. Read that in Golfworld that came in mail today.<br>  <br>  I think the companies will eventually release an almost identical version out on the market, but these pros make their livings with these tools and they tinker (and have the financial means to do so) more than us hackers ever will, so we'll probably never see an exact model at retail....but lots of hackers will always plop down the dough to get a "tour level" model as equipment is sometimes more mental and how it makes you feel, than it is physically how it performs...so if Phil's set up makes you feel confident over the ball...some will be willing to pay the higher cost for the warm & fuzzy feeling.|`|AA11648664	this driver is for sale check out nikegolf.com to view them. this is Nike's new line and it features the rotating shaft for different type of shots. I have seen them and hit them. infact in the new orleans area they the nike rep is going to different courses for the weekend with the tour fit van.|`|WiIUEObTaa	yes they will be available to the public. already are united states. tour editions from all manufactures have drooped from 460 cc . in the 400 to 425. the clubs on tour are very expensive. with to days economy. there will not be many put out for public consumers. for advanced golfers only. best story guy Arkansas broke wilson driver mid 90s. this club was tour pros only. wilson was going nuts when club was returned by consumer. they were not for sale. turned out john Daley had given away 40 plus of these clubs to his friends pro am partners. harder to believe average golfer caved one in. Daley did not. the year was 1993. they are not the most forgiving clubs. to call these models limited edition would not be a stretch. have no idea why the young man above received thumbs down for correct answer.

When Tony Romo was hurt, the Cowboys would have been better off lining up in the wildcat formation for three games; just giving Marion Barner direct snaps.<br>  <br>  Whoever they get as backup QB will be an improvement.|`|63e6fbd5b85357a27d660c7d5c0b9ee9aa	Chicago will have on heck of a party at 11:01 when Rex "Gross"man is officially a free agent and i hope he goes to a team we play so we can give the hits he deserves|`|U3KAgO0baa	Me ahd the Boyz Takin off work 2marrow, Spendin the HOLE weekend watchin tha ticker!|`|fiaFQAWWaa	Dude, you need to get out more!|`|VBUKAw21aa	I plan to celebrate with a luxiours bubble bath with candles and soft piano music in the background and then i will eat a very amazing dinner at la petite house of peanut butter and jelly (probably strawberry not sure yet) GET A LIFE!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!|`|wODPXdU6aa	praying that the panthers will eventually get peppers. even if he already got franchised.|`|QtjnmEzoaa	Hoping somehow Albert Haynesworth can find it in his heart to play in Indy, even if they can't afford to pay him as much as other teams.

UrNVuFx6aa	Depending on the power of your air rifle they can be better or worse. With a powerful air rifle they are a good choice for hunting and target shooting. They will be slower because of their weight but they pack a punch when they get to the target. In hunting this is a necessity, in target shooting it the extra weight really doesn't help. Of course, each rifle shoots a little differently with different pellets. Try some of them in your rifle and see how they perform for you. That will be the final determining factor. If they don't work well in your rifle you probably will not like them.<br>  <br>  Enjoy your shooting and stay safe.|`|4mb6xaxBaa	THEY USE TO BE ONE OF THE BEST, WHEN THEY WERE MADE IN JAPAN, BUT QUALITY HAS GONE DOWN IN THE LAST FEW YEARS AND THE LAST TIN I BOUGHT WAS NOT GOOD, JUST AVERAGE.

I think he likes being the quarterback of the Dallas Cowboys just for the prestige that comes with the position.  Not one other starting quarterback in the NFL would go to mexico with a girl (no matter how attractive she is) the week before a 2nd round playoff game.  NOT ONE!  He likes partying and having a good time better than preparing to be great.  It's a shame too, because I do think he's got the talent to be big time.|`|215646253ac5e0903ab28bc43e031fd3aa	Ha ha ha.....<br>  <br>  That is Funny !<br>  <br>  NO way, no how...never ever never|`|AA10425091	no way|`|lPDHMOVZaa	Absa-balla-lutely!

SEcM9EDZaa	A pitcher is in the windup when, with the ball, the pitcher stands on or directly in front of the pitching rubber, located at the top of the mound, with his feet pointing toward home plate. Prior to throwing a pitch, the pitcher has the option of taking one step back toward second base or to either side, using his free leg (left leg for a right-handed pitcher). During the delivery of the pitch, the pitcher must take one step forward, in the direction of home plate.<br>  A pitcher is in the set when, with the ball, he stands on, or directly in front of—and touching—the pitching rubber, with his toes pointing toward the side (toward third base for a right-handed pitcher) and his arms apart at his sides. This initial part of the set is called the stretch, because the pitcher usually stretches toward home plate to take signs from the catcher. At this point, the pitcher may make any number of preparatory movements necessary for delivering the pitch. Delivery begins when the pitcher brings his arms together in front of his body (a movement punctuated with a discernible pause). This is called coming set. After coming set, the pitcher takes a step toward home and delivers the pitch.|`|7qczKTv3aa	Go from the stretch when there is someone on base because the stretch gives you a shorter delivery time, thus making it harder for baserunners to steal. If you pitch from the windup, runners will steal on you all day.|`|d11198287fd025ed5755e805b28b06adaa	In the wind up position which u should know that the only runner u have to worry about is the one on third. Changing your delivery style not only keeps the runner closer to third also distracts the hitter. Once in a while step off the rubber and throw to third. This lets everyone know that u r not afraid to throw there and also throws off the batters timing.<br>  Throw your pitches from different windups. IE: throw the curve, fastball slider from one position, next the your change-up from the same one u threw your fastball, next time throw the curve. In other words never use the same windup for all of your pitches. Just as u are taught to mix up your pitches mix up your windup. However you must keep your mechanics the same. From the set position u have the advantage on keeping the runner closer to 1st since u r a lefty Never show the same move to a runner in the game. Short stride on your delivery one time big stride next time. Release the ball at different times
IWM1khX7aa	1. Lionel Messi (21 years old)- Best player in the world, has great ball control, speed and skill.  He's going to better and should be the best player in the 2010 World Cup.  He's already performing better than Diego Maradona.<br>  <br>  2. Francesc Fabregas (21 years old)- One of the best center midfielders in the world (when he's not injured).  Already has a great field vision and leader.  Will become one of the greatest center midfielders of our time.<br>  <br>  3. Sergio Ramos (22 years old)- Just like Fabregas.  Already doing good in his position.  Will become one of  greatest right backs of our time.<br>  <br>  4. Alexandre Pato (19 years old)- Already excelling at a young age and should be a favoirte for the 2014 World Cup in Brazil<br>  <br>  5. Karim Benzema (21 years old)- In the footsteps of Zidane and has potential to be like him or Thierry Henry.<br>  <br>  6. Sergio Aguero (20 years old)- A great center forward, but he will be in the shadows of Messi.<br>  <br>  7. Diego (23 years old)- Almost 24, however, a great playmaker and very underrated since he is at Werder Bremen. <br>  <br>  8. Wayne Rooney (23 years old)- If he performs better, he could be England's top striker.<br>  <br>  9. Gonzalo Higuain (21 years old)- Already doing well at Real Madrid.  Can be better than expected and he can be the full time striker for Argentina and Real Madrid.<br>  <br>  10. David Silva (23 years old)- Should go to Barcelona and he's one of the best left wingers in the world and he will be a threat for Spain.<br>  <br>  Others to mention: Samir Nasri, Carlos Vela, Theo Walcott, Denilson, Jack Wilshere, Gael Clichy, Ashley Young, Gabriel Agbonlahor, Jo, Franco Di Santo, John Obi Mikel, Ryan Babel, Lucas, Vincent Kompany, Anderson, Nani, Danny Welbeck, Rafael, Gareth Bale, Tom Huddlestone, Aaron Lennon, Luka Modric, Giovani Dos Santos, Vedran Corluka, Gerard Pique, Bojan, Sergi Busquets, Marcelo, Royston Drenthe, Davide Stanton , Mario Balotelli, Sebastian Giovinco, Jeremy Menez, Yohan Gourcuff, Aiden McGeady, Joao Mountinho, Miguel Veloso, Hernanes, Jozy Altidore, and Freddy Adu.|`|GbyHQQLiaa	Lionel Messi.

Maybe they are the team that wants to make a play for Matt Castle. <br>  <br>  It wouldn't be the first time the jets took a patriot.|`|SEcM9EDZaa	First off, it seems to me that the Jets need a QB more than an old linebacker.<br>  <br>  Secondly, they may be clearing cap space so they can sign LeBron James in 2010.

Y31Ci8vlaa	They practice really hard.They work for nearly 3-4 hours in a day to maintain their fitness.They do it in mornings and evenings.It is tough to make a good schedule.They will practice more on the free days.
