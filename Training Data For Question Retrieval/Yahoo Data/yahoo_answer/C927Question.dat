20090309131551AAYUtok	Business & Finance;Renting & Real Estate	What are some good ways to not let my rent go up when renewing my lease?	At the end of June or July (2009) my lease it up on my apartment. By the time my lease is up I will have been living there for 2 1/2 years.  If it comes down to it, because I am not sure at the moment, what are some ways I can talk to management to perhaps not make my monthly payment go up if I decide to renew again?  I am currently on my third lease and they had a promotion going on when I renewed it the last time (third time), so it didn't make my monthly rent go up.  Is there room to negotiate?  Do I have a right to do so?  I have always paid my rent on time and never had any problems with them.  Actually, if anything, I have had a constant leak in my bedroom, which they still have failed to fix, after maintenance has supposedly checked on it numerous times.  I am not upset about the situation, just a little annoyed that it still hasn't been fixed and it has been 2 1/2 years.  Anyway, bottomline, can I talk down the price of my rent if they decide to raise it this time?  Thank a head of time for the answers! :)

The cable lines and phone lines are in dire need of replacement (I have spoke to technicians from both Comcast and AT&T and they confirmed that the lines need switching out), the coin-op washers and driers only work half the time, and the building (but not our apartment) leaks everywhere when it rains, in fact this time our mail was soaked because it was leaking above the mailboxes.       Is there anything I can do to force our landlord to fix the place up? I live in California, is there somewhere I can make a complaint as to the conditions?        I've asked him repeatedly about the problems we're having but nothing ever comes of it.

A friend of mine owns a business and in our city there are future plans to build a metro light rail cleaning station across from his store.  Unfortunately this has already started and the construction on the road has already made him loose a lot of money and customers.  (no one likes to drive through it all to get to the store).  Is there any assistance a business owner could file for from the city of houston or do you just have to wait for your lease to be up and move out of the shopping center and move the business to a better location?      With the economy being hard he can't afford to break his contract early and when he began his lease there were no talks about city construction in that area.  Are they entitled to assistance from the city of houston?

Well, none of the creditors contacted me, but I started contacting everyone to find out my balances. My car finance company had a balance of $5000, which was interest that they were entitled to, since my BK wasn't completed. Well, I started paying because I wanted to repair my credit. Well, since then, I was laid off again, and now they're calling. The rude lady just asked me when I would pay, I told her I couldn't because I'm not working. She then asked me, "Where is the car?"

20090309165840AA8WEuc	Business & Finance;Careers & Employment;Other - Careers & Employment	How should I ask my interviewer to call my cell?	I recently interviewed for a job that I really want. They told me that they would be making decisions the third week of March, but I will be away on vacation and not all that available to check my messages at home. I will have my cell phone with me – Would it be appropriate to let the interviewer know of my plans and provide her with my cell phone number? Someone once told me that this was not acceptable and that it was up to the interviewee to be checking messages at whatever phone number is on their CV.      The job will not start until mid-April and I'm deliberately taking the vacation now so that I can be available should I get the job.  Also, I don't want to cancel this vacation to sit at home and wait for a phone call that may or may not come.      How should I address this?

I looked at one this weekend and the price is just too good to be true so I'm trying to figure out what could be wrong with it.  Here are the details:  It is a 2 bedroom, 3rd floor condo in a decent neighborhood in Chicago.  It is available as the result of a foreclosure. It has new duct work, new electric and hardwood floors.  The walls and celings look to be in good shape.  The only things it will need are a refrigerator, dishwasher and a washer/dryer.  The bathroom sink is complete except for the faucets.  Other than that, it seems great.  Now, here is the part that has me worried:  It is only $50,000 and it has been on the market since January.  Can anybody offer possible reasons it would be this cheap?

I had a health emergency that wiped out nearly 10,000 dollars in my checking account, and my savings account is empty.       My checking account is down to 500 dollars, and my landlord is about to cash my rent check to him for 750 in a day or two, and I don't get paid until Friday, meaning it will overdraft my account.       I do however, have a credit card with nothing on it and a 5,000 balance.       Is there a way to use my credit card, to transfer money from that credit line, into my checking account so my rent-check doesn't put me into overdraft?       I'll have a 2,000 deposit by Friday, but for the next couple days, that's the only way I can think to avoid calling my landlord and advertising to him I'm flat broke.

I am now fortunate to no longer need to work for money, ever.  So now I want to do some good in this world and work at a place thats not-for-profit and help out either animals (preferred) or people.  My problem is that I have almost zero education (only a GED) and have failed out of two colleges.  All the not-for profit work that I can find that isn't picking up dog poop requires a BA or higher and/or 5+ years exp. in that specific field.  Getting an education will not happen for me (I've been trying to pass 1 class for almost 10 years) and as the Catch-22 goes, can't get experience to get the job without the job in the first place.

20090309174308AAoGh9I	Business & Finance;Careers & Employment;Law & Legal	Questions about employment law (professional opinions preferred)?	I have worked as an assistant in a retail chain for 2 years now, and in July just past this shop's entire company was taken over by another similar chain. Neither my colleagues nor I have received a new contract of employment, new written terms and conditions, nor have we received any written notice confirming that they would honour the previous contracts/written terms. The only information we have ever been given was our manager telling us around end of July that 'our contracts had been transferred over'. She went into no detail and seemed to know very little herself (she makes very little effort to inform herself/others of anything that affects her staff, but thats a different issue). What can we expect from our current employers in respect to this? Are they obliged to honour the previous written terms until they produce new ones themselves? The answer relates to my next question.      The handbook issued with our employment contract from the previous company states 'Your basic rate of pay will be set out in your Employment Contract. It may be varied by written notice to you.' During time at work I stumbled upon a document which would lead me to assume that my basic rate of pay per hour will be decreasing this month. I have not raised this with my boss as I'd prefer to wait until I recieve my payslip and can confirm this suspicion. There has been no mention of this to me in written form from head office or even in word from my manager. My duties in the workplace have not been changed, and are not expected to change. Are they legally allowed to do this without giving me any kind of warning?       I am contracted for 12 hours a week, but having taken a break from my studies I have been working about 24 hours overtime on top of this each week since September. During October there was a problem with my pay - I was not paid for any overtime at all. It has taken them months to resolve this, but it seems I will be reimbursed for those hours in this month's payslip. As those hours were worked in September, am I entitled to have those hours paid at the rate I was being paid in September? Or are the entitled to calculate the pay at the reduced rate if they do in fact cut my pay this month?      And finally, due to the company having financial hardships after a takeover of umpteen stores in a recession, they wished for us to have an emergency training session. Our store manager demanded we come in at exactly 1 weeks notice for this training,  she gave us the choice of 'coming in, or handing in your notice' and stressed it was 'non-negotiable' regardless of circumstances. All staff members bar one attended this session, and that particular staff member was not questioned by the manager at all, leading the rest of us to believe that this was merely a scare tactic she could not follow through. As this training was described as 'non negotiable' and was on top of everyone's contracted hours, we expected this would be paid. The manager has informed only one member of staff (and only after being directly asked) that no one is paid for this training and that it was 'out of your own time'. Is this legal?      If anyone can inform me of any action I am entitled to take or if anything that I've described is illegal or cannot be enforced I would appreciate it vey much. Particularly anyone professionally involved with trade unions/employment law or anyone with a sound knowledge of either.       Thank you.

I graduated from University but can't get any job in my field. So i have been trying to get a part time job on the side while searching for job in my field.      Recently, I was able to get a Maintenance and Delivery job with a manufacturing company on my own without the help from anybody else or my parents. I don't mind cleaning the offices and probably don't mind delivery job. I have a full driving license but I don't have a lot of driving experience as we only have one car in my family. The delivery job would require me to drive around for 50-60km per day delivering 7-8 places in 2 and half hours. I have a feeling that if I could last here for 1 week I would be able to handle it.      Now, my parents are saying because you don't have much experience you should stop this work which pays $50/day after my first day at work. So far in my life I have been a little too much dependent on my parents than I would like to and tried to do something myself. I wanted a work so that I could buy and maintain a car for my self.      Getting any job is so difficult these days and now that somebody has trusted me to do this job I would feel really bad to walk away after 2 days of work (especially my manager seems like a really nice guy). If I leave this job I would be sitting around the house trying to get new jobs and feel a real lack of any achievement. I had been searching for a job for last 6 months before this opportunity was found.      My parents want me to apply for masters but that is also a long process and I don't know what kind of funding I could get and when I will get an opportunity. I have a very good relationship with my parents and I usually do what they ask of me. They asked me to try for part time job in addition to job search in my field and now they dont like the work I got!!!      So decision time: Should I leave the job or should I continue? Why?

Do you have any suggestions for careers or jobs that I might like? Here are a few facts about me and things I am interested in:      * I'm thinking about a career in some scientific field (after I took an Anatomy & Physiology class last year, it really interested me).      * I don't like and I'm not very good at chemistry or math.      * I'm not much a history person either.      * I'm a very organized person, I like to make lists and I'm good with memorizing certain things like schedules      * I'm a really quiet and shy person (I'm more of a listener than a talker).      * I'm into many different types of music and I can play several instruments. I'm into arts & crafts too. (I don't want to be musician or artist)      * I like to help people, and people often say I am "generous" and "thoughtful"      * I like fixing things sometimes      * I'm very patient and can remain calm in most situations.
