Now the insurance company wants to cancel my policy because they feel the roof needs to be replaced because I made a claim after having water leaks after a hard rain.

20090307173923AAcW2Su	Business & Finance;Taxes;Canada	Tax Credits question?  - Canada?	I just graduated from university in 2008. This will be my first year doing my own taxes. (my parents accountant used to do them). So I went to the Canada Revenue Agency website and creating my own epass account so that I could have access to my past tax information. On there, I found out that I have 10,000 dollars in unused Federal tax credits (tuition, books etc.) and 6,000 dollars in provincial unused tax credits.       I don't know what this means, but a friend of mine keeps telling me to make sure I claim my unused tax credits.      What does this mean? Does this mean my parents accountant wasnt' claiming these since I have so many? Or were all of those from last year?      What should I do with this?
20090307174305AAQqbEC	Business & Finance;Careers & Employment;Other - Careers & Employment	Need some workplace advice?	A bit of background my workplace is a small business with 2 (male) bosses, myself (female) and 4 (male) mechanics.      I work up front in the car showroom office, my bosses also have their own office up front as well where they do sales and deal with customers, the mechanics work out back in the workshop.      Our lunchroom is located in the workshop, my bosses expect me to mingle with the mechanics on breaks, I do not as we have scantily clad pictures of women around the walls of the lunchroom, I feel embarrassed and humiliated eating there, I've been forced to eat in cafes or outside the workplace as my boss only cared that the mechanics were happy when I complained, he asked me what I expected him to do he said that if he removed the pictures the mechanics wouldn't work at all, two years later the pictures are still there, I've observed now the calendar for this year the pictures are wearing nothing compared to the last few years where the calendar girl was at least covered a bit, it is not limited to the calendars (there's 2 for some reason both nudes) there are also assorted pictures (of naked or suggestive posed women) on the walls taken from the various mens magazines that the guys read during breaks, often with fully nude centrefolds on display when not being read!      another issue is our workplace has no proper disposal practice for paper, my bosses fill their bins with paper then when it's full pour the paper into large boxes in the store room once every 3 months I have to get garbage bags and empty the boxes into the bags, so they can go to the local land fill, bending over to do this is very bad for my back, when I complained about it they said they'd get one of the guys to empty to boxes into the bags but 3 months later came back and demanded I empty the boxes as the boxes were getting full, they were running out of space and their bins were almost full.      another safety issue is they buy everything in bulk, once a month they buy a big box full of reams of printing paper, when it is delivered I have to open the box and stack the reams in the compactous on a shelf, what's the issue? well the shelf is above my head, I've asked for a small ladder or something to be supplied to do that job as it is not doing good for my back stretching above my head, but my boss has said if I want one to buy it myself though I'm pretty sure that under the occupational health and safety laws they have to supply one for me.       same goes for the ladies toilets, when I pointed out that they are lacking sufficient facilities for that time of the month, they said if I wanted to use pads to purchase a bin myself and empty it myself, the toilets are on one side of the workshop the rubbish bin is on the otherside of the workshop, it would mean emptying the bin would require carrying the waste across the workshop where all the men can see why should I embarrassed like that? they also said the previous person I took over from used tampons, at this time I'd never used tampons, but are now forced to as my workplace does not comform to standards, using tampons is making me sick, I hope that eventually my tampons clog the toilet it would serve them right for ignoring my requests!      is there anybody I can express these issues to anonymously? I'm concerned that my bosses would take legal action against me (after removing the calendars and stuff) and saying I'm lying, I do not want to lose my job, as they pay me well for the work I do, however the standard could and SHOULD be better than it is!

I have good credit but have only had it a couple of years so I'm still building it I guess.  I almost always pay the entire balance off each month.  With the tough economic times, I foresee actually having to let a balance carry over the next few months.  (Although I would still pay more than minimums)  I am considering tranferring a balance to an offer I recently received that would give me a much lower interest rate.  It would certainly make me feel better about getting caught up financially.  That way I could actually use the credit card for the next few months and then I won't have any trouble paying it off by the end of the year.  BUT would tranferring a balance to another card (and opening up the new card) hurt my credit that I'm trying to build?  And if I do tranfer, am I supposed to close the old card completely?

I spoke with the IRS (after being on hold for 40 min), and they say the direct deposit has gone out, and verified the routing # and acct#.  I spoke with my bank, and they say it could take a couple days, or it might have been rejected because my wife isn't on the account.  Basically they say they know nothing.      My question is how long does it take once the IRS "direct deposits" the refund until the bank actually deposits it or knows what happened?

20090227092047AA5iyaZ	Business & Finance;Renting & Real Estate	Borrowing money from girlfriends parents?	My girlfriend and I have been looking at houses for a while, we figure we could get a 20% down payment for one in about 3 years. We are looking for one in from $100,000,- $120,000. Being that the new stimulus package includes $8,000 for first time home buyers, we are kind of looking more aggressively at moving in this year. I will have about $4000 by the end of April. The problem is i don't know how much  more i will be able to save up by this summer, because I am in school. My girlfriend is paying off a credit card and her parents to pay off ( loans for school). We were thinking about asking her parents for a loan of $3000-$5000 to put toward a traditional 5% loan vs a FHA loan. (better interest rate and less stipulations), and to cover any other cost that are associated with the house. We will easily be able to pay them back once our taxes come next year and we get the 8,000. What is the best way to go about asking them if they would loan us the money?

Earlier today, i applied my for my dream job, by e-mailing my CV and covering letter. On the company's website, it said the deadline was today. I have just received an e-mail, thanking me for my application, but that the position was filled last week...a whole week before the deadline!       In this e-mail, they have said that they were 'impressed with my application' and that they will keep my details on file. They have also asked me to keep checking the vacancies page for other positions.       What does this really mean? Does this happen often, or were they actually impressed with my application enough to reply to my application??? They did say on their website that due to the expected number of applications, they wouldnt be able to respond to everyone?      So, should i be happy, or dismiss this as just another automated reply. It does mention me by name however.       So, do you think i have a chance with them in the future?

He offered me a silly amount to buy me out which i refused and he has since been delaying selling the house. He could not get a mortgage and now  we have an offer which is what his original offer was he can some how get a mortgage or is it another reason to delay the sale as he knows he will have to move out. We were not married but engaged and have a child together and jointly own the house. No agreements were made before we purchased on who got what if we split up. So it should be 50/50. Even though i have custody of our child. Can i force a sale through the courts. He has moved another partner in and i am worried she will be able to start claiming a share and thats another reason why i think he is delaying the sale. Any help whould be appriacted.

Maybe I've just been watching too much House and it'll wear off and I'll move on - Who knows.      However, my problem is that I have 2 felonies on my record (Home Invasion, 2nd Degree). It's important to say that these are not "real" felonies, meaning that they were adjudicated in juvenile court, and I believe are labeled as civil matters instead of criminal, since I was under the age of 18.

We are about a quarter mile down the road from a police station, so my coworkers tell me I shouldn't feel unsafe but there is this lunatic man (possibly homeless, he doesn't have a car..) that comes in randomly and has been banned from the store, personally scolded by management and has vandalized our bathroom door (carving things into it, weird words/symbols with his NAILS)  and he harasses our customer asking for money.  He is probably 45 and always asks if we can "spare" him a free coffee, I never allow it but usually I have management with me to back me up so I am not scare. We have called the police on him several times but they take 20 minutes to show up, by then he is gone.  He once road a miniature skateboard throughout the store and ran into customers! Then he came up to me at my register and demanded a crisp dollar bill (for snorting cocaine I assume) and he kept shouting weird things.. "konga konga konga konga onion bagel konga konga konga glazed donuts.."etc, it was the first time I met him. (he has carved the word KONG into the door several times)      Today he came in wearing weird attire (business outfit with a camo army jacket over it and black paint or marker on his face like cat whiskers) and he was harassing a customer asking for money and I told him to quit asking for money and our managers have told him this before and he needs to order and pay or leave, and he looked at me like he was going to slash my throat.. I was scared shitless all night he was going to come back and kill me!

Say you place a wager on ABX (Barrick Gold) at 28.00 for it to go higher      Now, would it be a good play to have an OPTION for a put of around 28.00?  This way if the stock goes higher than I will not exercise my option and take the gains if Mr. Schiff is correct.  If my stock gets crushed and the DOW falls to 3,000 and the stock goes to 15.00 then I can at least get in that option and take back some of my losses.      Any opinions, is this like Insurance at a blackjack table?  I am not to sure yet on how to beat the options game at the stock market casino (Yes the market is a casino)      One of my favorite plays I think in this Casino game is to put a "PUT" play on companies like GM, C, BAC, GE, PM and have the put for at least six months from now and wait for them to get destroyed.  But its a gamble, sort of like poker, baccarat, blackjack and sports betting.      Thank you for those whom can help with the hedge question on having a "PUT" on a stock you own long.      Peace everyone :)

20090307203747AAHDfaH	Business & Finance;Small Business	Online clothing company question?	My husband and I are starting our own online clothing company. He is a web/graphic designer (www.IDS-Advertising.com) and is taking care of all our web and advertising needs. Because of his background and knowledge he is also doing all the designing. We have all our designs ready and know the printers who will be printing (we are starting with t-shirts). Because of the tight economy we don't quite have the funds to invest in getting all the designs printed and shirts ready to ship. We are assuming that we first need the product here and ready to ship before taking orders, correct? Or is there another way we can go about this? Can we completely set up the online shop and begin business and wait until orders come in, and then send them out to print as we receive them? We know it will be more expensive at first, but, this way we can see if this will work or be a total failure. If it fails then we dont risk loosing any money.       So if there is anyone out there who has tried this or has any knowledge of it, we welcome your ideas and input. Thanks in advance!
20090307195050AAVTvZI	Business & Finance;Credit	What do you think about Debix?  So far I thnk they're great...but I could be wrong.?	After calling the IRTC or ITRC and spoke w/counselor for free...re:identitytheft, and that I had put Credit Alerts but then added Credit Freezes to 2 of the 3 CRAgencies...they responded but in a link they sent to me, it included to contact Debix (because if they send you the link, you get first year free)...       They are all I really needed (from the beginning I wish I found them because it would've saved me much wasted time/running in circles and making many errors, some of which may be irreversible; the ID theif may have already destroyed my credit.  I can't even order an updated Credit report/or even pay for a Credit Score, becuase I jumped the gun and put in Security Freezes, so now it all has to be done w/Snail mail and all kinds of ID and I believe also a notarized statement...just to take it off For Me.  When you're homebound/disabled, it's hard to put together all this together and have it mailed by USPS return receipt requested or something in that arena.         Anyway, I found out that DEBIX...after setting up my account, where they call you up and if anybody tries to get an item w/your Identity Information (SS#, Mother's Maiden Name, etc.), and then the company will first check your credit, and DEBIX will pop in and automatically I'll get an instant phone call (if not home, to secondary number, cell phone), and they have you first do a voice print...and they ask if you authorized this.  If not, it cannot go through.      Anyway, the day after I signed up...Someone from Debix called me up and actually asked me about my situation and advised me very clearly what to do, and my question is:   1.  Is it true, that with Debix in place, I really have no need fort Security Freeze as that will only make things harder on me...as it has already...and just keep the "Credit Alerts" and keep that updated.  In fact, they put in the credit alerts for you, except I already did that, but they have to at least try to do it as part of the service.       So now, I am basically asking if it's safe to take of security freeze since I have 3 Credit Alerts in place (w/the cr agencies) because it's preventing me from doing things...including getting a brand new (as I alreayd rec'd the free credit reports weeks ago when first placed alerts)...I'm curious what's going on Since and if my Credit Score has plunged.         So if it's advisable to reverse the freezes...and w/the alerts in place along w/Debix...so I can find out what's happening w/my credit "in the now".       Also, is there anyway to get the Credit Freezes Off (outside of a temporary "take off using the Pin Number I rec'd)...an easier way than to make photocopies of proof of address, proof of "it's me" and then to have to mail it and wait for response?  Such as using the internet or the telephone?          Still sorta confused...I think that's probably obvious....also the Free Advisors', and they will call you back, if you email them for a certain time, so you don't have to deal w/that expense (*if money is a factor").          Overall is Debix a safe bet?  And since I'm getting first 12 months free (cause I am victim of ID theft), do you know or have you heard if it's a secure and helpful system?  Seems so, but, everything isn't always what it seems to be.                           Thank you very much,Jay

Instead the IRS conducts audits on returns deemed questionable by its Discriminate Function System (DFS) a complicated and highly secretive computerized analysis system. In an attempt to reduce the proportion of âno-changeâ audits (that is m audits that uncover that no additional taxes are due), The irs only audits returns the DFS scores as highly questionable. The proportional of no change audits has risen over the years and is currently 0.25 .Suppose that you select a random sample of 100 audits. What is the probability that the sample has       A â Between 24% and 26 % no change audits      b- between 20% and 30% no change audits      c- more that 95% no change audits

Earlier in the year, I invested about 10 thousand dollars into my friends company for a piece of their projected revenues. It has not shown to be out of the red yet so I have not seen any money on this return and it's probable that the funds have been used and no money will ever come of this project. I've seen the prototype for what my money went into and now (especially in this economy) don't think this  item will make enough money to even break even. I happen to know that my particular portion has already been spent on lawyers fees that i can get a receipt for,      Can I write the 10 thousand off on my taxes?       Thanks in advance.
