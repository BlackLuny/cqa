20090203073213AAgcVWt	Health;Women's Health	I am starting birth control pills for the first time this month ...?	My last period started Monday Jan 26. I just went to the dr. Friday but didn't get the prescription filled until yesterday. I see that you are supposed to start the pill the first day of your period or the first Sunday after.     I am now on day 9 of my cycle. If I had started the first Sunday after that would have been just 2 days ago. So I would have missed two days if I start today. I would like to just go ahead and start the pill today instead of waiting almost 4 weeks for the next sunday after my cycle.     One option if you miss 2 days is to take 2 pills today and 2 tomorrow. But I am concerned about feeling sick and nauseous from the pill.     I am a virgin (in my twenties) and am in a serious relationship. But I am not really concerned about being protected right away because we can wait a month until I am sure the pill is in my system and working. Even then I plan on using a 2nd form of birth control as well.     What I am wondering is if I can just go ahead and start the pack today (Tuesday) without doubling up on today and tomorrows dose. Then take the pills for the month to get them into my system and then start a new pack as directed the Sunday after my period. Will this be harmful at all to my cycle? Missing just the first 2 days?     Any advice would be helpful.

20090203072732AAIVstY	Health;Diseases & Conditions;Skin Conditions	Cold sores - care for an opinion?	I've read a lot of nonsense online about how to treat a cold sore, and I figured I'd record my position on the issue.      My cold sores, and those of many people, are introduced by (1) an odd redness that stands out from the rest of the lip, (2) the appearance of tiny little bumps which increase in size and number, (3) the concurrent swelling of those regions, and (4) (prior to any visible bumps) the feeling that the redness is colder than the rest of the lip.       I 've had my share of cold sores: the first one lasted two weeks, the second lasted one week because I handled it better, and all subsequent ones have lasted no more than 36 hours before the sore receded but I'll say 2-3 days to be safe.      At the first sign of a sore, I take an antiviral drug. I do not wish to advertise, but there are only three major drugs out there: acyclovir, valacyclovir (valtrex), and then there's Famvir. I can only talk of valacyclovir - it works by blocking the action of enzyme DNA Polymerase, without which the virus can't replicate. Valacyclovir has greater bioavailability, which means more of the drug can be used by your body (55% vs 15%).   After taking my medication, the little bumps keep increasing in size and number, and it has been my perception that the drug initially speeds up this process.You keep looking in the mirror, only to see the blisters form what appear to be continental masses divided by many canals - they haven't merged yet. The development of the sore after taking the drug peaks 12-16 hours later, and meanwhile you wonder how bad your scar will be. At the 24 hour mark, you relax because it becomes clear the sore has stopped growing, and at 30 hours, the sore has begun receding. One day and a half, the skin where the breakout occurred was only slight darker than the surrounding skin, but it was not broken or breached, and it's a matter of a little more time for it to look like the surrounding skin. Not a bad feat considering it had been populated by many white blisters so close together they looked like they HAD to scab in order to heal.      All over the internet I have found tips to speed the drying and scabbing process. But this seems like *utter nonsense*. If you take your drug at first symptoms (and you learn to recognize those), the blisters will continue to progress, but will then *recede*. Now, if the skin is still strong and healthy, it will recover, without any scabbing and hence without any scarring.  My worst blisters in the past 2 years have completely receded within 36 hours, without a scab and without a scar. Throughout the breakout I made sure to apply a good lip moisturizer frequently (but using good common sense to never actually touch the sore itself, or wash my hands very thoroughly before touching other parts of my body), to prevent the skin around a blister from drying and beginning to scab.       A browse through the internet will show many alarming pictures than should be rated R, and show you many horrific scenarios - all of which seem to do nothing but stress you out. The fact is this: if you take your drug at *first symptoms*, and keep the skin strong with a good moisturizer without biting at it, you should be fine.

20090203073700AADu20y	Health;Women's Health	Am I pregnant or is this just a serious UTI?	I have a urinary tract infection right now and I have all the symptoms: burning while peeing, strong odor in urine, and even vomiting and backache. I went to the doctors the other day to get it treated because I was worried that it was a kidney infection so they prescribed me some antibiotics. About a month ago I had unprotected sex for about 2 mins (3mins the most) before putting on a condom. My period was always irregular so I can't tell by the missed period thing. Since I threw up and have lower back aches (symptoms of a kidney infection), could this be a sign that I am pregnant since I do know that a UTI is common with pregnant women? Before I got the antibiotics, I would always have to go pee but little urine comes out and at one point I had little drops of blood too. I know that pregnant women also make frequent trips to the bathroom but has anyone ever seen blood in the urine while pregnant? Please help me because I am so confused right now.. the symptoms of a pregnancy and UTI is sooo similar!

My room mate had just peed on the floor a bit. There were ants clustered around his urine! Im guessing it was not just the moisture they were attracted to, because there was a bit of water on the floor from the shower, and the ants weren't interested. My hypothesis is that my room mate's urine has a really high sugar content which is attracting the ants...

I'm newly diagnosed diabetic and I thought I had the flu.  I kept thinking it would go away after a couple of days.  Originally I took one shot of lantus at bedtime and tested once in the morning. Now I am so confused.  I now have been given a endocrinologist but I can't see for a week.  I know the lantus pen does not need to be refrigerated after opening.  How about novolog? Always keep it in frig? Anyone ever have to use K-phos? It seems dangerous but obviously not as much as DKA.  I live by myself and am afraid if I have a low in my sleep I won't wake up.  I couldn't keep anything down me so I thought if I gave myself insulin I would go low, NOT wow I almost died. Just so confused and scared about everything now.  I didn't realize when diabetic is sick sugar goes through the roof.  Thank you anyone who replies fellow diabetics.  Wow this disease sucks!

20090220171122AA5KlgL	Health;Men's Health	Please settle this for me right NOW...?	I KNOW this is long, but please take your time to help me out here...   Ok, I'm a 15 year old male, 5'8, 140 pounds.  Just last year I was about 160-165 lbs.  In addition, I was 5'7.  I lost this weight by simply eating less (not starving myself at all) and eating more healthily.    I'm Asian, so one thing I did was to eat half (or maybe a quarter) of my rice portions.  I did this since rice contains virtually no real nutrition.  However, I did not reduce portions of other types of foods that much.     I stayed away from foods with some saturated fats.  For example, I substituted meat with tofu.  (IS THIS healthy by the way??)) Also, now I don't eat cookies, cupcakes, etc. I very rarely eat cheese.  The only milk I'll drink now is skim milk.  I'll reluctantly drink some 1%.     I don't think my exercise has really changed much, though.        Now, I'm glad that I'm more healthy now.  In fact, if I was 18 or so I would be satisfied.  But the thing is, my parents are really making me think that I have slowed down my growth by eating less meats, saturated fats, and in general...and I'm really feeling horrible about my decision.  I think they think so because I was overweight my whole life, especially in my early teens (AND This is when I grew the MOST). This is the argument they use against me.  But I'm pretty sure that it was just a coincidence.. What do you think?  Did I slow down my growth???   My parents are 5'4-5? and 5'2-3? by the way, very short I know.      Not only are my parents making me feel horrible, but my friends are as well.  They eat anything they want (cupcakes, donuts, fries, etc) and yet they do not gain weight, but instead JUST get taller.  This is making me believe that I did all this work and sacrificed some of my unhealthy eating for NOTHING.     I feel like I am the ONLY 15 year old boy in the world who has these (possibly over-the-top?) healthy eating habits!      So, once again, I understand that I've grown quite a lot since I am taller than both my parents by some inches already.  But by the way my parents try to convince me to eat more fattening foods and eat more to get taller, and seeing my friends eat anything they want and just get taller, I really feel terrible about my decision.  I really want to get to 6'.  But seeing how I only grew half an inch over the past 6 months, I'm starting to doubt this.   So.. could you just answer my questions?   Thanks.

Today I have finally found the exact frames while searching through the internet. If I were to buy these online, how would I get them fitted/made? Do I just go to the Vision Center?

There are several different liquid vitamins and I have been told by a friend that takes them that she has never felt better.  However, I would like to see what others think about this product of anti-oxidants and vitamins.      Has anyone heard of and/or has used Isotonix products?  If so, what is your opinion?  Which products do you use?        I am thinking about purchasing Isotonix OPC-3 and the Isotonix Multivitamin.      Any recommendations, pros, cons, etc. would be appreciated.

I had my wisdom teeth (all of them) extracted yesterday afternoon (Thursday) and I am hoping to go to a friends party tomorrow night (Saturday). My dental surgeon never said anything about not drinking alcohol after the surgery, however everything I've read says to give it at least 24 hours for the blood clots to mature. Considering the party will have been over 48 hours since my surgery, does anyone see any problems with alcohol consumption? Also, it should be known that I am not taking the pain medicine (Vicodin) anymore due to me not being in that much pain, so I don't see a problem with the medicines. I am still on the antibiotics though. Thanks for your help.

20090220172703AAGGTuf	Health;Mental Health	What's wrong with me? Do I have anger problems?	Ever since my friend died a couple of months ago, some friends and I have been going through a really hard time. I'm not putting all of the details, but life is very stressful, I've actually had three adults say to me that they're amazed I'm even getting out of bed and making it to school at the moment. Yet, lately it seems I feel very angry with just about everyone for almost no reason. The only person I'm not angry with is my friend who killed herself. I feel like I just want to push everyone else away, like they don't understand what I'm going through and they're making up things and exaggerating to make their own lives sound worse for attention. When I get angry, I get REALLY angry. I've never hurt anyone or anything like that, I just kind of snap at people, then retreat to my room and freak out when I'm alone. I don't want to hurt anybody or anything like that, I don't hate them or want to see them upset, it's like sometimes my pain and stress turns into rage and it keeps coming back. Even my best friends, the people who I live for, I want to push away and make them get out of my life. I only want to be close to the friend that I lost. It's incredibly difficult to deal with the anger all of the time. What is wrong with me? Thanks for any and all serious suggestions/advice.

I've always, alwayssss been self conscience about my breats because I've always thought they point south slightly more than the average breasts.   I was slightly bigger (weight wise) a year or so ago and I was a small C/big B cup but I've now lost nearly 30lbs and I'm an A cup but my breasts still sag. I know that losing weight can sometimes do that to you but my breasts have always been like this, from the moment they developed.      When they were developing, I didn't wear the right bra. My bra gave me no support what so ever, could this be the reason they automatically grew this way?      Also one of my breasts is bigger than the other and the smaller one still sags but not as bad, the other one is noticeably much larger and much saggier. I'm so self-conscience about it. Is there no solution other than surgery to the drooping?

Nous avons eu 3 disputes à cause de 3 reproches que je lui ai fait (qui portaient sur l'alcool ou les drogues car je ne consomme pas et bois occasionnellement) et ce fut comme l'élément déclencheur d'une crise psychotique : ton qui hausse, colère, insultes, yeux fuyants, haine ("je ne peux pas faire l'amour avec toi") et fuite.

A friend told me spicey food is bad for you when you're on a diet, but I don't see the harm in it if I don't heartburn or anything.  In fact, spicey food makes me drink more water, so it's a good thing, right?       Furthermore, I have a sweet tooth so the very idea of chocolate cake makes my mouth water.  Should I remove sweets from my life for the entire time I'm dieting and begin to eat them in moderation afterwards.  OR can I have a little bit during the time I'm dieting?  If so, is there a thing as a healthy chocolate cake? lol

Lately I've been waking up really nauseous in the mornings and it's gotten to the point where it's made me vomit a couple of times. If I do throw up, I feel like it's hard eating anything throughout the day because my body can't recoup for some reason. The nausea especially impedes my sleep and I usually can't stay asleep for more than six hours or so without waking up feeling abysmal.      I take a proton-pump inhibitor (Aciphex) but it doesn't seem to help enough. Each time after I throw up, I feel completely debilitated throughout the day and I usually can't eat any meals until around 1 PM. Sometimes I feel a dull pain in my leg, I get really dizzy and somewhat exhausted after I vomit. Also, my skin occasionally changes texture and doesn't feel the same way it normally does after this happens. All of this is really beginning to ruin my life.      Given what I've said, do you have any suggestions? I'm male, so I know it's not anything associated with morning sickness.

Will I eventually have a normal period after this soon, or do I have to go back on the pills to bring it on? Thanks in advance.

I don't look over weight, but I gained about 15 lbs in the past 5 months because of job changes and stress.  I didn't do anything special before like excercise or eat better before, I just was 110-115 lbs.  Any way I would like to lose those 15-20 lbs by summer, is it possible?      I don't really want to lose weight so much as to look more fit and toned.  I work 40 hr weeks, Mon-Fri 8-4.  And Thurs. thru Sat. I work at another job 4:30pm-11pm.  I also just bought a house and would like time to work on it.      I drink 60-80 oz of water a day, and eat oatmeal and a banana for breakfast.  A yogurt and banana or apple for lunch and dinner is usually some kind of protein with some veggies.      Can anyone help me get back?

I'm thinking about just going for a walk (60 minutes).  Can I count this as exercise, or is it more of a relaxtion kind of thing?        If you think about it, walking is just a notch above standing still and hardly burns any calores.  So, for EXPERIENCED exercisers or trainers, would you consider walking a workout, or more just a relaxation/keep the muscels stretched out kind of thing?      By the way I'm 5'4" and 115 pounds so pretty fit already.

20090220122428AASBeJG	Health;Diet & Fitness	Staying underweight without losing muscle tone?	Ok so here is my question. If I don't watch what I eat at all, eating whatever I want, and don't exercise, I am between 105 and 110 pounds. I have a slow metabolism and put on weight VERY easily. I want to be a jockey, and I have been advised that an apprentice jockey (one who has not yet been licensed) would be smart to always stay under 100 pounds. If I exercise and eat healthily, I weight 100 pounds. I would like to be somewhere between 95 pounds and 97 pounds just for the feeling of safety that I won't get too close to 100 pounds. Eating low calorie foods, it used to be much easier for me to get down into the low 90s. A year later, after I have gained MUCH more muscle, it is really hard for me to get down to 95. I pretty much have to starve myself to get that low (eat like 500 calories a day). I don't want "starving" to make me lose my muscle tone. Trying to lose the weight again (right now I am 105ish), I find my muscle tone decreasing as I try to shed the pounds.      What are my other options? I would like to be underweight (between 95 pounds and 97 pounds) without losing my muscle tone. Is there anything I can do? Advice would be much appreciated, thank you.

Docs said her liver was 80% dead and her brain had shrunk by 2 inches but after being released from hospital she continues to drink. She drinks daily [wine] but not as much as she used too. Its now feb 2009 and she is still here and hasnt gone down hill any further? Im confused?      I care for her son who is 10 and i want to know whats the time scale usually? The doctor said 1-2 years if she really looked after herself and 6-8 weeks if she didnt but she drinks daily and goes to pubs and im confused?

20090220165010AAA8pGz	Health;Other - Health	Unresolved Health Problem? 10 Points For Best Answer?	Ok this is long...but I'll try to make it as brief as possible.      Six months ago I found a swollen lymph node in the back of my neck, it didn't hurt so I thought nothing of it. After I had found it, I started getting numerous infections until now, 4 strep infections and 1 bladder infection. The swollen lymph node before never unswelled...      Now for about the past month or so...I've been getting progressively worse. I have very bad headaches and pain in my neck and shoulders, three other lymph nodes have become swollen, I have bad fatigue, off and on mild fevers (which are worse at night), a sore throat that doesn't feel as bad as strep (but close), and I have shortness of breath after walking long distances or going up a flight of stairs (my heart rate increases pretty significantly as well).      I've been to several doctors and have had several blood tests. The blood tests have all come up negative for all strains of mono, so I know that's not what this is...And everything else in the blood tests comes out normal except my WBC count is relatively low but still within normal limits (around 4,500 or so). The last doctor who saw these results figured that I had no obvious signs of infection since if I did my WBC count would be more elevated...he then came to the conclusion that it's either an atypical mycobacterial infection or cancer of some sort.       So he gave my azithromycin, and I have finished that and I actually feel much worse. New symptoms have come up since I've been on it, such as the pain in my throat is much worse, more lymph nodes have become swollen, and my chest hurts when I breathe in after moving around.      Does anyone have any insight as to what is going on? I've been sick for months now and I'm getting pretty sick of it (no pun intended). All of the doctors I've been to have been so vague, so it's starting to make me feel uneasy.....so any ideas or similar experiences would be MUCH appreciated. Thank you for taking the time to read this (sorry it was long)

20090203074936AAqoDuv	Health;Other - Health	How long do the symptoms of panic attacks last for?	I began to have problems with dizziness, heart palpitations and generally feeling weird around four months ago. I went to the doctor and he assured me that I was suffering from panic attacks. At first the weird dizzy feelings were really unsettling and although I don't feel as though I'm going to collapse and die anymore I still often feel weird as if everything is surreal at times as well as having a quick heart beat quite often. Is it normal for this to last as long? And how can I stop this fully? I also suffer really bad hangovers whenever I drink now which came about when the panic attacks began. Is there a link here? Finally does being a smoker make any odds?    Answers to any of these questions would be greatly appreciated.

20090203075207AAZ01et	Health;Women's Health	Lower abdominal pain confusion..?	My 18 year old sister over the past 4-5 years has been having some very sharp pains in her lower abdomen/upper vaginal area. She always figured that it was a yeast/urine infection but no OTC creams would ever do anything. A couple months back she finally went to the doctor and they tested her for both a yeast and urinary infection as well as STDs. All the tests came back normal which was devestating to her because she knows something is wrong. The other day she came home from school early because the pain was so bad and I asked her a little bit about it. She said that it's not an itch or burning sensation. She described it as if someone was stabbing her in the uterus. She mentioned that she can always tell when she's about to get her period because the pain is so unbearable beforehand, she says it's painful during other parts of the month but it is worse before her period. She was on birth control for about a year a year ago and is currently on it now and she said that the pain is slightly less while being on it. She mentioned one time she came home from school early and while walking home she peed her pants because the pain was so excruciating. To me this sounds like something serious, and the thing that sticks out in my mind is Endrometriosis.. How long does it take to diagnose? What type of tests will they run? She has a doctors appointment today but we would just like to get an idea of what it might be. If any of you have had similiar symptoms with something we would appreciate your imput.

Heya :) I'm 18   I would say i started developing breasts when i was about 13 properly, but it's only been the past year or two that my breasts have started to grow considerably, (i'm a 34b, but don't look it i look smaller lol) I can't really explain it. It's like when i first started getting boobs , they were just developing, it's only recently they've been growing, if you get me lol.   Anyways, i have quite large nipples for the size of my boobs, and was wondering whether my boobs would probably grow into them lol. They're exactly the same shape as Keeley Hazell's,  only alot smaller and more pert, but the nipples are around the same size. Kinda weird? Will my boobs grow more do you think. Do you think my nipples are just developing properly first.

The dreams are beautiful and wonderful. The first night's was a little more confusing than the second night. The second night was just like a personal place. But in both dreams I'd dive in the water, swim to the bottom and then look up thru the water. I was just wondering if it meant something. Also, a few nights ago I was dreaming about running. I was just running thru the country. It was nice and relaxing. I wasn't being chased I was just running. Does this mean anything too?
