AE3lv4pRaa	I can suggest you some ways to build credit:-<br>  <br>  It is actually pretty easy to build credit. Try one of the following ideas:<br>  <br>   <br>  Ask your bank or credit union about a secured credit card. You can make a deposit to your account and have a credit limit in the amount of your deposit. The bank takes little risk and you build credit slowly.<br>   <br>  Use a co-signer on your first few credit accounts. Lenders will consider the co-signer’s existing credit. The co-signer essentially ‘vouches’ for you while you build credit. Note that this is a big responsibility – you can cause major headaches for the co-signer if you don’t pay as agreed<br>  <br>  Use retailer programs for modestly large purchases like furniture. For example, you may buy a television on the “$40/Month Payment Plan”. Gas station cards may work as well. These programs can be easier to qualify for and they certainly help you build credit. Be sure that the retailer will report your loan to the major credit reporting companies.<br>  <br>  Get a credit card with any reputable institution that will give you one. Again, you have to make sure they’ll report your timely payments to the credit reporting companies. Of course, you have to always pay at least the minimum before the due date.|`|DorePwVOaa	Yes, getting a card, charging a few items monthly that you were going to buy anyways (like gas or groceries) and paying the bill off in full each month is a good way to build a credit history.<br>  <br>  Your credit score is not affected either way, if you pay off your bill in full, or just make the minimum payments. BUT, just making the minimum will cost you money in interest so... which sounds better to you?|`|AA12065007	Use it for every day things that you would buy anyway and pay in full before the due date. <br>  <br>  Don't worry about a balance there will always be a small one for the credit card company to report due to the difference between the billing and due dates.<br>  <br>  This way you build credit fast and never pay any interest.<br>  <br>  I have 3 cards that I have done this with for the last 3 years and all of my scores are well over 800 and I have made several hundred dollars in cash back rewards.<br>  <br>  Not bad for using someone elses money for free.|`|bd0cc3fbe67ad2d44e48d6ce0ebc9284aa	In the good old days, like last week, this would have been an easy thing to do but credit card companies are slashing available credit for people who pay off the balance every month!! Ask me how I know? We just had a Geico card slashed from over $12K to $2K. They don't make any money off of people like us who pay their bills! So they are being sneaky and lowering available credit w/o notification so THEN you get hit with a bill for going over your limit.<br>  <br>  Be VERY careful with credit cards in this climate....|`|9famwd6Waa	Get a credit card from local bank and pay it in time. You also can use this service to avoid common mistakes while buiding credit and pre-estimate future scores for different scenarios of payments - freecreditreport.sinfree.net
VHYIx8vcaa	The fastest somewhat-easy way would be to get a no-interest loan from a trusted family member.<br>  <br>  Ok, i'm assuming that's not an option though.<br>  <br>  Here are some options:<br>  <br>  Sell items on Craig's List and Ebay . on eBay set up buy-it-now auctions so you can get money faster. Depending on how much time u have 2 make money, you can also sell books easily on half.com. List all the books you don't need.<br>  <br>  On Craig's List you can sometimes find gigs, or temporary jobs. Be careful though. Once I did land a nice job with Craigs List. Try looking within a 100 mile radius because you never know, maybe there's a really nice temp job in a nearby city. I've also seen babysitting gigs on Craigslist.<br>  <br>  Perhaps deposit all the loose change in your car and couches. It may add up.<br>  <br>  Do you have many old books around? maybe you can sell some old textbooks to a bookstore.<br>  <br>  If you have some old school papers or interesting articles you wrote, submit them to Associated Content for upfront payment. for example I submitted this article I wrote for school - <a href="http://www.associatedcontent.com/article/1352571/modern_egyptian_culture.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.associatedcontent.com/article...</a> and they gave me 4 bucks for it. This may take 2 weeks to get money though.<br>  <br>  Do you have a unique skill or any skill that you can offer to people? For example, I can type decently and so maybe I can put up ads like "Typing Service $1/page - I can type your old Memoirs, Diaries, etc."<br>  <br>  I've heard about donating blood for money, but it depends on your city's size.<br>  <br>  In big city's there may be day-labor agencies, but I never tried them. This might be a bit too laborious for you though, I mean it's probably not suitable for ladies because it's landscaping or debris removal-type stuff.<br>  <br>  Selling candy door-to-door. If you go to one of the big stores like Sams, etc. You maybe can get a bunch of variety candies.. but this needs maybe  50 bucks initially. well if you did this you could sell them with a small kid, door-to-door. Aim for a reasonable profit like maybe 25￠ on each one so you can sell more.<br>  <br>  Oh, and you may advertise your help as a personal assistant. For example, some people are handicapped and may hire you. Tutoring also is good.<br>  <br>  if this is like really really serious contact me 4 more advice, cuz my hands need a rest..<br>  <br>  If all else fails maybe you can try going around to many small mom-&-pop shops and ask if you can just help out for a short time. At the least you may get connections.<br>  <br>  best of luck to  you dear

Q4NFFBizaa	ya its always legal to cancel a check. However now you have not been paid, so you can file a lawsuit against him and take him to small claims court and get your money! thats what I would do and maybe warn some people about this person not paying you!|`|SnpP6dGFaa	Contact him and ask him why he canceled the check.  He may not have been happy with your work, but no it's not legal.  If he refuses to pay then you can take him to civil court.|`|rrp9c2tnaa	No, this is not legal.  Take the copy of the contract for services, the check, and any other documentation of services performed to your local DA's office.  They can pursue fraudulent check charges.|`|Si9hhcW1aa	You can take him to small claims court and request for repayment. However, when going to court you will need to prove that you did the work, have your contract stating what you were supposed to do and then proof that you completed the work. You can take in pictures of the completed work or you can take in an eye-witness but pictures are better. You will also need to get proof that he stopped payment on the check. You can do this by getting your bank statement showing there was no deposit made and I copy of the check (I think). You cannot take lawyers to small claims but you can consult with one. Good luck.|`|393fe9fc7beb572e9469d5d7853f35e3aa	Its always legal to put a stop payment on a check. However if someone owes you the money for work you have done for them then they rightfully have to pay you unless they tell you right then they aren't happy with your work. Then you should do what you can to make the customer happy. Now to the Non payment issue. Like I said they have legal right to stop payment. Its your job to follow up as to why they did so. Try to collect without taking it to court. Keep record of every time you call them or they call you. Make note of EVERYTHING said. If no resolution can come of this then keeping records will most definitely help your case in court.<br>  <br>  Good Luck!|`|AA11506593	Do you mean that he placed a stop payment on the check? If so, it may be legal. Have you not cashed it within 90 days? Does he have reason to belief that the check was lost? Did the services you performed meet standards? Anything defective?<br>  <br>  I suggest you contact him to find out what has happened.|`|33d7210d104ceb5ac8526a1cc2d5871baa	nope... even if your customer was not satisfied with the work.  You performed at least something and you have a right to be paid.  Find out why they stopped payment on the check and see if there is a resolution.  If not, you have the option of taking them to court.|`|MAobRc4iaa	The only way he can legally cancel the check is if all the services that he requested have not been performed upon finishing the job
d331dd95c4a1ebbb6ed4bd0996d3a0b6aa	sorry but the company is under no obligation to work around your schedule, no matter what any one says 49 states are at will there fore if you leave early and you are told not to then you are fired for cause and won't collect, it is not fair I agree but the business comes before your needs, unfair but in no way illegal|`|QLopvWKDaa	You will still be able to draw unemployment insurance pay.  <br>  <br>  Depending on the state, you may have to wait a penalty period, but not necessarily.<br>  <br>  When you file- put that you were terminated for conflict in schedule, fired or let go.  Put the burden of proof on them to prove that you quit.<br>  <br>  Do not file that you quit!<br>  <br>  Claims are only denied for gross infractions of policy or if you caused damages.<br>  <br>  Remember- this is not the file future employers will ever see, so putting that you were fired is between you, your ex-employer and the processor.<br>  <br>  Good Luck!

AH7q8paDaa	Congratulations on obtaining your G.E.D. and the high scores! That's a great step in the right direction. I also commend you for doing your homework and trying to suss out a workable job-to-career path. <br>  I can't answer all of your questions, but I have some experience as a job-hunter and can refer you to some helpful articles. I also think a chat with a professional recruiter or other placement expert would be beneficial. They can assess the real potential impact of your criminal record. Basically, I think if you handle it right, this is not necessarily a train wreck. People with worse backgrounds than you find work every day.<br>  The main thing is, you have to be ready to explain each circumstance honestly and in a way that makes people want to hire you. Everyone has made mistakes, and in some situations, it's even beneficial experience for a job (working as a counselor, for example.) Explain why it happened, what you learned and what you are doing about it. But be succinct. (You might want to practice answering these questions with a friend.) <br>  I am not sure your mental health treatment as a teen-ager would even come up. Regarding your credit history, it will depend on what kind of job you are seeking whether it will impact you. I have had past credit issues but so far it has never been brought up by a potential employer. Also note that more and more businesses run background checks on prospective employees these days, so that makes it crucial that you bring up the information first by answering relevant application questions thoroughly and honestly. <br>  Yes, this may allow them to screen you out up front. But if a background check brings up something you should have put on the application, you probably aren't going any further with that company anyway. If you are honest and you can show you have changed and want a chance, many people will meet you halfway. Then the question becomes whether you have the right skills and experience and whether your personality fits into the company culture. <br>  Try to relax and remember how many people out there in the workforce have things in their past they aren't too happy with. Tons of them are working, many of them have succeeded and some of them are now bosses with the power to hire. If you are a good person with skills and determination, someone is going to want you on their team. <br>  You have done a lot of hard work to get on the right track, so keep moving ahead and don't let fear sidetrack you. I wish you the best of luck!|`|Nx4mJZVxaa	.
6Tos0jaBaa	Don't let Allstate fool you with the money they have put into advertising over the years, even a company that appears to be everywhere and with almost everyone, can still have major dissapointments.  According to the American Association for Justice, in their review of the Ten Worst Insurance Companies in America, Allstate is #1 ! , if it makes you feel any better about Alfa , they are not mentioned in the 10.  My reccomendation to you is that you find a local independent agent in your area , a rather big one if you can , and see what they can come up with.  They have the ability to shop around for you and it will give you an idea as to where you may stand with your homeowners policy price.  Ask for an A-rated company only though.  Good luck with your decision and I hope you find something that works for you.|`|9k4d7Kytaa	Allstate does have a history of denying claims...but so does every insurance company.  The most important factor is what is considered a covered peril.  Ask Allstate for a list of covered perils and compare that to Alfa, or any other insurance company.  If one has more covered perils, you're better off with that company.  Allstate only denies claims when they have reason to believe that the damage isn't covered.<br>  <br>  The idea of checking with a local independent agent is good, but only asking for A-rated companies doesn't really help distinguish them from Allstate.  Those rating refer to financial stability and claims-paying ability (from the standpoint that they have the money to pay, not necessarily that they're willing to pay).  Allstate has primarily A+ ratings.<br>  <br>  I've heard bad things about Allstate's willingness to pay claims also, but that's a risk you take if you really want to save the extra premium on your homeowner's insurance.  Keep in mind though, that every insurance company (really every company in general) has disgruntled ex-customers....Allstate just seems to have more of them than most people.|`|PlIZ0ShXaa	I work for another insurer and have found Allstate to be one of the most difficult to deal with when handling claims.  They do look for ways to deny claims.  I'd stay away.|`|e9c3e42d64ceb58add3e61412e049096aa	I've never heard of Alfa.  <br>  <br>  Allstate is pretty good.|`|AA11598210	~~I have heard many complaints from people who have used Allstate.

I have had them over 28 years for home and auto, and I have no complaints. I have had several claims over the years, 2 were major home claims, and never a minutes problem with my claims.~~

acHnMNr2aa	My first thought is that, given your history, whichever field you choose, one key question your next employer will have is, are you a good member of your community? Are you a "taker" or a "giver?" Will you work constructively as a team member in your career, or will you be demanding and self centered?<br>  <br>  One great way to address this, and not at all incidentally to help with any depression and stress, especially while you're out of work, is to volunteer quite a lot. That will give you a chance to prove that you're generous, reliable, diligent, and cooperative. Giving of yourself is one of the best ways to cope with depression and stress as well. It's also a great way to broaden your networking circle to people who may be able to help you with your career. I understand (or expect, at least) that it might be a time challenge, given your baby, but it'll also give you a chance to get out of the house, and leave your wife some time alone (with the baby.) <br>  <br>  Keeping yourself busy is vital during this period, as well. At the very least, regular volunteering will help fill the employment gap on your resume, keeping away questions an employer might have like, "was he really in prison for the past 6 months?" It will also give you plenty of people for your references section who will be happy to vouch for your character.<br>  <br>  Another thing to keep in mind is that, as you know, this is likely to be a VERY stressful time for your marriage. Just keep it in mind, and keep communicating with your wife, acknowledging each other's frustrations every day. Truly, if this period doesn't kill your marriage, it will make it stronger. Talk, Talk, Talk - and more important, Listen, Listen, Listen. Even if you can't do anything about a particular irritant, the mere fact that your spouse understand and cares can be a huge comfort.<br>  <br>  My first thought as a career choice would be to pick a field that's growing. Psychiatric care is perennially underfunded, however. I'd look into health care options that will grow with the aging population. If you're a quick learner, good with details, you might get into health care record keeping, a field that will explode starting very shortly if Obama's electronic health care records drive gains funding (which seems inevitable.) If you get into a field that's growing quickly, employers will have no option but to be more forgiving of bumps in your past. Plus, since the field is new, no one will be a lot more experienced than you, so you can advance quickly too. <br>  <br>  Another sadly growing field you might consider is care of autistic kids. I don't know much about that, but it might be right up your alley, especially if you're a right brain type with your artistic leanings. At the very least, you can use your art skills to either volunteer or as an entry into art therapy for autistic care, stroke victims, perhaps brain injured vet therapy, etc. If you prove yourself as a volunteer for a few months, getting to know professionals in the field, your history may not matter any more, since they'll know what they're getting. <br>  <br>   If you don't know where to start, and you live in a reasonable sized city, you might consider just showing up at a VA hospital and saying, I'm here to help, what can I do? (At the very least, volunteering in a patently patriotic way will help with any right-wing-judgmental future boss, the kind who might be particularly critical of your spotted past.)<br>  <br>  Sorry for this sprawling answer. I hope you'll find something useful in there.|`|lBCzCQ6xaa	If you are having trouble getting hired and in need of money, I suggest that you consider working from home.

You are doing a great job getting back on track. <br>  I am not a career counselor, but a mid-life job-hunter who reads a lot. I hope I can help you. <br>  Basically, this isn't a train wreck. People with worse backgrounds than you find work every day. So relax and let's take it point-by-point:<br>  Age 15-18, time in psychiatric hospital -- I am not sure it would come up, except in regards to not finishing high school. Health records are private, and you were a minor. (You might want to run this past a legal expert or an experienced career counselor.)<br>  High school dropout -- You can find a way to explain why you dropped out without going into your private medical details if you would prefer not to. And the big plus is, you have resolved this by getting your GED. Good job.<br>  2004 misdemeanor hit-and-run -- Trickier, but not a career-killer. You need to be straightforward here and present the incident as something that happened that you learned from and how you are dealing with the circumstances now. For example, if the hit-and-run happened under the influence and you no longer drink or you no longer drink-and-drive. If this is true, i.e., you did learn and you can say this to a potential employer looking them straight in the eye, many will give you a chance to compete with other candidates. Then the issue is, when to bring this up? On the application if there's a relevant question. They often give you room to explain the circumstances. If so, use the same approach -- this happened, I learned and I took the following steps. Yes, you could be screened out. But if you don't answer the question honestly, and the incident comes to light later in a background or reference check, that will likely be the end of your chances. Or if you get hired without disclosing it, and it's discovered, that is grounds for automatic termination. So be honest even if it's hard. <br>  Repossession and bad debt on the credit report -- It depends on the job whether this would be brought up. These things would be worse for a law enforcement or financial services position than for a fitness trainer, for example. I have had bad debt on my background report and as yet no employer has brought it up. But if it does come up, again be ready with an honest explanation that frames the bad event as a learning experience. <br>  Of your chosen fields in which to earn a certificate, the last job outlook reports I've read seem to be big on health care. For the next couple of years, I would avoid any position that relies on non-essential spending by consumers -- such as fitness training. Many people see coaches and trainers as an expense they can cut when times are tight. <br>  There are several Internet articles on dealing with criminal records and background checks during a job search. You might also benefit from talking to a professional career counselor or employment law expert. <br>  Also, don't be afraid to network. Let your family and friends know what you are looking for and ask for referrals at companies you like. Coming in the door as a referral from an existing employee goes a long way to offset any negatives in your history.<br>  Don't forget, you are not the first person to have things in your personal history you're not proud of. Millions of people have made mistakes, overcome them and gone on to successful careers. And many of them are now bosses with the power to hire.  <br>  You have done a great job pinning down your interests and researching those fields. You seem motivated to get moving in the right direction, so go forward and don't let fear keep you back. I wish you the best of luck!
7rKUmK0qaa	i also have a misdemeanor. Hit and run w property damage but they only gave me 1 yr probation to maintain good record which it was easy for me to do because all my life i had clean record. I dont even have parking tickets. Anyways, I just got enrolled in a school. I'm taking Respiratory therapy. Its not as strict as nursing. I called the state board to ask if I can obtain a state license eventhough i have a misdemeanor and they told me yes. It will take awhile to get my exam date because they have to verify my record and get an explanation from the court. They said as long as theres no person, drugs, robbery, criminal charges involved I should be fine. But I have to finish my probation, any obligation to the court and fees/fine before I can take my state exam. Eventhough I will expunge my record they will still see it because state licensing is strict and they do extensive background check up but as for applying a job, once i expunge it they wont be able to see it...<br>  <br>  You should try Respiratory therapy or Radiology technology because I called the state licensing place and I got a thumbs up.<br>  <br>  Goodluck...|`|Ge6LrNGDaa	<a href="http://allininfo.mooo.com" rel="nofollow">http://allininfo.mooo.com</a><br>  A very informative website you can also get much information in website

One site that I personally use and love is free to join, unlike most 'money making sites' out there. <br>  <br>  Basically what you do is fill out free surveys and offers, and they pay you to do this. They pay around $.25-5.00+ depending on whichever one you do. You can do as many as you like and there are hundreds to choose and do from. There are other ways to earn money on the site, such as referring friends, or participating in their rewards program and earning points to get prizes. <br>  <br>  I personally make around $150-200ish extra a month, that's on the low side and I don't do it everyday...there are stay at home moms though and other people with a lot of time on their hands that does make over $1000 a month. If you'd like to see proof of payment and read more about the site that I use you can visit my website.

Many lenders got burned lending to speculators and flippers and that was when things were going right.  <br>  <br>  Let's see why - put the shoe on the other foot.  You had $300,000 lying around and someone came to you with a 'can't miss flip'.  What would you want to see from them to be willing to part with your cash?  Maybe a track record of successul flips?  Some experience?  Some indication they had a clue about the value, the cost to do the flip, the current real estate market in the area, their contingency plan.  What else would you want before you handed the cash over?  Most of the profit?  <br>  <br>  good luck!  <br>  <br>  ps - now is a crappy time to be looking to flip!|`|1zWMTtZUaa	In todays market, you don't.

On each of your past jobs include a small sentence describing what your duties were on that job so you help the web site use key words in your resume to match you up with an employer.<br>  Are you a veteran who served on active duty for at least 180 days? If so,most states give first pick on all jobs to veterans.|`|80b8cc51687afa4b940b8a3d2bef0a46aa	BBB registered only means that they registered with the BBB.

d1431527582f8f414e0e05855712ef5faa	What you have to understand going into this is it is YOUR business. While you have to work under a Broker, they are only there to support and supervise you.  You have to prospect daily for business, you have to be able to take being rejected or told no. You have to have some level of income to pay for all the business needs you'll have.  <br>  <br>  As for asking questions, "What is the hardest thing they had to do to prospect for business?", How long did it take to have a viable business making a regular income that would support their lifestyle?" What is an average months costs to operate?  Just a few questions.  I hope I have helped. Some folks think I'm too direct or negative. I just want to relay the facts as I know them.  I've been a Realtor for 20 yrs. Licensed in 3 states.  I know a little about the business.  Take care!

Then sell it with more time, at a different price and start playing with the revenues.<br>  - Start buying articles in large quantities and sell it at detail.

You can gamble by buying penny stocks or options, but if you do not know what you are doing you will lose your money quick. <br>  <br>  I would suggest contributing regularly to a retirement account that can invest in stocks and mutual funds.

ww12lItvaa	It is real money so it is not "play". <br>  <br>  In my opinion you started out with exactly the correct question and attitude. <br>  <br>  First, you need to perceive the difference between investing and speculating. <br>  <br>  Speculating is buying and selling stocks over the short term to try to profit from short term changes in price. This is higher risk and more difficult. In essence you are competing against others trying to do the same. <br>  <br>  Investing is buying a share of a company to profit from the money the companies earn over the long term. This is slower with much less risk. <br>  <br>  Even for my investing the goal is to look for investments with the highest return for the lowest risk. This doesn't only mean low risk. It means seeking the highest reward potential for the risk you take. <br>  <br>  I think managing risk is the most profitable way to look at investing. Most only work to try to maximize return and ignore risk, then lose too much at times like this last year. <br>  <br>  If you keep "managing risk" (again not trying to eliminate risk but profit from it) rather than hunt out the riskiest highest returns you will do well.<br>  <br>  But you have a lot to learn. And most that start out investing invest in mutual funds and let the professionals pick the stocks and manage the risks.<br>  <br>  Good Luck|`|AaoclPYCaa	Have you been watching the market lately?

Take note that estate taxes are to be paid in order for the property to be transferred to the heir which is why other people also look at executing a deed of donation before death as donors taxes can at times be less than estate taxes.

NcFWcO3Laa	This is basically a scam.<br>  <br>  Does it sound logical that a person that owns a home that has value will lose that house just because of a few years of back taxes?  First of all, if the property has a mortgage there is no-way that the bank will allow this property to be lost due to back taxes.  The lender would step-up and pay these taxes.<br>  <br>  The only properties that are lost like that is bare land when the owner discovers that the property is basically worthless.  No water, no utilities, land locked by other parcels without any legal "right-of-way" to get onto the parcel.  I've seen owners try and give these worthless plots away to a charity just for the tax deduction.  The charities refuse them because they don't want to be responsible for the taxes either.|`|7Q7dFghmaa	Those are just the sale prices. You are responsible for any back taxes on the properites.

3mAgM405aa	Here's a short list of jobs in the U.S., Canada and Europe which you can create to generate income:<br>  <br>  1. Learn calligraphy so that you can provide handwritten invitations and thank you notes to prospective wedding parties, birthday celebrations, etc. Seek out clients through wedding planners at nearby churches and temples. A starter calligraphy kit usually runs around $20 and anyone can easily pick up this skill. The going rate is usually $1 per hand addressed item.<br>  <br>  2. Seek from your neighbors a gardner position which involves planting, weed removal, plant/tree trimming, light brush clearance. You will be using the neighbor's equipment and tools. Again, do not represent yourself as a lawn mower since there are any number of safety issues involved. A door-to-door solicitation of surrounding neighbors is required and you can charge between $6 to $9 per hour.<br>  <br>  3. Offer policing/removal or clearance of trash services to surrounding neighbors which involve trash pickup within nearby residential area. Limit the extent of pickup to small areas and be aware that there are no hazardous terrain or elements involved in this process. Again, a door-to-door solicitation of neighbors is in order. You can charge between $6.75 to $7.50 per hour.<br>  <br>  4. Acquire a set of window cleaning tools [a bucket, liquid window cleaner, sponge, squeegee, handle with an extension and a small step ladder] and solicit local businesses for your window cleaning services. However, be careful to limit the height of the window cleaning to no higher than one story. Charge $1 per window panel.<br>  <br>  5. Visit your nearest beauty salon and ask to be trained as a shampoo person who is also willing to sweep up fallen hair on the ground and do set ups [arranging dye kits, curler holders, etc.] for a set hourly fee.<br>  <br>  6. Become a sign flipper by contacting your nearest realtor. A flipper is someone who stands at a major intersection and flips a "For Lease/Rental" sign in order to attract visitors to an open house or to a particular real estate listing. The hourly pay is at least the minimum wage.<br>  <br>  7. Why not become a paid feeder servicing the disabled at nearby nursing, convalescent, assisted living/care centers and hospitals. It involves feeding food to patients who are unable to feed themselves. The starting rate is $8.00 per hour. The only downside is that one has to take precautions to wash one's hands after each feeding. A posting of your services [by a business card or flyer] on a reviewable bulletin board would be enough to generate customers. The paid feeder position is one of the fastest growing occupation at this time.<br>  <br>  Good luck!|`|ek1193Qiaa	if you want to start your own business then you would have to get a license from the government<br>  <br>  just ask your neighbors and stuff if they would like you to walk their dogs and before you give them back you will give them a bath and stuff like that so maybe they will pay you a little bit more|`|fl0dj2AYaa	babysitting.<br>  -old school way is to go around your neighborhood with your flier and just go door to door telling them you are willing to do those chores for them.<br>  -most neighbors will be happy to help you out.|`|BuJIQ8Jhaa	I worked in a fast food career when I was 15, I got paid fifty cents an hour.  one of the perks was you could eat all the food you wanted.

I am looking for the opportunity to perform in this capacity for Ganco Engineering.  I believe my background and experience will help me be an asset to your company in a very short time.<br>  <br>  I have conducted survey and mapping assignments, participated in soil mechanics and foundation formation, and performed preliminary structural analysis and design for a grocery store.  I was given the responsibility of producing a general lay-out for a new transportation system.  I first surveyed the area, produced a traffic analysis and survey, researched city rules and regulations for compliance, and wrote a twenty-five page report depicting the feasibility of building a new freeway off-ramp. My mathematical skills are excellent and I am very conscientious about meeting deadlines and completing tasks unsupervised.  If given the opportunity to accomplish an assignment, I can develop a plan that will meet the needs of the project.<br>  <br>  I am very interested in becoming a part of this project after reading your company brochure and an article in the Civil Engineering Journal about your company’s involvement in building a new mall in the area.  I can be reached at the address and phone number below.  I’ll be calling your office within ten days to inquire on the status of my application.

Meanwhile the owner has all his kids on staff... and they make three times as me and don't come into the office EVER.<br>  <br>  I guess I am extremely bitter because I made this guy over 20 million dollars last year- our company is doing great money wise but instead of giving me a cost of living wage raise- he bought his wife a new car and a cruise ship for himself.

mwkfirjRaa	If you are salaried and exempt from overtime pay, then they cannot charge your vacation time if you leave early, arrive late or leave for a time in the middle of the day.  As long as you work part of the day, they have to pay you for the whole day.  They cannot charge a partial day to your vacation or sick leave.<br>  <br>  You can confirm that with your state's wage and labor division.  They should have information for registering a complaint, as well.<br>  <br>  Here is an excerpt from the Texas site that pertains to your case:<br>  <br>  Circumstances in Which the Employer May Make Deductions from Pay<br>  Deductions from pay are permissible when an exempt employee: is absent from work for one or more full days for personal reasons other than sickness or disability; for absences of one or more full days due to sickness or disability if the deduction is made in accordance with a bona fide plan, policy or practice of providing compensation for salary lost due to illness; to offset amounts employees receive as jury or witness fees, or for military pay; for penalties imposed in good faith for infractions of safety rules of major significance; or for unpaid disciplinary suspensions of one or more full days imposed in good faith for workplace conduct rule infractions.

It might have been the ex but could have been anyone who had knowledge of their names, birthdates, and SSNs.  (I certainly would not be the first time that an ex lied about this!)  In this case you must file a paper return by mail.  The IRS will then investigate the matter and will award the exemptions according to the law.  This will delay any refund for several months while the IRS does their investigation.  You will win out in the end.

MmTe8W8uaa	If you are single, have only one job, and have no dependents, you are supposed to put 1 on the W-4 for your highest paying job and 0 on the others, for a total of 1.  You are NOT supposed to put 1 one each of the W-4's, for a total for 3.  The total number to be put on all W-4's for any one single person without dependents is 2 if the person has only one job or a total of 1 (NOT 1 per W-4) if the person has more than one job.<br>  <br>  The reason that you owe is because you put 1 on all 3 W-4 forms, when you should have put 1 on only 1 and 0 on the others.<br>  <br>  The stimulus is not the reason.  No one owes more this year because of the stimulus than they would if there had been no stimulus.  In some cases, a person might owe more than if the amount that the software says that they would owe if they had not received a stimulus that others received, but not more than if there had been no stimulus at all.<br>  <br>  Having more income (either because of having more jobs or because of making more money at one job) will result in owing more.<br>  <br>  Having less withheld for taxes (either because of making less at each job or because of W-4 decisions) will result in owing more.|`|ds1RoS80aa	The stimulus was not a factor.  Having more than one job was probably the reason.  Essentially, withholding is calculated based on the assumption that each check is from your only job.  If you get paid every other week, the withholding would be based on an annual income of 26 times the amount of that check.  So assuming you worked at all three jobs at the same time and made the same amount at each job, you had the withholding of someone who made $6,000 per year.<br>  <br>  If this will continue in the future, I would recommend that you adjust your W2 to have an extra amount withheld (on line 6).|`|4ZNl4V3Oaa	Of course it does!  The more that you make, the more you owe in tax.<br>  <br>  The problem is that you had multiple jobs and did not have enough tax withheld from any of them.  Each employer assumes that that job is your only job and withholds taxes based upon that assumption.  It's up to YOU to fill out your W-4 properly to make sure that enough tax is withheld.  <br>  <br>  If you have multiple jobs you should ALWAYS claim 0 and very possibly will need to have additional tax withheld to cover your tax liability.  See the worksheets on Form W-4 for figuring your withholding when you have more than one job.

msNXomjTaa	You will need to calculate your taxes.  The benefits etc., depend on lots of things, including income, but also just how much rent you pay, the number and ages of kids, and so on.  You figure it all out, and get tax credits, which lower the tax you would have paid, based on the tax rate for that income level.  There is no "magic cutoff" - most of these things are graduated.  The less you earn, the higher the level of tax credit.  <br>  <br>  I earned about $24,000 for 2007 from a pension, and still ended up having to pay a bit for OHIP.  However, I also ended up getting more back than was actually deducted, so the credits helped me.  For 2008, I was working, so I expect I'll get fewer credits, but as my income was still fairly low, I just might get a little.  Just not nearly as much.

rC6gL7KOaa	Save 10% of each check. Wow, you make triple my salary!|`|4Jy8Hioiaa	Without knowing you, It sound like you have a good outlook and attitude towards your financial world. The more you save the better off you will be in the long run. The best advice I give people is the same thing thing my wife and I practice. There is a gentleman out there by the name of Dave Ramsey. He can be seen on the Fox Business Channel at 8:00 and midnight. He has an absolutely wonderful program on personal finance and long term investment. My wife and I read his book, The Total Money Makeover and We can not begin to say how much of a positive tremendous change it has made in our lives. It talks about emergency funds, paying off debt, saving for a house, paying for kids college, and long term investment. We save and invest about everything we can. This does not mean we do not have a life though. We pay cash for everything and do not have credit cards, car loans, or student loans. It is a fantastic feeling knowing that we do not owe anyone anything and our retirement years will be fabulous. I know with you being only 24 that retirement seems like a long way off. It will get here before you know it. If you establish a good finfncial plan now and stick to it, you will retire with millions and be able to do anything you want anywhere you want. Dave has a good common sense video about 24 min. long at his website. It is www.Daveramsey.com. I would check it out. With your seemingly positive attitude towards saving for your future, I am confident you will do very well. Good Luck.|`|AA10362098	You're making good money. You will need to put a good % of that money away to reduce your taxable income and save for retirement.<br>  <br>  I would start with 20%, split into 2 different accounts.<br>  <br>  Also, make sure to contribute the max to your company's 401K.<br>  <br>  Check out Suze Orman on PBS stations, or pick up one of her books for clear cut advice.|`|rpVQpJA7aa	I would put in about 15%. Do you have a 401K?|`|D4XWrwuaaa	You should save (in a very safe way) 10% of each check.<br>  <br>  Don't count your 401K or other investments in the 10%. This 10% should be either in savings or in an investment where it is very secure (not likely to be lost) and also some of it should be in some sort of investment where you can access it in an emergency without a penalty (which is why having everything in a 401K is a bad idea because it costs you a penalty to access your money).|`|wcOq60Hhaa	The rule of thumb is 7% in a diversified portfolio from age 25 to retirement will afford you a comfortable retirement.<br>  <br>  If you are putting it all in the bank (rather than a stock market mix), you will need a minimum of 12%.<br>  <br>  In addition you should be saving at least another 5% every year for non-retirement savings -- this will ensure that you will not ruin your retirement plan in a few years by borrowing or spending retirement money for life's necessities and occasional emergencies.
zKabhExVaa	I'm a Realtor too.  The real estate market has been hit really hard in these economic times.  Clients are looking for the strongest negotiator and experience.  That sucks that your mother lost her clients, but commission isn't paid on a transation until the deal is closed.  Also,  in real estate, agents can get really screwed.  There are tons of rules/regulations for buyers and sellers, but when it comes to agent/broker relationships the broker has the upper hand, and rememeber ultimately any commission no matter what is the brokers commission.  Agents work for their broker.  You could take your broker to small claims court ($2500 or less) for commissions, but ultimately the broker will fight it and most likely win.  Unpaid commissions are becoming quite frequently these days.  I recently severed from a Century 21 office because I didn't receive my commission.  When signing up with new brokerage I found that several other agents experienced the same.  Hopefully, what goes around comes around!  Good luck.|`|TpMvr1pyaa	as my peers mentioned, she needs to look at her contracts.<br>  <br>  is she a sub agent?  a listing agent?<br>  a buyer's agent?<br>  <br>  if she is not sure, she will continue to lose $|`|23SkYEw5aa	lose 10k?

If they sell within that time period, or even a little after, she's entitled to receive her commission.<br>  <br>  If contract is expired and it's more than 30 days, then she's out of luck.  She has a responsibility to keep her clients and to find out why people are leaving her.<br>  <br>  I'm guessing, her clients are upset that there houses aren't selling and blame her.  While unfair, that's the nature of the business.  She should look for ways to better the chances of a house sale or, at least, to have her clients understand that it's the market and not her.  Houses DO continue to be sold, but it takes a creative agent to make it happen.|`|qBCGH52haa	Depends on how they left and whether the houses sold to someone that had looked at the house while she was still the realtor of record.

Get pre approved to buy then get with a realtor that comes recommended to you and they will have a list of foreclosures|`|EXJfoGtAaa	You search foreclosures by contacting a local Realtor.  Banks do not sell their foreclosures (called REO) directly, they list them with Realtors.  The risk is you are buying "as is, where is."  While most banks will accept an offer subject to an inspection, they will not permit the buyer to cancel based on the inspection.  That's the risk.  Hold firm with that requirement and if one bank won't accept that condition, move on as they are many to choose from.<br>  <br>  realtor.sailor|`|912184e16e910db90a6979b2d6ebeeb9aa	I purchased my first home in 2008. It was a forclosed home and a HUD home. I found a HUD realtor by driving through a neighborhood I liked and spotting a home for sale with the realtor's name and number on the for sale sign. I didn't even know what a HUD home was. The realtor directed me to the local HUD website that featured foreclosed homes. The main concern is WHY the house was foreclosed. Your realtor should know this. Some houses are abandoned because there is water damage or structural damage that the owner didn't want to repair. You want to find a house that has nothing majorly wrong with it. The house I bought was taken away from the previous owners because they were out of work and couldn't make the mortgage payments (the house only had minor problems). One disadvantage of buying a foreclosed home is that they're sold as is. I had 48 hours to turn on the utilities and have an inspector come and look at the house. I had to sign a form stating that I understand that any problems that arise will be my full responsibility. Another major disadvantage that I encountered was that there was a lien on the house title and I had to wait 14 WEEKS(!) for it to clear. Apparently, the title company that originally did the title work for the foreclosed home was suppose to clear the title of all liens, and missed one. My realtor and the title company she used fought for weeks to get the title cleared. The advantage is that the final purchase price was $52,000 less than what the previous owners purchased the house for 10 years ago! My monthly mortgage payment is less than the rent I was paying on my previous one bedroom apartment.|`|75a51a8a2488a3df797e37d0a25b999caa	As long as it passes all inspections it should be ok. Some foreclosures do have a lot of problems but I think right now the thing you will find the most is that there isn't really anything wrong with the house---the people just couldn't keep up with the payments.<br>  <br>  To look for foreclosures you just need to call a realtor and they can give you a list.|`|ikXRqWxUaa	no offense, but if you don't know the answers to this, you would be better off getting a real estate agent that has experience with REO (if you don't know what the means, you definately need one).  they can be good deals, but there are many things that you should take into account, such as location (do you want to buy a home in the middle of cocaine alley, or on a street where every other home is boarded up?) and condition (many of these homes are sold "as is".  you definately need a home inspection to get you out of a bad deal).|`|d1431527582f8f414e0e05855712ef5faa	Tanya, you would be wise to find a Realtor to work with if you plan to purchase these types of homes. Are they safe, in some cases not. You could buy a property with expensive issues to resolve.  You search for the most experienced foreclosure Realtor.  <br>  <br>  You need patience, lenders take their time answering offers. You have to understand that most lenders won't make repairs. You have to have down payment money and money to have an inspection.  You should have reserve money for emergencies in the future. While the furnace may work today, it could break down weeks after you close and you would have to pay to have it repaired.  Owning a home is a big responsibility and needs regular maintenance which costs money.  Not to mention, when you buy a home, who doesn't want to fix it up, you paint, your buy curtains, etc.  Owning a home is not a right, it is a privilege that comes with some expensive price tags.

068da96fea8eeeaba520500cc53ce481aa	it sounds like everything has been checked and title search etc done, but typically the appraisal is ordered and done before the loan is sent to underwriting.  check to see if indeed they have received the appraisal, why cant this be faxed.  when i bought my home the appraisal was done before my loan was even sent to the underwriter, they must have the information about what the worth of the house is before they approve your loan (i would think).   if all they are waiting on is a paper and everything else is in order, they should be able to fax it to the lender so they can close your loan.  hope it happens soon, waiting is murder!|`|AA11173563	very common as lenders are asking for the sun and the moon and the stars before they send a dime|`|EXJfoGtAaa	I hope the seller has approved these closing extensions in writing or you could be in for a surprise.

Regardless of how nice their attorneys might seem....just remember, accepting advise/guidance from debt collector attorneys is like Tweety Bird accepting advise from a lawyer that was paid for by Sylvester the Cat....get the point?<br>  --------------------------------------...<br>  Before you cut any checks....it's my understanding that a repo stays on your credit report for 7 years....even if it's paid in full.<br>  <br>  If you are dealing with the original creditor AND they give you a confirmed written agreement that they will remove this from your credit report, then this might be pursuing....Just be careful though....debt collectors have all sorts of tricks up their sleeves. Never accept settlement deals/promises from debt collectors over the phone without a written agreement. Verbal promises over the phone that are not backed up in writing are worthless....If you do this, they will deny that they made any promise to delete the item from your credit report once they get their money.  There's a big potential for being ripped off here so be careful.  I would have an attorney draw up the written agreement.<br>  <br>  If this is a 3rd-party debt collector making this promise....remember that the original creditor can still report the repo even if the debt collector removes their notation..which will leave you with bad credit after paying back all this money.|`|WiqvHzl1aa	Get a letter that says they will agree to the deletion if you pay. <br>  <br>  I have two on my credit, the first one already came off after 7 years, and the last one..well it's still there. <br>  <br>  I owe like 6 grand, I think I just got screwed, I refuse to pay it. It's been 4 years and they want me to settle for a grand.

DorePwVOaa	Not exactly. It will not effect your score any, as long as you continue to pay on time. But, if you balance increases, making it larger than what you normally charge in a month, that will decrease your credit score.<br>  <br>  For example, if you have a credit limit of $5000, and you normally charge about $1000 a month and pay it all off, you have a debt-to-credit ratio of 1000/5000, or 20%. But if you start carrying a balance, that will change, if you keep charging things to your card. So if your balance is at $2000 after two months of spending, your debt-to-credit ratio is now 40%, which will cause your credit score to drop a little.<br>  <br>  In other words, your best bet to maintain your credit score if you're just paying the minimum payment, is to not charge anything new to your card until you pay it off.|`|MmTe8W8uaa	It does not directly hurt your score.

AA11960743	I feel awkward answering this question, since I relied on the URL provided by the first Answerer in order to answer it.<br>  <br>  However, this is what it says there: "1. A gain or loss from the disposition of shares or a debt obligation such as a bond, debenture, bill, note or hypothec will be taxed as either an income gain or loss or as a capital gain or loss."<br>  <br>  So, it would appear that your loss will be considered an income loss rather than a capital loss, since day trading is considered to be your profession.<br>  <br>  Also, you cannot deduct losses from  your personal income if you operate thru a corporation.|`|kGJND4lYaa	Day trading is regular income, per the CRA interpretation bulletin here:<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.cra-arc.gc.ca/E/pub/tp/it479r/it479r-e.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.cra-arc.gc.ca/E/pub/tp/it479r...</a><br>  <br>  You are deemed to be engaged in the business of trading, therefore are self-employed, and must report the income on Form T2125, Statement of Business or Professional Activities.<br>  <br>  You will also pay CPP contributions on Schedule 8.<br>  <br>  If your intention is to derive your principal income from day trading, popular wisdom would suggest forming a corporation for the more favorable tax treatment.

It all depends who you're getting in business with and what you want to do.  Most all of them are sales and relationship based, there are others that aren't, but IMO you stand to make the most and do the best with the relationship/sales organizations.<br>  <br>  The people you get in business with are far more important than the actual company.  You don't want to get involved with the best company out there and just be left off at square one.  You want people who have been around for a while and have the level of success, or greater, than you want to achieve in that business.  That's what you have to be watching out for.  For instance AmWay is a great company, it's one of the best companies for work at home.  Their product range is huge, their compensation plan is the best, they've been around for over 50 years, etc.  However, there are some people out there what are trying to build this business who are less than honest about it, there are others who just don't have the type of success you may want, and then there are others out there who are exactly what you're looking for.  So as described above, getting into AmWay with any of those groups can have you experience range from it being a scam to it being the best thing you've ever done.  Investigate the people you are getting into business with before deciding to do it or not.<br>  <br>  I've personally found a very good group of people to get involved with, if you're interested in finding out a bit more about who we are, what we do, and how we do it, shoot me a msg and I'll be glad to point you in the right direction.|`|7wcuuAwiaa	Ameriplan? has been my dream come true...

uOTBBmNqaa	It differs from Swoopo because it lets you apply the amount you have already bid towards the item if you don't win, and with Swoopo you just lose the money you have bid. This is from their press release: <br>  <br>  <br>  February 16, 2009 - WWW.BattleBidz.com introduces a new type of bidding war auction to North America with all bids starting at $0.00 and only increasing in increments of $0.01 per bid with no reserve. WWW.BattleBidz.com differs from the extremely popular British and German penny auctions in that www.BattleBidz.com is operated with truly a NO RISK auction format due to the fact that all users that do not win the particular auction they are bidding, will have the opportunity to purchase the exact item from the BattleBidz web store at MSRP less the amount that they have already committed to the auction. <br>  <br>  How does www.BattleBidz.com work? There will be various items on the site available for auction. Examples of available name-brand items are: <br>  <br>  ? LCD TV’s and Accessories <br>  ? Laptops and Cell phones <br>  ? Camera’s and Camcorder’s <br>  ? Game Consoles and Games <br>  ? Luxury vacation packages <br>  ? Luxury Automobiles and Boats <br>  <br>  Each auction will have a timer that indicates when the bidding will be closed. Upon closing of the auction, the system will indicate the final bidder and that user wins the item for the price last bid. All products will start at $0.00 and will increase $0.01 with each bid, additional time will also be added to the auction with each bid placed.
4Jy8Hioiaa	Typically, refinancing to save 1/2 % is not worth it once closing costs are rolled in. Yea, you would save some money but considering how long it would take you to pay off the closing costs with the monthly savigns 1/2 % gets you does not really make it worth while.<br>  Personally, I would look into a 15 year mortgage. The rates may be low enough to make it workable, depending on your income of course. The average cost varies depending where you live. You would have to ask your banker about their costs. <br>  I personally have a 15 yr at 5.5% and about 40% through paying it off. I know the rates are a little lower around my area. We could probably get 4.75% if we wanted to add all that time back on to the loan, but that would just be a stupid thing to do just for 3/4 % savings. I was just thinking about whether the bank would float a 9 yr mortgage at a reduced interest rate. If that were the case, I might be able to keep the same term length but still reduce my payment. I certainly do not want to pay these guys any longer than I have to. Good luck.|`|AA11173563	depends on your loan and how much you put down.

5IpvNaW0aa	You can find the answer to this on pg. 57 of your text. <br>  <br>  The first grouping, the profitability ratios, allows us to measure the ability of the<br>  firm to earn an adequate return on sales, total assets, and invested capital. Many of the<br>  problems related to profitability can be explained, in whole or in part, by the firm’s<br>  ability to effectively employ its resources. Thus the next category is asset utilization<br>  ratios. Under this heading, we measure the speed at which the firm is turning over<br>  accounts receivable, inventory, and longer-term assets. In other words, asset utilization<br>  ratios measure how many times per year a company sells its inventory or collects all of<br>  its accounts receivable. For long-term assets, the utilization ratio tells us how productive<br>  the fixed assets are in terms of generating sales.<br>  In category C, the liquidity ratios, the primary emphasis moves to the firm’s ability to<br>  pay off short-term obligations as they come due. In category D, debt utilization ratios, the<br>  overall debt position of the firm is evaluated in light of its asset base and earning power.

That and spending too much. Maybe I would start paying off debt asap and start looking around for jobs in my field.

xK5lWU3qaa	It is possible for you to qualify for a mortgage loan long before the bankruptcy comes off of your credit report, which will be 10 years from the date that you filed. A bankruptcy is discharged approximately 4 months after you file it, so if you filed your bankruptcy in December of 2008, you should expect discharge papers around March 2009. Your bankruptcy must be discharged before anyone will give you any kind of credit at all.<br>  <br>  Having said that, two years post-discharge is a generally accepted principle as far as a mortgage after bankruptcy is concerned. This would place your eligibility right around March 2010. Your required down payment and interest rate may not be particularly competitive though. This is especially true during rough economic times such as now.<br>  <br>  An FHA loan may be perfect for you once your bankruptcy has been discharged for 2 years. Typically the interest rates are comparable to market rates and the loan only requires a 3% down payment.

If that works out, then your credit history will have no impact at all, but the key is that the bank will only consider her income, job history etc.<br>  <br>  If you have to include your income in order to qualify, then the bank will also look at your credit history. You should expect to pay higher rates and possibly have higher down payment requirements and/or higher PMI premiums since you have a bankruptcy that is only 2 years old at that point. The higher interest rates and insurance rates may make your payment much higher than the $900 you are using in your estimates. <br>  <br>  Don't forget, that your payment will include property taxes and homeowners insurance, plus the utilities are higher when you own a house because you pay for things like garbage service, sewer, etc, which you normally don't have to pay for in an apartment.

If your discharge has been granted, then you can keep the money and use it to start over, assuming you listed the potential settlement in your bankruptcy and the trustee "abandoned" it.  If you didn't list it but had reason to know of the possibility, please see a bankruptcy attorney at once, as there may be a potential for criminal fraud charges if you don't reopen the bankruptcy and pay the money in.|`|AA11173563	they must report it to the trustee of the court as to just how much they got as this is now an asset
OHs8yJiOaa	Many can get on things like unemployment and food stamps to try and survive, especially since the government is likely to extend benefits beyond what would normally occur.<br>  <br>  Assuming things occur in pockets, people can coordinate with neighbors, former co-workers, etc. to assist each other with survival needs, buying food in bulk, moving in together to share residences, etc.<br>  <br>  Whether or not people go bankrupt largely depends on whether or not they have debt obligations they can no longer meet. If that's credit card debt, it doesn't take long -- just a missed or late payment or two -- for them to spike interest rates, and once that occurs, it's just a matter of time. The card operations see spiking rates as providing incentive for people to pay things off, but if they don't have the money, it backfires and puts the debt out of control. The card companies are happy to keep getting their very profitable minimum payments indefinitely, however, or at least until someone finally realizes they can never pay it off. They really couldn't care less if they force people into bankruptcy--it just gives them more control.<br>  <br>  It's families with elderly relatives who've now lost retirement nest eggs, or who are incurring medical expenses perhaps without insurance, or who are simply renters, etc., who could really be in trouble.<br>  <br>  Anyway, the average man/woman who starts throwing things at credit cards and getting into trouble might go a year until they realize they're not actually going to dig out and break down and declare bankruptcy.|`|dRj9FoHzaa	There are always jobs out there.

If you add in things like I have had, medical expenses for surgery, a new furnace for the house (mine had flames shooting out of it), and taking time off for surgery without pay, only to loose job when I returned, NOT LONG!!!!!!  My furnace cut my savings almost in half, and add about 2 months worth the bills and Christmas to boot, I was close to going into under, well closer than I would like. I am like many americans when I say I think it will get a lot worse before it gets better.  Hope I am wrong.|`|hNa5oHxQaa	I have been unemployed on 4 different stretches.

Then I spent about half of 2006 unemployed and started with $11000.  That year I spent a lot of money like a breadwinner.  Then parts of 2007 I was unemployed with $2400.

7rKUmK0qaa	as long as their visible you will get turned down but who knows some places probably will accept you. When i went to nursing school i wasnt allowed to have any visible tattoos.<br>  They do this because of personal hygiene and professional appearance. Some people think tattoos are unprofessional and offensive and some dont thats why they require you to cover your tattoos especially when you go through clinical, the school wants you to be perfect. It has something to do with their credentials and accreditation.<br>   If you can cover them then theres no problem.<br>  You're not even allowed to have visible piercings except for the ears of course.  Most of these strict rules you go through schools but when you actually work in a hospital they are less strict but there is a higher chance you will still get rejected.<br>  Goodluck..|`|EzrdyxAiaa	well i am sorry to say that in 90% of the interviews you will be rejected -- they will not use the tattoos as the reason but they will come up with something to hire some one else!!!  hopefully if you was or insist on doing both you find of the 10% that will understand and overlook the tattoos!!!|`|f52fc4f706a5d932f2a7ba4e6d13b0d4aa	Well, I know they hire some people with tattoos, where I work.

6fd619e75209a1428b2faa60df4dd045aa	Globe Life sells allot of accident only life. They offer cheap rates on higher benefit amounts. You must understand that with accident only plan vs. term life , your benefit pays your beneficiary only if you die because of an accident and you hav to die at the scene not later in the hospital. It is less likely that you will die at the scene than because of illness or pass later on. For this reason the rates are better for higher coverage.|`|x3eXOSs5aa	No.  You would be better off getting term life insurance from a reputable company.  Globe normally sells children's life insurance and whole life insurance type products.  No life insurance is a good investment.  Life insurance is not supposed to be an investment.  Get term life insurance to insure your life (you can get a large amount of coverage for a very small premium because you are only paying for life insurance not a savings or investment plan), then get mutual funds or a plan made for investing only as an investment.|`|d305138b3a4d89bb9a20a75933040915aa	Insurance is NOT an investment, it's insurance. Do not mix the two. Globe sells insurance to parents, on a child in case that child dies. Insurance should be based whomever is bringing home the bacon. In other words, why purchase a policy on a child who makes no money? If he passes away, sure it's a tragedy, but no income is lost.

This housing lasts as long as you meet the income requirement for staying there. <br>  <br>  Section 8 is where you landlord accepts a voucher for part of your rent, as long as your landlord accepts this, you can live there, and you can choose where you want to live.

You will still have to pay a security deposit, if required.

cp30vrVoaa	You have reached a point where your kitchen is becoming too small. That's an excellent reason for a small business to branch out, regardless of the economy. If your product sells well you seem to have some solid ground to work from.<br>  <br>  As a general rule, don't branch out  too much and don't expand too quickly. Grow it slowly, adapt to the market situation and stay flexible. Don't lock yourself in too much. Stay reasonable.<br>  <br>  Good luck!|`|Vq8Szjs9aa	So, are the increased orders that you can't fill (due to your current location) extensive enough to cover your added expenses if you move to a retail location?  If not, how much revenue would you need to generate to cover all operating expenses?  If not, do you have the extra capital to float your business until the orders are adequate enough to cover costs?<br>  <br>  If you're simply working out of your house and are getting significant orders than you might consider where your clientele are coming from.  Are they referrals?  Are they word of mouth?  If so, will the referrals increase enough to cover the added costs of being in a retail location (lease, insurance, overhead, etc)?  If you don't believe so, what will you do to increase your retail sales once you are in the new location?<br>  <br>  For the record, now is an excellent time to start a small business.

ymqWa8GNaa	This is the right question.<br>  <br>  Obama seems to have one skill - drawing people together for meetings at which he pontificates. He sees no connection to follow-up action, only talking about action. <br>  <br>  Obama does not understand the economy, business or the markets. Why else would he sign the largest spending bill in history 5 days ago, then today pledge to reduce the federal deficit within 4 years. Both cannot coexist.<br>  <br>  Obama needs to wake up, smell the coffee, and demonstrate leadership with a plan of action. Not allow Pelosi and Reid to built fat, lobby-laden bills with gimmees to pay off those people who helped to elect him. This behavior is even more anti-American in the face of what we're dealing with...<br>  <br>  Example of poor leadership: Calling a press conference with Geithner addressing the global financial community about the Treasury's new banking plan, and then Geithner coming on television and saying, "we're working on a plan". This tells us three things, all of which are bad.<br>  <br>  1. Obama and Geithner don't have a plan (real bad)<br>  2. Obama doesn't review the presentations with key cabinet members before they take the world stage (almost incomrehensible for any leader, this is unfathomable for a President)<br>  3. Obama doesn't understand the importance of not "winging it". (In other words, not realizing that the Presidency is about accountability, not endless campaign rhetoric).<br>  <br>  How we can put ourselves into this much debt with so little planning to create jobs is amazing. The fact that Obama continues to sound the doom and gloom alarm tells us all that he is using this situation for political gain, rather than seizing it head on and solving it. We need a leader, not a showman. <br>  <br>  I pray for him often as our President. I'm very disappointed, though, thus far, with his preoccuaption with the spoken word, and no follow-up on accountable action. He is giving all of the signs that he flat out doesn't get it - which is even more disturbing.<br>  <br>  As for those who want to continue to blame other things on others, rather than listen to reason - whether voters or the President - the time for that is past. Wake up and realize we have a mountain of a problem on our hands and we need to get to work, not churn out more pork from a Democratic-dominated Congress.|`|bnJPvsVWaa	Not until after he's funneled most of the scamulus funds into his private army...I'm sorry...national civilian defense force.  Once the majority of the funds, which were set aside for other governmental functions, are either not paid out or partially paid out, he'll be ready to work.  As things spiral further down, there will be more strife, more crime, demonstrations, an increase in the homeless, and people fighting for food.  Then he can declare martial law and 'save the day,' never, of course, to return to the way it was.<br>  <br>  Or, does the fact that States are getting $15B for medicaid help you eat and pay your bills at all?|`|AA10472839	You hate Obama.

The markets would go down either way. Its not what his saying.<br>  <br>  EDIT: Squeaky. You're making it sound as if the nationalization is going to be the cause of the failure of the stock market. If the banks aren't nationalized, after these major profit hits they've taken. how long do you suppose they will last?<br>  <br>  Nationalization will keep them running at least.|`|dDeGZdwyaa	The talks about nationalization were just rumors, obviously he knows what would happen|`|NauMcvTvaa	Totally AGREE...George Bush already did!|`|Ch9TedMcaa	Do you have a plan to get everything going again?
bY58V3oraa	Wealthy Affiliate teaches you everything you need to know about affiliate marketing aka internet marketing.  Here's how it works.  You sign up for affiliate programs.  For instance, I am signed up with several affiliate programs (dell.com, sirius, comcast, etc.).  There are a ton of companies that have affiliate programs.  You get a special link to promote via your website, blog, article, etc. and when a customer clicks on your link and makes a purchase, you receive a commission.<br>  <br>  I've been affiliate marketing for three years now and I love it!  Now, it does take a lot of time and effort on your part but if you keep at it and you want it badly enough, then you can make as much money as you want.  I work a full-time job and have a family so I can't invest the time into affiliate marketing that I'd like to but I am consistently making an extra $300 monthly and I'm seeing more and more traffic to my websites.  I know if I could do it full-time, I'd be making a lot more money.<br>  <br>  I pay the monthly fee of $39 ($29 if you pay for a year in advance) to be a Wealthy Affiliate member.  They teach you everything, and I mean everything, you need to know to become a successful affiliate marketer.

97a7d25a569ecc28c857f02a34b7fd9baa	I spent my entire first semester in college job searching.  At your college, see if you qualify for an on-campus job.  If so, take the job.  otherwise you'll have to job search off campus.  Go to all the supermarkets, restaurants, stores, coffee shops, bookstores, in your area and ask them if they are hiring.  Our economy is bad right now, and a lot of people are getting laid off, but still try.  Even if a supermarket or a restaurant is "accepting applications" still apply.  Theres always employees quiting and getting fired.  It can't hurt to apply for a job.  <br>  <br>  Job searching is one of the most difficult things to accomplish, but don't give up.  Deffinetly try and get an on-campus job, and see if your college has a job/career counceling office, they can give you advice.|`|ujyNVBFMaa	You can earn extra money online by participating in GPT sites (Get Paid To). One site that I personally use and love is free to join, unlike most 'money making sites' out there. <br>  <br>  Basically what you do is fill out free surveys and offers, and they pay you to do this. They pay around $.25-5.00+ depending on whichever one you do. You can do as many as you like and there are hundreds to choose and do from. There are other ways to earn money on the site, such as referring friends, or participating in their rewards program and earning points to get prizes. <br>  <br>  I personally make around $150-200ish extra a month, that's on the low side and I don't do it everyday...there are stay at home moms though and other people with a lot of time on their hands that does make over $1000 a month. If you'd like to see proof of payment and read more about the site that I use you can visit my website.

For someone with only a college degree and grandiose thoughts of $15/hr jobs in the most expensive city in the US... you're in for a hard (and expensive) lesson.<br>  <br>  The NY-area is not cheap. North Jersey isn't so much better that you could afford to live there either. You could definitely find a very dangerous part of Brooklyn and get a place in the projects but that's usually avoidable when you're not from the area and you have no job tying you down. <br>  <br>  Retail shops aren't hiring, they're firing.

Let's face it, a BA is barely enough to get a position that pays more than $8/hour.<br>  <br>  Be honest with yourself and stay wherever you are presently. NYC isn't just some fantasy that you can dream hard enough and turn it into reality. If you can't afford well over $3000/month (which a job paying $15/hour would not allow) then you can't live in the city.|`|AA11966821	There is no way you can survive in NYC on $15-20/hour.  Rents on a studio or one-room apt in not-nice neighborhoods can run $1500/mo. plus utilities.  Plus you have to pay federal, NY state and NYC income taxes!  NYC is one of the world's toughest job markets and a very expensive place to live.  It is also a long, grueling job to find an apt, and you will go through thousands of dollars a month while you apt hunt.  Then you have to find a job when there are 1000 or more applicants per opening.<br>  <br>  Moving to NYC without a job and plenty of cold, hard cash is asking for the sky to fall on your head.

kifwyOgKaa	Debit card probably means a debit card transaction you did yourself.<br>  <br>  It's not the bank's fault that you can't keep up with your balance and they are not obligated to hold transactions until you make a deposit.  Furthermore, debit card purchases can not be returned by your bank unless you sign saying they were unauthorized.|`|AA11173563	it is used just as a check. If you present a bad check to a merchant and the deposit it with out you hhavingthe funds to cover it the bank charges you a fee|`|T6V9zXymaa	I'm not sure, but it sounds like you might have a problem I've been dealing with myself.<br>  <br>  I recently switched banks. My original bank updated almost all of their transactions immediately, so if I paid for something online or went to a store and paid by debit, the transaction went to my account right away. However, my new bank seems to only update transactions on the next business day (or later) which can be confusing.<br>  <br>  With that said, most banks these days will allow you to have a negative balance and STILL make charges or initiate debit transactions. I have yet to hear an official reason for this, but personally, I feel it's so they can charge you excessive fees for overextending your credit/going below a zero balance.<br>  <br>  A great example is my new bank:  they charge $36 for EVERY charge/debit when I have a 0 or negative balance PLUS $8 per DAY if that balance remains below 0.<br>  <br>  I recently overextended my account by 13 cents ($0.13) and paid almost $200 in late fees and daily fees!<br>  <br>  I understand, especially with the economy what it is these days, that it's not always easy to balance your accounts. I wish you all the best personally and with your finances.|`|EDiJe38Taa	Did you USE it as a debit card (i.e. put in your pin before the transaction)? Or did you use it as a credit card? If you used it as credit, the bank lets the transaction go through if you have money to cover that amount at that very moment. Even if you have pending transactions that will make you overdrawn. It is your responsibility to keep your account balanced, not your banks. It is best to keep a tally of your running balance, deduct your purchases immediately after you make them, so as to better know what your true balance is.|`|Xs1XPLfcaa	Just as everyone has written. A debit card takes the money directly out of an account.  It is not a line of credit.  <br>  <br>  The banks get to charge you fees for the overdrawn account.  That is the real reason a bank lets these transactions go through.  You should be able to keep track of your money better, but the banks have little to loose by letting more than a few transactions overdraw your account. <br>  <br>  Ask about overdraft protection or linking to another account!
eDVzT3I8aa	Where I live the landlords can only increase the rent by 4% in a year; check with the landlord and tenants act for your state/province.|`|2N6oTOLQaa	When your lease expires your landlord can raise the rent to any amount she wants to. Your options are to either pay the higher rent or move out. <br>  <br>  You can certainly ask the landlord to maintain the rent where its at, but if she thinks she can find another tenant to pay a higher rent then you're probably out of luck. Sometimes landlords will give you a little bit below market if you have proven to be a good tenant by paying on time and not complaining about every nit picky little thing, but that is entirely up to them.|`|TpMvr1pyaa	unless rent controlled, yes|`|MmTe8W8uaa	Disregard all of the answers prior to mine.  They are clearly from persons who do not know the very unique situation in New York City.<br>  <br>  1. If the apartment is either rent controlled or rent stabilized, then the landlord will almost certainly raise the rent by the maximum that the law allows, possibly more.  If 10% exceeds the amount allowed by law, then you can go to court.  If the law allows 10%, you can ask for whatever you want, but the landlord will say no.  This applies even if the landlord is not able to find someone else willing to pay more.  NY's quirky laws allow the landlord to charge more in future years (after the economy recovers) if the rent is raised now and again later than if it is not raised now.  If you are not willing to renew the lease at the amount that the landlord is requesting, then you must give the amount of notice of your intent to move that your current lease requires.<br>  <br>  2. If the apartment is neither controlled nor rent stabilized, then the landlord can raise it as much as the landlord wants.  You may ask for whatever you want.  The landlord may say no.  If the landlord does not agree to your request and you are not willing to renew the lease at the amount that the landlord is requesting, then you must give the amount of notice of your intent to move that your current lease requires.|`|AA11132354	ASK your LL not millions of yahoos.<br>  You can ask LL anything, and attempt to negotiate anything.

If it's a prime apartment ideally located, you are going to pay a higher premium.  If you feel that you can get a better deal somewhere else, I don't see where it would be unfair to tell your landlord that.  Did you get into your apartment on some kind of move-in special?<br>  <br>  I work in property management here in Michigan.  Our rental rates have not increased in about three years.  We do offer residents who are interested in leasing an apartment for a longer term a break, just as we would charge residents who want a six month lease a premium due to the fact that after their lease is up, they have the option to move out and we will have to turn the apartment again (paint, clean, replace carpet, repair any damage) which in turn costs us additional money.  I don't see why they wouldn't want to keep a good resident vs. taking a risk of vacancy loss.|`|lFR1YxzSaa	This really goes back to the supply and demand along with current rates in your area.<br>  <br>  If you can get a bigger apartment for less money then you shouldnt have an increase.<br>  <br>  You can certainly offer whatever you like but it is just that an offer and they do not have to consider it if they don't want to.<br>  <br>  Good Luck!
etV271ARaa	Are you seriously interested? You'll need a lot of contacts to be successful as an event planner. Why dont you go work in an event planning company for a few months? Then register a business and print cards and go to all the wedding studios, hotels, clubs, halls etc etc and tell them you're open for business. Tell everyone that you'll cut them in on the profits if they send anything your way. And keep your word. Tell the wedding studios and hotels etc that if they distribute ytour cards, you'll most definitely have the functions there. <br>  <br>  Like that. Its all about networking. You dont need to reveal that youre new in the business. Just act professional and try to partner with someone who has been doing this for a while. <br>  <br>  To secure business, its all about marketing. But if you screw up a few times, you'll be ostracised and you'll need another business idea. So be carefull especially on the first few.

Usually (espeically for this type of position), they will just want to know where you were employed.  They may call to see if you were, infact, employed there...but cannot comment further unless you state them as a reference.

If your employer is interested in your working relationship with him, the interviewer will ask. Provide honest answers, but don't get overly involved in the question.

9b9f75545eba3c982f4a21bb3a585952aa	As an investment!???  Are you crazy???....as a lifelong Chino resident, trust me when I say that the opportunity to invest in this area is LONG gone.  The housing prices in this community alone has gone down by hundreds of thousands of dollars in the past few years.  The place is nice, but it is being hit by foreclosures left and right because Chino is not an area that can support $500,000 houses.  The prices in that area will continue to decline and it may take 20 years to hit those 2007 highs again.  In the meantime, you will be paying inflated property taxes and they have insane association fees.  These two items alone can cost you up to $10,000 per year assuming the price of the house does not fall one more cent.  Sorry, but the investment days of the Inland Empire were over last year!
AA11173563	Banks market their REO's through realtors. All realtors have web sites or mls listing sites call one|`|tdQTZPI7aa	First off only 9% of mortgages are in foreclosure.  Only 4 states have an abundance of vacant homes.  A foreclosed home is put on the market usually at the amount still owed on the mortgage plus 10%<br>  You do not have to pay for a listing.  Just check with the local realtor. That is how the mortgage lenders lists foreclosed homes|`|5e4e7e69ebfb2ce16276f743ee45219eaa	But what does "at cost" constitute?  If the bank lent someone $200K to buy a house and the person only paid $25K of the loan back and it cost the bank $20K to foreclose on the person then the bank is still out $195K.  Market value may only be $150K at this point, so the bank will lose $45K by selling at market value.  <br>  <br>  You can find bank owned properties on the fannie mae website (for free).|`|RkfIPD7Iaa	No, it's stupid that you WOULD pay for a listing of properties.  Any realtor can provide you with local sale listings for nothing.<br>  <br>  Banks do dump their properties as quickly as they can, which means as cheaply as they can.  They are required, though, to make every effort to get 'fair market value' for the property, so they cannot sell them for nothing, nor would they want to.

02965963da3f0165b81bd488737cfad3aa	I trade extensively on e_bay, mainly as a seller.<br>  <br>  When you buy, you enter into a contract to pay for the goods. When  you sell, you enter in to a contract to send the goods to the buyer.<br>  <br>  It is possible for a seller to acquire counterfeit goods without realising that the goods are fake.<br>  <br>  The seller has refunded you what you have paid, and, were I the seller in this case, I would not expect the goods to be returned, as there is no use in re-selling counterfeit goods (unless one is a scumbag seller). I would also feel obliged to refund the postage that you paid for returning the goods, which, in business terms, would entail a double loss - i.e the refund for the goods and the refund for your return postage - this is commercial suicide.<br>  <br>  The problem with this transaction is not with Paypal - it should be raised with e-Bay directly. Also.print off all e-mails from you to the seller and those received by you from the seller - it sounds as that you are now being submitted to harrassment, which is a criminal offence and can be taken to the police.|`|4l0yGuE9aa	The address of the sender should be on Paypal in the history section. Remember that the address that Ebay gives is not always up to date with the address listed on Paypal. Because the transaction was made through Paypal then Paypal covers the transactions and the buyer and seller's actions. Use the Paypal address.<br>  <br>  What you need to do is get the address from Paypal. You need to send it back and also request a signature from only the person that sold you the item. Keep proof of signature. You can actually call Paypal on the phone and talk personally and give them the tracking number.<br>  <br>  You must follow Paypal's guidelines exactly or they may freeze your account. Keep records of everything and forward all Ebay emails to your personal email account because I believe after several months Ebay automatically removes old emails.<br>  <br>  If this person sold the item to you as an original and you recieved a replica then the person selling you the item misrepresented the item and you are entitled to a full refund.|`|AA11808995	The bag is a fake,you have your money back.It is now up to the owner to collect the bag from your address at their expense.Alternativly ask for shipping costs and an address to return the bag also your out of pocket expenses.Allow the person 30 days then inform them that you intend to dispose of the bag Follow this and you have no legal liability at all..|`|KJMEomouaa	She sounds dodgy..you'll probly find she's signing on & making a bit of money on the side or something like that..for her to have two addresses and to be reluctant to give the one from paypal - there has to be some reason she is getting defensive..<br>  <br>  I would consider getting some advice, maybe from the police.. hope all sorts itself out...x<br>  <br>  ..just a random thought, you could ask the police whether you could arrange to post the bag to her local station - then tell her to go collect it ! :)|`|kykmpr0Caa	i would class that as threatening behaviour, get her contact details through ebay and send it to her recorded delivery with insurance, get all the documentation you can from the post office and go to the police yourself. <br>  <br>  dont worry about it|`|fce67c6faf9b1d4b041b262e35a15d36aa	Well that sounds like a threat to me .. id go straight to Ebay and paypal and bring a dispute in with her as shes refusing to give you the propper address to send it back to ! ..good luck x|`|PU3ynPsdaa	check her feedback,has anyone else complained about sellers dodgy goods.if they are selling copies they wouldn;t want to provide their home address[probably full of snide goods].as for the threats,dont lose any sleep over them.|`|mgGr2SjTaa	contact your local police station and ask there advice also the seller is commiting an offence by selling fakegoods and this is the reason they probably dont want to give there real address.say this to the seller that you are going to call the police regarding this and see what happens as long as you have kept your emails proving you tried to return it theres not much can happen to you|`|LwywrSRkaa	Oh gosh!

4UBxVIYFaa	You can never change the amortization period specified in your mortgage contract.  If you take a thirty year mortgage, your amortization period remains a thirty years, according to contract.<br>  <br>  That being said, any payment amounts in excess of your required monthly mortgage payment will be automatically applied against principal reduction.  Accordingly, if you make payment amounts monthly in amounts roughly equivalent to those of a fifteen year mortgage, your mortgage WILL be paid off in roughly fifteen years.  The only difference is the interest rate charged.  Thusly, with a slightly higher interest rate on a thirty year, you might make two or three more payments to finish off that mortgage.|`|tdQTZPI7aa	Take the 30 year.

AA11966821	If you do a short sale, you have to pay the difference between the sale price and what you owe.  If the bank/mortgage holder "forgives" the difference, you have to pay income tax on that amount since it becomes "income," therefore taxable.<br>  <br>  So how are you going to buy another house when you have bills (possibly huge) to pay, and wrecked credit by doing a short sale?  Where's the down payment coming from then?  And what on earth is the "benefit" of short-selling one house and buying another with all the attendant expenses of selling one home and buying another?  This becomes so costly you are better off paying your existing mortgage, even if at present you are upside down in your mortgage.|`|m9LaR4HFaa	Very good question.  I believe that there may be many reasons that a person may want to do what you are asking.  The most obvious reason is that for example: you owe 500k on your home and your neighbor 2 doors down(same floor plan or similar) has just sold for 300k. Lending got us into the troubles we now have and will not lend that way again for quit some time(1-2 decades). With that said you are living in a bad investment that will take 1-2 decades to recoup. If you do not LOVE your current home maybe a short sale is just what you should do and buy your neighbors house and at the very least shave off 200k of debt.  As far as having to pay the difference in amount owed to the amount sold for,I believe that you will not be taxed .  The IRS has said that it is going to forgive this for good if it is done before the year 2012( but make sure to check on this). If you only have a 1st mortgage it is much easier but if you also have a 2nd you may be able to settle( through the short sale) for a much lesser amount. I hope this helps.|`|RkfIPD7Iaa	I don't see why you would qualify for another home for several years.

tbFI2XJeaa	Create a list of what you want to include on your resume. For best results, you'll need to keep your resume to one page, so you will need to prioritize and focus on what is most important to write on your resume. <br>  <br>  Choose a template, or create a layout for your resume. It will help you define how much space that you have to work with. Don't be afraid to make the page margins smaller if it will help you fit everything onto one page. Feel free to use a small font, but not a font that is so small that it becomes unreadable. Stick to basic fonts, because when you start using fancy fonts, you risk that the person opening your resume attachment does not have that font, which can mess up your spacing and sizing. <br>  <br>  Enter your name, address, phone number and email address at the top of the page. Make your name a bit bigger and bolder than the other information so it catches the reader's attention. Below that, skip the objective line in favor of skills. I say to skip the objective because skills are more valuable, and skipping the objective keeps the resume more versatile. For example, when applying for an HR job and an advertising one, you can use the same resume when you don't have an objective, but you would have to define a different objective for each resume. <br>  <br>  List your recent job, or jobs, next. If you've been at your current job for a very long amount of time, simply list that one job and all of your responsibilities there. If there is room, list jobs you had before that one, but don't add details. If you've had several jobs, list each job with a few key responsibilities of each. Always use simple, understandable wording, and keep your responsibilities in bulleted form. Do not use paragraphs. Your resume should be an easy read, and bullets are easier to read. <br>  <br>  Make sure to keep your tenses and wording consistent. For example, do not say:<br>  - Create spreadsheets<br>  - Writing documents<br>  - Supervisor for floor staff<br>  <br>  You want to say:<br>  <br>  - Create spreadsheets<br>  - Write documents<br>  - Act as supervisor for floor staff<br>  <br>  Also, make sure that your punctuation is consistent. You can't have periods in some places but not others. <br>  <br>  Add your education. If your GPA is lower than a 3.0, don't list it. If it's higher, go ahead and list it. Also, add any professional associations or affiliations. <br>  <br>  Have a friend proofread your resume. Spell check is good, but won't know if you wrote "moral" vs. "morale." Spelling and spacing errors are a major turn-off, so try to avoid them as much as possible. <br>  <br>  Make sure your resume looks good online, in an email, or printed out. When printing your resume, print it on strong, heavy paper for the best presentation. Present it to possible employers in a folder, if possible, along with a portfolio if your work (if applicable). Remember, presentation is everything, and that folder and heavy paper can put you a step ahead of your competition.|`|DArAz67Caa	put that you have a sturdy relationship with God and Jesus-----it helped me land a good job once-----the manager turned out to be very Christian like I am---they both make a very good reference---

5BTKscZraa	Two big mistakes were made here (sorry)<br>  <br>  1) NEVER, EVER give debt collectors your checking account/bank routing numbers for making payments. Once they have this info they can take out any amount at any time and getting your money back can be very difficult. Giving a debt collector this info is like giving the keys to your front door to a burglar. <br>  2) Get all terms of any settlement deal you reach with debt collectors IN WRITING BEFORE you give them your money. This letter should state the settlement amount and that the account will be settled/paid in full upon receipt of this amount from you.<br>  <br>  If it were me, I would cancel my checking account immediately. I would renegotiate and get a written agreement first...then make arrangements to pay ONLY with a USPS money order. <br>  <br>  * Debt collectors love to create a false sense of urgency...If they’ve waited months/years for your payment, they can wait one or two weeks for any payment or settlement agreement from you. Any “deadline” like 5PM to get any payment to them is bogus. <br>  *  By themselves, debt collectors have absolutely NO legal power over you., they cannot garnish your wages or freeze checking accounts...only a court can authorize this and they’d have to go through the court system to do this.<br>  * Debt collectors have NO power whatsoever to have you arrested/sent to jail for not paying them.|`|qSl0QAPqaa	i would close my acct or at least make sure nothing was there. im curios to see if they honor there end of the agreement. if they do withdraw funds could you add that info to this question?

You deposit your money with the bank for a pre determined amount of time. During this time, the bank will pay you annual interest for depositing your money with them.

Otherwise they may do it a few hours later or perhaps the next day.. It will depend by what method they pay. If they pay by cheque then obviously they'll have to send it to your and you'll have to get it and then wait for it to clear.. That's why most people use paypal which will clear a payment pretty much instantly!<br>  <br>  If you've got anymore questions or need anything else cleared up, I'll be happy to help!

jZMDYsVOaa	I make my strategy using these rules which i have set it out for my self.<br>  <br>  MACD rules on the 15 min chart.  Even if MACD is, say, trending up on the 1 hr chart, if it is trending down on the 15 min chart, that’s what you take your cue from.  That’s not to say a shift in price direction is not in the works.  It just means it’s coming, but not yet.  In the meantime, you don’t want to miss what’s happening “in the now,” which is what is reflected in the 15 min chart. <br>  <br>  If MACD is trending down on the 15 min chart, and price is wanting to go north, price will sooner than later head south as it perhaps bounces off a pivot point, or gets turned around at a juncture caught by one of the other three “tools” you should be using (“reading bars,” MACD divergence, or trendline analysis).  Same thing if MACD is trending up, and price is trying to head south. <br>  <br>  Only use MACD for divergence, not for buy or sell signals.  It is a lagging indicator, and as such is useless as a trigger.  It is too slow for that in the forex world. <br>  <br>  Again, MACD divergence on the 15 min chart is more significant than what you see on the 1 hr chart in the near-term.  For those of you who don’t understand what divergence means, keep looking at my own personal forex trading examples on this page on a daily basis for examples of divergence.  Basically, what it means is where you see MACD waves “waving” in the opposite direction to price action.  That’s why I connect the top of the waves (in a downtrend) and the bottom of the waves (in an uptrend) to illustrate that the waves are “waving” higher in an uptrend and lower in a downtrend – in the opposite direction to where price is going. <br>  <br>  Always “protect” your money by using 20-30 pip stops.  Mental stops are okay, but not if you are dead serious about using a “disciplined” approach to managing your money.  You will lose three out of ten trades.  The three losses should be kept to 20-30 pips.  Your wins will by far surpass your small losses, and that’s what stop-losses are all about.  Don’t be afraid to lose.  Even professional batters strike out six out of 10 times.  Lions are only successful 20% of the time in their chase for the kill.  Professional golfers lose 95% of the time.  Professional poker players lose 50% of the time.  So, your chances are better at trading the forex, using my system of course, than in any other venue.  Even businesses have “bad inventory.”  And, life in general is not always “100%” for sure.  <br>  <br>  Hope this helped you too for better understanding of MACD lines. Even i dont hold a large account i started my live trading with just $25 with www.finexo.com and right now i am holding $100 capital account. <br>  <br>  Regards

In the US, you can generally only be harassed if it is directly related to your race, gender, religion, age (40+) or national origin.

You can go directly through a private attorney and you may later decide to go through the EEOC which is a disgusting long process.  If it is a strong enough case there is no reason to go through the EEOC who only take on a small handful of cases and those they decide to litigate themselves is for self-serving purposes to some degree and the case must be so overwhelming that the grounds are "...causing public harm."

I disagree with all three of those answers.  And I'm sorry . . . the LAST person I would trust is an HR manager.  <br>  <br>  You have what's called administrative remedies.  You must exhaust all administrative remedies before running to a lawyer.  You may have a lawyer take your case, but it will be weak and you will lose.  <br>  <br>  Let's say "Bob" is harassing you.  He calls you a jerk in front of your coworkers.  Notice this has nothing to do with your race, your sex, your religion, etc.  He's just a bully who likes to intimidate people because he can.  If Bob is your coworker, your first administrative remedy (AR) is to formally complain to your immediate supervisor.  Put your complain in writing, citing dates, times, instances, circumstances.  If your supervisor does nothing, then you go to the manager, up the chain of command.  <br>  <br>  If your supervisor and your manager and your department head will not solve the problem -- which by law they must to YOUR satisfaction -- THEN you go to HR.  HR must resolve the issue to your satisfaction; if they do not, they can be liable.  <br>  <br>  If you do not give the company a chance to alleviate the problem, you are vengeful and vindictive, and you were not interested in resolving the problem as much as you were interested in taking them for some green.  All of this will come out in your depositions -- the Q&A session between lawyers before you get to trial -- and your case will not be strong. <br>  <br>  However, if you waltz into an employment lawyer's office with a diary of events; i.e., every instance of harassment, plus formal complaints up through your chain of command, finally to HR -- THEN when the company has done nothing, BEFORE YOU QUIT OR GET FIRED, hire an attorney.  Then your case is strong.  Without giving your company a chance to make it right for you, you will lose.  <br>  <br>  Make sure you document ALL conversations with everyone.  When you meet with HR and they tell YOU to straighten up and fly right, send a confirming email to HR saying Followup of our meeting of 2/12/09.

The ten or twenty years does not start until there is NO activity on the account.<br>  In the beginning did you try to contest the debt with the three major companies who create credit reports?  If you do stop making payments and they do find you, perhaps that should be your course of action.  They need to prove the debt.  If you do not remember it, probably it is a mistake and you should not be paying on it anyway.
TcMa4a7paa	Not sure if this is what's going on, but it's possible:<br>  <br>  Ebay will ask you to bid your MAXIMUM bid, but will not necessarily bid your maximum bid.  (Your maximum bid is the highest amount you are willing to pay for the item.)  Also, are you positive that the current bid of $12.50 belongs to the other person and not you?<br>  <br>  For example:<br>  <br>  Let's say that the other bidder "Sally" put in her maximum bid of $12.00.  This means that every time someone else bids less than $12.00, Ebay will automatically trump that bid with "Sally's" bid and will continue to do so until the bid reaches $12.00.  However, if you put in a maximum bid of $20.00, then Ebay trumps "Sally's" bid with yours by making it $12.50 .  Ebay will continue to keep bidding for you until the bid reaches $20.00.  If someone else bids higher, you lose... Unless you bid again for a higher amount.<br>  <br>  You can also go to your My Ebay page and it should tell you if you are winning an item.  Good luck.

dRezbY31aa	The above answer has some good points. First, don't buy off of the internet because it'll take you nearly forever to read the fine print in all of the policies available in AZ. <br>  <br>  Buying health insurance is like buying a new car. When you shop for a car you have a choice between the basic low end model with no options, a fully loaded luxury car, or something in between. Health insurance is the same. If you shop for the cheapest you'll get the basic low end model which may or may not have the benefits and coverage you are looking for. For example, Blue Cross has 4 different $500 deductible policies for a 21 YO male in Tucson ranging from $93 to $161 (Phoenix will be higher). Visit an agent that works with all the major companies in your area. The agent can find the best plan for your situation and budget and can explain what you get and, more importantly, what you won't get with the plan. There is no extra charge using an agent.|`|RNqRnG86aa	You need a trusted adviser to help you through the process of purchasing health insurance so that you understand what you are purchasing. Some may suggest going on line to get a quote but you probably already know that there is much more to health insurance than price. Some might even suggest a discount plan which is not insurance at all.<br>  <br>  Ultimately, you are the one who determines the affordability of your health insurance plan by deciding how much you will participate in sharing the cost of your health care with your insurance company. <br>  <br>  If you choose a plan that covers everything i.e. doctors office visits, prescription drugs, preventative health benefits, maternity coverage as well as low deductibles, low copays and optional vision and dental benefits your monthly premiums will be significant.<br>  <br>  On the other hand because you are young, healthy and presumably use the health care system rarely you could consider a plan that covers only the major health catastrophe which will result in a relatively low monthly premium. You then can use the monthly premium savings to pay for the occasional doctor visit and still come out ahead.<br>  <br>  Check with the agent that writes your home or auto insurance he/she can provide you a health insurance proposal that takes into account your budget and health status. They can answer questions as to what is and is not covered by the policy, explain deductibles and copays and show you the hospitals and doctors that participate in the network. <br>  <br>  Use the Internet to educate yourself but use an agent to purchase the coverage.|`|0lCnu1g2aa	Best advice is read the fine print. I baught insurance off the internet ( google health insurance) and it was called Golden Rule from United Health Care. It was like $56.00 a month, GREAT!!!!!!<br>  <br>  Well I ended up in the ER with a gallbladder attack and was discharged since the pain stopped and I did not see the point of staying in the hospital in a bed I did not need. Anywho, came home at 3:00 Am and went to bed. Got up next day, read the plan and found out that they would not pay the bill for the ER visit because I was not admitted to hospital.  Called on Monday and found out that was indeed true. Mind you I had chest xray, labs out the wazoo, EKG and a CT scan done (the bill ended up over $8000).  Thank god I could still go under COBRA from my previous job, $400 a month is better than insurance that is useless. I called the hospital billing dept and had the payer changed that Monday afternoon after I paid the COBRA premiums. <br>  <br>  Bottom line is READ THE FINE PRINT CAREFULLY!!!!!!!!!!|`|x4swYdoUaa	If you are in college, you may want to check out health insurance programs that are written through your school. United Healthcare has a plan available at many US schools. These student injury and illness plans provide wide ranging coverage and are designed to be affordable for college students. To check if your school is participating, go to www.UHCSR.com and enter your school name in the search box. You might also be interested in joining the American College Student Association (ACSA), a national organization for college students. They have lots of member benefits, including student health insurance. Their membership fee is affordable.

It is somethhing like $12 or $13 a paycheck. <br>  <br>  I guess we'll have to party on down with such a large increase of money.<br>  <br>  Very little of the "Stimulus plan" goes to stimulating the economy or cuts for us working people. Most of the money is spent on long term projects starting in 2010. Guess they don't quite understand the stimulus comes from the words stimulate which would require immediate action.

If you have a credit it will be added to your refund (or reduce what you owe).<br>  <br>  BTW, most tax software for 2008 automatically calculates the credit, and if your preparer was worth his salt he took care of it for you.<br>  <br>  If you don't see a difference in your refund, go back to your tax preparer and have him calculate the credit to see if you actually qualified for it.  You can always talk to someone @ the IRS after they have processed your tax return.|`|Daq9gituaa	There could be several reasons you may not have gotten the stimulus payment in 2008 or perhaps you may have forgotten about it.

In order for the IRS to calculate for you, you would have had to enter "RRC" in the appropriate line of the tax form you used.

Here are few tips i read on net which would surely help you to understand this market well.<br>  <br>  1. Implement a trading plan.<br>  <br>  “If you fail to plan, you plan to fail”. A trading plan is especially crucial in Forex trading to stay ‘in-control’ against the emotional stress in speculative situation. Often, your emotions will blind and lead you to the negative sides: greed causes you to over-ride on a win while fear causes you to cut short in your profits. Hence, a well organized operation has to be predetermined and strictly followed.<br>  <br>  2. Trade within your means<br>  <br>  If you cannot afford to lose, you cannot afford to win. Losing is a not a must but it is the natural in any trading market. Trading should be always done using excess money in your savings. Before you start to trade in Forex, we suggest you to put aside some of your income to set up your own investment funds and trade only using that funds.<br>  <br>  3. Avoid emotion trading<br>  <br>  If you do not have a trading plan, make one. If you have a trading plan, follows it strictly! Never ever attempt to hold your weakened position and hope the market will turn back in your favor direction. You might end up losing all your capital if you keep holding. Move on, stay within your trading plan, and admit your mistakes if things do not turn as you want.<br>  <br>  4. Ride on a win and cut your losses<br>  <br>  Forex trader should always ride till the market turns around whenever a profit is show; while during losing, never hesitate to admit your mistakes and exit the market. It is human nature to stay long on loses and satisfy with small profits – this is why as we mentioned earlier that a strictly followed trading plan is a must-have.<br>  <br>  5. Love the trends<br>  <br>  Trends are your friends. Although currency values fluctuate but from the big picture it normally goes in a steady direction. If you are not sure on certain moves, the long term trend is always your primary reference. In long run, trading with the trends improves your odds in the Forex market.<br>  <br>  6. Stop looking for leading indicators<br>  <br>  There aren’t any in the Forex market. While some firms make a lot of money selling software that predicts the future, the reality is that if those products really worked, they wouldn’t be giving the secrets away.<br>  <br>  7. Avoid trading in a thin market<br>  <br>  Trade on popular currency pairs and avoid thin market. The lack of public participation will cause difficulties in liquidate your positions. If you are beginners, we suggest the big five: USD/EUR, USD/JPY, USD/GBD, USD/CHF, and EUR/JPY.<br>  <br>  8. Avoid trading in too many markets<br>  <br>  Do not confuse yourself by overtrading in too many markets especially if you are a beginner. Go for the major currency pairs and drill down your studies in it.<br>  <br>  9. Implement a proper trading system<br>  <br>  There is hundreds of trading systems available on line. Pick one that you are most comfortable with and stick with it. Stay organized in your trades and fully utilized stop-loss or limit functions in your trades.<br>  <br>  10. Keep learning<br>  <br>  The best investment is always the investment on your brain. Without a doubt, Forex trading needs much more than just a few guidelines or tips to be successful. Experience, knowledge, capital, fortitude, and even some help of luck are all crucial in one’s success in the FX market. if you lose in a trade, do not lose the experience in it.

Establish Stop Loss : Before making any forex trade what soever, decide before how much you're willing to lose and you just follow that amount. Set a stop loss level before entering a trade and place it as soon as possible. Never alter your stop loss if your position is losing.<br>  <br>  <br>  2. Let your profits Run : Never let your emotions govern a trade. Keep in mind why you are entering the market and of course you follow these reasons. You'll be less emotional, you will be better. Do not turn your trading plan, move your stop loss as the market moves in your favor and let your profits run.<br>  <br>  <br>  3. Do not influence them : You must have your own forex trading strategy and you will comply. If you are influenced by others, you change your mind so incessant, learn to ignore the outside once you have made your choice. You will always find someone who can give you a logical explanation to take a position opposed to yours.<br>  <br>  <br>  4. Keep sizes and positions within acceptable limits : Forex Traders have a real success when they know that trading is a game of probabilities, and in long term if you stick to your strategies and you implement healthy strategies that you follow, it is likely that you will succeed. To be a successful trader, you will never take a position that could jeopardize substantial capital. In fact, you will find only very rarely win trader risk that more than 10% of its capital in a trade, and 10% is already extremely high. For example, if you deposit 25, 000 USD from your trading account, your maximum loss should be USD 2, 500, representing a maximum loss of 250 pips for a standard lot of 100,000 units (on a trade EUR / USD for example) . Generally, try to put more than 2 to 5% of your available capital.<br>  <br>  <br>  5. Know your risk ratio Vs your earnings ratio : The ratio of benefit / minimum risk you should use is 2:1. For example, if you are trading long GBP / USD and you want to gain 50 pips, you should not risk more than 25 pips. Another example, you should never risk 40 pips to gain 15. If you do, you lose trades will ruin your chances of profits. The analysis of risk Vs profits is an extremely important for any forex trader.<br>  <br>  <br>  6. Have a suitable capital : Always make sure you have enough credit, for example you can ask the following question: "If I lose 50% of my starting capital in a period of 6 months, can I still enable as a trader? . Only if the answer is yes you can start trading. One of the keys to success is independence of mind in the trading, which means your trading freedom must not be influenced by your fear "crippling" to lose.<br>  <br>  <br>  7. In Trend or Neutral : Learn how to analyze the forex market, is this a trend or rather neutral? In a market trend, follow the trend, in a neutral market, buy low and sell high, since you are using stop loss, and you control your risk.<br>  <br>  <br>  8. Do not fight against the trend : Do not try to sell high in a bull market or to buy low in a bear market. Follow the good old adage "the trend is your friend!<br>  <br>  <br>  9. Average : One of the most common mistakes made by traders is the continuous addition of positions on a losing position. I have personally never seen a trader profits on the long term by using such techniques. For short-term trades, preserving capital is the most important, involve too much capital will undermine your success. Trading in the short term, if your strategy is good, the market will evolve in the desired direction in a relatively short time, however if the market gives you wrong, the short-term traders will have to accept that they trade so incorrectly, gets cash losses and seek a new trading idea. Do not leave room for pride in your trading.<br>  <br>  10. The idea of yesterday is no longer necessarily valid today : Regularly we may detect a potential trade and decide to wait until the following day to see if he is confirmed. When you see that everything went exactly as you thought, remember that it may already be too late. Back over your reasoning for this trade, make sure your original reasons are still valid, if not forget this trade. There will always be opportunities for trades, be patient and attack.<br>  <br>  11. Understand how the market thinks : Everbody should accept that any information (except for newly published information that the market adjusts immediately) is already included in the price of a currency pair. You must know the indicators to come (especially the most important), and you need to know what is already anticipated by the market. The vast majority of the publications of the market is already anticipated and prices by the market.<br>  <br>  <br>  12. Trading - a game of probabilities : Nobody can get 100% results in forex trading, you must accept it. Trading is a game of numbers, you win sometimes and lose other times, the idea is simply to win more than you lose. Trading is a game of probability and if you act properly in the long term, you will come out winner.

AA10566552	To answer the first part of your question, you CAN lose your entire principal.  Any company that has a 35% corporate bond yield is trading like it is heading towards bankruptcy.  It is a pretty safe bet that without some type of additional radical government intervention that protects investors, GM will be heading towards bankruptcy or some other equivalent type of reorganization if the near future.  While GM may well receive additional aid from the federal government, it is extremely unlikely that the government will protect investors.  The good news for bond holders is that they are first in line for assets in a reorganization. Pay close attention to the classification of the bonds as it will impact your place in line for GM's assets.  Not all bonds are created equal.  After bankruptcy, the bond holders will likely become the new stock holders.  That does not mean that this is a safe investment. <br>  <br>  To answer the 2nd part of your question, you can buy put options on the common stock, but I'm not aware of any type of direct protection for bonds.  Buying puts on the stock would effectively give you some protection for your bond investment, but keep in mind that unless you match dollar for dollar, you will still be taking risk.  If you do match dollar for dollar you will be reducing your return to next to nothing.|`|wcOq60Hhaa	Yes and the 35% calculated yield is telling you that the market expects that to happen...sooner rather than later.<br>  <br>  No, not for small investors...although it is worth noting that such coverage for big investors is part of the complex financial puzzle that caused this mess in the first place.
Gun3UGzaaa	No - the IRS wants to know your whole story together.  You have to file both together.  But, you should put the withholdings for both on the form.<br>  <br>  The reason you are owing money is that you didn't have enough withheld from your jobs.  The reason why "separately" you get refunds is that a certain amount of income is exempt from taxes.  Doing two forms makes it look like you get two exemptions (which, unfortunately, you do not).<br>  <br>  When you file a W-4 with your work to get taxes withheld, it assumes you only work that one job, and that a certain amount of income will be exempt from taxes.

(Rules for state filings are slightly more complex.)<br>  <br>  If you do file with only one or the other, you are then required to file a paper Form 1040X (this form cannot be filed electronically), claim both W-2's on that 1040X, pay back your refund PLUS the amount that you would have owed if you included both W-2 forms when you filed originally PLUS interest PLUS penalties.|`|9979bb6f0e03a8d3d1be61eab96d087daa	It's illegal and if you try it, you will get a nice letter from the IRS saying that 2 seperate returns were filed for the same SS# and you will need to refile or pay a fine, then end up paying the IRS the original amount owed.<br>  <br>  Sorry, but I do taxes as my job and it's the sad truth.|`|f645ec028c19d84089f57f1c03e81a74aa	No. Each individual is to file one tax return, and that tax return should show all their income.

I was the same way (thinking negative, hated my previous job, was wanting out SO BADLY!) Guess what, I got out that job, got another (BETTER) job and they fired me at 7 months prego! <br>  <br>  I figured thats what I got for being so negative about my previous job. I learned to appreciate my job no matter what. <br>  <br>  I never thought I'd be in this situation. Be thankful, count your blessings.<br>  Theres 600,000 people that are unemployed.|`|0lCnu1g2aa	While I can understand you hate your job, most people will say be thankful you have one, especially in factory work. My cousin is getting laid off from her factory for at least a week and can barely make ends meet already, She has no cushion.  So I would say stay on the meds, and go to work, A job you hate is better than none!|`|BuJIQ8Jhaa	I used to work in a factory, we had rotating shifts Night, days and afternoons.  Change every week.   I just stayed tired for almost 20 years.<br>  There are too many knives from coworkers.  And lot's of jobs require the same motions that a robot could do better.  It's especially hard work  if you have a boss that sucks.  <br>  just hang in there as long as you are doing . and be grateful for the work.   lot's of people don't even have a job|`|mUdeM1Dqaa	Stick it out until another offer comes. This is money you need to support your family and the economy is in bad shape at the moment.

Sozc3MyFaa	Well, like everything else, you have to temper in some reality.  Yes, health care is an over-all stable job; but not all areas & not  all specialties are wide open for anyone to waltz on in.  In some areas (large cities), there may be no desperate shortages. And where the RNs are needed are on the less desirable shifts and areas.  There may be in fact quite a wait to get into the more plum jobs. New grads may have to spend their dues time in these positions as well. Nurses are still expected to work many holidays & weekends as well--so its not like the shortage allows carte blanche requests either. In some cash-strapped hospitals in my area, certain units & specialties are being shut down completely/<br>  <br>  However, it is still a good career--its just that many people have unrealistic expectations and then are sorely disappointed when there is not this big pot of gold just for the taking. Just be an intelligent job consumer & do things for the right reasons.|`|Y7ZSaTOtaa	Well first off YES nursing is really in demand the way its portrayed because of the healthcare industry itself growing with jobs that pay well and grant job security in these adverse times economically. You should read the dozens of Yahoo! articles that discuss this. Also the baby boomers are now going into retirement soon so nursing jobs are expected to expand much quicker than most jobs out there now.<br>  <br>  Secondly, what did you get your Associates degree in? I would suggest if it does not relate to Nursing at all (meaning you took very little sciences etc.) try becoming an LPN. They get paid decently not as much as RNs but they dont need four years for their jobs and they are in demand.  There with no such thing as a RN with an Associate's degree there are ADN programs to get Associates degrees in Nursing. Nurses who are RNs make about 60k-65k on average. My friend just got her Bachelors in Nursing and is working on becoming a licensed nurse in the state. She will be paid well even starting out. It took her a couple of months to get her license after she graduated. You must pass the exam in order to gain licensure.  There is a small gap of time in her case.  This is because of studying and depending when she was ready to work. Her goal is to have a job by March and it looks like she will be working by March or April.<br>  <br>  Look up these programs in your area and decide which is best for you if you are unsure consider becoming a certfied Medical Assistant because it requires less education you can become one in a matter of months as opposed to years and you still have a fairly stable career although you are not paid as much but the earnings are decent nonetheless. Or Nursing Assistant programs that are much quicker than two years again the pay is not as good but really you have to be an RN or Physician Asst to get paid well.  The downside to nursing is you work crazy hours and you have a ton of responsibility on you, although pay is very good it is actually less than what nurses should earn, only some nurses are paid extremely well depends on what type of nurse of course...nurses only get what they deserve pay wise when they go on to higher roles in administration and that sort of thing.

OmRxIg8Baa	Yes. I bought a house, paid off my car and got engaged but i plan on doing it myself next year especially with the new $8000 house credit for first time homebuyers.  I find turbotax is great since i can ask relevant questions without paying $400 for H & R Block.<br>  <br>  Just a thought, try it and if it gets to be too much then seek cpa help.<br>  <br>  congrats and good luck!|`|MvC6n3DWaa	CPA's are not a thing of the past, but there has to be a need. You can use form 1040 with itemized deductions and do fine. Follow the directions and that is 90% of doing taxes! The car has nothing to do with taxes as it is not tax deductible, unless it is for work. However, the points your paid, interest on the house and real estate taxes should place you in a nice position.|`|NsbGM74iaa	Yes.  CPA's and Accounting firms doing your taxes are a thing of the past.  You shouldnt pay anyone except for an internet filing site (which is much much less than a professional).  Slowly, the whole country is waking up to understand just how easy doing your own taxes are.|`|c533fbcbd4d1ac626e492a2604b907aeaa	I recommend turbo tax. you can downloand the software from their site, then pay to e-file. the software walks you through income and deductions step by step. All you have to do is answer their questions, and it autoomatically completes the proper forms and schedules. MUCH cheaper than a CPA|`|KHOsfLM9aa	You should do them yourself. If you are claiming the first time home buyer credit is a short form you attach to your 1040. It is no more complicated than filing single. Buying a car last year won't go on you taxes unless is a hybrid or use only for your business.<br>  Good luck|`|kdNfrpcmaa	Yes its pretty simple I like Efile.com its simple quick and all online. <br>  <br>  I hope this infor helps!|`|1021f7b7dd4b55793a7f4d6f9e547c85aa	A good CPA, Accountant, or even tax person can save you several times their fees in taxes. They know every deduction inside and out, and also are able to answer your questions as to which items are deductible or borderline. <br>       <br>       As a comparison I have purchased Quicken's Turbo Tax for the last four years and my tax person has outperformed the program consistently with a substantial difference on my return. This is the first year I did not purchase the program because I now have complete faith in my tax person. <br>       <br>       I recommend you try it for yourself for just one year: do a comparison on your refund from however you might do it yourself and then pick a reputable CPA, Accountant or Tax Person. I think you might be pleasantly surprised at how much money a professional can save you.<br>       <br>       Good luck!

They will require a secured amount of money on the books for any emergency services to be rendered. Normal amount would be $1500.00. Also be very careful to pick a large company to handle your home and do not get a flyby night outfit. That could end up being costly.

I think this is a key to finding an honest manager who won't place your repair work with someone who does shoddy work and gives him/her kickbacks under the table.<br>  <br>  For a single property, you have zero bargaining leverage and will have to take what the market rate is.  I paid 10% of gross rent plus actual costs of finding new tenants when needed.|`|LpVwWJVsaa	Look under property management.  That should give you a direction to start on.
