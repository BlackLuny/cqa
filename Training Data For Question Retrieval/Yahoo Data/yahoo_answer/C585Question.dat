They do not have health insurance. Can this person enroll in a health insurance company without informing them of the possibility of infection? Technically, this hasn't been diagnosed. In addition, aren't there privacy laws surrounding HIV/AIDS patients?      The insurance companies have no way of knowing this person had this condition because the test was 100% anonymous.       What would you do if you were in this person's shoes? Can they enroll in coverage and then get a test from their doctor?
20090128211305AAz953A	Health;Dental	Need some serious dental help!!!?	Alright well this is the deal with my oral/dental adventures..      I recently got snake bite piercings (two studs on each side of my lower lip)  please dont give me grief on that those of you who don't like piercings, thats not what I'm asking about..      I have also come to my own conclusion that I probably have gingivitis (gums hurt alot and bleed alot when I brush them) .. well this is where things get troublesome.      It's pretty difficult to brush my teeth with the new piercings, I don't want to mess with them too much and prevent as much scarring as possible, so i cant brush that vigorously, also I cant gargle with hydrogen peroxide or listerne, because it's bad for the initial healing of the piercings.. So is there any compromise I can make here?  What can help treat gingivits that won't screw around with the piercings?      I know gingivitis is much more serious than two piercings, and if I must then I will take them out :(  .. but i'm trying to come up with a compromise before I take that route.. many thanks

20090128211438AAIoUra	Health;Mental Health	I don't know what to do with myself anymore?	I'm a 19 years old girl, staying at home with family mainly siblings but parents soon coming back. I really really feel bad, and no this is not just an instantaneous feeling that I got due to something bad recently, but this feeling that I have, I am sick of myself. =( I know, I am sad. I've been depressed and not like my total full self for almost 2 years now. It's sooo hard, I missed school for 3 weeks now, not because I don't want, but since this January, the severe feeling of directionlessness and that I don't seem to care enough for things just came back.   I don't know what to do. Today I am specially very sad since my Japanese bestfriend is leaving but even still, I didn't contact her for this past month. I didn't answer her calls and now I feel like I'm a mad evil person. I want to run after her but she has possibly already left. =((( I feel like i'm bad but why would I feel terribly guilty afterwards?? And I don't want this but this is like my reaction when people and especially close friends contact and look for me. I don't feel enough. I feel like I have to fix everything first before I could come out to the world again.    My other dear friends searched for me too, but I didn't show up. I didn't answer any of their text. This past December, I somehow was able to do more things than I normally have. But when January started, I came back again to this worthless state and couldn't fully focus on things. I'm really sick of this. Sick sick of this. Lot of times I thought of just dying, I just don't know the right way. For 2 years, I've lost the most weight I have ever lost in my life and I have a totally different sleeping habit. I don't sleep at night, I sleep in the morning. And if I don't get up, I really can't for 14 hours straight.   I don't want this at all and the worse thing is that my social interactions and communication with my friends are affected. It's like nothing seem to matter to me. But they matter to me, that's why I'm writing this. I don't feel like a normal being.    For a week now, I disabled my phone for CALLS and txt msgs can't come in since I haven't freed enough space. U see, I find it so hard to finish, as in finish, a thing. I'm so behind school I don't know what to do. The problem is even if I get back on my feet after some time, I always get back to this miserable, wasting feeling that LITERALLY ROBS ME OFF OF MY LIFE. =((((((   Help me. I have never seen a therapist and never went personally to a psychiatrist. I don't have enough money. My parents never cared about these things. My siblings and family, they're either blind or playing blind. I don't want this life anymore. What can I do? Please don't tell me to go to a school councilor. I don't wanna go there.

20090128212615AAwNDga	Health;Mental Health	How to identify a complain or a "ask-for-help"?	How to tell if it is a complain,a "ask-for-help" or a question? Sometimes when a friend tells you something, you may mistakenly think it is a "ask-for-help" but in deed it is a complain, a catharsis. If it is a complain,all you should do is to listen to her/him and resist the urge/temptation to provide your advice.How to tell the difference between both? In my opinion, if this "ask-for-help" is unsolvable, or has no solution, then it is a complain; If you think the speaker can absolutely figure out the solutions on his own, then it is a complain. Do you think my methods to identify a complain or a "ask-for-help" are correct? Is there other better way to identify a complain or a "ask-for-help"?

Ive had my breasts checked around 3 months ago when i seen my gyno for a pap smear. I also had a baby 6 months ago and didnt breastfeed. Im nearly 19yrs old.   Now im really skinny and dont have much boobs so i can feel everything when i poke around. On the lower half of my breasts under the nipple on both sides i feel long flat lumps that move around easily.    When i aske dthe doctor she said its nothing but im still paranoid. Also when i push really deep into my armpit i feel a ball that moves around.   Ive had a chest xray and upper abdominal ct scan and ultrasound and everything is normal. Ive also had blood work that says everything is normal.   What could these lumps be. I know anyone can get acncer but no one in either side of my family ahs ever had it. One of my sisters has really lumpy breasts but she was told there cysts or something.   Can i not stress about mine? I suffer with really bad anxiety so i obsess about my body alot and get paranoid but i know for certain im not just feeling things.   Could i be feeling milk ducts or something? Whats the chances of having breast cancer in the both breasts in the same place?      I havnt noticed growth in my breasts they are always small and they just hurt alot around my period. Also the one in my armpit is more    I also have hard little lump sin the back of my neck and in my groin taht are long, but my doctor keeps saying iits from stress and being so skinny

20090128212308AAAM3WD	Health;Mental Health	Is my mother crazy (and if so, what disorder does is sound like)?	It has become more evident the older I get that my mother is...well, she just isn't right.  She cannot be- there absolutely must be something wrong with her.  However, when I look at psychological disorders, mental illness- none of the named issues fit her particulars.   She did have a bad childhood- as did all 6 of her brothers and sister.  They all have decent jobs, homes, are active in their children lives and their communities.    Over my 29 years, she has lived a severe pattern:   1) normal: weird, eccentric, but does somewhat strive for normalcy and is somewhat active in her children's lives.  This typically lasts 1-2 years.   2) Than she'll suddenly claim that the man she is with treats her horribly, accuses him of some kind of abuse and that she has suffered and given her life for him and her kids...she's been a victim in every possible way.     3) Than she goes buck wild, dates and parties, dresses provocatively, spends foolishly.  She doesn't care about the emotional stress this causes others, actually she seems incapable of understanding it.  She is illogical, irrational, peculiar, emotionless, self-absorbed...and speaking to her is often like speaking to a 15 year old.  Everything adult- insurance, retirement, jobs- she practically rolls her eyes and does call it all "boring".      She has gone through this several times, had 3 sets of children, given them all up, been in numerous relationships...she is a drain in every way.  Now that I am adult, I am growing concerned that she will soon become a financial burden as well- since she has NO savings, retirement plan, or even health insurance.      She is incapable of adulthood, she is a child.  (Her IQ is probably between 115-120, so that is not the issue)     Are you aware of any mental/psychological disorder that could be the root of her seeming insanity?

It says to call an ambulence if a person stops breating or has multiple seizures without waking up. But what do they do at the hospital after this happens? If they stop breathing....I get that they would probably intubate the person, but for how long? would they have to stay at the hospital for a couple of days or could they go right home? and how do they treat someone who had seizures without waking up inbetween? Do they make the person wake up? how? and then how long do they have to stay on the hospital?

20090128212626AAzO5If	Health;Women's Health	What are these bumps on my vaginal area? ?	Okay so this is really embarrassing but i'm getting kind of nervous and i need help so here goes. For the past few months when i shower i notice these medium sized bumps on the outside of my vagina. They get quite itchy and when i pop them they have a whitish yellowish pus and sometimes bleed. But then they heal and i don't see them again until i happen to notice maybe a few weeks later.    Now i got really freaked at first but then it disappeared when it came up again like a month later i freaked again and i don't know what it is. The symptoms sound herpes like. But i'm a virgin, however i did have oral sex with someone but i also kissed them so if it was herpes wouldn't they appear on my lips also? my lips are just fine so i don't know if that's it or not. I also don't shave so i don't think the bumps are caused by shaving.     I really don't know what to do. I'm too embarrassed to tell anyone, and will be even more embarrassed if i told my mom or something about everything including my sexual relations and it doesn't even relate to it.    I just need advice from women who either have similar bumps or know something about them. I wouldn't be able to visit a doctor without my mom so i'm childishly depending on strangers with the same experiences to help. I know its stupid but right now i don't think i have a choice. I really hope you guys tell me this is normal. :(

20090128212826AAzfJ1i	Health;Dental	My front teeth are tingling... but why?	I feel a constant tingling in waves in my lower front teeth every couple seconds.  This has only started happening this week.      A few reasons I can think of:      I started using mouthwash more frequently.      I started rinsing my mouth with sea salt water.         I don't eat anything unusually cold or hot that my teeth would be sensitive to.  I haven't changed my brushing habits lately.      This "tingling" isn't painful; just very annoying.  It happens right above my gum line on my lower teeth, towards the front.      I don't have wisdom teeth.  I have a fairly normal jaw, no overcrowding.      Whatever could it be?  And how can I make it stop?            No lame @$$ answers.  If you don't know, DO NOT ANSWER.  Do not just ay "no clue" for your 2 points.      Thanks in advance!

And I've been cutting myself for almost a year, because my emotions are so crazy and I hate everything about myself.      I want to tell my mom so I can go to a therapist.

But I want to go to therapy and get my feelings out. I've never told ANYONE. How do I begin?

(that probably makes no sense). My throat doesn't hurt, but it feels SO weird when i swallow or cough. and i have been sneezing a lot more than normal (which isn't that much.)    my friend has had mono for 6 months. but she feels like shes getting sick again. and i don't know a lot about mono but i know that it takes forever to get rid of.      im confused. and i would love all the feedback i could get.  idon'tt want to go to the doctor and waste money when i might just have a cold.

My dad had a heart attack at 35...and died in his sleep at 44...they don't know the cause...they just said he had heart problems.  I am a runner at my college (20 years old) and I had to get an EKG because of my dad's history in order to be eligible to run. The EKG showed a 'short PR interval' so now I have to get an echocardiogram on Friday.  I am really nervous.  I haven't been allowed to run with my team at all until this gets cleared.  I just am wondering what this might be...could I have some serious heart problem and not have known about it ? I asked the doctor and he said it could be a normal variant or it could be something more serious.  I am kinda freaking out...sometimes I feel "pressure" in my heart area...but I always thought it was just my asthma.  When I feel short of breath or anything like that I always thought it was just my asthma also.  Is it possible I may have a heart problem?

My doctor says "I wouldn't worry about it unless it gets bigger" because I'm only 23 years old he doesn't think it's bad.  I'm worried there might be some kind of infection in there or something.  It hurts only if anything touches it or I move around too fast.  Any ideas on what I should do?  The doctor said a biopsy would be the next step.

20090128221834AA1UAMj	Health;Diet & Fitness	What are the symptoms of a diet gone unhealthy?	I'm about 20 pounds above my ideal weight, and I have recently decreased my food intake and taken to 30 minutes of daily cardio. I have 2 cups of cereal in the morning (300-400 calories), soup for lunch (200 calories) and a rotating diet of either 1/2 pound of fish or 1/2 (pre-cooked) cous couse (300 calories). I figure that my diet is somewhere around 1500, when you take in random food intake and the fact that the caloric values on food are often underestimated. I've been on the diet for two weeks now, give or take, so I obviously haven't lost any noticible weight. What I'm concerned about is that, by now, my body has cleansed itself of any short term energy storage, and that my diet might prove excessive. What should I be on the look out for that would be signs of a starvation-level or otherwise dangerous diet?

20090128221510AAEPQJk	Health;Women's Health	What is causing my Vaginal Odor?	Ok. FACTS: my discharge is thin milky white. Has an odor. Definitely not my natural smell. Vagina DOES NOT itch. Just Odor and thin Milky white discharge. NO burning, NO pelvic pain. No pain PERIOD. Think I have some kind of bacteria infection. Went to the Gyne today. She said I looked fine. Didn't see anything in me as a sign of yeast or bacterial infection. In the mean time have to wait for Pap test results to come back later. So can some one tell me why[if there is no bacteria/yeast infection] what is causing this odor? For the record I do have HPV, but from my last check up before this one I was tested positive for HPV. 2nd Pap then tested negative for HPV[so basically I was normal]. So either my body got rid of the HPV or suppressed it. I'm married and I know for a fact there is no cheating going on[No I didn't get HPV from my husband] HPV was discovered before I met my husband. Seems like my cervix has been fine all this time. NO cellular changes. YES I DO WASH my vagina. So NO is not a hygene thing. So again any ideas as to what could be causing this Odor? Aside from what the Gynecologist told me I feel I need a 2nd opinion. Don't need any surprises.

When I was 14 I got my first kiss, but it wasn't the adorable first kiss all little girls dream of.  It was a boy my age who shoved his tongue down my throat and touched my privates against my will, but I was so shocked and innocent I didn't know how to react.  So now I don't see kissing the same way.  Anything even the slight bit passionate comes accross as lustful in my mind.  I am seventeen now and I have a  boyfriend and I love him very much and I tried to explain this to him but he doesn't understand and is frustrated that I just can't passionately kiss with him.  How do I get over this????  It's so frustrating, I feel like I'll never see kissing as something beautiful and intimate like I should and it's been this way for years and it's never gone away.  I thought I would get over it but I haven't.  I feel disgusting and violated when my boyfriend tries to kiss me like that even when he's not doing anything that the other boy did.  How can I get over this and just have a normal relationship??

I will be going to see my dentist soon aswell for a routine cleaning.  Should I mention anything to him or is there someone else I should be seeing?  I am also located in Canada, so any medical test etc. are free, so go ahead and suggest!      Any help would be appreciated. :D

Unfortunately for me, I happen to have a set of teeth structured such that my teeth get dirty very easily. Of course, if I eat at home, I can brush my teeth immediately, but when I go out and have a meal, it is difficult to do anything other than floss them. Usually, flossing removes the stuff in between the teeth, but not the dirty substance on the teeth itself. It would be rather inappropriate if I brush my teeth in a public toilet. Could you guys tell me some methods or ways to keep my teeth clean when a toothbrush and toothpaste is not available? Perhaps there's some sort of mouthwash I could use. Thank you all very much for your help. I will choose a best answer.

My doctor told me this happened because she came out so quickly, and that was perfectly normal.  Well, today I noticed that she had broken blood vessels on the same eye, but on the opposite side (the inner part closest to the nose). What could have caused this ?  I am with her all day ( I am a S.A.H.M.) and the only time I'm away from her is when she's taking a nap.  She recently started a new kind of cry,(it sounds a little 'forced' or over exaggerated) but I don't see how that could force blood vessels to pop, so to speak.  Does anyone have any idea ?   We just moved to a new town, about a week ago, and I haven't been able to find a doctor that I like just yet. So if I take her, I'm going to have to take her to a clinic of some sort.  Does anyone have any suggestions ? Or has anyone had this happen to their child before ?    Thank so much in advance!      Take care all !

My condition improved significantly, and another dentist at the same office mentioned Arestin again, but also acknowledged that my gums were better.  Then he said I might prefer lasers instead.  The lasers clean the gums and base of the tooth so the gums grow back and attach to the bone better to reduce bone loss and receding gums.

Ok, I've been watching my diet and exercise lately, as I realised that I'm becoming overweight...on the border of normal and over.       So, I've exercised this week, twice, both over 30 mins on the treadmill.      Today, I'm sitting in the office, and I intend to run this afternoon when I get home.       I've had a nectarine, 2cups of tea w/milk and sugar, caesar salad with apple juice for lunch. Now I'm eying off the vending machine.      Would  50g chocolate or 50g veggie chips be better. I'm thinking the veggie chips, as they are saying it's 40% less fat than potato chips, and they are free from preservatives and colours. However 50g of chocolate does sound very appealing to me at the moment...      What would be better for my situation? of course if I don't have anything, that is even better, by I"m famished!!!

20090128223511AAEePqk	Health;Diseases & Conditions;Other - Diseases	Brother has problems defecating?	This is serious, not a joke:  My brother is 13 years old and only poops once every 2-3 days.  Whenever he finally  decides to go, he secretes a large mass of excrement.  So large in fact, that it clogs up the toilet every single time.  This has proven to be a very revolting habit and my parents don't seem to take much initiative to confront this.  I have a feeling that this problem may be deeply rooted with emotional/psychological issues. If anybody can provide some insight or perhaps a link to some medical information, it would be greatly appreciated.         regards

No one ever asks me hows it going i always have to listen to others, but i have a problem i kept in so much , i cant let it out im afriad of i dont know , no one knows ive been cutting myself for around 2 years, ive thought of death for probably 4 years constantly every day, even when im sorrounded by people if theres one pause i just think about how much i hate myself, now im more happy seeming around people , but when no one talks to me or theres pauses i just wish i could like kill my self already.  But ive kept in mind for years now that i have a future, every day though i think of ways to kill myself ..  theres more to my life , but too much to express even writing this to complete strangers makes me hate it more.  anyways its complicated   thanks for reading this i know twas stupid i just had to write somewhere , i mean all i do is write sad songs and poetry that No one will ever read because i hide everything.  I have never said anything to anyone about anything negative in my life , i just hide it like i dunno im sucha fckn complicated person    and i know , im fortunate that i ad least get to live, and have stuff but i just hate it ,, but im not gonna give up my mottos been forever its gonna get better.. but it actually isnt it gets worse days by day i just dont know what to do all i think about it ya know    and im just sick and tired of listening to other people complain all the time, but they just dont know how easy they have it, like everyone around mes always like OMg poor me blabla and i listen, but they dont know a thing on me i guess i dunno im just scared of talking its complicated like ..    I just wish i could go talk to a psy , cause id feel guilty tellin my parents about cutting and stuff even though they probably i dunno, and im living two provinces away from them , i just want a psy and help.. but not a guidance coucelor or anyone that wont keep my stuff confidential, ive been alone for a while i guess , and i just want to fix everything alone and try and start off a new life alone, i thought moving away would make it get better ( its complicated) but it made it worse.., but now i have more friends i guess, but i still feel as if im treated like **** anyways i dont even get where im coming frm sorry its so complicated to explain..

20060726132123AAVryhB	Health;Diet & Fitness	Caffine and fat burning. Who knew?	I just read in my Nutrition text book that over using caffeine is illegal in competitive endurance sports because of the advantage it gives you by releasing fat into your blood stream for fuel. Most endurance athletes "hit the wall" when their muscular glycogen levels are exhausted, but if you drink ~6 cups off coffee before hand, the caffeine converts that fat to a usable energy source. Something to think about if you do any exercise for over 60 minutes in an attempt to lose body fat.

I've also noticed this weird pressure sensation in my brain, similar to what you feel when you pop your ears in a plane. It seems to come on randomly or when I get a tad bit stressed. I find I can control it but it does seem to happen a lot and I always have to be conscious of myself. I'm actually not sure if it's me worrying or is it some anxiety thing or if the pill is just not working. I remember this feeling when I was taking zoloft and had forgotten to take my pill. Is that withdrawal or what is it? Also, it doesn't seem that my mind is racing like it did before I took anything kind of drug but how do I really tell?

A few days later got numbness in his fingers and feet. Then it was full blown numb on both hands and feet. His hands are in a claw like position, He can't get in bed by himself, he can't dress himself and falls down for no reason. I took him to the dr two times. The dr said he has stocking glove and anxiety and that is what this is. This morning I took him to the ER because he was in so much pain he could not stand up and I had to lift him in and out of the car. The ER ran some blood test and found nothing. She said it must be a flu thing and he is achy and exaggerating the pain. I want to believe both of them but in my son's twelve years I have never seen him like this. He is dramatic but this has been for days can he be "faking" this pain everyday all day. I even peek in the room when he thinks he is alone and he can't even open a soda bottle or pick up some of his toys or books. You can hear it in his voice to, It has changed it sounds like his throat is closed or something. Please help me on what might be wrong the Dr's wont.

20090129014542AAoXGCt	Health;Diseases & Conditions;Other - Diseases	What can you eat when you have a mouth ulcer?	Or two? Counting with my tongue, I think I have two on the roof of my mouth. It's either a mouth ulcer or an STD, but I choose mouth ulcer. Everything I've read on STDs, says 'around or on the mouth' never in the mouth. Unless it's herpes or something serious like that. In this case, I know it's not, because this has happened before, and it went away after a few days.     Mainly I'm complaining this time, because It's been 5 days now, and they're still... there. As I said, it only took a few days last time.     The worst thing is when I eat something crunchy. It tends to brush against the roof of my mouth and that causes extreme discomfort and an "ow!" from me.     I'm sad and thinking the worst. I hate everything.
20090128233947AAOsowh	Health;Alternative Medicine	? What are some all-natural alternatives that help with insomnia, pain relief ... ?	I'm looking for some homeopathic all-natural herbal or organic remedies to help with:      1) Pain alleviation.   2) Insomnia.      To start anyways. Recommendations other than scripts/OTC drugs would be appreciated. (I do not like to take scripts unless absolutely necessary as most times they are narcotics, and i do not like putting those things into my body.)      A physical building up of a tolerance for certain medications (even OTCs) can precipitate a loss of effectiveness, hence the physical need to ingest a larger dosage which can result in either a chemical dependency or damage to liver/kidneys and other organs. This is less likely with natural or homeopathic remedies.      Also, I am Vegetarian and ADHD so i only eat all-natural, organic or kosher foods. Nothing with artificial dyes and preservatives as i have a food allergies and i cannot eat them. So suggestions must fit this criteria also.       Thanks if you can suggest anything.   xoxo   ?

20090129024406AAwMnoc	Health;General Health Care;Pain & Pain Management	Recurring stomach pain?	I've been getting thing dull ache in my upper stomach region for the past week and a half now.  I've never experienced it until recently and I have no idea what could be causing it.  It seems no matter what I do, nothing helps to get rid of it until it wants to go away.  I've tried antacids, milk, yogurt etc.  Nothing helps the pain.  I try shifting positions when I'm trying to sleep and still nothing.  I don't eat spicy foods so I don't think it's heartburn.  I had a baby recently, but it's centered in my upper stomach so I don't think the cause of the pain has anything to do with that.  I'm not gassy at all, and it only happens at nighttime.     Has anyone else experienced anything like this or have any ideas as to what could be causing this pain?

20090128232455AArbHUA	Health;Women's Health	A question fo girls only thanks!?	this is a silly question, and to make it sillier i've included a horrible illustration. anyway, im 20 and don't like my boobs. im a full C or D depending on the bra. they seem to fall kind of low on my chest  but theres just enough skin below my nips so they aren't pointing completely south. when i have a little more weight on me they almost look good, but if i lose weight they deflate. in the future if i have the spare cash i may want to get something done but i can't find any before and afters with MY type of chest and im not really sure exactly WHAT procedure would even benefit me most. i never think lifts look good and they seem to leave bad scars. reduction would make them small...but i feel like if i just had a material inside it would fill in the skin like a balloon. my boobs actually seem perkier when i gain weight because the added fluff blows them up. does it sound like implants would be the most beneficial.    and just for a visual, i made a silly drawing that sorta looks like me. i don't think im that fat though :/    http://s194.photobucket.com/albums/z201/...

Is it normal to still have some pain?    Out of a 24 hour day, 18 hours I am fine. The other 6, I have some throbbing pain sometimes to my ear. If I take a painkiller and throw a hot water bottle on it, then it dies down a bit. I also have a horrible taste in my mouth though.   I was a little worried about dry socket, but everything about the extraction site looks great! The hole is almost healed and I still have a scab on the part that isn't.    So where is the horrible taste and occasional throbbing pain coming from? Do you think it is normal?   I have a dentist appointment in 6 days. Should I deal with the occasional pain until then?

20090128232510AAZjUgK	Health;Women's Health	Just stopped taking bc and very confused!?	Ok so i had been on bc a couple times before, i was on it when i was 16 till i was 18, then took a break from it for about 2 or 3 months, (nothing was different, i felt exactly the same). Then i got back on it and was on it for a little over a year. I finally decided to stop taking it  in early november, and when december came along my period was extremely late im talking i had a 40 day cycle. it was a weird period i had heavy bleeding for about 3 days then it stopped for a day and started up again for another 2 days. Then in january i had my period really early, only a 21 day cycle and it was really short (4 days but normal flow)!       In december i was nervous that i was pregnant because i was having all kinds of signs and my period was so late, i took 1 test at first sign of late period, then another one 1 week late and both came up negative. Then in january, even though i had already had my period i was still feeling wierd and still having signs of pregnancy (getting car sick in the front seat-never have b4, bloated, moody, and exhausted) so i took another test which came up negative.       My question is, has this ever happened to anyone else? has anyone else had wierd symptoms when quiting their birth control(mood swings, car sick, bloating, exhausted, loss of appetite, and neck aches)? And will things ever go back to normal?      please dont be rude i just need some feedback on what might be happening, im so confused!   Thanx!

There was no sex, but my brother in law would feel me up, smack my butt, and put his hand down my pants from the time I was 7 until about 13. He doesn't live around me anymore so it's not a problem now. But I feel like it really messed me up. Am I exaggerating? And should I tell my mom? I don't want to cause a family crisis or ruin my sister's relationship with her husband, and I'm just so confused about everything.    by the way, he's 12 years older than me.

Its almost 3 AM here and I have woken up a handfull of times choking and gasping for air.  Its scary like I am drowing or suffocating and my throat is sore and dry from sleeping with my mouth open since I cannot breathe thru my nose at all.  I am now sort of scared to fall back asleep because I keep jumping awake and can't breathe good. Is this dangerous?

20090128234628AADuykA	Health;Mental Health	How would you stop your daughter from being jealous of her big sister, who is getting all the attention?	i have a daughter called jade, whose mother died shortly after she was born. i brought her up. she is now six. i recently met a woman named rose, who is also a single parent. rose has a daughter called nicole, who is four. we got married and became a family. we adopted eachother`s children. adjusting to a new mother and sister haven`t been easy for jade. i had spoiled her a great deal. nicole had also been greatly spoiled by her mother. jade and nicole did not get along very well. nicole often tattled on jade and got her into trouble. jade thought nicole was an annoying little sister. unfortunately, jade got cancer and was in the hospital for ages. she had to undergo many treatments, including chemotherapy, which made all her curly hair fall out. when she got home, people gave her most of the attention, which made nicole jealous. nicole even tried to fight with jade on some occasions. when we go out as a family, jade might not be feeling well and we would have to take her home. nicole would cry and scream because she would want to stay and play. rose and i comfort her by saying" we have to go home now because your sister is tired. we will play later" nicole had now became greatly attention-seeking. how can i make things better? i love both my daughters very much and want them to be happy and comfortable. they both need to be cheered up. also, rose is now pregnant and there is now twin baby girls on the way. somebody adviced us to enroll nicole at a preschool so she can try new things and have children her own age to play with. we thought that was a good idea as she needed a distraction. she was looking forward to attending when we told her about it after taking her to have a look at the preschool. she was doing pretty well there until a boy there called billy pushed her. billy is a naughty little boy who have pulled her hair and teased her on some other occasions. she didn`t feel safe there anymore and has been telling us she doesn`t want to go. she is begging us not to send her back.

For some reason, if anything OTHER than a mans penis gets near me, i leave him. Idk why, but i hate everything about relationships. And...this comes to mind.......But is it because I was molested as a child? When I was 7, a 15 year old boy touched me. No one knows about this. but i asked on YahooAnswers before, and they tell me that its my fault, or that its just "kids, experimenting mutually. The magic word was never said." The truth is, i DID tell that boy no. a VERY distinct NO NO NO!! but he didnt listen. is this why i hate love/dating?

I have heard that if you are dieting to loose weight, once your body gets used to your diet, it adjusts itself to the calorie intake and you cannot burn anymore. [Your metabolism slows down]      for e.g. If i eat 2000 calories a day and i burn 2000 calories as well. Now if i reduce it to 1500 so it means that i am burning 500 calories extra,       How long does it take for my body metabolism to slow down to 1500 calories a day?

20090128235749AACAqWA	Health;Dental	Am I within my rights to sue my dentist?	I went to the dentist last week and had 2 teeth extracted. They were my wisdom teeth. My dentist didn't even bother to x-ray my teeth before attempting to rip them out.    The top one came out with a portion of skull bone, which resulted on oral stitches up top.    The second one snapped off at the roots and became severely infected. He did not offer any prescriptions for pain relief or pennicillin for possible infection. I had to go to emergency at the hospital for help.   The whole time I was at the dentist, he was rude to me, and even said to me when I let out a whimper, "That's no way to get my sympathy". He was also rude to his young assistant and insisted she touched the floor to pick up a gauze wrapper and then she proceeded to touch my mouth. I am not sure if she washed her hands, as I could not see what she was doing. Also, the dentist and his assistant were arguing about the size of the instruments used to pull my teeth out. I believe that he improvised with the tools he had, because his assistant couldn't locate the right sized tools.      So, now, after being for xrays and to emergency twice, I now have to see a maxillofacial surgeon tomorrow to discuss surgery to remove the part of the tooth still inside my gum. This surgeon is very expensive and only operates in private hospitals, and I do not have private health insurance. This is going to cost me a fortune to fix this problem.      Not only that... I am in agony.... I can't eat or sleep or focus at work. I sweat and shake and cry most of the time because of the pain. I am constantly having to take strong pain killers (Endone and Codeiene) as well as pills to help with the terrible infection.      Do I have any rights legally?? Can I sue this butcher dentist and make him pay for my sugery?

I have been sent to psychologists, and I avoid them because I simply don't like talking to them.   My mom hasn't been making things any better. Yesterday i was walking down the stairs, and she gave me a dirty look, and so i asked "why are you giving me a dirty look" and she answered " because your a b****." and that lead me to leave and impulse drink last night. When she says things like that to me, it maks me leave and get into the habit of drugs, but after being sexually assaulted, and witnessing a friend being raped, and being sent to the hospital from alcohal poisoning, i really understand this isn't the way to fix things. Every little thing makes me upset, and my way of dealing with it is doing drugs , getting drunk, or just sneaking out and doing what i know is wrong. I'm a 15 year old girl who doesnt want a life like this, what can i do to help myself, please don't say psychologists will help me, I really dislike talking to people I hardly know openly. Also, if you have anything rude to say, save it, I'm looking for help, nothing else.      Thanks,   -Kellie.

I was in a car wreck as a passenger and the pressure from the seatbelt (driver hit a tree at 60) rupture my pectoralis on my left side where inserts at the oblique all the way up to my collar bone. I have 23% of the muscle remaining (the part that inserts at the shoulder) and have almost complete loss of function still after 3 years and a 100k worth of rehab along with reconstructive surgery that removed the other 77% of my muscle. I also have severe bouts of nerve pain attacks (so bad it makes me have panic attacks). Ive tried Gabapentin and Neurontin and then Carbamezapine all doing absolutely nothing. Im currently just on pain meds (Methadone, Lortab, Flexaril for relaxing the muscle) and still have the attacks. Any idea if there is anything out there that might help? Would anabolic steroids help bring back strength and function? Also has any would ever heard of this? I was a spectacle at every hospital I went to. The doctor would call in other doctors to see. They all said they have only seen ruptures at the insertion in to the shoulder. They said they couldnt have reattached my muscle because it would just ripped back off. That consensus was at least by 20 different doctors including plastic surgeons and neuroligists. Now they are just telling me im screwed for the rest of my life. Im now 27 ( was 23 at the time) and would like to try just about anything to get some sense of normalcy back. Any feedback is great. Thank You!

20090129003607AAJHfLr	Health;Mental Health	I think I am going insane... literally?	Please note that some of this may be disturbing to some.      A couple years ago, I started to have some desire to get into fights with people and beat them up or something like that. I just kind of shrugged it off and decided it was hormones or something along those lines. But then later these desires started to get more severe.      I started wanting to cause serious harm to others and then they got so bad I literally wanted to kill others. I have dreams at night thinking about how I could kill a certain person.      Of course I never acted on these desires, but they certainly bother me.      I began to develop deep hatreds for people who were not my friends. I wanted to get rid of them. I wanted to cause them pain. I look at others and think about how much I hate them. When I get into arguments, I make threats and swear.      So I started playing violent video games to help me try and vent this rage I have, but they don't seem to be helping me. Do you think these games could be fueling this anger I have?      I also have found myself laughing hysterically at things I didn't even think were funny. I couldn't help but just laugh like a mental patient.      Recently, I have developed some sort of paranoia, thinking things I knew didn't exist were hiding behind every corner, waiting to just jump out and kill me. I have nightmares about them frequently.      I also have thoughts of suicide because all these thoughts are truly tormenting me.      I don't know why this all is going on. I never told anyone about this and I am posting here for anonymity. I do not take drugs nor do I cut myself. I live a healthy social life as well.

Its as if im lost and dont know where to go or what to do...Somedays (in a sick way) i would never think of actively commiting suicide but yet sometimes i hope that maybe i will contract a disease or illness or suffer from a accident that hopefully will never recover from (i dont know if thats wanting pity or not) but some days i hope something happens to me so that this will all end.....any advice ppl?

As of right now I can't sleep, while other days I sleep for prolonged periods of time, usually eat maybe 2 times a day, don't really find much of anything fun anymore, and tends to think people don't think about me much.    I would go and get diagnosed for this and get a prescription, but I'm afraid of a few things. 1) My parents are in a bit of a financial bind, so I don't think they will recommend me getting anything now. 2) Even if they had the money, or myself for that matter, I'm not sure how I really should break it to them and everyone else around me.    I've read that St. Johns Wort may help with some of my depression, but I also read that it may not work. Should I try it out anyways to see if it won't at least make things easier to cope with? Or should I face the music and see if I can get prescribed medicine?    If anyone could give me some advice on what options I can or should take in this regard, please let me know.

20090129002705AA1fgMY	Health;Diseases & Conditions;Heart Diseases	Blood Pressure and Heart Rate?	I've had an unknown medical problem for a few years that doctors like to ignore. While this may not be directly related, I want to see if I can get some info.  Recently I've been checking my blood pressure and I keep getting readings of like 90/60. or close to it, while at these levels my heart rate ranges from 78-101.   Is this really low BP? Is the heart rate high? and if it is can it cause light headedness,  aversion to food, shakiness(mostly caused by food, no I don't had high or low blood sugar, I've been tested, a lot) trouble staying awake(especially right after waking up), migraines(which causes light sensitivity), or chest pains? That's not all of them but probably the most... noticeable.  If not can anyone think of something that CAN?  Anything will help. Oh, and I have never done drugs in my life.(not that you'll assume I have, but for some odd reason most my symptoms match with drawl =.= which kinda sucks when you're trying to get a doctor to take you seriously)

I have an appt with an endo, but it's 2 months away.  The oral surgeons are saying it may just be best and less costly to extract the teeth.  The ones they recommend to extract are on the top, 1 on right, 1 on left.  Is this bad?      I hear your teeth will shift, but I planned on getting braces for my gap anyway so I know I'll need a retainer for the rest of my life regardless.

My boyfriend and i have been pretty physical in the last seven months we've been together and to be blunt, he's probed the question of intercourse WAY more than once. I've been educated with all the facts and those little workshops on safe sex when I was younger (therefore well aware of the facts, thank you very much), but they've never truly offered an advice to help me make my decision.   The closest we've ever gotten was when he penetrated me half an inch before I quickly told him to stop and that was that. We are comfortable enough to sleep naked with each other without risk of it leading to anything else. We've talked about it and agreed that it was only right when both of us were ready.   I'm not sure if I really want to give my virginity to him- one moment I'll be feeling absolutely in love and ready to connect, the next, I'll be retreating into myself and be overwhelmed with the consequences and possibilities.   We both have access to pills, condoms, pregnancy tests..etc.    The only problem is my inability to make a decision.   Any advice?

It's happened before.. usually when i'm lying down or when I wake up. It's the same pain, But it usually FADES! This has hurt for hours, now.. it's faded a little but then it comes back worse...

I went to the ER because my ankle looked like a club after a snowboarding incident, and they told me I had a broken ankle. They put me in a temporary splint until the swelling goes down (fibreglass from the bottom of my foot to halfway up my calf with ace bandages keeping it in place). My question is can I take it off at night and put it back on in the morning? I have a hard time sleeping with this stupid thing on my leg. There's only so much damage one can do in a bed, right?

20090129030553AAvZErJ	Health;Optical	Will prescription glasses eventually cure Strabismus?	Hello everyone.       At age 3 I was diagnosed with Strabismus which caused double vision and prevented binocular vision. My doctor said that one of my eyes had a weak eye muscle and that caused my eye to turn in. I have been wearing prescription glasses ever since and my optometrist says that every year my eye muscle is getting stronger and my eyesight is getting better. I now have more control over my eye turning in than before, for example; When I was younger I could take off my glasses and my eye would immediately turn in. Nowadays I can remove my glasses and it won't turn in unless I let it, but my eye still struggles.       Also, back in August my optometrist said that it's possible that next visit (Summer 2009) I may be able to drop down to single-lens glasses/contact lenses. Now I have read a handful of information on the internet and most websites stated that surgery was the only way to permanently cure Strabismus, which is what I'm wanting.       So I was just wondering, since my eye muscle is getting stronger every year, will my prescription eventually cure my Strabismus forever? How long will it take? I've been wearing glasses for 12 years now. Thanks for the information!! :)

I am a teenager, I am currently getting my GED so I stay at home most of the time expect when I need to go to classes and something else. Yesterday, I left an unexpected soreness in my throat and I just assumed that it was sore throat, so I had some hot tea and a cough drop before going to bed but as the night processed ... it got more and more difficult to breathe and more and more difficult to swallow my own saliva. When I woke up in the middle of the night, I realized this wasn't sore throat and it was something else. I went online and did my symptoms.       Strep throat can up and I covered each symptom except fever which I have yet to have and do not want to have but when I heard that if you have difficulty breathing or difficulty swallowing, go to the emergency room ... well I told my dad that I thought I had strep throat and it may be a bad case and I might need to go to the doctor or the emergency room. He told me that he had to go to work and that was the end of question.      My mom is currently in Las Vegas and I keep trying to contact her but I guess she is knocked out from all of the partying and gambling. The websites say that its contagious and can lead to more serious things if not treated. I am very worried and I am much in pain, I have tears in my eyes as we speak because every time I breathe or swallow, I feel pain.      Please help me!

20090129032556AAsqBCp	Health;Mental Health	I'm a nervous wreck and cannot sleep-no where to turn!?	Sorry so long but...      My field is graphic design and I'm only a seasonal employee at a theme park where I do a job fairly relevant to my field.  I've been doing everything tooth n nail to find a better job and even starting my own business with a friend along with being a student at the community college.  I've gotten to the interview stage/asked for interviews--still no luck.      While attending the college, I did get an odd job as nude model for figure drawing classes.  However, I got fired from this model job in a bizzare fashion...I was scheduled to pose for an evening class at 6pm.  When the class was being held, there was a winter storm warning, 6 in snow expected.  The national weather service urged people to stay off the roads for the evening if possible, travel started to get pretty dangerous.  The teacher tried to keep me there and insisted that it was "light drizzle", when the roads were getting more slick by the minute.  I told him that my personal safety matters and if I stayed at his request then I probably wouldn't be able to get out of the school parking lot and risk totaling my car.  I had to leave before it got any worse.  There were already several accidents on the road.  My teacher started to get aggravated with me and lectured to me that I have a responsibility--to put it, he tried to keep ther, risking my safety in the storm.  He didn't understand this so he fired me.  He then went on saying that he needed someone who's more accountable, dependable, and sort of "threw a fit."  My last words to him:  "You can fire me if you want to.  I'm sorry.  I cannot work with you if it's going to be like this."  He said, "Well, I cant work with you either, you just cost me my class."  I WON'T put this on my resume nor use it as reference and will never come up in future interviews.      This teacher is also the new head of the art department and since I walked out on his job and he was upset, the fact that I cost him his class, he has that type of power to expel me from the campus.  There was nothing ugly, no violence, no cussing, etc.  I was just simply stating the I need to leave cause of the snow.  I stood firm on my grounds, but still, I just know I'm facing the possibility of being expelled since I walked out.  The scary thing is that whenever I read the school's policies regarding expulsion, it didn't specify how soon I'll be notified.  I have an internship class there tomorrow, and I'm hoping to god that I won't get in trouble from the other night!  In less than eight hours I'll find out if my future is ruined, and I'm a nervous wreck!  I haven't slept right for the last two days!      I feel like I could just put a bullet through my head now...hopefully I'm just overreacting a tad bit??

Im 5'6 and slim - a UK size 10, weighing approx 9stone, 8/9 pounds. But not happy with my stomach area because it's not flat and more importantly not toned as i know it could be, carrying flab! Grr! lol    My diet consists of 3 main meals a day .... usually for breakfast I'll have toast or cereal, lunch I'll have a sandwich, packet of crisp and something like a few biscuits. Dinner i have mostly things like spag bowl, chicken / potatoes / veg, curry, pizza :S and chips! and I'll occasionally have a snack during the evening normally a choc bar or dessert but not all the time.    Weekends i have the occasional takeaway! ... Do i need to change my diet? If so what should i change it to?    I've been going gym twice a week for 40mis / 1 hr,  and doing cardio but haven't seen any improvements, yet, i have only been going a 4 weeks so maybe thats why?    What are the best exercies to do for a toned stomach? Crunches / sit-ups? I've seen some answers on here saying they don't work? Is this true? Im sure they do though because when brintey Spears was in her prime (and had an amazing toned stomach) i read she did a 200 sit-ups a day? Just a rumour?

If you knew me now you'd say that I have a wonderful life or I'm lucky or I'm able to do many things.    10 years ago, when I was going at school (well maybe since elementary school) I was too different. I mean you wouldn't recognize me. Firstly I didn't have any friends or I had for a while and then I don't know what I did but they were leaving me. I hated my relatives & parents-I used to blame them 4 everything.Also I was too fat (my mother is also). I didn't care at all about looking like a girl, taking care of my hair, clothing,  putting on make-up, jewels etc..I was the last to everything (ex when play a game in teams) and I had C to F to all the lessons. I couldn't talk to boys. I used to feel everyone is laughing at me and watever I do I'll stii be wrong to everything because I don't worth anything. I didn't have a clue about what life is and I think I might have been raised a bit brad-kid like. Because even my parents had a huge economic problem I had whatever I wanted to buy-after a while I was bored and thrown it away.   I have had plenty of experiences in my life-that helped me a lot to realise everything around me and stop doing the same mistakes. It was hard. Now I'm a normal girl as everybody else-they say i look like a model or athlete but I doubt it, have a job, relation, take care of me when i have time, learn new things, believe in me, participate in everything, some people think i'm kind of outgoing person. Anyway the point is that after 5 years   I've nearly changed ID. They say I'm mature person and trust me more that me.    The only problem is that I feel that my life is like a cyclone that never stops. Like I get in the metro and can never get out. When I have to feel happy I don't, when I have to be sad I laugh..It's like going a minute back. Like I don't have the time to feel what's going on- like i'm a robot. I do everything perfect. I feel ok with it. But sometimes when I wake up the morning I feel like I want to run-away BUT I don't know from what??? Even if I change things or try them other way around or do both sides I feel the same. I don't know what's the point to try in general.I feel like whatever is going to come it will come whatever you do-so I don't care anymore. I don't want to go back-I certainly don't. But I can't forget my past. Now I see that when I want someting, it hides a double responsibility behind it if you want to keep it. Otherwise you don't want it.So sometimes I want to go to sleep, don't talk, don't want nothing. Everyday I feel like I give 10 things to get 1. So I stop cold sometimes and think. But I feel like everything is a lie, fake. The only thing that helps me last minute before I leave everything and collapse is my memory, my progress 'till now, the targets I make.    As I grow older breaks from life become shorter and work gets a bigger part of me. How am I going to get used to it? Or I want to become immature?      P.S. they tell me i'm kind of the perfectionist person that cannot stand doing mistakes infront of others-but i don't understand it when I do it?

Though I really want to, I feel as if I am addicted to it and it makes it very hard to go a day without it. It definently isn't just a recreational smoke every once in a while thing. I smoke at least a dime bag a day, most of the time, if not always, with the same group of people. I feel like I am just not the same person I used to be 2 years before. Pot has ruined my life, I lost self motivation, dropped out of high school my junior year, and not to mention, it is killing my lungs and breathing capacity. I want to change! Please help! (If anyone has the same idea of quitting, I would like to start emailing you frequently about quitting.)

20090129034248AA6GxAm	Health;Mental Health	Hey guys, please help me. I have a litle brother of me who has a big problem. ( I need your help?	I was in a church with him, and he said he was dizzy. I took him home, & at night he went in comma. We went at hospital , but doctors couldn't  find the problem. He told the doctors that he did not want to be at hospital, & then we went home. When I asked him why he didn't wanna be at hospital, he told me there was someone by the time he was in comma, telling him not to be at hospital , but to follow him. In the following night, he went back in comma, and when he came back, he started running following the door, & when I brought him back, he was seing as if he doesn't recognize me at all, but looking to the window as if there were a friend of his.  Last night, he had a hard time sleeping, & told me he was gonna go to the toelet, & when I followed him , he just said he was done, and told me he wanted to go out alone. When I said you can't unless I follow you, he said: ok, so, may you please wake me up at 01.00 (night), because there someone who is gonna come to pick me up. When I asked him, where he met that someone, he told me that it was that time he went in the toilet.       So, I tolked to someone about it, and told me that he might have taken drugs, which are making him behave in a strange way. And someone told me love matters since he is 15 years old.  But I just don't know , I really wanna have your opinions, in order to help my litle brother while it is slill possible.  ( another thing, is that in the vision, he always see, there's one of the boys who always tease him, ..so in the vision, this guy always seat beside the strong tall black man he sees). Please he,lp me as soon as possible.    Waiting to hear from you.
