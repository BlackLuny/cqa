RZzMse3Haa	YES! They have a verbal month to month agreement and you must still give proper notice.  This is governed by law, not by anything signed or not signed by the tenant.<br>  <br>  If it is for a general lease violation or for no reason, then you must give 30 days notice. (60 is required in some states)  If they have not paid the rent then you can serve a 3 day pay or quite notice.|`|4UBxVIYFaa	Yes, you do need to do so.  In any state, absent a written lease agreement, both you and the tenant fall under what is called a 'statutory lease', such being a legal agreement based upon the statutes of your state.<br>  <br>  Please check the rental statutes of your given state.  Such statutes will determine obligations of both tenant and landlord under such statutory lease conditions.|`|8063947433f50c3e93546a4ba2133fdcaa	Yes, you need to give 30 days|`|PxoKseAiaa	Most likely yes.  You would need to give them a 30 day notice to vacate.  If they do not, then you can go through the process of eviction.|`|pNy8lakjaa	If they haven't paid you rent, yes you still have to. <br>  <br>  If they have, and you want them out of there.. its just 8 more days an you can give them 30 days notice.|`|dip4oxB5aa	You need to give your tenant a thirty day written notice and better that you mail it to them certified mail and save your record of the receipt so you have proof you sent it along with a copy ot the notice with your receipt.|`|d1431527582f8f414e0e05855712ef5faa	You need to check with your local municipality. But I'd guess yes, if they are paying month to month, then you need to give them 30 days.|`|fa49fc3460e0c0dfb37b6cda6aa1dd56aa	If they are late with rent...that's when you give a notice to quit.<br>  <br>  If you just want them to move out...you give a 30 day notice to vacate.<br>  <br>  Some states require more notice...other states require less notice.<br>  <br>  CT...requires 30 days.

You'd just be setting yourself for all kinds of problems.  Since you're only 19, you should be working on your own financial independence and establishment.  You should be working on your own credit and building up your own nest egg.<br>  <br>  Have your own bank account and your own credit card.

AA11966821	Once you turn 18, you are liable for filing your tax returns.  Get those returns filed.  Seek advise from a tax accountant and/or tax attorney if necessary.  Failure to file is a federal offense that can get you thrown in jail for a few years.  As an adult, "I didn't know" is not a valid or acceptable excuse.  Every American by the age of 10 has heard of the IRS and knows you have to file your tax returns!  Get on this urgently and get it done.|`|Tyq8OYm1aa	The requirement to file is based on your INCOME, not your age or dependent status.|`|GUuE3655aa	Well, here is the thing... If you made less than 3500, your Mom can claim you until the age of 24 if you're a full-time student... IF YOU'RE A full-time student. That is the key there, and if she is providing more than half of your support for 12 months out the year, not to mention... If you are a full-time student over the age of 18 and she is providing for your educational expenses, then yes she can claim you. The only thing that can stop her from claiming you is the amount of income you make during the year. If it's more than 8,950, then no, you must file your own tax return.|`|59744c9a78f602ddb3bfdccb3f3baa25aa	No you wont get penalized rofl lol, well in a way I guess since you can't use your personal exemption ammount (3,500). Your mom probably put you as her dependant though, almost 100% certain :)<br>  <br>  You most likely won't owe any taxes, just add 300 to your earned income , if it's less than 5450 that's your standard deduction, if its more than that then your standard ded. is 5450.<br>  <br>  To put it in simple terms if you made less than 5450 (earned income) then you will get all your taxes back. If you made more than that then you prob. won't get back all the taxes with held from your paycheck. Of course if you have unearned income it gets worse depending on how much you got.<br>  <br>  I think the 1040EZ might be different in the standard deduction ammounts though , someone could chime in if they know since I just mostly deal with 1040's.|`|AA10920682	First ask her because both of you can't claim you, if not then file you won't get penalized unless you owe. If you paid taxes out of your check then file you'll probably get a little something back in fact I'm sure of it. It may not be much like 5 or 6 hundred fed and 1 or 2 hundred state.|`|5IXu09ATaa	every country has a minimum salary level until which you need not pay any tax. if your net income falls till that level you need not file your tax returns. <br>  <br>  for example in India as long as your net annual income does not exceed Rs. 1 lac you need not file tax returns. <br>  <br>  If your income exceeds 1 lac for the financial year it is mandatory for you to file your tax returns. If you do not it is a crime as per law and you can be fined or even imprisoned based on the amount of tax you owe the country. <br>  <br>  <br>  cheers,<br>  Anand<br>  <a href="http://anandvijayakumar.blogspot.com" rel="nofollow">http://anandvijayakumar.blogspot.com</a><br>  You can also post your queries at anands-finance-group@googlegroups.com
MmTe8W8uaa	If this third person is your employee and the joint bank account is a clever way of paying the person without actually writing a check to the person, then you and the person must pay all taxes (including social security, income tax, etc.) that would apply if you simply paid the person directly.<br>  <br>  If this third person is not working for you and you are giving this person access to your money purely as a gift, the third person does not pay any tax on it.  However, YOU may be required to pay gift tax.  For whatever reason, the U.S. government has decided to impose gift tax on the persons who give gifts, not on those who receive them.|`|xvPsAonzaa	The simple answer is No.  No one would have to pay any taxes on a withdrawal from a checking account.  The only thing about a bank account that you would have to file on your taxes is interest that is paid to you by the bank and that 1099 would be sent to the primary account holder at the end of the year.|`|snh9wzpnaa	When you set up an account, you provide one soc sec number for them to use.  This soc sec number pays all the taxes on all of the interest from that account.

And if you're able to work there i would ask for a application. <br>  <br>  Don't forget that it is always a good idea to hand in a resume with your application.

UQWusO1waa	i had the same question about cash crate, and all the others. So 2 weeks ago i decided to just try it CC that is. Well ,i logged in and tryed to figure it out, never really did. so i started answering "things"  then you have to go back and "submit"  your answer, what ever it was you answered, (not sure) . Then it shows pending money due mine was $35 after a 3 days of doing it some each day. and the amount hat was in my "pay" account was $5.50. no more money was ever put in my pay amount. after  a week  i canceled the thing. never did figure it out. so i guess the $5.50 went to someone else. all you do is go thru ads of things for you to buy. ASKIng for your e-mail #, (REQUIRED) and phone #, which i all-ways use a fake one on any site that requires one.you have to be a fool to give that out. ANYWAY  now i get about 60  spam e-mails  everyday, and have unsubscribe from each one separately. so some i just delete. too many too do , i have had hundreds so far and still coming. So I think the site only exists to get e-mail numbers that they get paid for. to sell to spamers.and any body that makes money are the ones that spam and get people like us to give it a go. That is why they are always on here telling you to go their site to join. let me know if you get it to work for you.|`|679x4WOqaa	There's this great site that gives you points for searching the web.

There's nothing free about cashcrate and they automatically subscribe your name and email to any number of subscriptions which unfortunately you will be billed later for them.  To avoid becoming a victim of unsolicited emails, you are well advised to stay away from cashcrate, because ultimately you are the one who becomes a victim of email spam.

DO NOT wear your street clothes. make sure you ask to speak to a manager when you turn your application in; if they don't have a face to associate with the ap, you're less likely to get hired. you want to make a good impression,|`|Gun3UGzaaa	Bring a pen with you, along with your ID, your social security card, and a list of your references including their phone number.

If the lawyer says that what they did is illegal, I would kindly write a letter requesting what they promised you including in the letter that you spoke to a lawyer about the issue and was informed........

Also, be sure to check your email occasionally for those offers that require email confirmation otherwise you won't get credited for completing the offer properly.<br>  <br>  Here are a few tips for filling out offers:<br>  1. Read the offer carefully so you know exactly what to do to get the points.<br>  2. Delete cookies before every offer<br>  3. Complete offer with realistic information<br>  4. Use a browser that accepts cookies and turn your security down<br>  5. Let each page load completely<br>  <br>  Also remember that even though most of the time you'll get the points 5-10 minutes after completing the offer, some may take up to a day or more (depending on the offer). So don't worry if you don't see the points just keep going they will appear if you've done everything correctly.<br>  <br>  Step 3: Claim Your Prize<br>  <br>  After you have enough points you can now go to "Available Prizes" and see what you can cash those points in for. This is the fun part. =)<br>  <br>  They have a ton of prizes. You'll see stuff like consoles (Xbox, PS3, Wii), video games, iPods, etc. There are Xbox Live cards in the "Xbox" section and will be emailed to you. Physical prizes like iPods and video games will deliver so make sure your address is correct before you claim a prize that requires shipping.<br>  <br>  Also, something many people don't realize is that if you don't see anything you like you can actually send a request for a custom prize. Just send support a ticket with a link to what you want from amazon.com and they'll let you know how many points you'll need. Basically it will be a point for every dollar.<br>  <br>  * 3 days ago<br>  <br>  Source(s):<br>  i'm a member, & its 100% legit.<br>  just sign up and start getting free stuff(:... and sign up.|`|4omsYxWSaa	if you're interested, you can do surveys online for extra money, I know a good site thats free to join  <br>  check my blog for info and Proof of Payments<br>  <br>  <a href="http://surveyinfobase.blogspot.com/" rel="nofollow">http://surveyinfobase.blogspot.com/</a>|`|2hcgJW8eaa	join thefreebiegroup.com and get free stuff

9fed39238f286d3cd62baeb926026293aa	If you havent closed yet then you havent bought the house yet..plain and simple you dont own the house until you have closed on it and have the keys in your hand. I saw our house 3 times, once with my realtor on a short notice and the owners were still in it and made it hard to view, the 2nd time my realtor asked them to leave so we could view the house at ease and the 3rd time was our final walk through. Also remeber They have been known to pull a credit report the morning of closing to make sure your DTI ratio hasnt changed and YES they can and will deny you the loan at closing. I have seen it happen. Make sure you arent buying any big purchases, opening new lines of credit or running your current credit up. Tell your wife to hold off until you have the keys and the closing papers in your hands. Good Luck|`|AA11173563	not with out the agent. It is breaking and entering|`|2N6oTOLQaa	If there is still a lock box at the house you could ask your realtor to let you in, just as you would have done when you first looked at the house. I did this when I bought my house after the offers were accepted but before everything closed. If the paperwork is already signed and the house is off the market, then the lock box has probably been removed and you would be best to just wait until you get the keys.|`|23SkYEw5aa	As a seller, I would say NO.  I would have the lock box removed as soon as the contract became ratified and the contingencies removed.<br>  <br>  WHY?  Because buyers will nit pick the house to death.  This is normal, but can kill a sale.<br>  <br>  From a sellers stand point, after a contract is ratified, but before the settlement, the buyers should only come back to the house for the home inspection and the day before (or the morning of) the settlement to make sure that everything is still as it was when they purchased.<br>  <br>  Otherwise, (vacate or not), I wouldn't let the buyer or ANYONE back into the house (including the agent, etc).|`|4UBxVIYFaa	You are OK to view the premises again, as long as the listing agent and/or the current owner allow your visit.  Of course, if closing is now completed, it is YOUR house, and you can go whenever you desire.<br>  <br>  However, understand that, until the premises are in your name, you should secure permission from the current owners to do what you desire.|`|ej9ijnS7aa	You are very wrong the house is NOT bought until the closing takes place.  I hope wifey isn't going out and spending any money until AFTER that closing.  Things can and DO often happen especially give the closing is a month away.<br>  <br>  Sure go look and measure but buy anything, no way.  <br>  <br>  I think after an appropriate number of times I would be a little irritated at you wanting to keep going back.<br>  <br>  Thumbs up to the The Estate Guys answer.|`|WdGI3QoOaa	Yes, it is normal.<br>  <br>  Make sure you have permission to enter etc.  Your agent should go with you.<br>  The risks are if some one gets hurt on the property, who pays insurance etc...<br>  Also, some the newness may ware off prior to the close of escrow and your wife will want to cancel and find another.<br>  Why don't you see if you can close early?|`|d1431527582f8f414e0e05855712ef5faa	You shouldn't be entering the property without express permission.

SOpzMN9Eaa	Yes you may. The first thing you should do is go to your local Bank of America and report your debit card lost/stolen. This way you can prevent any unauthorized activity on your account. They will cancel your old debit card and reissue you a new one which you will receive in about 7-10 business days, make sure you reset your pin also.<br>  <br>  Next, you can withdrawal at the teller line if you have your check book you can write a check out to yourself or to "cash" and present your identification. If you do not have your check book, a debit slip can be prepared the teller will most likely ask you for your account number if you don't know it you will have to give her your social to verify your account. Of course, she will ask for your identification aswell. To withdraw from your checking there is no fee, but to withdraw from your savings there may or may not be a fee depending on the type of account that you have.<br>  <br>  Ummm, I think that's about it. good luck!|`|AA11173563	sure just write a check and cancel the old card and get them to issue you a new one.

bZe2bSMdaa	Yes! Provided you have the qualifications they require for a specific position it is possible. You won't get rich, but you can earn a good salary.<br>  <br>  I suggest you do some research if you have a "pet" charity or organization and see what they offer as far as positions and what they provide as salary and benefits.<br>  <br>  The salary will also vary depending on location and, with some, the specific office for which you work.<br>  <br>  Also check into their annual report, you want a nice salary, but you don't want to feel guilty for your earnings if they limit the good work of those for whom you're working. They should have a higher percentage of income going into the field versus operating expenses.|`|AA10305589	Well, yes it is possible, nonprofits and charities hire people in all sorts of positions. Background, experience, and knowledge of nonprofit operations would be a plus, but not necessary.  You can build up your nonprofit 'credit' and get your foot in the door at a charity of your choice by volunteering for them first.  Just so you know, unfortunately, right now npos and charities are suffering quite badly due to stock market lows which affect not only the investments of the npo itself, but the number and size of grants from foundations funded by stocks, the number and severity of decreases and cuts in government funding, and decrease in donations from invidiuals who are affected by the economic situation.  So it may not be the best time to be getting into the nonprofit arena,  but it's not impossible if you are truly committed.|`|285c8243564acc36040f290206c3ff28aa	Sure.  Larger nonprofits pay better.  You can see some salaries if you go to www.guidestar.org and put in some local charities you know of, like perhaps the local hospital and your school.  Go to the right to the part labeled "990" and look at their tax forms.  It will list the salaries of the top five people if they make more than $50,000 a year.  That will let you know what the possibilities are.

My very first job was as an editorial assistant - but that is many years ago!<br>  <br>  However, I think you just have to be honest about this as there is no shame in being unemployed.

There are many fly by night businesses that get materials do jobs then never pay for the materials they use, thus, people get liens filed against them. Just check them out well.

Mine was received by my bank today but for some reason will not be posted until Wednesday.|`|TLcON6Inaa	If you haven't received it yet I would check the "where is my refund"  <a href="http://www.irs.gov/individuals/article/0,,id=96596,00.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.irs.gov/individuals/article/0...</a> to make sure it still says today. A LOT of refunds are being delayed.<br>  <br>  The IRS transmits returns at 11am so if WMR still says today and the bank says they don't have it you can call the IRS, they will probably tell you to give it 5 business days to post but you can call and bug them anyway!|`|8PkDysodaa	Did you do a simple pay with H&R block?

One thing you can do is contact the Dept of Labor and industries in your state and file a claim. This will cost you nothing and they will do most of all the work for you. <br>  <br>  This of course will not put you into your Boss's good graces, but could help you to get the hours. Unfortuately his reasoning for less hours is a fair reason and you may still not get the hours after the claim. Which means you may tick off you Boss and have no results from it. This would be unfortunate. I would just try to see if there is another waitress job you can get and do the 2 job thing or switch to a new company/restaurant.<br>  <br>  Sorry!|`|ckfHkeRgaa	maybe you should just look for a new job.  Its not fair but in this economy one of the few industries that's not being hit hard is food service. <br>  <br>  maybe try a new job.

78x7REt8aa	Standard Procedure is that the claim can be docketed in the County in which you are employed, and then the laws of garnishment apply to that of the County/State in which the judgment is docketed.   <br>  <br>  Best answer would come from your HR department where you work, our the county courthouse.  They handle the payment of all garnishments.
5KxklhJCaa	Can an ex-employer disclose information to a current employer regarding reasons you were terminated by law ?<br>  in the US...........<br>  YES...YES...YES|`|2N6oTOLQaa	Contrary to popular belief, a former employer can say anything and everything about you even if its negative, as long as its all true. The gray area is when something is someones personal opinion. Anything that is cold hard facts can be shared. For example, an employee can say "so and so missed 3 days of work in a 1 month period" which is just facts, but it could be a legal gray area if they said "so and so had poor attendance"|`|d331dd95c4a1ebbb6ed4bd0996d3a0b6aa	there is no law only urban myth, they can answer any question as long as it is the truth|`|vBfVM97naa	No, but depends on who you work for.

RhEhzGbraa	You will need Garage Keepers Legal Liability Insurance to protect customers' vehicles, a Commercial Automobile Policy to provide liability coverage for accidents to any third party, i.e. while driving your customer's vehicle around the block your driver rear ends another vehicle--the Commercial Automobile would repair the damage to the vehicle which was rear ended and the Garage Keepers Legal Liability would pay to repair the damage to your customer's vehicle.  You will also need a Commercial General Liability Policy and Workers Compensation (required if you have employees).  <br>  <br>  Note that the Garage Keepers Legal Liability Insurance Policy is a specialized policy that is tailored to provide coverage for automobiles left in the care, custody and control of parking lots, valet services and tow trucks.  <br>  <br>  You should consult an independent insurance agent who specializes in business insurance to review all your insurance needs and provide you with quotes.<br>  <br>  I hope this helps.

If you opt for a check in the first place, the delay is only about 1 to 1 1/2 weeks.|`|AA11488813	its because the IRS wants to know that you were able to get money that was owed to you.

FBmahP95aa	I work for a wholesale company and am therefore in touch with retailers on a daily basis. There are two types of products which do well in the current economic climate: very low cost items and custom created items. If you a planning on selling clothes of any kind, tailor made clothing would probably not be a bad idea. Have some examples of what you can do in the store and have people customize where they want. This gives you several advantages: 1. Your work will vary and you will seldom be bored because you have to make 25 of the same dress. 2. Even though most people are strapped for money, people are still willing to pay for custom work. In the end they will have something unique that nobody else has.|`|dI6jfLM9aa	you could do over the shoulder bags those are always fun.. :)|`|UEHsqSaTaa	Sweaters and socks???|`|J6JFiNL8aa	since your into sewing do something that from you....made by hand and unique...|`|19pBM4GSaa	make a really nice dress ! try and match the dress to the style of your friends shop if that makes sense. xxx can never go wrong xxx good luck an let us know how you get on xxx

NEkssyeAaa	You will be fine, i bought a mauchette(not sure how spelt) from Ebay 3 months ago. I bought some hunter knives aswell. As long as you aint going to take them with you in the public , you will be fine. Custom wont seize you. trust me, it can be used for decoration purposes|`|2N6oTOLQaa	Is this a weapon or is it art? That is the deciding factor. If its a dull sword that is intended to be hung on a wall as a decoration, then it is art and you shouldn't have any problems. If its a sharp sword that can actually be used as a weapon, then it needs to be imported as a weapon with proper permits. <br>  <br>  My sister bought a sword in the UK and had no problems whatsoever carrying it through customs into the United States. We asked about it and we were informed that the sword is considered art. I realize this is going the opposite way as what you are going, but the concept is the same. <br>  <br>  Also, if you are buying it on ebay, and the seller is offering international shipping, it is their responsibility to make sure the product gets to you.|`|4uB0bbhnaa	firstly it is illegal to bring a sword,if it is an offensive weapon,<br>   into the UK , so it will be seized<br>  <br>  but just beware you might be prosecuted too<br>   if it is classed as an offensive weapon|`|b1NMh5K2aa	Yes they will probably seize it as it is a weapon
4f3GfrN6aa	You would have to check with a bank who offers an online share trading account to see if you could be a signatory to the account with a parent.  However, it's not really appropriate for a kid.  Trading shares for money is hard even for adults.  Very few people do it successfully, and the amount you would need to start would probably be out of your reach anyway.  You'd need at least $500, plus extra to cover brokerage, which is the cost of buying and selling the shares.  <br>  <br>  You could buy some cans of drink, make some ice, and borrow an esky, and go down to the park or the beach on a hot day and sell cold cans of drink to people for more than it cost you to buy them.  For example, if you bought 20 cans of Coke, and it cost you $15 for a pack, you would need to divide 20 by 15, to give you the cost of the Coke cans (about $1.35).  So if you sold each can for $150, you'd make a profit of 0.15x20= $3.  Doesn't sound like much, but if you did that every weekend, and perhaps sold the cans for more, you'd make some regular money.  Warren Buffet, the richest man in the world, started when he was a teenager doing that with a box of Coke bottles at the beach.  I think he made a 17 cent profit.  You gotta start small.<br>  <br>  Best wishes|`|F2JEvYX7aa	no, you cannot buy stock at 12 years old. How about trying house work, dog walking, babysitting.

4ZNl4V3Oaa	Jury pay is taxable.  However, some employers require that you turn jury pay over to the employer in order to have paid absence from the job without using your vacation time.

AuxlgxjBaa	DOCUMENT  DOCUMENT  DOCUMENT  Take a copy of your electric bill, your lease agreement (hopefully, the landlord put something in writing about fixing those issues) and pictures of the problem areas.

BUT if you're in the US, a court WILL award your landlord an order of eviction, and if/when LL sues you for back rent, they'll award him that as well. You can't just not pay rent. In some states, you may be able to withhold the rent, or a portion of the rent, but there is a process you must go through [which involves putting your money in an escrow account with the court, or a savings account separate from your own and putting the rent monies in it; and informing your landlord in writing that you're withholding, why you're withholding, where your money is being held, and that you will release it to him when he's completed necessary repairs].|`|mjTmQzvFaa	I 100% agree with ee , also call the bldg. inspector and have them come and write up a report and take that too when you go to court.

Never carry a balance.  <br>  Never charge more than 30% of your available credit limit at any time during the month, if you do, make an extra payment.<br>  Also, do not open any credit cards 6 months before applying for a loan.<br>  /|`|ed7d52fe8334c4d034acc2f4c34f0b44aa	I don't see what difference it makes if you always made your payments, have no arrears etc.|`|MmTe8W8uaa	The number or frequency of past addresses do not affect your credit score.

DGFu03Q3aa	Dear Bark:  I have seen this several times and it has been an accounting error by the NJ company. Unfortunately you will have to file to get your NJ with holding back (file as non-resident and exclude all of your income). If you ever see this again make sure you bring it to the attention of the firm ASAP and get it stopped.<br>  <br>  The sales tax on the new car you bought maybe deductable if you use Sch A. Sch A. is used when you have a mortgage and pay property taxes otherwise it is rare to use it because your standard deduction is more than the Sch. A items. <br>  <br>  This advice was prepared based on our understanding of the tax law in effect at the time it was written as it applies to the facts that you provided.

Since Washington State doesn't have an income tax, no state tax shall be submitted there.    It was valid of the employer to take the tax; and you will owe much of it.<br>  <br>  If you did not travel to New Jersey for work, and were instead paid by a company that happens to be located in New Jersey, then you're office was more likely your home (or a satellite).  As such, the employer withheld taxes in error.  But, they paid New Jersey state with those funds.  So, you'll need to file a tax return with New Jersey showing that you didn't live there.  You should get 100% of that state tax as a refund.  Note:  You'll need to claim this income on your 2009 tax return you'll do next year.<br>  <br>  Regarding the Automobile Sales Tax.... When you itemize, this will go in the Personal Property Tax section.  If you use TurboTax, it'll ask you the questions.  Use the Sales Tax standard deductions and then say yes when it asks about major purchases.  Then, add the description of the vehicle(s), the amount paid, the sales tax paid, and the percentage of the sales tax for your locality.

If you don't have 3.5% to put down,  you should wait until you do. Keep in mind there are also closing costs (roughly another 3%) to pay in addition to your 3.5% down payment.

This is a load of BULL..... You relally don.t have to care what your FICO score is if you don't use credit.You will tend to spen 12 - 18% more than you will with cash. That is why the credit card companies "prey" on college students. They know that you will spend money you don't have and "enslave" you to them for years and years of less than full payments. I know, I know, you say you will pay it off every month but sooner or later it won't get done and if it is not arrested soon after, you have started down the vortex and it is hard to get out.

Just because we in the west are not in shackles doesn't mean we aren't slaves. Do the research. The Banking elite control the markets, inflation, interest rates,recessions/depressions etc...Not to mention every military and politician…puppets…<br>  <br>  The concept of Income Tax itself was a temporary War measures act that was never abolished. Taxes derived from labour do not go to subsidise Health, Education, or Infrastructure (Municipal/Property taxes do) but rather, to pay off this Interest that the ''legal counterfeiters'' have charged their puppets in the government (the souls of which they own completely), who then pass it on to us. This is a pyramid and extortion.<br>  <br>  Governments are subservient to the International bankers, but still have the power to enact ''laws/legislation'' at the behest of their rulers and impose severe penalties to any and all who oppose them. The IRS and other Federal agencies were created to enforce these baseless rules that only apply to the people. I know I sound like the biggest consiracy theorist. Trust me, I am not. Conspiracies are to be told around a campfire. This is fact. I have spent nearly a decade researching this and speaking to people far more knowledgeable than myself on the subject. To get a better understanding of the history of International Banking I urge everyone to take the time to watch the documentary: The Money Masters.<br>  <br>  You can find it on Google Video or YouTube. Take what you want from it, leave the rest. Just open your eyes and mind to the smoke and mirrors that surround and engulf us. What is the solution to all this? Not violence, not protests, but EDUCATION. Personal financial literacy is paramount and unfortunately/conveniently not taught much in school (I wonder why?...) If more people understood what is really going on and could control money (and their urges to live beyond their means) we wouldn't fall prey to all the traps the Money Masters have set-up. We wouldn't be in this current economic maelstrom. They created the entire economic system we are in and it is spreading all over the world. The goal isn't to destroy it overnight. That would lead to anarchy which is even worse! Use the existing one to your advantage and make sure others do as well. That is all we can do in this one life. It's all about baby steps, but consistent ones that will eventually become a thunderous parade and celebration.<br>  <br>  Take care of your own finances and teach others to manage their affairs and then the Banks will be what they were meant to be...Partners in all of our success. It takes 2 to tango (cliche I know!!!) so we have to start leading for a change. Power to the People (John Lennon).<br>  <br>  Own a business and take advantage of all the ''legal'' loopholes the Revenue Agencies accord entrepreneurs. Don't miss a single one, every penny counts! At least this way you will minimize the burn and have more after-tax dollars to pay-down any debts you have (preferably good debts) and LIVE WITHIN YOUR MEANS. That is a concrete solution out of this and future fiscal messes that will surely arise. Take control, prepare yourselves now, and the future will be much brighter, regardless how omnipotent the Money Masters are...they are just people like you and I. Despite the immeasurable hardships being experienced everywhere, the world is still such an incredible place<br>  <br>  Thanks for reading this and best to everyone.

hfUu3MWeaa	Here are some suggestions on ways to advertise on a small budget. <br>  <br>  1. Networking - If you've never done networking I would suggest that you join a BNI group. BNI is all about passing referrals but it also teaches you about how to network effectively. I also have success in attending Chamber of Commerce functions.<br>  <br>  2. Barter - Is a great way to get low cost advertising. You trade your services for other business owners services. I take part in the ITEX network and they have several advertising mediums that take part in their barter network.<br>  <br>  3. Indoor Advertising - Okay I'm biased because I own an indoor advertising company but I started out as a customer before I bought a franchise. The key to getting the most bang for you buck is to target people who are most likely to be your customers. If you know your best customers are young women just put your ads in locations that young women frequent. <br>  <br>  4. Pay-Per-Click Advertising - Yahoo and Google both have pay per click advertising that can be effective and low cost if you have a website. The pay per click ads are the ads down the right side of the page when you do a search on Yahoo or Google. Since you have a candle business you would place ads for people searching for "candles". Typically you pay 10-75 cents everytime someone clicks one of your ads that brings them to your website. Hopefully once people get to your site they buy something off your site. It's not too difficult to set up your own campain. My company helps people set up accounts so feel free to contact me if interested.|`|9ozLBt5Qaa	A popular method is to use classifieds.

Stick to the first 1-2 pages on Google to start.  <br>  <br>  Then start a Blog on Google's (Blogger).  Easy to setup and post to.  Always include your URL at the end of your Blog entries.  Post to other people's Blogs and always leave your URL at the bottom of each entry.  <br>  <br>  Engage in Forum marketing in Groups like this and on other Business related sites like HomeBasedBusiness.com, Startup.Biz.  Again search on Google for these types of forums and you'll have a nice list to sign up to and post thoughtful entries.  <br>  <br>  Write keyword rich articles and submit to 5-10 popular Article Directories like ezinearticles,article dashboard, etc...<br>  <br>  Create accounts at several Social Bookmarking Sites like Digg, Technorati, Delicious and bookmark your articles once they have been accepted as well as your main webpage and Blogpage URL.  <br>  <br>  Make a profile on MySpace, FaceBook, and network with other business minded people in the Business Groups.  You need to target who to contact because people are fed up of Spam and strangers adding them so don't go overboard.  Post Bulletins, add posts to Forums, add selected friends and send personalized messages so they know you are not some FriendBot software  hehe<br>  <br>  From time to time when you have something very newsworthy like a new product release or a new partner joining your business etc...you can write a Press Release and submit to directories like PRFree, 24-7 Press release, free press releases etc...<br>  <br>  Join a few traffic exchange sites like TrafficSwarm where you can click on other people's web pages and earn credits.  In exchange for these credits, your website will appear throughout the site's network and other members will be able to click on your web page.  The more credits you have, the more visitors you can get.  Admittedly, the traffic you will get is not the most targeted because many people just click to earn credits and don't pay attention.  This is why you may want to consider putting audio, or better yet, video on your page so it will attract much more attention.  Video marketing is a great/creative way to spread your message rather than just using simple text.<br>  <br>  Use a site traffic analysis tool like Google Analytics or StatCounter to see what drives most traffic and stick to what works.  You need to maximize your productivity and have better conversion rates with time.  Stick to what works for you.  I have seen solid results by employing all of the above strategies for my business page and have had to do so consistently for months so don't expect huge results overnight.  The effort must be consistent and multi-faceted.  Be patient and have focus.  There are more strategies than the ones I have listed.  Those are just the main free ones and the tip of the iceberg in Internet Marketing.  later on you can engage in Video Blogging, Video marketing, Pay Per Click Advertising and many more.  Web 2.0 has become 3.0 and soon 4.0!!!  <br>  <br>  The main thing is that once you get increased traffic to your page you need to be able to contact those targeted leads.  Make sure you have an Opt-In Form on your main page where people can voluntarily leave their contact info (name, email).  Set up an autoresponder with , Aweber, or iContact etc…You can write a handful of emails and start an automated email campaign so your potential customers will be in the loop as to what you are doing.  Maybe later on they will be interested in purchasing whatever product/service you are marketing or becoming your business partner if you are looking for partners. Also make sure your contact info is clearly visible so your visitors can always contact you. <br>  <br>  Don't ignore offline marketing as well like business cards, flyers, catch cards, word of mouth to all your family, friends, and their referrals.  There is no better promo than that.<br>  <br>  If you brand YOU INC. and show people you have valuable information to share with them you will have succeeded in earning trust and establishing yourself as a knowledgeable leader.  That is the goal here: Attraction marketing.  Let me know how your online assault works out and keep in touch!

HOWEVER, because of the size of the loan (Jumbo), the rate goes up to about 6.25%.  And, at least Property Taxes are a real fact of life.  So, with those two factors, the "someone" can now get a loan for 1.85 million.  This assumes 1% property tax (e.g. no mello roos or special bonds for the area).|`|36aPSk4oaa	obviously you're not the one making $500k, right?<br>  <br>  Make $500K.  After taxes take home $250k.

Figure, $30K in property taxes, $35k in utilities and maintenance, leaving $60k for mortgage payments.  That would cover about $800,000 in loans.

They think they will wreck the house, fill the front garden with junk and keep coal in the bath. Unfortunately, some do.<br>  <br>  Your local council will have lists of private landlords that they have vetted who will look more favourably on social tenants.

vawiXqNHaa	A Portfolio is basically a way for an employer to figure out who you are and what you can contribute to their company. A portfolio should contain a current and updated resume, any awards or achievements you have accomplished, any certifications or diplomas you have received, volunteer experiences you've had, projects you have worked on during your higher education, a list of references, and recommendation letters. You can buy actual portfolio cases at any office store like staples or office max or you can put everything in a binder. Just make sure everything is organized and put in order of importance. Hope that helps!!!

The good news is he did find another job, doing basically the same thing for another bank, but it's over an hour commute for him.

JNDDFz33aa	Price, income or cross?<br>  <br>  I think dildo's will always be needed lol so are probably fairly inelsatic to changes in price.  <br>  <br>  As far as income elasticity goes I guess I would certainly class a dildo as a normal good (if not essential) so as income decreases I think demand may fall slightly but not much.  They take up more than a tiny amount of income so this may effect elasticity.<br>  <br>  So far as cross elasticity, i think that depends on the price of vibrators and batteries too!!  Of course dildos need no batteries, but if for some reason the price of vibrators and batteries fell, i think demand for dildos may also fall!!<br>  <br>  Well,with regards to the law of diminishing returns, it depends on whether you mean in the dildo factory or when they are being used?<br>  <br>  In the factory as more and more people came into the factory to produce dildos production would initally go up.  However if the numbers continued to increase then people would get in each others way and efficiency would drop.  This would lead to dimishing returns.<br>  <br>  If you mean when they are being used, well i suppose you could have fun with one, then more fun with two (assuming you could coordinate your hand movements that is) but if you were alone and given any further dildos then they would be of little use and you may roll over onto them or something which would reduce pleasure i imagine.|`|bibIAhN9aa	oh the wit, the japes, what comedy star did u fall from?<br>  A joke as subtle as a sledge hammer. u must be a yank, don't worry, it will all be over one day and then you'll be able to rest.....

I can remember years ago, you just went and got a job, now they want to check your credit, check your background, take this test, blah blah blah.  Hire someone already that's the way I look at it for real. <br>  <br>  Just keep putting in applications and then check back with them after a week or so to see if they filled the position.  From what I have seen US Companies keep people on their payrolls that don't even do their jobs.  Then you know also, alot of people hire people they know and all that good stuff, and that only creates more problems within their company.  I just don't get it I really don't.  <br>  <br>  Also try some head hunters/temporary agencies.

If you have paid too much tax you will get a refund at tax time so it is like saving the money.
vCePK8gMaa	MA has very tough landlord tenant laws, lead paint laws and is a very tenant friendly state. You should not take the chance - friend, co-worker or otherwise.     Another thought, it is never a good idea to rent to friends, family or co-workers. Very rarely do these situations end well.     You are going to be a landlord in MA, so you had better get to know the laws and join a landlord association - they provide a wealth of information to help you cover your rear and avoid problems.    In Massachusetts, a state law says that children under 6 years old cannot live in apartments that contain lead paint. It does not matter if only his name is on the lease, if the 3 year old child lives there, you would be liable if  the child suffers lead poisoning.    MA law also clearly says that landlords cannot discriminate against families with young children because their apartments are not deleaded.     The only way you can comply with the law is to delead the apartment, a process that can easily cost $10,000 per unit.     There are some exceptions. If you who live in the building and rent out only one other unit, such as a duplex, you are allowed to refuse families with children.|`|b5ed16c940be1868f0aa615afa8d8e15aa	You know that there's a chance of lead paint, and you also know there there's a chance that he might ask her to move in, and you seem to be okay with this. If it happens, YES, you will be held liable. Get the paint tested, and if there is lead, write up a solid rental agreement stating everybody living there MUST be on the lease as a tenant or a resident, and that children under six cannot reside there due to the presence of LBP.     Your county's dept of health or building inspectors will probably be able to test the paint at a low cost.|`|2zEGBgL1aa	I own several old multifamily properties in MA.  It's a tricky situation with the lead laws.  you can't have anyone under 6 living there, yet you can't discriminate against tenants because they have children.    since you are thinking of renting to a coworker, you could tell that person the situation, and hope they are trustworthy and keep the child away from any loose chipping paint, and let you know when there "is" loose chipping paint.  you are taking a risk, since the girlfriend could make things uncomfortable for you.  so that's where you have to estimate your risk level and be comfortable with it.  if you would like to know if and where the lead paint is, there are test kits you can get from home depot or lowes.  these kits are not foolproof and have know bearing in court, but will give you an "off the record" assessment of your situation.  MA also has some legal solutions to the problem,  like if you know you have lead paint, you can paint it with a special encapsulating paint and just make sure it dosn't chip.  there's lots of stuff to know about LBP.  it's worth doing some online reading on the subject.|`|Ti0q1Btiaa	I won't tell my age, but I was raised with lead paint on every house we lived in until I was 21.    At that time, removal of lead paint, in order to repaint, was done with a blow torch.  Used properly and safely, it just melted the paint and could be scraped, WITHOUT any airborne particles to inhale.    I lived in Galveston for a while and every old house there has lead paint.  Now, if a child should chew on furniture with lead paint, I can see the danger.  Personally, I think the EPA is staffed with ex-insane asylum residents.    This doesn't answer your question but under your laws, that may be considered endangerment of a child.

Look for items that are out of season----I bought 10 Yankee Starter Jersey at $2 each in JC Penny and sold em on E-bay for $25 each. Look for things on final close-out at going out of business sales.

Ultimately, it's YOUR responsibility to thoroughly research the areas you're moving into before you move into them. This includes calling the local police precinct and inquiring about the crime rate in that area, and the kinds of incidents that have occurred. Your landlord isn't responsible for your perceived sense of safety, or the safety of your items, and can't be held liable. If you just break the contract, you will be penalized and a court will award your landlord $$$.     Consider getting a roommate, or a tazer, or a can of mace/pepper spray that attaches to your keyring at the very least. A dog from a breed known to protect its territory and its people. Motion lights set up around the perimeter of the property, if there aren't any.  Or moving, if you can afford to.|`|EXJfoGtAaa	This is definitely a health and safety issue.  Google landlord tenant laws in your state.  A landlord has the responsibility to provide a safe environment.  You probably cannot break the lease without giving your landlord time to cure the problem and even then you will have to go to court.  An isolated break in may not be sufficient grounds, but why has the security company visited you 24 times?    realtor.sailor|`|a8739afe3eb36903aeb01a148df62aaeaa	halo! just sharing my opinion, I think if you are the owner of the house and you want somebody to rent it, would you informed your prospective tenants about it or rather not? because if they will be so truthful with their actions, do you think they can find a tenant for that house. With regards to 3 years contract, I assumed you had a copy of it , try to review on matters pertaining to early termination or try to get help to somebody you think you can trust to explain it to you further , one more thing..bear in mind..People Lie..we always do..and I think it's time for you to  learn the Basics of Self Defense as you've said you wanted to be safe and no one is there for you...so grow up and be brave..don't think of negative or bad things that happened on that house , be the master of your faith , if you do you are just scaring yourself to death...live free and worry free..make sure the doors and windows have locks if you can live with a dog try to have one...it's a man's best friend...and what else..don't trust anyone..be smart and be vigilant ok..Goodluck!
EXJfoGtAaa	You will be doing yourself a disservice by working with more than one Realtor.  If you're not going to be loyal to one Realtor, they have no incentive to work for you and in your best interest.  Make sure you select a Realtor that works with buyers.  It won't cost you anything because the seller pays the commission through the listing Realtor.  The listing Realtor works for the seller and has an obligation to get the best price.    realtor.sailor|`|Ti0q1Btiaa	Certain to create complications.

To save them time, look up properties on the local MLS or Realtor.com.  Then only call for showings when you are interested in a house.    A buyers agent that will split the commission has a conflict of interest, even though they are working for you, they receive more money if the selling price on the home is higher.  Try to find a fee only buyers agent realtor.

AA11488813	The account can go to zero, but if it stays at zero for three months with no activity then it will close, unless they set it up so it will never close (that's something you would have to ask the banker about). As far as having any fees as far as the balance goes, it depends on the type of account you have. If you have a Free Checking account (it will say what kind you have on your statement or you can call the phone bank or go into the branch) then there is no minimum balance or monthly service fee. If you have the Customer Management account the minimum DAILY balance is $1,000. And if you have Complete Advantage then the minimum daily balance is $5,000. There are also different ways to waive the monthly service fees ($8/month on Customer Management, $12/month on Complete Advantage) but I would suggest you talk to a banker or the phone bank to find out what you would need for that.

5LJUdnwuaa	Its a sad fact that many owners of homes that go into foreclosure, then don't fetch the lenders price at auction, or don't even draw a bidder, have been struggling with a debt burden for some time. Their remaining cash goes into other priorities than maintaining their home in pristine condition. The stress from months, even years of worry leaves them totally demotivated, and unable to find a way to do even the simplest repairs. Once the property goes to auction, many owners will have chosen foreclosure as a way out.<br>  So it shows on the outside, paintwork patchy, walls dirty, yards full of litter and gardens overgrown. Inside could be scary. <br>  Not all REO is older though, in some metropolitan areas the slower housing market has meant some builders of new midscale and upscale homes have not found buyers. and the banks that issued the construction loans have foreclosed. The first rule of real estate "location, location, location" can apply in the foreclosure market too. If the REO is in a good neighborhood, with higher priced property and good resale values, ignore the superficial scruff , the easy fix damage, and the peeling paint and get an inspection report. You'll find some homes where Its likely that the property value will appreciate immediately you do the little cosmetic work and clean up that's needed, and you'll feel a lot better about the place as well.<br>  I can't tell you about Fort Lauderdale and surrounding areas, but I suggest you have a look at the listing services I put in as a source, and make sure you get an experienced and active realtor who knows the area you prefer..|`|6hHwoBGTaa	You can get really good deals on REO homes, just be sure to take an inspector with you before making an offer.

Follow the prompts and you will find a tremendous selection of stuff..Suggestion; look up a few pieces and take a ride by, if you find something that looks good to you ,then call the appropriate contact and get a tour..It saves the selling agency a lot of work and you won't have to go with the broker to forty homes to find what you want...The asking price is not chiseled in stone. Make an offer that seems right to you and hagle a little..Might get a real good buy. Good luck

DPMsgxHMaa	Depending on the taxes on the property and how they are prorated, depending on whether or not you are going to escrow money with the mortgage company for taxes and how much they will need to make the next tax payment, depending on what day of the month you close (because you will probably be paying per diem interest if your payments are going to be due on the 1st and you close on the 20th - you would have to pay 10 days interest), depending, depending!  Plus there are loan origination costs, appraisal costs, deed recording fees, mortgage recording fees, etc.  It is truly hard to say, but 6-7% would probably be a very good guess.|`|cO20bemQaa	It also depends on your APR we bought our home for 185k and we had a 6.0apr and we only had to dish out 6k for our closing cost.|`|h8hMRGRTaa	It is dependent upon the title company and loan company but i would say nor more than 8k. I am currently purchasing a $140k home and the closing were just under $10k.|`|lamNgSfpaa	one easy way to approximate closing costs is to call a title attorney and just ask them to send you a mock hud-1 on a purchase.  they will ask you things like, what is the purchase price, how much are you financing, are you a first-time homebuyer, etc.  they can work up a settlement statement (hud-1) that will break down all of the costs.  there are a lot of title charges that are variable such as county recordation tax, state transfer tax, county transfer tax, county recording fees, etc.  they can even do the research on the tax information for that property and give you the amount you will likely have to put in your escrow account for taxes (although eventually that will be up to your lender to determine).
AA11606588	First off just bug them until they switch the account.  Once the account is switched go to the 3 credit bureaus and tell them each to research the debt.  They all 3 will and should remove it once they figure out what happened.  Its a pain but it'll get this removed from your credit.<br>  <br>  If they don't switch it then turn it off so it won't hurt your credit any more.  Then you could pay the bill (or just pay like $10 of it) and sue the company for the payment.  This will almost certainly get them moving, but this is real hard core and should not be needed, they are apparently just being lazy - but you could do this if they refused to act.|`|AA10423600	I am not a lawyer.  Deal with it!<br>  <br>  1) If the account is still in your name, call the cell phone company and CANCEL the account.

If this is in collections, you many be able to work with them to get this deleted under a "pay for delete" agreement.<br>  <br>  3) The laws related to posting to your credit report will not help you in this case, as the report is accurate.  The cell phone is in your name, it was delinquent, and it was reported that way.  You can't sue the cell phone company for filing accurate info.  You can't sue the employer because they didn't post this to your account.

Different jobs exist in the Army,Navy ,Air Force and Marines.  Go see a recruiter and take the ASVAB.  Then you can get a better idea of what you could qualify for by testing your mental capacity.

You would have to send in paper copies of your forms. <br>  <br>  The IRS will not allow the same person to be claimed twice. If you say that no one else can claim you, that means you're claiming yourself. The IRS would contact both you and the person that claimed you and ask for verification of who really has the right to claim you. Once that is determined, they will adjust the refund of whoever did it wrong. If someone already got their refund but got too much based on the change, the IRS will make them repay the difference. <br>  <br>  Plus it will cause a big delay for both you and the person who claimed you. You can forget about having a 15 day refund. You'd be lucky if either party sees a refund within 2 months.  <br>  <br>  If its a parent or boyfriend that claimed you, I highly recommend you work it out with them first. First, determine who really should be claiming you, and that is the only person who should claim you. If there is a gray area, and you could justify claiming yourself or you could justify being claimed by someone else, then run the numbers both ways to see what gives the biggest refund, find a fair way to split the difference, and send in the forms so that you are only claimed once. If you decide to make a change with the person that already claimed you, they will need to submit a 1040-X to amend their return.|`|MmTe8W8uaa	If you actually are their dependent, then no, it is not illegal for them to put that on their taxes.<br>  <br>  If you actually are their dependent and put that you are not, that was illegal.  It is not a terribly big deal, because this usually happens by mistake, not on purpose, so it will just cost you money; you are not likely to be arrested.   <br>  <br>  You will be required to repay any portion of your refund that resulted from incorrectly stating that you were not a dependent.  You will be required to pay the correct tax for any year in which you filed incorrectly.<br>  <br>  If you claimed the earned income credit when you were not eligible due to being a dependent, then you will be required to repay the amount received and may be prohibited from claiming the earned income in future years.<br>  <br>  There may also be interest charges and/or financial penalties (fines).|`|BoAEgaAGaa	If you file and you are already claimed as a dependent your return will be rejected if e-filed, if you do not indicate that you are being claimed by someone else.  Then you will have to change your return.  This will only allow you to not pay tax on the first $5450 of income if all from wages reported on a W-2.

Now that he has some money coming back, they will keep applying that money to the old years that he didn't file in which they calculated a tax owed.<br>  <br>  That is why it is always to your advantage to file, because if you don't, they will for you.<br>  <br>  If he still has records from back then, it would be wise to file returns back as far as he can.  By declaring his deductions and credits, he can still help those old years.  You cannot claim a refund for any year over three years ago, but he can still file those older ones to have his tax owed reduced.  This will also reduce the interest and penalties that he has been accumulating all these years.

vVTmJjJDaa	here's what FEMA has to say about it...it describes a lender and an insurer disagreeing on the zone, but the info still applies:<br>  <br>  In some cases, a lender determines that a property is in the Special Flood Hazard Area (SFHA), but the insurer provides a conflicting determination. It is important for the flood zone designation to be accurate in the event of a flood claim and for the purpose of compliance exams conducted by the particular Federal regulatory entity. A regulatory entity may deem the "two flood zone designations" as a violation of the Act. Therefore, FEMA recommends that the two parties talk and discuss the information used by each (perhaps one company is privy to information that the other is not) in an attempt to reach an agreement on the flood zone designation. If the companies are not able to reach an agreement, then the property owner may wish to request that FEMA make a final determination through the Letter of Determination Review (LODR).<br>  <br>  If you are a property owner, within the 45 days following the date your lender notified you that your property is in the SFHA shown on the FIRM for your community, you and your lender may jointly request that FEMA review your lender's determination; FEMA's response to such requests is a LODR. In response to such requests, FEMA reviews the same information your lender used to determine that your structure was located in an SFHA. Unlike with a Letter of Map Amendment or Letter of Map Revision Based on Fill, the elevation of the structure or property relative to the elevation of the 1-percent-annual-chance flood is not considered for a LODR. Just like your lender, FEMA only considers the location of the structure relative to the SFHA boundary shown on the FIRM. FEMA reviews this information and issues its finding of whether the structure is located in the SFHA according to the currently effective FIRM. While this determination cannot consider the elevation of your structure or property, it can be useful if you feel the lender's interpretation of the FIRM is incorrect.|`|Jdj3lInWaa	Unfortunately the flood zones were recently re marked a few years ago after Katrina i think.

SohrsIBoaa	hey! i like seeing kids with such a strong though on what they want to be. espicially this, what you wrote is amazing. I think you would be a great detective. first things first, becoming a police officer nowadays is not as easy as it sounds. ive been trying to get a job as a police officer for years. with all the veterans coming back from iraq with first hand picks at what job they want, the jobs go pretty fast. Second, as soon as your a senior in high school, start looking at the colleges with the best programs for criminal justice. Go to that school and get a degree in criminal justice. A 2 or 4 year degree is up to you. But nothing less then 2 years of school. Thirdly.. since your going to be a police officer maybe you should go to your towns police department and ask them if they allow ride alongs. Where I live, you can ride in the front seat with the police officers for a few hours and see what kind of stuff they really do. You might like that a lot! <br>  <br>  Also, I just want to warn you that what you see in real life gets very scary sometimes. Ive been working as a paramedic for some time now, and you might think your not squeamish, but things are different in real life. I wish the best luck to you, I hope you accomplish all of your goals. Remember to go to college, thats the biggest part of this equation. Good luck dear. <br>  <br>  PS, I dont know if you like tv or not. But we have a show called "The First 48" and its all about homicide detectives. I think you would REALLY like it. Look it up, if you dont have it on tv, then buy it online and then watch it.

VQlXF8Ucaa	I think this question really depends on your age and your health.  You know if you are young and you rarely get sick then maybe paying a higher deductible won't affect you.  I think at one time I had an insurance policy with a high deductible and I didn't care for it, the insurance company in these cases really doesn't cover anything.  You pay premiums and then if you have to use the insurance you have to pay all the deductibles too, so it is like a rip off.<br>  <br>  Try Wellcare.com or Anthem Blue Cross and Blue Shield and also try State Farm Insurance and see if you can't get a decent policy for your money.<br>  <br>  I have Wellcare and I am very happy with them.|`|wWM1tQ8xaa	I am not an expert on this,however I would like suggest you take a look here <a href="http://www.healthinsurance-onlinetips.info/health-insurance-for-free.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.healthinsurance-onlinetips.in...</a> ,there are helpful tips there|`|c55e0f805213ca2ef17b2f09adbe4480aa	I have had a policy for my family for the last couple of years with a $10k deductible.

For us it was a two year gamble on not getting terribly sick or injured.  After that year, every month is gravy.|`|0ar5TU5Jaa	it also depends on if you think you will be using much healthcare or not. If you do, it might be worth it to pay more per month to get the good perks (in other words, if you think you will spend more than your deductible amount in a year on healthcare). <br>  <br>  if you hardly ever need any kind of care then lower payment/higher deductible is good. but still price it out at a couple places to see who has the best options.|`|SogS1WzYaa	consult a couple different insurance agents and get their opinion. then decide for yourself.
PkCTYMbnaa	Do you mean the house is only 5000. the amount is only 10 percent of the selling price up to a max of 8000.<br>  doesnt mean everyone gets the full amount. Also if you purchased from a family member you would not be able to claim it. If you qualify check out the rules on irs.gov website then you would have to amend you taxes.|`|d331dd95c4a1ebbb6ed4bd0996d3a0b6aa	it is not in place yet there are alot of details to work out
4e6295dad90afcd796f24bcf439c0623aa	It is my understanding that you qualify for the credit if you have not owned a home for the past three years. The credit will be 10% of the purchase price, or $8000, whichever is less, which means $500 in your case. You will have to live there for 3 years or owe the credit back to the IRS.<br>  <br>  In order to receive the credit this year, you will have to amend (re-do)your 2008 return. The credit is good for 2009 returns as well, so you could wait and add it to your '09 return. <br>  <br>  Hope this helps!<br>  <br>  DebbieB

Your mom can decline to get one.<br>  You will both have to go to the bank together.<br>  Take your student ID and make sure you know your social security number.<br>  You may need $100 to open the account.<br>  <br>  If your mom refuses this idea, tell her that you don't want to be 18 and thrown out in that cruel world without having experience using a checking account.<br>  /|`|lWqJR7uyaa	well ask your parents to put you as custodian in that account so you have acces to a checking account with your parents (parent) The regular age is 18 no exceptions.

VQlXF8Ucaa	That's funny I was thinking about going back to college myself and taking archaeology.  I would think it would be a good career path for real and you would get to travel all over the world.  Years ago one of my college professors was an archaeologist and they went to Mexico to help with the dig of the city under Mexico City.  I would think it would be a cool and interesting job.

But, of course, it is impossible to tell without doing your tax return.|`|UDxL7lPqaa	"pick myself up at the end of the year"?  What does that mean?|`|BJugETlOaa	It depends on how much your work takes out on your taxes. I worked at a place where they took the bare minimum out and some people had to pay. they were pissed needless to say and I didn't get back much on mine. This is what I do and I am getting about $1000 back I made 24000 this year so that might give you an estimate.|`|YMnTveWuaa	bad choice.|`|G3P5htn7aa	It depends on what credits if any you can take. If your single with no dependents and no credits to take you could very well end up owing taxes rather than receiving a refund. The fact that you made 29,000 and claimed 0 probably means that there wasn't enough federal taxes taken out of your pay checks. If you do end up owing this year (for 2008 tax year) I would recommend going to your employer and changing your w-4 so that more federal tax can be taken out weekly.
0yqQg9CXaa	B - the word subsequent is the giveaway.<br>  /|`|kpD4WBbSaa	B would be correct!

WfwFuQB0aa	it could be a number of reasons, including an allergy or hayfever associated with the season.    for a correct answer contact your doctor for a referral to an ophthalmologist (eye specialist) or see an optometrist all of whom may be able to point you in the right direction.    i used to have watery eyes for a good couple of hours a day but have just realised it has disappeared now.    good luck, it can be really annoying.|`|W05lqxGHaa	wow,,, i think you should probably get glasses or something or maybe it's irritated or something you should consult  the doctor  for that    compare to me i stay for like 12 hours in front of the computer and i feel that my eyes are like so tired but still i dont use glasses..|`|6mcmeAe1aa	Try limiting your time on the computer and see an optometrist.

YQ1Q7XeEaa	If everyone had a really strong understanding of finances a number of things would be different today:    1- the mortgage crunch would not have happened.  People were buying houses that were way too expensive for their income level - they didn't understand the pitfalls of Adjustable rate mortgages or house notes that ate up more than half of their income.    2 - The credit card crunch would not happen.  The better you understand how credit works the less likely you are to get in deep credit card debt.    3 - retirement savings - the simple fact of the matter is that if you save/invest 10% of your income from your first job through your last job will never want during your retirement (as long as you live conservatively that is - but if you have sound money management skills the retiree would already know that.)|`|ee63beadde43c1c4370dcd700471caebaa	If people take on too much debt then it can reduce their ability to purchase products within the community. If they are unable to pay for those products that are purchased then it can also impact the community by raising prices to everyone to offset the cost of writing off bad debt. People should learn about finance and managing their money. It would help to do it as early as possible. Good money management is good for everyone.

l0rKjtUDaa	mine was supposed to be depo'd on 1/30, the WMR now says by 2/3, today, and my bank has nothing pending. Spoke to IRS Rep last night that said no depo date has been scheduled as of yet and the scheduling is done by their "system" and they have no way of knowing when the "system" will schedule.... scarey, huh, that we are depending on a "system".|`|v6E4Ulmtaa	Mine was suppose to be the 10th and I got up this morning and it had changed to the 17th!!!!

zSwAu2zdaa	Sounds like you should have called them before it even got to the point where they are taking you to court. Times are hard for everyone right now, but you could have avoided all of this, sometimes all it takes is a phone call and if that didn't do it you have to follow the chain of command there is always someone higher that is there to help you out, you just have to take the time and look into. Remember the loan and credit card companies are doing just as bad as you they have employees to pay and families to feed to, so when you call just explain your situation to them some people will be understanding and some won't you just have to take the punches because after all you are the one who spent the money and it does have to be paid back one way or the other. Now as far as them garnishing your welfare check they can not do that because it is money giving to you by the state. I could go on and on about how come you have a credit card and are getting welfare but I won't I will leave that to someone else because I don't know your situation so I hope this info helps
QgXN2kB6aa	both|`|YYA1HfHQaa	yes it will do it and i dont want u to do that
YJrrZo9jaa	The deposit takes awhile to post, sometimes the computers only update twice a day, then your bank can take as much time as they please to post it to your account.  Generally, it should be available by close of business today, but if you are on pins and needles, I'd call your bank and find out for sure.|`|CCfMrf8Vaa	It depends on how your bank does things. My bank updates every morning around 5ish. If I don't see it online or hear it on the phone after that, it would be the next day.|`|ThZXnBjAaa	good luck.  my date was feb 3rd  too and then this morning it changed to feb 17th.  %^%^ i'm fricking pissed off, man!  i wonder if people are actually receiving their refunds without these bull $* delays?|`|AA12043502	I was supposed to get mine today too. NOTHING.  I called my bank nothing pending to come in. The Government is sooo screwed up.|`|aT3l7z3eaa	Hello,  I have found that most deposits from IRS are done on Fridays.  So, I would say that you are more likely to see you deposit posted on Feb. 9th.  However, it should me deposited in your account on the2/6.|`|gsw5uCw4aa	Sorry to bust your bubble, but i dont think your going to get it today. i was in the same boat on the 30th. i called my bank all day and nothing; i have since then learned that my check will now be deposited 02/10. it very disappointing to see the date keep getting pushed back, but due to the stimulus checks most of us recieved last year there has been some confusion as to those who didn't recieve the full amount that was owed and this years returns were pulled to verify and if more of owed to you then you will also get that on yuor return this year. I wish you the best of luck|`|0S7JNY5Aaa	My schedule says the IRS will make it's next DD on Feb.6th|`|wqchA8B7aa	Liklihood is small. They usually post in the evening.|`|l0rKjtUDaa	Yep, same thing. WMR still says the 3rd, but my bank has nothing pending. I have called the IRS 5 times and got 5 different answers. Last nights call to IRS Agent  5 told me that mine was still being processed although nothing is wrong with it (i efiled Jan 15) and that I shouldn't go by the WMR because its not right (???) and I need to wait the full 3 weeks before I call again!! the 8-15 days that the tax programs promise is false and we should not believe it. IT TAKES 3 WEEKS!! ( now this is all being told me by  5) Also, the "system" only updates once a week and so it "should" be updated NEXT Monday and that the "system" is what generates a deposit date!!! it is all done by computer. They can not over ride it manually (ok, whatever)...|`|baQpo0kdaa	keep checking it, it could come in at anytime today|`|xNaN3VkJaa	I'd say 70/30 against it.
