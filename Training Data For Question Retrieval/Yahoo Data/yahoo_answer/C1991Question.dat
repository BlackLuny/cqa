20090307120727AA1QqVW	Consumer Electronics;Cell Phones & Plans	MB storage on my verizon bill?	I had 5 charges for megabyte storage on my bill this month. I just got a Music phone, so I thought maybe they charged me for transferring my music on my computer to my phone, but there was one charge on my dad's number and another charge on my mom's number. My mom doesn't know how to do anything on the phone except turn it on and type in a number, and no one texts her. So, this charge can't be related to Get It Now, texting, pictures, music, web, etc. Plus, this is the first time this charge has been on our bill. Also, my brother didn't have one of these charges, so I don't think it has to do with any changes made to our plan. I'd like to know why we have an extra $20 to pay and how to stop doing it. Please and thanks!

20090307115043AA3Be6F	Consumer Electronics;Music & Music Players	Any other mp3 players > ipod touch?	the ipod touch is pretty unique, i mean it has a touchscreen and WI FI, thats why im leaning towards it :) ...if it had a camera that would be like the best mp3 ever. and maybe a radio?-.-      now the thing is i was wondering if any other mp3 players are better ....like they are WI FI capable , maybe a camera ( i doubt it ) and if it's cheaper.      i want a mp3 player that is WI FI capable,i just want to browse the internet on the mp3 ;] , so thats a major reason i'm leaning towards the ipod touch , though it is quite expensive. i do like the fact that the samsung has bluetooth and the calling ability though, if it had WI FI , it'd probably be really good!      does zune let you browse the internet? with WI FI?

20090227085002AAVkg8j	Consumer Electronics;Games & Gear;Xbox	How to reconnect your Xbox to Live after a modem has been changed?	Ok, so I was on a computer in my house and went to stick in a flash drive, well when I did the virus detector came up and said it contained a virus. So I read the window and then at the bottom it had options to Halt Internet Traffic, or close. I clicked Halt Internet Traffic. So a message came up to ask if i was sure and i said yes, and it halted, and said I can restart traffic by doing..and i clicked ok before i finished reading.      So anyways my dad couldn't get on the internet so he called and eventually got it working. But now the Xbox will not connect to Live. Neither will my PSP. I scanned for modems, and the same modem we have was on there, only it was under a different name, so I saved it and everything, but it wouldn't connect. It found the modem and everything, but it couldn't obtain an IP Address.      I can figure out the PSP stuff later, but my question for now is, how do I get the Live back working, without the same problem with the PSP happening, because I think it will probably say something about the IP address.      How do I troubleshoot this and get connected back to live?

It kept my itunes, but erased my library and went back to defaults.  If I were to plug in my ipod would it upload the blank library and essentially erase everything on my ipod? Or would the songs from my ipod upload themselves on the itunes? If the case is that it would upload the blank library and erase the songs on my ipod then is there a way to rerverse it or fix it??
20090307125413AAei6lW	Consumer Electronics;TVs	Need Help Deciding on an LCD TV between Sony and LG  Models: 47LG50 vs  KDL-46V4100?	Well, I purchased the 42LG50 and I like it but am thinking about going slightly larger.  I am torn between two sets now.  One in the Sony KDL-46V4100 which I am posting the specs to below and the other is the larger version of the 42LG50 which is the 47LG50 which I'll also post the specs to below.      Sony KDL-46V4100       http://www.google.com/products/catalog?q...       LG 47LG50       http://www.google.com/products/catalog?q...       Now I have my biases on both sets and have done a decent amount of research but would like your opinions and some reasoning behind why you would choose the set you would.  If I go tonight the Sony is on sale at $1299 and if I go tomorrow the LG goes on sale for the same price but the Sony will no longer be on sale.  Let me know what you think!  Thanks in advance!!!

20090307162451AASBcZT	Consumer Electronics;Cameras	Good Digital Camera? (brands, etc.)?	My birthday's coming up and I would really like a digital camera. I'm not really into photography or anything. I would just like to take pictures of events and my family/friends && of course, self-portraits for MySpace, lol. I would love for the camera to have many different settings && different, I guess 'options' on how to shoot. But, again, I'm not trying to get a professional pic, just a nice one. Since I only want one for casual pics (and maybe some of 'nature'), I don't want to ask for one that's over $150. Any suggestions on which digital camera to buy? Much appreciated;   -GiGi   =]]

So I got an ipod nano fourth generation a couple days ago and it works well except that my itunes can't identify it (but i can still add music to it by clicking and dragging). there also isn't a feature where I can choose albums or shuffle the music. The battery also doesn't last long.

Could my 4th generation be fake?
