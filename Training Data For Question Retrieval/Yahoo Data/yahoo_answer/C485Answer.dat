AA11741556	Diet and exercise will make your thighs thinner but it won't necessarily get rid off the cellulite. You need to do dry skin brushing ever day.    Dry skin brushing encourages the  excess fluid to drain from the areas prone to cellulite.    All you need is a brush with hard and scratchy bristles. Five minutes of dry skin brushing a day can improve digestion, aid metabolism, impart new levels of energy and dissipate cellulite.|`|c058cd8101e9c9ead9b0fc9b72f8e99caa	Cellulite is caused by two things, 1) Fatty tissue and 2) Connective tissue.     The first can be taken care of primarily by diet and working out. Drink your fair share of water, don't eat too much and work out to maintain your metabolism. The second is more problematic and gets worse as you age because collagen is not regenerated so the tissue becomes less elastic and of course most people gain weight as they age because of a less active life style and a drop in metabolism.     There are treatments out there that are supposed to be able to help with both the fatty tissue and the connective tissue. The treatments reduce the fat and provide elasticity to the connective tissue. Some of their names include Mesotherapy, Velasmooth and Endermologie.|`|981e68d2b01bbddc683260b279ab87d4aa	Well I have the same problem,but I couldn't resolve it...Maby you should run a lot.I am too lazy for that,but I think that would help.|`|43404b8bf5043e2894fac10ffee7ef39aa	Hey!  the only thing that will get rid of the cellulite is exercise, 2 major exercise for that, they are call in and outer thighs, you can consult a trainer on the gym that you go to (if you do) on how to do it and how to use the machines.

A step by step report that reveals just how simple it can be to tone and tighten your fatty thighs.        How many times have you said to yourself  Ahhhh I hate having to wear bigger pants then I should. I wish I could wear normal pants. I even wish I could wear shorts without feeling embarrassed of ALL THAT EXTRA Jell-O thats hanging around my thighs.    Almost every week of the year I am asked over and over again  How can I tone and rid my legs and thighs of fat?  It has gotten to the point where I need to carry a mp3 player with me to share the answer. I know that losing weight and toning your legs are HUGE goals. In fact, I know that if you accomplish these goals you will feel 1000% better than you do this very moment.    As with weight loss in general, the process that  I use to tone and tighten your thighs is very simple, but it is not always very easy. It is going to take a lot of commitment on your part to get the job done right, safe, and efficiently.    There are many methods to achieving a lean, sexy and fit body; but there are only a few principles. I tend to mix and match methods and principles. I feel that this will give you the best overall chance to winning the battle of getting those jeans to fit again. You know the ones that fit last year, but now you have to squeeze every muscle in your body just to get them to button and zip up.    Step 1    Can the Cardio    Stop trying to disprove the our treadmills are built to last ad. You dont have to run for hours on end, day in day out to see results. In fact if you keep this up you will not only get hurt and not see results but you will come to the reality that the treadmill is actually built to last.    Instead of running for hours a day. You only need to run for a few hours a month. I am a HUGE fan of high intensity intervals. A few ways that you can time your intervals would be run as fast as you can for 1 minute followed by a 2 minute walk/jog. Run as fast as you can for 30 seconds followed by a 45 second-1 minute walk/jog. Run 15 seconds walk/jog 30 seconds. Again as I said earlier, there are many ways to time your intervals. The key is to make sure that your run portion is done at full speed and your slower portion is done atwell a slower speed. The slower speed time is great for preparing yourself  mentally and physically for the next run fast period and catching your breath. Your goal is to be able to accomplish 30 minutes of these high intensity intervals.    Step 2     Lunge your way to lean legs and then squat down to sit.    Did you know that if you do 3 sets of lunges and 3 sets of squats only 3 days a week you can easily trim 3 inches of fat off of your legs in only 3-6 weeks. As long as you are eating the right foods, accomplishing this 3 inch loss from your legs should no breeze. Make sure to alternate lower body/ upper body exercises. In other words, if you want to get results without getting hurt, you better do a upper body dominant exercise after doing your squats and before doing your lunges. Or you can do lunges, upper body exercise, squats.    Step 3   Flat abs do not come from crunches, they come from cooks.    It is vital to note, that if you want a toned and flat looking midsection it is crucial for you to not only eat right but also do the right abdominal exercises at the right time. How many times have you seen women constantly doing crunches in the gym, but never see them satisfied. I mean logically if they do a few hundred crunches a day they should have to problem building a tone and sexy physique, right?     If it were so easy I think everyone would have the body of their dreams. The truth is that the most that the crunch squad at the gym will do is build a weak and imbalanced core that will eventually lead to poor posture, herniated disks and still a flabby stomach.    My point in sharing this with you is to teach you that what you have read in all the magazines about doing hundreds of crunches is all lies. There are tons of other fantastic abdominal exercises that will get you much better results, much faster, and much safer.     In addition to doing these other great abdominal exercises you must eat the right foods. This is especially the case for those who only have a few pounds of fat to lose. For those who need to lose more then 30 pounds can get away with not eating entirely perfect. However there will come a time where you will have to eat entirely right in order to continue seeing results..

Salmonella is inoculated onto the meat during culling and butchering process (it is a tough bug to kill). when left in temperatures over 5 degrees Celsius the level of salmonella will double every hour, so if there was one bacterium (and there is never just one) on the chicken when left out, the number after two days would be over 100 million, more than enough to give a bad case of food poisoning.

I, personally, don't use hand sanitizer, because it takes forever to dry, and you end up wiping it on your jeans and it makes a huge dark mark on the side of your jeans.

I recommend that people eat right and exercise. However, if they would like a little "help", I suggest using natural Hoodia (it's important to note that not all Hoodia works well, even if the bottle says "pure" or "standard").    The Hoodia sold at http://tinyurl.com/y389on is in my opinion the best Hoodia on the market. It's pure, has no side effects, and they give you a free 15 day sample (there is a $7.99 shipping and handling charge, but they also give you free recipe and diet guides).  Fantastic results have been seen with this particular Hoodia.

Take at least 1200mg of calcium and 1,000mg vitamin C to help you in case you get sick.  You should also be taking a higher dose of all the vitamins and minerals that are in the multivitamins because the RDA is not high enough to be helpful.    Are you sleeping properly?  What caused you to take such a drastic step?  These are issues that need to be addressed or you will only get worse.  The best thing is to go see a doctor, because if you are young and trying this diet, you may do more harm than losing a little bit of weight.    The safest method is to wean yourself slowly off of meat and compensate with the appropriate corresponding dark green leafy vegetables and all the colors of the rainbow in fruits and vegetables.  Eat fish.  Its very good for you.  Get protein in nuts and soy, which if you aren't eating enough will cause you to be more than tired.  Then ask yourself if losing 8 lbs is equal to how you feel now?   If you are having doubts, stop!!

Last-Longer is the only product that allows "YOU" to control when you ejaculate.  Last Longer is  *Non-hormonal herbal therapy.  *Acts locally on the sex organs.  *Regulates process of ejaculation.  *Acts through neuro-endocrine pathway.  *Acts on the high centers of emotion in the brain.    Sexual arousal is a four-phase process. In the Excitement Phase, breathing deepens and erection begins. In the Plateau Stage, erection becomes full and you feel highly aroused. When arousal builds to a certain point, the next phase occurs, Orgasm with Ejaculation. Then during the Resolution Phase, breathing returns to normal and erection subsides. The key to ejaculatory control is to extend the Plateau Phase, to maintain arousal without triggering Orgasm and Ejaculation.    To learn ejaculatory control:    * Don't use drugs or alcohol. They're distracting and they interfere with the self-awareness crucial to learning ejaculatory control.  * Appreciate whole-body sensuality. Men often think sex happens only in the penis and only during intercourse. That view is a one-way ticket to uncontrolled ejaculation (not to mention erection problems, and women with those proverbial headaches). The best sex involves head-to-toe arousal. Men learning how to approach -- but not arrive at -- their point of no return, need to appreciate whole-body sensuality, the pleasure potential in every square inch of the body. Whole-body sensuality releases tension. Tense bodies that have no other outlet often find release through involuntary ejaculation. But as you learn to appreciate sensual pleasure from head to toe, whole-body arousal takes the pressure off your penis, and you last longer.  * Whole-body sensuality means relaxation, but the "relaxation" involved in great sex is not the kind that includes an easy chair, a six pack, and Monday Night Football. It's the kind you feel after a hot bath or a good massage. In fact, bathing or showering together before lovemaking can help men relax and appreciate whole-body sensuality -- and last longer.  * Breathe deeply. One very easy way to stay relaxed while making love is to breathe deeply. The body has a natural tendency to breathe deeply during sex. But many men fight it. They think they should stay in control by not breathing deeply and making the little love-moan sounds that go along with it. But when men work to control their breathing, they often sacrifice ejaculatory control. Try breathing deeply. Let your breath go. Many men are amazed how much this one little change improves their ejaculatory control.  * Start with masturbation with a dry hand. By varying how you caress your penis, you can learn to stay highly aroused for quite a while without coming. When you feel yourself approaching your point of no return, simply back off a bit, strokestroke yourself more gently or not at all, and stay aroused without ejaculating. Then as you feel yourself getting a little distance from your point of no return, return to more vigorous self-stimulation. Repeat this several times over several sessions. Approach your point of no return, then back off. For most men, it doesn't take long to develop good ejaculatory control while alone.  Then move on to masturbation with a lubricated hand. Use saliva, vegetable oil, or a commercial sexual lubricant. For most people, lubricants increase the sensual intensity of erotic fondling. Follow the same program: Masturbate until you approach your point of no return, then back off. Repeat this several times over several sessions.  * Once you have good control during masturbation, and appreciate whole-body sensuality, and feel comfortable breathing deeply during lovemaking, then you're ready for the couples program -- if you're in a couple. The couple approach is called the "Stop-Start Technique." First, arrange "stop" and "start" signals with your lover, for example, a light pinch or tap, or a tug on an ear.  Then, your lover strokes your penis by hand as you lie still. When you approach your point of no return, give the "stop" signal. Your lover immediately stops stroking you and simply holds your penis gently, as you continue to breathe deeply and pays close attention to the sensations you're feeling. When you no longer feels close to ejaculation, gives the "start" signal, and your lover begins stroking you again. How many stops and starts should you do? A half-dozen over a 15-minute period works well for most couples. Do what feels comfortable for you.    With stop-start, the focus is on the man. He's the one learning the new skill. But don't forget the woman's sensual needs. As part of each practice session, she might guide your hand over her to show you what she likes.    Once you've gained good ejaculatory control with your lover's hand, try the same stop-start procedure with oral caresses. Again, you begin by lying still.    Once you've gained good control orally, feel free to start moving. You're making love again -- but now you have ejaculatory control. Congratulations.

Since water doesn't make you fat and it flushes out your body, you will feel good about dieting, it is healthier than most other diets, and it is very effective!!! just dont watch the scales... water weighs more than fat!! when you need to shed the pounds (for a weigh in or something, just drink less water the few days before)    Also... when you buy groceries, resist from buying any junk food (candy, chips, pastries, ice cream, etc) if you dont have the fatty foods in your cupboards, then you wont consume as many calories and carbs, etc that are bad for you and add on the weight.     and when you crave something sweet, just take your mind off of it by busying yourself with an activity. go clean your kitchen or walk the dog or wash your car. you will feel much better afterwards, than if you give in and eat. after you conquer the cravings, they will happen less often and you will lose weight like crazy. just know when to stop!!    i hope you fing this helpful and good luck!!! you can do it!!|`|7c1ac1a8c3159fb0c16b79eaf7ddc997aa	impossible is nothing.....|`|9da91783b25cf759ac3e780d454bf9f5aa	Many people ask me how they can slim down.  I recommend that people eat right and exercise. However, if they would like a little "help", I suggest using natural Hoodia (it's important to note that not all Hoodia works well, even if the bottle says "pure" or "standard").    The Hoodia sold at http://tinyurl.com/y389on is in my opinion the best Hoodia on the market. It's pure, has no side effects, and they give you a free 15 day sample (there is a $7.99 shipping and handling charge, but they also give you free recipe and diet guides).  Fantastic results have been seen with this particular Hoodia.|`|4aa431bb9795d7fdb317a242eeb1b568aa	http://choosediet.blogspot.com/|`|84eecd1a05ce02d2c2c9fb77423f6e95aa	Weight Watchers points system works.

Examples of this include Tendonitis, Bursitis and Carpal tunnel syndrome. I would suspect it to be something similar. My orthopedic surgeon told me that one of the best medicines he could recommend to me for joint pain,was not a medicine at all! He told me to get a glucosamine-chondroiten supplement from a vitamin store and use it for at least 3 weeks and I would see results. I was really skeptical but, I used it and  three weeks later my pain was gone. Try that route, maybe it will help you as much as it did me! Good luck
185bVJDCaa	Sleeping - How is it you are not sleeping well?  There are many ways that a person can not sleep well including not sleeping enough, waking up lots, having a hard time getting to sleep, waking up early ... you need to be more specific in order to get more assistance on this question.  I have provided a link on various sleeping troubles that includes possible treatments (including non-drug treatments.)    Fear or Phobia is a difficult one.  If you are not sure of what you are afraid of but have an overwhelming feeling of dread, you might benefit from seeing a counsellor or a psychiatrist.  Your first line of attack would probably be to see your physician.  There he/she can try to figure out if there is something physical going on before sending you on to the counsellor or psychiatrist.  I suspect that if you are not sleeping well this can make this fear feel worse.  For me, because I have had difficulties sleeping, on a very bad day - a lack of sleep can kick my anxiety and panic into high gear.  It is quite probable that you will be unable to separate out the two issues and must deal with both at the same time.    Good luck.|`|AA10400770	Sounds like a panic attack. Tell your doctor and get some meds. Alot of people have them but never get treated. They can get much worse so go in now.|`|3OtK7VyPaa	Go see a Psychiatrist.

5f2cc90e2362c3a06e7e174515cfffe1aa	Hello      For openers YES you should tell you doctor. I,m on meds myself and I only take them as prescribed. What you done is Basically an overdose of meds. You should never play around with meds this is a serious subject. As far as your stomach goes it is in pain cause it had a extremely high dosage of meds. If your lucky you didnt do any damage to it. But I would have it checked out just to be on the safe side.|`|61380560f287444cf3d858b7e555eb30aa	you didn't say what pills you took 3 of~was it the cipralex? i'm assuming that that is what you meant. i don't understand why you would take more of those for a headache, they aren't headache pills~they are anti depressants. read on...  "The overdose data for Cipralex is yet limited but symptoms are anticipated to be similar to those of citalopram, demonstrating a wide margin of safety.  A confirmed 190 mg overdose of Cipralex has occurred without any symptoms being reported. Furthermore, no symptoms were reported after intake of Cipralex 600 mg. (dose not confirmed). Two cases of at least 1200 mg overdose have been reported; both patients recovered, one had ECG (electrocardiagram) changes, the other had no symptoms. (data on file).  There is no specific antidote. Treatment is symptomatic and supportive. Gastric lavage (having your stomach pumped) should be carried out as soon as possible after oral ingestion. Monitoring of cardiac and vital sign is recommended, along with general symptomatic supportive measures."  from what i could find i think you will be ok. BUT you should not ever take pills like that in any way other than the way that your dr. prescribed them to you.   the pain in your stomach is probably coincidental and unrelated to the pills you took. but if it gets too bad, go to the emergency room. it could even be caused by anxiety from worrying about the pills you took.  yes you should tell your dr.~and tell him about the headache too~maybe he can give you something for that. please be careful with your meds... and ALWAYS be honest with your health care provider|`|4cd2c7649e1949de04b5f7bdd1c51814aa	You need to consult with your doctor & tell him what's going on.

Why in the world would you take your anti-depressants for a headache? Call you doctor. You know thats gonna mess you up don't you? Why do you think that when you begin taking such medications, you work your self up to the correct dosage slowly...and when you come off of them, you slowly wean yourself off? It's because it messes with the chemicals in your brain. You will probably feel pretty funky until things work themselves back out. Next time...take some tylenol or something....|`|WD4kg8DIaa	this is dangerous I used to want to take pills to take the pain away but it doesn't help.  You need to get a therapists and fell better.

61380560f287444cf3d858b7e555eb30aa	The first association of the common abnormalities common to CES was established over 100 years ago (1898) by Haab, and first described in association with a small marker chromosome in 1965 by Schachenmann. A first report of a familial tisomy 22 pter-->q11happened in 1972 by Buhler et al. Early reports of Cat Eye Syndrome discuss the possibility of chromosome 13 involvement. Now, CES is considered to be present with the chromosome 22 trisomy findings.  22q11.2 is a very unstable region of chromosome 22, which is involved in other syndromes, such as 22q11 deletion ( a microdeletion of that area of the chromosome) and supernumerary der(22) syndrome, also known as trisomy 22 or partial trisomy 11/22.    pictures can be found at     http://www.chromosome22central.com    http://www.health.allrefer.com/health/co...     http://www.nt.net/~a815/cateye.htm

I would strongly suggest talking with a doctor; your isolation, your tendency to sleep for extended periods of time, and your daydreaming are all "escapist" behaviors that point to a bigger problem.  You might also consider counseling; a good psychologist can be enormously helpful in dealing with depression and its underlying causes.      Most colleges and universities have student counseling services that you can use for little or no cost; calling them for an appointment, and KEEPING the appointment, might be an easy first step to take.

44bd96b84b3345b272ba2c66ab244575aa	Emotional abuse is the most common form of abuse - and yet least talked about. Part of the reason it is so easy for people to overlook is that so that much of what is considered normal and acceptable forms of communication is in fact abusive. Many people don't know that they have been - or are being - emotionally abused. In addition, a lot of emotional abuse doesn't appear to be severe or dramatic, although its effects can be.     Unlike physical or sexual abuse, where a single incident constitutes abuse, emotional abuse is made up of a series of incidents, or a pattern of behavior that occurs over time. Emotional abuse is more than just verbal insults, the most common definition of emotional abuse. Emotional abuse is a series of repeated incidents - whether intentional or not - that insults, threatens, isolates, degrades, humiliates, and/or controls another person.     It may include a pattern of one or more of the following abuses: insults, criticisms, aggressive demands or expectations, threats, rejection, neglect, blame, emotional manipulation and control, isolation, punishment, terrorizing, ignoring, or teasing.     Harassment, physical and sexual abuse, and witnessing abuse of others are also forms of emotional abuse.     Emotional abuse can take place anywhere: at home, at school, in relationships, and in the workplace. Contrary to popular beliefs that bullies are only found in the school yard, many bullies also exist in the workplace.|`|AA10396112	Emotional abuse is when your called names repeatedly by the same person, or neglect (meaning they just ignore you). Those are the two varing extremes. I know emotional abuse, but I think I find both hard to bear. When my family (not naming) ignores me, I feel like they don't care, and that they wish I were dead. With the other (which I'm not naming) sometimes I start to believe what they're telling me, like I'm stupid and careless and everything is my fault.|`|d1efbb4481d4af1d8c650f6703a772acaa	Ultimate form of Torture...Physical torture has a limit because you eventually die....EMOTIONAL TORTURE goes on and on and on...I think you get the picture.|`|AA10464598	Emotional abuse IS alot of things:    GUILT TRIPS  "IF YOU LOVE ME" you will do or do not do, this or that.

5653fc9f39ebe3768412dffbf3280936aa	You need to go to the doctor pretty quickly, or the ER to rule out the possibility of any pneumonia or other infections.  Your symptoms could be many things, but if you don't go get it all checked out again you run the risk of not being around for your kid.
An8XBEdLaa	Wow you are asking a lot.    Lets start with you have been healthy up to now.  Congratulations.  Be glad for that.    Pneumonia is can be a long recovery.  If you had it bad enough to go to the hospital you had it BAD.  Pneumonia is inflammation of the lung. This is most commonly due to an infection. Antibiotics will help a bacterial infection, but will not help a viral infection. Over time your body's natural defenses will clear a viral infection.  It may take a month or two after finishing the course of antibiotics, until you feel completely back to normal. It is possible for inflammation or irritation to remain in the lungs for 6 to 8 weeks after the actual infection is gone. Your discomfort, cough and shortness of breath may linger. However this should gradually improve and eventually go away completely.    My guess is that your antibiotic was Levaquin (or levofloxacin).  Known side affects are   Feelings of restlessness, headaches, drowsiness, dizziness, sleep problem (insomnia), nauase/vomiting, diarrhea and stomach pain, which are some of the symptoms that you described.      You have a lot on your plate.  Single mom, working, going to school.  Somethings gotta give somewhere.  Maybe you can find someone to help with the kid(s) for a weekend so that you can get some quality rest.  Follow up with the doctor maybe you could benefit from nebulizer therapy.  Good luck.  Feel better soon.

People with skin asthma have very dry skin. During attacks, the dry skin becomes even thicker and drier, sometimes even visibly cracked. These little cracks in the skin are avenues for entry of germs that infect the skin causing more problems. Aside from the dryness, skin asthmatics also have very itchy skin. So they tend to scratch a lot. The scratching causes the darkening and thickening of the skin, especially in areas behind the knee and in the crease of the arm. Scratching can also cause more cracks and breaks in the skin, again providing an entry point for bacteria and fungi at this point a dermatologist is consulted who usually gives the patient antibiotics, anti-itch medications, and various creams and lotions to apply. But as I said, the attacks come and go. So the important thing to do is to prevent or at least minimize these attacks. so id follow these guide lines   1.Moisturize (The best moisturizer is petroleum jelly) im serious..lol it really is in skin asthma.also:(Aquaphor,Cetaphil cream)    2.Use "mild" products (The trick is to use "baby" products)    3."hypoallergenic diet" (certain foods can  trigger the attacks, but not in all cases.(chicken, eggs, peanuts and chocolate are the main foods that can trigger attacks)|`|020c8b995f845d51e6a78d1ec529d405aa	Let me get this straight......The doc gave you a diagnosis for your rash but didn't tell you what to do about it and you left the office without so much as aksing him what to do for it???????

LxPepgfjaa	Well at one time exteneded family and family took care of the elderly.  Yes there are times when nursing care is needed but unfortunately these days private nurses costs to much for the average family. Take out long term care insurance before you need it..Save your money in a good retirement account. Eat and exercise so you don't have illness mostly associated with old age.  Certain socio-economic groups will be at a disadvantage.  If our government did not waste our tax dollars they could help more.
Z6hQISi7aa	First of all do you have health insurance, if yes call your provider and they will give you a list of doctors in your area. If you don't, look in the yellow pages on line under hospitals, the larger hospitals are best and they can put you in touch with a primary care consultant.
bac0c08d67448ca69e882615d8e3b333aa	Well you can eat what you want as long as you're willing to burn the calories.  You need to add cardio vascular to your work to burn calories, and you can do it with just walking, you don't have to run.  Just walk 30 minutes a day on a treadmill at a pretty good pace.  That gut will start to cause problems if you don't get rid of it, back pain and neck pain, for example.  You can add situps and/or crunches to increase the benefits.  But you have to burn calories.|`|ysBTdavqaa	cut your fat grams back to less than 50/day.  eat more protein in their place and your muscles will stay big.

AA11947253	Symptoms of yeast infection include itching, burning, redness, and irritation of the vaginal area. Severe yeast infections may cause swelling of the vulva and in some cases women experience painful and/or frequent urination which is caused by inflammation of the urinary opening.     Excessive vaginal discharge which is thicker than normal, appears whiter and curd-like (almost like cottage cheese) will be apparent in women experiencing vaginal yeast infections.     Sexual intercourse may be painful due to the inflammation and dryness of the vaginal discharge.         Here's How to prevent yeast infections:  Always wear white cotton panties. Nylon and Lycra may trap air and create a breeding ground for yeast. Never wear panty hose alone -- always wear cotton panties underneath.  Never use petroleum-based lubricants for vaginal lubrication during sexual intercourse. Always use water-based lubricants when vaginal dryness is an issue.  Always wipe from front to back after a bowel movement to prevent the yeast which normally inhabits the intestinal tract from being transferred to the vaginal area.  Eating one cup of yogurt a day helps some women prevent the yeast infections that often follow antibiotic treatment; however, eating yogurt will not cure a yeast infection.  Don't use perfumed bath products or powders in the vaginal area, these can cause irritations which can lead to infection.  Don't use douches! Douches wash away the natural protective mucous of the vagina leaving the vagina more susceptible to yeast and other vaginal infections.  Tips:  Before you get a yeast infection decide if you prefer prescription or over-the counter (OTC) treatment.  At the first sign of yeast infection call your physician for prescribed medication, or go to your pharmacy to buy one of the FDA approved products that are available OTC.  Never self-treat a yeast infection unless you have previously been diagnosed for a yeast infection by a healthcare professional.  Always call a healthcare professional for diagnosis if you are not sure a subsequent infection is yeast. Other vaginal infections or STDs may have similar symptoms.|`|AA12261175	I got voted best answer on this a million years ago, so I'm just pasting it in.  An added note, you can possibly prevent them by keeping the area dry- taking off wet swimsuits, workout wear, underwear after sex, etc.  Another added note:  you need to get a better relationship goin with ole mom.  ::::  The only sure sign is that itch that you never have felt before> It's an "Oh, so THIS is a yeast infection!" itch. You feel like you want to get down and scoot across the carpet. That's a yeastie!  You can get monistat1 which works in one day, but if you have a tenacious one, it may take more than one dose. Same goes with the Diflucan- it generally works unless you've got a bad one. Seems like once you get a yeastie, they seem to want to come back every now and then.  Get an Rx for Diflucan with every antibiotic just in case=one trip to the pharmacy. This is sometimes difficult to remember to request (demand) since if you're getting an antibiotic you're sick w/something else and not thinking yeast infection.  Sometimes you can feel a yeastie coming on and head it off with tampons soaked in plain yogurt. This is not as gross as it sounds and they are actually soothing b/c they are cold. It's also good if you eat yogurt a few times a week as a general practice. I've found that it really does help.  Lastly, you should keep some cream (monitstat or whatever) on hand in case you get one and can't make it to the store before getting a fork out of the utensil drawer. It works to kill the external itch.  (I have never had discharge, but a severe severe severe itch is a dead giveaway.)|`|DAcNScYTaa	red, itchy, cooch smells like beer|`|f0436fa63274ed10a4b8bbad112bd7e8aa	the crud-- discharge, curd looking.

AA11387527	The only real effective diet that is actually proven to work on everyone and allows you to keep the weight off is eating 5-6 small meals/snacks per day limiting calories/fat, drinking water, and staying active.

cb313dfdac75a9816563ce643f7bd1a8aa	The first step is to wash your face twice a day, do not scrub. That makes it worse. For mild acne, try tree tea oil. If it doesn't get better, you should go see a dermatologist and they could give you perscription for something that would help. Also, do not touch your acne. You can get bacteria onto your face which could clog your pores causing more breakouts|`|bfiCJlWjaa	Mary kay cosmetics has acne treatment gel I swear by this stuff it clears up the pimples in 2 days and they have a whole line geared toward acne prone skin...go to mary kay .com to find a consultant near you|`|nCvxNUwWaa	You need to wash your face twice a day.  Do not use ANY scrubs with grit if you have any open or scabbed places on your face.  The grit will get into the sore area and infect it further or pull an healing area open.  After washing your face for the evening, take a hot washcloth and place on your face with you have pimples.  The heat will help bring down the swelling and help draw the infection out.  I am a strong supporter of Mary Kay Cosmetic's but if you don't/won't use them I suggest you get some witch hazel and use after washing.  Do NOT use pure alcohol as this will dry the skin out and make it very dry further aggravating the problem.  You Need a good oil free moisturizer and to keep your hair and hands away from your face.  Many people constantly touch their face (unknowingly) and transfer dirt onto the skin.  Good Luck.  If you want a Mary Kay consultant in your area just go to www.marykay.com and put in your location and it will give you the name of a local consultant.  Remember their facials are free and a great source of information.  Their acne treatment gel is very good also.  But cleanliness is the basis for clearing your skin.|`|AA11412921	if your face is excessively oilly, dont wash more than once a day. try just at night and then adding a thin layer of an acne cream. also maybe try a different cleanser, the one your using might be actually irritating your skin

Ectomorph - Thin, linear appearance, narrow everything.  2. Endomorph - Big, round bones, naturally high degree of body fat.  3. Mesomorph - Broad shoulders, narrow waist, looks naturally muscular.    You need to also understand that no one is completely ONE body type.     If you want nice, cut muscles, you need to do heavy weights with low reps. And always remember to stretch or your mucles will be inflexible and prone to injury. You are probably a Mesomorph or Ectomorph, judging from your stats. So building up shouldn't be a problem.    Personally, I do abs almost everyday just to maintain my 6 pec. If you keep up your routine for the next 5 months, likely you will see a difference. No worries! :)

And the list goes on and on. you treat more than physical pain. emotional pain also. health care is more than money and more than just "helping people". you can possible change lives every day and you are constantly learning and what you learn effects your life outside the hosp. you have to go in w/ an open mind and willingness to learn and except all types of people. you have to lose all judgemental attitudes and just do your job. and if you do go into nursing dont listen when they say you cant be emotional. things you see will hurt you and when you can cry w/ the family they know you really care. its called compassion... good luck... we need so many more great nurses....|`|f005983d8c4908c03021a87774d6b3f5aa	Enjoying helping people is a great start.

14ad394512d542c10b924db2e8b09cb7aa	It's caused from a burst of hormones that come with puberty. Puberty happens to all of us and is not evil, but you are very wise in noticing that it is wrong to surrender our will to an urge like that.  We become stronger by learning to control it, just like our muscles become stronger when we learn to use them to control weight.    First thing you need to do is be kind to yourself. Don't think you are awful if you fall - you are human. Get back up and try again. Keep trying and you will get stronger. When your body reaches adulthood, you will find one to share your life with, and can use your sexual powers with her.     A hint in the meantime is to exercise as an outlet for your body to use that energy. If you don't masturbate, you will have wet dreams, which is fine. Remember you will most likely mess up in your resolve to not do that anymore - but keep trying to keep yourself clean. It will pay off someday.|`|AA10898088	Don't worry. It's not wrong to masterbate.

OspiwVTJaa	The best way to ensure that your PA heals properly is to dip it in hydrogen peroxide to clean it after every urination, or at least 3 times a day. Just get some H.P. and some paper cups and leave them in your bathroom. After going just poor some into a cup and soak it in there for a minute. Turn the ring and make sure it's clean and movable again. Not only will this heal it really well, but it also has the benefit of feeling really good and clean feeling. It is soothing and doesn't burn and it also helps to keep it somewhat moisturized.  Alcohol will dry the area really badly and make healing more painful and irritate the skin so much it will take longer to heal.     Give it a try. It's very comfortable.    Edit:  Salt in a wound? GREAT IDEA why not just pour lemon juice on it to and call it a day!    The reason i recommended Hydrogen peroxide after urinating is not because of the urine having infections, but because urine contains salt and salt burns. Hydrogen Peroxide will clean that off to yet keep it sanitized.     I have a 2 gauge PA that I've had for years. Hydrogen Peroxide works miracles during the healing process which can take weeks sometimes.    Edit  2:     Peroxide is not just a topical solution. The label clearly says it can be used in the mouth and as a gargle. That's proof it isn't topical.|`|AA11477619	Man if that's all you've developed, don't worry.  I've heard of excruciating pain and discomfort for weeks.|`|b5bc3ea98fdabce26089c0fb3ff14409aa	You may be developing a keloid.  Just keep doing warm sea salt water soaks often and this will help everything heal faster.  DO NOT EVER USE Hydrogen Peroxide, bar soap, alcohol, etc.  Also, there is no need to clean after urinating as your urine already sterilized the area.  If you think you are getting an infection (red and swollen), head back to the piercer's and get some soap for it (called Satin or something like that).    What is this red bump?   A small ridge or bump of scar tissue looking a bit like a pimple or small infection is probably a keloid. Whatever you do, do not pick at them as this can make them bigger. There are a few things you can try to reduce them (what works is different for everybody): put vitamin E or aspirin on them; see a dermatologist for recommended medical techniques; reduce the jewelry gauge (although this is not always an option). Generally, a keloid appears because of irritation, so your goal is to remove the irritation. Catching keloids early is important in stopping them.     Good luck!|`|c7d36f526232c7fa150272cc09fc7e9eaa	The whiote ring sounds like a bit of scar tissue, nothing much to worry about, its quite common with genital piercings. It may also be caused by the type of jewelry you're wearing. Different bodies react to different jewelry. A ring or curved barbell are usually the best.    As stated before, DO NOT use alcohol or peroxide. It says right on the label that they are TOPICAL antiseptics. They are meant to clean skin BEFORE an incision is made. 1/4 teaspoon of NON iodized sea salt in 8 ounces of warm water for 10 minutes, twice a day is all you need to heal a piercing.    After it is well healed, you can use jojoba, vitamin E, emu, etc oils to massage the area. This will help reduce any scar tissue you may develop.    To be on the safe side, you should go to your piercist, and ask what he/she thinks.
YozvdD5Naa	Probably not. If you're 13 and haven't had a physical in the last year then you should, but otherwise, just cut back on the sugar and don't sweat the small stuff. Sometimes, if I have been sitting or lying down for a while and get up quickly, I will feel faint. Usually it just means you're experiencing some changes in your blood pressure.

Depending on the drugs and how long he has been taking them, there could have been damage to his sperm so the baby could be at risk for birth defects - a number of drugs taken over time damage the reproductive system of both males and females which could cause defects in the baby.|`|0817655303781d1a57a4800a31dc038aaa	Well then, you must spend a LOT of time on the phone because you've been asking about this for a while.

The reason a mother's drug use can impact a fetus is because many of the molecules in the mother's circulation will transfer to the fetus' circulation.  Since the father's only developmental contribution to the fetus is DNA, his drug use will not likely affect the fetus.     If the drug use caused chromosomal abnormalities in his sperm, that could potentially cause chromosomal disorders in the fetus, like Down's syndrome, cystic fibrosis, and Turner's syndrome.|`|oqxlmKn3aa	No.  When they do a drug test they don't just test for the mere presence of the substance.

AA11412408	Personally, I think that shoes and terrain are the most important pieces of this puzzle.  If you are just walking (as opposed to running), it is important to find shoes that are designed specifically for walking.  Walking shoes are constructed differently than running shoes or cross trainers.  It may cost a bit more than you want to spend, but it might be worth it if you can decrease the pain.      Also, find somewhere soft to walk.  Cement is the worst surface.  Street asphalt is softer (ergo better) than cement, and dirt paths/trails or grassy areas are even better.    An internet search suggested you use what they call the "relative rest" approach.  This text is copied from medicinenet.com:    "This multifaceted approach includes:    Workouts such as stationary bicycling or pool running - these will allow maintenance of cardiovascular fitness.     Icing - to reduce inflammation.     Anti-inflammatory medications, such as ibuprofen (Advil/Motrin); naproxen (Aleve/Naprosyn) - are also a central part of rehabilitation.     A 4-inch wide Ace bandage wrapped around the region - to also help reduce discomfort.     Calf and anterior (front of) leg stretching and strengthening - to address the biomechanical problems discussed above and reduce pain.     Careful attention to selecting the correct running shoe based upon the foot type (flexible pronator vs. rigid supinator) - this is extremely important. In selected cases shoe inserts (orthotics) may be necessary.     Stretching and strengthening exercises are done twice a day.     Running - only when symptoms have generally resolved (often about 2 weeks), AND with several restrictions:     A level and soft terrain is best.     Distance is limited to 50% of that tolerated preinjury.     Intensity (pace) is similarly cut by one half.     Over a 3-6 week period, a gradual increase in distance is allowed.     Only then can a gradual increase in pace be attempted."|`|AA10906058	I get pretty bad shin splints, and find it helps if I stretch before and after I walk/run.  A good rule of thumb is stretch out after the walk/run for as long as you stretched at the beginning.  also try to walk on asphalt, not concrete if possible, it sounds crazy, but concrete is harder.  Also walking downhill creates more stress on your joints, so flat, and uphill is easier.  (hard to walk only uphill and end up at the beginning I know)    I always made it a point to stretch my ankles more since my shin splints were so bad.|`|790f1443ce6c423d4ac9b01ccf7ebb19aa	Don't walk on cement.|`|Foh5VJRPaa	You need to find a footwear store that actually has qualified personnel working.  You need to get them to assess your foot type, sounds crazy but there are 3 different types of feet. You need to select the appropriate shoe for your particular type of foot and find one that is comfortable.    Lets say some one with a flat foot buys a pair of shoes made for a high Arch, that could cause damage to the arches, shins, and muscles associated with the foots anatomy.  Once you find the right shoe for your feet then that should eliminate alot of the problem.  Also, you need to maintain proper posture (no slouching, bird walking or walking on your tip toes), keep your feet at a smooth rolling action so that you do not send to much stress up the top of your feet.  If you feel more "pain or stress" on the top of your feet and shins, you are not keeping proper posture.  When you walk you are using your "calves" not your shins, therefore you should "feel the burn" in the back not the front.
AA10432148	Before you go ahead and quit your job, try to get to the root of the problem. What exactly is making you "hate" your job?

Once you've found the problem, talk to your boss about a solution.(Unless he/she is the problem...)|`|676203bee3d4bd188c5d63514b2bca6daa	Yes, what does your gut tell you. If you think you need to go to the doctors. Please, go you know better than anyone what is wrong with you. Ultimately you are responsible for your well being the doctor can help. But you have to do the work. You are the one who is responsible for your own happiness and your life. Life isn't easy, Lord don't I know it. I've been through hell and back a few times. One thing I have learned you have to be strong and diligent. Go to the doctor and tell her what your feeling and maybe she can help you but you have to manage your life. Take care of yourself , eat right, exercise, sleep good, don't abuse drugs and alcohol and worship God and nature. Another words try to do the right thing. My spiritual adviser always told me if you do the right thing you will feel better.|`|xAqR8NL9aa	You need to find a new job, it's the only way you'll feel better.

Good luck x|`|5kAJs6C4aa	go to see your GP yes.  let them decide whether you need anti-depressants because they are a last resort for many people (unless you're in the US...then they are one of the first apparently :/ - just what ive heard!)    Not all anti-d's work with every person...so if you do get put on them it may be some trial and error and there will be a period of where you feel like nothing is happening before they kick in.

When you aren't having to use your hand leave it open.  When you're going to play tennis again there are special bandages that are made for hands and that cushion blisters.  If you can't go get those you'll need to use gauze and tape to wrap the entire area.

i7CCPKSLaa	Yes, it is the biggest key to losing weight, Also just eliminating the unhealthy food out of your daily eating habits can do wonders.  If you put them both together you should see a significant weight loss.|`|I48z1pmzaa	yes|`|weadibPeaa	the key to losing weight is a very simple mathematical formula. you must consume less calories than you burn daily in order to lose weight. this means that if you live a sedentary lifestyle and only burn appx 1050 calories per day and you're taking in 2500 calories per day you will be gaining weight. if you live a moderate lifestyle and burn appx 2000 calories per day, and take in the same amount you will remain the same weight. as you can see the easiest way to be burning more calories than you are consuming is to a. exercise and b. consume less food. restricting the normal 2000 calorie diet to a 1500 calorie diet means that you will have a deficit of 3500 calories by the end of the week. 3500 calories burned = 1 pound of fat.    trust me...i took many many clinical nutrition classes

v6eW6E9saa	*Brief loss of awareness: Staring spells begins without warning, and only last for a few seconds. The child becomes unaware of his surroundings, the eyes are still, but there may be rhythmic blinking, rapid breathing or chewing movements. The child is unaware of the fit, and is not confused afterwards. Although these can occur many times a day, absence fits are often unnoticed by parents or teachers. Children with absence fits may have difficulty in learning if the problem is not recognised and treated.     *Mood changes: The sensory or emotional systems may be affected, causing a variety of symptoms. These can include tingling or numbness, seeing lights, hearing sounds, odd tastes or odd smells; and feeling emotions like fear, sadness, anger or even joy. It may be that a specific memory is triggered, or that there is a deja vu experience - that an event appears as a previous memory, even although it has only just happened. These symptoms are often called an aura.     *Muscle spasms: A single muscle, or a group of muscles contracts, usually only for a second or so, causing part of the body to jerk or, if the contraction continues, to stiffen. The event may be repeated several times, or the convulsive movements may spread to other parts of the body    *Loss of muscle tone: In this case, a group of muscles relax, for example causing the child to fall. The arms or the body muscles, for example, may go limp. Obviously, this can cause physical harm, and children prone to drop attacks often have to wear protective headgear.     *Loss of consciousness: Finally, there may be, complete loss of consciousness    In a typical fit, various of these physical manifestations may be combined. Thus in a generalised tonic clonic fit, the child may emit a short cry, lose consciousness and fall to the floor; the muscles stiffen (tonic phase) and then the limbs jerk and twitch (clonic phase); bladder control may be lost. Consciousness is regained slowly, and afterwards the child may feel fatigue, confusion and disorientation. These final effects may last for a few minutes or several hours.    The pattern of fit depends on where in the brain the epileptic event starts, and how it propagates to other areas of the brain. In a simple fit pattern, the event only occurs in one area of the brain. In more complex patterns, like the one described above, it starts in one area of the brain and propagates to other areas.    While there is a wide variety of patterns of fit, most children who suffer from fits will experience the same pattern of fit on successive occasions, or at most a limited number of different patterns. The pattern of fits may also evolve with time.    The consequences to the child are not related to the physical violence of the fit. While violent fits may cause physical damage, most fits are not thought to further harm the brain. However, some of the minor manifestations, particularly minor tremors in babies a few months old may be an indicator of infantile spasms, a serious condition, which can cause serious damage to the brain, and needs to be treated as soon as possible. It is important to consult a doctor if you notice anything that might be a fit. It is better to be safe than sorry    hope this helps you xx|`|EmgiGg17aa	as best as I can remember is that in my last one, first alot of saliva is formed in the mouth-I mean alot -which was the pre empt before the actual seizure.

How long has it been since getting the crowns? Are they sensitive to colds? When you bite down on them are they sore?     If sensitive to colds, try avoiding any tartar control or whitening toothpastes. You can use the original formula paste or gel of any brand you like. Keep the gum area of the crown very clean. Any plaque that remains in this area will make the gums and tooth sensitive. Plaque is full of acids and leaving it at the margin of a crown will cause possible decay and gum infection. You can also use a sensitive-type toothpaste. If they are sore to biting, you need an adjustment. Don't wait very long to get back in, you will make the tooth very sore.

Jog when you wake up, drink plenty of water to keep yourself hydrated and to help curb your appetite drink fat-free milk, and follow a strict detox-style diet of fruits, veggies and protein supplements/drinks. Most importantly, EXERCISE. Even if you didnt diet so strictly, you would still lose weight if you exercised more often. Period. Exercising burns calories . . . simple as that. Jog in the morning, do some stretching/yoga at lunch and then jog at night. If you go to the gymn, DO CARDIO.

It could mean anything!|`|2b585d84b2ef2cd546d498a301c7710aaa	Go to the ER and get checked out.|`|AA10928222	are you taking drugss????|`|Hi3GDxVZaa	check your blood pressure immediately. Consult with doctor.|`|IE6oJLFcaa	you are in the initial stages of epilepsy. Its a symptom of epilepsy in the initial conditions which can be treated well; if gone to a neurologist  immediately|`|4TiWZLKXaa	Go to the emergency room you could be  having a type of seizure.
7fUKhGEgaa	That's like asking why not just treat epileptic seizures after they start or why not just treat heart attacks after they happen.    1) For many conditions, it's a lot easier to prevent them than stop them once they've gotten going.    2) For many conditions, there is damage done very early on in an episode. For bipolars, that would be losing jobs, hurting relationships, hurting people, including the patient.    Neither lithium nor the anticonvulsants used as mood stabilizers stop a mania quickly. Antipsychotics will have some effect quickly, but maybe not enough to prevent hospitalization and a lot of social damage for the patient.    Up to 25% of bipolars commit suicide. That's how powerful the moods are. Prevention definitely works better than trying to play catch-up with that complication.|`|6112fce921c5789ff47b05c280e49bffaa	Some bipolar patients who have mild, infrequent episodes can go without taking prophylactic meds and start on them if an episode begins to arise.  For many people staying on mood stabilizers is a good idea.  They can prevent or greatly reduce any episodes.  Antidepressants can take several weeks to begin to work.  Also people experiencing the early symptoms of mania or hypomania find the elevated mood and increased energy to be pleasurable.  By the time the mania begins to spiral out of control the person usually loses insight and refuses treatment.|`|61380560f287444cf3d858b7e555eb30aa	it is better to prevent the radical moodswings with medication than to risk that the next episode may be so severe that something bad and or permanently damaging may happen.    yes~it can build for months leading up to the "episode", but the erradic behavior(s) that may accompany this part of the cycle can be very bad. (sexual promiscuity, kleptomania, drug use, suicide, etc.)    also as we get older the cycles can come more rapidly and without any warning between them...    there is no guarantee that every episode will have the same type of gradual crescendo...     and     stopping any medication suddenly, even months after the manic episode may have seemed to stop, is dangerous because the medication may be all that is controlling the behavior(s), and this can cause an intense mania that will be almost impossible to stop.    preventing the rapid cycling that comes with bipolar is the safest way to treat the condition.|`|9eno55hCaa	A lot of the medications people take for Bi-polar disorder take a long time to get into the persons system, they just dont start working immediately.  Also some people would prefer to be in total control of the disease and not let the disease control them.  When your manic you dont want to take the medication regardless of whether you take it every day or not, Im not going to stop what Im doing and enjoying to get treatment when Im in an up phase because it feels good to be in an up phase, its the crash and the down phase that sucks.    By taking the medications every day people  at least have some hope of preventing an up or down phase all together, or at least a little bit more control over it when it does happen.|`|1fb93b428d2be687184268a857f6e5f6aa	Bipolar illness is known as a "kindling" illness.  Generally speaking a person's overall illness becomes worse with all the more high and low episodes they have.  Medicines are used in a maintanance dosage so they have a "prophylactic" effect.   Most people do not have bad experiences with side effects.  The side effects are usually minor and diminish with time.  A person has to remember that bipolar illness is considered genetic.  It is akin to diabetes in that you don't get rid of it--you treat it.  The more conservatively the better.|`|8vHwTzOXaa	the meds keep the person calm through the attack but like all meds they need time to work through the system inorder to get the proper efect out of them. so if you treat them when they happen you will sometimes get people like me that will try to destroy or take another persons life and the meds didn't have the time to work, so it is a saftey procaution|`|A39uD2noaa	u have no idea what u are talking about.
542012bab64a426db53af066b9dd765eaa	how about just not smoking.  it would save the whole trouble of covering it up.    I'm sorry but i feel that if you smoked weed and shouldn't have (which is all of us) then you should face the consequences which in your case may be the new job.    they have these drug tests in place for a reason too.  to stop people that are high and think they are not hurting anyone from making a faulty part at a factory or other work environment that could end up hurting or killing someone that i know and care about.    **ADDED**    so you work in a food processing factory.  well guess what...  food gets contaminated with things that can kill people.  i don't want you to be working on the line and contaminating something that my family is going to eat.  don't you ever watch the new (doubt it because most people how smoke weed don't care about things going on in the world, because they are irresponsible) but if you did watch the news from time to time, you would see that food products do get contaminated, and it sometimes does KILL people.      don't try and justify your recklessness saying your not hurting anyone because you very well could.      i hope that you do get caught so that you are not putting people lives at risk.    oh and could you tell me the name of the place where you work so that i know not to buy food from there.    thanks.|`|AA10018260	i thought that weed stayed in your system for 30 days.  i would suggest to keep drinking that apple cider vinegar (eww ) and lots and lots and lots of water.  also.....make sure u pee first thing when u get up because i believe that your first pee of the day is most likely to show drug use in it.....then drink a whole bucnh more water.  but truthfully i have no idea what i am talking about but if i were in your situation then thats what i would do.  good luck.  i have a drug test tommorow too.|`|AA10928222	i dont think youll pass the drug test  seriously i think pot stays in your system for a yr if im not mistaken  god luck please let us know what happens ok|`|88562abbd8df363760a640bd1ccc518aaa	Weed takes 30 to 40 days to clear your system.  I'd get one of those drinks at a head shop and pray it works!  Good luck!|`|EfUiKpSxaa	LISTEN UP I ACTUALLY KNOW WHAT I AM TALKING ABOUT!  (some people)  THC stays in fatty tissue. If you are overweight, your chances of passing are less than if you are very slim.    Since I dont know anything about your body frame, I will tell you how to pass your test.    Drink as much water as you can. (flush your system.) At least a gallon of water between now and the time of the test.    Then a half hour before you actually test, drink a glass of orange juice and take a mulit-vitamin. This will put the correct balance of nutrients into your urine, so that they cannot fail you because of a "flush".    This is virtually fail proof.|`|AA10854232	Chug some pure cranberry juice.  You can get it at natural foods stores.  Take a vitamin.  Hope for the best.  There is no real way of telling, unless you get a home kit at the pharmacy.  A week is a short period of time.  Considering you probably smoked a bowl to your dome,  it's hard to say.|`|eb06528eabd8658cba5135964412a9a0aa	The latest drug testing technology is accurate up to 6 months and catches drug masking chemicals. etc.    In short they don't need to find drugs. They only need to find an effort to cover it up.... no job for you.... clean up your act for a while... employers are getting much more strict on these things.
xWynkFQKaa	For an easy fix get a massage. It may cost money but well worth it.   If that's not possible, slowly move your neck around and massage your shoulders yourself. You should be able to get it loose enough to feel better.   Best of luck.|`|AA10928222	have someone massage it for you then if that dont help try a heating pad|`|4a82e3f7c7dd6e6b2ed3898214307e46aa	alternate a cold pack and heat pad.

I know it would taste better.  Or is it a medical problem that is causing it?  Have you tried just a little prune juice mixed with grape juice to camouflage the flavor?  You might try cutting bread out of his diet also.|`|OtqB24NVaa	Oh poor thing, I hope he outgrows this problem! My son never did. he is 13 now. He is always constipated and when he is on prescription meds for it, he also has bad cramping and he is also so loose then that he cant enjoy any physical activities because it makes him run straight to the restroom. I have used OTC beds for him when it gets really bad and he never had any problems with them. I would only give him about a quarter of the dose that is directed for an adult. Wait atleast 6-8 hrs and if it has not helped him yet, then give him another quarter. Im not 100% that your doctor would give you the ok on him using these meds, im just telling you what I have tried in the past that didnt cause any difficulties. Good luck!|`|f3994fe8b95cd6445b8c019ae5961d1baa	Isn't there ones for kids? I think it's called Pedalite or something. I could be wrong. Why not check the website for any information. They usually tell you on the bottle if it's safe for kids at age 5.|`|76O6wTRCaa	My 3year old grandson takes it. His doctor prescribed it. I'd ask the pharmacist about it and how much to give.|`|VEwOstweaa	It is not safe for any child to be given any laxatives unless a dr prescribes it (which is rare)  If your son has such a problem with constipation, you should give him more fruit, veggies, and water!  good luck!
AA10314632	I had a fairly 'minor' sprain, and it hurt  for 7 weeks.  For the first few days I could hardly walk, but could drive OK.

Get checked out or do your own test.  put a recorder in your room and listen to it to see if you stop breathing and then gasp during the night.  Good luck!   If it's just a mental thing, buy an alarm with bright lights (sold for hearing impaired)  and put it on the other side of the room so you have to get up and look at the light to turn it off.|`|CTZPNo67aa	Do not eat anything after 7pm.

1lGjeJUtaa	There is one problem that may be occurring.  Your gastrocnemius muscles may not be working properly.  This muscle makes sure that you do not hyper-extend your knee.  This muscle also helps with plantarflexion of the foot  With it not working properly, you could possibly have pain with walking.  I would get this checked out.|`|AA10592610	I would consider advice from a sports trainer, usually a local gym or college would have one. Maybe even a physical therapist could offer some advice, local hospitals are a good place to start
Vj13f7zmaa	Yes, and it is called EFT or Emotional Freedom Technique.  I have seen it work on a Vietnam Vet who had been in and out of the mental hospital for 30 yrs.  He is just fine now.  It is a crazy looking accupressure thing, and you feel totally ridiculous the first time you do it.  But if you get relief, then who cares.  You can see someone being treated for PTSD on YouTube where i have listed the link.  I would be happy to help you learn how to do this for yourself, or if you want to just try from a manual go to www.emofree.com and download it for free.  This process completely took away anxiety attacks that I had been dealing with for years.  Feel free to contact me.|`|6BFFkpUAaa	I haven't heard of a cure as of yet.|`|951483cfb9daff8f4880ea125371effbaa	Is there a cure, that's hard to say, and not knowing what caused yours makes it even harder. I guess, going on the majority of cases I would have to say no there is no cure. Learning to except what the cause(s) were, forgiving yourself if need be, excepting what happened, and taking the steps needed to over come that "moment" in time are a few of what one can do to "get on" with their life. It's a funny disease, you can appear fine on the outside while your guts are being eaten alive on the inside,|`|wX2J8d5Daa	Yes, for some.

AA12342090	You don't have to take the sugar pills and you can go straight onto the next pack without getting a period if you want.  Its feels more normal to have a period thats why they have the sugar ones. Keep in mind you can take your pill as regular as clock work and a small number of people still get pregant. Do a pregnancy test anyway just to be sure|`|ACnb0UhLaa	I highly doubt you're pregnant. I wouldnt worry about it. The sugar pills are only there so you keep the habit of taking a pill.  As long as you took the pill you forgot then you should have no problem.  Depending on how long you've been on it, you system may still be getting used to it. If you don't get it within a couple days I would call your doctor and ask them over the phone before going in to see them.

The products are great products, so at least you are looking at a legit product and legit business.|`|Oq5qaGsUaa	it is a fantastic company who have been around for just over 49years. they have never had a law suit. their products are fantastic that even the USDA did an independent study on their carotenoid complex and published their findings in the American journal of clinical nutrition. If you are looking for fantastic products and a great business opportunity that  can be done anywhere in the world then GNLD is for you. These products are so real it is unbelievable.

I HOPE you will get some help, talk to your parents, or to your doctor, to have them get you to a counselor. PLEASE!!  I don't think that you are BiPolar, I think you are grieving and need a little assistance to help understand it.

I would talk to your mom/dad or some adult that you really trust about everything and ask them if you can go get some counseling. There is NOTHING wrong with counseling, it's just a way for you to talk to someone and get some answers.

If you were bipolar, you'd have manic episodes to correspond to your depressive episodes - you'd feel that everything was great, you were amazing, tons of energy, doing stupid things because you lacked self-control, etc.    You might still be depressed, though.

You've been through a lot, and it's traumatic.    Almost every kid your age is a flurry of emotions, and to be otherwise would be abnormal.|`|bACxlvjoaa	no. you're not bipolar.  you're probably just depressed. bipolar people experiences highs and lows. from what you say you only experience the highs. it'd be a lot worse if you were bipolar.|`|cYUv21Jxaa	Hi,     It seems to me you have a lot of things going on in your life and you are finding a lot of support from your friends but, I question if they can give you all the help you may need to deal with the grieving and despair you may feel. The internet can be time consuming and especially sleep time. It is very easy to get addicted to the use of the computer and time slips away so fast. There is kind of safe but distant feeling chatting on the net.      First of all if there is any recreational drugs or alcohol involved this will complicate your emotions and healing. I don't mean to offend you but, that is one question you will be asked when you go for professional help.      To answer your questions about Bipolar. Your description of your emotions doesn't quite sound typical of bipolar symptoms. Your mood swings are really close together. I am bipolar and there are terms to describe mood swing behavior in Bipolar's. Manic is the most severe high and irrational behavior. Then there is hypomanic; a milder form of manic. Depression can be caused by environmental issuses, past trauma or as in the case of a bipolar a chemical imbalance in the brain. Severe depression can include days of sleep and sometimes even out of the body experiences. There are also Bipolar that are called rapid cyclers but, you do not seem to fit the mold. Understanding this process will help a person not be so scared about what they are feeling. I will say that during a full blown manic or severe depression a person needs help to break the mood. The bipolar brain locks into a thought and will be invincible during a manic or feel like a curse to the world in a severe depression. Life is full of events that can cause euphoria or sadness. Many people think about ending their life and it is always good to get help and talk it out but, it can also be used as a way to get attention that may be lacking from other life's events. I agree with many of the answers given and I applaud the fact that you are searching for answers. This is probably the best place besides professional help. We are not professional but, we care about you and I trust the answers will come to you if you keep going, even when you don't feel like it. I caution you not to get to wrapped up with someone that talks like they can fix all your problems. That's not real. We have struggles so we can grow stronger, similar to the need of a newborn baby's need to cry so they can strengthen their lungs. Oh the anger thing is pretty common for your age because you are learning to break away from your family so you can start your own life. Anger is usually a mask for fear. This is normal but, try to respect others as you would want to be. Those may be the people that love you the most and you will need later in life. Best Wishes Always|`|hL1GWdUEaa	id say you aren't bipolar but you just aren't a happy person. try to only think of the good things. i know its hard.|`|j4AQm1Jtaa	I believe you are but im not certain

Please see a doctor - you may need antihistamine tablets and/or cream.  Don't use any deodorant or soap (use sorbelene cream or just water) under your arms until you see doctor.  Or see a chemist if you can't see a doctor in a hurry.|`|9wBpltXoaa	No one can tell you how long that rash is going to last. If they do they are probably lying or following some average statistics. Basic fact is, how much did you spray and for how long have you been spraying it. This will probably change how long the rash will last so if you sprayed a lot the rash will probably take longer. However, averagelly, the rush should not take more than a week but for the time being I would say jus try and lay low and try not to scratch. If the rash persists you should probably see a doctor
AA10788734	how old are you. Hormones start to kick in around the time you get your period and they will make you want to have sex. Completely normal.

A womans sexual health is very important, but do not go off and just have sex, you may regret it later on.|`|o3xOyfLdaa	no, it is not an uncommon urge to have.  I would recommend that you take all the precautions that you can such as birth control BEFORE hand by at least 2 months, and using a condom.  Depending on what your age is, other things to consider is whether or not your body is physically ready for it, and if you are ready for it.  A little known fact some people do not realize, is the first time you have sex, you form a bond with that person.  No matter how you try to hate them later, you are still going to care for them so choose wisely.  Also, keep in mind most guys will say or do what ever it takes to get in your pants, and after words when they got what they wanted, you mean nothing to them.  I am a guy.  I know how alot of us think.  I would suggest you wait for a stable relationship or marriage, but that is up to you. Good luck and hope you choose wisely.|`|OzzZlXMtaa	Actually no.

222c3710b1c82cfb0a40a144369157a8aa	Is it is polite to have an erection when a pretty girl sits on your lap?      I guess I would put it this way:  if a girl who's pretty enough to cause an erection and knows enough to understand what an erection is thinks you're being impolite when you poke her with your erection, she should realize it is impolite to be a pretty girl who sits on guys laps and does not take an erection as a compliment.  Does that make any sense?  In other words, if you don't like getting poked by my erection, don't sit on my lap - that's my policy.    On the other hand any pretty girl who doesn't mind being poked by my erection and doesn't sit on my lap when the opportunity arises is being pretty impolite to me as well.    In any case, about the only time you should be embarrassed by an erection is if it's caused by a close relative like your mother or sister.|`|GUdvd8I3aa	That's a bit like brushing or leaning against her boob and her nipple getting erect... of COURSE it does! That's what we're wired for! Nothing to be embarrassed about, unless she keeps doing it deliberately to wind you up.|`|Eo6Z2jXSaa	That's nice the way she said it, because she could've easily got disgusted and said vulgur things, especially if you just met. If you're prone to get them when she sits in your lap and like for them to go unnoticed, try wearing baggier pants or larger one so it's not as visible. Hope thishelps.|`|UVgt1IhPaa	its no big deal. it happens to my boyfriend when i sit on him too, or if we're laying close together. she definantly likes it (i do). it makes her feel like you find her sexy... and trust me... all girls wanna feel sexy. don't sweat it. its natural. hope this helpss.|`|FHjNdKlTaa	Hey Dude  What guy would not get an erection with his fine g.f sitting on his lap. She told you    she must of liked it and is wondering if you are going to move your hips next time. Take it as a great sign shes liking you more then just like.   Good Luck|`|ncbCCzAiaa	just say that she can sit on your lap and you guys can talk about the first thing to pop up.|`|5xNJdd69aa	I mean it happens....it's natural and there's nothing you can do to stop it. It's good that she's understanding.|`|rzDbuDF8aa	not really but  as long as it does not happen in public its ok i guess my gf says  the same thing so i guess its ok|`|AA12314319	Yes, it's a compliment, but she should not express her feelings in company.|`|AABeDnmnaa	it depends on the girl, and she said she liked it, and its normal, bcuz she's probably hot to you (cuz i've never seen her), so it just means your normal|`|UmjGlLl9aa	It's your girlfriend it's allowed. She'd be more concerned if you didn't.|`|jipKf0f2aa	It shows she excites the heck out of ya and you work! Be sure she doesn't sit on your lap when others are around! Dad might not think to well of it! If she likes it, this is good.|`|Npze2s0Uaa	yeah, i used to get erections from my ex just from her being in conctact with me (holding hands etc)    its normal, and she should realize it is and yes its ok|`|qyPv50I2aa	no its not polite, but yes it is a compliment and yes girls like it|`|CjEoyF2caa	so whats wrong wit an errection dont all guys get them|`|2fa0c14266b4adfa5e7018131d478e57aa	At least it works.|`|AA11308339	It just means you're attracted to your girlfriend.  It probably makes her feel sexy because it means you think she's attractive. It IS a compliment. Words you can fake, erections are real. lol
PgdQ7Tuvaa	I'm unsure as to why you think that you may have Trich?  If you're allergic to a certain type of soap, and then used it on your vagina (one of the most sensitive areas of the body), there is a good chance that you are having an allergic reaction to the soap.    Most STDs will be detectable within 1 to 4 weeks after infection.    STDs can be passed through the behavior that you are describing; if a man has an active STD, he has many, many white blood cells in his semen and pre-***.  If he is "edging" you (rubbing his penis along your vagina and occasionally slipping in) you are putting yourself at risk for contracting whatever STD he may have, including HIV.      That's why all the messages about condoms stress using them from start to finish; before there is any contact of sexual organs.    If you don't want to wait for your own window period to pass, you could ask him to get a full STD screen, which would give you a better idea of where you may stand.|`|94d06b1e5f4de0aaee7851cd3440c7bdaa	You could have an allergic reaction there due to the use of the soap that you are allergic to. and there also could be a candidiasis.   this thing is sure though, if you have trichomoniasis, you can go and get tested right away and it will be there. Please don't delay the visit to your practitioner, its better to be safe.    hope that helps.|`|AA12046386	between three weeks and two months.......  No lectures here! But I must say that you probably know that the precum can get you pregnant, you knew that right. so I am sure you are on birth control. Just for anyone reading this.  Just because they don't *** in you, doesn't mean you can't get prenant. There are sperm in the precum. slipping out right away doesn't get it done. small amount of itching might be "a yeast"  there is a simple test for that too at your local pharmacy..and there is a treatment there for that too. Good Luck!
wdfyniQkaa	unless it will cause you long term problems I wouldn't mess with them, I think bowed legs look fine!|`|AA12046386	They should come apart slightly! It's normal !  If it is really severe.  See an Orthopedic Dr and see what he  says at a consult, there is surgery. I bet your fine though.|`|6Qpby6X4aa	yes there is a procedure that can correct this|`|1CUVdrUCaa	I know of an elderly man who had his straightened.... the chaps from work bought him a novelty cake into the Hospital in the shape of his 'old' legs!  Good luck to you!|`|zoy5CIweaa	Many people have legs which curve slightly. Don't worry! You really don't need surgery and no-one but yourself will ever notice! A slight curve does not constitute bowed legs...|`|pOypNf9caa	I have bowed legs and I love them.....they are what makes us different.  Keep them just the way they are.....
45rxBSi6aa	Vitamin D comes mostly from the sun....if you have been in the caribbean or anywhere tropical, havent you noticed that your hair becomes thicker and more rich looking? because of the sun, your hair gets natural highlights and becomes more luscious looking.....the ocean water also helps with the texture of the hair.   ALSO! the sun's Vit.D helps clean your skin.....this is why some of us break out after been exposed in the sun for a while....its because the sun is clearing your pores and getting all that gunk out....so i recommend that you eat healthy (another factor to better hair quality) and absorb the suns beautiful rays more often!    hope this helped you out!  =]|`|AA11475184	well not directly  but vit D is definetly used to those persons with hair loss
wcg3fkwVaa	Most of the time it depends on how bad your teeth are. Mine cost me $4,500.  When researching how much they cost I found it was normally a range from $4,000-$8,000.|`|AA11386158	Google that *****.|`|vctrY840aa	don't know the price but i would suggest not getting them. The part where they glue the thing on gets yellow so you end up having a yellow box on your tooth
AA11525891	Yes. The question is what is a child doing having sex? Boys can produce ejaculate fluid at a pretty early age and any bodily fluid can potentially carry the virus.|`|fa7013a55715c48bd23f4f8a08dc0d7daa	http://www.actionhealthinc.org/teenzone/...|`|y0dremY5aa	Yes|`|zizUbJjTaa	A HIV positive person needs to wear a condom 100% of the time for sex.     HIV is not a disease you want to play with.    Without a condom there is a chance that HIV can be passed on.     If you are with a HIV positive partner, please talk to a sexual health nurse for more advise on how to protect yourself. |`|nAAF3OHAaa	Absolutely. HIV virus exists in pre-*** and if you had unprotected sex, you could be infected (although the risk is higher if you ejaculate but even if you dont, the risk is still there).    So if you had unprotected sex, you need to get tested. Talk to your healthcare professional and he/she will give you instructions on how and when to get tested.
51n1Pm0Iaa	nope it wouldn't bother me a bit|`|E64juLwJaa	Not a lady:but got news for you:there are more curved ones then straight ones.  And it is no problem at all  Space|`|AA12212678	Im not a lady but I also have a bent knob and I haven't had any problems so far in fact it usually gets quite good feedback. ;-)|`|PciELXTXaa	Not really! ladies turn off when you have a penis but you don't know how to used it in terms of sex.|`|XlPfiBMKaa	not really, unless its like L shaped...but liken the first person said, it can make you have a good orgasm  too, if its bent to where it rums certain places..|`|iNYDUFdGaa	If they have never seen bent one before they wont know what is going on, but its good once you use it ;).

ItJzrvQ4aa	When  you are losing  weight,  you should exercise and diet  together.  If  you exercise without dieting, you will get bigger appetite,  which  will  lead  to  increase  of  weight, or muscle grow  underneath  the  fat  layer, and make you bulkier. If you diet without  exercising,  you  will  become  flabby  and will have excess skin. For  diet,  go  wheat  free.  No pasta, pizza, bread and so on. And no food  after  7  p.m. People achieve marvellous results with it. Depending on  your  initial  weight, you can drop upwards from 20 pounds a month. If  you  don't  eat  wheat then you don't eat all those sticky, fatty goey  cakes,  you  don't eat junk food, and you don't eat biscuits. But your  diet  is  still  balanced.  It  costs  nothing, and you do not have to  calculate  points  or  to  buy special meals or plans. For exercising,  start with walking, and then switch to running/jogging. Running is the  most efficient and calorie-burn exercise ever. If you are overweight a  lot,  walk  first  or you may have health complications (heart attack,  disjointed  bones and so on). Weight lifting is a good means to target  your problem areas for men and women. It's not necessarily to become a  bodybuilder or even join a gym - a couple of dumbbells will help you  to target your problem areas (stomach, butt, legs, arms, chest).|`|lnMsWc1taa	Cut off your head?      Seriously, just eat right, and exercise kind of hard. You won't lose the mega-pounds, but you will look pretty darn good.|`|9XmJPjXvaa	you have to eat no matter what.  but it has to be the right diet.  if you get the right diet plan and exercise (cardio) minimum of 30 minutes everyday, you'll get there
cj0yAqeiaa	are you over exercising   or maybe you aren't drinking a lot of water  try drinking water it will probably help|`|EXq2QYqOaa	Go to the doctor. It sounds like cystitis. It could also be a UTI. In either case, you need to see a doctor to get proper medication before it gets worse. You're risking incontinence, more pain, fever, and other infections if you wait longer than necessary.|`|ZKw46efXaa	burning toilet paper, are you joking?!
a80dc14a526cb69ec2afcb122f024d04aa	its kinda of weird to think about it but you can lift 40% more weight going down than pull up.  so for a couple of weeks before you can seriously do pull ups. you want to stand on something or jump up and slowly lower yourself down
Nq5tE1h0aa	they say oily skin does prevent most wrinkles because it coats the skin. like eww i know. but me and my mom have oily skin and my mom looks 10 yrs younger no lie. so try to mimic the oil with mosturizing and try putting olive oil on ur skin once a week. and try not to be stressed. that wiil kill you and your face.|`|ru4wtKFsaa	Your only supposed to drink 8 glasses of H2O a day. And cleaning your face (VERY FREQUENTLY) can damage your skin.
t2R3mEMoaa	Depending on your age, this could just be something you are going through. Middle age or around menopause this seems to be common among women. I just stay up til I am tired enough to sleep. Others use herbal sleep aids and teas. There is meditation, soft music and exercise that have been used and found quite helpful. Keep searching and try not to get into sleep aids from a drug store or prescription meds. if at all possible.|`|GzlckRcnaa	wash your face|`|AA10420187	Free your mind and take a nice warm bath and light candles and just think happy thoughts then lay in bed and close your eyes and just dont think about troubles.|`|9LNXNABtaa	I used to be like that, It was because i had a lot of things on my mind!.... It's so frustrating when you can't sleep! Maybe see your doctor and they might be able to help!|`|GoluIRIAaa	Go for a walk then take a luke warm bath also you could put on some soothing music and that should help you sleep better.|`|hKax9Jl6aa	Go to a sleep disorder clinic or take some sleeping medicine.|`|a4JHrSb9aa	do something thatll wear you out. run, be active in some way, even read. youll sleep much easier. Or you can take melatonin which is a Natural hormone pill thats  already in people that makes them get sleepy. this just adds to it. take it one night half an hour before the time you wanna sleep every night and the next night youll usually get tired at that time again. it helps adjust your body clock =]  p.s. you can just buy it in the medicine section of whatever store.|`|aapuQ5u2aa	About an hour before you decide to go to bed, take a nice bath/shower,  dont listen to music/tv/computer, etc. Just chill out and relax. Sooner or later, lay down, and feel free to doze off.|`|MDfjikBBaa	from a fellow who has stayed up for weeks on end i say their isn't any one way.  exercise till exhaustion.  sometimes I watched old cartoons. schedule your day hour by hour filled with tasks that need to be completed- if  theirs enough things to be done you'll be tired by the end of the day.  those are some of the more healthier ways (since i don't believe in positive thoughts or warm baths and warm milk and i won't be the one to suggest alcohol.)
B8e8x60Saa	jus try to be discreet abt it.. no gurl wants you.. adjusting right infront of her (they find it gross for some reason heh).. thats why women yawn and scratch there eyes.. cuz they got nothin to scratch.. its jus normal.. got to always check if they there:)|`|Q5qpMLOVaa	A friend of mine does that constantly in front of us. He doesn't hide it at all or anything.    Personally, I find it a bit gross and disrespectful, but hey, whatever works for him right.|`|E64juLwJaa	You are not adjusting all the time but feeling yourself up.  My brother in law does this all day long.  Planets.|`|r1fVrEwcaa	yes mine peni|`|jxfZ9ebEaa	I can't take my hands off of it.|`|AA11522944	It's normal for guys to 'adjust' kinda automatically.  It's like scratching an itch you don't really think about it....    BUT....    DON'T be one of those Dudes who are constantly playing with themselves... it doesn't look cool... it looks like you've got jock itch or crabs or something.

dzukCeGhaa	I heard from a lot of good sources that crest whitestrips are the best.  If your not not sure which ones too use, try asking your dentist. If you want to try crest white strips, on their website they have a quiz you can take to find out which type best suits your needs.
dDdkYpDzaa	My parents get their house sprayed once a week - they have been assured it's not harmful to grandkids or pets - they even asked the doctor.  It depends on the pesticide whether it is bad for you.  You need to know the EXACT pesticide combination being used, and ask the pediatrician.  But why worry about something you have no control over and may never happen?|`|Jq2K3N1Zaa	You should ask your pediatrician to be certain. |`|84a3f58bab9b254359c6da5c7fb80c7caa	Twice a week seems excessive for spraying. However, I'd ask the company for a list of the chemicals or MSDS (material safety data sheets) as they should be able to provide those.  Then bring that to your doctor for him to look at that and see what he/she thinks the risk is.  If there is- the damage has already been done by in utero exposure, but perhaps you can lessen the chances of any additional problems by reducing the exposure for the future.    Most places get sprayed once every 2-3 months.  I would try to get it sprayed a lot less since any chemical sprayed that often can't be good for any of you.|`|aVFBLv9eaa	yes it may cause cancer but the chances r one in a 1000 or so..pregnant women r adviced against d use of drugs as dese r teratogenic i.e can cause congenital malformations in d growing fetus.exposure to such things shud b minimized in future..dont fret everything will b fine..|`|AA11287657	I don't think it's a good idea to worry about something that may never happen - it will only lessen the quality of life for you and your children.   There are different pesticides used by different pest companies and apparently some aren't harmful - a pest controller needs a license to operate and must have in depth knowledge of the product he's working with - it seems fair to say he wouldn''t have told you to stay in the house if it was dangerous.   Try not to worry - if you can't - talk to your doctor about any possible signs of illness you could look out for in your children.  I'm sure you'll all be fine.  All the best.
6f3f1840626b7f8f4152f15766378d79aa	Aww you poor thing (and your man!)...    Well, if you're thinking about having children, I guess you don't want contraception, so here is what I recommend:    * Reflexology the week before period  * Lavender oil - rub on pressure points, temples, wrists, neck, pelvis  * Oil of evening primrose in bath. Also lavender.  * Homeopathy  * Traditional Chinese herbal medicine. Go to a herbal shop and tell the doctor your symptoms.  * Accupuncture  * Avoid alcohol and caffeine    Since you came off the pill over a year ago and if you don't have a clear plan of when you want to conceive, would it be worth going back on the combined pill? Yasmin is good for PMS.    **** EDIT ****    Just came across this page which give a variety of perspectives, plus a real pms website that can give more expert advice!!    http://www.guardian.co.uk/lifeandstyle/2...|`|bkh4MTWgaa	Prayer and meditation!!!  I'm hearing you sister!  I'm sorry you strugle.  I know that your trying to have a baby, there are certain anti anxiety meds you can take while your pregnant that will turn you around 180 degrees.  While my friend was pregnant she took Wellbutrin.  You might want to talk to your Dr about it.  I know how these "crazy times" can really effect your life. Last year I had a miscarrige, my husband brother killed himself and we lost all our money, in like 6 months, it was the worst of times.  I thought I was going to loose it.  My dr put me on Paxil and it really helped me, especially with my pms crazies.  Good luck
vB5cTqrzaa	It's a bit clique but...Cranberry juice, real fruit juice, no sugar added.  It really does help. (and finish ALL the anti-biotics).|`|il9PCkUtaa	go to the drug store and get azo. this will numb your urinary tract. will not cure a uti but will ease the discomfort. check with the pharmacist to make sure it is ok to use while pregnant|`|f1958dce4135a2864bf4bbbc09a66a86aa	Check with your doctor and see if you can take Azo products, they get rid of the pain really well. Azo standard is great and takes away the pain and inflammation. I would just recommend you check with your doctor first since you are pregnant. |`|T0EeOoNBaa	I had the same thing. I was not preg but they gave me a large dose of "ibuprofen 600mg". is that ok if you're preg?     you must drink **** loads in order to get the infection out. theres not much you can do, you have to pee in order to get it to go away and to wash the bacteria out.   sit on the loo and pee and skull about 5 litres (1litres is 4 glasses) of water nonstop. you'll be better in an hour if you do that, but you have to pee.    A cream wont work as the infection is about an inch inside your pee hole (not your vagina), so you can't get anything in there.|`|AA12273424	Well first of all, never stop the antibiotic and don't miss a day for when you take it. If you skip, it'll sting. Also, there is not much you can do. Its a UTI. They are there until the antibiotic takes care of it. But if its that bad, go get some cream or wipes at the store.|`|0b3623423afd94df4d0b1735f14fccccaa	There's a pill called AZO that will help. Don't get the cranberry pill, get the urinary tract pain relief pill. It will turn your pee orange, but should numb everything up pretty well. You can also ask your doctor for pyridium, which is basically the same thing except in a stronger dose. If you can, I would really recommend getting the prescription because that stuff is a life saver and you can save the leftover in case you get one again, and then you have some for the time before you get in to a doctor!    A warm bath with Aveeno oatmeal mix can help too.|`|GxVedV4faa	i would buy an over the counter cream. just put a little on the outside. wouldn't put anything on the inside without asking the doc first. |`|9fsBstvDaa	chamomile tea bag compresses on the area can help. cool bath soak in epsom salts ( check your doctor on this the high sodium can be contradicted during pregnancy)|`|IDiLLABVaa	you have aids. basically so if i were you i would pray because it might not have any good resualts 4 the way your baby may look our come out. im not being negitive but that is usually the case. if any my questions, ask me now.

Svgru3Tnaa	First of all, let me start out by saying how adorable I think it is that you are even asking this question. Its just goes to show how innocent you really are. Dont you ever worry about how big or small your breast are!! Who cares, ya know? Every size breast has its advatages and disadvatages. A lot of women look better with smaller breast. ( me being one...lol..seriously...lol) You cant base your looks or confidence on that...but in answer to your question....NO. It will NOT make your breast smaller or stop growing. Focusing on your breast WILL however put a road block on certain aspects of your self esteem though. So remember how beautiful you are and your self worth! Best wishes and goodluck, sweetheart!!!|`|Y0NAAPcLaa	no this is not gonna make your boobs smaller or stop growing.|`|n6zqu8gKaa	no this is not gonna make your boobs smaller or stop growing.|`|2dr0hoU0aa	makes ur boobies bigger but saggy|`|WC4XTU4Daa	Not at all.

k0EIC2kaaa	I hear ya.    I just finished college myself and went through (and I'm still going through) the same kind of existential crisis. There's no absolute answer to life. Working the 9-5 grind seems like a pretty dauntingly mundane prospect, but once you've been working for a while you'll get used to it. The substance of the work will become more important to you - it will become meaningful to you over time. I know that sounds hard to believe on your way out of college, but if you look around there are a lot of happy people out there. You could become one of them . People change.    Really, it's a matter of accepting all the arbitrary things in world, and not questioning things that just are. Personally, I find it very hard to do this, and I find myself question what might be. But this kind of thinking is pointless and futile. Life and existence are arbitrary, nominal and have no 'objective meaning'. Objective meaning can't exist, by definition. So don't bother trying to find it. Accept that some things can be fun, even if you don't understand why.    What makes you so sure that you don't want to be in a relationship? If you've never tried a vanilla milkshake, how do you if you like it, or want it? The same might go for relationships. At the risk of sounding cheesy: There is no other feeling like love. I won't elaborate on that, but I think you should accept that there's a chance that it's true. It's one of the most primal emotions, and that's not really surprising from an evolutionary perspective, considering that we homosapiens have been monogamous creatures for a very long time indeed. It's no wonder there's an obsession with pairing up. It feels good. You should try it. Don't question what the point in feeling good is. Just accept it. It's the only way.    Hope that helps.

You might think that your future dim but its not. There are some people that would Kill to be in your position. Your mother loves you and you wont notice that until you move out on your own.

God, the author of life, says:     "Let us hear the conclusion of the whole matter: Fear God, and keep his commandments: for this is the whole duty of man. For God shall bring every work into judgment, with every secret thing, whether it be good, or whether it be evil." (1)    Related to that, Jesus said, "And this is eternal life, that they may know You, the only true God, and Jesus Christ whom You have sent." (2)    He also said, "The thief does not come except to steal, and to kill, and to destroy. I have come that they may have life, and that they may have it more abundantly."

Calcium is very important in keeping bones healthy and strong.  Vitamin D helps the intestines absorb Calcium from food and also allows Calcium to be re-absorbed by the kidneys (as opposed to being excreted by them).  Even better than taking supplements is to eat a diet that's rich in calcium, particularly dark, green leafy vegetables.    User JJ7000:  Fosamax (alendronate sodium) is a prescription drug used to treat and reverse osteoporosis.  It is also not taken multiple times during the day; rather, it is usually taken once weekly.    User Devo:  While magnesium, along with calcium and vitamin D, is very important in maintaining healthy bones, magnesium has no effect on the absorption of calcium.  Vitamin D is what is needed to help absorb calcium.    User hotlavaflows2u:  Glucosamine/chondroitin is an herbal drug that is used to relieve symptoms of osteoarthritis, but does not work on the bone structure itself.  It also does not contain calcium.    I'm sorry to those of you who feel the need to "thumbs down" a correct answer.  I encourage you to do the research and see what you come up with.

OI3bf4yjaa	Break-through bleeding, or bleeding when you are not scheduled to bleed, is very common in the first 6 months of continuous birth control pill use. Your body is getting used to the constant level of hormones. Spotting is when the amount of blood is so tiny that no pad or tampon is needed. The longer you take the continuous pills the less bleeding and spotting will happen.    If you've been taking the pill for more than 6 months, there could be a slight chance of pregnancy. It wouldn't hurt to take a pregnancy test.    Good luck

QkMyhHkaaa	First, rule out pregnancy (this is not a judgement call).  According to a very good gynecological health book I have,  it reads (about irregular/missed cycles) that : It's not unusual to skip one or two periods a year; it is unusual to skip them more often than that, however. And... The number one cause of irregular or skipped periods is emotional stress. This book also has a chapter entitled WHAT IS NORMAL? which ads " That it's not uncommon for them (periods) to be irregular for the first few years." And, that few cycles are absolutely twenty-eight days. They can range. So long as you're menstruating every 20 to 40 days, it's a sign that you're ovulating.  All in all, if you have ANY concerns, it would be a good idea to see a gynocologist. These ARE the doctors that are the "specialist" in women's gynecologist issues. Even though, I have had a good male doctor gyno, alot of women (and girls) prefer to have a woman gyno and there is nothing wrong with that either.   Hope that helps.|`|qhIFSEKCaa	your fine :)|`|tP4Bx4OWaa	See a Dr .
9pLdhuBnaa	Stress regardless of whether the thing causing the stress is good or bad can sometimes cause this kind of bleeding (an example only).    I would recommend checking with your doctor as well to see what they say.

(stomach bug)    or    Influenza virus?    Influenza is airborne so the best thing to do would be to stay away from sick people.Build up your immune system by consuming foods and drinks rich with antioxidants.Take a multivitamin.Get enough rest.      If it is Norwalk virus, you can prevent it by practicing good hygiene.The only way to get the stomach bug is to INGEST the virus.It is not airborne unless you are standing right next to a vomiting person and you ingest the aerosolized vomit particles.    Wash your hands before touching your face, mouth, nose eyes etc. and before you prepare foods or eat.    Wash your hands with soap and warm water for at least 15-20 seconds.    Hand sanitizers will not work against this virus.    Any ill person should wash their hands after vomiting and going to the bathroom to prevent spreading the virus.|`|cb6121312f2438893949b988beee7e21aa	Keep your hands washed, make sure you use napkins to open and close doors.

Stay away from people you know who have the illness.  Boost your immune system by getting plenty of rest, eating healthy, drinking orange juice or cranberry juice with extra vitamin C.   
2sycPf8Daa	The depressed person or their family members may think that a change in mood or behavior is simply "a passing mood," and the person should just "snap out of it." But someone suffering from depression can not just "get over it." Depression is a medical illness that must be diagnosed and treated by trained professionals. Untreated, depression may last months or even years.    Almost all children have a birth certificate indicating the identity of their mother; however, for some children, the identity of the father is not clear.    You can open a case through the Division of Child Support Enforcement (DCSE). In order to open a case, you need to obtain an application at the local office,  There are certain situations in which the law presumes that someone is the father of a child. For example, when a child is born to a married couple, the law presumes that the husband is the father of the minor child. Likewise, once a man signs a written statement under oath indicating the man is the father, the law presumes he is the father. A conclusive presumption also arises when the parties undergo genetic testing (DNA tests) and the tests show a probability of paternity of 98% or higher. Paternity can also be accomplished by legally adopting a child.    Once paternity is established, the father has rights and responsibilities. Among his responsibilities, he may be obligated to provide financial support and health care coverage for his child(ren).    |`|Pjm9pg7iaa	Read William Styron's book about depression.

I assume he is going to school so he will not be out on the street, homeless, so you may have some leverage there to get him to comply with your wishes and his best interest.  Jail may not be a bad idea for him...     Have you considered reporting the Mother and maternal Grandmother?  Maybe foster care would be better for this child and future adoption?

THINK about how your actions will affect him. be supportive; don't think you know his life better than he does. as long as he gets a job and helps his baby out, he should be allowed to make less consequential decisions of his own accord. the sense of freedom and responsibility that gives him seems to be far more valuable in helping him than taking his pot and making him feel like a bad child. you are handling this horribly; no matter how filthy the mother's house is, they may have the right idea in getting your son and you out of their life. why do you ask yahoo answers firstly? and secondly,     WHY WOULD YOU EVEN THINK OF ASKING DOCTOR PHIL YOU RETARD. that really makes me wonder whether you have license to call him, his baby's mother and her mother 'bad'. what a clusterfuck. the apple doesn't fall far from the tree.

b876bdbe9593c6e05de8ebd41f870433aa	Have you seen the doctor about your stiffness?  Don't jump to conclusions about hip replacement quite yet.  What you need first is to get the cause of your pain & stiffness properly diagnosed by someone who knows what they are doing.  Even your primary care physician can diagnose osteoarthritis (which might be the cause of your pain).  A set of xrays would help a great deal.      I've had both hips replaced because of osteoarthritis but it took years for it to get bad enough for surgery.  There are several conservative things that can be tried to give relief from pain & stiffness before having to resort to major surgery.  See your doctor and find out what s/he thinks.     Incidentally, one of the conservative treatments for osteoarthritis can be physical therapy.  So you're on the right track in wanting an exercise program.  Your Dr. can prescribe a course of therapy and from that you will get an exercise program designed for you that you can follow on your own after the therapy is over.  I had this and it kept me going another couple of years.|`|UuuTpKLwaa	Exercising is never hip.

If you want to see the physical therapist again, make sure he tests the cortisone on his sphincter first, but make sure he lets you hold his pocket change...first. He'll turn a quarter into a pulsar with that thing. And tell Jambie Joynes his package will come first class though not like he wished; not: with a u strike the e-slew(!). I exercise t(w)oo, just like Pirms told me because God should mix well with the shadow boxers. But I'll still paint my onion bagel. Or have it in the den by 8:30. And I'll put the locusts in the dryer tomorrow night, I hope. But I mean I'll just say it twice.  D.L.S.

He has some claws though.|`|NzhtgOlJaa	To see if you'll need a replacement, you'll need to see an orthopaedic surgeon.  If your cartilage is wearing down, or you're bone on bone, you would most likely be a candidate for replacement.    You say you had bursitis.  The bursa are on the outside of the hip.  If this is where it is hurting you, it's not the joint itself at all.  It would be a soft tissue problem.    If you're having pain in your groin, that is your hip joint.  replacement is ultimately your decision, and one you should seek help to make.    Edited to add:  If the problem is truly your joint, no exercises will make it feel much better.  Once the bones are rubbing, they are grating on one another, and any movement will only irritate it.  Sorry to sound bleak.

iN0cyZoTaa	 I also have GERD. What you want to do is increase your amount of alkaline forming foods. Try to google the acid/alkaline diet. There's lots of helpful info there. You should be able to eat avocados. They are on the list of alkaline foods. Mainly to begin with you should be eating fresh fruits, vegetables, whole grains. Honey and soy products are ok too. Stay away from meats eggs, milk pasta, beans, poultry and sugary foods. Those are acidic. Citrus fruits have an alkalizing effect on the body so I always add lemon to my water. I no longer have to take those medications. And now I can eat pretty much anything I want. But I did stay on that alkaline diet for a couple of months to get my system back to a proper ph balance. If you like lemonade you might try making it with lemon and honey. I know it won't be quite the same, but your stomach will thank you for it. Hope I could help you a bit. Good luck.

oJQ1r4FGaa	  The single most important thing in losing weight (besides healthy eating...which is a given), is cardiovascular exercise, this is the only true sure fire way to lose weight, there are no ways to target weight loss, all that you can do is cardio and let your body decide where the fat comes offif you do enough of it then in time the fat will come offI promisebut it will not be easy and it will take time and hard work, the most common misconception of all is that if u do crunches and sit-ups you will lose that annoying stomach fat...WRONGyes it will strengthen your abdominals but no it will not burn the fat thereonly cardio can do that for you, so dont buy into these commercials trying to get you to waste your money on one of there machines    The best types of cardio are running and swimming, but other activities that get your heart rate up (and keep it there) are great toosuch as jumping rope or an intense bike ride (if you just go for a leisure cruise then you are wasting your time)    Cardio should be done as much as possible if you really want to accomplish a lotor just stay healthyit is different for everyone, but as a general rule thumb it should be done about 5 days per week for at least 20 minutesfor some it will be longerit really just depends on your capabilities and the intensity of your workout|`|oxhClqAWaa	 Just don't eat fast food or junk food exept once or twice a week and don't skip meals. 150's not that bad a weight.

AA11225694	Dry sockets, termed alveolar osteitis by dentists, are a fairly commonplace complication associated with having a tooth extracted. While the exact pathogenesis of dry sockets has not been thoroughly explained, their occurence is associated with a situation where the blood clot normally expected to occupy the extraction site and initiate its healing has instead been lost. The net result is that the healing of the socket becomes delayed.   The symptoms of a dry socket are pain, foul odor and foul taste emanating from the tooth extraction site. These symptoms characteristically do not appear until some days after the tooth has been removed. Clinical experience and dental research have identified a number of factors that seem to place dental patients at greater risk for experiencing dry sockets. If the dentist and dental patient keep these factors in mind when planning for and then proceeding with a tooth extraction they may help to minimize the risk for dry socket formation.     The use of analgesics (pain pills), either non-prescription or prescription, is typically not the most effective solution for controlling the pain and discomfort associated with dry sockets. In most cases the best treatment involves a dentist inserting a medicated dressing, daily if needed, into the dry socket. The idea is that this treatment dressing helps to control the level of pain the dental patient experiences until the (delayed) healing process is able to progress and resolve the symptoms of the dry socket  |`|Elxuvon8aa	sounds like you have a small piece of bone working its way out|`|6bb02259822110ffe8e4a6d8a5c09237aa	could be dry socket or the dentist could have left behind a piece of the tooth.

Dry sockets are extremely painful.       Dry socket (alveolar osteitis) is a dental condition that occurs when the blood clot at the site of a tooth extraction is dislodged, exposing underlying bone and nerves and causing increasing pain. It's the most common complication following tooth extractions, such as the removal of impacted wisdom teeth. But with proper postoperative dental care and avoidance of risk factors, dry socket often can be prevented. When it does occur, treatment usually provides immediate relief.|`|UTyIyKhaaa	ok take some adville to help the pain then go to the dentist. i mean when i had my molar pulled out my mom did it and nothing like that happened i mean it hurt like hell but the white crap stuff in the socket is kinda weird and never happened to me but even if u are scared of the dentist i would have that looked at cause i think it might be infected. |`|VrBERWfbaa	It could possibly be a dry socket. The white spot that you see could just be a bone spur that is trying to come out.

If not then the only person who will be able to help you is the dentist at that point. Did he give you a syringe to rinse out food and debris from the extraction site? Good Luck! 
AA11225694	Wisdom teeth used to serve a useful purpose, but are now considered vestigial organs. A vestige is a degenerative or imperfectly formed organ or structure having little or no utility, but in the earlier stage of development of a species performed a useful function. The reasons that wisdom teeth are now "outdated" are many. Until quite recently, our diet included mostly very coarse food, as well as impurities such as dirt and sand. This coarseness would abrade teeth so significantly that they would take up less space in the jaw. Permanent teeth were also frequently lost at an early age, which would create more space in the jaw. Because the diet was so coarse and hard to chew, the jaw itself would develop into a larger bone because of this constant workout. All of these factors would create more space for the wisdom teeth when they came in.    The heavily processed diet of today does not produce the tooth abrasion or jaw development that we used to see. Modern dentistry has pretty much eliminated significant loss of permanent teeth at an early age. This leaves us with too many teeth and not enough jaw. The wisdom teeth still develop as they always have, but they have no where to go. When this happens, the teeth are considered "impacted," meaning that they are not in normal position and function.      Impacted wisdom teeth    Besides serving no useful function, the impacted teeth will often cause damage because they cannot be cleaned properly and can collect food debris, bacteria and plaque around them. This can result in tooth decay, gum disease, infection and abscess of not only the wisdom teeth, but of the molars next door and of the surrounding gum tissue. The molars in front of the wisdom teeth are sometimes lost because of cavities and gum disease caused by the inability to clean the wisdom teeth properly. Cyst formation and other destructive pathology are also seen around impacted wisdom teeth.      Cavities caused by poor cleaning around wisdom teeth      Cyst forming around wisdom tooth    If removal of the wisdom teeth is indicated, the procedure is recommended in the late teenage years, before the roots are completely formed. Surgical procedures in general are better tolerated when one is young and healthy, and the gum tissues tend to heal better and more predictably when young. Most people experience minimal disruption of their normal routines, and time off from work or school is usually minimal.    |`|RiBLTcxkaa	"Anthropologists believe wisdom teeth, or the third set of molars, were the evolutionary answer to our ancestors early diet of coarse, rough food  like leaves, roots, nuts and meats  which required more chewing power and resulted in excessive wear of the teeth. The modern diet with its softer foods, along with marvels of modern technologies such as forks, spoons and knives, has made the need for wisdom teeth nonexistent. As a result, evolutionary biologists now classify wisdom teeth as vestigial organs, or body parts that have become function less due to evolution."    
KHVEK3aRaa	People freak out because it's their LEFT arm. The pain has to travel up your left arm, or concentrate along the length of your arm.    If it's just pain in your wrist, I'd say carpal tunnel, pulled muscle or a sprained wrist.      I very, very, very highly doubt you've had any of those. You also have to take in your age (Which you didn't state), your lifestyle, if you drink, smoke, if you're over or under weight and your diet (All of which you didn't mention), but I'm just going to assume you're an "average" person and say that you've got nothing to worry about.|`|FesTLIttaa	if u have these symptoms u should call 911  Sudden numbness or weakness of the face, arm or leg, especially on one side of the body   Sudden confusion, trouble speaking or understanding   Sudden trouble seeing in one or both eyes   Sudden trouble walking, dizziness, loss of balance or coordination   Sudden, severe headache with no known cause     otherwise if its only ur wrist maybe u twisted it wrong or something..switch between applying heat and cold, or put some icyhot on it|`|mZzJcYQBaa	I'm assuming you are young and female ?

It dosen't normally appear in an isolated place in the wrist area.  Also consistent severe pain in the left arm would probably be acccompanied by other heart-attack symptoms such as sweating, nausea, chest pain, faintness, diziness.  If you are experiencing one or more of these symptoms as well, PLEASE PHONE HOSPITAL NOW AND GET ADVICE.  You could well be experiencing RSI or Carpel Tunnel Syndrome or something entirely different.  See your doctor as soon as possible to find source of problem, and talk to them about your concerns regarding heart attack symptoms to relieve any worries you have.  Hope all goes well for you.

The purpose of cholesterol is to keep your cell walls fluid in the winter, and from melting in the summer.  It is also used to create certain fluids in the body like bile...in lay terms. Cholesterol comes in two ways, produced from our bodies (in the testes) and from our diet. One way to keep your cholesterol level in check is to watch the amount you eat.  Cut the cholesterol in your diet, cholesterol comes only from animal sources, so watch your dairy and meat consumption.      Second, since your body uses cholesterol to create bile, if you use bile, your body will take some of the excess cholesterol in your system to make more.  When you eat soluble fiber, bile is absorbed and digested, then expelled with your feces forcing your body to use cholesterol and make more bile.  Eating soluble fiber will help manage your cholesterol.

I tried all of the normal stuff that usually works - like a good meal, something with sugar (to help raise blood sugar), caffeine, another nap. None of it did much.    I had some blood work done and come to find out my iron levels were a bit low.  You can take a iron supplement (also known as ferrous sulfate) such as Feosol, Femiron, SlowFE, or a store brand and see if it works for you.  It's pretty safe and very inexpensive. I started with a 325mg tablet a day then was told that I could take as much as 3 day.  I started feeling better in a couple of days.  One (harmless) side effect is that it will make your stool very dark.      I feel great now. I hope this helps and I hope you feel better soon.
v0DuxDpAaa	"singing for my life"?    "I want to [smoke] though..."     Really?    How do you intend to be a great operatic singer while maintaining a smoking habit?    The answer is: yes, you will alter you voice. That is, with the addition to the many negative factors marijuana (drug or not to whomever is debating) and negative effects that cigarettes have on the body.     My suggestion is to prioritize yourself. If you have this "plan" there is no need for your question.     However, why the pressing need for a quick answer? Why scared? If in fact you have already smoked; do you want to hear that it will be fine?    -Not trying to be harsh bud. I can tell you to ease your mind that smoking once is not the worst thing you could do to your voice; but, I fail to see how it would increase your chances of singing at Carnegie Hall...|`|PD0lXVIKaa	God no.|`|yGXKYptjaa	Naw, not once, but you will sound a lot cooler to yourself and everyone else in the room,  Ha, ha.

There are many people that are smoking weed and cigarettes now that wish they hadn't taken that first puff.  |`|AA11287657	My advice is DON'T try marijuana.  I'm speaking as someone who:-  When they had their first try of it had a very frightening psychotic episode.  (No I am not permanently pshychotic - but it does happen - and more often then widely known).  Studies now show that the earlier a person starts regularly using marijuana (particularly from age 14 onwards) the higher chance they do have of becoming permanently psychotic - I know  three people that this happened to.  Even though I had a frightening first try of marijuana I then stupidly (I was only 16) went on to use it increasingly (to a point) of using it three times a day on average every day for a period of 6 years straight.  By this time I was so debilitated with paranoia, depression, social phobia and general dysfunction I wanted to commit suicide.  Ever since (20 years) I have been on and off anti-depressants and been treated by many different pshychologists and phsychiatrists for depression and anxiety.  It is so easy to become phsychologically addicted to marijuana.  And yes your voice will be ruined!  DON'T try it!.|`|hvdgnRmyaa	Ummm no...all it will do is make you really stupid for an hour or two.|`|AE1v4p6yaa	No, not ruined for life, if that's what you mean?  Initially your voice may get hoarse if you smoke a lot even the first time, but it'll go back to normal.|`|eybdDaHQaa	1st u have to Smoke pot like 2 or 3 times on different occasions before u get high if its your first time     2nd HELL NO|`|6yi6gteeaa	No. Pot is perfectly harmless. It will stop you from getting a job or bathing or doing anything for that matter. But the only long term affects are laziness and a bit of brain damage.  Really nothing to worry about. Just dont get addicted.   I used to smoke all the time when I was 16 17 18  Now Im 25 I dont even think about it. I know people in there 40s and 50s who still do it.   They are GIANT losers.  Its probably best if you dont do it.   But if you must. It really wont hurt you in any horrible body changing way. |`|9YkkQbbPaa	Once isn't going to mess up your voice. Even smoking weed every day won't ruin your voice.    However, if you smoke cigarettes, over time your voice will get worse/change.|`|41jcoHxhaa	LOL   Just once will NOT ruin you voice!  As a matter of fact, several GREAT singers are regular Marijuana smokers!  If you want to decrease any negative effects, use a water pipe or vaporizer...they will decrease the harshness on your throat.  But just 1 time.....def. no harm!!!!!!!  Enjoy, and have a good time!  Stay off the road!|`|k4wjFeLOaa	Its got its good and its bad of course pot is illegal and that is bad but while you increase your lung capasity you also expose your pipes to the heat with each hit. If you were to use some kind of icer it would be much safer. It will have minor negative affects but definately is not as horrible as Chonga and other users are making it seem. Though it does have more tar it is smoked in far smaller quanities so it is actually about three times better for the average pot smoker compared to the average ciggerarette smoker. The burn and the carbon are your only worries outside of the law. If you do choose to use do some cardio exersise or sumthing to keep your cardiovascular system working smoothly.

People with certain chronic medical conditions, within certain age groups, or who are in contact with sick people a lot (e.g., if you work in a hospital or nursing home or live with someone who has a serious medical condition like cancer) are going to benefit the most from getting a flu shot.    I've been getting these shots for the past 12 years.  I have worked in hospitals and also in large healthcare companies where a lot of people use the same kitchens, office machines and restrooms.  I also was diagnosed with asthma 2 years ago.  I find it very beneficial myself.    Perhaps you should check the CDC or your local health department's web site for information on the flu shot to see if you fit into one of the groups for whom the shot is recommended.|`|gSo4dR7oaa	I get a flu shot every year, and have not had the flu since I started getting the shot. (I do feel like I have a cold for about 5 days after I get the shot, but that's all.)  It may not be 100% effective for everyone, but at the very least, it could reduce the length and severity of symptoms if you do get the flu.     People who are allergic to anything in the shot should not get it, but otherwise, everyone should get flu shots! |`|qnxAN2t5aa	i get it every year because i am asthmatic and knock on wood, i don't really get the flu (i get sick but it's not the flu) but i know people who get it and still get the flu because there are many strains and the shot doesn't protect from all! |`|45PGkYldaa	I get it every year and not had flu. Still had some real nasty bugs though|`|uVy8yEjLaa	it is always better to get the flu shot than not.the cdc recommends that you do.|`|Rk46lIBwaa	It is very effective with minimal side effect risk, BUT it does depend on the educated guesses of the manufacturers in choosing the likeliest 3 flu strains likely to cause an epidemic 9 months BEFORE it is going to happen, in order to manufacture it in time to be used. This is no mean feat. This is why occasionally there is a variation between vaccines made by different companies. So far only once about 10 years ago, did they get it wrong and the vaccine used worldwide that year failed to cover the prevalent flu.     ( Good answer Beaver 40 though again you have been nobbled by the inexplicable thumbs down brigade, I apologise for that on behalf of the rest of the community. Don't be disheartened and do keen up the good work.)|`|MfBDN2mxaa	I got a letter this morning inviting me for a jab because I have asthma. I tend to get the flu once a year but it's normally a flu and sickness bug combined. The last one was at New Year! I am interested in having it done but I'm not sure if the jab gives you mild flu symptoms. That would make me re-consider.
k8G1ON2iaa	You don't have Separation Anxiety, as in, the disorder, but certainly what you are going through must be a difficult.  Especially if you and your sister are close, of course when she gets married, the reality is that the dynamics of your family are going to change.  The good news is that you mentioned that you think her fiance is a good person (which is a WHOLE lot better than HATING him, LOL!).  Here's what I would do:    1) Acknowledge that your feelings are real and valid, and maybe try talking to a counselor or some people that you trust to help you through this transition.  Although you will always be sisters, she IS going to need some time to adjust to being a wife as well.    2) If you haven't already, (and without "raining on your sister's parade during what is hopefully a very exciting time for her), have a heart-to-heart talk with her and let her know how happy you are for her, but that you just want to make sure your relationship remains close and that you love her and want to stay super-connected no matter what.     3) Then, just enjoy this process WITH her.  It may even make you closer as a result.  The two of you have a lot of wonderful experiences ahead to share as sisters and there will be times when she  needs you and not her husband to talk to. You will see that everything will balance out, and re-regulate itself once the dust settles...just give it time, and have a little faith in the relationship that you and your sister have established thus far.|`|e9406e2f0ff7ec0b1773553fe81f4e78aa	You're not losing her....You're gaining a brother-in-law! :)|`|HFNmkm3zaa	I have separation anxiety.

45PGkYldaa	Well the first thing is not to do or watch anything stimulating like an action movie before bed.  A book sometimes helps. Excercise earlier in the day is also good, as is a milky drink, warm bath or even meditaion. Try to rite down all the questions or worries you have so you are getting them out of your head.|`|ParFJxnSaa	 Exercise, but not within 2 hours of bedtime. Have a warm bath, or shower, an hour before bedtime, then a glass of very warm milk, possibly with Horlicks, or one of the herbal teas, below, and use dimmer lighting. Put your mind in a position where it wants to shut itself off, and sleep. See insomnia treatments, in much more detail than can be included here, in section 3, at ezy build, below. Use one of the relaxation methods, in bed, after lights out, on pages 2, 11, 2.c, or 2.i, but they can take some time to learn, (progressive muscular relaxation excepted, which would probably be best for you to try first) so learn and become proficient in their use during the day.    An alternative is to use the EFT, in section 53, and pages 2.q, and 2.o, saying to yourself: "Even though I currently have a sleep disorder, I deeply and completely accept myself." (or choose your own wording) while you use the acupressure tapping. Some more; quick, and easy to learn, are at http://www.umm.edu/sleep/relax_tech.htm The progressive muscle relaxation, (most easily learned) guided imagery, and mindfulness breathing are known to be effective.    Find out which works best for you, in the daylight hours, so you will be prepared, come bedtime. For many people, a good idea is to develop a set "wind down" routine for the last hour before bedtime, so your subconscious mind learns that it is time to put thinking aside, and prepare for mindfulness, (awareness, without cogitation/purposeful thought) or the EFT, in preparation for sleep, but the idea with mindfulness is to not even think about sleeping: just drift off, naturally, during exercising those techniques.    Avoid TV, computer, or anything exciting in this hour, although reading a BORING! book is a good idea. I suggest that you try using the EMDR variant, below, prior to the mindfulness, or the progressive muscular relaxation, but after the EFT, if that method is chosen. Experiment, to find which combination works best for you.     In section 3: INSOMNIA: PAGE O - INSOMNIA: A COMPREHENSIVE POST a variant of Eye Movement Desensitisation Reprocessing therapy is shown, which has been used successfully for those people suffering from insomnia, depression, Post Traumatic Stress Disorder, and anxiety. It is easily learned, quick to use, yet can be very effective; although it is easy to be dismissive of such a seemingly unusual technique, give it a good tryout, for at least a few weeks, to see if it is effective in your case. I learned it from a book by a published clinical psychologist, and now use it every night, and find it works well.    No coffee, tea, or other caffeine within 6 hrs of bedtime! Usually, I have a cup of chamomile herbal tea, an hour before bedtime, and employ many of the techniques in section 3. Others may prefer Sleepytime, by Celestial Seasonings, Relax, Be Sleepy, or valerian root, from supermarket tea, or health food aisles. Milk, or cream should not be used with herbal tea. http://www.ezy-build.net.nz/~shaneris   |`|AA11287657	Are you experiencing other problems such as fatigue, loss of interest in activities you usually enjoy, wanting to be isolated etc.  If so you may be suffering from depression.  I have been treated for depression on and off for many years and you are epxerienceing one of my major symptoms.  If not, and you are just suffering from anxiety or lifestyle-triggered insomnia here is a link below that may be helpful:-  PS. Alcohol is not the answer! It is actually a depressant and can add to overall feelings of anxiety.  Also if symptoms continue after self-help efforts please seek out a doctor :)|`|avPOt9Oeaa	I have found I need to have the tv on.  There is a timer so it turns off about an hour after I fall asleep.  It allows me to focus my mind on something, rather than allow it to run rampant with those thoughts you are talking about.  It is a way to distract my mind from going into overdrive when I lay down.  I have also found that if I do not get enough exercise in the day, my mind goes haywire at night.  I need the physical activity to help keep everything on an even keel.|`|kTWzbhWWaa	I think the above should answer your question.  Cant be more specific than that... :)|`|IbR9RJRyaa	This sounds like me! I have this same problem.  sometimes nothing works and i am just awake.    I have found that an old fashioned wind up clock with the loud ticky noise helps me - it distracts my mind sometimes.  Doing a word puzzle before bed time helps sometimes. I read someplace that completing a task before bed time helps the mind relax. That is why reading does not always work for me.    Writing down all the things you think you have to do might help - it has helped me to keep a planner. The old fashioned kind you write in.  LOL  Writing everything down and looking at it before I go to bed helps me get that stuff out of my mind.    And sometimes a couple glasses of wine helps too.  LOL
zse4pm0aaa	eating in just one big meal and one little meal is not healthy at all    you need to eat small servings of food every couple of hours  it keeps your metabolism going throughout the day so your burning fat a sculpting muscle all day.    i would eat a couple pieces of extra fruit for breakfast to get some needed vitamins and then a light snack between breakfast and lunch and lunch and dinner.   also you can eat as late as you want as long as you are up for at least another 3 hours  so the food can digest properly  that's why people say don't eat after 7 because most people go to bed around 10.     i hope this helped|`|d632a2671ff9a9f6ebef13b12aaf9b1eaa	Get a book called  "Extreme Fat Smash Diet" by Dr. Ian K.

VCUc4k70aa	Hello there. If you haven't already I suggest that you should try the herbal anti-eczema spray/cream combo from Champori.com  It works better than anything on my eczema and it is steroid- and allergen-free.  Try it. It comes with money back guarantee, too. so if it doesn't work for your daughter - it's free.  Best,  Bernadette|`|b9c206476271de6c0a321ebe042eb7f6aa	Might be something in her environment or diet.  Try eliminating things one at a time, e.g. take away all wool clothing for a couple of weeks.  If that doesn't help, give back the wool and take away the rayon.  Keep at it.    What I'm saying is that there may be something that she should be avoiding that you don't already have her avoiding.  It might even be sunlight.  http://allergies.about.com/od/urticariah...      |`|LNnRSLdtaa	get an intestive moisturiser and pile it on - wrap it in cling film |`|AA10020774	Have you gone to the doctors?

What I do is try to cut down on the celestone creams. When she starts to inflame, try plain vaseline at least 3-6 times a day. It's not a cure, however it does keep it at a minimum. What I have notice is using to much of the cream, it's almost like she becomes immune to it. I'm not sure whether you have dove soap there, I only use dove soap. When washing her clothes, bedding, and towels, I only use baby soap powder. Change her bedding often, like every 2-3 days. Don't bathe her every day. Cut down on the water on her skin. I bathe my daughter, depending on how bad it is, 2-3 times a week. I will wash her up everyday, but I minimize the amount of water and soap used on her skin.   If I can think of something else, I'll get back to you, but I hope this helps. If you have any question email me at courtney212@rocketmail.com.|`|BgOkiBRbaa	I have suffered from eczema all my life. It is now thought to be an auto-immune disease, which means there is nothing you can do to get rid of it completely, and even though avoiding allergens and eating properly can help, they are not guaranteed to. I wish I could give you a sort of magical cure for eczema, because I know it is a terrible thing to have to live with, and I usually only get minor outbreaks of it, nothing like what you've described your daughter as having, but, as far as I know, there is none.    Anyway, some advice. The multivitamins may be doing more harm than good. Often there are dyes and preservatives added to pills which can cause allergic reactions, or it's even possible that your daughter is sensitive to some of the vitamins and minerals in them. It's better, in my opinion, to look at your daughter's typical diet and figure out what might be missing from it, and then supplement it only with the vitamins and minerals you think she's missing, or at least take her off the vitamins until her eczema has somewhat cleared up.    Something you haven't mentioned using is antihistamines (Allegra, Reactin, etc.). If the eczema is exacerbated by an allergic reaction, an oral antihistamine might help. A dermatologist once told me that the best ones for eczema are not available in a non-drowsy variety, but I don't know if this would be true anymore. Someone else mentioned using a topical antihistamine like Calomine lotion, and this might also help, although it usually says on their packages not to use it on broken skin, so I would check with a doctor first.    As to all the creams and lotions, as you probably know, there can be allergens present in them. Common things added to skin creams which people are allergic to are aloe, lanolin, chamomile, and some others which I can't remember. It's really best to just avoid them altogether, at least until any major eczema outbreaks have cleared up. When my eczema gets really bad, I use only pure petroleum jelly (Vaseline). Make sure it's not scented.    The other thing to make sure is that you are not drying out the skin by excessively washing it. When you bathe your daughter, use only luke warm water, never hot, and limit bath time to a maximum of 10 minutes. Moisturize (with the petroleum jelly) as soon as she gets out of the tub. Avoid all soaps, shampoos, and conditioners, at least until the major outbreak clears up. If plain water is not enough to get your daughter clean, you can use baking soda to help clean her. In fact, I read somewhere that daily short, cool baths in baking soda and water is enormously helpful for eczema. Baking soda can help keep the itching down. I say this from experience, although, as far as I know, nothing will stop the itching altogether.    As with the soaps and shampoos, avoid washing your daughter's clothing and bedding in detergent, again at least until the major outbreak clears up. You can wash her clothes using just baking soda in the washing machine, and no detergent. Avoid fabric softener altogether for the time being.    Lastly, I have no idea what celestone or advantone is, but a cortisone cream can help. You will need to get a prescription for it. You can get the cortisone either mixed in a cream or in a jelly. I would recommend asking for the jelly, as I think I reacted to the cream they mixed it in. You will need to tell the doctor that you want the jelly, as it might not be offered otherwise.     One more thing to look for is mental health. I have heard that stress can really exacerbate eczema. Of course, once you're already itching and sore all the time, it's hard to be relaxed, but make sure your daughter is otherwise happy and healthy, and try to remove as many stressful situations from her life as you can, at least for now.    I wish I could be more helpful, but alas, I can't. If your doctor hasn't done so already, make sure he gets you a referral to a dermatologist.    Good luck!    Edit: I've thought of something else. Since you know she is allergic to dust mites, you probably already do this, but you should vacuum, preferably the whole house, but at the very least her bedroom, as often as possible, maybe even every day. Vacuum her furniture and books and knick knacks and stuff as well as the floor. Make sure she is well away from any areas of the house that are being vacuumed, as it will stir dust up into the air, and keep her away from those areas for at least an hour after vacuuming to let the dust have time to settle down. Limit the amount of stuffed toys and rugs she has in her bedroom, and don't allow pets in there. Vacuum her mattress once a month, and rent a wet vac at least twice a year and use it on her mattress, rugs, and any upholstered furniture. If she has curtains in her room, wash them every few months. You can also install an air purifier in her room.

One of the things that's important is body your fat percentage not just weight, don't worry about the scale but how healthy you feel and if you're in shape.    Second, when I was 9 I was a skinny short kid and when I was 10 I started getting really hungry and ate everything in sight. So I got a little fat and yes I started worrying about it too. But when I was 11 through 13 I grew 15 inches and it all straightened out because my body had just naturally been preparing to grow. I was actually underweight at the end of it, and had to gain some to be healthy again!    The moral of the story is that at your age unless your doctor thinks there is a problem you should be concerned with health and not pounds. Just eat lots of healthy foods (Like tasty fruits and all that) and less junk (some is not going to kill you, but practice moderation) and get a little exercise. If you have a healthy lifestyle your body will follow in it's own time and will actually be better in the long run.

But possibly short term on an anti depressant would get you over the hard part of this period.   I would also encourage you to do some type of physical activity and if you have benefits due you-apply for them. Feel free to email me if you'd like to chat at some point to get you over the tough times-remember we all have tough times and we all need friends to be able to share these times with. God Bless Reggie|`|yPnWc9mWaa	Doctors see patients asking for antidepressants every day. For them, its like a dentist hearing about a cavity. Its no big deal.    However, there are better answers for depression. Check out this website: http://www.mentalhealthsolutions.info/|`|mCpzcUiuaa	3 months is long enough for a Doctor to take you seriously.You are not moaning,you have an illness and the Doctor should understand this.  You need to claim benefits while you are not working just to tide you over,sort this out to get that weight of your mind.  Also explain to your family and friends that you are not feeling to good at the moment they may give you the support that you need.  Make an appointment,don't suffer in silence.|`|q1embGN6aa	well you could do what i did for adhd and thats just schedule a physical exam and when the doctor asks "so how have things been lately?" or somethin to  that affect or "has everything alright?" those are just examples but you know what i mean susualy they ask something about how you ve been and you should use that chance and say "well, ive been feeling really low for about 3 months now....." basically use the word well or something like it to transition into it and then just say what you said here make sure you dont end up discounting yourself in the end when they take you serious and say oh well its not that bad because it is that bad and you came in to get help|`|RQEEwej5aa	Say you are far too tired & unstimulated to get on with life & this has lasted 3 months & you must get help now, with a stimulating antidepressant like Prozac, as the current situation is useless. OR if your sleep is bad such you can't cope with insomnia (which a stimulating antidepressant might make worse) say you need a sedating antidepressant like mirtazapine that will help sleep as well as antidepressant action.  So you give simplest facts, diagnoses, & drug kind you want.  Plus say you need some other help to sort out benefit.  You are not presenting yourself as vulnerable but rather you give basic facts & conclusion in 40 words.  That is all you need to prepare to say - then just respond to questions naturally.|`|f8sUtNVGaa	Your physician should first rule out other causes for your signs and symptoms, especially thyroid dysfunction or anemia (there are many different types).  It's possible this is not a mental health issue; this may have an organic cause.    You should never be afraid to approach your physician with symptoms of fatigue.  Not all depressed states are caused by "mental illness."  Your physician will have your health history, and he/she will know what questions to ask.    It's also important to realize that, at age 26, your stage of psychosocial development is called "intimacy versus isolation."  If you do not feel successful in relationships (both work and personal), you can begin to feel isolated and depressed.  It sounds as if you cannot communicate effectively with your friends and family and are unable to express your feelings to them for fear of being vulnerable.  You may be isolating yourself, which is a very lonely place to be.    If your physician cannot find an organic cause for your fatigue, you may want to consider "talk therapy" before you consider antidepressants.  Everyone feels isolated, depressed, and unmotivated at some point in their lives, so you certainly aren't alone.|`|KfG4cv6Yaa	I am in pretty much the same state at the moment.  However, I personally have just a little light at the end of the tunnel, so I am going to ride it out.  It stems from a year ago, when my girlfriend left me for someone else, which I took very badly indeed.  I was so low then that I did go to the doctor.  It was pretty easy, actually, he listened and discussed in a pleasant manner the available options.  He had a few questions to make sure I wasn't just being melodramatic, then he let me chose counselling or anti-depressants.|`|AA12284245	how old are you? I was at tech at the time and had had depression badly for 2 years and eventually consulted a tutor because it was effectind my work as i was starting to become more and more aggoraphobic(i dont know if i spelt that right but ahh well) i didnt leave the house and cut myself off from everything and everyone and started fantacising about killing myself the moment i realised i needed help was when i was making dinner i for no reason put the knife to my neck and the harder i pressed it into my skin the better i felt i froze at that moment and threw it on the floor and cried that wasnt who i was . i was referred by my tutor to a counceller  you can just ring your doctor and say look i need help i think i may have depression and i need help with it .You may think its a hard thing to do but once youve done it theres a weight off you just go for it its helped me so much i cant tell you how much. Its not like the chicken pocks onece its gone its not always gone for good ive started to feel its effects again but with talking to someone you learn to deal with it also some people react well to prescription for it or herbal remedies that contain lithium lift your mood and unlike prescriptions theres less chance of addiction to the medications. i hope this was of some help.|`|026ccc37bd36bd551332232d59c0c4a2aa	I think that many people are in the same situation at present including me. At least you have family to turn to where I don't so my life is quite lonely really. I have suffered depression in the past and it is amazing just how the doctor does understand. Depending on the severity of the depression the doctor will listen and treat accordingly. Please do seek advice as it is worth it in the long run.|`|AA11085654	I first went to my doctor when my first counselor wanted me to find out if anything physical was causing my insomnia. Nothing physical was found. I went back to the counselor and ended up breaking down completely. I guess she is used to people trying to talk and cry at the same time.  The next day I got in to see my doctor and the nurse practitioner student did the depression evaluation. She spoke to the doctor and she came in the room too and asked me how I was feeling. After they had a quick consultation I was given a prescription.   You have to remember that doctors have seen and heard just about everything. What is helpful is writing things down. My counselor wrote my doctor's phone number, major depressive disorder, and the possible need of an antidepressant and gave me the paper so I wouldn't forget.  Write a note to your doctor. I bet he or she won't tell you that you sound like a moany cow.

LDZKwBGTaa	Where will you be working?    If you are working in an ER setting where you will have patients of all ages, you want one that has both the large and pediatric bells.    If you are working in the nursery, you need the neonatal stethoscope.    It doesn't matter if you are an LPN or RN.  A good stethoscope is a must.  I personally have the Cardiology Master III scope.  Expensive, but I love it.    |`|AA11132502	The best that you can afford would be the easy answer.  If you will be working in specific practices, you would want the one that had the best applications for that practice.  All of the Littmanns are good scopes, though.  If all you can afford is a less expensive model, continue through your RN--and gift yourself a really nice one!  Good luck!  Oh--and if you will be working with babies, I've never worked in a NICU or nursery that didn't provide their own stethoscopes for each bedside, so you wouldn't likely need your own.
RXSu3VNdaa	Hopefully it is not cancer. I am an oncology nurse, and It sounds more like an inflammatory allergic process  going on or an infected little gland. Is there and little lumps around it. Buy some non stick gauze pads to put in your bra to stop it from being irritated- you can get them at the drug store. I would go to a dermatologist- I know it is embarrasing but you can go to a female dermatologist. Meantime  buy the non stick gauze 4x4's to use and maybe it will heal up on its own if it is caused by anongoing cycle of irritation -healing- irritation...|`|wb2XE3j4aa	Holy crap girl, why havent you been to a doctor yet!?!

Even though it's likely to be more of a dermatological issue, it's never okay to take chances with the possibility.  If your doctor has dismissed breast cancer, you may want to use an dressing of some sort to allow it to heal without sticking to your bra.  Since you're only 16--please please please tell your mother and have her make an appointment for you today!  
L0NKywOwaa	I'd say between 140-160. You look FINE. :) You're sporty/athletic, and because of it your body is just all athletic muscle.

f1958dce4135a2864bf4bbbc09a66a86aa	I have chronic migraines and have had similar problems to the ones you are describing.   The thing about Ibuprofen is that the bottled doseage is about 1/3 of what a doctor would prescribe so taking a "bunch" is probably still safe as long as you haven't been experiencing much stomach pain. I would not recommend you take any more though because your body will begin to rely on them and a withdraw will actually cause more headaches. Right now a good thing to do would be to relax in a dark, quiet room with a cool towel on your head and a bottle of water. Drink lots of water. I read a study once that said that many migraines are triggered by dehydration.   You could also try masturbating...as odd as that sounds. When you come your body releases endorphins that help to relieve pain. Its worth a shot right? lol  Something that often works for me is caffine. When I feel a headache coming on I drink a doctor pepper or have a few cups of coffee and it usually takes the edge off or even gets rid of it all together.   If you are still having these same symptoms tomorrow I would recommend that you go see your doctor. They may recommend that you get a CAT scan, which more often than not shows nothing, or at least prescribe you a better pain medication ( like vicodine or midrin).   Try to get some sleep if you can, try something to get your mind off the pain, get off the computer, drink some water. I hope this helps!|`|c319c1f6090c4e43a1d95dd27b249dfeaa	Call me crazy, same thing happens to my right side of my head behind my eye.  after trips to the hospital and a CAT scan later, nothing,  I was frustrated!  I bought that Head ON migraine stuff.  I have 3 things of it.  Works great.  U just rub it on-me around my right eye and in my temple-5 mins later-gone.|`|jsiCuoKzaa	ICE and if this continues DO NOT take "a bunch" of anything. You can also try Valerian root, celery juice and having some one massage your scalp can help... If this doesn't do the trick see you MD|`|5AkOB6Jhaa	Go to a doctor! ASAP!!|`|ARSshUSfaa	Sounds like a migraine, which can be a sign of something serious. See a doctor, and don't take any more ibuprofen- it's very bad for your digestive system.
ABwnRvfAaa	If you're dry on the outside, you're probably dry on the inside.  Hydrate.  Drink lots of water.  Beyond that, avoid products.  They create a need for themselves.  The only thing you should use something without medication like Vaseline or Burt's Beeswax or the like.  Best wishes.|`|f1958dce4135a2864bf4bbbc09a66a86aa	I carry around a small container of Vaseline in my backpack. Whenever my lips start to feel chapped I put it on. It is the main ingredient of most lip balms etc anyway and it is really moisturizing. My lips get crazy chapped in the winter and this is the only thing that I have found that really helps. |`|azd5yf8faa	It is possible that it might just be from the weather.|`|LX5qZul2aa	Just use vaseline. Also lick your lips more than you would regularly.|`|rTkzJu1gaa	Burts Bees medicated lip balm.  Its the best chap stick for wintertime.  
nyJhBJOXaa	Hey  I'm 16 too and I'm in exactly the same position as you are. I have ugly stretch marks on my hips, the inside of my thighs and my breasts, and im not overweight either.  For a while I was just really depressed about it, because I am a very self concious person, but you have to realise that you are not the only person in this position. I am, and to tell the truth, so were half the people in my PE class, i realised the other day!!!  You can't get rid of them, [i wish] but you can reduce them to silvery marks which you can barely see. Try either- bio oil which is good but expensive or cocoa butter. Moisturiser every day and after a while you should start to see a difference.  Hope that helps =] xxx|`|DNt0eg4laa	Oh i have em too, worse on my thighs.   Ehm Bio oil or something is good to rub on them and they dim down someone said baby oil was good too lol|`|KVNtDoD8aa	stretch marks and ur problem is ....im a man i'm not over weight i have them as long as ur healthy ..you wait till u have kids ..your just dwelling on somthing which u can do nothing about unless ur gonna spend the rest of your life trying to hide them ..i have scars blemishes a long list of things which i think is wrong ..thats life no 1 said it was fair... welcome to the real world|`|xeW6Mvbdaa	My son had these...due to growth spurt, the doc said...they have faded greatly in about three years since they appeared...|`|f1958dce4135a2864bf4bbbc09a66a86aa	I wouldn't worry about the stretch marks, everyone gets them. If you are really bothered by them then there are some lotions that can help. They have vitamin E and cocoa butter and are formulated to help your skin heal and if you use it for long enough it will help fade stretch marks and scars.  My boyfriend used it for a few months and got good results. It is a gradual change so don't expect any fast results.    |`|AA12202661	Everyone has stretch marks. Its just caused by rapid growth so maybe your body shaped changed quite quickly (even over a few years) anyway you can get creams and lotions etc. Gok Wan (my hero) recommends Palmers stretch mark lotion. It costs about 7 xxx|`|5CyDFMC7aa	It's where your body has been growing the past few years. It can put strain on the skin which would cause the stretch marks.
f1958dce4135a2864bf4bbbc09a66a86aa	First of all, you should go to your doctor and you should talk to your mom. All women deal with yeast infections. You should go see your doctor to make sure that it is not something worse, like Vaginal Bacteriosis (a bacterial infection). It doesn't matter if you are sexually active, you can get a YI or a bacterial infection either way. If you insist on not going to the doctor and not talking to your mom then they sell test stuff for it at Walgreen's or at your local grocery store. They also sell Monostat yeast infection treatments. Don't treat it until you know what it is though so go see your doctor and/or talk to your mom!  Why wouldn't you want to talk to your mom about it? It isn't a taboo and she will probably be able to help you better than anyone online. |`|ec76af399c519dad926a10430304f541aa	yeast infections are not related to sex, your mom knows this, she has had plenty of her own, I guarantee you.  All you need is some Monistat cream from the drug store, follow the directions on the package.  |`|4b045bed7aeb597819a17cafdaf98978aa	Go to the drug store or Walmart and buy some Monistat, it will clear it up within a few days.  You'll find it in the feminine hygiene section with tampons and maxi pads.  It's okay to tell your Mom, it's not an STD...it happens for various reasons (tight pants, too many bubble baths, etc.).  Bacteria builds up especially when there's not enough "breathing room" down there.  Don't be embarrassed, it happens to most girls and/or women.  You can also buy generic, it works just the same.  You need this product to clear it up quickly....home remedies don't really get rid of it.    Why did I get a thumbs down?  You people have issues.|`|1i9mrq5Yaa	go get pounded|`|mAp90hEeaa	You can go to the drugstore and get some Monistat which is an over the counter treatment for a yeast infection.  Follow the directions exactly.  If you are still having symptoms a few days after treatment, then consider seeing your doctor.|`|gSo4dR7oaa	There are some creams you can get in the store without a prescription, such as Monastat, but if this is the first time you are having these symptoms, you should see a doctor, to make sure there is nothing else going on.    Talk to your mom.  Yeast infections are not an STD.  There are several possible causes, including taking antibiotics, and even some soaps and bubblebaths.|`|H8WqMK1eaa	Is there a discharge?    If so, what does it look like?  If it is like cottage cheese and the smell is like uncooked bread dough--it is likely you have a yeast infection.  There is an over-the-counter medication you can purchase at your local grocery store called Monistat.    However, if the discharge is thin, grayish, smells like fish, etc. you may have vaginitis---a bacterial infection.  That requires antibiotics.  And antibiotics can only be obtained with a prescription from a doctor.    Try to keep your vagina clean with just water.  No soaps.  Also, wear loose cotton shorts with no underwear to let it "air out" while you are at home.  When you have to wear underwear, make sure it is breathable cotton, and don't wear tight pants or shorts!  This may help.|`|ECQZitNwaa	drink a lot of water  doctors say if you drink enough water you should never get yeast infections  and you should really tell your mom|`|U8VGvgC1aa	Plain yogurt, possibly organic. Get a big tub of it.Eat the crap out of it! and I know this is super gross but you can even put it on the area before a bath. Also try a cortizone cream for the itching!  |`|77SMUuSIaa	usually u need antibiotics or fungal medicine but that comes from a doctor. it helps if u dont wash down there with very strong soap and the smelly ones because they kill bacteria that needs to be there and can cause irritation|`|AvD2r1Duaa	first apple cider vinegar douche then m0nistat|`|jbtH9djqaa	Well, I do recommend going to a doctor first.  But you can go to a drug store like Longs and buy the cream.  It's near the condoms and pregnancy tests.  Insert the cream right before you go to bed and wear full underwear because it will drip out.  You should feel better within a couple of days.  You can also go to Planned Parent Hood and get checked out.  At planned parent hood you don't need to tell you parents and it is free.  Good Luck!|`|swmpYCL1aa	Hi,    There are so many causes of yeast infections which is why so many people get them unfortunately! But there are ways of getting rid of it. When I first got it I went straight to the doctors and he suggested creams etc which got rid of it at first but it kept coming back no matter how many different products I tried.     In the end I did some research on the internet and found a website with a completely natural way to get rid of it for good and, touch wood, I haven't had it again since! I hope this works for you too!  If you want to give it a try you can find it at http://www.QuickYeastInfectionCure.com    Don't worry - I found a great cure and you will too!
fXWGItWvaa	you have to go see your MD you cant cure it your own or else its going to get worst sorry to inform you but you have to get it checked out! good luck and use condom|`|f1958dce4135a2864bf4bbbc09a66a86aa	Monistat comes in a box, you can get it at any grocery or drug store. If this is your first YI then you should probably go see a doctor, if you really don't want to go to one though then you should get the test strips and make sure it isn't something worse. Go to the monistat website if you need pictures.   http://www.monistat.com/
f1958dce4135a2864bf4bbbc09a66a86aa	It depends. Every woman has a different menstrual cycle. When I got my first period, I didn't get another for 3 months. For a really long time I was getting them every other month. Some signs that you are about to start are pain in your breasts, bloating, being abnormally irritable, vaginal discharge. In the meantime just be ready, put some pads in your backpack and keep an eye out for the signs. |`|mOarV5Q4aa	it may be like 2 months since you just started.|`|FM1DdVyqaa	A normal menstrual cycle occurs every 28 days, day one being the first day you start your period.  You may notice slight spotting of blood or feel like you have a little discharge trying to come out.  Near the 28th day, pay attention to the paper when you wipe, you should be able to notice a little bit of brownish colored blood when you are getting ready to start.  Good Luck!|`|a6e7SRYzaa	The average cycle for a period is every 28 days. But since this is your first period it will probably be off. When I had my first period I didn't get my second till 3 months after.|`|3RLJhubSaa	Since it's your first year, it could come back at any time, not just by month. The first year is always different.  Also, it could come back in just a few days for about 3 days.    You never know on your first year.    You'll start to notice the symptoms: pain in lower stomach area, but it's a little different for everyone.
f1958dce4135a2864bf4bbbc09a66a86aa	Yes, but as long as you are healthy and your doctor isn't worried about you, you should be fine. I'm 5'8", 150, 20 years old and I am well within a good weight range for my size. What matters is that you have good nutrition and eat a balanced diet. |`|AA11169206	Yeah that seems underweight for your height, you are quite tall.|`|fkfmSaZdaa	no, that's just sexy
kUE3Ddktaa	The first symptom of pancreatitis is usually nausea and vomiting. If your blood sugar is at a normal level, you probably don't have pancreatitis. You could be having heart trouble, though, and it would be worth going to the doctor to find out.|`|AA10922278	My son has pancreatitis. His symptoms are nausea and vomiting and stomach pains after eating. Blood tests showed elevated lipase and amylase levels.  The two most obvious to me having had both are gall bladder stones or heart problems. With the Type 2 diabetes I personally would suspect the latter. You need to get to a doctor and have some cardiac tests run.

jMfsFZ1Laa	Healthy snacks to eat on the run:    1)Fiber One bars (delicious, especially the chocolate and oats)  2)Kashi TLC Trailmix bars (my personal favorites)  3)Gnu Bars (have 12 grams of fiber in each one!)  4)handful of almonds or walnuts or pistachio nuts (already shelled, of course)  5)an apple cored and quartered and a little bit of peanut butter in a plastic container to dip it in.  6)grapes, or a box of raisins  7)string cheese or a wedge of Laughing Cow cheese, or an ounce of a hard cheese  8)low-fat popcorn in a baggie  9)baby carrots and a little hummus (in a plastic container)  10) a couple of those "Ones Prunes".  They're delicious!  11)dried fruit  12)whole-grain pretzels  13)whole-grain crackers w/ peanut butter or cheese  14)some cream cheese smeared on luncheon meat and then rolled up like a cigar  15)a piece of dark chocolate    Healthier school lunch options to pack and take:    1) Pack a little container of salad dressing and eat with raw veggies such as carrot and celery sticks, broccoli and cauliflower pieces, etc.  2) Instead of a cookie or other sweet item, pack a mixture of dried fruit, nuts, and coconut.  3) Add a few cubes of cheese or even string cheese for extra calcium.  4) Pack apples and pears that have been cored and sectioned to make eating easier.  5) Make extra salad at dinner and pack a small portion to eat with half a sandwich.  6) Take a small container of 1-2 tablespoons of peanut butter to smear on an apple or pear.  7) Take a wedge of Laughing Cow cheese and eat with veggies or whole-wheat crackers.  8) Make a sandwich with whole wheat tortilla instead of bread.  Fill it with veggies and some lean turkey.  9) Hot soup in a thermos.  10) Hard-boiled eggs  11) Yogurt with a little fruit and some granola or Kashi on top.  Good luck!|`|mPTBU0QDaa	The closer it is to just coming out of the ground, the better.    For example, fruits and veggies came directly from the ground. They are good for you.    Fruits packed in a syrupy sauce - not directly from the ground, not as good.    Hummus is really good - it's ground up chick peas / garbanzo beans.    Whole wheat anything is good.    Honestly, anything not processed and not full of sugar and fat is good! Eat it in moderation. I don't believe in avoiding bread or pasta or only eating fish as your meat. Eat a balanced diet, just eat foods that are natural and unprocessed.|`|AA11145682	apples  ham sandwhich  crackers  milk|`|cd74f10c72908fe61ee1500684d7f498aa	Stick with lean protein, fruits/veggies, whole grains, and low-fat dairy. Think lean deli meat sandwiches on whole wheat bread, wheat pasta with tomato sauce, string cheese, fat-free yogurt, celery with peanut butter, etc. Avoid mayo, oil, processed sugar/flour, and junk food. Good luck!|`|MOZNqtgCaa	PB & J sandwitch, or any kind of sandwitch that's not slathered in mayo. Whole grain breads are best.    Any kind of veggie or fruit. I like blueberries best :) Sliced cucumbers or zuccini or apple or banana, with some cheese or peanut butter.    Dried fruits, though they can be high in sugars.    Almonds, or any nut or seed. While they are high in calories, they have wonderful nutrients for your body.

wDtA9hrhaa	Yes it can be used as chocolate substitute. Swiss Miss Makes a diet hot coco that is only 25 calories and taste Excellent with stevia powder (a natural 0 calorie sweeter that acts as an antioxidant as well). It also taste great with soy milk or Sugar free vanilla Syrup (0calories) . I enjoy this treat every night and stops my cravings for snacks and sweets.|`|AA11112224	It's mostly lower because you combine it with water. Watch out for the ingredients in some hot chocolates though such as added sugar and high fructose corn syrup. If you want to go healthier, get the "no sugar added " or "sugar free" kind, and add Splenda to taste. I also use this as a "pick me up" with coffee. I put half the packet in my coffee to add flavor. Coffee is only a few calories as well, which is also a great option (as long as its the fresh brewed, the instant and coffee shop coffees can add things that add calories fast.)|`|aJvxMRSBaa	did you look at the serving size|`|xtH1JRBsaa	I learned recently that additional weight is not always due to additional body fat, a lot of unwanted weight is basically sitting around in the pipes. I tried a new diet supplement that is taking the population by storm, it rinses out the pipes.

There's a risk free trial at http://jugrass.esomnio.com|`|SlkgpPuHaa	You probably had lowfat or sugarfree or lite or something. Most likely the calories are right.
oVSjaF9baa	I used to be around that weight and a little shorter than you. I think I might be able to help.    Diet:    Breakfast: Don't eat a big meal. Try non-sugared cereal like cheerios, bran, total, or another whole-grain cereal with some fruit(it's been proved bananas are good in the morning. High potassium for energy and no fat) and a glass of juice or low-fat or skim(fat free) milk.    Lunch: A light deli sandwich such as turkey or ham. Anything that's lean really. On the sandwich put low-fat or reduced mayonnaise(if desired), the meat(in small quantities), tomatoes, lettuce, maybe some red onions. Try to avoid the cheese because it may be high in protein and calcium, but it also has fat. To drink, have a glass of  low-fat or skim milk or juice(opposite what you had for breakfast).    Afternoon Snack: A piece of fruit, a granola bar, or some vegetables such as carrot or celery sticks(no dip unless it's low-fat or fat-free).    Dinner: As for dinner there are a lot of options. I would suggest looking at www.FoodNetwork.com under the healthy foods categories(there are a few such as a heart healthy menu and a few others). Personally, I would recommend planning out meals in advance for dinner. Perhaps salmon one night. I happen to know a  good recipe and it's very simple. Take a fresh salmon fillet, peel the skin if there is any, and season it with the following: salt, black pepper, rosemary, and bay leaves. Then simply grill it.  If you don't like salmon, other fish are acceptable. Now assuming you can't have or don't like fish, www.FoodNetwork.com has a wida variety of different meals.    Excersize: Use the treadmill or the eliptical in your local gym every other day except when too sore. But don't over-exert yourself or you could hurt yourself. Pace yourself and drink plenty of water(I would recomend Propel, the fitness water) while working out and throught your day.    Good luck.|`|sGJ5kImDaa	DUDE im 5'8.5" and I weight 200 POUNDS!   dont even start that **** that you're overweight  overweight my ******* ***, youre in your perfect weight range|`|iQOqQGEpaa	u can start with running and jump rope =) and eat 3 times a day: one of your mean should be leafy. other darily products. drink green tea and water only. and apple!!!

Come on now, I am 5'9" and my perfect weight is 150.  Nice curves and I didn't look sick.  You should probably gain 10lbs and stop looking in the mirror so much.  Being tall is great because we don't look so bad when we gain a little.  You probably wear a size 6.  So stop complaining and ask us again how to lose weight when you get pregnant and gain 40lbs and hang onto 20lbs of it.      Sorry, not buyin the "i have a HUGE stomach" bullsh*t either. I out weigh you by 30lbs and am only 1 inch taller than you and I don't have a huge stomach.  Stop whining and go eat a sandwhich.|`|9iOjhq9eaa	anything aerobic like treadmill, jogging, biking|`|AA11124885	Your weight for your height is normal but if you want a slim look try one of The Firm workout DVD's.  Stretch marks on knees are from growth spurts in height, and will fade to absolutely nothing.  Toning muscle will give you the look you are seeking.  You can tone and firm without adding bulk.

As you continue to grow and mature they might eventually even out, but if not, don't be surprised and don't be upset.  Many many women have uneven breasts and are quite comfortable with it.  No one has to know but you and whomever you are intimate with, but trust me, the guy probably won't even notice unless you tell him.  Usually there isn't that much of a size difference.  Incidentally, most guys just think it's kind of cool.  Relax!

No disease, no anything.  If the dryness persists and become annoying then stop whacking off for a few week and it should get better.

DONT WRAP IT UP IN A NAPKIN BECAUSE YOU WILL THROW IT AWAY. I REPEAT YOU WILL THROW IT AWAY. DONT PUT IT IN YOUR POCKET BECAUSE IT WILL BRAKE.

Also your teeth will seem slimy and smooth because you are used to having the sharp metal on your teeth. Your teeth might also feel longer. But the only bad thing is that you will sort of have the taste of burnt plastic in your mouth. But that is because of the cement being drilled off.

aiBOMU9kaa	Well, the glasses aren't going to eliminate your astigmatism , all they do is help you see clearer.    If you need them now to see better, then you most likely always will.

I have astigmatism as well and use mine when I need to -e.g. watching TV or driving.

xXhuxyMkaa	HI Nicky you can use essential oils, but they need to be diluted: 50ml base oil+ 3-5 drops of aromatherapy oil. Use only natural oils, as synthetic oils are harmful.     Lavender and tea tree can be used undiluted, but you should make a patch test to see if you are sensitive/ allergic.    Oils can be used as compresses, room fragrances, for massage, to heal e.g. athlete's foot, to uplift, to calm... they can be used for very many things. Many infertile ladies have got help from aromatherapy : )    As aromatherapy oils are vibrational medicine, made of plant material, they can interfere with certain medications. If you are on medication, please consult a pro practitioner or doctor who knows about aromatherapy.     In pregnancy, don't use aromatherapy oils. The only oil that can be used, assuming your pregnancy is going well and you are not allergic and on any medication, is neroli, and that one only from the end of the second trimester on. Preferably, consult an aromatherapist/ holistic health therapist.    If you wish to know more, join http;//wholisticmagicalworld.ning.com/  and I will give you more guidance as I'm trained in aromatherapy, too.     Sariana, dipl. holistic health therapist|`|6NZeItMAaa	Essential oils should not be used directly on the skin, with the exceptionof lavender and vanilla. Essential oils should not be taken internally - they are for external use only. Lavender and chamomile are  how often dried and sold as teas.    However, the essential oils should not be taken orally. Aromatherapy oils are safe when used as directed. If you have a condition that is not clearing up after treatement with essential oil or if the problem is getting worse, see you doctor.    I don't know if this is what to want to know, hope it helped, ask again if you have more questions

I40iBJdHaa	hmmm, i don't know any girls that encourage guys to increase their size. i think it's really the people who create those products who are doing the encouraging. i had a boyfriend for over three years. his penis was about 3 inches. we still had great sex! i couldn't imagine telling him to do something to make himself bigger! i'm sure he knew he wasn't big, and that would have killed his ego for sure.  and about the girls doing something to make themselves tighter, a lot of girls do! even just the kegel exercises work, and now there are operations to tighten things up. .  i think that most of the men who get those enlargement pills do it because they feel insecure, not because their girlfriends told them to.  and for women, i think the only time things could actually get 'loose' is after they have children, then they may go for the operation.  i think it's really sad how size(of men and woman) have become such a huge thing, you know?|`|7yM2doGlaa	I have never heard a woman complain of the size of her partner  I've heard complaints about how the size was used though    2 inches might be better if he knew how to use it in a way pleasurable  to a woman insteadof an  8 inch male who is far oo rough for example    It's not the size, it's how it's used

Weightlifting itself- as well as the gradual increase in testosterone from working out- won't cause bones to fuse before you're done growing.      Developing breast tissue in men (gynecomastia) may be self-correcting in boys still undergoing puberty.  See if you can reduce the size through targeted weight lifting, aerobics, & diet.  This can help eliminate pseudo gynecomastia, which is fatty.  If that doesn't work, you may need medications like tamoxifen &/or surgery for true gynecomastia, which is glandular.

AFkjkqcSaa	Hi Ruby  At least you have been diagnosed.  My mam had cysts too that she didnt even know about until they burst.  Your periods maybe irregular and you may notice a change in your moods (not always the case however!)  Your doctor should be able to give you some sort of treatment for them, and u can have surgery to remove them if they cause you too much pain.  You are bit young to be going thru this, u will be fine tho. Gud luck
umRTXP2caa	All pills have different effects on women.    However, the pill i take is Apri and since going on it i've lost quite a bit of weight and my cup went from an A to a B (on the larger side).    That'd be my recomendation, but like i said, pills don't always work the same way for every girl|`|WZmx2oBzaa	Your best bet is exercise the pectoral muscles. This will make the boobs grow. You should exercise at least 3 times a week. There are various books and DVD's you can look at that will be helpful.|`|jcL7gDMKaa	Not that im aware of. Your breasts will swell as normal when you have your period but they shouldnt get any bigger normally. You can gain weight when coming off the pill.     I use Microgynon 30|`|7hAT9iLQaa	let me know if something works!!!!|`|by0hDP6baa	I guess it depends on your hormonal balance already but I've found I could lose weight on Microgynon 30 & my boobs stayed the same size while I went down a back size and my boobs felt alot um, fuller & firmer. I didn't gain weight & easily lost a stone while I was (and still am) on it. Dianette didn't seem to make a difference to my boobs, they just stayed the same & I lost weight but that was intentional.|`|fd86a2638e2a47fa0b12005b94499a32aa	There is no guarantee that going onto hormonal birth control will make your breasts bigger and I certainly hope this isnt the only reason you are considering this birth control option. The pill and other hormonal methods have a list of side effects a mile long, ranging from weight gain through to strokes, and as they suppress your normal cycles this can cover up certain aspects of your health and leave you unable to determine signs your body is given out about your sexual health. If you are still in your teens this is a particularly big concern as being unable to learn from your cycles means being unable to learn to care for your sexual health and spot fertility signs, which will effect your sexual health in the long-term. Hormonal birth control such as the pill should always be a last option for birth control or treatment of certain conditions such as endometriosis, using it for anything else is overkill where the benefits are far outweighed by the potential negative effects. I would certainly say that you at least need to do some basic research about such methods.     There is no exact science because everyone is different, each woman will have a different reaction to different types of pills and different brands, what works for one woman may not work for you, it may take you years to even find a brand that you can take without side effects, let alone find a brand that will increase your breast size. Due to the culture we have surrounding the use of the pill it means that doctors are often ignorant about different options and different effects of the pills, unable to determine the best pill brand to put you on or unwilling to accept your requests to change pills if you suffer side-effects. You will most likely be put on either the cheapest pill or the most popular pill rather than the pill best suited to you, from that you then have to be responsible for demanding different brands if whatever brand you are put on is not working for you. What works for one women is very unlikely to work for you too, so you will need to spend considerable time finding a brand yourself which works.     As for breast size, there is nothing wrong with barely filling out an A cup, there are far more important things than breast size, fact is that even if the pill does increase your breast size it would not be by much. If worried about the size of your breasts then the best thing is to stop worrying about them, if you are in your teens then accept that they will probably grow by the time you reach adulthood, otherwise your only options are those which have minimum effect such as breast enlargement exercises or gaining weight.

So I would say that it was safe to use, although I'm pretty sure you are supposed to do a skin test to see if you have a reaction to it. Then, after 24 hours and nothing has happened it will be OK for you to use it. Everybody's skin must react differently to it so it is always best to check.

Zwpagpubaa	Smoking will raise your heart rate.  I know it is hard to stop smoking.  If I lived in Iraq I would smoke a hell of a lot more than you smoke.  So I am congratulating you on all the more you smoke, being that you probably have a very stressful life.    Atenolol is an effective drug for lowering your heart rate.  That is what my daughter takes.  Have you ever tried any vagel maneuvers to lower your heart rate.  My daughters pediatric cardiologist said a head stand is the most effective maneuver to lower the heart rate.

NF252V79aa	Well that's why it's called a crash diet, it's a quick fix but not good for the long term. There's obviously no point persuading you to eat healthily, but try to eat a little at regular intervals throughout the day to get your metabolism working faster because it's probably slowed down from eating next to nothing.|`|WZmx2oBzaa	Crash diets are not usually healthy. You must eat to lose weight! You should be eating at least every 3 hours. Have a good breakfast as you have fasted all night while you sleep. Then have a nutritious snack. Have a bigger lunch, then snack later, For dinner eat a little lighter and a snack before bed.  You should be eating healthy food.By eating the way you have you are burning up muscle causing the weight loss. You don't want to do that. You want to eat healthy and exercise to build muscle and a strong body.  Sorry but your quick fix is not the answer. A change in lifestyle is the answer to be fit and healthy.

An idea is that you ASK and RESPECT the clients choices when you see if they want to do something ie have a bath or what time to get up or go to bed etc.  promoting well-being covers most of the activities of daily living  1) health and safety (are they a fall risk etc)  2) personal hygiene  3) Nutrition  4) elimination bladder  5)) Elimination Bowels  6) working and playing (do they enjoy socialising, family visits, hobbies)  7) Breathing (are they asthmatic do they have any airway problems etc)  8) Temperature control (are they able to communicate to you if hot or cold?)  9) communication (do they have speech problems, how do they communicate to you their personal preferences (choices)  10) Expressing sexuality (do they like perfume, aftershave.make up, etc    YOU support all these by helping them to do this be it in a big or small way.

mAp90hEeaa	You should be taking some tylenol or ibuprofen regularly as directed on the side of the box.  Continue gargling with the warm salt water.  Sipping on cold fluids would be appropriate but sometimes, hot liquids (tea) also feels good.  If you have a humidifier, you should be running it in your bedroom where you sleep.  And, when you mother gets home, consider going to an urgent care center and getting a strep test done to see if any antibiotics are needed.|`|5skL2HJxaa	I am not sure what you have, but taking ibuprofen should help.  It will help relieve the pain.  Ibuprofen is an anti inflammatory, so that should help with swelling.  Have you tried to place an ice pack on your neck?

Go to a quick care or urgent care clinic instead of a hospital (if you have one available where you live).       You can verify for yourself if you have strep throat.  It usually causes a fever and an extremely red throat.  Get a flashlight, stand in front of a mirror, and look at the back of your throat.  If you have strep throat, your throat will be cherry red and obviously inflamed.  If you don't see this inflammation, then you more likely have a viral infection that can't be treated.     Strep throat is a common complication of mono.|`|XjgQ3jDZaa	I did not believe it would ever work but Ibuprofen is the way to go.  It should at least make it bearable til you can see a doc

KGvGZfECaa	From what you've said, it doesn't exactly sound like your life is going great. Don't kid yourself about how your life is going, and how you feel.     For starters, how old are you? You said "if" you tell your parents. You need to try telling them before you automatically assume their response.     You sound like you might be battling an episode of depression. No one wants to be depressed. Its not your fault- remember that. There are numerous reasons someone can be battling depression.    I would suggest that you open up to your parents about your situation. If you are young, chances are your friends wont understand what you're going through and wont be able to offer much help to you in your time of need.    When did you notice yourself feeling sad and horrible? Was it a specific event? Did it come on suddenly for absolutely no reason at all? If it was an event that sparked your feelings, I would suggest counseling. If you have no earthly idea why you feel this way, it could very well be a chemical deficiency, or even genetics.    The best advice I can give to you, is firstly to tell your parents. Secondly, figure out what triggered your feelings (you might have to think very, very hard on this one).     No person deserves to be depressed- start by talking with your parents and hopefully you'll be able to figure it out from there either with them or a professional. Good luck.|`|3XWxs1ruaa	well thats what depression is, u dont know why u r upset but you are, how long has this been going on? if a long while then it might be it and you should talk to your school counselor they may help u and if u want they can help ur parents understand. if its just a week then maybe just hormones but if it lasts then get it checked out. im a teen  and i just got diagnosed with depression and am currently on medication for it. depression hurts, dont let it take over you cuz trust me if you dont get help soon it might get worse and worse but the minute. feel free to email me at anytime if u want. good luck hope this helped|`|xVuvk20caa	my mom is kind of like that and doesnt believe wen i have something wrong with me like that, you can easily be depressed and may need to see a doctor. im not an expert, but if ur always feeling this for no reason that isnt normal..im sorry, i hope you will get better! good luck friend.|`|YhfMrppSaa	They are stupid that's why they dont understand      Talk to a doctor      Best thought      No reason, is a good reason, lol.

Hospital doctors and nurses are predominantly youthful and healthy, and would thus be expected to be only lightly affected by a bout of the 'flu.  Also, one unstated "qualification" to be a health professional, is that you don't get ill very often.    Too, doctors and nurses have privileged access, if required, to the anti- flu antibiotics like Tamiflu.  Tamiflu is a good preventive medication (one tablet per day), as well as a good treatment, (two tablets per day.)  The UK government has stock-piled Tamiflu, but seems no hurry to give it out this year.    I hope this is of some help.    Best wishes,    Belliger  (retired uk GP)|`|AA10003191	In the US, the answer is virtually 100% yes.    The retired GP is a bit out of it.   1) Not everyone in healthcare is young & healthy  2) not every young & healthy person gets a mild case of the flu  3) even if they do, they can pass it on to patients (who are frequently old & not healthy)
82v0Oz3eaa	Codeine is an opiate that suppresses your central nervous system, so an overdose could cause you to go into respiratory or cardiac arrest, or go into a coma.  Amphetamine is a central nervous system stimulant that increases levels of neurotransmitters serotonin, dopamine and norepinephrine. At low levels, it does increase concentration, which is why it's used for ADHD. At high doses, it can cause tremors, irritability, difficulty concentrating, and addiction and an overdose could cause a psychotic episode known as amphetamine psychosis. Street drugs like speed and meth are amphetamines.   Don't mess around with either of them.|`|d503428496b7275f70c66859957bdd07aa	You could go into a coma and it could be fatal. Kind of like sleeping and not waking up.|`|jSKfz3R4aa	it ruins your kidneys, and can be fatal.
pRF5LLloaa	YES.    You COULD have had what is called a Psychosomatic Incident.  in other words, it IS "all in your head".    No, you are NOT imagining the pain.  It IS very very real.  but it is CAUSED by your stressful condition rather than a true physical illness.    Now, this assume that your DOCTOR has done all the proper checks and tests -- an EKG, a Cardio Stress Test, maybe an ultrasound (I just ahd one myself). You should also have your kidney functions checked, a blood cell count, and a hemoglobin test. All of THESE could affect your shortness of breath.    If all of these tests come back OK, then you are probably having stress-related problems.  So you need to talk with your medical doctor FIRST.  NEVER ignore chest pains!  At the very least, let the doctor (not your wife) tell you that nothing is wrong .    You need to clear up those stress-related problems as soon as possible.  You may need to see a psycholopgist/psychiatrist for deeper issues.
i0nlqfJVaa	Yes.
yqxAl7lOaa	First of all make sure that it is only fat,if that's the case then combine cardio with weights.If it is gyno ,then surgery is the only option.|`|erM2TCuWaa	you cant target where the fat comes from...    sorry and those exercises will tone your chest muscles :)|`|jKBDXgvZaa	Try a detox diet...you'll loose fat off of places you never even knew you had fat on!|`|8HzN5rhqaa	I've had the same problem.

o81jR8Wnaa	Clits vary a lot in size, but most of them are less than 2cm in length.  Of course, like penises, clitorises must become erect (by filling with blood) to reach their full size.

And there are she-males.|`|b8c32d57b4a1336f94b426a5879ff6f7aa	seen photos of extremly enlongated up to 4 inches, you can search it on yahoo web search
s6stLtvLaa	The condom is the most effective way to prevent the spread of HIV.  But, bear in mind it is not always 100%.  If the man is positive and the condom breaks on the woman then she is almost guaranteed a positive result.  However, if the condom breaks and the woman is positive then the man has smaller chance of getting the virus since it is harder for a woman to pass it on.      As for oral sex, there is still a chance you can get the virus that way, but your chances are low.  You would need an open wound in your mouth so the virus could get into your blood stream.  Otherwise the saliva in your mouth protects you from the virus and you stomach acid boils the virus away.
aaMM6Dc7aa	dude...you can do what you want because the pain really aint that bad of a dry socket...i had one for over a week before i had a "pouch" put in, goin through the tail end of it now. but if you are just wanting to get high then take one of your tylenol 3's or whatever he prescribed and just drinkin a few beers. i did nothing they told me not to do and still ended up with a dry socket but the risk of smoking will make a greater risk of getting one. any suction what so ever aint good that will unlodge the blood clot. good luck.|`|A8F4HF3Paa	If you need your girl to fill the bong so you can clear it, it might be time to cut down on the weed, bro.|`|t2R3mEMoaa	Of coarse it is. If you don't do what they tell you, you will end up with dry socket, and then you will have pain as you have not know before and no amount of pot will take it away, believe me!|`|z8WIAhDVaa	DUDE! Just don't smoke at all! and yes its bad!!! its bad anyways!!!!dont do it!|`|VE3TiHpTaa	Actually it is bad to smoke anything after a procedure like that not due to nicotine per say but it could result in 'dry socket'.And it is exactly what it sounds like. The smoke dries the area where the tooth was extracted and the result is VERY SEVERE PAIN. Also the sucking motion that takes place when smoking could dislodge the blood clot needed to assist in the healing process.|`|zihRP7Lbaa	smoking pot is bad|`|RoDjZKknaa	They give you these directions for a reason.  If you chose to ignore what they tell you then the consequences are your own.  I have been told that a dry socket is the worst tooth pain one can experience. Like an open door straight to the nerve.  There are other complications that can surface if you don't follow instructions.  Are you ready to take the risk?|`|AZwGAvtZaa	dude it's straight, I smoked a blunt and ate like 4 perks and was fellin like god. i smashed on some dairy queen later on too haha
GUOsn4BFaa	Sounds like a case of strep!  And, yes, technically you can get strep from eating your girlfriend out.  Our bodies are covered in antigens-- viruses, bacteria (strep is quite a common bacteria to find on the skin as well as staph), and in some cases even fungi (like athlete's foot) and parasites (like lice or scabies).  Usually our immune systems are resistant to a lot of the bacteria that lives on our skin, but upon occasion we can become over run with bacteria resulting in an infection.  If you've been, tired, stressed, eating poorly, and not sleeping well, these are all potential reasons why your immune system might have been too run down to fight off the strep that got into your mouth.  The doctor will likely prescribe an antibiotic like Penicillin, Amoxicillin, or Zithromax.  You should get a lot of bed rest over the next couple of days, gargle salt water, drink warm honey lemon tea, and suck on lozenges, keep hydrated (drink at least 64oz. of water a day).  Hope you get well!|`|DlogtBNqaa	if you can squeeze lemon drops into your mouth it'll be very effective , but only IF you can do it , as lemon is very sour.

AA10263208	Have a look at the head injury information links below. They are quite helpful.    Essentially, if your child has bumped her head fairly hard, it is normal to expect - headache, blurred vision, irritability, drowsiness, some nausea and maybe a vomit or two.    More importantly, observe her over time. Give her some pain relief (paracetamol / acetaminophen) or whatever you normally use for her if she has minor pains. If her symptoms get worse, then she probably needs to be reviewed by a doctor.

Sure, it's not comfortable, and the squoosh is awkward, but it's over quickly. I wouldn't say it's an inch thick. It's thicker than that, with the larger your breast, the thicker it is.|`|I8MUpN04aa	i have very large breasts, HHH, and there is no way that they can squish them down to an inch thick for the mammogram. i think they can only do that if you have very small boobs. don't worry about it, they only press them down according to the individual breast size. and it doesn't hurt at all, they never squish it that much.

rLsphyqhaa	Well at least he is not going into the kitchen and opening the refrigerator door and peeing in there. But seriously there could very well be a few thing going on, as for him walking into the bedroom door. If he came out of a room that was the light on and then turns it off and goes into a dark room his eyes may not have adjusted to the change, in other words night blindness. Try it some people are more pron to it than others. But we are not like cats. As for his urine stream, he could be PW(pussy wiped)he has been peeing down his leg so it would not wake you up. But on a serious note. Sometimes a guy will wake up with a morning wood and that makes it very difficult to pee, sometimes and he is at that age I guess were just passing urine becomes a problem, he would have to take some meds to help this. The only true way to find out is go see a urologist and let them do some test. I have had then stick a tube inside me and yes it went in the little whole I pee from, lucky they put some novacen so it would not hurt. It still felt like the was putting a light pole in there so women getting a pap smear don't have it so bad but then i never had one of those just heard about them and I know they can be VERY uncomfortable.    It does not mean he has prostate cancer but maybe he has what is called BPH or and enlarged prostate they have meds for it and they do help. I get up at least once and at times twice during the night and have now since i was about 35 and now 52.

dkoGI9nfaa	Anxiety is seated in one's lack of self confidence which comes from a low self image.  there are reasons why you think lowly of yourself and there is nobody better than yourself to identify these if you are honest with yourself.  So find those things you are good at.  Make a list.  Also find the things that interest you.  develop these and become very good at then.  there will be other people who share your interests.  It will boost your confidence if people ask your opinion.  A good starting place is the very site.  So try Answers.  You also need to find the things you are not good at and don't like.  You can in all probability avoid all those things you don't like but be sensible.  If there are things which are important which you are not good at you need to develop these so that you can b better at them.  Make a list so that you can monitor your progress.  Reward yourself when you achieve well and set further goals.  Good luck!

h4Sc2JDwaa	well im 18..5'0 and weight 120..im trying now to get off 10 pounds. i was 125-2 weeks ago and this is how i lost 5 pounds..  yogurt. yoplait lite has alot of tasty flavors that help curb cravings for ultra fattening foods. and with your water...i drink at least 15 8 oz's a day. but i bought a 32 oz water bottle with like a straw thingy so its so much easier that way.   i do not work out. i walked 3 miles today to start working out, but for that 5 pounds i didn't.   but like i said  WATER WATER WATER. all of your excess weight could just be water. you have to drink it to lose it. it sounds weird but its so true.|`|4cWtH7X2aa	It takes a deficit of 3500 calories to lose 1 lb of fat. If you created a deficit of 500 calories per day through diet and exercise you would lose apporximately one pound in a week. Every body is different and reacts differently to diets. Just try and eat healthier and keep up the exercise and you will see results eventually. Don't give up!|`|e9gXZsKxaa	I'm glad you are trying to live a better and healthier lifestyle. Okay losing about 2 lbs a week is healthy, anymore you are most likely just losing water weight. You can lose up to 8 lbs a month. To see results, you must workout for one hour a day, 5 times a week. Do both resistant training and cardio for best results. No sodas. 8 cups of water everyday.    Good Luck!|`|8SRjELNBaa	I use to be exactly like you, but i've got a plan... and im a dude. This is what i do, and it works (for me atleast).  I lose 3 lbs/week but my workouts are intense:    For breakfast and lunch;  1/4 cup dry oatmeal, nothing added to it. 75 calories.  5 egg whites, 17 calories each.  1 chicken tender = 50 calories (+/- 20 depending on how big it is)  2+ cups of water per meal      Dinner: Some sort of salad, light on the dressing, and a piece of chicken breast... grilled.  2+ cups of water.    For starters; Go for walks... walks walks walks! Drink water when your bored instead of snacks.  It feels weird at first drinking water, instead of munching on food.. But it's worth it & healthier.    Your whole goal is to stay active.  If you find yourself bored at all during the day, go for a walk.  Be Active.      I hope I've pointed you in a positive direction, good luck!|`|AA10717341	The worst thing you can do for your weight for the rest of your life is crash dieting!      Far better to be consistent with healthy food choices and regular exercise, than to try to lose 5 pounds in one week!  That will only wreck your metabolism and make it even harder to take/keep weight off in the future!    You should not plan to lose more than 1-2 pounds per week.  One pound= 3,500 calories or a deficit of 500 calories/day.  You can calculate how many calories you need based on your age and activity level and then reduce your intake and/or increase your activity.  Approximately1/2 calorie reduction and1/2 exercise general makes for a good balance.     Although drinking plenty of water will help you purge excess salt from overindulgence on chips and salty items during the Super Bowl, and it is healthy for you to drink plenty of water, don't think it will solve all of your problems either.

It also contains lots of information about diet and health.|`|uJKTR4d2aa	Good job for wanting to lose weight. You could lose those 5 in a week or 2 since the first will be water weight  mostly.

O.O yupz...|`|b698c36eb69ca7c1ee56cc564c80134aaa	Your period is due to start any day, so the activity is probably just giving it a kick start.  I would think you could find something smoother to use to masturbate, like a hair brush handle, candle, etc.  Markers are cut at angles and could scratch you.    best wishes..

AA11928403	I am sorry for your beloved child passed away.  My heart goes out for you.  I would answer the same way as you did.  It's the truth and you don't want to leave your deceased son out.  He is always your son and still lives in your heart and he will never go away.  If people ask any question and you don't want to answer then tell them your true feelings like, " I am not comfortable to talk about it right now."  Maybe sometimes you might want to talk about him to someone about good memories of course.  You can also answer, "I have 4 and one of them is in my heart now."|`|JpfECkjzaa	first of all, im sorry to hear that    but i would thnk the correct way would be to saay you have 3....well because she asked you "how many you have" not "had"    again im soo sorry to hear that|`|othezA6Caa	Tell them you feel uncomfortable answering this question. Don't answer it, or just tell them.|`|k2dO1dGBaa	i would mention him but when i say that my last child is no longer with us i would do it in a not horribly sad manor. like not making sad faces or looking like you want symphay. but always mention him when asked how many kids you have.|`|FrLDHBLfaa	Answer it in the way that feels right to you.  The answer you gave came from the heart and that's never wrong.      It's okay for them to not know what to say, and it's okay for them to feel a little awkward.  That's natural.  They just don't want to make it painful for you.

RvPuRmqAaa	One boiled egg has about 75 calories.     Information on the calories in almost any food can be found at http://caloriecount.about.com/calories-e...    As for how many calories you should be eating, if you plug in your stats (height, weight, age, activity level, etc) at this site http://www.dietitian.com/calcbody.php it will calculate how much you should be eating to maintain, lose or gain weight.    Both are wonderful resources that I used when I began exercising several years ago and I still refer to them from time to time. I've had great results and you will too.       All the best to you!

NeepH5Liaa	I have heard that HCG diet program works tremendously for losing weight. During the 3-6 week program a person will lose up to a pound of fat a day... without exercise.    The interesting part of this program is you won't feel hungry because your physiological hunger will be reduced dramatically back to a normal level and your metabolism will increase markedly (As I found in a website named Diet-hcg.com).There are many more benefits of this HCG program.     For this weight loss program to succeed it requires close medical monitoring. Dr. David Walters, DO, PhD (physician, reproductive endocrinologist) has used his HCG diet quick weight loss (Body Rejuvenation) program and successfully treated over 1,000 patients.  He has a website named Diet-hcg.com.     You can check this out to know his HCG program better and can use this to get rid of the extra weight you gained in a effective and quickest way.

Not muscular like, body builder arnold schwarzenegger type legs, but its nice to see some muscle there. It gives them a more defined shape and they are nice to feel because they are firm, not mushy.

The most important rule to remember if you want to gain weight is to eat more calories than you burn. Only by doing this can your body use the excess energy to build muscle. If you eat less than you burn, there is no way to gain weight, it's as simple as that. Your first step is to figure out how many calories your body burns per day. Use this calculator http://calorieneedscalculator.com  to get an estimate. Now eat more than you burn and you're on your way to gaining muscle.    Gaining weight is as simple as eat more than you burn but if you want to gain muscle, you also need to exercise. If you just ate more without lifting weights, you'd just gain fat and become unhealthy and overweight. When you lift weights (or participate in any strength training) you're actually causing some damage to your muscles.     When you rest, your body uses those extra calories to repair and rebuild the muscles. When this process is complete, the muscle is stronger and a bit bigger than it was before. You obviously won't notice a difference right away, but over time you will find yourself becoming stronger and bigger.    You need to keep your diet clean to gain the right kind of weight. Stay away from sugary and simple carb foods such as candy, foods made with white flour, soda and other junk. These foods will promote fat storage, something you don't need. Stick to foods made from whole wheat flour, oats, brown rice, lean sources of protein (chicken, some cuts of beef, fish), nuts, beans, legumes and protein shakes - yum yum. If you need more details, go to the Guide to Gaining Muscle -  http://straighthealth.com/pages/guides/g...|`|1ZZ2iemcaa	Follow a ballanced carbs/protien/fat diet....    but i always find that Whole Milk tends to help put on weight ( fat and muscle if ur working out) Has loads of Protien and fats..|`|AA11030313	lol i wish i could loose weight but to gain some weight just eat fat foods it worked for me !!! and eat foods with a lot of calories|`|qn0YNuLoaa	well maybe you should stop doing sports and like eat alot of junk food and yea maybe that will work but i am not sure or why don't you just stay the same it doesn't matter if your fat or skinny so yea don't gain weight your kool the way you are!

uuQrhnJ4aa	Counseling is in order. While it could be beneficial to have special outings for Nicole where she is the focus...the fact remains that she is attn seeking, taking out her anger on Jade, teasing her when her illness is plenty enough to deal with, & being downright mean.     This resentment on Nicole's part can fester for years...even if she learns how to play the part/or ppl & appears to be adjusted. Her resentment & anger can later resurface in full-blown violence twd Jade (either in teen years or decades later as an adult). When this happens, it's usually repressed anger and can explode w/a minimal provocation. This happens more than ppl realize.     Firstly, I would suggest family counseling, individual counseling, or both. You can also 'talk' Nicoles feelings through dolls or drawing (you're not being a therapist, you're simply listening to her & playing w/her). She will feel that she's the focus of attn & that she's being heard. It also acts as a pressure valve for her to playtalk about these things & you can then bring the issues up to the responsible adults in her life. Sometimes they think it's 'just a stage' that will be grown out of & do not seek counseling for a variety of reasons (cost, stigma, etc).     Since she's already showing such aggressive behavior I cannot emphasize enough the need for professional help. If they are in school even guidance counselors can help. Clergy. Charitable organizations. Social svcs & dept of mental health.     One source for Jade is to receive a listening ear from doctors. It's likely she's traumatized by her health circumstances & further injured by her sister's abusive behavior. This can negatively impact her recovery as well as her self-esteem throughout her life.     The parents must take responsibility for the girls' emotional/mental health in addition to their physical well being.|`|DVmDWDC4aa	I don't believe they need a psychologist at all.     I think it's perfectly simple to see what's going on, Nicole is left out because Jade is getting all the attention. Obviously, because she needs it - poor love.    To help out...hmm... well, I think if you could set a day once a week for example, to have some special time with Nicole, that would make her feel a bit special again, and have some personal time with someone listening to only her. Take her for walks, feed some ducks, play games - call it your special time.|`|4Dn7JRFWaa	It sounds like they need to let the child speak to a Child Psychologist, she is deff having some issues that need to be addressed before they get worse..|`|Wv592rOqaa	First of all children are not eggs or food and cannot be spoiled.  The problem starts with the parents of the children and that is where it has to be corrected.      Children need boundaries and adults have to assist in helping them learn these boundaries.  Each parent having only children should know that combining these girls would cause some reaction - just as a new baby causes emotional conflicts with siblings.  The parent have to guide and teach the children to blend, share, care and develop empathy for each other.      It sounds like the children have been given control and at their ages they would have temper outburst because they have no clue as to what to do with all the power their parents have given them.      In most cases well children will try to take care or sick children - but if the parents do not allow the healthy child to participate in the sick child's life - she has no way to understand what is happening to her step-sister - and therefore her needs appear to be selfish.      At this stage the parents should seek therapy and learn how to undo what they are responsible for creating - this is NOT the child's fault.    It can be undone and corrected but should not wait any longer.
rzue7CYuaa	you could probably lose up to 2kgs a week sorry in australia we don't do pounds so you'll have to work that out your self its probably about 4 pounds to you.|`|KppM3VzAaa	I wouldn't worry about the calories, there is no protein, if you want to lose fat you need to be eating protein.    depends on what you are eating    Get your weight in kgs. Multiply your kgs x 1.56, this will tell you the amount of protein in grammes you should be eating per day.    Also find out how many calories you burn (RMR -resting metabollic rate, men ave 2000 cals/day, women 1500).    Then eat the right amount of protein, reduce your calorie intake 500 below your RMR and research shows you will lose 2lbs of FAT per week.    Best to eat 4 - 6 small meals per day.    Exercise wise, you need to do 3 20 mins sessions per week. Choose your machine, running, rowing etc. Do 5 mins at a gentle pace, then up your pace each minute for the next 4 mins, repeat this cylce. Then the last 2 mins the gentle pace to warm down.

FaVYRoXqaa	Generally if you exercise (as in cardio AND resistance training), and lose the weight over a longer period, you won't have loose skin. Also, eat a variety of healthy foods and take a multivitamin. I lost almost 150 lbs and I only have a few barely noticeable stretch marks.|`|ebJ02QZJaa	How much lose skin you have depends on several factors, one of which is genetics and your overall normal skin tone.  Anything over a 60 pound weighloss is going to cause some loose skin and possibly noticable stretchmarks (even if you can't see them now).  A lot depends on how long you've been overweight, too.  Nothing will really prevent it.  Lotions and lifting weights are all myths.  Skin is skin and you can't do a thing about it unfortunately.  That doesn't mean you shouldn't lose weight, though.    Congrats on your weight loss.  Keep at it.  :)|`|xy4z8bQraa	lose it slow and use a lot of lotion.|`|AA10185901	Loose skin is usually due to drastic weight loss (through surgery) and happens most often in older people.  At 16 there is a very slim chance that you will have any loose skin at all.|`|qmslHwj3aa	I don't know if it will help lose skin but Bio-Oil will lessen stretch marks.|`|AA11548204	do a wide variety of toning and resistance workouts|`|fsSQrbjOaa	wow congrats on the weight loose:)what's  your secret?well you are not going to have a lot..you might have some but that is what's expected because you skin streched alot, but don't worry!|`|g3AdLLUPaa	using right lotion after and before gym
mqXyDTwwaa	Yes, it is. Flexibility is one of the three components of physical fitness. The other two are strength and endurance.|`|e9gXZsKxaa	It's means your flexible, that's it.|`|AA10185901	Simply put; no.  It is good to be flexible, however some of the most flexible people I know are also the most overweight.  Maintaining flexibility while doing strength and cardiovascular training is important but flexibility on its own is not an indicator of health.|`|qmslHwj3aa	Yeah flexibility is a main part of fitness.
qmslHwj3aa	I am currently using it and have been for 3 weeks.  With it as well as a good diet and excersice i have lost 10 lbs so far.
dA9Tcp8Qaa	?? I know EXACTLY how you feel.  I have a pair of goal pants too, and I'm lucky if I get them as high as you. I recently found this website,    www.sparkpeople.com    They have meal plans to help you eat decent. Good Luck. ??|`|xqOWI8VUaa	Plenty of healthy food like fruits and vegetables and if ur really serious about it then u should give up all the crappy junk foods, not so much carbs and plently of protiens from meats and such. Cardio and weight training (and if ur serious then i would say everyday).|`|HV7p36bkaa	You can loose your weight without any excersise but you have to eat only half of the meals that you  have normally|`|FYUHJyvpaa	Get rid of excess weight American dieticians recommend using the "water" diet, which is becoming increasingly popular in the West.    We found that with the shortage of body fluids is beginning to experience stress and sends signals to the brain, similar to signals of hunger.|`|ovi4hOpiaa	lmfao! wow you have time to make that video you should have plenty of time to exercise.|`|X5F7h3l4aa	The first and best way to burn fat is to modify your current diet.   There are three simple ways you can begin to modify: reduce calories, reduce sodium,   and reduce fat. For example, by substituting a glass of water for a carbonated beverage,   you can cut approximately 150 calories or more, depending on how much is consumed.   Even if it were fruit juice instead of water, you would still reduce calories by   approximately 50 - 100.     Excess sodium and sodium seasonings combined with fat can cause water retention.   For males, it is most noticeable in the abdominal area.   The thighs, hips, and buttocks are affected on females. But what causes these unwanted gains   in weight and bodyfat? There are three possible reasons this can happen:   (1) Eat late at night (2) Exceed your normal caloric intake (3) Lack of exercise or physical   activity.     Bottom line: If you break one of these rules, you will store body fat. The body's metabolism   basically goes into shutdown mode when you become inactive.   This inactivity causes calories to build up and ultimately produce excess and unwanted   bodyfat. When calories exceed normal levels, the "unused" surplus becomes bodyfat.   Lack of exercise limits metabolism speed. The metabolism must reach a certain speed in order   to burn fat.     The best way to speed up your metabolism   is through cardiovascular (using the heart) exercise. Weight training is perfectly fine,   but isn't needed to burn fat. It is best to do cardio on an empty stomach. Here's why:    Overnight during sleep, calories (mostly complex carbohydrates) are burned slowly.   By morning, blood sugar and carb levels low. This empty stomach training forces the body to   look for an alternate energy source. If carbs and blood sugar levels are low,   the body moves to its alternate source of energy which is fat.     The second best way to speed up the metabolism is by increasing meal frequency.   Instead of eating 2 - 3 meals per day, try eating 4 - 5 small meals per day, or 3 meals and   2 healthy snack meals. Food substitutions can help tremendously when trying to reduce   calories and speed up the metabolism.    good foods to eat are  leafy green vegetables, spinach, tomatoes, etc.    The remainder of your foods should be animal proteins and fats... poultry, beef, fish,   eggs, cheese... basically anything with protein and fat and no carbohydrates.|`|2soyTz7eaa	Well If you are really overweight I would suggest getting help from someone you are really comfortable around. The best way to lose is to have a partner so you can both help each other. Focus on cardio workouts. If you are concerned about dying when starting out....go see a docter and see what he recommends. Be carefull, you have to push your body and be dedicated.    Best of luck.!!!|`|QFrPpfr0aa	1. Jog at least 30 minutes a day. Everyday.  2. Dance for 30 minutes, (try belly dancing for a very sexy stomach).  3. Eat healthy, A great side dish; (chicken salad without the skin mixed with fruits or veggies of your choice), A great lofat desert; Cut up fruits with Vanilla lowfat yogurt dip.  Tip; See a snack you like? Go ahead and eat it! You can snack just DO NOT go overboard and pig out.  Tip; Get plenty of rest so you have more energy, which would help you not to slack on the workout routine.  I tried jogging/walking for a HOUR each day for a week and lost 15 pounds.  It was rewarding but I slacked off and now I can't get the routine back up and going again, so just start off little like 30 minutes of a day.  Either way you will see a HUGE difference in your body.   Hope this helps xx|`|4Dn7JRFWaa	I lost 35 lbs in 7 weeks by just counting calories not fat I stayed on 1200 calorie a day diet and didnt drink any pop I only drank skim milk water and sugar that I sweetened myself....its not that hard and well worth it lots of cereals are good for a sack like Special K and dont use beef try ground turkey the white meat one...I am still losing and it hasn't been hard at all|`|DYiQtwMJaa	i knew people that was worse than u but then become like models..really   ofcourse u should decrease ur eating and increase ur activities .but the most important thing to be strong enough to do it|`|YiY9Yd2Jaa	First you "wanna" learn the difference between loose & lose.|`|OUtYUT8daa	first. good on ya for WANTING to do it :D    Well all i can say i'd watch what you eat.   Eat properly and eat healthy good sized meals but dont go back for seconds or thirds.    Excersise every time youre feeling lousy or doing nothing.  Just crunches or push ups.  Go to the pool and swim laps. Start with about 20 laps and slowly each time you go start doing them faster and when you're good enough add more.     test yourself and have fun and feel good about it.   That's the key :P    If you feel good about it. It'll work XD  GOOD LUCK!|`|07vq1Y8iaa	Losing weight is all about calories. The human body is only capable of losing 2lbs a week of body-fat. When trying to lose weight you must try to eat between 300-600 calories below your maintenance levels. For example... Im a big guy and my Maintenance calorie levels are 2600 now in order for me to lose weight i have to eat 2100 calories. Now that i know how many calories i need to eat to lose weight slowly and safely i have to choose a diet with types of food that will all add up to 2100 calories...    But first you will need to calculate your Maintenance calories which is the amount of calories you need to maintain your body weight. You can easily do that in the following link http://yoursuperbody.com/A-Nutrition-die... and scroll down to the Calorie Counter and then click "Settings" then fill in your Weight and Age etc. Once you have completed that subtract somewhere between 300-500 calories from your Maintenance Calories and then begin using the Calorie Counter to work out what food and how much of it you can eat.    Good-luck  Any questions feel free to email me  Anthony|`|0ff2304aa58946a2151ca64e5d9e7cd9aa	Was this video you?  My late wife looked almost like that and I couldn't keep my hands off her.

fd86a2638e2a47fa0b12005b94499a32aa	Tampons cause cramps for most women because of how they affect the vagina, tampons are hugely unhealthy to the vagina, and an unhealthy vagina equates to unhealthy menstruation with problems like increased cramps and heavier flow common in tampon users. Tampons also expand, widthways they will add to bloating, but length-ways expanding tampons such as Tampax are a particular problem for some women as they expand into the cervix, which is already sensitive during menstruation, thus adding to or causing menstrual cramping.     A small but very important point  you ALWAYS have to worry about TSS and other tampon-related health problems, just because you use a lower absorbency does not mean youre not still at serious risk. TSS is only preventable if you use other menstrual options such as menstrual cups, softcups, pads, period belts, sponges, etc. many other options would also be more convenient, reliable, clean, easier to use and less likely to cause cramps as tampons.|`|cmoGATT9aa	if you're stressed or just not relaxed you cramp up.     use a small one, (find some vaseline or lube n put it on the tip to make the job a tad easier)    put 1 leg up on the toilet seat relax ur tummy muscels and breath out as you insert it.    having tense muscels makes it near impossible!    that should do the trick for sure.  if it doesnt work after that see ur doc    good luck xx

d08rkYlpaa	The guesses above are good, but since you say the pain is inside your clitoris, they miss the mark. Constant pain near the clitoris is called Clitorodynia. I think that it could be a symptom either of poor blood circulation or a damaged trunk nerve. The clitoris contains some erectile tissue which needs extra blood flow occasionally in order to survive - starving the tissue of oxygen and nutrients can cause tissue damage, including nerve damage. Nerve damage of this kind can be caused by herpes, but since you tested negative, it might be a repetitive tissue injury, like with carpal tunnel syndrome, possibly because of long periods of compression while sitting, arterial plaque, or an infection that you don't have any longer, but which caused some damage that hasn't healed properly.  Most doctors don't know much about Clitorodynia, so you should see a vulva specialist|`|jK9yiQq6aa	its ultra sensitivity. You get so aroused when you are touched that it actually hurts, only about 6% of women have this problem, basically this means no oral, however if it continues during intercourse pursue this issue with a doctor|`|GPvpBdlPaa	list down when is the pain occurring, what were you doing when it started and how long.... it could be u are super sensitive there that the friction from sex is causing the pain. but it could be there are lumps that are too small for you to feel, a gynecologist help is much needed.... if the pain is only when having sex, then try positions that will not compress the clitoris, try it side lying, dog style, whatever style where in you will not feel pain. it could be your style is ok but the frequency of sex is the problem.
TsjqzanQaa	First of all, you do not need to get circumcised.     There are other treatments for this, and circumcision is never necessary or desirable, as it is mutilation of the penis and it destroys sexual sensitivity.    You can stretch the foreskin, but it has to be done gently and slowly, as you can cause scars if you try too hard.    With the penis flaccid, insert both index fingers in the opening and pull in opposite directions, so as to widen the foreskin opening at the tightest point.      Don't do it so as to cause a lot of pain, just mild discomfort.      Do it several times per day.    It will take months to accomplish, not just weeks.    Should this not work, then you may need to get a preputioplasty, which is a small slit cut into the foreskin opening to facilitate normal retraction and mobility.    Doctors usually advise circumcision, as they make money from it and are very frequently members of the religions that try to impose this mutilation on all males.        If they don't offer a preputioplasty, they are biased, and just want to circumcise you, when it isn't necessary.    A preputioplasty is far less drastic than circumcision, it requires far less time to heal, and also doesn't amputate the foreskin with its thousands of nerve endings.    Circumcision is the worst hoax ever perpetrated on the male sex.|`|u8CFwtyMaa	This really depends on how bad it is, and how you have been stretching it.  If you have just been pulling it back, then that will take a long time.  Have you tried inserting a finger under the foreskin, and gently stretching it? Don't do it so that it hurts, as that can cause micro tears, and subsequent scaring. Do it in a hot bath - the hot water will help soften the skin.  If you have tried that, and it didn't work, then you may have to see the doctor.  Circumcision is the very last option, there are other procedures that can help. Don't leave it too long, as it may get worse as your penis grows.  Hope this helps|`|NXBmcEz7aa	See your doctor!  May be you will need  surgery, like circumcision.  Don't try to over stretched it, because it might cause more damaged to your penis.  Tell your father about  it and  he surely knows how to help you. Circumcision is not really painful and will almost return to normal  in about a week.|`|4arnbpUCaa	Have you been using the correct stretching techniques? The instructions on this website are the best:  http://www.geocities.com/restoremaine/ti...     If you haven't been seeing any improvement from the stretching then ask your doctor for a topical steroid cream to put on the tight foreskin. This will help loosen it.  Again, if the cream fails to help, ask your doctor about an operation called a preputioplasty. This is a simple procedure that relieves a tight foreskin without removing it completely like a circumcision would.    This website also has some more general advice:  http://www.norm-uk.org/circumcision_alte...|`|CNW6eAjoaa	You should follow the information in the links attached.  Stretching your foreskin should cure this problem.    You can also go to your doctor and ask for steroid cream that will loosen and relax the frenar band and dartos muscle that, along with the skin, make up your foreskin.  This is a very common cure as well.  In no way should you even consider circumcision.  If someone even suggests that, you can be very firm and say it is not an option.    Read about the methods and follow the stretches in the links and you will be fine.  If you have questions, please feel free to write to me.  Good luck|`|pzLDXL6gaa	You should probably be able to fix it at home: http://circresearch.googlepages.com/tigh...    Harriet|`|nQW1MSMpaa	See the example in the link, this is what bazjohn was talking about. Be GENTLE or you will cause tearing and micro scarring. Doing it in the bath or shower is good because of the warmth of the water and also using a good hand cream will also help - just a small amount.
wRtzGgRxaa	Vitamin C is thought to help boost the immune system, but the majority of your fluids (whether sick or healthy) should be water.|`|07YBD5mJaa	yes, drink plenty of water.

C is great, but a healthy body requires a whole range of vitamin and minerals. Because our diets these days don't usually provide us with sufficient vitamin and minerals most people take a supplement to make up for the deficiency.    feel better!    -Shamar|`|qlTNCCIsaa	Well, it's best to just drink water, but as the flu starts to get better, it's alright to drink some oj as well.|`|mZXZaJbEaa	do a lot of both it can't hurt. but also eat food with vit.

AA10717341	Yes.  It is called a TIA.  Although strokes at age 18 are extremely rare.  There are a number o things that could result in stroke, aneurysm, etc., including head trauma, some sort of defect, etc.  Although the symptoms you describe may or may not be the result of a stroke, it sounds like you need to seek medical attention right away!|`|kj507W26aa	Yes, its possible even at 18 yrs. old.  I saw a 20 yr. old girl this morning on that new show " The Doctors" and she had a stroke.  Its very important that you follow up with a doctor.  If you dont, it could cause major injury to other organs inside your body.|`|735a1fad9c8148cb945ff4708a253a00aa	It is unlikely to be a stroke at your age, but it is possible.  It could be from a virus or even studying with head bent forward from pressure on your neck.  You should get it checked out though.|`|hPdEZ4Ypaa	I suppose it's not impossible. Most strokes are 'feather' strokes and most go unnoticed. It could also be a side effect of a medication. If it happens again, I'd bring it to a doctor's attention.|`|buMDPzdAaa	im not sure, though that has happened to me before, but i never wen to the doctor for it. im only 15 at the moment. i do black out/pass out all the time tho. and i have been to the doc for that, but they dunoo why.  they are no help sometimes lol  maybe you should juist go see your doctor|`|xy4z8bQraa	ask your doc, if your really feard for the worst you woulndnt be on yahoo.|`|cj7yMrAiaa	Minor strokes can still be tested. Your motor skill unbalance is probably do to anxiety attack. Some things to consider is what and when have you ate and drank (if that is a word). Any excitement or being startled can sometimes create same feeling. I recommend seeing a doctor, just in case. Also does diabetes run in your family? All of these things can produce same symptoms. Again, see a doctor. Don't be afraid to bring it up, it could be serious.|`|AAaux2Ryaa	Yes it is, and your best bet is to get to a hospital.  If you did have a stroke and it's not treated, you can have permanent damage.|`|SiomJ10Saa	Yes, you can have a stroke at any age, and most strokes start small .. and progressively get worse with frequency    My cousin had a stroke when he was playing baseball when he was probably about 13     He was running to the next base and started acting weird, my uncle thought he was just screwing around and started yelling for him to run .. but then he looked towards him and half of his face way sagging down, and that side of his body was hanging as well    When you have a stroke of the left side of your brain for example, the right side of your body will be unable to work properly.  the facial muscles will often sag, you may lose function of one of your arms. walking may become difficult. an eyelid may droop      If you are very concerned then maybe you should make an appointment with a neurologist
Jdvr40Chaa	When I used to take the pill I sometimes had spotting if I forgot a pill or took it later than usual, and it would sometimes last for a long time, I have found that if you stop taking it and take the sugar pills so you have your period, then resume taking the pill again consistantly at the same time every day you shouldnt have a problem, I know this doesnt really help you as you probably dont want to be on your period in 4 days from now when you have sex with your boyfriend, its probably best to use a condom for now until you have this sorted.  If you still have spotting after you have had your next period perhaps you should see your doctor about trying a different birth control.|`|bKNa7FbDaa	I got that coninually when i went on birthcontrol.  be careful that it doesnt last....  i had to switch to brevinor-1 and now i dont know i its working or not.  goodluck =/

b959c1bacc75d8acf50a00e99fc88981aa	Fewer than you would.    The 'secret' of competition fitness is preparation. Because Nadal has played that forehand so often, his arm has become incredibly efficient at performing the movement. He can play many sets because each point costs him less energy than a less talented player would use.     Just like anybody else, his accuracy and judgement will deteriorate as he tires, but most other players will tire faster, because they are working harder.    It is difficult to calculate the calorie output needed for any particular activity, because your 'approach' can vary a lot. A leisurely game of recreational tennis might burn 350 Calories (kcal) per hour.    If you could play Rafa's style of tennis, it would probably cost you over 1,000 Calories an hour. But because of his efficiency,he is likely to be using less than 800, depending on the way the game's going.     At that level of competition, a player will often 'move up a gear', using a surge of testosterone and adrenaline to assist their capability. During this surge, extra energy is available, and the player's muscles and nerves are 'tuned up' to produce very efficient, accurate and well-timed movements. But this burst of 'overdrive' activity can leave the player exhausted when the adrenaline runs out.     If a gear-change is timed correctly, it will reduce the other player's confidence. Hormonally, their body feels extra tired and their strokes become erratic. As this happens, their playing requires more and more energy (more Calories), and their fuel is used up even more quickly.|`|YQYMPGK3aa	realy hard to say with 1 forehand.    but the total for a high intensity singles match id say well above 2000    probly around 3000-4000 in his finals match

Could it be stress and that you are more wanting to be out of the situation you are in rather than being gone.  I would suggest you talk to a counselor as something may come up that you aren't aware of.  If you really want to change this feeling you have to find out the real reason behind this feeling first and then work on that.  That needs to be done with a counselor.  Nobody will have the answer as to why you are feeling that way.  You have to get to what is behind it.

Nourishing, low, with a lot of fiber, it will help to quickly clear the body, long and still hunger for a month to get rid of the excess of three kilograms.

The human body is only capable of losing 2lbs a week of body-fat. When trying to lose weight you must try to eat between 300-600 calories below your maintenance levels. For example... Im a big guy and my Maintenance calorie levels are 2600 now in order for me to lose weight i have to eat 2100 calories. Now that i know how many calories i need to eat to lose weight slowly and safely i have to choose a diet with types of food that will all add up to 2100 calories...     But first you will need to calculate your Maintenance calories which is the amount of calories you need to maintain your body weight. You can easily do that in the following link http://www.yoursuperbody.com/A-Nutrition... and scroll down to the Calorie Counter and then click "Settings" then fill in your Weight and Age etc. Once you have completed that subtract somewhere between 300-500 calories from your Maintenance Calories and then begin using the Calorie Counter to work out what food and how much of it you can eat.

A second rash, measles-like in appearance, appears later in the disease. Infected people may have increased skin sensitivity and are very uncomfortable.  Other symptoms include:      * Headache      * Joint aches      * Muscle aches      * Nausea      * Swollen lymph nodes      * Vomiting

6be2cbfbb2702efaaac53f193f81f26eaa	This is normal.  After having a baby, your hormone levels change and therefore will affect the intensity of the side-effects of PMS.  Some women actually observe a decrease in side-effects.      To address your question, irritableness can be a result of an imbalance in your body caused by the birth.  This imbalance may be leveled out by a combination of taking birth control and daily vitamins.  Especially, vitamin B and E.  Centrum for women is a good start.  Try the vitamins for at least two weeks before your next menstrual cycle and observe the results.      Your irritability should decrease over time.  Remember though, your irritableness may also be caused, partly, by the new responsibilities (stress) that you have now with your new child.    If your symptoms don't decrease, you should talk to your OB/GYN.

K7x1RHVFaa	Acupuncture will not help or hurt her depression but it will help on her balance, her pain levels, several other problems that are making her feel so bad.     If you want to cure the depression, pay more attention to her so that she feels pampered and not a nuisance or a burden on others. This is not a criticism. It is a fact that people this age in similar conditions feel like they are burdens and simply want to let life end. You need to make life more interesting and death less of a solution to a problem that is not a problem at all but merely a condition.    Believe me this works.    Not to mention try and find people who have shared memories with her. the best way to hold on to your memory is to talk about it with people who were there back when.    I have done this with others and it works.    Good Luck.
GNQ70MEFaa	Create a routine that will act as a system of cues that will signal your body to go to sleep, i.e. brush your teeth, comb your hair back, etc., get in bed, go to sleep. Watching tv or leaving any lights on will keep you up, so make sure your room is dark before getting in bed. Your body has memory even for where you sit and sleep, so try to avoid watching tv in bed or your room altogether.

LCAzlHhEaa	Relax and take a deep breath, and begin stretching you need to be good and flexible for tryouts. I was on the dance team at my high school & for some reason during the tryout week I was always very very sore; but the rest of the year I had no problem.  I don't know names of stretches but I will try to describe them to you.    1. Stand with legs apart and lower down to one side i.e. your right side hold for 10-15 seconds then lower down to your left leg and hold.  then take your hands and interlock your fingers and try to touch the floor; in the center of your legs; hold for 10-15 seconds.    2. set down on the floor and make a V with your legs the wider the better.  Do the same as standing up lower down on your right leg; and bring your left arm up and over your head.  Try to hold your foot; hold for 10-15 sec and then do the other leg.  While still sitting in a V go down into the center of your V the further out you can go the better. hold.    3.  Straighten your legs out in front of you and lay down ontop of your legs trying to grab your feet DO NOT bend your knees, it's okay if you can't reach you feet at first hold.    4. Do the splits if possible first do the splits with you right leg in front and then lay down and grad your foot & hold; then do the other leg infront.    5.  Lay down on your back straighten out both legs; bring your right leg as close to your chest as you can; hold for 10-15 sec.  Lower leg and bring up the left leg as close to your chest as you can; hold.  Make sure to keep the leg you are bringing to your chest completely straight.    6. Other good stretches for limbering up your legs for such things as toe touches are making a V with arms and then kicking your right leg up for 15, then kick up your left leg for 15    These were the stretches we did as a group before practices...I maybe missing some but these will help with your flexibility.    Good Luck!

Stick with whole food proteins for now! Good luck in the ring|`|DOPQrfsLaa	Don't rely on supplements or food sources. I mean, food nutrition is good for you but the real helper you need is weight training. You can go to your nearest gym and get a membership to start weight training there. but dont work yourself too hard.|`|7pkxOc6Raa	You're a 110 pound 13 year old. You are not muscular and all that.      And yes, you can take whey protein...it comes from the process where milk is turned into cheese, it's what's left over from the process. Might as well ask if drinking milk or eating a steak if healthy for a 13 year old.    That Anokhi girl is...wrong. Apparently protein stunts your growth now? Good idea, avoid all protein sources like meats and dairy. Just eat cinnamon buns and Pringles all day, much better for your health.

Read this blog before trying Acai Berry!  http://acaiberryscams.wordpress.com/2008...  Thanks to this blog, it helped me a lot to choose the best.  I'm not a robot! I'm real viking!  Hope this helps :-)|`|yY2Czxy2aa	As far as I can tell, there are no proven weight loss benefits from the acai berry, juice, or capsules.    It does seem to be a great supplement (I take it, but don't sell the stuff!) and is full of anti oxidents, which help prevent damage to your body. But that's what you should take it for, not weight loss or fat burning.     The acai berry itself is an amazing thing - has a lot of anti oxidents etc and is really good for you.    But there's nothing really to suggest in scientific terms that it helps with weight loss.     And there are a lot of scams out there, be careful where you buy it from!    I take it, and I think I feel healthier and better. But it's not some type of magic formula, sorry.|`|2k5x2wzJaa	I have tried Acai by Genesis Today, which is a pure liquid concentrate.  I believe the benefits are awesome, healthy skin, cell protection, high antioxidants.  I have not tried the one you are talking about.  I work in my folks health food store and heard all the stories about Acai and I doubt most of them are true. The berry has true potential, but most companies are puffing it out to be the something that it is not.  If you are to by some go with a trusted company that has been in the health field for some years.  Like most things, if there is money to be made off it, then yes more and more companies will try what ever they can to sell it.  Brands that I would recommend are Genesis Today, Navitas Naturals, Doctor's Best, Natures Way.|`|kx0QteQpaa	Not really sure what I would recommend to you specifically. Its difficult to pick so what I end up doing is starting with the less expensive and trying out several trials and seeing the results.This is a good website at http://www.pure-acai-berry.saverightnow.... visit and see if it interests you, I did.|`|76075de38faee453846c87739c1ee336aa	i think acai edge is a scam.  u should try acai berry pure.  it has worked fine for me.  and ive lost about 10 lbs!
kdSuwt8paa	If your doctor has found no underlying problem try taking Mintec.    It is really effective and after a few days you find you can stop taking it for a while.

ezI5HwRWaa	I've been like that before.    In fact I still like my sad music and writing dark music. I've stopped the cutting. Don't do that, please. It won't help at all. Listen to sad music if you want but cutting is doing physical harm to your body. You don't cut often but you don't want that to become a habbit or something to start to do when you're actually sad, because then you will be more likely to do it often and hurt yourself more.    I think you're just used to it. You don't like being sad, but you kind of enjoy it and don't want to leave it. It inspires you and you feel like yourself then. Doing it sometimes is ok but not all the time. Keep writing. It really is a great way to get things out.     Write when you are depressed instead of doing nothing about it. Then try to get out of that slump. Don't just sit in it. It's teaching you to get used to it to where you are. I still "enjoy" being sad sometimes because it helps me to express myself.    I'd say nothing is really wrong with you, but you should try and change things a little if they are affecting your life, friends, and family. Your family obviously doesn't like it. At least make an attempt to stop the self injury.|`|nRFZwdN4aa	You must suffer from a different kind of depression than some people, whose depression completely halts daily living to the point where you have no energy to do anything......it is so painful that you would do anything to get out of it, well almost anything.     You clearly have the energy to create art, which is good. DEPRESSED PEOPLE ARE OFTEN TERRIFIC WRITERS! Don't stop writing....i love melancholic writing....it is often far more interesting than 'happy' writing (but that's just me).     You do need help if you don't feel right and for your cutting. Google 'impulse control disorder', because that's the category that cutting falls under, and habit reversal training is supposed to alleviate the symptoms.|`|IKbKx9gyaa	everyone is different. your interest in "sad" things is sounds normal.   although i don't think you're sick, you should definitely stop cutting yourself. that's a bit abnormal.|`|K5pUbkbkaa	I'm assuming you like it because it validates you. Because you love being helpless, being the victim, having an excuse not to better yourself. You blame your condition for your failures and therefore excuse every flaw you find in yourself. Because you confuse melancholia with contemplation, expression with passion and feeling with depth.    Because - I'm assuming - being depressed makes you feel like a blameless, beautiful snowflake. Getting better means taking responsibility for yourself, means writing stories or creating artworks with whole new themes - themes you probably suck at expressing. Do you feel you're only good at creating works that express your 'pain'? That's because you lack range. You haven't practiced writing other material, so it requires much more work, so you don't. And then you blame it on your illness.    A flattering picture? Not at all. Accurate? You tell me.|`|cj7CYD9haa	Well this is normal for depressed people. You should get Anti depressants.    Your depression is like a blanket it keeps you "safe"|`|kPG2g4iSaa	The reason you like being depressed is because ... you're not depressed. Anybody who has ever been clinically depressed will tell you there is nothing to like about it, including yours truly. It is an absolute living hell. You probably just like the *idea* of being depressed much like adolescent males throughout history liked the *idea* of fighting in a war. The reality, in both instances, is far uglier.    No, you're not sick. You're just young. You'll grow out of it.

I wouldn't smoke weed the day of your surgery (it might make you eat when you need an empty stomach), but before it shouldn't cause any problems.  I had surgery on both my eyes a while back, and I was puffin away before I went in (not the day of) and had not a single complication.    It really shouldn't have any noticeable effect on recovery/healing time.|`|nGwQi5Yoaa	nothing to worry about just make sure you don't get the munchies and eat beforehand and puke everywhere when your passed out|`|8WP9Gu1saa	Depending on your tolerance, consuming a joint before surgery will make you numb to the pain, maybe there is no need for anesthesia.

dA9Tcp8Qaa	?? Diet pills are a false image. The other day I saw this diet pill on display with a saying of 'A women's way to lose weight.' I couldn't believe how insulting that was. Diet pills just mess up your system. And they don't do anything. If you expect a quick fix, you won't help yourself at all. Being fit and healthy is a lifestyle change. You have to change the way you eat and your activity level to get where you want to go.     www.sparkpeople.com    This site might be able to help you. Good Luck. ??|`|mqXyDTwwaa	It depends on the diet pill. Some diet pills increase your metabolism, which helps burn fat. Some diet pills decrease your appetite, which helps you eat less. Some diet pills stops you from digesting some of the fat you eat, or some of the carbohydrates you eat, which means you absorb less calories. Some diet pills are a scam, and they don't do anything at all, like acai berry pills, or wu yi tea.|`|4UwFOW39aa	Actually, you don't have to diet as such if you want to lose weight, the sole diet that clearly delivered for me was wu-yi tea, it can be viewed in the resource box below, they have a few free trials left, it has been reported in Fox News and CNN.

This figure applies  to healthy, well-fed and well-trained individuals. Like all fitness guides (including food calorie scores), it is a rough guide. Each organ uses energy differently; for example, your liver uses a lot of energy because a lot of 'metabolic processes' happen there. 'Adipose' (fat storage) cells mainly use energy when they are storing and releasing fat, so they are often pretty inactive and burning almost no fuel at all.    Muscle fibres are the most 'metabolically active' part of your body - when you are moving about. Even when you are relaxing, your muscles need to burn quite a bit of fuel just for maintenance, but unfit, untrained, floppy and weak muscles need very little energy to survive.    Fit, active muscles can burn an awesome amount of fuel while they are resting. But every time you stand up and move about, their fuel use will increase massively.    During fasting, your body will try to conserve energy in every way possible. Muscle tissue is disposed of (NOT burnt for fuel) so that it's not using up energy, and the longer you fast, the more muscle you will lose. This strategy can quickly and dramatically reduce the number of calories your body needs for survival.

07vq1Y8iaa	its not bad.. but its not a good rate of weightloss  Losing weight is all about calories. The human body is only capable of losing 2lbs a week of body-fat. When trying to lose weight you must try to eat between 300-600 calories below your maintenance levels. For example... Im a big guy and my Maintenance calorie levels are 2600 now in order for me to lose weight i have to eat 2100 calories. Now that i know how many calories i need to eat to lose weight slowly and safely i have to choose a diet with types of food that will all add up to 2100 calories...    But first you will need to calculate your Maintenance calories which is the amount of calories you need to maintain your body weight. You can easily do that in the following link http://yoursuperbody.com/A-Nutrition-die... and scroll down to the Calorie Counter and then click "Settings" then fill in your Weight and Age etc. Once you have completed that subtract somewhere between 300-500 calories from your Maintenance Calories and then begin using the Calorie Counter to work out what food and how much of it you can eat.    Good-luck  Any questions feel free to email me  Anthony|`|Mcr4IS6Vaa	Yeah, you definetely need to lose weight. I'm 174cm and I weigh 50kg!

ItJzrvQ4aa	When  you are losing  weight,  you should exercise and diet  together.  If  you exercise without dieting, you will get bigger appetite,  which  will  lead  to  increase  of  weight, or muscle grow  underneath  the  fat  layer, and make you bulkier. If you diet without  exercising,  you  will  become  flabby  and will have excess skin. For  diet,  go  wheat  free.  No pasta, pizza, bread and so on. And no food  after  7  p.m. People achieve marvellous results with it. Depending on  your  initial  weight, you can drop upwards from 20 pounds a month. If  you  don't  eat  wheat then you don't eat all those sticky, fatty goey  cakes,  you  don't eat junk food, and you don't eat biscuits. But your  diet  is  still  balanced.  It  costs  nothing, and you do not have to  calculate  points  or  to  buy special meals or plans. For exercising,  start with walking, and then switch to running/jogging. Running is the  most efficient and calorie-burn exercise ever. If you are overweight a  lot,  walk  first  or you may have health complications (heart attack,  disjointed  bones and so on). Weight lifting is a good means to target  your problem areas for men and women. It's not necessarily to become a  bodybuilder or even join a gym - a couple of dumbbells will help you  to target your problem areas (stomach, butt, legs, arms, chest).|`|YQYMPGK3aa	unfortunately there is know quick fix.    basically you have to exercise to burn the food you are eating so your body turns to burning fat.    Do alot of cardio - aim for 30-60 mins of constant cardio a day and do you best to eat healthy.    diet is the most important thing!|`|E9L0HFRSaa	Try Spirulina from the health food shop.  Protien is what switches off your brains 'hungry' switch. But meat protien isnt particulary good for you due to all the other stuff within the fats and muscle of animals.  Spirilina tastes rank, but contains 300% more protien that any meat or fish. Its also full of vitamins and my hair and nails grow like crazy when I take it.  It does reduce the hunger very well.  I would advise putting it in a pure citric juice of some kind though because it really does taste bad.  Again, protien is what switches of the hunger at the brain. That to me seems like the most natural and safe way to diet....thats what I think anyway.|`|qLkMSEBwaa	Don't believe that spam BS!!!!!!!!!!!  Adkins is a good fast way, but is very strict on carbs.  Everyone who ever did the diet lost a lot of weight, but always put it back on.  If you have insurance, and health issues, the lap band surgery would be the best and not as hard as the gastric bypass I had.  I shattered both bones and my ankle and told I would never walk again.  My depression made me turn to food and gained the 40 lbs lost prior, plus another 100.  In a yr and a half, I lost 250 lbs-worked out 2 times a day and am a yr and a half ahead of schedule.  I don't need the skin removal because I toned up so well working out 2 times a day.  Yes I am out of the wheelchair..But, if you don't plan to follow the guidelines.  I know people who are already putting on weight within the first year and I'm still losing some..lol.  Because I never feel hungry and forget to eat.  whatever you do, make sure you see a Dr. first and try to loose it by cutting the carbs down unless it's good carbs like fruit.  Walking is great!!!!!!!!  Good Luck!!!!!!!!!!
ok0kpxsBaa	Yes and no.     You can get herpes in the genital area from a cold sore, but most cold sores are from HSV1 which tends to stick around the mouth. If you have HSV2 on your mouth, which is actually genital herpes, then you should be very careful. Somewhere around 80-90% of the population gets cold sores, and cold sores are caused by hsv1 so I wouldn't be too worried. You can also get it on your fingers.|`|SsfnitjXaa	If one has a cold sour and then give oral sex.....,yes they can give genital herpes to that person getting the oral sex.

But possible, maybe you can ask the Counselor.    Good luck!|`|fk9AvB25aa	Just because you get cold sores that does not mean that you will automatically have genital herpes as well. You can have one type of herpes with out getting the other type, but that doesn't mean it can't happen.  If YOU go down on your partner when you have any signs of a cold sore then you could pass cold sores to your partners genitals. It is possible and likely while you have signs of a cold sore. It's harder to pass when there are no signs of an out break, but there is a small chance of passing them on. My boy friend passed cold sores to my genitals when he gave me oral sex while his cold sore was healing, so it's possible.

A quick solution is milk of magnesium or Gaviscon and it works really soothing. Buy it over the counter, try it, if it works, go see your GP with your diagnosis of GORDS to have it confirmed and officially treated with prescription medications.    Good luck.

Interrupting the pattern is step 2.  Step 1 is leverage.  You need a pen and paper, and you need to understand the embarassment, humiliation, guilt, physical pain, anxiety, etc.. that smoking causes, or will cause.  For example, you have bad breath and meet a beautiful woman.  She's totally turned off and you feel the pain of rejection.  Step 2, interrupt the pattern.  You will need somethiing to interrupt your patterned way of thinking that smoking = pleasure.  Rubber band, dance move, squeeze your nose and make a honk sound.. whatever!  Last, step 3 = create a NEW association.  Say to yourself "I am smart." or "I am gorgeous."  "Smoking = massive pain."  If you believe that you're giving up something, that you're losing something.. you will not condition yourself to stop smoking.  It has to be about all the GAIN.

JwUHCwcJaa	A lot of factors contribute to high blood pressure. First of, look into your family history. Does anyone in your immediate family have hypertension? If you do have people in your family who have hypertension, you are at high risk of having hypertension. Then, consider what activity you were doing before you took your blood pressure. Taking your blood pressure right after you climb a stairs will usually result in a higher blood pressure. Are you emotionally calm? Nervousness usually result in high blood pressure. The kind of diet you have also have an impact on your blood pressure. Foods high in sodium may result in hypertension as well. Check your blood pressure when you are at rest and see what the outcome is. If it still runs high, then have your self checked up by your primary physician. Ask your doctor if it's okay to start an exercise regimen. An unchecked hypertension during rigorous exercise can cause a stroke or a massive heart attack. Good luck!|`|TsjqzanQaa	That is not high blood pressure.    Blood pressure varies throughout the day, going up and down according to health, mood, diet, temperature and other factors.

I had one and got it cut out, my leg hurt for weeks.  If the doctor can't find any cause, look at your diet.  Leg pain can be caused by excessive consumption of diet drinks containing nutrasweet.

AA10571142	Here is what you need to do, if you are serious about losing weight and keeping it off. Eat 6 small meals a day about every 4 hours. Here what that will do for you, your metabolism will increase (i.e. Loose weight) and you will have  more engry. If you go on a diet and eat less, your metabolism will slow down and store to fat. That is why diets dont work. Only the size of your fist, carbs (examples:baked potato, pasta, oatmeal, beans, corn, melon, apples, fat free yogurt, whole wheat breads)in one and protien (examples:chicken breast, swordfish, shrimp, turkey breast) in the other. You can also eat vegetables and salads with any meal, they dont have none or little fat). 30min cardo exercise every day. Any of these(examples: walking, jogging, swimming,running, biking, ect), Monday cardo, tues upper body (arms: curls, tricep extensions,pull ups, front press)(abdominals: leg pull crunch, leg raises), (chest: bench press, butterfly, pullover)(shoulders: front press, arm pullover, cross county skier machine)(back:seated row, lat pull downs, back extension)(YOU DONT HAVE TO DO IN ONE DAY, mix it up) wed cardo, thurs lower body (legs: leg pull,leg press, squats, lounges) fri cardo, sat upper. Sunday eat anything you want and dont exercising, you do this on sunday so your body doesnt go into starvation mode. YOU NEED TO TAKE SUNDAY OFF. If you stilck with this you will have a great body. also drink aleast 8oz of water daily! Stay away from Mcdonals, Wendys, ect because there is nothing good for you on the menu's even the salads are bad (beaon bits, cheeze, dressing, ect) Good Luck :)|`|AA12308795	Above answer is correct.

In distilling, the vinegar is turned to steam by heating. Therefore it destroys the powerful enzymes and distills out the life-giving minerals such as potassium, phosphorus, natural organic fluorine, silicon, trace minerals and pectin as well as many other powerful nutrients! Distilling also destroys the natural malic and tartaric acids which are important in fighting body toxins and inhibiting unfriendly bacteria.

Many of our more chivalrous readers have sought to make oral sex a more palatable experience for their partners, and I wish that I could give them all some firm directions towards doing so. But this is a subject that continues to be cluttered by myths and, these old wives' tips aside, there is simply no single recipe for preparing a tastier load. The reason for this is that taste is, well, just that, a matter of taste! One woman's sugar will be another woman's poison. So rather than pointing you towards a particular menu, let's look at the alleged effects of certain foods on ejaculation.     Fruits like kiwi, watermelon, celery, and pineapple are all said to make semen taste lighter. Beer and coffee are believed to have something of an opposite effect, and could leave her with a bitter taste in the mouth. Alkaline-based foods like meat and fish produce a buttery taste, while acidic fruits (cranberries, blueberries and plums) produce a pleasant, sugary flavor. Most liqueurs will do the same, while dairy products can make for a foul taste because of their high bacterial putrefaction levels.         From Personal experince coffee and soda drinks make it bitter while eating a lot of vegtables and fruit seem to make it more pallable.

AA11103615	Anyone can experience depression, regardless of age, gender, race, creed or income. Every year millions suffer from some type of depressive illness. Although depression is common, it is a serious illness and can even lead to suicide.     One of the most common myths about depression is that it is "normal" for certain people to feel depressed  older people, young adults, new mothers, menopausal women, or those with a chronic illness. The truth is that depression is not (and should not be accepted as) a normal part of life for anyone, regardless of age or life situation.|`|AA11004753	I think it is a chemical problem.

Personally, I think it is there spirit. If a person has kind of a sad life all of there lives, they will be more prone to depression as opposed to someone who has experenced alot of success throughout there lives. You just kinda gotta tough it out, not like try to handle all that is comming at you yourself, but perhaps find a friend or a good psychiatrist to talk to about your problems if you are having any, makes things seem not so bad if you have someone to talk to.|`|AA12145024	I say it's probably due to both. The other factor could be the environment one is in at home and/or school and the people in it. It can also be due to the way one has been raised. I believe it's a different case for everyone and usually it's a combination of things. Everyone has their own limits and their own way of dealing with things. Some people don't really know how to express themselves and stress builds up and instead of anger being generated, it is depression that they experience.|`|dc46a0e7a8701767feb3c560abddbd60aa	It's both.    The only exception to the above is situational depression...holidays, winter, illness in the family or even a death in the family, loss of a job, work stress, etc.    Chemical depression, at least from my experience in my family, is hereditary.   My mother had it, my grandmother to some extent, me, and several others up the line.    So the answer, to the best of my knowledge, is both.    Hope that this helps.    Love as always,    Sebastian

Your body mass index (BMI, which can be calculated by dividing your weight with the square of your height in metres) is about 28.1. A normal person's weight at your height should be about 65-70kg.     But all is not lost. You can start losing weight (about 1kg per week) by cutting down on your calorie intake per day by about 500cal. Complement this by doing aerobic exercises like brisk walking, jogging or swimming) for 20 minutes, 3 times a week. You should be able to see results within the first month itself.     However, it is best to consult your doctor before you embark on any rigorous exercises. This is to ensure that you do not get any complications from that exercise.

I have never taken that one so I am not sure.|`|AA11390361	The symptons you're describing   i've never heard of as being associated with anxiety and /or stress and I'm inclined to believe side effects of the buspar.  If I were you I'd go make an appt. with my family doctor right away for am concerned at the pain you're having .  The usual symptons of stress/anxiety are difficulty either falling  or staying asleep, diarrea-spastic colon which is due to stress,feeling tense jittery, feeling overwhelmed, scared, panicky trouble concentrating and staying focused, being irritable   low energy or hyperactive, always worried but not always having a reason   and so on.  I've never heard of buspar so can't say anything about it but if your muscle and abdomen pain started after you began taking it then there may be an association.

GP are awesome, but it is much better to talk to a Psychiatrist about these things due to the nature of psychiatric illness and medications.  If you do have a Psychiatrist, you should be able to call his office and have him call you back (usually after the workday for non-emergencies) so you can get personalized answers to this kind of question.    If you are wondering if you want to take meds at all (from the last line of your question), real depression does take time to work out, but it doesn't usually just go away with time.      PS.

Serotonin is the 'happy hormone' that you make naturally. Cipralex makes it stay in your system longer and so it builds up after a week or two. (can take longer)  It does not make you high. It does not make you drowsy. You wont start singing and dancing (unless thats what you normally do)   I took it for 6 months and it worked for me. Stopped me feeling so sad and lethargic. Stopped me paniking over simple things.  You should not stop suddenly once you have been on it for a while.

Keep your chin up. Youll feel like **** coming off them but youll get better, trust me. Lifes hard and a *****, but it will get better.|`|AA10958640	Generally, when started on antidepressants, you'll be on them for 6 months after the depression has resolved. Usually around 9 months total. The side effects of Cipralex and other drugs in the same class are nausea, which can be quite severe at first, but calms down after a week or so. You may also feel a bit more anxious than usual for a few days but again, that will settle. If you're only taking 10mg then yes, you can stop taking it without any problems, but you should really talk to your doctor before stopping it as you were prescribed it for a reason.    I was started on cipralex in November 2004 for depression and anxiety. It didn't help, so after about a month the dose was doubled. I still didn't get any benefit from it at all, even after a few months and I was changed to Prozac in March 2005. That was slightly better, but things deteriorated and my dose was doubled. That still wasn't helping enough though, so in January this year I started on Venlafaxine (Efexor). After 4 weeks my dose was doubled and I've had a really good response to it. I feel a lot better now. I still have bad days, but they're outnumbered by good days.    If the cipralex doesn't work for you, ask to try a different antidepressant. Not everyone responds to the same ones, I thought I'd never find one that would help me, but eventually I did and it's definitely worth persevering.

AA12299326	Given the information it is really hard to tell.     If the pain is cyclical, and therefore related to your menstrual cycle, some hormonal manipulations can help. Another cause of cyclical pain is fibrocystic disease. The patient can have numerous hormone responsive cysts throughout the breast that hurt (sometimes a lot) during some phases of the menstrual cycle.     Constant unremitting pain which does not relate to the cycle is very unusual and requires a full work-up by a physician very familiar with breast physiology.     Some general surgeons specialize in the evaluation and treatment (medical and surgical) of breast disease. Many OB-GYN doctors are comfortable with the evaluation of these problems.

Just to have a checkup. The preference is up to you about male/female.

Your health is the most important thing you have...  As far as who to see, it is all very subjective.  I prefer a man simply b/c in my experience, the female docs I saw weren't very empathetic.  The men, in my opinion, don't know what we are going through and are therefore a little more sympathetic.  Regardless of who you see, you should go every year...for piece of mind and for early detection of cancer!|`|350e3c5413a78457702aba33fe5c2294aa	well, it's certainly better to know if there's an issue now than later, doncha think?    as far as men vs. women goes it's not (for me, at least) about the gender.  i've had female obg's that i really disliked, and i've had male obg's that i really did like - come to think of it, i don't think i've ever disliked a male obg.    but my last OB was the best - she had really small hands, and it was a lot less uncomfortable than it could have been!|`|96daccd8cec868c49c9767bf89b0ccc9aa	I was very scared the first time I went.

There are men you can feel comfortable with too, but I prefer a woman. When you go, make sure to tell him/her that you had unprotected sex. You should be tested for stds.  All in all, it's not a bad experience,and it's over pretty fast.|`|AA11369834	Get referrals from your friends and decide if you would feel more comfortable with a male or female doctor. Don't be embrassed they have seen and heard just about everything. Male doctors will have a female nurse with them.     Let them know it's your first visit and they should explain everything to you. Remember you are in controll of the visit and what happens. And if you don't understand something just ask    Normally they will go ahead and test for STD's when they do your Pap.     It's goes by pretty quick and it shouldn't hurt if anything does speak up and let them know.  You will feel pressure but not pain.|`|a9f7ea7ac2dffbf1614e34cd0c9c45c2aa	Its nothing to be scared of, its not the most fun thing to do but who ever you go to wont hurt you and they will be compassionate about your situation. I have only seen women GYNs and have felt comfortable with that so I don't know if I would see a man, but it is there expertise so whatever you feel comfortable with. Also, reasoning for going to a GYN isn't always just for the sake of getting checked for an STD or something of that nature, those parts down there are sensitive and need to be checked out just like your teeth or eyes. You should definitely go. Good luck!|`|de1a2eb78bf1a3d93b115861e4578580aa	Ask you friends who they visit.  The procedure is quick and relatively painless.  You will feel slightly anxious, but that's normal.  It's better to make sure everything is "running" smooth than to wait until somethings really wrong.  Perhaps you should get a script for the pill, since you didn't use protection.
AA11812170	I am in a similar situation, but not as bad.  You should not take the water pills while on a trip.  Places to stop are very unpredictable and not dependable even if marked on a map.    You need to stop often and I hope someone else is driving or taking turns with you.  You should stop at least every two hours or more often depending upon your conditions.  The more serious the more often you should stop.  Stopping often will make the trip even longer and more difficult in the way.  However, the stops will give you a chance to change positions and walk around a bit.  Stop at rest areas and for gas and for a snack.  Just keep it too a schedule and do not push yourself.    S.C. has very few rest areas.  They have a few places to pull over, but that is about it.  You need to be sure to stop in each larger city that you come into or near.    I want to go across country in a few years and have flown, but I would prefer to see the land between here and there.  It is tough, but I may decide to fly just to avoid the physical discomforts.  You will not enjoy the trip if you are uncomfortable and in fact you could put yourself into danger.    I suggest driving on a long one day trip or just a ride and see what your limits are.  You will be able to gage your limits and be able to plan your trip better.  Or decide to fly instead.|`|c2aabed26d573505ce71ae1375e57c83aa	Have you considered taking the train?  I traveled on the "City of New Orleans" from Chicago to New Orleans once and it is a trip I will always remember.  It is a leisurely journey and you can see a lot of the country that way.  I would urge you not to drive as well.  It is really not safe to drive with those kinds of problems.  Let AMTRAK do it for you!  Enjoy your trip.|`|aac170281e9d31d889a11d361efd87f8aa	The only way to make your trip less tiring is to have frequent stop and walk around for a few minutes for proper circulation of your legs/feet. Try to wear a support hose and a good fitting shoes. If you're not driving you can also exercise your feet by doing range of motion exercises. Avoid drinking too much water/fluids. Enjoy your trip.

In other words if you ate a box of strawberry chocolates, the semen will not taste like strawberry. Strong flavoured foods like onion, curry ,  garlic etc will in some people cause the taste and smell of those fluids to change. Unfortunately for you semen will always smell like semen, feel like semen and taste like semen.

We are all different in our own ways but we try and accommodate others no matter how different they may seem.  Life is what we make it, if it hands you lemons, make delicious lemonade.  You seem to be indecisive when it comes to taking actions, everything is based on rules and regulations: school, government, households, etc.  These rules are guidelines for us to help us stay on the right path.

Did you have a tramatic experience happen in your life? you no life isn't fair and it would be hard for anyone to say it is. I tend to analyze things too much so that they stop making sense.

I am overcoming my depression without meds. I see a psychologist every week and at first he wanted me to go on meds but I didn't want to and now he even says I dont need them.

Sometimes it really sucks, but try to think about how cool it is that we can look a lot further into what life is all about!    Anyway, the point is you're not crazy.

You would have to be really sure about when you could have gotten pregnant and be expecting it to mayeb see a sign of it. But the first four to six weeks of pregnancy are usually mild and most women dont even realize they could be pregnant until this point.

A two week nutritional detox and cleansing diet can reduce the risk of chronic disease, but it also has immediate benefits: improved vitality and stamina, better digestion, mental clarity and focus, a feeling of calm and decreased allergic symptoms. It does not involve starvation or require eating strange foods, but emphasizes fresh, simply prepared foods that are easy on the body -- to digest, absorb and eliminate -- and minimizes toxins and allergenic foods. This diet is well-suited to warm weather, when there is an abundance of flavorful fresh produce that requires little preparation.

AA10841601	I remember feeling just as you do now.  Older people seem to have privileges, style, and knowledge - and you want to treated like that too.  Who wouldn't?    Also, when you look younger than your age, it seems like people talk down to you.  They forget to respect you for what you do well and what you know.    The problem is not you.  It's your PERCEPTION of you.  Can you believe me when I say that perception isn't always what it seems?  When you grow older, you will realize the truth in what I am saying.    Now, I know that you just want to do a style thing right now.  Just a little make-over for a party maybe?  For that, investigate the geometry of the face and how make-up can shade it to change it's shape to appear differently - perhaps older.  A good stylist or stage makeup person (or their website) can explain that to you.      But remember that you are ACTING older for fun or mild mischief and that is not the real you.  Also remember that if you are trying to look older to attract men, you are not going to like the results.    The best, and most beautiful, you can be is to treat yourself well, get plenty of rest and exercise.  End conflicts with your parents or school, and focus on your own GRADUAL development.  The result will be total and lasting.  And people will love and accept you because you took care of yourself and didn't take any short cuts.

AA12047241	Your are right-Cosmetic Surgery is very cheap in India .As far as giving more information is concerned-there is one company that is very famous in India that arranges cosmetic surgery for foreigners in India.They are called the Forerunners Healthcare.I read a lot about them in the Newspapers and about their patient stories.I have also read that they arrange financing for american and canadian patients as cosmetic surgery is not covered by insurance.    They also have photos pasted of their International patients.You can checkout their website.The cost savings are incredible.As a doctor i personally believe that your cosmetic surgery can be easily handled in India as the quality of healthcare available here is simply best in the world.The surgeons are USA/UK trained and facilities are 5 star.     my cousin got a couple of plastic surgery including tummy tuck after previous c sections procedures through the forerunners healthcare in India and is all praise for this company.She is more than very happy with the results.she just paid 30% of the amount she was quoted in USA.hope this helps.     http://www.forerunnershealthcare.com|`|035f0fe9a2fa97c7c0687a0ded160a79aa	Who Knows, but a plane ticket isn't cheap and they probably don't have as stringent of laws for sanitation.

7c453c69a2fd3933d0656c03f5488174aa	yes, you can.    There is this little gland called the cowpers gland in men. Before a man ejaculates, it "flushes" their urethra. Since men use their urethra to urinate AND to ejaculate, this little gland wants to make sure the way is clear so that when he does ejaculate, it's all clear for his sperm, making them more successful in their journey. This little "flush" can contain sperm, and can be enough to get you pregnant.     Many men also "leak" even more before ejaculation. This is normal ( my husband does) and it only takes one sperm to get you pregnant, and one drop of semen contains thousands of them.    The likelihood is much lower, because they have a much longer swim without the helpful force of the ejaculation to get them closer to their destination, but it is still possible.    However, it takes weeks after conception before you really feel any symptoms. So take that into account as well.|`|60652ce4ebb1a43c5f9eafd542161c1daa	Yes you can.....only takes a drop|`|0888bab30fdc3b33bc93a8d497c81e04aa	if i were you id take a pregnacy test and get checked out   good luck =]|`|8f4d0f2b0d0e8c2b5e7ff3ef8a9379cfaa	Yea might be because of pre ***. but the chances are really low. but id take a pregancy test|`|04cde08b9c83d0159bb8f1278d41fce6aa	I totally agree with "KB" on their answer it fully discribes the male reproductive system.

Firstly define Sunglasses, Sunglasses are optical wear that reduces the Suns glare. That was the main purposes of Sunglasses. And in the olden days they are mainly Tinted Black (Deep Black).    However, Sunglasses have 'evolved' with time. New age Sunglasses are no longer Black, they come in various shades and now even filter Ultra Violet Rays.    Shades of Yellow or Orange are known to be great filters of light. Thus using these lenses, 'absorbs ' the glaring light and making vision more sharp and clearer. A little dark but thats the same effect if you're not wearing sunglases but your car has tinted windows.    I reccomend OAKLEY, though, I recently bought a pair and found out that the lenses can be customised to suit your type of vision. The Ducati model was made specially designed to suit wearing while riding, so why not driving.    The bottom line is YES to Sunglasses for night driving, unless of course you're driving in a forest or in a middle of dessert, where there is no lighting.    Cheers.    P.S - I used to wear shades of amber for my priscripted lenses, now I;m wearing an OAKLEY Sunglasses with blue lenses, even when I ride at night.    Cheers!

Medical Author: Melissa Stoppler, M.D.  Medical Editor: Barbara K. Hecht, Ph.D.    Many people today still want a tan despite the fact that sun exposure is known to be associated with skin cancer and premature ageing of the skin. A tan is often seen as cosmetically attractive and as an outward sign of good health.    A tan is actually a sign of skin damage. Skin cells that have been damaged by ultraviolet (UV) radiation produce more of the pigment melanin and that is what produces the tan.    Many people think that tanning booths and beds are safe alternatives to acquiring a tan naturally outdoors. This is based on the erroneous belief that tanning indoors does not damage the skin. This false sense of security has encouraged the frequent use of tanning booths and beds.    In fact, they may be even more dangerous. Natural sunlight contains a mixture of both short-wave UV-B and longer wave UV-A rays. Both UV-A and UV-B exposures can lead to premature ageing of the skin, and both increase a persons risk of developing skin cancer, including malignant melanoma. The difference is that UV-B rays cause more rapid tanning and burning while UV-A rays do not cause burning until exposure levels are very high.    Indoor tanning booths and beds most commonly use ultraviolet bulbs that emit predominantly UV-A rays. Unfortunately, UV-A rays penetrate more deeply into the skin and can even adversely affect the cells involved in the bodys immune response in addition to raising an individuals risk of developing malignant melanoma and other cancers of the skin.    In conclusion, there is no scientific evidence that the use of tanning beds and booths is any less damaging or harmful than exposure to outdoor sunlight. To the contrary, the evidence suggests that indoor tanning may be even more damaging and dangerous, especially because some people become addicted to maintaining a deep, dark tan irrespective of the season.|`|759b251cb1f96062263eb5c2b92cf46eaa	Various types of skin cancer later down the road and premature skin ageing.

The following healthy living recommendations will help you if youre trying to lose weight, tone up your muscles, have aspirations of building lean muscle mass, are attempting to get a wash board stomach, or just want to feel better:    *1) Burn more calories then you're consuming everyday and measure your results using the following formula: Calories Consumed minus Basal Metabolic Rate (BMR) minus Physical Activity minus the Thermic Effect of Food (TEF). A website that explains this formula in more detail and will help you determine how many calories you need to reach or maintain a certain weight is at http://www.primusweb.com/fitnesspartner/...

Here are two websites that will calculate a suggested body weight:          Adults: http://www.halls.md/ideal-weight/body.ht...  Teens/Children: http://www.kidshealth.org/kid/exercise/w...    It is difficult and unhealthy to lose more than one or two pounds per week. There are 3,500 calories in a pound. If you eat 500 fewer calories per day for a week you will lose one pound. If you burn through exercise 500 more calories per day for a week you will lose one pound.     *2) Eat natural and organic foods found on earth versus something created by a corporation to make money. Eat meals in small portions throughout the day and take a good multi-vitamin supplement.     Avoid High Glycemic Load Carbs (sugar, pastries, desserts, refined starches such as breads, pasta, refined grains like white rice; high starch vegetables such as potatoes) and drink lots of water. Read this article for more information on high GL Carbs:  http://www.hsph.harvard.edu/nutritionsou...    Do not try fad diets or diet pills. Here is an excellent food pyramid that anyone can follow: http://www.rayandterry.com/html/images/P...    *3) Exercise on most days by doing cardiovascular training and/or resistance training activities.

Os papilomavrus possuem predile??o por tecidos de revestimento (pele e mucosas) e provocam na regi?o infectada altera??es localizadas que resultam no aparecimento de les?es decorrentes do crescimento celular (clulas) irregular. Estas les?es s?o denominadas verrugas ou vulgarmente conhecidas como "crista de galo".   Conhecida desde a antiguidade, as infec??es genitais pelo HPV chamaram aten??o a partir da dcada de 80, quando se identificou a correla??o destas les?es como cancer de colo uterino. Mais de 100 tipos at o momento foram identificados, dos quais apenas 30 tipos podem infectar a regi?o anogenital feminina e masculina.     O Papilomavrus Humano  um vrus universal, que n?o tem preferncias, quer seja quanto ao sexo, idade, ra?a, localiza??o. Pode se instalar em qualquer regi?o do corpo, bastando haver uma porta de entrada atravs de micro-abras?es (micro-traumas) da pele ou mucosa. J se detectou o vrus n?o s na regi?o genital, mas tambm extragenital como olho, boca, faringe, vias respiratrias, anus, reto e uretra. E ,ainda, sua presen?a foi encontrada no lquido amnitico (lquido que envolve o feto na vida intra-uterina).    Nos genitais existem duas formas de manifesta??o clnica.  As verrugas genitais que aparecem na vagina, pnis e anus.   Existe uma outra forma, que  microscpica, que aparece no pnis, vagina e colo de tero.     Trata-se de uma infec??o adquirida atravs de contato sexual.    Na vagina e no colo do tero ele normalmente se apresenta com les?es microscpicas que s podem ser descobertas atravs do exame de papanicolau ou a colposcopia.     O tratamento depende de diversos fatores como:  - A idade da paciente;  - O local e o nmero de les?es;  - Se a mulher est grvida ou apresenta alguma doen?a ginecolgica.  N?o se esque?a que mesmo aps o tratamento  aconselhvel o acompanhamento. Seu mdico  a pessoa mais indicada para lhe dar todas as orienta??es. Converse com ele.    QUAIS S?O AS FORMAS PARA TRATAR O HPV?  Existem vrias formas de tratar. A maioria delas destruir o tecido doente e pode ser feito por:  Criocirurgia  Tratamento feito com um instrumento que congela e destri o tecido anormal.  Laser  Utilizado em alguns tipos de cirurgia para cortar ou destruir o tecido onde est?o as les?es.  CAF  Feito com um instrumento eltrico remove e cauteriza a les?o.  ATA   um cido aplicado pelo mdico diretamente nas les?es.  Coniza??o  Um peda?o de tecido em forma de cone  retirado com o auxlio do bistur, do Laser ou do CAF.

Existem mais de 200 subtipos diferentes de HPV, entretanto, somente os subtipos de alto risco est?o relacionados a tumores malignos.  Os HPV s?o classificados em tipos de baixo e de alto risco de cancer. Assim, os HPV de tipo 6 e 11, encontrados na maioria das verrugas genitais e papilomas larngeos, parecem n?o oferecer nenhum risco de progress?o para malignidade, apesar de serem encontrados em pequena propor??o de tumores malignos.   As infec??es clnicas mais comuns ocorrem nas regi?es genitais como vulva, anus e pnis.  O uso da camisinha diminui a possibilidade de transmiss?o na rela??o sexual (apesar de n?o evitar totalmente) e por isso  recomendado o seu uso em qualquer tipo de rela??o sexual, mesmo naquela entre casais estveis.  H uma vacina que est em desenvolvimento pra prevenir o HPV e ela funciona estimulando a produ??o de anticorpos especficos para cada subtipo de HPV.

c5fca514bc2d9ac7defee0e5917bbf13aa	Distimia:  Transtorno de humor que n?o debilita tanto quanto a depress?o.  A distimia  um transtorno do humor.  uma depress?o leve e constante. Por isso, os sintomas s?o quase os mesmos da depress?o: tristeza prolongada, altera??es de sono e apetite, falta de energia, sentimento de falta de esperan?a, baixa auto-estima e dificuldade em tomar decis?es.    A pessoa n?o tem vontade de sair de casa e n?o tem mais prazer ou interesse por quase nada. Apesar de estimulada, n?o consegue controlar seu desejo de permanecer no conforto do lar, sem a presen?a de outros, sequer de contato telef?nico. Outro sintoma que aparece com freqncia  a irritabilidade, perde a pacincia por nada.    Para que se chegue a este diagnstico,  necessrio que os sintomas da distimia estejam presentes por dois anos ininterruptos. Alm disso,  preciso que se descarte a hiptese de se tratar de uma depress?o em si (depress?o maior), bem como excluir a possibilidade de estar havendo uma fase de exalta??o do humor, como ocorre na sndrome bipolar: mania ou hipomania.    A pessoa que sofre de distimia raramente procura ajuda; afinal, vive quase que normalmente. s vezes, tem a doen?a desde a infancia e adolescncia; assim, pensa que seu estado de humor se deve  sua natureza,  sua personalidade.    O tratamento medicamentoso segue na linha dos anti-depressivos. A psicoterapia oferece timos resultados. Num primeiro momento, o foco da psicoterapia n?o deve ser a doen?a, mas sim os aspectos saudveis da pessoa. Ela precisa voltar ou come?ar a acreditar em si e conseguir enxergar os resultados positivos de suas iniciativas. Quando capaz de ver estes resultados, reinicia sua jornada cada vez mais na dire??o da sade.|`|9e16ab711fce9547c9e78ca037fe1561aa	espero que esse site responda!  http://www.saude.com.br/site/_/materias/...|`|8b31480cc67b9e045ea9e529a9b0dac5aa	Distimia ou sndrome do mau humor,  um tipo de depress?o leve, onde o doente est sempre desanimado, com o semblante sisudo (da o nome), acorda e levanta assim.

O paciente com Distimia passa a vida sendo considerado pelos outros como sendo baixo astral, melanclico, que v tudo pelo lado negativo. Muitas vezes s?o pessoas que na infancia e na adolescncia eram melanclicas, "profundas", encucadas.     o reclam?o, crica, "Oh dias, oh vida oh azar".    s vezes s?o pessoas perfeccionistas e que n?o tem muita tolerancia para as imperfei??es dos outros.    Sua auto-estima  baixa e sua autocrtica alta.    Evitam festas, pois tem dificuldade para confraternizarem.    O desenvolvimento profissional pode ser prejudicado pelas dificuldades de relacionamento com colegas.    2) Desenvolvimento:    A conseqncia lgica  que essas pessoas, gra?as ao seu comportamento, acabam recebendo estmulos negativos no trabalho, nas atividades sociais, nos namoros.    Isso faz com que sua vis?o negativa do mundo fique cada vez mais refor?ada  Ningum tem todos esses sintomas e todos esses tra?os de personalidade. Muitos Distmicos se esfor?am para vencer as dificuldades de relacionamento e serem mais sociveis. Na verdade eles s?o injusti?ados porque seu comportamento  causado por uma doen?a, mas as pessoas n?o sabem disso. Na parte de tratamento voc ver por que.  Sucesso atrai sucesso, dinheiro atrai dinheiro, poder atrai poder, sorte atrai sorte, beleza atrai beleza e Distimia atrai isolamento social, rejei??o, isolamento, falta de convites, desculpas para recusar convites, etc.    Com o passar dos anos, os parentes e amigos acham que se trata de uma pessoa "poliqueixosa".     claro quanto mais cedo ela come?ar na vida (costuma aparecer na infancia e adolescncia), mais ir prejudicar os relacionamentos dessa pessoa.|`|4d4c7c846ce23f63d7b247594e6d2617aa	Distimia  o ato que o meu felino chamado dist faz quando est com fome: Dist MIA!!!!!|`|ab51d60c783633ca7bef2c8fa7f353ceaa	Distimia  uma forma de desordem de humor da depress?o que se extende por pelo menos dois anos, e se caracteriza pela falta de prazer ou divertimento na vida.

O radical grego dys- do termo significa defeituoso, anormal ou irregulares sentimentos. Portanto a interpreta??o de distimia seria, originalmente, algo como doen?a que causa sentimentos anormais.  Algumas pessoas com distimia respondem ao tratamento com medicamentos antidepressivos. Para depress?es brandas ou moderadas, a Associa??o de Psiquiatria Americana, no ano 2000, em suas diretrizes para tratamento de pacientes com disordens depressivas severas, aconselha que a psicoterapia sozinha ou acompanhada de antidepressivos pode ser apropriada.|`|6f46a8ac2fab646d181809dde58d97c5aa	 uma quase depress?o, n?o chega a s-la, mas uma pessoa com distimia, est sempre triste, reclamando de tudo, nada para ela est bom, enfim,  uma melancolia que pode durar algum tempo, de 03 meses para frente; toda pessoa distimica  "chata", negativista e etc. a distimia foi por muito tempo confundida, e  at hoje, com a depress?o. o tratamento ainda  com antidepressivos, pois ela  uma linha divisria entre a depress?o e a n?o-depress?o.

9d21a71378c4e114668eb40c5ba592e7aa	Yes, they do. However, they are best for core strengtheing not body fat reduction.  Let me give you some examples.      If you hurt your back and are trying to strengthen your mid section to prevent or rehabiliate injury, Pilates is great.    If you are lean and are trying to add definition to your midsection and/or legs, Pilates is great.    However, if you are trying to lose 20 or more pounds of body fat, Pilates is not that good since it is primarily for core strengthening at low impact/safety.  It doesn't really raise your heart rate, which is what sheds the body fat.  In which case, you would be better off on a stair master or eliptical machine.    I hurt my back and re-habilitated with pilates.  However, i wasn't trying to lose body fat.    Thus, pilates does work for core strengthening but is not the best for rapid bodyfat loss.

For the bath sink I close the drain and pour some in and let it set for a couple of hours.  After you do this Spend about $50 at Home Depot or Lowes and by an inline water filter. They go in pretty easy. Buy the one that you install on the main water line and it will do all the water coming into your home.  The ones under the sink only do that sink and usually not even the hot water.

f0387bf26ebc0a6d1bf34dffef477addaa	Get someone to support you and hold you accountable. That's what I do.  If I don't feel like working out but I know that I will be letting someone down, I get up and do it!! Good Luck!|`|75d2f88e5e9397a481dde2b0ac05317caa	As much as running is beneficial to your health, I find it hard sometimes myself to keep myself going.  This is why I generally try to run at gyms or fitness centers that have tv's located near their treadmills/elipticals/etc.  You can put your focus onto something else and also time yourself as well (one half hour show=30 minutes running, easy).  But it also makes me forget that I've been running for a while too.  The best places are ones with Cardio theatres - they'll play movies on huge projection screens in specially made rooms, and it is SO easy to just watch that movie and forget how long you've been running for!    Other than that, my main motivation is because I have a body that I want to keep looking good and healthy :) Don't need much more than that!|`|99b688e76b75f46b8a5d14d59066d8b5aa	Hi Andrew,    Do something you enjoy, that way you won't have to worry about dragging yourself to do it! For example, I love my dance classes. The warm up and stretches make me ache every time (the next morning especially) but it's all worth the dancing that we do later!! It's salsa and jazz.    Also, what really keeps me pushing for that extra push-up or extra few crunches is the thought of my ex boyfriend who left me when I was fat. So everytime I bump into him, I'm looking more gorgeous, and more fit, I can see the regret in his eyes!! And thats the picture that pops into my mind when I don't feel like doing my cardio for the day.     Also, watch what you eat before your workout (an hour or two before). I find that when I eat rice about 2 hours before I must workout, I become more fatigued and can't move much! When I eat yoghert, sometimes I feel drowsy!! Try downing a banana an hour before your workout to help you kick start your mood.    GoodLuck my friend.

I'm not vegan though and have found that milk is a really great source of protein.  A lot of oatmeals and breakfast cereals have high iron content, spinach and other dark leafy greens work well in this category.  Tofu dogs are a good protein source as well, and so are all of the other Boca options, though these can be kind of pricey I think they are cheaper overall than meat, and generally have less calories, too.    I am really into making different pasta dishes loaded with vegetables--a favorite is any kind of pasta with spinach, tomatoes, garbanzo beans, and seasoned with italian dressing or pesto.  This adds a lot of flavor for not a lot of calories, especially if you go low-cal on the dressing.    Salad also works wonders for dieting, as long as you again stick with low cal dressing and load up on veggies.    Good luck and have fun--vegetarian is the way to go!|`|6085e5219fc042ee9214dd4f4fba67b4aa	oriental stirfry|`|AA11137897	Breakfast    French Toast    1 cup Soymilk   2 Tbsp. Flour   1 tsp. Sugar   1 Tbsp. Nutritional yeast flakes   1/2 tsp. salt   Sliced bread (about 6 slices)     Mix together all ingredients except bread. Dip slices of bread into the mixture to coat well. Heat oil in a skillet and fry until golden brown and crispy on both sides. (Use a nonstick pan and cooking spray to make them fat-free.) Serve hot with cinnamon or maple syrup.    Lunch/Dinner  My Favorite Lasagna  Yield: 8 servings    This is an incredibly easy dish. You don't even have to pre-cook the lasagna! It's one of my favorite meals to serve to meat and cheese eaters.        1/2 lb Fresh mushrooms, sliced   2 ts Olive oil   2 26-oz jars of spaghetti sauce (or your favorite sauce)   9 Lasagna noodles   10 oz Frozen chopped spinach, thawed   1 lb Tofu   1 ts Salt   2 tb Nutritional yeast   1 1/2 ts Oregano   1/2 ts Garlic powder   1 ts Basil   1/2 ts Rosemary, crushed   1/8 ts Cayenne pepper   Soy Parmesan (optional)     Saut the mushrooms in the olive oil until tender; remove from heat and add the spaghetti sauce.  Place the tofu and thawed spinach in the food processor and process briefly. Add the remaining ingredients--except the noodles--to the processor and blend until smooth.  (You may do this without a food processor by using a potato masher on the tofu.)    Preheat the oven to 375 degrees.    Spread half of the sauce in the bottom of a 9x12-inch pan. Place a layer of noodles over the sauce, using three dry noodles and leaving a little space in between them. Spread half of the tofu mixture on the noodles. Cover with another layer of 3 noodles and then spread the remaining tofu mixture over them. Top with a final layer of noodles, and pour the remaining sauce over this. Cover the dish tightly with foil, and bake for 30 minutes. Then, remove the foil and bake for another 30 minutes. Remove from the oven and sprinkle with soy parmesan if you want. The lasagna will cut better if you allow it to cool for 15 minutes before serving.
7b26408d9323e67df3591f010d6de6bfaa	Moles, known medically as nevi, are clusters of pigmented cells that often appear as small, dark brown spots on your torso, face, arms and legs. But moles can come in a range of colors and can develop virtually anywhere, including your scalp, armpits, under your nails, and between your fingers and toes.    Most people have between 10 and 40 moles, although the number you have may change throughout life. New moles can appear into mid-adulthood, and because moles last about 50 years, some moles may disappear as you age.    The great majority of moles are harmless, but in rare cases, moles may become cancerous. Monitoring moles and other pigmented patches is an important step in the diagnosis of skin cancer, especially malignant melanoma. Although not all melanomas develop from pre-existing moles, many begin in or near a mole or other dark spot on the skin.|`|cbc356320651932dd440a2d4b9ea26a8aa	thought they were called moles too??|`|f9ae2e684f2706d3b06b0b5727de2ef4aa	I'm not answering your question, only showing an interest in the answer like you are.|`|8ab000a67c3ea18fbb61a60609429ee0aa	sh'it splatter?|`|2b9d485745a35beda19be2300a9027edaa	I don't know their real name, here we call them black spots!

597f3f743781dc320363abeccdfe8b81aa	La alergia al ltex es una alteracin del sistema inmunitario por la que la persona afectada reacciona de manera exagerada al contacto con las protenas que se encuentran en el ltex de caucho natural.  Debe sospecharse alergia al ltex en cualquier persona que presenta picor, lagrimeo, enrojecimiento ocular, irritacin nasal, abones, hinchazn local o generalizada, asma, anafilaxia, choque anafilctico (reaccin de todo el organismo, con desvanecimiento, afectacin cardiovascular y riesgo vital), despus de tener contacto con objetos de ltex, como globos, guantes, preservativos, chupetes y tetinas, celo, pegamento, colchones elsticos, suelas de zapatos, mangueras, gomas de borrar, tejidos elsticos, mando del televisor, guantes, sondas, tiritas, manguitos de tensin arterial, mscaras de reanimacin y de oxgeno, esparadrapo, tapones de medicamentos, etc.    Entre todos ellos, los de mayor riesgo son los de goma blanda y elstica (guantes, globos, preservativos) y aqullos que ms se manipulan, al ser los que mayor cantidad de ltex liberan.    Las gentes que tienen mayor riesgo son:      *  Pacientes con mltiples cirugas y procedimientos mdicos tales como pacientes con espina bfida o enfermedades urovesicales congnitas.      * Personas atpicas (con tendencia alrgica) que sufren otras alergias, especialmente a frutas como kiwi, pltano, casta?a y aguacate.      * Grupos profesionales que usan guantes de ltex durante largos periodos (sanitarios, construccin, limpieza, manipuladores de alimentos).      * Cualquier persona que est en contacto frecuente con objetos de ltex.    ?Cmo se diagnostica?  Un paciente que presenta los sntomas anteriores tras contacto con algn objeto de ltex debera acudir al alerglogo y confirmar la sospecha de alergia mediante historia clnica, pruebas cutneas, anlisis de sangre y pruebas de provocacin controladas.     ?Cmo se trata?  Aunque existe una vacuna o inmunoterapia frente al ltex, el mejor tratamiento es la prevencin de las reacciones. stas son las medidas recomendadas:        * Evitar el contacto con objetos de ltex, principalmente guantes y globos. Ante la duda, desconfiar de todo producto elstico, principalmente de paredes delgadas.      * Llevar medalla o pulsera que indique claramente la alergia al ltex.      * Advertir siempre de la alergia al ltex antes de cualquier exploracin, visita, prueba, cura mdica o dental, intervencin quirrgica, para que puedan atenderle en un ambiente libre de ltex.      * Una medicacin previa a someterse a exploraciones o intervenciones quirrgicas puede reducir los sntomas de la reaccin, pero slo el uso de materiales totalmente libres de ltex garantiza que esa reaccin no aparezca.      * Hay que tener siempre disponible los medicamentos que paute el alerglogo: antihistamnicos, corticoides, dispositivos autoinyectables de epinefrina, que conviene que el paciente lleve consigo ante situaciones comprometidas, lugares nuevos, excursiones o viajes.      * Al acudir a restaurantes, comedores escolares o de empresa, tiendas de alimentacin, hay que asegurarse de que los alimentos no se manipulen con guantes de ltex.      * Tras tocar un objeto de ltex, hay que evitar tocarse posteriormente los ojos, la boca u otras mucosas. Este tipo de contacto puede desatar una reaccin importante.      * No slo el contacto fsico, sino tambin la inhalacin del polvo de los guantes o de los globos puede provocar una reaccin alrgica.      * Tenga en cuenta que muchos alrgicos al ltex lo son tambin a frutas como el pltano, el kiwi, la casta?a o el aguacate. Evite estas frutas si le producen alergia y consulte a su alerglogo en caso de duda.      * Deben evitarse en la casa los ficus, ponsetias y otras plantas que desprenden leche al estrujar sus hojas o rasgar el tallo. La similitud de este ltex con el del caucho natural puede provocar reacciones.|`|f8c7dcd195c7748e1062333d8a2ca464aa	definitivamente q existe, pero si tu novio te esta dando una excusa para no usar preservativo, entonces dejame decirte que existen condones hypoalergenicos que no contienen latex.|`|6fe7cc8d6a32d38f5316487962c8be0eaa	Si, existe    Saludos!|`|e07a28c297461ea87727b58ebdc5a4c1aa	pues si!!!|`|5f154b33aab947034757d03d04904e2aaa	En ambos sexos... en realidad s hay mucha gente que tiene ese problemilla|`|373823690b9aa32028d8bf2b072c9f83aa	Creo que si ....

fcdba8620e952499293f3727e4102a78aa	Mira yo no me la he practicado , por razones obvias, pero aqu te pongo lo que he encontrado.    La embolizacin consiste en interrumpir el flujo sanguneo de las arterias que alimentan los miomas. Con este procedimiento se detienen las hemorragias, y se reduce el tama?o de los miomas. Por otra parte, se evitan procedimientos ms agresivos, como la miomectoma (ciruga para extraer los miomas) o la histerectoma (extirpacin del mismo tero). La parte sana del tero seguir recibiendo sangre por otras arterias.   ?Cmo se hace?  La paciente es valorada en primer lugar por un gineclogo, que es el que hace la sospecha diagnstica. A continuacin, se le realiza una ecografa y/o Resonancia magntica, para definir bien el nmero de miomas, su tama?o y la localizacin; as como una analtica de sangre de rutina.   La embolizacin es realizada por el radilogo intervencionista, en una sala de Vascular que dispone de un equipo de Rayos X especial.  La paciente es ingresada el mismo da del procedimiento, y una vez en la sala de Radiologa Vascular, se le coge una vena en el brazo por donde se le irn suministrando los sedantes y analgsicos que sean necesarios. Tambin se le coloca una sonda en la vejiga, para que se vaya eliminando el contraste que se va introduciendo y no interfiera en la visualizacin del radilogo mientras est realizando la intervencin.  Aunque este procedimiento se realiza sin anestesia general, siempre hay un anestesista presente que es el que va controlando los medicamentos que vaya necesitando la paciente.  Catter en la arteria uterina derecha. Se introduce contraste por el catter y se delimitan dos miomas de gran tama?o. La intervencin se lleva a cabo, a travs de la ingle por donde pasa una arteria llamada femoral comn. Despus de desinfectar la zona con un antisptico, se inyecta un anestsico local con una aguja muy fina. Al cabo de un minuto, la piel est anestesiada y se procede a pinchar la arteria con una aguja ms gruesa. Una vez dentro de la arteria, se introduce un tubo muy fino de plstico (catter), y se va navegando hasta llegar a las arterias que llevan la sangre al tero y a los miomas.   Todo esto se hace guindose a travs de una televisin conectada al equipo de Rayos X.   Una vez con el catter en su sitio, se introducen unas partculas de muy peque?o tama?o, que van cerrando las arterias que alimentan a los miomas.  Terminado el procedimiento, se quita el catter y se hace una compresin local con la mano, igual que se hace cuando se aplica una inyeccin a la vena. Despus de esta compresin, la paciente es llevada a su cuarto, donde deber permanecer ingresada durante unas 18-24 horas. Durante ese periodo, ya podr comer, leer y ver televisin. Despus de dormir una noche en la clnica, al despertar por la ma?ana, en general la paciente ya se encuentra en condiciones de ser dada de alta.  Anestesia y tratamiento del dolor  La embolizacin se realiza con anestesia local en el lugar donde se introduce el catter. En la mayora de las pacientes, en las horas siguientes al procedimiento, e incluso en los primeros das despus de ser dadas de alta, sufren dolores clicos en el bajo vientre, semejante a los dolores de la menstruacin. Esto es debido al sbito corte en el abastecimiento sanguneo de los miomas.   Complicaciones. La embolizacin es un procedimiento mnimamente invasivo, pero aun as sujeto a algunas complicaciones:   Hematoma en la ingle, en el sitio de la puncin, que no suele requerir ningn tratamiento y desaparece en unos das.   Como consecuencia de la embolizacin, en las 48 horas siguientes la paciente suele presentar malestar y dolor en el bajo vientre, a veces acompa?ado de fiebre (sndrome postembolizacin). Normalmente cede con tratamiento mdico, pero a veces persisten das o incluso semanas despus del procedimiento, y excepcionalmente pueden requerir intervencin quirrgica para quitar el tero.   ?Qu xito tiene la embolizacin?  Ha quedado demostrado en diferentes estudios que la embolizacin de miomas uterinos es una buena alternativa a otro tipo de tratamientos ms agresivos y con ms complicaciones como es la histerectoma. Se est viendo que esta nueva tcnica se est implantando cada vez ms en los pases de nuestro entorno por los siguientes motivos:  El 87-90% de las mujeres embolizadas cesan de sangrar y les desaparecen los otros sntomas acompa?antes, como dolor, sensacin de opresin.   Las pacientes se recuperan pronto y pueden reanudar sus actividades diarias en un mnimo de tiempo.   En una nica sesin se pueden tratar todos los miomas a la vez.   La embolizacin se considera un tratamiento poco traumtico ya que no se pierde el tero.   La embolizacin de miomas uterinos no impide que la paciente se someta despus a otras intervenciones, en caso de que la embolizacin no resuelva los problemas (5-10% de los casos).

Karate will only help as more cardio.  Also, stay on a schedule (4-5 days per week).  Finally, make you you are sticking to a healthy diet; minimal refined sugars and flours.

Don't do it to please anyone.  Don't do it to be "cool" or fit in or make your mate happy.

ee8e8c18fa17d461a824ec2f91d835b7aa	Normal to a girl like me.   Men need to take time on grooming needs.  I worked at a drugstore and this guy was going on a date and he pulled out all the stops to groom himself.   Lotions, soaps powders, hair gels, and deodorant etc.  If not for himself  it was for his mate holding him that night.  It is some of a memory that sticks in your mind to be a gentleman.   Not some rugged cowboy with mud on his boots and spurs on like Clark Gable with his Indian Wife.    My man had this grooming habit and I was crazy about the colone he wore and I noticed it on other men but it was not the same.    Men do not need to feel like a powder puff but a big sexy velvet  teddy bear.   Yeah,  I love the bears.|`|1957c4762c4a531b95ce993d5e71f358aa	gross but i dont think so because it mite be normal but heterosexuals mite not b attracted to these things. at least not the 1s i met.|`|AA11544445	Yes.

With exception to their feet, I wouldn't say I'd be attracted to their body...however it'd probably inspire me to improve myself...& become somewhat like them. I'd appreciate them, not be attracted to them.

From then on, nothing will happen until you're about 8 weeks pregnant.  That's when the nausea and sore breasts start.    Get a pregnancy test done if you think you could be pregnant.

3a15a185741af8118978069daa9d695daa	Well, it depends. It's different for everyone, but most start feeling better within a week. The big issue with most people is taking their antibiotics! It's very important that you take ALL of them, or your symptoms will come back sooner and usually are worse and last longer. Just make sure you take all your meds like you doctor says. I think that this disease is something you will have to live with the rest of your life, depending on how severe your case is.

AA11788388	A healthy, and balance diet. Foods, which aid in the building of the hemoglobin, are usually also rich in iron. Eaten in moderation, they can help to stabilize an improper blood hb, but if you overdo it, you propably not only might suffer from constipation then, but also, on the long term, would bring more iron into your body as your body can handle.    Try to find out the reason for the HB deficiency. Sometimes it's other reasons and not an iron deficience which is causing a low HB count, like the size and shape of your MCV and MCH...that can definitely contribute to a lower HB count!    For more detailed answers, I would suggest you consult a doctor/hematologist and/or a dietician.    Good Luck!|`|9ca7575f3134267fd32f7c69bfad6aa0aa	Lots of Green leafy vegeatables and red meat in moderation.

AA10379545	There are actually two chemicals involved.  The first, mifepristone (RU-486), works against a "pregnancy hormone" called progesterone.  This causes the baby's surroundings in the womb (the placenta) to break down.  The baby's nourishment is cut off, causing the baby to starve to death in the womb.  The second chemical, misoprostol, causes contractions that push the dead baby out of the mother's womb.    Side effects include heavy and extended bleeding, heart attack, hemorrhage, and impaired future fertilty.  At least twelve women have died from RU-486:    http://www.lifeissues.org/ru486/deaths.h...    Here's why it is so dangerous:    http://www.standupgirl.com/site/index.ph...

This is from Harvard University. Easy to read and reliable. Whatever site you choose, be careful it is not created by some nut or place selling you pills. Everyone's dietary needs are different, and it is possible to kill yourself by severely altering your diet, especially with pills. Be aware that people process foods differently, many foods have additives (some for public health reasons - like iodized salt) and many fruits and vegetables overlap. Talk to a doctor before anything. Whatever you consume will affect you, don't do anything drastic i.g. You wouldnt do 100 pushups tomorrow - don't go on an all carrot diet.

Try to lose body fat and gain lean muscle mass by doing combination of aerobic and weight training and stretching, also  eat healthy.

Bicycle maneuver. To do this exercise, you lie flat on the floor with your lower back pressed to the ground. Put your hands beside your head. Bring your knees up to about a 45-degree angle and slowly go through a bicycle pedal motion. Touch your left elbow to your right knee, then your right elbow to your left knee. Breathe evenly throughout the exercise.    Captain's chair. This was one of the few on the "most effective" list that involves gym equipment. To do the exercise, stabilize your upper body by gripping the handholds and lightly pressing your lower back against the back pad of the chair-like equipment. The starting position begins with you holding your body up and legs dangling below. Now slowly lift your knees in toward your chest. The motion should be controlled and deliberate as you bring your knees up and return them back to the starting position.    If you do not have access to a captain's chair, Francis says you can improvise by hanging from a bar, although that may be difficult for many people who aren't in shape.    Crunch on exercise ball. A high-quality exercise ball, which costs about $30 depending on the size, is necessary to do this exercise. Sit on the ball with your feet flat on the floor. Let the ball roll back slowly. Now lie back on the ball until your thighs and torso are parallel with the floor. Cross your arms over your chest and slightly tuck your chin in toward your chest. Contract your abdominals raising your torso to no more than 45 degrees. For better balance, spread your feet wider apart. To work the oblique muscles, make the exercise less stable by moving your feet closer together. Exhale as you contract; inhale as you return to the starting position.    If you do a crunch, researchers found you are better off doing a vertical crunch (which ranked number four on the list of most effective ab exercises for the rectus abdominus) or a reverse crunch (which ranked number three for strengthening the obliques).    "These crunches don't put as much stress on your back," Francis says, as a traditional sit-up type crunch.    To do a vertical crunch: Lie flat on the floor with your lower back pressed to the ground. Put your hands behind your head for support. Extend your legs straight up in the air, crossed at the ankles with a slight bend in the knee. Contract your abdominal muscles by lifting your torso toward your knees. Make sure to keep your chin off your chest with each contraction. Exhale as you contract upward; inhale as you return to the starting position.    To do a reverse crunch: Lie flat on the floor with your lower back pressed to the ground. Put your hands beside your head or extend them out flat to your sides - whatever feels most comfortable. Crossing your feet at the ankles, lift your feet off the ground to the point where your knees create a 90-degree angle. Once in this position, press your lower back on the floor as you contract your abdominal muscles. Your hips will slightly rotate and your legs will reach toward the ceiling with each contraction. Exhale as you contract; inhale as you return to the starting position.|`|6ba604f298fb0c50ea6452fa1978381baa	Burn the fat off your body with aerobics.

Esas personas pierden su tiempo. Quiero decirte con respecto a tu pregunta que la masturbacion es un acto que sirve para alimentarte el deseo y tambien para auto conocerse. Masturbandote podras conocer tus gustos, la manera en como prefieres que te toquen, la rapidez, la presion, etc, pero primero comienza en ti, es como una exploracion intima, lo importante es que sientas que te encuentras contigo misma. La manera mas sencilla de hacerlo es con tus propios dedos, una vez que tu sexo este bien humedo, si aun eres virgen te recomiendo que solo frotes y juegues con tus labios, y consientas a tu clitoris con delicadeza y con movimientos circulares, puedes ejerces presion y pellizcar tus labios al mismo tiempo, acariciar tus senos, etc. Si aun eres virgen, insisto, yo como tu, no introduciria mis dedos para no romper mi himen, aunque la virginidad va mas alla de lo material, es mas espiritual como cuando te entregas aun hombre, per aun asi, repito si lo eres la mejor manera de desflorar tu himen no es que seas tu misma, dale la oportunidad al hombre de tu vidad cuando lo consigas, si ya lo tienes entonces permitete que sea el quien te masturbe y dile cuan delicado te gustaria que fuera y explicale como te gusta que te lo hagan.     La tecnica es tuya, tu misma te iras experimentando y conociendote. Suerte. Ten en cuenta que para esto debes sentirte bien, y si sientes algo de culpa es mejor que no continues y esperes un poco mas. Ya sabes, solo trata de que estes biene excitada y humeda, ya sea con fantasias sexuales o por tu propia estimulacion. Que gozes de tu sexo y de tu cuerpo. Arriba las sensaciones femeninas.

AA11069838	Both males and females produce smegma. Since smegma can accumulate under the foreskin in males, its presence is less common and less noticeable in circumcised males. This has caused the argument over whether circumcisions ought to be performed to impact the related argument over whether smegma is beneficial or harmful. The lack of smegma has been described as a benefit of circumcision. In contrast, lack of smegma could contribute to the loss of subpreputial wetness consisting of natural skin oils, leading to drying or chafing of the glans in circumcised men. Smegma can be removed by wiping or washing the genital area.    The subpreputial moisture keeps the glans moist and may lubricate the movement of the foreskin. However, if allowed to accumulate and decay in the foreskin cavity, it can combine with shed skin cells, providing an ideal medium for potentially pathogenic bacteria to colonise[2]; current medical opinion is that allowing smegma to accumulate freely is unhealthy. Accumulation of smegma can cause or aggravate a variety of irritations known as balanitis. Early medical studies such as those by Plaut, and Heins (1958) claimed that smegma accumulation led to the development of penile cancer, but more recent studies have disagreed [3].    Uncircumcised men with poor personal or excessive hygiene are most affected by balanitis. Lack of aeration and irritation because of smegma and discharge surrounding the glans penis causes inflammation and edema. Adherence of the foreskin to the inflamed and oedematous glans penis is one cause of phimosis [4].    Preventing accumulation is best done by rinsing the area with warm water. In females, the hood of the clitoris can be gently pulled back to wash away smegma. Some argue that soap is best avoided because it depletes natural skin oils and may cause non-specific dermatitis [5]. In addition, vaginal deodorants that are sometimes used to combat unwanted odors can be harmful, as they tend to upset the normal balance of bacteria in the vaginal cavity. This can in turn upset the pH of the vagina [6]. Noticeably unpleasant odours can be an indicator of a potentially serious medical problem, and deodorant sprays or washes may hide this condition.|`|d6a486148fc379992b5e9db4697a22a9aa	GROSS|`|e7b7efe894a5e94bba39f7f840625dc4aa	It sounds like you are forcing it to stay in between your ears.|`|0a4bd4d0b27788668da04d42dbfa8c22aa	Good quality jello type smega takes about a week .

637ec58c1caf6b6f049c0d381a67e79daa	One of my friends is a personal trainer specifically for women.    But before I say how, some women suit the baby belly. If its a little bit noticeable, it can be extremely sexy.    Basically, you need to eat healthy, this is the first and most IMPORTANT aspect of trying to slim down. No matter how many sit ups, how many miles you jog, or how many diet pills you take, if you don't eat healthy you're screwed. So remember, First and foremost, have a healthy eating schedule.    Secondly, its not how long you excercise, but how efficiently, in actuality if you're efficient you only need to get your heart rate up for 45 mins x 3 times a week. I'm a guy, and I wake up at 5am every 2nd morning and jog for 45mins, my eating habits could be better though :) I do it more for the cardio though than to slim down.    Thirdly, Sit ups, crunches, whatever you may call them, It's all about form... That means 2 controlled, slow, meaningful crunches always beats out 10-12 lazy, sloppy ones. Everyone has a start, so take it slow, if you can do 10 slow concentrated sit ups/crunches x 3, then keep it at that. Don't do them till you're in screaming agony and you look like a person suffering a heartattack.    And lastly, Water. Lots and Lots of water, drink so much water you feel sick, because that sickness will subside. Most people's bodies are not used to lots of water thanks to caffeine, iced tea, pop, etc. See the pattern? Caffeine really messes with your system, eliminate it and you're on your way to being healthier.|`|8b561d3f0eab717a028f8a03d31c28eeaa	Try diets like weight watchers is a good one.|`|AA10171820	When i had my first baby,I bought a low impact aerobics tape that I used five days a week.

Sua fun??o esperada  a perda de peso, conseguido atravs da inibi??o da recapta??o de serotonina e de noradrenalina (HANSEN et al, 1999, STOCK et al, 1997). A sibutramina deve ser usada simultaneamente com exerccios e alimenta??o adequada, e somente quando dietas e atividades fsicas n?o produzirem os resultados desejados.     A noradrenalina  um horm?nio liberado pela supra-renal e serve tambm como precursor da adrenalina, tendo como principais efeitos: eleva??o do metabolismo, aumento da freqncia cardaca e da press?o arterial. Ao evitar a recapta??o da noradrenalina na fenda sinptica a siburamina potencializa os efeitos deste horm?nio, aumentando o gasto energtico (HANSEN et al, 1998; WALSH et al, 1999).     A serotonina  um neutrotransmissor produzido no crebro a partir do aminocido triptofano, atuando como vasoconstritor, estimulador da musculatura lisa (presente nos rg?os), regulador do sono, do apetite e do humor. Ao inibir a recapta??o da serotonina, aumenta-se sua concentra??o, diminuindo a ansiedade e aumentando a saciedade (CHAPELOT et al, 2000).     Ou seja, a sibutramina atua atravs de dois mecanismos: aumento do gasto energtico e diminui??o do apetite.     Eficincia     Em geral, as pesquisas demonstram a sibutramina como eficiente e relativamente segura no combate  obesidade.     Em 2000, JAMES et al, administraram 10 mg/dia de sibutramina juntamente com um dficit calrico e obtiveram redu??o de 5% ou mais de peso em 77% dos pacientes ao final de seis meses. Ainda neste estudo os autores verificaram que sibutramina foi eficiente, tambm, na manuten??o deste redu??o ponderal por um perodo de 18 meses. Neste mesmo ano, McMAHON conduziu uma pesquisa que procurou averiguar a eficincia e seguran?a do hidrocloreto de sibuitramina na redu??o ponderal de pacientes obesos hipertensos. O estudo durou 52 semanas e, segundo os autores, as interven??es no comportamento foram mnimas. Mediu-se o peso corporal, o IMC, circunferncias da cintura e do quadril, nveis de triglicerdios, HDL, LDL e colesterol, como medida de seguran?a, controlou-se a press?o arterial, freqncia cardaca e rea??es adversas. Nos pacientes tratados com sibutramina a perda de peso ocorreu no primeiro semestre e foi mantida at o final do experimento, deste grupo 40,1%, perderam 5% ou mais do peso corporal e 13,4% perderam mais de 10%, em compara??o com 8,7% e 4,3% no grupo placebo, respectivamente. Esta perda de peso foi relacionada com melhoras em todos os parametros analisados. Os pacientes tratados com sibutramina tiveram um aumento mdio de 2 mmHg na press?o diastlica e de 4,9 bpm na freqncia cardaca, em compara??o com o placebo que teve queda de 1,3 mmHg na press?o arterial e nenhuma altera??o na freqncia cardaca. Os efeitos adversos foram em grande parte transitrios e de pouca relevancia, sendo a hipertens?o causadora de descontinuidade do tratamento em 5,3% dos pacientes do grupo experimental.     Normalmente os estudos tm verificado perda de peso significativa com o uso de sibutramina como os de CUELLAR et al (2000), que usou 15 mg/dia de sibutramina durante seis meses em pacientes obesos e obteve perda de 10,27 kg no grupo experimental, contra apenas 1,26 kg no controle, alm de redu??es significativas no IMC e na circunferncia da cintura. FANGHANEL et al (2000) administraram 10 mg/dia de sibutramina durante seis meses a pacientes obesos, obtendo perda de 7,52 kg em mdia para o grupo experimental e redu??o de 12,51 centmetros na circunferncia da cintura.     Especificamente sobre a saciedade, CHAPELOT et al (2000) analisaram os efeitos objetivos (ingest?o de alimentos) e subjetivos (sensa??es de fome) com a administra??o de 15 mg de sibutramina no perodo da manh? (08:30). A substancia come?ou a fazer efeito, mais ou menos, 6 horas depois da ingest?o, produzindo redu??o no consumo calrico de, em mdia, 311,5 kcal comparada com o placebo, esta redu??o foi ainda maior quando se analisou o perodo de 24 horas (redu??o de 382,4 kcal), sendo o efeito mais acentuado no almo?o (redu??o de 152,1 kcal).     Efeitos colaterais     Os efeitos colaterais mais comuns encontrados nos estudos foram: secura na boca, press?o alta, fadiga, constipa??o, taquicardia, anorexia, dores de cabe?a e ins?nia. (RICHTER, 1999; FANGHANEL et al, 2000; LUQUE et al, 1999; JAMES et al, 2000; BRAY et al, 1999, CUELLAR et al, 2000; SCHUH et al, 2000). Inclusive, houve alto ndice de desistncia dos paciente em alguns estudos, como no de CUELLAR, onde +/-37% do grupo experimental abandonou a pesquisa devido  ineficincia e aos efeitos colaterias da interven??o, principalmente infec??es respiratrias e constipa??o.     Como a sibutramina tem sido considerada segura e eficiente pela maioria dos especialistas, corre-se o risco iminente de abuso. Pensando nisso, pesquisadores franceses realizaram um estudo para averiguar os efeitos de doses abusivas de sibutramina. Na pesquisa, comparou-se 25 e 75 mg dirias desta substancia, com 20 mg de anfetamina e placebo. De acordo com os resultados, o uso de 25 mg/dia de sibutramina n?o produziu efeitos colaterais relevantes, j a dosagem de 75 mg/dia ocasionou efeitos desagradveis como ansiedade, confus?o e fadiga, sendo que os pacientes optariam por n?o mais receber altas doses de sibutramina, ao contrrio da anfetamina, que produziu efeitos positivos no humor e foi considerada agradvel pelos pacientes (SCHUH et al, 2000).     Conclus?o     Apesar de muito usada e prescrita por mdicos e pseudoespecialistas a sibutramina tem seus efeitos colaterais e suas limita??es. Lembre-se que ela s deve ser usada nos casos onde diet

Quando algum est com Artrite o primeiro passo  descobrir qual a causa do problema.       s vezes a causa  simples e o tratamento  rpido. Outras vezes, porm, a Artrite  causada por doen?as mais graves que necessitam um tratamento especfico. Nestes casos o tratamento deve ser iniciado o quanto antes, para impedir deformidades ou outras seqelas irreversveis, (muitas formas de artrite est?o relacionadas com doen?as sistmicas graves que necessitam um tratamento apropriado).        A causa mais freqente de artrite  a Artrite Reumatide. Porm inmeras doen?as distintas tambm podem se manifestar com artrite- entre elas podemos citar a Artrite Psoritica, Espondilite Anquilosante, Sndrome de Reiter, Osteoartrose, Condrocalcinose, Infec??es, Tumores e inmeras outras. Portanto, na presen?a de Artrite, o mais importante  diagnosticar imediatamente a sua causa. S assim o Mdico poder orientar qual o tratamento apropriado e garantir uma boa evolu??o.   oportuno salientar que a artrite ou doen?a reumatide  uma sndrome imunolgica inflamatria cr?nica e progressiva, causada por distrbios de alta anticorpos que agride a membrana sinovial formando o pannus, que progressivamente destri a cartilagem e o osso subcondral, causando as deformidades clssicas da doen?a, fundamentalmente nos punhos, nas metacarpofalangianas, interfalangianas proximais, joelhos e quadris.  A artite reumatide n?o somente acomete as articula??es, como tem sintomas extra-articulares graves como: vasculite, comprometimento ocular, pulmonar e cardaco.  O tratamento da artrite reumatide n?o  apenas com antiinflamatrios, sejam eles n?o hormonais ou hormonais,  importante que todos esses pacientes fa?am uso do que a gente chama de medicamentos de base de artrite reumatide, como metotrexatil, leflodomide, ciclofosfamida, asafeltrina, e hoje as terapias biolgicas e bloqueadores de fator de necrose tumoral.  N?o tratada a progress?o da doen?a  quase certa, causando invalidez em mais de 50% dos pacientes com apenas cinco anos de evolu??o.         Segundo Prado (2005), artrite reumatide  uma doen?a auto-imune, inflamatria, caracterizada por poliartrite cr?nica, simtrica, erosiva e, geralmente progressiva.       Coimbra (2002) complementa ao dizer que esta doen?a  caracterizada pela inflama??o da membrana sinovial com a progress?o da doen?a avaliada em termos de les?o ou destrui??o ssea (destrui??o progressiva da cartilagem e osso).|`|5b562ee2991d6402d2698c9afce7e231aa	Minha irm? no banheiro|`|6f9cc748770ea2e10942e8eb760f3708aa	 tipo uma inflama??o nas juntas...... ex: dos dedos .......se n?o fizer um tratamento c / anti-inflamatrio adequado, c / o pasaar do tempo fica defeituosa a junta afetada..... tem rela??o c / artorse mas n?o sei bem a diferen?a ......creio q a artrite  uma consequncia grave da artrose.

El problema con el tabaco es todo el ritual de gestos y actividades que tenemos a lo largo del da que nos recuerdan de fumar, como por ejemplo tomar un caf, levantarse, irse a dormir, acabar de comer, salir al balcn. En otras palabras, la dependencia psicolgica es muy dura de vencer, y aunque en cierta manera la hipnosis tambin sirva para eso, tendrs que meterle mucha fuerza de voluntad. Si realmente no ests convencido de que quieres dejar de fumar como sea, no lo conseguirs.   La hipnosis no produce milagros, simplemente hace que nos veamos capaces de realizar algo que ya de por s queremos mucho, pero que por motivos psicolgicos nos vemos incapaces de conseguir.   Tienes que tener, pues, motivos muy fuertes para querer dejar de fumar, y luego buena asistencia psicolgica. Y no te enga?es, la mayora de fumadores (o consumidores de cualquier droga), lo son "en reserva" toda su vida: les ser muy fcil volver a caer en ella, cuando esten en una situacin social donde se est consumiendo, y haya una presin implcita o explcita del grupo.    nimo.

d22acbb2c45d8b5cf218a4771810b6e8aa	?Interesante Caso!    Un peque?o grupo de seropositivos, algunos conviviendo por ms de 20 a?os con el VIH no han desarrollado a la fecha el SIDA; y son llamados  "lentos progresores".  Pocos infectados en la primera oleada del SIDA (primeros a?os de la decada 1980-90) siguen vivos. Por lo tanto, no todos los huspedes tienen la misma susceptibilidad o resistencia al desarrollo de la enfermedad. Es posible que ante la  ausencia de tratamientos o vacunas, el humano acabar adaptndose al virus de la inmunodeficiencia humana. Incluso en la actualidad se sabe que no todos somos igualmente susceptibles. Hay individuos que no se contagian tras muchsimas exposiciones y otros que aunque lo hacen no desarrollan la enfermedad. Diversos estudios han identificado ms de 10 genes y 14 alelos (cada uno de los genes del par que ocupa el mismo lugar en los cromosomas homlogos) cuya presencia o ausencia ayuda a determinar la rapidez de la progresin de la enfermedad. Su adaptacin no consiste en tener capacidad de eliminar el virus, pero s  en evitar que los eventos inmunolgicos (como la destruccin de linfocitos T CD4) se produzcan. La solucin para controlar la epidemia est en el desarrollo de una vacuna, y en la mejora de los tratamientos antirretrovirales. Sin embargo, la evidencia nos dice que con el tiempo (miles de a?os) el humano se adaptar a la infeccin retroviral.   Se estima que entre un 1% y un 5% de las personas seropositivas tiene una evolucin de su enfermedad muy lenta. El nivel de sus clulas defensivas es normal y la cantidad de carga viral es nula o muy peque?a. Hay cientos de investigaciones que han intentado comprender cmo estos pacientes logran controlar el VIH. El inters cientfico en estos pacientes es que si pudiramos saber cules son los factores manipulables del husped que retrasan la progresin se abriran las puertas para el desarrollo de una vacuna.     Son muchas las lagunas en torno a estos pacientes. Se barajan tres causas cientficas, no excluyentes, por las que la enfermedad no progresa.  a) Puede haber ciertas caractersticas genticas que eviten la infeccin por el VIH o bien que condicionan la entrada del virus al organismo y retrasan as la evolucin de la enfermedad. Hay identificados ciertos factores genticos protectores. El ms importante es un defecto en el receptor CCR5, una 'cerradura' por donde el virus entra en el cuerpo. Si no est, la persona no se contagia a pesar de haber estado mltiples veces en contacto con el microorganismo. Si hay un nmero muy peque?o de estos receptores, la enfermedad progresa muy lentamente. Pero estos defectos son muy raros y su frecuencia es menor al 1%.  b) Tambin se piensa que determinadas cepas de VIH tienen menos agresividad. El virus cuenta en la superficie que lo recubre con protenas que habitualmente escapan a las clulas defensivas y las destruyen. Sin embargo, en los pacientes lentos progresores el nivel de estas clulas es alto, la razn por la que el virus no se replica tan rpidamente. Es posible que  estas protenas sean las que le confieran virulencia al VIH.    c) La tercera causa que se baraja es que sea el sistema inmunolgico de la persona el que le permita luchar mejor contra el virus. Cuando el patgeno entra en el organismo se desencadena una respuesta defensiva, un aumento de los linfocitos T CD4 y CD8, pero en la mayora de los casos no son eficaces frente al VIH. En los 'lentos progresores' s.     Creo que tambin, ms all de todo analsis cientfico, los "seropositivos lentos progresores" son HIJOS ESPECIALES DE DIOS, que dadas sus caractersticas, harn que en un futuro no muy lejano, al fin presenciemos, una cura para esta infeccin.|`|fe381fe6056eb5f8af684d5aa7a35b61aa	Seguramente vas a vivir muchos a?os y tambin te vas a curar, cada vez salen mas tratamientos efectivos, as que te deseo toda la suerte del mundo.

Te voy a explicar el porque.  Al producir la penetracin (ya sea anal o vaginal) se producen micro hematomas, que son imperceptibles, tanto en el hombre como en la mujer y es por estas micro heridas que se puede producir el contagio, por lo tanto te aconsejo utilizar condn (preservativo) cada vez que exista penetracin.|`|d22acbb2c45d8b5cf218a4771810b6e8aa	En primer lugar, el SIDA no se contagia, lo que se puede transmitir es el VIH (agente causal o principal cofactor del SIDA). Seguidamente, dicen que no es adecuado contestar una pregunta con otra pregunta, pero por lo que aclarar a continuacin, me atrevo a preguntarle: ?Es su novio portador del VIH?    Dado que la respuesta a su pregunta es en s,  no tan sencilla, plantese que para que pueda ocurrir la transmisin del VIH se necesitan, a fuerza, tres condiciones:  1) Presencia del VIH; si su novio es portador del VIH, cumple esta condicin y pase a la siguiente; si su novio no es portador del VIH, olvdese del asunto, por el momento.  2) Tama?o del inculo viral, esto es la cantidad de virus en forma libre o asociada, a la que Usted se ha expuesto. Para que pueda ocurrir la transmisin se necesita la exposicin a un fluido infectante (por su orden de infectividad: sangre, semen, secreciones vaginales o leche materna), en tal forma que la cantidad de virus sea viable; es decir, no todas los fluidos contaminantes, infectan igual, asimismo no todos los infectados poseen igual infectividad en sus fluidos contaminantes, y no todos se infectan por igual. ?Desgraciadamente esto no se puede determinar por simple inspeccin o por pregunta directa!  3) El inculo viral debe incorporarse intacto al torrente sanguneo, es decir, para que la infeccin se de, los virus del VIH, en un inculo viral viable, deben incorporarse intactos (su genoma y sus cadenas proteicas) al torrente sanguneo de la persona a infectar. De all que el riesgo a diferentes tipos de exposicin sea distinto. El virus se incorpora o de manera directa al torrente sanguneo (en el caso una transfusin de sangre infectada) o a travs de relaciones sexuales por medio de las mucosas (boca, vagina, recto, etc.), dado que en ellas hay peque?os vasos sanguneos.?Igualmente esto no se puede determinar por simple inspeccin o por pregunta directa!    El tiempo necesario para permitar la transmisin es variable de acuerdo a: el tama?o del inculo viral, el tipo de fluido contaminante, las condiciones puntuales de la posible persona a infectar, condiciones del entorno al momento de la exposicin, coinfeccin previas con otras infecciones, etc.    Por todo lo anterior, al haber sospecha de transmisin, la mejor forma de saber si ha habido infeccin es SOMETERSE A UNA PRUEBA DE ANTICUERPOS (ELISA) a los TRES  y  SEIS  meses despus del episodio,?ES MUCHO LO QUE USTED PUEDE GANAR!|`|16f5dd465df2e71fed4ab186fbadbf0eaa	A unque fuera por un  solo segundo amiga. si tienes duda ve al medico. suerte y ojala que no te pase nada|`|a3a687f14bf9ab5bbaf4293bdd4ccb4baa	aunque fuera por 1 segundo mi reina!!!

We are told what to eat, what to wear, what to look like, where to party, what kind of alcohol is best, how much weight too lose, how much weight NOT to gain, etc, etc, etc.  We are a product of a society we created. You ever wonder why thin is so in? Look around you. Television, magazines, the Internet. When was the last time you saw a Ludacris video? What about the Tip Drill video? You see the girls in the videos, and in movies. How many big girls-publicized big girls-do you see on tv anymore? Aside from Monique, not that many. Look at Paris Hilton, Nicole Richie-do you remember how thick she was when she first got on tv? Now she looks like a crack whore, it's really sad.

edb4fccb90023fee79a536b1a488e4a2aa	Often PCOS is caused by insulin resistance.  When a person is insulin resistant, the pancreas is "told" to produce more insulin because the previously excreted insulin is not regulating blood sugar as it should.  This person builds up resistance to insulin, the pancreas eventually stops insulin production.    Glucose Regulation Complex has helped others with this condition.  It offers a diverse set of nutrients that provide natural support for efficient glucose metabolism.  Alpha lipoic acid, for example, helps make your cells more responsive to insulin so they get the energy they need.  Vanadium works with chromium, magnesium, and zinc to help balance your blood sugar.

The burning is the stretching or tugging.      Endometriosis causes the adhesion's.  With endo.  you bleed out into your abdominal cavity and these adhesion's start.

a51a2b72a18551e00c499792642df205aa	If you're referring to mental retardation not otherwise specified, it's not surprising that you have questions. It seems to be a category that suggests more investigation is needed to provide certainty about the degree or scope of the condition. A diagnosis of mental retardation is based on measured intellectual or thinking ability as well as adaptive functioning, which is one's ability to perform activities of daily living like self-care, communication, and so on. Sometimes it's difficult to get an accurate measure of intellectual functioning through testing that is needed for diagnostic specificity and certainty. A doctor will want to be able to diagnose a child with mild, moderate, or severe mental retardation to describe the degree to which there are difficulties in thinking ability and functioning in skills of everyday living. Until that information is available (or if it cannot be obtained), you'll see use of the " not otherwise specified" term.     I found a page for parents on the web that seems to answer many common questions about this diagnosis and other related ones quite nicely. You'll find the MR NOS category description listed under types of mental retardation : http://www.communityinclusion.org/articl...    The Centers for Disease Control also has some online information about MR, and importantly, lists some resources for parents and for kids:  http://www.cdc.gov/ncbddd/dd/ddmr.htm    It is worth having a follow-up discussion with the physician or psychologist that diagnosed your child once you've had a chance to read through this information. Jot down your questions and ensure that they are answered thoroughly. Diagnosis is more than just describing a problem - it guides intervention/treatment and service recommendations. Parents need advice about next steps for their child and what resources are available in the community to assist them. There are often governmental funds/supports available to parents of children with developmental disabilities to assist them with costs of treatment and specialized care. Sometimes there's a social worker attached to health centres that can help you with the various forms, etc., and also offer you counselling support and links with other parents if you'd like that.     Hope this information helps. Wishing you and your family the best.|`|61a08eb8e5ac2510f4be0be70f94cbf8aa	Duh, if your daughter was diagnosed with this, didn't the doctor explain the disease/condition to you?|`|AA10046551	,,,you need to call your doc
ff3f144f01033927769fa02553265e7eaa	Leukemia is cancer of the blood-forming organs, including the bone marrow, the spleen, and the lymph nodes. When leukemia strikes, the body starts producing a vast number of immature cells that do not mature or perform their proper functions. They also interfere with the production of the correct proportion of red cells, white cells, and platelets.        The type of leukemia depends on the type of cell involved. The two major types are acute lymphocytic leukemia (ALL) and acute non-lymphocytic leukemia (ANLL), which is often used to classify the other less common types of acute leukemia such as acute myelocytic leukemia (AML), acute monomyelocytic leukemia (AMML), acute monocytic leukemia (AMOL), and acute erythrocytic leukemia (AEL).        ALL: In 80% of childhood leukemia, the lymphocyte production goes haywire, leading to the form of leukemia called acute lymphocytic or lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL). The lymphoblasts (or blasts) stay immature, reproducing when they should not and crowding the bone marrow so that normal cells do not have enough room to multiply and mature. Eighty percent of all ALL is seen in children, with more boys than girls affected. The incidence peaks in late infancy, preschool years, and around puberty. Forty percent of the cases are in children between the ages of 3 and 5.        ANLL: This type of leukemia accounts for nearly 20% of leukemia in children. Unlike ALL, there is no age at which ANLL peaks in children. Its incidence increases with age, from childhood through adolescence and young adulthood to middle age, dropping off after the age of 65.|`|24009bd9f5201f9b153fcd9607c41066aa	this is a Leukemia.  more specifically: acute leukemia  more specificlly: acute myeloid leukemia: arise in special White cells called MYELOcytes.  more specifically its acute myelo-monocytic leukemia(the cells are MONOcytic i.e. having 1 neuclues & are large white cells)  This is also called M3-AML.  This special kind of leukemia can be rapidly fatal as it causes massive bleeding but also may respond quickly to treatment with Vitamine-A (how interesting).

Cosmetic Surgery is very cheap in India. There is one company that is very famous in India that arranges cosmetic surgery for foreigners in India. They are called the Forerunners Healthcare. I read a lot about them in the Newspapers and about their patient stories.    I have also read that they arrange financing for American and Canadian patients, as cosmetic surgery is not covered by insurance. They also have photos pasted of their International patients. You can checkout their website. The cost savings are incredible. As a doctor I personally believe that your cosmetic surgery can be easily handled in India, as the quality of healthcare available here is simply best in the world. The surgeons are USA/UK trained and facilities are 5 star.    My cousin got a couple of cosmetic surgery procedures in India like the breast reduction, tummy tuck and facelift through the forerunners healthcare. She is more than very happy with the results. She just paid 30% of the amount she was quoted in USA and is all praise for this forerunners healthcare company. I personally have seen the wonderful results and am particularly impressed with the kind of quality care she got from this company. I hope this helps.      http://www.forerunnershealthcare.com

Los fibromas uterinos son los ndulos benignos de clulas de msculo y el tejido conectivo fibroso dentro de la pared del tero. Segn el Instituto Nacional de Salud Infantil y el Desarrollo Humano, las estimaciones conservadoras indican que entre el 20% y el 30% de las mujeres de edad reproductiva tienen fibromas, mientras otros estudios indican que los fibromas son muchos ms frecuentes. Aunque la mayor parte de los fibromas no representen una amenaza, en algunos casos la patologa causa dolor intenso y sangrado excesivo. La infertilidad, el aborto espontneo, y el temprano inicio del trabajo de parto tambin han sido considerados como producidos por los fibromas.  El estudio tambin encontr que las mujeres con fibromas eran propensas a tener partos por cesrea. El estudio de Benson no examin la causa, pero ella cree que es porque los fibromas deforman la cavidad uterina, la cesrea es necesaria en muchos casos para asegurar un nacimiento seguro. Adems, los fibromas tienden a ser especialmente dolorosos durante el embarazo, entonces el embarazo optativamente a menudo es apresurado va cesrea.  Finalmente, el estudio encontr que entre pacientes con fibromas, el 14.7% de embarazos requiri de ayuda en la concepcin, comparado a slo el 6.4% de embarazos entre el grupo de control.    El estudio de UCLA encontr que de 139 mujeres que sufrieron el procedimiento y quienes expresaron el deseo de la fertilidad despus, haba 17 embarazos en 14 mujeres, y cinco abortos espontneos. Al tiempo que el estudio ha sido publicado, 10 mujeres haban experimentado partos de trmino normal.  Estos nmeros son aproximadamente equivalentes con los de fertilidad observados despus de la miomectoma, que es un retiro ms invasivo, quirrgico de fibromas. Por esta comparacin favorable, los autores concluyeron que el deseo del embarazo futuro no debera interferir con una decisin de realizar embolizacin del fibroma.
AA12316174	I have a similar problem. I cant use hormonal birth control. However mine isn't blood clots is to much hormones my mind and body go whack LOL.    Ive had the mirena now 3 years and its been a blessing.  The questions you need to answer b4 considering it are,  Are you in a stable monogamous relationship?  Do you have any children?  Do you really wish to have children in the future or are you indifferent?    The reasons are if you have more than 1 sexual partner you are naturally at a  higher risk of infection and if you do get an infection its harder to treat on the IUD    You should have atl;east one child bc you would have a higher rate of expulsion and also a woman who has had at least 1 child has a larger uterus.    You should be indifferent about having children or not want anymore BC you do run a .08% chance of becoming sterile at the time of removal since its yanked out. The pregnancy rate on the IUD has rise up to less than 1 pregnancy per 100 IUD users which is the same percentage of sterilization.    I have mirena but the side effects are similar only thing is it might take up to a year or a lil more for your period to lessen and the cramps to lessen.

I started bleeding right away,  and bled almost the entire 9 months I had it in.  Finally,   I made an appointment to take it out,  and the Doctor told me that normally the bleeding will get better within the first 3 months,  but it didn't for me.      I had nothing but problems after that with my periods lasting from 6 to 8 weeks and then I wound up needing a hysterectomy 5 yrs after I had it put in.        Hopefully you don't have this experience,  though.........  but you did ask for other's experiences,   so there ya go!!    Why don't you try the Nuva ring??|`|AA11543750	Every birth control has some form of side effects...

8956bd9dc3fa1d343d0cd2fe4440d509aa	Vitamin D is *not* a steroid.    Steroids have a specific chemical structure.  Vitamin D does not have this.    In response to your edits...exactly.  It is not cyclic, therefore it is not a steroid.  Call it secosteroid, call it a molecular precursor to a steroidal ring skeleton, call it whatever.  But it's not a steroid.  Ring cleavage significantly changes biological/chemical activity.  For a few examples that come to mind, check out penicillin (or any analog thereof), any prostaglandin, erythronolide, hirsutene, crown ethers, etc.    But just because it isn't a steroid doesn't mean it's not a bad thing.

It can also raise blood levels of calcium [6], causing mental status changes such as confusion. High blood levels of calcium also can cause heart rhythm abnormalities. Calcinosis, the deposition of calcium and phosphate in the body's soft tissues such as the kidney, can also be caused by vitamin D toxicity [4]. "

You can get one at Shoppers Drug Mart or Wal Mart... anywhere really. They are not very expensive which is a bonus! and then when you are ready to use it. . . massage in a circular motion over the area where you see you have an ingrown hair. It is really good to use it every time you take a shower or a bath because it helps take off the dead skin cells which is usually what causes an ingrown hair to begin with. Another thing that you can do to take a bath in epson salt.. they are little grains of salt that work as an esfoliant when you are taking a bath! it works really well. And the last thing that you could try is polisporin which helps minimize the appearance of scars. I also heard that tanning is good for ingrown hairs too but then again i dunno if would recommend it haha.     Hope i was able to help!    Kayla

We are considering not having him take the meds on the weekend but I am not sold on the idea.  For now,  I am making all of his favorites and encouraging snacks.  It does take the body sometime to adjust to the medication.      Talk to the doctor at your next med review.  Maybe a reduction in the dosage may be necessary.    Good luck.  They say that you have to take the bad with the good.  Hang in there!|`|6a1209dac02972f574fda4a956bc058baa	You might be able to split up the dosage so that the side effects don't hit him quite so hard in the middle of the day.

AA11932760	Meditation is like a yoga of the mind.  Once we have learned to concentrate our minds on one thing, and can control the mind instead of the mind controlling us, then we begin to go ever deeper inward, and discover exactly what it is that makes us tick. We discover why we think the way we do, and also where there is false logic in our belief system. We discover that much of our life has been based on fallacious assumptions, and as a result our belief system gradually changes, advancing one stage at a time, until we are a more spiritually advanced and better person than before.    Here is a good way to get started.    Sit in a comfortable position, with a straight spine, and the eyes either closed, or out of focus.    This is a good one to teach our mind to concentrate, called the twenty-four second meditation. It involves picturing numbers made up of dots as shown on large digital displays. We commence by picturing the digits 24. When we can clearly visualise each dot which makes each of the two digits two and four, then we move to 23, and 22. The concentration on the dots helps to eliminate other thoughts from the mind, and with a little practice over a few days, we are able to move from 24 down through all the digits to 0. If another thought enters our mind during this process, then we must start again. This is why it takes a few days before we are able to succeed Once we can succeed then we are achieving an alpha state of mind, which is relaxed, and free of the linear thought process. This is the state of mind required for deep meditation, which we discuss later.    http://dgwa1.fortunecity.com/mind/fastra...|`|AA11469687	There are several forms of meditation. But essentially it involves practicing to stop your mind from running on automatic. Meditation aims to allow you get back into the present with your thoughts. When this is accomplished, worries (the future),  preconceived notions, prejudices, opinions you have (all the stuff made in the past, unquestioned by yourself and recalled automatically by the uncontrolled mind as the case may require) are open to observation. To a meditator everything becomes open to question. The adept meditator lives in a world of Observation. Where she or he becomes an objective observer. Where everything is up for observation, particularly oneself, unprejudiced Seeing, Seeing things as they really are. For example, hold up your hand in front of you. What are you seeing? Are you seeing what you already thought you would see? Are you really "SEEING" your hand? Or are you seeing what your mind expects you to see? What you already predetermined, a preconceived, automatic program. If you are, then you are not in the Present (in your head) and no matter what you look at, you will always see the same thing. Whether it be your notion of your hand when you look at it or your racist opinion when you see a black man.  Meditators through years of practice see things anew every time they look. Their skill at observation, their awareness, MINDFULLNESS, their being in the moment are heightened. Using these skills you see what really IS and then go inside your now peaceful mind, with your mind,  to discover what makes you and the universe tick.|`|10ead7b8e7d76a307156e2aed3f8b98aaa	On what?Jokes.....

You can either sit or lay comfortably and calm your mind and body(really relaxing if you can manage it) or you can "meditate upon" something, which just means you focus completely on one thought and push other thoughts out of your mind. Deciding which you want to learn more about might help you narrow down your search. Good luck!|`|AA10644766	The whole aim of meditation is,  1. to calm your mind, and  2. to focus the mind on one thing.    The mind of a normal person is like an uncontrolled monkey jumping from one thought to another. To process all these thoughts a lot of body energy is used. Thus if your mind cease to process thoughts you will be saving a lot of body energy which can be used to cure a lot of ailments in your body. That is why a person who continues to meditate regularly even gets a nice body complexion.    Anapana or concentration on the breath is the best form of meditation.    If you sit down and close your eyes you will notice that your mind is jumping from one thought to another. Even though you want to concentrate on your breath you will find other thoughts also coming in between.    In learning to meditate you must first learn to calm your mind. You do this by following every thought that comes into you mind. You must be like a Manager of a Hotel who stands at the entrance and observes the customers coming in. Without getting attached to the thoughts try to observe them. You will find that a thought comes in and that it goes nowhere and another thought follows it - try following that too - with same results. This way you will find that your thoughts gradually subside. Do not try to force out your thoughts.    Of course do not expect results in one or two days. Practise it for at least 40 minutes every day for at least 2 months you find that you have 'killed' your train of thoughts. I have practised for nearly 2 years and still vagrant thoughts come in.     Thereafter start concentrating on your breath. Notice the breath coming in and going out. You should not concentrate only on the tip of your nose. Notice the breath coming in and thereafter your lungs getting filled and then gradually exhaling the breath.     After you finish that for the day start to think of a person or several persons whom you hate most. Having those people in mind start to think in a compassionate manner "may he be healthy, may he be happy, may he go up in life, may he live long". Keep on doing this for about 10 minutes a day for a few months you will find that you do not get angry even when you have to get angry.

bd7388851727f8e5810b81c40752ffb1aa	My husband is 67 yrs old and seems lazier than when I married him and falls asleep easily, too.    He is overweight has (uncontrolled - trygliceride level very high) diabetes II and high blood pressure.  He is on medication for both and recently started a weight loss regimen of diet and daily exercise.  Last year about the time the doctor changed his medication, he started these coughing spells.  It produced phlegm.  We thought at first it might be a side effect from his new medication Lisinopril so we didn't do anything about it since it wasn't too severe.  Now, over a year later (little over a month ago) we contacted his doctor since the "bronchitis" wouldn't go away and sometimes his hacking is severe and triggers a gagging reflex.  We told doctor, we thought it was a side effect of the medication.  Doctor doesn't seem to agree.  Dr. examined him, ran some blood tests and told my husband that he has pneumonia (but husband never had a fever, has not lost weight).  Dr. then checked him thoroughly for TB and that was negative.    Most recently, ran a camera down into his lungs couple weeks ago but we won't know result until Nov. when his doctor returns from vacation.      So the last word is that he has pneumonia.  We have been walking a mile each day (30 minute walk) and are on a balanced, no salt, low oil and fat, low carbohydrate diet of between 950 and 1000 calories.  He steers away from everything white:  bread, potatoes, rice, pasta.  Whole wheat bread is OK  The health educator suggested 1200 calories.  Since starting this "new way of living", he said he feels better and is losing weight slowly.    Have your dad see his doctor.    Do you have a local public health clinic.  Because it is related to public health, if he has TB then he needs to be treated.  My grandpa had it and passed it to four grandchildren.    Best of luck to all of you and hope he gets well and feels better soon.|`|9e9654f476d25114a38aa853fc0b5756aa	uh oh|`|AA12091316	Yeah, my dad falls asleep all the time - he can't sit down for longer than a few minutes before he's out like a light.

Also let them know if it hurts. Relaxing always makes it better|`|AA11617586	If it's your first visit, they usually do a general health history first along with your family health history. Some gynos will do this outside the exam room in their office, most have you fill out the paperwork in the waiting room. The nurse may take your weight, temperature and blood pressure. Then they generally will have you undress (you can leave your socks on) and put on one of those paper robe things. The doctor will come in and ask you to lay back, and do an abdominal exam. They press on your abdomen feeling for abnormalities. After that is done, the doc will do a breast exam on you, feeling your breast and armpit area for any noticable abnormalities or lumps. Then comes the pelvic exam/pap smear. It doesn't really hurt, and most docs will use a small speculum for women who have not had children. After that it's basically over. The link provided below is a good look into the first gyno visit.    If you're really uncomfortable about the idea, you can ask to meet your doctor beforehand in a separate appointment. Some women find this easier than just meeting the doctor for the first time at the gynecological exam appointment. Tell your doctor it's your frist exam. She or he should be willing to talk you through it step by step and tell you what they are going to do and why before they do it. Most important you must be comfortable with the doctor you chose and don't be afraid to ask questions! That is what they are there for.|`|ed3136ced180f7c600748a65eb11e1afaa	Well they do all kinds of things, pap smears, partial and full hysterectomies, surgery on ovary's for growths/tumors...    but I assume you mean a pelvic exam or pap smear...

Then, you will have to take all of your clothes off and they will give you a gown to wear. The nurse steps out while you undress. Next, The dr. will come in and talk to you about any problems you have been experiencing and if your periods are normal. Then he wil do a pelvic exam or pap smear. The dr. will have you lay down on the table and scoot your booty to the edge while your feet are in these metal foot cups to hold your feet in the air. He will put a warm plastic or metal clamp in your vagina to hold it open. This doesn't hurt. Then he will take a swab and run it along the civics. Sometimes it is a little uncomfortable. Then he will take out the clamp and feel around inside your vagina to check if everything feels normal. The pap smear is just to test for abnormality of cells and sometimes stds. Then he does a breast check. He will just rub his hands along your breasts and feel for lumps. Then he will talk to you about any thing he found or didnt find. Then your on your way.

e7881c8de7d3a94175f10d95a6ec7cb5aa	Spirulina is a "micro-algae," and is thought to some to contain every nutrient required by the the human body.    It has known cancer-preventing properties, and is all around beneficial to your health.      I wish my mom would have made me take them when I was little... I actually make my own chlorella and spirulina supplements (chlorella is another micro-algae with similar properties) and take them in bulk every day.  As a matter of fact, I was drinking a glass of spirulina juice when I came across this question!    Sounds like your mom's on the right track; trust me, swallowing a few pills every day is nothing compared to the long-term benefits she's insuring you by giving them to you.    Do a little research on the Internet... the more you find out about how beneficial they can be, the more enthusiastic you'll be to take them.  And the supplements I take don't have any taste whatsoever... are you taking gel-caps or pills?  If you take the gel-caps, it'll block the taste out a bit.

It's good for clearing toxins from the body; it's high in B12, which is good for healthy nerves and tissue; it's a high protein food with all the essential amino acids and is therefore good for vegetarians; it helps support your immune system and is in rich in iron.    http://www.freewebs.com/spiritualhealing
e2961ce3a9f58dc76c2d41ca399b6bb0aa	Yellow phlegm is normally a sign of an infection, or a case of the common cold. The initial state of the common flu when the phlegm is yet clear, is the most infectious period. When the phlegm turns into yellow, the body is already taking care of the infection    Over-the-counter (OTC) drugs are medicines you can buy without a doctors prescription. OTC cough medicines are grouped into two types: antitussives and expectorants.    Antitussives are cough suppressants. They relieve your cough by blocking the cough reflex. Dextromethorphan (some brand names: Triaminic Cold & Cough, Robitussin Maximum Strength, Vicks 44 Cough Relief) is a commonly used antitussive.    Expectorants thin mucus. This may make coughing work better to clear the mucus from the airway. The only expectorant available in OTC products is guaifenesin (two brand names: Mucinex, Robitussin Expectorant).    Dextromethorphan and guaifenesin are sometimes combined with each other (one brand name: Robitussin DM). They are also available in combination with other drugs, such as pain relievers, decongestants or antihistamines. These combination products, such as multisymptom cold medicines, are meant to treat many symptoms at once. However, if your main symptom is cough, be careful of the drying effect of antihistamines and decongestants in combination medicines. This effect can make mucus thicker and harder to clear from the airways, which can make a cough worse.|`|AA10663840	I am not a doctor so I can't diagnosis your problem.

AA10515207	I'm Bipolar I and have been all my life.  For a very long time I refused to go on any meds because I didn't want them to "control" me and I didn't want to give up how "great" the highs made me feel (erroneously so).  When I finally faced the fact that the disorder wasn't going away I agreed to start lithium.  I've been on it for over 20 years and it's made a world of diference in my life--and those around me.  I've had some problems with toxicity, but have been able to go back on at a lower dose and monitor it more closely.  Exercise is good for keeping moods up and my psychiatrist encourages it.  However, he also cautions me that excessive sweating during workouts means I run the risk of becoming toxic so I have to stay hydrated and pace myself.    Lithium is a great drug for severe bipolars.  Those with less severe symptoms may not need the relief it can provide.  Therefore, you need to talk to your psychiatrist (assuming you are seeing one and not a regular doctor or a prescribing nurse) about what kind of bipolar you are.  He'd probably start you off on a very low dose and then increase it if needed.  Just be sure you go for all your lab work appointments.    Tell the doctor your concerns and how you're feeling--be candid, even if you're afraid he'll think you're being silly.  When he can ascertain where you are then he may decide you need any one of a number of psychotropic drugs.  It may be Neurontin, Seroquel, Topomax (originally developed for seizures, but helpful for bipolars) the list goes on and on.    I know it's hard to be feeling this way.  It's scary not knowing if you'll do something stupid--even if it's inadvertent.  If you can't get an appointment, call the doctor's office and leave a message.  Maybe he can talk to you over the phone and give you some temporary relief.    Sounds like you're new to the "bipolar world".  You really should go to serious websites (like Medline--definitely not Wikipedia) and preferably books on the subject to learn more about the disorder and how to cope with it.    Good luck.|`|856f9f629e121d326752210489850fd9aa	I would go to a doctor that is very open-minded, not narrow-minded.  Hopefully your doctor is.  Medicine, if you have very severe bipolar, I suppose may be necessary.  But an excellent doctor will help you to treat all the underlying causes, through Cognitive Behavioral Therapy.  Dr. Jon Kabat-Zinn PhD. teaches most excellent techniques in dealing with depression and rapid, racing thinking.  This cognitive therapy Dr. Kabat-Zinn teaches has proven to be quite successful for people from all walks of life, for people from all backgrounds, & for the religious and non religious people.  He uses Mindfulness Meditation as a basis for his therapy to help people with all mental and emotional "challenges" they face on a daily basis. What he teaches, one can easily learn and put into practice for themselves with very positive results.  Medicine helps a bit, but individuals must learn to develop successful coping skills. And Dr. Jon Kabat-Zinn PhD. provides this through his simple techniques.  He has many books and audio CD books out which have been proven to be quite successful, he also has a successful clinic in Mass.  We all only have One life to live here on planet earth, so please do not do anything stupid. You and your life is precious. You are a loving person and are also worthy to be loved.  "First by Yourself and then by others."  Please do not sell yourself short. Your life is important.   A few titles of Dr. Kabat-Zinn's books are "Coming to our Senses - healing ourselves through Mindfulness Meditation", "Mindfulness Meditation" for beginners, "Full Catastrophe Living: using the wisdom of your mind and body to face stress, pain, depression, illnesses." Also  "Calming Your Anxious Mind: How Mindfulness and Compassion can free you from anxiety, fear, and panic."   And  "Guided Mindfulness Meditation - Audio CD's"   These are just to name a few.  At one time in my life I was given "A Label" by a doctor.  I learned how to exercise Mindfulness Meditation, for only 15 min. a day.  I now see things as they really are in life. I see myself totally different. I have been practicing Mindfulness Meditation for 4 years now.  And have been off all medications for 3 years now.  Some may have to continue on meds. that is fine.  But it is to your advantage to learn excellent coping strategies.  Mindfulness Meditation is the Most excellent form of Cognitive Behavioral Therapy there is!!  It works.  And it only takes some effort on our part as individuals to learn these successful strategies.  Dr. Jon Kabat-Zinn's Books and Audio CD books and information is a tool which should be utilized.  His books start at only $3.70  through  Amazon.com  And Christmas and other holidays of giving are coming up. Ask for some of these books.    Mindfulness Meditation also improves ones concentration, memory, improves ones ability to be patient and forgiving, greatly improves ones Cognitive abilities, decreases stress, helps one deal with anger, decreases anxiety (worry) alot, produces kindness and forgiveness with otherselves toward ourselves and others, provides Peace and Happiness.    This is all I know to say that will successfully help you with all you are going through.  The changes take place from the inside-out.    Most importantly,  Love yourself and be kind and forgiving toward yourself.|`|AA11871016	I had a roommate who was seriously bipolar, and smoked marajuana to treat the depression.

668354bca2e76701705fd7528222dc5faa	Hola Emile ?Sabes? Como dijeron no hay nada de malo en lo que has decidido hacer.  El hecho es que segun entiendo por lo que decis, tenes valores morales elevados por asi decirlo; creo que no te permitis ciertas cosas, o mejor dicho libertades. Mi consejo seria que aprendas a permitirte sentir y actuar mas libremente, y siempre estando de acuerdo principalmente con vos misma. Los de afuera son de palo.  Veo corazon que no has tenido otra relacion sexual aparte de esa primera. Te sentis sola, lo entiendo.   A ver si damos en el clavo ?si?   Como tus principios morales son creo que un poco estrictos, se suponia que tu primera vez seria por amor o tal vez con quien te fueras a casar; creo que esto genero en tus preconceptos una culpa como bien decis. Te pusiste a pensar como pensabas y como actuaste y al parecer no concuerdan ambas cosas.  Bien corazon, no te preocupes. No hay nada de malo en eso, tal vez esto te este ense?ando que hay que tomar las cosas con un poquito menos de rigidez. Pensa lo que sentiste en ese momento, si volvieras atras, sintiendo exactamente lo mismo que sentiste, pensando exactamente como pensaste ?Lo volverias a hacer? Yo creo que si. Por lo tanto, no te preocupes, no te culpes por lo que sentiste. Si fue lindo, quedate con eso.  Te cuento linda que al ser tu primera vez y pensando como pensas, es logico que te sientas asi, especialmente lo de la soledad. La cosa es que pensaste tal vez por mucho tiempo que tu primera vez seria diferente, tal vez con una relacion estable. Entonces ahora que estas sin pareja (mas que nada que no te has vuelto a relacionar con esa pareja que compartio con vos ese momento); estas tal vez necesitando confirmacion, o cari?o, mas que nada ese amor que tal vez alguna vez pensaste que sentirias en tu primera relacion sexual.  Tantas emociones nuevas, tanto descubrimiento nuevo te deja con una cierta sensacion de inestabilidad emocional, de vacio. La primera relacion sexual suele ser bastante incomoda debido a lo que esperas sentir y lo que sentis realmente.   Si no sentiste mucho o no tuviste un orgasmo o te reprimiste en cierto modo, esto tambien te genera cierta desazon.   Creo que lo que sentis profundamente es que te falto sentir amor. Ser amada, respetada, querida.   Corazon, no te sientas mal, te diria que te quedes con lo bueno. Solo lo bueno.   No te cuestiones tanto, no te exijas tanto, no te condenes, no te juzgues. Segun lo que decis, fue lindo. Entonces permitite disfrutarlo, y pensa que la proxima vez, si es eso lo que queres, puede ser con alguien que sienta mas cari?o por vos.  Es una experiencia, solo eso, una nueva experiencia. No te juzgues tan duro.  Creo que si nada de lo que te decimos te sirve, te conviene hablar con un psicologo. No tiene nada de malo hacerlo.  Aclara tus dudas, tus sentimientos, y que esto no sea un impedimento para disfrutar de tus futuras relaciones sexuales.   Espero sinceramente haberte podido ayudar aunque mas no sea un poquito.  Te envio un gran abrazo, cuidate mucho.|`|e40c8925b8564ac2a8598b8263d608f0aa	Creo no dejs de ser quien sos por lo que hiciste, no has perdido tus valores ni tus principios, segus siendo vos!; con esto no digo que haya estado bien lo que hiciste, tens tu grado de culpa.

En cuanto a que padeces de soledad y depresion no fue este hecho seguramente lo que la marca, los traumas suelen remontarse a situaciones mas de anta?o, y seria muy conveniente que consultaras a un profesional.

342344f0c3bee89c64f9516d839a4e2baa	the best way to lose weight in the gym is to use machines like the running machine or bike machine as they tend to burn fat and calories quicker then most others. the bike is great for legs the running machine is great for legs and the stomach. instead of running try walking fast uphill this tends to burn more calories then running. diet wise fruit and veg all the way. meats good chicken or fish is best (less fat) when not fried that is.also try to eat brown rice, bread and pasta it will fill you up for longer and try to eat it as early as possible then you have longer during the day to burn it off. dont say no to food you love to often either you will just crave it more. if your a chocolate lover try dark chocolate it normally crushs the sugar craving quicker. good luck|`|cfd58f7f882fb4ab349c3dbaf13074baaa	weight loss is easy  heres the key  eat less...exercise more|`|1ecf4adf6a06152c28d74c321af1fe77aa	well well.... if you wanna lose 20 kilo in 2 weeks, you can follow my formula    1) From your normal 3 meals a day, make it 6 meals a day!(no joke) and reduce the amount you normally eat by 2/3. which means you only eat 1/3 of your normal meal consumption. (this has to be strightly followed!)    2) There are 7 days a week, 6 days are to be used to work out and day for total rest!    -day 1 and day 4 are used to work out your hands like bicepts and tricepts  -day 2 and 5 are used for your shoulder and back  -day 3 and 6 are used for your chest and your leg    3) Everyday before any exercise, you need to run minimum 3 mile on a threadmill and half hour of cycling    4) After each day work out, you must do 150 x sit up  50 each time (do it slowly)    5) Everyday after your exercise go for steambath or sauna    6) Since Sunday will be your off day, eat all you want!    take suppliments like l-carnitine from Wader! Durind day 1-6 always remember no fatty food! expecially pizza or fried food!~    I suggest you to take milk and bread! Just bear for it fot 2 months! and you will see the result!
dc77a0259ecd837cc49537696fbec4e7aa	My husband was diagnosed adult ADD last year. He couldn't focus, low energy level, couldn't follow through with jobs, short attention span, no interest in anything. He was prescribed Adderall, a medication similar to Ritilan, both an amphetemine based drug. It works very well for him, but I caution you, these types of drugs need careful monitoring, as they can be easily abused and or addictive. There are other non-amphetemine based ADD medications too, such as Strattera or Concerta. I urge you to discuss this with your physician, and by all means, explain these concerns to your professors. Also, there should be no problem with using this medication with an anti-depressant, such as prozac. Perhaps your doctor has misdiagnosed you, after all they are only human.|`|ddfccc9ff13a03a9c74364c90d3cf7b8aa	That's really a tough call.  You're displaying all the classic symptoms of adult ADHD, but research suggests that adults who have ADHD actually had ADHD as children but never completely outgrew it.  You said you have had these symptoms for years -- if you've had them since puberty or before, chances are you have adult ADHD.  If not, it's hard to tell.    Question for you:  How have you been sleeping?  If you're not getting enough sleep (and not getting enough QUALITY sleep) you'll develop the same symptoms you listed.  If sleep is a problem, you can try taking valerian root (with or without hops) and you may also want to try holy basil extract, which would also help with your other symptoms.  You can get these things at Vitamin World.  If you have SERIOUS sleep problems (like me), ask your doctor to prescribe Ambien or Lunesta for you.    Good luck!|`|AA10810303	There can be a lot of symptoms.

I know if you went to FIA they would be able to help you.  I stay in Michigan, and there's a hospital that people with no insurance can go to.  Sign up with FIA as soon as possible, because once you are signed and accepted you will be approved from the date you signed up.  So even if you have to go to an emergency room, once FIA is approved all you have to do is give them the medical card number, so you won't be stuck with the bill.

ea998e6d5375bd90056eb379d9dd22ceaa	Healthy Eating  Research has shown that following a healthy eating plan can both reduce the risk of developing high blood pressure and lower an already elevated blood pressure.    For an overall eating plan, consider the DASH eating plan. "DASH" stands for "Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension," a clinical study that tested the effects of nutrients in food on blood pressure. Study results indicated that elevated blood pressures were reduced by an eating plan that emphasizes fruits, vegetables, and lowfat dairy foods and is low in saturated fat, total fat, and cholesterol. The DASH eating plan includes whole grains, poultry, fish, and nuts and has reduced amounts of fats, red meats, sweets, and sugared beverages.    A second clinical study, called "DASH-Sodium," looked at the effect of a reduced dietary sodium intake on blood pressure as people followed either the DASH eating plan or a typical American diet. Results showed that reducing dietary sodium lowered blood pressure for both the DASH eating plan and the typical American diet. The biggest blood pressure-lowering benefits were for those eating the DASH eating plan at the lowest sodium level (1,500 milligrams per day).    The DASH-Sodium study shows the importance of lowering sodium intake whatever your diet. But for a true winning combination, follow the DASH eating plan and lower your intake of salt and sodium.        http://www.nhlbi.nih.gov/hbp/prevent/h_e...|`|AA12308795	See this webpage for healthy foods.

As for yourself, try to get a R.M.R. reading at your local gym.

Using that metric as a guide, to burn 10 lbs of fat (I'm assuming you want to reduce fat mass, not muscle mass; the latter isn't very healthy) in 14 days means you have to create a calorie deficit of about 2500 calories per day. So in other words, if for your age, weight, and level of activity you require 2700 calories per day to maintain your current weight, you would have to reduce your net daily caloric intake to 200 calories per day for the next 14 days. So you would have to either maintain your level of activity and eat 200 calories per day, or somehow increase your level of activity so that your daily caloric requirement increases by a certain amount and eat less calories, so that again, your net daily caloric intake drops by 2500 calories.  If you require LESS than 2500 calores per day (which most women probably do), then your only choice would be to increase your caloric output so that you would be burning at least 2500 calories/day, and probably not eat very much.  The "3500 calories/lb" is only a guideline, but unless you have an extremely high daily calorie requirement, there probably isn't a very healthy way to lose that much weight in two weeks, and I've heard that except in extreme cases it's not a good idea to try to lose more than a couple lbs/week.|`|c325c87253650ac692a2873061231518aa	i have been trying to lose 10 pounds too. i started using hoodia green tea 10 day diet.  get it at cvs. its 9.99 and it works. i lost 4 pounds in one week!! try it.

GFhocHr8aa	It depends on your skin's elasticity (which changes with age), how much weight you've lost, and the amount of time in which you've lost it.    You can prevent it by making sure you're losing weight gradually - fad diets that allow you to lose weight quickly will make you more likely to have loose skin. It also helps to exercise regularly at the same time as you eat healthier foods so your skin stays toned even as you're losing weight.|`|VSWl45cKaa	How can you worry about loose skin and then say you are 'loosing' weight? (seen frequently on YA). The verb is 'to lose' so you would be 'losing' weight.     Skin has a certain elasticity and it tends to tighten up after the pressure of extra weight is removed.    Here is some information from a Fitness Trainer:    http://www.bodyfatguide.com/LooseSkin.ht...|`|m6WYEPMUaa	It cant.

It depends on how much weight you are losing. and yes it is true it does happen to alot of people who lose large amounts of weight.I'm not sure it can be prevented i could be wrong but i really don't think there is anything you can do to prevent it|`|nMR5TfGAaa	In my opinion, the benefits outweigh the risks on this.  You are doing your health a better service to lose much weight, your organs will function more efficiently, not to mention high blood pressure, diabetes, etc.     If you lose weight slowly, excercise and moisturize the skin should maintain some elasticity and snap back.  It depends on how old you are and how much weight that you plan on losing.  If you plan on losing more than 50lbs you will have some excess skin.      I had a friend who lost 150lbs in 18 mos on the Atkins diet(at 29) - his skin gradually returned its elasticity but he still had an 'apron' on the front after a year or so.  It wasn't bad looking at all - although I didn't think the diet was healthy at all.  He had plenty of hot dates and a busy social life.  Good luck to you - and don't worry about the skin, you'll be so much better off!    ps. you can always get a tummy tuck at the end if you really want.  you'd be surprised how many men get lipo & tummy tucks.  no worries!|`|uZr4eBz2aa	ya
AA10551261	Swallow air or eat,drink fast.|`|73aef20bbfec3e557dbc85ee30cc3c5aaa	A hiccup or hiccough (normally pronounced "HICK-up") is an involuntary spasm of the diaphragm; typically this repeats several times a minute. The sudden rush of air into the lungs causes the glottis to close, creating the "hic" noise. A bout of hiccups generally resolves itself without intervention, although many home remedies are in circulation that claim to shorten the duration, and medication is occasionally necessary. By extension, the term "hiccup" is also used to describe a small and unrepeated aberration in an otherwise consistent pattern. The medical term is singultus.    While many cases develop spontaneously, hiccups are known to develop often in specific situations, such as eating too quickly, taking a cold drink while eating a hot meal, eating very hot or spicy food, laughing vigorously or coughing, drinking an alcoholic beverage to excess, or electrolyte imbalance. Hiccups may be caused by pressure to the phrenic nerve by other anatomical structures, or rarely by tumors and certain kidney disease. It is reported that 30% of chemotherapy patients suffer singultus as a side effect of treatment|`|eec8931a40932c706d901901b3e77ad0aa	when u drink water swallow it with air? that worked for me try drinking water and getting air in between its dangerous getting hickups when u have ashtma though..|`|AA10847080	I get hiccups everytime I eat chilly food.

k1Dm9h9Caa	La hipoglucemia puede aparecer por varias causas:    ? Dosis de insulina o hipoglucemiantes demasiado alta.   ? Saltarse una comida.   ? Ejercicio fsico prolongado o intenso.   ? En los no diabticos, las circunstancias que pueden producir hipoglucemia incluyen ciertos tipos de tumores, la ingestin de alcohol o el comer poco.      SNTOMAS    Las reacciones de insulina ocurren ms frecuentemente en los diabticos que se inyectan insulina, aunque estas reacciones tambin pueden ocurrir en los que toman antidiabticos o hipoglucemiantes orales. Los sntomas varan de una persona a otra pero los ms comunes son el temblor, el adormecimiento y el cansancio. Muy a menudo aparece una transpiracin fra. La piel est plida y tambin se dan nerviosismo, mal humor, visin borrosa y sensacin de temblor en las manos y pies.    Si la hipoglucemia no se corrige, seguirn otras sensaciones como dolor de cabeza, confusin, adormecimiento, dificultad al andar, nuseas, taquicardia etc. Para el observador, el diabtico con una reaccin de insulina, aparece frecuentemente confuso y rudo as como poco cooperativo. Lo peor es la escasez de coordinacin. Es como si estuviera intoxicado. En los casos extremos aparece inconsciencia y tambin convulsiones, sobre todo en los ni?os.     SOLUCIN  En casi todos los casos, la ingesta de un terrn de azcar aliviar los sntomas en 10  15 minutos. Tambin se alivian los sntomas tomando un vaso de zumo de naranja, una bebida templada que contenga azcar, un bombn o un trozo de pastel. Si los sntomas no desaparecen se debe consumir otra vez algo de comida dulce. Cuando los sntomas se hayan calmado, hay que consumir comida adicional para prevenir una recada. Las reacciones de insulina suelen parecerse a los ataques de pnico. Analizar el azcar en sangre antes de cada comida ayudar a determinar si se trata de una reaccin de insulina o si es solamente la ansiedad lo que est causando los sntomas.     RECONOCER LOS SNTOMAS  En casi todos los casos, la ingesta de un terrn de azcar aliviar los sntomas en 10  15 minutos. Tambin se alivian los sntomas tomando un vaso de zumo de naranja, una bebida templada que contenga azcar, un bombn o un trozo de pastel.

ASISTENCIA URGENTE  La reacciones de insulina deben tomarse en serio. Si se reconocen los sntomas y se tratan pronto, desaparecen enseguida en la mayora de los casos.  De todas formas, si aparece inconsciencia ser necesario administrar una inyeccin de glucagn subcutneo o glucosa endovenosa.

This is the same reason why, when you have a cold, your food tastes different.    So if you eat an apple or an onion (while holding your nose) both the apple and the onion will taste the same (since you cannot smell the difference).    I hope this clears your query.

fWwmSQEsaa	It depends on the level of soreness.  If you can't move the next day or are in pain, don't exercise.  You just put microscopic tears in your muscles and have plenty of lactic acid build up.  If the soreness is slight or moderate and you can function normally, then go ahead.  It's even beneficial.  There is no minimum or maximum of correct number of situps or pushups.  If you want to tone what you already have, do less weights and more reps.  If you want to bulk up then add more weight and do less reps.  The saying, " no pain, no gain" is not accurate either.  You should stop at the point of fatigue, not pain.  Pain is your body's way of letting you know that what is happening is detrimental to your health.|`|3c99d83fcc36188ae968d825cb61b0e7aa	you say you "need" more muscles.... why? is it a job requirement?     or do you "Want" more muscles?  which is fine, I'm just curious.    yes it's ok to workout when you're sore, in fact some studies suggest that's the best thing to mitigate soreness. no there's not a max, except that when you overdo it you dramatically increase the risk of injuring or tearing something.    besides... the gains happen when you're resting and recovering... if you don't rest and recover, you just get more tired and grumpy and injured.  seriously, you will improve faster if you take a rest day between hard workouts.|`|8JbOJ9ooaa	I work specific groups on certain days, and let them rest the following day.    So:  day 1 - biceps and benchpress  day 2 - rest, squats and situps  day 3 - rest, biceps and benchpress etc. etc.    If you want to build muscle, you need to start consuming more protein in your diet; otherwise, you're just toning your muscles.

AA12308795	Nourish your body thin, instead of starving your body fat. Good carbs like celery and carrots will never make you fat. Bad carbs like cake will, but you don't need to know the whole science of glycemic load. You need to re-learn how to eat so you can become thin and healthy. Salt has no calories but makes you fat and burning more calories does not help this fatness.    Find out about fastest way to lose weight, most effective exercise, good and bad fats, water retention and secret trick used by models to flatten their tummy before an event. Reading a book will take you hours but the information on a post, taking minutes to read, is not enough. The webpage below has just enough to know what you need to know. Links page has gov. BMI calculator to find out just how much overweight you are (teens plug in your age to compare to others your age).    You can force your body to lose weight with not enough calories, but if you continue it, you will starve to death. With an abundance of healthy foods, you lose weight just as fast, but only until you reach your ideal weight. You can continue eating this way the rest of your life and always be at your ideal weight.    http://www.phifoundation.org|`|AA10793254	In my opinion the two best diets that are the quickest and safest are:    Dr Atkins diet. Its great for shedding weight quickly although I find it limiting as in its mainly protein as in meat and eggs and does include only 20 grams of carbohydrates a day as in vegetables. No bread, no pasta, no potato, no rice etc    I find Carb Curfew by Joanna Hall to be a diet that works and one that I can stick to for a longer period. It means you can have 30 grams of cereal with skim milk and a piece of fruit  or 150mls fruit juice for brekky. Mid morning 150grms of at least 97% fat free yoghurt and a piece of fruit. An open sliced meat and salad sandwich for lunch and a piece of fruit or 150mls fruit juice. A piece of fruit for afternoon snack.  And strictly no carbohydrates as in bread, pasta, rice and potatos/sweet potato after 5pm. For dinner you can have120grams of lean meat with any veges and a piece of fruit or 150grams of fruit juice.     In Dr Atkins diet they want you to drink decaffinated tea or coffee and use splenda and cream as milk and in Joanna Halls diet you can have two cups of tea or coffee a day with low fat milk and some sugar replacement. I cant be bothered buying special milk for diets. I buy full fat milk for everyone and pour it into a little jug and fill it half way with milk and the other half with water. It doesnt end up being like water that way and only contains half the original fat.    Its great because with both diets you dont feel hungry. You must drink at least 2 Litres of water a day and if you exercise the weight loss is quicker because it also builds muscle and tones your body. I separate the water throughout the day for eg. 500mls at brekky, 500mls at smoko, 500mls at lunch, 300mls at smoko and 200 mls at dinner so you wont be up peeing all night.    Hope this helped. If you would like I can email you either full diet.  hot_oz_e_chik@yahoo.com    Cheers|`|b7dc2f6f160af3d21e44169f36d81e7faa	The fastest way is to take the alkaline liquid diet.    Fats are nothing more than stored acid. If you continue to take acidic food, even with exercise you cannot get rid of fats. Therefore you must solve the weight problem at the source : eating acidic food. By taking alkaline food, you prevent the intake of acid to create more fats. Besides doing exercise, you must eat only alkaline food.  Read the book "pH miracle for weight loss". See photos of people losing weight at ease. If you want to loose weight super fast, there is an alkaline liquid diet. According the book, people are loosing 10 pounds or more within the first 8 days. Go to the website below to see which food (and even fruits) that are acidic.

PY05wMEwaa	Bloating  The main cause of bloating is air. More specifically, either air that is swallowed during eating or exercising, air produced by your own body in reaction to high-fiber foods or air in air containing foods such as ice cream. Many times, what people believe is fluid retention is actually bloating.    The following tips may help bloating. Chew your food slowly. The more slowly you eat, the better your food is broken down, the less likely you are to suffer from gas caused by swallowing air.    Avoid bloating foods. Raw vegetables, cabbage, beans, bagels and pretzels (which are cooked in boiling, bubbly water), dairy products, sugars and chocolate also are bloat-producers.    Neutralize gas producing foods. Beano, available over the counter in liquid or tablet form, is a liquid enzyme that breaks down the indigestible sugars in foods. Simethicone and Charcoal are other over the counter products that can help bloating.    Finally, exercising (without gulping air) can help alleviate bloating.|`|ee8e8c18fa17d461a824ec2f91d835b7aa	Try exercise all durring the month...

En caso de que hubiera ingesta de alcohol, varia la apreciacion de la medicion de glucosa dependiendo el tipo de bebida.  Por ejemplo; Tequila, ron, brandy, cerveza, y sobre todo; vino tinto son altos en azucares y pueden llegar a demostra hasta 10 puntos porcentuales por encima.  El vodka, ginebra, son mas bajos de azucar y se demostracion porcentual puede ser de 3 o 4 puntos.    saludos|`|keCBbMBQaa	puede alterarlo.. antes de hacer un examen de sangre tenes que tener por lo menos 24 hs sin ingerir bebibas alcoholicas!        suerte!  =)|`|cd5be531ecc6a76a65e312e5bdbad70caa	Desde luego que s.

Think of it as curling a can of soda, you might get to where you could curl it 1,000 times, buts it's not going to make it easier to curl 60 lbs.

Zmx40Nnpaa	Sounds like it.  Has she always been this small or has she recently lost a significant amount of weight? She may have an eating disorder.  I suggest talking to your parents and also to your sister, tell them you're worried, and suggest she see your family doctor.  He will be able to tell you parents the medical risks of her low weight, and offer some treatment options.|`|q2ul38GQaa	Well I would say yes but if she is a gynmast or an athlete this could be expected. I am no expert but I think 28kgs is still kinda unhealthy so I would reckon she should put on some weight.

If she hasnt always been so skinny its up to your parents to have her checked. If she has always been thin like that, it may just be the way she is built. If she is losing weight she needs to go to the doctor.
ed21ef56a0d9d0d5603710d497c84f4eaa	Love handles are a very difficult body area to tone up and keep toned.  It is especially difficult for women because it is natural for women to store a lot of body fat in the hip area. Be sure to eat healthy and always stay hydrated.  Staying hydrated is more important thinking.  When your body is dehydrated, your metabolism slows down.  Drinking a lot of water is a great way to boost your metabolism/   I have found that walking or using an elliptical machine has worked wonders for my love handles.  Look up "oblique exercises" on Yahoo.  Do a few sets of those exercises daily, and try to incorporate at least 30 minutes a day of walking or using an elip. machine.  If you can't seem to find the time for 30 minutes. break it down into three shorter workouts, which can also work wonders for your metabolism.  Good luck with losing them..but just remember, a curvy body is a beautiful body, and I am sure the majority of guys actually find your love handles very sexy..keep that in mind!  Have a great day :)|`|Ihwo2BLbaa	Hide it then !    1. Wear black colour near your stomach area.    By wearing black you are able to disguise the love handles in your stomach. This can work better if you wear something with other color above your abdominals area. For example you can wear a shirt with two colour, the top color would be brighter than the below. If you are wearing a gown which exposes a large area of your shoulder then wear something on your neck. Basically you will want to divert the attention of the onlooker to the upper part of your body.    2. Don't wear a tight top.    This is obvious but yet some people still wear a tight top and complain about how fat they are. Well, you might want to try a "not so tight" cloth to hide your love handles. They are not there to be loved either.    3. Develop a muscle in your arms.    I am not saying that you should have protruding muscles from your arm, but definitely a tight arm would be helpful in hiding those love handles. It's easier to lose fat in arms and shaping it up rather than losing the love handles. By having nice arms you are diverting people attention to your upper part of your body again. Helped with the proper colour this can work wonder.    4. Wear belt    You should always wear belt to help hiding up your love handles. This is true because belt will add another thickness to your stomach area and give an impression that it's your belt which is thick and not your love handles.    5. Sit-ups exercise    Sit-ups exercise is easy and can be done in your home. This exercise does not take a lot of time either. While sit-ups train your abdominal so that you will have tighter stomach muscle.|`|ee8e8c18fa17d461a824ec2f91d835b7aa	Accept the love handles and use them to your advantage...
