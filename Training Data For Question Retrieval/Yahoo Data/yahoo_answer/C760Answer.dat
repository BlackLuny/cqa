A slim jim glass is a straight tumbler which comes in various sizes so I guess you could use them for gin & tonic or small beers.  The hock glass is traditional for serving German Riesling wine. We call it "hock" because it's from Hocheim.  The flute is the tall Champagne glass as opposed to the bowl type glass (allegedly modelled on Marie Antoinette's breasts) that was popular in the 60's. The flute helps keep the champagne sparkling. So you can serve Champagne or Champagne cocktails in them.  A Pilsener glass is a stemmed glass with a large bowl and I don't think you would serve anything other than lager in it.    Hope this helps... Cheers!

8WdFnf0Eaa	It depends on the part of the country, or which country you are in.  Here in the States, it can either be a corkscrew or the strainer that goes on the top of a martini shaker to keep the ice from going in the glass.  The strainer is called a spiral far more often.    Unless you are talking about a fruit spiral or "twist" which is just the rind of fruit, usually a lemon, is run around the rim of a glass and twisted into the drink.

JgNjdsqOaa	Most likely the best beer worldwide is the Pilsner Urquell. Pilsner, because it is brewed in Pilsen, a city in the Czech Republic. No wonder that thousands of beers from abroad like to call themselves Pils, Pilsner or Pilsener. But there is only one Pilsner - namely the one from Pilsen. Another one is the Budweiser. Not the American, but again the Czech Budweiser brewed in the town of Budweis. The US Budweiser has nothing to do with beer, neither do the other American beers with the exception of Sierra Nevada from California and Samuel Adams from Boston . Have no idea what the US Bud is made of, but it is not even close to a real beer. To explain that: Czechs are the greatest beer drinkers worldwide with 170 liters per capita and year (approximately 340 pints) includind the newborn and the nearly dead, men and women alike - it is a tradition here. Other drinks like wine, soft drinks and booze are practically marginal. Come and see... :-)|`|CGnL2nS0aa	As far as the best...that is relative to the drinker.

I made a roast this weekend with a can of coke and a package of onion soup mix.......a friend had suggested this to me and I was not to sure but I tried it and it was wonderful and so simple to make.       the recipie below was taken from Taste of home,s website    http://www.tasteofhome.com     **************************************...  Apple and Onion Beef Pot Roast    METHOD: Slow Cooker    TIME: Prep: 30 min. Cook: 5 hours + standing    Ingredients:   1 boneless beef sirloin tip roast (3 pounds), cut in half  1 cup water  1 teaspoon seasoned salt  1/2 teaspoon reduced-sodium soy sauce  1/2 teaspoon Worcestershire sauce  1/4 teaspoon garlic powder  1 large tart apple, quartered  1 large onion, sliced  2 tablespoons cornstarch  2 tablespoons cold water  1/8 teaspoon browning sauce   Directions:   In a large nonstick skillet coated with cooking spray, brown roast on all sides. Transfer to a 5-qt. slow cooker. Add water to the skillet, stirring to loosen any browned bits; pour over roast. Sprinkle with seasoned salt, soy sauce, Worcestershire sauce and garlic powder. Top with apple and onion. Cover and cook on low for 5-6 hours or until the meat is tender.       Remove roast and onion; let stand for 15 minutes before slicing. Strain cooking liquid into a saucepan, discarding apple. Bring liquid to a boil; cook until reduced to 2 cups, about 15 minutes. Combine cornstarch and cold water until smooth; stir in browning sauce. Stir into cooking liquid. Bring to a boil; cook and stir for 2 minutes or until thickened. Serve over beef and onion.

I always start the meat out on high and after an hour or two switch it to low, but the total cooking time is almost always at least 8 hours.
hHQIUrNjaa	camel crush has the most menthol. You light it, take a drag, crush the filter which has a ball of menthol, and then smoke it like any other cigarette. If you roll the filter in your fingers it enhances the menthol...its like smoking a cough drop with tobacco flavor, but they are kinda kiddy cigarettes because they get annoying after a while.    also it depends on where you live. Deleware its like $2.50 a pack because theres no tax. Also, never smoke newports their filters are made of fiberglass.|`|3s59vsLNaa	You can probably save yourself a lot of money by just using the money you want to spend on cigarettes on gas for your car.  And when you get drunk suck on the tailpipe while the car is idling.      Now you may be thinking you'd be wasting money while the car is idling...  Not really!  Because gas is more efficient at low speeds, especially at idling positions.      Also, if your thinking smoking a tailpipe is crazy, just blame it on being drunk, like you do with smoking cigarettes, because both are the butt of something, both are crazy (because crazy is crazy) and both have, perhaps, the same result; except you're, technically, being more efficient by using your money on gas.      But then you have the global-warming issue...  What a slippery slope either way.  Honestly, though, there is no such thing as a casual smoker.  Crazy is crazy like a smoker is a smoker.  It will get out of hand and you will likely find yourself in a situation that really sucks.  But if you really don't care, then...don't complain and expect pitty later when you get sick often (coughing up crap), the medical bills start piling up and you don't smell and taste your food like you used to...etc., etc.|`|95338b015043271c6167082a68ef5e88aa	Salems?|`|axxQzOCHaa	Lungdestroyer    It's not cheap though, it could come at the cost of your life eventually.

This microwave popcorn is definitely my favourite, and the favourite of all of my customers--I sell an average of $2500-$3000 of this each year, with my top being over $5000 one year. I'm not saying this as a sales pitch, I'm saying that this Trail's End popcorn really is the best stuff there is.

The FDA has standards, and if the food was not up to code.. then the company would lose the case, or whatever.<br>  <br>  He told us that he can no longer eat peanut butter. He explained that the FDA allows bug parts etc in lots of foods including cereal, ketchup, and chocolate, but the largest amount they allow was in peanut butter. He said that he didn't mind the bug parts, but his problem with peanut butter was the rat droppings. Apparently rats climb into the machines all of the time, and it's hard to stop it. He told us that the FDA determines the allowable amount based on what the food looks like, and whether or not you would be able to notice.

hP2nzb2haa	Decorating your glow in the dark party is pretty simple.You will need to buy some black lights from your local dollar store, as many as possible is recommended. Replace all regular light bulbs with the black lights for the party.<br>  Your party be in the evening, but if you want it during the day, pick up some plain black sheets and drape all windows and doors with the sheets to keep the daylight from entering your party atmosphere.<br>  Along with your black lights, if it is possible to get strobe lights or a disco ball, go for it! Add a very fun impact to your dance floor. <br>  Also, make sure that the balloons, streamers and confetti are all white or lime green so that they will glow in the black lights. white balloons are the best, just put the glow stick (snap it on) inside the balloons and tie-it with a string around the wall or up from the ceiling.<br>  Buy some glow in the dark paint that is invisible unless it is dark and make loads of banners to put on your walls. Let guests paint on the banners if they'd like. Buy some big star glow in the dark stickers and stick them up on walls and your ceiling. There are tons of creative activities that you can have at your glow in the dark party. Also if you wish, buy some temporary neon hair dye and streak your guests hair to glow in the dark! Don't forget to buy some glow in the dark nail polish. tell friend to do the same, if they want to.Buy some white face paint and have your guests draw designs on each others faces! White will glow against the black lights very well.<br>  <br>  <br>  For guests, pick up some:<br>  * Glow sticks, and other glow jewelery<br>  * Glow in the dark sunglasses<br>  * White or neon hats for the guys and masks for the girls<br>  <br>  <br>  As your guests walk into your party, hand them all their glowing accessories. There are tons of glowing jewellery sold at your local dollar store or party supply store. Make sure that every guest comes to your party wearing as much white as they can! White glow in the dark.<br>  <br>  Food:<br>  Make sure that it is simple and not something that will require a lot of light to prepare. I would recommend to prepare any food before the party begins or order take out. Get some glow in the dark cups and ice cubes or just a white cups/plates/etc. Serve your guests like Lime Soda or Mountain Dew. Serve drinks with glow in the dark straws. Serve food on simply white party plates. <br>  <br>  Get black lights and ask everyone to wear all white. their clothing will definitely glow! It is a great idea to have a dance at your glow in the dark party. Mix some techno in with your favorite music. If you can, hire a DJ for the party. Dance the night away and have a glow stick limbo contest, neon hula hoops, hot potatoe with glow in the dark ball, play flashlight tag with glow sticks, and have "the best glow in the dark face paint". Just for fun get some glow in the dark blow up balls (like the beach ball) to throw around the dance floor.( Two are balls are perfect.)<br>  Have a great time!<br>  5 days ago|`|vttqurjjaa	I know this sounds kind of odd, but recently a big theme at my college is Barbie themed parties.  Where everyone dresses up as their favorite barbie (this can get really elaborate or stay cheap and easy).<br>  <br>  You can have really yummy food like pink cupcakes, a strawberry sherbet punch, dishes of candy.  The best thing about sleepovers is pigging out.|`|6SqxGQsqaa	since your bday is in march then i would suggest the tacky played out st patricks day theme. seriously. when i was a senior in high school i had this class and the teacher let me throw parties for the class. each month i themed the party to corrispond with its month. so march is for st patricks day. you could rent (or buy a chocolate fountain its like $25) and make rice krispie treats ahead of time and short bread and cookies  and pretzels and fruit to dip in your chocolate fountain.  if your house has a pool then you can go swimming.  you can make smoothies... music is a must, so whatever you and your friends love make sure to bump it! i honestly think food is important at a party so make sure you make things that your friends love.  maybe make some mint chocolate chip milkshakes! deviled eggs, potatoe salad...etc. have a bbq. 5 people sounds like a little, maybe you should invite more... the more the merrier.. you guys could do a photo shoot... if its a party i wouldnt dress all wierd and random unless its your thing. just tape a bedsheet to a wall and take funny pictures or cute pictures for myspace. lol. hope this helps.. happy birthday!|`|kjgonYlgaa	My daughter had a few reality show themed parties (Fear Factor 3 yrs and the amazing Race 4 yrs in a row) She's 16 now and I think she's planing another one for this year.  Some of the different ideas and challenges were:<br>  <br>  Fear Factor<br>  <br>       Take small jars (baby food size) or cups and put grose foods in them or really good foods disquised as someting sickening. place these on the floor or table and do ring toss to see who gets which one.  Be the fastest to drink or eat it to move on. <br>  Some good ones were: crumbled feta in water with pink food coloring, (pig brain), pine nuts in water w yellow colour (maggot larvea) tootsie rolls pulled and streched to resemble poo with mountain dew (pee) etc...(only one girl threw up, unfortunatly it was the pink goat cheese,back into her cup and handed it to me).<br>  <br>  fill your bathtub with a little water add a bunch of frogs and everybody sits in with them. (time this)<br>  <br>  Find the gummie worms in the cream pies.  Take pie tins and fill with piles of egg shells, coffee grounds, flour, chili pepper etc... put three gummie worms in each, and top with whipped cream.  (My daughter added a live worm to each tin, though I don't recomend this, It was quite funny).<br>  <br>  You can make up different things depending on where you live<br>  We live on a lake so we took out the boat pulling two tubes. they jumped from one to the other (wearing lifejackets and going slowly)<br>  <br>  The Amazing Race<br>  <br>  Different challenges and pit stops<br>  <br>  -Blow up and the deflate a beachball<br>  -make and fly a paper plane<br>  -Eat giant freezies<br>  -roll a peanut across the floor with yor nose<br>  -Carry a ball between two peoples heads<br>  <br>  There are so many different things you could do.  My husband and I and our other daughters, and grandparents ran the different pit stops.  She and her friends look forward to this every year.  Make a themed cake to go with your party theme.<br>  <br>  My 5 year old had a princess party this year, which could be adapted to an older girls party as well.<br>  <br>  Have a fun and happy birthday!!!<br>  <br>  And sorry about the spelling my checker won't turn on!
sDKCX43caa	Do it exactly the same way, once the peas get up to temperature the broccoli will do so also.<br>  Cut the broccoli into small flowerettes.<br>  <br>  I steam the broccoli over the spuds I cook ( I like it well cooked) and add my frozen peas to a pot of boiling water.|`|n5AXfWEfaa	The peas might burn before the broccoli is done. I would watch it closely.|`|z4Xpzm3xaa	put the broccoli when the pea is in that boiling water|`|YmwzubmFaa	when the peas starts to boil put on the broccolli|`|61a706a96992f304450dbded47628ddbaa	Listen to JoyaL. this is the correct answer!|`|AAGOEnD3aa	Broccoli takes longer than peas. Steam your broccoli first, than add your peas.  If you do the peas first, they will be mushy before the broccoli is done.|`|SAaEiqHvaa	yeah that will be fine.. just remember that the peas will cook quicker, and for best results, pull the broccoli out before it gets to soft.. cauliflower in there is good also..
2U1icUkLaa	Hi,<br>  It's really sweet of you to help out for her!<br>  Is it Irish that she likes or just clovers, because you could have Irish Music if she likes Irish Things<br>  Well, since she likes clovers, how about:<br>  Having a clover shaped Birthday Cake<br>  You can get "Lucky Confetti" which is green and four leaf clover shaped, and spread it everywhere<br>  Clover shaped/decorated biscuits, etc.<br>  Also, you could have sort of a Lucky theme because of Four Leaf Clovers, with funny traditions and things!<br>  Hope I helped!<br>  Have A great Time and Wish Your Aunt Happy Birthday From Me! XX|`|AA10391286	I'm a big fan of throwing themed parties, some of my past party themes included, Gilligan's Island where everyone dressed up as a cast away, flintstones party, Musical themed party where everyone had to dress up as a memeber of a musical cast, Book themed party where everyone had to dress up as a character from a book, Barbarian party were everyone had to dress up as a barbarian, the infamous Food pantry party where everyone had to build their costumes out of something you could find in your food pantry (that one was funny lol ) and my next party will be themed around my next favorite movie.  Maybe 27 dresses since I know its an all girl party and everyone can find a tacky brides maid dress for cheap in a thift store somewhere.<br>  <br>  Good luck!|`|6SqxGQsqaa	well of course since she loves clovers it would be wrong if her party was anything but GREEN.  a mint chocolate cake would be delicious.  food doesnt really have to fit into the clover theme that much, i mean, you could go all out and make everything resemble a clover, but i would just stick to the decorations... remember nothing to tacky from the dollar store, but keep it simple.  music should please your aunt and also the crowd.  if shes renting a hall will this party be in the night time?  if so decorations wouldnt really matter.  if shes really into clovers maybe you should chip in with other family members to buy her a clover shaped diamond bracelet or some kind of jewlery.  some thing nice. maybe she said that she didnt want it to be very kiddish meant that she didnt want a clover theme... its not like  its a suprise party or anything, so just clarify with her exactly what her ideas are..

Most canned food runs under a buck, is it really worth taking a chance? <br>  <br>  BTW: You may want to start dating your cans as you buy them. I write on mine with a Sharpie pen.|`|X2ZsYRNWaa	It can be safe for many years.  But many things don't taste so good after a few months.|`|vvoz2jeyaa	as long as there are no bulges, dents, or rust is should be ok for quite a while but if you dont know how old it is just toss it and buy some fresh. many foods get a strong metallic taste when they are kept in cans and it gets stronger as time goes by.

Some words you might look for are Sencha (Japanese), Jasmine (very fragrant) or Darjeeling (mostly Indian).

Soon this will become a real habit and there will be so many environmental cues if you keep going (making it more difficult to stop when you really need to). Right now I would say you are right on the border but alcohol can be very addicting...even if it is just for the taste. Hope this helps.|`|OLXv3DEAaa	You might be on your way to becoming one? Try cutting out all alcohol for a couple weeks and see how you feel. If you have problems doing that then you might be an alcoholic. <br>  <br>  Its not always a matter of how much you drink or how often, more why you're drinking and if you have problems with not being able to stop. You're kind of borderline 'drinking too much' even without any alcoholism though IMO. Why are you drinking every day? If its to relax or something thats kind of a bad sign.|`|ZB0393Kkaa	That's borderline binge drinking, but you're not an alcoholic at those levels. Pushing it though. <br>  <br>  If you drink because you enjoy it, then you really aren't an alcoholic either because you don't appear to be addicted to alcohol. If you had to stop immediately for any reason, could you? If you answered "yes," then you are not an alcoholic.|`|Wd1PmZuzaa	Only you can decide if you are an alcoholic. As for me psreonally I would hate  to know I drank every day even just one.  3 or 4 in one day is not that much but doing it every day is a bit much. Especially at your young age. You may not be an alcoholic right now but you do have a good head start on becoming a very heavy drinker in the future. I would hate to drink every week. don't get me wrong I like a good beer just a much as the next person. Like I said only you can decide but as for me that would be a lot.|`|nlIpKw8Paa	u drink 3-4 days in the moring and ur 19 im 19 i drink 3-4 beers in an hour alot ur no where close to an alcholic i am and proud of it.|`|GP1KPyekaa	no as long as your not getting **** faced every night
Ax54M1Dhaa	You can't get cancer from cigars or cigarettes.  Smoking increases your chances of getting cancer but its never the actual cause.  Cancer is caused by a mistake in cell division.  Though cigars are much less harmful then cigarettes, tobacco does have some tiny carcinogens present however they are minute and one is definitely nothing to worry about.|`|LnoyylQ7aa	lol|`|AA12000585	better to enjoy life with friends than to live life as scared as you sound, one cigar wont hurt, and an occational one is far from cancerous.and occational cigars are far less dangerous that a pack a day habit, with all the other chemicals added to cigarettes|`|b5IUOw1vaa	Cancer from one cigar...impossible.<br>  <br>  Cancer of the brain from being such a hypochondriac...that's more likely.|`|D6p979QMaa	one cigar won't do u anything dear...|`|gAWc48waaa	Just like it was said, enjoy life.<br>  <br>  First, NO. You can't get cancer from one cigar. There are no chemicals in cigars (it's just leaf and as natural as drinking tea) so the chance of getting cancer from cigars is so incredibly low that the Cancer Research Institute doesn't even have statistics for cigar smokers.<br>  <br>  I smoke 3 - 5 cigars a day, and I know many guys who smoke more, and have been for 50+ years.<br>  <br>  If you're prone to cancer chances are you're going to get it no matter what you do. Enjoy your life, enjoy the cigars, and have fun. Just don't inhale, they'll kick your *** if you do! lol

One cake pan holds about 20 pieces.<br>  <br>  Buy spinach.  Fresh spinach in bags.  Two or three bags should be good enough.  You can also buy boneless, skinless chicken breasts in a bag.<br>  <br>  Cook the chicken first.  Dice it up and add it to the ricotta and egg mixture.  Gunna need a lot of that as well.  One large tub makes enough for one lasagne.  Don't forget the moz cheese.  One bag grated moz to one large tub ricotta and one-two eggs (depending on the size-two small, one jumbo)<br>  <br>  I would also get a few jars of Ragu pasta sauce to make this easier and faster.  After you cook and dice the chicken, put with the ricotta cheese mixture.  Set in fridge to let flavors blend.<br>  <br>  There are two schools of thought on this.  One is precooking the pasta, and one is not precooking the pasta.  I quit precooking the pasta years ago.  You just have to add about 1/4C of water to your sauce.<br>  <br>  So, in your pans (one at a time, as you shouldn't bake all 5 at once) put in<br>  sauce<br>  pasta<br>  ricotta w/chicken<br>  spinach leaves<br>  sauce<br>  pasta<br>  ricotta<br>  spinach<br>  sauce<br>  pasta<br>  sauce<br>  moz cheese<br>  <br>  Should have at least two layers.

dv5swnKjaa	Why would you assume that the videos are "biased" and not merely shining light on the horror of slaughterhouses?  I'm just saying, if you're looking for all rainbows and sunshine, I'd start researching a different field.  Fact is, "by the book" for a slaughterhouse is still the mindless genocide of masses of animals.  That might be why it's hard for you to find a video that was put out by the USDA or the FDA, they don't necessarily want people to know what happens there because it might cause a drastic decline in meat consumption.  I'm trying to be unbiased, bear with me; I'm just saying that PETA has a vested interest in showing slaughterhouse procedures because they have more to gain from it than the meat industry does.  It's not necessarily that they're videos are biased or embellished, it's the mere fact that the truth isn't always pretty, ya know? ;-)<br>  <br>  And the irony of the post above mine is that Joaquin Phoenix is a HUGE activist for PETA. lol.|`|le0zdEmVaa	Earthings.

A2ibukHraa	first i would like to say to tim w-GET A LIFE!!!now for the real reason we are all here asking the parents to help donate to the trophy fund is not a bad idea and using the medallions is a great idea my softball team from the fall is wearing their medallions this spring-of course the boys might not like certain ones, but the ones we got look like a dog tag w/ a softball on it and the team info is engravedas far as the end of year party you could always do a pool party depending on where you live. or we did one at cici's pizza-much smaller and more intimate than CEC--instead of something that the parents wear make a penant flag for the parents to hold (out of felt etc) have the players help make the flags for the parents when they make the banner for opening day---have lots of fun and hope this helps!<br>  the ladybugs & the a's team mom|`|6ce70ad947a3b2245737910c52fd8c75aa	You should probably ask one question at a time. Reading all the questions takes way too long and it's like a bunch of rambling...sorry.|`|d6e483c1e8d0afa59b4948b0d62e9221aa	Well when ur at the tball field its not that hard to walk jus a lil bit to get some food!!|`|d933e4b97b43aa7bfb10ac2da32dceb4aa	It sounds like a lot of fun, but remember, it's about the kids, not the parents. So, keep it simple. How about medallions instead of trophies - probably a lot less expensive, and little guys love them. Year end party at the park definitely, not Chuckie's, as it will encourage the kids to play and the parents to talk with out flashing lights and annoying noises. Make a banner out of paint and a sheet held up with a couple of broom sticks or dowels. Have the kids do a lot of the painting. <br>  If the parents want to dress up for game days, how about just wearing t-shirts in the teams colour - only a couple of $$ for that. <br>  Bring freezies for after the game - win or lose - and frozen orange wedges are really refreshing. Have the parents each contribute toward the cost of the awards and end of season party, but remember, people have really different  abilities to afford things, so to avoid embarrassment, please keep it as simple and affordable as you can. 3-4 yr old kids are happy with the simple things in life.|`|de2a18e098e401eee577fadc002f8b67aa	For the banner contest I think you guys should put the team name on it and have all the kids draw something all around it. <br>  As for the trophies...Maybe you can ask the parents to donate money. Like $2-$5 per child a then you and the coach can make up the difference. Or you could hold a car wash or bake sale to earn the money. Some of the parents can help with setting that up. <br>  At the end of the season try having a bbq- hot dogs and burgers are really cheap, and if they are at the park they will have tons of fun. Chuck e CHeese is is wierd because there will be other children there and if they are at the park they can celebrate amongst them selves. it will be more fun for them to have that with each other. <br>  And for the parents to wear....I am a band mom and we made Buttons thet say the bands name and then it says Band mom really big, they can alos add on the name of the child.  If you sell these for $1 a piece you may earn the money you need for the trophies.

There really is a reason your mom keeps after you for this.|`|AA11042268	Probably 16 but they might accept 15 year olds as well|`|b84952072f1717a06d55c0d3787f6058aa	You have to be at least 17 to work at Gamestop.
AA11915664	pie- i LOVE pie|`|PxJXJKCpaa	That depends on what's being served.  I don't like choc cake or choc frosting, so I would pick pie.

53giV6PFaa	I preheat my oven to 450, then turn down to 325 when I put the bird in.  You roast it about 15-18 minutes per pound until temperature reaches 165.|`|PjW3Yo2saa	for me its unstuffed always<br>  totally wrap the bird in foil after seasoning<br>  set the oven for 300 and let it cook 18 to 20 mins per pound<br>  i use a thermometer and if its between 150 and 160 i take it out<br>  leave it wrapped a good 30 mins before serving|`|PxJXJKCpaa	If you don't have a thermometer, check for doneness by pulling on the leg.  The inner skin should rip and you should be able to almost pull the thigh off the bird.<br>  <br>  Lightly Salt and Pepper all the skin on the outside. This will help make the skin crisp! <br>  Don't place stuffing in the turkey! Stuffing plays havoc with cooking times and is a recognized health hazard. Cook your stuffing separately in a casserole dish and be safe. <br>  Place the turkey in a covered roasting pan place in the oven preheated to 475°F for 20 minutes. Our goal here is to "seal the bird" to help keep it juicy. <br>  Reduce the heat to 250°F. This again is not a typo! Don't let anybody tell you that the temperature has to be higher for it to get done. The reason that turkey is so often very dry is that it's overcooked. We want to slow cook the turkey. You do not have to remove the turkey from the oven. Just reduce the heat. Click Here to find out about concerns when slow-cooking a turkey. <br>  Cook the turkey at 250°F for 20 additional minutes for each pound. No basting is necessary. <br>  Many variables come into play when cooking a turkey. The only way to be absolutely sure that your turkey is fully cooked is to use a quality meat thermometer. Interior breast meat should be 170°F and 180°F for thigh meat. Using a meat thermometer is particularly important if you are roasting the turkey a high elevations since it will take longer but there is no rule of thumb to predict how much longer. <br>  Remove the turkey from the oven and allow it to rest uncovered for at least 20 minutes before carving it. This allows the juices to redistribute themselves inside the turkey making the turkey even more juicy, delicious, and easier to carve.
PxJXJKCpaa	You should invest in either tupperware or 2 gallon sized ziplock bags to protect your food.<br>  <br>  I'm sure once the food is cooked, the lavae will be dead and safe to eat.  You could just try to pick them out prior to cooking.  Lets say, rice.  Measure out the amount of rice you're making and spread it out on a cookie sheet first.<br>  <br>  I think I would rather eat a lavae then throw all my food out as well.  Sounds gross, but would rather not waste the money.  You can try this as well.  Put a large bowl of what ever the little buggers like best out for them to lay eggs in.  That might keep them out of the rest of your food.<br>  <br>  Good luck.  Hey, it's free protein, right?|`|Z9HjcET4aa	E-yuck! I can't stand bugs in my food so I feel for you. I had an infestation of mohts one time in my pantry and food, I later found it to be an open bag of rice. Anyway I had to clear out my entire pantry and throw away all the open containers of cereal chips, dog biscuits etc...Make sure to check the folds in plastic bags for larvae (yuk) too. They will be in every crevice you can imagine.  Then I wiped everything down with 409 and then sprayed in the corners. I also removed any shelves and wiped them down real good too. I left the pantry empty for about two weeks and would check inside a couple of times a day and killed more of those little buggers everytime they crawled out of their little hiding places. Agh! When I replaced my food I put EVERYTHING in zip lock bags. Even the unopened boxes (in case there were any larvae in them they would be conatined after hatching) and especially Rice a Roni which doesn't have an inner bag (?). That was about a year ago and they're now completely gone. Whew! They were the dickens to get rid of but I did it...with lots of 409 and patience. Good luck. Check out this site for more info:<br>  <a href="http://lancaster.unl.edu/pest/resources/..." rel="nofollow">http://lancaster.unl.edu/pest/resources/...</a><br>  AND FOR GOD'S SAKE DON'T EAT THEM!!!!! GAAAAACCCKKKK!!!!|`|t5fVLqvHaa	I wouldn't, and I'd lace the entire pantry with mothballs. And buy a buglight, put it in the area (inside the pantry/kitchen), and make the area as dark as possible so that the buglight is really predominant to attract them the best. Even if you have to use sheets to cover up doorways at night to keep light out of the area. Oh, throw all the food out. When you buy new food, put it in coolers (buy or borrow some), and put the food in there. If you run out of cooler room, put the rest in empty refrigerator or freezer space you have until the problem goes away. And put bug lights about 5-8 feet away from all outside doors and turn off any porch light, in order to defect them from your doorway.|`|A0nRQHDCaa	The reason your pantry is continualy being infected is because you havn't gotten rid of your food. You need to strip the entire pantry and throw away EVERYTHING that is already opened away.  Spray the pantry done with bug stuff and put up moth balls, I had the same problem with weavels...they wouldn't go away until we thrw away everything because they hide....everywhere.|`|YPH7Msp1aa	my family had ants in our food and we couldnt get rid of them so we moved.<br>  <br>  i wouldnt eat it anyway cause stomach acid might not kill the larvae.

vf5ZlnoXaa	Garbanzo - This is a very mild bean so it lends itself well to many flavorings.  I enjoy making them with an Indian curry yogurt sauce.  I also like to incorporate them into Greek or Italian dishes by using things like parsley, oregano, thyme, basil, parmesan cheese, and lemon juice.<br>  <br>  Black - Great in Mexican dishes...cumin, chili powder, chipotle, cilantro, and garlic.  It's a deep rich flavor so adding products with zest work nicely.<br>  <br>  White - Mild flavor much like Garbanzo beans.

nRIsTdfIaa	You need a great roomie who will cook for you both! and yes, Hamburger helper counts as "cooking"...<br>  <br>  I know this isn't exactly answering your question, but here's some ideas--<br>  <br>  Do up a box of mac&cheese according to the directions, but while the noodles are boiling, dice some ham into the boiling water (so it's hot along with the noodles)... or add some hot (formerly frozen) vegies- I like peas.<br>  <br>  Sometimes, I get a little fancy and add a can of chili to mac&cheese or a pound of hamburger and a packet of alfredo sauce (fixed according ot directions) to 2 boxes of mac&cheese.<br>  <br>  Honestly, cooking is about following directions, and practice.<br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  BTW- To actually answer your question- yes, it is because of portion sizes. Frozen dinners are dinky crap-sized portions... guess it's the balance to the super-sized situation in restaurants....<br>  <br>  Oh, and the Bertolli's thing- sure, two people's servings.. if that serving is a third of the meal (which technically, it should be- add a vegetable side dish and a salad or soup.. yeah). So don't feel too badly.|`|rz91gokWaa	You might have to suck it up and learn how to cook a few basic meals.   If you can cook hamburger helper by following the directions you can learn how to cook other more healthy meals also.   Frozen dinners and hamburger helper meals are very unhealthy for you!! look at the labels and check out the sodium and fat content...not to mention the ingredients!!

You can also google 5 ingredient meals where several will  be one pot meals.  good luck!!|`|oqiWY1QBaa	drink lots of water and eat salads. you will be full faster. you have to 3 frozen dinners becuz there is nothing to them except hidden chemicals..|`|DctftV7Maa	sounds like the fat content fills u up. but u often can cook a meal that's got less salt and fat then what a frozen dinner has.|`|RlPeaD8Qaa	yea probably! get a Hungry Man frozen dinner. they fill you up riiiiight;)<br>  <br>  dont be discouraged because of the name.|`|hHCdXq0Naa	Those frozen dinners are ridiculous in their portions!

Top with cut-up fresh tomatoes & lettuce.   Also, Lloyd's makes good BBQ beef & pork for sandwiches in refrigerated tubs.  Take out what you want; heat it up; snap the cover back on the tub and put in the refrigerator

Without yeast it just rots...rotting is not the same as fermenting.|`|BP417KT2aa	You don't always need yeast, whisky is made from grains.  It needs to be damp, warm and clean.  It will start to go rotten and ferment and that is effectively creating it's own yeast (bacteria).|`|bc7391b4b808e777ef9591a9fe946accaa	I am not sure what you are trying to ferment, but you need yeast.

LEdg6EHpaa	It depends on your tastes.  I liked beer even when I was a little kid.  If you are young, you'll probably want something sweeter.  Mixing vodka or rum with fruit juices goes down pretty easy.  But, it doesn't matter what you drink, if you drink too much you will get drunk and will puke. <br>  <br>  Know this:  It takes the alcohol some time to get into your blood system and be felt by your brain.  Pace yourself.  If you find something you like the taste of and start drinking a lot, you will drink too much, because you won't have absorbed what is in your stomach, so you brain is not registering the effects.  It takes about 30 minutes to absorb a drink on an empty stomach and up to 1.5 hours if you've eaten.  So, drink in moderation.  Learn to feel the effects of the alcohol and how quickly you feel them.  <br>  <br>  And don't drive while you are learning about how alcohol effects you.|`|n1Lz4NUIaa	If you don't want to get too drunk, drink something with a low alcohol proof.

To skin the tomatoes, nick the skin of each tomato with the point of a sharp knife, then put the tomatoes in a bowl next to the sink and pour over some very hot water from the kettle to cover. Count to 20, then carefully pour away the water. When the tomatoes are cool enough to handle, peel away the skin, halve the tomatoes, squeeze out most of the pips and juice into an empty bowl, and discard. Chop the flesh roughly and put it down on a plate to one side.<br>  2. Peel and finely chop the onion. Fry the onion in the vegetable oil in a large heavy-based saucepan over low to medium heat for about ten minutes, stirring from time to time so that it turns an even golden brown. Watch carefully to make sure it doesn't burn.<br>  3. Meanwhile, peel and finely chop the ginger and the garlic. <br>  4. Slit the chilli using a sharp knife. Slice the flesh away from the cluster of seeds in the middle. Avoid touching any part of the chilli with your fingers if you can, as it is very easy to get chilli in your eyes, and that will sting. You can use a fork to hold the chilli down or wear rubber gloves. Chop the chilli finely. <br>  5. Measure the ground spices into a teacup. Add the ginger, garlic and chilli to the pan, stir them around and fry for another minute or so. If you want your curry to be hot as well as spicy, include some or all of the chilli seeds. Then add the spices in the cup into the onions. Fry the spices for a minute or two, stirring all the time so that they do not stick. Add some salt and freshly ground black pepper.<br>  6. Pour in the water and the tomatoes, bring to the boil, turn down the heat a little and let the sauce simmer for 5-10 minutes.<br>  7. Add the chicken pieces to the pan and stir them around so they are covered with the sauce. Put the lid on the pan, turn the heat down and let the chicken cook for 30-40 minutes, stirring occasionally. Chicken thighs will take longer to cook than breast pieces. <br>  8. Now add the yoghurt to the chicken and stir it in. When the sauce is gently bubbling again, scoop up a little in a teaspoon, blow it cool and taste it. The sauce will probably taste quite sweet because of the tomatoes. Cut the lime in half and squeeze its juice into the sauce. Stir and taste again, and decide whether you want to add the second half.<br>  9. Finally, chop the fresh coriander leaves and sprinkle them on to the curry just before you serve it with the rice.<br>  <br>  |`|sDKCX43caa	Bacon and Egg Slabs<br>  Grease a rectangular oven dish and line with flaky pastry.

Add remaining ingredients. Mix well, and allow to sit for 15 minutes. The mixture thickens up.<br>  <br>  Drop by teaspoonfuls onto an ungreased cookie sheet.<br>  <br>  Bake for 15 minutes in the preheated oven, or until lightly brown.|`|AA10625089	You really need butter or shortening to make cookies. Sorry. Even the no-bake kind calls for butter or margarine.|`|qzrPR8eiaa	Chocolate Peanut Butter Cookies <br>  <br>  1 cup chunky peanut butter <br>  1/4 cup canola oil  <br>  1 1/4 cups of sugar <br>  2 eggs <br>  1 tablespoon vanilla extract <br>  1 cup all-purpose flour <br>  1/3 cup baking cocoa <br>  1 teaspoon baking soda <br>  1/2 teaspoon salt <br>  1/2 cup miniature chocolate chips <br>  <br>  <br>  In a large mixing bowl, combine peanut butter and oil. Add sugar; mix well. Add eggs and vanilla; mix well. Combine the flour, cocoa, baking soda and salt. Add to peanut butter mixture; mix until blended (dough will be sticky). Stir in chocolate chips. <br>  Drop by rounded teaspoonfuls 2 in. apart on ungreased baking sheets. Flatten slightly with a glass. Bake at 350 degrees F for 8-10 minutes or until set and tops are cracked. Cool for 2 minutes before removing to wire racks. <br>  <br>  <br>  I hope this helps!!|`|ISmAqcHmaa	Chocolate Cookies<br>  <br>  Ingredients:<br>  <br>  2 1/4 cups (9 ounces) confectioners' sugar<br>  1/4 teaspoon salt<br>  1 teaspoon espresso powder (I used instant coffee)<br>  1 cup (3 ounces) cocoa powder<br>  3 large egg whites<br>  2 teaspoons vanilla extract<br>  <br>  <br>  Whisk together the sugar, salt, espresso powder, and cocoa. In a medium-sized mixing bowl, stir together the egg whites and vanilla. Add the dry ingredients to the egg whites, and mix at low speed of an electric mixer for 2 minutes. The batter will seem dry at first, but will become shiny and smooth as it mixes. Cover the bowl, and refrigerate the batter for 3 hours, or up to overnight. <br>  <br>  Preheat the oven to 350°F. Thoroughly grease (or line with parchment) two baking sheets. Drop the dough in ping pong-sized balls onto the prepared baking sheets; a tablespoon cookie scoop works well here. (The dough is not like your typical cookie dough, but more like the consistency of store-bought cake frosting. It's sticky, you won't be able to roll it with your hands. A scoop would work really well, but if you don't have one, a rounded tablespoon coated with cooking spray works too.) Bake the cookies for 12 minutes, reversing the pans (top to bottom, bottom to top) midway through. Remove them from the oven, and cool on the pan for 5 minutes before transferring them to a rack to cool completely. Yield: fourteen big (3 1?2") cookies. |`|qyinteWyaa	peanut butter cookies<br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  1 egg, beaten<br>  1 cup creamy peanut butter<br>  1 cup white sugar<br>  1/2 cup chopped peanuts<br>  1 tsp. vanilla<br>  <br>  Preheat oven to 350.

Sausages have high fat.  http://www.truthinlabeling.org/Dang.html  The book ' Excitotoxins: The taste that kills'.

2b653b3adf15b210819908f23d249cc1aa	It's not nearly as much work as layered lasagna.......this IS lasagna, but rolled up instead of layered.    Bakes in much less time, and is easier to serve, you know how lasagna can be a pain to get out of the pan in one piece.....kind of slip-slides everywhere.....    This one is much less time, and is just as good, but a lighter form of the classic lasagna that you're used to.....    If you want to streamline it, you can ditch the sauce recipe here and just use your favorite jarred sauce instead of making the bechemal from scratch........

M5SkiSOzaa	I would try a Riesling.  Its a white wine that has more body than Pinot Grigio.  I think it has more variety in the bouquet which will be pleasant next to a traditional roast chicken dinner.  Maybe another you might want to try is a dry Chardonnay.|`|6dd9f8d90259c24d923f08e0666b6bcdaa	Three Thieves Bandit Pinot Grigio 2006|`|4b81a16cbb26c3702aa40a16058d31e4aa	My first choice with Chicken is white, however a good Pinot Noir is nice with chicken as well.    If you like a sweeter wine, then try a Reisling...   a Johannesburg Reisling is the best, but they are all comparable as it's a pretty simple wine.    Next, you may want to try a Pinot Grigio.  It's light and crisp and not an overpowering wine at all.  Try:  Principato  Rex Goliath  Ecco Domani  Robert Mondavi    Lastly, there's Sauvignon Blanc - one of my favorites.  This is a wine that's more complex that Pinot Grigio in the fact that it should be citrusy and a little more fruit forward.  Shale Ridge  Margeurite  Kim Crawford - my favorite!  Bontera Vineyards - close second!  Bogle    If you want to try something different that's a little closer to sweet than dry, try a decent Sancerre.  That's a great French white varietal.  Yum!    My personal opinion is that I'd avoid Chardonnay in this case unless it's a stainless steel aged Chard versus an Oaked one.    Enjoy!|`|ggSWODTRaa	any semi dry white wine med chilled|`|t0vuwuGXaa	This is a pretty easy wine pairing, as this is a pretty mild meal.  Stick with anything that doesn't have bold flavors, as you don't want to overpower the meal.  The only reds I would suggest with this would be pinot noir or a really light bodied rhone style blend.    Almost any white would complement this, but I would stay away from anything overly acidic, as it will cut through your taste buds and mask the chicken.    Whites for this: A chardonnay, riesling, pinot grigio, or almost any alsacian wine would do well.    Don't worry so much about the brand or winery, as different people have different tastes.  The only real important thing here is the varietal.    BTW, "Johanesburg" is a made up term.  It means nothing to the wine.  You may as well call it "magical riesling" as it has the same meaning.  There is no legal definition for the term, so it is useless.  Also, riesling is not a "simple" wine, as it greatly varies from dry and fragrant, to sweet and fruity.  I think the Germans or Alsacians would be very upset to hear it called "simple"!
AA10758468	A pint of Ben and Jerry's Chocolate Fudge Brownie ice cream has 4 102g servings. Since a quart is two pints you can say that a quart would have 816g. A kilo is 1,000g so that's roughly the size you're looking for.|`|XzLUA7ataa	There are 32 ounces in a quart, 16 ounces in a pint, and 8 ounces in a half pint, irregardless of what is contained.
