He did a year with Americorps (we live in CA) and worked in MD, New Orleans and in places in Mississippi- He only made about 3,700.00 so I doubt he owes anything. He was paid by the govrnt of course and they paid his SSN and such but I notice only about 10.00 on his fed taxes according to his W-2. Would he pay or send tax papers into CA? Doubt it as he didn't live here-and I'm thinking probably just file the paperwork as he wouldn't owe anyway. He's 21 yrs and back home in college now but he was gone all of 2008. TMI! ;0)

Thank you for all the information.

I would have dropped out of school had I gotten a job, so I don't feel it precludes me from collecting, but the window to report it has passed.  My question is:  when filing my taxes, if I claim a deduction for school fees - will the IRS report to Unemployment that I was in school?  There is no way for them to know the dates of my attendance really but I don't know if I should just forget the deduction to be safe or go ahead and claim it.  It makes a big difference on my return.

China’s rapid development has attracted worldwide attention in recent years, with the implications of its expanding influence and growing demand for energy supplies being hot topics for discussion both in China and abroad.      The study by researchers from the universities of Nairobi, Cape Town and Sussex revealed that African economies have a real chance of benefiting from their economic links with China as long as they boost their own capacities to match Chinese demands.      source: http://www.zoomchina.com.cn/index.php?/c...

I own 40% of a business in a small town 45 minutes from the town I grew up in. My business partner has total control of the money and rarely do I see any besides my paycheck. I run the business completely and cannot come up with the money to buy him out because I thought I would be making more than I am (profits, kickbacks). I've been in the business for twelve years and this is what I like doing. I can't get a part time job to save the money to buy his % because in my contract with the company I can only work here.  My fiancee has moved away to college and I really don't want to be here anymore. I have two kids in the town that's 45 minutes away. If I could get the money to buy his %, then I could sell the business and buy another somewhere else. Or I could go back to school and start all over but I am 33.  What the heck should I do????

I inadvertly left the acetic acid valved out at work which resulted in   the production of 30,000 pounds of non-terminated nylon chips when they should have been terminated chips. The control room technician had the alarm suppressed which would have revealed the error.  Another employee did the same thing twice and was not terminated.  This error cost the company over $30,000 for a six hour production run.Should the employer overlook this as human error.  Important, should they have installed a safety device to prevent this from happening since it has happened twice before in the past year.

I currently have a small hometown bank, which I love, but I am moving to another suburb and I work in Chicago, so I need something that has more locations and ATMs. I want something with no stupid fees and not a lot of hassle. I have narrowed it down to Fifth Third because they have the best location options relative to my office and my new home, and Bank of America because I really like the idea of the Keep the Change program, and their locations are pretty convienient as well. Does anyone have checking accounts at either of these, and have you liked it or had any problems?

Dise?e un instrumento electronic (Generador de Funciones) cuyo mercado son los Tecnicos e Ingenieros Electronicos. Segun mis calculo preliminares puedo ofrecerlo a un precio competitivo y con fabricacion nacional, ya que todos los que se venden en Argentina son importados. Sin embargo este tipo de instrumentos se compra una vez en la vida del ingeniero  o se tiene uno por laboratorio, no es algo masivo, por lo que quisiera hacer algun tipo de estudio para evaluar el mercado.      Como no es algo con mucha salida, necesitaría apuntar a un publico específico en todo el territorio argentino. Como debería hacerlo?      Muchas gracias. Adrian
