Maybe it COULD happen, but serious allegations like that require serious proof.      do you have a link to a credible news story about this?     yeah, thought not.    you don't know jack about me, Jack so don't be making assumptions....check my answers to see.  I just don't jump when people bark.  BTW, infowars and myspace don't count.  Out of all that crap you posted, abc and bbc are the only credible sources.      I should report you for calling me a republican, that's major insult  btw.  I'm a cynic, there's a huge difference ;-)      You're not going to convince me that the US government has convinced dozens of companies that are based in Japan and other parts of the world to start doing this. Sony and Toshiba have been strongarmed into doing this? That's what you're telling me?  Apple, one of the dogooder companies of the world, who has very close ties to the king of dogooder corporations, Google, is also doing this w/o a fuss? Knowing full well that it would be found out w/in months by the hundreds of thousands of people that are completely qualified to just accidently stumble accross this???      Your premise doens't make sense.  Then of course there's a VERY easy way around this, just buy them in Canada, or overseas, and you wouldn't have to worry about it.      There's no way, with the number of people involved (think about the assemblers, the engineers, and the programers....literally thousands of people would have to be in on this.  What are the odds that just a single individual wouldn't spill the beans with just 100 people knowing?  Then figure out the odds that somebody wouldn't fight back?  Google wouldn't even turn over their info when the government asked.  Then, what are the odds that an overseas company wouldn't exploit the information to do everything in their power to make sure that we knew about it, and at the same time allow them to capitalize on this.      The odds are so close nil, that it is effectively nil.

5bdc9c973a43242972b959b0a8f24d0caa	Incontestablement.  C'est incroyable qu'un candidat qui runit 20% des suffrages, qui plus est handicap par une couverture mdiatque trs infrieure aux autres grands partis voire carmement hostile, ne puisse pas se prsenter.  C'est des millions de fran?ais qui ne pourront pas s'exprimer alors qu'ils ont exactement le mme droit de le faire que leurs concitoyens qui font le choix d'autres candidats.  Cest un problme dmocratique trs grave et je suis tonn que ?a n'meuve pas grand monde, surtout ceux qui se gargarisent d'tre de grand dmocrates.  Le vrai problme est de savoir si les maires qui refusent leur parainage le font par conviction (minemment respectable) ou par peur de l'opprobre et du scandale (moins respectable mais je ne juge pas car les pressions sont peut tre fortes).    La vrai question est l chre steingrub 67:    si c'est simplement une question de conviction de la part des maires, alors l'atteinte  la dmocratie est moins grave car aprs tout, c'est la loi qui prvoit les 500 signatures, elle est la mme p?ur tous les candidats, on peut discuter le point de savoir s'il faut le changer, mais il y a galit entre les candidats.    si c'est que les maires qui veulent parainer le pen craignent des reprsailles s'ils le font, alors c'est un problme beaucoup plus grave car ?a veut dire qu'on muselle des millions de fran?ais pour "dlit d'opinion" de manire totalement arbitraire.  J'ai lu dans le nouvel obs (pourtant de gauche) que beaucoup de maire qui avaient accord leur parainage en 2002 avaient eu leur nom "livr en pature" donc je crois que malheureusement on se situe dans ce cas au moins en partie.    je ne vote pas fn et je combats ses ides, mais je trouve vette situation choquante, je ne sais plus quel philosophe fondateur des principes dmocratiques modernes (rousseau peut etre) a dit : "je combats vos ides mais je me battrai pour que vous puissiez les exprimer".

Et les journalistes qui en rajoutaient sur les enfant de moins de cinq ans qui dfilaient dans la rue sur les paules de leur papa alarm mais ? combien responsable, etc.   Non, il faut tre dreyfusien, - ou pas : il y a un moment dans une vie d'homme o il faut camper sur des principes : soit on veut la justice (et donc le traitement quitable de tous, pour tous), soit on dsire le bnfice particulier (clanique, corporatiste...).   En ce qui concerne la ralit de ces signatures, il y a  mon sens deux choses : une opration mdiatique de Le Pen probable, et un mot d'ordre gnral contre lui assez certain.        Vous voyez que je ne sais pas grand-chose...          J'ajoute  ce 1er message le fait qu'il ne faut pas confondre lois rpublicaines et dmocratie. Une dmocratie s'exprime  travers des lois rpublicaines - et dmocratiques - qui le sont plus ou moins. Le suffrage universel direct n'tait pas prvu par la Constitution de 1958 : c'est par un "coup d'tat" (permanent, disait Mitterand) que De Gaulle l'a instaur.

En ralit, lors du dpouillement, les votes blancs et nuls sont comptabiliss. Leur nombre apparait dans tous les procs verbaux.    Nanmoins, lorsqu'on voque les rsultats des lections, on parle toujours de pourcentages.    Le pourcentage des abstentionnistes reprsente le nombre de citoyens qui ne se sont pas dplacs divis par le nombre de citoyens inscrits sur les listes lectorales. Les votes blancs et nuls ne sont donc pas inclus dans le pourcentage des abstentionnistes, contrairement  ce qu'indique el bluffy ci-dessus.    Le pourcentage attribu  chaque candidat reprsente le nombre de votes en sa faveur divis par le nombre de suffrages exprims.    Autrement dit, mdiatiquement, les votes blancs et nuls n'apparaissent jamais : c'est ce qui pose problme aux partisans de la reconnaissance du vote blanc.|`|a4460342997f0546a5abe8c97bb2c63daa	Je ne suis pas persuade que les votes blancs soient pris en compte et effectivement, pour moi, soit tu mets le nom du personne dans l'urne, soit tu ne te dplaces pas !!

D'ailleurs lors des debats qui suivent les elections, les abstentions sont comptabiliss mais jamais les bulletins blancs et nuls.  Mais peut-tre est-ce d? au fait que la majorit des gens qui ne croient pas aux discours des politiciens s'abstiennent plut?t que de voter blanc.

Anyone with a modicum of common sense knows we could not round up all the illegal aliens at once.     However, we can round them up in smaller numbers, and over time, the cumulative effect of round-ups will have an undeniably deterrent effect.     Consider, for example, highway speed enforcement. Even the most stern, jackbooted cop knows he could not stop all speeders at once. So what does he do? Of course, he makes public examples of some speeders. The mere sight of someone being pulled over gives sufficient reason for the rest of us to slow down. This is enforcement by example. And it is precisely what we need in immigration enforcement.     In any case, no conservative worth his salt should accept the sequacious stance, held by the president and others, that legalizing those already here is the only practical solution. That is the same expedient the pro-amnesty crowd used in 1986. As everyone knows, that amnesty only made matters worse.     Since illegal aliens came here on their own, they should be made to leave here on their own. Call this self-repatriation. In effect, it is deporting them without having to formally deport them en masse. And it would be infinitely cheaper for the American taxpayers.        So, if we are to compel illegal aliens towards self-repatriation, then we must demagnetize the magnets that attracted them in the first place.        Hence, attention is needed in several key areas.      Worksite Enforcement:   For instance, in all of 2004, the latest year of available statistics, only three employers were fined for employing illegal aliens. Yes, just three. With over ten million illegal aliens and thousands of unscrupulous employers hiring them, are we to believe the government could only fine three?    Traffic Stops:   Since thousands of illegal aliens have drivers licenses (thanks to liberal license rules in several states) and many others simply drive without a license, traffic stops are the most appropriate place for immigration enforcement after worksites. In many cases, even when the driver is legal, the passengers are illegal, which makes on-the-road immigration enforcement a good countermeasure against aiding and abetting illegal aliens.     Police officers make about 17 million traffic stops a year. No one knows how many of those who are stopped are illegal aliens because it has been naively assumed that immigration status verification should be a federal responsibility. Thus, we waste about 17 million opportunities a year for discovering and apprehending illegal aliens.     Citizen Involvement:   If you have ever allowed someone whom you suspected was an illegal alien to work around your house, then you are part of the problem. Home building/remodeling is a thriving business for contractors. And many contractors now routinely hire illegal aliens. It thus behooves every American homeowner who is a voter who opposes illegal immigration to ask about the legal status of people that contractors bring in.      Asking such questions is citizen involvement at a basic level, and yet it has a force-multiplier effect. After all, if most of us ask such questions from contractors, the message we send will be loud and clear.        To recapitulate, strict worksite enforcement, status checks during traffic stops, and citizen involvement would create a milieu where life for illegal aliens would be incessantly difficult. In such a milieu, they would be compelled towards self-repatriation. After all, they came here to make money, and once that is no longer feasible, they will realize that returning home and waiting in line to come here legally is better than living here in incessant fear. And that is what we must create in them--incessant fear. Our leniency is what has emboldened them to protest in our streets.        Most of the illegal aliens have come in the last 10 years. Hence, the condign response is an enforcement regime that would make them repatriate themselves over the next five or 10 years.      For those who doubt that a strict enforcement regime will induce self-repatriation, consider what happened in the wake of the Special Registration program set up after 9/11. Under that program, foreigners from some countries were told they must register with the nearest immigration office or risk certain deportation if caught. Among Pakistanis, for instance, about 1,500 who were here illegally (on expired visas etc.) were caught and deported. Word spread. Before long, some 15,000 illegal Pakistanis hightailed out of the country on their own. They knew that formal deportation would decapitate their ability to obtain a visa in the future.        Needless to say, if illegal Pakistanis could self-repatriate to far-away Pakistan, it makes no sense to say that illegal Mexicans could not self-repatriate to next-door Mexico. The lesson here is that when you enforce the law against a thousand illegal aliens, word spreads, and 10,000 others begin packing their bags on their own.|`|9wO55oYzaa	We may not be able to deport you all BUT any and all taxpayers money should be banned for use on illegal aliens, this includes educational facilities, and healthcare (except emergencies and deported afterwords) NO GOVERNMENT SERVICES.    American companies should receive larger fines and sanctions until they comply, if you put enough hurt on employers they WILL comply after all $$  is the bottom line and if the cheap labor is no longer cheap the problems begin to take care of themselves without mass deportation concerns.   Tighten the border once they have left...  problem solved.    Illegals will then begin to leave of their own free will.  Your arrogance WILL be your downfall, talk like that only serves to increase the numbers of people who want illegals out and increase the hate which is unfortunate for both sides.|`|faefca8c72dac10afd3ad4ef86f494b2aa	Amen Bombasti.....  You nailed it well!|`|om8rYD02aa	We could have a policy of deportation for all illegals and it could be successful.  All we have to do is enforce the laws in this country.. But for this to happen, we need to secure the border in a way that nobody could get over the wall, fence, or however it was set up.  We have the technology to do this and think of all of the good paying jobs which would be created for us citizens who would work hard to keep or borders secure.  Then we move on to the deportation issue. First, deport all of the criminals in the prisons/jails.. then there is an automatic deportation for anyone who is picked up for doing something wrong.. This would probably eliminate around 1/2 of the illegal aliens who are here.  Then we just use our police and check people to see if they are here legally.  If not, deport them.  But along with this, we need to take the incentive out for the illegals to be in this country.  Companies or individuals who are found to hire people without legal documentation should be heavily fined.  The penalty should increase for each infraction, and then 3 strikes and you are out.. no more business for you.  Then we should change the welfare policy in this country and have people on welfare actually work for a living and do the jobs the illegals are doing right now.. They will be earning a living and the strain will be gone from our social programs..    This is what needs to be done to ensure the united states remains the strongest country in the world....|`|dLdN0nB0aa	Let me ask you a question, what if a band of thugs came in a bank intent on robbing it, do the guards have a right to shoot them, well this is what the illegal aliens are doing at the border, I SAY START SHOOTING....Nuf Said|`|I6PqhV5zaa	the next time there is a illegal immigration rally across the country INS should be at every venue|`|ZpzRFd2caa	I say its a challenge and time to start working on it. Truthfully we will never be able to deport all of them but the laws that stand need to be enforced. I'm totally against the amnesty issue but if we do it there should be a few things that happen:    10 years before they are offered full citizenship  They pay back taxes for at least two years  $25,000 fine to employer  No welfare for at least 10 years    If these are not enforced deportation begins. Also, if they were not working they should be deported because if they don't have a job why did they come here.    Many people have come here legally and I just do not understand why these people can not. I know there is a waiting period but this country can only handle a specific size growth per year or we start to have unemployment problems.    I think that would start to change things a little bit. I understand these people are trying to better their lives but you can't come here and expect welfare. If you are an honest citizen then the business you worked for needs to be fined, they shouldn't have been hiring illegal employees, they were trying to ignore taxes.|`|AoeWIqHUaa	Sure we can deport all of them.

NwFSUQ3eaa	UK Immigration list the following as criteria for a "marriage visa". If you don't meet all of the below, I would not advise simply re--applying.  Check also that  you have the valid marriage certificate from the country in which you married not just a religious certificate, and make sure it's endorsed by the foreign office of the country in which the marriage took place    - If you have been together for less than four years you are granted a marriage visa for a probationary period of two years. If you are still married and living together at the end of two years in the UK permanent residence (properly known as indefinite leave to remain) will usually be granted.  - If you have been together for four years or more outside the UK you will be granted indefinite leave to remain (permanent residence) in the UK without having to live in the UK for two years.  - The UK citizen or permanent resident must have actually met their non-UK spouse. This is to prevent a situation that occurs sometimes in arranged marriages where the husband and wife have never met.  - You must intend to live together permanently with your spouse.  - You must possess sufficient funds to pay you and your spouse's living expenses and those of any dependants without claiming public funds. Public funds cover various benefits paid by the Government if you are currently looking for work, if you are on a low income and if you are in various other situations.  - Accommodation for the couple, and any dependants, must be suitable and available.  - Spouses seeking to come to the UK on the basis of marriage to a UK national should apply for entry clearance before entering the UK.  - If you have a visa valid for six months or less in the UK you cannot change status to a spouse visa.  - Children of the marriage who are under 18 years old are allowed entry to the UK as dependants, and can make their application at the same time as the main applicant.  - After a total period of three years in the UK if you meet the residence requirements you may then apply for UK citizenship.

But I will add that the photos were most likely refused because they were poor quality (digital cameras now or poor paper tends to create those issues).

4SKDlA5Laa	Wow. That's a difficult one. You could try contacting immigration to see if they're in the system, but I don't know that they'd give you that information, if they have it. Also, many detained illegals give false names if they're detained, hoping to avoid the ten year block on getting legal papers if you're deported. So even if they give out the info, if your friend didn't give the right name, they won't be found in the system.  If they're detained and sent back to Mexico, usually it happens quickly if they're caught in a border state. (In Texas the turnaround is usually overnight if they agree to leave voluntarily. If they don't, they would be detained until deported--a process that can take a while. )  If they are detained and go back to Mexico voluntarily, they will just be put on a bus and driven back across the border and should turn up pretty soon. If they draw out the process, it could be months before you hear from them.  Of course, if they're lost--hopefully they'll turn up soon.  Sorry I can't be more help--it looks like you'll just have to wait and see.|`|9g8spRvPaa	Sad story. a month is a long time not to call. People have given you some good advice above me. good luck.|`|dCewrtXaaa	I am afraid you will have to wait until they contact some family members, either here or in Mexico. If detained by immigration, they may not have given their real names so as to avoid future problems. If they were deported back to Mexico, they will soon find a way to be in contact. I doubt two grown men could get lost, but I am concerned about the nephew, though.|`|86oJq96kaa	They're probably in one of the detention centers.You can call ICE and give names and specifics and they can tell you which one.Good luck.|`|QW27ZMMUaa	How do you know that is what happened? If you heard it from the Coyote, how do you know it is the truth? Unfortunately many people have been hurt or killed by these Coyotes. Although I am against illegal immigration, my sympathy goes out to you (if this is a true story). I do not wish anyone harm and that is one of the reasons I am against illegal entrance into this country. These Coyotes are despicable humans because of the treatment they give other humans. I hope you find your friends. But please try and convince them to become legalized.|`|e5c63a0dfd811b5a653e55c38987876faa	If he was caught:    If your friend had no criminal record he could have requested "Voluntary Return" (VR) and would have been back in Mexico within 24 hours if he was near the border.    If he was previously deported and ICE wanted to charge him criminally, he would be sent to a detention center and he would be allowed phone calls.  The fact that the coyote was released is a strong indicator he was not being criminally charged.    If he did not request VR then he would either be allowed to bond out or detained.  Either way, he would be allowed to call.    If he was not caught:    And went back to Mexico, then he could call from Mexico.    If they got lost in the frontier (border area) without water or food.... I am sorry, but hundreds die every year in similiar situations.    If he has been out of contact for over 2 weeks, it is a bad indication.    If you know where they crossed, contact the county sheriff and explain what happened and see if any "John Doe" have been found.    Having clothing information and physical discriptions will help.    You can call ICE detention, but if they were caught they would have access to collect calls.  Would there be any reason they would not call?    Call the Mexican Consulate and see if they can help.    If they paid the coyote in advance, there is no benefit for the coyote to actually take them across the border.    I'm sorry I do not have better news.|`|zcvJhlRQaa	Two possibilities I can think of.  1. they were caught and are in the system.  2. they are dead in the desert.    The other 2 possibilities are they are in Mexico or in the states, but if that were true someone would have heard from them. As it is there isn't much you can do, and not much anyone can do to help you.|`|JXCWUdDsaa	If I were in your shoes, I would tell your friend to cross borders legally, rather than risking their lives to break the law.

How many thousands of kids do you think lost their parents, or even parents that lost their children because of this sort of "following the law"??    I am sure you will get advice from people on here on how to find them, I am giving you life saving advice to give them that IF THEY SURVIVE this, to not do it again.    I agree with blondie. Coyotes are despicable and care nothing about the people they bring here. They would as soon as leave them dead as long as they get their money.    If I only help save the life of one person, this post was worth it. Now who is going to give me a thumbs down??    I am anti-illegal, but I don't want to see people die needlessly.    Yeah that's it...one idiot so far gave me a thumbs down. Why??

Immigration came to a couple of peoples houses down my road and there are poor little children living alone. us neighbors are gathering money to send them over the border to see there parents and then come back.

You could try to going down to your city centers and look through some documents that if immigration has deported these people. Good Luck and may God reunite you with your friend some day.|`|j8cfi2eQaa	It's a sad story that could have been avoided if your friend followed the law.  I agree with most of the answers above, call US border patrol and ask for them by name and description, other than that I hope they're OK.  And BTW, I don't believe that anybody deserves to be here.  Being here is deserved in three ways.  1) birth 2) legal immigration 3) asylum and your friend doesn't fit any of those.

There are two routes -- if you're talking about the science-based route (i.e. testing, etc.) you can go to school for criminal justice, but really what you want is a hard science (like chemistry, or biology) with strong practical skills. Many places will teach courses on "forensic" science, which is the process of investigation.  You may have to have an advanced degree (like a master's or Ph.D.) and do internships in different agencies.    Someone who "takes down" evidence is usually called a police detective  They go through the police academy, usually spend some time as a "beat" officer before being promoted.  Criminal justice majors are accepted, but these days good detectives also have other skills, like psychology, sociology, math, pathology, foreign language (almost a must in criminal justice these days).

0115b8162e3b4d1bdce5ffb45890b1d8aa	No never it is wrong if they come to live here they should be subject to our law and NO other. They are free they can go elsewhere|`|PZYNdUtXaa	It cannot be done.  It should not be done.  I'll try to say why and hope I make sense! <br>  <br>  Firstly, we should not make this topic about the rights and wrongs of Sharia law itself. I personally strongly dislike what I have heard of it, but that dislike is not the point when it comes to refusing sharia law in Europe. It would be needlessly divisive to start arguing about sharia law itself, which most Europeans find highly distasteful.<br>  <br>  The point is that Sharia law is a religious law, stemming from a culture that does not separate religion from social matters.  Muslims want it inroduced due to reasons of religion.  But in Europe - or my example of the UK, we are a secular state.  The law is not tied to any religion.  So if we were to give one group, ie Muslims, the right to there own rules, it could not be on grounds of religion. Instead, it would have to be on grounds of the idea that you can have more than one law.  All sorts of people could start to say, well, look, our group has another set of laws we want to impose that allow us to murder...if muslims can have their own system, why can't we?  A legal minefield - that would result in the complete collapse of law and order.<br>  <br>  A country cannot operate with two systems of law, the whole idea of the law is that no one is above it. It is not about whether we like Sharia - it would be the same no matter what the law concerned.<br>  <br>  So it cannot be done and nor should it.  We need cohesiveness in the UK and other countries in Europe - and Sharia law would separate the communities not unite them. It could contribute to terrorism in the end rather than reduce it, because it would be so divisive. <br>  <br>  I think Europe should welcome Muslims who want to integrate and be a proud part of their new country.  But you cannot have two laws - or a Muslim country within a secular European state.  So if Muslims are wanting to have Sharia law applied and are not happy to live under the law of a secular country, they should emigrate/or return to a Muslim country where they will be able to have that.|`|ZTc7rE1Haa	Each country should have its own laws and they should apply to all who live there. Anyone who thinks that the laws of the land are unsuitable for them should simply leave. We can't start making exceptions or it will end in disaster. I think that muslims already have too many privileges and that should change. They should integrate and adopt British values or leave.|`|yb4FbFiSaa	No ... if they don't like our laws and way of life, then they are welcome to pack their bags and go back to their countries of origin.  Europe left the dark ages behind a very long time ago, and to introduce 'sharia' law would be to return to that cruel time.|`|UxlL89rHaa	You have no idea and are only fear mongering, What is being discussed is similar to the Jewish Bethdin (i think thats how its spelt), Its not about changing European Law, its about have a system that caters for the Muslims, like marriage and inheritance issues.|`|GcQl76mfaa	It's what happens when tolerance becomes too tolerant of the intolerant. Europeans would be wise to keep their own laws and not back down to Bronze Age mentality. Any political system that justifies stoning adulterers does not go well with modern, rational thinking.|`|Yw7YgG0Kaa	No.<br>  Obama is following "sharia law", and look what He's doing to America.|`|dtXzOGoKaa	no it shouldn't, just as i wouldn't like to see Europe's laws in Muslims countries|`|fynzkVK4aa	In my view, if a person chooses to live in a country (regardless of whether or not they were born there), then part of that is accepting and obeying the laws of that country.<br>  <br>  If I chose to move to a country where Sharia Law was THE law, I would have to abide by it.<br>  <br>  By living in a country where Sharia Law is NOT the law, to me Muslims should show the same respect and live by the law of the country they live in.  If a person does not like the law of the land they live in, they have more freedom than at any other time in history to move somewhere else where the laws are more to their taste.<br>  <br>  If Muslims want the laws of this country changed, then they should go about it the same way anyone else who disagrees with the law has to; by lobbying, peaceful protest, trying to elect people with similar views etc. in order to allow legal and proper change of the law, through the parliamentary system.<br>  <br>  We should not let any group, Muslim or anything else, change the laws by any way other than within our current legal system.  And EVERYONE in this country should live by the law, and work legally to change it if they don't like it, or move somewhere else, regardless of nationality, faith or anything else.|`|bGZ8vYuNaa	I don't know what Sharia law is but why should they be allowed to come into our country's and live by there own laws? If they don't like our laws.... move somewhere else. I'm not racist but some of the complaints foreigners make are just ridiculous and most of the foreigners that live by me try robbing/stabbing or stealing me anyways|`|Rmbwvm2uaa	Yes, but I should be allowed to introduce my own laws too. First law, everyone must turn their pockets inside out like in Back to the Future II. Going to work on other laws once this one is fully adopted.|`|fiKneZ20aa	No. Because they'll eventually demand that their law is "divine" compared to all others and try to force it on everyone.|`|xqtXY0RFaa	Vaiting in der shadowz for der politically correct moment ve vill emerge to zay.... <br>  <br>  NEIN!!!!!<br>  <br>  EUROPE> VIL> PREVAIL|`|bZy74U06aa	No.  islam and Western Civilization do not mix.  muslims are mired in the seventh century.|`|NTR6LnZSaa	nope... they should be introduced to boiling jet fuel..|`|Souvww0maa	They should follow the laws of the nation they live in.

I' m afraid that I could not countenance women being stoned to death for adultery.<br>  <br>  Essentially, when in Rome do as the Romans do, or get out. This applies also to<br>  <br>  Verona<br>  Innsbruck<br>  Bradford <br>  Hamburg<br>  Karlskrona<br>  Tallinn<br>  Leeds<br>  Dewsbury<br>  Toulouse<br>  Perpignan<br>  <br>  etc etc.|`|9ozLBt5Qaa	A big fat N.O<br>  <br>  Sharia Law - or islamic law for that matter is not and never will be compatible with Western way of life. If it was to take place, it would be for Muslims only. As a result segregation would increase in society.<br>  <br>  Most people in UK resent Islam and do what they do eradicate Islam or ignore it. Muslims do what they do but enforcing their controversial beliefs upon others will create them more enemies. Westerners like free speech, democracy and a free way of life. If British born or Foreign living british Muslims dont like our law both can leave - now.|`|WCkOUF9aaa	Our allies Pakistan are letting it happen.<br>  <br>  I think radical Islam needs a HARD slap down.|`|VfYvJypEaa	No we shouldn't .

Especially because my late husband needed to smoke it while he was on chemotherapy.  It helped him obtain an appetite and decreased his nausea.  It is also great for glaucoma patients to decrease intraocular pressure.<br>  If we legalized it and taxed it, America could get out of it's deficit.

n2kBUWQOaa	You are correct in your observations.<br>  <br>  Don't listen to doctor FOO up there.<br>  <br>  IF you are looking to make a profit, then yes, sometimes you have to spend money to make money. Example: You are in retail, you must buy inventory to sell merchandise.<br>  <br>  Our government is not designed to make money. It is designed to govern. Our government taxes to make money, and that money is supposed to be used to operate the government. PERIOD ! It is not a money making enterprise. At least it is not supposed to be.<br>  <br>  You can not run a government as you run a business.<br>  <br>  Look at what happens when government gets involved in the way businesses conduct themselves. Fannie May and Freddy Mac. A perfect example of people who can not differentiate between government and business.|`|hzAidxdkaa	well if you knew anything about economics you would know that you have to spend money to raise money.

As for how I would deal with it, murdering a helpless person suggests a lot of rage, I would want to not be anywhere near him the next time he gets mad. Also, you didn't give the age of Luke, but the parents might be in trouble for leaving the other child with someone below a certain age.|`|TL6c0Ntcaa	What a sad story.<br>  Unfortunately the maturity of Luke was over estimated by both parents who I note are both professional people.<br>  I feel that leaving Luke to be responsible for Tyler was a big ask on behalf of the parents and somehow their own guilt regarding this very unfortunate death of their younger son will have a great effect on their conscience for the rest of their lives.<br>  As the boys ages have not been stated, it makes it difficult to form an opinion or reason for Luke's actions. really, I feel quite sorry for Luke, for he is the one that lost control and now bears the consequences of that fateful day.<br>  Really, how can anyone deal with this sort of tragedy. Just be the friend you claim to be.|`|v2Afl0Jpaa	There is going to be a lot of mixed emotions on this one.<br>  <br>  Just tell them that your there if they need anything.<br>  As far as dealing with "it", time is the only healing process they can go thru.|`|sOoz0Fduaa	Did Tyler die because of the whack or because of his body's reaction to the whack due to his disability? If Tyler was somehow less tolerable to injury because of the disability and Luke knew this, he could get in more trouble. But if he didn't know then he'll probably face manslaughter charges. Of course if Luke beat him to death and his body's reaction was typical and not related to the disability, then Luke's in big trouble. I'm just saying that if Luke didn't know Tyler was more likely to be seriously injured by that action, charges could be reduced.
uGWL8EWRaa	Actually there is a link between Obama speaking and the reaction of the stock market the next day. The policies that he is trying to put into effect cause investor to alter their decision based on how they will be directly impacted by those policies. This also applies to companies and what they believe will be their future profits. The point is that those who really understand how to make money know that a lot of the things Obama has planned will cause more problems in the long run.|`|c3vPZfghaa	i thought it was because you opened your mouth.<br>  And don't say you haven't opened your mouth every day before the market crashed.|`|EwdsfwUyaa	Between the last market close Bush was still president (1/16/2009) and this Monday (2/23)  the Dow has declined by 16%|`|Y3ZAtgkXaa	It doesn't.

You guys blame Obama in the first 60 days for all the problems, and blame Clinton for the last 8 years of problems.<br>  <br>  Unfortunately for you, the American voters have seen through your lies and deceit and put the Republican party on the shelf.<br>  <br>  And now Jindal is your Messiah?  LOL.  It may be decades before the Repubs ever control Congress or the White House again.  And then again, it may be the end of the Republican party.  One can only hope.
99LE77iuaa	Your question seems to infer another one. "Should religion be taught in schools?"<br>  <br>  Religion should most certainly be taught but it must be balanced. All should be discussed and this must include the athiests, humanists and sceptics. There must be no fanatical brain-washing.<br>  <br>  If religion is omitted from the timetable a lot of understanding is lost. Philosophers will be forgotten and a lot of history will not be understood.<br>  <br>  Not knowing anything of religion leaves people unable to criticize extremists who would find it easy to get them to believe idiotic things and to do idiotic things. <br>  <br>  G.K. Chesterton said, "A man who does not believe in God will believe anything". I don't agree with him but it is a point to discuss.<br>  Just one lesson a week would make a difference.|`|AA12281247	Of course. Religion will deny any ethic that doesn't agree with its own dogma. <br>  <br>  Religion can be of limited help, but most deny legitimacy to those of other religions.|`|60nqfNDHaa	Completely.<br>  I also think it is very possible for religion to cause corruption in the schools. Just like it has in government|`|bp59GQ0yaa	Of course there can be.<br>  Ethics and morality are not dependent on religion.|`|O6x1CTd4aa	yes since religion and ethics and morality don't necessarily go hand in hand|`|QqxrVVnlaa	I think it's important that children are taught about religion but there should be no such thing as 'Faith Schools'! If we're serious about a complete separation between religion and the state then religion should only be practised outside of school!<br>  <br>  You don't have to believe in this or that god to be a decent person.|`|jHWpNL9Iaa	Yes.  Public schools have no religion so everyone who was educated in public schools must have no morality if that's the case.|`|PZOyNlKaaa	Yes of course, respect must be in all religions, education ethic and morality must be in all religions and religions cann′t be mixed with education in schools for avoid conflicts, then every one should be understand that there are people that think and believe in different way, but ethics and morality are the same.|`|i5FP4Vbraa	Yes, get rid of all religion in our schools, dump it out with the trash.<br>  <br>  Relgion has nothing to do with ethics or morality, reigion is all about mind control and keeping the people ignorant so that a bunch of priests can take their money.<br>  <br>  Relgion is all about money.|`|7ONKVbbiaa	Absolutely. <br>  Ethics and morals are not tied to any one religion. If religious beliefs are taught in schools, then it becomes THEIR concept of what is ethical or not.|`|2DLqsVFcaa	but of course.
FKYJ5K34aa	i consider ALL Republicans tolerant.  particularly compared with the hate-mongering left that we've seen over the past 8 years.  the name-calling of President Bush, as well as Sarah Palin, shows absolutely NO tolerance from the left.<br>  <br>  why is it that those who preach tolerance, have the least of it?<br>  <br>  love,<br>  <br>  Leah|`|TeJWqCL6aa	While always correct in her assessments, normal Democrats<br>  do not deserve disrespect,|`|bdaff1aefd0fc9f0124cfd06758eb166aa	Ann Coulter is a complete moron, no wait that would be insulting to morons.|`|Y3ZAtgkXaa	No. I consider ann coulter to be a TRAITOR.<br>  <br>  <br>  ""My only regret with Timothy McVeigh is he did not go to the New York Times Building."  - ann coulter|`|9BcQ5XMXaa	She could have played in the movie "dumb and dumber" ... she'd have the main role (dumber).<br>  <br>  Besides Sarah Palin, it's hard to find someone as intolerant as her!!|`|u23sBafTaa	While I do enjoy listening to her once in awhile, I prefer to read her books she has some very good points !

"Why do those who preach tolerance seem to have the least of it."  Why do the conservative Christians have the least tolerance possible.  But their Lord preached it, and they preach it in their churches...  (and btw, I am Christian, but I am ashamed to be associated with most Christians)<br>  <br>  Even though I didn't agree with Bush, but I never was SO hateful towards him.  Actually READ some of the comments by conservatives about Obama and liberals.  They are downright HATEFUL.  Talk about not being Christ-like or practicing what you preach.<br>  <br>  I admit there are a lot of things said by liberals that shouldn't be said, but it's not as rampant and not filled with as much rage.  Where do they get that anger from?|`|leM3RQ5Haa	Here's a transcript from when she was on 'The View'.  For staying cool around those ignorant cows, I'd say she was incredibly tolerant:<br>  <br>  <a href="http://newsbusters.org/node/4778" rel="nofollow">http://newsbusters.org/node/4778</a><br>  <br>  Scroll down to the title "Ann Coulter Sends ABC's The View Crew Into a Tizzy".|`|8cf795959f4bb56d8c730f6fc0d177dfaa	She is about as tolerant as Chris Matthews of MSNBC.

PnGKcPRqaa	Yes it is the ASAP or Army Substance Abuse Program.  It is a comprehensive program, which combines prevention education, suicide prevention, urinalysis testing, risk reduction, and civilian employees counseling services.    There are 5 ways for a soldier to be referred to ASAP    1)  Self Identification (Voluntary)  The soldier goes to his/her chain-of-command and requests to see a counselor for an alcohol and/or drug abuse issue.  2)  Commander/Supervisor Identification  A soldier can be referred in this way if his/her commander becomes aware, observes, or suspects that a soldier is a substance abuser.   3)  Biochemical Identification  A soldier that comes up with a positive results from a urinalysis or a breath/blood alcohol testing method will automatically be referred to the Counseling Center for evaluation.  4)  Medical Identification  Healthcare providers/physicians may refer a soldier if it is apparent upon examination that the soldier is abusing alcohol and/or other substance.  The soldiers unit commander will be immediately notified by the referring medical personnel.  5)  Investigation and/or apprehension  Soldiers that are identified by military or civilian law enforcement as being involved in an alcohol and/or drug related incident will be referred to ASAP for counseling within 72 hours of the incident by the soldiers unit commander.    Services are authorized for all ID Card holders authorized medical services in a military medical facility, and personnel eligible for services under the Federal Civilian Employees Occupational Health Services program.  The phone number is on the bottom of the page I provided.|`|nCURoWNbaa	Yes, every base has a drug and alchohol abuse program. (used to be called ACAP).  Ft Benning would have one as well as any post near him.|`|9njCTye4aa	Yes it's called an Article 15....    Actually they can go seek treatment.|`|MDENwKaCaa	Every base has a program to help Soldiers with drug and alcohol abuse problems.    The Soldier can go in him/herself for confidential treatment, or wait to be caught and forced into the program while being punished for illegal drug use.|`|2c441ddbdb5c2e594351cb0212be0fe9aa	There is a center near Ft Benning that deals with the soldiers more  than on the base because there is more room. The one off base is called The Bradley Center. They do have to get a referral to go there instead of on base. (They also serve the families and so some people don't realize that it is also for the soldiers)
i1bj5UDBaa	You should also write "fiance visa".|`|8OYONwrpaa	They both refer to the same thing.  Shouldn't make any difference<br>  which you use.
b8svqAMAaa	Yes, any time you are contacting someone in jail for any kind of questioning they need to be read their miranda rights first.|`|c07v7O80aa	Supreme Court decision have consistently held that any custodial situation in which a statement against their interests is taken requires the warning. But Miranda does NOT require the warnings to be read just because you are under arrest. It only applies to statements. What you see on television, police reading rights to everyone, even people they have no interest in talking to, are not about Miranda. That is done under state law, and most states do not require it. So, there's no question someone doing time is in custody, so they must be warned prior to a statement being taken.|`|sOoz0Fduaa	Yes. Miranda applies to any custody situation where a statement is taken.

He is already working on many things he promised he would.  The stimulus bill has many things that will keep people from starving and losing their homes. <br>  <br>  You might want to get your facts straight.  He is not funding abortions.  He is funding orgs that perform abortions.  They also provide education and birth control, which will minimize abortions.  But you don't care about them being minimized, do you?  You just want to complain about where the money goes.<br>  <br>  If you care about the lives of innocent children, then why the problem with education that reduces abortion?  You make no sense.  That is why the money is going there.  To educate and provide birth control.  Saving them is exactly what it will do.|`|RVABrMeSaa	So far I like all that he has done and said. Even funding international clinics. Abortion is only a part of it all. If you were really concerned about children's lives you would support Obama. He is not only concerned with them before birth; he is deeply committed to improving their existence.  Some who are contemplating to abort or not, may choose not to because they know that there is hope for a healthy life for their child. <br>  President Obama in his speech last night told of his plans to make education of our children a priority. I just loved it when he said that dropping out of high school is no longer an option.<br>  <br>  Lets work together to stop abortions- lets start with teaching abstinence to the male population. New slogan "keep Your pants on".|`|6g3Z8NwVaa	I think he's doing a fine job so far in his month in office. He got to work right away and he tackled some of the issues I thought were important. The stimulus package and the housing relief are still yet to be seen so I can't say he's failed or was successful until we see the end of it, but on paper, and in my opinion, it seems like a good start. I appreciate that he is going to try to hold people accountable and let us, the ones paying for all this, track where the money is going via recovery.gov. I didn't get enough transparency under Bush so I'm happy to see that Obama is sticking with bringing trust back into government.|`|TYGgRjqDaa	So far I'm fairly happy.

Bubbles are designed to pop and they need to let that happen, new and better businesses will replace them with bette financial discipline thus strengthening the market<br>  <br>  ADDITION: <br>  <br>  you are wrong personal debt is adding onto national debt. that recent stimulus bill covers people who took out home loans that they knew they couldnt afford, now I will be responsible for paying part of those people's house payment.<br>  <br>  I lived in rentals that were less rent than what i could afford so i could save money to buy a house. I did with out large TV's fancy furniture, and expensive vacation. Because i did this I was able to buy a house that was nice and I could afford. once I bought it I paid double payments to pay it off. since I had no debt when I was done paying the house off, i was able to buy big TV's, Good funiture and a new car without putting myself in debt.<br>  <br>  These other people did it the opposite way and wondered why they couldnt afford it.<br>  <br>  Also I know people who have credit card debt that would be more than some people's anual salary, yet i hear them complain about not being able to afford insurance, so they go to the ER and never pay the bill.<br>  <br>  We have people who file for bankruptcy yet they can afford cable, internet, nights out drinking, smoking. The reason they do this is because they know the government is there to catch them when they fall.<br>  <br>  DOES THE NAME SUELMAN ring a bell? Her little personal debt is going to cost the people of CA a cool 2 million just for the birth/initial hospital stay. Since california is in debt and needs to take bail out money, this personal debt will only put them in more of a  hole and that is not counting the next years of their life, most of those kids will be on SSI disability for life as is 3 or 4 of her older kids. I know this is an extream example but if you talk about the entire country and personal debt that ends up being paid by the tax payer through government funds it adds up.<br>  <br>  But the point is that the government messing in the market will only delay its recovery, while there maybe some window dressing with government funds going into the market it will only be temporary and is only prolonging what naturally happens, the market flows in a cycle and is expected to hit a low, but it is also expected to go back up on its own through people in the market|`|937d8516b6bac65675aebed05fbfdfc9aa	wow jindal really got the libs wild tonight|`|6eoMqJF0aa	Whats wrong with paying your bills.|`|otYOxmnuaa	I didn't hear the speech but from what you've stated, absolutely needed to be said.  <br>  <br>  People are bulging at the pants trying to get government to make their life easy by shifting the burden to others.<br>  <br>  The country was founded on self-sufficiency and individual-responsibility.  I think a strategy that would cause short-run havoc but reap long-term benefits would be to announce today that there would be no more social programs starting Jan. 1, 2010...NONE!  <br>  <br>  I think people would get the message and find work.  I'd also bank on them being happier and being able to look in the mirror w/o seeing failure.<br>  <br>  I am unemployed and could use some help -- but I won't demand it, nor do I expect the government to hold my hand...the jobs are out there, I just haven't been forced to find one just yet as my savings is holding up.  I also know when that time comes, I'll likely have to lower my standards and work a job that isn't ideal -- at least until things pick up.<br>  ______________________________________...<br>  Personal Debt is exactly what caused the crash -- do you think a mortgage isn't personal debt?  <br>  <br>  Do you think extending people's purchasing power in a society that has to keep up w/ the Jones's is a smart solution to economic growth?  <br>  <br>  People need to pay for what they've already purchased -- hello, welcome back reality, I guess it wasn't free money after all.  <br>  <br>  It's called keeping your word -- retaining your individual responsibilities.  Lessons learned the hard way are those often remembered.  I bet those who defaulted on their house won't be so quick to rush to the bank when they see a house they "just gotta have".<br>  ++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++...<br>  "Lol you neocons may be ok with paying for Bush's mistakes but I'm not. My personal debt is my own responsibility. The national debt is the government's. Jindal had the audacity to ask the American people to pay for their mistakes?? It's not only idiotic it's disrespectful to every american who watched him speak, rather you realize it or not."<br>  <br>  Last I checked, we're supposed to be a constitutional republic, so it doesn't matter what you personally want to do.  The fact is, Congress and the Executive branch spent a lot.  Let me remind you of what the last 8 years held for us, b/c it comes across like you've forgotten.<br>  <br>  1.  Dot com bust<br>  2.  9/11<br>  3.  Two wars -- 1 justified, the other "suspsect" (Congress voted to go into Iraq, remember?  Your representation at work)<br>  4.  High oil/food prices -- subsequent increase in gas and doing business<br>  5.  Housing crisis (Enabled by CRA/Fannie/Freddy -- greedy banks and consumers...or better said -- EVERYBODY!)<br>  6.  Financial Collapse<br>    Congress represents you -- so you have no say.<br>  <br>  There are other costly "things" I'm sure -- but those seem to be the major ones.  <br>  <br>  He shouldn't have spent as much as he did, just like Obama shouldn't be spending as much as he is now.  But we're all subject to the will of the people...you can't pick and choose when you'll participate and when you'll close your wallet and sit back and criticize...doesn't work that way.  <br>  <br>  I say reduce the size of government and in the long run, all of that "saved" money will take a huge chunk out of our national debt.  Makes sense right?  When the times get tough, scale back.|`|lvBUl3Zdaa	I agree. If Americans somehow managed to pay off all the personal debt they were holding, it would only make a dent in the economic crisis we are experiencing.

Evidement les journalistes en font tout un scandale parce que les forces de l'ordre sont intervenus pour une interpellation car les parents ne se sont jamais prsents au tribunal suite  une convocation.

Et ses consquences humaines sont bien regrettables, mais on ne fait pas d'omelette, etc.    Sauf que cette conception est un fantasme. Et qu'il y a trente ans que la politique en France joue avec ce fantasme. Pour ma part, je n'ai pas besoin d'un drame comme celui d'il y a quelques jours, ni de brutalits policires, pour tre en complte opposition avec les fanatiques des l'tat, des nations , des frontires.     Quant  l'unit culturelle de la france, c'est aussi un mythe, et l'immigration n'y est pour rien. Croyez-vous qu'il y avait une unit culturelle entre les "classes dangereuses" et la bourgeoisie librale au XIXme sicle? Pourtant, ces classes dangereuses, la bourgeoisie de l'poque rvait de les karcheriser, avec des canons chargs  mitraille.

1YdeUn1Caa	How will it work? You going to have an armed guard in every car 24/7 so nobody will smoke? If somebody does smoke, you expect police officers to stop arresting drug dealers, bank robbers and murderers, so they can arrest smokers? Ridiculous. Next question.|`|7ONKVbbiaa	Prior to the 80s, MILLIONS of American children were raised in homes where the parents smoked in their presence, and no, those millions of kids are not all now dying of second hand smoke. <br>  I won't say 2nd hand smoke is "good". I will say that in my opinion, 90% of it is being politically correct.|`|SStAJ28Iaa	it raises a good point about protecting children from second hand smoke. however i have to admit that i detest the idea that so many "non-smoking" laws are flying around. for the one simple fact that eventually a smoker becomes a second rate citizen with limitations to their freedom of free choice. granted that's arguable too. but why, other then to reduce the free choice of Americans would this law be implemented? Not for the safety of children, because so many awlful things can happen to kids that the law allows. IE forms of neglect, abuse, emotional, mental.....whats to say next that anyone earning less then $50,000 per year arent allowed to have kids, because they wont take care of them without enough money.....uggghhh you had to ask a very difficult question.

A company does not have the power to give you a criminal record.  Only a court can do that.

If they didn't call the police before but are using the threat to call the police in order to get money from you, I think you should tell the newspapers.|`|uSeApMt9aa	No you will not be in trouble with the courts. Meaning it will not be on your record. Don't worry. If you are really concerned then call your local police station. They can give you all the answers you need. Don't listen to the people who are saying it will be on your record. You didn't go to court there for were not found guilty of ANYTHING. They can't put something on your record. The only problem besides the fine is they might call your local DA and request you get financial help but that's it.

The government could pay people to dig holes and fill them back up, but in the end, you have no net gain in wealth.    Meanwhile, the healhcare mandates and "card check" legislation will result in mass layoffs. No new companies will open up shop in american if the risk of unionization is so high.     A deep recession is more likely. When reagan took over we has 21% interest rates, 12% unemployment. Figure we'll be back to that kind of economy.

La razon debe ser racismo o complejo de superioridad, como entre los europeos son los salvajes del arca necesitan buscar con quien se puedan creer mejores. Igual de mal tratan los italianos, en los paises nordicos y Europa Central por el contrario son bastante civilizados y amables (claro con excepcion de los neo nazis alemanes y austriacos que no se han extinguido aun, pero son pocos, gente ignorante de clase baja)    Eso de que los latinos hacen bulla pues no me parecio que en Madrid y Barcelona fueran las noches tranquilas, yo no pude dormir bien en los hoteles, los coches con la musica a todo volumen y ventanas bajas me despertaban, me dijeron que era por partidos de futbol.

Lo primero que quiero es aclarar a quienes hacen diferencia entre latinos y espa?oles: Latino, significa lengaje que proviene del latn, es decir el castellano, francs...  T has preguntado mejor: Hispanoamericano.  Lo segundo, hay que tener en cuenta  a lo que se va al pais: de turismo, a trabajar, o a insultar y menospreciar a los habitantes, la cultura del pais al que te diriges, sea el que sea el pais del globo terraqueo.  Tercero: En Espa?a, se recibe bien a quienes vienen con buenas intenciones(como en todas las partes), no a delinquir, robar, violar..etc  Se da educacin gratuita, seas legal o ilegal, y lo mismo pasa con la sanidad, que es gratuita, e incluso para los extranjeros sin recursos (100 por 100 gratis las prestaciones farmaceticas, no como los legales que pagamos cotizacin, y  un porcentaje elevado del valor del medicamento), ayuda en guarderias, vivienda, por hijos a cargo, etc, etc...  Asi, que si crees que los tratamos mal, eres libre de pensarlo, aunque como en todas partes, siempre hay gente desagradable, pero similar a las actitudes de ciertos emigrantes, y no por eso HAY QUE GENERALIZAR.  Los espa?oles, en pases hispanomericanos, pues segn sea la actitud de quien visita, y de como se reciba, aunque en ciertos paises, se "secuestra", se te insulta slo por tu origen, pero esto son casos aislados.  Asi pues, con que te des una vuelta por YR, vers que existe gente desagradable, racistas, provenientes de todas partes del globo.  y por favor, pregunten con cautela, y no con mala intencin, buscando la confrontacion: YA CANSA LA IGNORANCIA DE CIERTAS PERSONAS, QUE CARECEN DE CONDICION HUMANA|`|jX7zTusCaa	Hello The Bad Guy Razor Ramon    You have posted content to Yahoo!

En cambio los sudamericanos que vienen a Espa?a "actualmente", lo hacen para trabajar (en el mejor de los casos), cosa que repercute mucho en la sociedad porque la convivencia es diaria y todos podemos ver los pros y los contras de cada gente.

Simpleas2!|`|aNrY3Bazaa	The crisis in Washington and on Wall Street is dire, and John McCain has stated that his campaign must be suspended to immediately rush to its attention.  How does he have the time to make public appearances to burnish his economic stripes?  The answer is simple:    He is a liar.    Between his campaign manager's 30,000 dollars a month from Fannie and Freddie, to his VP's lies about her support of the Bridge to Nowhere, to painting Obama's support of an anti-sex predator bill as an effort to teach sex to kindergarteners, McCain's Straight Talk Express has been run off the road by a Mack truck full of lies and deception.    Why doesn't he want to debate?    Since the economy is the primary issue of which voters will want them to explain their stances, McCain will need to walk on eggshells. Someone might bring up that, until a few days ago, he touted himself as being a de-regulating warrior of the Reagan Revolution, which got the ball rolling on our current financial disaster.  Worse, someone in the media might finally recall that he was at the center at the Keating Five Savings and Loan scandal.  It's hard to blame him for wanting to run for the hills from this issue.    On that note, he is also wise not to let Palin campaign for him, since she has shown herself not to be ready for interview questions that stray too far from a limited set of prescribed talking points, and not to be capable of giving straight answers to those that do.  How could she ready and capable of running the campaign?    The whole thing stinks of a cynical political stunt.  Unfortunately, all it seems to have accomplished so far is making the assertion that presidents aren't supposed do two things at once.    McCain '08!!|`|R1LvhhTeaa	Never in the whole history of this country has anything this strange ever gone on.  You've got a presidential candidate taking a "time out" to fly off to Washington to do something he could do over the telephone - and then he isn't going to Washington -  he's ditching Letterman to do an interview somewhere else.  He's lost his mind.    He lost his mind when he picked that trailer trash Palin - she can't be trusted to talk to the press for fear she'll get her foot stuck in her mouth so far that they can't get it out.    Lord!  If this poor stupid deluded country elects these useless people it deserves everything it gets.|`|accdd753250739a255f532616b8c6cdfaa	McCain showed up on Katie Couric's show after cancelling out on Letterman due to the fact that he was "too busy".  Let's face it, it didn''t want to get into it with Letterman who was going to ask the hard questions that McCain isn't capable or ready to answer.  I don''t understand this crisis that he is claiming  that is calling him to DC.  Let''s face it, he''s been absent for 109 our of the last 110 sessions and what is he going to do in Washington to help the economy.  He can''t do anything by himself.  Everything is so sewn up waiting for the election that there aren''t a lot of big bills and issues about the economy that need his being there at this point.  He''s finding a way out of the debate.  As it stands, the debate has been scheduled and has to be paid for, that's it. If Obama shows up and McCain doesn''t it just leaves Obama with all that time to talk and say what he wants to say.  And as far as Palin goes, well, let''s just not go there.  The Reps are famous for making mistakes and this may be their biggest.  Right now I think their biggest issue is to keep her out of the spotlight.  Don't count on her for any big debates, she seems not to understand a lot about politics.|`|cIH0QbfMaa	McCain had to make a quick stop to give Couric her payola for giving Palin the softball treatment in their interview.|`|AhlWfUpXaa	Just part of his political stunt. It was such a crisis that he won't leave for Washington until tomorrow morning.  And when he gets there he does nothing, oops photo op at White House.  He can't get into the committee hearings on finance since he doesn't have a seat on the panel.  What a big blow of hot air.|`|yvPA8FSsaa	The Couric interview is already taped and the speaking engagement will not interfere.  The vote will probably come on Friday or Monday at the latest.  All three Senators, McCain, Obama and Biden should be there.  It is that big of a deal.      Personally, I cannot see any reason for Obama to balk at doing his job as a Senator except one.  He does not want to have to vote on this bill and be on the record.  He would much rather delegate important decisions to others.  He as a long history of doing just that.      "Present!"    *|`|jWcVcXZQaa	McCain is afraid to face Obama.  You will note he also said they should reschedule the date the VP debate is scheduled.  Hmmm saves sarah as well!!!       You will also note Obama called McCain today to suggest they make a joint statement then fly to washington as a show of solidarity...McCain says hey good idea let me get back to you, hangs up the phone and calls a press conference!!!      He is a frightened little man    btw I don't understand this whole experience thing with Obama.  It seems like 8 years as a state senator and close to 4 years as a US senator is a pretty good experience base to understand how to make the political deals needed to run a country.|`|xo20AKdsaa	Oh hey, shouldn't Obama get some experience before trying to fix Washington?

(sauf si bien s?r, pour vous, diminuer les rentres d'argents des moins aiss est une action sociale).      (edit : "ces 15 milliards ne sont que 9,5."  tout simplement parce que les 15 milliards taient le chiffre prvisionnel initial, le seul que la population ai retenu, mais qu'en pratique, il ne s'agit que de 9,5 milliards. et ceux, principalement parce que c'est les "riches" qui n'ont pas demand leur remboursement (peut-tre par peur d'un contr?le fiscal, aprs tout).    je rappelle que l'tat n'a pas donn cet argent !  c'est de l'argent qu'il n'aura pas dans le budget de l'anne prochaine, puisqu'il s'agit de rduction d'imp?ts (en gros, de l'argent qui ne rentrera pas), d'o la diffrence.    donc oui, il ne s'agit que de 9,5 milliards.)  @ Phil E : au lieu de rabacher ta propagande, prend internet, tape "dtail paquet fiscal" et lit donc !  tu y trouvera entre autre une vielle info telle que celle l (et plein d'autres) :  http://www.challenges.fr/20070705.CHA721...  qui explique que le bouclier fiscal ne reprsente que 4% du paquet fiscal.  faites vous greffer un sens critique, cela devient lassant.|`|tYcGBGLhaa	non, mais il l'a fait et maintenant c'est nous qui allons payer pour equilibrer les comptes.|`|FisrpbGbaa	En tout cas, mme avec ce soi-disant cadeau (que manifestement beaucoup n'ont pas rellement compris), cela reste que les plus aiss, paient encore plus d'imp?ts que la plupart des fran?ais.

However, he received a tremendous boost when Sen. Barack Obama arrived in Kenya in August 2006 to campaign on his behalf. Mr. Obama denies that supporting Mr. Odinga was the intention of his trip, but his actions and local media reports tell otherwise.    Mr. Odinga and Mr. Obama were nearly inseparable throughout Mr. Obama's six-day stay. The two traveled together throughout Kenya and Mr. Obama spoke on behalf of Mr. Odinga at numerous rallies. In contrast, Mr. Obama had only criticism for Kibaki. He lashed out against the Kenyan government shortly after meeting with the president on Aug. 25. "The [Kenyan] people have to suffer over corruption perpetrated by government officials," Mr. Obama announced.    http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2008...    http://www.freerepublic.com/focus/f-news...

So what do you have? Votes on promises and speeches. Nothing more - nothing less. "No" votes from people that actually checked his record and voting performance going back to his home state and don't trust him. Why? Because his voting history is in direct conflict with those speeches and as trust is earned by what you do -- not by what you say, he's not trusted and rightfully so to that 1/2.    When this "conflict" exists between rhetoric vs. record, all you have is one fact that no one can deny. 1/2 the country took him on his speeches while ignoring everything else --- the other needs more than just words. In this case, the first 1/2 turned out more to vote. The other 1/2 clearly feels that the Obama won nothing! He was selected from a speech not because he's the best, but because he was the choice. Obama won because of a speech. People came to support him because of what? He was selected to run by dem leaders 20 months ago because of what? In the 2004 DNC, he got people's attention because of what?    In less than his first 24 months, one side will be proven wrong, the other will be right. You be the judge given reality on domestic and foreign issues, which side was right. Odds are fairly obvious. This was more of an anti Bush win which has nothing to do with Obama himself. You either voted anti Bush or you were sold hook line and sinker on a speech. Either way, it sets the country up for failure. We'll find out soon as in 2 1/2 months, the "real" show will start - and no speech will help him then.

I asked the girl,   "what do you want to be when you grow up?"  She replied   "President of the United States, I want to give all homeless people a home to live in." So i told her she didnt have to wait to be president to do that. I said she can come by and rake my leaves and ill pay her $50.     She then got a big smile on her face thinking she could earn a good amount of money, but I told her once she gets the money she can go give it to the homeless guy down the street to help him out.  The girl replied, "why doesn't the homeless guy just do the work?"   I replied, "welcome to the Republican side,"  her parents haven't talked to me since.        SEE even kids understand!! |`|CVtwbIKLaa	That one will NEVER be my president.

The republicans will continue there hate mongering fear invoking ways but more and more people are sick of it. As time goes they will fade away and a new way of life will emerge.   For everyone who keeps voting for republicans based on abortion. Keep in mind your wife or your daughter one day may get pregnant, they may discover cancer while she's pregnant (which happens a lot), under John McCains policies your wife or daughter would have no rights. Remember the debates The "health" of the woman. Sara Palin made women in Alaska pay for there own rape kits yet women liked her on her stance for taking their rights away completely, if you are raped by your father or brother or anyone you would be forced to have that child under McCain/Palin. It's sick and is not a country I want to live in. Thank God for Obama....:)|`|Rq3FOK2Taa	He's not gonna be President of the United States.  He doesn't pledge the U.S. flag.  He's friends with terrorists.  His pastor is a racist anti-American.  His wife is also anti-American.  He's against capitalism and for socialism.

He won't even apply his own concept of "spread the wealth" to his own poor half-brother in Kenya who lives in a small shack.

Growing up I never could have dreamed a black person could even run for president. This changes the way the world looks at America ( in a much needed positive way). Blacks as well as other non white "Citizens" should all have the same opportunities ! America really needs to live up to her name THE MELTING POT, THE LAND OF OPPORTUNITY!!! Not the land of opportunity "for whites only".      FYI: Obama is an African surname.|`|Lg7ejArRaa	There is inherent bigotry in trying to scare people with the President Elect's middle name.  Hussein is a word meaning 'good' or handsome, derived from the word Hassan.  I know the US has a great Muslim community, and I'm sure many of them carry this ancient name.  Its denigration is insulting to them, and to me as an American.    His first name, Barack, is from a Semitic word for blessing.  The word appears throughout the Hebrew (as in....original...) texts of the Bible.    This is the United States of America, sir, the land whose founding documents reference the belief that ALL men are created equal.  To impugn, or attempt to impugn, any citizen of this land by claiming his ethnicity is 'the enemy' is antithetical to the ideals of the nation's foundation.    To answer your question, yes, I will respect (soon to be) President Barack Hussein Obama and the office of the Presidency of the United States of America.  I vigorously oppose the policies and actions of the current President but I would show no disrespect to his office.    We must ALL quit thinking of ourselves as "Liberal" or "Conservative" and putting our factional identity before our country, or indeed before our own self-interest.  We are not the 'we' of political parties unless we are office-holders or candidates.  We, the American people, are their customer base, and each party should have to win over each voter, every time, on every election, on every issue.  They work for US, not the other way around.    We are Individuals with a capital "I"...and that is what makes us Americans.  |`|d21b4dc283ce1c9b2fad58eb74be78cfaa	I will respect him as much as the democrat respected Bush.    I think there a village in Kenya missing a terrorist!!!    Reverend Wright got his wish God has damned America.    ESO  ....  Entitlement States of Omerica    Don't blame me  I voted for McCain!!!! |`|EuOhY4OYaa	Like most people, I believe you should respect the office and title of President of the United States. However, as is was widely shown during the Bush administration, that position should always be under scrutiny.   I have heard some say they voted for Obama purely because he was an African-American candidate or that they wanted to be a part of history in electing the first African-American President. Shame on anyone who did for that reason only. I'm all for an African-American man or woman in the highest office, but to blindly follow someone, anyone, because of skin color or sex is foolish to the nth degree. I did not vote for Obama. I am a white, southern male and I am not a racist, as some of you are probably assuming I am at this moment, nor have I ever been racist. I believe you should vote for your President based on the issues, and who is most qualified for the job, not some misguided obligation because of you skin color or political affiliation. I did not feel that Obama was that man.   Well, enough preaching. In conclusion, respect the office, but hold the man accountable for his actions, just as you held President Bush accountable. And for any Obama supporters out there, don't blindly follow your choice for President. He is still only a man, not perfect, and subject to error just as anyone is. |`|zia7iyKRaa	I've got more respect for him more than anyone else at the moment.  This man has just created history.  My children will learn about him one day.  And so will my grandchildren.  It's about time for some change in America.  America finally voted smart -- After voting for Bush two times in a row, I was starting to lose hope in this country.    Obama, ftw. =)

Liberals are necessary because they keep realistic people motivated and involved in debate.    Besides, no mater how ridiculous one's ideals get, the right to voice them is one of the founding principles that makes this country the greatest in human history.

As close as the 2000 election was, it was even closer because of that.  As a Republican on this site, I have never blocked anything, except for a few completely racist questions that were uncalled for.  Did you know your block feature is currently in place?

FCY3lwnoaa	Spending cuts!     McCain supports the basic tenets of spend only what you have and don't waste your resources. He will keep taxes down by keeping spending down. (He has said he would go so far as to put a freeze on any new "unnecessary" spending if needed. What caused the Great Depression in the 30's was that Hoover raised taxes at a time of economic instability. We were almost out of the woods after the '29 stock market crash when Hoover raised the taxes and the result was almost a decade lone depression. On the flip side Obama will spend, spend, spend, forcing taxes to be raised and putting us in a downward spiral.|`|L9LkdThjaa	Spending Cuts|`|k6hicodfaa	In this current economy and budget I want both.|`|SjTAVdcKaa	duh...spending cuts, like I have to do when money gets tight.|`|6B1sxgtOaa	Spending cuts.

Not to mention the lies about Palin, and let's see, they are saying crap about the RNC spending $150,000 on her wardrobe, yet nothing about the money Obama spent on his private jet?

JOHN MCCAIN , " The ANTI - SOCIALIST "    John McCain's son, Andrew, who is CFO of his mom's beer distributorship, "sat on the boards of Silver State Bank and of its parent, Silver State Bancorp, starting in February but resigned in July citing 'personal reasons.' Andrew McCain also was a member of the bank's audit committee, responsible for oversight of the company's accounting," according to AP.    The failure -- which was caused by "poor-quality loans primarily related to real estate development" -- will cost the FDIC deposit insurance fund between "$450 million [and] $550 million," according to AP. Silver State's motto was "When the casinos treat you poorly, let Silver State treat you like a valued customer," according to its website.    Although AP reports he was adopted by McCain and his first wife, Andrew is following in his father's footsteps. John McCain protected Charles Keating from government regulators because he had arranged a real estate deal for his second wife, Cindy. The failure of Keating's S&L cost taxpayers $3.4 billion. Taxpayers got off relatively cheaply bailing out Andrew's former colleagues.        You and I are the McCain's suckers.

Well its him except he is not the once was probably the ubercool republican who had respect from ALL political parties. He has shown that in order to be in the "in crowd" of the GOP, you have to lose your standards and ethics, and sink to ridiculous lows in order to gain the upper hand.     As for why he is not attacking the "supposed issues surrounding Barack"? Its simple, Its called not having proof. See, the problem with allegations is that without subjectivity or substance, it becomes annoying to listeners who soon grow tired of hearing what becomes "conspiracy theories". If there is no evidence or possibility of hidden evidence, then there basically is no cause or justification for the intial allegations.     I mean the guy does not want to look like a jackass should his allegations and fear mongering tatics dig up more dirt on himself than his opponent. |`|wfZhkZO0aa	Because he is trying to run a clean campaign.

wXxhLc5Uaa	I am for McCain:    Why? He has the experience and the know how.  All this talk about the economy is fine but Obamas plan to 'spread the wealth' is a joke.  Without tax breaks for the rich, who just happen to be the people whoown the business that employ the rest of us; they will just outsource jobs to cut on Obamas plan to tax them because they are rich.  Why should people who worked hard and have come to enjoy the wealth that their sacrifices and hard work produced, have to now spread their wealth to the rest.  And by the way, the rest are not working class like the average American, the rest in the idea of democrats are those dead beats that don't even work let alone pay taxes.  More important to me is the fact that Obama has NO concept of our National Security.  We are, like it or not, at WAR and we need a Comander in Chief not a liberal from Illinois who only went to Iraq twice.   |`|avfoAd02aa	 ONE CARES ABOUT OUR COUNTRY    ONR CARES ABOUT HIMSELF      ANY QUESTIONS|`|zXq4NYXvaa	I don't make over $250K a year.

203ace5bdd9fba6cc9484451772fcd23aa	bush attempted to help the economy.  he lowered taxes.  but he did inherit a major economic problem, and it wasnt just from clinton (im not some super conservative). greenspan (the head of the federal reserve) believed in as little regulation as possible.  clinton believed that everyone should be able to own a house, so he made loans easier to get.  many people could not afford these loans though.  this led to the bank crisis.  banks kept giving loans that would never be able to be paid back.  millions defaulted on loans and the value of houses plummeted. bush attempted to correct this by supporting a 700 billion dollar bailout plan that his party did not support, but as of yet, little has changed.    he also started a war on terror in the middle east which led to at first extreme popularity (his approval rating skyrocketed after 9/11) but then led to approval ratings in the 20s. many say that the war debt he built up helped lead to the economic failure, but leading economists say this is not true.  the cost of the war is nothing compared to 20-30 trillion dollar loss in value.  much of the money spent on the war went to domestic companies and soldiers.    bush attempted to reform education with his no child left behind policy, but this was widely unpopular in the end and not supported by teachers.    to the disappointment of pro-life activists, he did not get any major legislation passed for the restricting of abortion.|`|a66nvk0taa	Nothing |`|ZB1vk86Maa	Tax Cuts all around, Economic stimulus checks for all but the wealthy, Grown our Military, Pay increases for the Heroes of America, Replaced Vietnam Era Military Equipment.

Bush has just had to deal with all the problems from the Clinton Administration just as Obama will have to deal with problems from the Bush Administration and so on.

Bush's approval rating was in the toilet which was bad for the Pubs.    With Economic downturn the Dems usually win.    So anyone in Dem seat had it made.    So the above aren't the right reasons..they are just standard reasons why McCain was the underdog.    Add to that the terrific job the Obama campaign, the focus on registering, his appeal to the youth and garnering the black vote...hard to beat.    Here are more of the wrong reasons:    If you mean based on what he stands for,...it is a surprise and a nightmare.    If you mean based on his sketchy background and lack of experience...ditto.    If you mean based on his associations..ditto.    If you mean based on his economic ideas ..it is wrong reasons,..  or anything he stands for wrong reasons...      So mostly he was picked for all the wrong reasons...    I do agree with pro choice.    His color made no difference to me personally..I'd have voted for Black republican Kenneth Blackwell if he were running.    Obama is very very scary..but he is already planning to waffle.

I'm tired of defending this foolishness, so I'll say this: So what if people voted for him because he's Black? We voted in 43 WHITE presidents before, several of which were horrible leaders, so give a Black man a chance to mess up (which I doubt he could do any worse than Bush, the caucasian, could) like other White presidents of the past.

I have several friends attending classes - many have had a rude awakening and are disgusted at this bizarre teaching method.    Notice all the Obama rallies? Did you notice the HUNDREDS of police at each one. Why? In case of an Obama loss. Riot control.    How many were at the McCain rallies? A dozen.  What does that say about the Democratic win?  Every city expected riots in case of a Democratic loss.  None expected it in case of a Republican loss.    What does that say?|`|R5d0SfWKaa	Yea I think too many uneducated voters voted for his image and his supposed promises and change instead of his beliefs.|`|fa8e11ec27394b91bcb5e9306dcade55aa	I couldn't help but shake my head when the media would ask the african americans why they voted for obama and everyone of them had a reply that started with "because he's black:....

He was just as Geraldine Ferraro said about him...had he been white no one would have given him a second look|`|h9G2DPiqaa	         I think that America has made a huge mistake. They based the most important election in US history on nothing but words, most of which were altered throughout his campaign. Such as the "tax decrease" for the middle class. The title of middle class was said to be $300,000 or under, then Obama said it would be around $250,000, after that, Joe Biden said that it would be around $180,000. America doesn't understand that this game they are playing will just continue to decrease.             Obama's plan for "sharing the wealth" is just ridiculous. These people worked hard for their money, the middle class of America did not. Obama also said that he would bankrupt all coal energy based corporations with charging an exceedingly great amount of carbon credits, which are pointless to begin with. Doing this would put millions out of work. Obama promised an economy that would get better. Putting people out of work does not make the economy better.             America has made a huge mistake. America will reap the consequences for their lack of judgment.             One good point that comes out of this election is after we endure this four years (which will be tough) are over, we will be able to get a good truly conservative republican instead of a middle of the road republican with many liberal stand points. After this four years, Barrack Obama will not be reelected. So if we can endure this term, things will get better.  |`|yc1akHrPaa	I agree with you.  I think that he won for the wrong reasons.  I believe that there were a lot of uneducated voters (people that voted without knowing what the candidates stood for or believed in).  |`|sY1wIZWBaa	I followed the issues and voted for who I thought was the best man for the job.  This election had to be about the financial situation in this country more than any other issue.      I am still following and watching what President Elect Obama is doing working towards solving the financial crisis.  His picks are not people he owes favors to, but industry leaders.  I hope he continues to do so.    This is 2008.  The race is not about color, it is about ability and issues.  I feel the best man for the job won.    I also watched John McCain carefully. There were instances where I felt his age and/or health could become an issue.  If there had been a different Vice Presidential candidate I probably would have overlooked what I saw, but Sarah Palin, as charismatic as she is,  is not, in my opinion, someone who should be in the position of running the greatest country in the world.    I do find it refreshing that Michelle Obama buys her clothes off the rack and the new puppy will be a rescue from the shelter.  I think this time we might have a First Family that can connect with the middle and lower class.  How can someone understand what it is like to need and not be able to get unless they have been there, or have close family that has?    And seriously, over $150,000 for clothing? Come on, this country is in trouble ... dontcha think she coulda got just a few less suits?    Lipstick ... yeah.
gz5O9Tbpaa	Are you a soldier or a dependent? Or is this a hypotheitical question?    I know a soldier that just got a breast reduction for medical reasons. And I know three that have had their eyesight fixed. And one soldier got a nose job. Another soldier got his ears fixed (they stuck out really bad). I dont know of any dependents that have gotten anything "fixed." But I seriously doubt they would give a soldier implants. That's not practical at all.

However you have to pay for the implants. The reason they will do it is because they have cosmetic surgeons that need practice.

Obama is not a black man, but by using the "black" label is not only pandering for the black vote, but disowning his white mother. Obama is also doing a disservice to biracial people, especially biracial children, who experience identity issues, by his perpetuating, if even inadvertenly, the racist "one drop" rules (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/One-drop_ru... and "one race" label that isolates them from their families by forcing them to claim one race.     Then there are the dummies who say he's black because of his looks. But, looks don't constitue claim to a race! There are people of every race that resemble people of other races. "Looks" are not the only genetic material races pass on. Black does not dominate. 46 genes make up the human genome. We get exactly half, or 23, from each parent, regardless of race. Or, that he's black because of his "experiences". Biracial people experience, or better yet *live* white family life and culture; blacks do not. Biracial people also experience racism from blacks.    If he was going through the identity crisis many biracial people face, he could have ended it by accepting BOTH sides of his background. Dismissing his mother is not the way to go. People will never accept and allow biracial people to be themselves, ALL of themselves, with this attitude. Obama needs to insist on being called ALL of what he is-biracial.     If Obama wants to be this "race uniter" he needs to start within himself.|`|rzzYsvXlaa	look at his record of bills he introduced hes racist and an environmental radical  Obama IS racist and a environmental radical . look at the bills he proposed here http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_bil...  everything proposed is either more  inner city freebies or environmental   radical points of view|`|DsQz3CMEaa	Remember ....

Remember, in the eyes of his followers, he NEVER can do anything wrong.|`|vQSzP3iBaa	Hey there.    I'm not exactly sure what he means.    But, I hang out with a white community.  I'm into things that are identified as "white" (Although I detest referring to it as that, it promotes segregation of the ethnicities)    However, I am VERY proud to be black.      I had an old friend of mine who started referring to me as white.  I quickly corrected her.  I am for integration of all ethnicities (I detest calling each other races.  We are all human)    I think what he was saying, or at least hope he was saying, is that he did not wish for people to identify him as white.  There are many great white leaders, and there are few great black leaders (in this time, no dumping out MLK or X)    But, Jesse Jackson and Al Sharpton?  They are poor representatives of the black community.  If I were ever to rise up, even if I were half white, I'd want to identify myself with black people, and there is alot of inequality in this country.  If there is a black leader in a position of power, I do not blame him for trying to correct it, or making it known that he will use his position to try and rectify some of that inequality.      Now, I'm not saying the system is completely fixed to keep other races down.  It's pretty fair when you look at it.  Its the people who regulate the system that are unfair.  Forest Whitaker got dumped because the producer said he was unattractive and black.  The system worked there, because his experience qualified him, but the people behind it failed him because of personal views.    And the ignorance of many will always make things an ethnic issue.  Black people wonder if Obama still identifies with the black people.  Some white people are wondering if he's white enough for them.  Is he going to come in and uproot our superior position?  (And yes.. There is a superior position that is held)    It's always going to be that conflict, that tension there.  Obama is identifying with black people, which is good, because there needs to be a better leader, and there needs to be some changes for all who are oppressed.  And that is not just black, but every other ethnic group white, black, asian, spanish.      If I ever rise to a position where others look to me for guidance, I too will make it clear who I identify with.  My decisions will be swayed, my opinions will be swayed, because of where I come from.    I think he is making that known by his statements here.|`|EHMlqbivaa	Eh, I dunno, that really can be taken out of context...     But I do think he's a little racist, against whites, just from other things he said.|`|oq77sDTFaa	I really wish people would take race out of this election. All sides of race need to be checked at the door. This race should not be about the fact that he is black, but instead the kind of president he would make. I think there are far too many people who call Obama racist, and far too many people that decide just because a person doesnt like him as a candidate for president that they are racist. This is insane. I don't like Obama, but it's because of his stand on things, and his less then favorable history in making decisions in congress... Voting Present is a waste of everyones time. Yay you showed up! Give the man a gold star! I don't like him as a poss. president, but it has nothing to do with race. People need to check that card at the door! This includes all the races, not one race is guiltier then another, racism is made up of people of ALL skin colors!|`|yuGDtjk0aa	The problem isn't racism it's hatred and the answer is love overcoming hate. All the descendants of Adam and Eve on earth are from multi-ethnic lines, but 'God has made of one blood all flesh.'  God is love, turn to Him, follow and obey Him. Vote in someone who does the same. 'For God so loved the world that He gave His only begotten son that whosoever believes in Him should not perish but have eternal life.'

On ne les retrouve pas majoritairement dans nos prisons et ils n'essaient pas d'imposer leurs coutumes religieuses dans nos coles la?ques.    J'ajouterai, comme le dit Kanolix, qu'il y a un discours anti-fran?ais que l'on a constat et pas que dans les stades. Pourquoi alors que l'intgration se passait bien il y a 30 ans?    A partir de l, on peut sortir tous les beaux dicours humanitaires que l'on veut, les faits sont l!    Vous pouvez mettre des pouces en bas. Ca ne changera pas grand-chose  la situation. Malheureusement ne pas regarder le problme en face conduira un jour ou l'autre  des problmes qui seront bien plus importants que ceux qu'on connait dj.    Si, Damien on peut affirmer que seuls certaines catgories d'immigrs sont victimes d'un racisme cibl, le plus souvent en retour de la manire dont ils se conduisent en France, comme nous appeler les "jambon-beurre" ou sifffler la Marseillaise ou autre.    D'ailleurs, peut-on parler de racisme quand il s'agit de lgitime dfense, y compris conomique puisqu'il faut bien qu'il y ait des personnes qui paient pour tout ces immigrs qui dbarquent dans un pays o on a dj la bagatelle de 1000 milliards d'euros de dette que nous allons transmettre  nos enfants.|`|eXY99EKFaa	PFFF ET TA CONNERIE?|`|m8htTWNhaa	oui mais la diffrence c'est que si ton anctre immigr date d'il y a 300 ans, tes anctres ont particip  l'histoire de France, se sont battus dans la Grande Arme, ont guillotin ou t guillotins, bref ils ont une certaine conscience du pays alors que beaucoup d'immigrs rcents ne peuvent pas admettre que la France existait avant eux et que son histoire commence aussi avant leur arrive !|`|c3J7FZZKaa	Moi non...  + de 10 millions annes pp est au village, celui ci a bien changer depuis c vrai|`|VL8DjjN4aa	Chuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuut!

a10fbdf81a9acbf9943c722ffed8c05daa	Do you feel better?  You still have that same hate in your heart when people's great great great greats were around.  Get over yourself, let's talk about lazy people in general.  Did you know there are more white people on welfare than black people, more that sit at home and watch Oprah, more that have 3, 4, or 5 kids?  I hate seeing people's underwear as much as the next, but don't act like it's just black people.  I live in a mixed neighborhood and many boys of all races wear there pants down low.  Let's talk about everybody, where's your rant about the KKK, and other white supremacy groups?  Don't try to bring that weak argument about 95% of black people voting for him, most (88%) black people have voted for democrat for years.  It's not like when white men were running black people decided we just won't vote.  Jesse Jackson ran and we didn't just vote for Jesse because he's black. The same you say about black people can be said about a lot of races.  And learn to spell the president-elects name correctly.|`|8eeee84248737295c60d88565ceb0559aa	88% voted for Kerry, 92% voted for Gore.

Broken hips are very serious in people over 80.  My mother died of one.  She was 82.    Let's suppose what you're saying is true.  Why would Obama need to travel to Hawaii personally to "visit the Hawaii Supreme Court"?  Is that how court works?  Can you just walk up, knock on the door, and say, "Hi, may I please block a request?"    No.  You do it by filing documents.  And documents may be filed from anywhere.|`|EHBX1F54aa	Though I am by no means an Obama supporter, a reliable fact checking website has done this investigation relating to the birth certificate/citizenship question: http://www.factcheck.org/askfactcheck/ha...  This "familial visit" is, in fact, likely a trip for Obama and his lawyers to clear up this issue.  But we can't say with certainty that his citizenship is questionable.    Of course, since the birth certificate's a copy and not the original birth certificate, it's possible that there's fraud involved.  Questions arise from Obama's reluctance to provide a copy of the original birth certificate.  Also, there was a lawyer who filed a suit pursuant to these issues and who received no response from Obama and is thus, by default, "guilty" of the accusations of said lawyer.    I can't make sense of any of this stuff, personally.  It seems like your typical political mudslinging.

That is the only reason our troops should be sent to war.|`|Z391sLTcaa	It was a great move for the USA, america sat on its hands for most of the war and waited till the major fighting had been done and the battlefields had become trenches and germany was now losing. this worked well for the US it gave them a great excuse to start building up there force sizes, at this time america was a very small miltary in comparison to the europeans, also at the end of hostilities america emerged being able to deal with the europeans as an equal, there was a huge boost to their economy, industry and the military, though not as powerful as the europeans, the benchmark was set for the US to start dominating through industry, theyd built many factories, providing munitions, and many other products etc, where as in europe the fighting was literaly on home soil and they now had to rebuild.    So if you are on about this from a nation building perspective, then yes it was a great thing for america, but from a humanitarian point of view was it worth the loss of life, maybe not, but americas loses were little compare to others and they gained a  lot more.|`|1dj4wKCpaa	No, i dont believe in violence|`|oNEi61iLaa	I think so.    First of all, Americans were being killed in the Atlantic by German submarines and that warranted some kind of response. Second, Britain and France were our traditional allies and wanted us to enter the conflict, and it was in everyone's best interest to bring a decisive end to the bloodbath on the Western Front. Although domestically the German Empire was on the brink of collapse, the Germans were preparing new offensives that may ultimately capture Paris.     The U.S. didn't handle the aftermath of the war correctly, though. We should have stopped the Versailles Treaty from being ratified, stayed involved in Europe's affairs, and enetered the League of Nations. However, Americans once again withdrew into isolationism.
Z391sLTcaa	The 1st world war started in the what was the " Austro-Hungarian Empire" which included, austria, hungary, bosnia etc, to cut it short Archduke Ferdinand was assasinated, by members of an organisation known as the black hand, the austro-hungarian empire demanded serbia hand over members of the black hand, serbia asked for russian help, serbia then refused to hand over the group.    This angered the austro-hungarians who then declared war on serbia,  Russia promises assistance to serbia, So germany declared war on the Russians, later they declared war on france.  on the 4th of august, 1914, the german army entered into belgium, and on that same day Britain declared war on Germany! the canadians joined to help britain on the 16th of october 1914, america joined late into the war in april 1917, and the war finished 1918.    thats just a quick run through of the 1st world war from start to finish!, but id say we should blame the serbians, bosnians, austrians, russians and then definatly the germans for using a regional conflict as an excuse to invade everywhere else!|`|MEReSvZeaa	Some duke started the whole thing by dying.|`|3Jd9dGJgaa	The guy(or guys apart of a larger movement or backed by a certain country) who assassinated Archduke Ferdinand.|`|n206tDKlaa	everyone who was involved is to blame|`|5fabd1dde8996146708da2f18d2feea8aa	Geroge W.

The contemporary use of the term first appeared on Usenet groups in the late 1980s . It is thought to be a truncation of the phrase trolling for suckers, itself derived from the sport fishing technique of trolling. The latter can be compared with trawling.  The word likely gained currency because of its apt second meaning, drawn from the trolls portrayed in Scandinavian folklore and children's tales; they are often ugly, obnoxious creatures bent on mischief and wickedness.

The tax credit covers 30 percent of the costs of switching one or more traditional petroleum pumps to E85, which is an 85 percent ethanol/15 percent gasoline blend.    -After a number of inmates on death row were found innocent, Senator Obama worked with law enforcement officials to require the videotaping of interrogations and confessions in all capital cases.    -His first law was passed with Republican Tom Coburn, a measure to rebuild trust in government by allowing every American to go online and see how and where every dime of their tax dollars is spent.    -Obama created the Illinois Earned Income Tax Credit for low-income working families in 2000 and successfully sponsored a measure to make the credit permanent in 2003. The law offered about $105 million in tax relief over three years.    -Obama joined forces with former U.S. Sen. Paul Simon (D-IL) to pass the toughest campaign finance law in Illinois history. The legislation banned the personal use of campaign money by Illinois legislators and banned gifts from lobbyists. Before the law was passed, one organization ranked Illinois worst among 50 states for its campaign finance regulations.    -As a member of the Veterans' Affairs Committee, Senator Obama has fought to help Illinois veterans get the disability pay they were promised, while working to prepare the VA for the return of the thousands of veterans who will need care after Iraq and Afghanistan.    -He traveled to Russia with Republican Dick Lugar to begin a new generation of non-proliferation efforts designed to find and secure deadly weapons around the world.    -Obama has been a leading advocate for protecting the right to vote, helping to reauthorize the Voting Rights Act and leading the opposition against discriminatory barriers to voting.    - In the U.S. Senate, Obama introduced the STOP FRAUD Act to increase penalties for mortgage fraud and provide more protections for low-income homebuyers, well before the current subprime crisis began.    -Obama sponsored legislation to combat predatory payday loans, and he also was credited with lobbied the state to more closely regulate some of the most egregious predatory lending practices.    -Barack Obama introduced the Patriot Employer Act of 2007 to provide a tax credit to companies that maintain or increase the number of full-time workers in America relative to those outside the US; maintain their corporate headquarters in America; pay decent wages; prepare workers for retirement; provide health insurance; and support employees who serve in the military.    -Obama worked to pass a number of laws in Illinois and Washington to improve the health of women. His accomplishments include creating a task force on cervical cancer, providing greater access to breast and cervical cancer screenings, and helping improve prenatal and premature birth services.    -Obama has introduced and helped pass bipartisan legislation to limit the abuse of no-bid federal contracts.    -Obama and Senator Feingold (D-WI) took on both parties and proposed ethics legislation that was described as the "gold standard" for reform.

x7FeQREkaa	Wouldn't you want the best representation possible? Insurance companiesare in business TO MAKE MOEY, not to pay you.   Get a lawyer!|`|2zLzixEpaa	Since you have the same insurance co. as the person at fault, you are probably not going to get as much as otherwise.  The only thing is that you are going to have to pay the attorney about 40% of whatever settlement you get.  I'd try talking to your insurance company first and see what they are going to do for you.  If you're not satisfied with their settlement, you can always call an attorney later.  Just don't sign anything from the insurance company until you're sure that you have all your expenses covered.|`|qcUPST2Faa	Depends. Is your husband seriously injured? If he is, get a lawyer. If he isn't, and the problem is simply lost wages (and your not gonna try and milk this) then your probably going to lose money if you retain/hire a lawyer.|`|r0z1b4JMaa	Go through your insurance first and see how they handle it.    As long as your husband has a police report showing he was hit from behind, then its understood by the law that it was the other person's fault and they need to have all your expenses covered.      Only if it doesn't work out should you try to get a lawyer.  Lawyers are expensive, so its not worth it getting one so soon if the insurance company will help you cover all your expenses.    Good luck!|`|84f6cea88a2203baf96111c850107e71aa	Hopefully he's not hurt now. I'd suggest that you ALWAYS retain a lawyer. And, let him do ALL your talking. It may sound far fetched, but with as fubar as the legal system is today: Some one may sue him for being in the way. You can't win. It's going to cost you: time, money, and attention. Your objective should be to limit your losses. Unfortunately, you need a lawyer.    (The respondent is NOT a lawyer. Nor does this in any way constitute legal advice. It is posted for entertainment value alone. Your unique situation requires the attention of a licensed lawyer, doctor, accountant, and Indian Chief.

If you or him are injured you can collect from them for the lost days of work and any hospital bills not covered by insurance.2. If its a permanent injury you are capable of collecting monies for up to 3 years, or until he can return to work.   Lost work or jobs you can take him, to small claims court for your loses, You have to prove these loses. And you can include, cost and time for filing and fees. Every city or county has there own limit. If though you don't feel your getting a fair shake with insurance co. I would call a lawyer the first time is often free. But, I would call 2 or 3 just to be sure that your not talking to someone involved with that company.

If you leave the US without either the PR (green) card or authorized re-entry, good chance you may not be able to re-enter the US again.|`|8Ev0yYwdaa	Did you people even bother to read his question?    You arrive the US with a Green Card stemp on your passport, the Green-CARD is exactly like the stemp in your passport, the CARD is not important if the green card is stemped in your passport.  You are a US permanent resident it takes alittle while to get the card itself but you can obtain a SSN using your passport that is stemped with a green-card and get a job.  You can live in the US and go back if you got your passport stemped with a green card but the immigration clerk when you enter the airport can take your green-card away if he think that you are not planning to live in the US.     And if you leave for 6 months its a big problem and if you leave for a year you lose you green-card for sure.  It goes like this, Green-Card to citizenship = 5 years, if you live in the US for 3 years and then get out of the US for 6-11 months, when you come back you will have to wait another 5 years to citizenship, it reset, and also if you go for 1-6 months and the immigration clerk will suspect that you are not living in the US and coming once every few months to keep your green card - he will deport you and take your green-card.  If you leave for 1 year then your green-card cancles itself automaticly and you are not longer a US resident.    But short trips are ok, and you don't need a Green-Card's card if you got the stemp on your passport, the stemp is the important part and this stemp gives you the rights of a US permanent resident.

vFvI16P7aa	He wants a THIGH holster to carry a weapon with a CCW?  Either it wouldn't be concealed or he'd never be able to reach it down his pants.  Nylon is fine though.|`|bnJPvsVWaa	I was going to ask the same question.  A pancake, belt, or hip holster would bring to mind a concealed handgun.  A thigh holster makes me immediately think of tactical team gear, where the pistol hangs just above the knee, with nylon straps around the thigh.    Nylon is fine, but you will want to be cautious of a few things.  In order to carry safely, the holster must completely cover the trigger, while not riding up the trigger guard far enough as to interfere with the master grip.  Likewise, the thumb break should cross the rear of the slide, not the backstrap of the grip, under the beavertail, again to prevent interference with the master grip.   The master grip concept is simply that, while reaching for your pistol, the hand should be able to grip the pistol in a good shooting grip, while still in the holster.  You should then be able to draw and shoot, without having to change hand position.    Rule out all your catalogue-esque combination holsters with spring-steel clips (ie: your gun and holster fall off your waist together) and extra magazine pouches, whistles, bells, spinners and other unneeded things.    While there are a bunch of good holster makers out there, take a look at Uncle Mike's cordura nylon belt-slide holsters.   A size 15 should fit the Sigma .40.   If you can, look at one in a gun store/range, where you can have them slide a pistol into it, so as to see the fit.  Then you can have an idea of what to look for in the fit of other manufacturers.    For the price range, in cordura nylon, though...Uncle Mike's is one of the best.   If you want kydex, the other hot choice in black tactical holsters, there will be a problem as the Sigma isn't a common enough pistol to have many stock molded / fitted holsters out there.  It would need to be custom made, which would be way more expensive than is needed.  You might have luck fitting it into holsters designed for the new M&P pistols, but I am not sure of their specs.    Now for the bad news.  I'm afraid I have to agree with the answerer who recommended a different gun.  While .40SW caliber pistols are very popular for defense and law enforcement, the S&W Sigma series was designed to be their answer to the Glock, but fell vastly short in the quality arena.    They have been very prone, historically, to catastrophic failure (goes "click" instead of "bang") without any warning.  The main purpose of a pistol being to keep yourself and your loved ones alive, I would lean toward a pistol that I'm sure would fire when I needed it.    It's been quite a while since I've been in the new-pistol industry, but  H&K, Glock, and Sigarms (in no particular order) were leading the reliability race at the time, followed by some of the Springfields, Berettas, and even the Ruger pistols, as a cheaper alternative.  Now, I have heard that the Springfield XD and the new S&W M&P are both holding their own, but I'd probably still steer clear of the S&Ws.    Back to the holster, if it's a tactical thigh rig he wants, do your very best to discourage him.   Defense handguns are most effective when they're a surprise.  Any criminal with half a  brain, on seeing an open gun, would simply devise a plan to take it out of play first. (ie: shooting before making his presence known, bum-rushing from a blind alley, etc.) and then they have your gun too.  :-(|`|Q7ovix19aa	Black nylon web is what he wants, but that is no good for concealed carry.  Also get him the thin, pancake type.  Gun stores will know what that means.  They're available in the nylon web as well as leather.    Forget littlhrse's .45 calibre.  That's obsoleted by the .40 S&W calibre.  Most police are going to the .40, and ultimately the military probably will.|`|zRpwYhLJaa	Bianchi makes both leather, which I prefer, and nylon holsters that are excellent.    Safariland is also a great brand, and I believe they also make both leather and nylon.    Yes, nylon is strong enough.  I have and use both leather and nylon.    You should forget the holster and get him a different gun,  .45 Colt.

xLqMubuBaa	Probation is a second chance to avoid incarceration.Parole is an early release after incarceration.  They both involve reporting,urine tests for drug offenses,restitutions if applicable,etc.|`|1KGXts5Daa	Probation: either formal (supervised, through the probation dept. with a Probation Officer assigned), or informal (non-supervised) is by order of the court, for a period of time (1-3 years is common for many misdemeanor offenses) during which, the person who is on probation waives a number of their constitutional rights.  Primarily, for the duration of probation, a person is immediately "search-able" by any peace officer (person, vehicle, living quarters).  Officers do not need "probable cause" because the fact that a person is currently on probation is probable cause in, and of, itself.    Parole: Parole is early release from Prison (either state or federal) after serving time on felony conviction(s).  A parolee has been deemed appropriate for early release by a prison parole board and is assigned to a parole officer/agent, with specific conditions to check in as to whereabouts, movement, associates, etc., submit to drug screenings, etc.  Parolees are generally not automatically search-able by anyone other than their parole officer/agent.|`|rU4DlyHvaa	probation is the time period after completion of training and waiting to become permanant in his/her appointment.  parole is the period granted for a prisoner by authorities to visit their relatives|`|01a19d2b8982bebcfca1b5520fa5d1e1aa	Probation:    The act of suspending the sentence of a person convicted of a criminal offense and granting that person provisional freedom on the promise of good behavior.     Parole    The release of a prisoner whose term has not expired on condition of sustained lawful behavior that is subject to regular monitoring by an officer of the law for a set period of time.       I guess the jobs are pretty much the same..for you to report into them and prove youre keeping your end of the bargain.|`|qwaWd14vaa	Probation:  For the vast majority of offenders, incarceration is not warranted. Granted by the Judge as a part of the sentencing process, the judge will then suspend the sentence, granting probation in place of the sentence, which can also include home confinement or electronic monitoring. Probation also touches on the areas of individual counseling, Job development skills, substance abuse, family counseling, detoxification and health care needed. (1997 stats 59% on Probation)    Parole:  In many states it has been abolished due to the justice model of determinate sentencing, which was designed to eliminate the uncertainty of prison terms, based upon release through parole and the popular indeterminate sentencing guidelines developed in many states. Thus many states have an End of Sentence or (EOS) date once sentenced.   This tells an inmate his actual time to be served in prison and an expected date for release. Upon release under an EOS, there is no recidivism since the sentence has been completed. Unlike parole where the inmate is released to society and expected to serve out the rest of their sentence ordered by the court, while on parole.   Parole is a function of being released and usually has a 3 to 5 member board to review inmates cause(s) for retaining them in the prison as incarceration, or release based upon the criteria of how they are as an inmate in Prison, as a Model Prisoner or a troublemaker.  As one who has applied themselves for release or one who has done nothing to advance their job skills or education while incarcerated.   The victim(s) of the crime may attend a hearing and give input as to why, or why not, they believe this inmate should, or should not, be released back to society. (1997 stats are 14% are on parole)  1997 stats are that the other 27 % remain incarcerated.    Professionals of probation and parole have the same job of monitoring and reporting monthly on their case load of as many as 250 inmates to the courts.  Probation is usually a county or city to report to a judge.  Parole is a state hearing,  as to a violation, or not, their adjustment back to society, which is usually revoked, since the person had violated the terms and conditions of parole.
6W6B26sgaa	You still had an open container in your car, nonetheless. It doesn't matter if you're driving or not. I'm not sure how much it will cost you, but it will go on your record. At least it's not a DUI, those stay on you forever.
RANWeh9Uaa	Nice another woman who thinks she needs a criminal for a boyfriend. Your mom must be proud|`|uh2bkRrFaa	Can anyone decipher this post for me, I don't speak idiot.    Is "Clementay" the name of her boyfriend? What does this post mean?|`|ljmE8eLLaa	You have a lot of class. All of it low.|`|LMPK5WBaaa	jeez...
esOaJoqBaa	In addition to the above mentioned answers, a HAHO jump allows more time for the jumper to be spotted and thus shot at or intercepted upon landing. I'm pretty sure those are done mostly at night because of this.|`|BRyRtQSvaa	Depends if you are wearing an altimeter or not|`|tFoFchuEaa	They both have their own sets of unique dangers. HAHO jumps can be deadly if you get blown off course, or lose oxygen that high up.    HALO jumps are dangerous because of the fact that you don't have time to react if your chute doesn't deploy properly.|`|dzdlk3vEaa	I would say HAHO jumps. Because, like the guy above me said, getting blown away due to the high opening. The chances of your chute failing you on a HALO jump is much less likely than being blown away on a HAHO. But, that is all taken into account.     If it wasn't dangerous, it wouldn't be fun.
Fmo4ZgYjaa	Because states with more gun violence NEED more gun laws.  You are mixing up the chicken and the egg.  Or the cart before the horse.  Or something.....Gun laws don't cause gun violence.  Gun violence causes gun laws.|`|m5FyTeYgaa	I'm not for gun control, but this is one question where I must break ranks. The cause and effect is not as simple as the NRA would like to make it.    First, the reason these places have strict laws is that crime was high in the first place. There is a culture of violence already in place.    Second, these places tend to be urban. Urban people don't grow up exposed to guns the way us country kids do. They are never taught to use and respect guns.    Third, these places tend to be on the low end of the economic spectrum. Some poor urban kids don't see any way out but gangs and crime.    In other words, Chicago is going to have high crime rates regardless. Doesn't matter whether you ban guns, or hand them out like candy.    Of course, the opposite is true in rural areas with lax gun laws. We don't have much crime of any kind. It makes the news when the local Turkey Hill gets robbed, whether a gun was used or not.     We all own guns around here, but we use them for hunting, pest and predator control, and target shooting. Never heard of a drive by shooting around here, even though all the kids own guns. Go figure.|`|TEsq9K54aa	warren peace is 100% correct.  The Count would be proud of him.|`|B6c7BeDnaa	when you outlaw guns,only criminals will have guns.|`|8tf5rOXdaa	Because private citizens don't have the ability to fight back and provide a deterrent.|`|fbb4ab0738eb7d2ea8be8024fec8d32aaa	Because only the bad guys have the guns.  Bad guys don't give a tinker's damn about gun laws.|`|rUNlmQG5aa	Logically it would make the most sense to have the most strict laws in the states where the most gun crimes take place- also, possibly the ones with the most illegals, Mexican and Back gangs, etc. But its' just a guess. Canada allows guns yet has few murders owing to the lack of gang violence by minorities and far less proliferation of assault weapons,  Britain, very few due to difficulties obtaining them. That's just common sense. Perhaps only in Texas does carrying a gun make sense because of the inherent 'cowboy attitude'. In any case, its' too late for America to withdraw its' guns at this late date thanks to the NRA. The cat is out of Pandora's Box, to mix a metaphor. I hate guns but at this point they would have to pry it out of my dead, cold hands. Gun laws as they are now have ceased to make sense for some time, i live in a gun- crazed culture, period, end of story.|`|YnlT7m8raa	Unarmed victims make the best targets.|`|cPQ7TBcuaa	Because, gun restrictions keep guns out of the hands of law-abiding citizens...The crooks are going to get guns regardless of the laws against them. The criminals are also less hesitant to invade a home if there is a small chance that the homeowner has a gun to defend themselves.|`|AA11086243	clearly, there is a reason they have "the strictest gun laws"...     because they have had the most problems with guns...    you have a big problem, you take steps to fix it...    EDIT: to say the problem is the law, would assume that gun crime has gotten worse, since the law has been in place... I highly doubt that in most of these states... in fact, it's improved in at least some I believe...    EDIT2: a list    http://www.statemaster.com/graph/cri_gun...    but NY has about the toughest gun policies in the nation, if I remember correctly... and they are 32nd... just saying...|`|BQQLZa7Baa	i doubt gun laws caused more gun related homicides. in fact it's probably vice versa.|`|b57ca6a213f670d2f4c464725b3fb119aa	Because the bad guys are always going to have them, no matter how many laws say they shouldn't!|`|BImIMnbzaa	You know, that's true.  Chicago is a perfect example of a failed gun control policy and the highest homicide rate in the country.    Richie Daley, the aging head of the political machine in Chicago, is also a proponent of hand gun control.  He doesn't even want them in people's homes.  Yet the crime rate was over 500 homocides in 2008, in Chicago.    With Daley's policies in force, the felons know that they are the only one's with weapons, so it's relatively easy to hold up people.  If those same citizen's had a right to carry, those same felons would be taking their trade to another state.  They don't like operating under the assumption that the other guy may have a weapon, too !    For years, people have been trying to convince Daley that his policy is flawed.  But, Daley being the stubborn old cuss that he is, refuses to budge.|`|isbGvDRZaa	Because the places with the biggest problems are the ones most likely to do something about it.  The criminal gun lobby, however, has plenty of political influence to keep anything meaningful from having much effect because guns are so easily obtainable in nearby jurisdictions.
p1bpXfb5aa	>>Because they are stupid and they are babies..  whaaaaaaaaaaa!!!!!!!|`|2ieiGIhTaa	Thats just what they do.|`|p9rbEdpdaa	There certainly was election fraud (not voter fraud) in Ohio, but the Republican again are four years late in fessing up to it. Anyone with a brain (I guess that excludes a lot of conservatives) knows that not one illegal vote can be attributed to ACORN. They gather registration cards, but is up to the election board to certify that the registration is valid. Is this another Republican lie? I don't know. I never know when they are being dishonest, when they are being delusional or when they are just plain dumb, so I would hesitate to call it a lie.|`|auUeI2Vnaa	Yeah, I'm sure there was voter fraud on both ends....but I'm sure you'd never believe a Democrat could ever do anything wrong....they are all perfect politicians.|`|AA10206116	You mean like when dead people were voting for JFK?|`|xUQDTEbZaa	ACORN was registration fraud...not voter fraud.|`|88f430b4f419cb62981931e8380f7878aa	Their too attached to themselves and too restricted in the thinking!     There hasn't been a true progressive republican president since Teddy Roosevelt!|`|YcgEmrRkaa	GOP say lies all the time.  You cannot believe any of them|`|Xk8AzsMmaa	here is a great video that will help explain this  peace  http://ca.youtube.com/watch?v=JmHmrJlD3e...|`|f7PlvV4Baa	Liberals are the ones doing the VAST MAJORITY of voter fraud. Otherwise how the hell do you think Al Franken would've won Minnesota??? They've been doing it forever.|`|Mhm3J5g0aa	Ummm, so it sounds like you were wrong, so how does that make the republicans a liar again ?  In any case, the democrat party has been riddled with voter fraud from the Black Panthers trying to intimidate people in Philadelphia, to ACORN to trying to give illegals a driver licenses in New York.  Just how skewed are you that you can't use your brain ? Isn't there a flag that should be going off in your head that all these news items come up and are almost ALL against the democrats a problem ?  Get your head out of the sand people, do some investigation and stop selling your soul along party lines and consider that fact that your wrong or supporting a corrupt party.  Besides, there is a big difference between a lie and an accusation. If there's suspected inpropiety then it has to be addressed, which means someone needs to bring it up and have it investigated. What i've seen in the past 18 months is that the average democratic voter is a mindless robot and will do and believe what they are told to do. I see all this corruption exposed about the democratic party and still it doesn't phase you. Sure, there's bad republicans too, but not at the same level of reports or depths of corruption.  For example, you whined about Larry Craig for supposedly soliciting sex in a mens room.....(which is against the law how ? ) yet you excuse Foley who had not only a mistress...but 2....and he paid one off for her silence $121,000. Or maybe compare him to the democrat that ran the prostitution ring out of this home. You can't compare the democratic party apples to apples with the republicans.  The only sand you can take that would make any sense at all is just be anti Government in general. But you can't win that because its the liberals and socialists you've given home to in the democratic party that will push against that.|`|CHPuw61Uaa	You mean like how Abraham Lincoln and the Republicans were always so wrong during the Civil War and Reconstruction while the Democratic Party represented the uncompromising bulwark of freedom against Southern slavery? Yup, made the Republicans look pretty bad.|`|ErTVzpUUaa	Obamabot really fits you!  Loser!|`|41ebd12ba67eeb8a3a4ac05bc524403caa	Nice that you researched one article and came up with that lie. Guess what, there are dozens of cases still under investigation in Ohio. And many votes that were thrown out. Like the house on Brownlee ave in Columbus where over 10 out of state students registered in Ohio for absentee ballots. Do your research there is plenty of fraud out there and most of in from the liberal side.      SFC  US Army  Retired|`|AA12021966	One voter fraud found would not change that Ohio went to Obama.|`|lMElMTaJaa	i'm not going to watch your video..but maybe ohio didn't have voter fraud...but they busted other states doing it. their were thousands that did it. so look into it before you post up anything about it.|`|r4ar6YKhaa	I would like to see you do better. Also, Obama is turning the country socialist, and we will be just like the Europe so we will unable to be unique any longer, causing us to lose tourism and further worsening our economy.|`|fVzIR1lKaa	it,s a liberal pillock propaganda lie by all you pillocks in the far left and your bollack president obama and the pill takers.
raImBqwraa	They're not. None of the combat ops I was on in the sand involved rangers at all, except when we had to clean up their mess. Ask Stan Darsh about retaking cities the Rangers couldn't keep clear.|`|0szdPqI0aa	Well, Rangers are no where near being like Delta or Devgru, but they are a highly moveable , highly trained infantry group.  they are the best INFANTRY out there.  they are elite infantry.  The reason why they are always backing up Devgru in Delta, and other spec ops like Regular Seals, and Green berets, is because if they those elite units get into trouble or need back up in their mission, the best is to call the rangers, because they are quick , large and lethal.    When lets say 12 green berets get into trouble on a recon mission, and their cover gets blown, and their are hundreds of bad guys on their way to kill them, it probably wont be the smartest idea just to send a few more green berets, because they might just get outnumbered because their force is too small, ( even though they could take a whole lot of them out). so the best thing is to send in a ranger task force. Why? because they are a large group to take on a large force, they are quick. and they do not need too many special things that other spec ops need.    they are just perfect for that.  they are Elite, but also big.|`|mr8isJoZaa	First, are you even in the military, and secondly, if you are going to put Rangers down, at least have the courtesy to use proper grammar and spelling.  Third, craiggers is an idiot.
tDozNqOyaa	No, no, no, no.    The language of the article reveals it as a lie! How can you, in good conscience, propagate this lie?! In the first paragraph of the article it states "the blockbuster Democratic stimulus package would provide up to a whopping $5.2 billion for ACORN". Seemingly, indisputable fact. Yet, the third paragraph states "revised language in the stimulus bill would make the funds available directly to non-profit entities such as ACORN".    So the issue is that these funds are being put into things that ACORN has a hand in. That is not sneaking money to ACORN. If I put change in the little tray at 7-11 and a drug dealer comes along and uses my change I am not funding a drug dealer.     This article is completely bogus. It's Anti-ACORN republicans like Matthew Vadum spinning the facts into whatever they want them to mean.

GMYNuFCDaa	Federalism gives more power to the states, and there was an argument about states rights before the civil war. The Confederate States were more angry about the rest of the country telling them how to run their business than they were about emancipation. Many wanted states to deal with it on their own time, and there was a push to free slaves in the Southern states, as well as the North. It was the very rich democrats who wanted to keep slavery going, and the middle class in the South and North, who wanted to let them free.    The middle class people in the South were angered to the point some went to war on the side of the confederacy because of the states rights issue, even if they believed slaves should be freed. And many others in the South fought for the Union, and most of that was to free slaves and preserve the Union. The wrap that most of those fighting on the Union side were not for freeing slaves is false.    The issue was very intense and very complex, with most people in the US agreeing that slavery should end. The sentiment against slavery lead to the creation, and the extremely rapid rise of the republican party. Those who say the Republican party was not created over the slavery issue, are dead wrong. That was what it was all about. Not the only issue they held agreement on, but it was the catalyst and the main cause.|`|Rlvo5P9maa	For it is written, thou shalt to thy own homework, or God shall smite thee.|`|6TzqioFraa	UL    Mugwamp is one of those pathetic has no life types who pumps up their own stats by asking questions on other IDs then giving themselves best answer.

Even after you pay off your home you rent the land beneath it from the government and they call it "property taxes". The banks and government own everything. That's why the Republicans were happy to bail out Wall Street bankers.    How about prices of homes just getting back to reasonable?  They are overpriced and no one can afford them.  When things are priced too high they do not sell.    How about looking at reasonable explanations instead of blame?    How about saving your money instead of living on credit cards and mortgages?    How about caring about your job and delivering some real good worthwhile service to someone?    How about not bombing innocent women and children in Bagdad on borrowed money from China?

Then, when he was 20 years old, he met me :)    I disagreed with everything he was ever told and raised to believe...When he said, "You can't change what life hands you" I asked, "Why not?"...When he said there were no jobs and no opportunites where he lived, I said "Move"...When he said "You just don't understand, you've never lived like this"...I said, "You're right, I've never lived like that because I never wanted to, so I chose not to...You're also right that I don't understand, so explain it to me"...When he ran out of answers, he decided to actually TRY for a change (maybe to prove me wrong and show me that there really was no chance to change, who knows?)...He moved out of his mother's dump, got a job, started paying bills.    He now argues with people who try to say that they can't change their own lives, and he asks the same questions I asked him, but when they get to the "You don't understand" part, he says "Oh, yes I do...I really do"...He is a Republican now, and we have been together for 5 years...He takes excellent care of himself AND his family, paying for our house, working hard, feeding us, paying the bills on time with NO help from the government whatsoever...He is extremely proud of himself and he is now a very OPTIMISTIC person who believes that you can accomplish whatever you want, if you work for it, no matter where you come from or what you were born into.    People can use those 'raised in poverty' excuses until they turn 18...After that, they are adults, and the decisions they make are their own.

By 1964 I was a republican as I sat in the jungles of Vietnam. A few years later after I left the military, I considered a change again, but the bad aftertaste of being democrat came back and I stayed Republican for a while longer. I am now older and wiser and realize there is no difference in the two major parties, nor is there much in any party line. I am, therefore now an independent and will not conform to any party line, believing that all politicians are nefarious in nature, born in the wool liars, who are only in the business because they are too lazy to work, and prefer to be a part of the scum of the earth.

For all intents and purposes, after the kid is born Republicans are far more dangerous to him or her.      They are more likely to get your kid killed in war.     They are more likely to make it harder for you to feed your kid when they destroy the economy with excess spending and not covering it; which leads to a high National Debt and a de-valuing of the dollar.  You can find evidence of that in Bush, who despite cutting spending still managed to send the $4 trillion National Debt he inherited up to $11 trillion.  You do realize that your kid is among those who will have to pay that back, right?    If you run into financial problems and can't afford healthcare, they make you pay for your own.  But even if you can afford healthcare and the health insurance companies refuse to pay, the Republicans also make it more difficult and more expensive for you to have any legal recourse.  In other words, if your kid gets sick then Republicans make it nearly impossible for you to pay, and actually impossible to force the health insurance company you've been throwing your money away on to pay it either.    And if this is a deal over now that you've been a mother, you don't understand how anyone can kill a baby (in abortion), then you should be going Democrat as well.  Democrats are against abortion, they just prefer to do it by showing young girls how to use the control over their own bodies responsibly, rather than taking it away from them.    Abstinence-only education works great for many kids; but doesn't work for ALL kids.  And if those kids don't know how to protect themselves, they get pregnant.    Republicans refuse to show them how to protect themselves, and refuse to help the kid with some help programs to give her incentive to keep the child.  They say she should have known better.  Which may be true, but they didn't teach her, and "should have known better" doesn't feed that kid.    Democrats show her how to avoid becoming pregnant.  They press abstinence and parental involvement as well, but also birth control for those who may make the wrong decision.  Then if she doesn't get pregnant, there is no baby to abort.  But if she does get pregnant, they help her.  They provide her things like welfare and medicaid so that even if her family and the baby's father can't or won't stand by her, she still has some help.  And hopefully that will be enough to convince her to keep the baby.        Abortion rates went up under Reagan and George H.W. Bush, went to their lowest level ever under Bill Clinton, then shot up to their highest level ever under George W. Bush.  That should tell you that Democrats ideas on education are far better adapted to this problem than Republican ideas.      Being a mother should have led you to becoming Democrat, not Republican.  Republicans are good people, but their ideas don't work; and on top of that make things seriously worse.          Add-on:    The situation is what it is.  You don't have to like it, but you do have to accept it.     Malcolm Equis is correct.  Conservatism is a great idea, but Republicans don't follow it anymore.  Democrats are the Conservatives.  They do spend less than Republicans.    The three biggest spenders in American history were (in order from most to 3rd most):    1) George W. Bush (R)    2)  Richard Nixon (R)    3) Ronald Reagan (R)      And the biggest expanse of government occurred in 2002 under a Republican Congress and approved by Republican President George W. Bush.      Every single economic problem we have can be traced back to the falling dollar, which can be traced back to the National Debt, which can be traced back to the Iraq War.    Republicans need to get back to their roots of Conservatism; and when they do they will be Democrats.          Add-on:    I am not talking about having the government raise your kids.  I'm talking about not letting Republicans destroy your own ability to raise your kids.    They destroy the economy because they spend too much, but don't cover their spending.  You cannot provide for your kids if you cannot get a job because the economy is collapsing.  You don't need government, you need them to stay out of your way.    And Democrats keep the government out of your way by not overspending.  Republicans have the right philosophies, and everything that Rush complains about is correct.  He is just attacking the wrong party.  Rush IS right, but it is Republicans who are doing it wrong; Democrats are actually doing it correctly.    They spend less, they cover their spending, and they spend it here.  As long as were are on it, in addition to abortion rates going down under Clinton so did welfare rates.  Those also went way high under Geoge W. Bush, because he spent trillions in Iraq.  He took it to billions for war operations on a war that has already gone 6 years (when he thought only 6 months); then into the trillions when he borrowed the money to pay for it at very high interest rates.    The economy is collapsing because of that decision.  He spent, he spent at extremely high and exponentially growing interest rates, and got no return on that spending.    Republicans have the right philosophies.  And after you're done listening to them so that you have the right ideas, you will see that it is the Democrats who follow them and NOT Republicans.    Republicans force the government into the lives of women, gays, non-Christians, non-believers, and most of all the poor.  You want government out of your life?  Democrat is the way to go.|`|DB7UMkGCaa	"Actually, I started out hugely Republican. You couldn't have gotten more to the right than me."    You expect us to buy that, Malcolm?|`|U9XlITtHaa	I did.

You couldn't have gotten more to the right than me.    Now I am a Democrat, because it has become quite apparent that the Democrats are the party of Conservatism.  They spend less, spend here, and cover their spending.    Whereas Republicans spend far more, spend it destroying another country only to rebuild it for a second and a third and a fourth demolition, all to make it look like they are protecting us from a threat that exists in an entirely different country.        Edit:    You can save that bullsh*t right now.  I have never once been on welfare, and in fact have never even been in debt.    Everything that I own I bought myself.  I take care of all of my responsibilities.      I have even taken in two Vietnam veterans, one with his kid, because the Republican Congress refused their benefits because "they cost too much."  They couldn't afford to stay in their houses, and I took all three of them in and provided the benefits as best I could.  They fought for this country, and Republicans tossed them to the wolves for it.    My best friend is a Republican.  He's a good guy, but ran into debt trouble a while back when he lost his job.  I helped him through it with a loan that eventually just became a gift because he still can't afford to repay it.  I don't hold it against him, because he is getting screwed by the economy.    He is doing his best, and he just got screwed on luck.  And that is the problem with so many Republicans.  You'd rather tell a good guy down on his luck "tough sh*t, don't be so lazy next time" then help him out.    He is one of your own, always worked and worked hard.  I've always worked and worked hard.

If you believe in socialism/have a socialistic point of view I believe that that is patriotic, because helping those who are in trouble and ensuring that everyone has the right and ability to pursue happiness and liberty is exactly what the united states constitution was written for, that said, It is NOT the same thing as having a bunch of people on welfare being lazy and not pursuing their full potential, but sometimes a helping hand during a tough time or giving opportunities to the less fortunate can actually help society and make any country a better place for everyone|`|VXk8EZoHaa	NO BUT BEING MEXICAN IS|`|BQY8b2YOaa	Yes, because those beliefs will destroy America.

What it seems no one is looking at is the global effect, similar to the build up to WW2, its a global recession, yes places like China are better off then England or the U.S. at the moment but they're still feeling the recession.    So would we be having a financial crisis as a communist nation ? yes Would it be different ? yes.    Instead of it springing from sources like the housing bubble it would come from a lack of export and a surplus of product, China, a communist country, largely survives off its exports and interest owed from the U.S. With the largest GDP in the world suffering, there's less demand for goods from China.

Maybe he is voting based on his wallet and selfish motivations. The point is, it has been proven many times that a person can win an election for a political position if he runs a more sucessful campaign or pays more people off. Even the messiah Obama stooped to lies, deception, all spanish ads that skewed the truth, so no one in politics is safe.  You might not vote for company leaders, but guess what ? They are subject to the free market IF Government doesn't interfer with bail outs, or give aways, or special funding or favoratism.

So, Einstein... should we pour another $10 trillion into that crap hole of a country? I think not. According to the "Moron-in-Chief" the oil revenues were supposed to fund their war. We should have "nuked 'em" back to the Stone Age.. or better yet dropped the neutron bomb on them and we could have had all the oil Bush/Cheney wanted without American troops dying.

Saddam Hussein was a terrorist both in his own right, and as a state sponsor (paying Palestinian families $25,000, which he stole from the UN Oil-for-Food program, to those who blew themselves up to kill Israeli's).  Also, do not forget that attemptinmg to hire a hitman to murder a former leader of any nation (which Saddam did in 1998) is considered an act of war.|`|Xk8AzsMmaa	WATCH LOOSE CHANGE FINAL CUT...IT WILL EXPLAIN EVERYTHING  PEACE|`|xQgciq09aa	At the time of the invasion of Iraq, this Iraqi Captain's eye witness account about Iraq's involvement in 9/11, was believed by many Republicans and Democrats in Washington.    It was not disproved until 2005.    Saddam Hussein was the real source of most of the bad intelligence.      He wanted all his potential rivals, foreign and domestic, to believe he had access to the WMDs and was ready to use them again.    He wanted all his people, including military officers like Khodada, to believe that, all the terrorists who hit the US on 9/11 were trained in Iraq, and that OBL was the one taking false credit for the attack.    His absolute control over Iraq, made it very difficult and expensive to disprove the fake intelligence he was feeding the spies America's CIA had working in that area.|`|280a2e214bf05397a5b94e4faa4b6d61aa	So if people who think that Iraq caused 9/11 are "idiots"...what do we call the people who think a 9/11 link was the ONLY justifiable reason to go into Iraq?    A good chunk of the American people felt that the Japanese were pretty good gardeners, but weren't really clever enough to be a real threat to the U.S. prior to 1941.....A good chunk thought that the War in Europe was none of our business...    But it's like this....regardless of how smart we think we are, we do not define reality...On December 7, 1941 a lot of people were forced to suddenly realize that the world was not the neat little package they thought it was.    On 9/11 the world changed again.  Prior to that day, many thought we were doing a pretty good job in the Middle East...meaning that they were happy to not have to think about it much...    But 9/11 told all those people that they were wrong... tragically... massively.. .wrong.  Anyone who said our plan for Iraq and Iran was "working" was proven a fool.    Was it the right choice?  History will decide that...    ...but it's certainly not a laughing matter...|`|6a29fa9432cd11f6628b8d1ef1265ca6aa	No, none at all.|`|wVik8Fo7aa	None.  A consensus of the intelligence communities agreed that there was no connection and presented these facts to the Bush administration.  This did not fit with their ideology of "preventive war", "spreading democracy", "controlling the oil fields", etc., so they proceeded to cherry-pick the top-secret reports and lied to achieve their goals.  For the full story regarding Cheney's mission regarding Iraq, please read "Angler" by Barton Gellman.  A mind-boggling experience!|`|95gEZ22Caa	Bush|`|5rXzu0IWaa	I have watched George Bush's lips when he told us that he never said there was a connection. He claimed that he only said there were contacts between Al Queda and Saddam.    If you download the 911 commission report you will find that an official from Al Queda made contact with one of Saddam's generals. He asked for funding saying that they had a mutual enemy. The U.S. Saddam rebuffed the effort.    No wonder. Al Quaeda has  been trying to overthrow Saddam for a decade.|`|GMYNuFCDaa	No, and there was no proof linking termites to 911 either, but people still went to war against termites. Was that an unwarranted war too? lol    There were many reasons to go to War with Iraq, none of which the press really talk about. That should tell you something.    There is more than this like the fact that every country in the UN security council using their own intelligence determined unanimously that Saddam not only had WMD, but was an immanent threat to use it. The 17 broken UN resolutions in a row, the treaty in which the forces lined up against Iraq at the end of desert storm agreed not to finish him and remove him from power, that he broke constantly for 13 years from nearly day 1 ... that was more than just cause, it was our obligation to follow the agreement through or no other treaty would ever mean anything again.    This is the strategic side, the most important consideration because of the possible effects of the whole Iraq thing on the world ... but this is what you most often don't hear.    Well most people don't understand the forces in action in the world surrounding Iraq at the time before we invaded them.    We could have Russia and China positioned with Iraq in control of the middle east oil supply. That was in the works.    That would make for an extremely powerful Russia, China and Middle Eastern alliance. That could well have shifted the power balance in the world.    Saddam had UN People in his pocket, and was working with Russia, China, France, and Germany using the promise of cheap oil contracts, and Russia and China were giving Saddam military aid and were part of a emerging alliance with what was to be an Iraq free of UN sanctions, and the treaty Saddam signed at the end of the Gulf War, which he consistently broke.    You know Russia would have then started re-consolidating the USSR. No one in Europe would have tried to stop them because their oil supply would have been cut off. We don't have to wonder about that, because Russia has played that card already.    The world would be hard put to stop such an alliance, because they would basically have most of the world by the boo boo, and could continue to get stronger and stronger until they could do about what they wanted.    911 really screwed that up for them. No way would the US have gone to war to stop them unless 911 attacks angered us and opened our eyes first.    It was a very good thing that we did what we did, but most of the world will never see it that way. I mean if Churchill had won out and they had taken down Hitler before WWII the pacifists in Europe would still be talking about that Idiot Churchill and his illegal unnecessary war ... but they called Churchill an idiot, didn't listen to him, and the worst happened so they have the proof. Thankfully, we don't have the proof of what awful thing could have happened if the US and UK had not stepped in to stop Saddam ... so we will probably hear all the crap about the unnecessary war for a long time to come, but at least that is better than what could have occurred, what did occur leading up to and through WWII. Know what I mean?|`|Sqp6HjtMaa	B00sh himself said there was no link between 9/11 and Iraq. Lol.|`|TFdKrkP2aa	Nope not a single shred.|`|deb6cc217f6d8548e316ea609387df06aa	Dude, I still cannot believe people think we invaded Iraq because of 9/11!

AA12191521	Yes, this is the very definition of a hate crime. A crime motivated by racial animosity. Personally I think just calling it assault is good enough. But since hate crime laws do exist, they should be applied fairly in all situations.|`|8C9yJ0Bwaa	Not really unless the kids show elsewhere that they have resentment/hate towards others.   If the kid is white, than saying "whitey," isn't really hating. Its a slang for white.    Plus, its blacks against a white...    Had it been several white guys yelling at some black person saying,"get the blackey," My God, the situation would be different...    Of course you can make it into some racist act, if you just choose your words correctly. I would just let it go, its just some kids being kids....Happens again, then take action.|`|CeBqzHovaa	Was that the entire situation?

There is NO excuses for killing beautiful babies so you can tell your teacher that. NONE. We shouldn't even be killing horrible criminals! So why the heck are we killing BABIES?! This country has taken a turn in the last century. A turn for the worst. If a girl got pregnant who's fault is that? If a girl gets raped, well that is horrible. But that is life. Why go killing? Have you ever seen one of those pictures of an aborted baby? If you haven't already I wouldn't suggest looking it up because it is sickest most horrible image I have ever seen in my whole life. I can cry just thinking about  it. People who are for abortion should just see THOSE images. Your teacher should.

teKeLxX2aa	FDR is consistently ranked higher, but I would say do a paper on Jackson, just in case your in the mood for a challenge and want to learn a thing or two about what it used to mean to call yourself a man back in the old days. Not that it qualified him to be President, but Andrew Jackson killed more people (personally) in battle and in duels than any other President in United States history.     Jackson learned what it meant to be tough and unyielding at an early age, when he was slashed across the face by a British soldier's sword after refusing to clean his boots. Because of this event, he always had a great contempt for the British. Among many of Jackson's characteristics, he was notable for the lifelong grudges he kept against people who wronged him. Jackson would get revenge against the British later on by defeating them at Battle of New Orleans during the War of 1812. He was proclaimed a national hero, and became an overnight American Icon as a result.     When he won the election in 1828, the American people were as enthralled to have him win as the African Americans were when Obama won. Prior to Jackson, every President in US history came from a wealthy or prominent family line. Jackson broke this social barrier and proved that you could come from virtually nothing and someday become President through hard work and perseverance. He was in a sense, the people's champ.    But aside from his huge popularity, Jackson was not without his enemies. Because he the Democratic Party grew so strong under Jackson, the Whig Party was formed as a way to oppose Jackson's might (compromised primarily of Jackson haters, aristocrats, and former Federalist).     Despite the fact that some of the acts he committed and things he did would be considered horribly atrocious and barbaric by today's societal standards (like the Trail of Tears), when it came to the Presidency Jackson truly did what he thought was in the best interests of the people at the time (the working class). Before the depression of 1837, Jackson was the only President in United States history to restore the national deficit. He also managed to stop the National Bank by vetoing it in 1832, because he knew that a National Bank would eventually become a corrupt institution (like it is today).     Jackson fought for the common man, and was a staunch anti-aristocrat. Jackson was never consumed by the greed or corruption that consumes our government today, he served our country the way it was supposed to be run, for the people by the people. You don't get your face put on the twenty dollar bill for doing nothing as President, that's for sure.|`|RPsgkfOLaa	FDR.|`|gDxMoBl9aa	F.D.R. did more for America Imo.

However, no one can find that quote, either.|`|9qKAy0dlaa	I think Bush said the same but he ended it with inside a box.|`|ZzXxRLWcaa	I think it was John Henry?
O1jigUYSaa	We have recessions every 10-12 years.  This one is a deep one owing to meddling from the Congress.  It will right itself eventually.|`|I6dcRgD6aa	there is no way it can right itself without this stimulus if you are so smart how did we get in this mess? Obama doesn't care if he gets credit he is doing what is best for his country.|`|AA10774878	This spending bill is downright criminal in these times. The pork packed in this bill is disgusting. People are loosing their jobs left and right because American citizens have over extended themselves for years living on bad loans so we are going to, print money or borrow more from the Middle East, to boost funding for STD research. Makes perfect sense to me!!|`|BQY8b2YOaa	It will right itself but with this obamanation of a stimulus plan it is going to take much much longer than it would have.|`|bIOf9lv7aa	Yes. it would of.. And it still will in due time.. The stimulus will not do it.. All that is going to do is give my son and grandkids an insurmountable debt that they will never pay off.. Why all the young people are for this I cannot understand. They will pay for it all their lives..
TJpQZju2aa	Its true that the normal response to recessions is interest-rate cuts from the Fed, not government spending. And that might be the best option right now, if it were available. But it isnt, because were in a situation not seen since the 1930s: the interest rates the Fed controls are already effectively at zero.    Thats why were talking about large-scale fiscal stimulus: its whats left in the policy arsenal now that the Fed has shot its bolt. Anyone who cites old arguments against fiscal stimulus without mentioning that either doesnt know much about the subject  and therefore has no business weighing in on the debate  or is being deliberately obtuse.  so I would say what he's proposing now is the best option|`|6nS62bB8aa	Cut taxes.    Corporations currently pay 35% of income in taxes.  Most corporations in America have LESS than twenty employees.    But when somebody says "corporation", well, you MUST be talking about those huge, evil, cruel, heartless global giants that make millions of dollars a day in pure profit off the backs of the working poor But that's just dead wrong, factually not true, and a damned lie. Most corporations in America employ LESS than twenty people..    Cut corporate taxes to 15% and the unemployment lines would vanish overnight. AND the government would actually take in more money. It has been proven many times, cut taxes and you raise receipts.|`|Gsq05hXCaa	the first thing I would do is eliminate the Capital Gains tax. that would immediately give the economy a rebound effect. then I would try to pass some legislation to cut back on spending for things that are not of importance. Next I would attempt to create more jobs. Maybe cut taxes on businesses who would be most likely to create them. give companies that create them tax breaks as well. Maybe we could create some green jobs as well, and give more tax breaks to companies whop invest in green technology. taht'll shut the environmentalists up. I would then make the Bush tax cuts permanent, have Barney Frank fired or whatever, and then take every single illegal immigrant i nthe country, and gice them amnesty.....IF they pay $5,000 if they are here alone, and $10,000-20,000 if they are families. We're talkin about at least $150 Billion right there. so then what do we do? we take all that money and give it as a stimulus check(if the economy is still not performing) to each American(with the exceeption of the ones who were illegal). So thats about $500 extra for everyone. Now maybe it should only go to people who make under $200,000 a year. the key is to cut spending as much as possible without compromising national security, or making the country look like crap.|`|pGYT94Zzaa	Id kill everyone|`|aVEVchFxaa	If I were Obama, I'd first pick a whole new smart intelligent well qualified batch of people. None of  the Bush leftovers. Leftovers come with the same thoughts and attitudes. Next, I'd listen to the majority voice of the public to give me some ideas which grievances are the most crutial, and I'd take it from there. I'd like to say that I would be the first President to end taxes period, however, I've got better sense than that lol. There's that old saying that says" "There are two things in life that are definite. Death and taxes." And you can't escape either.|`|QTQTdPO1aa	I would demand that companies get themselves out of debt.    By doing this I would suggest they offer their current clients APR cuts if their clients pay off their debt ASAP.  For those who can't, I would suggest they offere them a reformed debt payoff plan.      I would encourage the country to pay for things on their own and NOT put everything on credit.  I would demand that homeowners put 20% down on a home and that builders do NOT build unless a home is ordered by someone who put 20% down.      I would encourage local farming.  I would put a stop to spending money on other countries until we were out of debt ourselves.  I would request that all countries that owe us money pay us back or they would be cut off financially and we would not export goods to them either (or buy from them for that matter.)|`|eYcNsptOaa	First, provide the stimulus money only to businesses who will use it to employ people, no layoffs.  Second, raise the minimum wage so those living on it can actually live comfortably. The trickle down theory doesn't work, make sure the money gets directly into the hands of those who will spend it, the working class.  Ok, stick a liberal label on me, but if you are smart and not just following the so called conservative herd, you'll realize that workers pay more in taxes than the rich, this means the more money they have the more they give to the government in taxes.  Also, people with money may save it yes (oh the horror) but they will increase their spending, which will stimulate the economy further, thus increasing the tax base further.  The greedy rich who are afraid they won't make their billions anymore?  They will, if they are patient.  The increased spending will end up in their pockets too.  I would couple this with wise spending of the U.S. dollar, no more pork barrel spending for a while.  We'll have the money again, we just need to do what has to be done and wait a little bit.
4Vmlf902aa	China can't control us. If they stop buying T-Securities it would deeply affect them. Considering our gov't could lash back by banning all Chinese goods. Also the dollar would plunge in value, and all of this other stuff would happen. So if China stops buying treasury securities you can bet they, and the rest of the world, will go down with us. Oh and some of the money is coming from taxpayers, not all from China.|`|D2YaTaUIaa	Hate to say it, but China will be the next, if not, already is the next super power. That's what happens when your economy depends on loans from other countries, in order to pay for 20 million dollars worth of sod to feed pork to those hungry liberals.

aTAUOI8caa	1)  As far as Nancy Pelosi, I rather agree with you.  Obama seems pretty intent on going for bipartisanship, but she seems intent on partisanship.  She has been pressing for impeachment trials for the Bush Administration, and Obama is her strongest opponent here.    She has been trying to keep the Republicans out of putting much into the stimulus bill, and for making sure they don't have a chance to take any of her stuff out.  So far everything they got in is because Obama has been fighting to make sure they are heard.    I'm surprised you were able to see how little these two agree with each other at the moment.  Everyone assumes they get along great because they think they believe the same way; even when all evidence points the other way.  I know you are young based on another question you've put down; it's good to know the young are paying attention.      2)  Yeah, Harry Reid has no backbone for anything.  He talks big, and then backs down quite easily.  I agree, Obama will have no problem here.      3)  You think Bohner is bluffing?  I do get that he is not divulging everything that he thinks here, you believe it is that he can be called out and he will back down?      I could see it.  You are right that he is hiding something.  But Obama needs to be careful not to call a bluff that isn't a bluff.      4)  Yeah, Biden's first forays into public as VP have been somewhat embarassing.  The Daily Show even made fun of it.  Biden made a joke that got no laughs, and on the camera you can see Obama looking at Biden.  And Jon Stewart says, "if you've ever wanted to see what Obama's 'shut the f*ck up' face looks like, well here it is."  And Obama did look angry at Biden, like he really wanted him to shut up.    It's still early, but if Biden does much more of that, I think you're right.  He will be relegated to some unimportant role, occasionally asked for advice just to make him feel like he is contributing.    5)  I agree completely.    6)  Again, I agree completely.          You're observations are actually rather impressive, kid.|`|H7kmp0qdaa	Obama is daddy. And that's that.|`|9jDBKKw7aa	A socialist gathering.|`|mT6b7INZaa	I agree with 4 of your 6 choices.    And I wouldn't use the phrase 'easy to control'.  I think the phrase 'easy to work with' works better.    Biden - If Obama turns Biden in to the ceremonial 'funeral guy', I think Biden would get bored and maybe say something that would be considered a Gaffe'.  Biden is experienced and wise.   I think Obama will keep Biden engaged with important matters.... matters where Biden knows he needs think before he speaks.    McConnell - McConnell has 1 spare vote that can be used to orchestrate a GOP senate  fillibuster.   McConnell has the power and a partisan ideological tendency to oppose anything that isn't deemed 'conservative'.  If the Senate were 60 40 in favor of the Democrats, McConnell would be marginalized.|`|xFm5wzuXaa	Well w him and Tranny Pelosi I can't figure out which one is the man, oh I just figured it out they are both biotches.

I think a public spat is in order.'    I agree that Reid will follows Obama's orders.    John Boehner understands perfectly that his base is unhappy with him.  He want's to keep his job, and will therefore act as they would have him act.    Joe Biden is already 'fairly ineffective'.  Has been for a long time.    Mitch McConnell has a tough job and will have to pick his battles.    Feinstein will praise lord Obama.

2aJ7gHQgaa	Brown v. Board of Education (1954) was about an African American guy named Oliver Brown who brought a lawsuit against the Topeka, Kansas board of education because his daughter was forced to go to an all-black school far away from their house, when there was a segregated white school closer to their house.  The Supreme Court found that "separate educational facilities are inherently unequal," and that's when integration started.    Plessy v. Ferguson (1896) was about a guy named Plessy (who was 1/8 black), and people made him sit in the "colored" car of a Louisiana railroad.  The Supreme Court ruled that it was ok to make him sit in the "colored" car because it was "separate but equal."  The cases are related because the Brown v. Board of Education case overturned the Supreme Court's decision in the Plessy case.  Both were about racial segregation, and although the Supreme Court ruled that it was ok in 1896, the decision was overturned with the Brown case.|`|VMFftlQlaa	ehhh plessy vs ferguson had declared segregation constitutional and it was repealed in the brown vs board of ed when some black girl was allowed to attend an all white girl school|`|yZImAkozaa	i'm pretty sure brown vs. board was about integration of schools.|`|yQdA5rHnaa	it was about letting african americans attend all white shools.|`|MnbMpzaoaa	2 first) They both involve segregation.

The Kansas Supreme Court cited Plessey as the reason for dismissing the suit (stare decisis).

Ferguson, 163 U.S. 537 (1896), is a landmark United States Supreme Court decision in the jurisprudence of the United States, upholding the constitutionality of racial segregation even in public accommodations (particularly railroads), under the doctrine of "separate but equal". "Separate but equal" remained standard doctrine in U.S. law until its final repudiation in the later Supreme Court decision Brown v. Board of Education (1954).    Brown vs. Board of Education was the landmark supreme court decision declaring that state laws with established separate public schools for black and white students denied black children equal educational opportunities. This victory paved the way for integration and the civil rights movement
7mOfekBWaa	lol A Bush on a ticket? That's just not going to happen any time soon. Bush left office with a near 20 percent approval rating (this means at the dinner table, he was the only one who thought he was doing a good job).  America is feeling the weight of 2 wars, a failing economy, and a horrible global reputation because of the Bush administration.    They'd have to throw a whole bunch of people in Abu G. or Gitmo in order to get them to vote for any kind of Bush.    Then again, I hear the south/racist states do tend to cling bitterly to what they know.|`|OFA2LAM5aa	America has had two Bush's....that was enough.|`|AA10185707	Bush senior has already endorsed Jeb for President. Lets hope he runs because he wouldn't stand a chance|`|fJ9gJ1ttaa	I wouldn't vote for him.|`|70DZWz2Baa	why are all you liberals so BITTER? You won the elections. You got the White House. You got the senate. You got the house. You can do anything even if it includes ruining our country(which will happen). so why the frick are you all so bitter.|`|d3b6fdf2d631c2f5712339448db9e43caa	2 pu**ys in the white house, is 2 too many. let's not make it  3 .|`|444pPdy5aa	Hopefully Mitt Romney|`|DgmlkNsIaa	possibly|`|98421d53b33baefb6c27a02dbf2c57b8aa	I want Bobby Jindal to run.
uXVbvEX3aa	It's a freaking octopus.|`|AXNkmdbKaa	I do.  And then you have the States, counties, cities, home owners' associations and the Cub Scouts.  What about all of that?|`|SjTAVdcKaa	Everybody.|`|qDsrQIhIaa	do you want to shrink it here is how. Vote republican.|`|93r3nCM1aa	Well that depends. I don't think the area of concern is how BIG and POWERFUL the government is, but rather how they use that power. We could have the smallest government known to man and they could still be terrible.    It's more a matter of what the government does, not how big/small they are while doing it.
QlPTVcrHaa	Not anymore. We voted them out of office.|`|LzPhdri5aa	They're doing a pretty good job of that themselves.    When CEO's earn money for things they did not earn (performance based pay) or when they are not held accountable for their mistakes, people see them for the sham they are.    I am an ardent capitalist, but Capitalism without market liquidity or accountability is NOT Capitalism.
3FtC9D40aa	Gold is good.     Silver looks to be better.     The banks have been flooding the market with paper silver as a measure to make the US dollar look more appealing as a hedge currency. The paper issuers like COMEX and NWT Mint have promised out soo much silver that they have become incapable of actually meeting demand to the customers who want physical delivery. They are starting to default on their obligations. That is a good indication that demand is now outpacing supply. The icing is because silver is being suppressed in value the mining companies have actually been slowing their production down. While at the same time silver is being consumed in the form of electronics, solar panels, etc.     There is good indications that we are about to see a supply crisis if the defaults become rampant and production remains stagnant. If that happens there will be an explosion in value for anyone who has physical possession of silver.    Anyways whether this will be true or not is yet to be seen. Let the lesson of the story be that if you are going to buy bullion, make sure you take physical possession and don't go chasing after paper.|`|QR5HbJQ0aa	It is the best investment, because unlike Paper money it is actually worth something... But the thing is they have raised the Price of Gold so much so that, that it's harder to buy high amounts of it... It's like they want you to be pennyless when the economy crashes....|`|AA11284831	It sucks.  Adjusted for inflation the cost of gold is about 1/2 of what it was in 1984.  Equities on the other hand have more than tripled.    Gold is racked by short-term ups and downs and historically has been a very poor investment.  Don't be fooled by any short-term spikes!|`|XQbEyVJ1aa	Actually no, gold is at a long time low, but it typically remains very steady, so you won't make any money.|`|r4ixb4Zbaa	I'm not sure. We are not using the Gold Standard to back up the dollar anymore so it might not be as safe as you think.|`|i0vcEyJtaa	Gold has been pretty steady, but silver also has gone up. There is a chance they will go even higher if the Dollar collapses, so you can make an investment now before it's too late.|`|58EydBwwaa	Keep in mind that luxuries such as gold and silver are only valuable when there is a large segment of the population whose basic needs are being met. In the event of a war, mass famine, or complete collapse of the economy, items such as alcohol, cigarettes, and drugs will probably be more valuable for trading in the short term.|`|uGeo5zfSaa	It would've been a few years back. but the gold bull market's pretty much slammed the door on any newcomers.|`|bIOf9lv7aa	It is the best investment.. Buy all you can afford to.. Take your ira money and buy gold..
p9qiQFIGaa	Yes. They will be back killing our troops|`|d6mVkJ3Oaa	no, peace needs to start somewhere.|`|AA10919865	YES!!!! I TOTALLY THINK SO!! REcently one of the detainees got released in Iraq and already KILLED 12 PEOPLE!!!     its a threat to this great nation    also dont you think this is what William Ayers would do..b.c he is a racist terrorist|`|rRWzkffFaa	He should be impeached for the stimulus bill, but that ain't going to happen anytime soon.|`|Gr99OjQuaa	hahahaha. i see you didnt read the article    "Prisoner number 333 was released from Guantanamo on Nov. 11, 2007, according to the Pentagon. "    notice the date|`|ZKZxe1v5aa	yea!  i dont want no sheik hajablack muhammed blowin me up!|`|AA10123414	Sorry, Bush released the person in the article you posted.|`|AA12201622	Nope, Target Practice for our troops is good Killing Terrorist|`|AA11696297	closing down Guantanamo is hardly an impeachable offense.  be nice to not have the whole world hate us for being fascist.|`|AA10264185	Obama has not released any Gitmo detainees. This man was released by the Bush administration.|`|5b85793bae21d013c789850655fa694caa	Only if he stands next to Bush who released several two years ago.|`|HZy629kLaa	Do you know what impeachment is?|`|FTs2py0kaa	If they are pow's.Genevia Convention is the way to go....We are no better than the WWII Germans|`|AXNkmdbKaa	I'm  hoping he is having them sent to other prisons.|`|G1sEBPQkaa	B.O. didn't release him. He was released in 2007.|`|407f2f3df56644b5cae9f978edcbb062aa	Sure, if someone can prove that they're all guilty in a US court of law.|`|ohxiNOFjaa	He isn't just going to turn them loose on the streets.  All of the over 600 who have already been released were done by the Bush administration.  89% have not returned to the fight.  So, apparently over 500 should never have been in Gitmo.|`|IbyxsgHhaa	impeached? oh no no my friend I think the word you are looking for is "applauded".  Yes he should be applauded
8ZN38eapaa	amazing how the media makes this guy out to be some kind of    genius!!!|`|eef76b61eca737b62766034d9204c8baaa	I see what you are getting at.  He is all over the page.  It's not what he says but how he says it.  Just ask an O'Zombie.|`|uspTM9cuaa	Barry is the consumate flim flam man.|`|ohxiNOFjaa	Makes perfect sense to me.  I think your the one with the convoluted thinking.|`|ZzXxRLWcaa	They were different sections aimed at different people. You'll have to get used to an intelligent president that can be subtle and multi-task.    Thie first was aimed towards Palestinians and Iranians most especially. Saying basically, "tone down the rhetoric, stop with fist shaking and come talk so we can settle this like gentlemen".    The second was aimed at unrepentent terrorists..taliban, al qaeda, etc... saying "Your bent on destruction? Well guess what, you aint never conquering us and we got the hellfire missiles.. so bite me."    The second can also be a warning to the first group if they dont change their ways.    Basically to other countries the meaning is: "Talk with us and be civil? Then we'll talk back and be civil. But if you dont stop and keep trying to harm us? Then I hope you like bombs in your soup..."    Make sense now?|`|m2E4rLxgaa	sounds like he's saying: if you're willing to make peace we extend a hand--but if you're not, we extend a 45 caliber shot to the head.    makes perfect sense when you're not looking thru rush limbaugh's hatred of the black president doesn't it?|`|BQQLZa7Baa	the first part means that if a country is willing to work with us, then we will work with them. the second part means that if a country wants to fight us, we will defend ourselves.    those aren't opposing views.|`|F28BfJKjaa	If they want help, we'll offer. If you want to keep destroying peoples lives. We won't help. I think the statement made an obvious point. The US isn't going to help people who are killing innocents people as a way to protest.|`|LzPhdri5aa	"Speak Softly and Carry a Big Stick."    They do not conflict.|`|grKtTRYtaa	In the second case, he is  talking to those who are" inducing terror and slaughtering innocents."   He is saying that we will help those who come in peace but defeat those who are terrorists or murderers of innocents.    Please reread. I bet this speech had been vetted 100's of times by Obama team.|`|cWyQc7T7aa	It makes perfect sense.    If other countries are willing to stop fighting and being irrational, we'll help them and stand with them.    If not and they want to come after the US, they will have a fight on their hands.|`|zkovxRseaa	well it's the same as when Bush was president, he said he was a compassionate conservative, but his compassion was nonexistent to the people who died in Louisiana for Hurricane Katrina (one of countless examples of his hypocrisy)|`|AA10123414	"...for those who seek to advance their aims by inducing terror and slaughtering innocents,..."  these people are not "...but that we will extend a hand if you are willing to unclench your fist." these people. It should not be that difficult to understand.|`|6a0dd7563167279d8fff996ef06631f5aa	Sorry but it makes perfect sense.  In the first part he basically says that the US is willing to help all those that earnestly seek out help.  And in the second part he is saying that do not mistake our generosity for weakness.  If pushed we will defend ourselves and our way of life.  Not to tough|`|bIOf9lv7aa	Rev. Wright:  "Barrack is a politician. He says what he has to to get elected"..    Does that answer your question?
t82AcQT1aa	The end is near, our constitution is being ripped to shreds.|`|AA11193401	yes it is|`|9bb789fb1a182ebae292a0ef4f9b205eaa	this is a joke. I hate obama. Just wait till they reinstate  the fairness act.|`|AA10168935	Oh good grief. It's simply peaceful protest.|`|AA10287176	No. Citizens are free to start petitions about whatever they want. That is protected under the freedom of speech which you claim to want to protect. Likewise, the President is free to tell people what he thinks they should or should not do. That is him exercising his freedom of speech.     It would stop being freedom of speech if he passed a law to take Rush off the air. Nobody is disputing Rush's right to express his feelings. But you seem to be disputing the right of democrats to express their feelings.     You need to learn that freedom of speech entitles Democrats to say people shouldn't listen to Rush just as much as it entitles Rush to expressing his moronic views.|`|vKR4tysjaa	This is so true.  You will be allowed to say NOTHING, unless THEY (dems in charge) like what you're saying.  Funny, if it weren't so sad.    It is if America is becoming what Russia used to be.  Funnier: Does ANYONE remember the pictures of Russia before Glasnost?  There were posters of Stalin (head shot) looking up and to the left, on every street corner, and every building.  I just read where the copycat artist of the obama poster (head shot looking up and to his right) will be invited to the smithsonian to have his knock-off propaganda poster enshrined forever as great art!  He freaking knocked off a communist propaganda poster from Russia, and they're acting as if he's the greatest artist since Picaso.    Libbies crack me up...|`|gwqS6xHpaa	When Obama plans to bomb Rush, like Bush did Al-Jazeera, then I will agree with you...    Otherwise, YAWN, relax!|`|99sHdbRFaa	Here we go with Obamism starting. Just like McCarthyism, I see a huge conflict of prejudice coming. Where is Edward R. Murrow when we need him? Could Rush act as Murrow did??  I think he can.|`|70DZWz2Baa	I agree but I hope that the Democrats don't want to have us completely dependent upon them . And don't forget about Sean Hannity, Glen Beck, mark Levin and so many others.|`|yS0hSFdOaa	No, but I wish it was so ya'll would put a sock in it already.
ZzXxRLWcaa	I'm afraid i dont know if we ever can... with the sorry state of the economy, housing and jobs right now budget defecits are going to be inevitable in the short run.    After 3-5 years we can maybe begin looking at ways to reduce the debt, so then...     - First things first we have to simply balance the budget. This is not impossible, both Jimmy Carter and Bill Clinton balanced theirs. Smart people can accomplish this just by reading and making good decisions.    - Drawdown in military spending... via withdrawl from Iraq and cutting the plethora of bad contracts that were signed with private industry.    - Taxes on the top 5% have to return to their higher levels to increase revenue.    - Taxes on everyone else should be stabilized, but not lowered.    - Hopefully new and green technologies will allow for a new manufacturing base, increasing revenue and reducing our trade debt. Anyway you slice it, we need to make some stuff here again... a "consumer driven economy" is flawed from the start.    - Be responsible. The President should take advantage of his line item veto and cut out wasteful pork if congress is unwilling to police themselves.    - And one last suggestion, which I suppose is little more then a pipe dream: Legalize marijuana, put a fat excise tax on it (like with cigarettes) and reap more profit then we've known in 200 years. Not only would you have the huge boom in tax revenue, but also the reduced cost in law enforcement. Again, pigs may fly before we see that commensensical approach.    Thanks for being serious man. Its nice to discuss things in an adult manner around here.|`|zoPyYyXHaa	Your Idea is not a bad one. But the first thing that needs to be done is to quit making money and spending it when we don't have it.|`|HzcZwtVqaa	Stop wasteful government spending.|`|nNxUfkesaa	well banks keep on increasing interest rates for example you get a loan for lets say 150,000 dollars to buy the house, that loan that you just got its gonna get bigger for you to pay back because interest keep on ghetting higher thats why people lost their homes because they couldnt keep up with the payments.     i will say make interest on housing market illegal  if you grab a loan from the bank make sure its by contract where the paymetns never increase but you still pay for the loan    also make an agency to regulate wall street  and banks to make sure they dont get greedy   in the last stimulus plan they all got big bonuses while everyone else lost their jobs.    make sure that every company has like and insurance type of thing they make alot of money and therefor they should save up money just incase something goes wrong like the reccession today.  they save up money and if something like that happens they dont need to ask for govermnet help because they go insureance or money saved up.    increase taxes not alot but to a compromisable way where the middle class could afford to pay.       also have schools and federald facilities use things the dont waste money. for example instead of electricity they need to place those things that get energy from the sun. this will be great on the long run.  because it saves money and stuff.    make it easier for people to get loans this will the economy trust people will get loans houses will be bought and on.    about the war on afghanistan and iraq i will say for excisting souldiers there to train the iraqui and afghnistan souldiers and police there so they can handdle their own bussiness and all.|`|I6dcRgD6aa	Most 10 year old children could give better answers than most people who answer here...OK, put people to work. Rebuild our foundation. This time build up where we never did before. Make this a country where everyone can use their gifts & talents & be conpensated for it. If we all who were capable of working, worked we would all have money & the spending would help everyone else stay in business. Never let an idiot like a Bush in office again.|`|ox7mJ2Psaa	1) lower sales tax  2) lower gas tax  3) do away with estate tax  4) increase IRA contributions to $10,000 a year  5) send congress members home for 3 months  6) shut down the department of education (it does nothing)  7) shut down the department of energy ( it does nothing)  8) cut congress members pay by half ( they have voted themselves a pay raise every year for decades)  9) make a washington a lobbyist free zone ( back room deals cost tax payers money)  10) shorter term limits on members of congress. ( will someone show kennedy the way home? he like a lot of the members of congress are just a sad examples of what gets elected in this country)  11) page limit on legislation or bills being voted on ( no 10,000 page bills no human would ever read or have time comprehend)   12) limit election campaigns to 2 months. any money raised and not used goes to paying off the national debt.  13) members of congress shall not take family members or friends on trips of any kind outside us boarders. ( members of congress routinely abuse this privilege at tax payers expense )  14) sell off unneeded public buildings and offices in washington dc. you remember the closing of unneeded military bases? well i am sure there are buildings and offices congress uses that they could do without. right?  15) bring in a team of independent auditors and look at what we are paying for and ask questions. do we really need to spend 8 billion on this and 25 million an that?.... it would take years to unload the pork in the washington bugit but it would be well worth the effort, pain and political attacks it would generate.    16) give the president the line item veto  17) sign into law the fair tax or flat tax so everyone pays the same amount. (15%, 16%,...)   18) charge mexico a fee for every illegal mexican citizen we catch in the us and return to mexico and delay that persons application a year everytime they enter the us illegally.   19) remove the ability for people in prison to make phone calls or communicate with the outside. gang members on the inside run gangs on the outside from prison by making phone calls. i vote (total isolation) they don't see anyone not even other inmates untill there time is served or done.    20) get drugs and psychatry out of public schools. most of americas kids are diagnosed with ADD or something and required to be on a drug. it's a gross scam that costs america millions each month.
oLXsNgRvaa	You should set him up with another piece of jewlery (get some pics and some kinda certificate of authenticity), and see if it happens again. (Maybe) The police will listen to your accusation this time.|`|cCjmNgTnaa	I would find the original place that you bought the necklace.

In my 35 years experience. .Llumar 30 ATR/Solar Gard tend to run darker.    25% is very close to legal so your risk is very slight.    Remember if a cop tests the film he's metering through the glass and that adds a 8% factor generally speaking.|`|AA11458153	dude no worries.

Shame on everyone involved!|`|636202a5daab42fdc568f4ed6abb39e3aa	Yes. Everyone in the media had a conference call this morning at 11. The main topic of discussion was, how can we redirect America's attention away from Obama's efforts to get Muslim Terrorists to like him. There was also some discussion about how the media, including print, TV and radio, and the internet, could ensure that America doesn't find out that Barack used taxpayer dollars to buy Samsung  42 inch LCD tvs for everyone remotely connected to Planned Parenthood and ACORN. (as well as the Socialist Party-USA and all gay and lesbian people, btw) There was much discussion, but the conferfence call concluded with a game plan to focus on the marching band guy who got in trouble for waving. And, I might add, it appears to  have worked!|`|5cc93dc15af56e8f47884e200463a48eaa	lol @ your rant...so misinformed you only look at the data that you want to see and dismiss the rest.

What gays want is full acceptance, whether it's voluntary or rammed down everyone's throat matters not.    Here's a thought.  Prop 8 was the 2nd time a law defining marriage was passed.  The first time 4 judges overran 3,000,000 votes in favor of the previous law.  That's a scary thought.  We have a means of direct democracy in California, and need to retain that right.    For me, Prop 8 was more about my voice counting over that of 4 judges.  Prop 8 passed because of that, and that the majority of California voters want traditional|`|65OG0ZHaaa	It's not.

It is unfair because if a right is defined as inalienable, it can't be taken away with a simple majority vote. The very definition of inalienable is that you can't take it away from somebody. If we say that we're all equal then we're all equal. Otherwise you're saying that only the majority is equal.     Wrong... what's right or wrong is a personal decision. Some people would claim that intolerance and unfairness are wrong. That the right thing to do would be to strive for equality and learn to live with each other in spite of our differences. But these people are the minority apparently.|`|d1a2d96d28c063a31c38d6ccbb050904aa	Because it is taking the equality of straight and gay couples.

Okay maybe if you read the Bible, you would know what you're talking about.    1.

I believe the weak brainwashed people include yourself, because you open your mind to everything BUT the fact that God exists.     3. The left's position is that global warming is the human race's fault and we should throw out every technology that emits some sort of gas.   When in fact the earth is going through a cycle. Temperature's change, they rise and fall, climate shifts, etc.     4. The left likes to come out with these odd nutball cases like "oh, there's a new insect in the Rockies that is eating all the trees" or "oh no, the polar ice caps are melting, so we MUST save the polar bears" or "oh no! The world's temperature has gone up one degree Fahrenheit!! What ever shall we do???" or "here's some weird numbers that we pulled out of our posterior in order to fool everyone that we need to spend tons of more money on nonsense!"

Global Warming would be a much easier thing to believe if I was not freakin' cold in Houston.  If it was not snowing in Mobile, Alabama and the panhandle of Florida.

Where are all the American companies moving too? India.      By far, The six billion people of this earth are not dependent on 1/24 of the population in a country which is right now in a recession, which is having companies relocate to other countries, and depends on having other countries make a large part of necessary material which we only import because it's cheaper than local companies.

The planet is pointed north pole towards the sun, South Pole away, thus the polar bears get a tan, and the penguins freeze.

Al Gore is a politician, not a scientist, hes a capitalist profiteer, and hes getting rich making people believe the sky is falling. For instance I read an article a few months ago that as a result of global warming we are finding more dead polar bears than ever before. Sad day, single tear.

Well, I've studied the science and I've got an "inconvenient truth" for Gore and company - the only hot air that's threatening the planet is coming out of their mouths.    Global warming has benefited from one of the greatest public relations and marketing efforts in recent history. You'll hear plenty from environmentalists about carbon emissions, clean energy, and the disappearing arctic, but here's what you will NEVER hear them admit:    Scientists have reaped MILLIONS from their global warming "research."

Al's Book was a third grade coloring book written at a level of the barely literate level.  Lots of pictures and cut and past "news" articles.  NO science.  Read "Earth in the Balance" Al Gore and you will get a real insight into where he got the idea.  You will see why he dumbed it down (way down).  The news has not mention that there is more ice in Antarctica then ever.   Hollywood is not worth mentioning.  But The Nobel Prize well, first you don't think they are as political as any other organization?  Second, This is the same org. that gave the Nobel peace prize to two of the biggest terrorist in history - Arafat and M. Bagain!  So i have no respect for them.

In case you have not been paying attention, even the Red Cross is corrupt. They take the "aid" from either the International Office of the Red Cross or others. Then the Red Cross honchos get first crack at the stuff coming in. One need only remember the examples in Mexico City after the 1994 earthquake there, and also in Peru after the earthquake ( 2 years ago?) to know that. In Africa, much of the aid is intercepted or just downright taken by various rebel and insurgent groups, and presto, they stay in business for several more months.|`|NTR6LnZSaa	how about its not their money . why do you want to punish me and starve my kids to "help" some one you feel sorry for? forced charity is theft.|`|7HdgMaOnaa	I would rather keep my tax money that's used to buy the supplies.

3caq6SFxaa	I would think they would require able people collecting unemployment to do that but I also seriously doubt that will happen.  They will probably steer it to the unions and let them use twice the people needed to take four times as long and then pay them extra because it went over bidget.  Won;t be UAW workers since the UAW got the Big Three to supplement their unemployment to be 72% of the regular pay; thought the job bank was not to be done but they just had the money sent to the state and closed the unemployment bank but they did sacrifice from 95% to 72%.|`|pwFl3C9Taa	IF and that's a really BIG IF, any jobs, (and I doubt there will be any of any substance) will certainly not get anyone off the welfare rolls.

GiJ7thLqaa	The government takes the position that driving is a privilege, but I take the position that driving is a right.  We are the sovereign body, not the government, so therefore not one individual should be subject to government "law."      It makes me sick to see all of you who say driving is a privilege.  This is why America is so fucked up and doomed to fail, continuously; People are too afraid to band together and tell government "No!"|`|AA11327840	It is not a right.  You do not have a guarantee by the government or God or anyone that you will be given the freedom to drive.  Ok - now as far as the test.  You can take the test in someone else's car as long as they have insurance on the car.  But, even if you do save enough for a car, you will have to pay for insurance on the car.  I understand that your folks aren't going to help you but would they let you take the test in their car?  What did you do to piss them off so much?  Your dad taught you to drive so what'd ya do?|`|1Oahrpiiaa	both and neither=)|`|NNfZLgFnaa	Driving is a privilege NOT a right.  My wife cant drive so I understand your belief that is should be a right.  But laws are in place for a reason.  My wife for example has seizures, would you want that type of driver on the road? Its dangerous to both her and the general public. Just my two cents...|`|g7uMKvEzaa	It's both.

Well, I'd consider healthcare an even MORE fundamental right....  Just wait until you are no longer covered by school insurance.|`|FjwdmI0oaa	It does seem like a big circle with no good answer. You sound like sound like a young person that has his head on Straight. So don't screw it all up. Driving is a privilege. Those who ern the right have done all the right things to get it. First and foremost INSURANCE is a must. I have personally been in two wrecks and the other person's had no insurance. This has cost me dearly. Even tho i have insurance and my company payed most all of my hospital bills my premiums went up. If i had been in my other car that only has liability insurance i would have been SOL. And out THOUSANDS of dollars and i would have been suing someone and trying to put them in jail till they payed back my losses. If i sound bitter maybe i am, There so many people that are in this country illegality that have nothing to loose they don't care if they hit your car your house your kid! They just move some were else and start again.You can not be one of these people. You are trying make something of your self.

Driving falls into this category.|`|s3E3KfBsaa	I think everyone should be required to have insurance to drive a car. There should be stiff penaltys and fines if caught without it.|`|DpVOCvihaa	Driving in my opinion is a privilege. There are some on the road that definitely shouldn't be.  However your situation is quite unfortunate because it does suck to have to have a car with insurance to take the test when you can't get a car without a liscense. But not having a car could save you money!|`|fd7fe1f691df6908d8e583dbd5b9a6b7aa	save up for the lessons.  Borrow a car from an insured person for the test.  Their insurance should cover you borrowing the car but make sure of course.  This is done every day. What about driving Dad's car? Driving is a priviledge,  we don't want just everybody to drive.  We have enough bad drivers already.|`|JqfIJtvYaa	It is a privilege, I think, and the laws are in place to protect us. I honestly think that people should retake driving tests every ten years or so, because it sure seems like there are alot of careless drivers out there.
PG2gd1tOaa	Since our government is the largest consumer of our money it only makes sense its way past time for our government to go on a diet. The only thing this stimulus will do is stimulate a deeper recession, cut taxes and let people decide on their own what to do with their own money. This stimulus should be laid wide open for every tax paying citizen to look at and then it should be voted on by us, the tax payers.|`|OAyXEtIoaa	short answer....limit/cut ADDITIONAL spending, inject lines of currency into strategic areas of the economy to promote new jobs, protect small business by providing tax cuts and incentives to small business, prevent additional job loss, become more energy efficient, streamline regulations that oversee some of the most corrupt industry's in our nation today.|`|LiC73eggaa	the free market has failed.  we need someone in a new position like an "Economic Czar" who will oversee the whole economy of the USSA.|`|LZw4JntHaa	1.

Cut corporate tax rates (our are now the second highest in the world, driving many productive businesses overseas.)    4. Retire Barney Frank and Chris Dodd from congress.|`|Ikd9cppcaa	Eliminate income tax on our paychecks for the next 6 months.

9jDBKKw7aa	Our current two party system derives it's roots from England. In a nutshell, and at it's most basic level, there were two schools of thought. One was for conservative applications of government the other was for liberal applications of government. We still use those terms today although there definitions have become somewhat 'muddled' through revisionist historians and inaccurate dictionary definitions (the definitions in wikipedia are laughable) . Conservatives wanted less government with more choices (freedom) remaining with the individual. Liberals wanted more government to provide a more equitable division among the people with somewhat less choice (freedom) with the individual. So here we are today, the same basic root issues still at play. The reason we have parties is to have enough influence to help people with similar philosophies form government policy. As you can see people in the same parties rarely agree on all issues. However, most all agree that they do not want the government to own all means of production or have complete control over division of our labors (communism). A one party system would only be provided under communism. America needs the two party system so some choice and re-evaluation can be performed (every four years). We may not all agree but we can agree to disagree. One caveat, some radical elements in our society want to move to a one party system and stifle all debate and move us to a completely government controlled society. Did you know their was an active move toward communism during the great depression? The rational among us won't give up our freedom for any reason no matter what the cost. Many Americans have died to protect our freedom so let's keep the rights given to us by our forefathers. George Washington was one. He was trying to unify a new country against a foreign power, so his statement, if read out of the situational context, might convey a slightly different meaning than he intended. Hope this is helpful, thanks for letting me rant, keep asking questions.|`|tDZMJue9aa	umm history shows they did listen to him after all he is the first president .and are you sure he said that cause i dont believe you were there|`|XoYaFgkyaa	Because he was white.  I agree by the way.  And they all sit back and watch the show and enjoy it like a mob.  And they think they are being savvy.|`|7c5d1a76836b7ed2ed52eb7c751f6331aa	People are too caught up in the two party system to let go. It's nothing more than a "symbolic" fight, they are angry about other things, so it's easy to make it about that.|`|vTNWiFPwaa	it's not that we didn't listen to george.  it just happens.  sure he warned us, but its just a warning.  people will always disagree.|`|bkav003oaa	He was a rare breed, a selfless man.     Those kind of people are almost never found in politics anymore, and those that are selfless are quickly co - opted or ignored.|`|3f7UV5zDaa	Are you saying we should not have opposing views?|`|DmI09kcFaa	because no one cared|`|6a44deb0b64aa4a94dcb485934e01693aa	Ha, and a single party would be better?  Who would watch them if not their rival party?  They'd be able to get away with anything they wanted becuase they would control the courts, the presidency, the laws, the media, everything.  At least now if a party screws up we can punish them by electing their rivals.|`|5lflypTiaa	Obviously Washington realized the evil of a two party system and thereby recognized the evil nature of the people that would gravitate toward politics. He knew it was coming because he understood history. The people that would actually listen and support his views are the very same people who wouldn't get involved in politics in the first place.|`|nWgTur4qaa	It's called, "keeping the priest and pope busy!"     We must give those people a hard time.|`|AA11148986	The founding fathers couldn't agree with each other on everything.|`|9cpKYneZaa	Washington was right. But the natural consequences of politics are that you will have a polarization. That's why its called "pol i tics"    They are referring to each pole of the spectrum. And when you go to vote, you go to the polls.     A single party system is dangerous. But in the nations that have 1 party, typically they have factions within that divide the party, hence the electorate.    In multi-party systems, they have coalition governments. No one party can dominate so they put together a multi-party platform and therefore coalesce.    Anyway, nice avatar. Is that you? Cool. Party on girl.|`|zQiYKgMLaa	what do you mean??  The founding fathers were divided politically past the idea of an independent sovergn nation.  That's why they created things like the Constitution and the Declaration of Independence the way that they did.  That's why they set up the country as independent states with independent governments.  They knew people didn't agree and would never agree.  The Federalists and the Democratic Republicans had ideals that were more different than the Republicans and the Democrats are today.      The rift between the Liberals and the Conservatives is about as large as I've ever heard of it since the founding of our country. Did you know that during the Revolution, only 25% of the population was for it, 50% was ambivalent one way or another, and 25% actually wanted to stay with England.  I don't think it's that people didn't necissarly listen to George Washington, I think it's that he was commenting on the political outlook of the present and knew what the future had in store.  Still, how do you ask people to be non-partisan?  Perhaps the answer is to bring other parties more mainstream and get away from the 2 party system.  That would be better, but you certainly aren't going to get everyone to agree on everything, so you will always have political parties as long as there is politics.|`|08ecd8b76e95de5e722d935f06309747aa	Because you're always going to have disagreements either way it goes.

LYPWNxx5aa	Yes.  The first thing you should have done is have the second shop put down all repairs done to your vehicle in writing and why, then compare it to the repairs done at the first shop. Then you should have immediately taken BOTH copies to the first shop. 9 times out of 10, if you can prove your case to the service manager he would have either dropped the charges all together or subtracted the reoccurring charges. The lien is set up to protect the automotive institution. You would not believe the amount of people who refuse to pay an automotive technician for services rendered. Since you chose to simply ignore him he may have felt that he had no choice but to assume that you were another dead beat trying to stiff him. At this point he can and will charge you for every day your vehicle is in storage. Now that the process has been started, even if you get legal aid, you'll be out that money anyway.|`|ZoAEoHl9aa	thats what a machanic lean is for to help shops get there money   now not only will you owe them the money back now they can charge you storage too it sucks that you stopped the payment cause now that falls back on you not them|`|dFMSACxhaa	No, they have no rights. They are in BIG trouble! But, once services are rendered, you cannot stop payment on a check.  That is a crime. You have a lot on your plate now. Will be interesting how this one works out.  good Luck!

Commercial speech is afforded far less protection..|`|6cf45f1e4b4887d9df5323037a43c464aa	No. The intent of the first amendment was to protect political speech, and freedom of assembly, but that has been extended by the courts to cover all forms of speech.|`|AA10253095	The purpose of free speech was not so we could use obscene words or print lies about a person, rather it is about being able to print the truth.    For instance when Peter Zenger had an article printed about the cruelty of the Royal Governor of New York, the Royal Governor had him tossed in Jail for Libel but the article turned out to be the truth so the Jury let Peter Zenger go and that was a ground in our right to Free Speech and Free Press.    It's like yeah I don't like President Obama but if someone is gonna print an article bashing him, it better be truth.    Sure I liked Bush in spite of some disagreements with him, I certainly did not like some of the articles that did bash him (of course I did feel that if one was gonna bash Bush, at least have some back up for why you are doing it).    For instance when I was at Ozzfest 2007, I did not like it when Daath was bashing Bush although when Chthonic said F the Politicians, well they did not name any Politicians but they actually had back up (ok using F word was not necessary but Chthonic is from Taiwan, and most countries including ours do not recognize Taiwan as a nation but I sure do, but yeah Chthonic actually had more back up than Daath did).    Kinda reminds me of that Thailand has a law that says the King can do no wrong but the current King actually disagrees with the law and says the King can do wrong.    The King of Thailand also said people should think before they say something but if one wishes to criticize him, he wants to be informed of the opinion and that if one goes to Prison for criticizing him, he will pardon them.    He did also praise those who apologized for criticisms for having the courage to apologize as well.

c34895fb3078ed6b839d8ec9443a9ab2aa	Cool, it's great you are already looking ahead to your future.  Callsigns work like this:  <br>  A- Your name is either very similar to a famous person/thing/event or can be made into one via a pun; knew a pilot whose callsign was "Rod" why?  Because his last name was Serling (Rod Serling used to do a show called "Twilight Zone").  <br>  B- You look like someone famous, I know a WSO whose callsign was "Beaker" because this guy no-kiddin' looked by Beaker on the Muppet Show.  <br>  C- You did something pretty damn stupid-I fell into this category.<br>  You don't pick it, your bro's do.  You may also have more than one-I also fell into this category.<br>  Based on that, your nickname your friends have for you oughta work for now.<br>  There's also the callsign you're assigned daily.  For example, as an F4G guy, our typical callsign was "Magnum".  If I was in the lead, that aircraft would be "Magnum Zero One"; and there would be a "Magnum Zero Two" etc.<br>  Some stuff to think about:<br>  1- Work hard in school.  Need good study habits/GPA to get into the Academy or get an ROTC college scholarship.<br>  2- The Sports is also excellent.  Participate in school activities-shows leadership and initiative.<br>  3- Stay out of trouble.  Don't let felons and drug users fly multi-million dollar aircraft<br>  4- Read up on aviation, military history, and USAF/USN history.  Also pay attention in Social Studies, knowing current events is important.  Read up on what the USAF (and USN if you want) is doing right now.<br>  Not too early to find some groundschool materials either in your library or on the web.  When you get older, and obviously with Mom and Dad's permission you can start flying lessons.  REALLY important to make you stand out when it's time to apply for pilot training.<br>  Don't listen to folks who tell you to quit video games-they develop situational awareness and eye-hand coordination.  Just don't let them rule your life so you quit studying and playing sports.<br>  Stay positive, as a lot of people (even adults) will tell you you can't do, too hard etc.  Young pilots go to fighters every day, it's not easy but it CAN be done.<br>  If you have questions, please PM me|`|9dd7255bfe9e90bbd64019154baae7a6aa	You don't get to pick what you are called, your Squad does.|`|17faiicMaa	hell man, you cant choose your call sign, your squadron does. and video games dont do you jack so stop playing em and start working out.

KXXTAi5Daa	MA's have many duties beyond just patrolling.  MA's can take an IA (individual augmentee) billet, meaning they deploy to Iraq, Afghanistan and the Horn of Africa.  MA's on IA's are stationed all over and do occasionally see combat.  IA's are a first come first serve basis, though if no one in a command volunteers, then people are chosen by the command.    MA's also man the Riverines, which currently patrol the waterways in Iraq.  This is a unit that was reestablished for the first time since the Vietnam war.  They also encounter combat and are trained accordingly.    Any more questions, let me know.
AVAwtoVTaa	The Watergate scandals were a series of American political scandals during the presidency of Richard Nixon that resulted in the indictment of several of Nixon's closest advisors, and ultimately his resignation on August 9, 1974. The scandals began with the arrest of five men for breaking and entering into the Democratic National Committee headquarters at the Watergate Office complex in Washington, D.C. on June 17, 1972. Investigations conducted by the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) and later by the Senate Watergate Committee, House Judiciary Committee and the press revealed that this burglary was one of many illegal activities authorized and carried out by Nixon's staff. They also revealed the immense scope of crimes and abuses, which included campaign fraud, political espionage and sabotage, illegal break-ins, improper tax audits, illegal wiretapping on a massive scale, and a secret slush fund laundered in Mexico to pay those who conducted these operations.[1] This secret fund was also used as hush money to buy the silence of the seven men who were indicted for the June 17 break-in.[2][3]    Nixon and his staff conspired to cover up the break-in as early as six days after it occurred.[4] After two years of mounting evidence against the President and his staff, which included former staff members testifying against them in a Senate investigation, it was revealed that Nixon had a tape recording system in his offices and that he had recorded many conversations.[5][6] Recordings from these tapes revealed that he had obstructed justice and attempted to cover up the break-in.[4][7] This recorded conversation later became known as the Smoking Gun. After a series of court battles, the United States Supreme Court unanimously ruled in United States v. Nixon that the President had to hand over the tapes; he ultimately complied.    With certainty of an impeachment in the House of Representatives and of a conviction in the Senate, Nixon resigned ten days later, becoming the only US President to have resigned from office.[8][9] His successor, Gerald Ford, would issue a controversial pardon for any federal crimes Nixon may have committed while in office.|`|564611842b49f5e66f48b5de01e3b249aa	The President was keeping a close eye on the enemy's of America|`|i5F2jwvhaa	republicans broke into the DNC offices and Nixon covered it up

lZsbIEo8aa	You might not need a CDL for that truck. You need to look on the driver door jamb or on the door itself for the manufacturer sticker. It will have the VIN, and a bunch of weights and such. If the first one (GVWR) is 26001 or more, then you need the CDL. Doesn't matter if it has air brakes or not. If it is under, then you can drive it with a regular license - unless you are hauling haz-mat.    If you need a CDL, and are caught without one, you face stiff fines, and your license will get suspended. The company that lets you drive the vehicle also faces the same fines. The truck will not be allowed to continue without a licensed driver, and will probably get impounded by the police officer that stops you. Again, the company that lets you drive doesn't want to risk losing their truck and load, so if you are working for a reputable company, I am sure you are legal. If you are working for a shady company, I would tip off a local officer, and let them "stop" you. This type of company should not be in business.|`|ea207ed5b6ef75b8f1362932a6abf174aa	You could lose your license, plus have to pay a hefty fine.  Your employer would probably have to pay several thousand dollars in fines, and possibly lose their operating authority for employing someone without qualifications.|`|XGgPhaDbaa	I don't want to be on the road with you if you aren't qualified to drive: ergo no license. The company can get huge fines for hiring unlicensed drivers and should not hire you until you are qualified. As far as what happens to you?

n2oEhdZiaa	1. Your husband will report to drill wherever the unit is.  If he joins the Virginia Guard, he will be in Virginia somewhere.  He could join the closest unit at the nearest armory to your house, or he could enlist in a firefighting unit three hours away and have to commute.  That's up to him.<br>  2. Yes.  Expect to deploy once or twice for one year each in a six year contract.  With the reductions in Iraq, more than likely that will be more like one deployment.  Could be peacekeeping in Europe or Iraq and Afghanistan.  I relieved some VA ARNG guys on my last Iraq deployment.<br>  3. payscales are available at www.military.com<br>  4. Yes, but it depends on the priority of the unit he joins and if he joins a critical skill.  Firefighter is almost never a critical skill because there are so few slots and so many people want them.  if you want a bonus, you'll likely have to choose something else.<br>  5. There is life insurance available for both soldier and spouse (400k for soldier, i think 100k for spouse), there is some dental insurance that is good for preventative care but sucks for treatment (like 50% copay) and there is decent health insurance (around $160 a month for the family, 20% copay)<br>  6. He will choose his MOS and unit based on his ASVAB scores.  The recruiter will contact the unit and verify that they have a vacancy before he even goes to MEPS.  The people at MEPS will put it in his contract, schedule his training and go over his contract at least twice to verify he sees it there before he signs.<br>  <br>  Hope this helps.  Good luck|`|OGiSHHZaaa	1. He will stay in Virginia and be put in the closest unit to your address.<br>  2. yes they do.<br>  3. Depends on rank.<br>  4. Yes <br>  5.

He'll be guaranteed his job to be a firefighter in the Guard.|`|BpCVnBJoaa	1. Will my husband be stationed in Virginia since he signed up in Virginia or could we be stationed hundreds of miles away from Virginia.<br>  <br>  Basic Combat Training (Boot Camp) and AIT (Job training) will be at base(s) outside of VA. He can be deployed out of state and overseas. Drills will be in VA with local unit.<br>  <br>  2. Do national guard soliders typically get called up to go over seas?<br>  Yes. Army Reserve and National Guard units are called up on a regualr basis. Goal 1 deployment every 6 years.<br>  <br>  3. What is the payscale for someone beginning in the guard?<br>  See DFAS or Army NG website. About $100-200 for PVT one weekend drill.<br>  <br>  4. Is there a sign on bonus for somebody new in the guard?<br>  Yes, bonuses are available depending on qualification and needs of the NG.<br>  <br>  5. What is the insurance like? Low cost life insurance is available. Medical is available for those on active duty for greater than 30 days.

AA11156037	Get your driver's license before going into the service....   You will need it for commercial rated and Private Owned Vehicles.   Below is from the NAVY vehicle operator's manual, the other services follow along in accordance with CFR regulations.     NAVY DRIVER'S HANDBOOK  CHAPTER 2.

I joined the Navy back in 1995 after high school and did not think about getting my license before I left home for bootcamp. In bootcamp, they will not show you or teach you how to drive.  Basis training consists of learning military life, the wording or jargon, history and customs ONLY. When I got to my first duty station in San Diego, I could not be put down as a duty driver on the schedule because of not having a driver;s licence.  I do not know what your particular "job" will be when you go in.  If your rate or MOS require you to have a driver's license, then they might help you get it but it really depends on where you are going and what your job consists of.  I would highly recommend that you get your permienent drivers license BEFORE you go to bootcamp, OTC or wherever it is that you are going.  It will be a lot less difficult for you in the long run.|`|x9ZbeJutaa	Yes, you will get a military license so you can operate military vehicles on military installations.  And what better to practice on than military equipment, huh?|`|sdNArv1Raa	If you are joining to drive trucks or something you have to have a license. if your MOS does not  require you to learn to operate any equipment you do not have to have one, you will only need it in AIT. Even if you have the Military License you have to have a state drivers license. I have had to have solder go down to the MODOT office to get one for AIT. once you leave AIT, if you were not required to have it for AIT, you can not operate any military vehicle out of a training area with out both.
OXGWs0fMaa	You can expect a bit of a roller coaster.  It's either a hell of a ride, or too much and you need to get off.      Except for the separations due to training and deployments (or in your case sea duty) it's not much different than a civilian marriage.    The times apart are not impossible, plenty of us go through them.  If you approach them as a chance to handle your marriage in a new way, you'll be fine.  You aren't together, but it forces you to communicate on a new level, which can be very good for a marriage.    You will move a lot, so you do rely on each other quite a bit.  As you get to a new place, you only have each other until you settle in and meet new people, etc.  This also can be good for a marriage.    You are both very young.  This isn't necessarily a bad thing, but it does pose challenges for you.  Unlike high school, once you are married, the on/off again thing kinda has to stop.  Make sure you are both ready for this before you jump in.    Many military marriages fail.  Most think it's the time apart, but in many cases it's the rushing in before the next set of orders arrive that really does them in.  A lot of military marriages would never happen if the soldier/sailor wasn't leaving soon and creating this feeling of running out of time.    The military is her career as well as yours.  Having to move every few years can make it difficult for her with work or school.  She will be making and then leaving friends regularly.  If she isn't flexible and ready for the ride, she'll have trouble adjusting.    I love the life we have in the service.  I may not be near the friends that I have made, but I am thrilled with the chances to travel and meet new people that I have had.  Any marriage takes some work.  You two will be fine if you are ready to put the effort in.|`|zCIko3syaa	Why dont you hold off on getting married for a little while and work on just living together...I've seen this scenario too many times and it might work out .05% of the time.  I know you both think you're probably different and "it will work", but I would do the responsible thing and hold off.  Military life is very stressful and you're both still young.  Hopefully you listen, if not I hope everything works out.|`|lBjMzK0baa	Its hard to answer your question because marriage takes commitment and dedication. You could be stationed in a place where you will have a lot of down time or be going home early. Or you could be in a situation where you might have to work additional hours. Regardless you both need to work on your communication and learn to be the sparkle in each others eyes. You are both young and temptations often arise. Trust in each other and be there for each other and regardless of the situation you both will learn to overcome it together.  Become each others best friend and you will be ok.|`|plPjlwcjaa	Bottom Line...  The Divorce rate for First Time Enlistees  for all Services is running about 60+%...|`|nZEaXRJEaa	I can tell you. it will be stressful. My husband is in the army reserves, currently going active duty. He is 19, turning 20 jan 2010 and I am 18 turning 19 july 2009. We got married five days before I turned 18, and three days before he left for AIT. We have a 4 week old son, and with him going active.. it means that he will have to leave his son to go through AIT again (he is changing his MOS) Also, there is the fact of deployment, which means an even longer time away from his family. I will practically be raising our son on my own because of the military, but I knew what I was marrying into. If she has an idea of the possibilities of what could happen, then she might have a better chance to ready herself (if indeed she is ready for the commitment of marriage) If you need any advice or whatnot, feel free to Email me or IM me at Leo0064(AIM)

Then you are looking at harsher penalties.|`|AA10775177	more than likely a fine, community service, or probation depends on the judge.|`|MnbMpzaoaa	Not cited or arrested means they are misdemeanor counts.  Depending on your previous records, best case is 400 hours of community service, 1 year suspended sentence each and diversion.  Diversion is you go 1 year with NO anything- traffic tickets, anything, and go back to the judge with certification of community service, and the whole thing drops off your record.    Worst case;  1 year, 3 mos in county rest suspended and you pay $100/mo for probation.  stop paying and go back to jail.|`|UMg1CL7baa	probably just a fine, pay for what you stole and thats that.|`|ZzknHgU1aa	Perhaps spelling lessons?|`|y0jL9n6Taa	Short jail stay and a permenant mark on your record.

P8CBDLiKaa	Protesting a law by breaking that law is counter-productive.  Many here in California "protest" the hands-free cell phone while driving law by ignoring it.  They still get tickets, they still get in accidents (which really increase their insurance rates, more so if the police report mentions the illegal use of a cell phone.<br>  <br>  Another example is the "smoke-ins" that marijuana advocates have now and then.  They announce the event, a dozen or so pot-heads show up and pass around some joints and a bong, and nothing happens because law enforcement doesn't want to fall into the law-suit trap they're trying to create.<br>  <br>  I mean, really, would you protest the laws against murder by killing someone?<br>  <br>  The proper form of protest is peacful marching or demonstrating.|`|fWi18dyoaa	How about this.  In California the legal drinking age is 21.  Not sure about Texas.

You can, for example, blocade the entrance to the legislative building. That's illegal, but it isn't going to harm anyone, or do damage to the building.

To help protect the Guild Wars community from the problems caused by real-money trading, we aggressively pursue these companies and try to stop them from abusing our players and the game. Listed below are some of the measures we take to protect Guild Wars players from the abuses of real-money trading companies.    We identify and ban accountstypically more than 5,000 per weekbeing used by real-money trading companies.      We attempt to identify stolen accounts and return them to their rightful owners.      Our GMs monitor the game around the clock so they can remove botters and spammers from the game, often within hours of account creation.      When we detect a large amount of abuse from a single Internet address (IP address), we block that address from accessing the game.      We block open proxies (open Internet servers which can relay traffic from anywhere in the world) from accessing the game.      We identify players who purchase gold from real-money trading companies, and we suspend their accounts and remove the purchased gold. We also encourage these players to seek restitution from their credit card company. Real-money trading companies are not legally authorized to sell Guild Wars gold. They don't own the gold  ArenaNet does. Credit card companies know this, so buyers of gold can generally call their credit card companies and get the charges removed.   Remember, if you purchase gold for real-world money, you are funding these companies and supporting their behavior. These companies cause real grief to you and your fellow players on a daily basis. If you don't like them spamming, botting, hacking, and stealing accounts, then don't buy their gold.

2lFRYr8Eaa	No.  The reason is a defense attorney cannot suborn perjury.  So if a client says I stabbed him 10 times.  Then wants to testify, the attorney cannot act as in belief if he says on the stand he never did it.  Then, in closing, the attorney cannot argue the lie to the jury.    An attorney needs to not know what actually happened.  For then the attorney does not know for sure the attorney is lying to the jury.   Now if he does tell the attorney the whole story, the Attorney/Client relationship keeps the attorney from telling anyone what he/she was told.|`|AA11622716	In the u.s, anything a client tells a lawyer is priviledged and will not be revealed.

DTSUJe2oaa	All emancipation laws are state sensitive but you meet the criteria of economic self sufficiency in some jurisdictions this article will explain it but your state or country may have different laws.~    Emancipation of minors is a legal mechanism by which a minor is freed from control by their parents or guardians, and the parents or guardians are freed from any and all responsibility toward the child. Until an emancipation is granted by a court, a minor is still subject to the rules of their parents or guardians.    In most countries of the world, adolescents below the legal Age of Majority (adulthood) may be emancipated in some manner: through marriage, economic self-sufficiency, educational degree or diploma, military service, or obtaining medical conditions in a form of diseases such as AIDS, HPV, or other STDs.    Whether parental consent is needed to achieve the "emancipated" status varies from case to case. In some cases, court permission is necessary. Protocols vary by jurisdiction.~
AA10144492	To file a trademark nationally, that's accomplished at the USPTO. The filing we recommend is the $325 per class application. There is a $275 filing but if changes need to be made, which is often the case, the USPTO charges for those changes.     There is no one international trademark. The WIPO filing is as close as you'll be able to get. You can read more about that here: http://www.wipo.int/trademarks/en/    Of course, it's necessary to research the mark comprehensively prior to filing to ensure that there is no possibility of infringing upon another party.    This entails searching the pending & registered Federal and State trademark files as well as the US National Common-Law files.    Hope that helps! I wish you much success & happiness in all your ventures!|`|kO4fEAodaa	First, you can register your mark first and provide proof of use later.  Let's assume you are from the United States.  A mark should be used within 3 years after the registration date to avoid any potential cancellations and an affidavit of use is required after the 5th year.  Most other countries have similar requirements although the procedures can be quite different.    Second, there is an International Trademark filing system.   The U.S. joined the Madrid Protocol on November 2, 2003.  However, you don't just register one of these things and get covered in all member countries.  You claim each country individually and, of course, pay an additional fee for each country you claim.  You can be refused in some countries and accepted in others and not every country is a member, including Canada.    For just a U.S. Mark you could pay as little as 300 Dollars filing yourself online with a very limited protection, but this is definitely not recommended; especially if you have no experience in these matters.  You could easily find yourself being opposed and having to withdraw the mark without anything to show for it.      You will be much better off contacting a credible trademark attorney in your area.  The first consultation will probably be free and you can have a better idea of what your needs are and how much everything will cost than you'll ever get here in Yahoo! Answers.    Contact me and I'll be happy to recommend someone close to your area.    Note:  Anyone watching this question will notice I have edited it.

DTSUJe2oaa	The nation-state in practice  In some cases, the geographic boundaries of an ethnic population and a political state largely coincide. In these cases, there is little immigration or emigration, few members of ethnic minorities, and few members of the "home" ethnicity living in other countries.    Clear examples of nation states include:    Iceland: although the inhabitants are ethnically related to other Scandinavian groups, the national culture and language are found only in Iceland. There are no cross-border minorities the nearest land is too far away.   North and South Korea. There are small group of Chinese Korean in South Korea. In North, no minority group appear to exist.   Japan: Japan is also traditionally seen as an example of a nation-state and also the largest of a nation state with population in excess of 120 million. It should be noted that Japan do have small number of minorities such as Ryky peoples, Koreans, and Chinese, and on the northern island of Hokkaid, the indigenous Ainu minority. However, they are either numerically too insignificant (Ainu) or their difference is not as pronounced (Ryukyuan which is somewhat similar to difference between Dutch and Flemish) or well assimilated (Zainichi population is collapsing due to assimilation/naturalisation). ;see also Japanese Demographics and Ethnic issues in Japan.   Portugal: although surrounded by other lands and people, the Portuguese nation has occupied the same territory for almost 900 years. The modern Portuguese nation is a very old amalgam of formerly distinct historical populations that passed through and settled in the territory of modern Portugal: native Iberian peoples, Celts, ancient Mediterraneans (Greeks, Phoenicians, Romans), Germanic peoples like the Suebi and the Visigoths, invading Berbers and Arabs, and Jews.[2]   Several Polynesian countries such as Tonga, Tuvalu, etc.   Poland, after World War II (After the Expulsion of Germans after World War II). ~     monarchy is a form of government in which supreme power is absolutely or nominally lodged in an individual, who is the head of state, often for life or until abdication, and "is wholly set apart from all other members of the state."[1] The person who heads a monarchy is called a monarch. It was a common form of government in the world during the ancient and medieval times.    There is no clear definition of monarchy. Holding unlimited political power in the state is not the defining characteristic, as many constitutional monarchies such as the United Kingdom and Thailand are considered monarchies. Hereditary rule is often a common characteristic, but elective monarchies are considered monarchies (the pope, sovereign of the Vatican City State, is elected by the College of Cardinals) and some states have hereditary rulers, but are considered republics (such as the stadtholder of the Dutch Republic, or the Great Council of Chiefs in Fiji).[1] A 1914 edition of Bouvier's Law Dictionary states that "Monarchy is contradistinguished from republic," and gives this definition:~
6OLiuM9Gaa	I enlisted in the Navy at age 20 with a degree in math. I didn't pursue an officer program because I didn't know if I wanted to make the commitment. about four years later, when it came time for me to extend for my E-6, somebody dusted off my degree and recommended me for OCS. I took the option and retired at 45.    Trying your hand as enlisted, at least in the Navy, gives you the opportunity to try your management skills gradually. An officer is expected to just be able to take the reins. A lot of the time he's not ready. Some may never be ready. There are a lot of mediocre officers out there... in all the branches.    The reason I accepted the appointment was that I knew the kind of officer under which I would have liked to serve. I'd seen some good ones. I'd also seen some that "may never be ready."    Some services seem to promote based solely on longevity. Some seem to promote based on politics... who you know. Some sometimes promote based only on expedience... a lieutenant is supposed to be filling a position, so they make whoever's filling the position a lieutenant. In fact none  As a result some of the mediocre officers make it to the top. Sometimes it happens in the Navy too, but probably less often.    If you become an officer in some highly combative unit... like Special Operations of some kind... after you reach a certain rank they wean you away from the action and you get to ride a desk. In the Navy it's LCDR (O-4). On the other hand, I know a guy who's E-8 who still works out with the kiddies. He's going to retire this year.|`|JqnDk7Shaa	if you want to be an officer, you either must already have a degree or get one from their acadmies and do 6 years    or you can enlist as garbage man or trash picker or dish washer...    of course there's a 900000% difference in pay    take your pick|`|0qFIeV8faa	im doing the same thing but for army im taking rotc courses and even if you don't want to become an officer u can request not to be an officer there not going to force you to lead someone when u don't want to yet i suggest you take them they changed my life and even if u don't want to be an officer after joining the marines u might want to later on     well im not sure for marines but after rotc for army you get the rank of second lieutenant which means you just leapt over a **** load of other people who could possible be ur competition since ur younger and have a longer time to learn what it takes to get into special ops|`|83205fb34700949ba53315bffc459748aa	if you want to do ROTC you would definitely feel comfortable to lead. that's what they teach you. you could get a full scholarship and then go in directly as an officer. if you decide to enlist you need to keep a few things in mind; number one, if you want to use your GI bill for school, you have to pay into it for a year, and then you can use it after that, it will probably take you longer than 4 years if you do part time schooling, as it is difficult to take classes and be in the military, most marines do not earn college degrees.  if you really want to go to college, which is the best option, see about getting a scholarship for ROTC, that would pay for you school, plus give you a stipened of spending cash. that means that school would be your job. you need to maintain good grades in your classes and when you graduate you'd be an officer. you will make a graduation goal sheet, so if you found you could be out of school early (ie 3 years instead of 4) then you could still commission.    i definitely think that going officer is the best way... not only is the money better, but you have to think about how much knowledge your ganing as well, and experience.   in the end it's what you really want to do... and if you want to be spec ops i do think you need to be an officer, not positive about how it works in the marines|`|IfNjgcxGaa	i was thinking much the same when i chose to join, my idea was go on active for a few years as enlisted in order to gain experience and learn the ropes or at least see how the leaders work.  then planning on going to college and joining the NROTC and possibly becoming an officer|`|hexzaIGgaa	No, the last two years of ROTC entail a service commitment as a commissioned officer.    To get a commission, you must have a BA/BS degree...and attend OCS/OTS/PLC or ROTC. Of course, you could also compete for a slot in the military academies, but that is not probable if you are already enrolled in college, as they do not allow transfer credit.
1219d6000cca01c9f3c4489d1c7b4a16aa	It's not going to be a check, it's a tax cut.    When Bush sent checks out to people for $600 or whatever, it cost the government millions of dollars to print all the checks, all the envelopes, go over all the data, double check it for errors, buy all the stamps, hire all the staff to oversee this process, etc...  It doesn't make sense to spend so much money to send so much money when you're trying to stimulate the economy.  It makes more sense to just not take the taxes to begin with.|`|F3kiXNUEaa	Yes, we should.    The stimulus package has to go to the Senate for some changes and it is expected to go back to the house after that.    So, it might take 2-3 weeks before the stimulus package is approved.    PFO is right though it will not be a check, it will be a tax cut.

So, when those tax cuts are gone, the tax for those people making $250k a year will go back up to where they were during the clinton years.  so, in a way, it's basically an income tax raise for those rich people only.

Tout sauf une poule sans cervelle !|`|EnAJVmCMaa	Les quatre premiers prvisibles sont trs proches et je crois toutes les configurations possibles. Les "sondages" ne veulent rien dire, ils sont tellement redresss qu'ils en sont tout tordus. Savez-vous que le Pen sort en "brut"  5-6% ?     C'est pas des sondages mais des projections  partir de sondages.     Ceci dit, le Pen a dit quelque chose d'intressant ce dimanche : il a prvenu qu'il y aurait DEUX grosses surprises au 1er tour. (A l'instant il vient encore de le laisser entendre dans un reportage de i-tl)    Il faut peut-tre le prendre au srieux, c'est un trs fin analyste politique et il est bien inform.Il avait prvenu qu'il serait au 2 tour en 2002, personne ne l'a cru ; et j'ai not qu'il fait gnralement de bons pronostics.     Pour moi, ?a ne peut vouloir dire que deux choses :   1/ il prvoit d'tre au second tour  2/ pour la deuxime grosse surprise, il y a trois possibilits :   a. Royal fait un score vraiment trs bas (moins de 15%) derrire Bayrou et il se retrouve contre Sarkozy ( ?a c'est pas tonnant, c'est pour ?a qu'il faut ajouter que la gauche fait un score faible). Assez peu probable  b. Sarkozy n'est pas qualifi pour le second tour. L ce serait vraiment la plus norme des surprises puisque si on pense que Bayrou ou mme le Pen peuvent devancer Royal, personne n'imagine que Sarko puisse tre limin ( preuve, votre question). Depuis huit ans que lui et les mdias nous serinent qu'il sera le favori, tout le monde le voit en tte.  c. Il  se retrouve contre Bayrou. Mais  ?a ferait trois surprises.     Donc je pense qu'il prvoit un 2 tour le Pen - Royal (ou ventuellement Bayrou-Royal).       A part ?a j'ai envie de rpondre que le 2 tour sera forcment droite-droite, car le premier candidat de gauche pointe  5%.     Les dernires dclarations de Rocard, Kouchner, Cohn-Bendit ajoutent de l'eau au moulin de ce que de plus en plus de monde pense : le PS est devenu le parti de la bourgeoisie intellectuelle de droite ; celle-ci a marginalis progressivement les vrais gauchistes au sein du parti (vous avez vu Emmanuelli et Mlenchon rcemment?).     Pourquoi? Parce qu'en France la droite rpublicaine a toujours t anti-intellectuelle, populiste et poujadiste. Elle n'aime pas les gens qui rflchissent trop, elle prfre les hommes d'action avec une vision terre--terre, des ides simples et des raisonnements "de bon sens", c'est--dire  l'emporte-pice. Mme quand des intellectuels transis la soutiennent (Aron,  maintenant Ferry), les dirigeants les tiennent  la marge. Donc ils se sont rfugis au PS.     Peut-tre dans leur jeunesse "rvolte" ont-ils cru sincrement tre de gauche, mais en vieillissant ils ont "volu" comme ils disent... ils ont abandonn les ides "na?ves" de leur jeunesse. Peut-tre mme certains se croient-ils encore de gauche!    Franchement, quand vous coutez Kouchner (qui se prend vraiment de plus en plus pour Bernard Kouchner, quelle morgue!) nous donner ses le?ons de socialisme "clair" (par le libralisme des  no-cons, d'ailleurs ?a s'appelle le "social-libralisme"), vous entendez un discours de gauche ?|`|ONqp5OVraa	Il y a toutes les CHANCES que ce soit droite contre droite au deuxime tour. En effet, les candidats de gauche sont trs mauvais et ne sont pas crdible, Sgolne en particulier.

But it's not just killing, it's murdering.<br>  <br>  Intentionally taking the life of another for personal gain is murder.|`|ErTVzpUUaa	Yes abortion is killing a human being who hasn't even had a chance at life, to live it well or mess it up, but they should have a chance!  And Annabell, Convicted killers have screwed up and get what's coming to them, and when people go to war,(and so far that's still voluntary), They know what can happen!|`|4ErIxkhyaa	I'm OK with emergency Abortion procedures due to extreme  trauma resulting from severe Auto Accidents or Terrorist attacks on a pregnant woman.<br>  <br>  If a woman is injured by a roadside IED and her unborn child has severe organ damage and is hemorrhaging profusely. I'm OK with abortion to save the woman's life.|`|GcQl76mfaa	If abortion is murder, is miscarriage manslaughter?<br>  <br>  And that whole "we could have cured AIDS if the mom didn't abort him" fallacy works both ways. who knows how many serial killers/terrorists/violent people have been eradicated by abortion? can we answer that question? of course not, because that's a stupid fallacious argument.|`|gdYN39gtaa	You bet.  Abortion stops a beating heart.  As far as Jesus Hussein's<br>   answer.......Sperm and Eggs are not babys. Fertilization has to<br>   come first, that is when a baby forms and starts to grown. (My<br>   lesson to the uninformed)|`|6AgnCKCPaa	Yes, of course it is.  You are intentionally ending a life, thus it is killing..<br>  <br>  Boy, it seems some don't understand that sperm and eggs are not alive in and of themselves..|`|8tf5rOXdaa	Unless the baby lives yes.|`|BRyRtQSvaa	Yep|`|VVCpJFxtaa	Yes, it is. In all successful cases of abortion a human being dies. I think your question should be is abortion justifiable in some cases? There are some cases where it is. The life and true mental well-being of the mother for instance. In 95% of the cases though abortion is murder. There is just no rational argument for it otherwise.<br>  <br>  Shutterbug: You can be against abortion but, pro-death penalty and still take part in a war. Anti-abortion activists are against the intentional killing of innocent life. No baby has committed a crime worthy of death. On the other hand, a convicted murderer has been tried, convicted of murder, and given the penalty of death. If you want to try to use the bible for your argument, you need to realize that there are instances where the death penalty and war are allowed and even sanctioned by god.|`|pslJQ0Jfaa	I'm an atheist, and yes. Only a pig would have an abortion. Usually, abortions harm the pig that had one mentally and they are more dependent on social welfare programs then they would have been if they kept their child. Even if do not agree that a fetus is a baby, it is still a potential, and murdering that fetus is killing masked by the term "abortion" to deflect the reality of the slaughter of baby's. <br>  Pairing this issue with "woman's rights" is also a fraud. No one wants woman to have less rights. The pro-life argument has nothing to do with taking rights away from woman. It has everything to do with protecting the life of a baby.<br>  Abortion, or slaughtering of baby's as I consider it, is not a substitute for birth control. The pig could have taken responsibility and eliminated the risk well before a pregnancy occurred.|`|lUd5dj2haa	I believe that once the sperm connects with the egg it would be murder to abort it. Even at that point if you were to let it grow it would eventually get bigger and bigger and then come out (as if everyone didn't know that already. lol) You never know what kind of people aren't around from abortion. Maybe someone that would have had the cure to AIDS or cancer. It's a selfish thing to do. Killing someone because of irresponsibility. I know people that are really cool who had doctors tell their parents to abort them.  The least you could do is put it up for adoption if you feel you can't give the child a good life. Seems like people are more worried about saving trees these days than people.|`|RSP5djNbaa	No. I think that under some conditions, it is better. Like if the girl is raped at 15. Think about it, she still has to go through high school, she will be known as a slut, the child will come into the world unwelcome and put into foster care. and is that really the best life style you want for either the girl or the baby? it might sound selfish, but sometimes you have to do whats best for you, and sometimes a child is not the best thing for you. I do believe in Abortion, and that the government does not have a right to tell a women what do to with her body and her baby. Overall its her decision, and she should choose whats going to be best for her, and for the childs life.|`|Fx4iLzbYaa	My dear don't compare the death of criminals and war to the killing of something innocent, and alive. I believe in capital punishment, although i think we let some criminals get off easy, with the escape of death. I think ceriel rapest, murders, and child molesters, should be tortured for what they have done.|`|IuJjYz6gaa	No.<br>  <br>  Because I believe that it's not a life until it breathes.  Which is what the Bible says (anyone interested can visit <a href="http://www.rcrc.org)." rel="nofollow">http://www.rcrc.org).</a>  <br>  <br>  Annabelle is totally right, even if you believe it is a life, you cannot support the death penalty and war and say that all killing is wrong.<br>  <br>  And if it is my husband is going to hell because he's killed Iraqi's.  Killing is killing, right?<br>  <br>  Eddy, you completely missed my point.  My point was that you can't say it's all black and white becaues it's not.  It's all a gray area.  Yes, war and being sentenced to death are used in the Bible.   And the Bible also states that a woman's life is worth more than a fetus and that to live means "to breathe".  The argument can come from all sides.<br>  <br>  I don't really believe my husband is going to hell because he has killed, maybe even taken innocent lives.  And I don't believe that women who have an abortion are going to hell either.  At least not if they are saved.<br>  <br>  We are not God, we cannot judge who deserves to die and who doesn't.  Yes, we do it, but that doesn't make it right.  It's not our place.<br>  <br>  There are already too many unwanted children in this world.  Why add to that number?  Every child should be wanted and loved.  Every child.<br>  <br>  It seems like people want to protect the unborn, but aren't willing to protect them after they are born.  Why is that?|`|fXeqf3btaa	Yes, it is....even in extreme circumstances. If there is a tubal pregnancy, then you make the decision to terminate in order to save the mother....and the baby is killed....its black and white here....as for extreme circumstances regarding rape, there are many many other alternatives. It is an unfortunate situation but that does not mean that an unborn child should pay the price.|`|1CxcmMdiaa	I think so. <br>  A tough place to draw the line is a tube pregnancy... If a woman has one of those, she WILL die unless the baby is aborted... Or miraculously decides to move along.<br>  <br>  I'd like to think that I'd have the courage to leave it in God's hands and not kill the baby if such a thing ever happened to me.|`|hCsAHDjNaa	It might be, but nobody who supports the death penalty and the war in Iraq has any room to talk about how wrong killing is. Its killing, but its by definition not murder and if I hear that again, I'll rip someone's eyeball out of their head. I'm sorry, I'm really pro-choice...|`|ciQFlpuLaa	yes. the fetus is more than just a clump of cells... it has a beating heart and can feel pain. if abortion had been legal in the 1960s, Obama might not exist today.|`|yqpTwD5Naa	I'm not God.  But yes.  It's ending a potential life.
43b73829c8ee958f3da9e1e8f2a7d117aa	Pienso que el grado de civilizacin de una sociedad, su estado moral, su proyeccin de futuro, su capacidad de regenerarse, radica en la proteccin y atencin a los ni?os y adolescentes.  Sociedades como la tailandesa, en donde la prostitucin infantil est a la orden del da, nos habla de una sociedad podrida hasta sus cimientos. Y si adems son precisamente los occidentales los que aprovechan esa podredumbre, estamos ante la cara ms oscura de la sociedad occidental.   Un menor maltratado o traumatizado es siempre un adulto angustiado y utilizado. Alguien que ha interiorizado la violencia, la falta de valores y la inauteticidad de la gente.  Creo que los gastos en educacin, la proteccin de las familias con hijos y la proteccin de la mujer en concreto para que pueda realizar su funcin de madre son algo importantsimo en la sociedad.   Hay pases como Espa?a que alcanzan un nivel de desarrollo muy grande a costa de perder la capacidad de regenerar su poblacin. se dejan de tener hijos o se tienen dependiendo de la economa. Tener hijos es un clculo.   Mujeres separadas o divorciadas que acaban en la prostitucion por que la ley no protege no ya a ellas sino a los ni?os inocentes que tienen a su cargo.  en fin. Creo que las cosas importantes de la sociedad,las cosas ms bsicas,a  veces quedan completamente de lado, cuando todo se valora por el dinero.|`|TvNWCiduaa	Pues que es una injusticia que se tenga que abusar de los menores, aunque no solo de ellos si no de todas las personas.  Creo que somos libres, pero en realidad muchsima gente sobre todo en zonas pobres o de bajos recursos son sometidos.  Debera de hacerse algo y no solo promesas para solucionar toda esta explotacin de personas, la prostitucin y las decandencias a las que llegan.  Lamentablemente los gobiernos no han podido solucionar este tipo de problemas puesto que de todo sacan beneficios, es lamentable ver como la gente es explotada as, pero si nosotros no hacemos algo, nadie lo har!!!

Without more detail, it is difficult to answer your question. So what follows is just some general information.     Each state varies a little, but the most require that an individual work at least 20 to 25 weeks. The amount earned per week may also be a factor. If California is the only state in which you have worked, then you will need to establish a wage history there before you qualify. However, if you have recently moved to California and you have worked in another state, or multiple states, monetary eligibility is not contingent on the length of time you have lived in California. For example, if you recently moved from Arizona, where you have an established wage history, California would most likely advise you to contact Arizona to file your claim. You may apply for benefits with a state in which you do not reside. If you have worked in more than one state, California may do what is called a combined wage claim. In this case California would request wage information from each state where you have worked in approximately the past 18 months and California would administer the benefits.     Again, contact your local office. There is no harm in contacting them regarding eligibility questions.
