7hx7re06aa	Having more video memory can always be a good thing, some newer games, like GTA IV, limits what graphics options you can use depending on video memory. Also if you are using larger resolution screens, more video memory can be a big advantage. <br>  $100 seems a bit over the top for such a small change, there might be more than just video memory involved, it could be a faster version of the same video card. Is one an LT and one a Pro or anything? that can make a big difference.|`|DF6asJPLaa	256 MB should be ok for most games, but in the future, 512 would be better, to run vista, it recommends 128mb of graphics memory, and requires at least 64 MB. windows XP required 8MB and recommended 64MB, so in theory, windows 7(newest version, to be released august 2009) should require at least 128mb|`|KLt8LAoaaa	It depends on what kind of gaming you want to do, and whether you'll be doing any video editing.  256MB card should be fine for most everything, just don't expect to be able to play top of the line games at their highest graphics settings.

If so this has happened to me so I went to the Apple Downloads page and you can download the downloads there instead of through the Software Updater. This way is more reliable. Could you let me know what Version of Mac OS X you have? Is it Leopard, Tiger, Panther, etc.. and if it is like Leopard could you let me know if it is 10.5.x You can find this out my clicking the Apple Logo in the top left corner then clicking "About This Mac" And it will say "Version 10.x.x" or whatever the version is.

LHWeXLJ3aa	Your hard drive would have to be under a condition in which it's operating at a slower write speed than your internet download speed. Factors which contribute to a under-performing HDD write speed include platter integrity (read: HDD age), fragmentation (which will occur more on a fuller HDD), external processes (ie what other programs are also competing for access to the hard drive).<br>  <br>  While it is possible for a slow drive to slow down internet speeds, in reality I don't believe any of these conditions would cause an otherwise working hard drive to operate slower than any consumer internet connection, especially if the only factor is increase fragmentation due to a fuller drive.

FTP transfers files as fast as the connection can go - but it takes a lot of bandwidth.  Torrent was developed to not use so much bandwidth - meaning that it's slow.  So why is it slow?

z2EVwBokaa	Hello, the program is fine, but I think it's the way of writing the instructions... Remember that the program is reading line by line... so let's look at it:<br>  int num1, num2 and num3 <br>  makes the 3 variables needed for the average.<br>  then... double numAverage gets the average without ever reading the new numbers...<br>  So... I'd recommend...<br>  <br>  # include <iostream><br>  using namespace std;<br>  int main() {<br>  int num1;<br>  int num2;<br>  int num3;<br>  cout << "Please enter three numbers." << endl;<br>  cin >> num1;<br>  cin >> num2;<br>  cin >> num3;<br>  /*Leaving this after the variables are read, assures you that num1,num2 and num3 have the values you entered and not the default ones when a new variable is made.*/<br>  double numAverage = (num1 + num2 + num3) / 3;<br>  cout << "The average is" << endl;<br>  cout << numAverage << endl;<br>  system("PAUSE");<br>  return 0;<br>  }|`|JNdlTP5Iaa	The problem is that you are referencing num1 num2 and num3 before assigning them a value.<br>  <br>  Move "double numAverage = (num1 + num2 + num3) / 3;" after the "cin >> num3;"<br>  <br>  Also, change "double numAverage = (num1 + num2 + num3) / 3;" to:<br>  double numAverage = (num1 + num2 + num3) / double(3);<br>  <br>  I'm a computer science major.  Hope this helps. ( I tested it as edited, it woks).|`|iCnVDy0paa	double numAverage = (num1 + num2 + num3) / 3;<br>  is before<br>  cin >> num1;<br>  cin >> num2;<br>  cin >> num3;<br>  <br>  So num1,num2,num3 haven't been intialized correctly|`|wUqeZl3Saa	include <iostream><br>  using namespace std;<br>  int main() {<br>  int num1;<br>  int num2;<br>  int num3;<br>  double numAverage;<br>  cout << "Please enter three numbers." << endl;<br>  cin >> num1;<br>  cin >> num2;<br>  cin >> num3;<br>  numAverage = (num1 + num2 + num3) / 3;<br>  cout << "The average is" << endl;<br>  cout << numAverage << endl;<br>  return 0;<br>  } <br>  <br>  You had everything there, just in the wrong order. Also it is better if you declare your variables at the top. That way it is easier for someone else reading your program.<br>  <br>  There is never a reason to use the pause this way. Open a command window and run it from the command line. If I was the instructor, I'd be taking points off for it and if the instructor suggested it, I'd take points off for the instructor.<br>  <br>  Shadow Wolf

6GB5P7ojaa	It means that only one seed is available for you. Also, maybe it's your internet connection. Ask your service provider the problem and if you can upgrade your speed to a higher level. When you're downloading a torrent, the torrent file is greatly affected by the number of seeders and leechers. The more seeders and leechers you have, the faster the download. You will also need a decent enough internet connection. You can pay a website monthly or yearly for direct downloads. Direct downloads are not affected by the number of seeders and leechers and they are faster to download. They will even let you choose the download rate of the file you are downloading.<br>  <br>  I hope this helps!<br>  Good luck!

wkLTTr06aa	Here is the way to do it on my HP computer (it too is about 7 yrs old).<br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  Reinstalling Windows XP Home Edition<br>  <br>  First:    Back up any of your files you wish to keep to the backup hard drive. (USB HD)<br>   I f you have no backup hard drive you can use CD’s or DVD’s<br>   My computer did not come with USB 2.0 so I installed a card and have drivers on CD<br>   My computer did not have SP2 installed so I ordered a disk from Microsoft for SP2<br>   Also write down your internet settings and e-mail settings and keep them handy.<br>  Have installation disks ready for:  printer, scanner, USB 2.0 card install disk, Linksys wireless disk, etc. Microsoft’s SP-2 disk<br>  <br>  Now you can start:<br>  <br>  FYI: For my HP pavilion 750 c computer …..your computer may use different keys<br>  Boot Options: F8 starts the safe mode option F10 starts HP system recovery F1 starts bios setup Escape key allows you to change boot order for the current startup (on my HP computer).<br>  <br>  If you are going to use the hidden boot partition use F10 key when starting you will not need to change the bios setting as per above.<br>  Now it’s time to start the computer. BE SURE TO DISCONNECT THE MODEM  FIRST and leave it disconnected until the anti-virus application is in service  Otherwise you may get a virus while you are installing the antivirus program  to your unprotected system.<br>  1. Run HP recovery (either the hidden partition or using the disks) Note: the disks will format the hard drive and you lose all your data. The hidden partition offers a “nondestructive” option that allows you to save all your data, files, settings, etc. The hidden partition recovery also offers a  “ destructive” option that installs all the original apps and operating system and erases your files and data. Same as the “disks” option without changing all the disks.<br>  <br>  2. Windows will ask you to choose language, set the time, computer name and some other setup questions. Read carefully and follow the directions exactly.<br>  <br>  3. When Windows finally starts it will automatically detect the USB 2.0 card and ask for installation disk. Go ahead and set up the USB 2.0 now. You will get a pop up informing you that the new hardware is installed and ready to use.If your computer already has USB 2.0 skip this step<br>  <br>  4. Notice the desktop will have a lot of shortcut icons pointing to “try me buy me” programs.<br>  Now is a good time to delete all the unwanted shortcuts and uninstall all the junk programs.<br>  You may need to reboot after uninstalling some of them but that’s OK.<br>  Getting rid of the “junk” now will let SP-2 install faster because before it installs it makes a restore point and backs up all files. No use to backup junk programs .(If you need to install SP2)<br>  <br>  5. Set your monitor resolution now to your preference. Will be easier to see everything.<br>  <br>  6. Turn the power on and plug in the USB cable. Windows will detect it, install drivers and notify when it is finished. This step is for my USB 2.0 card which I installed. My computer came with USB 1.0 ports and I wanted to use the faster USB 2.0.<br>  <br>  7. Install your anti-virus program and be sure the Windows firewall is turned on (it is in internet properties and you may need to check the box “Protect My Computer From the Internet”( or something very similar), it’s different than SP-2 and may be turned off by default. You may need to connect to the internet to finish installing your antivirus program.<br>  <br>  8. CAUTION: Do not connect the modem until you are sure the firewall is working.<br>  <br>  9. Update your anti-virus set it up to protect your computer and do the first AV scan .<br>  <br>  10. Delay downloading windows updates until SP-2 is installed.<br>  <br>  11. Start Internet Explorer and set up your e-mail account now.<br>  <br>  12. Reboot and start the install of SP-2 from the MS disk. SP-2 will ask to reboot when it’s done. Leave the SP-2 disk in the drive until you after it reboots and you are sure it’s finished. Check the Windows Security Center to be sure the Firewall is turned on, make sure it sees your anti-virus app and turn set automatic updates to “Notify Me But Do Not download”. Note: if your computer came with SP 2 preinstalled you will not need this step.<br>  <br>  13. Now you can install printer, scanner, wireless access point and your programs. Windows will have about 100 updates over the next day or two. <br>  <br>  14. Download / install / Run first scan of Spybot S&D  Set real time protection and immunization. <br>  <br>  15. It’s a good time to check for driver updates now if it’s been awhile since you did this.<br>  <br>  16. You should be “good to go now”.<br>  <br>  17. Put all the disks you used in one place along with a copy of this procedure for next time.<br>  <br>  18. Now it is time to reinstall your applications. Just install them as you use them to make it easier. <br>  <br>  Hope this helps ( along with the other answers )<br>  <br>  Al|`|CQOfjctOaa	maybe he did a system restore. go to the control panel and try to restore your computer at a past date when it was working correctly.|`|a5d4060d41b8ba3a058e5b8de42068e2aa	op. system install / re-install steps  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  print a copy of this file  <br>  <br>  print a copy of computer  notes <br>  <br>  export browser Fav's / bookmarks  <br>  <br>  back-up files, programs ;  <br>  <br>  power down  <br>  <br>  disconnect  network  and external drives  <br>  <br>  power up <br>  <br>  delete tif files ( temp internet files ) and cookies;  <br>  <br>  un-install  programs; <br>  <br>  delete folders;  <br>  <br>  delete  accounts  <br>  <br>  empty recycle bin  <br>  <br>  restart computer  <br>  <br>  Go to BIOS and set boot order with CD boot 1st  <br>  <br>  place O.S.

Create and download documents to another partition.  <br>  <br>  <br>  leave at least one partition unused, for migration. At least once a year, migrate your stuff to a unused partition, especially if you do a lot of editing, then format the abandoned partition, for the next time. <br>  <br>  With only the op. sys. on the hosting partition, it will be easier for your computer to run the op., and easier to run everything else. <br>  <br>  And, with your files and software on other partitions, your stuff is already in back-up, and the next op.

Re-install will be already half done and much easier to do  and you will only have to format the host partition and not the whole hard drive  <br>  <br>  Also, increase your RAM to at least double of mfg.

The only way I've ever done one without a recovery disk is by either accessing the System Recovery options through the Start Menu or by the pre-boot recovery menu.<br>  Go to Start Menu/All Programs/Accessories/System Tools and look for the System Recovery option. If you don't see it, restart the computer and immediately start tapping the F12 key as it boots up. ( If F12 does not work try F10.) The System Recovery menu should load before Windows starts up. <br>  You should have two recovery options. One is a non-destructive recovery and the other is an advanced recovery. An advanced recovery wipes out all your personal data and restores the factory shipped applications. The non-destructive recovery restores the factory shipped applications but leaves your user data. I would suggest that you back up your data and do the advanced recovery, because either way you will have to re-install all of your programs. Just be sure you locate the disks with the drivers for your wireless card before you do the recovery.

wUqeZl3Saa	Yes.<br>  <br>  If you read the Defense Wall propaganda, it will tell you that you need both.<br>  <br>  What Defense Wall does is simply run selected programs with very limited permissions. This is similar to working in a limited user account only with automatic and much more limited permissions for some programs. The "sandbox" isolates any malware attempts and prevents them from doing harm. Nothing ever leaves the sandbox unless you give it permission.<br>  <br>  You could achieve the same effect with a virtual machine. Inside the virtual machine, all would appear normal. Any changes to the virtual machine would stay within the virtual machine. Outside the virtual machine is your safe and secure host.

XI5aQb2taa	I tend to favour one card solutions, so I'd go with just the one 4870.  <br>  <br>  Two 9800's will outperform the 4870 in games that have good SLI scaling, but in other games (like Crysis, or Empire Total War, for example) that have very poor SLI scaling, the 4870 would noticeably outperform the two 9800's.  It would put them to shame, even.<br>  <br>   Single card solutions also tend to have better average framerates, and also tend to be less gimpy and just work better (although there have been some great strides in this area).  Dual card solutions also need a compatible motherboard with dual PCIe X16 slots, a beefy power supply and great cooling.<br>  <br>  And really, for the price you can find the 4870 today ( $169 <a href="http://www.newegg.com/Product/Product.aspx?Item=N82E16814102810" rel="nofollow">http://www.newegg.com/Product/Product.as...</a> ) it seems like a much better choice to me.  It will run you any game out there on high settings up to 1900x1200 resolutions, and the 1GB versions can even handle 2560x2560 (with lower quality settings).  There isn't really a reason to get two cards when one will do, in my opinion.  <br>  <br>  Hope that helps.

QtoDx4Vtaa	The first thought that came to me was that the BiOS didn't know which Windows to load, even if they're the same thing. And if they are the same version of Windows, then you're obviously not trying to have a dual-boot machine. The D drive is one that first hard drive, that's where Windows is stored. When you're looking at the order of the drives, you're looking at the boot order (where the BiOS tries looking for an OS from those devices in that order). What I would do is format the second HDD and partition it with a boot load helper such as Hiren boot CD (which Hiren is actually illegal, sorry). If you want two HDDs on one computer, you don't need Windows on both of them.<br>  <br>  Edit: thinking now, when you format the second HDD, switch the jumpers on the back from master to slave. That would also throw the BiOS off. It's receiving two different masters and doesn't know how to handle them.|`|1sVnKtSFaa	First of all, you are using the  HDD for just storing stuff? If you are, you need to set it to a slave drive..

wUqeZl3Saa	A lot depends on how long the files need to be archived.<br>  <br>  I have encrypted files on old 3.5 floppies that can only be read on a win95/98/ME or DOS box because the encryption program I used will only run under one of those operating systems. It can't run in a command window under WinXP or Vista. If I were to lose the encryption program, I may not be able to replace it as it may no longer be archived, I don't have the source code and I didn't write the program. Also, the encryption is government stopping strength and as such nothing in the world can read those disks other than that program with the correct passphrase. These days, I can probably safely format them as the data is not worth keeping, but it makes my point.<br>  <br>  If you can, use something like SHA-1 or SHA-2 to hash a long secure passphrase into a key for AES. Use that key to encrypt a random key for the actual encryption key. This hides the fact that you may have used the same key for all the files. Then using cipher block chaining, encrypt each individual file. Store the passphrase somewhere other than the CD.<br>  <br>  Make a plaintext readme note of the relevant FIPS-PUB standards and details of the encrypted file structure and keys so that the encryption program may be duplicated as well as any warnings you might want to include about the data contained on the CD. You may also want to include a copy of your command line program's source code hopefully written in C or C++ so that it will be easy to recompile in 10 years. I doubt C or C++ will be going out of favor any time soon and this makes for an operating system independent program.<br>  <br>  Just maybe, the data won't be worth anything eventually and you can simply destroy the CD. Keep copies of the encryption program and source code for future use.<br>  <br>  Shadow Wolf|`|IcDYEf3Naa	Well, when my mom does things like this, usually she'll write "Confidential" or "ATTN: (name/business/office here) Only."<br>  <br>  That, or she will give the CD straight to whom it is intended for, to eliminate the middle man or snoopers.<br>  <br>  :)

The worst that could happen is that you damage the power supplies, motherboard, and/or the hard drives.<br>  <br>  However, if you still want to try it, I suggest you take any black (ground) wire from both power supplies and connect them together.|`|iCnVDy0paa	I know you can but its quite hard.<br>  The best thing to do is buy a splitter.<br>  <a href="http://www.google.co.uk/products?hl=en&safe=off&client=firefox-a&rls=org.mozilla:en-GB:official&hs=zHo&ei=8yuzSaCfOtTIjAfGhO3TBQ&resnum=0&q=4+pin+molexes+splitter&um=1&ie=UTF-8&ei=9SuzSfjNIJSIjAfd7eXfBQ&sa=X&oi=product_result_group&resnum=1&ct=title" rel="nofollow">http://www.google.co.uk/products?hl=en&s...</a>|`|AA10409603	if the tower can hold them then yes,, go for it,, sounds like your rig needs the extra power...|`|ebuxHnScaa	It can be done, but you need a special adapter to ensure they power up and down together. Lian-Li makes one for around $15.<br>  <br>  I'd consider connecting both video cards to the same power supply and connecting the motherboard/CPU to the other. However, I think you're being a little crazy. Even if you figure 220W for the CPU/mobo, 250 watts for each graphics card, and 100 watts for drives, you still get only 820 watts.<br>  <br>  Caution: Do not connect any device across both power supplies. For example, the same power supply that provides the main ATX power connector to your motherboard should provide the 12V connect to the motherboard as well. The same power supply that provides one power connector to your graphics card should supply the other connector on that same card.|`|eTLG23N4aa	NO !

8yAQjqRpaa	update tracker<br>  <br>  if you shutdown down your torrent program it loses all trackers<br>  or go to the site where you downloaded the torrent and redownload it will ask if you want ot reload the trackers click yes|`|85d5c38331fae62016d580382336c559aa	It seems that you have firewall enabled which can greatly decrease your download speeds.<br>  Also set your download/upload limit such that it is within limit your connection limits<br>  <br>  To improve download speeds disable windows firewalls, set your connection limits and open ports on router which bittorrent uses<br>  Opening of ports depends on every different router. google it and u will find it.Also get torrents which have good seed-leechers ratio<br>  <br>  Anyway I was connected to 2 seeds and 5 peers yet I got speed of 20-30kB/s|`|O1gO5SP6aa	sure,<br>  <br>  just don't rely on a particular website for downloading torrents,i've also face the same problems earlier<br>  <br>  check mininova,isohunt,torrentz and other sites too and chek for more seeds and leechers<br>  <br>  well it too depends on ur connection speed,usually torrents works very slow with dialup users but works pretty fine with broadband and dsl users!!|`|aDxPdXkWaa	Stop downloading illegal stuff, you nub.

QnHqCZa3aa	i am not sure what you want to do. <br>  but at the last paragraph as you said. the values popped off are the objects & values are of type doubles. you can convert those object types to doubles. this operation is called "unboxing"(converting reference variable to value type).  All you have to do is. <br>  <br>  value1 = (double) operandStack.Pop();<br>  value2 = (double) operandStack.Pop();<br>  <br>  try this.
jBipWFPaaa	Yeah, 3.2 GHz is indeed for a single core, and yes, more cores USUALLY does make the clock requirement go down- after all, the clock speed is 2.6 GHz for each individual core. <br>  However, multiple cores only help on programs and games that are multithreaded, meaning that the program can be "cut up" into smaller programs, and each core will run one.<br>  For Crysis, don't worry about that- it's multithreaded.<br>  However, some games, such as Team Fortress 2, are not multithreaded at all, and so have performance issues on multi core systems.|`|zxyevbRgaa	More cores = more processing power at lower clock rate.<br>  <br>  Core 2 / Athlon X2     Requirements for Crysis<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.incrysis.com/wiki/index.php/Crysis_System_Requirements" rel="nofollow">http://www.incrysis.com/wiki/index.php/C...</a>

(This I've only done on computers running Vista, don't think you can do it on XP)|`|AA11691724	there's three ways you might do this. 1. download a copy from the internet, and use your key to activate it. 2. upload the complete file to the internet, and then download it back to your laptop.  3. you could use a parallel cable between both computers, but you need to be running the same operating system on both computers. with xp, see microsoft article id 207885.

AA10700604	Hello Yitzhak K,<br>  <br>  Your MacBook came with some freebies.  Your iLife 08’ was not the full version.  The full version was a purchased disc, and if you purchased the full version, you should still have the discs available for you to re-download this suite of programs.<br>  <br>  I hope that you have learned your lesson about hard drives that they DO fail.  You really need to invest in an external hard drive that you can connect to the MacBook to and do periodic back-ups of your internal hard drive.

t7sUZQvFaa	How to kill viruses for free with no strings attached?<br>  There's a myth going around that if you play on the internet you have to pay for expensive security programs! This is simply not true! There's three really good programs that are free to the public with no strings attached! Use these programs together and they make up the perfect security system that rivals any paid program! They don't slow your computer down like other programs.<br>  The first is M-bam "Malwarebytes"It's an on demand scanner with a really cool tool called file assassin.You can use this tool to delete rogue programs that freeze up your computer and keeps you from downloading and using security programs!<br>  The second is "Superantispyware" It's another on demand scanner that catches what M-bam misses!<br>  Third is "Avira" It's an on demand scanner and firewall "although they call it AntiVirGuard" I use this as my primary security.I have it setup to do updates and scans at night when I'm sleeping so when I go on my computer in the morning it's there waiting for me to review all the bugs I caught the day before! "Note"Until you get your computer clean I would disable the AntiVirGuard It's a little sensitive and can drive you crazy with popups saying your computer is infected.<br>  I found a very good video by Matt Rizos that explains the whole prosess in detail so get out the popcorn and watch this video!<br>  Video:<a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Ah3efRdWes&feature=channel_page" rel="nofollow">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Ah3efRdW...</a><br>  Downloads:<br>  1.<a href="http://www.download.com/Malwarebytes-Anti-Malware/3000-8022_4-10804572.html?part=dl-10804572&subj=dl&tag=button" rel="nofollow">http://www.download.com/Malwarebytes-Ant...</a><br>  2.<a href="http://www.superantispyware.com/superantispywarefreevspro.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.superantispyware.com/superant...</a><br>  3.<a href="http://www.download.com/Avira-AntiVir-Personal-Free-Antivirus/3000-2239_4-10322935.html?part=dl-10322935&subj=dl&tag=button&cdlPid=10986298" rel="nofollow">http://www.download.com/Avira-AntiVir-Pe...</a><br>  <br>  I set up a couple of blogs to help people like yourself deal with viruses and other problems associated with them!

c5Ofpxx0aa	did you make sure the email was right, try using another account with an easier name, if not, I'm not too sure...
AA10519043	No. The number of files you have does not increase your risk of getting a virus. You have to "catch" a virus. Downloading contaminated files, putting an unknown disk into your drive, using someone's flash drive... all these things increase your risk of exposure. But having a lot of files on your drive in no way increases the risk that they will turn bad. Where did you get these files from originally? Were they previously scanned through your anti-virus software?  Did you ever double click them?<br>  <br>  Also, the number of files does not increase the risk someone will break into your system to hack your computer.  Unless of course they are valuable files that someone would like to steal. People break into unsecured systems with no fire wall, no security, etc. A lot of files does not make it easier or harder for someone to break in.
AA10403945	Before doing anything, get a case for it! Really, it can get pretty messy even if you are careful. It's really cheap, unless you want to get an Apple approved case.<br>  <br>  When CD is inserted and is running, ALWAYS keep the Mac base horizontal. You don't want to damage or hear scary noises when you tilt it.<br>  <br>  Make sure that you use the TouchPad only when necessary. Otherwise, it could either get a smooth patch on it (really ugly) or your button may wear of easily.<br>  <br>  Once in a while, goto Disk Utility and Check your drive for repairs and run all the maintenance scripts.<br>  <br>  If you want your Mac to be completely secure then boot from the Mac OS Installation CD and set a "Firmware Password". In that case nobody can gain control of your system through other OS except you.<br>  <br>  Try not to discharge fully and recharge again unless necessary because doing so could shorten your battery life.<br>  <br>  Thats all I can think of for now. Enjoy exploring...|`|AA12319761	good choice in getting a mac! they are amazing.<br>  well first offi would get an external hard drive just to back up all your files, it is very easy to use with the time machine application. <br>  <br>  Oh never place it on carpets or a bed for a long period of time becasue it restricts airflow and the computer can overheat.<br>  <br>  Alot of mac users dont know about keychain. check it out. if u hit command space it brings up spotlight, which searches your entire computer.<br>  this application stores personal information and does it very securely. <br>  <br>  Oh and dont let your computer die before you recharge it it hurts the battery.<br>  <br>  i hope you enjoy your new computer!|`|HE23qtamaa	Mac are the best! <br>  <br>  I would say just spend some time learning about the features (the apple website has lots of information about the operating system features which are useful to know). I would also set up time machine, which is the best feature! It will automatically back-up you're entire computer as often as you want so if something happens (which doesn't often happen, but you never know), you can restore everything to the last back-up - all your settings, files, etc... it's like nothing ever happened! You may need an external drive for this, but they're not expensive and it's well worth it.<br>  <br>  Otherwise, there's nothing you can't do that you could do on any other computer, and there's nothing specifically that you shouldn't do.

AA11464625	Looks to me like your video drivers are not working. If I was to bad mouth Ubuntu and Linux it would be the pain in the behind to get the video drivers to work in that operating system. What makes it worse is, good Linux users have a very hard time talking down to us Linux Laymen. Their hind site for us that struggle is not good and that is what ultimately makes Linux so hard of a learning curve. Go to the Ubuntu web site and check into video drivers. My guess is you will need to access the terminal to get these drivers to work right. You will not believe the hoops I had to jump through to finely get mine to work. There is also this third party program you can download that helps as well with the video driver installation.

DjGEJfaPaa	There are several things you can do to increase the "speed" of your computer. <br>  <br>  1) Clean up the disk. Uninstall unneeded programs (specifically those that run at startup and/or put something in the system tray), run Disk Cleanup, and defragment the drive. This is a good first step that will almost always take a few seconds off boot time and application loads for any computer.<br>  <br>  2) Stomp auto-starting programs. Click Start > Run and type "msconfig" at the prompt. Click the Startup tab and look at all that junk that loads when you launch your PC. Do you really need "Adobe Reader Speed Launch"? Probably not. Turn off anything else that looks useless, but be careful not to disable your anti-virus and important system components.<br>  <br>  3) Run a full anti-virus and anti-spyware scan. I would recommend AVG Free anti-virus, Malwarebytes and SUPERAntiSpyware remover. These programs are all free.<br>  <br>  4) Clean up the registry. CCleaner, available at <a href="http://www.ccleaner.com" rel="nofollow">http://www.ccleaner.com</a> is free and worth running. It will also remove unused files from your system - allowing Windows to run faster and freeing up valuable hard disk space. <br>  <br>  Those are the easy and free things you can do. If your computer is still slow you need to move on to the bigger guns.<br>  <br>  1) Upgrade RAM. This is the one killer trick that will make almost any computer run faster. With an older PC, you will rarely have enough RAM to run today's memory-hogging operating systems and applications, and adding a high-capacity stick or two of quality RAM will give you a quick speed boost. Adding RAM is fairly simple, even for a novice, and you should be able to do the job in 5 or 10 minutes.You can run a free test at <a href="http://www.crucial.com" rel="nofollow">http://www.crucial.com</a> and find out what kind of RAM (memory) your computer needs.<br>  <br>  2) Reinstall Windows. If the above tricks haven't helped, it may be time to wipe the slate clean and start again, reformatting your hard drive, reinstalling your applications, and restoring your data files from a backup. You'd be surprised how much more responsive a freshly reinstalled Windows system can be, as you've wiped out years of temp files, garbled registry entries, old versions of software programs that have been upgraded repeatedly, and all sorts of other electronic junk. Reinstalling is easy if you have the "recovery disk" that came with your PC, and only a bit more involved if you're using a retail copy of Windows XP. Just be sure you back up everything you want to take with you before you pull the trigger! <br>  <br>  3) Upgrade your hard drive. This is a more complicated solution, but if you're reinstalling Windows (per the prior tip) you might consider upgrading to a bigger and possibly faster hard drive, too. Hard disk storage is a performance bottleneck on every machine, and magnetic disks degrade over time. Some performance issues could be caused by a failing hard drive, even, and upgrading to a new model could really put some zip back in your system. As a bonus, you can use the original hard drive for backups or occasional storage, if you put it in an enclosure.|`|cwJrCcguaa	RAM is very cheap nowadays why not just buy it.<br>  www.crucial.com|`|uzepqbXIaa	to make it faster wont mean deleting files to make more storage space on hard drive.<br>  <br>  try disabling all the programs you dont use.  when the thing starts up it loads all these programs that you dont want... as you will open them when you wanna use them.<br>  <br>  go to start button, click on 'run', type in 'msconfig'.  this opens a list of everything your compter does as it starts up, on the 'startup' tab, disable everything you dont want to start automatically. <br>  <br>  This is handy because nothing is deleted and it is completely reversible.

AA11579822	1. What is the difference between CAT-5, CAT-5e, CAT-6, CAT-7...<br>  <br>  The Simple Answer:<br>  CAT-5 is rated to 100M<br>  CAT-5e is rated to 350M<br>  CAT-6 and CAT6e is rated to 550M or 1000M depending on your source<br>  CAT-7 is supposedly rated to 700M or presumably 1000M<br>  <br>  Today there is no approved CAT-6 or CAT-7. While some folks are selling products they call Level 6 or 7, there aren't even specs for them, making CAT-5e the best available option. CAT-6 cable is being made with 23 guage conductor wire as opposed to the slightly smaller 24 guage for CAT-5e and also has a separator to handle crosstalk better.|`|tOx475R0aa	They are compatible it is just that cat6 is better.

AA10162294	You probably should get a laptop, as you will probably be writing essays and be doing research as well as taking notes. If you aren't doing any gaming, the laptop doesn't need to be powerful. An Eee PC has a very small screen (10 inches) compared to normal laptops and is extremely easy to carry around (under 3 pounds).|`|CGJdITxzaa	They are highly important some of your classes will be on laptops and you can also work on the go make sure you get one with a good battery some RAM and at least 4 gb hard-drive or more HP laptops are good for educated purpose or if you was all-out and get a badass computer for fun and school get a Alienware Laptop they range from $1500-$3000 but you are allowed to customize in sections like how much memory you want and stuff or like a blu-ray player or graphic card (If you fully customize it to the MAX it will be $12,500 Good luck|`|HE23qtamaa	I think the laptop thing is a double-edged sword. Think about where you're going to be using your computer most - if you're mostly going to use it at your desk at home then get a desktop because they're more comfortable to work with and for the price you can get a bigger screen and better computer system.<br>  <br>  However, I found my laptop very useful in college because I lived on campus and was always going from class to my room to the library and needed to have my computer with me to do work. PLUS, I could bring my work home with me easily when I went home for the weekend. So, in that sense, the laptop was a great buy and I used it to death (literally). It had many great features, like the notebook in word could record my lectures as I typed so I would never miss any important information (this was on a mac but I think the PC version has something similar?). Plus it had bluetooth so I could easily share files with my friends' laptops when we were working on something together at the library. But, after a few hours of sitting in front of it, I would get back pain because I was looking down at the screen and typing on a smaller keyboard.<br>  <br>  As far as it being powerful - no it really doesn't need to be. Mostly you'll be using the office suite applications and the internet, neither of which needs high end graphic capabilities or anything like that. I would opt for lightness over power because it makes it easier to take around with you, which is really the benefit of the laptop. If you're not taking it around, it's not worth it.|`|52fJFEcBaa	For me laptops are essential for college, it's because it entails me a lot of things to do especially on researching and making thesis papers which would likely be found in majors such as biology, chemistry, and nursing . It's also  a helpful tool in studying for exams or simply reviewing on your notes.

Electricity moves up to the speed of light.  This electricity flies through the chips, and depending on the processor, it can make 64-256 decisions at a time.  The issue comes in that most operations can take millions or billions of decisions (maybe millions of billions) and this takes time.  <br>  <br>  When you look at the clockspeed of your processor, that will tell you how many times a second your computer can do those 64-256 operations.  (OK, I'm simplifying, but still...)  So, a 3.0 MHz processor, with 2 cores, running in 64 bit mode will do roughly, 384,000,000 operations a second.

I reccommend Recuva (pronounced "recover"), it is a freeware Windows utility to restore files that have been accidentally deleted from your computer.

It will even bring back files that have been deleted by bugs, crashes and viruses!|`|KFVaZSfqaa	You can restore those files but you must act quickly.  The data is still there but it cannot be located internally because it exists at such a low level on your hard drive.

TFl5JgV0aa	If your looking to do something on the side, I've been building websites for the last year and have found some awesome training programs over that time. When I started (I had no clue about building a website...much less how to market it) I bought a really good program (or information, however you want to look at it) from Stores Online that teaches how to set up a store if you do not know how to write html. It is great info if you study and apply it (I have) and will surely get you in the know about internet marketing and what not, but it is really expensive. I paid $6000 for 6 site. I have 3 built in one year. Anyway, there is an AWESOME new course that teaches you everything Stores Online teaches, and more. But it is priced at only $500 which is very feasible if you are looking to start your own. The course is called Niche Blueprint (just google it). Good Luck!

1ALywdM7aa	We'll try google and type your mother board make and model specs or drivers for motherboard 143.gkl whatever example. It should say what the make and driver you need for your network adapter. If you know what your doing check the device drivers and see if the drivers are loaded but not working correctly or if not loaded at all. Another way is to look on your motherboard for the network chip and look for a company name like 3com. Then go to there website and look for drivers. The chip should have some numbers or something so you can determine what make and model it is. If not  let me know.

f0IlPkkTaa	open your volume control setting make sure everything is ok and check you speakers|`|dUsnks9Zaa	Ok so the first thing to check is whether your audio driver is actually working. Do you get any sound at all? This might be due to the wrong configuration of your driver or incompatibility with the os/ service pack that you have. I would suggest that you uninstall and install the audio driver again. Be careful not to download any spyware or malware while doing so. <br>  <br>  Also, check whether the Master Volume is not set to mute all. You can make sure that it works by selecting your audio options in the control panel. Now that you have checked this, ensure that the speaker are properly plugged in and that they are on... I know this might seem stupid but it does happen sometimes when the focus is turned to a deeper issue with the computer. <br>  <br>  Good luck|`|ztxkW7WKaa	u should try to do a windows update because sometimes it needs a driver update.

um8UD9Lfaa	Doesn't matter who certifies it as this or that as long as the makes of the Mobo lists the motherboard as SLI capable. That simply means it the nessasary stuff to make it work. Generally if it has to PCI-E 16x slots its going to be SLI capable. Theres lots of SLI capable motherboards that won't be listed on NVidia's site or ATI's site. Like all companies they make deals with specific manufactuers to promote that companies stuff as long as they use its Chipset while theres 20 other companies who use teh same chipset and make a good enough product also, sometimes even better.<br>  <br>  My suggestion maybe think of a Asus ;)

nqbcJjHyaa	It's a bit old but if it is in good shape, it'll be fine. The one you say is almost identical to the one my wife uses daily and she has had no problems with it (web research, photo stuff, word processing). Check the condition of the battery and check the price on places like the used Mac dealers on lowendmac.com. There was a recall on some of the batteries maybe 4 or 5 years ago, Apple still has the list on its website. If the battery is old or not working well, skip the ones on eBay, more than 70% of them have been found to be frauds & knockoffs.|`|osqKrcG8aa	Way too old!  It does not even have an Intel processor which Apple started using quite a while ago.  You will have problems with getting applications as most mac apps are now for Intel almost exclusively.

IbxhRebgaa	AVI is not a media type; it's a container. <br>  <br>  Determine how the file was encoded and install the appropriate codec.<br>  <br>  If you can't figure out how it was encoded, or if it turns out to be some weird codec that you can't find, try VLC as a last resort.|`|WGXtFfWdaa	It depends on the video file and how it was encoded. Most of the time, Windows Media Player can't play AVI files downloaded from the net. If you want to play it, download VLC media player. It plays every file you have.|`|c3Q5Oxvfaa	Try using GOM player. It works well with AVI files, and it is a great media player.|`|AA11434633	It should work ... but, you haven't stated which codecs were used in the production of the video so the chances are you have a missing codecs problem.<br>  <br>  Others have indicated good programmes that would contain the relevant codecs but, if you must use Windows Media Player, you could download a codec pack (these are free), such as K-Lite codec pack.  This should then allow you to view your .avi files.  (There are other codec packs available on the same page ... all of which are free.  Look on the left hand side of the page.)|`|8yAQjqRpaa	sounds like a bad download

ff1e69f5b0fdca4411c73634e35831e6aa	Yes, you can get different usb adapters, some just wireless, and some with satelite or cell access, depending on how much money you would like to spend. With a normal wireless adapter you will only get access when you are in range of a wireless router, and with the cellular you can get it anywhere the provider has service, same with satellite for a monthly fee of course.
AA10162294	All of them have similar performance, but the Dell and HP are a little bit faster than the Toshiba (3gb vs 2gb of ram). Other than that, you won't see much difference between the three.|`|aS1YZF13aa	Personally, I have used HP and Toshiba and both have always done a real good job, no problems. I got rid of both of them for a Asus EEE PC 900HA and its extremely portable, does everything I need for a computer on the move. The price is great you can usually pick up at newegg for 300 bucks. No dvd drive, but they sell small portable ones for 60 bucks. Just thought Id offer another option for you depending on how portable you need, but out of those 3 I would probably take the HP.

Set it to at least something that you can remember just in case. <br>  <br>  The go to Start, Run and type "control userpasswords2" without the quotes and hit run/press enter. This brings up a hidden window. At the top of it untick the box for "require users to enter a username and password on this computer", then hit OK, then it asks you for your username and password that windows will use to auto-logon with. <br>  <br>  Then you have a password but don't have to enter it. If someone were to try to connect remotely to your PC, they would have full control in about 2 seconds if there's no password. <br>  <br>  You might also want to right click on the desktop, go to properties, screen saver and untick the require password on resume box, so you dont have to enter it again after your screen saver has been on<br>  <br>  Finally, in case you DO want to hide or lock your screen, all you have to do is press the Windows key (the one with the windows logo on it) and L at the same time, to lock the workstation.

It features and awesome chiclet style keyboard and the best battery life in the netbook class. The new Dell Mini 10 looks nice buts it's battery isn't as good as the ASUS and it might be a tad more expensive. I hope this info helps!|`|I7EBpvenaa	HP 1001 TU not bad, small and cool.

QdTd6Preaa	There is no update to 64bit.  You would have to buy the OS.  Although if you do it is possible that some of the hardware on your machine will not have the proper drivers.  Wireless adapters especially are notorious for not supporting 64bit OS.   Although unless you have significantly more than 4gb of RAM it is of little benefit.  A 32bit OS will recognize about 3.5gb of RAM.  So again unless you have significantly more you are simply asking for problems with little added improvement in operating speeds.|`|PSVy9ZCpaa	Yep, you get to buy windows again, this time in 64 bit.<br>  <br>  Can you say Thank You Bill.

Phishing - when you enter your login credentials to a fake site. It could also be that you have a virus on your computer that records your keystrokes and "phoned home". I would recommend running your virus scanner for sure. Be sure that it's up to date first with the latest definitions. I would also recommend hardening up your firewall to be sure that anything that comes in or goes out, you have to  "allow" or "deny". <br>  It may be early enough too that you get credit monitoring and protection. <br>  I hope this helps!

mk97TUWuaa	sorry idk?|`|peFufWeYaa	This happens because either your computer or video card is not powerful enough to run that version of Media Player. You can try and use the next lowest Media Player, like if using ver 11 go to 10, or if using 10 go to ver 9. <br>  <br>  Windows Media Player is not a real good program, quite frankly. Like ITunes, if is far too system hungry.  A far better "all in one" media browser would be Winamp or RealPlayer, seriously.<br>  <br>  But to make better use of your system requirements, it is best to have a lighter video player like Media Player Classic or VLC and use that. These will play music also, they just won't be flashy about it. For music you can choose another program just for that which has all the bells and whistles you want, there are many good ones available. Windows Media Player is really kind of like a dinosaur|`|WGXtFfWdaa	It may be a glitch with your video card and you may not be able to do anything about it.

AA10162294	32-bit - about 3.5gb, depending on the hardware you have (e.g. if your graphics card has lots of memory, less would be available)<br>  <br>  64-bit - 128gb  :) (on vista)|`|AA11464625	The first answerer is right but there is another thing you need to know. I had just read an article out of a known reliable computer magazine that many mother board company's are making clams that their motherboards can access RAM that the board has not even been tested for yet. I guess this goes on a lot from motherboard company to motherboard company. For example: How can they make make clams for 8 gig sticks ie 32 gigs of RAM in 4 slots, when there are no 8 gigs sticks just yet? What they are doing is banking on a BIOS update to see the new sticks they have not tested. That is not a good thing as there is no guarantee your motherboard will work with the new RAM. Thought you might want to know.|`|LeBp1gBcaa	A 32-bit system can address 4 GB of memory. A 64-bit system can address 16 Exabytes (16 billion GB) of memory. At this point, it's more about hardware limits and price than software limits.|`|3VUQuH2vaa	32bit -  (2 to the power of 32)  4GB however it's really around 3.3gb<br>  64bit -  (2 to the power of 64) 16 exabytes or 17.2 billion gigabytes. (theoretically)<br>   <br>  However Operating Systems will not recognize this much for example Vista Home Premium only recognizes 16GB, Home Basic 8GB and Ultimate 128GB. At this time motherboards also only support a limited amount such as 8GB, 16GB or 32GB.|`|cf409E5aaa	Depends on if you are Vista, XP, etc.<br>  <br>  XP 32- 3.5gb<br>  XP 64- 4gb<br>  <br>  Vista 32 Basic- 4gb<br>  Vista 64 Basic- 8gb<br>  Vista32 Premium- 4gb<br>  Vista 64 Premium- 16gb<br>  Vista Ultimate (64)- 128gb
eqqZDSItaa	First, what brand and model computer are you using.  Each brand has a different key that you need to hit during boot to choose where you want to boot from.<br>  <br>  You should never install an operating system on top of another one.  You can either partition your hard drive, and install Windows 95 on that partition, or put your original XP install disk in the drive, boot from the CD, and choose to format the hard drive before installing the OS.<br>  <br>  Or you can install Linux on a USB drive, boot from that, and format your hard drive.<br>  <br>  The best option, though, is to install a second hard drive into your computer.  You can install a completely different OS onto the second drive, boot from the second HDD, copy the files that you need from original drive, and then install XP back onto that drive.  Or just use the original drive as a backup, or another place to store stuff.|`|6OzEsanAaa	that doesnt make sense what so ever<br>  you want to put windows 95 over xp? <br>  thats not how you reformat your hard drive<br>  rofl<br>  all you do is reinstall xp and it wil ask if you want to reformat your hard drive duur|`|2KhB3FrCaa	Boot your computer from the OS disk and when it asks if you want to repair or install windows chose install windows. It will then ask you where you want to install it and you can delete old partitions (where you broken OS is) and replace it with your new OS. This will delete all your data on your computer though (unless you have your data on a separate partition)

HBAMQJPLaa	Too bad you bought from Best Buy as their "technicians" are not too smart.  <br>  <br>  If you had bought directly from Dell they would send a competent technician to fix or replace your laptop.|`|YTy08bnraa	well it definelty crashed. it got the B.S.O.D. (blue screen of death)<br>  if you have a warrenty on it, it should be fixed cheap or free<br>  if you can, and u are willing to delete everything u have, uninstall windows xp or vista (whatever u r using) and reinstall it using the disk. if  you dont have the disk, you will have to re-buy it.<br>  before you try though, make sure you get directions on how to do that. like a tutorial vid or some1 who knows how to do it perfectly, or else you could screw up your laptop if you mess up. just get som1 or look up how to do it.
SJM0rzHtaa	Try that Dell monitor on another computer and see if that problem also occurs.  If it does, there is something wrong with the monitor.<br>  <br>  If that Dell monitor works fine with another computer, the issue is with your 8600GT.<br>  <br>  BTW, you should also try both DVI and VGA.  Sometimes a monitor works better with one particular type of connection.

FBQZ06vraa	Centering text and using a center-aligned tab are two different, but similar, things.  Centering text is what you've probably done, since you say you said you "center align" it.  Using a center-aligned tab causes such alignment automatically.<br>  <br>  There are several types of tabs possible on the ruler.  The most common one is the left-aligned tab, but two others are the right-aligned tab and the center-aligned tab.  Text entered after a tab character that pushes into a center-aligned tab position is automatically centered around the tab position.<br>  <br>  Here's how to get the center-aligned tab.  <br>  <br>  1. Right-click in the line you want the center-aligned tab to go and click Paragraph.<br>  2. Click the Tabs button at the bottom of the Paragraph dialog box.<br>  3. In the Tab stop position box, put the distance from the left margin at which you want the centered-tab stop to go.<br>  4. Under Alignment, click the Center radio button.<br>  5. Click the Set button.<br>  6. Click the OK button.<br>  <br>  You'll now have a center-aligned tab on the ruler for that paragraph.   To use it, press the Tab key just before the text you want centered at that point.<br>  <br>  Hope that helps.

Sometimes if you are lucky, they may not have the macbook you specified in stock and will give you an upgraded one ;)<br>  <br>  It will last you as long as a brand new macbook, but with a good discount!<br>  <br>  I say go for it|`|LeBp1gBcaa	The refurbished ones are basically models that people buy and then return or ones that have slight defects that are fixed and then resold. They put them through all the same tests that the new ones go through, they have the same one-year warranty, and you can get the same 3-year AppleCare protection (which I would strongly recommend you do, even for a new one). It's basically the same as buying a new one, except it has the word "refurbished" next to it.|`|nv6hxvO1aa	You can also find some cheap MacBooks on eBay. <br>  A good site that only lists MacBooks on eBay is macbookwatch.com<br>  Just be sure to have good communication with the seller. Buying a refurbished MacBook is also a good investment. The laptop is brought up to Apple's standards if there is a defect. Sometimes though there was nothing wrong with it to begin with but Apple can't sell the MacBook as new. Good luck

You can also try Google's new Chrome browser. It is also a fast browser. You can download it from the below link|`|qWSfV7vNaa	Once I got my Laptop, I deleted Internet explorer and downloaded Google Chrome. It is the best!! try it.|`|jPwbOFnAaa	I like firefox|`|aS1YZF13aa	Personally I use Firefox, in my opinion, it just seems to load websites faster, there are scripts you can download to customize it how you want, and my favorite is one called no script which you can allow and block pages. Since I installed NoScript I have NOT had one spyware/adware/malware infection, using that along with a virus checker/defender like Avast. Hope this helps.|`|7k8Oc4v0aa	Firefox 3.1 is best. You can also try Google's Chrome.|`|901930fc8f0cb1ce4a9483207715497baa	They all have something that the other doesn't have, best to always have two browser installed. That's how I have it on my computer.|`|4d3Ie5lCaa	There is also Chrome, Opera, Flock and many others.<br>  <br>  <br>  First of all: Any browser is better than Internet Explorer, it's just more popular because it comes installed when you buy Windows, I bet that if it didn't and you erased people's mind, they wouldn't pick IE.<br>  <br>  Okay now let's talk about the good ones, I don't use safari though.<br>  <br>  Chrome is fast, probably the fastest.<br>  Firefox has the most tools.<br>  <br>  The only way to find out which one is better is to try them all, pick the one you like the most, like I said, any is better than IE.

WGXtFfWdaa	The 54 mbps is the speed of your router. That means sending files to other computers connected to your router. 200 kbps is your ISP (Internet Service Provider) download speed. You will have to contact your ISP to find out if it's right or not. Generally, that's a decent speed that shouldn't lag on YouTube or online gaming.|`|7bf62358ee706efffb78c25a9c7d5a00aa	If you're paying for 200kbps, it's good.  If you're paying for more speed, call Qwest tech support and ask them to look into it.<br>  <br>  Use <a href="http://www.speedtest.net/" rel="nofollow">http://www.speedtest.net/</a> for accuracy (use the server they recommend - it may not be closest to you, but it's closest to where your section of Quest's internet service connects to the internet).|`|6b20b31ca0cc72763d8a38403afd5bcbaa	The 54megabit is for your local connection. Between the router and your computers. The speed you test online is the wide area network. The online sites measure kilobits not kilobytes so you are getting around 25 kilobytes a second. (kilobytes = kilobits divided by 8)  If its this slow I would call quest, something is wrong.|`|IbxhRebgaa	The 54Mbps is the speed of your network adapter. It's not the speed of your connection. <br>  <br>  200Kbps is a bit faster than ISDN. Generally, ISDN communicates at 128Kbps. <br>  <br>  In terms of downstream, your connection is on the low end of the DSL spectrum<br>  <br>  In terms of upstream, however, your connection is very average for DSL. Not great, but not bad at all. <br>  <br>  It's interesting that your downstream and upstream are the same. SDSL is not very common.<br>  <br>  If your downstream is 200Kbps, you will probably have to do a bit of waiting before you can play any Youtube videos. You'll have to open up the page with the video on it, pause it, and let it load for a few minutes before you can watch it. <br>  <br>  Note, however, that if you made a typographical error, and you meant to write 200KBps, then you will have no problems watching Youtube videos without any lag. 1KB = 8Kb|`|2fP5QhXQaa	very good
IbxhRebgaa	Heh, I certainly didn't tell you that.<br>  <br>  As I said, 200Kbps is very slow for DSL. You will have a difficult time loading Youtube videos. It's only marginally faster than ISDN. <br>  <br>  Your computer itself meets all the requirements; you just need a better Internet connection.<br>  <br>  Is that the speed that you pay for? Or are you being charged for a higher speed? If you pay for a faster speed than that, then you have every right to complain to QWest about it. They may be able to find what's wrong and fix it on their end.<br>  <br>  EDIT: The guy who said `very good` on your last question was being sarcastic. I don't know if he made that clear or not, so I just thought I should point that out, since the fact of the matter is that it's nowhere near `very good`.

XmnVJxzaaa	It sounds like you are trying to use a SD High-Capacity (SDHC) card in a non-SDHC card reader. The SD memory card format reached a storage limit of 4 GB about two years ago. The association that oversees the SD format came up with a new standard, SDHC, to address this limitation.<br>  SDHC cards are physically the same size, but electrically incompatible with older SD card slots. Electrically incompatible means the internal components are not compatible with older card readers. The specific reason for the incompatibility is due to a redesigned memory control chip in SDHC cards. <br>  While a new SDHC card reader will read both SD and SDHC cards, older card readers will not work with SDHC cards. All you need to do to see if this is your issue is check the packaging of both the card and the memory card reader, or find the specifications online. If the card says SDHC and the card readers doesn't, problem solved.<br>  I hope this helps. If you need more information, please add more details to this question, or email me through my Yahoo! Answers profile.<br>  Good luck.

(They'd never survive the lawsuits and federal actions - it's so illegal that there are visions of a Naval base on the south coast of Cuba associated with it.)<br>  <br>  2) Reset the router (hold the reset button in for 30 seconds) and set it up again.  If someone got into it, that would fix it.

There are tons of web site development tutorials and information out there on the web you can learn. But if you are not too savy with web technology, it may be quite a learning curve for you. However, if cost is not against you, there are also many tools out there to help you cut short your website creation effort. Google this search term "xsitepro" and you should find a very powerful web site design software called XsitePro 2. I highly recommend it! It is primarily a template driven web site development tool. You choose one nice template and many of the things are available for easy customization including online payment.<br>  <br>  To accept donation online, for a start, I would recommend that you go with Paypal Donations (just google "paypal donations" and you should find it). Sign up for a paypal account and then integrate it with Xsitepro.<br>  <br>  As for hosting, you can find expensive ones and also cheap ones (as cheap as 1USD per month). It all depend on your needs and budget. To accept online payment, it is always a good practice to secure your site with SSL. SSL is additional cost on top of your hosting. There are hosting providers who bundle SSL together with hosting as well.<br>  <br>  I would suggest you go with simplicity for a start...paypal donations itself is already a secure payment mode, so you are OK to go without SSL.

J6AAbZbHaa	I'd get (and have now) the Q6600<br>  <br>  Dual cores are technically faster at the same speed for some things i.e things that only use one core anyway won't make much difference, it's just that when you run lots at the same time, quad core can handle many more threads. <br>  <br>  Think like motorways.... dual core is two lanes on each side...speed limit is the 3.0 ghz or whatever. IF you go to quad core, you get four lanes on each side, but the speed is still about the same, it can just get more cars along at the same time. <br>  <br>  certainly dont bother spending 300 more on the 9550, you can still get awesome performance out of the Q6600 with a decent motherboard and some thought out cooling. With only air cooling they can get up to 3.6 or whatever it is (ine's got a crab mobo for now so is still stock) The cache makes a bit of difference but $300 worth? Noooo<br>  <br>  As I said, go for the Q6600, it's about the best out there now and teamed up with a good motherboard and video card it will play Crysis or anything else you throw at it, while burning CDs with Nero and listening to itunes in the background as well without too much trouble.

I still have a Nvidia RIVA 128 with 4 MB laid out in 4 1 MB chips. <br>  <br>  As to which is better, this is a which do you prefer apples or oranges type of question.

vBKNsWlZaa	The reason the computer gets slow is due to the registry files becoming corrupted, or messed up, in simple terms. These files tell the computer or laptop how to operate the software installed on the system. If any of these files get messed up, the computer is not sure what to do and this will really slow down the computer. The other scenario is where you download other software, screensavers, pictures, videos, or even music, and this will somehow change the settings on a registry file. When this happens, the original program that needs that file now has the wrong instructions in it. So, it will cause the computer to run slow, or in a worse case, crash.<br>  <br>  You can speed up your computer with a thorough analysis and repair of your registry.

Would really need more of a log but a similiar error trojan is a DNS trojan thats very nasty and hijacks your DNS.<br>  <br>  If neither of these methods work or you can't access your HD or computer no worries. The harddrive will still recognize in the CMos... hense the harddrive is still good as hardware,,, what to do at this time it a complete wipe. Repartion the harddrive and do a full format. You can always try looking up the Trojan on the net to find other possible answers but unless your skilled with registry edits and similiar things you shouldn't do that. Best to just do a wipe and use in the future a solid AV and Malware/spyware program.

In  firefox go to the Tools menu, go to Options then select advanced button (cogwheel)  then select the network tab and click settings. check manual proxy Enter the IP and Port eg 123.123.0.1 at port 8080 (only example) and select use proxy for all protocols. Be careful while using a proxy as entering a password will go through the proxy server and can be intercepted from there on your way to you. Check if the proxy works by going to www.ip-adress.com and check if the address there is the entered IP. cheers

If it says it cannot do it, do you want to do it on next boot, hit yes. <br>  <br>  Next do the same after the reboot, Start, run, CMD, enter. Then you want to type in sfc /scannow and hit enter again. You might need the windows CD but not always. Again, leave it to run. Each of these takes about 20 mins to run so leave it go and you might have the error sorted once all done. <br>  <br>  Also try the microsoft site with that error code to see if it gives you anything

6Djqii7Xaa	If the power was out for at least a few minutes, the router probably had time to reset itself. You might try the old "power it off then power it back on" routing. Especially since your modem is back online now. Sometimes there is a timing issue between the two, and powering them on one at at time starting with the modem is best.<br>  <br>  If that didn't work, you could try using the factor reset button on the linksys. This is a tiny button on the back of the unit that you usually have to use a pen or bent paper clip to get to. Push the button in for at least 10 seconds, and it should reset the router back to its factory settings. If the router does not come alive and allow you connect at that point, then your router is probably fried.<br>  <br>  You might try using an ethernet cable to see if that works. If it does, then open up the management for the linksys and see of the wireless is disabled. If it is, then enable it. If it is already enabled, then again, your router may have gotten fried with a power surge from either the power going off or coming back on.|`|JdRcgAgvaa	try restarting|`|MZ1DRSflaa	Connect [wired] Modem to Router [wireless] to PCs. <br>  =<br>  Set router POWER OFF.<br>  -<br>  Reset modem: With a straightened paperclip, press RESET button momentarily.<br>  -<br>  Wait 60 secs.<br>  -<br>  Set router POWER ON.<br>  -<br>  Reset router: With a straightened paperclip, press RESET button momentarily.<br>  -<br>  Wait 60 secs.<br>  -<br>  PC Command Line:<br>  -<br>  Click [Start] - Click [Run...] - enter: cmd, Click [OK]<br>  -<br>  At the prompt (c:\.....>) enter: ipconfig /release, press [ENTER]<br>  -<br>  At the prompt (c:\.....>) enter: ipconfig /renew, press [ENTER]<br>  -<br>  TEST: Connect to Internet.<br>  -<br>  If SUCCESS:  Repeat Steps after PC Command Line on other PCs.<br>  -<br>  If NO SUCCESS:<br>  -<br>  At the prompt (c:\.....>) enter: ipconfig /all, press [ENTER]<br>  -<br>  Ensure DHCP Enabled == YES<br>  -<br>  If IP Address == 0.0.0.0 OR 169.254.0.0 to 169.254.255.255, connect [wired] Modem to router to [wired] PCs and perform ALL steps again.<br>  -

ihoBYdE8aa	Well, the simplest way to make the files compatible with Itunes is to download a file converting program. Since Itunes works mainly with mp3 type files, just look up "Convert files into mp3" on Google and you can find a bunch of free programs for this. This way, you don't have to change any settings in Itunes. Hope this helped.|`|lUhuGyOAaa	ok go 2 your windows media player and the songs should be there that you have and then hook up your ipod and go 2 sync and drag the songs u wants into the box on the right side annd the click the start sync button and there ya go

The trackers keep....track, duh! of who is currently sharing/seeding/leeching the file. When you ask for the file by opening the torrent, you ask the tracker for bits of the file which gradually builds up. <br>  <br>  This is part of the reason why raiding the Pirate Bay lead to nothing, because torrents aren't illegal, it's just the content that they represent that can often be copyrighted/illegal

uuDloQnCaa	You can protect a PC very effectively for free, you should always install a firewall and have anti-virus software installed and running before browsing the net, its also a good idea to scan the PC with additional anti-spyware software such as Malwarebytes once a week, all the security software you need is available completely free, these are often better then the paid for software such as Mcafee, below are links to excellent free software, download and use all 5 to fully protect your PC.<br>  <br>  Avast Home Edition: (anti-virus)<br>  <a href="http://www.avast.com/eng/avast_4_home.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.avast.com/eng/avast_4_home.ht...</a><br>  <br>  Comodo Pro: (firewall)<br>  <a href="http://www.personalfirewall.comodo.com/" rel="nofollow">http://www.personalfirewall.comodo.com/</a><br>  <br>  Malwarebytes: <br>  <a href="http://www.malwarebytes.org/mbam.php" rel="nofollow">http://www.malwarebytes.org/mbam.php</a><br>  <br>  Mozilla Firefox:<br>  <a href="http://www.mozilla.com" rel="nofollow">http://www.mozilla.com</a><br>  <br>  WOT (web of trust) Add-On:<br>  <a href="http://www.mywot.com/" rel="nofollow">http://www.mywot.com/</a><br>  <br>  Install the WOT add-on it is a free internet security add-on for your browser.

In order to successfully remove malware infections (viruses, spyware, adware etc) from your PC you need to follow a methodical approach as well as using effective (and free) tools.  There’s a decent guide covering this that you can work through at My Slow PC (<a href="http://www.MySlowPC.co.uk/)" rel="nofollow">http://www.MySlowPC.co.uk/)</a> – click on the “Troubleshooting” link.  Here’s my advice from it:<br>  <br>  1.) Turn System Restore OFF so any infection that you remove is not restored.<br>  <br>  2.) Scan with a combination of the best detection utilities as you’ll find different scanners can sometimes pick up different infections.  E.g.<br>  <br>     * McAfee Stinger – a free stand-alone utility used to detect and remove specific viruses.<br>     * SpyBot Search & Destroy – a spyware/adware scanner<br>     * Lavasoft Adaware – for spyware/adware<br>  <br>  Note – it might be a good idea to disconnect your network connection once you’ve updated them with the latest virus/spyware definitions.  This is due to the fact that often an infection is trying to spread over your network.<br>  <br>  3.) If the above fails or you’re not sure if you’re still infected, when you start your PC tap the F8 key, select “Safe Mode” and repeat the scans once you’re connected.<br>  <br>  I hope the above helps, as mentioned the guide above is a lot more detailed and the My Slow PC site is pretty useful.  Good luck!
LJZufrJ8aa	Scammed in what way?<br>  <br>  Anyways this kinda thing is usually a nightmare.

You're going to get a few cents from, perhaps, 1% of the visitors you get.  So if you get 100 visitors/day, you're making 5 cents/day at most.

However going from 1000 GHZ to 2000 GHZ isn't an overclock issue, yah don't simply double your speed on an OC, maybe boost 5%, 10%, 15% is feeling lucky over initial specs. My guess is likely its in conflict with your Mobo, maybe not supporting pci-e 2.0 or maybe your tester isn't telling properly because isn't designed with that vid card model in mind. <br>  <br>  Try some other test methods, theres ATI Tool, theres NTune, and theres a whole bunch of others. First suggestion is make sure its reading the same on a few diff testers, second go to the companies website and read the tech manual..... could also do that probably at ATI's site. 3rd ask for support from the maker of the card.

Since you are familiar with Movie Maker (assumption) then just use it to create the video and then convert it.  You can download free wma to mp4 converter software.  Just search for "converting wma to mp4" on google and you can select the one that you would like to use.
hy9fz99Xaa	you have to have the URL for the backgroung to add it. If you do have the URL copy it and paste it into your about me section, it should show up as your background.

r4ar5lekaa	I have Limewire 4.18.8 (last version before version 5.0.11 came out). I noticed that version 5.1.1 is out now. You can download 4.18.8 right on www.limewire.com. Even the main page has a "Get Limewire Classic" link, which refers to version 4.18.8. I downloaded 5.0.11 when it came out recently, and boy was I disappointed. haha. For one, it didn't stay on "dialup" when I changed the settings in the connection speed part of Limewire. It kept going back to DSL/Cable or something else. I never had that issue with 4.18.8 or any other versions. It also wouldn't connect totally, even after waiting awhile. And I didn't like how it doesn't have the "disconnect" feature like 4.18.8 does. It only has the option of closing the entire program, whereas with older versions you can disconnect but still leave the program open. <br>  <br>  I recently downloaded Frostwire at www.frostwire.com, since I read some good stuff about it, and how it has less viruses, etc. I don't know how true that is, but I figured it can't hurt to have both Limewire and Frostwire. It's similar to Limewire too, so if you're familiar with Limewire, it shouldn't be too hard to figure out. It also has more stuff to choose from when you set it up. Which was a bit confusing for me on a couple things, but not too bad.  <br>  <br>  And you're saying you pay for the pro version? I've read how people have downloaded the pro version of Limewire using the free version when they do a search for it. haha. I wouldn't recommend doing that, and at least when you're paying for it you know you're getting the real program, etc. So you deleted the pro version of Limewire 4, and want it back? Maybe I'm confused and I was thinking how you can download the free version of 4.18.8 easily, on their web site. I think a smart thing to do would be to contact Limewire through their web site, and tell them how you are paying for it and want to download the pro version of 4 again. Or maybe post on their message board and someone could help you w/ this more than I can. I don't even see a "contact" link on their site, but I'm sure you can at least get help by going on their message board. I hope this helps.|`|AFy5LyaGaa	Chose the latest version of 4.8 under this link..<br>  <a href="http://www.filehippo.com/download_limewire/" rel="nofollow">http://www.filehippo.com/download_limewi...</a>|`|E3N016csaa	Why do you use something that is full of viruses and infections.<br>  Why not just pay for it.

There are hundreds of tutorials on the web on how to create a website. You have to start from the basics. I recommend starting with a IDE (Interactive Development Environment) so you can like draw everything and drag-and-drop kinda stuff. I recommend Adobe Dreamweaver. It is really expensive but the trial version lasts like 30 days and that should be enough for you to get used to some elements of a webpage. After that, you should learn serious HTML coding. I recommend www.w3schools.com. After HTML, you can learn a web programming language like PHP, JavaScript, or ASP.NET. Also, you should learn CSS. Everything you need will be on that website.<br>  <br>  <br>  But, if you dont want to do these boring stuff, there are hundreds of website makers. Some are free!! Just search it up on google.

Visit their web sites to review them, and sign in if you want.<br>  <br>  Then perhaps download and use a free template from one of many templates web sites, then upload your site to your free host (use a free FTP program to upload your site - e.g. Core FPT Lite. Then you can optimize for search engines, directories, etc, if you want. <br>  <br>  I use the free host, Netfirms, but their are restrictions, e.g. bandwidth, file upload size, file space size, no direct links to flash sites, etc, but has worked ok for me. Many free hosts require their company name to be added to your URL as a sub domain, (e.g. my site.their sub domain.com) and you may have to add one of their ads (link or banner) to your site. <br>  <br>  You could start with a blog as well, e.g. try the Google’s blogger or the advanced Wordpress (which you can add plugins for enhancement), or use the simple Google Page Creator (soon to be changed to Google Sites - You need a Gmail account) - easy to set up for a beginner. <br>  <br>  There are free (and easy) web site building tools, such as Weebly (Using drag and drop), Snap Pages (Good for sharing photos), and Edicy Pages (Various templates/themes similar to Blogger and Wordpress).<br>  <br>  Later on though, it might pay to learn html/JavaScript/PHP etc, which allows more flexibility to design and modify your web site. Then maybe upgrade to a paid host and domain, which will possibly yield more features (scripting features, higher bandwidth, increased storage space, email accounts, etc) and more ownership of your site...

For malware objects this <br>  action is Disinfect. Delete if disinfection is not possible.<br>  <br>  When disinfecting or deleting an object, the application creates a backup copy in case the object needs to be restored, or an opportunity arises later to treat it.<br>  <br>  So if it's a virus you have no need to worry as they do it all for you and will not ask do you want to delete or quarantine.<br>  <br>  The only thing you have to do is when you see vulnerable<br>  items detected....this means that particular item needs<br>  updating to a newer version as its now insecure or maybe<br>  you are missing a microsoft update.....thats all you do.|`|t5sYXwSqaa	When detected it will ask if you want to delete it or quarantine it.

Generally speaking, unless you are a computer wiz and by the fact that you ask this question you are not, it will have to be repaired by Apple if it is still under warranty.

ELF5Y6IQaa	If you need the structure that Word affords you, and you need to incorporate some numbers from Excel, my suggestion is that you establish a link between the two. If you establish a link between Excel and Word, then anytime you update the Excel file, it will automaticlly update the Word file.<br>  <br>  In short: keep the word file as is. Open up an excel spreadsheet that you will use for your numbers. Keep a link between the two files, and then you can easily change your wording in the Word file with no hitches (you may think you won't ever need to change it, but most likely you will), and you can edit your numbers in Excel and it will automatically update the numbers in Word file.<br>  <br>  Do this as an example to understand what I'm saying:<br>  <br>  Create a word document (just something simple). Put a couple of paragraphs of information into it. Save it.<br>  <br>  Now create an excel document. Put a couple of rows/columns of data into it. Create your formulas, etc. Save the file.<br>  <br>  - Now open up both at the same time if they aren't both already open.<br>  <br>  - Go to Excel. Select all of the above numbers you just created (edit/copy)<br>  <br>  - Go to the word document. Go somewhere in between two paragraphs, or at the end of the last paragraph, wherever, doesn't matter. Then edit/paste. A box with "paste options" will appear to the bottom right hand corner of your new paste. Click the arrow and select "keep source formatting and link to excel." Now save your word file with this paste.<br>  <br>  Now go back to the area within excel that you just copied and change one of the numbers (if the "running ants" are still around the area you just selected and pasted, just press ESC on your keyboard, and this will make them go away). Look at word file. It automatically changes the number that you just changed.<br>  <br>  You can have as many different little sections on your Excel file for your calculations, so don't think that you can only have one. In fact, try it to see. Just create another section on your same excel spreadsheet and edit/copy/paste that section into another area of your word document to see the feature work.<br>  <br>  This is just my recommendation since your are using Word files and excel files. Otherwise, if you try to copy word into excel, you are basically embedding the file, and it won't work as easily and smoothly.<br>  <br>  NOTE: I did this using Word 2007/Excel 2007. You didn't state which version you have, so I'm making an assumption you're up to date. But if not, the procedure still works in Word 2003/Excel 2003 because Microsoft wrote the software programs so that the two are linkable.|`|h2nPm9bxaa	- open up excel<br>  - click file<br>  - click open<br>  - it will  default to look for .xls files only, but change it to all files<br>  - open up your txt file<br>  - excel will open up the text-to-columns wizard<br>  <br>  - the rest depends on how your file is setup<br>  - it will default to "fixed width" and you will see lines on where the columns are.<br>  - if it looks right go with it.  if not, then click "delimited" and choose how you want to slit the text to columns (usually click commas or spaces)<br>  <br>  edit-<br>  brayden is exactly right. you are starting in Word and trying to go to excel.  but you need to go the other direction to intergrate automatically.

I'd say that at least half the stuff you download has some type of malware.<br>  <br>  also, having limewire installed on your computer opens ports in your computer that put your computer at a higher risk of getting some malicious software.<br>  <br>  if you have a virus or a spyware, well you're basically giving people access to your computer so yes, people could access your computer because you used limewire.|`|gUXb103Maa	Limewire is a legitimate company and their software are all safe.

Pv4Z88wPaa	First<br>  <br>  Think of encryption as a lock and a key.  Once WEP (Wireless Encryption Protocol) is enabled on your router it is the lock.  Your computer once configured for WEP is the key.  Dont worry about the technical details just think of it as setting a passwod on your router that your PC knows.<br>  <br>  Find the instructions on how to log into your router.  Once you log in there should be a section that says security settings or something like that.  Choose WEP NOT WPA or Infrastructure.  Assign a 10 digit code for the WEP key.<br>  <br>  Now when you connect to your router with your pc for the first time after setting up the "password" your PC will ask you to type in the WEP key for the connection.  Just simply type in what you set up on the router.  Keep it easy like 10 a's o 10 j's so you wont forget it.<br>  <br>  thats all you need to do.  I realize logging into the router to set up the WEP key will be the most challenging but there shoud be step by step guides on the net if you search on google for "(your router name) setting up WEP".<br>  <br>  Good Luck|`|abc09a8025c84e0efb54f40a15d2f2e6aa	You need a wireless router. <br>  <br>  Now can't give you step by step instructions because every router's admin settings are different.<br>  <br>  Might have been able to help you if you told us what router you are using.|`|5LQVhoSSaa	all you need for it to be well connected is a good firewall, encryption isn't a necessity unless you looking for viruses to download and install.

There are many places that will pay for articles, but they have to be quality.<br>  <br>  * Learn to do graphics design and offer your graphics design services.<br>  <br>  * Learn to do web design and offer your web design services.<br>  <br>  * Create stuff online, like digital art, and sell it on Etsy.com<br>  <a href="http://etsy.com" rel="nofollow">http://etsy.com</a><br>  <br>  * A great site to learn about webstie stuff is <a href="http://webmasterworld.com" rel="nofollow">http://webmasterworld.com</a><br>  <br>  * If you need a new computer, or a good quality computer, I recommend (both for quality & price):<br>   NewSource Computers: <a href="http://newsourcecomputers.com" rel="nofollow">http://newsourcecomputers.com</a>|`|7ia9rfEHaa	I'm 13 too.

You are going to want to look at a few things in the laptop. First you are going to try and find a laptop with high memory (RAM). 3GB is about average for ram now a days. <br>  <br>  Then you will look at the storage capacity. This is your hard drive, and it will depend on how much stuff you will download to the laptop. This will be stuff like songs, movies, programs and files. 200GB is plenty for this. <br>  <br>  If you purchase a laptop that has a "solid state" hard drive your battery will last a lot longer. The reason for this is that solid state does not have a spinning disk inside like the regular hard drives have. These may not have as high of a storage capacity as the regular hard drives but if you want battery life this is a sacrifice you will want to make.<br>  <br>  Then you want to find out what processor it has. Processor is measured in ghz and the average processor is 2.16 ghz. It all depends on how much you are willing to spend. <br>  <br>  The higher all of the above numbers are the higher the amount of money you are going to spend. If you are looking for a certain name brand I would recommend sony, toshiba and HP. <br>  <br>  I hope this helped you. P.S. sony has bluray with their laptops so if you are going to be watching a lot of videos i would suggest the Sony.|`|mbnOUkALaa	First of all, it's one word, laptop.

But these torrent sites are also the a place for virus maker to distribute their malware.<br>    What you have is, I think, if it not a virus, might be a camouflage file. I used to use it when I was young to hide Nude and porno file under mp3 or other file. So basically it will show up as some file you would choose and with the software you can hid other files inside them. Like I said, some people like me used to hide porno pictures inside a mp3 files. And those hidden files won't show up in naked eyes but a virus scanner can always detects them. You can hide a secret document file in a picture file and nobody will know it.  <br>  Check those links <br>  <a href="http://camouflage.unfiction.com/" rel="nofollow">http://camouflage.unfiction.com/</a><br>  <a href="http://www.datamasking.com/" rel="nofollow">http://www.datamasking.com/</a><br>  These are just a few in the market. Those software never make it big because of files encryption technology got better and cheaper. Cheaper computer price might also plays a part, when I was I had to share my computers with my sibling and it is always a good idea to hide some files under some files. But now all of us got our own computer and it is always better to put a password on the computer.<br>  So, basically , most of the people that use those computer are malware maker and distributor.<br>    Usually they would be harmless but it is better to deleted those files. Beside if you look at the files name, you would see that it written teen_amatuer_pics, I guess they sex it up a bit just to make sure people open them. <br>  I hope this solve your curiosity

These files tell the computer or laptop how to operate the software installed on the system. If any of these files get messed up, the computer is not sure what to do and this will really slow down the computer. The other scenario is where you download other software, screensavers, pictures, videos, or even music, and this will somehow change the settings on a registry file. When this happens, the original program that needs that file now has the wrong instructions in it. So, it will cause the computer to run slow, or in a worse case, crash.<br>  <br>  You can speed up your computer with a thorough analysis and repair of your registry.

I4b0jfp8aa	First, don't use two firewalls - you're asking for trouble.  In fact, in Windows XP SP2 and SP3, the built-in Windows firewall is on by default.  Also, I think Windows Defender is an antispyware, not a firewall.<br>  <br>  I suggest uninstalling Trend Micro firewall and see if that fixes it.  If it does, just Comodo Internet Security - free and works better than Trend Micro.<br>  <br>  If it doesn't fix it, the problem is not the firewall but Java itself.  In Control Panel, Add/Remove programs are two entries. Java and Java Web Start - You need to uninstall both of them.<br>  <br>  If you still have problems, these may help:<br>  <a href="http://webct.ipfw.edu/troubleshooting/uninstalljava.shtml" rel="nofollow">http://webct.ipfw.edu/troubleshooting/un...</a><br>  <a href="http://www.tech-faq.com/uninstall-java.shtml" rel="nofollow">http://www.tech-faq.com/uninstall-java.s...</a> (long, but sure method)<br>  <br>  All the best!

KLt8LAoaaa	Unfortunately this is a rather serious problem that you won't be able to fix.  What most likely happened is that you pulled out your headphone plug too hard, put it in too hard, or you hit the plug on accident while it was plugged in.  This bent the unit that houses the headphone plug and severed the connection between the input lead and your motherboard, which in turn confuses the computer into thinking that your headphones must be plugged in order to play sound.<br>  The only way I know of to resolve this is to have someone resolder the headphone input to the motherboard.  It's something that you could do yourself if you had a soldering gun and a lot of computer know-how, but the average person would not want to try this themselves.
