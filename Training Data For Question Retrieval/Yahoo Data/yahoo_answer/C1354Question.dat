20090219230102AAIjU55	Social Science;Psychology	Have you ever felt as if it really is a "small world"?	I've just experienced it "soap opera" style. It's amazing how people (good/bad) suddenly come back into your life unexpectedly. It's like a crazy scene fr a soap opera where you're about to meet "someone" your friend's been wanting you to meet...their back is to you and they turn around and it's someone who might have had a major role at one time in your life.      I am now 22 and I had a similar situation happen now...when i turned 18, I had a "debutante" ball. My escort was someone I crushed over time. A few months before that I went thru my first "bad" "puppy love" break up w. a boyfriend and my escort was my first "real" crush after that bad experience. Turns out, my escort was DATING someone while seeing me. tsk tsk. My prom date's girlfriend was having a get together at her place and COINCIDENTALLY she happen to be childhood friends w. "the other girl" and that's how I found out. ANYWAY, at that time, it was the most dramatic thing...we're okay now and get along...but of course, he's not my one of my fav people.       One of my best girl friends started working for this new company months ago. She told our group of girls (4 total) how she was plannin to invite co-workers for her get-together. When she had her party, her co-workers weren't there BUT did tell us about a company party she recently went to. She JUST posted up pictures now and there are shots w. her/husband and her co-worker (her friend) + boyfriend (WHO HAPPENS TO BE MY OLD ESCORT)...it's eerie to me. I'm Asian and we're stereotypically clan-ish and nosy...i'm a private person...as friendly and welcoming as I am, it's weird to me that my world is feeling smaller and I kinda feel threatened. I'm happy my friend has a new friend but it's weird that everyone knows everyone and I feel that my privacy will somehow...i dunno...
20090219225924AAxzepV	Social Science;Economics	Why doesn't Target use unit pricing?	Every other store I shop at displays the  unit  price (e.g. price per pound) for each product.       I avoid shopping at Target because they do not list this information on their price tags.       What are they trying to hide?  Why wouldn't the store want you to know exactly how much each product costs (relative to the other brands on the shelf)?

20090219230643AAJxe1l	Social Science;Psychology	Predictive Validity Help with understanding the following paragraph?	Why does the predictive power of aptitude scores diminish as students move up the educational ladder? Consider a parallel situation: Among all American or Canadian football linemen, body weight correlates with success. A 300-pound player tends to overwhelm a 200 pound opponent. But within the narrow 260 to 300 pound range typically found at the professional level, the correlation between weight and success becomes negligible. The narrower the range of weights, the lower the predictive power of body weight becomes. If an elite university takes only those students who have very high aptitude scores, those scores cannot possibly predict much . This will be true even if the test has excellent predictive validity with a more diverse sample of students. So, when we validate a test using a wide range of people, but then use it with a restricted range of people, it loses much of its predictive validity.       What is this talking about?      Is it saying if you compare students with better scores on one test and teh scores varies a lot, you can identify who is better, but as their scores narrow you can not really differentiate that. But then what is the last part saying " SO, when we validate a test using a wide range of people but then use it with a restricted range of people, it loses much of its predictive validity"       Thank you for the help !

20090219232817AATemVw	Social Science;Psychology	Weird ethics,  I need work to earn affection. Your thoughts.?	I have been with my boyfriend for over 3 years.    There is periods were he is overly affectionate.      Then there is periods where  it's just no affection at all.          So anyways Val Day came and I knew in my heart that I wasn't going to get anything.         I got onto facebook to find one of my friends got a D & G bag and dinner at a resturant.      After reading I pested my boyfriend who said "Well it seemed she earned her affection. Unlike someone who hasn't been helping me out at the farm."        I was like WTF.    I am the one that gives affection, positive affirmations etc and I don't get it in return because I don't help him.        This I can imagine is going to get responses of just leave him if he doesn't give you affection etc.  It is kind of hard after all I have known him so long and I have become desensitized to what he says or acts.  It's just now that I see my friend getting gifts and is engaged after only being together for 6 months it is makes me jealous.      What are your thoughts?

If this system of things was for the people and not criminal...BY GOD NO ONE SHOULD BE LIVING UNDER STRESS OR ANY KIND OF HARDSHIP.

20090220003314AAVgnHI	Social Science;Psychology	Why do people have a distorted view of the world?	Me, for instance. I take everything personally. When I was in grade school, the school bus was late picking me up so I threw a tantrum bc they "hated" me. Even recently, if someone cut me off in traffic, I'd honk and yell bc they were trying to "screw me over." That's why I hadn't driven in almost a year. If someone snaps at me, I'd snap back thinking she's against me when she's just had a bad day.      I also think everyone's action is linked to evil intent. When a friend called me while I was driving, I figured she's trying to cause me an accident. That was a coupla years ago. I picked it up and cursed her out.      Whenever I suffer negative consequences for what I did, I tend to blame others who "triggered" me. For instance, a girl I wanna be friends with didn't wanna talk to me, so I became constantly destructive at school and got kicked off campus. I blamed that girl for "causing" this. And the stuff about my coworker who "got me fired." That's in my previous questions. Anyway, I blamed her for my mistake.

20070530160218AAf43wb	Social Science;Psychology	Okay, what do you think of this poem that I wrote. Sorry but, because I didn't have enough space, it's edited.	Rica is a lonely girl.   She's trying to figure out why she's experiencing so much hurt.   Every day seems like a disaster.   Everybody at school barely notices her.   The only attention she gets is when she's the subject of people's laughter.   Everybody is always pointing out all of her bad factors.   Her self-esteem is so low on the ground.   "Do I deserve to be treated this way?"   That's the answer to the question she's trying to figure out.   Till one day a boy starts to show her the slightest affection.   Becasue her low confidence, he easily takes advantage.   But when a baby starts to grow inside of her, he suddenly can't manage.   So now she's stuck and alone again in this world to deal.   She can't believe the pain she's feeling is real.   So now she has to face the life-changing decision.   She she go ahead and let the doctor make the incision?   Then she realizes that taking an unborn life is wrong.   She's got to have this baby and be strong.      My Yahoo 360 blog has the full-length one.

20090203114158AAqajPq	Social Science;Psychology	Ever feel like you have no control when you become angry?	This does not happen very often to me, but once in a blue moon, something will anger me to the point where I feel like I have almost no control over my actions. It is usually something small, which just escalates to the point where I am cursing very inappropriately under my breath, clenching my fists, tearing/ripping things, and hitting or throwing things across the room. These "episodes" rarely happen when I am around other people, and if they do, I try to control myself more than when I am alone, but I am still fiery mad and snap at anyone who may approach me. I have never done anything drastic, I have always stopped myself because I am aware of the consequences (a few minutes ago I felt like throwing my laptop from the bed to the floor), and have wanted to punch through things, but have never had 0% control over myself, but have wanted to let loose and take my anger out (never on another person). Anyway, like I said, this does not happen very often, and I have had less episodes in the past 6 months. Does this happen to people in your life or maybe even to you?

20081025173448AA4r2Ss	Social Science;Psychology	Is it normal that I cried in math class?	Till about maybe 5th grade, every time I was confused in math class, I started to tear up, and then a lot of the times I would start full on crying. This happened at home too, when I'd be confused, the same thing would happen.      I don't cry in class anymore, but sometimes when I'm really confused on math at home I still go into frustrated crying fits.      Please don't mock me, I just wanted to know if their was any psychological reason why I'm so easily prone to start crying. Because I never thought that was normal.
