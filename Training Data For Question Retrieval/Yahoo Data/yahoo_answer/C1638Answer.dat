AA11044780	Yogi Bear's, suggested above has been closed for years, its where the Great Wolf Lodge now is.  Cedarbrook in Lebanon isnt bad, and is only a short back road drive away from KI.  Here is a link to their website => <a href="http://www.cedarbrookcampground.com/" rel="nofollow">http://www.cedarbrookcampground.com/</a><br>  <br>  Another one to consider in Lebanon is Morgan's Riverside Campground.  If I was choosing, this is the one I'd probably pick.  Its down by the Little Miami River, and they rent canoes there, so in addition to Kings Island and camping, you can also take a fun canoe trip down the river.  Again, its just a short drive away, their contact information is: (513) 899-2166 - 2247 Moore-Saur Rd, Morrow, OH.<br>  <br>  The other advantage of being in the Lebanon area (Morrow is just up the road from Lebanon) is that Lebanon is a cool town, and a tourist destination in its own right.  Its a very historic town, with Ohio's oldest Inn (The Golden Lamb), in which numerous Presidents have stayed and eaten, and other famous personalities like Charles Dickens.  Its also full of antique shops, has a lot of other cool little stores and restaurants, and it has a real train that kids love.

esIvgHxnaa	Hey! I am Costa Rican and live in a small town called Naranjo, located 30 miles west from San Jose. Got a Pet Shop there if u wanna stop by (It's name is Veterinaria Naranjo).<br>  <br>  Yes, you can drive in Costa Rica, just need to be a lil' bit careful with some animals driving over there (I mean people who drive like animals). Most likely, what you will need is patience, a loooooot of patience because our main roads are jammed all day every day and the asphalt quality is awful. I recommend you to rent a 4WD car and you will be fine. Whether you land in San Jose or Liberia, there is a lot of Car Rentals around (Budget, Avis, National, Thrifty, Sixt...)<br>  <br>  Regarding the "Ugly American" thing, don't worry, we are very used to have tourists here so most of us won't think such thing of you. We perfectly understand if you don't wanna try some Typical dishes and drinks, however, I strongly recommend you to try the "Gallo Pinto", "Chorreadas con Natilla", "Pozole" and drinks like "Horchata", "Chan", "Resbaladera" and of course, our beers! My personal favorite is called "Bavaria" In case you want some American Food, we are plenty of McDonalds, BK, Subway, Quizno's, Pizza Hut, KFC, Hooters, Wendy's, Taco Bell so you won't feel like there's nothing to eat. I'd really like to see a Red Lobster here in Costa Rica.<br>  <br>  Now, regarding security, please do NOT be very trustful, there's a lot of thieves everywhere waiting for you to put your digital camera, wallet or your cellphone aside. Please keep an eye on your baggage every second, specially if you go to San Jose's downtown or Puntarenas downtown (Puntarenas downtown is ugly anyways, don't go there). Also, do not worry for carrying a lot od cash, we take Visa and Master Card almost everywhere (your AMEX...not that much), so please have just $100 in $10 bills and you'll be fine.<br>  <br>  Places to visit: <br>  Monteverde (rain forest, it rocks!), Flamingo (kinda expensive beach, but beautiful), Sarchi (to buy some hand made handicrafts), La Fortuna (to watch the always active Arenal Volcano), Poas Volcano (one of the largest craters worldwide), Corcovado (take a Sansa plane) is amazing!<br>  <br>  I hope I've given you a good idea of what to expect. U can ping me at kenneth_ag@yahoo.com if having any questions.|`|XDbJOVLYaa	Costa Rica and Nicaragua are perfectly safe to drive in.  Granada and San Juan Del Sur are cool towns to check out in Nicaragua.  Costa Rica has many great beaches and you can travel anywhere safely.  Small coffee towns like Atenas, Grecia, and San Ramon have great climates and wonderful people.  These have wonderful retirement communities too.
Jm3vMKx3aa	If you are talking about the town of Bocholt in Germany the easiest way would be an Intercitiy train from Amsterdam to Oberhausen (110 mins.) a regional train to Wesel (27 mins.) and another one to Bocholt (23 mins.). The total travel with stopover waiting time take either 3:21 or 3:51 hours. The regular fare is €48.60; other comnections are available taking either longer or require additional stopovers.<br>  <br>  If you should however plan to go to the small Belgium village of Bocholt in the Limburg province you need to go by train to Antwerpen (2:06), continue to Neerpelt (1:13) and by deLijn bus 8/68 from Neerpelt to Bocholt (19 mins.)<br>  <br>  <br>  Source(s):<br>  <a href="http://reiseauskunft.bahn.de/bin/query.exe/en" rel="nofollow">http://reiseauskunft.bahn.de/bin/query.e...</a><br>  <a href="http://hari.b-holding.be/Hafas/bin/query.exe/en?" rel="nofollow">http://hari.b-holding.be/Hafas/bin/query...</a><br>  <a href="http://www.delijn.be/reisinformatie/dienstregeling/index.htm?dci-src-req=pdf%2Flimb%2FHASTINFO%2F4%2F4183241207.pdf&dci-host-req=http%3A%2F%2Fappl.delijn.be%2Finfopdf%2F&dci-uuid=1235580459484" rel="nofollow">http://www.delijn.be/reisinformatie/dien...</a><br>  <a href="http://www.delijn.be/reisinformatie/dienstregeling/index.htm?dci-src-req=pdf%2Flimb%2FHASTINFO%2F4%2F4068010107.pdf&dci-host-req=http%3A%2F%2Fappl.delijn.be%2Finfopdf%2F&dci-uuid=1235581390937" rel="nofollow">http://www.delijn.be/reisinformatie/dien...</a><br>  <a href="http://www.delijn.be/reisinformatie/dienstregeling/index.htm?dci-src-req=pdf%2Flimb%2FHASTINFO%2F4%2F4008241207.pdf&dci-host-req=http%3A%2F%2Fappl.delijn.be%2Finfopdf%2F&dci-uuid=1235581454880" rel="nofollow">http://www.delijn.be/reisinformatie/dien...</a>
ejujoezgaa	Keep in mind that Cleveland is perhaps the greatest little big city in the U.S. with world class cultural attractions.  If you want a big city experience with all of the modern conveniences of a suburb, you first need to decide whether and how close you want to be to downtown Cleveland.  It will take you three-five days to make this decision, given the age of your kids.  Here are some things to do:<br>  <br>  1)  You should take your kids to University Circle for a day.  Go to the Cleveland Art Museum, among the five best in the U.S., which has free admission.  Stay until your kids get bored.  Then take them to Natural History Museum, which has a great planetarium.  Take them to see the butterflies in the Glass House at the Cleveland Botanical Gardens.  Then take them for some pastries at a Little Italy bakery (I like Presti's).   There's parking on Murray Hill Road just off Mayfield.<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.classactresale.com/imagelib/sitebuilder/misc/show_image.html?linkedwidth=actual&linkpath=http://www.classactresale.com/sitebuildercontent/sitebuilderpictures/SCREENCOPY_MAP2.jpg&target=tlx_piccdpl&title=2009%20Little%20Italy%20Cleveland%20Walking%20Map" rel="nofollow">http://www.classactresale.com/imagelib/s...</a><br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.cbgarden.org/Visit/Glasshouse.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.cbgarden.org/Visit/Glasshouse...</a><br>  <br>  2)  Once summer is here, spend a day at the Great Lakes Science Center, the Mather Steamship and be certain to tour the U.S.S. Cod, a very short walk away.  After the lakefront, go to the west Flats, walk along the river and have dinner at Shooter's.<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g50207-d137605-r20287546-USS_Cod_Submarine_Memorial-Cleveland_Ohio.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserRevie...</a><br>  <br>  3)  Visit the Cleveland Metropark Zoo.  The Rainforest is one of the top ten zoo exhibits in the U.S. and the zoo has the largest collection of primates in the U.S.  You could go on any sunny weekend when the temperature is above 40 degrees and have a good time.<br>  <br>  4)  Take in an Indians game or a Cavs game or some other event at Quicken Arena.<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.theqarena.com/publish/events/index.php" rel="nofollow">http://www.theqarena.com/publish/events/...</a><br>  <br>  5)  Get tickets now for "Mary Poppins" at Playhouse Square this summer.  Playhouse Square is the second largest performing arts center after Lincoln Center in the U.S., and offers many attractions for young children, as does the Cleveland Playhouse and the Beck Center in Lakewood.  During the holidays, many special shows are available for children of all ages, including a regional production of the Radio City Music Hall Christmas Spectacular.<br>  <br>  6)  Take a tour of the Cuyahoga River and Lake Erie on the Goodtime III.<br>  <br>  <a href="https://www.goodtimeiii.com/PublicSchedule.asp" rel="nofollow">https://www.goodtimeiii.com/PublicSchedu...</a><br>  <br>  Before or after, visit the West Side Market.  Eat there, or go across the street for a pizza at Bar Cento, or down the hill to Sokolowski's in Tremont, or walk over to the Great Lakes Brewery for a burger and ask to see the Eliot Ness bullet holes.<br>  <br>  <a href="http://nochoiceatall.blogspot.com/2008/12/bar-centro-cleveland.html" rel="nofollow">http://nochoiceatall.blogspot.com/2008/1...</a><br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.greatlakesbrewing.com/campusBrewpub.php" rel="nofollow">http://www.greatlakesbrewing.com/campusB...</a><br>  <br>  7)  Attend a children's concert, especially the annual Christmas Show, at Severance Hall, famed home of the Cleveland Orchestra, ranked second in the U.S. and seventh in the world.  See the Classical Clown performance on May 16:<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.clevelandorchestra.com/html/performance/viewByMonth.asp?m=5&y=2009#5/16/2009" rel="nofollow">http://www.clevelandorchestra.com/html/p...</a><br>  <br>  8)  Visit the Lake Metroparks Farmpark and the nearby Holden Arboretum, one of the largest in the U.S.  Perhaps you could visit the Farmpark for Maple Sugaring Weekend in March.<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.lakemetroparks.com/programs/MapleSugaringWeekend.shtml" rel="nofollow">http://www.lakemetroparks.com/programs/M...</a><br>  <br>  Once you've decided how close you want to be to Cleveland's attractions, then you can begin to narrow in on your desired suburb.<br>  <br>  Combining good schools, a newer house below $150K, low tax rates, a commercial center (i.e., chain restaurants), a quiet neighborhood five minutes from a mall, is a tough order.<br>  <br>  The only place that I know that MAY qualify (especially if you're willing to fix up a house) are the neighborhoods immediately around Great Lakes Mall in Mentor in Lake County.<br>  <br>  Your husband, however, would have longer commutes than from Medina to Akron and Columbus.  The biggest drawback to Mentor IMO is its giant high school, one of the very largest in the state of Ohio.  It's tough to make varsity sports teams there.  Perhaps you could find something in nearby Willoughby or Kirtland.  There are some less expensive homes in northern Mentor and Mentor-on-the-Lake.  From all of these communities, you are less than half an hour from virtually every restaurant chain and big box retailer you can think of, and many of them are in Mentor, which is one of Ohio's largest retail centers.  Part of Concord Township is in the Mentor school district, and does not have a city income tax.<br>  <br>  One of Mentor's great attractions is Mentor Headlands Beach State Park, one of the best beaches on Lake Erie.<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.dnr.state.oh.us/parks/headlnds/tabid/742/Default.aspx" rel="nofollow">http://www.dnr.state.oh.us/parks/headlnd...</a><br>  <br>  Perhaps no city in Ohio can match Mentor's recreational facilities, which even includes a large marina:<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.cityofmentor.com/tacc5/content/play.aspx?js=056c95e4-d683-418f-bda6-8de41fe22bef" rel="nofollow">http://www.cityofmentor.com/tacc5/conten...</a><br>  <br>  Mentor is less than a half hour from downtown Cleveland for sporting events and the world-class cultural attractions in University 'Circle.  Willoughby is even closer.<br>  <br>  You also should look very closely at Lakewood IMO.<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.lkwdpl.org/city/" rel="nofollow">http://www.lkwdpl.org/city/</a><br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.lkwdpl.org/parentpages/" rel="nofollow">http://www.lkwdpl.org/parentpages/</a><br>  <br>  If you want to stay on the south side of Cleveland, look at Brecksville, near a great Cuyahoga County Metropark<br>  <br>  Solon has among the best public schools in Greater Cleveland, but it is further from downtown and may not meet your other requirements if you didn't like Medina as being too rural (I like Medina!!!).  Solon is as about as far from Cleveland's premier upscale shopping area -- Beachwood Place and Legacy Village -- as Mentor.<br>  <br>  Wherever you pick, make certain that you understand the adequacy of the sewer systems and the potential impact of future development on your chosen neighborhood and on traffic congestion:<br>  <br>  <a href="http://blog.cleveland.com/sunstar/2008/06/strongsville_meadowood_residen.html" rel="nofollow">http://blog.cleveland.com/sunstar/2008/0...</a><br>  <br>  BOL!|`|eI0IUHQ2aa	Macedonia or Twinsburg|`|pdbc4souaa	Kent, Ohio.|`|HUIo1fQaaa	I grew up in Middleburg Hts.  It is a suburb SW of Cleveland, still in Cuyahoga County.  It is right next to Strongsville, but a little cheaper.  The school district is excellent, it is low in crime and close to everything.  It is right off I-71 so downtown is close, as is the Ohio Turnpike and I-480.|`|jOM4bBMPaa	Try Mayfield Heights.  There are many strip malls with good places to shop, it's easily accessible to the freeway, and has one of the best school districts of the east side suburbs.  It's only a few minutes of a drive to Legacy Village which has a Cheesecake Factory & CPK, and the Beachwood Place mall.  Mayfield Heights has a lot of houses that are newer than a lot of the other east side suburbs, but they aren't brand new.|`|tqD9xUpYaa	I've lived in Strongsville since 1985 but grew up in Olmsted Falls.  With Strongsville's access to I-71, the Ohio Turnpike as well as not very far from I-480 or the airport, your husband wouldn't spend too much time getting to the highways.  I assume you teach somewhere near Medina so your commute wouldn't be bad either.  And of course South Park Mall is right here.  The schools have always been rated well.  The city has its rec center and has good sports leagues for your children.  Our branch of the Cuyahoga County Public Library is basically new and gorgeous.<br>  <br>  The housing is available in your price range in quite a few areas of Strongsville, which is all safe.  But you might be spending more like $175K for a home large enough for the 4 of you since your children are growing and you might want a guest bedroom as well.<br>  <br>  I'd recommend you check out Strongsville more.  I don't plan on moving away from it.  I think the mayor and council are trying to do the right things.|`|aa1OGptZaa	Cuyahoga Falls<br>  <a href="http://cfo.cityofcf.com/web2/view.do?dir=about&tile=great.htm" rel="nofollow">http://cfo.cityofcf.com/web2/view.do?dir...</a>|`|NTyaQDFzaa	Rocky River or Westlake area|`|x6jQCrxsaa	Parma! :)|`|TOv0LNMRaa	Try Westlake, Bay Village or Rocky River, all nice cities.|`|sQETRcxtaa	lor is right Westlake is probably EXACTLY what you are looking for. <br>  and im with you i hate medina|`|6aB4vIg4aa	Strongsville is the answer!<br>  <br>  Your top priority, the public schools, are excellent. I attended elementary, junior and senior high school there and when I started college (a small, selective liberal arts school), I was way ahead of most of my classmates.  There are 8 elementary schools and a Catholic grade school so you have a lot of options for work.  And to echo another responder, the Strongsville branch of the Cuyahoga County library is state-of-the-art (I used to work there).  <br>  <br>  Best thing: Convenience <br>  -Strongsville's convenient for commuting on 71 and the Turnpike, but also on back roads (82, Prospect) that can save you a lot of time in traffic, depending on where you're going.  <br>  -It's convenient for shopping.  Almost all Strongsville has now is big box stores & restaurants.  The mall is among the largest in the country and has a 12-screen movie theater.  There are 3 different grocery stores, as well as Marc's (essential!).  <br>  -It's convenient for sports and activities.  Strongsville borders the Metroparks, one of Northeast Ohio's gems.  It has the Chalet, which has tobogganning in the winter and hayrides in the fall.  There's a nice trail system for biking and rollerblading, and places like Bonnie Park that are perfect for birthday parties.  The city's rec center is also a big plus.  Your kids will love the pool with waterslides & diving boards.  Of course the city has youth soccer, softball, football, & basketball leagues, swim team, even ice hockey.  Are you getting excited yet?<br>  <br>  Downside: ???  I guess I'd say there's less for teenagers to do than there is for younger kids, but that's probably true of anywhere.  Plus, you've got some time before you'd have to worry about that.<br>  <br>  Good luck choosing your new home from among all the newer, affordable houses in safe neighborhoods!   Go with your gut -- If you liked visiting Strongsville, you will love living there.  Feel free to ask me any other specific questions you have about Strongsville & I'll do my best.|`|AA11965739	I'm kinda in the same boat as you!  I lived near Evansville, IN for about the first 22 years of my life.  Then moved to GA for about 6 and now we are moving to OH this summer.  My husband is gonna be working in Maple Heights, but we're looking to rent probably in another area.  I'm doing research on the same type of stuff. I'm not wanting the feeling of a big city, though.  I just started looking today and I've seen good reviews on Solon and Chagrin Falls and the elementary schools got good reviews from what I've seen so far too.  Good luck with your search!

b8tgCAQJaa	Both the UK and Poland are members of the European Union (EU). The EU allows people from any EU country to live and work in any other EU country.<br>  <br>  Poland became a full EU member in 2004, which gave its citizens the automatic right to live and work in the UK and other EU countries. Because there were far more jobs in the UK than in Poland, and wages and living conditions were generally better here, a great many Poles (hundreds of thousands of them) migrated to the UK between 2004 and 2007.<br>  <br>  A similar thing happened with British people in the early 1980s, when unemployment was high and a lot of UK manual workers went to Germany to look for work. This was depicted in the original ITV series of Auf Weidersehen Pet.<br>  <br>  There aren't lots of Poles coming here any more, though - in fact, many of them are going home now, due to the economic situation in the UK getting worse and there being far fewer jobs available for them.<br>  <br>  To the person who said:<br>  <br>  "The bus companies could`nt get anyone to do the job before the Poles came. There`s your answer. Our young people don`t want to work, the Poles do."<br>  <br>  That was because the bus companies were paying crap wages, not because nobody wanted to do the job!<br>  <br>  Why would a British person want to earn some pitiful amount like ￡7 an hour to put up with abusive passengers and bad traffic, when they could earn double that amount as a train driver or a taxi driver?<br>  <br>  If they put the wages up they'd get loads of British people applying (and I bet they DO now have loads of Brits applying, now that jobs are scarce elsewhere).<br>  <br>  Poland is a poor country, so ￡7 an hour is actually really good by Polish standards. That's why you have all these Polish bus drivers.<br>  <br>  I hate this stupid myth of "Poles being more hard working". If supposedly "lazy" Brits had the opportunity to travel to another country and earn four times their normal wage, I bet they'd be hard working too.|`|dCbIHBpGaa	Poland joined the EU in 2004. One if the main ideas behind the EU is free movement of people and goods in the member states so in theory anyone in one of the member states can go and work in any other. So you are free to get a job in Warsaw in you like! The only problem is that if some states are considerably wealthier than others then you get a load of people on the move.

Did you think they'd be here forever?  Most just want to earn loads of money and then go back to their country.  <br>  The pound is low and companies are laying off loads of workers.  Especially in low skilled jobs such as manufacturing.  That has a massive effect on the amount of workers coming from Eastern Europe.  <br>  <br>  The low pound is attractive to tourists coming from Europe though and that is one way Britain could get out of Recession.  They can do what they never would have been able to do before and come over here on a holiday on the cheap.<br>  <br>  The Polish are doing what any British person would do if they had the chance to earn loads of money abroad.

8DqfKuiUaa	The price per flight depends on the time of year you travel. <br>  <br>  Yes Volcanos are on Kona, the Big Island.  Maui has the best beaches, Kauai has great hiking, and Oahu has the most history (however it is highly commercialized). <br>  <br>  Oahu <br>  The most populated island, where Honolulu is the Capital City, the principal port, the major airport, and business and financial center, and the educational heart of the State. Oahu is the military command center of the Pacific. Waikiki is the visitor center. It is a fast paced, busy environment, and if you are looking for night life, this is the place for you!! Also, you do not need a rental car on this island because everything is in close walking distance there it saves you money! Landmarks: Nuuanu Pali, Diamond Head, Pearl Harbor. Cheapest Island to visit. <br>  <br>  Maui:<br>  With white sand beaches and crystal clear waters, Maui is ideal for sunbathing, snorkeling and snoozing! But once you’ve gotten enough sun, Maui’s also a great place for shopping and sightseeing. The old whaling town of Lahaina is home to many quaint shops and eclectic art galleries. On the opposite side of the island, the long road to Hana will lead you to the waterfall fed pools at Oheo Gulch, a perfect place to stretch your legs and take in the view. After touring the island, you may need to unwind in Wailea with a pampering spa treatment. It’s no wonder visitors return here year after year.  Most popular place for Honeymooners, Romantic getaways, and Family Vacations! <br>  <br>  Kauai:<br>  From the spectacular views at Waimea Canyon to the verdant vistas along the Napali Coast, Kauai can take your breath away. More and more people are coming to Kauai because they are attracted to its natural beauty and laidback atmosphere. Visitors are also drawn to Kauai for its gorgeous tropical rainforests, some of which can only be accessed by helicopter. These aerial tours take you into the heart of the island and offer spectacular scenic views that will remain with you long after your vacation ends. Popular for Nature Lovers, and honeymooners.  No night life. NOT ALL BEACHES ARE SWIM ABLE. <br>  <br>  Kona (Hawaii)<br>  Explore Hawaii's Big Island, and sense the power of volcano goddess Pele as she creates new land over old. See new vegetation growing in seemingly impossible pockets -- micro views of natural cycles that civilization obscures elsewhere. Molten lava flows glowing in the dark night are a spectacular sight -- destruction and creation on a grand scale.  Molten lava is the Big Island's hottest attraction, but you can also explore the cool depths of a sunstruck ocean; see local sights on foot or horseback; uncover art treasures in tiny plantation towns, play top-flight golf on internationally-renown courses; walk the paths ancient Hawaiians traveled; have a cup of Kona coffee at the source; visit cattle country, home of the paniolo Hawaiian cowboys. Wherever you go on Hawaii's Big Island, chances are it'll be a new experience, even if you've been there before! E komo mai, explore to your heart's content. Everyone is welcome. Sightseeing Galore! <br>  <br>  Lanai:<br>  Nick named “the Million Dollar Island”.  There are only 2 (Luxury) Resorts on the whole island.  This charming island is home to just over 3,000 people, making it the perfect place for rest relaxation, rejuvenation, rediscovery and romance. From beautiful Manele Bay to the bumpy road and scenic views of the Munro Trail, you'll find a wide range of activities to please just about everyone. Golf on two challenging courses or go snorkeling in crystal clear waters at Hulopoe Beach. The resorts also offer excellent services for your indulgence. Relaxation and seclusion! <br>  <br>  Molokai:<br>  Molokai offers the perfect place for ultimate relaxation, though you can always find some interesting things to do. Try your hand at fishing with the locals or be adventurous and go sportfishing out in the open ocean. Intimate hiking and breathtaking bicycle tours are also available. For a truly unique experience, visitors aged 16 years and older can take a mule ride down the steep cliff to Kalaupapa National Historical Park, the isolated and historic settlement of those inflicted with Hansen’s Disease. Great snorkeling.|`|XOgvpDiZaa	lol, "big Hawaii." It's called the Big Island. That's the only island that has an active volcano, so that's one island where you want to visit.<br>  <br>  As for beaches, Maui is your best bet. No expensive shopping and over-development.<br>  <br>  Actually...if you REALLY want to experience the real Hawaii, go to Molokai. There's only one stoplight there, that's how "old" it is. But it is a nice island.|`|4b127bdc65641a05881903d7090f19c2aa	Kaua'i is the most laid back of the major islands and Oahu is the most commercial.  Hawaii (a.k.a. The Big Island) and Maui fall in between.  There are smaller islands like Lanai and Molokai that are even more laid back than Kaua'i but they don't offer much in the way of tourism or activities.  It sounds like you'd enjoy The Big Island, which is the only one with active volcanoes, and Maui, which has a great combination of unspoiled natural beauty and fun activities.  Flights from island to island generally range from $50 to $100 per flight.  Sometimes the best way to book a multi-island trip is to book the flights as a single multi-destination package.  I did that on Hawaiian Airlines when I went to Kaua'i and Maui two years ago.  There's a check box you can select for multi-destination flights, then you can enter all of your airports and flight dates and see the total price.  It's usually cheaper that way than booking the flights separately.|`|KNYYSlFOaa	It depends what airlines you use. But all the islands is beautiful. Maui has beautiful beaches but so does Oahu. Big Island is the only island with an active volcano. But if you really wanna experience the old Hawaii then go Molokai I been there it's beautiful I would go to the lookout you can see where they kept the lepers it's cool &nd like your in the clouds.<br>  <br>  -Kylie
AA11615216	You can do Seaworld EASY in one day.  What our family does was we got the map with the show time list, took out a pen and circled all the shows that we wanted to see and at what time.

0exde9VEaa	Flight fares from Ghana to Malaysia + updates ?   That is a very high order = no one in Malaysia is likely to help you on this.   It is much easier to find the information in Ghana:  Which airlines fly into Ghana ?  Which of these fly onwards to Malaysia(Kuala Lumpur ?).?  Non ?  Then you need to find cities near Ghana where airlines fly to Malaysia, or to a city near Malaysia (Bangkok ?Singapore ? Manila ?) and from there, a connection flight to Malaysia...i.e. you may need to make connection flights of different airlines. ... see the logistics problem ?

Ours is a safe, uncrowded, first world country with very little real poverty and the majority of people have a good standard of living. Our lifestyle is very relaxed and oriented towards the outdoors because of our great climate and fantastic natural environment and most of our population is located within fairly easy reach of the coast.

It could add up.<br>  Cutting lawns, cleaning cars, cleaning out garages, babysitting, weeding gardens, cleaning houses, cleaning pools, etc, etc,.. Or even <br>  simple stuff for friends or neighbors like cleaning out their pantry, straighten or organize a toy room, cleaning out their shed, straightening <br>  a room up, etc, etc.. People get paid big bucks for doing these jobs, offer your services at a discount and watch your money grow. Also, what about offering to take any of your friends or neighbors junk and then selling it at a garage sale or ebay. You can have many of these sales each weekend. To entice people to give you their things, why not give them back a percentage of the profits.<br>  Over the summer you can pick up a part-time job too! And finally, what a bout making a deal with a grandparent, parent, aunt uncle, etc, that whatever you make they match a<br>  Percentage. For instance, they could match what you make or maybe match it by a percentage. For every $100, they could give you a 20 % match or $20.

I don't have the statistics to back up my claim, but Greece is a vacation Hotspot for many around the globe. With that many different people from different countries of ethnic origin visiting and having a good time, it speaks positively to the acceptance, tolerance and non-racial sentiments of Greeks living there.<br>  <br>  In answer to your actual question.

However Greece's racism is usually because of ignorance when it comes to people who are different to them in looks/skin colour. Whereas Germany, Holland, France and of course UK have had multiracial countries for years and years ... it's still relatively new in Greece - so people are generally weary of foreigners whom are so physically different to them. <br>  I know of 2 black girls married to Greek men in my town and one Greek girl who is with a black guy from USA and we live in a small town - so mixed relationships are on the way up - but nothing like UK or other! <br>  My nieces (in UK) are mixed race and when they come to Greece they do get stared at A LOT - doesn't bother the youngest - but the eldest gets very upset. <br>  Many foreigner women and many Greek women have problems when entering a relationship - usually with their future mother-in-laws - being a different colour (and religion)  might just add more problems - but ignorance can be overcome and it depends on the type of guy you date.<br>  Racism in Greece is usually aimed at Albanians, Turkish (for the past) and sometimes British/Americans  .... usually other forms towards the Chinese. blacks (we have a lot of Africans selling things on street corners - bags/ wooden ornaments etc) Filipino, Pakistanis etc is through ignorance and narrow mindedness rather than hatred.|`|6JcodrClaa	I think we cannot generalize about the whole Greek male population, because that's also a question of personal preferences...<br>  In general, most of Mediterranean men have good tastes, so they probably appreciate a beautiful woman, regardless of her ethnicity...<br>  I personnaly know a Greek guy in Paris that was dating a girl from Cameroon...And yes, he was lucky, because she was damn gorgeous...I was jealous, lol|`|32anSMrOaa	Well i have see many Greek girls outside of Grece who date or marry black men.My neighbor is married to a Nigerian/Dutch guy.But i don't any Greek guy who date or marry black woman.But Jason above did.Other fact is that inside Greece we don't really have and many black or Middle Eastern immigrants.Most of them are from East Europe or Central Asia.|`|SOawUqxqaa	I think the answer is in the results. you ask the greek men and two greek men only answer. they both said not really. make your conclusions, why most greek men avoided your question?

xIHgTqVhaa	I'm a former Flight Attendant and I now fly a lot with my three kids. <br>  <br>  Booster seats are not only not required but not allowed on airplanes because they can't secure a child. <br>  <br>  There are two problems with boosters. First of all, they are basically just to reposition the shoulder strap. Airplanes don't *have* shoulder straps, just lap belts. <br>  <br>  Also, airplane seats, unlike car seats, collapse forward for emergency evacuations. With a booster, there is no protection from this for the child. <br>  <br>  So the only seats allowed to be used on aircraft are those with an internal harness and a hard back. The seat is secured with the lap belt while the child is secured with the straps on the seat. <br>  <br>  Car seats are never required but highly recommended, by the AAP and the FAA, as well as some other organizations. <br>   <br>  <a href="http://www.faa.gov/passengers/fly_children/crs/" rel="nofollow">http://www.faa.gov/passengers/fly_childr...</a><br>  <a href="http://www.aap.org/advocacy/releases/travelsafetytips.cfm" rel="nofollow">http://www.aap.org/advocacy/releases/tra...</a><br>  <a href="http://www.thecarseatlady.com/airplanes/airplanes.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.thecarseatlady.com/airplanes/...</a><br>  <br>  Just as a reminder, boosters shouldn't be used till at least age 4, even if allowed by law. A five point harness is safest and there are lots of seats now that harness past 40lbs. Many are FAA approved for flights. <br>  <br>  Never check a car seat in as luggage. The damage can be difficult to see and render the car seat unsafe. You wouldn't know unless you were in an accident and it didn't "preform" correctly. <br>  <br>  Never rent a car seat from a rental car company. Many are dirty, expired, missing parts, etc. They also charge too much and it's not that difficult to take a car seat on to the aircraft and use it. If the child doesn't have a seat, it can be "gate-checked" at the door of the aircraft with the wheelchairs and strollers, which is gentlier than checking it in as luggage. <br>  <br>  Some parents like to bring the booster on board just so it isn't lost in the luggage. If you opt to do this, it will count as a carry-on and you will have to stow it once onboard. <br>  <br>  Hope that helps!|`|vEJhSd0Raa	I have never seen a booster seat, if the child is under a certain age he/she will need to sit on the parents knee and where an extender seatbelt.|`|AzKUBp2Jaa	only if you are child! you dont say if you are or not!

Still, we (my husband and I) recommended it when his parents came for a visit.  The rooms were nice and spacious.  The casino is clean and has all kinds of games (table/slots).<br>  They also have all the restaurants you could stomach.  Among them are Billy Bob's Steakhouse, TGIFriday's (to open before your visit), and Dunkin' Donuts.  There's also an italian restaurant, a mexican restaurant, an all-american cafe, a buffet and a food court (with Sbarro, McD's, etc.).<br>  Don't miss the bowling alley downstairs, which is open 24-hours, or the bar that has live bands and dancing.<br>  Overall, I like Sam's Town...|`|AA10240904	Sam's is an older casino that has been renovated.  It is a nice local place without the glitch of The Strip.  Locals enjoy it.  Down the street is the new Eastside Casino, a very nice place, and also Boulder Station.  So there is lots to do in the area.

D5dazLswaa	To get the cheapest possible, the best thing is to get the flights and hotel etc from www.lastminute.com and then buy day tickets for the park.<br>  <br>  The themed hotels etc need to be bought in a package with travel agents, and all cost pretty much the same - but it's a bit of a rip off.<br>  <br>  Best thing to do is to stay nearby and go for the days to the park.

Jm3vMKx3aa	No renting company is offering this service officially but in nowadays global market everything can be arranged. You should however be prepared to pay a horrible price for getting the car back to the United Kingdom.<br>  Sixt, an international operating car rental company for example offers cars to be rented in Austria and dropped off in France. They ask for a one-way fee (Einweggebühr) of €500 which amounts to approximately ￡400. So if you are willing to pay an extra ￡500 to include the transfer by ferry or chunnel to the U.K. you might be able to find a renting company.<br>  <br>  Edit:<br>  To rent a car in the U.K. you must have an age of at least 21 years, which I doubt you have by reading through your previous questions and answers.|`|xsP90gEbaa	Don,t bother|`|rct1Ggblaa	Sorry, your idea is a non-starter!  Car rental as you describe it is out of the question!<br>  <br>  I agree that the train is the most sensible solution.  If you insist on driving, then the best thing to do is to buy a cheap second-hand left hand drive car, and try and sell it when you no longer need.   Make sure it has the usual British paperwork, and that it is sufficiently roadworthy to make it to Austria.<br>  <br>  If you can't get 6 months worth of possessions on the train, then you can ship them...   |`|dohhfGTfaa	For a start, most hire companies charge an incredibly high fee for hiring a car in one country and dropping off in another.<br>  <br>  You will have an additional problem in that you'll be driving a right hand drive car to a country where left hand drive is the norm.  No-one will be able to hire that car in Austria.<br>  <br>  Have you contacted any car rental companies to get their opinion?  It would be easier, and much cheaper, just to take the train.<br>  |`|69747adf3b6a9d2b152eabc1282fee2daa	The bigger international companies, e.g. Hertz and Avis, can certainly arrange this for you. The cost, however, will be high. It depends on your pocket, and how much you want to pay for that convenience.<br>  <br>  Documentation will be as normal when hiring a vehicle. In a case such as this, however, you could well be asked for a large deposit.<br>  <br>  Better get a couple of quotes.|`|uFYdPL8Zaa	Britain is on an island.

You will definitely be able to find a great deal.<br>  <br>  - Brian
Dd14BZncaa	Adding to Casey's answer is the fact that, because the Montreal subway is "rubber on rubber" as opposed to Toronto's "steel on steel", Montreal subway trains never come out at street level, as they do in Toronto.|`|vl6OtBfWaa	The largest and most important difference is that the Toronto subway is a version of train with steel wheels running on steel tracks.<br>  The Montreal subway has pneumatic or air filled rubber tires running on a perfectly smooth raised cast concrete track.<br>  <br>  The Montreal subway is also decorated with art and mosaics as each station was designed by a specific architect and designer the toronto subway is functional and rather ugly.
aIZfiU6Kaa	No problem. all you have to do is to check with the different airlines as they all have their own rules, for a start find out who your friends flew with.<br>  <br>  With Easyjet for instance, they do not accept unaccompanied minors under the age of 14 for travel. Children under 14 years of age cannot travel unless accompanied by a person aged 16 years or older who will take responsibility for the minor,  BMI Baby have the same rules so shop around.|`|YnU1URIGaa	No you can't.<br>  My sister has the same problems with her daughter at the moment.<br>  She can fly on her own or with a group but for booking a hotel or apartment abroad, for insurance purposes, someone in the party MUST be 18..which is legally recognised as being an adult.<br>  <br>  Equally, anyone under the age of 18 MUST supply the travel agent with a confirmation letter from a parent stating they have permission to travel.|`|HUrYSp4oaa	one of the party must be 18, my son had this problem when he was 17 turning 18 they had to wait for one of the group to turn 18 to be able to book it.  u can fly younger than this independently but not on package holidays.|`|65Rzxlv2aa	Um... just what PART of: "NO PERSON UNDER 18 CAN TRAVEL INDEPENDANTLY" is it that you can't understand?
9tcv3TiWaa	If it is a direct flight with no layovers then it shouldn't be a problem.  Make sure that she is okay with it, is checked on by the flight attendants, and she should be alright.  Find out if you can walk her to the gate and see who is sitting next to her.|`|99A05hsnaa	Well i've asked my mum and she said, she'd panick about the safety of the flight. Trust ur instinct. Make a decision that u and ur daughter are comfortable with. Then again i know of someone who was about 8/9 at the time she went on an aeroplane alone and she was fine.|`|NPbIgn8Jaa	Wow. In this case, since your daughter knows everything, assuming that's the truth, I really do not see any harm in letting her to that. Since your mother will be picking her up from the airport, she just has to take the flight alone only. You shouldnt be too worried, in my opinion.|`|WlYknD5Vaa	she should be fine. if you are seriously worried, you could probably request the unaccompanied minor service. i am 15 and this summer i am traveling by myself from the usa to europe, with 2 connections in philly and london going to madrid.|`|WA7UsDRSaa	Its OK, but If you can, Ask your airline company!

cMZEmpp0aa	The squat toilets I used didn't have much (if any) water in the bowls the way Western-style toilets do. Here, look at this picture: <a href="http://img2.travelblog.org/Photos/12626/41508/t/218172-My-first-Japanese-squat-toilet-0.jpg" rel="nofollow">http://img2.travelblog.org/Photos/12626/...</a> (safe for work -- just a picture of a clean toilet). <br>  <br>  To use the toilet properly, you would be facing the pipes. There's just not enough water on the spot where your business lands to splash up on you. Plus, if you squat right, you're going to be pretty low to the ground: <a href="http://www.japanitup.com/wp-content/uploads/2007/10/japanese-toilet.jpg" rel="nofollow">http://www.japanitup.com/wp-content/uplo...</a> (totally safe for work -- it's little stick figures). So...yeah, I think you would have to be pretty talented to splash water on yourself while using a squat toilet in Japan.|`|AA10662056	Haha, I don't know any way to prevent it.<br>  <br>  I have not been using it for more than 10 years. But I used to use it in the past. I don't remember I was doing something to prevent it.|`|dc6b4bfdb75c28be32d965d3d43e476daa	Get your rear end low enough so you don't get "small change".<br>  It becomes difficult as you grow older or if you have a knee problem.  That's why western style toilet has become the norm in Japan.|`|GTAKIE9kaa	aim properly and stay close. it not as long as you think|`|W8QpLEh8aa	if my memory of using that type of toilet serves correctly then so called お釣り is a problem unique to western toilets. Avoiding to use washiki isnt a big deal given the current situation, since can choose either washiki or yoshiki at a restroom in public, school, station, or whatever. anyway, please listen to old japanese for i am quite young for the question.|`|kmDaI6Fcaa	I think it's better the way they do it cause when I need to use the rest room I always find it irresponsible that others don't take care of their mess even if they seen they left one. I what people in Japan do so I don't risk getting real sick. ^_^ Japan is such a clean country and care for other people going into restrooms!|`|de8847b0e6acfe0657f1f3e89b72f62eaa	The only thing that's good about the Japanese style is that it does not involve direct body contact with the crapper that you never know who used before you.<br>  When the crapper (Western style) looks dirty, I stand on the edge of the stool, squat, and do the business the Japanese way so my butt does not make contact with it.|`|0j9nfbaIaa	Why bother?

In addition, consider the reasonable pace.  Obviously, too quick action would be quite more dangerous based on the relativity theory.

If the hotel has a swimming pool take swimmers. <br>  Hope you have a great time. <br>  You can put specific clothes if you know what you are doing at a particular time eg going out for a meal.<br>  Don't forget toiletries, shoes, book, phone charger, any medication.|`|XUOMwpQ1aa	3 Boxers and 3 pairs of socks is good.<br>  <br>  You only need 1 pair of Jeans as you can wear them more then once. If you bring shorts or track pants, its best to bring 1 or so of them. If your going somewhere cold, I would take 3 undershirts, but if not, don't worry. You only need 1 jacket (as long as it matches everything) One pair of pyjama's is fine, unless... you're sleeping in mud... or... dirt...<br>  <br>  And shoes - bring 2 pairs, one for walking around (if hiking) and 1 for hotel (or where ever your staying) use (slippers or something).<br>  <br>  I hope I helped! :)|`|c9NuCZnaaa	It depends where you're going. If it's like a hotel or somewhere then yeh 3 pairs of everything will be fine although i'd take some spares in case they get dirty. if you wear pyjamas then just take one pair.<br>  If it's somewhere like the outdoors you need to take as little as possible.  2 of everything should be sufficient but take 4 pairs of socks. you can hurt your feet really badly if they get cold and wet. so spares are always handy.<br>  enjoy your trip!|`|Oh4anhKsaa	3 days worth|`|CLndtRtPaa	Bring some dressy clothes, too. Don't forget toiletries, enough to keep yourself nice. Bring one set to sleep in of boxers and t-shirt if you want, plus pajamas. Have a nice time! And, as you ALWAYS should, in case of spillage or a little kid barfs on you, have a simple pair of compact shorts like athletic shorts and a t-shirt. Underwear and socks, too. Be prepared, and hope for the aisle seat!!! (TIP: if you are there first, just go in the aisle seat and when others come, leave your stuff but stand up. They will sit where you dont want to. : D|`|4LjXNVLHaa	We always bring too much clothes. If it's a kind of business trip, so don't hesitate to ask if there a 'dress code' it helps.

Klp0Mv6kaa	"I have no other Country",thank you for the great video.Don′t pay attention to all this arab hissing;they have nothing to say,so they are writing their usual set of stupidities which would make even the sand lizzards in Palestine die of laughter.|`|Fb519XJgaa	The true story, Israel is the last unsolved colony in the world. The world is trying to solve that colonial conflict by creating 2 states: one for the natives and one for the colonists who came to the land from other countries.|`|Uac9AXmDaa	It is occupation, but not to the extreme like the holocaust. <br>  I have heard it from Israelis themselves. It is an occupation.|`|2bx5l56caa	I find it utterly ridiculous to deny that Israel is occupying the Golan Heights, the West Bank, and arguably Gaza. Thats the problem with these right wing fanatics, just because theres a connection to the land for over 3,000 years doesn't mean you can go back and take whatever you want. <br>  <br>  Israel is Israel, Palestine is Palestine. Returning to the biblical borders of Israel would take an all out war, and we should go on morality for the states creation, not abrogated history for the conquering of others' lands.|`|luWMdsrOaa	Israel is the only known country in all of history and across the entire world to come into existence via legal and beneficial land development (as opposed to the almost universal method of conquest). Israel's victory in the 1948 war and in the 6-day war, in which it was the victim of genocidal aggression, and the refusal of Arab nations to join it in peace negotiations, give Israel the legal right to maintain its sovereignty over its newly won territories, and to develop those territories in any manner that is not prejudicial to the well-being of the indigenous civilians. Had Arab leadership been amenable to peace with Israel, there could have been a Palestinian state in 1937, and again in 1947, and again in 1949; and there would never have been an Arab refugee problem. Had Arab leadership in 1967 been amenable to peace with Israel, there would never have been a continued Israeli sovereignty over the disputed territories of the West Bank and Gaza Strip. <br>  <br>  Between 1948-1967, Jordan and Egypt, who governed the West Bank and Gaza, respectively, never offered to surrender those lands to form an independent Palestinian state. No Palestinian organization ever sought an independent state. No Arab country had even suggested its existence. An Arab Palestine has never been the name of any nation or state. 'Palestine' was a geographical term used only to identify administrative boundaries within larger empires, nothing more.<br>  <br>  In a March 31, 1977 interview with the Amsterdam-based newspaper Dagblad de Verdieping Trouw, PLO executive committee member Zahir Muhse'in said: <br>  <br>  "The Palestinian people does not exist. The creation of a Palestinian state is only a means for continuing our struggle against the state of Israel for our Arab unity. In reality today there is no difference between Jordanians, Palestinians, Syrians and Lebanese. Only for political and tactical reasons do we speak today about the existence of a Palestinian people, since Arab national interests demand that we posit the existence of a distinct 'Palestinian people' to oppose Zionism. For tactical reasons, Jordan, which is a sovereign state with defined borders, cannot raise claims to Haifa and Jaffa, while as a Palestinian, I can undoubtedly demand Haifa, Jaffa, Beer-Sheva and Jerusalem. However, the moment we reclaim our right to all of Palestine, we will not wait even a minute to unite Palestine and Jordan."|`|iCMrsV9daa	The first 2 answers totally killed it ! <br>  lol i have nothing more to add to that.|`|SKPhnLuBaa	The more you bring this nonsense up dude, the more jew lies are revealed here.<br>  let me tell you boy, this ain't no NJ private bookstore where you can sell any fake piece of script.<br>  This is the internet, OK?<br>  So, I advise you stop posting crazy things and try to be reasonable with yourself and us.<br>  Nobody has the time to read some 2 bit jewish crapware propaganda, just because you decided to do so.<br>  Use Preparation H, It does wonders that's for sure. it's shark oil.<br>  The machine

That is why dentists tell you NOT to chew gum!<br>  <br>  Gum is just tons of sugar, and even the gum that is sugarless pushes sugars and enzymes that would otherwise be rinsed off your teeth, back onto them, and into the gums. <br>  <br>  If you MUST chew gum, sugarless is the way to go, whether ordinary or bubble style, but you should limit yourself to only doing so infrequently.|`|NXBmcEz7aa	Both are not good for the teeth, not good for the environment (that's why they are forbidden in Singapore)  and not good for your pocket money either.

That was Rock n' Roll Kids! That song always brings a little tear to our eyes what with Johnny being in love with the girl next door and Mary being down at the record store, and they're not wanting to be round us no more.<br>  Sher aren't they entitled to have their nose out of joint by Riverdance stealing their limelight?!|`|egqveuPjaa	I like it!

Of course they can't get a nice singer with a nice song. The last one was when Riverdance was on, but of course the Riverdance thing stole the whole show. Very sour grapes on the part of the musicians, apparently.

0ZfZulnzaa	They can find out the information if they do a detailed check on you, as can the US customs on your way back home. <br>  <br>  You have not fulfilled the conditions of your probation which means you are not supposed to leave the country with that hanging over your head<br>  <br>  If you are willing to pay the price then try it. And then you can let us all know what happens when you try to cross the border with a warrant (since a lot of people like to ask this question)|`|4INE794zaa	Exactly how many times do you plan on asking this question? Are you hoping to get different answers this time around, that might be more satisfactory? <br>  Yes, they can easily find out about a warrant, and yes they will detain you, until the American authorities come and collect you. Your chances are 50/50 when crossing the border by land, as you do not require a passport yet, but on flights into Canada, you must have a passport so they chances of your getting caught is 100%. Do you really want to risk it for a vacation?<br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  PS. As you mention you are on parole, depending on the nature of your offense, you may be already ineligible to come into Canada anyways.|`|ade3d3f3ca191c9247976e755ae8c508aa	So, you want to come to Canada so you can avoid completing your probation. right?<br>  <br>  And you think you can actually get away with that, right?<br>  <br>  Wrong!<br>  <br>  We don't want criminals here any more than anyone else does so do the right thing and suffer the consequences of your own hubris.|`|2wyDALHgaa	Ok, lets answer this question again for you.  YES, the border officials on either side can find out about your warrant.  And if you are currently on probation you will be in for yet another violation if you choose to leave the US and enter Canada.  I'm sure that goes against your probation order in some way.|`|R5LuKSUXaa	Maybe...Maybe not.  My friend didn't know he had a warrant and crossed the canadian border lots.

Try Mexico.|`|xMnN99T8aa	The Canadian border is an imaginary line dividing our two countries, and I doubt that it cares about your warrant. If you get caught fleeing a warrant by Canadian customs, they will hold you for the US authorities. Every cars license plate is checked by computer as you cross the border. I personally would arrest you for your crimes against the English language.|`|AzKUBp2Jaa	the border couldn't but the border officials can!<br>  as will US customs<br>  (the two countries share records to prevent people who have criminal<br>  records to enter Canada|`|mLU3DkTKaa	NO NO AND NO .

496f5606031f1da1dd8b5f7b0600439aaa	While I think the newspaper has exaggerated their figures there are far to many incidences of verbal sexually orientated comments made towards females in Egypt.<br>  I've thought a lot about this situation and have come to the conclusion it is mostly macho bravado with no ill intent.<br>  From my experience most instances come from groups of young males,not individuals.I have also found if you confront them about the comments or pseudo "compliments" they will totally back off and their embarrassment is almost tangible.<br>  Wearing hajib does not disuade some as I've been told by a would be Romeo that I have the eyes of Nefertiti and the mouth of Isis. <br>  My answer to this was."And you have the mind of an Apis bull.'<br>  I advise any female tourist to report the offfender to the tourist police and there is usually at least one in sight and /or confront them and ask "How would you like it if my husband/brother (which ever you feel applies) said that to your wife or sister?" <br>  Believe me it works every time specially if you say it out loud or in Arabic,they become like little boys totally embarrassed|`|LwqM7EHVaa	60% of Egyptian women get sexually harassed, and those who say that this article isn't true are either homosexual, if they are guys, or ugly girls.. But no worries, it's not as bad as you think, they just stare and try to hook up with you, if you totally ignore them, they won't follow you anymore..|`|hhhk499qaa	No that's not true. Well we'll say that 20% of women are harassed from men in Egypt.|`|ravzJTVOaa	this is a big lie .|`|0pM85b5Baa	I think this 90% and 80% are not true or at least not accurate. <br>  <br>  I agree with Sistablu and I would like to add that in most cases people are speaking or doing that without real harmful intentions. I would go far and tell you that I heard many guys say "they like that" it doesn't mean I agree with what they say. I just mentioned what some young and old guys think. I can tell you about many real examples when guys from different ages said that. That means there is something wrong in their mentality Yes. <br>  <br>  First let us not generalise it and think that the majority of males in Egypt are doing this. May be it's bad and disturbing but still this is not the majority. It's just like a criminal attitude when it happens, all the city is worried. <br>  <br>  Second we should think about what to do and when it can be suitable to do what. I agree with Sistablu that tourists should directly inform the tourist police even if they didn't do it in time. Do it even on line and inform them about the area and the guy or guys who did it in case you can remember his face. If the victim were completely negative, this attitude will increase as those guys always say "females are not angry with it and they like that comments" <br>  <br>  3rd in case the situation is not dangerous like dark street or no one in the area, the female should act bravely and show the guy any move or even give the impression that she is very angry and she might do something more effective to stop it. I mean she shouldn't do that while she is passing very close to the guy or that he can easily harm her while nobody can see him. <br>  Even if there is no police in the area and she is worried to face the situation alone, try to ask the people around specially older people to help or ask for police.  <br>  <br>  If all females acted positively for sometime, all those young guys will not do it like fun. Let them be worried that they will be punished for this attitude and you'll never hear about it in newspapers again. <br>  <br>  I know tourists are coming to enjoy their trips and tours, but we should all be positive to get away bad guys from disturbing our life.|`|cKbeUeUeaa	This is soooo true!!<br>   I got sexual harassed many times in egypt and yes this is true ,i even saw other ppl being harassed ,so don't try to avoid believing it bcuz its so true, i mean it became part of the egyptian culture and egyptians in their movies are encouraging it!! so this article is completely true and don't believe moonrise!|`|SZESejHRaa	<a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kHrIdzL8J7I" rel="nofollow">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kHrIdzL8J...</a>|`|ifwGlKETaa	Yikes. . .|`|bnRDldxbaa	I agree with Sistablu, she spoke well about the situation.|`|43b4f93a63d1a5f538232f1ddc8bf9f6aa	if it's true then WOOWW! that's a lot of harrasement!<br>  <br>  nah, I don't think it's true.

Hotels can range from as low as $40 a night for a cheap, ugly, dirty fleabag motel, to several hundred dollars a night for a luxury suite at an exclusive hotel resort.<br>  <br>  Look around your neighborhood and see what hotel chains are nearly - Holiday Inn, Best Western, Motel 6, whatever there may be. You can go to their websites and put in the dates when your friend would be visiting you to find out the rates they would charge.

a0bfcb692e6a31a63435a6420bd941e3aa	Backpack, water (cave water is often not too tasty or drinkable)... flexible pants that have good insulation but won't chafe and that you don't mind getting a bit worn (you'll be scuffing rocks and might be wading through ice cold water depending on the cave and the level of spelunking your friend does). Wear a good pair of hiking boots / tennis shoes that meet the same expectations as the pants (but good shoes are a must because they may be put under a lot of stress... I once had a pair fall apart on me). Hiking boots are more ideal than tennis shoes given the ankle supports / traction.<br>  <br>  She should provide you with a light but you should have a backup... backups are a bit important in case... well, do you want to get stuck underground with no way out if her light fails?<br>  <br>  You will probably want a light jacket that is easily removable depending on the depth you descend and the level of activity.

1882488edb530b61a28da937bd5617a2aa	If you think you are being scammed here are somethings to look for :<br>  <br>  1) Did you met her on match or yahoo. If so stay away! Those sites require a credit card to join. Few Russians do not use credit cards and those that have one do not use them to join dating sites.<br>  2) In order for her to come over on a K-1 visa you will have to go there to meet her first. So if she says she wants to come over to meet you it more than likely a scam.<br>  3) She ask for money! Definitely a scam. <br>  4) Phone calls. If she calls you or will not give you a contact number it is definitely a scam. The reason she is calling you is so you will not know where she is calling from. Some scammers actually live in the US.<br>  <br>  There are sites available that you can check to see if she is on there as well.

Or you are the type whose just like to roam around the city then you can visit Bangkok it is more like the usual city but new city to you... then you fine lots of recreation. lastly if you want beaches then you have to visit south part of Thailand like Phuket; Samui Island and Krabi. or otherwise you can visit www.thaiairways.com is has lot of packages offered w/reasonable prices... good luck and Happy trip.

And then setelah RS Harapan Kita anda akan menemukan Gedung BCA Slipi anda berbelok ke kiri dan menemui jalan ke arah Petamburan. Then ikuti jalan setelah menemui perempatan anda berbelok ke kiri, naik jembatan (fly over) dan menemui lampu merah anda ambil lajur paling kiri. Setelah itu anda berbelok ke kiri dan mengambil lajur paling kanan. then and melewati under pass tanah abang, lalu sebelah kiri anda ada Rumah Susun Tanah Abang, setelah itu sebelum lampu merah anda berbelok ke kiri dan kira2 500 meter anda sudah menemui Grand Indonesia di sebelah kanan jalan dan Plaza Indonesia di sebelah kiri ....

4INE794zaa	If you are a resident/citizen (even living in a different country) of Canada,  then yes, you may apply and receive the CCTB. One, or both parents must be Canadian, as well as the child.  Check these links to confirm what I have said:|`|0ZfZulnzaa	The only way you can collect Child Tax Benefit while living out of the country is if you file Canadian Taxes. If  you are not paying taxes in Canada you are not eligible for benefits until you return back to Canada to live. <br>  <br>  ***Who is eligible for the CCTB?<br>  <br>  You have to be the person who is mainly responsible for the care and upbringing of the child. This means you are responsible for the child's daily activities and needs, making sure the child's medical needs are met, arranging for child care when necessary, and so on. If the female parent lives with the child, the government usually consider her to be this person. However, it can be the father, a grandparent, or a guardian.<br>  <br>  You have to live with the child and be a resident of Canada for income tax purposes.<br>  <br>  In addition, you and/or your spouse or common-law partner must be a:<br>  <br>      * Canadian citizen;<br>      * Permanent resident (often called "landed immigrant");<br>      * Protected person (refugee); or<br>      * Temporary resident (such as a foreign worker, foreign student or Temporary Resident Permit holder) who has lived in Canada for the previous 18 months. ***|`|2wyDALHgaa	Actually, Jim B is incorrect depending upon what benefits you are referring to and what your citizenship is.  <br>  <br>  My family and I lived in India for three years and during that time my wife and I had a baby daughter.  She was not even born in Canada but she was a Canadian citizen (as were my wife and I).  Since we were not living in Canada during that time she was not entitled to a health care card since we were not affiliated with any Province but we were entitled to collect "baby bonus" payments for her.  At first we were told by the office that we did not qualify however they were wrong and once we appealed the decision we were given the payments backdated to the day she was born.  Keep in mind as well that as expat Canadians we were also still filing Canadian taxes so that may make a difference as well.<br>  <br>  If you do move back to Canada you should be able to receive certain benefits for her such as health care but that will depend upon the rules of the Province you reside in and they will not be automatic.  There is normally a 3 month waiting period  but again, that depends upon the circumstances and the Provincial rules.|`|DTNlqnOEaa	Simple answer NO.<br>  <br>  You must be living  " in Canada " to get benefits, as the cheque cannot be mailed to an address  outside of Canada. <br>  <br>  Jim b.

As an acclaimed historian I have heard countless accounts of victims of their crime surge, all comparable to the likes of other famous gangs (i.e. Cryps and Bloods).  They are most famous for their infamous Bank of Tel Aviv robbery that left 2 dead and 3 crucified.  It also led to the downfall of the Bank of Tel Aviv which had invested millions in to the movie industry.  It is believed that the bonds which they stole would be invested in their children's future leading to the Jew overthrow of the movie industry.|`|qC0qeZaXaa	Right outside of Philly in like Delaware county, Jamie Foxx and Catherine Zeta Jones are filming a movie with some scenes at the Delaware County Jail.

KS2OHXCRaa	For four adults, if you take the shuttle bus, it's going to cost you 68euro (17euro per person) - child under 3 goes for free - with the VEA shuttle bus service. <br>  <br>  There is private shuttle service (kinda like a taxi, <a href="http://www.parisshuttleservice.com/Disneyland-Shuttle-service.asp" rel="nofollow">http://www.parisshuttleservice.com/Disne...</a> ) and they charge a little more than the shuttle bus, at 20euro per person when there's at least 4 person travelling together. The benefit of this is you don't have to worry about the bus timetable, and you're not wasting time while the bus goes from terminal to terminal to collect all the passengers, and from hotel to hotel as they drop passengers off. This is worth taking in my opinion.<br>  <br>  Most other taxi services that I can find information on cost anything between 90-120euro for 4 adults and 1 child. And to flag a taxi at the terminal comes with its own risk, especially if there's traffic problem. The rate for flagged taxi outside the terminal is 1.14euro per km, with 1euro luggage supplement per luggage (1st one free), and a 4th adult supplement of 2.95euro as well. The distance between CDG and Disneyland is between 40-45km, depending on the route taken by the driver I guess. In event of traffic problems and the taxi is moving slowly, the meter will run at the rate of 32.70euro per hour (therefore nearly 55 cents per minute).<br>  <br>  There are complimentary toilettries in the bathroom. <br>  <br>  The weather in March can be rather unpredictable and in the past I've found that March can be quite wet too. Remember that at Disneyland you'll be outdoor most of the time, and even if it's not particularly cold, after an hour or so, you are going to feel the chill. So bring a good coat, definitely warm tops, the jeans and trainers would be fine. Also, don't forget the gloves, scarves and hats. No harm having a rain coat too actually. <br>  <br>  Have fun!|`|94b8KImYaa	below is a link for booking a taxi and the fare, below that is the link for the shuttle bus. <br>  <br>  Regarding the clothes, if you do not want to have a gala night out, then I guess what you plan to take is fine.

Seriously, safety comes from within you.<br>  <br>  But in general, the North Shore. Devonport in particular.
00fykZS0aa	Denver. Definitely.  There is so much to do in and around Denver, whether you visit in the summer or winter.  Ski in winter.  Go hiking in summer.  Snowshoeing in winter.  Rockies games in summer.  Rocky Mountain National Park anytime of the year.  Concerts at Red Rocks, possibly one of the most beautiful ampitheaters in the US!  There are great bars in downtown Denver & great restaurants too.  I think you need to ask yourself what you'd like to be doing on your vacation - walking around museums?  Laying by a pool?  Hiking a mountain?  Taking a scenic drive?  Shopping?  <br>  Have fun wherever you go!|`|tdiyhf68aa	denver|`|ZPRhLZdfaa	I would say Atlanta. Pheonix is too hot  and Denver is too cold.
