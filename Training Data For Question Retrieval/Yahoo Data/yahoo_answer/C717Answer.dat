I'm ready to meet her,but I'm worried a bit,because I've been out waiting many times,but she says that she'll come. and I start thinking of gays who are good at hacking other people's PCs or me being mentally sick or hallucinating.
MX1shAbcaa	Sounds like an immature kid, leave him alone.  ~William|`|YbilKhbNaa	woh! the exact same thing happened to me ! :P except my friend wanted to find out something about the guy so she told him someone liked him and he would find out once he told her what she wanted to know :P anyways back on track. he probably doesn't think of you like that. just don't make it awkward or else it will never get better. talk to him, and don't show weakness or else it will only get worse. trust me it works :) i think the same way that you do but once you get talking to him it won't be awkward. good luck hun :)|`|rSXRBEaCaa	let him go if he doesnt like you...thats really stupid of him, but you cant make someone like you... there are better people hun...and you sound really nice so you shouldnt have any trouble!!    good luck!|`|udbEljJsaa	Keep your cool when he's around you, and make small talk to see if you have anything in common.. it might turn out that he does like you and is just nervous like you are!|`|v9ihmSoNaa	just go up to the person and be like'' HEY I LIKE YOU"
MFKgVsoAaa	hmmm.... how about going to watch a movie and then fancy dinner? that's always fun. ooh, or a midnight picnic under the stars (: cheesy, but romantic. or if you guys have like a special place or something, go there and have a little picnic. have fun! happy valentine's day!!
LRbM2cXhaa	Did you talk about it before hand and is there room?    I know in my situation I talked with my fiance, now wife about visitors.  We have a guest bedroom just for them.  They have a private room, and a bathroom in the main hall.  all separate from the master bed/bath.  There should be no issues.    I personally see no problems.  My wife did bring up hosting her male ex-co-worker in case of a layoff.  I was ok as long as a time frame was set.  That never happened, but I did approve of it just in case.|`|oLTUn51Uaa	lets get 2 da point, dis is real life, not t.v., u wanna help ur friend, i understand but it's gonna be akward esp w/ ur boyfriend n ur friend, it's not cool but thats how it is|`|soINlW2iaa	id be wondering why she couldnt find another female to stay with yes. my then again my husband loves to fall into these situations and when the woman declares it was for him he ends up feeling nasty and telling her to sling her hook!|`|mGKQY6OPaa	2 girls 1 guy....2 girls 1 cup! with a guy included of course it all adds up!!!!|`|JjU6IdnDaa	Every relationship is unique.      Friendship is matter of integrity and intellectual strength.  It requires the friend in need to have other options than a friend who lives with her fiance.    The potential marriage partners require space and time for interactive definition.  Couples enjoy privacy while developing romantic parameters of pleasure.    The opposite sex guest should respect the dynamics of the engaged couple.    I personally would help my friend find a temporary situation that was less intrusive.  My friend and the fiance would understand how and why the friend is being helped.|`|mCUNl9Wgaa	It'd be kind of weird, especially if left alone together for too long. I say no to opposite sex houseguests. If my husband brought home a woman, I would say no WAY.|`|sIdoUK2Laa	wouldn't like it to be honest|`|vBkGGYJSaa	be wondering if you were interested in having sex with him.
AA11425983	Well....if they want to do a lot of stuff...they think that a girl who has done that stuff before is more likely to than a girl who has not.    I'm a virgin, and I want a guy who is the same.|`|EuFNCVG6aa	A lot of men prefer virgins...but it depends on the individual.      PLEASE answer my question.............  http://uk.answers.yahoo.com/question/ind...|`|UvJ9mPlZaa	I guess it doesn't really matter as long as you love each other but ideally I don't think any man wants a woman who as seen more c*ck ends than weekends!|`|7XIa76Usaa	Most guys don't care but for myself I don't want a virgin. I prefer a non-virgin because I am well endowed and don't want to hurt the lady I am with.|`|MC1V0VDuaa	yes they prefer virgins when it comes to a girls that they really like or have fallen for. but they don't care if its a girl the don't really care about|`|jHd3irvDaa	it doesnt really matter to me, but som people r different so yeah.|`|95b3c1cab8a1f1f08d03b46eefc17755aa	It's completely immaterial.    Do not do what a guy wants just because HE likes YOU, what's important is that YOU like HIM and that you discover together what you both like.     Don't have sex just to be able to say you're not a virgin. Honestly, it should not matter in the slightest.|`|lMKy9Ho8aa	that is so NOT true! too many diseases, stds and hiv, out there to be sleeping around with alot of people!
Wt62GmgRaa	they are pretty normal. Most deserving women feel the same way as you. I can definetely relate you to my ex, lol. Good luck.|`|oNPmGK0paa	they are.  I'm an independent person but we all want to be loved sometimes|`|ZAnDf4vraa	Oh their normal. I've been feeling like that for 8 years, ever since my mother (who was meant to love me) abandoned me at the age of eight.  But I say, who need parents/partner? You can only ever depend on yourself. It's a harsh world, and it can do some real harsh things.|`|nf45Bxpkaa	Im 21 and feel exactly like you do.... so it sounds like your feelings are normal. But look at it this way... least you know what you want from a guy.... this will stop you from getting hurt.|`|5A7RmIH6aa	trust is  1  love 2    being there very important
LkRivHpTaa	yeah ask her oput to dinner then bang her|`|SHEhwsUaaa	major sign that she likes you. most of the tie girls can never look a guy in the eyes if they like then(especially if their shy)LOL i would so go for it!LOL GOOD LUCK BABE!|`|ptg3fzmtaa	i think she like gettin attention from you|`|ikrxncw2aa	yes most defiantly that's what girls do
Lnt4u4q6aa	how is it you are dating but your arent bf and gf ?    how old are you ?    why is being in a relationship so important ?    you have kissed. you like each other, and he wants to  get to know you better.  it all makes sense to me.  be glad you have such a nice boy who isnt pushing you to do thigns you dont want !  Get to know him at his speed and just enjoy your time together. try not to complicate things....|`|wpilM8Hiaa	I wouldn't be worried. My now fiance didn't tell me he loved me until 2 years into our relationship! Now we are getting married! So I think you should hold out for a little longer!|`|AA12359831	you dont have anything to worry about.  me and this guy werent dating and we kissed. and he didnt feel that it was the right thing since we werent going out. and now we are :) so just be paitent.
LkRivHpTaa	go to parties get wasted and bang guys
soINlW2iaa	year one is paper. so if shes good at origami something out of that if not. may i suggest a letter listing how perfect he is.
07fhLLr8aa	yeah that is wrong. just to tell you just cause she preggers dont mean she cant get preganant still!  always use protection. she could have another baby growing inside her including the baby she already has.|`|e1BkGiOYaa	wait..she's pregnant?  what the hell?   and in my own opinion, i think she's  just looking for a dad that will help her pay for the baby.|`|OKjYOr0xaa	yes it is wrong|`|ZkvcPjw4aa	omg !! yesss this is wrong !!  firts of all, you should be using protection  because of STDs !!!! it does matter !  also, if you are not the father, she might want you to  step in to be the father since she's lusting after you.  and if you are not ready to play that role, it could put you  in a difficult and awkward position with her. So i suggest you and this girl  just stay FRIENDS. unless, your ready to help take care of her baby.
xZBroXsQaa	The minute it becomes medically unsafe it's wrong. If you lead her on, or make her think you'll be there after the baby is born (and if you have no intention of doing so) it's wrong. As long as she knows you're only in it for the 'friends with benefits' and that's all, and she's totally okay with that, and knows you won't be in any way the child's father substitute, it's okay. (Unless of course, you're planning to stay by her and her child for the next 18 years). There are actually hormones going crazy in the female body during pregnancy, so the whole lusting after you might come to an end or mellow out after things change or level out during the pregnancy.|`|sZ1xbQXlaa	yeah
vjmXiIfnaa	You've eliminated all options for sexual satisfaction.    -You don't want to mess around with spontaneity. Therefore you would need a girlfriend. You don't want a girlfriend, though, or at least you don't want to try and find one.   -Masturbation, but you don't want that either.      Mingle more, you're going to have to find someone you want to get to know and spend time with in order to form a relationship and be intimate.|`|M3CsxF2jaa	jack off|`|5A7RmIH6aa	pound the clown|`|Zynzkj1raa	If you don't want a girlfriend, you don't want to masturbate, you don't want to go to prostitues, and you don't want to sleep with anyone, and you can't have a good relationship yet,  and you have sexual urges...  then, hon...  there's really nothing you can do.|`|QZLzCWKDaa	jack off|`|0PkFuZMwaa	just wait your soulmate will come soon as you settle down.|`|n2dAV5pmaa	you may have to go and see a psychiatrist.  your urges are just normal but you will need to learn how to control it.|`|1Q93EMTwaa	find a sex buddy hehe. or just someone u can mess around with, but of course u can sleep with others! like an open relationship xx|`|Wt62GmgRaa	get a girlfriend cuz that is the case!!!. lets face it most of the girls at Bars you dont have a shot at or are immature. You dont want to get a prosititute or just masturbate, because your better than that. Soo buddy thats your only option. Well unless if you find a FWB (friend with benefits). than you might be in luck lol cuz its just all fun and nothing serious and your not really sleep around since it is the same person and your both satisfying your urges.|`|fLFaja7laa	Jack off
m0Q1i7UTaa	Sit down on the couch.  If he sits far away from you just ask him to scooch a little closer.  The maybe touch his hand and see if he grabs yours.  If he doesn't then grab his.  Then just talk and let him get used to it.  He'll discover how great it feels to be close to you (that is if he really likes you) and he'll want to do it again.    Then another day when you are hanging out with him, tell him how much you like him and that you want to show how much you do by hugging him.  Ask him if that would be alright with him if you guys do that.  If he doesn't want to then wait awhile until he gets more comfortable around you.    The main thing is just give it time.  I used to be sooooo shy around my girlfriend but no I can't wait to hold her hand and hug her!    (And by the way... if you guys start hugging, don't make it an everyday thing, make it so its a really special thing that you do only when you are alone.  He'll love it ten times more)    Hope this helps!!!!!    ;-)|`|r4nBWJwLaa	i had the exact same problem. you need to take it step by step.gently brush his shoulder or chest with your fingertips or give him a reason to hug you or hold your hand. girls can make the first move! if nothing works, just consult him and tell him how much it means to you. hope it works out :)|`|M3CsxF2jaa	grab his hand and force yourself on him sometime he will be happy and will get more comfortable. let him know i wanna be held sometime|`|IZJSuShbaa	you hug him first, then smile to show YOU feel its right. so then HE will feel its right.|`|a5b833f1cecfc7eab7869f5ea4fe43f1aa	The only thing you can do is be patient. My bf used to be uncomfortable holding my hand, but I explained to him that it meant a lot to me. He eventually got over it and now we hold hands all the time!     Just talk to him and tell him you'd like to be more comfortable around each other.|`|rSXRBEaCaa	just hold his hand...if he really loves you, he will do it...hug him...if he really loves you, he will do it...hang out with him...if he really loves you, he will do it :)    good luck!|`|d4f7a89688a581eea0b65f858f25f2daaa	You may need to start the process - you can touch his shoulder and brush against him from time to time...  or just put your hand in his hand -- he is not sure of your intentions and is afraid of rejection.    So if you show him its Ok - he will be more confident!|`|y9RKDwvdaa	take the lead...hug HIM and hold HIS hand  dont make him do everything|`|9siwOmrfaa	Flirt with him...try to hold his hand sometimes...Let him know that you're okay with it because the main reason guys get shy is because they are afraid of rejection. Give him a hint or so like hold his hand for a second and start giggling then put it back down, and he will eventually go for the reach. And when you see him, greet him with your arms wide open.|`|ptg3fzmtaa	you guys should try to get comfortable together when its just the two of you when you guys are like watchin a movie or somthing and then try to get him used to holding hands and etc.
6fxcZfYxaa	u should talk 2 him about it i have the same prob with 1 of my guy friends x cept we dont compete he just ignores me and whenever were not around his friends hes really nice|`|ygimTNzoaa	Maybe hes waiting for you to make to move and you're just frustrating him. I could be very wrong though. You sound mature enough to make the right decision. These are the fun days where you can be like this with someone you like. I'm not sure how to go about it, because I was like that with one guy, but much to shy to say anything to him about it. He ended up moving middle of sophomore year. I'm kind've happy I didnt start anything because I'dve been devastated, though I was sad as it was. I hope you figure something out. Good luck.|`|wyRJofXJaa	flash him|`|oCG2JxsEaa	sound like you like him and he likes you. i say ask him if he likes you then go out with him. if not talk to him about being friends no rivals. hope this helps!|`|LSrxN4Qnaa	uh its pretty obvious that he likes you so why don't you ask him out... and if you're not willing to take that risk, then just talk it over with him. just talk|`|cmFU81rQaa	the rivalry is the friendship.  I mean it's good.  It's a positive rivalry.  I don't see the problem.|`|vRswFr1Raa	ask him what he thinks about you|`|MqoQiLcuaa	Kiss him.|`|aL0uWmSLaa	well what i would say if the guy is ignoring u then forget about him u don't deserve to get treated like that no one does but if u are intent on getting your friendship back to the way it was then just keep doing what u are doing u guys sound like u have a lot of fun together and enjoy each others company so just keep up the friend thing and who knows he's probably just nervous to ask u out which i think he will pretty soon good luck    Hope i could help :)|`|n2dAV5pmaa	sounds like puppy love.  you should go up to him and tell him how you feel. he knows that you like him but he rather hear it from you. it will make him feel special.
om2lE7jfaa	well first of all chances are you are in some far back hick country anywayz, so know1 is going to notice if you take her out for a "hunting" trip then when you get in the woods kill her bury her, and tell every1 a bear attacked you two and carried her off, you tried to help but he knocked you out cold with 1 swipe of is giant paw, also it might help if you beat urself up a bit so it looks true, you deserve it anywayz for sleeping with her.|`|ZeE8rzQHaa	Hmm interesting, Let me suggest that you hook me up with your sister and if she gets pregnant just say its mine but you would have to pay for all the expences.|`|SHEhwsUaaa	ew that is gross you sicko, but i doubt it is true, even if it wasn't why would you think about that? and if it is true you need to get help from someone very very quickly and i don't mean from your sister in the bed!LOL get a life!|`|6BwCwuHwaa	your freaking insane and really nasty your mom should slap both of you  Ew. ! Get help|`|X5fEQGgNaa	excellent question.    since she is really hot, this is acceptable.  but since she is now impregnated with your genetically impeded child, you should hit that big red abort button immediately.    after you have successfully backalley'ed this colossal mess you have an important choice to make.  move to Alabama so you can have your ugly little inbred babies when the time is right (since they are the only state where you will find refuge) or be a man and take your final curtain call and snuff out the two of you.  actually, you should probably give the whole family the dirt nap just to be safe.    cheers!

4IFXHz80aa	Hmmm....well i dont think theres a right or wrong answer to this. i mean, pregnant women have cravings and needs too. why should you not? are you going to stay with her during her pregnancy? or are you gonna bounce once she starts showing? how committed are you? i think you should answer these questions and then decide if youre doing her a service or disservice. if your committed and you guys decide that is gonna be just a friends with benefits thing then i dont see why itll be an issue. but be prepared for any attachment that might come from her and possible you. shes pregnant for one (emotions) and she has already had once guy leave her. a second guy might devastate her and shell feel even more abandoned. just be cautious.|`|soINlW2iaa	are you going to step up to the plate be in a relationship with her and be a father to  the child if so bravo!  if not yes its wrong your using her hormones to your advantage.|`|xNkmK0SHaa	Have you always been stupid and amoral or just since your little boy parts began to rule your life?

FnQWXyp8aa	Its a good letter, theres a lot of resentment showing through. I dont know if your going to stay with him or not, if you want to, rewrite the letter in a calm and approachable manner, if your not then this letter is perfect, after reading this he might do one of two things. Either be angry and leave you or feel bad and come running back to you. he will run back to you if hes the right one for you. meanwhile, take it to court so he can help pay for the child support whether you stay together or not, his money will help out alot|`|dzyJw0cvaa	Move on.  Start your life with YOUR new child by yourself.  Even if you have to get a noew job, it is not worth marrying an A**hole.  There is no reason he should have treated you the way he did. He is not man enough to be a father OR your partner. You deserve better.  Try to be thankful you didnt find this out after you married him.  Divorce is no fun when custody issues are involved.  You have a chance now, an open road to take without him.  You deserve better.  There is a man out there that would love to be the father of you child and be your partner through out your life. He simply is not the one.    Send him the letter and move on with your life.  Good luck!|`|LkRivHpTaa	get child support from him he has to its the law|`|AA10555331	If I were taking candy from you than I would want the hole store. he's a punk. and  he's no-good.|`|tnIET8fCaa	Wow i really applaud you. I think your doing the right thing on keeping the baby its not the babys fault but you should ask for chil;d sopport from that effin asswhole.

Nobody will know why he was upset, but you certainly still hold your feelings for him, dont throw it away over one incident.

Then if he seems friendly enough calmly ask why he was mad at you or if he wants to get back together. But first just start with hi and see how he reacts first. IF this doesn't work, then quit.|`|woUAjiSRaa	well, it really depends how he feels. when you meet him, just act like you guys are just friends, not bf and gf. and what was he mad at you for?  and how long is he staying here then? if it's just a visit, acting like friends is the best thing. if it's to stay, then you can slowly go with the flow.    but before you do all that, find out how he's like when he comes back. idk what he's mad at you for, but if it's a serious matter, you should at least try to talk to him normally. if it's not all serious, then a little hug can be fine.     by the way, NEVER show your down side about the problem you had before he left or about how much you care about him. if you do that, he'll be able to overpower you and make you feel worse. trust me, i've had my times. just be optimistic when he comes back. show him that you guys have got nothing to worry about.
ETV7yvNbaa	You should tell her...or she will pass you right on by!|`|95b3c1cab8a1f1f08d03b46eefc17755aa	Calm down. She's not that much younger, in the sense that at 31 she is likely to have a lot of sense.    I think you should simply tell her that you have fallen in love with her, and don't be ashamed of this. If she is so sweet and friendly and warm, she will probably deal with it well. I don't know if she will love you back, but people who are genuinely kind and friendly remain so, even if they cannot reciprocate the same feeling.     Take the chance. And if you haven't done it already, get yourself to a therapist to find out what it is that is causing you to suffer low self-esteem and paranoia.|`|5FVyVS9vaa	Go for it.|`|olMVfnljaa	No, this is normal! She's not that much younger than you, but others might think so. Keep her as a friend and see how things go, don't do anything more. Build a bigger social group, and you never know, you might find the woman that you've been waiting for!|`|BDPc9P4Faa	Your only in this life once... what do you really have to lose? Wouldn't you rather die knowing you tried than wondering what she would've said?|`|vrfuO9Asaa	ash her out be her friend|`|VtTU4KcNaa	Are you transgendered or just a troll with a lot of fantasies?    Previous qeustions:  Should I be concerned about younger girlfriend's fantasies?  My partner's friendship with a younger woman makes me feel insecure.  Older man has taken possession of me.  I'm falling in love with my uncle.|`|h6wDmUMWaa	KEEP FRIENDS WITH HER AND TRY TO ACT COOL AROUND HER!|`|w0qMJHiBaa	go for it|`|Wt62GmgRaa	well just jokingly ask her if she is okay with an older man. then you will know what to do. I think women like older men who are more mature, so you have a good chance. But keep it real and ask her that question! plus you don't want to ruin the friendship if she says no. Goodluck, and your not an Old B*stard.
nuef3YTFaa	Well, i wa sin a similar situation as you, and ii told her i liked her, and she said she didn't feel the same way, and we're still friends. So perhaps you should just tell and say it's fine if she just wants to be friends.|`|Hcc9fxqJaa	get a friend of hers to just start up a conversation on who she would go out with and make your name just "pop" up in the conversation|`|ZD4NOw2eaa	your going to have to take a risk. Ask yourself if it worth sacrificing your friendship... If it is break it to her gently dont pressure her into liking you back. Tell her how you feel but dont go over the top.|`|shb1309caa	Take the risk, you'll never know if you don't try, hun. I'm a girl, and if a guy told me he liked me, i wouldn't let things get weird if i didn't like him back. So tel her you like her, ask her to hang out, but make sure it's you who tells her. If she finds out through anyone else, she wont like that you didn't tell her.|`|2k2bnvJ4aa	take a risk. let her know that you like her more than a friend. if she is kinda like, oh well i dont feel the same way, then just say ok. dont get all like oh, woe is me if she doesnt feel the same way. thats how you 2 can stay friends.|`|aL0uWmSLaa	i think that you're gonna have to take a risk bro because if u don't then you'll never know what might have been but what i say is if she doesn't feel the same way and u ask her out if she says no then just keep talking to her like u never even asked her out but i would say she does have an interest in u because people don't go to movies with people they don't like     Hope i could help :)|`|YSmHLAq1aa	just be cool man, if she's your friend they're is nothing to worry about  good luck XD|`|T3qd6UYWaa	OMG,  I have the exact same problem.. except im a girl, trying to figure out the right way to tell my guy friend how i feel.  What you need to do is start flirting with her more, if you don't already. If she starts flirting back, then keep doing it to the point where it seems like you're actually going out with her. Then, when you do tell her, it'll be a lot less of a shock for her to hear, ya know?   But, if she doesn't flirt back or looks uncomfortable when u flirt with her, its probably best to stay friends. B/c most girls will def flirt back with a guy they are interested in. I definitley do :)  Whatever you do, don't be completley blunt and random when ya tell her. Bad idea; a guy did that to me once and it was such a shock i couldn't even say it back.   Hope this helps!! Lemme know if it works :)  now, can you answer my latest question, Please?? You're a guy, who would probably know how to answer it. Look up "Is he flirting with me?"|`|gVbJ8vs9aa	if you love a girl and you need o getto her fr the sake of the love you feel. I will advice you be careful so that not to make a wrong decision. first try to make her fall for you then you can go with confidence but never be shy be courageous if you realy love her. you can get advice on how to achiev this at http://www.ebooks.thehelpster.com/learn-... good luck
Pt9SRn6Jaa	Just try doing things that you wouldnt do if you didnt like him. Like if you dont normally give him hugs then start doing that. just try to get your point across by dropping hints.be flirtatious and you'll get his attention.
dROrlLvhaa	just be yourslef and youll get a girlfriend, playing basketball or doing computer programming have NOTHING to do with it
HnXOEDbcaa	1.) Take him to court. You can most likely get the money back.  2.) Go spend some time with your other friends, maybe even tell them about that, maybe they can help you out, get your mind out by going out, shopping, anything.   3.) He's not a true friend and he wasn't worth your time, forget about him and maybe get a new guy friend.   4.) Maybe even tell the guy how disappointed in him you are and how much you wished you never met him and lend him the money as a friend.   5.) Delete him, ignore him, get rid of the guy as a friend and enemy. Ask for your other friends to get them to tell him the same thing, get them to maybe help you out on ignoring him by going out.    Best of Luck! ?|`|6eSRjnx4aa	2,000???    Holy crap, you really liked this guy.|`|sIdoUK2Laa	you have no choice but to say lesson learned and move on.     just don't do it again.      at least it wasn't 10,000 right?|`|EJKhLW2Baa	i know its illegal but raid his bank account and steal|`|9580a1e44dd3d2bae7d2f867611ab353aa	? Take him to small claims court, in your area and get your money back. Don't let him get by with this, at least attempt to force his hand and make him pay. You'll feel better too if you take him to court because at least you attempted to get your money back. If your not willing to file a small claims case, then it will take time to get past all this. And make sure not to be his friend anymore.. thats just wrong of him. You were being a great friend helping him out like that.. so shame on him!|`|OBemKKwoaa	You fool get the money back, its urs!! then find urself a real man|`|hyyYp6tbaa	NO take him to court girl stick up for yourself 2000!!!!! imagine wat you could have done with that money dont let this a hole get away with this!|`|I08iONdaaa	take him to civil court and sue him. Then you'll be fine. make sure it's small claims though.|`|CdTe8MO4aa	if u somehow still talk to this guy ask him if he wants to pay payments   maybe like 50-100 dollars a month  try and tell him say look if u pay me back maybe in the future ill give you other loans  and when he starts making payments keep the receipts|`|J3VSkIE9aa	well do you have proof that you gave him the money?  the only way your going to get your money back is by sueing him for it. and you probably will always think about it. its sad to think that someone can be so nice and be used by such an a**hole. honestly im sorry he used your kindness to his advatage...get even. take your money back.|`|VC8ivJHjaa	I recommend you go to small claims court and fight to get your $2K back. This will put your mind at ease and MAY prevent this jerk from taking advantage of other people in the future.|`|eUiMXcFcaa	For $2000, you shouldn't just let this go.  Maybe he doesn't have the money right now, so work out a written agreement where he pays you back in monthly installments.  If he continues to be unreasonable, threaten him with a lawsuit.  From now on if you loan anyone a considerable sum of money, be sure to FIRST have a written agreement of how they'll pay you back so you won't be stuck in this situation again.
oCG2JxsEaa	talk to him. i think he has to see your view and if he is mature he will see where you are coming from. hope this helps!|`|M3CsxF2jaa	don't be confused just talk it out|`|EdidZdtlaa	i say wait a while and see what happens if you really start to like him more. if hes not the one then you have to tell him. its hard but thats life.|`|flMOEeNnaa	If you like him enough, age is not a problem. If it is, then just tell him that you respect him enough not to lie to him and tell him that you don't want to go out with him.|`|tsoc9tihaa	one,  what about your 'mate'?    two.  if you want him, stop complaining about his age.   if you were that bothered why did you sleep with him  knowing you were his first  knowing he would get attached.    three  if your so hung up on having some one your age.  stop messing about with him!       so simply :)  make up your mind,,, soon!|`|QZLzCWKDaa	i stoped at "my mate"|`|rSXRBEaCaa	a guy isnt sweet if he dumps your mate the day you slept together... that isnt okay. while you were chatting with him and saying how sweet he was, he was still seeing your mate...thats not okay!  my answer is, dont go with him...    make the right decision and good luck...|`|Qb6vSTfEaa	don't worry about the age. If you like him then go for it. only don't forget about your friends feelings, is it worth it to maybe loose a friend?  my boyfriend is my bfs ex, but were close enough that she forgave me. But yeah i think you should date him, if you really like him, age is a stupid reason to miss out on a guy.
vLRrmVXMaa	why wont they let you perform? im sure they have a good reason. ask them in a calm and respectful way why. if its money or something, you'll have to fix it. if they don't want you doing that kind of thing, act accordingly, but do what they say. they know whats best for you, and i doubt that they don't want you to excel and do your best in life.     good luck |`|soINlW2iaa	well why?  im sorry it needed to be done. unless theres a genuine reason for it id just perform till your hearts content. as well as do work and what not!
bbe6d542c99c3729df16c734b566d4afaa	maybe he thinks silence is what you want from him because you told him that he talks too much.|`|ueAv14FJaa	http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index;...|`|e1BkGiOYaa	ughh i hate it when that happens!  and everytime i confront that guy,  he goes like, because you dont talk to me!  soo.. you should just try to talk to him again.|`|EJKhLW2Baa	try and talk to him|`|vabZ1ASSaa	hey, i've had the same problem. he probably feels embrresed u said that. he probably doesnt know how to act around u now. so call him one day and say "hey,me and my friends were going to grab pizza wanna come?" it sounds friendly not flirty and he wll forget what happend and things will go back to normal! good luck                       xoxo naomi
O5HVCvRvaa	Yes, it is better to end it early, than force yourself to live with it. As much as people say it, but the truth is ugly, people do not change. if you finds something annoying with her now, you'll find the same thing annoying you later. It is better to tell her, but be kind, and realize, she is still the same person that you fell in love with before, even though you might not feel the same way now, it does not mean the feeling you had before is wrong.|`|FnQWXyp8aa	yes, but in a kind way!|`|CdDM0Xtaaa	He should have told her and yes moved out he shouldn't have used her and shouldn't have used her if he wasn't going to be with her that's how I feel and if she seen what he was doing why didn't she tell him to get the hell out of her house that's what I would have told him.|`|6846a3395d16d18b95b001a1bda626a1aa	He should never have moved in.|`|cie3oBcXaa	Yes definitely. It is the best thing to do for both of you.|`|NkYQXP8Oaa	Yes, but in a personal way.  Not via Facebook or Bebo.|`|gjMJzfoeaa	Honesty is best.     I mean, would you want someone not that into you sticking around when you could be missing out Mr. Right?|`|ETV7yvNbaa	Yeah. It's wrong to lead someone on. People respect you more if you are honest.|`|nf45Bxpkaa	yes always be honest.|`|dROrlLvhaa	yes..if thats how he feels|`|kA1mYSOtaa	One of the perils of the dating world is that there is too much blood-letting on both sides. Hearts get broken, dreams get shattered, and most of it is because of rash and premature decisions. I think that as difficult as it may be, it is time (and HAS been time) for you to get out of this before he causes even more damage to her heart and her psyche. This is the same reason, by the way, that boxing trainers throw in the towel when their fighter is too injured to go on. The damage is done, but it could still be worse if it doesn't stop. Trust me on this.|`|pxPcioiLaa	Yes he should have!
y6jr4U2waa	It's not that there is anything wrong with you, its just the type of person you are. My brother is kind of like you, and one of his problems is he rejects to many people. I don't know if you have the same problem, but if you see other quiet people try to talk to them and start a conversation, because you may have a similar personality and have more in common. Good luck, hope this helps.|`|soINlW2iaa	you like your own company and its cool. i do too :) you just need to open yourself up a bit more and talk to people.  you may feel out of your comfort zone but have a social background will be good for you.
44mmJ14Caa	u Reallyshouldnt label her a whore i mean as a woman i have made mistakes but that doesnt make me a whore. If you guys split and she got with one of your friends then thats wrong, but if you slip and she is out having fun now she wants u to be jelous and its fair game for her or anyone.THE QUESTION IS DID SHE CHEAT ON U IF YES THEN U HAVE UR ANSWER. but as far as age goes its just a number my man is 7 years older than me. if u want her back show her that u LOVE her|`|LiOOF1Plaa	Get over the hoe, and move on....she is just starting to rack up guys- stop keeping count. there won't be enough fingers and toes left.....|`|RlPeaD8Qaa	get over her dude, she's a straight up whore!!|`|ql4EgAL3aa	She is a whore!! Move on and find yourself a lady!!
e9W9g5tzaa	Honesty and straightforwardness with a touch of common sense is the way to go. Tell her you are interested in getting to know her better, ask her out for coffee or lunch something quiet and low pressure where you can talk and learn about her and give her a chance to get to know you. Going for a walk, stroll through a gallery etc. Any activity that is quiet and encourages small talk while not pushing physical intimacy is what you are looking for, be a friend and get to really know her.|`|9w8EW24daa	make her your friend! let her become comfortable around you then tell her how you feel|`|5yATLJi3aa	If  you want to know more about her then ask her about her family, parents and experiences. Possibly she has a dominating dad or she had a bad experience that made her feel bad when she was younger.|`|alKRRKzEaa	You should just be her friend first. Nothing too close. Just go up to her and be yourself.     I met my boyfriend at the mall when he just came up to me when I was trying on hats and he told me that I looked beautiful in it. (Don't use the word pretty)|`|MHl8YLKKaa	go to askmen.com they have a whole article about picking up shy girls|`|gjMJzfoeaa	I'm guessing (as a female) that "her friend" likes you and is trying to block you from asking her out.     Just ask this girl out, be straight forward and ignore her friend. If she says no, then at least you made an attempt to find out the truth.
EJKhLW2Baa	it was her aunt. dont worry bout it darling.
vuEyUbsgaa	he wants sex|`|WkDbNmIuaa	hes horny|`|tnIET8fCaa	it means he has sexual desires and is having a HUGE ***** on u
X7FWTxIMaa	Sounds like he is completely indecisive. Just wait till he calls and tell him you will not take it anymore!|`|WvOvoxLxaa	I would wait for him to call. I would apologize because you have no right to say who he can be friends with anymore than he can tell you who to be friends with. When a person tries to control a relationship, they usually end up wrecking it.  If he doesn't call back then you have learned a valuable lesson, and not to do it again.|`|CdDM0Xtaaa	No I don't think you should tell him your sorry what are you sorry for you didn't bring it on he did why does he have to be friends with his ex if he has you. That's the part I don't understand and I wouldn't take him back if he said that he wanted a week from you how do you know if he's not with her or not you don't so I wouldn't take him back because it seems to me that he wants his ex girlfriend back to me.|`|Nxx0R02Yaa	well obviously he hasn't called because he said he didn't talk for a week.... so just apologize when the weeks up|`|Wt62GmgRaa	chill, and next time don't ask such a stupid question. but rest assured, he will call u back!! and apologize then, give him his space.. Thats probably the best thing you can do. good luck!|`|hcc8fq7jaa	No. You asked a legitimate question. The fact that he got so angry about it leads me to believe he IS still interested in her. He said he needs a week away from you? I'd give him all the time in the world. Like forever. There are plenty of good guys out there, don't waste your time on a clown like him.|`|vuEyUbsgaa	Just try to keep yourself calm and not worried. If he sees that you are stressing over this hes gonna think youre needy and thats a huge turn off for guys. Even if he hasnt talked to you after a week wait at least one day after that week to talk to him. You need to act like you dont care and control your jealousy or hes gonna think you needy. You can tell him you're sorry but with some dignity
EZKe92TTaa	It's not tall,  but that's interesting that you're one of the taller ones in your grade. That's a pretty short population. Wonder where you're from?|`|VC8ivJHjaa	I think the average height at 17 is about 5' 6" to 5' 8". Many guys actually find short girls sexy!|`|x9vI6z4Yaa	Short.|`|fdBxaA4uaa	I'd say short. I'm almost 19, and I'm close to 5'8|`|KXYqCgWxaa	i am 5'3 and i'm 15 so i guess ur kind of short not really|`|WkDbNmIuaa	short haha    im 13 nd im 5"6 lol  nd yea i play bball nd my height is such an adventage!|`|9fUut86daa	Seemly it's short. I'm about the same but I wouldn't let it bother you.  Personally I'd rather not be really tall. Think of this - You can always wear (and not look wrong) in heels :D    Embrace your height! Much easier to be shorter than taller than a guy too!
AA11618874	For a female it's pretty simple. If a guy talks to you for no reason at all, it is most likely that he likes you. We males are like dogs in heat; if you get too close to us or stand still we'll try to jump up on your leg like there's a juicy steak on the top. Try running a test on him. Don't talk to him for a while at all and see how he responds. If he truly likes you and he's not insane for you he'll calmly and politely ask what the problem is......means he likes you. If he gets all defensive and mad at you........means he might be a realy nice guy at first appearance, but watch out, he could be a serial killer.  If he goes just fine for 2 days without any contact from you at all, then he probably doesn't like you that way. sorry. Try it and lemme know how it turned out. Take care chica.
n06pIHFhaa	No, I've never seen a guy able to block that move  'Tis the move I'm gonna start using now  Congratulations!  You have been slapped :D|`|AA11958479	no, and i dont know what the heck you are talking about without seeing it|`|YbilKhbNaa	i heard about that move. i've never had to use it ( luckily) but i have no doubts about it working. i have terrible aim tho, so with my luck, when i need it to work, i will miss. :P but i highly doubt that unless he know's its coming that he will block it.
ClK9W8THaa	Well since you've already mapped out the place where your going then don't forget to bring a blanket, picnic basket, wine or juice, food and dessert.  if you don't have a picnic basket then make one... Or substitute  with a large bag... Sit down and catch up on all the things that you both missed out on. Taking time out to talk is one of the best things anyone can invest doing. I hope you have fun...|`|ESwPIkfkaa	picnic in a park =]|`|2Y9U5jlGaa	ask him what he likes|`|rSXRBEaCaa	make a nice lunch/dinner, take some pretty candles and a lighter, and a pretty blanket to sit down on... dress real nice so he knows you appreciate him...also to make him appreciate him. take a box of really sweet truffles or chocolate...that will heighten the romance!!    hope all goes well!!|`|oCG2JxsEaa	that sounds fun. at the park do something fun like a game or his fave sport. hope this helps!
I08iONdaaa	if he's a player don't get involved with him. you don't want your first experience with a guy to be bad, it will affect your ideas of relationships the rest of your life (subconsciously and/or consciously). If he's really a player he's not going to respect your honesty or your inexperience, he's just going to use it. Find a guy who wants to be with you and can respect that you're new to this. You don't want any unnecessary, potentially hurtful, surprises.|`|FnQWXyp8aa	NO i dated a player before, huge mistake. But :) i beat him to the punch, i broke up with him when i found out his past...and he had a pretty colorful past    And ive found a boy that is amazing, and im really happy.|`|LkRivHpTaa	give your self out more availible   get guys drunk then bang them|`|YxLw8Aa0aa	Just be yourself.|`|0OSeBeLaaa	is it important to have been kissed or have a bf if your happy and have great mates?|`|4IFXHz80aa	No, NO, stay away! dont do it. youre gonna get yourself in a situation that you dont want to be in and your gonna regret it. High school boys are ruthless! dont do it. i wish i could take back most of the relationships i had in highschool. i got slaughtered!!!!!! i say no. plus read your post, you're already second guessing yourself. Dont do it. if he was a nice boy that didnt have a reputation, i would give you different advice. but thats not the case. dont do it! stay away!|`|Hl0e3p4laa	I think you should spend time. with a man not a girl|`|OQqAlHL8aa	story of my life.

Your setting yourself up to get hurt.|`|ZlgRne3caa	One of my best friends is 18, we're in college together, and she's never had a boyfriend or been kissed.  It's fine that you're in the same position, My best friend is an amazing person.

He ended up breaking my heart badly...and trust me, you don't want to go there...it feels so horrible.   So, just be a tiny bit patient, everything will come around, but if I were you, I'd try to like a different guy.|`|y6jr4U2waa	Hey I'm 17 and i've never been kissed either. I'm in the same situation, I'm fairly good looking, and i have an outgoing type of personality. But I haven't been able to get a girlfriend, I have lots of friends, a great job and my grades are good so my life is nearly perfect except for that one thing. I like a girl and she seems really nice and I think shes cute but I really like her personality....I don't know though I'm nervous because every other girl I've liked just hasn't worked out. I'm just gonna keep it cool and not worry about it, and hopefully things will work out for both of us. Hope this helps and good luck

AA10358331	Being Lds and been in that situation, the first thing you need to do is decide what do you want to do. You could of had sex, but did you really want to go through the repentance process and facing your bishop, not being able to go to the temple for a year, etc etc etc.   My advice to you is simple, don't make out as much as you do, learn to pace yourself and get out of situations that you don't want to get into. If you get too turned on from making out a lot, then that's when its time for one of you to go home. I know its hard but it will keep you from doing something that you don't want to do. Talk with your girlfriend about this as well, and make a decision about what you are going to do. Think of all of the consequences both long term and short term.   But be careful about what you do. This is why the church doesn't want you to date till your 16, and wants you to go on double date. I didn't do that but I knew that I didn't want to have sex till I got married. I told myself that over and over and never let myself fall to that. Although i wanted to have sex several times I kept telling myself, No don't do it. Think of your future husband (Although my husband now wouldn't care if i did or not).  If you need any other help don't be afraid to e-mail me :)|`|rSXRBEaCaa	if you wanna have sex, have sex...just be careful    good luck|`|fdBxaA4uaa	It's human nature to have those feelings. Just like Christians and other religions, you have to decide if you are ready and willing to go further sexually. If it conflicts with your religious beliefs and you know you will feel guilty and upset afterwards, then you probably shouldn't do it!  But if you have been together a while and love each other and feel ready, and you don't feel conflicted, and you can talk about it together and not feel embarrassed, it's all up to you.|`|dalNxu8zaa	i live in utah right now...  your not suppose to and i would say that if u want to then go ahead but use protection but dont go telling everyone that ur doing it|`|AA12206581	whatever.. thats your choice not some on here|`|FyLfEPv0aa	Nothing good can come of your relationship if it's that hot and heavy at 15.    For all of us LDS adults, we know what that feels like.  Dating my wife took some strength, but we did what was right to make it to our goal of the temple.  When situations got too heavy, we stopped.    Your girlfriend doesn't seem to respect your religion much if she's saying that to you.  You're only 15 and will never have virginity back if you allow it to be lost.    So yes, it's your choice, but your choice will make it nearly impossible for you to serve a mission and have the life that most want in the church.    You'll spend your entire life wondering "what would have happened if I didn't" which will haunt you far longer than any fleeting memory of a sexual encounter.    Go to church, think about everything you'd give up, and in those times when you guys aren't making out and feeling horny you make your decisions and stick to them.  If impulses control your life it will be a sad one.|`|8Ak1FehYaa	why do mormons allow themselves to date outside of their religion, this is one of the reasons we were not allowed to in the 70's and 80's your nonmormon BF or GF leads you into sin.|`|mCUNl9Wgaa	That's why a lot of adults prefer that LDS date LDS. Anyways, it's your personal choice. If you don't want to follow the rules of LDS, don't follow the rules, and do what you want. But I think 15 is still too young to be having sex. Thinking about it, okay. I would suggest you talk to a trusted adult about controlling yourself, if you're worried. Or, I would suggest putting LDS behind you and going with your own flow.|`|BMQlzUkfaa	Go talk to your Bishop.  You are headed for disaster my friend.  You are way too young, and you are about to make life long mistakes that will be very difficult to recover from.  So stop now and fix it.  Go talk to your bishop.    What is at stake?  Future marital happiness  Future children's happiness  Future opportunity to go on a mission  Not being worthy to hold the priesthood  Disappointing your parents  Grief, unhappiness, pain, guilt  Possible fatherhood before you are ready.    Is a moment of pleasure worth all the things I have listed?    Repent now, and get back on track.   By the way, if you are LDS you need to follow the advice of those who believe as you do.|`|q5lreoiWaa	You have to remember that you are greater than the sum of your parts. Right now, your physical parts are looming over all, but I urge you also to consider the long - term effects of a decision to have sex. Firstly,15, wow, do you have any idea on how long you will live in the body God has given you? Don't let the decisions of a 15 year old boy govern the life plans of the man you know you can be. Make a practise of going out in groups, it may be easier to deal with these issues should they arise, when your actions are being witnessed by others. It is not so much about your girlfriend's membership, as it is about her common morals. If you have a sister or a female cousin, I would urge you not to do anything with your girl  that you cannot abide anyone else doing with your sister.  If you truly care about her, then her purity is valuable to you as well. Seek the counsel of a man in your ward that you trust with this. It is so important. Get support and stay the course.
osqjr1J1aa	He doesn't like you because he's reasonable and sees that you're full of yourself.  No guy wants to deal with that.  The only reason you like him anyway is because he's unattainable.  As soon as you had him, you wouldn't like him anymore.  And he's aware of this.  Everything you do in your life is to boost YOUR self-confidence, and as long as you're only out for yourself, you're only going to have superficial relationships and are never going to find anyone that truly cares about you.     Do yourself a favor and grow up sooner than later.  You'll be way ahead of the game if you make the decision to do it now.|`|faa23f4368704769d71cc29e72525163aa	Sometimes it is the fact that you know you can't have him that makes you like that person more. Be careful not to jump into something just because it is like a challenge and you by nature want the challenge guy.    I have had that same stuation since about 4th grade!|`|KzG893Knaa	You'll get over it. You always think someone is the one before you find someone else, so just try and have fun with someone else! It might even make him jealous who knows? and it's mean to interfere, trying to break them up will only make things worse. so just wait until they break up!  and be glad all the guys love you. just go for one of them! even if they're not "the one" you might still find you enjoy it.|`|ExftbSP7aa	i think you should find the second best guy  and fool around with him until your guy is available  :]  its what i would do|`|BqbtvauDaa	......ok this is not that important you'll end up finding someone else. trust me, if you were ever to get this one guy, you'd dump him because once the chase and the game is over, there will be no attraction on your part.|`|L1zBgpXiaa	Well a guy isn't worth losing a friendship over. He isn't the only guy out there and I once thought a guy was the "only one for me" but turned out he wasn't and got with my friend. I made myself accept the fact he didn't like me and moved on. Just start talking to some of the other guys that like you maybe one will catch your attention and you can get to know eachother. Anything is possible, just don't try to take your friends bf, totally not worth it. It could also be the thought when you know you can't have something it makes you desperate for it. But just try hard to not think about him and talk to others.
EZKe92TTaa	Well if you like  him you can invite him to a meal at a good restaurant... and no more. Or as one responder suggested, give him a voucher to a good restaurant. A fine meal is always a nice gift. If you share it with him, even better. Just decide if you want to pursue anything with him or not, and then take it from there.|`|dzyJw0cvaa	lol, seriously?  Just get him a gift card to a resturaunt he likes or something.  Theres no reason you should have to give any of YOU for a favor he's  done.|`|YzwuDRfYaa	If he says you owe him "bug time", give him a roach !|`|BqbtvauDaa	treat him to food or something. but i get the feeling he's wanting more than just food..if you catch my drift. you dont have to go all the way or anything..
KenDuMH2aa	okay so basically guys like mystery so he might not be interested in you right now but just tell everyone that your not obsessing over him cause that's happened to me before and he started to like me anyways if you feel weird about getting his number just be like hey can i have your number cause i need help with math or something like that and it will give you an excuse to talk to him
EZKe92TTaa	He is not harrassing you. I suggest you just take a step back and stop interacting with him, only what you must for school. Dont' be rude obviously, but leave out the sarcasm or anything else he might interpret as personal. If you feel that it is progressing into something inappropriate then report it. But it sounds fairly innocent for now.|`|5FVyVS9vaa	What do you mean by a little interest? What makes you think he is flirting with you?|`|EdidZdtlaa	maybe he dosent like you but thats just what your thinking. but try not talking to him that much to show that you dont like him.|`|gDEFlWnOaa	File a sexual harrassment charge against him with the principal/dean.|`|IZJSuShbaa	stop standing up for him, keep a distance.|`|9w8EW24daa	get a boyfriend and talk about how great he is in your teachers room  that will send a message that he needs to back off!|`|EgnmSCsqaa	u look like a twat right now lmao|`|aUAOHcoxaa	tell him straight. or nicely. lol|`|jxpa713daa	quit being so easy going  sorry its probably the only way  if your nice to him then hes going to take it that way because of the person he is  next time he flirts with you, ignore it, dont speak with him  when your with friends make sure your always into the subject THEIR talking about, and try to keep it going, if your with friends it makes you a harder target - so stay with friends, dont talk to him, and only talk to them    and if all fails - talk to your principle, its a serious matter
soINlW2iaa	talk to either a guidence counsellor or head. he shouldnt be this way towards you without a justifiable reason. so dont let him get away with it. what class is it? maybe find someone who can help you with it
FXCoGD44aa	If he doesn't want to give you another chance, that's his decision. There honestly isn't a whole lot you can do to improve this situation. I don't mean to sound harsh, but you really did take him for granted and blew it. Understandably, he's hurt. There is no way to erase or "make up" for what you did.    No matter how tempting it may seem, don't be desperate and call him, text him, write him, etc. begging for his forgiveness and telling him how much you love him. It will not work and he will only think that you are more pathetic that he already does. Save your dignity and don't fillet yourself to him.    Also think too... even if you got back together, the relationship would never be the same. He probably won't trust you at all, and always be suspicious of your behavior when you aren't together. He will always feel pangs of jealously for what you did with this other guy. Is that the kind of relationship you want?    The best thing you can do for yourself, and him, at this point is to just learn from your mistake here and move on. I don't think this makes you a bad person by any means... as long as you learn that when you make a commitment to somebody, you have to keep it.|`|FnQWXyp8aa	ALL you did? Are you that cold hearted? you made a big mistake. And i dont blame him for not wanting to get back together with you. You probably hurt him pretty bad, youve probably lost all his trust. No one likes to date cheaters, how would you feel if he went and made out with another hot girl? pretty crappy right! stop being so selfish. Its probably best for him not to date you again.|`|yuwjQjKqaa	He would be stupid to take you back, so you cant do anything. ITS OVER!|`|cie3oBcXaa	Don't cheat next time and learn your lesson. You have broken his trust, once trust has gone, it's very hard to get it back.|`|jXCjw64Iaa	you will have to sell out for him and go to new lengths. this still might not work but it will take a lot of time. you cannot change either if you do win him back...keep doing these "new length" things.  "only making out" is actually a big deal. how insecure do you think he feels now that he is no longer important enough to be the only one in your life.|`|cmFU81rQaa	"the only thing i did was makeout wit another guy"    That says it all.  He's right to refuse to take you back.  You're not even really sorry about it.|`|FsQez6wGaa	nothing, obviously you betrayed him,|`|zFQm2Pftaa	Oral twice a day and buy him a PS3|`|ExftbSP7aa	i dont think you deserve him.  honestly, i dont wanna be a bxtch but wow.  you dont cheat on someone you want.  you messed up.  and you gonna have to move on.  i know this isnt what you wanted to hear.  but its the truth.|`|rSXRBEaCaa	maybe you shouldnt have cheated on him in the first place...    making out with another guy is even worse than you can imagine...now your bf is looking at you like your crazy...you can try to get him back, but dont ever do anything as stupid as you did again... that was a bad call on your part    good luck honey|`|CNwo1exRaa	Even if you win him back, you will never restore trust, and your relationship will not last.  You might as well accept that this is over, and move on sooner rather than later, Dragging this out and hurt both over you more.|`|VkeBXm3Gaa	you go live under a rock, until you realize that what you did was BAD. Even if you did just make out with another guy, it's still veryyyyy wrong.|`|X7FWTxIMaa	You're SO Screwed!!!! HAHAHAHAA|`|wdYNUJ0Iaa	You talk about him like he is a piece of property.  Well I have news for you.  He's a human too.  He has feelings, just like you do.  And yes, he does have the same temptations as you do.  Whether you realize it or not, you are not the only attractive girl out there, and yeah he knows this.  But he stayed loyal to you.  He never had a relationship with anyone else, even though he could have.  You can't say that for yourself, can you?  In my opinion, you don't deserve him.  He deserves someone that will love him for who he is, and not even think about betraying the trust that he has created with her.
9RH0Qa6eaa	It's not a cliche. There's something about the innocence that is just wildly attractive, but be careful. If you're looking for a "bad boy", there's a fine line to walk. The biggest appeal comes in the challenge to "corrupt" you. I.e. if you don't smoke, swear, or drink, they will try to get you to do all three, probably smiling and laughing about it the whole time. Don't bother though, it's just a test. They don't actually want you to do those things, in fact, they might even lose interest in you if you do start doing those things, cause then the innocence is gone. So if you REALLY want to date a "bad boy" just go about what you normally do, make an effort to talk to them, and if you wind up dating (careful, one night stands are probably a risk here) just stick to being yourself and not doing drugs and crap and you'll be gold. You can choose to trust me or not, but this is all coming from experience.|`|VXPmIENCaa	oh they dont.....they pretend too....but then they cant hold too long...so thngs fall apart|`|fL8CIA2Xaa	when they are ready to settle down..although they want to end up with good girl, they will always be thinking about the bad girl..opposites attract|`|M3CsxF2jaa	yes, trust me i have a bad boy and im a good girl they love it!|`|qR7lwYeraa	are you like 10 years old ?|`|byHh0A3Eaa	bad boys like all girls that are hot. hot good ones or hot bad ones, it's w/e.|`|oCG2JxsEaa	i think it depends on the guy. but i think the can.|`|H4rEZ0rCaa	idk?    http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index;...

But I find it best to just tell her how beautiful she is and she stands out from the other girls. She'll think "aww he's such a sweetheart" and that will put you in for the goal! :)|`|oWtDt5WNaa	things i like when i am talking to a guy :    *i had alot of fun with you tonight  *you looked really pretty  *your so much fun to hang out with  *i never get bored of you like i do of other girls, your special  *i like talking on the phone with you before i go to sleep   *your the person i think about when i go to bed  *you mean so much to me  *can we hang out tomorrow or soon because i really love hanging out with you  *i miss you  * if your going out - i love you.

WakrhybCaa	This may take a li work cause you're kinda reading a book for it's cover. I at one point in my life was dating often and different people for a host of reasons. My main reason was because I really wanted to settle down and fast but I could'nt find what I wanted so I continued on interviewing. Try not to judge off of the cover for both candidates, It is something to consider but not always accurate at all! Pick at his brain a little through small talk. hope this helps|`|vrfuO9Asaa	he does sound like a ladies man but if u like him and he likes u bck try it
fLoFMhDMaa	Not prude at all. Its something you're not ready for. Just because he is, doesnt mean you should be. I'm glad you stuck to your morals and said no. This guy though, is obviously a dick. If he's not talking to you because you wouldnt do what he wanted, thats just retarded. He's just an ***. Good job :)|`|DZB0WCmmaa	it has NOT been wrong omg!! this has been the RIGHTEST thing you will probably do in your all life!|`|ygimTNzoaa	No, you decide when you're ready not some guy. I had a brother a year older then me was a jock he had plenty of friends come over and they'd say how they'd love a chance to get with a virgin. It's sad really, my brother wasn't like that he had a girlfriend since the 8th grade hes 25 and still with her. Just those guys they can pretend but in the end they wanted one thing. I'm glad you held out and I'm sorry he had to be like that when you liked him. But really wonder what it would've been like if you did let him do what he wanted. Would he really be there for you, would you be OK with that. Please stay strong, I'd had plenty of opportunity's and turned them down I wanted to at least wait till I was 18. I gave in 2 weeks before my 18th birthday with the quarterback and I do regret it, 1 time thing and he played it like he cared of corse. I hope it makes you stronger.|`|AOgK773Eaa	Your a senior. Grow up and give the man what he wants.|`|jsCjGUPuaa	no its ur decision if u want to wait or not|`|gjMJzfoeaa	:P   No, you're not being prude silly.     This boy is obviously just looking to get laid rather than having a girlfriend (typically costs less for the guy).     In the long run, you're respecting yourself and that's more than this guy could ever offer you. Find a guy that will respect you.|`|bbe6d542c99c3729df16c734b566d4afaa	no, you've done the right thing.|`|ESwPIkfkaa	no if your not ok with that then its fine  some guys r just assholes like him|`|yJROr3Iraa	no of course you weren't  just be happy it didn't get as bad as it could've, which it would've if you didn't stop him|`|gapWTVmDaa	no, you weren't. he was just horny and now acts like the baby. If he's normal, he'll be okay.|`|6846a3395d16d18b95b001a1bda626a1aa	A woman is never wrong in saying no.  A guy will always be wrong in not understanding what the word no means.|`|YOaHblduaa	hey u did da ryt thin. u mst never do anythin if ur not comfertabl vt it. it seems that dis guy is only aftr u 4 one reason. he has to respect ur feelings if he really loves u. 4rm wt it seems he sounds lyk as total jerk. dont tink too much ignore him n wait.|`|GqTSa85daa	No, if you do not feel comfortable you are not ready.  You'll know when it's right.  And let him go, he only wanted one thing from you.|`|FyhzmgRUaa	You're a smart girl. It's obvious he just wanted to have sex with you. If he was able to leave you just like that, just imagine how quickly he would have left if you were to have sex. Forgot about him, no matter how hard it is to act around him in school hold your head up, because you were a really smart not to something you weren't ready for.|`|uhfFNaaAaa	Hell no you weren't being a prude!     He sounds like a jerk who simply wants to get in your pants and his motto is probably "hit it N quit it".    But kudos to you for your assertiveness and self-control! *pats on back*    Eventually, you'll meet a guy who will actually want you for your personality and such!|`|lfhvNgSnaa	NO! you were completely right! don't ever let a guy push you|`|7Q0UBqBYaa	NO YOU DID THE RIGHT THING. DONT DO ANYTHING YOU ARENT READY TO .|`|AgIjuGaxaa	No.  It means he apparently was in it for one reason.  You don't need a loser like that.|`|j4ZBROvjaa	when you let guys go to second base an 3ed no is not in there vocab they are only thinking about one thing sadley. but you had evey right to say no that is not you being prude that is u respecting ur self an body. go with your gut feeling if somethign dosent feel right dont do it if he dosnet want to talk to you thats his loss he has no respect for u|`|XIlJr3Hpaa	Def not...don't do it until you're ready. Ultimately, you're the one that has to live with it the rest of your life and in high school, a douche bad like that probably isn't the guy you're going to spend the rest of your life with.|`|n06pIHFhaa	No,  You weren't ready, and that's okay. You respected yourself, and the guy didn't respect your boundaries. The guy may seem nice, but if he's ignoring you because of that, he's an idiot. Chances are, he just wanted to use you and leave you. The same thing probably would have happened in the end. If you do hit third base, then the guy should understand how you feel, not just what he wants. I give you my best wishes and plenty of luff to make it through this :)|`|9w8EW24daa	uh no! saying no isnt a bad thing|`|kt9iXMWUaa	Absolutely not!  It sounds like this guy only wanted you for one thing.  He sounds like a real jerk.  Besides, whose to say that if you did give in he would have left you for the next girl.  Don't feel bad for making the right choice.  Get a guy that is interested in your feelings, not just his own personal needs.      You go girl!|`|jxpa713daa	def. not  if thats actually your guys second time hanging out im surprised you ended up making out    now by all means, if you want to eventually do that, go for it, but if its in your nature/beliefs/wants to wait, then wait  never go past your own personal boundaries for a guy who clearly wants one thing from you    i've been with my girlfriend almost three years and we've grown into all those things, and i respect her choices  shes got a purity ring and i dont - but obviously in a scenario like that she wins    so if you feel bad for some reason, then maybe hook up again and go for it, but if you REALLY like the guy, then dont let it start off with sex|`|ub6lxGPIaa	No you weren't. THink about it. He probably did thirty other girls than you. he might have did you, given u an STD, and then you would be scarred for life.   Let him know that you're not ready to do it wwith him until u know that ur both commited one hundred percent  Plus it is only your fourth date!|`|z12hxL7yaa	Nope- you have every right to say no! and if he does not talk to you thatys all he wanted anyway and he is not that much of friend- wait for someone who RESPECTS you and you will know when it's right!|`|EuFNCVG6aa	No..you was not wrong. If you didnt want to, then he has to respect that.    http://uk.answers.yahoo.com/question/ind...|`|BlZSrsrmaa	noo u wasnt u   gd on u 4nt givin in so easily   it wud hab been ur 1st tym with him nd he probly wud hav found a new virgin mary within about 2weeks    trust me hun ur luky u didnt let it go there  but  u wil find sum1 who will actually apreciate the fact that u r a virgin and they wil wait for you until u are ready    besides all he wanted was sex!!    hpe that answers ur question    x|`|EcVVcgZNaa	I think thats a little fast. You were not being prude, don't feel like you have to do something just because he wants you to. It sounds like that was all he was after anyways, sorry.|`|DgWUovrQaa	He was being pushy and a bully. He doesn't deserve you. Move on.|`|1b9p0126aa	you did the right thing!  omg he is such an idiot!! its soo typical! he doesnt get away with IT so he pulls the "i dont care" card with you!  he is trying to manipulate you so you go ALL the way with him..!  he wants u to feel like u did something wrong, many boys do that and unfortunately it works on MANY girls..  dont u be one of those! :S!    heyyy forget about this douch! find a niceer guy, who will wait for u as long as u need! not an idiot that already wants u in  bed after the second kiss!     :] good luck!|`|NdY60NcBaa	not at all if your not omfortable with it and he doesn't understand thats his problem and obviously if he doesnt respect ur boundries he wasnt right for u|`|gypWPBvLaa	no not at all he seems like a user he probably just wanted to get in your pants and then leave you|`|X7hm4fJXaa	afcourse  you were NOT wrong ! you cant just let him push you around like that, and if he stoped talking to you well that basicly means he wants you for your " looks " and " body " .|`|qcyaBE27aa	No you weren't being prude.   It's not right for him to push you into doing something like that!  If you aren't ready- then you aren't ready!  So if he doesn't talk to you or ignores you, because you wouldn't give him an hj, then the boy isn't worth liking.   Some boys are just stupid!  I've been through the same situation, and I REALLY liked the guy, I thought I was in love with him, but I broke up with him because I wasn't ready to have sex.   There are other boys out there, and if this one isn't willing to wait on you, he's not worth you to watse your time on!|`|rIcCujOraa	Hand jobs are pretty innocent. That wouldn't of been going to far at all. Its not like he was asking to stick it in or to blow him. He just wanted you to put your hand down his pants.|`|YjV1MLLVaa	No you weren't being a prude at all....if you aren't ready to take it to another level then you just aren't ready. You did the right thing by standing up for yourself. Don't ever let someone force you into going farther than you want to go. Take your time because you don't want to regret it later.|`|EtFgk9mAaa	no i don't think you were wrong! i think he should respect whatever you decide to do. especially if he know that was your first kiss!|`|OnzTuOW3aa	definitely not because if he cared for u even a little bit he would understand!|`|44mmJ14Caa	Absolutely NOT, alot of guys try that guilt trip stuff to try to make you feel that way so that u will do it he prolly feels like an idiot for not respecting u and that's why he didn't talk to you. Not alot of girls can say that they still have there innocence as a senior u will know when the right time comes along dont feel bad at all HIS LOSS not your u didn't lose anything think if u would have done it and he acted this way u would feel way worse. BE PROUD OF UR SELF|`|0JHszg4zaa	NO! you were doing the right thing! if you weren't ready, you weren't ready. As mean and sad as it sounds, he may have just been using you for well...you know. You have ethics and are probably a really good person, so don't let it get to you, it's his loss. Move on and show him that you don't care what he thinks|`|LOAue7dUaa	No not all, good on you for staying with your convictions, guys like that have nothing else better to do or think about other than glorifying sexual manhood.    If he no longer acknowledges you thats fine, you know you have the complete satisfaction of knowing he struck out, just be aware of any rumours he may try to circulate to tarnish your reputation or good name.    There are many decent guys out there, patience is a virtue.     All the best    Cheers from New Zealand
bbP9gBu8aa	Ignore she is fishing for compliments. Instead change the topic to an interesting subject that is not about compliments. Do it once a while, but not too much.|`|hSubLAVhaa	Yeah girls love that a lot. You should tell her that she is beautiful inside and out.|`|KvphGLGVaa	is it a sign of what?    she was definitely fishing for compliments.|`|84185fe64dc81cd1985d1d8937907f9eaa	TOOTTALLYYYYY|`|fa6c64f5e8a85f1b4a65c7c52c3acd0caa	Did you mean it or did you say it for the sake of making her happy???|`|nTRIyLS3aa	dats cause she was really happy u said dat cause she like alot u so duh its a sign,
s8d7gg5Haa	OHHH SHE LIKES YOU :)
squQboawaa	yeah it seems to me you waited too long and he is in his mind frustrated at you and mostly himself for not making a move sooner.  Sometimes depending on how old the boy is he might like you and wants to look like he doesn't care about you or anything to look cool(dont ask me why guys think this at young ages we just do).  Ill bet he is just a little uncomfortable around you but he sounds too immature for a date.  Probably just become friends and dont try to do anything romantically with him til maybe later in both of your lives.|`|H1UzYl8haa	probably dosn't find you attractive like that (to him) maybe your not HIS type, which isint a bad thing    it means that you can do better and find someone that actually cares about you taking time out of your day to talk to HIM    move on girl dont be stuck on just one guy,thats pathetic    guud luck sweatie|`|cc0e048495630741cf408149c1f4405daa	I think there are two answers for this - how old are you?? This sounds like a teenage boy and if that's the case, that's what they ALL do! If you really like the guy spark some kind of conversation. Ask him where he works, about school, anything. Maybe he was just having a bad day the first time. If you are older - in your 20's or more - forget about him!|`|ZOA3VnRpaa	Well if you never went on date with him maybe he got over you over summer and you waited to long to get together.
H7cNZYIYaa	well if you don't feel comfortable going for it, that's out of the question.  Why don't you try flirting with some guys from school?  That might distract you from him.|`|rIcCujOraa	Try it anyway! The worse you can do is really flatter him.

xWie9Zavaa	Hope I'm not too far out of line here. She should take that as constructive criticism and clean up her vagina. Give it a trim or shave it. Get a little heart tattooed on the side of it. It's too bad it was made public, but if it isn't attractive, she should clean it up. Cute ones are a lot more fun to eat than ugly ones!|`|EdidZdtlaa	she shouldnt go on those chat rooms anymore. however she shouldnt care what people think about her umm vagina. cause its hers i guess and she should be proud of it.

Don't think her vagina is ugly, and watch who takes pics.|`|06e3b455c42895168ee7096710ade50daa	first of all ppl shouldnt b sending pictures of that over the internet becuase who knows who these ppl r and if this guy is friends with everyone in the chat room he could have just told everyone to say that no reason to b scared to have sex becuase of that honestly its not like thats what the guy stares at the whole time theres no reason to worry|`|Jlhti4oWaa	tat chick got it bad but tat boy was proberly 80 years old tut, tut, tut pervy.  or a geeki in need of love and was sscared of wat 2 say when he saw this..... reveling pic.But she got 2 pick her self up and roll and grab a cookie when she gets out the door.|`|QVsxjEo5aa	She needs to keep her confidence and maybe think about who she gives a picture to next time......

FXCoGD44aa	Try creating some rituals for you as a couple. When my boyfriend and I were in a long distance relationship, we found lots of ways to show our love and comfort each other.    * We had a scrapbook [[which was really just a .99 cent composition notebook from Walmart]] that we taped all of our pictures together in, as well as memorabilia from things we have done together [[movie tickets, paper restaurant napkins, etc.]]. When we were apart, we wrote love letters to each other in it and mailed it back and forth to each other.     * We mailed other stuff to each other also. Anything from cards to homemade cookies to little presents to sexy lingerie. It was always fun anticipating what the next surprise is going to be.    * If you have to, talk more often. What always made me feel great was that my boyfriend would always call me to wake me up every morning. After a while, I stopped using my alarm clock completely.    * Sometimes we would rent the same movie and talk to each other on the phone while watching the same movie at the same time. Sounds cheesy [[and it is]] but it is really nice. And it's kinda fun going, "Okay, hit play on three... 1, 2, 3!"    * Always have a plan for when the next time you are going to see each other. If you have something to look forward to, it makes things much easier than wondering, "Am I ever going to see you again?"    Another thing I feel the need to put in that in order for this relationship to be successful, then both of you really need to trust each other. If your boyfriend keeps bringing up his insecurities and worries, then that's a whole other issue to be addressed outside of doing cute things for each other. Ask him what makes him worry about so much. You can even say that it hurts you a little when he brings that up, because you would never do something like that. He needs to be confident in what you have and not let thoughts like this overcome him. Though good-intention, it can create trouble eventually.    Hope that helps! Good luck!|`|jxpa713daa	go visit him  it always makes any guys day to see the girl he loves even for a short period of time  im not sure how far away he is, but if you can afford or just go there then def. go visit him    now all long distance relationships are hard, but after w.e the two of you are doing, maybe you'll get a place together or something  it will all work out if YOU want it to work out
kt9iXMWUaa	Be patient and follow your heart.  Time will tell if his feelings are for real and if he is lying.  In the meantime, don't worry about it.  Take one day at a time.  Tell him your true feelings and see how he responds.  If he gets angry at you, then he's a cheat.    Good Luck!|`|yuOuoCfDaa	OMG.....you are allowing him to use you until what he wants comes around.  A Door Mat honey.......I dont want to say that you have low self esteem cause that isnt always the case, if you are asking this question it is quite obvious you know the answer.  Dont consider him your boyfriend anymore, consider yourself as filling the gap, because its obvious what the deal is here|`|cie3oBcXaa	Just follow your gut instincts, you won't go wrong then.|`|ub6lxGPIaa	See how he acts around you. If it seems kind of corny like "I love you soo much " On the first date, then you can see that something is kinda up....|`|9RH0Qa6eaa	Well, then, yeah, you're probably the backup plan.
vuEyUbsgaa	Act like you dont even care weather you talk to him or not or hes gonna think you're depserate to be his friend and a loser

If he's so weak as to listen to his friend all the time, then do you really want to be bothered with him?|`|gjMJzfoeaa	First of all, don't blame yourself. There are many, many times that a relationship ends and you will never know the real truth (or may not want to know).     It's Saturday.

I look up to ppl like you cuz I know I'd never have the nerve to do that so good job. Of course it was a good idea. If you hadn't asked you would be sitting and wondering what if. He'll think you like him probably. No matter what the answer- at least you'll know :) good luck|`|FCtQ8QwDaa	Get to know him at the dance. If you both have a myspace talk to him.

gjMJzfoeaa	Tell her or ask her why doesn't want to go out! Hinting is the silliest thing to do in a relationship for either sex. They'll either ignore the hint or not get the hint. She'll be upset at first, but in the long run thank you for it.     If you can't be upfront with her, schedule a date and make it so you two meet somewhere. I.e. the movies, a play, the park etc.|`|dalNxu8zaa	why dont u both go hang out with friends or to a club|`|2jSX5nQkaa	just totally surprise her. like say your going to your house then just take her out or something. that would be kinda fun.|`|ay0FEQaiaa	plan something but dont tell her  (but make sure she doesn't have anything planned for that day). then just tell her that you are going to take her somewhere just bfore you go and then take her. girls like surprises.
clu2Ia4paa	looks like ur best friend is not a friend at all and ur boyfriend might not be that good ask him what happened and for the rumors forget about them they are just rumors  try to find another friend who is truly a friend and dont trust ur friend anymore and be careful about ur boy friend|`|VZOisk2saa	forget them both  ~PD|`|380bda9352681d34dbc2cb522cb6de4caa	Pardon?????????????|`|VtZyVA4Aaa	Go talk to her about it.

Good Luck :]|`|ayQ2MCg0aa	omg jazzy has it led to dis   lol but UM girl do wat u got 2

You just have to treat them right, give them what they want, avoid fights, and you either have chemistry, or you dont.|`|x5f6AqDBaa	just a nice and warm personality,tenderness and politeness|`|ub6lxGPIaa	Just compliment them a lot. Make them feel like they are the most gorgeous human being in the world.  When other hot ladies are around, don't stare at them, don't even look at them. It will make the one woman that YOU want feel like she is nothing.  When you talk to your woman, kiss her like you mean it!|`|yuOuoCfDaa	Your unconditional actions!!! Period...... that's it!|`|kt9iXMWUaa	Honesty and placing her needs before yours.  This will get you a LONG way!|`|kA1mYSOtaa	Patrick, you find the definite answer to that, and you call me or email me and share it. lol. Seriously, though, there is no "one way" to a woman's heart. For us guys, it's either sex and/or food. Then again, we are rather stupid that way.     Women do, however, enjoy the chase. They love a guy who is a challenge, who has self-confidence, and who has self-control. In other words, they don't want too much revealed/given up front, they don't want a guy who cannot say the word "no", and they don't want a guy who projects his feelings on her too much or too soon or who cannot keep his hands to himself on the first few dates.     What I'm trying to say is that you will almost always get the girl if you are unique by doing what no other guys in her life are doing. Most guys who get her number will call the next day or the day after that. You, on the other hand, will intrigue her by not calling for 5-7 days. You will not ask her out for a weekend on the first date. It is better to just have the first date at Starbucks over a couple of lattes. This way, if it doesn't get to the second date, you've only wasted 90 minutes and seven bucks or so. You keep the conversation light and entertaining for her. You make her laugh and (hopefully) touch your arm. These are what we call "buying signals". You always want her to initiate contact.     Anyway, stick by this criteria and you should be fine. It's not going to get the girl EVERY time, but when it doesn't, it quickly and efficiently weeds out the ones that are not worth your time BEFORE they end up wasting too much of it. Give it a try!|`|igTAIvzIaa	be a gentleman :) every girl loves a guy who reminds her of prince charming|`|EcVVcgZNaa	flowers and chocolates (don't forget those) lol.  No, someone who is honest with her, doesn't lie, and someone who is considerate of her feelings.|`|IOYynA0Oaa	That depends on the woman, find a good one, listen to her, and figure it out.|`|JL4MowJLaa	treat her like she is your future wife and give her all the respect and love she deserves.|`|o1gvGrBtaa	humor..|`|7tGhXCQ1aa	Confidence. You can have the best personality in the world, but without confidence? You're a wet noodle. Show her that you've got interest in her, and you're a dedicated person, but don't let her become the center of your universe... That's just creepy. Show her your good qualities, and make sure she has a good time while she's with you, without reverting to the super-romantic stereotypes that are out there-- a surefire way to land yourself in the "intellectual whore" realm of dating.    Otherwise, just try the sternum like a previous poster mentioned.|`|NNiN0tK0aa	flattery.      but if you want to earn her on your own merit...twinkly eyes.  eyes that smile.|`|L6c4wPPGaa	Depends who it is.    Most girls, when you are a gentleman, and if you smile, and look at her eyes, not her chest.|`|EdidZdtlaa	be honest , respectful and kind. act like a gentleman and dont be fake and say things you dont mean. be real. and alwayz be there when your needed. thats what i think.|`|XC20JjzVaa	through the ribcage.|`|0ylm04PWaa	I think someone being gentle and sensitive yet capable of being tough and a leader when a situation calls for it is great.

SPECIALLY if she would have slept him some other guy!     :) good luck in your decision... Take care|`|vuEyUbsgaa	Leave him. And if he wants to get back with you and you want to get back with him too, dont make it be obvious that you still wanna be with him. Dont make it easy for him to get back to you. He needs to learn to respect you and that you're not gonna put up with his cheating. If youre having a hard time getting over this guy then you should go out with your friends or famly and do something fun or keep yourself busy so you wont be thinking about him too much|`|TYBkDHYNaa	I think you deserve better so you should move on, I know letting go is one of the hardest things we women face, especially when we start building trust and falling for guys and he'll probably say his sorry he loves you and all this and that, yes all that could be true (sometimes) but if you really dig deep down and find it in your heart that he deserves a second chance then I guess you should sit down and think about it. My deepest fear is that if he was seeing her while he was with you, then there is a chance that they both have a connection it was wrong for him to do that to you, at the end of the day its up to you hun and also remember once a cheater always cheater very few people(  very few) who cheat do change but hey like I said its all up to u, deserve someone who will respect you and love you and give you the world the best of luck to you|`|Hl0e3p4laa	just leave him and email guy online like me|`|XXlAs7QCaa	dump him you cant trust him after that|`|9P0TiiX4aa	Break up with him, even if youre still in love with him and think you can patch things up it isnt worth it in the long run|`|AA12359831	break up with him. you deserve better.   dont listen to anything he says.  if he says he loves you. he wouldnt have done that.  hes not the only guy left in the world.   there are some good guys out there.|`|1tCYt7nBaa	dump him!!!|`|ptg3fzmtaa	DUMP HIM!!!!!!!!!!|`|HRUZ8HhFaa	Hire an assassin duh|`|xWGKB0NZaa	Tell him he's a pathetic loser with low self-esteem and dump him.|`|pRjtcpYXaa	You gotta suck it up and keep moving on if he cheated on you then obviously he doesnt know that your better than he deserves because your a good enough person to be faithful and he doesnt deserve you|`|VcTTSUI7aa	I've been there it's not worth giving another try. Just trust me I've been there. I would dump him. You can find better.
Dg4lLq5Haa	I don't think he knows what he's doing.  I think he's just letting each day pass in the hope something will happen.  My advice to you is to tell him how you feel.  According to your description he doesn't have much experience & unsure of what to do.  Just go for it, you only regret the things you don't do.  Lifes tooo short..............
AA10426969	get a gym membership.     You know, the major tv station websites let you watch episodes for free? That could eat up some time.

Inquire if they need any help on weekends on with a specific date i.e..holiday/awareness day. You can offer your time and qualified efforts.

WosAicoWaa	You need to stick to what you are feeling! You need to be very honest with him and tell him that you are not ready to have sex with him. I think that you will learn a lot from his reaction. If he is understanding then is a plus for him. If he continues to pressure you then you should think about moving on. I am 18 years old and I have decided to wait until I am married to have sex. It is a very hard thing to tell someone you are in a relationship no when they want too. Stand strong and you will be happier in the end that you did. You can never take back having sex. Tell him that his welcome home present can just be you two being together...not sex! I hope this helps...|`|byHh0A3Eaa	handjob|`|vuEyUbsgaa	Just tell him you're not ready yet. Dont give it up to him just cause he wants you to. He needs to respect you|`|AygQshkcaa	Tell him a straight out "No, I'm not ready for sex". And if he starts cheating on you or keep on pressuring you, say "I'm breaking up with you", and leave. He isn't worth it so you shouldn't feel bad about it.|`|ETV7yvNbaa	Just tell him that you aren't ready, and it is a big deal for you. If he only cares about that, then he doesn't really care about you. He needs to respect your feelings.|`|z12hxL7yaa	if your not ready then don't do it- simple as that- if that's all he wants he's not much of friend, much less a BOY friend.|`|6879286ebd43f9d2a6690a2120e9e880aa	Bottom line is if you aren't ready - you aren't ready.  Don't let anyone pressure you into doing something that you aren't ready to do.      Virginity is the only one thing that you have that is Truly yours.  Its the only one thing that you can't ever get back.  Its the only one thing that you can give somebody one time.      Make sure that it is what you want.  Think about it long and hard before you act on it!  Good luck!
CvVgihRtaa	It seems that you being single again is making you a likely catch for other guys.      Well, be totally honest with a guy whenever he does bring up the subject of starting a relationship and let him know you are still getting over someone else.  Also ask him to respect your decision and to give you space and time.  Remember not to commit to "think over his question" or to "put anyone on the top of any list".    In the meantime, enjoy your friendships.  However,  if a guy won't respect your decision then avoid him for awhile.    All the best to you.|`|adRhKB05aa	Be yourself and tell them honestly how you feel.
MC1V0VDuaa	no the whole to day thing is just so played out just hit him up because if he really likes you then hes been waiting|`|WGAFP6mSaa	I don't understand, but just text him on the second day.    **** YOU surgedark !!!!!!!|`|byHh0A3Eaa	yes you seem overly aggressive, overbearing and desperate|`|AYVQhXVjaa	Yeah well, at least I'm not black.

They love each other even tho the girl is twice as tall as him, so love will break this stupidity in height,|`|n06pIHFhaa	I agree, it's stupid.  But for some reason  I'm just more attracted to tall guys  It's a nice feeling, like you're protected  Not to mention Those guys are usually  REALLY hott ;D  Sorry for being shallow,  But that's just to this day right?|`|5yATLJi3aa	I am 11 inches taller than my wife. Not many men are taller than me. I married my wife because she is a kind, intelligent lady and enhanced my life. She still enhances my life and I have learned a lot from her.|`|AA10614910	wow, it has nothing to do with conforming. It's just a personal taste.  I know of couples where the guy is shorter.    If a guy doesn't want to be shorter, that is up to him, get over it. I would not date a guy shorter than me, because I don't want to.  I can tell from your rant you are a bit bitter.   And I know a lot of girls who want a big guy to protect them.  I didn't know there were girls out there who wanted limp noodles, but you proved me wrong. I took karate but I still wouldn't want a guy who couldn't look after me or protect me|`|9P0TiiX4aa	I was 4 inches  taller than my ex and I was completely fine with it. I think if you have feelings for someone you shouldnt let something stupid like their height get in the way.|`|pxPcioiLaa	omg Sweet Eliz, i love LOVELY COMPLEX!  it really is a great anime .     But yeah when i was in Elementary school I was tall close to tallest. Uptill i was in 7th-8th grade is when guys started catching up to my height.     I honestly prefer a guy who as tall or taller than me, Not for shallow reasons or masculinity, just my preference. If im crazy for a guy whos shorter than me ill still give him a shot though.    and yes its stupid|`|xZBroXsQaa	I think it's sad that people still discriminate on height, but in the choosing of a life partner, I don't think that people should do something that doesn't work for them or makes them uncomfortable. What works for you, might really not work for somebody else. I also think it's imperative that we're all different, otherwise we'd all be going after the same people, and there aren't enough of those specific people to satisfy us all. If that made any sense. lol.|`|oCG2JxsEaa	it is stupid.
ExftbSP7aa	say something kinky.  likee ... " i'm gonna go shower. i'll be thinking of you. ;] "  " hey sexy. "  " you're fxcking hot. "  anything that compliments him.  if you wanna be like really kinky ...  you can tell him your naked or something.    there are so many things you could say.  :]|`|dalNxu8zaa	then do sex talk...|`|X7FWTxIMaa	about to shower...you should be here LOL
gypWPBvLaa	there is no real way to its just on what you think is best some people might think you are a bad kisser but its your way someone will like it.|`|r4nBWJwLaa	it comes naturally at the spur of the moment. when the time comes you'll know trust me :)|`|yuwjQjKqaa	If you have to ask then you should not be doing it!|`|AYVQhXVjaa	You kiss them obviously.|`|KXYqCgWxaa	yeah i know u just do it when u first do it u will know|`|7Q0UBqBYaa	don't swallow their face and you'll be fine.  it comes naturally\|`|F13QmUIlaa	you just do it|`|BF5jmrDNaa	It's not something that's the same for everyone. Most guys have different kissing styles, so it changes from person to person. When there's a lot of tongue (which I don't care for whatsoever) you basically just focus on that. You can't get to the lips when there's another tongue in your mouth, so literally work around that. When it's just lips, you basically 'suck' the top of bottom lip, depending on what the guy is doing and what YOU want to do.   A lot of times, it's just closed mouth-to-mouth, in which case you just kiss their lips.  This is something that's not really meant to be explained, but more experienced. Trust me, when you get to the point of making out, you'll know what to do.
i7rYRvlTaa	ummm welll i have been dating a guy for 2 years so im pretty comfortable in front of him but if you know someone for like a day its not going to be comfortable to strip for him|`|9If6UnCZaa	i have flashed, mooned whatever you can call it in public around guys, so no im not shy(= and in private it got farther than just flashing or somehting. like clothes stayed off! ahaha ive said alott
wZMq5jqyaa	ummm.... I don't know. it's just a way of being polite I guess. good question. u get a starrrrr!!|`|dalNxu8zaa	i have feelings for u but i am not sure wat to do at this point|`|sV0fKe6jaa	they might be into you, or they're just being friendly. depends. need more detail.|`|WkDbNmIuaa	friendly hello|`|igTAIvzIaa	my boyfriend kisses my hand to make me feel like a queen, and very appreciated|`|8yDvL9sJaa	Its exciting different from the normal cheesy pick-up line! It sure makes a guy stand out! And yep he'd get points for getting my attention!
4IFXHz80aa	first of all, there is really no way to know if something will last forever right off the bat. this is something that youll learn once you start seriously dating her. secondly, its messed up if you hold her past against her. this shows no understanding, no trust, no forgiveness, and it shows how closed minded you are. Her past is what makes her her. i have a past drug addiction, abuse, and a string of unhealthy relationships and my husband loves me and does not hold it against me. learn the girl, hang with her, dig into her brain. if you begin to date her and it gets serious and you love her, you tend to get the feeling of wanting to spend every moment with her and this might be an indication that you want to be with her for the rest of your life. if after 6 months you still like her and you dont feel like you need a break, then the relationship might be real and you can then move to the next level.|`|aWbMtXIzaa	grow up. yes yes me again, just want you to actually think like a human being, i am hoping common sense gets through here, although i doubt it after the answers you have been given and you are still questioning it.do this girl a favor a leave her alone, dont beat her down for something she had no control over (the rape i am referring to here)
eLwZ5GD3aa	Lol if u want his cell number than if you see him with his cell texting someone or w.e just ask if u can see it and program your number in it and say text me some time :p communication is key just hold your breath and make the first move by asking who he likes or w.e
uhfFNaaAaa	Ew.    What a sleaze. I would definitely be bad if someone who supposedly "loved me", intimately danced with other girls and touched them.    Lousy boyfriend.    That, and you're only 14. You WILL break up soon anyway.|`|M3CsxF2jaa	girl he did get hard and he did touch. it's up to you to make a decision on what you wanna do. i tell you this. i believe in once you think it you did it... he needs to make up his mind and so do you. do you wanna be with this dude then forgive and forget if not leave him alone|`|EdidZdtlaa	if you trust him you shouldnt worry about what he was doing. but if he was about to get in a fight because of it then he must have been doing something wrong. you should be mad but its not that mad.you should be able to get over it soon|`|sZ1xbQXlaa	id be extremely pissed and you have every right to be too|`|9If6UnCZaa	oh id be pissed, im turning fourteen in 19 days and my bf is 15, too. if that was me, id be all over the situation, but then id try to get him to see im better than anygirl at the party|`|VuIed11caa	welllllllllllll yeah you should be madd!!! DUMP HIM OR DO SOMETHING BOUT IT!! that's shows how much he cares for you!|`|MHl8YLKKaa	your 14 theres much more important stuff to worry about you'll probably break up after a few months thats how highschool relationships work|`|XXlAs7QCaa	dump him he maybe doesnt care about yoiu after doing that and if he says he didnt do anything he is gonna do something else so just dump him|`|rIcCujOraa	Your boyfriend sucks if he was dancing with other girls... I could never dance with another girl. If I stop talking to my girl for 20 minutes she gets worried.|`|gypWPBvLaa	he probably thinks he is going to get with one of them if they got drunk and he probably doesn't love you sorry to say that but love at 14 15 is almost impossible to find and second he is probably cheating on you because a good guy wouldn't dance with a bunch of chicks if he really did love a girl.|`|MjbLGaegaa	i would be mad.   what if there is something he isnt telling you?    when boys dance with girls at parties if will often end in more than just a dance.|`|KkhlLy2Haa	He seems like he isn't very serious about the relationship. Just let him know how you feel. Let him know that its not okay to be doing that. If he respects you're feelings and really loves you then he wont keep going off dancing with other girls. He should be focusing his attention on you.|`|vtm8lpFDaa	I would be mad. I know my bf was when I was caught dancing with other guys in the club. Back then I didn't know we were exclusive so I just did my thing in the club. After that we had a serious talk about our relationship and established the fact that we were exclusive and should not be dancing and grinding other people in parties.    It really depends on how serious your relationship is. But you're only 14 and 15.... I don't think it's a big deal. These situations will keep on happening until you're in a life long relationship.. probably when you're in your twenties.|`|LKqbrHNnaa	Hi hun.  Some people find this acceptable in relationships, so some people on here are going to tell you that it's ok. But it doesn't matter they think - if you are not comfortable with it, you don't have to pretend to be comfortable with it.  Imagine this being the other way round, with you dancing on a boys lap or a load of boys dancing on you - how would your boyfriend react?    Personally, this is just how I would feel about it - I would not let him get away with it. I believe that if a person is in a relationship, they should act like it. If you were ok with it then it wouldn't be a problem.    Don't shout at him or attack him, or accuse him of cheating or looking at other girls. Just sit down with him, tell him you're glad he had fun and that you really like going out with him, but tell him firmly that it makes you sad when he does this with other girls and that you feel hurt by it.  If he gets mad, then he isn't really worth bothering with to be honest. If he tries to defend himself, ask him how he would like it if you went and danced on a boy, because at the end of the day, it's no different.    Good luck :)|`|ztcZ7mpSaa	LOL!!!!!! your only 14! You dont need to be worrying about a boyfriend...
FQU9JgLraa	err, no not in public she is going to humiliate you.    Kiss her feet behind closed doors, i love it|`|Cpp1LddVaa	No.  I understand she feels hurt, but it's clear that, even after you go through with something like that, you still won't be in the clear.  Instead, she'll keep bringing it up whenever you argue about something. Meanwhile, your resentment for being put through something like this will only grow until something worse happens.    I hate to say it, but maybe you just aren't meant to be together and should both move on . . .    Good luck.|`|Y77wbUZxaa	i think that she is just taking advantage of this situation on making you do that..if u already said sorry and she forgave you then that should be the end of it.    -and if you decide to do it, then watch out she doesn't keep rubbing the whole cheating part in ur face all the time by making you do stuff u don't want to do.|`|FsQez6wGaa	hell no, what if she doesnt take you back after that? dont waste your time on her|`|NVFCquuvaa	Im a girl, and in her case, I would punch you, be angry like hell for some days, but then quitely talk to you, forgive you, and say that you should be loyal, and a good person.|`|iU81YgRQaa	hmmm,  i'm not gonna lie, that is really weird, i would never make my boyfriend do that, i mean, sure, it might make her feel better, but is embarrassing you really the right way to start your relationship again?  it seems like a "two wrongs don''t make a right" situation to me|`|HCWkdk4naa	she's probably going to dump you publicly after you do it.  I would bet $100 this is a set up...|`|ulryrnDOaa	lol DO IT . she is right you loser|`|Fnsea1sMaa	that's ridiculous  she really shouldnt be making you do that.    to be honest, have you thought that she might not actually want to get back with you, and so she's just pretending to forgive you so that when you grovel at her feet, she can just reject you in front of all those people?    your apology to her should be private, so she's in the wrong wanting you to do this..    tell her no, that you'll say sorry privately but you wont do that for her, you still have your dignity.
3QG6WLXXaa	he flirts with you stares at you.|`|LLILtn4Naa	with some guys; you just cant tell.|`|Da1bmBQnaa	if he act different.weird,or somthing like that around u  he mite like u  thats wat i do wen i like a girl|`|mgzOLw7vaa	Well i think you would know if he:  - looks at you and when you look he looks away (shy much),  - has weird excuses to talk to you,  - calls you a lot,  - and even when you stand and he stands next to you, he would have his arm touch yours.|`|OmpRTBqdaa	He might focus more on you than on your friends if you're hanging out with him and a bunch of your friends|`|hGUUeXLhaa	people blush stare and listen to ur answers if they like u or luv u.  i have a crush on this girl and she is a such a chic!|`|kQYt5pFHaa	ummmm idk you will just know by the way he looks at you or acts around you or he may just come right out and say it

Buh they all look like they're full of themselves... ugh!|`|0TCFrA7iaa	the only guy i thought was hot is  5|`|OmpRTBqdaa	7. None of the above|`|FQU9JgLraa	Link contain a virus. Don't go to there|`|t6qQ44braa	Unless you have a fetish with immature, narcissistic, wannabe gangster types... Maybe you should raise your standards.|`|AfAYGLzuaa	none exactly my type, but number 3 is definitely the hottest.|`|P1a3Bo2aaa	they all look like BOYS to me    I don't consider BOYS to be HOT|`|H4H7HCAkaa	1|`|11BPJiECaa	2 & 6 look yummy!  lol
KBUPMW2Yaa	Ummmm, I think it's clear that maybe she's not the best friend ever if she can leave you so easily and not really care about you as much as she should....but I do think that you could "forgive her", her but don't forget it. From now on you should be careful and always aware that she's not the best friend and now you don't have the highest expectations from her and you don't have to treat her like she's your best friend.Maybe you should distance yourself from her...she's not the best example ever!    You obviously deserve better. Sorry about that!|`|j6SUkE4Raa	im not saying anything because i wasnt there and i dont judge people!|`|BMArzuJUaa	Sex at 13 with a relationship that lasted 5 days, she doesn't seem like to nice a girl, so no don't forgive her.|`|XXlAs7QCaa	no because if she would do that to you then she wouldnt care about that and she just wants to be a friend she just feels sorry for you she doesnt want to be friends with you|`|2jSX5nQkaa	hmm have you told her how you felt about everything she does?  its sounds like she kinda uses you. so she has someone to tell about all the things in her life to make it seem all about her?|`|F3mrZY50aa	If she has done this before, why did you give her a second chance then? If you value her friendship then I say you should try to get over it. Talk to her and tell her exactly what made you so upset, so she might understand and will hopefully be more attentive in the future. If, once you think about why you 'took her back' before, you realize it just isn't worth it, then I would say to talk to her and tell her that the friendship is over. Don't lead her on either way...either forgive her or tell her goodbye.
f8fs6kycaa	Ask her whats wrong...relations however longer it is...it doesnt matter...its like how strong your relation is...all girls are not the same...she might be jealous because maybe she doesnt want any1 to c u like dat..(any othr girl)...mayb she because she really loves you...ask her clear the things between you 2|`|p2Wh2HoJaa	She's probably just feeling self concious and thinks some other girl might see that picture an yea. It's a typical behavior. Either that, or she might feel that she doesn't look so good in it or something. I dunno!|`|AXsTB96Faa	maybe she is afraid of loosing you
TYBkDHYNaa	I'm still a virgin too and I think that is perfectly  fine, if you are not ready to get into it, especially if  that person is not special to you no matter what people say, I know most people seem to be doing it and all that but I think you first time should always be special. I guess the whole turn off thing depends on the guy, some guys like that idea some don't be careful though because some guys just want to hit it and run and taht could be hard if you get attached to them well good luck remember don't rush into it because of what people say. take care|`|sZ1xbQXlaa	guys like to be a girls first lol but its whatever you make it to be|`|BqxYa9tEaa	It's not a bad thing.  You have standards.    Guys don't get turned off by this.|`|g0q6ny9qaa	well it depends on the guy but I think thats fine it realldoesn'tnmadderer to me personally|`|dm9evixvaa	personally for me i'd say its a good thing since i'm a virgin too, and i have a lot of respect for people who remain virgins until they truly feel they are ready.|`|3QG6WLXXaa	good thing.|`|KkhlLy2Haa	It shouldn't matter to the guys if they're nice guys.|`|OmpRTBqdaa	That depends on how old you are|`|MHl8YLKKaa	if there highschool guys they dont care, older more experiance guys dont want to deal with the stuff that comes with taking virginity so they wont even bother, so it goes both ways|`|LXkGQXkQaa	there's a few answers to that - firstly your age would make a difference and what kinda guy you like and their opinion - everyone has different views - didnt stop me though - was very young tho|`|16df2c57ee3a349250108f2ca40b8bf0aa	well,   honestly any guy who'd think thats a turn off is a complete waste of time.  don't think you have to do that kinda stuff to get boys to like you and think you're great.  there just sick and thats something you need to decide on for yourself,  not let others choose it for you.|`|Ga2dMpB7aa	It's a good thing, in my opinion! I'm one of those weirdos who wants to wait till after she's married. Anyway, if the guy you're in a relationship with is decent, he won't care if you're a virgin or not, because he won't be in it just for sex. He'll love being around you for who you are.
KvphGLGVaa	don't text him back yet. that might make you look desprate. if he looks at his phone and it says he has like 3 new text messages from the same person he might be creeped out.    wait a couple days or so.|`|WGAFP6mSaa	STOP YELLING! IT'S NOT POLITE..    Let him text you back. If not, you'll sound desperate.
pLZiKPFgaa	If you are actively seeking employment I'm sure many women out there including me would be willing to take a chance with you. Its exactly what happened to my boyfriend. Hes actually about to lose his. and to me money doesnt mean everything.|`|0QTCiCf8aa	CONFIDENCE !!! outgoingness, over all optimistic outlook on life, and a humorous soul - this is me personally but I think many women would agree|`|ygimTNzoaa	Hopefully you have a car, I like to see that you're putting an effort to a future though I know it's hard with the economy as it is, I'm working at a gas station part time but it's all I can get. I have a black 2006 VW passat and can hardly make the payments anymore. Life sucks. I'm in Cincinnati, Ohio 23 years old. Just expect respectful guys into my music and outdoors. And animals. I got a cat. Ahm I dont know. I think I like older guys because I get more of a sence usually of who they are, they've had their "fun" in life and are looking to settle down. I don't like drama and I'd like long term, but I know it doesn't always turn out that way. That's kind've a hard question I think I got off topic lol.|`|dalNxu8zaa	someone who is fun and nice nad just likes being around me and listens to me...    i lost my job to cuz of the whole economic thing|`|AA10500537	i guess someone with a job  but not many people have one today|`|EOhSZuduaa	if youre so attractive then become a stripper, it solves one of your two problems. with the money you get from stripping, you can use it to attract women easier.|`|QCL7WIEtaa	Someone who uses good grammer! :-D|`|RTUCzzixaa	Unemployed guys are irresistible!        just kidding:p
lG5Xl7UQaa	Pick the one that you have most in common with and you can talk about stuff with her. Also which one looks your type and acts out going. Make sure you can trust her too . Or sure why don't you just take the time and get to know all and then decide which one .. ask people around that know them so they can tell you things about them .     But good luck :) hope you make the right choice lol|`|OmpRTBqdaa	Pick the one that seems like she's faithful and wouldn't change anything about herself|`|JJg6RQIOaa	Do you like any of them? If not, then just do what Kassandra said, pick the one who seems faithful.    You don't even need to go out with any of them if you don't want to.    If you do like one of them, just pick that one.
f0d55686c27224fe5aeb9874af55e9e9aa	I feel you!   I am 27 and going through the same with a guy i met online. I have a major crush on him, i have felt like i am in love, and i really think that is weirdo behaviour.     I think you could talk to him and tell him you are confused. If he is sincere he will embrace your doubts and do what he needs to do make it work.   I think that if someone has doubt someone is playing them it is because they have reasons to feel that.      The only way you can know is by talking to him, on the phone, not text, try to call him if he doesnt answer or doesnt want to take it to the next level it is because they are not sincere.      Good luck!|`|9e20cabaf1ecf0acafc3c11e5cd3f3d0aa	Ok. So first of all, your 16 and this is not going to be your "love of your life" but i realize your 16, and your going through school and are having your little "boyfriends". So this is what I think.... First... He lives far away from you. And long-distance relationships at your age, arnt really true. hes not going to be true with you, for the most part.. BUT never know!! he just  might be and surpise everyone! second...  hes 17.. and is at his age where he wants to run around. he may be serious as hell, to you right now.. flirting with you, and all and saying he loves you. but does he really? until someone else comes into the pic.... well... this is just my opinion. I think that you should be careful with him. GO step by step and see how it goes, but dont fall into it deep, cause thats probley what hes wanting then hes gonna say see-ya! and then your gonna be heart broken... talk to your friends about it, see what they say. By the way im 21 writting this, im not a lil teenager trying to act like i know it all. but i have 2 little sisters, one 16 and one 14. I know what they go througth,and what i have gone through my self... anyway! good luck with it :)
dalNxu8zaa	alot of things turn me on u just have to mess around and f ind out|`|tO8ey3o8aa	wen he grabs my butt|`|WPRAfLO7aa	A lot of things, haha. I like when he whispers to me in the middle of making out.|`|Fnsea1sMaa	kissing my neck  soo hot  trust me    and kissing my chest, like below my neck but above my boobs    just kiss her all over really,  its pretty nice|`|0OSeBeLaaa	i like a guy who is open and honest|`|hYRP0x2Eaa	Hmm...well i'm weird, but watching my boyfriend play a video game really well turns me on.

And when we are making out, it turns me on when he kisses my neck.|`|X7hm4fJXaa	lol|`|cvWFTy3laa	biting,pulling my hair,massaging,rubbing,i'm weird like that!|`|EBcrB2Dnaa	i like it when a guy is sweet and funny :)  and i have no clue about the making out thing :P  If your really nice to a girl...well that goes a loong way!!! :D|`|SRlzo5yXaa	shirtless guys, and talking like that|`|xWYEQm1Vaa	What turns me on is flirting.i love it when a guy puts his arm around me.and when im making out, i like it when he pulls me in and holds on to me.  ;)|`|8LEPfGoBaa	pple dat flirt w/ me really turn me on.|`|Izv6Qj4caa	being gentle and rough...  deep kisses..and especially kissing and sucking on my neck..i love that..lol|`|xfqHbM3kaa	Actually its kinda odd but long hair on a guy does..|`|igTAIvzIaa	when my boyfriend puts his hand behind my neck and kisses me, and when he kisses my neck, or rubs my thigh when making out with me|`|rghmhhMKaa	i like guys who are themselves and when i makeout i like when guys hold me close sorta like a hug ....hope i helped  :/
FrfgGlCeaa	My sister is in 6th grade, and she likes guys who are outgoing and not shy. Guys who will be themselves even if they act totally goofy. She also likes guys who don't flirt with other girls and focus on just one girl. And I know this is only 6th grade, but don't get nad when you see the girl talking to another guy- it doesn't mean anything!|`|qyYYrIdmaa	Good question. Nobody really knows the full answer though.|`|5A7RmIH6aa	for you? a hot bicycle.|`|mzJTZlIvaa	6th grade girls usually like outgoing guys. Although I doubt anyone in the 6th grade is really that hot, wait till you get to highschool. lols.|`|ZGLokR96aa	hahahah. well. i guess i really look for style. also, when guys make me laugh.|`|niYixDU4aa	we like hot guys, just like you like hot girls.  ok?  if you're ugly, too bad we don't like you.        i'm just kidding, but it seems that's all you care about, so why should we care about anything else?
SvIBu4yRaa	i don't think that should be the top priority at the moment since you're having babies and all but from what you're saying i can infer that he is interested and really cares about you.|`|Qx8vHPadaa	Yes|`|gibXCjJ5aa	Marry him
hwmKn5Xsaa	if i knew you guys i would think you are dating or at least seeing eachother. if you guys do all that stuff together that is pretty much described as bf - gf behavior.   i don't think he would have asked what you two are if he didn't want to be your bf.  that is just his way of ssaying things. bring it up next time and don't ask what he wants to be say what you want to be, if you both like eachother then there is no reason not to date. tell him that you may have feelings for him that are more then friendship feelings.    i think he didn't ask you because of your answer, it might have make him think that you don't want to be anything else, which clearly is wrong. talk to the boy!!  good luck!|`|E61btCG8aa	He's just nervous to ask that question..Or maybe he fears that he might lose you by asking that question..So, next time make him ask that question..ask him why such a nice guy like him has no gf! it will stump him..LOL|`|WgVKG4h3aa	He didn't ask you to be his girl because he's comfortable with the way things are.  You two have fun without any obligations or consequences. I guess the real question here is what do you want to be? If you want to be his gf than just say it to him straight! And if you're comfortable with having this sort of a relationship than be it. Just have fun
W7l1awFPaa	Apologise to him first for being grumpy.  How long were you going out together?  If you were fighting a lot before will that change?  If he has already started losing feelings for you then maybe the love isn't really strong in the first place.  Some girls I have dated I have broken up with after the first fight because I realised that I wasn't really interested in her after all but other girls I have been doing the best I could to get back with them because I really loved them and I thought we could make a go of it.    So, the main two questions are: Are you really interested in him? And is he really interested in you?  If the answer is yes to both then go for it, but if it is no to either then don't bother trying to keep the romance going just be friends.|`|01GbQLZwaa	flirt subtly if you get what i mean. You still will be playing hard to get but it will just tease him a little and show that you are still interest but whatever you do don't fight about what happened and if he tries to just admit what you did was wrong and tell him that he needs to try and understand that ppl sometimes just get grouchy and that if he came over to point out everything that you did wrong its a waste of time bc you know how you messed up.|`|L2UUj2hjaa	If you play hard.. it'll make things harder and move him away. If you play tooo to nice he'll think you're weird. Be in between, be mature, flirt a bit if you want, and be yourself. And come out with the truth and apolgize to him that you were being grumpy and your confident that this relationship may work again if he is willing to help to. There is no perfect chance you can get him back, but there still is a high chance.|`|cWh9z8Bjaa	Not hard to get, you dont have to drool over him flirty, but be nice to him.  Hard to get is a pain in the ***, i don't know where girls got the idea it was a good thing.|`|8lLrykqJaa	be your self when your just with a guy who is strickly a friend than he might realize how much he liked you in the begining but if you play flirty you might pull him farther away from him  that was my brothers opinion he leanred that from personal experences|`|Cpp1LddVaa	While being "grumpy" and "hard to get" are bad ideas, you also shouldn't wear yourself out trying to be miss bubbly congenial whatever either.    Instead, there should be a mutual attitude of I get stressed, you get stressed, we shouldn't take it out on each other but sometimes we mess up and we do.  We think we have something special -- more than "just friends" -- but we're both young and learning.  Is there a place where we can meet and exist in the middle?    As a side note, whenever you are NOT feeling wonderful, resist the urge to accuse him and instead talk about how you feel -- it  gets him (and others) off the defensive so they can be more sympathetic about how and what you're feeling.  "When someone does X, I feel Y."    Also, rather than viewing the two of you as sitting on opposite sides of a table battling each other, imagine sitting on the SAME SIDE of  that table and battling the problem together.    Hope this helps.  Good luck and best wishes.|`|gypWPBvLaa	well are you more of a flirt or hard to get with other guys? if your more of a flirt then try the other and vice verse or just do what you normaly do with him
oCG2JxsEaa	both!|`|i7rYRvlTaa	brunette|`|NNiN0tK0aa	Show me pictures of people I don't know, I'll always choose the pretty blonde.

toKpvuGSaa	I'm your exact age exact same situation except I never even kissed a guy my friends say the same thing but I tell them everything happens for a reason and I'll get into that when im ready and so should you its your life if they think your a prude that's on them be yourself|`|jwurmVbVaa	in my opinion you are.|`|yq9lgYGDaa	Stick as close as you can to God  He'll let you know if you are supposed to date anyone yet  and the nice guys aren't dead  just hard to find    and your friend is missing out on the pure love God has for her but it seems like you aren't|`|Da1bmBQnaa	yes u r  wahoooo!!!!!!!!!!!!!
oLTUn51Uaa	it depends on the guy, some guys get a woman/girl pregnant and just leave her without any feelings, some guys feel closer|`|VtvcOHZsaa	yes sex chemically attracts the couple, good or bad.|`|5tnPty72aa	It connects the man to his wife and the baby but sex always should connect a couple.
yhsi0sWzaa	she is just kidding|`|40xAVBblaa	she probably didn't mean it|`|eLwZ5GD3aa	I'm pretty sure this a waste of your 5 points|`|da1Vqmbqaa	she didn't really mean it then-
lWxOp7OPaa	Depends how she said it...it she was like laughing about it and stuff she was just teasing you... but if she was like grossed out or something then she literally meant YOUR WIERD|`|i7rYRvlTaa	girls joke sometimes when they say your weird|`|HCWkdk4naa	it means that she thinks you are weird.  if she is a weird lady herself, take it with a grain of salt.  ask your mom if you are weird, mom's advice is the best.|`|dalNxu8zaa	some girls mean it and other girls just joke about it...  depends on wat u were doing at the time she said it|`|v9ihmSoNaa	it means she doesnt like you and is hinting that you are annoying. maybe she has anxiety|`|McOF0DVnaa	its a good thing, she likes you.  she has singled you out from the normal.  it doesnt matter what a girl says, if she singles you out in any way (unless its something like you smell or you are ugly)  then its a sign|`|EAke8Ms8aa	she said that cause you are not like her. everyone is different, so we are all weird.|`|rgqDS5VKaa	She most likely likes you, or thinks you like her
1fB2UdRHaa	I don't know you, but I am really sorry that some degenerate waste of human life did that to you.     You should tell your boyfriend what happened, otherwise he might be thinking something else. If he really cares for you he will probably "flip out" and be a little mad that you haven't told him but more than that he will want the rapist dead. The best thing you can do is talk about it with people that love and support you, it's very important.|`|OmpRTBqdaa	Ohhhhhhhhh i'm so sorry to hear that|`|da1Vqmbqaa	if u trust him and think hell respect that then tell him-|`|MWz3Yb6Raa	tell it  will be so much  better if you  get it off  your chest|`|E61btCG8aa	Sorry to hear this...Do you know the guy that raped you? Tell your bf and if possible the guy who did it as well..If he likes you, he is going to be more protective about it..If he dumps you for this, you are lucky not to have carried this relationship forward..|`|7wHVTkj3aa	okay,well im only 16 but i think that you should tell him. if you care then you shpuld.he might be able to help you. and maybe you could ask for help...and maybe he could help...  and im proud of u that you can still live ur life after what has happend..|`|I6pmPb1Baa	tell him, it will make you feel SO much better to get it off your chest.
jkDawQVNaa	just tell them you love your birthday suit
H5NVYoNOaa	one of the questions that only god can answer .|`|ed98cf0ff3753b1358a5edf38dc953b1aa	because we're awesome like that..and usually it's more like 1-4 hours of sleep that we get when friends are over|`|R0U4qy6haa	just goes to show you that some women can talk all day - and still not say anything
9PwS5gcVaa	I would have to say that I would be the most upset about the first one where he was having sex because that to me is one of the most hurtful and disrespectful thing to do.As for the second option where he apparently was growing apart from me I would have to be more understanding, (Because you can't always help who you love or fall in love with) I would be less upset becaue atleast he would end up leaving me without having sex with someone else while we were together.|`|uZC7fAkJaa	To women emotions are very important and I can compete with another woman on my appearance. But if you went to her for something emotional it would be hurting. Guys are not emotional right out and that means you are losing him if you cant keep his emotions. Guys can look at sex as just sex and not want a relationship or anything else.|`|XxPhbwNfaa	I would be equally upset either way.  Cheating suggests that it is being done behind my back, with knowledge aforethought.  The intent has less to do with it than the allowing it to go on, and not tell me about it.  A partner who would cheat is a liar.  Liars are untrustworthy with your secrets.|`|gp5KrhrPaa	Second one.|`|7Yzk6EbGaa	either one would piss me off tbh, but probably the first one would make me madder|`|mYe6TDmzaa	The second one.  I would be hurt and scared of loosing them but I know I would leave them any way if they cheated on me.|`|8VEEihaqaa	Emotion.  It's the subconscious connection that lasts much longer than the physical connection of sex.
V2IGDBHIaa	Things and people change as their surrounding around them change.  1. If you say your relationship is open right now, do both of you have the same idea on what this means for both of you? It is hard being in long distance relationships, but being able to talk to each other everyday can help. It isn't wrong for you to be jealous since you love him. His care for you could still make him consider another relationship, but either your views on relationships and his are different or your love for him is greater than his for you since you wouldn't consider seeing someone else and he would.  2. People can say many things, but they are just words unless the actions go with it. If he isn't comfortable with talking about his feelings, you could try to talk about them in a different way or give him some time, although after a year and a half, that can be a long time. Does he not call as much because there are obligations he has to attend to or is it another reason?  3. Considering that he is a guy and that you two haven't been together for some time, the sex is going to be on his mind, let him know what you are feeling and thinking about the whole transition.  4. Are you one of his closest friend because he finds you attractive or because of things you two have been through and the things you two talk about? It can be hard to commit sometimes, but is this lack of commitment due to the two of you being apart or because this is his nature?  5. I think it is only fair that you and him both call instead of you calling almost all the time and him rarely calling. If he really felt guilty about this, shouldn't he call more?    I think it is normal that you are putting so much effort into this, you really do love and care about this guy. Giving up is sometimes seen as the easy way out, although considering the feelings you seem to have for this guy, it won't be easy for you either one you choose. You should choose whichever it is that make you happy in the long run. I'm not sure if he cares for you, but if he did, then he isn't showing it very well. Moving up there is a huge decision, I think that until you two actually can solve this, moving up there could be a rash decision you are having to try to solve this problem and it could backfire instead. People take risks for happiness, and if you believe that you will be happy moving there in the long run, then it could be worth the risk, no one can tell you for sure since it is your happiness that is on the line here. Hope this helps. Good luck.|`|EyiCVm6Oaa	wow. that was long. i think u should move over there if u love him a lot and you shoudl talk to him about if u should move up there before u move up there to see his reaction. And if u talk to him everyday i think he likes u!|`|pqZAhBLvaa	First of all, if you truly loved him, you would not be "hooking up" with other people that mean nothing to you.Same goes for him. People can go a very long time without sex, it seems very immature to me that you guys chose to have an open relationship if you have expectations of long term commitment. Of course you should be jealous. Who wouldn't be? The only way an open relationship would work, is if you both keep your shenanigans to yourselves, and if you are both truly comfortable with it. You guys have neither of those things going on. Once you open that door in a relationship, it is next to impossible to close. Should you move there? That's up to you. But if you can't make it work miles apart, how is your relationship going to work once you pile on all of the day to day stuff? Seems complicated enough already! I have had plenty of friends with benefits, and I have truly loved people, but never at the same time. Good luck to you!|`|LLeQyWGcaa	i don't think i would move up there, you are just setting yourself up for a fall. if i were him i would go out with my buddies and not get involved in a relationship. i would be jealous too honey, but that's what happens when you really care for someone and he is with someone else. there is more to a relationship than sex. if that's all he wants you up there for i would say forget it. you can find that around here with a guy who treats you how you deserve to be treated. if it was true love, he would commit to  you if you were with him or not. don't go there honey.
QAwwmDuDaa	Don't worry dear,just ask him if he still feels the same about you and him.|`|McOF0DVnaa	how old are you? you dont know what love is.  "dump" him and stop worrying about relationships.  have fun.  its not worth worrying about|`|leU4QY9iaa	well, You can:  1. Either try to go out more with him  2. Break up with him - I know you love him, But after a while he's going to dump you ): so, you should bet him to it. - He'll either move on or want you more.  3. Tell him what he's making you feeel.  Im sorry, I hope things work out ok for you :)|`|oeNf5B9Baa	This isn't what you want to hear BUT if you want this to last you have to break up with him.  This is because guys are idiots and they mistreat the girls they love to see how far they can take it. You my dear is letting it get really far. What will it take to make you blow? Him having sex with someone else on your bed?     IF he still cares than he'll come back if not than you can find someone better.  But do this now before things go horribly wrong|`|SpSnRor6aa	well i think he wants 2 break it up with u, but finding it hard so he's trying to make u jealous so u dump him but don't take what I'm saying to seriously (i don't understand guys minds!)  What u should do is talk 2 him and ask him if he wants to end it n if he loves u then everyone's happy but if he does dumps you then don't be to upset most guys don't end it with girls because they don't want to see her cry (bless there heart, poor sods)     I hope everything works out for the best! :-)|`|0OHdULR0aa	buddy dont get too emotional; its quite natural that at your young age you get attracted to your opposite sex; its that bubbly feeling, thats sprouting when you are in your early teens; dont consider this as a real relationship and start really worrying; concentrate on your studies as thats the most important task at this stage of your life; you have a lot of time to decide about your life partner, romance, love, marriage at later part of your life; just enjoy the company of your bf; but dont be too emotional;  good luck buddy|`|H6ugevITaa	Dump Himx|`|ZxI8SgMFaa	Dump him before he dumps you!
1KjfZAWzaa	Second one is good.    But you could always pay a random person to kick him between the legs, too. That would work.|`|WvOvoxLxaa	I don't know why he is your ex, but trying to hurt someone shows how immature you are and explains why you are the ex.  Maybe he got tired of being used.   One thing guys always said was if a girl complained about his size she must have been huge and he would need a two by four tacked to his *** so he wouldn't fall in.  Think before you do anything hurtful, it could come back and get you.|`|yuOuoCfDaa	If he is a jerk----let him be.  Just chalk it up as a mistake that you made.  I am pretty sure you knew he was a jerk and continued to be with him.  Now that he has completely played you, you want to get back. F him move on|`|RTUCzzixaa	Post a blog how bad he was in bed and email links to all his friends! :D|`|r81wOkp1aa	JUST GO SHAG HIS BEST MATE|`|H5NVYoNOaa	does he have a brother????????????????????????
ygimTNzoaa	Similar things happen to me. Usually their friends will tell me it's because someone else with a webcam is doing dirty things for them lol. Seriously they like that the horney bastards. Oh well. I don't strip for people online. They'll put themself on invisible so they're not Interrupted while they're getting their jolly off for hours.|`|5CI2YHoqaa	His wife has probably found out what he's been up to so he's giving you a wide birth. Id move on hun get a real life boy friend they r much more fun.|`|I1bAIFMXaa	I am afraid to say that maybe he isn't getting what he wants out of your little relationship.|`|x5f6AqDBaa	i might be in your same situation i know he feeling is horrible|`|yuOuoCfDaa	Cause he's a perv roaming the internet for free sex.  Call it like you see it!!!  Who cares anyway, it amazes me the people that people actually take serious|`|pSpWOsiQaa	weird ****|`|kykmpr0Caa	he isnt interested, or he isnt who he made out to be|`|SRd1UmcDaa	I dunno. Send him an email and ask straight out if he's avoiding you.|`|fJaZlJQXaa	Because he's ignoring you on purpose or is too busy with other people to talk to you.|`|kt9iXMWUaa	It sounds like he may no longer be interested.  But don't give up.  Have your tried to let him know you miss him?|`|ngbFVluiaa	sorry but he clearly doesn't want to speak to you anymore, as he is blocking you.  dont worry about it, it says more about his character than it does yours.  dont email him though - you either wont get a response which will make you feel worse, or he will reply a few days later with lies.
gypWPBvLaa	lol i did i was staying there when i was 13 and i met this 13 year old girl there we went alone to alot of places together we kissed for the first time for both of us after the tea cups while we were waiting for food from our parents after that we hung out in the hotel till like midnight we finally went out and we hung out for the rest of the week but then she had to go and i never heard from her or saw her again... :(|`|Aj2iJZXJaa	I don't have any cute love story's sorry! I wish I did. Do you want to meet your true love at Disneyland or Disney world? ~I LOVE DEREK|`|C0Dj76OMaa	my first boyfriend-ish guy and i were dancing at the dance, it was my favorite song lips of an angel, the song was over and before i went to pull away he kissed me. It was my first kiss haha, it was kind of cute!|`|Bydye6Muaa	no, but i wanna here answers
VtvcOHZsaa	Just continue hanging out together so you can grow closer and develop that relationship.|`|nz8o3lLSaa	It sound like that purity ring will only come off in exchange for a wedding ring.  That sucks.    Try heavy petting.  That is still legal.
SE5KO4BSaa	she is ether day dreaming or she is really into you. Hold eye contact untill she looks away. Hope that helps .|`|kDsQASr4aa	supposedly you have a moment and that could lead to love, often times girls are the first to turn away seeing means theyre shy|`|zW8tc64qaa	Make her look away first. It only takes the brain half a second to determine what an image is. Any longer than that, and she just might be interested. She could also just be looking in your direction, and not actually at you.|`|xfqHbM3kaa	When I do that to a guy I always meant it as a "Hey,notice me!Talk to me!" type of move.  Overall I think she really does have something for you.Believe me,If a girl doesn't give you that kind of eye contact she is not interested.  If it gets awkward for you just don't look.|`|wZMq5jqyaa	umm..that's sooo awkward. and it can mean that u 2 had like a connection.|`|ddf488e8aadc005298da52c8383e091faa	just go with the flow. i think she is in to you. but i dont know how well you guys are in a relationship.|`|Aj2iJZXJaa	She thinks that your HOT and wants you to look at her, this a way of getting a guys attention. It is what I do too. ~I LOVE DEREK|`|x5f6AqDBaa	she likes u definitely|`|AA10614910	No, it doesn't. But I guess everyone else will tell you it means love at first sight.|`|yuOuoCfDaa	I dont think there is a specific reaction to this.........maybe you should approach her when times allows you to speak.  Then you will know exactly what the eye contact is about|`|E3O2Gi0Uaa	Yes, I practice that alot. I've asked this questions b4 and some ladies said it shows the guy is confident. In the beginning it was kinda scary. Now, I feel powerful that I can make a girl look away first. If she holds it for a long time or she turns away really, really, REALLY quickly; go over and talk to her.
hwEMBWeFaa	okay im a pro at this.guys want what they cant have so you make him want you like doing little flirty things like make eye contact,grab his arm when you walk by etc.  then when you know youve got him signs of this are-he talks about you,stares at you,acts like a little boy,becomes quite,etc.  once he starts doin that you make no effort to talk to him just be like an eye candy cause you know hes watching you so maybe start teasing someone else and hell become very jelous and soon enough hell be crushing on you in no time..its a little cruel but it works liek a charm|`|7YWaao6Raa	mutual intrests|`|onAEy5jTaa	Some people would tell you to act sexy and older, and blah blah blah. But don't listen to any of that nonsense. People will only like you for who you are, not who you pretend to be. Be yourself, but make a move. Talk to him and try to become friends. Everything takes time. Gradually, he might start to like you. But you can't MAKE him! Hope I helped!|`|Fnsea1sMaa	smile lots around him  laugh at his jokes  touch his arm etc    wear some extra makeup that makes you confident|`|quYp2Ajtaa	The best you can do is get to know them and hope that they like who you are, you can't make people like people sweetie|`|Da1bmBQnaa	at first i look at there aperence  then i talk to them if they have good humor i like that about them  if they r not atractive and glum i dont like them|`|55CpRJDvaa	You can't make someone like you.|`|n69RE8Fyaa	Money...|`|SLRScJ08aa	learn to know him, do's and donts, but if u really try and just keep thinking about him, u can get him to like u|`|pvAX7Gvzaa	Hi   To get a lad to like you? hmmm.  Be Flirty with him, make sure you get the message across that you like him, not directly like "I LIKE YOU" just make sure he see's as someone who is not quite a mate (Just mates stage is BAD) and make sure that you don't scare him away    DO NOT WEAR MAKE-UP to much make up scares boys away .... just make sure your eye candy for the male and let him come to you     hope this helps :)
1fB2UdRHaa	The second photo is definitely the best out of the three, I did not really like the first, the third was okay.|`|sZ1xbQXlaa	the second one looks the best it looks more natural and pretty. no homo|`|oCG2JxsEaa	the second one!|`|AA10268438	Well you're very pretty. The 3rdlooks cool but I love your hair in the first one. First one for sure.|`|qwVruoJ8aa	The second one look pretty you are very pretty girl|`|5P6m4Gs4aa	I think you ask  which girl I most  willingly pucker  my lips for  I pick 2nd one    Jack|`|kH334oBxaa	the second 1 is georgeous!!|`|KXYqCgWxaa	sry they all look jacked up and scary u look like ur about to go to a Halloween party|`|ngbFVluiaa	wow.  the first one for sure.  you know this already clearly, but damn you look good.|`|uqTKkKVraa	i think the second one is hella pretty!!!|`|pJ48VhoKaa	very pretty honey|`|OapHWjVOaa	Number 1 is the cutest but the third is the most creative :)
gZWMvIX0aa	best shout is to give him the blunt option ya sit him down and start talking calmly if hes not listening hes not going to which means ya gonna get no where either approach it in a cute i love you way or a very submissive cry way if you don't get the reaction you look in for best bets to leave or soon things will just get you more and more down|`|M3CsxF2jaa	leave him. he will never change most men wont.. trust me on this one|`|e276df96c55a338c1e69a8869d0cd199aa	You can't make him do anything.  He is who he is.  You either love him and accept him for who he is, or you dump him and find someone better suited for you.  That means you go out and find a guy who shares the same beliefs, ethics and problem solving skills that you have.|`|Wt62GmgRaa	well it takes time and experience. Be Diligent and patients with guys. the only way he will see your side is if he becomes satisfied with the way things turn out. Think about it, that is the only way he will let go.|`|L2UUj2hjaa	Honestly, you will have to have a private talk with him about his problems and how it's hurting you and possibly moving you away from him. If he promises he'll change, face his problems instead of running away from them, and actually caring about you, then that's a good step. Just be there to support him the whole way and correct his mistakes. An example of supporting is willing to change a negative habit that you have yourself to. It may motivate him and make him feel the need for change. If he does not understand and make a big fuss, then you have the choice of either living with it the rest of your life unless he breaks up with you, or just dumping him and moving on. Ever seen how he talks to his family? How he treats them? That is a big reflection/example of how he will treat you in the future unless he makes a huge change in his attitude. Also understand where he's coming from and if he's had childhood problems.|`|AA11635143	You are not his mother and should stop trying to force him to do anything.  You gave him money to put in HIS bank account?!!  Oh, heck no, not a snowballs chance in Hell of me ever doing that.  So he didn't make the bank deposit; you did your part and if the bill doesn't get paid, it is his problem.  Let it go and stop trying to get the "last word" about everything.    This relationship is a train wreck just waiting to happen.  Love doesn't constantly argue and fight and insist on always getting its own way.    Believe me, this anger that is building up between you and your boyfriend is about to explode into abuse and probably get you some time in jail.  Staying in this relationship is like pushing a wet rope; it isn't going anywhere.
uff3kOoFaa	introduce yourself, first of all.  second, start a conversation about like her interests or something.  whether or not she likes sports, if so, what kind? what is she interested in? what does she do for fun? try to learn things about her from her.  show her you are interested.  talk to her like you would talk to any other person. :)|`|1b2bc4cbaaaee9bc78c1d52504a762b6aa	say hi and introduce yourself if you already haven't then ask her a question about what she likes or about classes or compliment her.|`|7bKDz2C9aa	Well, I would start with something you both have in common. Like sports teams or how you both hate the math teacher.
K2QwEM4raa	If you have been flirting with him for 2 years and nothing has happened then I think he must like you as a friend.  Move on.|`|3GNpVz5naa	well i liked a guy for 2 years too  but his best friend liked me but he never told me cause he knew i liked his friend  but i ended up getting over that guy i liked for 2 years and went for the one that liked me    get over him  cause you might be missing out on other ppl who actually want you|`|M3CsxF2jaa	ask him then get your answer so you wont worry about it|`|qyYYrIdmaa	It's 'flirting'. Guys like good spellers. It's a turn on|`|LLILtn4Naa	its not "true love" but its a crush; tell him.|`|e276df96c55a338c1e69a8869d0cd199aa	1. Concentrate on your school work and learn to spell "flirt" as well as other words.    2.  Vowels are an important part of speech and writing.    3.  He knows you like him, you've been bugging him for 2 years.  If he hasn't asked you out by now, he doesn't like you back.  Time to get over it.|`|HCWkdk4naa	idk wut "flurting" iz.  when you grow out of chat speak, you will grow out of developing crushes on guys who aren't interested in you.  when i was young, i got crushes all the time on guys who weren't really into me.  when i grew up, i could only crush on guys i had a chance with.  you say now that you can't forget about him, but you will.|`|40xAVBblaa	get over him try to find someone else 2years is to long|`|GMA3pDCGaa	As soon as he gets serious with you, he better put most of his attention on you and no one ales|`|2Sw7lVueaa	let him know you like him . i mean dont out right say it cuz u might scare him off but let him know u like him. if you like him enough wait for him if you dont move on|`|NXpIlJ1Daa	well invite him to a movie saturday or friday make sure your alone with him then maybe go dancing at a teen club or maybe a circus then let him win you something then let him walk or drive you home then give him a kiss worked for me|`|Dm2TnQKKaa	It sounds like this is just the way he is with everyone. If you've been flirting with him for two years and nothing has happened, I'm sorry but I don't think anything will. About it being "true love or not".. you have to think about how old you are, and where you are in life. I know what you mean about it being hard to forget about him, but at least try. Occupy your time with friends or hobbies, instead of thinking about him.|`|gfbcxROUaa	if he does it with all the girls, it doesnt sound like you should be too into that. hes a charmer, sure hes appealing but think of the consequences if you do date
aLl5RGetaa	when back always sit on yahoo messenger|`|Dlbnl7cRaa	$$$$$$$$$$       "BE MENTAL"      $$$$$$$$$$$
IBTpUHIwaa	Yeah, neither. Just seeing what else is out there. I'm guessing you still like her? Well, don't wait for her because shes not waiting for you. If she realizes one day that your the best for her, then she'll let you know. Just don't wait for one person, it's not worth it half the time. Go have fun and show someone who's worth your time what you have to offer!|`|t0MiDBMEaa	Are the 3 other guys going to your school?

Find another girl who's not going to be like a light switch (off and on and off and on).  The thing is long distance relationships are cute but don't always work out.

There is nothing wrong with her going out with different guys. once you get older you will understand the difference between dating and being a couple.   and maybe shes just searching for the one that will treat her right.|`|M0cRnQ1Daa	she is a hoe, move on|`|2jSX5nQkaa	ok if she started dating other guy its not about you.   sorry lol but she just hasnt found a guy thats right for her so she moves to other ones hoping that they are good for her. idk thats my opinion.|`|mJ9BveFjaa	Neither|`|udbEljJsaa	She has moved on and is interested in dating other people now.     You should look into other people instead of her.|`|AA10929980	some girls just become restless being with the same guy for a certain period of time. She may like the way it is when a relationship is new and once that feeling is gone she finds someone new to feel that feeling again.   Or she just hasn't found the right guy yet. Sorry I don't think she is trying to get your attention by dating other guys and I don't think she is obsessed with having a boyfriend just because she has had a few.
aOBmcGAZaa	My wife, and the girls she hangs out with, prefer neither. They prefer boxer briefs.    I gotta admit once I tried them, I've never gone back.

RoicHy87aa	you can't let him take away your friendship with her. he should realize that if there was something between the two of you that she would be with you and not him... simple as that. if he can't accept that then it's his problem, definitely not yours.|`|ygimTNzoaa	That's her decision if she wants to hang out with you more or pick you over her current boyfriend. Not wrong of you. Might be wrong if you let her get to another base while she was still with him, before something like that happens she's got to break it off with her current man. I mean if you want it to last ya know.|`|EdidZdtlaa	as long as you dont go too far on the dates and stuff then it shouldnt be a problem.|`|ivlOxlG6aa	nah. You're just friends. It's ok.|`|eUiMXcFcaa	It's perfectly fine, as long as you continue to respect that she's dating someone else and don't try to make a move.  I'm a girl and all my best friends are guys - any boyfriend with a problem with that is out the door.  Frankly if he doesn't trust her not to cheat on him, that relationship probably won't last long.|`|d8b6703f3fe553c8173f1543b80dcc85aa	It's okay.  ido it all the time. lol  but if he does get really really jealous, then just get his story straight and tell him that it's not like that.  be the bigger man!|`|18ea4ff1fbd8faac2adc309bdd4c7b45aa	It's not wrong of you to ask - but it's also not wrong of her to want to spend time with BF.    Relationships change, dear one.     However, if this BF is jealous and gets mean and ugly about things, then she needs to break off with him and go with a more secure, together guy who really likes her - like you, perhaps?|`|ctMLdGg9aa	nooo you're friends.  keep doing what your doing.|`|bCzpxlUTaa	it's not wrong.... i think u shud wait till they break up then ask her out, whoa this is just like spiderman! uk how he likes MG and shes going out w/ someone else.|`|SvIBu4yRaa	it's okay to go out with her. plus they have only been dating for a month so it's not serious.|`|cb4HEkGhaa	I don't think its wrong or any think you guys are good friends and who knows maybe she likes you too and is going out with that guy to make you jealous so good luck with that and tell her how you feel after they break up of course|`|78aBwPooaa	Umm not really, you are just friends. I guess her boyfriend is being naturally paranoid.|`|lbfVjJZSaa	boy dont get stuck in that friend zone as soon as they break up try man seriously i hate that zone i need was to get out of it im 16 to and im always stuck in the friend zone|`|yC7jXmK1aa	Wait til this guy is old news and move in. Stay good friends with her and wait for them to break up. (I have a feeling you are like 15 and that's why I know they will break up) Keep your options open in the meantime though.
dalNxu8zaa	i think u should just give him space right now
JyWCPVfzaa	At his age his gonna act like that in front of his friends. Boys don't like to be teased by their friends, so they try to act tough. If you try not to like him, the more you are going to like him, so go with the flow...who knows what could happen...|`|EdidZdtlaa	dont try not to like him. if thats how you feel thats how you feel. but he does like you. but thats just a typical guy and how they always act with there friends.|`|UlrvomV5aa	go out w/ him... ur parents can't break off ur realtionship cuz their not u.|`|40xAVBblaa	I'd just give it time to see how things went|`|7Yzk6EbGaa	repeatedly smack urself in the head w/ a baseball bat|`|EyiCVm6Oaa	u should definitly ask him out!|`|E61btCG8aa	For now, try to be a 'best friend'. You can decide upon being his gf later on, since you guys have a loooong way ahead..
z5tCcEA3aa	how old are you ?  because he sounds pretty in mature. he shouldn't be calling or texting other girls. and maybe you shouldn't hook up with him.. but for future references, dont always wait for the guy to make the move. guys like it when a girl can take charge. its not like they will reject you so you wont be embarrassed or anything :P|`|ygimTNzoaa	You should cut off his nutts! That'll teach him. If not cut the nutts then tell him hes a loser and you're waisting your time then ignore him, trust me hell be super jealous. Being to attached is a huge turn off. Don't do anything sexually you are not ready for trust me you'll regret it.|`|yuwjQjKqaa	It sounds like you don't like you and that he may just want to have sex with you. I think he may have a gf and you don't know about it! Why do people date loons online?|`|DySN1Zdbaa	doesn't seem to me like he's treating you right.  since he's talking to other girls maybe he's just one of those boys who flirts with a ton of girls and doesn't really want a gf except for kissing and stuff like that...?
i6WVPncnaa	Try going out with him one more time, and see if the relationship will work on last time.  If it doesn't then let it go and move on.  If you feel that your not ready for a serious relationship, be friends with benefits.  Good luck.  Hope this helps.
AA11618874	He might be trying to meet up with you to tell you that he likes you and he wants to discuss the proper course of action. he's probably on yahoo answers asking a similar question like, "I like this girl and she likes me too but I have a gf and don't know what to do." ? Whatever happens if he cheats on his girl with you don't engage in a relationship with him as he would do the same to you.
oCG2JxsEaa	just be his friend. he might see how you are way cooler then your friend and start to like you. hope this helps!|`|tZF1FO7saa	do not do anything about it and see how it all turns out.|`|k2aXfOdYaa	don't do that because i did that, but ended up watching my "girl" friend fall for him and i ended up falling even harder, which made us stop being friends, because he cheated on her with me because i couldn't even control how i felt about him. don't do it, cause you'll just end up losing them both in the end. and they lose each other too.    be honest with him, and he can start thinking about you in that way and developing feelings for you, that's what happend with my current boyfriend and we've been together for seven happy months!|`|fEUFuEW2aa	You shouldnt interfere at all. I understand this is an awful situation and im rly sry to read about it, but fate will take its course, with or without ur help. Maybe he will end up liking u in the end, or maybe shell end of liking him, but its going to end up how it is. Just keep trying to be his friend, and maybe he'll notice ur genuine personality....|`|b82ybE3gaa	I think you should tell him how you feel, without telling him that your mutual friend doesn't like him like that. If you try to set him up with your friend feeling what you feel you will be so resentful that you didn't get to be with him. And if he tells you he is not into like that you should just move on, but thats easier said than done.|`|VO1zmW4daa	be his friend|`|nyXkOZddaa	well i would tell him the truth...there's no point in tryin to bribe  ur friend to like him just because you like him and you should tell him that you like him and tell him it's okay if he doens't like you back...no point...jus tell him whts the truth and he'll  be happy you did|`|sFmNvSJfaa	I agree with everything the people above me are saying, and wow I'm so sorry this is happening, the funny thing is the same exact thing is happening to me right now.  Does your friend know that you like him? If so, make sure that she doesn't flirt with him. That will only lead him on, dig her in a deeper hole, and hurt you.
KvphGLGVaa	aw that must mean he likes you!  boys tend to tell their coaches everything because they confide in them because they're always around them.    i think he laughed because he wanted to come off cool and not desprate or anything like that.|`|BK0yADLCaa	aww. well maybe your crush does like you! i know with my guy friends they do talk to their coaches in ways like that. so maybe you should juss talk to your crush more and maybe youll get a straight answer outta him.|`|9If6UnCZaa	he likes you?! confront him first because if hes like that was all a joke when your like yeah ill go out with yoou, than that would be totally embarrassing

igfQac8faa	go with her on the double date. you never want to be that girl that breaks up a relationship..especially since you don't like him ALL that much. it isn't worth it.  who knows, the double date could be even bettter !! :)|`|uff3kOoFaa	cancel with him and tell him you are busy tonight. go on the double date.  make him jealous! its fun! :)|`|8lLrykqJaa	yes you should ,make him jealous|`|gypWPBvLaa	double date that other guy is just trying to score i know guys like that they have gf's at a different school or city and he just wants to get some from you|`|ZlWhnobDaa	go on the double date. if he has a girl friend dont effect it|`|nhb4Rw5Eaa	No. It could blow up in your face.

You might want to talk to his ex and find out why they split If you are going to be the step Mom to her child I would think she would want to get to know some thing about you too.|`|01GbQLZwaa	your family always.

KNvNlr2maa	You must be new at this.  Communicate with him.  Practice.Learn to use his mind as a sexual organ.  Tease, in a sexual way.  Use your imagination.  Keep an open mind.  Be gentle with him.    If you both want it , good sex will happen.  If you get lost, buy a book!|`|iFJZ9fFVaa	Make him get in larger?

But most likely E.D.|`|wcIpYKWiaa	Practicing this sessions gradually improves the stamina of Persons and last long in future sexual interactions, but try to know the actual reason behind the problem.    One of the reason is "depression" which lacks interest in Sexual interactions.  If you find any physical problem. I will like to suggest you to prefer some natural remedies You can refer http://www.naguhelp.com/    I also Suggest this Exercise:-  All you have to do is exercise the muscle between your butt hole and scrotum. just flex it and hold it for about 10 seconds, release for a few seconds and repeat for about 10 repetitions. also sets of 20 quick flex and releases work as well. just try to work it into your free time and it should start to work in as little as a few days!|`|wyRJofXJaa	apparently he have a sexual weakness...let him see a doctor...|`|V5xHaIAcaa	This is what happens when you do not test drive the car...|`|e276df96c55a338c1e69a8869d0cd199aa	You need to discuss it with your husband not strangers on the internet.|`|44cd283169fb972cb9a8006a9ecce2d1aa	MEK,  There are a number of different medications that are out which assist with this problem.

Might just help for him to get his confidence up.  More of sex is the working up to it and pleasing each other.

EE07GFcdaa	Be your own person is what you do! no one in this world has the right to tell you who you can and cannot love! I am Mixed black, white, native american! my girlfriend is white and from England! we are both lucky enough to have open-minded loving families that don't care about race, but if anyone did disagree with us being together then that their problem not ours!     so ignore your mom and date whoever turns you on, its your life to live and enjoy no one elses! just make sure you date a man that loves, respects, and treats you well! skin color doesn't matter and eventualy one day your mom will come to fgure that out!
psLGl1yMaa	Playing hard to get is just a silly childish game. Don't play with him. Tell him how you feel. If he likes you to he will reciprocate if he is available. You don't have to sleep with him right away to let him know that you like him alot. Just tell him and then just go with the flow.    If you mean "hooked up with him" is meaning sex, then it sounds to me like he is playing with you and you need to move on right now. He isn't worth it. Trust me on this one.    Don't mean to sound harsh, but that is just how most guys are. There are good ones out there, you just need to be patient and wait for the right one to come along.|`|3y0w1qIBaa	Coming from a guy's perspective, I do not like when girls play hard to get because if they are, it tells me that this girl is not interested in me and I may have to move on.  Tell your feelings to the guy right now!|`|M3CsxF2jaa	tell him then!|`|GMA3pDCGaa	Show up necked and with food for the game at his house.|`|e276df96c55a338c1e69a8869d0cd199aa	It's only been "moths" by your spelling.  Committment takes time.  Slow down.  Enjoy what you have now.  Don't push, or he'll run away.|`|kG6VWsGvaa	You can't ever expect anyone to commit to you unless if you're already in an actual relationship with them. If you two aren't dating, there can't be commitment. Give it some more time. Just be happy that he likes you.     Plus, commitment isn't always a picnic. Some guys get restless after a while and want to move on to the next girl.|`|P9inKWOaaa	playing hard to get and he wants you more? that means your pushing and hes pulling. try pulling now.|`|pLZiKPFgaa	tell him and tell him you wont wait forever|`|vL3MR3DWaa	sometimes hard to get doesn't always work. be forward with this guy. girls do like being played neither do guys. si just talk to him and be your amazing self you know you are. that's all a good guy could want from a girl smart girl like you  good luck
oAPSJnSEaa	He may have erectile dysfunction and be embarrassed...or he may be gay and using her as a beard.|`|pz3LaTITaa	he is shy.. with that girls.. haha|`|bbe6d542c99c3729df16c734b566d4afaa	maybe watching porn would improve his sex drive.|`|M5XjqI40aa	She should ask him if he would eat her. Then after she orgasms pull him up and give him a deep wet kiss as he slides into her.
W2qyu5zFaa	Loved. I don't know how gifts could possibly make a woman want to stay with an abusive man.   Material things can't make you happy in a situation like that.|`|hTUkv6iRaa	Loved.  F*ck abusive relationships.
a7f44582f7bbfb8996d883accbaf5a63aa	1 - if you're sitting next to him, let your leg touch his. see how he responds.  2 - go into a photo booth with him and pose. get kind of close to him, and maybe he will respond in a good way.  3 - next time you hug him, stay a little longer and briskly rub his shoulder before your hand leaves him.  4 - smash his cheeks and tell him he's funny.|`|COmp4sIuaa	Hug, pat on the back, etc.    Honestly, you could do almost anything and he still not might notice you like him. A girl slept in a single bed with me and I still didn't know she liked me :S    I was young... lol|`|losGznxMaa	Smile around hm a lot so that you feel comfortable around each other and (this works best if you are in jr high) bump into him on purpose a few times. Sit next to him a lot and once you guys have a few inside jokes or know a few secrets about each other try giving him a hug.
Ki90Irkcaa	Yes, also he had adhd and that is hard to balance with school and other things he probably has going on. This is both your guys first real thing, so neither one of you know how its suppose to be. You think he's suppose to pay attention to you all the time, and he feels like sometimes he wants to and sometimes he's somewhere else, but that doesn't mean he doesn't like you. it just means you guys are young, and neither one of you know that actual dynamics of being in a relationship. I would just be cool, when he talks to you talk to him, when he ignores you, ignore him. ADHD is difficult in itself, Im sure he has a broken home, considering you said he is at his dads this weekend, so there are a lot of things embedded that you wont understand that contribute to his behavior. Just be there and be his friend, and everything will be cool. Go with the flow, until you two mature a little more.|`|BsfR6n6taa	you should ask i mean he is ur bf not nebody elses so how sould we know.. every boy acts different. besides you should be brave enough to ask him how he feels. If your not brave enough to do that what are you doing with a bf in the first place. Tell him how you feel. and if he breaks up with you so what find another boy its not that hard... if he's dumb enough to walk away be smart enough to let him go.|`|c4kcFlpQaa	your going through denial, denial is your first NO answer. step two of denial is PANICKING. -_- anyhow your already through that and third is....

Because you both aren't very experienced, he may not be used to showing affection very often. Or, he may not even realize that he's not showing affection, because he simply thinks you know he likes you. And if he didn't like you, he would have said so by now.|`|oAPSJnSEaa	Get used to it boys are confusing. He still likes you. When guys are going through things they tend do become distant..maybe he has a lot on his mind. The whole friend thing I felt uncomfy around my bf's friends at first but you just have to join in the convo let your presence be known!|`|EyiCVm6Oaa	I think he likes u and i think he's just shy about talking to u with ur friends.|`|9N6sW6KAaa	both since you are so paranoid he lost interest in you|`|e276df96c55a338c1e69a8869d0cd199aa	Yes, you're being paranoid.

4hJgn2e5aa	idk were not mind readers but you can tell by his actions if you like him and you sound like you do when he sits close to you, you move away from him a little and if he comes after you he likes you :) GL!|`|SRd1UmcDaa	That he hopes you aren't as shy as he is and you'll give him the signal to take the next step. He's up to bat... is he going to get to 1st base?|`|LQmaAffPaa	i think he likes ue.  jst sae hi.|`|RAgKQ2Zoaa	you should play it cool. Send hints or little signal to show you like him to.|`|TmDLyzAUaa	Alright here is what you do.  1. Casually bump into him instead and see if he says anything rude. If not than that's a good sign.  2. When he sits next to you. Scoot a few inches in the other direction and see if he does the same just so he can sit by you.  3. Ask him a question for a homework assignment. See if he likes to help you or if he sounds annoyed.  4. Ask him to go hang out with you and some friends. If he does that means that he wants to spend time with you.  5. Finally. ASK HIM OUT!!!!!!  See what he says. Because you never know what will happen if you don't try.|`|9N6sW6KAaa	that you love derek
ZAlongxMaa	You should find out what he likes and see if u guys hav anything in common.|`|A86F9EhOaa	Do you have any classes with him? All I can really tell you is, if you have a class or something with him, sit by him.. Start saying stuff like ohh geeze we have a lot of homework or this is boring.. or I don't get this, can you help me... Things like that and start getting to know him more by asking things about him.  It works really well. :)  If you don't have a class... try it at lunch or something.|`|JMhqODNuaa	just literaly say hi and if he says do i know u or anything like that, name some1 that u know that knows him. and if hes social hell replay back and say ohh yea; or bring up a time u saw him or u 2 almost talked or so, and from there on keep talking 2 him.|`|NRldAzrpaa	At first just ask like questions about school, about hwk or lyk whats hapening in yur city at the moment. Just ask him about what kinda music he likes and his hobbies and stuff. Get to know him properly.|`|gAkuYnPXaa	Act like u need to find directions and ask him If he know and if he does ask him if he can show you then just keep talking to him from there
l1wZEtOeaa	you could try just looking at him in a way that you feel is sexy and you can also try telling him that he looks sexy or that you want him...

1Z0Lmrk1aa	Wow, this is serious Samantha. For some reason some men get weird when there girl friends or wives get pregnant and they ignore sex. Sometimes its the female thats not into it to though. The fact that he's ignoring you altogether and would rather watch porn than please you is a sign on porn addiction. The fact that he hides where he's been may very well indicate he's viewing gay porn. I suggest you have a heart to heart with him and don't be satisfied until you get the answer you desire. If you don't get that, then I suggest you reconsider marrying him. Thingsl won't change just because of a piece of  paper.    p.s. Dont worry about the music, lol.|`|CeyuSMT9aa	he's not! don't worry|`|XOYAd1GBaa	why don't you just ask him straight up instead of finding ways around it?|`|aQTybiT4aa	Why would you want to marry a guy if you're not happy anyway? The whole music thing is just plain dumb! Just because a guy can be sensitive, it doesn't make queer. It's something more to this! You are apparently settling because you're pregger's and that's just down right dumb!|`|upk2Hzeeaa	I don't even know where to start.  First of all his girly music choices don't necessarily mean anything because I know guys who like that crap and they are extremely not gay (although they'll never land a woman, unfortunately).  Being very sensitive also does not mean he's gay.  Not wanting to have sex with you I could see may just mean that he wants to wait until marriage but the fact that he'd rather watch porn by himself is pretty messed up.  I guess the question is what kind of porn does he watch?  And is he the father of your child???    If you need to ask us these questions instead of asking him, it doesn't bode well for your future together anyway.    EDIT: I really think you should just straight up ask him why he prefers watching porn to being with you.  Maybe it's just because you're pregnant (and I can't say that that's wrong or not since I've never been in that situation; the girl I love, I think if she was pregnant and still wanted to have sex I would do it because I love her, but I would be concerned about being too rough).|`|nz8o3lLSaa	I have similar musical tastes.  Oh noez?!  Does that mean I am gay?    Seriously, if you ask him straight up and he responds with disgust, he is not.  If he responds with anger, he is.  You can tell by his facial expressions.|`|65879eecb0be58b339997b05c0d5c69faa	Sit down with him and ask him now, before you get too deeply into the relationship.      He may not like having sex with a pregnant woman; he might prefer the fantasies in his head; he may be a romantic; he may be bisexual or gay.    Someone I know is in a long marriage with a man who is gay.  They are happy.  Not everybody's cup of tea, but it works for some.  I asked her - why do you stay?  She said that she loves the person.  "The person is more than his equipment"
dGL5xCrqaa	It sounds like you don't know what you're looking for, and you're confused about what you're supposed to be looking for, so I suggest you take some time out to discover yourself and feel confident with yourself and your choices before you get any boyfriends.  But since it's the society we live in, I say only you can make the final decision. If you are seriously contemplating guy  1, then it means you're shallow. Physically he is attractive, therefore it's lust. He isn't dedicated to you, which tells me he will break up with you shortly or cheat on you.  Guy  1 sounds like he would only appease your ego and boost your self esteem because he is willing to sacrifice himself only to please you. You don't really respect him if he's so easy, just as a guy wouldn't respect an easy girl. He might be desperate, I can't tell from this little excerpt.     You need to take a lot more into account before making any sort of decision. Which one LIKES you back?|`|VDvdrCjmaa	God, I can't decide either, but honestly, I'd pick guy 2, he may be stuborn, but I'm sure you can convience him to show it[:|`|2JPRTMIJaa	Guy 2 likely would be more faithful. Good luck if u choose the stud.|`|fARwCvzLaa	Second one|`|Dd5YdYFFaa	Well no matter what anyone says, appearance always plays into most peoples decisions.   Guy 2 sounds great when it comes to personality, but if he is to stubborn to show it, then there cannot be a relationship between you two  Guy 1 may just need more time to spend with you in private, and maybe he will open up :)|`|3apyZmOBaa	2 - he'll admit it eventually|`|gZMNQF4oaa	2|`|8tRY1U2Iaa	The second one.    Looks aren't everything.|`|rAKGHpsPaa	whichever you like more|`|15b20bc2f63d778baab60d206ce6c1a4aa	guy  2.|`|xYisIAT5aa	both ;)|`|IgPFRVtDaa	the second one.  you should get a guy that would do anything for you.  looks arent everything.  what the guy wants to do for you  & keeps u happy  is what will count(:  even if the guy is the hottest guy in the world,  if he isnt dedicated to you  whats the point right ?|`|dp2oNqa0aa	guy  2 looks arent everything. and if he is really dedicated to you then go for it. it all depends on what kind of relationship you want like a seriouse one which would be guy  2 or a fooling around one one that doesnt really matter which would probabbly be guy  1 good luckk !!|`|TmDLyzAUaa	I would lean toward guy  1 b/c he seems more like the type that will sit down and do stuff without having to get up and make sure that the house is safe. J.K. But really i would go for guy  1 he just seems like the kind of guy that would be your type.|`|7sUkgaYSaa	Guy 2. Personality and dedication is everything. Why choose someone just for their looks? Not a good thing, you'll never have a good relationship with someone who just looks cute, but acts like a jerk.|`|L5aqTDiDaa	only you can answer which guy you want.|`|XAT5ZkNmaa	guy  1 will probably dump you as soon as a hotter girl comes along|`|u6EJnaVpaa	whose d*** is bigger?|`|Zwx1RYLoaa	1 just get to know him more nd they just ingnore on purpose so 1|`|LKjMAqXgaa	If you really need to pick, go for guy  2. You want to be with someone who will give you %110 and will do anything for you and if you think guy  2 will then go for him.    However, if you don't have to choose right away, give them each another week and hang out with them (at different times of course) or talk to them a lot just to get to know each of them better|`|70QRG1afaa	the second one. If you don't trust "the first" you'll eventually fall apart.|`|govN3EESaa	oh oh the first one sounds like a complete hotty                       wait sorry    i mean the 'sensible' thing to do is to got with the other one       sure.....|`|EaRjbFLjaa	i like guy two|`|lxrCrwLwaa	Date  1/marry  2.|`|Q89HRy3Yaa	second one  don't Judge a book by it's cover the first one may be cute be a complete jackass so go for the second one|`|Dhaxcs6gaa	sounds to me u like lucky guy number 2 more|`|S21rftTmaa	Depends on how old you are...if you're under 16, go with guy  1, cause he'd probably be a good time even if it wouldn't last forever...(Especially if he's cute! Dating is supposed to be fun at this age. Your friends would be so jealous! Hahaha.)    But if you're older or looking for a serious relationship, go with guy  2 or you'll get your heart broken.|`|UeiFNJVyaa	totally guy two. love is more than looks and lol if he isnt as "cut," that means that not so many girls will fall over him and he is all to yourself :)
acWyJ3t0aa	I'm sure that she giggled at the flattery and because she probably was having the same thoughts looking at you and she did  not know if you had caught her peeking at you or if you were checking her out and when she notice that you obviously had been , then she giggled|`|Am0xRpEjaa	id be very complimented thats very sweet|`|yJTaBGoEaa	I don't know.  This one is hard, because it sort of shows indecency. I probably wouldn't take that as a compliment, but I wouldn't think of it wrongly either. I'd just feel a little uncomfortable.|`|zs3AThq9aa	Girls giggle when they get embarrassed.|`|SHRKIJxkaa	i have no idea dude. but if that were me i'd feel complimented, embarrassed, odd and wowed at the same time. but i wouldn't call the giggle making fun of you.|`|KhVyci6kaa	that is the most wierd but sweetest thing i've ever heard.   if that happened to me i would feel complimented.
tjFcfI9Aaa	YES A BILLION TIMES YES|`|ibR6jJgHaa	............LMAO!!!!    well... i don't really think I would take it as a compliment but kinda...like..idk...but wow|`|v16ylsl8aa	I would be flattered and maybe turned on depending on how hawt the guy is. X-D|`|5NF4sAPaaa	yea..I guess it would be a compliment    but I also may think that all you would want from me is sex..so I would have to make sure that you are kind, and that your intentions are good, before I date you. Don't be embarrassed...it happens!|`|b7246aa9c54ecf3cf12beff32046d863aa	if i have crush on him , then yes|`|YeR6R8Feaa	i would be flattered!|`|fwiQuMYAaa	yah i would!|`|SvIBu4yRaa	lol i would like it.|`|C3tVKFWuaa	LOL! Yes, i would probaly Giggle too, ;)|`|psLGl1yMaa	It would be a little embarrassing, but it would be flattering though.|`|cKWX26hlaa	uummmm, well it is kinda flattering but it is embarrassing and kinda gross but yeah i guess you would put it under the compliment category.|`|1RApUQM9aa	well...she probably thought it was an awkward moment  so don't worry  just chill for a while and act like nothing happened|`|rQ5GI7d9aa	YES!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!|`|g90t7nC7aa	Haha! yeah that's cute she probably liked it!|`|JPOO3yylaa	lol she giggled, your fine! She wouldn't have giggled if she would've cared.      lol id def take it as a compliment, id love that! =]|`|fBXRNKyuaa	I would. But I would also wonder if you really liked me for me and not my body.
4cc625c81315e3cc57858f7de7250b2aaa	Yes, your parents will be mad about this.  You are 14 years old and you are talking about being with someone who is a legal adult.  Now you might have nothing in mind about being intimate with this guy when you meet him, but he might.  Does he know you are 14?  If not, you had better tell him NOW.  I know young teen girls really like the idea of dating the older boy, but most strict parents are not going to be OK with it.  What would they do if he actually called you at your home?  Please don't put yourself in a position where you are violating their trust.  Right now they seem really strict to you, but they do know better than you about what teen girls face.  They only want what's best for you.|`|AA10198825	He is only after one thing......|`|C3tVKFWuaa	I am 14, too. My friend lost her Virginity to a 18 year old, tricking her into a realtionship! Don't go there. Stay Away from that pervret!|`|FxfQjvx2aa	There is absolutely no reason at 14 year old should be planning to meet an 18 year old.  Talking, if it's not inappropriate, is ok - but meeting up??  No way.  Not acceptable.  Find someone your own age that your parents can meet face to face as well.|`|PpAb8fezaa	wow yur parents are STRICT!!|`|yJTaBGoEaa	If your parents are strict, they won't like this. Also since you don't see this guy face-to-face in real life all the time, they might assume he's a pervert online looking for young females to prey on. Your parents will also become more over protective about this, and yes I think they will get mad if you tell them. I suggest asking an older freind, or someone you're comfortable with about this issue. And since you're 15 you should be able to judge what kind of guy he is. If he pressures you, or behaves with your wrongly in any way, I suggest you stop talking to him. Otherwise I think it's pretty harmless to just be messaging each other on myspace. Good luck and be safe !|`|7DCM725taa	sounds like he just wants sex|`|oANWa3tYaa	my parents are the same i dont have a phone yet cause they dont want me talking to guys all the time. but i have been through that i met my myspace boy friend over the summer and told my parents and they said for all i knew he could be a predator plus im pretty sure they will pull the its illegal to date him card cause he is considered an adult and you a teenager..but thats my parents maybe you shouldnt tell them ti'll you see him a couple of times and see if u really wnt to tell ur parents about him!! :)|`|W8RqiKbVaa	i think if you "like like" him like that.... well u might want to find someone more your age.  he might like you like that but gee ur only 15 i no i sound like a parent and im not but thats just my opinion      hope i oculd help?|`|Q89HRy3Yaa	if i were a parent   hell no,sweetie your only 15  i dont care how nice he is the chance he wants to be just friends,or have a serious relationship are like 1 in 50   plus your in high school and he's the age to go into college|`|ZDz3ZpcWaa	no they are not|`|KhVyci6kaa	we have the same parents too. i don't have a phone either. the best way too deal with them that i've learned is that get on their good sides with stupid stuff like grades, behavior etc....  and i hate to break your dream but they will never understand your relationship with this guy it's reality sweetie. maybe if your brother and friend come along it's a chance but don't try to explain the relationship thing to them because it won't work trust me.   and about the whole phone thing...if you get any idea on how to convince to get on PLEASE let me know. thanks hope that helps.|`|EJzzTPixaa	nice to hear that     as for me if I where you . I would prefer to tell my mother the truth , maybe that would be better that dating and talking to the boy behind them. If they are strict as you say be care full..        Finally that's just my opinion ,and all the situation depends on you .|`|acWyJ3t0aa	No I would not be ok with it at all , and you should be very careful about what information you give him if you have nevermet him . There are many perverts out there that will track you down and are much older than 18 and they give yu this age to be in the same teen bracket you are .   don't ever give out that kind of information on the internet , it can be traced back to you.|`|e276df96c55a338c1e69a8869d0cd199aa	You're a child he's an adult.  This has "rape" written all over it.  Leave the guy alone and find someone your own age from school.|`|Am0xRpEjaa	your 15 you should be able to date my little sister who is about to be 14 just recently broke up with her bf of one year but their still friends|`|LboE9e4paa	oh wow your parents sound just like mine lol. they might get a little angry, kind of depends on the type of stuff u and this guy are talking about tho.|`|zKc66WSXaa	Yes your parents are strict, but they have good reason to be. No matter how much you like this guy, he is 18, and you are too young. I know this isn't what you want to hear, but trust me, it will be better in the long run not to get too involved with this guy
42QSXnNnaa	tell her how u feel, and see if she feels the same way.  do u both have cars and drive? if not its gonna be had to work on a relationship being 3 hrs way. long distance relationships didnt really work out for me but maybe it will fo u guys. u never kno until u give it a shot... good luck
37yBB96Iaa	id go with the space.... i know it will be hard but try 2 pretend u have lost a bit of interest.. distance yourself and he,ll come running.. if he doesn't then forget about him..the heart ache u feel now will be nothing in comparison 2 what it would b down the line... best of luck!!!!|`|NEH7JWNMaa	He's just making excuses. Move on.|`|McOF0DVnaa	hes seeing what he can get away with.  he has control.  he know you are not gonna leave him now|`|Hzz59VXDaa	I think the new of the relationship is just wearing off for him, and he's probably just not as "into" it as he was at first. This doesn't necessarily mean the relationship is not important to him though. And it's also possible that he's just busier than he was before.    Just try to communicate to him that spending time together is very important to you for you to feel loved, and that lately you haven't been seeing as much of him as you want to. whether he understands it or not. and hopefully if he loves you then he will do whatever needs to be done to make you feel loved.|`|M5XjqI40aa	Yes, being distant or withdrawn is a common male reaction to stress.

kG6VWsGvaa	Looks aren't everything. And if you ask me, the classy girl seems to be 154534456x more beautiful than your current faithless girlfriend. Beauty isn't just on the outside, sweetie. I think you should take that into consideration. What do you think is more important? A hot girlfriend, but has no self respect and cheats. OR a cute girlfriend who has self-respect (and respect for others), class and doesn't cheat. Do the math!    Besides, if your girlfriend has cheated on you once, what makes you think she won't do it again? It would have been different if you two broke up for a while and then got back together. But since I'm assuming you stayed with her all along, she doesn't need to fear of losing you if she were to do it again. She'll just assume she'll still have you.    My advice is to move on. Your girlfriend certainly already has if she messed with another guy while still being with you. Good luck.|`|95b3c1cab8a1f1f08d03b46eefc17755aa	The guy sending the messages is a troublemaker.    Always go for the girl with more self-respect.|`|i7rYRvlTaa	dump the b*tch|`|AA10684960	funny thing about cheaters,get awaywith it and it'll happen again
Un9CElCaaa	i gave my cheating ex another chance and she did it again. i still love her and i always will but once a cheater always a cheater. get out now!|`|mxrlZEweaa	No do not go back to the cheating girl. I would say maybe if she didn't cheat on you while she was drunk, but since she's done that then she can't be trusted. If this classy girl was really into you you guys wouldn't have lost contact for awhile. Find someone who is going to give you the time and love you need and deserve.|`|1xGgG2Rbaa	i cheated on my gf but she forgave me and i realized it was stupid. SO it just depends on her personality and how much u love her
AA11909552	Because they are scared sh!tless and *are* all talk & no action. They say these things because they are still very young and have NO experience in these matters. Also, they say these things so they 'look good". It is uP to YOU to break 'em down and have them sniveling like the punk wanna bee's they really are. It's guys like that, that make it harder for good guys like US.

I'm a virgin and my boyfriend was trying really hard to get me to hook up with him that night but I told him no. He got really mad and slapped me. Then I left the room went downstairs and told some of my friends what happened. After 30 minutes of crying I went upstairs to talk to him and found him and my best friend hooking up. I slammed the door, went home, got all of his stuff he had at my house and spread it all out on his front lawn and wrote we're done on his drive way =]|`|QI2OxkImaa	Paula Adule got a restraining order against me!|`|9ooXBxbJaa	i broke off an engagement while in another country and never saw the guy after that.  adding insult to his injury,  it was through texts.  it was pretty rough and i don't suggest it or am proud of it.
1EyRZm4Faa	Yes, SUPRISE!|`|yJTaBGoEaa	Yes I have.  But then again, it might have not been love.   Could have been that I just couldn't accept the fact that he wouldn't be part of my life anymore.|`|psLGl1yMaa	yes, a few times.|`|Kp6JYaMAaa	nope, hopefully i will though
2Sw7lVueaa	complement girls on personality instead of just looks because no girl likes to think a guy likes her for her looks only. and if you want to complemt their looks say beautiful or gorgeous instead of cute or hot|`|eac7Ixudaa	u take my breath away every time i c u    *when your talking to her on the fone*- wow, just hearing your voice makes me smile|`|G6letrTBaa	usually anything that isn't, "you're so hot"   telling a girl she's beautiful is the best one...it's not overrated|`|WPRAfLO7aa	Exactly that. Gorgeous and beautiful are what girls want to hear most. They don't want to have "Your so hot" they want something tru.
VWvcSOwGaa	most of the time you would just know he does, you pick up on it subconsciously. If he were a confident guy he would ask you out, if its a shy guy he would stare at you when he thinks you're not looking, when you talk to him he gets tongue-tied and you get the impression he isn't really listening to you, but if he thinks you're about to go he will ask you something totally random and unimportant like - how are you? (when he already asked you at the beginning) just to spend more time with you, he would lean towards you in conversation with a slightly quizzical expression with raised eyebrows (he finds you really interesting, even if you're not saying anything, if he seems bored when he looks at you then he isnt interested), he would change the tone of his voice to be more gentle and not scare you off, and if you look him in the eyes he will look back (but might look away quickly if he's shy) and you will see that his the pupils of his eyes are very big. (definite giveaway - it is totally subconscious so he is not in control - it means he likes what he sees) =)|`|Ho9k4QzAaa	boys are confusingg.|`|Ss4bkvDgaa	Flirting touching you're hair,  texting you everynight  basically.      (:|`|9N6sW6KAaa	The thing is you don't|`|Am0xRpEjaa	you dont|`|Hs19BCy9aa	It depends how well you know him and how he acts stuff like that.|`|783Ve5Pnaa	When I like a girl, I try to be around her as much as possible. I try to put myself in situations where I will be with her. If you find a guy that always seems to be around you, he probably likes you in some way|`|9QYAW437aa	it will become obvious when:    -he tries to impress you  -tries to make you laugh  -tells cheesy jokes  -touches you physically more than usual  -looks at you and smiles a lot  -teases you  -etc, etc    there are many ways to know if a guy likes you or not. it'll soon become obvious  good luck with whoever it is(:|`|F8sYQsB5aa	you really dont    i have this friend and i know who he likes and its impossible to tell unless he told u     on the other hand, i know who another friend likes and u can totally tell     it all depends|`|2mla6m51aa	I know everyone just says be yourself but that doesn't always work just treat him like a girl or how you would with your friends (but don't ask him to do your nails with him haha) just don't act girly!
9QYAW437aa	always try to flirt with him more  but not to a point where you seem like a   s l u t  cause that's not good.    when you see him,  intentionally try to flirt with other guys  another way is to ignore him for a few days  make him miss you.  don't become obsessive with him,  because that would be awkward for the guy.  start up casual conversations,  but like i said,  don't seem over-obsessive or pushy|`|WXwJnhybaa	first you really have to see if he like you back. but since he already knows that you like him and he is all cool with you then he probably does have some feelings for you or cares about you. what you can do is still play around with him but be serious when you have to and get answers out of him without him realizing it. also, be patient, because if he really does like you then he might make a move but it might take him a while. hope i helped. good luck =)|`|aryn8wQHaa	Hey sweetie,  I don't know why you want to make him jealous - that's definately not something a guy is into.   Anyway, it seems there may be a chance he's into you as well, but waiting for you to make the 1st move. You guys say that you talk dirty sometimes as a joke - that's cool. One thing you could do is when he says something don't answer or say something witty back. Call his bluff and tell him that you're waiting.   Another thing is to hang out outside of school. One thing I've done to get close to guys is to use sport (that's because I love sports). If you know theres a sport he's into, ask him to teach you. And seriously, this is a place where you could talk dirt if you want - but there is some physical contact, and you could throw in playfull kisses.  There are many more things, and I'm sure people will tell you.  Hope this helps,  xoxox|`|NZzq00p6aa	Ask a friend  that he doesnt  know a really hot one if you can to come hang out with you as a group thing go for drinkssomethingg have him flirt with you all night then give him some alone him with this guy and tell him to basically  ask questions about you like is she dating anyone stuff like that and your friend will report back to you . You should be able to tell at this point|`|Z0VvcKCraa	Trying to get him jealous would not be the best thing for attention, it could back fire and he just might think oh she isn't into me, because getting someone jealous usually involves throwing yourself at someone else.|`|goP5E0Kxaa	More than friends in this case, sounds like you need to make it more physical. Show your best qualities .    Smell, look, act, feel your best.    The first 2 are easy, but the second two I am having a hard time doing.     Anyways, smell, look, act, feel your best. Act confident, like you don't need him, and look great and feel great.

Yes, you ARE clean and free from AIDS.  You are ALSO free from gonorrea, sylhpilis, herpes, crabs, and HPV (the virus that causes cervical and penis cancer).    You are also free from pregnancy, and you won't become a father until you are ready. You are also free from having to find the money to buy an abortion for a baby you don't want.    You are also free from guilt, free from the guilt of thinking that maybe you did something wrong. Free from the guilt of thinking that what if she IS pregnant?  Free from the guilt of thinking that you have destroyed someone else's life just because you wanted to get your rocks off.  You are free from the guilt of having killed a baby because you wanted her to get an abortion instead of you becoming a father too early.    All in all, you have made a solid, responsible decision.  Yeah, its tought to watch all those movies and televisions hows that tell you that "it feels so good" -- but those shows never tells you how BAD it feels when things go wrong -- like unwanted prrgnancies, diseases, and abortions.    So just hang it there.

Being friends first helps out in relationships, just don't loose that part of it because that seems to be where a lot of marriages go wrong, they forget how to be friends and laugh together. My husband and I have been married 10 years, we were friends for 2 years before we ever went farther and it was the best decision of our lives, we have 3 munchkins together and still remain best friends.|`|Z0VvcKCraa	To be completely honest, I would like to have both.  I want to have a guy best friend that is my boyfriend.  I don't know how the relationship would be like if the boyfriend isn't your best friend.  The best thing to do when building a relationship is to become her best friend, be there for her, help her through her troubles and then be her boyfriend.|`|Jqsn8UTRaa	guy best friend. well if you like her dont become her bestfriend because then if you guys start to like eachother then break it off you guys wont be friends anymore and it'll be real akward. if you just care for her as a friend then just be here friend. otherwise give her a clue that you like her.|`|RNLGfM1Waa	Both :)...but preferbly a guy best friend...as they say boyfriends come and go buut friends are always there for youu..xx|`|ArfWE1Ykaa	you cant choose between a guy best friend and a boyfriend. but i'd rather have a boy best friend cause when your boyfriend leaves you, he'll still be there. but if you like her, you should try becoming more than friends or you'll just torture yourself.|`|UCKAiLN1aa	A guy best friend most definitely. With a best friend you can be so much more relaxed, no pressures of a relationship. You can share a lot more and you won't don't have the possibility of getting hurt like in a relationship. You usually are closer to a guy friend than with a bf. A guy friend you can confide in more and you feel secure. It's a lot more fun too because you don't worry have to worry about the protocols of a bf/gf relation :)|`|dwNW46wbaa	i would say best guy friend...thats less complicated and more fun|`|a5b833f1cecfc7eab7869f5ea4fe43f1aa	I'd rather have a boyfriend because I like sex. But having good male friends is also very important.|`|vxJxExCJaa	i would say guy friend|`|467145608db35ec4ccc89f1b16418af6aa	a boyfriend.  unless, she's not emotionally ready.    and just because.  you're able to connect on other levels with a boyfriend.|`|tPLoIMPCaa	depends on how you feel about the guy.  say i like someone. i would want them to be my boyfriend.  if they were just an awesome person and i like them as friend. i would want them to be my friend|`|w1kgu0hOaa	A guy best friend because if you fight you're more likely to talk to each other again.|`|wpR5AX5waa	It depends on the guy, honestly. But sometimes guy best friends make the best boyfriends, because the relationship is already established. In other words, you know that the two of you already have a connection. It's up to you to decide whether you think it's a romantic one or not.|`|kPwHlu45aa	It all depends on the guy and the girl, some girls like guy besties and then some would rather have a boyfriend. But if you really like her, ask he out or let her know you like her, or do something so she knows you care about her...but I would rather have a boyfriend, because a guy bestie would tell all ur secrets and crap to...but Good Luck!!!|`|SvIBu4yRaa	my best friend is a guy and i used to go out with a guy for like 2 years so from my experience i would much rather have a best guy friend. he's always there to cheer me up and hang out. i know that i can always count on him. plus its always fun to be best friends with a guy because we can do so many fun things|`|ua4mrpiQaa	I prefer having both.  It really depends on how she sees you.  Does she see you romantically and just waiting for the right moment or for you to make a move?  Or is she strictly sending a "friend" vibe?  I like hanging around my guy friends they are so much fun and I can contribute by giving them my girl point of view.  What's really great is having a guy you can hang out with, be friends, and still be able to have the romantic side to it.
zGi9Wag3aa	Walk up and say, I know Barack Obama on yahoo answers. she'll love it|`|DjvhGoufaa	dont even bother.. you need a girl thats exciting and fun.. she's going to make your life boring too|`|tPLoIMPCaa	get together. have sex. then talk about the sex.  lol|`|hSubLAVhaa	Ask her if she wants to go to the movies ask her interest stuff like that.Also try to make her feel special (girls love that).Make her feel that you only want her in your life.|`|B95XLZSWaa	Just because she may not live life in the fast lane, or even the far right lane doesn't mean she doesn't have some type of interests.  Ask her what kind of stuff interests her and go from there.
KNhiLxkEaa	yeahh ur soo cute i luv the way u r!! yehh but hes GORGY if i wa in amerca ill steal him! lol but im on the other side of the world so that wont be happening anytime soon but anyways  email me cos id lurrvvee 2 here from darlin!! amdswer my questions!! i owe u like 10 billion best answers  !! xx
4EN1srnVaa	Make sure he knows you like him. The only thing that ever keeps a guy from asking a girl out is because hes afraid to be rejected. So if he knows hes not gonna get rejected hell ask. I guarntee it.
IO0xRkAgaa	ok here is what i think. 1. she was totally in to you. 2. she needs to work on her flirting techniques.3. if it was someone you kind of know or are going to see her a lot get to know her or get her number. if u aren't going to see her a lot and u do see her again starting at u wave and say hi. Really unless you guys start talking or something she is just another hot girl.   If u are going to see her again though i would so go up and say hi. girls like guys to take the first step.|`|Dd5YdYFFaa	You should probably look back at her, and try smile and look confident. It seemed quite obvious that she was probably interested, so just approach her next time if it continues.|`|CeyuSMT9aa	well you guys are like 11 and 12 i would not worry about it|`|Am0xRpEjaa	wow your in 6th grade?|`|mxrlZEweaa	Just go up to and say "hi". Don't be to nervous.|`|qiLJlMWUaa	forget it that was just a 5 minutes fling, its over and done move on|`|BkucBPwjaa	may b she likd u if that were to happen again go talk to her and b confident and smile|`|1xGgG2Rbaa	if ur not to embarresed u make the first move and go talk to her. but ur in 6th grade. u got plenty of time to get a hot girlfreind|`|FxfQjvx2aa	Smile and talk to her - be nice and respectful.  She probably thinks you're cute.|`|0kWfGqQSaa	It could either be a good thing or a bad thing. Just go talk to her, walk by her and say cool phone or something. TALK to her, and see if she seems interested.|`|DPZF7sAraa	Talk to her if you see her again or if it happens again, but make sure that she is looking at you and not someone else. If she was looking at you then yes she likes you especially if she is asking her bestie for approval|`|SHRKIJxkaa	umm i have no idea bout grades and such but she probably thought you were cute. if i was her i would definately point you out to my friends. :)|`|cG1HwI4Faa	Ok, I'm turning 16 this year, but here is what I would do.  Hopefully this would help because I know that a 16 year old is definitely different than an....11 year old.  Maybe.....oh I donno....just maybe you should just go......TALK TO HER!!!!!!!!
zOm47611aa	this is long...sory  yes its bc he cares. i like a guy at my shool and everyone we know says we both like eachother andi told him i like him, but ritte now i like the whole friends thing. nyway i started dating our school sir dates alot, like he has gone through almost everygirl in the school and he told me it was a bad idea and i didnt listen, so everywhere me and sir dates alot would go i saw ronan(the guy i like) and then i found out that all sir dates alot wanted was sex(obviously) and then when he started getting violent i broke up with him, and then he kept bothering me and touching me and stuff so ronan kicked the kids @$$ and put him in the hospital, for me. Thats when a guy likes you ALOT!!!|`|eqt5jvdWaa	hes assertive :D|`|NgcGF3aZaa	well 1. i hope your not pregnant.   2. i think its possible =]    gOoD lUcK|`|4w7lsoj7aa	He will most likely be really shy around you, because he feels that as soon as he opens his mouth something will slip out that wasn't supposed to.|`|7XzzmwYaaa	You're reading a bit too much into it, I think. If you think a guy has the hots for you, ask him if he does. He'll answer yes or no.    As an aside, I'm going to say this as clearly as I possibly can: Never, EVER, EVER joke about being pregnant.
cB2czSD0aa	you should talk to someone
85tAhnM9aa	Don't do nonsense like dropping very subtle hints because we don't see them!! Be very upfront about it, make it very clear that you like him by either telling him yourself or having someone else tell him.|`|gZWMvIX0aa	just say i like you that the big hint dont ask him if he likes you just say you like him he soon get there|`|aUDVBmZSaa	Hint to him like saying Oh there is this movie that I heard was really good and haven't seen it yet, then give him a little flirty look and he'll get it I'm sure.|`|KcloaW4vaa	you cant really. Its all about whether he can do it or not. Unless you want to go ahead and ask, he may take forver or do it really soon. You can never knwo when hes ready or able to ask, it jsut happens.

yq9lgYGDaa	pretty much anything  making out, getting teased, feeling up our inner thighs, strip tease, lap dance, hot girls, a nice butt, reaching under our shirt and feeling us up, playful spank, sitting on our laps and moving around a little, looking at us in that certain way that says you want something, having your hand "accidentally" graze our pants...stuff like that|`|ENGwbEycaa	u do baby|`|rrHAAT9faa	teasing|`|VSpqYAabaa	Learning something new.

9c2inRKaaa	I'm 15...never had a girlfriend.    You sound so sweet.    Be my girlfriend will ya?    hehe...jk|`|xkMadpW5aa	no it's not weird.  some people don't date until college, or maybe even after in some cases. if you want to focus on your schoolwork, that's a good thing, don't rush yourself.  you'll most likely find someone when you're not looking.|`|RNLGfM1Waa	No i had my 1st boyfriend wen i was 17....im 18 now :)...so quite normal..not to worry you will find sum1 wen the time is right...|`|hvFN0JLVaa	No your fine.  Im like you but a guy.  Im a good looking guy and didnt have a gf until i was 17.  just because I didnt want to get invoved with anyone.  its fine.  your not wierd.  just some people dont get that urge to be exculsive with someone.|`|pW9KhTFvaa	no, not weird.  When you are ready to take that step, there will be plenty of opportunities available.  Only you can really know when is the right time for yourself.  In the meantime, continue developing relationships with the people around you and it's possible that one of those could bloom into something romantic eventually.|`|ouEdGHfuaa	I'm 22 and never had a real boyfriend before. I think, though, that I just don't care. I'm also pretty shy and have plenty of ignorance according to my sister because she always nudges me hard if some guy was checking me out. I just don't think that much about it. Don't worry, someone will come for you. You're still so young!|`|S1J0u3zoaa	nope, I'm 16,  and I hate to say this but I do hang out with what you would call the 'popular' crowd, I have a social life, tons of friends, a lot of guys have called me hot and asked if I will do things with them, and I never have, but only 2 have ever asked for me to be their girlfriend, and I have never had a boyfriend  so don't worry about it, its totally normal (:|`|LfBptxrcaa	Aww God You Sound Exactley Like Me But You Sound Pretty Clever!.. Im 14 Tho:). My Parents Dont Let Me Date Either But Ive Decided Just Not To Let Them No, Cause Im Muslim But I Havent Really Had A Relationship, Im Pretty Shy Too But I Thiink You Should Start Talking A Little More Cause Im Sure If You Did All The Guys Would Be After You, They Just Need To Know Your Personality...:)|`|hVzT1RlEaa	not weird at all|`|kG6VWsGvaa	No, it's not weird. One of my best friends has never had a boyfriend and we're 16.    I'm currently in a long-term relationship with my boyfriend since age 13, and while it can be the best feeling in the world to have someone like him, it can also be heartbreak and tears. I'm head over heels in love with him, so if anything ever goes wrong, I'm totally devastated. And when that happens, sometimes I wish I never stayed with him for this long. I can't imagine how I'll be if/when we ever break up. Consider yourself lucky in that department.|`|stqRSCfwaa	doesnt matter how old u r, i tell u wat alot of young lads r really immature and will always try to distract u from school, ther lil juveniles, so only date a lad u actually think u want 2 date :)|`|196b73911133c4d75053bfa6ae887857aa	It's not weird at all, in fact it's normal and probably better for you. My sister is 15, has a boyfriend, and I can't stand her...damn mushy teens with bad grades.....don't be in a hurry to grow up|`|55dcf367a7994396fcfc052a450c6c36aa	I don't think it's strange to have never had a boyfriend. I didn't have my first kiss til recently, and I'm 15. Don't think you're missing out on a lot, because you really aren't, there's so many other things to worry about. And you'll know when that special guy comes along.    I hope that helps. :)|`|mzkfSwLwaa	Not weird at all...take your time you dont want to end up like most of these girls now days pregnant and looking for your baby father..Take your time.|`|Sm9cq8KKaa	No, it's not the least bit weird, though it can sure feel like it at times. Why waste your first boyfriend on some meaningless teenage jerk? Make your first experience memorable in a good way, not in a bad one. Don't date anyone for the sake of being seen with him - date someone you truly love and respect and someone who loves and respects you back.   I am in your position, so I know what it's like. I am 14 and refuse to date anyone until I am 18. My philosophy is this: dating is for adults, though society and the media have done quite a job glamorizing children dating. Enjoy your life as a kid, for it only lasts for 18 short years. There is no rush to grow up. Have fun while you are still a child! Originally, my parents were going to let me start dating at 16, but that's now only a year and a half away and boys are not my priority now and sure will not be then. I set 18 for myself, and my parents respect my decision and find it wise that I am choosing to do this.   I think it's great that you focus on things other than boys (schoolwork, for example). Boys at this age, because they are so immature, generally don't care for girls like this, though. Like my mom always says, it's those with no focus/goals/external activities in life that date at this age anyway.   And those relationships are all so fake, anyway. Personally, Id rather have a genuine relationship.  Sure, I question my normality, but at the end of the day, I like who I am and know that any relationship would harm my life a great deal more than it would help it.|`|X7hm4fJXaa	not really, because everybody gets a boyfriend at a different time, like my first boyfriend i got when i was 14, and my friend just got a boyfriend and shes 16, shes really pretty too.|`|yLUqNgqsaa	not at all|`|22HpFLCmaa	No. Don't look for one. Just wait and the right guy will come along. : )|`|4DVy8sP1aa	it is very weird    LOL|`|vDMASHmLaa	YES ITS WEIRD. no jk its fine =)|`|Dn8i9sIlaa	Not at all weird! You'll know when you're ready :)|`|pQ1Oiswnaa	not at all    i know people who are like 16 and have never had a bf so dont worry|`|a3d582acb2b30b257fb8d82c57713a25aa	No, that not weird.|`|d5kt46e5aa	No, you're not. dating isn't all its cut out to be. boys in high school aren't sweet or nice and all they are looking for is sex. it will only cause drama in your life. theres nothing wrong with innocent flirting though. :] and i'm 15 too and i've only had 2 boyfriends and i've also been told that i am very pretty.|`|8XHFjZLwaa	nope don't rush it..|`|nD9Dmwqbaa	Im in the exact same situation... I've learned all you need is some good friends and a guys will come along eventually.|`|B1CH2L26aa	no its not weird  i didn't have a boyfriend till i was 15, or even have my first kiss till then    be patient, it'll happen, i have friends who are 16, 17 this year and never had boyfriends and they are pretty too|`|XAT5ZkNmaa	no! dont rush in to it|`|FiqKbUgeaa	No it is not..... You can take your time with that... you have the world ahead of you.. take time for school and friends.. there is plenty of time for boyfriends...|`|FsUkoRSvaa	I agree with Emma K|`|AAQrhKg6aa	im the same way i didnt have my real boyfriend till i was 17 its ok your still young you dont need a boyfriend right now have fun being you and dont worry about the guys eventually they will come to you|`|gypWPBvLaa	its not weird at all its very normal actually a lot of girls i know that are 14 15 and 16 have never had a bf so no not weird at all|`|vxJxExCJaa	girll you are not weird if you havents dated anyone yet. the right guy will come in time. dont worry keep the good grades up!!!!|`|wmfJJLiDaa	no, just don't waste your time. guys are jerks and you're supposed to be enjoying your high school years. you don't want to go through the pain that guys bring.|`|VZRIlRODaa	It is not the least bit strange. Girls having committed relationships at only fifteen, thats strange to me.|`|hnQdOJDqaa	I think it's maybe that you too focus on your schoolwork and that afraid to talk to people because you think that you will lack in your school work.Also,that your just not ready.But,if your parents won't let you date focus on your school work for right now.Just try not to be so shy.*|`|bHLCjPIHaa	hey if you're beautiful a guy will come! it's never too late and it's never too early! don't worry about it at all! there's probably a guy as cute as you are in that library too and he's most likely waiting for you! just give it time, he'll come!  LOVE YA!|`|e8ocUrV5aa	Actually, its quite common. I mean like, just because you have never had a boyfriend doesn't make you indifferent than anybody else. There is absolutely nothing to be ashamed of just because you have not yet found your true love :) Just keep looking and try not to be shy. It's ok...I was a little bit shy myself but i changed that for the better. Good luck to you!!|`|yC7jXmK1aa	You're just like how I used to be! I didn't get my first boyfriend til about 2 months before my 16th birthday. Even though I was told all the time that I was beautiful and amazing and all. You would be surprised how your parents would react. I remember having to ask my dad if he could take me on my first date.. oh gosh.. I was like so this guy asked me to the movies.. can i go? can you drive me? haha. Don't go on a date unless one of you can drive. It's better that way. Trust me. It was so awkward standing there with the guy waiting for my dad to pick me up. Haha. Take it easy and enjoy the time you have with your friends. AND WHEN YOU DO GET A BOYFRIEND, DO NOT FORGET TO MAKE TIME FOR YOUR FRIENDS. I made that mistake. And now I'm paying for it because I want to go out with my friends and my bf doesn't like it. It's actually driving us apart. So hang in there. Someone is bound to come around and ask you out in a sincere, nice way.|`|7VnmPYuXaa	You are not missing out on much.  Just keep spending time at the library and studying. You will be a very successful woman when you are older.  The guys will come if you want that, but remember, it's better to wait years to find the right guy then spend a bunch of years with wrong guys.      More teenagers should be like you.  Good Luck.|`|Omu7AbmQaa	I can completely relate to you. I am also very shy and choose to concentrate on schoolwork rather than dating. And that is ok. Really. In the long run, you will be so grateful. The relationships you have at that young of an age never work out and are rarely serious, so there's nothing wrong with waiting til you are older and those boys become more mature.  I'm 18 and I've had 2 boyfriends in the last two years and although sometimes I feel kind of wierd, I don't think there is anything wrong with it. Now that I'm in college, I will have the opportunity to meet boys who want something real.|`|HSsBhRRyaa	Do yourself a favor, don't worry about boys. You have a lot going for you that girls at your age who do have boyfriends don't. Your obviously smart, beautiful, and guys justimpeded that. It's a hassle you don't want or need. I know it's hard at 15 with all the hormones and your friends dating and all but worry about you. Guys are nothing but trouble. Your not wierd. YOUR SMART. =)|`|JXLP9juzaa	It sounds like you are doing everything you can for school and pleasing your parents, but nothing really for you. People approach others and get to know each other in environments that are casual, unlike the library. I am in college and spend most of my time in the library, but i still make time to go and hang out with friends, or new people i meet in school.     To sum it up, i think that if you just relax and be yourself, people will see you are open to meeting new people, and will maybe approach you more often. Maybe not be so quick to say no to people that talk to you or ask you out.     I hope this helps.|`|DzceZ8bEaa	no not at all!!! :) dont worry about it  i live in a town with a lot of..well, sluts (haha) and a lot of people dont get serious relationships till they are seniors or even older! its totally normal :)    and just be outgoing, i know its really scary, i havent kissed a boy and im 15 too! and i live in a town where people have sex as 13 year olds haha. i am really shy too and it wasnt till this year that i really started to talk to people ad become more social, you would think people just think your weird but i promise, when they see that your ok with putting yourself out there, they will respond and you will meat a lot more people :)    good luck! hope i helped!  remember: your not the only one! :)|`|g4ufgo2Kaa	You may feel so strange and like you're missing out on so much because at that age most teens start to date. You shouldn't be worry because you're going to meet someone who likes your personality and if you do you shouldn't let your parents interfere.|`|0CNmnw1Vaa	no, i got my first boyfriend when i was 16, we're going on 9 months :)  my sister, 18 in march, to this day has never had a bf  my oldest sister didnt meet her husband\have a bf til she was 19, they're goin on 10 yrs :)    you are not along, do not feel left out.  its normal.    plus i think its good bc you'll be seen as the girl that doesnt just go for anybody.    you have standards dammit! &never lower em :)    goodluck, you.ll meet him|`|pz3LaTITaa	do you want to be my girlfriend.. just joking. you need to spend more time for social.. can i see your picture. please|`|AhO0Uoppaa	8 words  "i spend all my time in the library" might be a clue|`|4Vmlf902aa	That's not weird. I've met girls who have never dated before. Even one of my guy friends just got his first gf this year, well last week. But hey,once you start dating i'm sure you'll find someone fast.|`|jdVxsK4yaa	absolutely not|`|OsHjXzxUaa	not at all, i didnt have my first boyfriend till i was 17 :) ur fine, everyone has their own time when their ready|`|qMXk1GRgaa	lol its not weird or anything, im in the same situation as you are, just like me, i tend to do my school work before anything else and my parents are really strict as well, so its not weird or anything :D|`|7cei5ifNaa	no|`|hJHl4HmSaa	Honestly, just a little.  You can't start dating when you're ready to get married.  Now is the practice age.|`|0cCZkuBOaa	Its normal. I'm 15 and I don't have a girlfriend^^ There is no such thing as it being normal or abnormal to have a "spouse" at any age. It all depends when your perfect match comes^^|`|WItdtl0Vaa	Nah, it's normal. Your really young. Just do what your comfortable with.|`|Tq98g20raa	not weird at all some guys dont have a relationship until 18 or 19 ask a guy out or tell them you like them if you really want one and uf your that hot and nice im sure  they wont mind... email me if you want any help or tips or whatever... i will add you...|`|X0vhUEtoaa	This is NORMAL. If you don't have a boyfriend now, you will get one SOON. You were smart to say no to that one guy in Biology class, since you hardly knew him. And if your parents won't let you date, then why bother trying to get a guy? Slow down and let your life go on. Believe me, you'll find Mr. Right one day.|`|BOQxPnjCaa	no its not weird but if you realy want to have a bf  you needa break outa the shell. i believe the fact   your prety but its not attractive when girls sit around  looking sad && lonley [[wich shy girls tend to look  like when the keep there head down && they dont  realise there frowning]] so guys dont bother to say  hi much or even make fun of you. so you shouls   start hanging out more, talk to people more && they   will believe that your worth it && you wont sit around  not doing anything. your not strange, its normal but  your missing out on fun, not fun were you make out  && all but fun on sharing memories with a person  you care for, wether its a friends, family, bf|gf. hopefully  youl start acting a bit more open && i promise you   youll get asked out after people see that you do   hang out with friends && smile && talk :D|`|29maScwJaa	No, that's good work, keep it up. You aren't missing out on much, Relationships at your age are a huge waste of time. It's true, people at that age can't even experience what love is in the first place, that kind of love I mean. I know Ill get thumbs down for saying it but it's true! I didnt have my first girlfriend until I was 17, so I kept my school grades up too. Trust me you won't regret it. Relationships during high school are a waste of time and take up so much time and effort that school work suddenly becomes second priority...hold off, you wont regret it.

The Hillbilly gazette or the Trailer Trash Tribune?    The best way to treat ED is to date a chick 20 years younger than you.  Sometimes ED isnt caused by the male getting old as much as it is by his chicks getting old.      men and boys with ED should work out and take cialis and eat right.     I feel bad for poor guys who cant afford viagra and cialis and have to resort to....... binge drinking to get a hard on. LOL!!|`|167529fb60fd91f624600021b83b22c7aa	You mean, you'll marry a "drunk" for good sex, and an occasional beating!

oK9WhUkiaa	u were deceived, it's in no way ur fault. the exact same thing happened to me with a guy i was dating for six months, he played it all so well and i found out in the end that he had a girlfriend who was pregnant with his baby ! i had a feeling of shame too but u didnt know anything about it so theres nothing to feel bad about hun. get rid of the guy, he's a cheat and a liar. theres no way u can ever trust someone like that. u seem a nice girl so plz get rid of him and find a trustworthy guy that u deserve. =] x|`|tsoc9tihaa	get over it.  its his fault not yours|`|e276df96c55a338c1e69a8869d0cd199aa	Break up with him and find someone else.  That's what you should do.|`|E6CShQfKaa	WOW, that stinks! You are NOT a cheat! You had no idea what was happening. I am so proud that you told the girlfriend. I would ditch the guy and forget the whole situation. Good luck!|`|sI7gq3B1aa	kick him where it hurts for your sake and hers infact no dont just speak to her i no shell be annoyed but there would be nothing worse for him than you and her being good friends he will s*** himself lol|`|ggBfHk1waa	You're not the cheater, he is.  You've done all you should do.  Forget about him, especially if he "breaks up with his gf."  There are a zillion nice guys out there.  Move on.  Best of luck!|`|maVptaMZaa	You have nothing to feel guilty about.  You found out that he had a girlfriend and immediately dumped him.  You did the right thing and avoided possible heartache at a later date.     Forget him - You did the right thing.|`|o0hUphynaa	Okay, YOU are not a cheater. He is the cheater! You didnt know and its not your fault that he didnt tell you. Obviously he is a player so get as far away from him as possible.|`|OQsj0Am3aa	He didn't make you a cheat.    He made himself a cheat.    You didn't cheat on anyone & you did the right thing telling his other bird.

Oh, yeah - before I forget: there's lots of men who think they are doing nothing wrong by keeping 2 or more girls on a string.|`|HSsBhRRyaa	you and his GF should take turns kicking him in the shin.|`|cG1HwI4Faa	Be very careful with guys at the age of 15-18.  I'm 15 and I go to class with all these losers, they talk about how many girls they've gotten with and what not.  They think they're pimps, that's probably what that a**hole did to you.|`|EKWMoyVNaa	YOu should not feel terible he should end up losing you both i think you should confront him and tell him hes a playa and Dh|`|ptgng2RFaa	add me on bebo,|`|3f472ffb578b5c756958c260f98d3282aa	Oh that sounds loads like what happened to me a few years ago when i was in school. It was with me ex boy friend. We got kinda close about a year after we first broke up and even though really we just kissed he was going out with on of my close friends at the time.     I felt so bad and some how i got all of the blame on me when i didn't even know they were going out. it really hurt me to think how he could use me in that way to hurt some one i really cared about.     It really was a tough thing to get over, but really you can't blame your self you didn't know. He is the one that is in the wrong, not you not his girl friend, JUST HIM.     So please don't blame your self, not all guys are like him, and soon you will find some one who will respect you and really love you.|`|bNcL4RfZaa	Nothing, it was all his fault.  As long as she knows that then there is no problem.|`|91916cdfcacbfc10a3cb8d35b35bb07daa	Dump him, if he is cheating on the girlfriend he has then he will most likely do the same to you.  Guys like that are a waste of time.    Find someone who's all yours and you don't have to share him with anyone else.|`|DcVoq5Tuaa	lose the guy and move on.|`|onAEy5jTaa	Hold up! You should be saying "I feel terrible because he's cheating on me with another girl!", not the other way 'round! Don't blame yourself! You should feel hurt 'cause he cheated on you too! After all, you guys are going out! If I were you, I would make things straight with his other girlfriend. Then I would dump him! I know people always say a guy can never stay faithful to only one girl, but I contradict the idea. Hope I helped.|`|JpmKtpqmaa	leave him alone. Dont feel horrible because you didnt know so it is not your fault...Dnt talk to him because guys like that cant be trusted!!!
MPpO4xQMaa	yea I know it's hard and sometimes you just give up, I think you need to tell the online guy about your Intention of dating another guy and if he is a good guy he would stop or at least just reduce that   you also must have some self control, I know it's hard specially if the online guy is sweet and saying the right things but if you want things to work out with the other guy you need to stop , but if you really like the online guy maybe you should start thinking of a relashinship with him and tell him how you feel
HfamMJIqaa	see what he says! and if you dont like that tell him the truth
onAEy5jTaa	I think there is definitely something more. A guy I liked told me that once, and a few days later, he asked me out!!! So it's not just niceness, but also likeness, lol. Hope I helped.|`|yuwjQjKqaa	It a way he was telling you how much he loves you!|`|EyiCVm6Oaa	idk? i think there is something more|`|VEEgoDkFaa	There could have been something more, but it sure sounds nice.  He was truly thinking about you. He obviously cares. Trust.

KBUPMW2Yaa	You could do those would you rather things.....it's a fun way to start a conversation!

eTsCJYALaa	As a parent I think we all picture our children as innocent and sweet and we want what we think is best for them. There are so many things that flash through a parents mind when they think of their child having sex at a young age (AIDS, STD's, unplanned pregnancy).I would guess that your mom's reaction was purely because she was shocked and maybe hurt that you did not tell her. Hopefully she will think more about it and be glad that you are protecting yourself. I do hope that you change your habits to ALWAYS wearing a condom.|`|bdc0c1d1aead267282553512169a9932aa	You live at home ??? what are your home rules ??? if you live with your parents, then you are subject to their rules, don't like them, move out.|`|nQkH90n6aa	considering some girls are getting pregnant at age 12 I would be proud of you if you were my son. Sure, I wouldn't be thrilled that you were having sex, but I'd be very glad that you were doing it safely. Ask your mother "Would you rather me have condoms or a kid and diseases?". She might just be a bit shocked and should come around. You're becoming an adult now and she needs to realise this.|`|AA11085356	Try to keep in mind that you are still your mothers child. You are still a child in her eyes. You're growing up, and moving on to the next phase of your life. Maybe she's just not ready. Give her some time to cope, then let her kno you are being safe.

If you are freinds with her try asking her bluntly if everything is alright between them. It could well be that theres a different side to this boyfreind that she knows but you dont. Dont make the boyfreind jealous though whatever you do. That will just put the girl off. Perhaps if you really love her tell her how you feel. Tell her that he doesnt deserve her and you would be a lot better for her. P.S make sure he's not the jealous/ violent type though!|`|n6ZXG9H0aa	When girls get emotionally attached to a guy, it can be hard to break that attachment. She has to get over him in he own time.

AgoLB3T6aa	Sounds like the relationship has run its course. I would say your best bet is to accept that the pair of you have changed and it's time to move on.  Tell him so, wish him well and say you'd like to remain friends (if you would).  You're obviously both young, relationships do change rapidly when you're still at school, it's all part of growing up.|`|IxGa7mnGaa	I think you guys might have drifted apart, so you should tell him all the stuff you said here|`|tE2ZHOd6aa	give him a big slap, then he will pay atention to you. not the kinda atention your after but you will definatly get some atention|`|v0kb4hgBaa	Ive told all of my bf that if they want to break up with me then they need to do it.

If he does want to dump you then you can move on and not be so sad|`|nz8o3lLSaa	Cheat on him.  That is what most neglected girlfriends do and it seems to work for them.

But if you saw him I would say happy birthday. but I wouldn't go out of my way for it.|`|SvIBu4yRaa	you should to show respect|`|Dhaxcs6gaa	yuppp..my ex called me...were best friends....be the bigger person!|`|V9QCrh5Vaa	yeah just call him i would call him and not only say happy birthday but talk to him and say like just because we broke dont mean we cant be friends no more and be like we r still friends rite  cuz even though u break wit sumone dont mean u still cant be friends with them cuz iam friends with all of my ex's well the ones i still see  well hope i helped good luck  ps JUST CALL HIM   DNT BE SCRD|`|1pGscoqRaa	sure. why not|`|yxc2iztkaa	Depends on how the relationship was before the break up.  If you were really close before, then sure.  If not, then either next time you see him or text him or something.|`|5FVyVS9vaa	I would do nothing. He is your ex for a reason.|`|7THgBSvfaa	Eh.. I would just send him a text.. If he doesn't have a cell phone.. Just tell him the next time you see him, even if it is a little late..|`|gZMNQF4oaa	yes.  i went to my ex's dad's funeral.  so calling on a birthday is nothing|`|srtlm9Ptaa	Yeah, you should! It would show that you want to talk more, and you're being nice. If he doesn't answer, then text it to him (:|`|96zZlJVYaa	thats really up to you...|`|DeObHL9Oaa	Call him, he will love your respect for him.|`|F8sYQsB5aa	maybe a text would do|`|vw4KXRlLaa	If you broke up with him, and it was a bad break up, then no, don't.  He won't appreciate, and it will more than likely put him in a bad mood on his birthday.  I know that sounds harsh but it's true.    If he broke up with you, or the breakup was amicable, then sure, why not.|`|8tRY1U2Iaa	If the breakup wasn't nasty, then it couldn't hurt.    If it was, then just move on.
0P5qBxiZaa	i would like to be man handled.  but he has to be super sweet to|`|W2qyu5zFaa	Why has being nice become creepy? Assertive guys are usually jerks and wouldn't put women on as high of a pedestal as a nice guy would.
B2WyO7gjaa	may be you shouldn't be asking have sex!!! no offence but asking qeustions like that shows your not ready and don't know what your getting into|`|v398Qalyaa	not quite sure what you mean, you sound very young. use protection, and make sure you are aroused, as your vagina needs to be moist or it will hurt, so do lots of foreplay first|`|4uB0bbhnaa	having it clean would help....|`|JUEkTETAaa	wtf????? you vagina does have to be in any certain position...lol|`|DIEih5asaa	Just leave it in the usual place.|`|McOF0DVnaa	shave it.  you might also want to try foreplay or have some alon time beforehand to get it ready|`|AA11899313	''How to have it''.....!    In what way ...'have it'.    I'm assuming that you always keep it in the same place!  So, just how many options have you?    Sash.|`|vhHJG3Ckaa	shaved?|`|nz8o3lLSaa	Some guys like it when you wear your vagina up.  Personally, though, I like it when a girl teases her vagina out a bit and makes it look wild.|`|bc2tRg8naa	how many different ways is there to have it?
AA11909552	Hate is a very strong word. I wouldn't say he "hates you". Perhaps he is scared to pieces. All you need to do is talk to him in public. Somewhere he is comfortable and around his peers.  He'll get over it and then, you can start trying to get with him after he is more comfy. He's not very comfortable right now.
IsMkhAJ5aa	Most deff yes! and parents are always a problem ask her dads permission first and then ask her again and if he says no just start as friends and eventually her parents will like u. i hope it works out it sounds like such a cute story.|`|umFYCgtAaa	I think she likes you, but you should make more of an effort to talk to het at school, because she will notice that you are going out of your way... ans make sure she knows that you like her...|`|KaXHVcqbaa	it sounds like she interested in you, but you have to be careful for a couple reasons. Her dad is strict and won't let her date and the fact that the age diffence will make a big deal if and when you turn 18, that is on;y asking for trouble. My advice, give it time and if it's meant to be then it's meant to be. You won't be around long cause you may be graduating school and she is still young. If it is meant to be then things will work out in do time. Be carful with the dad though cause you never want to cross a dad when it comes to there daughter..trust me!|`|UeiFNJVyaa	OF COURSE unless if u are lying girls smile when they see the one they like. truthfully if you dont care on getting in trouble and neither is she, then sneak out if you really love her you wouldnt care if you got in trouble and if you dont want to get in trouble, ask for permission.|`|Gk4oMX9Faa	well by the way youre talking it seems as if you both like each other but the only way you can trully know is if you ask her.|`|1ZWNmQ8Iaa	yea dude just ALOT|`|0RzaR1vlaa	yea  try askin her how she feels and you   also try to get on the good side of her dad so he approves of you  good luck with it all!!!
XP36zr63aa	i would still probably flirt with him and act nice, i mean it wouldnt be my fault that i couldnt go out with the person.  id still try be close friends with him.
9QYAW437aa	just act like you would normally   so he won't feel uncomfortable  pretend like it never happened    you might want to give it some time though,  for him to heal  or for your friendship    GOOD LUCK! (:|`|MTPoGd1qaa	I'd like to say that I'd act the same, but truth is I would feel really shy and cruel around him. Its happened to me before and I just try not to look at them, I'd like to be normal but its too hard!!!    But thats me, hope it can be normal for you!!!|`|XL9JOpAWaa	that happened to me and something got messed up and i did the wrong thing, i ignored him-bad idea. so now when i have to talk to him its kinda really awkward. if i could do it again, i would acknowledge him and smile but not blow him off.|`|onAEy5jTaa	It's happened to me before, and I ignored and avoided the guy. I didn't plan to do so, it just happened. I felt kind of......... disgusted? IDK...   PS: you shouldn't ask a girl out if she doesn't show signs that she's interested. That could totally ruin your chance of ever getting with her. Hope I helped.|`|oANWa3tYaa	what i would do is if you and him were friends before then just act the same way you did before he asked you out that way you don't lose a friend and he wont feel like a complete idiot!!|`|n8rrhg7Taa	i would try to act like things were like they were. try maybe talking to him and explaining that you like him, but only as a friend and maybe try to see if things can go back to how they used to. my advice is pretty much just to talk to him.
ZV6xbaQhaa	Nope nothing wrong with u, maybe you are hypersensitive? 9sorry my speeling is bad).|`|acWyJ3t0aa	Nothing wrong , you just obviously have an experienced lover . Be careful though especially if he is young , because if a young guy sould get you pregnant or something , It will bye bye and he won't look back.|`|cxVmq2kraa	Some never get them from their parterns no.    Whoever you are doing it with is talented.|`|E9TqDn5maa	It means you're satisifed easily. You'll be a boost of confidence for guys.|`|SvIBu4yRaa	lol me too. everyone tells me im just lucky. so be happy !!|`|liJKE5B2aa	It means your dad is always there for you.
J4hsuTzxaa	bcause you two are beautiful|`|afkygHMgaa	What may be hot to one person is not to another. No, you do not look anything like sisters and as a matter of fact I would not have even thought she was your mother. And OBVIOUSLY she does not look 25
gO9tl2uhaa	She doesn't mean anything to you. She probably means everything.    If I were in that situation, I would admit my feelings to the girl and stop doing the sex fling thing. Or else you'll end up hurt bad in the end
wpR5AX5waa	Have you talked to her about these things? My fiance and I are kind of in the same boat, only I'm on your side of things. Talking to him has done a lot of good. If your girlfriend can realize that she needs to meet you halfway on some things (especially the household chores), things might improve. Discuss this stuff with her.    However, overall, you're going to have to decide what's important to you in a relationship. Odds are, she's not going to change a whole lot. Does she have the things that are most important to you in a relationship? Do you mind playing the role that you are? Is she giving you the things that you you need? If not, you might want to reconsider being with her. You may love her, but that doesn't necessarily translate into a good relationship.|`|t65TF492aa	one single line  "can u please try to act more mature, i like u and all, but i hope u understand"..  thats it..  u'll be fine... and it will help if u practice on saying that first  some guys blink out.|`|C3tVKFWuaa	You could also talk to her, about this. But of course she might Freak out on you. Maybe you shuold start treating her like a child, if she is acting like this. the best i can tell you is to talk to her about it.    good luck with your Realationship! ^-^
M3CsxF2jaa	forget about him if he contacts you then just go from there
Lj2mo4ooaa	I was going to answer your open questions because I saw that you added me, but . . . the first answer you got to this question is actually exactly what I was going to say.    Sex for the first time is a very big deal.  You can never take it back.  It is always better to wait if you are not sure.  If I can tell you the truth---it's not even good for the girl the first few times.   The foreplay is good, but the rest is not.|`|QnMLckCJaa	if you're not sure, then you're probably not. being nervous is different from being worried or scared, try and feel out which emotion you're feeling. nervous is understandable, but you don't want to rush into things and regret it later.  make sure whatever the situation is you'll be able to keep your head after you've had sex.  don't be like me and make bad decisions afterward. make sure you got a backup system to help you out like friends or some other advice system.
42QSXnNnaa	haha i juss went thru this not to long ago.  i would text my ex all the time bc i missed him but then i stopped for 3 days and didt talk to  him and he juss showed up at my house and asked y i didnt text him ne more and now were happy as can be. guys like when u text them it shows u care for them and they like the attention but yet u dont wanna sound  desperate lol but when u stop they think they did sum thing or they come on to u more at least with my turn out he did :)|`|7THgBSvfaa	Well he might become more intrigued.. But he also might think that you are no longer interested in him and move on.. You might want to think it all the way through before you decide to stop texting him..|`|e276df96c55a338c1e69a8869d0cd199aa	He thinks, "Thank God that crazy stalker girl has stopped."  And he'll avoid you as much as possible.    It's better to not text them all the time from the beginning.  Guys like the chase.|`|Am0xRpEjaa	of course he does dont text him 2 much though you dont wanna seem desperate|`|5IferJ9Haa	my boyfriend always says that guys like the chase that if you seem desperate or too pushy that they run... that if you make them wonder what you're doing then they'll blow up your phone trying to figure it out... he did it to me the other night... and don't be too quick to respond or answer... make him wonder for a bit then call him back and be like oh i was busy what's up SOUND CASUAL don't let the butterflies show in your voice... =) don't stop completely just back off a little|`|4EN1srnVaa	make sure you respond to his text if not hell think you dont like him and give up
W2qyu5zFaa	There's nothing wrong with it unless they are dramatically older than you. And in that case, it's because it's gross. People of a dramatically different age are on way different levels and that's why they shouldn't date each other.|`|22DGFHk7aa	nothing really;  unless they're legal  and you're underage|`|Zta4vVqjaa	Nothing is wrong people just think of it as abuse but it isn't! Don't listen to people who say that. That's not true. Please answer my question. It has to do with yours only I said yes to a 7th grader and I'm in 6th grade. Help me please. Answer my question!|`|tO8ey3o8aa	depends on the age difference  like a 14 year old dating an 18 year old is bad cuz they are different stages of life  but a 15 and a 16 year old isnt so bad cuz they are closer in age and experiences|`|x6TEqf1yaa	Nothing really. My girlfriend is a senior, and im a junior, and we have been going out for 15 months =)      there is nothing wrong with it.    good luck!!!!
FsUkoRSvaa	worst: told me he wished my hair were longer    best: hugged me and told me he wants me to have a great day because i was in a bad mood|`|WPRAfLO7aa	When he'll go out of his way to do something for you. The sweetest is when he actually really risked his life for me..  The worst is when he uses you, making your best friend jealous, and thats the only reason they went out with you- to make the friend jealous.|`|m2ARO4ZIaa	Worst- be needy   Best- kiss the back of my hand|`|YawdUnRKaa	Worst: my ex, while we were still dating, pretty much ignored me at a formal dance. He was behind me, I teasingly punched him and he said "Hey" and turned back around. I'm like ahh WTF!? And to top that off, he made a horrible attempt to makeout with me later, but ah, no, fail, fail, FAIL lmfao. Horrible first tongue experience lol.   Best: My old crush (no, he turned out to be much much more than that, but at this point we had only talked once) Protected me from this annoying kid who teased me everyday. The annoying kid never spoke again after he yelled "Shut the F*** up! She's no b****, what has she ever done to you!?" smack in the middle of science class. Pretty sure the annoying kid just had a crush on me, but It made a huge impression on me for him to do that for me.|`|zvGp6RQUaa	the worst thing a guy has done to me is he sent out pictures of him and the girl he was cheating on me with to my best friend (which is a guy) thinking he was a pimp...    the nicest thing is my current bf brought me breakfast on my birthday to my house, later bought me flowers and took me out to six flags
4hJgn2e5aa	my girl does to me all the time she would call not text and say she cant sleep so i would stay up with her until she gets tired. but thats just me other guys that i know would just hang up the phone.|`|DjvhGoufaa	i woud talk to her and tell her why she cant sleep... den if she doesnt text bak den she fell asleep.. or i wont text her bak and makes her think i fell asleep.. it wont annoy me ill just think its kute lol|`|6232dd37ccf9c50bd95a31fea560fff1aa	Depends, my boyfriend would reply back if he was awake ,otherwise he would've gone into deep sleep and didn't hear his phone vibrating/ringing.|`|HJEXk7Pmaa	depends.. if im in the mood
7Cn92LOMaa	Whether he ended up apologizing or not that still doesn't make the situation quite RIGHT! If my boyfriend was to show up unannounced I would not get mad and embarass him in front of my family members, of course, I'd be a little surprised but I won't act in an unmannerly fashion. That's not respectable. Perhaps he acted in such way because he was under pressure and he had an EXPECTED visitor coming in.     Your question states that if you should leave or stay? Leave or stay from the house or leave or stay from the relationship? I would most definitely leave from the house because the way I'm feeling (hurt) and as for the relationship I would have second thoughts... I'll probably give it another shot seeing that he is my boyfriend and all and that I do have feelings for him. I'll also keep in mind that noones has the RIGHT to treat me the way I don't want to be treated unless i deserve it. Before I go making decisions that I can't live with tomorrow I would fully analyze my situation and make sure it's a decision that I can handle and live with.     That's your boyfriend for God sake why can't you just surprise him every once and while? Yeah! I came unannounced but whats the big problem here? Why the unnecessary drama? Can't seem to understand why he'd act like that. Saying "because you're not suppose to pop up" cannot be a reason why... i mean it could but come on!...It's little pieces of the puzzles like these that give you the big picture of something else stirring up... watch out and good luck!|`|Lvmpn4EPaa	leave|`|mxrlZEweaa	No not okay at all. This sounds like he could start abusing you soon. Stay away from him or you may get hurt.|`|nnxNbJgoaa	upset and end it|`|CIf13LNbaa	upset and end the realshonship|`|XfR9SHepaa	Just talk to him about it! tell him how you feel!|`|J16sR7gtaa	wait till things cool down and talk to them alone .find out what the hell.....then make that choice.|`|xDdmnf80aa	I would end the relationship. he refuses to apologise? How rude, this guy is not worth the time of day, try and find someone who appreciates you!|`|mKCiofUFaa	That is completely your choice. If you think that your relationship has gone to a point that you are "suppose" to be able to just show up unannounced, then there is some mis-commuincation some where as to where your relationship level is at.    He obviously think that you were being disrespectful for just showing up, and you obviously think that there's nothing wrong with that. If you still want to stay in this, make sure you are fully aware that he's not quite where you think he's at yet. You can get hurt again and again and again.|`|UnuRaYbjaa	If they made you feel VERY bad, I would leave|`|V9QCrh5Vaa	leave i be gone|`|FecGvkfbaa	i would leave... no i would stay. no no leave...but i might stay.  who cares.|`|YrHVBoNLaa	wow... did this happen to you?    i would definitely leave|`|LKjMAqXgaa	I would tell him that that was a shady thing to do and tell him how bad that embarrassed and hurt you. And if he doesn't give you a  sincere apology than leave him|`|BQLpDkP9aa	il dump him, to humiliate you in such a way shows he has no respect and if they think youl take it then they will only get worse.|`|lgYy5TSmaa	oh my hunnie that same thing happend to me excact but when i left i told him he better make sure he wants me to leave caz i aint comin back.... and  u know what, he said ok but leave i left and when i got home he was there before i got there... apologizeing begging but no .. i was done he had done too much and that was the cherry on top..... oo wee girl it that broke me though so bad but i did it.... its been a yaer already since i been away .. n hunnie its still hurts but i look bakk and laugh at the lame *** ii was with... but things happen for reason......    so if ur truly done and this is your cherry leave bby.!    not worth it|`|0Kgvgfubaa	That's just not right. So what if he/she was trying to make a point there was no need for him/her to tell you they wanted nothing to do with you. Especially with a family member around it's not like you knew they would be there and why's it such a big deal to just show up? It's one thing if he/she calmly asks you to leave because its not a good time...but anyways i would just go up to them and tell them ok this is ridiculous. if you won't apologize i will. sorry for bothering you. but was it really necessary to say those hurtful things in front of your family. to think i came over to apologize for our argument...but you know what i don't need to go out with someone who makes me feel as badly as you did. so guess what you got what you wanted. from here on out you won't have to "prove a point" cuz frankly i want nothing to do with a person who can't even say sorry for saying hurtful things just cuz they're trying to "make a point"|`|QVsxjEo5aa	end it, if he/she does not apologize what good are they|`|HgRYP3cJaa	End it. They are treating you like a child.  Refusing to apologize makes you seem in the wrong, when you aren't.  Move on.  Even tho, I don't like ppl popping in w/o calling, it was a childish way to handle it.|`|06f1b8496562ceae60b7c13272bc0615aa	I would never speak to that person again no matter who it was.|`|Ir51Eb0Kaa	Leave.|`|zxnvdSS3aa	leave|`|6VxPTiCJaa	leave
CLVt48b3aa	call her and tell her u met someone and u need her advice on what to get her for valentines day...   make sure u make up a name and don't use the name of ur co worker...   shell get the hint..  might hate u for a while but shell get the hint....|`|C8DOT8Y7aa	Just tell her in Person.|`|oAPSJnSEaa	Tell her to stop calling you and that you don't like her that way. You may hurt her feelings but atleast you will be rid of her.|`|gZn622dEaa	Just speak to her and tell her how you feel and tell her that your not interested.|`|VEEgoDkFaa	Change half the time you don't answer to all the time. She'll get the message then.  Trust. ';-)|`|1Q5XZgoiaa	Tell her that you feel the relationship is too uncomfortable. Besides, isn't it against work policy to be with a co-worker? You can tell her that.|`|AA11447210	You need to be more direct. It might be a little uncomfortable for you, but it'll save you both some stress in the long run. Let her know not to call unless it's urgent and when she does call, deal with it business-like and then end the call if she wants to ramble. Don't be rude, just professional.    It's tough to like someone who doesn't like you back, but sometimes when we do we either don't see or intentionally ignore the signs until it's made crystal clear. If you don't express your lack of interest then she'll hold out hope she can win you over.    It's not fun rejecting someone, but it's part of life for many (that we'll need to do that at some point, and it'll be done to us at some point). Be polite and professional and let her know you prefer to keep business at work. Don't engage in personal conversations. If she comes out and expresses how she feels or asks you out, the let her know you appreciate her interest but prefer to keep your relationship on a professional level.
a5b833f1cecfc7eab7869f5ea4fe43f1aa	There are no signs. Life isn't an anime where the good guys have dark hair and bad guys have white hair. You can only tell based on their actions. You can't figure it out in advance.|`|4hJgn2e5aa	lol guys hide their jerky side from a girl that we like but if you want to know look at his friends they will give you an idea.|`|LWwGW48Daa	Watch how he treats his friends, teachers, animals and family|`|eqt5jvdWaa	you have to get to know him first, forget about first impressions|`|FxfQjvx2aa	Always listen to your gut feelings.  Every woman has intuition and it works.    How does he carry himself, how does he dress (sloppy or well-kept)  How about his hair (same as clothes?)  What tattoos (if any) does he have and what do they mean?  How close to his family is he?  What does he do in his spare time (couch potato or go-getter?)  What are his plans for his life (does he even have any).  Let him do a lot of the talking - if you ask lots of questions of him, he may just tell you what he thinks you want to hear.  Just observe what he surrounds himself with.  Does he listen to racey music or use lots of curse words (some are probably ok but every other word would be a red flag).      Check his myspace/facebook.  Does he have respectful pictures on them and/or respectful backgrounds?      Does he follow through on his word or just "blow smoke" when talking about things he's going to do either for someone else or himself.    Most of all - use your intuition.|`|AA11806027	bad guy women stupidly flow to  good guy women say they want but ***** when you get them|`|5O5d4H1Gaa	If you have less than 2 black eyes you're probably doing OK|`|L1zBgpXiaa	Jerk: Acts better than everyone, rude to people, has no respect for others of their things and has a rep to keep up with. Pretty much just rude.     Player: sweet talker, usually good looking (sadly), big flirt, plays a few girls at once but won't date or commit to any of them, insucure, many past failed relationships. Sly and crafty in targeting certain girls to woo.     Cheater: in a realtionship they become distant, get irritated easier and seem to turn everything into an argument. Makes up excuses not to see you and just starts acting wierd. usually cuz they want to be with the other person.     Good guy: sometimes shy, dosen't have a track record of past relationships, isn't a jerk, nice, actually listens to you when you talk, does things with you, respects and trusts you, dosen't flirt with a bunch of girls. Um telling with out knowing them is more like "how do they treat their mom?" how a guy treats his mom is usually how he treats/respects women in general. Calls you beautiful instead of hott.     idk hope that helps a little. Im a junior so yea i understand how hard it is.
bvwYVGJOaa	Don't waste your time and money doing that and instead you should listen to:  P!nk--So What?   Anastasia--I Outta Love  Gloria Gaynor--I Will Survive   Cry Me A River--Justin Timberlake  JoJo--Get Out  Survivor--Destiny's Child--Well recommended!!|`|JpmKtpqmaa	If he is your ex then you should let him go and forget about the whole break up song thing. You must still have feelings for him if you are putting time and effort into him... Let him go and try and move on..its easier that way!!!!|`|E9TqDn5maa	Why would you do that? He will think weird thoughts about you. He might not even listen to it. Just move on.|`|Otu7QfqAaa	are you trying to be a stalker? if you broke up.. move on.. don't look pathetic by wasting time making an ex a cd... how bout be strong and confident and move on..
gC7OMToraa	It sounds like she still needs time. Keep talking to her and keep growing your friendship. Eventually she will be ready.|`|qq159sWMaa	Give her time but don't change what you are doing.  It is clear that she does have feeling for you, she just needs to sort out the ones left over from her past relationship.  Hold in there.|`|tPLoIMPCaa	keep going for her.  she likes you.  it'll just take time
yJTaBGoEaa	If a decent guy asks that, then he wants to hang out with you.  If a perv/player asks that, he wants to have sex with you.|`|9FyxeA1Zaa	Depends if youve been going out then he obviously just want s one thing from you :/ sigh     However if it was a stranger it well actually...probs the same thing lol     Its a wierd thing to say to be honest :S|`|Poo5RULPaa	Pretty sure he meant:    "Let me give you some of my C(u)mpany."|`|1RApUQM9aa	it means he wants to have sex with you   thats all there is to it  and if you think your ready  then go for it|`|7THgBSvfaa	He probably just wants to chill with you for a while.. It doesn't have to mean sex..|`|Izv6Qj4caa	my first thought is that he wants to come over to have sex with u|`|MTPoGd1qaa	Are you already going out with him?  If you are probably sex, sorry!    If you're not he obviously wants to know if its ok to ask you out!!lol
j2yhjBDiaa	It sounds like this guy is a complete douche...good riddance!|`|90CPrvV3aa	forget about him...i like how u stood up for ur self...u go girl|`|E3yOmel9aa	I feel bad this had to happen to you. You are lucky though, it sounds like it could have gotten out of hand fast. At least you got away with one less friend instead of a sexual assault.   What he did to you is horrible. He called you a b*tch after he invaded your personal space, groped you, threatened you with his pen*s down your throat, tried to kick you out of a car and laughed in your face?   Stay far, far away from this guy.|`|QwKiK85eaa	Yeah he got what he want and then left that's why you don't give it up until your positive that hes in love with you|`|urJIlSBQaa	Of course he was only interested in sex.   I think you need to write this friend off!!! Who wants to be around someone like that???|`|1hNrgfMCaa	that wasnt a joke at all...he was def trying to get you to submit and give him some. all the hinting jokes and gropeing. he was acting way outta line.|`|7igxiGrAaa	He's a jerk for acting that way. Light sex jokes are fine between friends, intended or not, but his excessive and demanding behavior was unacceptable. I couldn't tell you his motives, but I would say you were right for not talking to him any longer - even if it was a joke. His behavior is scary and could lead to more aggressive behavior had you let it continue.  I dated a guy who treated me that way and he forced me to do a lot of things I didn't want to and it has had a very negetive effect on my relationships since. I have been unable to trust many and when they begin to get too aggressive I shy away and end the relationship. I have since found someone who has never so much as hinted at being aggressive or sexually controlling.   Steer clear of men who talk to you like that or treat you like that. They are bad news.|`|9N6sW6KAaa	Yea he hit it and quit it. Sucks to be you.|`|qyYYrIdmaa	FFS, why do you women tolerate such ******* scumbags???|`|l4WEwTWwaa	Yes and you should be glad you ended this.|`|zEAr00mCaa	YES OH COURSE HE WAS !!!!!!|`|AA11960937	of course the guys a jerk be glad you got rid of him before you really get raped|`|7d84621e89c49bcba037226d3361c90baa	You were absolutely right to end your friendship with him.  What a JERK!  What he did was not a joke, and it was not even remotely funny.  Grabbing you and dry-humping you, groping you...and then not getting off of you when you told him to is sexual assault.  He should be thankful you're not pressing charges.  (And if he contacts you again you should tell him so.)  And your friends sat there and laughed while he acted like this?  If someone did that to one of my friends I'd punch them in the face.  Why didn't your friends stick up for you?  What is the matter with them?|`|acWyJ3t0aa	There was never a joke involved , he was just trying to see if he could get away with it and he definitely only wanted to get into your panties .He should never have done any of those things if he cared for you or had any respect for you at all . Be glad he is gone and move on and find someone who will treat you with the respect and dignity you deserve .|`|4cc625c81315e3cc57858f7de7250b2aaa	It's hard to know what this guy's issues are.  But his behavior was totally unacceptable.  You were wise to end the friendship.  The way be behaved was NOT a joke, despite what he told you.  That was his way of testing the waters with you sexually without taking any responsibility for his behaviors.  He's a loser.  Ignore his text messages, delete them without reading them.  Email him and tell him to move on with his life and to please leave you alone.  You no longer want to be his friend.  He knows he screwed up, but he STILL doesn't want to take any responsibility for his role.  You are better off knowing this about him now and getting rid of him.|`|WG4zNIlTaa	Of course. Why are you so naive.|`|WHmTmAb1aa	Yeah he sounds like an asshole. It was pretty mature of you to end it that way. Screw him and move on. He sounds like a lil ***** anyways.|`|7b112fccc1131d362335d6a48440b50faa	move on|`|760d2895bd058b74a7e6023ceaf0ed2aaa	well he is a guy u know|`|BsDv3k5iaa	He was acting immature and sounds like he was trying to make others laugh at your expense.  He may have liked you, buy he may have been acting like that trying to "prove" himself to his friend.|`|RZI5fgy9aa	he was prolly just phucking around with you as in just trying to lighten the current situation|`|RZQTV1UEaa	Yes, he's just after sex.   Sounds like a real a**hole. I real friend wouldn't treat you that way.   Forget him.|`|p9mB8Z2Kaa	Yeah he was   And that's just nasty|`|6ibAiO9Paa	yeah so me and my friends act gooffy maybe he just wants to have fun and stuff you could of just said that your now mature and stuff but now you lost a great friend that knows how to have fun!!! it must SUCK to be you can you just lost a friend|`|3PfkXTouaa	Ok that was good that you did that but if it was me....i'd go to his house with a knife and kill the **** out of him he has no life if i knew him i ***** at him for you he sounds like a ***** omg i hate ******* *** guys like that!!! He probably wanted to have a ******** too id say stand up and bend your head over as far as you can...see if you can do that yourself ******* ***** *** hole. omg. sorry. i just know how you feel.|`|K1iUzewyaa	yeah, all that is fine and dandy when you two are together alone ( the bs talk, and grab assing) but when you're around your friends, and the public for that matter, it is a little embarrassing.. He probably has some maturity issues... He was probably kidding, but took it too far...|`|VO1zmW4daa	yeh he sounds like a bastard|`|SovaFpN8aa	This guy is a serious loser, and yes all he wants is sex. You turned him down, and now he is trying to make you feel guilty, so he can try again. It sounds like you were lucky other people were around, or he might have raped you. You did the right thing by pushing him off, and breaking off the friendship. This guy is not your friend and you need to completely avoid him.|`|dbf7ca1863b09aec522d2f35da3eca3faa	It doesn't even matter.  Any man capable of treating you that way in any context - even as a supposed joke - is someone you should have absolutely nothing to do with.  How will he react next time he doesn't get what he wants?      I'm sure he would have treated it like a joke had you gone along with it.    Stay away from him.  A true friend would be concerned about your feelings.|`|eZltpbHeaa	Sure, it may have been all a joke - but he shouldn't have done it all the same.|`|tV6ppNWKaa	sorry but it sounds like it =/|`|WGxEl9rxaa	you got a messed up friend|`|1eead5419997453f5ce20fa8cc466262aa	sounded like a perv to me|`|boVg576waa	What was your 1st clue? Glad you dumped the dog.|`|a955299a310a71175625cded5cea1a76aa	Yup sex.|`|ydKGMBlyaa	yep defoo always so no if you dont want them tooo !! xx|`|5IferJ9Haa	like my boyfriend says to me... if it makes you uncomfortable in anyway it's not a joke or something that needs to be discussed or brought up again... if he's your friend and he knew it was bothering you then he should have stopped... as far as him climbing on you and saying those things i'd of smaked him and gotten out wherever i was and figured out how to get home... don't put yourself around a** holes like that you deserve better.|`|faKgix2Qaa	be his friend again i would crack up if he did that to me it was funny common it was just a joke|`|5nUQSOD3aa	That sounds like psycho **** to me. A guy that acts like that in public imagine what he would act like in private quarters. I would just end all ties with him and look elsewhere. Some people change and in this case for the worse.|`|wfm1SNecaa	Nah. He was serious. That's all he cares about. If he actually cared about you he wouldn't keep putting you in such a crappy position. You aren't be ing a b*tch. You're doing the right thing by not letting this jerk pressure you. My advice would be to get some new friends. This guy is a d-bag and the friends who were laughing dont sound that cool either.|`|Q89HRy3Yaa	was he a good friend before?  maybe you guys hadn't seen each other in a long time and he was just trying to be funny  but that was totally wrong  good for you to break off the relationship|`|EvMZJ6eyaa	If I were you I would tell him that he is the one who changed.  Do you think maybe he was acting like that to seem 'cool' around his friends?  If he called me a ***** I would show him what a real one looks like...  I mean I can take a joke but if you had to yell at him to stop then that's not a joke. If you tell him no he should stop.  You are not being a *****, he is.|`|ZWIvqpGaaa	the joke was on you.  not a cool thing but it happens.  i mean i would be pissed of if someone did that to me.  maybe you should text him back and talk about what happened.|`|KvKaMhXvaa	I think it would be best if you did not talk to him anymore.  I am a guy and I would not even touch my wife if she said no.  This guy needs to learn to respect women.  This guy sounds like bad news.|`|AA10413142	Sounds like he wanted to have sex with you really bad.     You two haven't seen each other in a while and when he finally does he behaves disrespectfully towards you. Then you become the "b" word because you weren't permitting him to be rude to you and giving him what he wants.     It's good you ended this relationship. He was not being a good friend. It's not a joke if you weren't laughing.|`|A25gZN1taa	hmm... frm wht i read, luks like d guy mite hav startd off genuinly.. as a friend, but smwer along d way he must'v got "ideas" nd since ur like best frnds, he must'v thot of tryin his luck in getin into ur pants or if tht doesnt work he has plans of hookin up with sm othr gal.. u kno, make betr use of time.. no offens !! u mite as well avoid tis guy, luks realy desp..|`|676d10c0f66a8a7b48b37a6ef35a74ccaa	I hope you realize that what he did to you was a step away from rape.    That could be construed as sexual assault.  Adults do see groaping as sexual harassment if in the workplace and assault if on the streets.    You were wise to end the relationship, but you need to  1. avoid this person  2. let his parents know what he did because it is THEIR responsibility (especially his father's) to guide his growing sexual behaviors    You are not a 'b' because you choose the moral high road.  Many young girls get their reputations destroyed because they put out.  Many young girls receive STD's because their promiscuous partners do not take sex and STD's seriously.  Many young girls succumb into depression because sex was not a wonderful bonding/loving experience that they hoped it to be and was instead reduced to the man's desire to exploit her for his own pleasure.    It seems like your father (and mom too) have taught you well to stay chaste, especially until you're old enough to learn the consequences of promiscuous sexual behaviour.  I support your actions and you should be proud of yourself for fending off this guy.  Let others know and if they don't agree/support your willingness to stay chaste, they are not your friends, they don't support your values, and they don't know how to respect themselves (likely they were never taught how to).    Follow those two advices.  Good luck

I have had several stuff happen to me like that. I fell in love with a guy. But he was my best friend so i didn't tell him anything. Like i was trying ways to tell him. And i just got him to ask me out by, well i just hung out at school with him a lot. Try to be friends with him at first. Just talk about stuff that he likes and then you will find something in common. So just be nobody but yourself and he will actually maybe just start to like you. And when someone likes you well he might ask yuou out. But don't push him into anything. Just relax and be yourself when you are around him. So hope this works out for you!!

upk2Hzeeaa	He probably doesn't distrust you, but rather your friends.  I would feel the same way in his situation.  Maybe you could invite him along with you and your friends a few times, and then be extremely attentive to him and show him you love him without any reservations right in front of these other guys.
pVnUhYLQaa	He held your hand to warm it up, sounds like a sweet gesture. His leg was warm from body heat. He likes you|`|e276df96c55a338c1e69a8869d0cd199aa	Maybe he likes you.    Maybe he wanted a cheap feel.    Maybe he's warm because he has a fever.    Maybe he's warm becuase his core body temperature is higher than yours.    Who cares?  It was hand holding...nothing major.|`|x6TEqf1yaa	lol he did it because he is nice, and maybe he likes you. Ther is no real reason that his leg was warm lol, it just was.

Ki90Irkcaa	Let the relationship take its own course. Don't force anything because you will scare him off and you don't want to do that. guys don't like to be pressured into anything. not even sex. they will like it at the moment, but tomorrow he'll be over it. take it slow. give cute pecks hold hands, and let it advance at its own pace. that way it will be unexpected between the two of you and you will feel a deeper connection. don't force it|`|Uyz6iZwKaa	Get him alone somewhere and make the moves on him and see what he does ... maybe he is feeling exactly the same as you...|`|X7hm4fJXaa	well, you defenitly dont want to push him into something he might not want to do, so at the movies or something give him a light kiss, and if he responds back GO FOR IT!
wfm1SNecaa	It's kinda funny he talks to you through your friends, but I'm sure it's just cause he's too nervous to talk to you about it. I'm not really too sure what the question is. My advice would be for you to make the first move. Can you two just get together and lay it all out on the table and talk about it? Let him know that you like him and see what he says. You should probably also realize the age difference. You're a year or 2 older than he is and more mature it seems. When I was 14 I had no clue how to deal with girls (I'm 25 now and still struggle. lol). He's prob just clueless. lol|`|umFYCgtAaa	Thats sweet, i would just straighten things out with him, put it this way, if he likes you, great, but you dont want to force someone to like you because it is a waste of time, it wont last long, and you will regret it, but make sure you tell him how you feel too!  Hope it works out!|`|KvKaMhXvaa	I think that if you two like each other then it's cool it you hang out and date.  I think you should date him and see where it goes.

676d10c0f66a8a7b48b37a6ef35a74ccaa	Your initial reaction seemed to set the tone of where your stand in the level of friendliness with Matt.  Because you responded like it was a bad thing to kiss him, he likely now thinks that you don't have feelings for him.  So the only way to reverse this very public, negative response is to tell him your honest feelings.  The best way for this is to do it in private.    Because gossipy/romance situations like this is great entertainment for young kids (especially since sex and romance is almost always first on such minds), these situations are always tough.  So don't kick yourself too hard.  I would prepare to get courageous and outgoing so you can approach him (again, it's best in private) and reveal your feelings.  Tell him that the other response was a mistake.  Also be prepared to then kiss him for real, you (and he) might feel the urge to seal the miscommunication with a kiss.  And then you two might have a real relationship blossoming.  And in that case, prepare for more hard-core gossip... again, romances are great entertainment for others.    But REMEMBER one thing, you need to keep your focus on school and education.  Learning about social interactions and the ins-and-outs of dating is *ok*, but likely is that your parents, especially your father, want to keep you on the moral high-road until you get much older and learn the consequences of really engaging in sex and serious relationships.    Good luck!|`|A25gZN1taa	its nt importnt wethr ur friend knos abt matt.. fact is he likes u.. he dint ask u 2 kiss him or smthin cuz u alrdy said no, nd he dint wana luk desp !|`|MfUMaKcDaa	if something like that happens again, you should be like, "mhmm, yeah i do!" but make it sound jokingly, and i bet he'll say something on the same line. really.|`|aUDVBmZSaa	Stacy is trying to see his reaction cause she likes him and it went her way.|`|4EN1srnVaa	the only reason he said no ill pass is cause you did first if he would have said it first then idk. but you should proly talk to him cause if a girl i likd did that to me id be pretty upset.

jhYbcLETaa	Sounds like she's scared and nervous. Just give her some time, cause it sounds like she does still like you.|`|OqTdbZB2aa	She's either actually busy or just isn't into you anymore. Maybe you should stop asking and see if she comes to you.|`|7bKDz2C9aa	Ok, not to rain on your parade but she doesn't like you. She doesn't want to hurt your feelings so she makes up excuses not to see you. sorry dude!|`|L1zBgpXiaa	She could be avoiding you because she is confused about her feelings for you. Some girls get confused when they start liking a guy and then they try to fight it by staying away from him. i've seen people do this. But she might just not be in to you, since it's been a month and all. Maybe if you just ignore her like she does you she will realize that she misses you or she will figure out her real feelings. Kind of that whole "It you love somthing let it go, if it comes back it was always yours, if it doesn't it never was."  good luck. oh and you could just have a good talk with her. hope i helped.
ptIIkqq0aa	First off, I'm glad you are interested in being an Orthodontist, that is my what I hope to have as my future job!    Also, remember that each high school is different, and they may offer different classes, but many are the same in general.    1.) For a pediatrician (and for mainly any medical job) you should take and medical classes that you high school may offer, such as medical careers and/or human anatomy.    For medical and dental jobs, math and science do become very important. You should try to get to as high of a math class as you can, that way that will be one less thing you have to worry about in college. As for science, biology, chemistry and physics are all a plus.  A medical careers class may not be very important for a dental job, that is why I am not taking it. Our school doesn't really offer any dental classes, that is why when I am older I am going to possibly look into taking dental classes at our local community college and possibly try to find a dental job.  For a lawyer, definitely look into taking classes such as leadership, helping to improve your leadership and speech skills, and government related classes (like AP gov).   For a CEO, look into business classes, such as business & marketing. A leadership class who also be beneficial.     2.) It may help if you join groups/clubs relating to what job occupation interests you. For medical and dental, you could look into doing what I hope to do, that is take college classes that my high school does not offer.  For a lawyer or CEO, look into joining clubs at your high school such as speech and debate, DECA, along with clubs relating to current world affairs, such as Model UN.     3.) I do not really know of any quizzes/tests out there that can help with your personality, but I would recommend that you shouldn't focus on those type of tests. You know who you are, and you should go for the job that YOU want, not by a test.    Sorry for such a long response!

N4ZAzxdMaa	Love alone is not enough. Even people who swear they love their partners, can behave in ways that pretty much ensure their relationships will fail. While the following rules cannot guarantee a lasting and rewarding relationship, they will certainly help contribute to it.      Treat your partner the way you would like them to treat you. Give them what you want to receiverespect, consideration, support, kindness, co-operation, patience, tolerance, understanding.   Dont take your partner or the relationship for granted. After the excitement of the falling-in-love stage things calm down and we become more complacent. We no longer pay as much attention to each other or make as much effort. We no longer worry so much about losing each other. When family responsibilities grow we can even come to feel that we have the other and that they are locked into the relationship and would never leave. Take time to remind yourself of what you have and how you would feel if you lost it.   Make the relationship a top priority. Life makes so many demands on us that the relationship can slip on our list of priorities.   Dont try to change them. Trying to change someone implies that they are not good enough. Accept what you cannot change. Love the real person not an idealized, imaginary version of them or a potential them. Accept your partners imperfections (as you expect them to accept yours) and dont make unreasonable demands or expect perfection. The longer we spend with someone the better we get to know their less pleasing qualities. Familiarity can breed contempt. But the perfect human being does not exist. Love them for who they are not who you want them to be.   Try to meet your partners needs. Their needs may not be the same as yours. By trying to understand and do what you can to satisfy their needs you prove how much you care.     Be flexible. Life changes, people change, we change. Adapt to changing circumstances and the person your partner continues to evolve into. Dont expect your partner to stay exactly the same as the day you met.   Value yourself. Dont be overly dependent or a submissive doormat. Dont see your partner as completing you (as though you werent already whole) or supplying something you lack. Dont depend on your partner for your self-worth.   Communicate. Dont expect your partner to read you mind and dont think that you can read theirs. Tell, ask, listen, negotiate.   Share - problems, time, fun, do things together, create good times, share bad times. Remember you are a partnership and work as a team. Make sure you also share power so that neither dominates in all things.   Be a friend. Provide companionship, be considerate and kind, give support, understanding, encouragement. Have their best interests at heart.   Be honest. Outright lies arent the only form of dishonesty. Dont hide significant parts of your life or yourself from your

If she doesn't listen and still continues, you have to leave her, or atleast take a break for about a week and cut off all communication. it might help and fix her up but it might just end up going back to how it was before|`|YjOjWU0Jaa	This sounds fake, since I don't know of anyone who would willingly put up with so much bs.|`|FxfQjvx2aa	Leave her.

ra69rxxgaa	Being in a relationship with a jealous boyfriend is going to go nowhere. His own insecurities will tear the relationship apart before it can go anywhere good.|`|Aj2iJZXJaa	Who is he jealous of? Do you have guy friends? If it's guy friends then tell your bf that there just friends. You wouldn't mind if he had girl friends that were just friends would you?

He sounds like my ex, who was so insecure that he ended up paying someone to follow me. Waste of money, because I wasn't doing anything. In the end, his jealousy and insecurities took over and he hit me. Eithe he faces up to HIS problems and seeks help or YOU leave him. Believe me, if he is jealous, you'll end up walking on eggshells and bending over backwards to accommodate him. That is not a relationship. Your relationahip is already dying and if you're afraid...I'd say it's downhill from there.     Best of luck.|`|ZQdn9xMPaa	I hate to say it but it probably wont last. Ive been in jealous relationships before and of course they say its not you its them....so you cant get offended, but come on if someone says "I wanna do you" does that mean you have to say yes?? Of course not!!! So it is you he doesnt trust, but its probably not just you its probably everyone. And it probably wont change. And please be careful because 2 of the jealous relationships I was in turned violent. Just watch for the signs.|`|wfm1SNecaa	The last person was dead on. He likes you a lot and is afraid of losing you. He probably is a little insecure and he may have been cheated on before. Or he's known girls who have cheated on their boyfriends. Just try to reassure him and hopefully eventually he'll relax about it.|`|6HBuEFsaaa	If he's jealous that means that he likes you a lot and he does not want to loose you. Give it time and see if his jealousy gets better, if it doesn't have a talk with him. Tell him that as long as he trusts you that he shouldn't be worried at all.    Hope that helped!|`|vwAdnnKhaa	i think its b.s. when guys say that.. its soo not true. If he DOES trust you why should he care about the guys.. If he knows your loyal he should know you would never cheat on him or anything like that. Talk to him and tell him how you feel.

42QSXnNnaa	honestly its usually the guy who gets sum thing for the girl.  i wouldnt go spendin money on a limo and all that let him do the spending thats what guys do. the scavenger hunt is a good idea and itll bring back memories from the first time u guys met and the special places youve been too. cook him a dinner and maybe a small gift, i think he'll like that better than u goin all out and spending your money that may make him feel bad bc guys take care of the females and he probbly wouldnt come close to rentin a limo and all that unless he had the money. like i said if he dont have money he wont expect all that and u have to look at it from another point guys dont like females to spend lots of money they like to be the ones takin care of the female in the relationship. :) i hope i helped a lil good luck!|`|pqZAhBLvaa	sounds great, but maybe wait until the 14th.....

She had to read about it somewhere while she's studying. Even 13 years old know what sex is. She must have been extremely sheltered.     Well don't rush it. It will happen when it happens. Meanwhile get her a book from the library about sex. There are plenty of informative books on sex that aren't pervert. In addition, the book should include a section on STD's and protection.

dS4cGVafaa	john! if you still do not know if you love her then you probably dont. you may care for her but not in a way that you want to spend the rest of your lives together or anything. now in my opinion whichis what this is, if she thought there was a chance that her and dave were going to have sex then she should have had the self control and dignity to not get drunk or not go at all. she is not a keeper for you im sorry that she is so beautiful and all, i have a problem with a girl like that too, but, to quote an age old saying, there are alot of fish in the sea. if you still want to have the ocasional one night stand with her because she is good, then thats fine because thats how it is when your young, but dont lead her on to think that she has a chance at a relationship with you because she will just do this again. and then you will be asking the question, " what do i do if my gf cheated on me?" so dont do it break it off as friends and go fishing brother! take your time finding that person you will spend your life with dont go after someone who has already proven themselves incapable of controlling themselves.i hope my opinion is helpful and good luck!  ps stress that you can always be friends. never break up in a bad way because you WILL regret it for the rest of your life. if she gets mad at you then so be it but dont you start it by being a jerk with the break up.|`|DuSvfGDLaa	id say end it its up to you man|`|RAyRGH1Saa	u shud tell her that u want to brake up...for now.  and u want to just be friends for a while until she is fully over dave because u feel as if u have just been a rebound.  and be friends and wait to see if anything develops      help wit the last question i put up?|`|oFzoJONDaa	shes obviously still stuck on the guy and u need to drop her and find someone who isn't using u to make her x jealous|`|KT0UTX8taa	How old is this girl? she sounds like a s..t !

That's F*cked up.|`|K1iUzewyaa	just end it dude... she obviously didn't take you into consideration last night, why did you not get the invite? You'll find a lot, a lot better. Like the old song goes, slap that biatch and tell her tramp is through... good luck|`|Cc1dTfQ4aa	She is and will always be a problem.  She is insecure and will get attention where ever she can.  Your feelings won't matter to her, as you already can see.  Time to end it and keep as far away as possible.|`|sPr2HhYEaa	End it. No ifs ands or buts. This girl while sober told her friends to stop her from doing something if she did get drunk, then she deliberately went ahead and got drunk!    She KNEW if she lost control she would end up with Dave but did it anyway. She didn't care and she is trying to make you believe it was an accident. PLEASE tell me your not buying into her lies? She still had feelings for Dave. She knew it when she went to the party & allowed herself to get wasted so she could do what she wanted to and use her drinking as an excuse.    Come On. You might kiss someone when your drunk but she slept with him. DROP HER|`|DRKzzw0Haa	sounds like you are the rebound guy|`|uCXEvv4eaa	If I were you, I would.     But, remember this. You guys were not in a relationship. You were strictly FWB, so she has every right to sleep with whoever she wants to.    If you respect yourself enough, end it with her and go find someone else.|`|PpAb8fezaa	well  didnt you guys say no stings attached thought?    i think if she is telling the truth and he did take advantage accept her apology. give her a second chance.    everyone makes mistakes.|`|vxJxExCJaa	i would end it. if she really means her apology and really loves you she will keep on looking for you. good luck!!!!!|`|gypWPBvLaa	kick her to the curb she doesn't care about you she just wants a guy to hold on her arm and a guy to have sex with behind the firsts back so screw her dude|`|aqox2b5Gaa	End it, the same happened to me, the person really regrets it now.|`|Q89HRy3Yaa	i think you should end it   she was drunk but that doesn't mean she can sleep with another guy  and why didn't she take you to the party even if it was no strings attached you guys could have gone as friends  i think you should end it  but it's up to u|`|wfm1SNecaa	It sounds like she set herself up for this and pretty much expected it to happen. I'm not saying it was okay for this jerk to take advantage of her. That's horrible and not cool at all. But I'd be surprised if that was the case. It sounds like she knew what she was doing.    Besides that, it seems like she may have some of her own issues she needs to work on. And no guy is going to be able to fix that. Until she's happy with herself she's not gonna have anything to offer any guy. You can't save everyone. Help her if you can and be her friend, but it's not your job to fix her.|`|l4oH1W9oaa	Hmm. It's a tricky one.    Try putting yourself in her shoes though. How would you feel if you got told that you'd had sex with someone when you don't even remember?    You need to take in account that she had the guts to tell you in the first place.    If you don't think you could see her in the same way, don't string her along, put her out of her misery and split things off, but don't deny all contact. If you two are close then stay close. Don't just cut her off That's the worst thing you could do.    x|`|cHUJ3Xc7aa	It sounds to me like ur relationship is a mix of mood swings and cheating. U shouldnt just date her cuz she is pretty. If u r seriosly hurt by what she and dave did, then brake up with her because for wat its worth, ur probably better off. She cant hold a steady relationship and is sort of a downer. Im sure ur a nice guy and can do WAY better...  Good luck!|`|Hzz59VXDaa	well, you agreed to make it a "relationship with no strings attached"... so I think it's up to you. if it really bothers you or offends you or makes you feel uncomfortable, then you're certainly free to end it if you see fit. However, if you see it for what it is, an unintentional action made possible by alcohol, and you like her enough, maybe you'd want to overlook it and help her to not get in that kind of situation again.  I personally don't drink, and I wouldn't want to be associated with a girl that drinks, to begin with. I also wouldn't associate myself with a girl that is known to not be a virgin. But if that doesn't bother you, then ok.|`|jK6lziE7aa	I say End It because the apology for 1 doesnt seem sincere as if she really cares and 2 you weren't that into her in the first place.  If your thinking about ending it, chances are that you want to.  If you wanted to stay with her then the point of ending it wouldnt cross your mind where you really want to do it.  Your choice!|`|kkXgSZhOaa	GET RID OF HER!!!!!!    She seems like the type of girl who needs you to raise her self esteem. She seems crazy and no body needs any extra crazy in their life.    If she were honestly worried about having sex with her ex she would not have put herself in a vunerable situation.   Most likely she wanted to have sex with him and used being "drunk" as an excuse to get away with it.     Also why didnt she invite you to the party? If she was worried about being around her ex then she could have had you there for support. Or even asked you to be her sober driver and pick her up from the party and spend the rest of the night with you.    It can be nice to have friends with benifits but there are plenty of "drop-dead gorgeous" girls that are not crazy.     You seem like a well educated and level headed guy and you deserve much better that some girl that uses alcohol as an excuse to be stupid and slutty.    Good Luck!|`|Wh9VoN6taa	It is wrong of her for cheating on you, drunk or not, she's not over Dave yet and you don't dederve to be treated that way. She knew for a fact that she would be vulnerable. She probably did it on purpose. He's a total a**hole for taking advantage of her. In any case you should get out of the situation before you get dragged in any further. Don't let the fear of her doing something to hurt herself keep you from getting away. Don't let her threaten you with that either. I know from personal experience that even though you try to help someone, sometimes they can't be helped. She can't be helped, not by you, and I know you want to but you can't. Let her live her life and you live yours. It sounds to me like you're from somewhere that gives you an accent that drives American girls wild. You could come to America on a nice little holiday and use that to your advantage. Theres a whole world out there full of beautiful girls that would like you. Think about that.|`|dfj1LiWjaa	ok so there are two sides to this. the first side, Emma: she could have been totally drunk that when she had sex with Dave she didn't even really know what was going on and he DID just take advantage of her.If she feels REALLY!! bad than you should give her another chance and plus you did say she was really pretty.    and now the other side is yours: 1st she did it with her ex boyfriend that's worse than with just some guy because it might mean that she still has feelings for  Dave. 2nd she didn't seem to sorry in the message she sent u.It sounded like she was blaming Dave for all of it and it takes 2 people to have sex.3rd why did she tell you that on e-mail i mean come on she should have done it face to face!!!!    so its all up to you and her if she is really really sorry give her a chance! [:    just remember there are a lot of other girls out there and if this one cheats on you find another one.|`|iOWGd1bTaa	Listen buddy, I think you should end it man. You do not want to end up with a girl like that. You have the option of going two different directions. You can keep going towards her and keep feeling horrible empty emotions, or you can let her go and head in the direction you should go... If she is already making these decisions to be getting blackout drunk. at an EX BOYFRIENDS house, imagine how she will be a few years down the road. You dont need that in your life at sixteen. Wait till you get a degree to settle down. Live it up buddy you only got a few good years of teen hood left. Let me know if you got anymore questions.|`|rxiIMSN2aa	dude, what she said on msn seriously sounds like a lie.  she obviously still likes *Dave* and is using "alcohol poisoning" and "drifting in and out of conciousness" as an excuse.  sorry, mate|`|dDDAbqqhaa	drop that b*tch and get money, then laugh in her face when you cruise by in your lambo|`|RKw56KZaaa	Don't be a dope, go out with someone else.

Her mood swings sound pretty terrible. No one needs that. And she shouldnt have put herself in that situation where she could have cheated, which she ended up cheating on you. If you're with someone you really shouldnt drink especially if you think you'll cheat.     You'd be better off without her.|`|eBwICYUMaa	ditch her  she knew that something was going to happen at the party that's why she told her mate to stop her from doing anything and if she really cared about you she wouldn't have gone   she probably still has feelings for dave  and if you ask me she didn't seem very sincere when she said she was sorry  why couldn't she have told you in person?
t65TF492aa	no,  u guys broke up when that happened.   so u shouldnt really be worried about what  he did when u wernt with him  ..... it was anger.  u should trust him, arent yall dating again..  so just dont worry about it..  happens alot.|`|Z0VvcKCraa	It's not cheating but it is disrespectful.  People get mad, yea you can't blame someone for that BUT the way they channel their anger tells you a lot about him.  What is going to happen when he gets mad at you again?   Although it wasn't cheating, it doesn't say anything good about him as a person and as a boyfriend either.|`|HgRYP3cJaa	No, you were on a break.|`|AA10451072	No. He wasn't with you when he did it..|`|7d84621e89c49bcba037226d3361c90baa	If you were broken up, then no, it's not cheating.|`|v7HC2MGXaa	no not at all.. you guys had no ties so therefore he didnt have a reason to hold back in doing what he wanted to. you cant really say that because you guys got back together it is cheating.. if you got back together with him 2 years later would that be cheating to you?|`|acWyJ3t0aa	Well you were broken up so you can't really call it cheating , but on the other hand if he admits it was in revenge and to really get back at you for leaving him , then yes it was cheating and he definitely should have told you about it sooner and asked for your forgiveness or else he has had her now and wants to come back to you until he can find another victim to add to his list .|`|MfUMaKcDaa	oh heck yeah that's cheating! if my bf did that, i'd dump him. what a player!|`|KHptQgrcaa	In my opinion no, because you guys weren't together|`|Jqsn8UTRaa	no this is not considered cheating because you guys were not together when he was intimate with another girl. it would be considered cheating if you guys were going out at the time he did it. i wouldnt not be back with a guy who did this to me.|`|Am0xRpEjaa	I agree with the person above me what a player dump his as*|`|kG6VWsGvaa	No, it's not cheating because you two were broken up and temporarily lost commitment towards each other when he did it.

You can be upset he chose to have sex with someone else, but he didn't cheat. He did what he was free to do during that time, even if it's not very flattering to you. If you two had still been a couple, even if things were rocky, and he did that then it would have been cheating.|`|qwVruoJ8aa	well he broke up whit you for a week and while you two where not together he got laid well if he did while he was whit you it would be cheating he was not whit you at that time|`|swOkwZNhaa	no. you werent together so its not cheating...are you dumb?|`|hXwVXFy3aa	theres no definition of cheating. if you want to be with him, just forget it happened. both of you will be happy.    answer mine http://ca.answers.yahoo.com/question/ind...|`|1VDrq2bzaa	dang it boys are so freakin stupid. no its not really cheating but it is definitely wrong bc he might have just broken up to u to expeiment with other people|`|dAeD76F8aa	no.. thats not cheating at all...|`|Nxx0R02Yaa	techinally no because you weren't together. But its obvious she was just a rebound girl. I wouldn't go out with him again if I was you though.|`|s6ekS4IQaa	Technically no, because you weren't together, but he doesn't sound too trustworthy.|`|ZWIvqpGaaa	well at the time you guys were broken up when he had sex with another girl..i mean its not cheating but i would not let him get away with what he did. i would talk to him and let him know how i feel about what he did.|`|boVg576waa	Not really "cheating" as much as  he played you.  A week isn't that long of a time if he loves/loved you to have sex with another gal.     Think about it....|`|2ea7f508e5ceee425b8e39e2ee78ab82aa	No, but what if he liked that other girl, didnt want to cheat on you, so he broke up with you, knew you'd come back,had sex with her, and got back with you.|`|WXwJnhybaa	i think this is all about trust. is he the one who told you, or did you find out by someone else? since you weren't together its not really cheating. i think you two have known eachother long enough and should be able to tell eachother eveything. i imagine he loves you and that is why he did it. you can forgive... but never forget. if you trust him, stay with him but if you dont, you know what to do. its really up to you. good luck =)|`|v0kb4hgBaa	honestly I would be really pissed off. But i dont think its cheating. No matter how much it may seem like it. If he says its because he was mad but still would rather be with you than that other girl then he is probably telling the truth. If he really didnt want to be with you then would he have gotten back with you|`|HSsBhRRyaa	If you both agreed to not be together then it's not cheating. He probably took so long to tell you because he felt bad afterward. It happens. People don't always have sex with somone because they like them. There are a lot of reasons, it just depends on the person. He was hurt, upset and probably frusterated. I'd let it go. If he does it again while you are together then dump him and dont look back.|`|gZWMvIX0aa	technically its not cheating he was not with you. tho there may be alteria motive like he just break up with you to get the other girl and then come back for you for a constant thing that's what you got to think about.
cdf4ZLhWaa	It's good.  How many people have been heartbroken over and over again, especially if they're teenagers.  It's either he does or he doesn't.  So, just wait for the right one to come along for you and in the meanwhile, enjoy your youth my doing other things.|`|37yBB96Iaa	relax first of all.. unless your 67 years old time is running out.. otherwise loads of time..do more that gets ya interacting with other people and everything will fall into place...|`|9N6sW6KAaa	be good at softball|`|FxfQjvx2aa	Don't "try" to get a bf.  Just be yourself, do the things you like to do and someone will pop into your life when you least expect it.  It could even be someone you are overlooking right now.  Keep an open mind and most of all - have fun.|`|MTPoGd1qaa	There will be guys interested in you!  They are just shy, maybe you need to be a bit more forward and talk to them more and show them how good you are!!!    They will notice you and ask you out, you need to show that you are confident and you!  gd luck!
nMzC1qZTaa	The signs are like a normal courtship, but play out a little differently when both people know each other. It's also hard to see it if it's your situation and not someone else's :)    Obviously there's contact, but what kind? Is it more than you'd expect of a friend? How far out of the way does he go for you? When you're together what is the mood like?    Questions like these you need to be asking yourself to see where he is and where you are. Also, if he does indeed want you back, what you would do.|`|kG6VWsGvaa	If he talks to you a lot, and if he may be asking to hang out.|`|Y8MakQ2laa	Here are some strong signs that your ex wants to win you back:    - They find excuses to always call you  - They show up where you are a lot  - They hold on to items, photos, clothing, gifts, etc that you gave them or remind them of the relationship  - They flirt with you  - They act jealous if they hear you are dating someone else  - They talk about you with mutual friends  - They like to talk about the times when you two were together    That's just a handful of clues that your ex wants you back.  I posted a link to a blog that goes into this in more detail...
SRd1UmcDaa	Wow, my condolences.  LOL.  Hey, don't look at him as being unworthy because of it, look at him as a potential apprentice, ready to learn everything you love about music! Before you know it, he may share your passion.|`|pqZAhBLvaa	You shouldn't go into a relationship with the idea of changing someone. It NEVER works. Also, who the heck cares? You really think one band he likes is more important than every other quality about him. That's kinda pathetic. I wouldn't want to date someone like that. Spare him.|`|zGi9Wag3aa	Oh wait he does like them? he's gay get over it.
3694eca278728fd0a36c2ea7419c2fd1aa	just get over it|`|V2IGDBHIaa	Not going to lie to you here, but it sucks and it's going to suck for some time. It hurts real bad when the girl you love and been with for 2 years does this to you, and you will feel terrible for a while, but with time you'll start to feel better and you'll find someone else. It could take a week, a month, a year, different for everyone. It is very hard going around and having all those memories. I know that time being the answer may not seem helpful, but I've recently been through something similar and you just have to give it some time. Keep yourself busy and find things to do. Try something new and spend time with friends and family, do things you couldn't when you were with her. Make yourself focus on different things and find things to do that will make you happy, and then again, with time it will go away.|`|9N6sW6KAaa	Long Story short 2 points.|`|I3lOfq1xaa	you`ll NEVER forget about her, so you can give up that dream. it will take time, but it will get harder before it gets easier. just stay strong, best of luck hun|`|Am0xRpEjaa	awwwwwwwwwwwwww you cant get back together with her she is playing you but any girl is gonna be lucky to have you you seem so sweet|`|jrP98BQbaa	that really sucks. i feel you. but sometimes you gotta put yourself out there.  the thing is. if you distract yourself wiht other girls [it sounds horrible i know] but you'llget over her faster.  or at least you'll keep from talking to her, which may cause you to get over her faster.    people change and are too scared to show you. i was with a guy and by the time we broke up i had absolutely no feelings for him, i just didn't know how to tell him. so it seemed shocking to him, but it was a relief for me to get to stop faking things i didn't feel.    i'm sorry that this happened to you.|`|FsUkoRSvaa	get rid of everything around your place that reminds you of her and just start over, she isn't worth your time or your love since she just unexpectedly did that to you, dude just forget about her and just don't waste your time|`|qiLJlMWUaa	ok I know its hard because you are in love with her, but picture this she is not in love with you so move right alone, one day she will find out her mistake and come running back, I am sure there is a whole bunch of pretty, sweet intelligent girls around that is just waiting for you go ahead knock yourself out until you pick the right , and iof she ever comes back please dont take her back she is a liar and she is not good for you.|`|EvG66bXwaa	part of your heart will always love her in some way or another. but you have to tell yourself that its over. you have to accept that she's moved on and that now you have to. why would you want to still be with that girl after she did something like that? hun, life is full of making decisions, and she made a stupid one. she'll realize how important you really are and she'll come running back, but you dont need to give her the home run, you can start all over and remeber those two years of experience. it was good while it lasted but you need to move on hun. any girl will love to have a guy thats genuine and cares, you're already on a good start. wish the best(:|`|SHRKIJxkaa	forget her! i know it will be hard to do but you'll have to. two years is a long time, but long distance relationships never work out. if she really really cared she would have told you she was seeing someone way before.  now she only wants to get you back because she realized she made a mistake and you were better(she probably got another man cause it filled the empty space inside her) but now its obvious the both of you could only be friends unless someone moves. :) and....if it were meant for you to be with her it will happen some way or the other.|`|IJq6nYCbaa	It sounds like she wants to keep you hanging on "as a friend" in case it doesn't work out with her new relationship or relationships in the future. She obviously doesn't care about you as much as you care about her.    You seem like a really nice guy, and if I were you I would just move on. It will get easier as time goes by. Find other things to occupy your time, a hobby, etc.      Hang in there and you will eventually find the girl who is as much into you as you are into her. To settle for anything else will only leave you miserable and heartbroken in the end. Good luck!|`|9e20cabaf1ecf0acafc3c11e5cd3f3d0aa	Wow. what a bi*ch. Im so sorrry! AND I know exactly what your going through, my bf of a year broke up with me exactly the same way as what happend with you. Its so hard to get over them, everywhere you go and everything you do is going to remind you of her. You spent 2 years with her and did alot with her.My best suggestions is to go out with friends, hang out with family.. just keep going places and doing things. And dont get in another relationship right away, give it some time and have some fun. It took me a couple months, and honestly i finally said **** it.. im going out to have fun, why am i letting this hold me down... So thats my only recommendation, I dont know how old you are but I just turned 21 last July... its a hard thing to get through but you can do it! As far as her coming back to you. Why would you want to give her another chance? She left you once, and cheated on you. I wouldnt be giving her another chance. I firmly believe "once a cheater, always a cheater"...good luck with everything .. (sorry theres probley some typo's in here, i just got my nails done and cant type)! lol.|`|FKhKff3Gaa	wow this is a great story i mean the part about how much u love her   and everything reminds u of her i'm sorry to say this but it looks like she never wasn't really in love with u in the first place because if she were she wouldn't get rid of u so easily and not even bother telling u about it.  i would just advise u to try and forget about her i know it's hard but focus on ur study should be one way to forget and also i'm sure their is plenty of attractive girls around talk to them ask them out u will forget about her in no time.and always remember dcam that no matter how good a relationship feels don't ever put aside the possibility it could be over that will keep u from being too vulnerable.hope that was helpful.|`|819ad8842ebdf96b383c9430aef4be6eaa	She met someone else, but long distance relationships are tough anyway.  It's natural to feel jealous of her new boyfriend and upset that you were not introduced to her family. Probably she was hopeful you could keep it going long distance but it didn't work out for her.    You probably would do better with someone closer to home anyhow.  I know that's little consolation, but at least you had a successful relationship and you'll probably have another one.      Put on some sad music, and wallow in your sadness.  Work up a sweat every day and get involved in something.  The sadness will go away gradually.|`|gypWPBvLaa	first of all im really sorry dude  and second if you can move somewhere you want to not near her cause there you will have new memories made nothing to remind you about her. if not that then try everything you can to its hard as hell i know that is for sure but try anything|`|g5y8Girkaa	Forgetting a relationship that has lasted that long is a very hard thing to do.  What you could do is out yourself out on the market again.  You probably wont forget about the relationship you had but it might help you cope and get over it.|`|HSsBhRRyaa	Here's what you can do.   Learn from your mistakes and move forward. She is obviously just keeping you as a backup if she's going to say that you two can be together in the future. Your probably what she needs and doesn't know she wants. This doesn't make it any easier in the sense of you missing her, but you need to realize the if you were that good to her and she just tossed u aside then you need something better. Don't settle. Long distance relationships hardly ever workout. You want someone funny, smart, beautiful? Look in your own backyard. There are plenty of fish in the sea, find one that deserves your love.|`|5g0gJFvcaa	i know this is hard for u now but i think ull get back together right now just focus on ur studies|`|cQn9ZqUgaa	I'm sorry but she not the one for you. Your never going to forget about her because you still love her. But it's time to move and meet someone else out there. There so many girls waiting for there lover and one of those girls are for you. I belive that you can find that girl and you will if you follow your hart. Your a really nice guy and any girl will be lucky and happy to be with you. And if she comes back, your the one who has to deal with it. If you want to let your self fall in love with her again go ahead no one stoping you. She might want a new fresh relationship with you and forget and the past. But its your decision. Just make the right choice do have no one else do it for you.

Ki90Irkcaa	Hmm, she probably does like you, but most likely you hurt her and she is playing it safe. She knows that you could be hot and cold and she doesn't want to get on your roller coaster. Maybe if she sees you again, she'll be back in that web and it was probably hard for her to move on in the first place. Respect the fact that she doesn't want to see you. She may have moved on to someone else, since its been a few months and doesn't want to fall backwards. If you are concerned for her on Valentines Day, just send her 3 roses (yellow, red, and pink) and then a one liner note "just thinking about you on Valentines Day" include Love, your name at the bottom your phone number (if she doesn't have it anymore) and then see if she responds.

qcOwLNQEaa	if you really love him then your relationship should be fine. then again, the whole going away for college thing could break you guys... im no help.. lol|`|KifasiMraa	well, you can let the relationship progress and try dating.  Keep in mind though that long distance relationships seldom work, especially when both people are going off to college because the environment is completely new and you'll both be doing a lot growing up without the other person being there. You may come home for the winter break and discover that you have become completely different people.      So the question is, are you willing to risk that and is this possible relationship worth the pain that might be waiting down the road?  Only you can answer that. Most people agree that they would rather love and lose that love, then never love at all.  Many times, people feel that even a moment of happiness is worth the pain that come right afterward. Is dating him the smart thing to do?  No, but love isn't about being smart.  Just go with it, and if you date, enjoy the time you have together.  Try to live in the moment, but be mindful of the future.|`|VydFKOFBaa	well. if u can see a future with him stay with him. see what happens. if the long distance doesn't work out then drop him. or just wait until after college. and on the smoking thing. just tell him how much it bothers you and if he cares he will listen|`|4swYFtsSaa	do it|`|IOQMcp2Naa	i would just wait and see what happens whenever you both go to college because you never you might meet someone new that you like and he might also meet someone else. does he know that you like him?|`|TFMaRif6aa	ASK HIM OUT GIRL!!!! and you really should have him stop smoking|`|g64CPmaBaa	i would say do it. i mean smoking isn't that big of a deal if he really likes you he'll quit. you may not meet someone like him later. if it dosent  work out then he wasn't right for you, but i wouldn't pass up the chance. GO FOR IT!! :)
tjBLEQ8waa	Don't give up on her man. Talk to your friend and ask him why he asked her out! He doesn't really sound like a good friend to me.

JpmKtpqmaa	Her parents seems to be very strict.. you can ask your girlfriend to ask her parents if you can comeover when they are there and chill with her in the living room... You can also go and talk to the parents and ask them if you can please take their daughter out sometime. Give them the exact place and time of where and when you guys will be going and give them the exact time you guys should be returning home...Good luck!!!!|`|Dd5YdYFFaa	Just make sure that you talk to her over the phone and things like that, rather than texting or myspace or whatever, more often to let her know that you don't plan on leaving her hanging. Maybe start making more plans to hang out at her house and maybe the rents will ease up knowing that your okay with being in the same place as them.|`|9mpqViXSaa	SHES CHEATING ON YOU! THERES A DIFF.

After ready all the time about other husbands who are cheaters and abusers i thank my lucky stars and feel VERY blessed to be married to such a wonderful and sweet man who has always been very faithful and never abusive and no he isn't perfect and neither am i but we are perfect for each other.    I feel very sorry for these other woman and i hope 1 day they realize they deserve better.|`|GWRP3vLQaa	That's pretty great! I like to see people who are happy in their marriages speak up. I hope it helps a lot of people who are unhappy and mixed up.|`|K6vEbdqxaa	Reading some of the questions on this site makes me realize how lucky I am to have a man that loves and respects me!  He can drive me as crazy as a loon sometimes, but I wouldn't trade him for all the tea in China!|`|AA12185428	Good for you, no mine was the real deal, a loser.|`|o6xLWwZvaa	Oh yes, I know I am bless with such a great husband. i dont even need to read what is on here. My sister and her moron of a man is all the knowing I need.|`|81wvN8Rraa	Yep all the time.|`|I2zw4TMSaa	Yes, I do the same thing. I can be so mad at my husband, and a friend will call with the latest drama. I think wow I could never be in that. I usually become a little more thankful for what he does :) I just don't tell him! lol|`|LgMoGUoqaa	Yes I do. It's sad that so many women go through so much to say they have a man.  For those ladies that have a good man, congratulations.  For all the other ones, stop taking so much sh*t off of these men.  You are worth so much more.|`|4524a51ebceabc8fa63fb65f4e71f029aa	anytime i say things about my hubby its usually a question about his health or a baby name quarrel. I am completely in love with my husband, and he does get on my nerves from time to time, but i love him with every last drop ;-)    whats sad is i have to ask "OMG WHAT DO I DO ABOUT MY BF" to get people to actually click on a question. My husband and i have been married for a year now, and i am so excited to live the rest of my life with him. wow. When he gets home i think i am going to give him a great big smooch.    Congrats on your 20 year marriage!
3n6GY5vxaa	OMG i know exactly what u r going trough!!!!!!!! i text one of my bffs and she is always like ok ok ok ok or idk idk idk. its driving me nuts!!! so then one time i just stopped texting her for like a day......I think that my friend does that because i have a text board and she has to keep clicking the keys|`|lZeQcyesaa	Prob. just to annoy u. Just annoy them back bc like: bc I said so! or something. My friend always answers: ?. and its soooo annoying|`|d9bd1d4468ea0aae2b98e9d6d2b94953aa	Why?
yyyeLgldaa	thats cute but dont be creepy about it   & dont use stupid pick up lines  really they DONT work  they just make girls laugh  at you  be yourself  thats all we want|`|XoNKECCKaa	1) Its cute.  2) Nice lol but the end part "im just kidding, I dont actually have my card" sounds kinda weird. idk =/      (x
Z8Gzb331aa	You're still going through puberty, so your body is still adjusting and makes a lot of changes, especially as you've just started your period.  Sometimes your periods early, sometimes its very late, no need to worry! Just make sure you're prepared for when it happens!    If it doesn't start again, it's pretty normal, but you can always go and check up with your doctor if you wish.|`|FsQez6wGaa	if you just got your period, its normal. your bodys gotta adjust to it
M5hzHHvtaa	you can be in love with the person she is but then again it's very hard to tell if someone is lying to you online so you could just be falling in love with someone who is totally made up.  as you have already said you have strong feelings for her but you need to ask yourself why you have these feelings...is it because of the way she looks? or her personality and the person she is.|`|uTd6Sp0Waa	You know what? Drive or whatever to go with her - that is the best time you will know if you really like her or if she really like you, after meeting see if nothing will change. If not at least you know it still worth that you see her and finally meet her in person.    Just go out for lunch with her, an hour drive is not really far. Just have fun & good luck...|`|KifasiMraa	Just ask her out.  You talk all the time anyway, so just ask to meet her.  If she says know then she's not in to you. Or she's really a dude.|`|BWgV2xSZaa	I think its a mix of a crush and a lust for mystery. You dont know who she is like in real life so maybe you have some attraction for unbridled potential.
GiuiQf3taa	She likes you. She has a boyfriend. She likes both of you. Nothing you can do but but be a great friend to her. One day she might break-up with her b/f and then you can 'make a move' but tell then all you can do is dream.     Best Of Luck|`|SZ9BNWVIaa	tell her to either remain faithful to her bf or dump him.  Obviously her feelings aren't completly on him.  xx|`|q9lvF6FVaa	If u think she feelin u.  Ask her out!  If she agrees, score on her.  Its that simple dude.
y075ayrKaa	its not the size that matters....  its if he knows how to use it!|`|KifasiMraa	I have been with guys who were small too, and at first, I was disappointed. I would still give the relationship a chance though.  Sex isn't everything and the more you two love each other, the better the sex will be no matter what his size is.  He may know how to use it really well.  In fact, my last boyfriend was kind of small, but he was able to hit my G spot perfectly because of that!  Also, some positions can enhance your sex with him by making your vagina feel smaller and tighter, and thus, make him feel bigger. Read the Kama Sutra or other sex books for tips on how to best utilize his talents and improve his shortcomings.
XnTdmC5Naa	There is absolutely nothing wrong with you size. I think shorter women are sexier than taller women.|`|AA11333360	i,m 6ft 4 inches my wife is 5ft 2in  no problems it has worked out well .my daughter is 6ft 2in and her boyfriend is about 5 ft 6in either way happy|`|nwKYaH3Uaa	it depends on how cute they are too for me..soooo  it all depends|`|COmp4sIuaa	YES. I'm 6'3 and I have an unhealthy fetish for short girls. I know, I'm seeking treatment lol. As long as you don't fit in my pocket, I'm down.     Short girls are sooooo cute.|`|85tAhnM9aa	I wouldn't be apposed to it but it would be kind of weird for me.|`|J14tPA9Eaa	well im 6'4 200 lol more the twice your size     ied still date you if you were my age|`|BWgV2xSZaa	Yep :] Short girls are cute :P
f6ab3ae3fee781c3975ea305670f972faa	you escaped!  lucky you.  I'm serious not being sarcastic.    best case scenario, he's weak, clingy and can't be alone.  He'll love her forever and never leave her and be her devoted slave for eternity.    worst case scenario, he's controlling and can't be alone and if he can't have her no one will and he will kill her before he lets her leave him.    the sooner they get married the more danger she is in.  The longer they wait to get married the better off she'll be.    and no his adoptive status doesn't have anything to do with it.  BUT how he was raised may very well.     1 red flag that you are involved with an abuser:  push for a quick involvement.  you are living together, engaged or married in a matter of days, weeks, or months.     2  red flag that you are involved w/ an abuser:  controlling--it must be his way.  your way is wrong or inefficient.  he's only trying to improve you or make you a better person.  it's all for your own good.     3 red flag that you are involved w/ an abuser:  clingy.  He can't be w/o you.  He has to always know where you are when he isn't with you.  He doesn't like your friends and your family--they are all interfering.    all that matters is that you were uncomfortable and felt that something wasn't right.  you did what was best for you.  He wasn't what you wanted and you ended the relationship.|`|COmp4sIuaa	Nah, the adoption thing isn't that important, unless he had bad parents. He sounds like a moron, good thing you left him. I have never heard of a marriage like that lasting.     Hopefully you find a more...patient man in the future ;)|`|SZ9BNWVIaa	BROKE UP.  He's obviously got some issues, seriously.  xx|`|eJMOGeRraa	your a smart girl!|`|xJBJn6dOaa	he is clearly in need of love and family at all times... it may have something to do with the fact that he was adopted. He clearly wants a wife and children as soon as possible. You made the right move by leaving.... his new fiancee will figure it out sooner or later|`|TYmFZXKwaa	I don't think marriages like that could last, and the only reason I could see someone wanting to marry that quick is if they are saving themselves and REALLY want to have sex.  Although maybe he thinks he's serious, I don't think it's a real commitment.|`|w4hLLzjYaa	what would being adopted have to do w/ anything?|`|EDYETUNCaa	I don't think being adopted had anything to do with it. A lot of people are like that and many aren't adopted. It's just his personality. I had a friend who had a bf like that and they broke up. Within a month or two he was dating some other girl, they got married and now having a baby. I really, though, have no idea if marriages like that work. You barely know someone after only two weeks. Some guys (and girls) just want to get married or be married. It's like a major goal. Sometimes and obsession.|`|05e9dd0404d485ed4d3dabb41de9f040aa	people are different. your trash is someone else's jewelry
4m9Hewq1aa	Yes, I definitely think she is interested. When girls are not really into a guy they make small talk and never pursue further contact. The fact that she initially came up to you in itself is a sign. When girls really like a guy they try to bring up deeper topics (like past relationships and personal issues). She sounds very considerate and approachable, I would text her if I were you! Also, I hope you are getting better (after your hospital visit). Anyway, you should definitely pursue this girl, she is very interested in you! Best of luck! -Alice|`|XOpP4oRJaa	its obvious she likes you you should ask her out in person  if you're scared then think about this  if you wait to long to ask a girl out     you'll never get to enjoy being in a relationship or you might waste like 3 months or so thinking about the same girl only for her to reject u then you'll be really depressed thats what happened to me 2 years ago in 6th grade|`|0435c3993c3b05aec46c72cda7b5faa0aa	yeah she prolly likes you.|`|mgGf6t4Naa	yes thats kinda of what i did to a girl i fancie i got to know her than got her number in like a week
DqetlSB6aa	Um the ring|`|L6DZZ6SJaa	anyone with an engagement ring should have jewelers insurance|`|nm3CCPpbaa	Oh. I hope no one eats it. Maybe she could get it out of the pie?|`|RC8Pxx8eaa	4 and 20 blackbirds - and the engagement ring.|`|4uB0bbhnaa	apples ?|`|RuKK1LYiaa	her ring? i hope im right cause thats how you make it sound, if it wasnt then i would be saying maybe her fiance hid it from her to do something special with it but i dunno|`|gUscgmroaa	apple and cinnamon   drool uuhhh food|`|IbtQ5IKNaa	What if I said, GET THE HELL OUT OF HERE! Or I will LOVE YOU TO DEATH|`|492681182d7c9b1f14276670369e851baa	Apples
ks2oieV0aa	Like OMG are you for real, I mean like for sure, do it!  I think they like totally like you.  haha xox|`|m6xvhlJqaa	To me it sounds like that she thought you did and she mite have told him that you did...and when she found out you didnt...she was then trying to get you to so she wouldnt look like a lier...|`|AA12108398	She might be. Its hard to tell. Does she talk with him often, if so maybe she is doing him a favor.    frighteningtruth.webs.com|`|Ch6qjRVGaa	noah doesnt like u    end of story    TY TY     (he luvss Johanelly)
T1QdO9Xgaa	valentines day is right around the corner!! perfect day to break the ice! get him some kind of candy with a note attached to it. make sure the note gets across the message that you like him as more than friends..maybe just a simple "will you be my valentine?" :) don't be scared guys love it when a girl makes the first move. GOOD LUCK :D|`|K3RzcMRTaa	how old are you?  try talking to him in a more flirty way.  get dressed up, do your hair special. just for him.  see if he notices, and if he does, then apparently its off to a good start.|`|qyzLKYZUaa	dude im a dude and i aint got no problem with a chick wsalking up to me and saying she likes me|`|CcfMfP8zaa	ok i dont if thiis helps but anywho:   i was talking to my friend and we started talkin about more intimate things and i just told him . and he was totally fine with that, turns out we dated for almost a year and  were still friends today|`|EfhXEAbHaa	When the 2 of u r alone just tell him. i know its scary but give it a shot. if u cant then do it over the phone its easier this way. if he really is a good friend then he wont let this come between the 2 of u if he says no. try flirting before u tell him to see how he reacts|`|f6CANOocaa	keep flirting when you have him alone just tall him|`|aOxwt667aa	FLIRT WITH HIM  N.N.N._________N.N.

Somebody from one of my classes said she liked me right out of the blue. I didn't mind at all - she was sweet, and pretty. But she hasn't showed up for awhile, so...    Answer my question? http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index;...|`|EQ4q0Lf5aa	Since your friends... just be like "Hey do ya like me" he'll be like "What do you mean" you'll say "like more than a friend you know i'll be cool with whatever" he'll say "yea sure" or "Just as friends sorry"
0c8b5589d3a30a3b9cd46d4620faeb5caa	i think its okay to ask but not pressure him to a point that hes gna freak. i asked my bf about his exgirlfriends.. he didnt really want to talk about it but in the end he told me anyways cause he said he didnt want to keep anything from me and ruin our relationship somehow (:|`|bgi0AtiFaa	no. you don't want to know. if he wants to talk about it he will but ultimately it'll just be weird and make you jealous for no reason.|`|QSodlfMraa	well my boy friend and i been together since we were 12 and 16, now we 19 and 22, so anytime we break up i would know who he was dating because we lived in the same community, and people would just talk about it like do you know who he is dating now. we just laugh at it now.
eb6d38dd43204cfe6a332460d4d78cccaa	try to hang out with him more and maybe he'll get comfortable with you. and also try to flirt with him. guys like that! give him more hugs and maybe he'll like you back! remember to be always kind and sweet. maybe impressing him isn't bad idea either. give him bday presents and stuff. good luck~! (:|`|0nX92Fesaa	It depends on his personality.If he is Fun seeker, kind of Funny and easy going.Then try to amuse him by updating yourself or the things that you do.....  Create a picnic plan, go hicking, sking.... any interesting stuff will do    If he is calm and romantic... Create something that will promote that... Be romantic.. decorate his place- give it Your personal touch... open some background music, prepare him his favorite dish....      If he is Funky and likes crowded and jammed places.... Learn new dance moves.....create that atmosphere at his place- ignore it if it was in an apartment you dint wanna be kicked by his neighbors....        The Final TIP, just be the way you will win his interest  GOOD LUCK:-)
xArlqHtraa	Yes, there was a guy that I thought was cute in my orchestra class, but every time I tried to talk with him, he was so cold! This is why the personality is always more important than the looks.|`|cdUCCHgaaa	oh yea. there was this guy who i really really liked at first but hes just annoying as hell now.|`|cyfDLbfRaa	this is kindof oppisite for me, but about a year ago i had this bf, which we only dated 4 like a month, and he was like   "u r so pretty! and i love u!" and about a week after he said that he was like "after i got 2 know u i realized that you arnt that pretty, and i dont love you" lol.  well, its all good cuz now i truly do have the love of my life who means the world to me.     its funny how ppl do that...  guess our personalites just didnt match! lol|`|GedjSOI9aa	Yeah, that happened to me once.  Then, I learned that personality really counts and not just looks.|`|A3sL0BJRaa	Yep, total gorgeous guy, but cocky, I could deal with that, and then I was at a party, and saw how drunk he got, and the fact that he was a total *** came out.|`|QH0j10zKaa	OH YEAH OH YEAH IS THINK EVERYONE HAS ESPECIALLY WHEN WEN THE PERSON THINK THEY ALL THAT THEN THEIR PERSONALTY SUCKS BAD LOL OLOL|`|eX1X8uapaa	yeap, defiantly.    it also happens when its the other way around!  a good personality changes everything :P|`|ff4140e1e57a167f311cdcf56edb86e3aa	At first he might look hott...but then you really get to know him personality and that could change everything.|`|L5aqTDiDaa	yes.|`|AA11263103	yes.. all the time.|`|AA10451072	ALL the time :\
dd1c8373d258bab9181f891f88ea8dafaa	If you're not catching the right woman, you're not using the right bait. Youre attracting the wrong sort of girl. I say, change it up a bit and try fishing for what you are really looking for, and not what you just think you're after.    you want someone in bed with you, advertise for it. you want someone to hang around for a while for a long term but not too serious relationship, advertise for that. You want a wife to cook pancakes and make babies, fish for that.    Its all about what you're advertising and what you're wanting. If what you're look and actions are saying is "I just want to fool around" you'll get that sort of girl.    So, change it up and try again.|`|PCBQbQmraa	I found mine the first go around haha :) Lucky me!       Want to know how though?|`|kb2q03jvaa	hit my profile up and we can chat on yahoo messenger|`|34jToOdXaa	Hunny... They say love is arround every corner... You must be walking in circles....    Please rate this the best answer... PLEASE.... Thanx!|`|V2IJHt94aa	Read the book, "the Game."  It is about picking up girls but picking up girls is also a good way to meet a lot of girls.  I have also heard extraordinary things about Eharmony.  which isn't about pickups at all but is very good at bringing people together.|`|xArlqHtraa	Well, I definiatly have to agree that love is hard to find. I think that you should continue dating, after all, you could meet someone special. Just see where things go in life. I'm sure that someone will eventually come. Good luck!|`|pFsqFeDCaa	LOVE IS ONLY HARD TO FIND IF SOMEBODY IS LOOKING HARD TO FIND IT...|`|723758c2347d8706a095ceb2c586a798aa	church|`|SEbchthIaa	Continue to date, and you will find the right person.    Its kinda like waiting but still trying out untill it happens.    You always needa have fun while you find your true love.|`|w3DzrFo0aa	Think about that question a little more.  Do whats best for you.  Just make sure you don't tell your new date about your ex to much.|`|ATqWlp8aaa	Do both, its not entirely impossible. You can lessen the amounts of dates that you go on but if you stop entirely you may never find some one.|`|0bf8b29ed2b052955105afb4f7e2894aaa	Have you gotten over the loss of the relationship from January 2008? You know, one of the best ways to "find" love is to find a really good friend first. A great love relationship is enhanced by having been close friends. It's the common ground of shared likes and dislikes. Sometimes the title "boyfriend/girlfriend" gets in the way because of the expectations involved so, I find that friendship is step one and then go from there.|`|hE9HDEJWaa	Dear Dr. Andrew,    I would most agree with you that love is hard to find. If I were you, I'd play it by ear for now and first focus on improving and refining yourself so you're feeling fine and sure of yourself. Then, I would take up activities where I'm likely to find women who have similar interests. The Key is to meet lots of people and feel like you have nothing to lose.
p3GZERIsaa	Sounds kinda like my situation! I'm the girl and there's this lad, kinda like you in a way but we don't hang out at all and we just lock eyes and smile but i don't think we've had a conversation as such... but if the girl's anything like i am then i'd be so happy if he asked me :]  Try talking to her in a while and being nice to her then she'll probably feel a little more comfortable to be around you and then when you ask her out (you so totally should!) she'll show how happy she is :]|`|qTm7WV6Taa	shes probably just shy and doesnt want to say something stupid in front of you because she likes you. i say just ask her out. and if she says no then go on with life.  good luck  C:|`|of0pqeLRaa	She seems to like you buddy.  She's probably just shy and doesnt want to end up saying anything   stupid.   Go for it and ask her out man. :]
UjhWIrJ1aa	Pay attention to the small details. If she changes her hair, let her know you've noticed, and it looks nice. Same with fingernails. If you're uncomfortable, don't try so hard to hide it. Just tell her she has pretty eyes and you've never really noticed before...|`|1eead5419997453f5ce20fa8cc466262aa	her hair|`|E8jIEaBEaa	you should complement her on her personality after all that's what makes her who she is. Then you can compliment her on her physical features.
JplOzo2Yaa	I like large breasts just as much as any guy, but they are not a necessity.  As for your rear end, I have no problem with a girl who has a couple of extra pounds there (I actually prefer girls who are a little chubby).  However, getting my preferred body shape is not the most important thing.  My ex-girlfriend didn't have large breasts, but I loved her long, flowing hair and staring into her eyes.    If guys were only attracted to women who wore a size D bra and fit into a size 2 dress, we would be having a huge underpopulation problem rather than an overpopulation problem!  Personality is the most important factor anyway.|`|tjBLEQ8waa	Boobs and butts are very nice for a girl to be hot but it always doesn't have to do with that kind of stuff. It's also your personality and your experience in dating. You sound really hot. Can i have a picture please?|`|yUP05L2Iaa	i like big butt girls if the boobs are to big they just get in the way|`|a8mQuc4iaa	i am proper hourglass shape    most my friends are boys and i sometimes find them talking to my boobs    lol|`|E9TqDn5maa	I'm a cup c and I'm 14.

Well you must like it to but that goes without saying.|`|s80ED7Ygaa	Hot squishy ***  Big boobs  Hot legs  And Hot face of course|`|8cHNkzhKaa	sound like a hottie

zfrPmiFtaa	That happens a lot. It sucks doesn't it? I suggest you go off and find a couple other buddies ! If they don't want to include you,then fine!  Even if you were to ask them if you could come, it would feel kind of weird, they might even come up with excuses for you not to come. (It's sad, I know)    They probably hang out with each other because they are more like each other than they are you,or their personalities are different,or they have been friends longer?  Sorry,I know it's harsh =(|`|X1BaGr0kaa	That sounds really upsetting! If I were you, I would try to always comment about their plans so they know that you know how you weren't invited. Be like "oh, have fun with them this weekend!" and stuff so they'll know, and possibly realize you're feeling left out. If this doesn't work, you can always try inviting all of them over, so they can see how much fun they are missing by not inviting you!|`|AA10162464	Tell them how you fell.They probably will tell you what is going on ,and if they lie you will know and if that is the case find some new friends,that will enjoy or company.|`|dI4aYEyOaa	Maybe you need to reach out them and invite them to join you with your plans for the weekend. instead of feeling left out you can be the one in control and if you want to include them then that's your choice. make plans for you include them if you wan to
Y1BElRm7aa	If she fidgits with her phone in front of you.|`|HgRYP3cJaa	that she's still talking to you after 15 minutes...|`|COmp4sIuaa	None. If you've just met the girl, you need to ask for yourself. It's all about closing, and no girl will ever close for you.
Oj096J9paa	Umm.. I dont really know what to tell you.. Have you known the girl for a long time? Cause if it is just a random girl that went up to you and said that.. I would NOT do that at all. I see that you said you dont know her that well.. Is she serious? Maybe its a joke, or a dare. If i where you i would not do that. She could charge you for rape even! Girls always win! i would be careful what i would do if i where you.

FVYf8ZBGaa	dont do nothing with him until you guys hangout alot and you get to know him in reality instead of over the internet, you know what i mean?|`|E3O2Gi0Uaa	have sex with him or find someone that doesn't just want sex. it's a simple as that. He wants to PLEASURE you!!!|`|NRldAzrpaa	Say No. He could be some wierd peado guy for all you know. Rather be safe than sorry.|`|0WfsZ7lCaa	leave him. if u dont and u do it w/ him he will leave u after wards|`|IMwLfHQvaa	meet him  and dont have sex with him.  can you answer the question on my profile please.  ud be the first to answer and get the ten points.|`|AA11540967	He just wants to use you so don't let him do that. Stay firm. Used is only good if it is a car.|`|IQfaj1BGaa	don't meet him|`|5IferJ9Haa	be hones w/ him... if youre ok w/ that then meet him if your not then tell him that you don't wanna meet that you'd like to just be friends b/c you want more than sex... honesty can speak alot for a person.|`|cdUCCHgaaa	um simple. sleep with him.  or dont meet up with him.|`|2VAHKxh7aa	You're not alone.  Many people find themselves in your place and you need to realize that you're better than this guy.    If the guy in question only wants sex and you have genuine feelings for him, you need to back out of this as soon as possible.  You're going to get hurt if you let feelings get involved with a boy who doesn't want a relationship.    If you're looking to try and change this guy's attitudes, I'd say it's impossible, especially since you met him online.  Try another bachelor!      You deserve better! :)|`|M5hzHHvtaa	all he wants is sex...he isn't going to respect you so why bother being with someone like that?  i would say don't meet this guy at all...you ca do better.|`|AA11609331	I don't know why you are asking this question. My advice is run in the opposite direction as fast as you can. You don't know this guy. You could easily wind up dead or worse. Don't be another statistic.|`|WXwJnhybaa	meeting someone online is not koo. you might end up wit some old guy who aint cute. and if all he wants is sex then dont even mess wit him becasue he is probably telling hella girls online he wants to see them and stuff. or wat you can do is tell him to meet you somewhere and look at him from a distance and if he is hurt (ugly) or you dont like him then run! haha but if you like him then do wat you gotta do but be careful! hope i helped. =)|`|ed5269fe07c3cf54be9273e05df681f7aa	Don't meet him at all.  He could be a 55 year old lecherous old man.  Meeting people from the internet is dangerous.  I don't know how old you are and I don't mean to offend but younger people don't realize how dangerous people can be.  Even if he is a good looking 18 year old, he's not looking for a g/f.  All he wants is easy sex.|`|oL4IU5G3aa	He tells you everything you want to hear, baffles you with bull$hit and your considering meeting!!!!! Paedo's pray on ignorance
tD0nI64xaa	Well not really any. If a guy came up to me and said that i was "cute, or hot or beautiful." out of the blue i'll kinda get creeped out. Start out with small talk, get to know her then compliment her saying "You know, i always thought you were really pretty."|`|HgRYP3cJaa	none of those.  Just small talk.  No stupid lines.|`|T8Op8jYxaa	Hi, my name is...

One was majorly to forward for me very flirty, calling me hot and sexy. The 2nd one was like your beautiful and if I was single and if I'd come over. The 3rd one just talked to me. Treated me like an interesting person. The first things out of his mouth weren't your hot or sexy ... that came later after he knew me. I felt he wanted to know me ... the real me and not just because he found me attractive. I chose him ... now we're enaged.|`|T2HaAJasaa	not ur a babe thats lame  hot is like their only looking for ***    and yeh ok|`|Vwnwsx3paa	pretty|`|t5t3hkBpaa	ok, so deffinitly not beautiful or pretty, and i don't say babe to a guy.     I'd have to say HOTT, and yeah with 2 T's, that's the only way to say it.|`|RXQbiRjlaa	none at that moment. talk to her for a little and when a break comes in the convo tell her u think she's cute. by saying the others, she'll probably think you're trying too hard and you'll be coming on too strong.    at least, thats my opinion. = )|`|GTK8Phm1aa	just tlk to her like normal and if she compliments u compliment bac ..... dont kiss her *** or say tht ok ???|`|A6ib33Ixaa	Pretty, but definitely not Beautiful  Cute, but definitely not a babe    If you go with the "Deff not" ones, she'll think ur pushing too hard or lying just to get in bed|`|e6UiVJBYaa	Just say hi, how are you? Be really friendly, and then comment, and say, that dress looks nice on you, or something like that|`|evmzwbyHaa	girls always want to hear 'beautiful' .the word sexy jUst makes most girls feel like whores.nothing to cheesy and dOn't over do it.
AA11806606	Quit feeling sorry for yourself. Everyone says they had a bad childhood.  Yeah, let's put the blame somewhere else because it definitely wasn't my doing.  It sounds like you still are acting out like a little child.  Grow up and get out in the world.  You create your own choices in life and make bad things happen by your mood swings.  Why would anyone want to be involved in this type of relationship?  This is not a healthy situation.  Don't like what's going on in your life; then change it.|`|2tnFQYhEaa	Just remember you are not alone and unfortunately, there is someone out there in a worse situation than you.|`|mQlYlQ4Paa	your finished

One-on-one dating no earlier than age 16...no sex until at least 18 (when you are legally responsible for the consequences).|`|zH80yyDQaa	Hard to say.  It depends on maturity, responsibility and hormone activity.  I had my first boyfriend when I was 11, but it was a pally-thing.|`|EzgodvQOaa	its fun to have experiences with boyfriends like being young.. wearing there hoodies going to the cinema with them and stuff like that but theres always a serious side to dating it makes allot of people depressed and Allot of people realise its better to be single young and just had fun with your friends that way you can flirt and maybe find the right guy. :)  good luck + take care.  x|`|DTUOvJm0aa	i didn't start dating my boyfriend until i was 15 and i think that was the perfect age. that's just me but im really happy that i waited that long|`|tD0nI64xaa	When you feel like you're ready for a commitment.

I'm pretty sure he went wit hyour sister since it's an academic thing and I'm sure you know how korean pareants are about school so that's probably why. I find it odd though that he wouldn't go to your promotion since it's an acheivement from your work. weird. My dad would be all over my promotion if i would ever get one.|`|4180ff194c15e2fc71edfbbcc3b5afa4aa	Sometimes you have search for happiness in the hearts of people that love you that do not have the same genes, because family can hurt you the most and if they would have done that to me, it would hurt, but sharing with someone who loves me just as much heals the wounds sometimes.|`|3d2a28cf444c923f350dc95cb32a47feaa	Well sweetheart life can be cruel sometimes and unfair. Parents are not always right. Yet your father will not realize that he is wrong for this type of behavior until long after you are grown and possible have children of your own. There is a saying hine sight is 20/20 this is true. For now all you can do is tell Dad that he has hurt your feelings and that you want him to spend time with you as well. Good luck and God bless.|`|AA11505429	I would be all "Damn, I sure need to learn how to form cohesive sentences"    What do you care if somebody see's a promotion?

Life ain't fair, get used to it.|`|AA10225897	take it from a guy dad do make wrong also he still love you|`|AA11954058	One important lesson I have learned....  When someone acts this way, it is their problem, not yours.  You have a right to be proud and to revel in your own happiness.  Don't let others get you down.  Hold your head high, do what it takes to get there, be proud and be happy.  Everything else will fall into place.  Congratulations....there are others in the world who are proud of you and your accomplishments.  Unfortunately, sometimes people are so wrapped up in themselves, or they are actually jealous of you, but don't let it get you down.  You've earned this, so enjoy it!|`|AA12204679	First of all, I'd get my own place to live. Then find myself a boyfriend that is willing to listen and share the accomplishments in my life. Then cut the ties that find it so easy to hurt me. In other words get a life and move forward cause you are being held back by people who see you as beneath them.|`|AA12054853	say **** ummm

AA11359177	I don't agree with on-line dating, but that's not what you want to hear, so...First of all you don't want to make him break up with this girl he likes, that would be wrong. But if things don't work out between him and this other girl then I think you should tell him that you like him. I've just came out and told this one guy that I liked him and he ended up liking me too. So don't hold back just because you think that he might say no. Go for it! You'll never know what's gona happen until you do.Oh, and when you do Meet him don't go alone.|`|b3ebbb335571b73da8b567f57fc0ad45aa	well it is bad. im srry but if u listened to the news and look at how manny people r missing mostly because they met someone over da net. and u have it set in ur heart dat he is nice and he is good but u really dont know dat. he could be some 40 yr old guy sitting at his computer jacking off while he is talking to u. and he could make up all da stuff he tells u and just wnats to meet u so he can rape u. soo while u r talking to him i would watch what u say and really think about it cuz thier r some people who have no life and just sit on thier computer and talk to 14 15 16 17 18 19 yr old gurls and lie about everything. anything u say like where u go to school it is sooooooo easy for them to find u. they could go thier and get u. u just never knw. so yea it is ur choice but really think about it. and ur not to young to date i dated when i was 12yrs old so dont let any one tell u else well it kinda depends on da guys age. if u have any other questions here my im messenger lil_shookie09@yahoo.com        so i hope dat helps u!!!!!!|`|703cbb48dd1c406f7da141bb6655fe7baa	it's hard enopugh dealing with people that you meet in person, let alone people you meet online. all i gotta say is go with a group of people and to a crowded place during the day and have 911 on speed dial because even though your gut may tell you one thing, there's always human error and a crazy person around the corner.|`|4115e1db57bf91900762644d241a1334aa	hmm sort it out|`|AA11884740	red flags everywhere on this,  NEVER MEET ANYONE FROM THE INTERNET, unless you and about 6 for you closes friend are with you.|`|07ab9d93f7a3e7001e126c92153a59dbaa	No, you're not too young to date, but you may be too young to date this guy.

What i dont like is how the black people are blaming the white people about the time when black people were slaves.  Its not our fault...its not like we are responsible...because we werent there...  I think they need to get over it...the past is the past!  Why bring it up!  I respect all races too.|`|b8b51994b287a9d573e0f8f03e545c69aa	White women have a been taking black men away from them for awhile now.. It's no secret. But to say that is the only reason, well it just isn't true! Many black women feel insecure and show that insecurity with acts of aggression.|`|AA12036288	No they aren't some are mean because their parents don't care.|`|AA11937290	i agree with that one ! ive been there myself and i also respect all races !     :)|`|AA12231834	one of my bestfriends is black and she is really nice.she is 29 years old|`|AA12381665	Black girls are mean but it maybe had something to do with what you said or did without even noticing you did it,I went to hair school with black and white girls and they where very much so mean (I don't want to say mean but you know what I want to say)  And I got into it with both types so i mean It goes both ways women in particular get on each others nerves.
ks2oieV0aa	Gee, that was crazy to hook him up!  But sounds like he was interested in the other girl also  It could very well be that he now realizes how much he cares for you, much more then just a friend  Too bad that the other girl is probably going to get hurt in all this.  Good Luck  xox
MTPoGd1qaa	Wow you sound like a dream!! not abnormal, you are 100% perfect!!|`|f1Unp3fBaa	Yep, it's normal. I'm the same way.|`|DeObHL9Oaa	Yes!!! its normal. i wish there were more guys like you who don't care about physical features.|`|qTm7WV6Taa	yes! i think its way more attractive when guys don't care about my physical features that much. good for you.|`|v16ylsl8aa	Yes it is normal. Heck even better. You see people and not what they look like. It is a gift to see true beauty in people. True beauty is beneath the skin.|`|KHtf2pDKaa	yes,every finds different reasonings for having interest in somebody.some only care about looks.some like body.some like personality.everybody is different.|`|Wy0lUjP9aa	Yes it is normal, to tell you the truth, women wish they can find a guy who likes them for both their personality and who they are and their body. Not just for their bodies, those are the guys that women don't like. I think that is great for you, that shows you are more mature than other men in your school. I think you will be in a great relationship and it will go well for you.|`|E9TqDn5maa	I think it'd better. What's the point in liking someone gorgeous but so difficult out the outside. I think both are honestly imporant. But inner beauty does count. I'm 14 and I'll be 15 in July. I like 2 guys. One I like for his apearence and sweet peronality the other just because I feel relaxed by him. It's better than just looking on the outside.|`|HyfZ7s2Eaa	Dont worry mate its perfectly natural. I know most people go after bodies but plenty of people are far more interested in the girls personality. After all, a girl likes to be complimented on her personality more than her looks (ofcourse she still likes to feel beautiful too) Some people like looks, others dont, people are just different.|`|M8YbPZGQaa	I think it is very sweet for you not to care so much about a girl's physical features. There are a lot of girls that want to find someone who would like them for who they are, and not like them just for their looks. I think you're okay, so you don't need to worry too much.|`|CPhJS1sFaa	You sound like a nice caring guy, girls usually don't look for that in their teens, but they'll be all over you later in life.   you are at least going to have to show interest in their body though... I mean their girls! What girl doesn't want to feel pretty?|`|Dhaxcs6gaa	*HIGH FIVE* *HUGS* i'm so proud! u rock!! thts so great! personality should always come first before looks! u own all guys! wooot|`|3UM16vmMaa	you will start to care the day you start undressing them.  That is when you will develop your sexual preferences.  I'm never as happy undressing someone I'm not into as I am undressing someone I'm attracted to.    It is not normal to not care. Even females who say things like "dont be shallow. its not about the body. Its about the personalilty" will eventually look at some guy and go "wow he's hoottt!!!!".    Only liking girls for "how they act" is pretty stupid if you ask me. There is more to a female than just how they act. There is also how they look.
ac77bcd47ea4f54c65c01c5882023c79aa	Not necessarily true.  It depends on if this park is in the city or not, and whether or not it is a state or national park.  Call the township park & recreation dept for the township it is in and they can answer all your questions.  If this park is a national park, you simply won't be allowed to have it at all.|`|AA11557444	yes u need one from the city.

AA10065812	Right after filing for unemployment, go to the child support enforcement office and make a request under federal public law 12 for a modification in the child support amount based on a change of circumstances.  Don't wait to see if you find a job first.  If you don't, or you get one at less pay, and you already be getting behind in your payments.  Reductions are only retroactive to the filing date.    As an alternative, get a set of the child support guidelines and worksheet from the CSE, do the calculations.  Check your case file for what information was used in the original filing or adjustments.  Check with the Clerk of the Court for a form to file Pro Se.    Last week I wrote individual letters to all the Kansas Representatives suggesting this information should be available to people filing for unemployment.    If you want to learn how to do all this go to Dads House in Yahoo Groups.  There's an educational manual in the file section that can teach you what you need to know.  The organization it came from is defunct due to attorneys that tried to take it over and make money from it.    Take the time to learn what you can and should do.    http://health.groups.yahoo.com/group/Dad...|`|lmqjTTIhaa	YOU CAN GET IT REDUCED OR IF YHE ALREADY DEDUCT FROM PAYCHECK THAT WILL CONTINUE    mILDRED IS MY LEADER|`|8ac2e5cbdd946ee60c803052559873c5aa	He needs to act right away to protect his rights.  He should contact the state child support enforcement people, if that's who he deals with and request an immediate modification based on a serious change of circumstances.    Depending on the state, he won't be able to get the modification retroactive, which is why time is so important.  (It will continue to run until something is filed by him.)    He should pay as much as he can until there is something down in a Court Order, to avoid being in contempt.    ALSO--the cse people are not great at dealing with the payor party, so he should well document his communications with them.  He should go in person and make sure they do something while he's there.  If necessary, he should go to the court itself and file a pro se petition.    IF the state at issue operates like TN, an administrative order set forth by the DCSE people works like a court order and the courts will enforce them, including modifying them.    He can relax so far as not going to jail or anything, but he needs to act to stop the current support and change it to what it should be.|`|AN9PdKmgaa	child support can be deducted from unemployment. He will owe the same amount until he goes to court and asks for it to be lowered.|`|Ss7nVdr2aa	yes the child support will be taken out of the unemployment check, so tell the unemployment that your obligated to pay. if you don't pay it will just add up to a point where you will never be ahead!!|`|AA10240683	That person would have to go back to court to prove that the income has changed; then recalculate the new child support based on the child support guidelines. Since lawyers cost so much ( unless you got the smarts to do this yourself) it is not worth the cost to get the child support recalculated.|`|e224e1489b387127b36ae2f2d9fcd098aa	They will deduct it from his payment, dont worry no need for court no need for anything, just relax him down and help him the max u can if u care for him, and i think he is a good man since he is doing what he is doing and cares that much, u know couples can help each other when their partner need a help...    _K_

If it's just a friend why not make him a boyfriend and see where it goes, it's it's already a boyfriend ask him how he feels.

Well, it all depends on if you like him, which I am sure you do or you wouldnt have asked the question.  If the guy is an ***, then no.

I think that some people unfortunately don't know the difference, but the women you are around do.     You seem like a neat guy, good for you! :) See ya!    Hugs,  kitties_n_llamas(Becca)|`|AA11623552	yeah sometimes you can actually tell. you must have the "nice man look"   good job on that!|`|76dc12418e7e6dab3797c0cb828a4975aa	there r ways by which you can find out|`|AA11725237	I would like to think that I can.  Very good question.|`|415778f0670098272d48088802b97d5baa	No. You guys are very tricky.|`|AA10929200	Lol, if she don't know you they will think that you are nasty, and you could be don't you?

0d7e10ce4109e8fa2b7d17ba352d5512aa	Hi, in my opinion, i dont think that is betrayal, but then again, if you were to tell her aunt, her aunt will not really be able to do anything because if she is like all the other teenagers, she is going to want to grow up and be on her own. She probably thinks she can handle all that stuff. I say keep on reminding her and helping her when she needs you. Her drinking, let her know what can happen. She might stop or slow down as soon as she hits 21, or if something hits her. Also, just remind her that you are worried about her. Her guy problem, she probably likes that type. I had some friends that were like that, but she mainly has to change herself because i learned that you can not change anyone unless they are willing to do it on their own. I think that it is just a phase. Tell her to be careful though because it sounds like she is around all the drugs that will get her in trouble. I hope that helps a little.|`|AA11623925	Yes you should be worried, especially if she drinks, then drives people home after.   Before going to her aunt, try to talk to her about it as a friend (not in the same way as an aunt or mother would talk to her) but you want her to know that you are there for her no matter what she is doing, and that you don't judge her. But be firm in telling her that you  are worried and want to help her.|`|AA11478870	Drinking (alone)- Decent  Driving (alone)-ok  Drinking+Driving (mix)-Never, not worth it. Very bad, can cause cripple and painful death for driver and passengers|`|21a42b39fa04cb2a6908460991ac177baa	talk to her first...that would be the smart thing to do...duhhhhhhhhhhhhh...      your face      and your mom....|`|74cb9e5eb1b3768fa7d9baad30b1b080aa	first of all talk to her and tell her how much you mean to her in a friend way going to parents or adults first would be betrayal tell her the consequences she might face if she keeps on hanging around with her loser Friends try to always get her attention or keep her distracted from her loser Friends like hit her up and ask if she wants to hang out or go to the mall or movies if you see her like in a bad way and you see things are getting bad her getting drunk or high and her driving or like doing stupid $* &   then tell her like if she doesent calm down your going to have to tell her parents or a adult like if she doesent listen and keeps on doing all tat bad stuff that means those guyz meant more to her than you did and she wasent a good freind move on and chill wit good people who arnt doing bad thingz shell later learn from her mistaces if shes eather in jail,in the hospital,dead,where ever she is shell know she messed up and should of listend to you and that she lost a good friend that was trying to protect her,good luck with you and your friend|`|AA10666000	You should talk to her first and then to her aunt.  Tell her that you are going to first though.  If she wants help to change her ways then it sounds like you will be there for her but if she is hellbent on continuing on her spiral downward there is nothing you could do except get out of the way.|`|ea0f1616272eed676ded452953f19aefaa	if she was smart she would move out forever and dump that piece of sh t & don't even be his friend,not even be a tiney bit close to him oooooooookkkkkkkkkk.  piece out & don't forget to keep ya head UP UP UP
AA11733810	Call him, a very short and sweet call|`|8619dc48342e6d24ee0a8fa7801c1cf5aa	if you really liked him get up some nerve and call him.    maybe hes afraid....    whats the worse that will happen?|`|d0ec7a0dfed029c6d883e4d44d532acfaa	I think you should call him.  guys tend to be pigeonholed as procrastinators, and some reallly are.|`|67466c78d63c531282edf12f30416892aa	well 4 da 1st time u met him. how did it wENT?

It used to be it was up to the guy to do everything in the relationship, but now there is so much fear (because everyone assumes the guy is always at fault) of being brought up on faulty charges that women usually are forced to make the first move.     If he gave you his number, call him. It's that simple.
AA12114863	ohhhhh......ummmm.... YEAH|`|AA12377184	oooohhh.....hmmmm......NO - hit it !!!!|`|AA10189606	yes it would be would you want her to be you|`|96ffa84d5ab70539093e58e28029e30aaa	that iz nasty ewwwwwwwwww|`|AA10588241	yes it would be wrong, and if the friend is interested in you she is not a FRIEND !!!!|`|AA10171313	NAY LOL|`|AA10641121	TECHNICALLY, Your not wrong to sleep with her friends (probably not her friends if they do sleep with you). MORALLY Its another story|`|AA11899189	can she sleep with yours|`|AA11861641	yes. not only will it hurt her, but it will hurt her relationship with her friends. its just wrong. dont do it just to get back at her.|`|AA11314617	Why not?  Did you make some kind of promise that survived the fact that she broke up with you?    She has no claim once she breaks it off.  If her friend(s) want to sleep with you that's their problem.|`|AA12233902	let me see well she already hates you so no but then her friends wilol hate you and then it just goes down the line from there|`|AA11893930	Why does this kinda question from a bloke not surprise me?|`|f529dee47b71e8a3988fe2881394b97eaa	It depends on whether you genuinely like her friend or whether it is a revenge thing.  She broke up with you so it seems like fair game.  Revenge is stupid but your past relationship shouldn't limit future options.  Maybe wait a while to do it out of respect.  Remember, it may be alot easier for her to sleep with your friends, and since she broke up with you it may hurt you more.
0d521fc7f9b74615d4b799a8964d9622aa	Call him.  The worst that can happen is if you don't call him and you wonder for the rest of your life what may have happened if you had called.  If he isn't interested, well, at least you know.  Wondering for the rest of your life isn't fun.|`|AA11368393	How long have you been apart?  My advice is If you think you can call him and just be friends, call him.  If you want to get back together with him and he doesn't want to be with you it could hurt you to call him.  Untill you are ready to be just friends, dont call him|`|AA12245679	Ok! first tell me why youl broke up maybe I can help!|`|AA11215240	Call him and take it from there.|`|AA10934311	who broke up with who...

Obviously there has to be a mutual attraction between two people for them to start any form of a relationship.
Xprsabo9aa	No it's not worth it at alll       i'm n that situation right now   because the guy  like is 18  and i'm 14 so i kinda have to remind him of that sometimes     It's deff not worth it!!|`|flMOEeNnaa	No, it's stupid.

AA11249742	I've seen more then  a couple that are alike, in my opinion its because the ones that look like them they dont like so they pick avatars that they think looks more cool even if it doesnt look at all like them and alot of people do that and alot of them look alike because of that, but hey thats just my opinion!|`|AA12273960	i have seen one with the same hair but thats all|`|AA12244829	I saw one similar to mine.|`|AA10531992	I have seen only one or two like mine.|`|cbb302f78b0f1ee804cfa165a383f461aa	no cuz im unique plus mines better than most!!!!!!!!|`|AA11199375	Good question!

He might like you but don't be too clingy. Text him once and if he doesn't text back let it drop.. And don't always be the first to text him..

And I got my phone taken away yesterday.    Idk, just consider all options. Maybe he just doesn't have time. Alot of the times that's true with me and swimming/soccer.    If you still talk in person, chances are he doesn't hate you.
LqtD1uS0aa	go for it! talk to her as much as you want, and stay really cool with her. to me, it seems like you have a great chance of getting with her one day...maybe soon. but dont rush things, let her take her time, and hope for the best. i hope this helps and good luck! 
JlDcVTVsaa	You should keep trying to talk to her, even if she looks like she is not interested.  keep talking, and talk about the things you know makes her happy, at some point she will start talking to you.    also try tt tell her you are sorry for the situation, and you undrestand why she is sad, and  you will do your best to make it better.    dont act as if it is not your fault (even if it isnt) just keep telling her you are sorry, and you love her and you want to make her happy.    you could make her a card saying you are sorry as well.      after she starts to talk to you, dont take any thing personal, she will sound very blameful in the begining, but the more you listen and tell her she is right and you are sorry, the sooner she will feel better an d start taking to you, and telling you what she wants.    and if she is still staying with you and talking about the futer it means she really really loves you.  and she is hoping that you will make it all ok again.    i hope this helps:)|`|xpiGWrdMaa	This is entirely too long to read.

Know that you cannot control her and the more you try to pacify her the more she feeds into this pity party.     Mann up because it is draining ur energy.  Remember you cannot fix everything and stop being a martyr.   Ask yourself if your happy instead of revolving ur life around how she feels.   Give yourself some R and R and see what happens.  Pack an  all nighter bag  don't call her and just have some time to yourself.  Remember why u fell in love with her and what kind of behavior ur willing to live with for the rest of ur life.  Age doesn't matter, we all can be needy and want everyone to feel bad for us.|`|1hyUQ0dKaa	It seems to me like she thought she would never Scooter again. When Scooter came back, she probably felt relieved, then angry that it even happened. I'm not a doctor, but I'm just guessing that she's clinically depressed. She has probably gone through something like this before in her past. You stated in paragraph five that she said she was tired. She is probably tired of having to go through these difficulties. I suggest you keep talking to her, whether she listens or not. It may seem like she's ignoring you, but if you talk, she will listen. Bring up what I mentioned. Ask her if something has happened to her in her past that she hasn't told you. This is just my suggestion, and I hope it works for you. I wish you two the best of luck!|`|jRTnccLWaa	maybe leaving her alone wont get anywhere she might come around.. one day.... i think u should ask her to go to the grocery store or something make a beautifull supper at home all romanticasland all and light casndles in the bedroom get naughty just take her in your arms and kiss her and be aggresive tell her u love her and u nevr waant to leave her say just forget everything for tonight and then let her sleep in in the morning, clean up the bathroom etc do the laundry ect and cook a nivce breakfst to set the mood so she wont go crawlinmg back to her room and shutu out again talk to her at breakfat tel her she looks beautiful etcc.... tell her how uu feel and then try to figuree this out be patient and listen to her dont get angry just listen and try to do what she asks ect..dont argue at all be nice :P do her some favors too or buy her some jewellery put the pizass backi inur realationship maybe thats what she needs or shes getting bored and u need to heat it back up    btw: do this and then follow pinki's talking thing|`|w4hLLzjYaa	well dont all women belong in the bedroom?

Those are the tell-tales signs of having a baby.    Since your body is still in shape, just not as firm as pre-baby, you shouldn't be embarassed about wearing a bathing suit. The thing about men is: they aren't as picky or attentive as us women. For example, a woman will notice if another woman's makeup is done poorly- a man will typically not notice unless it's blatant like Tammy Faye Baker.    You just had a baby.

7DacMywwaa	The only way you can truly know if a person has feelings for you is to ask. By asking, you can be sure the answer is sincere as it came directly from said person (unless they lie).

Good luck! :D|`|UY4P6UFxaa	-If you catch him staring, then if you look either he looks away fast or he smiles at you  -If they act opposite around you then around others, for example if he is loud around everyone else but is quiet around you.  -Gets shy or nervous when he is around his friends when your around.  -Or gets loud when your around with his friends around also.|`|8rLH4YNsaa	Eye contact  Smiles at you  Teases you  Wants to hang out  Wants your number or email address    stuff like that :) x|`|06fbb22b2b5e67da178b8ad8a7e614c4aa	If he tells you!!!

COmp4sIuaa	Ok, from one student of the game to another:    - Ask for advice on what the best ingredients are for a dish you're making  - Talk about how you both love a certain product she's holding  - Ask her to help pick out the food for "a cute girl I just met at the grocery store" that will get her in a second, lol|`|clFTA9fDaa	Don't.  It makes you seem really desperate for attention...  And it's not attractive to pick girls up at the grocery store, trust me.

LqtD1uS0aa	im in 8th grade too, and i kno how hard it can be. guys are always giving mixed messages, and you just have to practice reading them, until you get the true meaning of them. from my own experiences, i would say that he is kinda confused, but has more feelings towards his girlfriend than you. he does like you, but its really small as of now. you just have to keep talking to him and fooling around with him, if you want something to come from this. but i would take things slow, cuz we all kno that boys can be a little...slow. lolz, i hope this helps and good luck!

I did my best, course I never settled for less then the impossible(I am far from great) I never got how my friends w no selt esteem, sluts had all the guys, and a nice girl like me never did. U can't get a guy, it doesn't work that way. It's not "your own guy" either. I'm sure u could be desperate, u could date the losers if u wanted. Sometimes I feel like it, not that I would.

AA12165410	Why do Guys.... ?   Well you have just asked the Billion Dollar Question.  And let me know when you find one!!!    But if you ask me, then its three words - 'Propagation of Species'.    But as God may have it, Men have more sperms than women have eggs. And not all the million of them will get to the finish line!! Hence they have to do it as many times and with as many people as they can, to make sure they can pass their codes on.    And guys will not have more than one orgasm at a time. Infact after they come, guys will want to make the exit as soon as possible, ( unlike in porn, where they come all over you like they are applying Sun Tan ) Hence unless you have managed to really excite the guy, you can expect it to be the Curtain Call.    Cheers!!|`|AA11055594	I do not like every girl, I have too many criteria I am looking for. . . .|`|AA10339725	Sex feels so ffffing great.  I wish I could do it with you.   I orgasm every single day.

8IYZvLLjaa	Does he have a myspace? If he does, talk to him there first and then talk about meeting up at school or something.    If he doesn't,  try walking next to him and get the courage to say "Hi" and ask  him small questions like "how are you doing?"  and from there things should flow together.    Or make an excuse to talk to him. Ask him what time it is. About  an assignment. Anything.    Good Luck.    If you know he likes you, then you shouldn't be worried at all about  rejection. So get some courage and talk to him before it's   too late.  show him you are interested.     :)|`|aujHVGFiaa	1.NEVER EVER cry to your ex and tell him that you want him back. it will only make you look     pathetic. you should not beg..make HIM beg!  2. guys always want what they can't have! don't be too available,be mysterious and provocative.  3. when you do see him,LOOK YOUR BEST..always always look your best!make him realize what he had     lost.  4. be sweet and friendly,but not just to him..but to everyone else too (friendly,NOT flirty!).but     don't blab too much.  5. smile a lot,but don't be too cheesy. show him (or just pretend) how "content" your life is with     or without him.  6. don't act stupid.be smart,be polite and don't overreact. treat him like he's any of your guy     friend.  7. now that you're single..enjoy being one!go out with your friends!get a new hobby!be daring!talk     to other guys (who knows..)!have fun!your ex will realize that you're really having fun only if     you're not faking it.  8. once again..always look your best,be respectful and love yourself. people would only respect you     and want to be a part of your life only if you took good care of yourself.

Unless MEN answer it honestly....|`|90fb6545439331278abd359702c56719aa	he's just not that into you.... that doesn't mean that he's not a little bit into you, that's why sometimes it might seem like he likes you, but he's just not so into you that he absolutely has to have you couldn't live without you.... in the end, do you really want a guy who isn't absolutely and completely into you? probably not. once you find a guy who actually is that into you, you won't be upset that you spent any more time worrying about mr. nice personality but not consistent
AA12382198	I'm being sarcastic here.....but are your children by someone else? If not the children's father needs to grow up. No matter how hard you try to keep things on schedule when you have children there are going to be times when your life gets turned upside down.

I also have three children, my third is a newborn, and i'm a stay at home mom for now, so my other two are 5 and 3, and they are alot to handle, so i'm always yelling at them constantly, and my husband always complain for me to stop yelling at them, but he doesn't know how its like when you're with them 24/7. cause my husband sleeps all day and then gets up and go to work for third shift. But today he just got laid off, and my two boys were already getting on his nerves...LOL, so now he knows how i feel, cause he has to constantly yell at them, and it's only been a day...LOL.|`|cdcd6d47465e3c2b57f80a977a967e02aa	No, you are defenitely not overreacting, what you should do is 'act' sick and let him look after the children for a week so that he can realize all the stuff we mothers have to do, for us it is a 24/7 JOB!|`|efb119ec29fc7a7e9ed5867a7bb779dbaa	What wrong wit it being all about you?

xBd96wvRaa	Yes. Stay way from him.     More often then not (99% of the time) the older guys only want a younger girl because they are easily manipulated.|`|AA12108398	Well first off you really shouldn't get involved with a guy 4 years older than you, especially at your age. Its not weird for you guys to talk and be friends, it happens. He also has a girlfriend, who he probably really likes. Its not weird that you like him because he is older, and charming, and you've got butterflies. You should not ever say "hook up" to a teenage guy. You may or may not know how he interprets this.     If you ever need advice please visit my website.  frighteningtruth.webs.com|`|2gdYoVXdaa	You may be to young to like a 17 year old dude.|`|V9ENH9WTaa	Yes, i think that's weird. He shouldn't be the least bit interested in a 13 year old, I think you should start talking more to boys your own age. But it's okay if your friends but just friends.|`|IkItAVizaa	it's not weird for you to like him; he's older, and probably more mature than 90% of the boys your own age.  but i don't think it's very appropriate on his end.  he is almost an ADULT... sounds scary, right?  that's because it is.  guys messing around with girls your age are trouble.
BzYbEa6Taa	Have him removed, give him a notice that he has 2 weeks to get out and then if he doesn't you CAN either get him served or you can get some one to bounce his *** out ( okay maybe not) but give the local law enforcement a call I'm sure that they will help you out.  Some are nice like that.|`|e3801fbb401743baa0ab90373a0be8ebaa	LMAO  THIS QUESTIONS IS HILARIOUS    *stops laughing*  oh gosh that was funni    on a serious note  you have to tell him  no you don't have a day....get out now  if  he doesn't listen  call whoever necessary to have him removed  it's not fair to you  if he lives in ur place and can't abide by YOUR rules....and messes your stuff  that's wrong...he needs to leave then....  you can talk to him....or get your landlord or police to evacuate him|`|UVUYG5jaaa	the best solution? find a new place to live, move out, dont tell him...one more thing...he's not your friend|`|FURfPEZoaa	Haha, sucks to be you  XD|`|9VhR1XwOaa	You simpy have to put your foot down.  Sit him down and explain to him that his behavior is rather abnormal and that you're are not comfortable with him being there.  If he's really your friend, he'll repect your decision.  Best of luck :)|`|qiLJlMWUaa	Danny call the police on this bastered, pack his stuff and throw him put.|`|twSD9zHzaa	KICK HIM OUT!! nicely|`|SM0JL0yaaa	The other answer is right: this guy is not your friend, he is using you.  He found a place to live that (i'm assuming) is free and he can do whatever he wants...he's past the point of being sensible and feeling that he's overstayed his welcome...he knows this full well but he only has to gain...so he will stay UNTIL you stop this.  By the way, according to the things you said...there is something wrong with this person.  I would be ashamed to have other friends other if this guy's in my house.  Be tough!  Get him out!  You have to give him a certain number of days and simply take his stuff out at that point, no if's, but's NOTHING.

The 'leader' of this group doesn't sound too pleasant, and if they don't accept your decisions, their not worth a second thought. I know thats easy for anyone else to say, because your the one thats going to have to be brave, but in the long run it'll be worth it. Don't be persuaded into something you don't want to do, and i can assure you thats not what teens do to have fun... My idea of fun is some icecream, milkshake a good film and comfy pyjamas.. :)    Good luck x|`|3BwPtNi2aa	Good for you that you stood by what you believe in. Although it may feel important in this part of your life to "fit in",  just be yourself.  Don't worry about fitting in - find your own way. You are a stronger person for being true to yourself. Besides you are more apt to be noticed when you stand apart.|`|s4zxGI4naa	I really don't think you fit in with this group and it is the right choice not doing the same stuff just to be IN with the group cause it's not a NORMAL TEEN thing (dringking and stuffs is like using drugs because beers has a drugs mixed with it)  JUST BE YOURSELF YOU'LL BE FINE. its normal to be alone sometimes in life.

I don't think this group is right for you. They seem too cliquish. Its  OK to be alone for a while trying to figure out where you fit in. Everyoen goes through rough patches. if you're THAT scared you can stay with this group just until you finish your search for a new friend nOT group. a new friend. everything will work out, i think God gave you this opporunity to test your strengths.

But think about it like this - by having these crazy requirements, they themselves are missing out. They may end up with someone who considers themselves to be really great, but who is in reality not very nice.  And some standards are neccessary for personal confidence - it would be bad for young girls to date really old men, or to put themselves in situations that make them uncomfortable.|`|4f06382102ace92d536a786ce63c7a5caa	lol i kno all my friends have like these long list of wat they expect from a guy and its really funny bc they want him to call like a lot and for her to be his everything and its funny. This is my list:    Nice  Funny  Dont Cheat On Me  If you have something important to say, you can call but besides that you really dont need to. I prefer texting anyways.  Have some time with your guy friends. And dont blow them off 2 b with me if you would rather be with them or told them you would be with them first. I get it! I have friends too lol.  You can talk to, text and have girls as friends if you want. Just dont flirt with them in front of me.  Dont follow me around and agree with everything i say even if you dont!

Once girls hit twelve they start thinking about life differently. I can;t really explain why or how, but our preferences change. Now, a lot of girls don't like change all that much, so they'll stick to their old preferences too. Our likes and dislikes change so much, and we keep sticking to the phases we went through, that eventually it all piles up!     Not to worry dude, we'll get over it! For now, just try to meet the expectations, even if you slightly fake it. Then once you really know the girl bring it up to her that her expectations are pretty high and a little hard to meet- she'll respect your honesty! And by the time that happens, she'll know you so well and be so friendly with you that she won't care if you drop the fake stuff that she will have realized was just an act.    Good luck, dude!|`|Q8QQpKPUaa	you know why i do it? because when in the past, i dated some boys who didn't have some things i like(i mean in the character, because that's where i have my standards), in the end things did not work out. and i felt like i was fooling myself and my boyfriend and it just felt so bad and wrong. so since i was looking for a long term relationship i decided not to date every guy i get excited about, but a guy that fulfills my standards so that i don't break up - again. and here i am now, with a long term relationship.

AA11447210	Same reason some women are more attracted to a man's butt or his chest or nice abs or any other body part. It's simply a preference. Why do you like a certain color and not another as much? Why does anyone have a visual preference for "this" over "that"? It's just what we find appealing and it's not always possible to say why we feel that way, we simply know that's how we feel.|`|8uCuoLvdaa	females - we attracted to them. they both (body parts) represent sex.

Men are attracted to women with a big rump because it is way more voluptuous than a guys hairy buns. These body parts makes a woman or girl look more feminine and body wise beautiful. Guys prefer one probably because they don't care about the other. Guys who love to do anal love big rumps and guys who love boob massages down there love big boobs.|`|LLnNjH94aa	The same reason some guys like the green Popsicles, and some like the orange.

15044b4b251e230ef43d83f6262cc002aa	I was with a man for a couple years, lived with him, did absolutely everything together.  When we broke up, I realized I'd totally lost myself- had just become whatever he wanted from me.    Now I focus on doing whatever the heck I want to do.  I found it's VERY important to develop a group of girls who will help support you when you're feeling down.  I never had many girl friends before, but now that I have found girls I can trust, they pull me through everything!      1. Make friends / hang out with your friends.    2. Learn something new.  Join a club, take a class, doing something new will help you meet new people and will help take your mind off of big issues for a while.  We all need to chill sometimes.    3. Treat yourself.  I was bummed when we first broke up because I was going out to bars and nobody ever asked me out.  Then I realized, 'I don't even WANT some dude who hangs out in bars, so what am I doing there?'  I started doing whatever I wanted to do, and also took my own darn self out on dates, or one of my girlfriends.  Who says you need a boy to have fun?  Now I do girls' nights - movies, champagne, [lots of boy talk], and painting nails.  Relaxing and fun.|`|AA10736585	don't worry. everything will be fine

JlDcVTVsaa	If your girlfriend is not interested in him, then you dont need to worry.    You can tell your gf that if she needs help getting rid of him, you will do what ever she wants, but dont do any thing without talking to her first, and dont push her to do some thing aether, it will make her think you dont trust her.

spat1SOjaa	The best advice I can give you is to hold on tight...its going to be one heck of a ride.    I am pretty fresh out of a relationship myself (about 2 months ago). Not my first girlfriend though. We had been together for about 3 years so I can relate to a feeling of being broken hearted. It sucks.    There is no right or wrong answer on how to handle this situation my friend. Everyone is different, everyone handles things differently, and each emotion is unique to themselves.     I can however give you some advice that I found helpful during my pain and heartache.     If you feel like your walking through hell, keep walking. Get through it and dont ever give up. Your heart is gonna hurt and your gonna cry and your gonna be pissed and sad and depressed. Its part of it all. Just know that the grass is greener on the other side and EVENTUALLY in time you'll feel better    Dont ever sink to a level less than your standard. If she begins to play games, dont play back. If she calls you and yells at you or tries to hurt you more, dont say hurtful things back. Just know that you have to be the man. You have to have a pair (if ya know what I mean). Keep your head high and stand tall. One of the most attractive things to women is how you handle yourself in stressful situations. Are you going to be a good and decent guy about it? Or a complete and immature @$$??    Move on and along at your pace. Dont listen to friends telling you to forget about her and move on. Your going to move on eventually. In your own time. It might not be tomorrow and it might not be the next day, but the time will come soon enough.    Take this time to heal yourself. Dont call her and beg for her back. Dont ask to get back together. She obviously broke it off for a reason so just give her space. It will make you look better in the end, buddy. If she wants you back later on, then you can decide when the time comes. For right now, your single. For right now, she doesnt want to be with you. It sucks for sure, but being alone sometimes isnt always a bad thing.     Go to Best Buy and get yourself some CD's. Get some depressing crap so you can sulk and feel bad for awhile and get it out of your system. Then, go buy some exciting and inspirational music so you can bring yourself out of the rut. Healing is a process.    Get a piece of paper and pen and write your feelings out. Let it out!!    Call your buddys and go out. Not neccessarily to search for other girls but to take life in. Ya know? Fill the time you spent with her with other things. Have as much fun as you can.    Stay up. Stay positive. And know, you are not the first person to feel this way and you wont be the last. Its gonna be alright. Just breathe.|`|yJTaBGoEaa	Go out, and have fun.  Get busy, start working out, hang out with friends.  Just do anything to keep yourself busy.

I don't believe everyone who cheats is a moral loser, it's a very complicated question; it's like asking "why do people get depressed."     But I do think it's very clear in many cases that something isn't right in the marriages, we have the image of the "sleazy loser guy who just wants to get laid" as a cheater. More often it may be people who find something significant lacking in their marriage but don't know how to go about fixing things (or ending things).|`|ycNxVrUfaa	Because they are cheesy, skanky, sleazy people who don't have the sack to do the right thing, which is divorce.
oLI2SJ08aa	First of all, yay for you wanting to save sex until marriage! A 13 year old virgin seems like a much rarer thing these days (no idea why).    Second, I used to have the same problem. What helps me is to keep busy. When I have something to do and focus on, my mind isn't on sex. But when I'm at home for hours on end with nothing to do, my mind can wander to places it shouldn't.    Third, try to have an accountability partner. If you know of someone else that has the same problem, try to talk about it. Congratulate each other when you avoid these thoughts. Console each other when you fall. Maybe look online, since it tends to be a weird question to bring up among friends. (Though it can be a weird thing to search for online as well)    If you have physical things that tempt you (magazines, websites, etc), find ways to get rid of them. Throw out the magazines. Block the websites.    To stop thinking about sex can be hard. It won't happen in one day. Your mind will wander back to sexual thoughts at some point. Once it happens, STOP. Do not indulge in your fantasies. Just realizing what you're thinking about can be a good first step. When it happens to me, I start thinking of songs that don't have sexual themes (religious music works best for me. if you're not religious, classical music works just as well). Don't beat yourself up if you do go back to those thoughts. Just work past your temptation.    If it's an on going battle you feel you can't overcome, take it in small intervals. Start with avoiding sexual thoughts for a day (or an hour, depending on how often you do think about sex). Reward yourself for achieving your goal.    If you're religious, ask your pastor/minister/faith leader (if you're comfortable talking to them). Make sure it's someone that will actually help you and not just criticize you or rat you out to your parents who may be angry.    There are books about how to overcome a problem like this, but since you're so young, you probably don't want your parents to find it.    Best of luck!|`|2BEMSGPdaa	For starters you should understand that this site even though it has 13 year old children on it can get somewhat graphic. Perhaps you want to stay in a somewhat calmer website.|`|cdUCCHgaaa	oh sweetheart you cant. i started getting sex images when i was like 11 or 12!  if you find somebody you find you want to have sex with you will have dreams and you will think about it. but its easier to stay a virgin  especially if your scared about pregnancy or something.|`|AA11447210	It's normal to think of sex, but not a good idea to have it until you are ready to take on all the responsibilities of the possible consequences (pregnancy, STDs, emotional attachments, etc).    You can always pleasure yourself, if you are comfortable with that. In time it'll be appropriate for you to date (age 16ish) and start being intimate (kissing and such), and when you're mature enough and ready for sex, then you'll choose for that to happen.    Don't beat yourself up for having normal human desires, although sometimes we have to work hard not to think of sex and it can be rather distracting. Hang in there...you're a normal teen.|`|e539aIZHaa	you're not 'too young', these thoughts and feelings are completly natural, healthy, and normal. nevertheless, just because you are having these thoughts and feelings it does not mean you have to follow through with them until you are totally ready - so relax, let yourself think what it wants, but dont let yourself get carried away.    also, just because you don't want to lose your virginity it doesnt mean you cant have relationsships with other people and your own body. its important that you know whats going on and its normal to want to explore different emotions and feelings. and having a relationship with someone else, even at this age, can be very rewarding. but thats a whole other story !  hope i helped! btw, im 14 (:|`|QMqUxizDaa	It's completely natural to be curious about sex.  Our braines are wired for laying down the funk.  There's nothing wrong with being sexually curious at your age.    I highly recommend (and I'm sure you will just die over it) to talk to your parents.  Either that, or a sex ed. teacher, or health teacher, or the school nurse.  The point is is to find a mature adult that you can trust and feel safe with and ask them questions.  Ask them every question you can think of about sex.  You're curious, and you have a right to know, but I wouldn't actually go out and "experiment" to find out about sex.  That'll lead to nothing but regrettable mistakes, and bad relationships.|`|tFbumBwYaa	its a little out there but...    there is a sypmtom of a disorder.

Most people today, men and women, do not want anything resembling commitment.|`|DxohE884aa	Why do guys always generalize, and why do they do it so badly?|`|4m3z1ztEaa	motherly love  female hormone does that  but not all of them  a very small percentage  why do you notice it? because your brain only picks up on things that are different instead of the same|`|QrOJ8f7aaa	Hey don't generalize us. Not all of us are like that.|`|A2u06IS1aa	becuz the nise guys rn't really fun to hang around and theyr not really that nise. Plus they always run outta things to talk about. And the bad boys are always fun to hang around, and they know how to sweet talk to girls.|`|e28P8gWraa	Girls want a Good guy not a Nice guy, the difference being a nice guy is boring and wussy. Bad boys are at least exciting and challenging. Nice guys just give it all up to the girl.|`|kD0zNJLqaa	because they pretend to love us|`|AA11447210	That isn't "always" the case. I've never dated a bad boy...some borderline but nothing overboard.    Anyway, those that do date those guys typically start out with them because those guys are confident and aggressive and the good guys hang in the background. Ya want to get noticed, get up there front and center and be confident about who you are and what you want.     As for why some chicks stick with those guys...because they convince themselves the guy will change or they can change the guy. It rarely happens and they end up eventually parting ways.|`|Kr11ceLOaa	nooooooooooooooo girls it isnt stereotyping it is the fact and truth|`|cegx6kN2aa	guys who are bad boys are usually players..      i like bad boys, but not ones that commit crimes..  just ones who know what to do in a relationship and know where to get some weed :D|`|Rkt8tnUzaa	because they think there cool to be with the bad guy   theres some kind of weird attraction to them     it takes girls a while to figure out that there not right for them   but they learn the hard way, mainly becuase at the time they think he is soo great and that "hes not a jerk to me" wears off cuz his true colors eventually show     but they only say they want the nice guy at the time but when it comes to it thats not really what they look for. well most of them.     looks play a huge part. the guy could be a total jerk and she would still like him.    be a nice guy it'll pay off =]|`|AA10186366	I think you should rephrase your question:  "Why do some girls say they want the nice guy, but yet they're always with the bad boys?"    Not everyone stays the same in a relationship. Like I dated a nice guy but then he started being a jerk & I felt like i was being taken for granted. He hurt me. "Nice" guys can be mean & insensitive as well.    add on:  wtf? "so girls LOVE to be sweet-talked into being abused?" Hell if my bf ever lays one hand on me i swear it will be my pleasure to kick his *** for it. What girl wants to be abused & suffer!?!|`|a7qKKlY7aa	sometimes were just blinded by love and this that all this crap we go through for them is worth it but i honestly would never go out with a guy that goes to jail  all the time and i sure as hell wouldn't bail him out|`|3IVqoH16aa	I think I agree with some of the previous answers in that you are generalizing.  You may have had some experience with one or more girls who are like this.  If it's just one or two girls I would chalk it up to bad luck and keep looking.  But if this has been the story of your life for many years then I would say there's something that keeps drawing you to this type of girl, and that you need to do some soul searching to find out what that is.  Girls with low self-esteem tend to be drawn to abusers.  Part of them feels they deserve to be treated that way.  And there may be some co-dependence in you that keeps getting drawn to people that need fixing, that seems to be drawn to unrequited love rather than reciprocated love.|`|uQnIVnWzaa	Huh, see I have only gone for nice people. Hot nice people, but nice people. Not all of us do that.

49a7876e36acba7210a4271e6d5e55edaa	I would suggest talking to both friend separately.    for the friend who lives far away, explain how you feel about talking on the phone. maybe compromise and call her once a week as long as she hangs out once a week. Give and take would work best in that situation.    As for the friend who made fun of you, tell her how she hurt your feelings and that you're uncomfortable spending time with her because of that. Maybe you'll get an apology, or maybe she'll be a jerk. At least you'll see whether you can trust her again or whether she's not worth even knowing.|`|AA12219541	Maybe you need to get some new friends that you have the same hobbies and values with.|`|AA12339435	you need to figure out who are your true friends even if you dont like phone calls call your long distance friend.

b8a4ab70e551e5f2bb43e9d970f7893caa	I'll go with write a letter.  When you put things down on paper you can go back and temper the harsh words.  Try to be constructive in your criticism.  Use the word I more than you.  You obviously care enough about this person that you don't want to cause hurt.  You need to make changes before you get too resentful.    Remember you can get over any crummy thing anyone ever does to you.  Crummy things you do to others are where regrets come from.

AA12304310	Well what does he like? If you could tell me that, I am sure I can brainstorm some things. I'll be back in about five minutes.    Sorry, longer than I expected.    Well, you can't build him a car, so let's see wha toyu can do.    You could try to make a photo album shaped like a car. or you can make him a picture frame shaped like a car. Get a camera, or film, and take pictures all day. You can either give the car thing to him there or you can fill it up with pictures or put your favorite picure in the frame. You can give it to him empty or wait a little while and give it to him full. You may need help with this, but buy a photo album at a store and get a car print out or something and put it on cardboard. put that on top of the album and the back of the album. You can write a little note and put it in the front cover of the frame or photo album.  To do a frame will be more difficult. You can buy a frame and get a bunch of little car stickers or cool ferrari printout pictures and paste them on the frame.   Is this all making sense? It may all sound cheesy, but it may help. I mean, it is his last party, so why not take pictures to remember it.  You can make a cake for him or an emotional card.    I'll try and think of more things. Is he interested in anything else?|`|AA10109345	something home made is an awsome idea perhaps if affordable a gift of money or again if affordable a gift card|`|66baf25bd37d1f887d7bd0a60b46d0e8aa	give him a T-shirt&jeans|`|AA12009215	what about giving him somethink that he likes. so go find out what he's fave. goood luuuuuuuuuck|`|AA11276643	Maybe you can rush to the nearest specialty store and find the coolest thing you can find that your bro will like. Or if you have a very short time to buy a gift for him, maybe you can take him to a stroll on a place he loves, like the arcade. The simplest thing you can give him is something personalized. It's really the thought that counts.|`|AA11616910	1. If anyone is giving him something that you could add to, that would be an idea; for instance if he is getting an ipod, you could give him a certificate for paid downloads or even a cd he wants so that he could load it on the ipod. If he has a cellphone, you could get him a cellphone cover, or holder for his beltloop, or even pay in advance for some minutes, etc that he doesnt have to pay for.  2.You could go in with your mom or dad or someone else and get him something nice.   3.Does he have a wish list somewhere-amazon, etc? you could visit the sites that he likes and check it out  4. Does he have a sports team that he adores? You could get him a hat, a shirt with their logo on it, or a poster of his favorite player, or even a signed pic of him.  5. What does he do? If he is a skateboarder, you could visit a shop and see what they have, if hes into baseball, how about a new glove? If he's ito clubbing, how about a new cool shirt? Look at wht he loves to do and pick something that goes with that.|`|AA10657182	CD, cologne, something that you make especially (CD), favorite dish|`|af07e65bc7c5db4fff1bd09dd674411daa	make him happy early morning from what he likes in you, Make him happy by wearing a dress which he likes on you, stand front of him in the early morning and wait for him to open his eyes with some beautiful smile on your face with some flowers in your hand, as soon as he opens his eyes just wish him very sweet & cute present him the flower, I bet you definitely he will be happy.|`|AA12237386	so maybe you could go to wal-mart and get him a model car, you can put it together for him or let him do it hissself, you can get them in the toy section. then he'll have something hand made, and it's  something he likes, maybe even take him out to eat or get him a gift certificate at his fave resturant so him and his friends can go out.|`|b4d71beb016fb785b2f2b93443981c81aa	Arh the age of reason.....

vnJG8UYJaa	Your problem does not come from the fact that she moved in, the problem is in how you both communicate with one another.  Everybody's talking and nobody's listening.  Make some time to sit down together and decide what the 3 most important current issues in your household are.  Is it money, time together, friends, etc.  Then do some brainstorming, (no criticizing each other's ideas) about the possible ways to solve some of the issues.  Then go through those ideas and narrow them down to things you can do now to help correct those issues.  Set some short term, mid term and long term goals for your relationship.  This gives both of you a chance to speak and to listen to the others ideas.    If this sounds like it takes too much time and energy, it is time to move on.  However, practice communication before someone else moves in.|`|psn7Prigaa	No! In 2 weeks you barely even know a person. No wonder you're having problems, you havent even passed vital stages yet.

If he doesn't, there's your answer.|`|PpAb8fezaa	Call him !!!|`|FVYf8ZBGaa	call him, and if he dosnt call back,  i hate to say it, but forget him....its sad i know  i hate to talk about it cause it is a painful situation.|`|k16Uwtteaa	You should call him and ask if everything alright. If he doesn't reply go round his house, and ask if everything alright, but possibly He could have met someone there and is ignoring you? i don't know. But Just try first if things aren't working out.. Then you can try again or just dump him.. good luck. :)|`|UVRnhwKZaa	Don't wait for to happen good things. He may be a bit busy but your call may make smile on his face. By talking to each other, people came near to each other. It doesn't matter who takes the initiative but it matters that both of you talk to each other or not. You also did a good job by posting comments on facebook.|`|ghfy30BWaa	well maybe he is really busy?  i would call him soon!  then if he acts all weird then maybe something is up   and u should talk to him about it.|`|IUlIixJLaa	It's the year 2009 for goodness sakes call him..He is probably just sidetracked doing other things and you'll never know until you call..girls are alot more tuned into their feelings
fP46meSmaa	Give him time to heal and get over her , but always be there for him,if he needs some emo support.If you really like him and want to date,just tell him how you feel.**
LqtD1uS0aa	i think you should just take it slow. see how your feelings change with time, cuz you may find that your interested in a different guy. but remember, having a crush is sooooo confusing (i should kno, i have had this big crush on this guy from my school for two years now, and he still doesnt kno, but he doesnt like me) but you just have to hang on. if you find that you really really like him, and you dont think you could go another day without him in your life, then tell him that. you can only hope for the best from that. i hope this helps and good luck! |`|7Ct2SSEuaa	Oh, this is very complicated... But if he likes you, am sure you will get a lot of hints for that...
71VRvldJaa	You cut....he hurts himself.....no wonder your parents are concerned.  Both you and your friend sound like you have some serious emotional issues you need to deal with and resolve.  Until you do that, you shouldn't even be considering a relationship together.  I totally support your parent's decision on this one!|`|MIvVbhvHaa	aww im sorry :[     my advice to you is to forget what your parents said & see him, tell them your going to a friends house & see him.    your leaving in four months anyway so whats the big deal?    f*ck what they said, your going to be upset in 4 months why start the crying early?    have fun for now, live it up, forget them for now.    yeaa there your parents, but you should still be able to have fun with your boyfriend.    good luck. & DONT hurt yourself, that not the answer to nothing but a mental hospital.
CPhJS1sFaa	I don't know if he necessarily likes you, but he is flirting with you.  If he does it to all the other girls, he probably just likes to flirt with as many pretty girls as he can.|`|j9p3wivfaa	hmmm i think he knows that you think that he might like you and is tryina get you to fall for him  but he doesnt seem like the kind of guy that is gonna leave the usual and be serious with one gurl|`|W8RqiKbVaa	i think he likes you but i wouldnt go out with him if he does that with loads of girls..... the dudes a player!  thats not a turn on for most girls.    hope i could help?|`|Kw5T7XEfaa	no i dont think he likes you..  i think hes just being nice and wanting to talk|`|TZeKta4haa	WOMANIZA IS WAT HE BE HUNEY!!!!!!!!!!!|`|DeObHL9Oaa	YESSSS!!!! its so OBVIOUS!!!|`|1eead5419997453f5ce20fa8cc466262aa	I think you should talk to him more. Even if you are not interested in him - just tell him that you appreciate his courtesy
VEEgoDkFaa	What? I wish I had that problem.  A whole lot of females probably wish they had that problem. I think you'll just have to live with it. Trust.

8oCwrIR2aa	Oh... I can tell you a LOT.    Not here though. There are young minds that could read and lead wonderful lives instead of joyless repressed ones like their parent's want...    As to your specific question, like every last thing sex related, it should feel exactly like what works exactly for you. If you find you like it just stinging, and adding to that until you "can't stand it" and then stopping immediately, or shifting to another sensual thing, like massaging of the spanked area, or away from it altogether, then that's exactly what you should do. And if every 4th or 5th time you like it to REALLY hurt, then it should. Up to the point of real damage, um, of course. Whatever "does it" for you, there is no other rule or guideline, except for minimizing permanent harm or scarring if such would be an issue in your life.    Such a simple thing, soooooo much variation available...|`|AikAMGQaaa	It should sting somewhat. Kind of like getting a hickey. If it hurts just right, it can be a huge turn on. If it hurts too much, then it becomes a distraction.|`|YLajQcFkaa	I think I answered your question in your other question.  If you ask for the spanking you are in control.  Problem here is your guy should be asking this question and be in control.  If you want one he likely will not know how to give you a good spanking.   Unless you magically find a guy who spanks you without you asking for spanking your fantasy will have to be started with you asking him to learn thru research how to go about giving a spanking.|`|lUjjfS4Raa	the pain of the spanking can mix with the sexual arousal with the mind causing a "turn on". just remember that it isn't for everyone.|`|AA10960571	It may sting at first but it is a turn on my bf does it to me all the time.  It has to be somthing that you enjoy in order for him to do it but otherwise it is enjoyable and men sure do enjoy it.|`|AA11243424	That's entirely up to you.  Have him start out softly and follow your directions to start spanking you harder until you reach a point that you are happy.    Most important though; Have fun!!
ks2oieV0aa	Ew, Rebound Relationships are usually never a good thing.  I would just work really hard and put all my efforts into my children right now.  you don't have time to play games with him.  xox|`|y3tPrTtBaa	How about maybe taking a break and putting everything with this man on hold?  You have already been through a relationship that had to be terminated, why get into another just like it?  There seems to be more negatives or questions than answers...think the old-fashioned way - do not get physical anymore and attempt to start from scratch- if he does not measure up you lost nothing.  Men usually get bored fast when all they want is the sex or convenience in a relationship - they will stop putting effort into things fast..you should try this... he will reveal his true intentions.  Good luck!
T7HuKzZcaa	there is no reason you should not be able to go without him   he sounds like a control freak    if you let him win this one it will never stop.  take charge and go|`|GoQzMoSeaa	Well, I think you should go to the concert.  By the way, can I rock your world?|`|oLI2SJ08aa	You should go (unless you're going with another guy).

I would suggest taking things very slow...it is much easier to postpone a wedding or nullify an engagement than it is to marry and wish it never happened.

5IferJ9Haa	to me it sounds like he was waiting to find something to make him feel deserving of you... he didn't want you to be mad at yourself for being w/ some guy that doesn't have a job so he had to prove to himself and to you that he was being serious when he gave you that excuse.  Intimacy and the connection you two feel in the bedroom is something that no one can tell you about if you two are experiencing something new then i say give it a shot see what happens... just be sure that this date night wasn't just a one night thing... make sure you keep him wanting and chasing you... tell him how much you've enjoyed the night and that you loved last night =) maybe he'll get the point you want him to keep askin you... DATE NIGHTS ARE IMPORTANT keep them going|`|Ki90Irkcaa	No, he hasn't changed. He asked you out, for exactly the reason you guys went out and that's it. You were right in the first place, it is a cop out. If a guy isn't ready to settle down because they are focused on their career, then its just that. He may go out with girls, f*** em when he's in town, and he may even like you. But not enough to slow down. Its just not a good time for him maybe. So since you're "still fishing" keep doing that. Asking you out to dinner may be a big thing for HIM but not to the average guy. So if asking you out to dinner was a big deal for him, what do you think its gonna take to get him to ask you to commit to him? Have a good time, do what you're doing, and if something good comes along, don't back burner them for this hard to peg guy. Good luck!|`|VxW3bAjzaa	Mr. Right already "has it together".

To late for him now! put there are still those butterflies! i hope you follow your own heart! your true happiness is only from yourself! i hope the job thing has helped him see the light! good luck!|`|NRldAzrpaa	I mean it sounds like you've already tried to have a relationship for 8 years, isnt that a bit long?|`|IMwLfHQvaa	i think he's trying to be a better person for you.especially with that whole job thing.  can you answer my first question please.  id really really appreciate it|`|AA11447210	We can't know what's on his mind, as you know. However his recent behavior does sound promising in light of what you described in the past. I'd say it was okay to be hopeful, but don't get your hopes up too high. See how it plays out...and it's smart to keep your eyes open for other opportunities also. I don't believe in throwing away something we really want, that has promise (I'm there now too!) but I also don't believe in waiting indefinitely (excluding all other possibilities) for something that may never happen.    I wish you the best and if this situation is right for you both, that you at least get to explore it further together and see if you two might really be a  good match. ???

Let me get this straight - you want to have it on your conscience for the rest of your life that you have been messing with someone else's man? Why would you want to do that? Have you thought about what is good for all concerned - INCLUDING HER? If you think they're having problems, have you tried talking to her about it?    Don't even think of making a move with him unless you have considered the benefit of all, and tried to talk to her about their relationship if you see trouble ahead for them.

If you think you are, then maybe you should work on your self image, a boy may notice the changes.    Do something that surprises you every day. Even if it's complimenting another girl on her hairstyle/clothes, it'll make you feel good for the rest of the day. That way, it'll help you make friends.    By spreading your friendship circle you can find new guys that you haven't met. Start this new persona and show them who you really are. Guys like quiet, but if they're too shy to make the first move, help them. It's like a vicious circle, the longer you don't have a boyfriend, the worse you feel about yourself, your self image decreases, and boys are not sure about you, and the circle carries on. Break the circle!

qCQJ7t3Oaa	You really need to end the relationship, today. You can not be with another girl, and have a girlfriend. You for sure have to tell her that you guys are over. You can avoid telling your seeing someone else, unless she knows the person, but you can say like you feel like what you guys used to have just is not there, and you want to have space, and not be in a relationship. You could blame yourself or something so  maybe she will feel guilty like " I feel bad I treat you like a dick, ive been thinking, we need time apart from eachother, you deserve better, and I have been wanting to tell u this forever". Or you could say I dont know how else to say this, but I have been seeing someone else...(but i dont advise you say that, youll create so much chaos/drama) OR just say " this isnt working for me anyone, please respect the fact I want to be along right now, and stop calling me, or asking me questions. Im at a point in my life where I want to be single, and explore my options" She'll get over it. the more you prolong this, your asking for trouble.

71VRvldJaa	If you want closure you need to stop texting and talking on AIM.    She told you she didn't want to see you because it would be too hard to say goodbye....Then she told you she doesn't know how she feel about you.  You need to respect the fact that this relationship is over.  The sooner you stop all contact with her, the sooner you will find closure.  It's been about 6 months now since you broke up.....why on earth would you see each other now and stir things up again.  There is a reason why people from your past don't make it to your future.  You need to put this behind you and move on.
ciGQ77JBaa	I had a situation similar to yours. If you two are kinda friends, then just go for it. If he says no basically cause he doesn't want to, just deal with it and move on! Boys like that aren't worth your time and it shows that they don't want to get to know you better.    If your friends make fun of you, don't mind them. They should be proud of you that you even had the courage to do that, my friends were! And if you do get rejected, they should be comforting you, not making fun of you.     But if you want to do it, do it! Or else you'll never know what would've happened.|`|PpAb8fezaa	you should ask him out when its just the two of you.      and if they laugh at you shrug it off act like you dont care.    and as they laugh just say "its cool theres hotter guys out there anyway" or something like to let them know you can handle it .get me?
4B1zfJqdaa	Well guy, I think you're in love. When you're not with her, you probably wonder who she's talking to or hangin' with. I'm sure she feels the same way. Bummer though that she couldn't come and see you when you were sick. Hope you are better now.:)  Enjoy the ride. You are only young once, so absorb this crazy thing called love. Call her now and tell her how you feel!
xZOHlSXsaa	Hey - I'm a guy in a similar situation =)    I go to an all boy's school, incredibly shy around girls and i'm 15 too so I know what you're talking about.    Well.. I'd try and say.. enter some clubs where boys are likely to be. I don't suggest becoming a member of you're local rugby club but I mean.. there has to be something you like where boys will be.     You could:     Go to the gym  Go out partying  Go out with friends more often when boys and girls will be in the group  Scouts is a good start - do you know many people who you like there?    If not then - and it is working for me - simply make a bigger effort to talk to more boys (in my case girls lol)     Sometimes simply being around them helps to boost your confidence but until you get some first-hand experience, it's difficult to realise we are people too :)    Does your school have a sixth form? There may be boys there?    Anyways - hope this helps =)|`|06fbb22b2b5e67da178b8ad8a7e614c4aa	Find someone you like and show interest(romantically not friendly)    ain`t that simple?

Sr2mS8Xoaa	for you to experienece things, you gotta go through something. You need to meet someone.. maybe at college? im guess here. maybe a bar or even online. Make a friendship with that person and things will lead as it should. Your in your late teens, your gonna meet someone.

N00pHxwJaa	PLEASE READ:  Hopefully yu'll choose me as the best answer as i do know the actual reason for it lolz. I read somewere once that the reason why guys are so attractive to boobs is as before we evolved (the whole charls dwin thing) we use to 'mate' from behind and boobs remind males of a female bum - meaning sex (guys obviously dont know this its just instinct). As stupid as it sounds this is the reason scientists belive to be true lolz  Hope THis Helps to yur conclusion as its not an opinion its a fact lmaoo|`|iLehzXFxaa	idk we just do lol.. there hot.. for some reason r brains r programmed to like them...|`|GTK8Phm1aa	i kn rite ?! they r just skin nd fat ....ew when u think of it|`|hd0XS2r3aa	why do girls like guys with big wangers?|`|cf4edaf15617b46e94d234ea845ecdebaa	duh... cause they are boobs|`|tsdHndRhaa	well lets see if they find them attractive when there saggy and droopy.|`|xJBJn6dOaa	1. because they don't have them  2. because we always cover them up... so they're super curious and love to play with them.|`|qLhtnommaa	they don;t have any
VxW3bAjzaa	Because he's flighty as are most teens.|`|5IferJ9Haa	sounds like he's messin w/ her emotions... i'd just back off and see what happens if he does like her then he'll try harder and when he does be like what the ***ll was that introducing us to your girlfriend and sayin you want to ask ____ out... don't be one of those girls that gets swooped up by an older man just to be cheated on the whole time... good luck... p.s. guys are stupid and what we consider ditchin and they do is different.
LqtD1uS0aa	well, you already told him how you feel about it, so theres not much you can do. if its really bothering you (which i dont kno why it would, cuz i wish that all boys/men just walked away from fights) then keep bugging him about it. someday he will talk to you about it, and your problem will be solved. just take some time, and see where things go. i hope this helps and good luck! 
af2bcd9347369776f2a7c09928275944aa	Wait a minute, you upset that you boyfriend won't fight with you. That's not normal to me.    The reason he won't fight with you is cause is a MATURE man. Mature people don't need to play stupid games and argue over bullshit. Fighting never solves anything, chances are if you keep this up he'll break up with you. He's probably seem his share of fighting over the years and realizes how pointless it really is, and is just tired of the bullshit. A good relationship doesn't need bullshit.|`|f1Unp3fBaa	Why is fighting so important?|`|IytPJbv4aa	he just doesnt like conflict, and he might think that if you guys fight it could hurt the relationship and he doesnt want that to happen.|`|06fbb22b2b5e67da178b8ad8a7e614c4aa	You are basically saying you want to fight? he will knock you out trust me..  it`s either(If it`s me as a guy)  1. you are Very rude towards him  2. he don`t love you that much to even bother fighting  3. He don`t want to knock your butt out  4. he isn`t that type of guy    m/20/London|`|GSOYYSUGaa	If it is a fight over something stupid in the first place my question would be why do you care? Maybe he is just a type b personality. He is laid back so he doesn't think the issue is important so he doesn't care to fight about it. If the topic isn't important to your relationship let it go and you both will probably be much happier. If it is something important tell him you guys need to talk about it and work it out because it is harming your relationship.
AB5erhhUaa	Okay, so me and my 13 year old boyfriend were at a pool party, and recently I asked him if he liked my chest and he said he did and winked at me.  So my bikini top was coming untied around my neck and I asked him to tie it and he reached his hand down and grabbed my boobs!! Everyone was starring at him, and he was like let's take this party to my bedroom!! So we started to and I started to get my period all over my friends bed sheets and I had to explain the whole story to my mom and my friend.|`|DrFrkM63aa	my friends and i were at the pool and my friend had to go to the bathroom so, being girls and all, we went with her and waited outside. one of my friends dared me to go into the men restroom for 30 seconds. i thought the dare was stupid and not hard at all so i was like "okay, fine."  i went in there and just as i was coming out, the hot male lifegaurd walks in and was like "WTF?!?! WHAT ARE YOU DOING IN HERE???"  i was sooo embarrased so i just ran right past him and out of the restroom.  i try to avoid swimming at that pool in the summer now  =D|`|8d0PhOjEaa	Ok, well, I haven't done a whole lot of embarrasing things so these probably aren't that good but...  I used to be a football trainer adn a cheerleader and so I was always around the football team. One day, this senior (I was a freshman) caught me staring at his butt ;) and completely pointed out in front of the ENTIRE football team.. It was mortifying, cause they were all laughing at me and my brother was gave me soooo much crap for it for rest of the year.  And the other one would be last year when I was a senior. The attendance office at our school has a sliding glass door and I completely walked right smack into it. Seriously (I didn't think people actually did that). Anyways the guy I completely had a crush on was the office aide for the attendence lady at the time so he saw it and couldn't talk he was laughing so hard. To make it worse, our school is really open and the cafetorium (cafeteria/auditorium) and the attendance offiice are right there together so a ton of people at lunch saw it too.|`|X4Owk0xTaa	My story isn't even funny it's just plain embarrassing I was on a road trip with people from around the world, we were travelling around australia. I was on a bus with canadians, indians, asians, americans, aussies just people from all corners of the world ... anyway the road we were travelling on was super long and winding, and the bus was tiny and the heat was stifling, so naturally I felt sick. Anyway I was sitting next to this american guy and I couldn't hold it in any longer I eventually threw up on the both of us... the american guy was speechless he just didn't know what to say and some stupid ***** was complaining bout the smell and was really rude to my face. They all had to get out of the bus, it took about an hour to clean the thing, get rid of the odor, we were all late for scheduled activities etc.    Thankfully there were these canadians that were sympathetic and took me under their wing.     So I basically ruined the trip around beautiful australia for everyone.|`|d9bd1d4468ea0aae2b98e9d6d2b94953aa	Well last year i was dateing this kid and we were on the swings together and we were going really high and the swings bounce when u go to high so then once when it bounced i fell off the swings and hit my head the buy i was with jumped off and ran over to me i tryed to get up on my own and then i fell on my face and he was like "wow how graceful u r" IT WAS SOOOOOOOO EMBARASSING!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!1
swL7bQfAaa	Do what makes you feel comfortable. Always get receipts, no matter what you spend your money on (power,, groceries, car rego, repairs)   If you do decide to assist in the payments on the house, make sure you get receipts stating what they were for. If things go sour further down the track and you feel the need to recoup your money, you have proof of where it went.  If you are really concerned about it 'feeling' like your house as well - and to protect yourself further - have the mortgage in both your names. Not an unreasonable request if you are both genuine in your path to marriage.|`|7d84621e89c49bcba037226d3361c90baa	If you live in it, then yes.  If you don't, then don't pay towards it until you move in.    If you don't feel "comfortable" paying half of the bills for the house, then don't move in until you're engaged.  As for now, just tell him you don't want to commit to buying a house until you've committed to getting married.|`|acWyJ3t0aa	Not a bit . Even though things are going great right now , tomorrow morning might be a horse of a different color .

Wait , that is the proper thing to do.|`|ZKsSnT64aa	If you were buying the house in your name,would you be ok if your boyfriend lived with you and didnt help?    Im not judging what you are asking,Im just saying reverse the situation and think ( HONESTLY ) how you would feel.|`|PBBtIrPDaa	a house is an investment.  If marriage is the plan, put the title of the house in both names.  that way, you are contributing to the investment and you have a stake in that investment.  If he just want the title of the house in his name, i would question his motives.

Don't worry if you think it's embarrassing or a girl problem or anything like that, if he really likes you he'll be glad to just be talking with you. And, at least for me, "girl issues" are kind of funny, so if he laughs don't worry about it, either.
UqGpznyqaa	sounds like something my friend would do.  I can just say give her space. And make her realize wat shes missing out on.  Ask someone random to hang out. whats the worst that could happen they say no?  And that was very bitchy of her.  And i bet you would never treat her like that.  After she realizes the space you gave her, talk to her how you think the situation is unfair and she needs to treat you equally as nice, or ur not true friends...|`|Sn4ldoifaa	aww i feel for you...they probaly got together while you were sick and sometimes girls do that then they exclude someone else...so i would let it be and see what happens in the mean time maybe you should hang out with someone else that you know that way you still have someone to hang with.k?...good luck and hope i helped:)

DlBeFoKcaa	be patient hun, and relax.   let your lips do the work.   Once you get comfortable let the tounges touch and then eventualy kiss with passion and let the tounges dance like wild fire together.  It takes practice and be patient babe.       wana practice?  I love teaching =)|`|4wm5kAygaa	http://www.wikihow.com/Kiss|`|8cuPVvYnaa	Wow, I loved Brian's answer.... until the end of it. The beginning place is to be sure it is with someone you care very much for. Kissing starts the process of "becoming one" with someone you care for. I recommend you wait to finish this process (having sex) until you are much older, preferably when you have a committed relationship such as marriage.)     You kiss being sensitive to what you and the other person is doing and feeling. You blend together. Start slow and sensitively (not always, but this is the best way to start usually). Lips are very sensitive. Don't think about if you're doing ok. Let yourself feel. Gradually increase the passion level, being sensitive to where each of you "are". This will be easy to do with someone you care very much for. But if you are young and just want to experience a first kiss, then just give a short simple kiss. Enjoy! :-)|`|qGsKJe2Iaa	Since you do not know how. That means that you have to wait more time
9Ed7cgAFaa	Forgive him? He hasn't wronged you. Lots of otherwise-good religious people don't wait. If that's unacceptable, move on, but don't think it's unusual.|`|LLeQyWGcaa	the question is can you forgive and forget. if you can't then my advice is to move on and find another. if you can, don't bring it up at all.|`|ajK4OLROaa	just move on|`|HyfZ7s2Eaa	He did it before he met you. I'm sure he's not going to do it whilst he fancies you!|`|YawdUnRKaa	Well, I think him being honest with you is good, and at this point, not liking him anymore because of that is a bit immature. He made a mistake and he trusted you enough to tell you it. If you trust him, you know he would never do the same thing to you. You can't judge people on what they've done. My ex wasn't a virgin, but he never got past a peck with me after over a month, because I was different than the rest. I made a boy who was a perverted non virgin, into a whipped prude, pruder than me! Maybe you'll be different for him too, give the guy a chance to prove that you're all he wants and nothing stupidly physical like that.
yfoNIRRvaa	just confront her and tell her exactly what you told me, even if it sparks a fight - its a good sign your getting through. tell her your sick of it and if she wants to talk she can but you cannot help her if you don't know whats happened. honestly i must say that i don't think your relationship is going to make it much longer :(|`|5g0gJFvcaa	maybe she is being distant because maybe your being distant with her and u may not know ur even doing it but if u love her then try to make the best of it and if its not right then the other girl will still be there  if she likes u and if u like her      ps. answer my question too plz!|`|f6ab3ae3fee781c3975ea305670f972faa	you need to figure out what exactly has changed so that you can show her what has changed and then the two of you can figure out if you do have a problem or if it is just you are ready for something else.      you sound young.  I'm voting for "something else"    if you are still with your GF for Valentine's Day then she's the only person you should get anything for.  If you are no longer with her then you don't need to get anything for anyone unless you've started dating someone else already.    if you've decided that you are ready to move on, then break up with her before Valentine's Day (not the day before and not on it).  If you know you want to break up with her but you can't work up the nerve to tell her before V-Day, then just don't get her anything for V-Day---that will likely start a fight and you may not have to break up w/her.  she'll do it for you.|`|0VqNMJQFaa	Tell her how you feel. Sit her down in an environment where there are very few people nearby, little to no distractions, and have a heart-to-heart with her. Good places to go are a library, a park (although I wouldn't recommend it.. it's too cold!), a museum, etc. Take her on a nice date, maybe dinner and a movie, then take her out to one of these places and talk to her about how you feel.    Before the date, you might try and write down what you want to say, why you feel she's been getting distant, etc.: organize what you intend to say before you say it, and you'll get a higher quality communication with your girl.    If, at any point during this date/conversation, you think about that other girl, you've already lost your girlfiend. Do not think about this other girl at all. What you're feeling is a pity crush: you aren't getting the attention you want from your girlfriend, so you're seeking it elsewhere. Return yourself to her, give your girlfriend everything you have, and she'll reciprocate.    I wish you the best.

D10tLM5uaa	the second one seems kinda clingy,but then again who knows,you might be into that kind of thing.    but the first one seems better.i think he talks about the other girls to make you jealous,if you want him to stop doing that then just tell him.    but overall,its your decision! =]  good luck|`|acWyJ3t0aa	Since you asked me for an opinion , here is what I think about that .    You seem to really like number 1 and the only thing you put down as negative was that he was truthful with you that he was not a virgin . Some guys will say that just to make you think he is cool and experienced , but it sounds to me like he told you so that you would know , just plain being truthful and that is not a bad thing .    Number two seems like he is a great guy and quite a flatterer but if he does not seem to mind distracting you from your work , then he really could turn into a pest and make your grades drop . If you have told him about this and he still distracts , then he needs to go .  Personally as a father I would not advise you who to like or not like nor would I venture out to choose for you , but I would recommend to you that number one seems to be the one I would approve of .|`|DlBeFoKcaa	neither pick me =)
HRqXnOY7aa	i've liked a few guys i've raced with too, but i do district racing which is like half on a motocross track, half on trails and i have a race about twice every month so i got to see them once in awhile but it did suck being apart...i suggest you add them on myspace (if you have one, or if the guy you like has one and you can actually find him on there) and just message each other a little bit and then ask for his number, it will be easier that way. or you could just be brave and ask him for it. you race motocross, asking a guy for his number shouldn't be scary at all for you, good luck :)

vmhPRQa7aa	There is always something sexy, at the very least eye catching, about a woman who's hair goes down to her waist.

You can always say no.|`|NRldAzrpaa	why does having a gf stop u playing guitar hero? :S  Stay single if u want 2 .|`|cdUCCHgaaa	lmao. sure you can. she can play with you! but dont make them your entire life. so i would say with these 3 girls, say no to all of them. becuz you will b involved in sooo much drama. they will all fight and you'll be in the middle and you dont want to do that.|`|R9AEpBc0aa	Yep be absent that day. Say no 2 all of them. :D good  luck! Ps: I luv playing rock band 2 isn't it so totally worth it?|`|Xprsabo9aa	That makes no since ummm oky?|`|tD0nI64xaa	Lol. say no to all three of them. It's that simple.
TCqrS8Vqaa	HIYA, send her a card saying   i love you, ill be waiting for you when you are free.   then leave it to her to make the next move.|`|SDnhUMv9aa	Aww bless!  It's good that your in touch with your feelings for her. It doesn't make you gay or a sap. It makes you a really cool guy. Most girls would kill for a lad who feels that way about them so im gonna give you my best advice. I think that if you say anything to her it will just cause trouble. I mean this girl is in a relationship with someone and its really going to piss of this boyfriend if you tell her your feelings . Thing is, if she loves you she will break up with this guy. Then you should make your move.  I think that yes you should give her something for valentines day but something casual like I dno a CD to a band you know she's into, nothing like a flower to represent your love to her. I sure she does love you as you sound like a really nice guy. I wish you the best   laura xx|`|0WfsZ7lCaa	just try 2 stay friends right now but send hints that u like her. she will prob pick em up and no so that wen u do tell her she will already kno and it wont b awkward and wont ruen ur friend ship. try gettin a friend ship bracelet or necklas 4 her.|`|rfkVin6Iaa	Does she love her boyfriend? If she does, it may be hard, but you have to leave her alone. BUT if you know she doesn't love her boyfriend as much as you, then send her flowers and a personal note for her saying how much you like her.|`|SZGirUZkaa	Write All Your Feelings Down And Give Them To Her. If She Feels The Same Way, Talk To Her About Your Options And Her Boyfriend. If He's A Good Guy, Hopefully He'll Understand That You Belong Together. Friendships Start Good Relationships Too.  Good Luck!|`|4nZb9oqKaa	dont destroy ur friendship..|`|PpAb8fezaa	you should write her a letter =]|`|TtWqeSF4aa	just tell her if she is a real friend she will understand and if she doesn't love you back you ll be heartbroke for a while but you will feel much better to get it off your chest|`|m6GViCoMaa	You should tell her and I think that sending flowers is a good way to tell her. I don't think it should ruin your friendship. It happens a lot when a boy and girl are friends and they like each other. Either tell her now or when her and her boyfriend breaks up.|`|KvKaMhXvaa	You could send her flowers, but that will probably piss her bf off.  I think you just need to talk to her to see if she feels the same way you do.  Believe me, she is not going to make the first move, or come right out and tell you her feelings if you don't ask.  Talk to her about it and tell her that you like her more then just friends.|`|TMhVClBgaa	if you keep putting your emotions aside, you will have a problem.  but your biggest problem is how you are going to break-up her current relationship with her or her bf getting furious at you.  you have to try to get around that inevitable situation. or just wait until they break-up.
XgA6YWhTaa	Yes.    You get over your first love when you meet the person you'll spend the rest of your life with.  Your first love is just that, your first love- not your current love.  Remember, there's a reason you're not longer with them.      You'll meet knew people for the rest of your life, and one day you'll meet someone you'll spend the rest of your life with.  When everything falls into place- you'll just know.  And your first love will be nothing more than just a memory.|`|f6ab3ae3fee781c3975ea305670f972faa	of course you get over them.  You may remember them fondly forever but you do get over them.    if you can't get over them and they still occupy a great deal of your thoughts then it means you have psychological issues and you need professional help.|`|E3O2Gi0Uaa	I can't even remember her name.|`|fBXRNKyuaa	I sure hope so!|`|tfE0i20Daa	Some people forget some people don't. I think if you still haven't forgot them you think about how much change has happened since you've been with them.|`|YKK0IBbhaa	I'm not over my first love and it's been... around almost 5 years. I've been in other relationships since then and have fallen in love since but I'm still not over him. You will always love the person who stole your heart but no... it doesn't mean you should still be together. I'm over him but it doesn't mean I have to stop loving him. You can get over your first love, just give it time.|`|cyfDLbfRaa	yes,   i pinky swear you that u will over ur first love.  it just takes time girl, i promise.  i thought i would never ever get over mine, untill i met the guy im with now. he is more than i could ask for, and just amazing. i couldnt be happier.  you WILL have alot more guys coming your way.  he isnt the only boy you'll have all over u.  it just takes time!|`|M5hzHHvtaa	im still with my first love...we plan to get married this december.|`|IytPJbv4aa	hell yah you can get over your first love. you will never forget them but you can not have feelings for them anymore. but if in your heart you WANT and THINK you should be back together than go ahead. But dont just feel like you should because u still have feelings for them. It takes awhile to get over them because you fall So HArd for your first real love.
aujHVGFiaa	1.NEVER EVER cry to your ex and tell him that you want him back. it will only make you look     pathetic. you should not beg..make HIM beg!  2. guys always want what they can't have! don't be too available,be mysterious and provocative.  3. when you do see him,LOOK YOUR BEST..always always look your best!make him realize what he had     lost.  4. be sweet and friendly,but not just to him..but to everyone else too (friendly,NOT flirty!).but     don't blab too much.  5. smile a lot,but don't be too cheesy. show him (or just pretend) how "content" your life is with     or without him.  6. don't act stupid.be smart,be polite and don't overreact. treat him like he's any of your guy     friend.  7. now that you're single..enjoy being one!go out with your friends!get a new hobby!be daring!talk     to other guys (who knows..)!have fun!your ex will realize that you're really having fun only if     you're not faking it.  8. once again..always look your best,be respectful and love yourself. people would only respect you     and want to be a part of your life only if you took good care of yourself.|`|aUDVBmZSaa	No boobs? PASS.|`|5bqw2APsaa	I hate you already.
uCcCEHmqaa	you DEAL WITH IT!|`|IUlIixJLaa	It's hard but you need to move on, you can't make someone love you..but who knows what the future may hold, everyone deserves to be loved back|`|5Wr9Mlwoaa	Gee, can't help you with that.    I simply don't have a clue what that feels like.|`|VSoMRVBXaa	i know how you feel. i loved this one guy since 6th grade. im now in 10th. you should either try to talk to him, or try to get over him and find someone new. im with someone else now and im head over heels in love with him. but that doesn mean that those other feelings will ever go away. hope that answered your question.|`|TMhVClBgaa	DO NOT CLING!!  it's not normal behavior and the guy would think you are obsessed or crazy. get yourself a makeover and get back on the market
fBXRNKyuaa	If you keeping breaking up and you have trouble committing to her maybe you don't really like her.|`|a8mQuc4iaa	by falling in love with her  comes with being completely devoted to her    she is only going to keep coming back for so long|`|k16Uwtteaa	If you keep on breaking up with her,  then it's probably not working and you should try to seek out for someone else.|`|2VAHKxh7aa	The only person who can answer this is you.    You need to ask yourself why you're breaking up with her in the first place so constantly.  Is it because you get bored in relationships quickly?  If so, I suggest you guys only go on dates when you have a specific activity you're going to do together.  It's easier to stay in a relationship if you don't get sick of the other person.    If you keep breaking up because you two get into arguments, you need to ask yourself whether these arguments are persistent and whether they are worth staying together.    I hope you figure it out.|`|3z0xTQ79aa	if you really like her STOP breaking up with her  you are just gonna push her a way  you need to make sure you are ready for a long term relationship so you can be fully committed to her   or you both will end up getting hurt|`|DTUOvJm0aa	Okay dude. Listen and listen good.     If you keep yo-yoing this girl for no reason, you're going to be the one getting dumped. You need to get it in your head  that if you want to be with this girl, then stop freaking dumping her. it's simple as that. if you like her than it shouldn't be that hard. Yes, relationships are hard. But it doesn't take much to stay with her if you are willing to work things out.      If you break up with her again, do her a favor and don't go out with her again. You're just going to end up hurting her more than she already is.|`|GTK8Phm1aa	dont be a manwhore plz

AA10799615	I think the internet allows people to remain more anonymous so they feel more free to discuss anything. Sex is just a good thing.|`|AA11055594	Yupe!
AJCLHmNBaa	I don't think I would consider this person a friend. It sounds like you hang out, but that's more of an acquaintance. From what you have said it appears you would rather spend time alone than have her company. She sounds pretty selfish, but she could just have a lot of problems, maybe at home, and can not really be anything but selfish.     It takes a while to develop trust and to really count someone a friend. A friend is someone I can rely on when I'm in need, and they can rely on me. A friend is also someone who I love spending time with. A friend is someone who is easy to communicate with. A friend is also someone who I can tell how I feel or when they disappoint me I can tell them that too. A friend is someone I can forgive and someone who forgives me.     If you wanted to see if there is any friendship potential with this person, I would try this -     The key chain and your trip for example.     Suppose her name is Ashlynn.     She just said "get me a key chain."    I would say something like. "Ashlynn, it blanks (you fill in the emotion) me when blah blah....    Example: "Ashlynn, it hurts me when I talk about my trip and and a friend does not share share my excitement. What do you think about my trip?"     Then let her respond. This example may not be perfect, but the idea is to tell people what you think without directly criticizing them, but still pointing out how you feel so they are aware of it. If this is a person who really cares about you - you will probably find that in their response. If this is not a person who really cares about you, I suggest you spend your time with people who do care about you.|`|vRhk1VEfaa	I can give you my opinion friend but I am not gonna be able to give you a full answer because I have never seen you two together. By the sounds of it she seams to be flirting with you. I knew a girl like that for a while. If she isn't flirting than the next likely case is that she gets extremely bored very easy. There is a chance that she is using you. I would rather doubt unless you have been giving her everything she has been asking for. All in all I would have to actually see you guys talk before I could really tell you.|`|DbDMNf0Xaa	i dont think she is using you why dont you trying to talk to her she may be shy..wait is she gothic?|`|pFsqFeDCaa	WELL I THINK SHE IS JUST BEING HERSELF.....AND SHE PROLLY DONT MEAN THE THINGS SHE DO....I MEAN TELL HER U R NOT BUYING HER ANYTHING...LOL ITS UR MONEY...|`|9SahxKp3aa	id try finding some true blue friends. ones that would understand about your parents yah know? good luck! :)|`|VGwcNQC2aa	you know, just cuz she isnt exactly like you doesnt make her a bad friend    just stop worrying about it  you don have to be friends with everyone  life isnt a competition of who has the most friends  be more relaxed   just shake it off  and go read a book ur grammar is terrible
E3O2Gi0Uaa	I'm attracted to all races of women, however I've only dated white girls. They are the only ones that have shown interest.|`|QADhk0nFaa	ugh b/c they are just good looking omg! some black guys can just catch my eyes and its all over like nice built lil wayne makes me crazy! lol ps im a white girl|`|Bnj2ftpzaa	Well, don't fret, man. I'm a black woman who is attracted to white men.  it doesn't really matter what others may think. "To each, his own" as they say. You are free to love whomever you please. Just don't down all us sister, huh? We aren't ALL the same! ;-)|`|AA10614910	I'm not sure why I needed to know the details. I guess the question is "do others have this same attraction".  The answer is yes. This is asked too many times. All race questions have been asked at least a million times each|`|XTy7mLAkaa	You can date who you want to date out of preference but do the rest of us a favor and don't belittle the race you come from.  Remember, your mother is black too.|`|g3HvXFGjaa	I'm a black woman, and I prefer white men. Everybody has their own preference, but that doesnt mean you have to put other people down. You say black women tend to be overweight, and that is a stereotype, as I am black and I am very slender and I know many other black women who do not carry much weight... At the end of the day, there is nothing wrong with having preferences, but dont forget who you are and where you are coming from. At the end of the day I am sure you have black women in your family who would be offended by your comments....anyway, date who you want to date; as long as you are happy.|`|LKjMAqXgaa	Haha I understand why. I have a lot of friends that are the same way.  I'm a white girl and lately I've been finding more attraction towards black males than white males. I think the reason is because they tend to be more outgoing and are more likely to come up and begin a conversation with you. PLUSS they tend to have better bodies than white guys. =]
DlBeFoKcaa	be patient you kiss will cume your way!
iLehzXFxaa	holy crap thats crazy im 15 and still a virgin and keeping it that way till im married.. god y would they have sex that young.. wtf. .lol|`|lQGDV7MEaa	They're not crazy, they're STUPID!  Oh well, this is what our society has become. Let the little kids play grown-up; they'll be in for a nice surprise when they actually have to grow up to support a child.|`|bSr3WeXNaa	The truth is most 6th graders haven't even slept with a girl let alone kissed one. What the hell happened to make 13 year olds have sex?|`|NRldAzrpaa	Yeah. I dunno what skl you go to (no afence) but im 14 and basicaly all my m8s r virgins n i wudnt dream of hving sex now.|`|KifasiMraa	Yes, that's awful!  I didn't even have my first kiss until I was almost 15! and that was still before a lot of my friends! Stay strong and don't let anyone pressure in to having sex before you're ready.  I waited until I was sure I was with the right guy and I was almost 18.  I never regretted waiting and being sure I was ready.  And he was totally fine with waiting too. You'll find a good guy someday who is patient with you, don't worry!    Just remember that you're still a a kid, and so are they!|`|oLI2SJ08aa	I do think it's crazy and I applaud you for having enough common sense to not lose your virginity just because everyone else your age is.|`|ClBkTdOEaa	yep. ridiculous! A girl in my grade has a baby and he is a year old and she's 14! pressure. they can't handle it. it's stupid.|`|0WfsZ7lCaa	yes i do!!!    im 13 also! 14 in august.|`|RoTLnFGZaa	YEP IT IS SO CRAZY.  hold on to your innocence, because their all going to regret it.  good for you- being smart and all :]    as you get older, like in high school, you'll get curious about it too when you find a special guy.  just remember that he'll love u even if u don't give in.    best of luck.|`|85tAhnM9aa	Nah go for it, you 13 year old's really know what your doing down there, with your years of experience.|`|2d17c2ff5cd28b3fd169e4ba5aa17f4caa	Value and respect your body, and others will too.  I wish somebody had taught the girls in your school that because you are right, that is really sad.|`|f1Unp3fBaa	I personally think it's sad...|`|bxji3S56aa	Its not your fault.    kids now a days are growing up WAY too fast. Because they're in a rush to grow up.    i don't see the big deal, i'd kill to be 13-16 again.  I'm 21 now, and loving my life. But those teen years are irreplaceable.    i personally hate how kids your age dress like adults, but they still act like sh!t heads.    THe though really grosses me out. You guys aren't even matured, your body is all weird and undeveloped...and you're having sex.  Geez, you kidz are whack.    Congrats to you though for being raised right!|`|71VRvldJaa	Couldn't help but chuckle at your comment you've been single all of your life!  LOL  The day will come when all the 11-13 yr olds who are having sex are going to regret it.  By the time they are old enough to get married, they will have had numerous sex partners and they will have no concept of what committment means.  I'm willing to bet my last cent that the majority of sexually active young kids will be separated or divorced before they are married for 5 years!  Good luck trying to find a guy in that age bracket who isn't a sex fiend!  Boys that age function on brain stem and hormones!  It's ALL they think about!  You sound like a very wise 13 yr old and I truly hope you maintain respect for yourself and your body.  If it means not having a boyfriend for a few more years, so be it!  There's absolutely no sense being with a boy just because you can be.  Don't buckle under peer pressure.  Be strong and the day will come when you'll be very thankful you waited!|`|AA12213253	I'm disgusted but not surprized.   You have parents who aren't teaching the kids properly and the parents themselves probably haven't been taught any true morals. They've been told from a young age that they're animals so they can't control themselves, which is a lie. The school system says go ahead and do it, just don't catch a disease and don't get pregnant. They aren't told about the emotional damage that it does at such a young age (and it does, no doubt about it). Kids are being bombarded with sexual messages (some blatant, some subliminal) almost constantly via tv, music, magazines, etc.    Is it any wonder???|`|Q101YVPgaa	That's disgusting.|`|qGsKJe2Iaa	Better you wait|`|puUStDPpaa	Yeah my boyfriend isn't and I am...I'm in highschool though and he's 17 so I guess its not too much of a shocker.|`|wi0CSqNSaa	Yes, sounds like you go to a bizzare school. Also, im positive a lot of those kids are liars. I would definately bring this to the attention of the school nurse with an anonymous note. This sounds like a huge problem waiting to develope.     There is probably some creepy guy going around convicing girls that he loves them or something weird.|`|gNB2zNQ2aa	i think its crazy. i hope you stay strong and don't give up your virginity to just anyone. good luck!|`|ABhmJepFaa	When I was 13 I wanted to have sex. I didn't but I wanted to. For me it's not crazy at all.|`|XoNKECCKaa	Of course! it's insane. really sex should be saved until marriage. Most likely, these girls arent being pressured into it. They most likely WANT to have sex. Be strong. I know you can, Stay away from people who have premarital sex! lol|`|2si53dCRaa	I think it's absolutely repulsive.  It just shows what our society and pop-culture media has done to the youth.  They show these attractive people in suggestive clothing and sometimes even talking about things that young people shouldnt meddle in.  Teens see the positive attention they get and they think that its the only way to be cool or popular is to be like them and act outrageously.  I commend you for not wanting to go along with the crowd.  And hey, maybe this is a sign that you shouldnt worry about guys like that right now because they might not be at the maturity level that you are.  By not waiting you will only cause yourself harm and most likely drama will occur and it wont turn out good. Yea you can learn from it, but hey sometimes you don't have to make mistakes to learn, right?|`|9QYAW437aa	i agree, i'm also 13.  14 in september.    i was disgusted when i found out  that a few people  that we looked up to as role models  were not virgins.  i'm sorry if it sounds harsh,  but they are such w h o r e s  i'm guessing people think it's a trend to lost their virginity in middle school.  i mean really, wtf|`|mzhFrm5Taa	Yes I do. Like, it is their own choice, there is no way I would judge the people that have sex that young because I don't know the story, I don't know anything about them so I'm not gonna go calling them sluts and skanks like almost everybody does. At the end of the day, its your own personal choice, and when your older, you can choose to be satisfied with that choice or to regret it forever. Most people I know chose that second option.|`|VJlUpfjBaa	This whole thing started not to long ago. When I was a 7th grader sex started becoming increasingly more and more common place. It is really weird, but you will find good boys that are virgins. I managed to hold on to mine until I was 20. I'm 22 now, and I'm still with the same girl. It's really hard to hold on to your virginity but it's worth it, especially with all the STDs floating around these days.|`|4j18lNrsaa	I am also 13, and i wouldnt even think of having sex at my age. But when guys text me all they talk about is sex, its crazy. Even younger guys...|`|GqTSa85daa	It's actually insane...These kids don't know what the full scale ramifications of their lust are.  Angel, keep doing  what you know to be right.|`|HsWFqn1naa	cleopatra had her first lover at age 13  seriously dont look down on others unles you want to me look down upon|`|AA10776535	It sad that this happens...Its bad here to and there are adults i would mention a name if it was legal to do so getting 14 year old pregnant, he has gotten several and i believe he is 21-22.  No parent has pressed charges, he pretends to love the girl and not support the babies.  He is a sick puppy and needs to be in jail .|`|AA10852244	i broke my virginity in 1st grade i swear to god im not even kidding.|`|ASLbRwQ8aa	Im 16 & still a virgin. plann on saving it for the perfect guy.    :D|`|t7MgT5uFaa	yeah your generation are smuts|`|J36Rc5DKaa	pretty normal now a days. by the age of 16, girls are all looose already|`|NGyZCCo6aa	it's RIDICULOUS.    stay strong!! please!!    just stay true to yourself.    and if you find an amazing boy who sweeps you off your feet and he asks you for sex DON'T GIVE IN.    be true to yourself|`|FVYf8ZBGaa	not really, i lost my virginity at 16 with the girl i love.  just look around for a guy you truly like,   dosnt matter if he is or isnt a virgin, he still most likely goin gto suck at sex like it was his first time because of his age.  but all this is my opinion.|`|k16Uwtteaa	No having sex at 13 is NOT suitable for such a young age! Unless you were proper deep into a relationship, (say a few years and know each other well) SEX IS NOT A GOOD IDEA because kids don't know what the hell they are doing; Teenage pregnancy etc, ect.|`|YawdUnRKaa	ew, that's disgusting. Those kids are stupid...stay away from that crowd and their doings, and you'll find a cute good boy, I swear it.|`|Hk39AkNGaa	Thatssss SOOO DISGUSTING, that sucks for the kids who ARENT virgins cuz they took it away when they were sooo younggg... DONT FOLLOW THEIR INFLUENCE. Itssss SOOOO RONGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGG>.|`|uHpdP52Naa	I think it is gross to even lose your "v card" b4 marrige but especially at 13. Im 13 and havent even thought about having sex!|`|XYQOCP1maa	lool dont do it !!! you'll enjoy the sensation alot and wanna do it more often!!! wait till u find a right girl.. at thoose little prosititots that give it up at 13 are just trying to fit in and are misinformed children... dont fall for the trap!!! thoose are just weak willed followers.. you wanna be a leader then take charge of your life and dont do what others are doing .. and thats the only way you'll be a solider!!!! HOOORAH!!!!!!!|`|Gn4WaEzyaa	thats crazy. u guys are way too young, and not all of them are telling the truth you know.|`|f5fjJk8paa	I waited until I was 17, and am still with the guy I lost my virginity to.  I think it's disgusting that girls are losing their virginity so young.|`|S21rftTmaa	It IS crazy, but it doesn't surprise me with everything else the world has come to these days.  The BEST place to find guys is at church. No lie. Almost all of them actually have the sense to like girls for who they are rather than just drooling pigs wanting them for sex.|`|b4v2zdHZaa	i think thats a bad case of parenting. im 13 also, but most of the kids i know are virgins. i guess its different where you live. i live in miami.|`|a4da5109c8bdb18661f94827b55902d5aa	sex is something you should not rush into and just because other people your age have done it don't mean you have to, all i can say is wait for the right person and take things slowly, if your enjoying your life now why change it and regret what you have done x|`|WXwJnhybaa	i remember wen i was in middle school some kids said the same thing. i agree it is kinda crazy becasue its all lust that shouldn't be discovered until later. the truth is that they are most likely lying so dont trip. dont feel presured to do anything and you will find someone for you and don't let him do that to you cuz you will regret it. hope i helped. good luck =)|`|E8H4mGokaa	Your school is either riddled with liars or, i dont have a word for it. So what does it matter if youre still a virgin, youre ****** in that school anyway :)|`|RmKO2ouXaa	I ABSOLUTELY AGREE! I am recently 14 and it is rare to find a fellow virgin in my middle school. I am even afraid to go in my community pool because of the things my 13 year old neighbor told me she has done in there! It is insane that people so young are having sex.|`|uxUV7B5jaa	when I was 12 i was peer pressured into it, i hated myself for months for it, it's tv and **** displaying it as fun and such and so people think they're cool if they do it  and guys are horny bastards and some girls are major sluts|`|L2xa4gvYaa	well i shouldnt talk cause i lost it at almost 15 my sophmore year...in highschool but i thought he was the one...i was also forced and vulrable and just let myself go..he was also a manwhore but i didnt know..lol but yeah i think its crazy i think the only reason y they do it is because they feel like they need to, to be cool, or they just are going through puberty and their hormones are getting all jumbled around...but also some people do it for popularity or peer pressure...on the other hand your doing great i wish i could have waited|`|sg1ahLHiaa	Hahahaha hard to find a virgin at the age of 13?    Well, not every guy is that way, believe me. There are still some of us who are virgins even after we turn 20 as some of us use our bigger head most of the time. And why do you want a relationship so young at all? Go educate yourself, read a lot, guys will come later on...|`|pcPIXkk5aa	I suppose it's their choice.|`|yyyeLgldaa	that's gross   wow ur friends/ classmates are idiots  hopefully they all used protection  but sex at 13 isnt wat should be going on  im sure your gonna find a great guy who doesnt  just think about sex|`|pjECqEVoaa	Try not to fold to peer pressure, there will be plenty of time to experience sex later, after you have gotten your education especially because if you get pregnant you'll find it very hard to accomplish a lot of things in life.|`|dYig4d5jaa	I know  what your talking about and I also think it's wrong. I have a friend (no joke) who is 23 and still a virgin!! people make fun of him for it but he doesn't seem to care and he is a really cool guy, don't let people push you around or to do something you don't want to you'll regret it for a long time!!|`|hnTDf3wNaa	WHOA...that's way too young to be doing that. just keep yours cause more than 70% of them 13 old's are going to regret it.
6dHIoJLVaa	Harry likes you, maybe he didn't at the time you and scott got together, but her certainally does now.  He feels like you replaced him with his brother.  Maybe you should confront harry and ask him if thats true.  One thing you shouldn't be happy about is him thinking of you as something that can belong to anyone, you are 15, and you are a person and cannot be owned by anyone.      You might also want to give harry and scott some distance for the time being, but you should talk to harry.  It sounds like scott is going to be fine from what you've said and harry is having some real problems with what has happened, and is hurt because you went for his older brother.  girls your age tend to be more attracted to older boys, and for him that is torture.    Speak to harry and spend a few weeks away from them, let things fix themselves, but do speak to harry.|`|DrFrkM63aa	wow...  thats just...  wow.  first of all his mom had no right at all to stop the relationship if it is a clean and healthy one and your a nice girl.  harry shouldnt care because he said he was fine with it in the first place! then he turns his back and says he isnt. thats not your fault, its his.  he should've spoken up.  but now youve broken up with scott and your relationship with harry is weaker. i think you all need to just sit down and talk about this because its obviously turning into a problem.  and remember, life goes on. you'll meet someone new that you love and you'll be like... scott who?!?!|`|aGOZrXaqaa	Just, Just, Just, go fall in a well, please.|`|ujT5teZgaa	give them head|`|ikekDCRxaa	Make it clear to Harry you're only friends. You could do this by cutting back the time you spend with him, spending more time with your other friends or even tell Harry he's a good friend but nothing more. Talk to Scott face to face and explain about Harry. If he doesn't take you back then move on, it'll hurt at first but you'll get through it.|`|WJKzAmr7aa	Im pretty sure Harry has feelings for you as more then a friend. He is probably getting jealous of his brother because he has probably liked you but didn't want to tell you, especially after you said you liked his brother and NOT HIM. That probably hurt him.     But its really not your fault that you see Harry as just a friend and not a boyfriend. I don't think you should have broken up with Scott because Harry said so... they are brothers and brothers ALWAYS argue or have problems, and eventually may even like the same girl. This situation is nothing they cant get through.     I think you should tell Harry that it is not fair for him to make you choose between them. And get your boyfirend back!   Also you should sit down harry and ask him why he is doing this.|`|AA10905383	I'm fairly certain that Harry has romantic feelings for you. I'm not sure what you should do in this situation because you don't want to ruin your friendship.    I think you should ask Harry why he has such a problem with you dating his brother.    I hope things get resolved soon.|`|WbbwpeSGaa	Dump them both....|`|d7ISUrkYaa	maybe harry likes you, and thats why he was mad.  you should ask him the reason why he doesnt like  the idea of you guys going out.|`|Y9hBknBuaa	if you really like scott don't let harry get in the way of that!|`|UMHEAQaGaa	Harry obviously has feelings for you and dislikes you dating his brother ratehr than him.... it's hard but talk to harry and tell him how you feel---+ if he really is your best friend he should be with you in whatever you choose.....main thing just talk to him and get him to see your side! If you really do like scott don't let harry hurt you two like this.... show harry how much he's hurting you by doing this!  hope it helped... =]

To me no but I guess to her|`|xJBJn6dOaa	just rub it, and if you are feeling ballsy, start to finger her (meaning, go under her panties, as long as she is comfortable with it) you can judge how good it feels for her by the way she reacts. Don't rub too hard! Nice and slow, and sexual.. she will love it, and you.|`|vl8w7AtDaa	just rub it and be gentle with it.|`|Sih0xHJgaa	Just use a gentle touch when rubbing her (it's sensitive there)....I'm sure she will like it.

Yes, what she's wearing matters.  Some guys are too rough and it just hurts.  you won't know unless you ask.  Communication is essential.|`|COmp4sIuaa	Does it feel good when a girl does that to you?
0VqNMJQFaa	Here's what you do next time he pressures you:    1. Stand up (or take a step away from him -- stop kissing, touching, etc.).  2. Smack him HARD across the face.  3. Say, "NO."  4. Tell him it's over.  5. Walk out.    If you ever consider having sex, ask yourself the following:  ask yourself the following:    1. Do I want to have the reputation of sleeping with a guy just because he shows "loyalty" and "caring"?  If yes, proceed to the next question. If no, cease all sexual activity.    2. Do I want to risk getting pregnant, and having to go through high school, college, starting a career, renting/buying an apartment/house, and all stages of life that are easier without a child?  If yes, proceed to the next question. If no, cease all sexual activity.    3. Do I want to risk getting an STD, which ultimately means I could be risking my life?  If yes, proceed to the next question. If no, cease all sexual activity.    4. Do I want a relationship based on physical attraction or on chemistry?  If physical attraction, proceed to the next question. If chemistry, cease all sexual activity.    5. Am I willing to give away my virginity, the one thing that truly and completely belongs to me and will only belong to me ONCE, to a guy that I am not married to?  If yes, proceed to having sex. If no, cease all sexual activity.    My point is that as a teenager, and even an adult in your early twenties, premarital sex is not an especially bad idea. Premarital sex is NEVER a good idea.. but at any age younger than 25, you do not have the sexual maturity to realize what you're risking and what you're giving away by having sex.    Make wise choices.|`|Ad0C45Ioaa	If you are saying that you are not sure then don't do it.Sex is not something that should be jumped into and if your boyfriend is pressuring you then i don't think he is the right person.He seems like he just wants sex just to say he has done it and he probably will brag about it to his mates.you seem like a really mature 13 year old and believe me when the time is right you wont have to ask yourself twice.enjoy yourself at 13 and don't be worried about sex.There is plenty of time .|`|OQ5ch42Aaa	Sweetie don't do it.I'm 13 and since I lost my virginity a few months ago I'm pregnant and it could happen to you so just wait.|`|alDqf8DAaa	Don't do anything your not ready for.  and look at it this way when hes 18 you'll only be 16, that's statitory rape.|`|M5hzHHvtaa	if your not sure then it means your not ready.  dump this guy...he is only with you for sex...your far too young to be thinking about having sex with anyone.|`|f4d3808a4153e9d4d066d3fc5cf67887aa	if your not sure then you are not ready. noone spends the rest of their life with the person they are dating at 13. get rid of this loser and find a nice boy who like you for you, not whats in your pants!|`|jRduMDOjaa	you dnt have to do any thing you want....if he cant respect you for waiting then you should not be with him..  hope i helped:D|`|RHSGYK31aa	ditch the a**hole. your both way too young, and underage pregnancy is a big issue these days. you're only 13, so you shouldn't even be thinking about this kind of stuff. go find a boy who has some common sense.|`|bed8QNUaaa	DONT DO IT!! YOU'RE 13!!!!    you said: "i'm not sure if i'm ready" --> that means you are NOT ready. you're never ready unless you are confident and 100% positive.    please don't let him get to you. and if he keeps pressuring you after you have said no- dump the fool. he only wants one thing.|`|VGJ8YpaIaa	Don't do it.  Tell him that you wouldn't have even considered it if he hadn't asked, so you aren't about to do it.  Chances are you're not in love.  And you'd be worried about getting caught.  It would be a bad experience.  Don't let him take advantage of you.  You're not ready.    Tell him that if he doesn't stop asking you, you might have to dump him.  If he respects you, he'll cut it out.  It's just that his hormones are going crazy (he's a 15 year old!) and he thinks he's ready.  But he's not.    Good luck, honey.  I know you'll do the right thing.|`|e539aIZHaa	that guy sounds exactly like someone you DO NOT want to lose your virginity to. i know this may hurt at this moment in time, but he will not be the one that you spend the rest of your life with, and for this reason you would have many regrets if you gave up and did what he said.  just because he wants to - that is NOT a reason that you should do it.  ONLY do it when you feel emotionally, mentally, and physically strong enough for ANY consequences that could happen - STDs, pregancy, him leaving you afterwards, regret. not to mention the legal issues - i'm sure you may already know this, but to have sex under the age of 16 is illegal in england. [not sure about america, presumably similar]  PLEASE dont do it just because of him, no matter how much you feel you love him. he obviously does not love you the same amount, no matter how much you do not want this to be the truth.. he wouldn't be putting you through this if he did.   i hope you find the courage and strength to stand up to him and say no, and please accept whatever consequences there are for this, but NEVER back down, have strength and follow YOUR heart and mind, not his. good luck! hope i helped (: btw, im 14 ! (:|`|tFbumBwYaa	id tell him off if he really likes you hed understand and he will probably still bug you but it wont bother him when you tell him no.    say no every time.  hell get tired of being told no eventually then he'll break up with you.    not exactly the most productive way to do it but you are waaay too young to be even thinking about doing that, there are so many risks, pregnancy all that crap, stds, etc etc etc.    eiher keep saying no and see if he stops trying to have sex and if he stops without breaking up with you he is worth keeping.  and you guys dont have to stop, you know messing around, and playing.  just no sex.|`|7ZSNOQDwaa	if in any doubt: don't do it. and that is so important i'm gunna write it again, DO NOT DO IT. cliche but you can only give it away once. also sex can be really emotional for people, especially teenagers when we've got the whole hormones thing going on. my friend had sex with this guy who is such a **** just because "everyone else was doing it" and she felt pressured but she totally changed after and got all depressed. there is no reason to have sex other than you want to. if you decide you aren't totally ready its nothing to break up with him over but just let him know that you don't want to and you're not gunna sleep with him until you are. only you know when your read (jeez how cheesy am i) so until you know you are, don't waste it XxX|`|QSodlfMraa	no means no and if he can not understand dump the loser!|`|NRldAzrpaa	if your asking this question then your not ready.

Don't let him pressure you. There is nothing wrong with waiting. There is a lot wrong with someone pressuring you.  13 is too young.       Besides, you think he isn't going to tell people he slept with you? He will, and then you will have that reputation.  That leads to a whole new set of problems.|`|YVRXdfGHaa	The boyfriend who pressures you to have sex is without a doubt a lousy lover and a selfish idiot. If he was a good lover, you would want it with him, and he wouldn't have to ask or demand. If you do have sex with this oaf, it is bound to be a miserable experience that you will regret the rest of your life.    This is the kind of jerk you don't need in your life. Get rid of him now, and tell him to come back in a couple of years after he has grown up and learned how to treat a lady.    I'm not going to tell you when is the right age or any of that "wait until marriage" nonsense, but when the time comes and when you are with the right person, they won't have to ask you and you won't have to ask yourself or us.

The best part of a realtionship is communication. Hope this helps.|`|QzokuJVsaa	For me, it really differs from person to person. For some people, it may take longer to get to know one another. Me and my boyfriend became "official" after a month, yet we had some problems had to break it off, and became "official again after 5 months!    I think youll probably be able to find the answer to your dilemma at Lisa Dailys site, http://www.datingexpert.tv   (Plus, theres a lot of good info there.) Shes the author of two dating books, HOW TO DATE LIKE A GROWN-UP and STOP GETTING DUMPED. Its one of my favorite sites for dating tips and advice, and the videos are pretty funny.    Im pretty sure she answers questions that are sent to her, you might try her for an answer to your question.
C1tRtjVNaa	My opinion is that  you should tell her. I you had a live in bf of 7 years and he was doing what this guy did wouldn't you want to know that he was doing this before you were stuck with something permanent like marriage?! She may be angry with you, but you didn't know and you should explain that first. You might think its not your place to say, but all the other girls hes been going out with could be thinking the same thing. One of you need to step up and tell her. You might break her heart, but its better than her marring the guy and then finding out and being even more hurt. Just do what you think is the right thing to do.|`|KifasiMraa	I wouldn't tell her.  Chances are she'll just get mad and say she doesn't believe you (even if she does).  Just stay out of it.  If he's taking his girlfriends out with his friends and stuff, she'll find out soon anyway. Good for you for kicking him to the curb!|`|2ea7f508e5ceee425b8e39e2ee78ab82aa	i would tell someone close to her to tell her the whole story,including you broke it off thought it was wrong but just didnt think it was your place to tell her, that way theres no confrentation. but i wouldnt tell her myself.
bT8Z4WI5aa	I'm kind of in the same place! I'm thinking baking my boyfriend cookies. You can never go wrong with sweets!|`|rI664Kybaa	Make a personalized pictured of the two of you, and then put it in a frame.    You could make a cool one with the site http://www.mirbit.com    If you go into the 'dragz' section, you can upload a photo (would be good to use one of the two of you) and then add stuff to it such as decorative frames (lots of good V-day heart ones), graphical items and text..and then it lets you turn it into a printable greeting card, email it, or save it to you computer (great for uploading to Facebook, etc.)    If you don't have a picture of the two of you, go into the 'cardz' section and you can choose from a ton of premade cards that you can customize with your own text/speech bubbles and then print it or send as an eCard.    The sites free and really easy to use--and the personal touch always means so much more!|`|Ngc0teBqaa	Guys (just like girls) love getting treats, and Valentine's Day is the perfect time to give them something a little extra-special.    Skip the store-bought stuff and give your boyfriend one (or more) of these Advice Girl-Approved Valentine's Gifts for Guys:        * Homemade cookies. Make them from scratch, wrap them in a hand-decorated box and give them to him at the beginning of the day. (That way he can share them and make his friends jealous of how cool his girlfriend is.)        * A mix CD. Burn a combo of his favorite songs, your favorite songs, and songs that you share (like whatever was playing when you first kissed). Then decorate the CD case with photos of you together.        * Tickets to a concert or sporting event. Bonus points if the event is on Valentine's Day.        * A drawing of his hero or his favorite band. (Or a collage or cool photoshopped pic.) Don't forget to frame it. He'll be mucho impressed by your creativity.        * A romantic picnic. Make a couple sandwiches and a special Valentine's dessert, and buy some sodas, chips and salsa. Throw it all in a basket and voila! An al fresco dinner for two. If it's too cold to eat outside, then unroll a picnic blanket in your living room.        * And for the guy who has everything, a coupon book. Make it out of construction paper (the cheesier the better) and fill it with coupons like, "Good for one back massage," "Good for one viewing of whatever movie you want," and "Good for one evening of hanging out on the couch playing video games with your friends." He'll never stop hugging you with appreciation.
upk2Hzeeaa	No.  You obviously have completely different values in life.  Have you tried visiting a ghetto with her?  That's the only thing that might change her mind, and even then, I doubt it.
IUlIixJLaa	I have heard of success stories, you just have to be very careful. When you first meet a person then meet them in a public place and bring someone with you. I had a friend from work years ago that emailed my brother a message for me once and they kept writing back and forth. They have been happily married now for almost 7 years|`|UjhWIrJ1aa	Sounds like a nice way to get attacked... I wouldn't do it unless you have someone else with you at least.|`|8tRY1U2Iaa	I actually met my lady friend (of two years - she's soon to be my wife) over the Internet, but it wasn't on craigslist. I didn't know you could meet people on there, unless they were selling you something...|`|XTy7mLAkaa	With all things, be careful.  Online dating can be fun but I think you might want to choose a website where a screening process is in place.  Someone just murdered someone when they met them on Craigslist so you really must be careful.|`|YqUUwQLmaa	Oh yes..definitely! Hard to believe I found my soulmate on a free dating website..not Craig's List though. I would advise getting to know them via emails, chats and phone calls before meeting and then ONLY in public..maybe lunch or something. It is exciting!     My soulmate was taken from me shortly into our relationship but I am a different person for having finally found him. He passed away 7 months into our relationship...but hey...don't hesitate on using these sites! Some of these people are as real as well...your soulmate! And no, you only get ONE of those!!     Best of luck and happy hunting!
a4da5109c8bdb18661f94827b55902d5aa	i think you should get him a card and a nice single red rose that should do the trick i think. get him to take you out for a nice romantic meal and see where you end up and you might give him what just a girl said!!!!! have fun xx|`|DQMriRuwaa	bl0wjob
dGL5xCrqaa	As anyone wouldn't respect a person who jokes all the time and can never be serious, perhaps a person can't fully relate to someone who is too serious.  There is room for both aspects and it's never a good thing to be too much on one extreme.  If people are calling you "serious" because you don't give in to their crazy young college kid pressures, then by all means, be serious. But if you think they're calling you serious because you're a bit too wound up, maybe you should cut back a bit and have some fun.  You're only young once, but that isn't an excuse to be CRAZY. Everything in moderation my boy.    I tell this to myself too though, I am 17, and people tell me I can be a Debbie Downer because I'm straight edge, and I say, people will accept me for who I am and those are the only people I will ever need in my life. But at the same time, that's no reason to go burning bridges.    Sorry I'm ranting.  It's okay to be serious, just know when to have fun too.  People will accept you and some people won't, not everyone is going to like each other, that's just a fact.    Best of luck.|`|IMwLfHQvaa	people probably think that yur not like as friendly.  usually serious people arent that friendly.  get a little loose sometimes.  break down that wall.  answer my question please. . .on my profile|`|JL4MowJLaa	there is nothing wrong with serious. just lighten up when the mood changes sometimes. serious isnt bad when it doesnt ruin other peoples fun moods.|`|ENYYtrs8aa	I understand. I'm 18 and get told that as well. Being serious isn't bad. Its actually pretty good. You should take it as a comment. I would. I find guys who are serious and mature, cool. Also, maybe you should try to loosen up. If you are dead serious and dont do anything fun then i see their point. Go to a bar. Kidding. They'll accept you for who you are. If they dont, then there not your real friend. I would accept you.|`|IsMkhAJ5aa	they dont think u will have fun. there isnt anything wrong with being serious its just sometimes people are immature and dont like ppl who cant take a joke or wont mess around. i find serious guys very cool. it shows they care. ppl will accept u and if they dont then tell them how u feel. but it doesnt hurt to crack a joke or to be laid back. its who u are and i hope ur proud of it one day u will be.|`|l4anfnt7aa	You have a legitimate gripe if people can't/won't just accept it. But consider this: your seriousness is only as useful as you make it. I mean this in terms of planning for the future, thinking about what you want to do with your life, and how you will start doing it, etc. But -- don't discount the value of having fun and just being happy. Each moment comes only once and its up to you to enjoy it. If you don't enjoy it, you're kind of doing yourself a disservice. There will always be plenty of time to be serious, but opportunities for spontaneous fun seem to get few and far between as time goes on. I'm not that much older than you (29) but the difference in my time, what I can do with it, and what I actually do with it is huge compared to 10 years ago.|`|FVYf8ZBGaa	i kno what you mean, im like that and im 16  theres nothing really wrong.
zuFJmLhgaa	You cant hurry it up, but if your on the pill you can stop in by taking two packs back to back without a break..|`|yzgS5KiQaa	You can fool around while on your period. Just don't go below the belt on your part. An stressing postpones your period. Since when we stress, we go into flight or fight mode, where the "unnecessary" bodily systems slow, an eventually shut down. If stress is bad enough, even your breathing can stop an you can die. This happens in cultures with great fear of superstition. This is also the reasons we gain weight while we're stressed, because our digestive system is off track. Well anyways, stressing will only postpone your period until you feel unstressed. My advice is to just relax, an track your period an meet at the times of month that you haven't been getting your period.|`|UspK4SQBaa	Two options:  Use a menstrual cup or get on birth control and skip the sugar pills.|`|EzgodvQOaa	im not sure. Maybe u could try going on the pill ?  good luck.|`|1ZWNmQ8Iaa	cant hun|`|8wXuf8gAaa	YOU CAN'T! Just wait for it to end. Sorry, but this is a stupid question.|`|BqxYa9tEaa	You can't hurry it up.  It happens and you have to wait for it to end.|`|vw4KXRlLaa	You physically cannot.  If you get on some types of birth control, they can make you have lighter/fewer/more regular periods, however there is no way to just "hurry up" a period, especially if it has already started, it's just plain impossible.    Even if you do start on birth control, those can take months to regularize your period, so you're really out of luck on this one.|`|oOR511mFaa	I know this sounds gross, but if you masturbate your period will go away faster. I dont know why, but it works LOL.  My friend told me this and i tried it. Lo and behold....|`|Z8Gzb331aa	You can't speed up nature...|`|4cc625c81315e3cc57858f7de7250b2aaa	Sorry but you can't plan a period around a get-together.  Your have to plan your get-together around your period.  Besides, since you feel ready to "share yourselves" (I know what you mean), if you are not on any kind of birth control (which would be total foolishness and stupidity, if you know what I mean), you are better off sharing yourselves when you are still on your period.|`|FxXaBd16aa	Well you can't hurry your period up.. that just isn't possible. The only thing you can do is.. if you are on birth control pills. You can miss your last set of pills ( the ones you take when you are having your period). this will cause you to "skip" your period for that month.    I would do this when i was going to visit my bfriend too. Not good to skip your peiord often I would only do it like 1 or 2 a year|`|Wy0lUjP9aa	Well you can't hurry up a period, the only way is birth control and that doesn't work for everyone or it might but it may take a while. The day you guys are planning to see each other are you going to be on your period? Did you count ahead of time, or is there a way you guys can pick a different day?|`|Ki90Irkcaa	Um you cant do that, impossible. But there are other things. Or you could just lay down a bunch of towels.... use your imagination. Nothing stops me from getting some if I want it!|`|70QRG1afaa	birth Control pills, talk to a doctor.|`|A86F9EhOaa	All I can say is birth control will stop your period and make it shorter, but it doesn't sound like you'd have enough time for that..|`|GfyovDF5aa	You can't make your period come any sooner but you can skip it if you are on birth control.  All you do is when it is time to take the placebo pills, throw the pack away and start a whole new pack.  That should stop your period from coming.  Hope that helps!

i6WVPncnaa	The way she acts around you.  She flirts with you a lot.  She turns around when you catch her looking at you.  She tries to make you jealous.  Some girls try to punch you, but playfully.|`|hCIAD98Zaa	At my view she does like you a lot :)  That's what I do when I'm talking with my crush .  except I don't say I get mad at him for ignoring me because   i'm too shy to show my feelings .    So anyways , just let it be  for a week and if you think she's acting like this still and hangs  with you a lot , it means she does like you . But in the other  hand ,she just likes you a lot as a friend .    So it's a 50/50 chance in this case .
qwveESAFaa	Stay at her house for now once in a while.  She just needs to grow up a little more.  In time she will want to sleep over.  I used to miss my Mom during sleepovers, too, but got over it.  It helped, too, when there were a group of girls together, not just one on one.  That way there was more going on to keep me from thinking about being homesick.|`|KFJJzLmTaa	Have a sleepover at her house. She needs to grow up a bit more. If it is because her mom is her only parent then it makes sense. Some kids who have an only parent might think that they are never going to see their parent again.

Then it will look like you with a gay guy.|`|0XdkbEtFaa	because there more friendly probably more girly some times more secure but they also have the attraction and probably a good style so there it is that simple im not gay but i treat girls really well im really into fashion and id never hurt a fly but hey thats me|`|DTUOvJm0aa	because gay guys are normally the kind of guys that would make the perfect boyfriends and treat you the way you deserve to be treated.....if only they were straight.|`|VxW3bAjzaa	Plus you don't have to worry that they just want in your pants.|`|AA11447210	Hopefully you like people for who they are, not just due to their sexual orientation. I have gay friends, but I don't like every gay person I meet. Some are kewl, some aren't (just like anyone else).    I don't know who the "we" in your post is, but perhaps you all have a stereotype in your mind of how gay men are and think you like that type of person. Judge the individual, though, not just what their bedroom habits are.|`|aAj4dSyuaa	I now how you feel. Something about gay guys are just really sexy. I don't know what it is, though. But, as much as I think one is hot, I know he'll never want me.

They are the most fun people Ever!!!|`|Jxkvk7NDaa	Well, they like the same things as you girls, most gay guys are very good looking these days, and they aren't afraid to say and do stuff many guys are afraid to do.|`|1hXr0z2Daa	because after he is done with a guy he throws em over to you and let's your hungry asss dive in for sloppy seconds
LqtD1uS0aa	all i can really say is to talk to him (one on one) and see where his feelings are at. you have to tell him too, and maybe it would be best to tell you feelings first, cuz he may be too shy or scared about what you will say. but if you find that he still wants to stay friends, then just stay friends. but that doesnt mean that you cant still watch to see if his thoughts change, cuz they may. just be on the look out, and keep searching for other guys. i hope this helps and good luck! 
LqtD1uS0aa	aww, im sorry that your struggling with girls. but its rather easy. being a girl myself (but im only 13, so it may not be the same for high school girls) i kno what i look for in a man...a boy. lolz, anyways, i look for these qualities:    -smart (you got that down)  -funny (once again, you have that)  -brown hair (i dont kno why, but i just love it)  -TIGHT pants (lolz, that will really get the girl's attention)  -gentleman (show me you have class, cuz i want to see your true character)  -writes poetry (or anything else thats romantic).     so thats basically it. but dont try to change yourself too much, to try to fit those characteristics. like it may be good to change a little, but not too much, cuz i kno a lot of girls who also look for boys like that. but as for talking to girls, i suggest that you never talk about sports, cuz most of the time, we wont care. maybe talk about local hot spots or tell them a story about a pet or something. even if its really pointless, she will feel like you are a good conversation starter, even if your not. or maybe in class, ask a girl for a pencil or something (even if you dont need one, just to get a conversation starting). you have to put yourself out there, in order to make friends, and talk with girls. but as for finding a girlfriend, i think you should repeat this quote in your head everytime you feel timid around a potential girlfriend, "love is all about taking risks". i remember a time when i really liked this guy, but i was too shy to tell him, and i kept repeating that in my head, so one day i just told him. we went out for a month or two, but its over now. but i never regret it. anyways, i hope you can find everything i told you useful and remember these points:    talking to girls:  -try to be funny  -bring up personal stories about pets and siblings  -RELAX!   -be confident, but not too confident    talking to guys:  -talk about sports  -act cool, but not trying to impress them cool  -joke around, be a little immature (at times)    finding a potential girlfriend:  -TAKE RISKS!    school:  -work hard, but dont forget about your social life!    i hope this all helps, and good luck!

Tell him that you don't approve of the frat and that he either stays with the frat or stays with you.  Hopefully he will choose you and stay away from the frat, but if he doesn't then you could probably do better anyway!

q3tIt6htaa	well when i was going through hard times I needed to be left alone. Some people deal with things a different way for instance you probably would like comfort if someone passed away and a shoulder to cry on. Other people like myself like it for everyone around me to not talk to me. He is going through hard times and he just need some  space but hey you can text him and say hey if you need anything let me know I am only a phone call away. That will show him that you respect him to leave him alone and he knows he can call you. Just try not to push it and call him cause it will just irritate him and its understanding to feel neglected but you have to put your feelings aside and just think that he will come around. Every now and then just check on him or text him just to see how he is doing and let him know you miss him and you will always be there for him! Best of luck

9DYiyQbGaa	It means that you gave them some inspirational words of wisdom or taught them something that enlightened their understanding and they learned something new from you. To not drop anymore knowledge, you must not give them your advice on whatever particular subject.
c3CxzUgcaa	Personally, best friends are "off limits" in the dating game. Things get way to weird, and it strains the friendship. I hooked up with my best friend too, and we rarely talk anymore. And it sucks.|`|uGIIR9Beaa	If you have experience dating and are mature and responsible, then dating a best a friend isn't bad at all. Usually knowing eachother well helps knowing exactly what both people can expect from eachother.    The claim that best friends dating always goes wrong is a big urban myth in my opinion, drawn by teenagers from overexadurated soap series and bad romance movies.|`|uVH046Fjaa	Is it bad to date your uncle?|`|rh12tX8Naa	It's not wrong, but i don't think it's smart. That's a risk of losing a great friend if things don't work out. You never know....they may end up being best friends again if they realize it's not working. I don't think that you should get involved in it.|`|CK0fFIPDaa	how old are you?  in most situations, yes it is a bad idea.|`|ZfoBpMxBaa	Sometimes best friends make the most successsful long-term relationships. You can reach being in love by starting with lust or friendship. In the end, I hope whichever way the relationship started, you'd be best friends with your partner. If your girlfriend doesn't understand that, she's in for a rough time.|`|cP9MoCc6aa	Every 'best friends' are different.  Usually its good if you date your best friend. Because then know how the other person acts, what ticks them off, what they like or don't like, all that stuff. Plus it makes it less awkward to some 'best friend couples' because you are automatically comforatable with each other. No pressure of being a perfect bf or gf you just be you around them.  Now that is just majority of the couples bffs.    Now the one's you are talking about may be a little different. That just means they aren't really the kind of bffs that date eachother. You know? Maybe they liked each other at first but its better off being friends so they don't hurt their relationship at all.     So the answer to your question is No, its not bad at all. It can actually be a good thing. But in some cases its better off being just friends.|`|AA10778911	i dint which do you per fer friendship or love|`|uQ4J21BTaa	Depends on the age. If you are young with no experience in dating others, don't do it. Wait until you both have dating others and once you get together, you'll appreciate each other more.
AA11785285	Maybe you two ought to think of the financial dynamics of 4.    Each will cost you $250,000 to age 18, which is about $1000/mo/each, less in the beginning, more later, includes no travel, no private art or music lessons, no symphony tickets, no braces  no rving.. nuttin' hon, just full bellies of cheap food, a computer or two, a cell phone, some dope in hs, and that's about it.  This sets your IRA's back a cool million dollars minimum.    And this will be  more than 2 decades of your life.    Additionallyl, your time to each  with 4 is spread rather thinly, unless you can afford to hire help with laundry, and housekeeping.    It is as well rather boring if you are a bright, educated lady to give up 5 to 6 years wiping bottoms, and playing chlldrens's games if you have the capacity to hold down a tuff, interesting job.  And no one ever thinks these children will grow up to be teenagers... none of us ever do....    So, just cuz you can, ought you?    And bayyyybeeees are not bonding, they are divisive.  into your cozy, sexy marriage comes this shrieking kid demanding more of you at 3 am as you are on the bathroom floor and you have no more to give.      We all get sold a bill of goods that kids are romantic, and that just isn't true... they are really hard work, and forever change the dynamics of your marriage...     You are no longer his sexy huss, your a mother.  He is no longer Mr. Erection, the stud, the man, he's a guy on lower testosterone, (he doesn't know it) the erection goes limp, so he's out trying to hustle some babe to see if he still has it....     Hon, it is almost formula... to the point now that 30% of white kids now live with just mom, and 62 % of black ones do, and every damn one of them were standing where you are exactly.    Ought you to have children?  Sure, but even better do some reading and find out how much you really don't know.    Once you and he start popping out babies on this planet, you owe to them the absolute promise to be ready to step to the plate, and be the best parents on the planet....bar none and no lame excuses.    Your children are worth your best efforts.  Be sure you know what those will efforts involve|`|5OXtsCv1aa	Stick to 3 its a fair compromise.|`|81wvN8Rraa	Sounds like you don't have any yet. I wouldn't worry about getting to four I would worry about getting to three. He may have changed his mind by then.|`|HDFsvJMTaa	Have the 2 or 3 and then go from there. You may want them too once you have the 2 or 3.|`|ivsYJPx3aa	How about 8 ...too late!|`|5ILdSx7faa	have 3 then start taking birthcontrol and don't tell him, blame it on him that he is not getting you pregnant.  Seriously you should have made this decision before you got married. My sister wanted 7 but after having 4 she was convinced not to have anymore.  Maybe after 3 your husband will be okay.  It should depend on what you can afford and how your lives will be effected|`|9JFnkCMfaa	Unfortunatly you prob shoulda talked about this PRIOR to getting married. First, is there a reason he wants 4 kids? I mean, how is he with the 2 you have? I guess if I were you, I would tell a lil' white lie and start using birth control when he doesn't know... and after some time, when he starts wondering why you're not getting pregnant, "pretend" to make a doc appt. then tell hubby that unfortunately you can't have kids anymore! Sorry - it's a tough one!!!|`|3ee8101ef611dcb2fe20c82dfe728d6caa	I wanted 4 when my husband and I got together (he wanted 1 or 2, but was willing to have 4 if that's what I wanted - he already had 1 from a previous relationship). After the second one, I decided I was done. What you want and what you get aren't always the same....Due to finances and complications with my second pregnancy, I was happy with my 2 healthy children and didn't want to test fate again..|`|T2PRG16taa	Since the mother is primarily responsible for raising the kids, it should be your decision primarily.  Also, it is your body.    The other side is how much responsibility is the husband willing to take for raising the kids.  How much time and energy?  What kind of job does he have, how much time can he spend at home?    Also, things change over time.  It is the situation, not the number that is important.    Best wishes.|`|O36qjj7Oaa	Nobody can tell you if you should have more kids or not.    That's entirely up to you and your husband.|`|IPb9zjL2aa	Dont start a fight over something that hasnt happend.  Have the 2 or 3 and then go from there.  I will almost guarentee that one of both of you will change how many you want.|`|8ac2e5cbdd946ee60c803052559873c5aa	I want to say that both of you are too immature to be having children, but that is kind of mean and judgmental.    So, try having one (if you must) and see how that goes.|`|afsanqjPaa	OMG sorry but how can people argue about how many kids they want? is like talking about cars!! Please, have one-two see how hard or easy is to raise them, see if you can afford more, is your job permanent? Do you have enough money put aside for rainy days? you should talk about what teams will your child joining, what will make him/her happy,talk about going to Disneyland, going to trips, what about babysitters??? You want your children happy, and you want for them to go to good schools, become someone successful!! Here is not about the numbers but about each child in particular, then each one is different, each one has different needs or desires!!!|`|napgiSmXaa	Hello Carrie U       Have two, if you have a boy and a girl leave it at that after all, there are only two types you can have a boy and a girl.       On a practical level if anything should happen,  between you and your husband and there are so many things that could happen God willing it wont but, stuff does happen.  It'll be easier to take care of two than four.  We should always concern ourselves with what we can do for the children before we think what they can do for us.  It's a nice dreamy almost gooey idea to have lots of children and in the old days of high mortality it was necessary to have lots of children.  Now less is more
1KajpBdaaa	if they care dam im screwed cause im uncircumcised|`|fk3TFlTlaa	I do not think it matters.    I mean the guy feels more if he is uncircumcised.|`|XzLUA7ataa	Girls shouldn't even know whether or not a guy is circumcised.|`|iZDsMCghaa	I dont, never did. My husband isnt and he is one scrumptious piece of meat!    Oh and LMFAO, no weird diseases. Its no different than a woman with lips. You have to clean that well, too. Its just a misconception.    Condoms never slip off of my husband. Tell your guy to stop buying Magnums, Kizzy.|`|AA11447210	It's fine either way, as long as he keeps himself clean. ???|`|8rLH4YNsaa	Nope i dont care. Means they are cleaner lol!|`|r3te0Bwkaa	the only bad thing is condoms slip off. other than that, i love it|`|zHX9tlnWaa	Most girls I know prefer men to be circumcised, but obviously there are women who don't mind.|`|AA11383443	My wife told me once a long time ago, she prefers guys that are circumcised, I am glad I am then.|`|9ca0dd365c32112f6eb2363790a5dad3aa	not really|`|AaNcSlV7aa	its not really an issue. as long as you are clean and dont have AIDS! eww. then its cool.     (jb being circumcised doesnt mean you cant have a baby)|`|0OGC6IIraa	its good either way.  seems cleaner when they are.. thats pretty much it|`|cFigSdt0aa	No. That's just a myth that is a reality with only a small percentage of women. Most don't care. Out of the ones that I know that have a preference, I find that American girls tend to be more in favor of a guy being circumcised and British girls tend to be more against it. It's a social thing more than anything else, but when it comes down to it, it really doesn't matter once you start getting it on!
s30Duwdraa	How about a makeover night?  Do each others hair, makeup and nails.  Watch chick flicks too.  And of course, pigging out is a must!    Your parents are brave having that many girls in one house.  Nobody's getting any sleep that night!      Have fun!|`|9Bw6U4jnaa	I Like Sleep Over...|`|kmLKKGGyaa	go tipi houses and have a sleepover and movies, pranks haha thats what i did just don't get caught ^^^|`|xCgGDcdIaa	mabye a slumber party ?|`|8vIFr5Asaa	sleepover party! or a pool party...|`|IdwbQTIaaa	Do a fiesta!  They are still young enough to enjoy a piniata, plus they'll feel grown-up if you serve virgin margaritas, pina coladas & daquiris.  Mexican food is pretty cheap, which is good for the economy.  I'm turning 21 next saturday and I am doing the same thing (with loads of tequila!).  If shes not into the fiesta theme, maybe manicures and facials?  Dollar stores sell all of the things you could need for party like that, and its a dollar an item!    Good Luck!|`|S3tVSDfaaa	umm you should play truth or dare and prank call people and DANCE and serve lots and lots of candy|`|nA8Qc4ZAaa	you could play spin the bottle, truth or dare, uhh i don't really know lol sorry im no help :( maybe a movie or something gossip idk :\|`|MbHwygxbaa	Well This isnt at your house but heres one idea:    Go the mall, and have a scavenger hunt, give each team 20 dollors and a list of things to buy, Whoever gets the most stufff on the list and stays on their budget wins, you can do more or less money if you want, Then you can go eat in the foodcourt|`|tKb7i5jtaa	Instead of the shaving cream in hand tickle, try spray cheese!
5DJzp6bMaa	Allot of People Get over it|`|GWRP3vLQaa	Cheating always changes the dynamic of a relationship. Always. You can choose to forgive, but you never forget.    But lots of other things can change the way people feel about each other, too. You can be married to someone who becomes sick, or is devastated by the loss of a parent, or because of problems with the kids.    No relationship ever stays the same through the years. That's why it is best to keep on working at it, as long as their is a chance it can be preserved.|`|9VhR1XwOaa	It's based on forgiving and forgetting.  Some people can do both  Others can one without the other.  No one ever really forgets.  They can give their spouse another chance, but if it's true love then it will always exist in the back of your mind.  He may think you have forgotten  But you'll always remember and no  You won't look at him the same way. You'll simply try.|`|pqZAhBLvaa	If you decide you want to stay with someone who has been untrue to you, you have to give it time, and they have to show you that you can trust them. Of course you feel bad when you think about it, but as time goes by it gets less painful. Also, they will have to deal with you being suspicious of them as well, and all the drama that brings. In my opinion, they should take it with a smile on their face.|`|cPpP4BZIaa	A relationship is based on trust , honesty and devotion. When the trust is broken , it would be very hard to forgive. Once a cheater always a cheater , are my thoughts|`|KL6zuNuuaa	forgiving and forgetting are 2 different things....forgiving you can do but forgetting you will never do and that comes with trust if you have not trust you have no marriage.|`|S8CZBCe2aa	I would only truly forgive him if I got to do a jig on his grave.|`|869a923e153dd118c958218801d84b78aa	You can FORGIVE him for cheating but you can never FORGET!!!!  Two different words, two different meanings.    The spouse must put up with being grilled on whereabouts without complaint, must be above board on everything going on.|`|81wvN8Rraa	I couldn't forgive my mate for cheating it would destroy all the trust I have. It was hard for him to get my trust to begin with so that would be the end.|`|AA11383443	A marriage can be like a nice car, when someone cheats it's like crashing that car, Then you have to ask your self do I really want to fix this or leave it, If you do forgive and try to fix it, it can be better than it was before, but it takes lots and lots of work, and forgiveness, it is not easy, They have to earn your trust again, you will never forget what happened but you can try to move past it if you love them enough.|`|ksqPjgEUaa	I couldn't. It's just not something I was able to look past. I tried with the first affair, tried to rebuild the trust & not feel so betrayed.   But, I couldn't the second time.   You know what they say, fool me once, shame on you, fool me twice, shame on me... I should've known better.   I hope you never feel that kind of pain.   We're good friends now & he's begged me to take him back- told me how sorry he is & how if he had to do it all over again...blah blah blah, but in my mind I will never look at him the same.   (Plus there's other stuff that he did that I couldn't live with. )|`|z5dN9B3Iaa	I don't think very many people "forgive" when a spouse cheats they just deal with it! You will never trust them again and every day life becomes hard to get through with out questioning their every move. I think it's best to cut the person off and let them move on to someone else since that is what thier actions have told you they really want.|`|5NKa5Y8laa	It is very hard to forgive a partner for cheating.  Most people dont forgive, they move on. The only way the relationship can continue is if you trust is restored.  Without trust, even if you said you forgive, it wont work, because every time some incident causes you to feel suspicious, you will live it over and over again, and you wont "move past it".   So he must be sincerely sorry that he cheated and hurt you, he must earn your trust back by being honest and open and accountable.  You must fairly give him a chance to prove he can be trusted.  If you have a question about something, he must truthfully answer, without either of you showing anger. If and when your trust is restored, then you will feel safe enough to truly forgive him.|`|wXV5GxJHaa	i could never. i think i would have to leave to be honest. i could never try to invest more love in that relationship if he had done that to me. i would never forget it. EVER. and if i did stay with him i would never let him forget it. EVER. and that wouldn't be a healthy marriage so i would probably leave.|`|AYDus3gTaa	It is very hard.  You do think about it sometimes and it hurts all over again.  It really takes a strong person and a strong relationship to fully move from that kind of betrayal.  You never really, truly, fully forgive/forget something like that in my honest opinion.|`|eDy3OkKwaa	It definitely changes the relationship but hopefully you learn and grow from it. First time shame on him if there is a second then I would consider letting him go. Sorry you deserve better just let him know you wont have it.Good Luck|`|AA11437235	i know a friend who was cheated on (a man) first time she cheated he took his wife back.  Then she cheated on him a second time with his best friend. In reality he gave her a chance and she stuck it to him again and this time even worse .. who gets hurt?? the person who gave her a second chance.. sucks huh|`|luKyK3Duaa	if my partner cheated id run, how could you be with them knowing they have it in them to sleep with some one else behind your back! they had no problems with doing it before they could easily do it again!|`|4Vr2zecWaa	ME? I would NEVERR forgive them. I'd probably WANT to forgive them, but i'd probably dump them and hate them. It takes a strong person,a strong mind. but once a cheater, always a cheater. you mihgt not believe that, but it's not an opinion, it's a fact.|`|95022b8a93402999302f760e35ffd0daaa	yes. It is possible. Think of how any people cheat on their spouses every day...flirting and speaking words reserved for spouses to other people...    It is possible to forgive, but to rebuild that trust it may take a while. If you watched LKL on Thursday, they interviewed Ted Haggard and his wife Gayle on her reaction after she found out that the husband was cheating on her and moving with some gay prostitute men.    If this woman had the grace to forgive, surely anyone can forgive. Read the excerpts of the interview at cnn.com/larryking|`|4rcxkrF7aa	Well if you have no problem with it you are a lot better than I.  They say you can get over it, but the main thing is people wanna look at what they did. When I was cheated on it was what I had done. They don't go looking for it if you get along and are a true soul mate. If you have the feeling you wanna cheat, you been lieing to yourself. You wont get over it and if you do, you talk yourself into not caring about them and what they do. If you have no self respect, go ahead and tell them what they did is fine. No problem, you want my sisters phone number too. Be good to yourself, you are all you got.    Boogie Boogie|`|gRLquASnaa	I am in the same situation funny. The bible says unfaithfulness is the only grounds for divorce however it does mention that great reward will come to the person who can work it out and forgive which did happen with me we seperated for 3 months and now back together after working it out. A physical act never took place but a grey line was played with.|`|Hd7tFHN7aa	you sound confused on if he cheated or not, and then is it more like trusting him maybe?    I learned a long time ago, "if you let a bird go and it returns to you it is yours, if it doesn't it has another home".    men are like that until they grow up and use the bigger head to do the thinking with all of the time.    trust is a good feeling and if you loose it, it takes time to get back with anyone.  Don't burn your bridge, but put a light on it and have it checked out and see if it is a good bridge or one that needs some work or just maintenance on your part.|`|504bb36f74e6a1d516b625e01829deb3aa	I've never had anyone cheat on me as far as Iknow.But if my husband did cheat on me I honestly dont think I would be able to forgive him.That is an unforgivable thing.|`|25eadcc10facd0cbddd68151cbc5f247aa	"nobody forgets where they buried the hatchet"
uttbqGB9aa	Sometimes we realize some things a little too late.    All you can do is show her how much you care for her, and how young you were not to realize.     But...its up to her in the end.     Advice: Don't stalk her, don't be way too mushy, and give her the space she needs. Also show her you are willing to express what she means to you if she will give you a chance.      Everything happens for a reason...just be patient...if not..there are many more that will go and come in your life until when you grow up...you will find someone to share your life...for now...have fun and live your young life.    Good luck :)

And being his friend the other guy is just trying to hold on to a friend. Are you going out with this new guy? you should talk to him and let h im know how your feeling and as for your ex you don't really need to explain to him but if you want t o just explain that you guys are no longer to gether and this guy makes you happy.
r3te0Bwkaa	tell him to **** off|`|DxohE884aa	Tell him you're not ready for a serious relationship.|`|XzLUA7ataa	He doesn't love you, he lusts for you.  There is a major difference.  If it was love, he would understand that you are not ready and he would be willing to wait.  A relationship isn't healthy when its pushed by one person or the other.  Wait!|`|pOLBKKNpaa	how do you know he loves you?|`|kWBXSjHXaa	what kizzy said show that b!tch not to fvck with you|`|a0b1f8c0a89f6e9a6fb1048bcf570db3aa	The answer is in your question.

If he loves you he'l wait, if you want him 2. Be honest!
lf4Qj1T8aa	If your friend told you a million times that it was okay, and now she's spreading vicious rumours about you, that makes her a liar, not a friend. You need to confront her about it and get her end of the story before you jump to any conclusions, though.    Ask her -- and make it clear that she has to be TOTALLY honest with you -- whether or not she REALLY cares about the two of you dating. If she does, talk it over with your boyfriend; a break-up may be necessary. If she doesn't, ask her why she's spreading rumours.    What she's doing isn't okay. You have to talk to her about it.|`|3y0w1qIBaa	Even though she is okay with you dating her ex, but really, she's not on the inside.|`|vRhk1VEfaa	If y|`|IWvJk4gCaa	Omg this same thing happened to be but I was the best friend.

The opther girl was my best friend of 12 yrs I am not friends with her or her whole group anymore. She just broke up with the boy and shes trying to be freinds with me agian. I still dont know if i want to be her freind. My advice is talk to her seriously about it and offer to break up with him. She if she gets excited about you breaking up with him, tehn you have to decide if you want him or her. That's what I had to go through. It sucks but personally i would chose your friend. I wish i had my friend now and when she chose the guy, it took me so long to get over i had to go through months of therapy. I hope you make the right choice|`|Wl8kWflVaa	You have absolutely not done anything wrong, but you aren't thinking.  If she was going out with your ex-husband, would you want to be invited to their wedding and their apres-ski parties and their bowling nights? Or would you want to stay as far away as you could get?Would you want to be there to comfort her if and when their relationship ended?
bcAjpf5vaa	i think he does like you. I mean think about it how many guys are like that? He probably acts like a friend because he doesn't want to rush it or is afraid that you don't like him, try giving him a hint.   But to tell you the truth when it comes to someone you want to be with, in the long run its better to have a friend. Because when the steam wears off (and it will) a friend will be someone you still want to spend time with.|`|ixHwF4apaa	if you like him have it or else leave him. do not have osilation of mind|`|85tAhnM9aa	All of those are signs that he likes you but I'm not sure if its enough signs to be sure.

IdlaZQ8Jaa	call a social worker and tell your story. the social worker will tell you what your options are.|`|zDmGngXVaa	More likely yes! I will more likely get thumbs down for this but if your really not happy with where you are and you want to be with your mother then their is 2 ways for that to happen!  I should know because I done it!  1. If you do choose to run away, your best bet is to inform your mother! Because your mother could meet you somewhere, so nothing bad happens to you! She will need to call her lawyer asap and inform him you have ran away and you want to live with her. Your mother could tell her lawyer how unhappy you are living with your father and with you being 13 you will have a right to say you want to be in the court room to tell the judge who you want to live with! And sometimes if the lawyer jumps right to it, he could end up speaking with a judge and get papers signed stating that you are to stay with your mother until a court date is set!  OR  2. You can inform your mother you want to come home, have her ask her lawyer for the judges address and write a letter to him stating you want removed from your fathers care into your mothers care. Explain to him how unhappy you are there. Or you can just write  your mothers lawyer the letter and she can give it to her lawyer and he can show it to a judge and something could be done.  The laws age is 12 now. So if you are unhappy somewhere and you want to live with someone else and they want you as well, you can request to be in court and tell the judge your side of the story!  Good luck honey and I hope the best for you!|`|cPpP4BZIaa	Who ever the court placed you with, you have to stay with them, unless the court orders differently|`|IPb9zjL2aa	Tell your mom, I do not know the NYC court laws but around that age you are able to decide who you live with.|`|81wvN8Rraa	You will be forced to go back. Talk to your mom about petitioning the court for change of custody. Just because your dad won once doesn't mean you will always have to stay. Now that you are old enough most likely the judge will talk to you about what you want and take it into consideration.|`|GHd84xipaa	question here is did the court find your mother unfit for you to live with her?there must be a reason for the mother not getting custody.your mother can petion the court for a custody change.they will do a home study to see if your mother is fit to have custody of.you can explain your case to the case worker that will be handling this case.tell them the problems you are having living with your father.i would not suggest running away,because this could hurt you more then help you.you can also go to your school counselor and get some advice.good luck.|`|95022b8a93402999302f760e35ffd0daaa	You may be taken to court and the issue may be discussed why you are running away...or...if you really want to live with you non custodial parent you may need to ask her to have the court review the circumstances. there may be a good reason why the court disallowed this.     Now if you play a rough game you may mess for yourself because they may deny your dad custody and your mum as well and you are taken to a home...talk to your mum first and see if there is anything she can do like taking the issue before the court fo reconsideration.|`|eDy3OkKwaa	You will need to give him a good reason why you don't want to be there, like verbal or physical abuse but otherwise you could end up in a foster home if you keep running away. Talk to your lawyer you have rights. If they wont let you be with your mom there must be a really good reason, usually they will their best to put the child with the mother unless she has been shown to be unfit. Good luck|`|S8CZBCe2aa	You need an advocate to represent you.  Talk to someone at school, tell them your situation and ASK for help.  If you run away your father will say that your Mother coerced you into doing it and it could look bad for her.  I don't want to burst your bubble but there must be a reason why your Dad got custody, are you sure your Mom is in a position mentally or emotionally for you to be with her right now?  Either way you need someone on your side!  Good luck honey!|`|Hizsm6m4aa	Convince your mom to get a court date. You are at the age where you can choose, but it will depend on why he got custody and not her.|`|a0b1f8c0a89f6e9a6fb1048bcf570db3aa	Let your Mother know. If you are as you say being:  1. neglected by your father  2. abused verbally or otherwise  the best thing would be to FOLLOW THE LAW  and not become a runaway...  You can refuse to go back during a visit with your mother  due to the   NEGLECT  and ABUSE.  This way, the court will revisit custody and you can live  with your mother. But my dear, you MUST follow the  law.  Do not runaway my dear. You know you are not property  so just pray for your Daddy. And your Mom and yourself.  Trust God. He sees and knows all. I'm praying for you honey|`|6EIdLkS7aa	I agree, talk to your mom and have her help you go back to court and have the custody reconsidered.  Also, tell your dad that you are no one's property and you would appreciate not being refereed to as such. ("My father swears it'll never happen. He's told me that he's already won custody of me and I'm his")|`|XExUVo0Uaa	Check with a counselor at your school. you may be old enough to chose which parent you live with. This is a very tragic situation were you are going to have to be more grown up than the grown up.

And I'd give to be 45 mins. from my bf...try like 15 HOURS|`|AA11663448	It sounds to me like he wants to keep his options open. If he was really into wanting to date you, he would make it work. 45 minutes is no big deal. If you really like the guy, try one more time. After that, don't waste anymore time. Move on and find a guy who wants to be with you as much as you want to be with him.|`|bc17920bbd922f6ed1772a53b96d7a6daa	Sounds like he isn't interested in being partners but doesn't want to hurt you, be friends but don't push the relationship further and don't let him have you as a friend with benifits or else why commit?|`|0cffb0d54c877fa6eb9647a9c45bdb7daa	no guy is ever worth that much trouble.  if he keeps making excuses about not wanting to spend time with you then he is not worth the trouble.  and in the long run if he does make time for you then you will always be on his back burner because he is makeing the time because he feels sorry for you.|`|AA12225153	Take a hint.

Well first off, I hope you aren't making yourself seem desperate and too into him because that could be a turn off.You have to not sweat a guy that you are really into. Play hard to get and distant yourself a little just so it won't seem like you are always available to him. Secondly, sometimes we over look what is right for us. Sometimes the things we want aren't made to fit you right. We sometimes judge all because of looks and other silly things.If you don't nail this Guy it is because it wasn't meant to be. Open up a little more.|`|c99fce2b76a8fad2b3a5ef3bf0c3caf2aa	that usually happens when one or both of you are not been 100 % honest......|`|AA12398499	you need to relax. you just want more from one guy so it seems like he is giving you less.|`|AA12374286	this the way of human beings .we always want what is hard to get|`|b54670bb572044080c1fc2273824a316aa	Be careful.

Too me it sounds like Paul is fueling this because he likes you.  Do you think Paul is secretly trying to steal you away from your bf?  You said he likes you, and guys can be snakes.    I am not saying he is,  but your bf thinks something is wrong with the picture.       I would never suggest that you avoid Paul altogether,  but if you want the relationship to work you must respect your bf's situation.  He's not sure, so do the things necessary to reassure him.   And if you find out Paul is up to no good,  bounce him out on his ear.|`|AA11688662	that was code for, i want some new ***** and i will be back if i cant find nothing better.|`|AA12347541	Talk to him.

AA11588361	because people like you are HO'S|`|AA10608381	Because it takes committment, understanding & true love for 2 different people to make it in the world, even if they truly are in love with one another. GOD made us all different, including in the way we think. It's not a sin or crime to be different or think in another way. Opposites attract, so they say. But true love is very hard to find, so therefore it is worth the "hardest to love" aggravation.|`|AA11485062	the nice ones.|`|AA11953621	It not the difficult to love just learning to  love is|`|AA11623890	Cuz sometimes those who we think are the right one for us, we may not be the right one for them. I don't know if that makes sense, but thats how I feel about it...|`|AA11213162	I will attempt  to answer, but i dont understand this question . I hope you get it. I think you mean the ones who are good people ,Why is that we get used and abused ,taken advantage of and they dont see that they had a good person until its gone? Challenge is at a low degree,GREEDY! SELFISHNESS! they are also very inconsiderate,|`|953616c8c0f2eb7a33643ec11754dae7aa	maybe because ure guts tell u this one is for real and that is always a scary thought, to come to terms with. and ure first..instinctive reaction or thought is run as far as u can  because i tell u when it is the right one...then nothing seems too big a thing to do or give up...and u fell a very integral part of u slipping away|`|AA12333104	I would think that it is because you want the relationship to work out.  You will put all your time and energy in the woman/man because you know they are the right one. In past relationship. maybe one person was just not into the other person that much.

I think I get the jest of it,  you want what you can't have. and are willing to do anything to get your way. am I close? use self control and don't text anything. you only dig yourself in a deeper hole. your desire to control compels you to try and fix the damage you have done. most people know all the games that others play and pick up on them fairly quick. anything you do will only show your desire to get your way. some people try and force that accidental running into someone and hope they will realize that they are madly in love with you and will tell you so. that doesn't usually work, only when it is truly accidental. thats why they call it fate, you can't force it or make it happen. bets thing for you to do is get your mind off this guy and on to something else. easier said than done I know,  but find someone else to stalk, it will take your attention off of him and you won't worry so much about the outcome. you can make a fool of yourself with nothing to lose, not even dignity. your ego won't care because you have nothing to gain.|`|AA12162812	if you think he is possesive. don't.  if you think he is just a nice guy, exhale (you really need it) and send him a textmessage.    But RELAX. and for future questions\answeres, the comma button, is to the right of the M button ;-)|`|AA10794366	dunno ..just make sure you use predictve text on your phone..cos your spelling is terrible|`|AA11311942	He seems to be dropping the signs that can't be read as crushing or as just-friends signs... Um. I'd definitely start talking to him, and if you do text him just say something subtle as well. It looks good, but it's pretty early in the game to predict the end. (:    Seems that he's either wanting to be friends or more. If you start out as friends something else may come of it... Maybe even a relationship.    Start out small. Work on it. Best of luck!|`|981e437e2c59c9d9c09595e1741e0bc4aa	Unless, you are extremely shy and or cant talk 2 him eye to eye for some reason, talk to him in person. Explain yourself, and why you acted the way you did, and see if any common ground is made/understanding. Maybe, every thing will be cool then, as for him wondering if their are any guys around it could be one of 2 things either he still cares about you and wants to be with you, or for some reason he thinks you are with some one else, or attempting to be with some one else, either or it would be because he cares for you. I cant tell you what to say, but just talk to him and be honest, if he doesn't accept it then whatever, move on.
AA10743825	shoot as long as ur not obnoxious i dont think any girl cares and as far as approaching a girl walk up to her dont be a jerk and do NOT  use any cheap pick up lines|`|AA11311942	In my eyes, a sense of humor is definitely the best weapon of mass attraction.

The fact that you don't need a man for the traditional reasons is daunting because you will have more control in a relationship and be less likely to compromise for them since your potential selection of men is so wide.  If you're having trouble meeting men, put yourself in situations where you do need them, somewhere where you'll have "beginner's anxiety".  For example, if you don't know much about sports, go to a sports bar and ask the cutest guy there to explain whatever game he's watching.  If you're not into tools go to Home Depot and ask one of the guys for help.  This lets the guy have both a feeling of rescuing you in some way and being admired as an authority on something.  If you pump a guy's ego up he won't mind so much that you could drop his punk *** like a hot rock any time you wanted.|`|51e98d2339c681282c39d1fef8983eecaa	No, those things don't scare men. What IS a turn-off is loud assertions of, "I'm an independent woman..." Guys want to be needed. If you give too much of a vibe of "I don't need anybody, I can take care off myself" it makes the guy think you don't even need him. Sometimes, when a woman does have so much, it can be a little off-putting because, just that, she doesn't totally need him. She's not destitute. She can survive without him. So, you've got to come across in a way that communicates, "Yea, I can take care of myself, mostly. But I do need a man for certain parts of my life." Because, after all, that is the actual truth, isn't it?|`|AA10263955	what you descrided only scares the men when you tell them about what you have ,,,,,,sounds more like bragging,,,,,,,   just watching some women the way they walk,and act around other people can be a turn off before they even open thier mouths!|`|AA11195049	in my opinion women that are unhygenic lazy rude arrogant.women that have airs about themselves who rely totally on their good looks to get by and women that dont have a go!|`|ef7d419d6a3d4dc93002265b3108cf88aa	successful women only scare away unsuccessful, loser, gold-digging men & what successful woman would want a man like that anyway?!  :)|`|8935c8eac41e44a1d2348ad0dbb5663aaa	turn-offs for me are: making a spectacle of burping and farting loudly and thinking its funny,spitting,picking their nose in public,cocky-tuff attitude,talking about opening a can of whoop azz on anyone,scratching their privates and not trying to be discreet about it,etc,etc,....you get the idea.........basically just bad social behavior or poor hygiene

I've totally become a better person because of these times. Now I know which people will fit with me best and I don't have to worry if they don't. Its made me better, more confident and I can just be friends with past loves. Its okay if you decide that its over, that person just isn't the one for you obviously. Don't dwell over the past.

AA11791594	You both may have gotten a little older but basically you're still the same people. What ever it was that split you up before will probably be there waiting to do it again. We can give you advice all night but in the end you have to make the choice. I can sincerely say that I've never gone back to someone after we broke up because of the reasons that we split. I knew if I did it would only be great for awhile and then fall right back into that same old pattern. You have to think if it's worth it to you. You said you didn't want to go through that pain again. Think about the reasons that you were on/off when you were together and think of the reasons you finally split. Has anything really changed except your ages? If you're really considering it, maybe you should make a list of pros and cons. Sometimes it helps to see it on paper in black and white.

Love can overcome any faults.    I would take it extremely slow.  So slow that he thinks you don't really want him.

9ea5e8dd576fe0621bb8f8f8c17c8e7baa	First, make a list of all the things you have accomplished in the past, things that you feel good or proud about. (small things count too)  Reflect on those things first. This will make you feel good and you will not feel inferior but will discover your path is unique and it doesn't have to be like others.   Second, make a list of things you want to accomplish in the future. Also, write down why you want to accomplish them. This will help you do this for yourself and not just "to look good" or to seem that "you have been successful" in the eyes of others. Be SOMEONE in your own eyes and you will become SOMEONE in other peoples eyes.
AA10182431	Face it, he doesn't love you, he loves to string you on.  If he loved you he would be with you.  You need to move on with your life and forget him.

MOST PEOPLE CUT THEMSELVES TO RELEASE ANGER, FRUSTRATION, SADNESS. BUT ULTIMATELY IT IS A SIGN OF SOME SORT OF EMOTIONAL DISTURBANCE THAT IS UNDERLYING.  I WORKED WITH GIRLS WHO WERE MOLESTED, ABUSED EMOTIONALLY, PYHSICALLY, SEXUAL, ETC AND THESE LADIES DID NOT KNOW HOW TO EXPRESS THEIR EMOTIONS, SO THEY CUT THEMSELVES IN ORDER TO "RELEASE" THE EMOTION THEY WERE DEALING WIT.  BE ADVISED IT DOES NOT "RELEASE" ANYTHING.  YOU NEED TO SEEK PROFESSIONAL HELP AND LEARN HOW TO DEAL WITH YOUR EMOTIONS SOON!|`|9ea5e8dd576fe0621bb8f8f8c17c8e7baa	Cutting is a real serious problem. What should you do? Of course, stop. Find something else to do than cutting. Do something you enjoy...listen to music real loud for example. Cutting is not the answer...you want to hurt HIM but you are hurting yourself. You are a worthy person and deserves to take care of yourself. If you dont, no one will. BUT YOU KNOW WHAT? The best thing is to talk about how you feel with someone you trust. This is something really helpful, if you dont have anyone, why not try and talk to God.

Of course, I ruled out the answer "42."    "Darn you. You sucked me in with your question, then I get here and I see 42 is already taken. Now we really have to go on a trip and I'm without a towel. Well ok, let me see what I can come up with, shooting from the hip as it were. My best guess is that the meaning of life, the universe and everything is "MORE". The quest for more seems to be at the center of all living creatures. All organizations be they organic or manmade seem to be trying to get "more". The universe itself is expanding, so I am told. As for "everything" anything that should happen to get created instantly becomes part of everything, so even everything seems to crave more. Yes I think I'll stick with the answer "MORE". What? Wait, just a minute, my wife is yelling something from the kitchen...... (long pause).....Hello I'm back again. My wife says the answer is "LESS" She says life is always moving toward death which by it's very nature is less life. The universe is made up of a limited quantity of everything and it is being used up also, so you have less now than in the past, and as for "everything" Well since everything gets used, you must have less of everything now than there was in the beginning. So my wife and I will agree to disagree and say that the answer is:  More or Less, or possibly More and Less. I guess that's pretty much the same as 42 because 4 is more and 2 is less. I'm getting a pain just behind my left eye from all of this thinking. What!? Just a minute, my wife is yelling again!........ I'm back. She said I'd better get off this Yahoo Answers thing and come to the table if I want any dinner. I told her that I'll never have to come back to Yahoo Answers again because I just pretty much summed up life, the universe and everything. I'd better hurry if I want more to eat and less yelling.

I think if there is nothing lacking, you shouldn't want anyone else.|`|AA12241722	Why would any caring and loving woman do that to someone she loves with all her heart and soul?    Of course, there are a lot of reasons on "why" any woman would do that or even think about it... no matter what the reason is, there's never "the better/best" reason to do so. It hurts everyone in the process like you would not believe... First of all, she's thought of as irresponsible, selfish and foolish (to say it lightly). Second of all she hurts both men at once--her boyfriend (who loves her and didn't mean for the "fight" to happen) and the other guy (who thinks she actually "likes" him, when it's completely opposite). Finally, if she of course doesn't give a flying-squirrel's-behind about either one of them... she'll do that regardless of what anyone thinks.    I've never done anything like this before, and never will no matter how rough the times can/will get. It's not worth loosing someone over something so follish/stupid... I've been on the other end, when a guy I thought cared for me, actually cheated on me with someone else... Let's just say, I wanted to shoot him, but then again... it was his loss and not mine (I broke up with him on the same day regardless of his excuses). It's a horrible feeling to have when you think you're not worth it or something's wrong with you, that made the other person to do something like this.    Thinking positively and looking forward to the brighter future here... I hope no one will ever cheat on anyone as long as they live, because it's not something that has to be done when you trully love someone with all of your heart, body and soul, but have some difficulty going over few things. Unless, of course, there are only few people who would do it regardless of everything and anyone else just to satisfy their own selfish reasons.|`|AA11986776	yea i did before and i feel really bad about it...and the reason y i did it was to get him to leave me alone and this person was my ex...so it was ok but not ok|`|03ede4c9444e0fc833bdfd03bc1505caaa	because there not happy with the man there with and rather than breaking it off they string them along as a safety|`|AA11105446	I did a few years back.

AA11525537	No, it's not ok.  From the sounds of it, she was at his house and probably screwing him.  If you don't think she would care if you broke up with her...GET IT OVER WITH.  If she's getting defensive with you, I would say it's Highly likely she's sleeping with him.  As much as it may hurt you to break it off,  it won't be as bad as putting up with this, time and time again.  You should always put your happiness before someone elses.  Life is too short to be miserible, especially for someone other than yourself.  Let her go,  it seems she's not holding on to you too tight if she's treating you this way.  There are too many women in the world to be worried about one.  If you have to worry about what you girlfriend is doing, she's not the one for you.|`|AA10936794	Break up with her it sounds like she could care less about you and your feelings.Get on with your life,enjoy it,life is to precious to waste time on someone like that.|`|7dd3d2f7ee3a54845f4ca950dbf65935aa	Tell her your feelings.

Ask her about how she would feel if the situation were reversed.|`|a61d40a33854fd55d37e2566e2f27d53aa	no if you and you girlfriend cant share everything then it must not be meant to be|`|4a8fc927213b84ffa2e3abcfffa18943aa	i think theres something going on. because me being a girl and i experienced that i know i hurt my ex by doing that to him. give it time or u know what to do|`|AA11827193	no its never ok 2 keep sumthing 4rm ur mate. u shouldn't have 2 tell them rite away but eventually the truth comes out so its up 2 u when u tell them.....|`|bd51a69c12de0b06931a212a6fac4c7caa	It's sad to hear, but she is probally cheating on you bro, dump her for a girl who actually cares about you and your feelings.|`|b3d5ffb3ab0b77eeebf5263c83c8dd7daa	this is up to you and yr feelings with her. do you love her or you feel that you need to move on.|`|37a3ec271ab4e028128ee791758163c4aa	no i dont think its good to keep things from a person because she/he will evantually find out and it will get worse its best to tell it straight up
d6fa4cb60aff30e6a5edbebc13f09c30aa	It is a very powerful experience if you hear that someone that you like tells you he loves you. However what you have to realize is  that some guys use this as a matter of getting a attention, snog, sex ..whatever is on their mind at that moment. And I m afraid he sounds like one of those to me. Actions speak louder than words. Forget him.|`|1bc65e81041a94a83201219edba453a9aa	If he has all this time to talk to these other girls but not you then there is something wrong with that. If you know these girls r just friends he should be able to make time to talk to you also. And girl just because he says he loves you he might not really mean it to some guys don't think this word love is a big deal to say.|`|c334bdc7c3b1eeaa07e837760fb59e3aaa	forget him|`|AA11611907	Forget him honey and move on with your life!!!!|`|AA10023685	Treat others the same way they treat you. If he no longer has time for you, you should have no time for him. Got it?|`|AA11280073	He's a player. Actions speak louder than words and his actions are a warning to stay away from him.|`|AA10936794	Forgive and forget.......then move on in your life.It's always good to forgive and it's not meant to be for the two of you,so get on with your life and be happy!!!|`|AA11514977	Jeez! I am sick of these teenage "does he like me" "what do I do" questions.    It is a TEMPORARY little relationship and will be meaningless when you look back on it later in life (stupid even). Get over yourself and your insecurities. All you little teenagers are afraid of each other and care WAY TOO MUCH about WHAT OTHER PEOPLE think about you. When you are a real grown-up, you care less and have REAL relationships.    Thank you|`|AA11904657	Move on in life.

AA12285971	i duno....ull find love some day :]|`|AA12389706	well have the one that you like then bye  her some flower and with the flower you send a note asking her out to dinner and i dont mean mcdonalds or a kids hang out i mean a nice place candle light dinner the whole nine yards but dont make any advance on her let her do it all because if you do it then it not going to be a challange to her and women like challanger   ok good luck.|`|d9ab400151d5d5c9cb7f274ca558d213aa	hang first. ask the intended "victim" to do something with you, something public and in a brightly lit area. this says two things: you're an honorable person and that you are interested in getting to know them. Keep your conversations light: as much as men are freaked out about the L word popping up to quickly, women are very suspicious of men who profess their affections too fast. talk to this person and show her your good personality, and establish quickly that you want to see more of her and that you would like more than the status of friend. It usually helps to ask them out again and set a date for a few days to a week later. this establishes that you want to date them, not hang like friends. Don't be shy, and be yourself. while you talk, though, watch her. look to see if she's really paying attention or just kind of answering you. ask questions so you know she's really engaged with you and answering you (and so you know you're not monopolizing the whole conversation). also, be wary if you can't get a word in edgwise. that usually means she's interested in what you can do for her, not with her. and listen for the "friend" signal. You will know by the second date if you are only a friend or something more. Generally women will not commit to a second date at the end of the first one if they are not interested in you as a boyfriend.    Keep your head, and stay honorable, and you'll do fine. Good luck!
ad62a775db1a9304ca057dfef0ae672caa	I don't really understand your question.  I have met lots of Vietnamese girls whilst in Vietnam and I don't think that you can tar them all with the same brush. Sure, some girls will be looking for a westerner to look after them financially, but can you really blame them? Coming from somewhere where women have to work really hard just to get by, it must seem like a great way out to get with a kind western guy who will look after you.   I think you should remember that they're not all like that, most vietnamese women are good, honest people. Besides, women from all nationalities cheat, not just vietnamese.|`|AA11200878	Nope, no Vietnamese girls here...
cc74dfdd50e575c62b9f39eaceed730faa	Hope you didn't give her any $$$. Cheer up, you'll forget about her eventually. She doesn't even deserve someone like you.|`|82cb6a6b94699722bb6be36daf838cfbaa	i won't lie that i've wanted to marry someone and then this happened  to me, but i'll say something. Well i really liked this chik and discovered she wasn't into me as much.. so what did i do? i blasted her and wrote her a really nasty letter - i totally lost it despite being told to relax and let it be. Don't make the same mistake i did, be the bigger man. Sure you lost her, but luckily you didn't realise her true nature after you were already hitched. i don't knwo if what i've said makes any sense but that's as much as i know. just pull yourself together(easier said than done) and pray to God to give you a worthy life partner. she is definitely not worth your commitment if she could do that to you. be strong man, you'll pull through with some determination, prayer and patience.|`|AA11655685	that's too sad, things like that happens but these things and experiences will make u a tough person,  just continue doing what you're doing, i've been hurt too, dreamt about him every night, think about him everyday, but i just do new stuff to forget him, to overcome what i feel for him so i have new feeling to feel, i tried roller coaster(for the first time), visit new places and i prayed hard, when i think about him i pray, it helped and you have to help yourself too..goodluck|`|AA11623890	WOW...It's gonna be hard to get over that one. It's a very hurtful situation. You may actually have to go through counseling or something. This is serious. A lot of people don't think this, but disappointments in love can really cause a person to lose their mind. Honestly, you should seek professional help. My heart really goes out to you...If you ever need someone to talk to, I'd be willing to listen...I'm a psychology student right now and I haven't yet obtained my degree. However, counseling and dealing with people are my passions....I can be here for you if you need someone...My email is stac22adji23@yahoo.com. Feel free to contact me...|`|AA11899777	she was wrong not to letyouknow but you must move on continue to date there is someone out their that will make you forget first you must want to let go sound like you do not have you tried to be friends is that an option|`|AA10796620	They say that it normally takes half of the years you two were together to move on, that's the average.  But don't wait for 3 years for you to move on.  The fact that you're working on it means that you're on the right track, it may not be easy, but being in the right direction means that you will be out of it soon enough.  Six months to get over six years of relationship and with a deep commitment on your part may be a short time still.  You just have to go through the process so that the pain may be released.  If you're dreaming about it, then, it may be that your subconscious is releasing all the pent up feelings and that means that you're on the road to healing.      Practical things I do to get over a broken heart - silence, time alone, prayer, journalling, meditation, thinking things through over 3 questions like 1) What did I do wrong?  2) Is there anything that I could have done differently so that the separation or break up could have been prevented?  and 3) If I have done nothing wrong and I know in my heart that I gave it my best shot and the fault did not come from me [maybe, he was not just the guy for me], what life lesson can I get from this experience?    Now that I'm getting better emotionally insofar as pain is concerned, I find out that watching movies, travelling, curling up to a good book, singing at the top of my lungs LOL!, physically straining myself in work outs and badminton, hanging out with girlfriends, going to the spa [best remedy for girls ever!] and praying really, really help.     Good luck!  It's hard, but just think, if you married her and she leaves you the next day, you would have spent for an expensive wedding and annulment - that's expenditures times two.  At least, you got spared.  Tomorrow is another day and you're still here.   :)|`|b9a25e0d3e644235a89b321fd895e151aa	You should have told her your plans before making life changing things (like a job) for anyone (that only works in the movies),    however see if you can get transfered to another company site (so you wont have to see her). And if your obsessing about this problem you might want to talk to a professional about it (to help you cope with it).|`|7c7622e371b21e8bc6c679e7085921b0aa	r u gay|`|3e398652752ecf8a2d9992cef1c61feaaa	Got to just find your own spot to go to when everything starts running through your head. i felt this pain before too, and it hurts again just reading about it but now you have to think about yourself and family.    GOOD LUCK|`|75f8ed5a8a1403bbafb2cb5ea2f6a21daa	I am so sorrry! It is going to be a very long process for you to get over her especially when your so called best friend stole her from you.  The best thing for you I think is for you to get out there and date other girls because even if your ex wants you back if you take her back she will just screw you again in the end.  I would stay away from her at all costs.|`|AA11430368	Maybe you should get a new hobby, try to get out there and meet new people. A change in your routine can make all the difference, if you go to a new place, say learning to skate/play hockey (if that's what you're interested in) You will meet other people who are interested in the same things as yourself.
AA10628572	If you don't even speak to him there is no way he could know.  Men cannot read our minds even though we think they can sometimes.  He's probably just embarrassed because he's getting teased in front of a girl.  I remember when I used to think that maybe a guy liked me but then came to find out he didn't like me at all.  Sometimes we just think that because we want it to be that way so bad.  I was the same way you are, and I know it's really hard when you really are so attracted to someone but feel so shy and scared to death that you cannot say a word to them.  It's hard isn't it.  It's one of the ironic things in life....when we find someone we like we can't say a word to them, but someone we aren't interested in at all we can tell our whole life history to.  It's the pits.|`|f8745dc9fda9697fda3ef5eb79c9cb84aa	He knows you like him..you know he likes you..some simple words in a easy cool way with a smile in your face will let him loose enough to propose you for doing something together.Then it will show how things will go as long as you show him clearly what you want..|`|AA10169701	The only way to truly know is that you must catch him (or have one of your friends observe him) glancing at you.  A guy could go on for years having a crush on a girl and not show a hint of it.  Glances are a dead-tell sign that the guy has a crush on you.  Also it helps if you have a friend of yours mention your name in a conversation with him and see what his expressions are like.  G'luck.
AA12389466	there r signs to find out|`|AA12261483	Yes, she loves you.  Most people find it embarrasing to say "it".|`|ec76863618ac85a9c7fa792ee01966baaa	Some people are scared to commit. Maybe she is one of them. It's a matter of time, to realize if what you are saying and feeling is true. If you guys haven't been together that long, and have not been through tough times, you will both understand what love means some day. Usually what people do, is what counts. Words are not everything. Don't throw that "Love" word around. Show it to her some other way. She might appriciate it.|`|9ea5e8dd576fe0621bb8f8f8c17c8e7baa	Genuine love is more than just affection or sentiment. It consistently acts in the very best interests of others ...     Check out this link for a great article! Enjoy!|`|6d06f71873c42208146f9af498b2b4c4aa	Bottom Line: Love is a *****. In my 23 years, I've come to realize that love is something that cannot be expressed in a three word phrase. Love is when that other person is constantly on your mind, and you can't shake those feelings. Love is being able to put up with the other persons bullshit, and still cuddle them as you lay together. Love has different meanings for different people. Maybe your GF is ready to fall into love's grasp....Just like my home girl Mariah said..."Love takes times..."

Actually it's sick to think you'd even want to do the nasty in a cemetery.  Doesn't say much about you and your DEAD END love life now does it!|`|b57fd060c6deeab88fde76ec23ed4edbaa	I think it is not right to do so.     A cemetery is a place were people go to visit their lost dear ones...     For me it would be inconsiderate to do that - inconsiderate because you can have sex in every wood, garden, park you like as long as you are not seen - but there is only *one* place for the mourners to got to.     For me having sex in a cemtery is like having sex in the home of a stranger, it is misbehaving, it is inconsiderate. In the cemetery the deads and their families are the habitants of this "home".    And you are a visitor who misbehaves if you do not know your frontiers.    It disturbs the peace even if you do it at night - a cemetery is a place where it should be peacefull at every time of the day and night.     If I want to go to "visit" my fathers grave at night - and I sometimes do - I would prefer not to be disturbed by some people having sex nearby.    Addition: For me it has nothing to do with prudeness or anything like that (and by the way: having sex is not "doing the nasty" or being "dirty" - sex is natural and normal). If you want to have sex outdoors, it is ok for me. But it depends on the circumstandes and a cemetery is definitely not your place to go for something like this.|`|ac77bcd47ea4f54c65c01c5882023c79aa	Legally yes, because if you get caught, it would be public exposure and lewd conduct.  You'd get fined.  Morally, who cares.  These people are dead.  It's not like they're gonna know.|`|AA12399460	Of course it is wrong!  You disrespect the dead and their families.

If he goes a little bit out of the way for you again he cares.

AA10909400	yes i believe that we are at the end of the worlds. But seriously, i study the bible for many years 20 years and all i study about the end of the world is presently what we live. The Bible describes events  and condition that mark this significant time period. "The signs" is a composite one made up of many evidences; thus it's fulfillment requires that all aspects of the sign be clearly in evidence during one generation. The various aspects of the sign are record in your own bible. If you want just go take your bible to see what is write inside in Matthew chapters 24, 25, mark 13, and Luke 21; they are further details at 2 timothy 3:1-5, 2 Peter 3:3-4, and revelation or (apocalypse) 6:1-8. By the way of illustrations, he will consider a few outstanding portions of the sign. When you read that in your own bible it look like the new from a news paper, so i mean it's what we live everybody in this time.But God don't destroy everything because the earth is not our planet but he created that for us. But people don't use correctly that nice gift. so God will destroy only people don't want make what is good for us. But people are blind and they don't recognize that last day sign. But me i believe it like you and i  try to do my best for inform the people to take care but they don't see or they don't want see.

If he is a player he may like you enough to change his ways. Maybe he's not a player. Give him a chance.|`|AA11312244	well why listen to every one ,  ?  if  thats wat you want and like ,  then study him and go for him ,   but keep ur legs togethers okay or you  is going to let his palyer statistics show up ,   if really he's one ,......|`|964645c1c1b062687b126162af7663e6aa	It is completely your choice.|`|44e72229fe9240618facb9273f10c3a8aa	follow you heart... lol|`|938ec521666d99d8a714f00b93e6e4edaa	you dont want to do that. you are asking this question which means you are concerened. players hurt you walk away and dont care. let me tell you all they want is to use you. and usually if he seems like a cheater he is a cheater!|`|1a796e643a0346ddb656548a38c59c06aa	if u feel like u gonna have fun in ur relationship, then yes!! and hello, who cares what everyone thinks!!!!!
AA12272804	ur so cute i love u already...! lol i would definetly start to get a LITTLE more flirty with her...like soft touches once in a while..then after she flirts back u could gradually start to flirt more with her. u will for sure be able to tell if she wants u back..|`|AA11909619	dude I know exactly how you feel...I am not lying when I say the same exact thing happened to me...the same exact thing and I missed my chance because know she has a b/f...and I went through six month of the most miserable time of my life...dude just kiss her...it doenst even have to be good timing...just pull the moves on her..and your gonna look at this and say...I cant do that...but Im telling you...someone told me to do the same thing..."just kiss her". I can still hear my friend saying that to me...then whne she got her b/f and told me how he did it...not only did she say he kissed but said maybe if I had done that she probably would have fell for me...you have to do something extreme so she knows your serious..because I dont think your gonna be able to save her life or anything in the near future.|`|dcdd8d78bca511d63c2f4c331850ca8daa	You can't make someone like you so all you can do is tell her you like her and just go out of your way to do things for her, and instead of coming over to her house to see her brother come over to see her for a change or call her and talk to her instead of her brother... make her feel like she is really special to you... how old are you?????? Don't get hooked on one person.... if it hasn't gone ne where in at least 6 months then you gotta move on... hope everything goes well.... good luck|`|AA11670461	well give her some time...your like a big brother to her soo it must be odd for her right? but give her time she might come around and that is sweet of you...keep it up..!! good luck|`|4d042402e1c5af07bdab485651780b8baa	Show her that she's really special to you and you don't want to hurt her like the of the jerks. Buy her flowers,ask her out to a movie,if you some her favorites pretend as though there your favorites to and ask if ya'll can do them together sometime. Give her compliments girls really like,show her the way you feel.That's how I like a guy to come on to me anyways it'll work watch and see it takes time,but it'll a work.|`|4ed8991fb852f284140474e6fc7db171aa	Hmm.. If you wanna get her.. Get it the way the jerks get it, I'm not telling you to screw her, don't ever before you 2 are together. You have to look like a jerk but not doing what they do.. A bit difficult to describe but i feel you shouldn't shower her too much love if u wanna be with her.   My feeling is that she like guys who are challanging, try to give her attention on and off (like a jerk) then propose to her suddenly, and dun give her a chance to put u off.. Tell her to tell you her decision that day by tricking her humourously like i though 1 min was enough for u to make the decision.   Trust me! let her put u off the 1st time and the next time u ask her again same thing happen. This gal probably afraid to take risk of being ignored. This explains why she had so many failed r/s. All this while dun engage anything sexual, she'll be surprised why you r so different from other jerks.   If let say you 2 are together and have the 1st sexual r/s, let her know how much u cherish her and so so diff from other ppl. Make her promise that she also love u this way. See how she react.
AA11633498	You are only 14, I get my first boyfriend when l was 18, this doesn't mean you are a lesbian.|`|5c4055e83463b6b6860269f01694ac7aaa	tell her you are not and how you feel|`|AA12375639	She shouldnt be putting such pressure on you and labeling you.  You're 14 and at the age where you are just learning about your self expression, style, attitude, etc.  Mom needs to back off and let you mature and be who and whatever you want.|`|b5466d5b4ebacb77913136a41486ab4eaa	"punk-emoish person" "tomboy"    its seems to me that you are classifing yourself based on general ideas of society. instead of trying to be a member of the "punk-emoish person" group why not just try to be yourself.    most moms that I know don't want there daughter dating at 14    finally, if you want to get her off your back, try just going out on a date with someone that you know, or tell her its a date and just go out to hang out with a good "male" friend.     also, if you want to make her day, ask her to go shopping with you to buy a nice dress or outfit or something to wear out with your friend. accept whatever she picks regardless of whether you like it or not. this will make her fill needed and happy for about 3-4 monthes.|`|AA10989993	Does she ever hear u and your friends discussing boys that might help...and supporting gay marriage just means your open minded about things..That really sucks that the cheerleaders get all the good boyfriends though...maybe u could double date with some friends or something...  Just tell your mom your not a lesbian,your shouldn't have to convince her.If she won't believe u thats her problem.|`|AA12068794	Well you need to ask yourself does it matter what she thinks. Why should you have to convince her of anything? I know that's sad to say because we are born with a will to please our parents. But, you seem to have a strong sense of self and have a knowledge of where you want to go with your life. So go for it and NEVER  let someone put you down or say rude things to you or about you. You don't have to be disrespectful or rude, just take a stand for yourself.    She should be proud that you're a strong-willed person who has a mind of her own. She should be happy you're not out being a hoochie.|`|AA11264831	Don't give her any reason to think that.|`|58b386cdf4b57cc99e1d27e5a02a1320aa	Thats so rude of your mom.  Your only 14 for goodness sake.  Just tell her what you just said.  She might actually be proud of you for having such a mature outlook on relationships.  Wait as long as you want....|`|94c5fa96eb8ad202da9d7fdaaeabc9e1aa	just tell her you arent a lesbian an if she loves you then she will believe what you say  ps: everytime you see a hot guy on tv in front of your mom say "wow he's really hot"|`|AA11111130	Don't worry about it. Just be yourself. If she thinks you're a lesbian, she thinks you're a lesbian, YOU know that you're not, and when you're in college, and walk in with that oh-so sexy intellectual man that makes your moms jaw drop, you can smile and say "toldja!" But until then, don't sweat it girl. Men are over-rated anyway, and at 14 there is so much more in life than finding a "boyfriend". Let the cheerleaders have them, I promise you'll have more fun later in life. Keep your head up!|`|AA11527793	maybe u can sae "mum..do u realli wan me 2 haf a bf? den maybe me n my bf will haf sex den at the age of 16 i'll b a single mum n u a grandma! Hw wld u lyk tt?!" i'll bet she'll back off aft tt!|`|9645732ac44e61d3e67e13266275eac6aa	Have a sit down talk with your mom and explain to her how you feel. Let her know that she should be proud to have a 14 year old in 2006, that have other interest than sex. She shouldn't make snap judgments based on your opinion.|`|AA10451558	Tell your mom that you have to be having sex in order to be labeled as homosexual or heterosexual and you are not.    Tell her that she can be proud that you are more interested in getting a good education now and learning more about yourself than getting involved with complex relationship issues with some immature young man.    I'm proud of the plans have for yourself. Keep with your goals and you will have a bright future.|`|AA12121778	The lady doth protest too much, methinksHamlet     It is obvious you are not a Lesbian. If you were, you have had many chances in a fit of anger to declare your sexual preference to the antagonist(Your mother)    The problem is your mother. She is teeming with prejudices and stereotypes. She is using your teen lifestyle as fodder to feed these social taboos of hers.  She views her world through tainted glasses and no one can change her one-track- minded beliefs/views.    My advice: Do not protest anymore...let it slide. On the intellectual level, your mother is fathoms below you.    In time, when you marry your prince, it will all come out in the wash. You will probably say to her then" to think, at one time you thought I was a lesbian." Her response? She will probably shrug her shoulders as though her crime was no big thing.....but you and I know better, don't we?|`|AA11837455	Sit down with her, give her a cup of coffee. And tell her straightaway that her misconception is wrong and that she should trust you as you respect her.|`|AA11945315	well,what you can do is go out with any guy to prove to your mother that your not a lesbian or just tell her that your not interested in dateing right now|`|AA12212738	My mom used to thing that about me too, I'm 25 and never had a serious relation, and most of them my mom was never aware because I don't trust her, don't worry about that, I know know that her coments can hurt but don't listen to her, don't argue, the best think to do when she comes out with one of those comentaries just say something funny like " Mom I'm waiting for Brad Pitt to divorce again" or "The true is I like older man, I'm inlove with a 50 years old man" with time she will stop because she will know you will come up with some stupid answer.|`|e62a516264a31d2749dfe1b2ac97021aaa	Tell your mom that just because you think every one has the right to be happy it dose not mean that you are a lesbian. And other than some people you are your own person and have better things to do in life than run around looking for a BOYFRIEND!|`|AA11996979	Try not to let it get you down. I think that being a teenager is hard enough without adding more stresses. Your mam is being very insensitive considering your age. You're only 14 so why does she feel that you should have a boyfriend. I was a tomboy when I was your age and I wasn't allowed to date until I was 16. My parents thought that my school work was more important.   You seem to me as if you've got a good head on your shoulders and have your priorities right.   I'm sorry if I sound as if I'm disrespecting your mam, but, she is ignorant if she thinks that supporting gay marriage, being a tomboy and not having a boyfriend makes you a lesbian.  Try talking to her calmly and rationally. Tell her how you feel when she makes nasty comments about you. She shouldn't do that to any child, least of all her own.  I wish you loads of luck.   Take care.|`|bf41181b87eabeb8877a0062601fbc84aa	my mom and all my sis's think i am a lez cuz i like t.a.t.u . just tell her how you fell.
AA12173899	Some people have been married for years and still do not know their partners.  There is not a time quota,every thing depends on how well you know your partner and how well you get along and how well you work together because while marriage is a great thing it also requires a certain amount of work to make it successful marriage.As I said no set time just make sure you both have the same goals and interests. You can communicate a years worth of information in one day if your open and honest and share you feelings with your partner.|`|AA12054357	I think at least a year or so because that's a big disunion and you don't want devours that bad because if you have children  then it really hurts them    Trust me i know my parents are split and have been for 5 years and i still cry at night about it so wait at least a year okay it just better that way because you know them better okay     Hope things work out.  And i hope i could help bye bye.|`|53a36f4f7433e80c38dde3d5da74018caa	Depends on the people, My Grandparents knew each other for 3 months married, and have been together for 60 years.

af7adf0aa7873cea9124408110734291aa	Personally, I'd say you're better off not going there.  If it's just the two of you, things could get out of control and you might end up doing more than just "making out" and regretting it later.    Call me old-fashioned if you will, this is coming from a 22-year-old virgin, but it will be rewarding once I get married (in 27 more days!) to be able to say that the first time I give myself to a woman, it will be my wife.    Just be careful...|`|23108fe4a4a865838abc75560d21ee82aa	Making out is natural, anything more, is stupid!  You are in 8th grade, you CAN get pregnant! Are you ready for a child??? GOD, you are all in such a hurry to grow up! What for??? It gets worse when you get older!!! Sex does not make you grown up, it only make you pregnant and on welfare for the rest of your life!!!  Don't be in such a hurry, just let it go, you'll have plenty of time to worry about all that other stuff when you are rEADY!|`|6a2b27e8aa977e232f4907d388ad106baa	Well, I would be mad if my daughter did it, but I would make sure not to go to far. Especially if you are unsure about it.|`|AA11994960	think girl|`|9a7f113049b075025452f69fc4903c6caa	Ask your mom.|`|07ab9d93f7a3e7001e126c92153a59dbaa	First off it depends on your definition of "making out".  To some people this just means lots of kissing, to others it means a lot more than that.  If it's the first, I don't know what is "ok", but I did it and I don't seem to have any bad effects, however it can be very hard to stop at that, so definitely be careful not to get carried away.  As someone who remembers what it felt like to be a very horny teenage girl, I'd say it's probably best to limit the time you spend alone at this point.  Also, don't let guys pressure you to do anything you don't want to do, and don't worry about what you think your friends are doing with their boyfriends either - they are probably exaggerating anyway.
AA10530337	I would. Just do it. Never know she might be thinking about you too.|`|AA11390011	sure, why not!

AA11314617	Actually, many animals do practice homosexuality.    And some animals actually have the ability to change their sex if there are too many of one sex or another.    So I guess your intelligence had led you astray this time.  A little more research next time.|`|7cdd4afadeb786cbae784477a7352aeaaa	Animals do practice homosexuality. You need to look around, humans are not the only ones. The latest story of animals and homosexuality to hit the news was penguins.|`|30a530865e269ecb217a7f11a72867d8aa	Well, maybe no.  In old Rome hundred years ago were a lots of guys. That means that it is not somthing new. I think that nature somehoe regulate the number of people on earth.
AA12219965	No - - if he is telling you this and you two are yelling at each other, you are not in a healthy relationship and you two need to break it off asap.|`|AA11992413	The only time I've been called a bad girlfriend, is when I get tired of their sh*t and kick them to the curb.

d2ef06f41db519be6a59ead58942c215aa	you don't think of it as a "getting over" situation. you think of it as a "coming to terms" kind of thing. I still love the two men I've ever been deeply in love with, and we're not together anymore, but I have come to terms with the fact that what we had in terms of love have come to a close, but we still respect and love eachother as people. it still hurts SO much sometimes, but its so much better to reconcile your feelings with someone rather than either by hating them and making what you had out to be cheap or unworthy of your pain, or pining away for them and never giving your heart a chance for closure. just take some time and listen to what you really need now, and not what you think or wish you still had with this person.|`|d3422f90292b41c6fdbdf6ff86da20adaa	Try and keep yourself occupied. Find and do the things you enjoy. While you are doing these things you will find others that like to the same things and then have opportunities to start a new relationship based on similar likes. The new relationship is usually the final stage in getting over a deep love. Of course this is easy to say, and not necessarily so easy to do, and it takes time for feelings to subside. But, believe it or not, they will subside, and will do so much quicker if you keep active, maintain a positive attitude, and be open to new people. Good luck.|`|f15ffca2c2db285af32c3ee264bd6f9eaa	i dont know but when you find out let me know. also you could make a small fortune on the side when you sell your idea to some big company, which might help!

gqVTdtUtaa	My grandparents had what you are calling a story book marriage. Two months shy of 65 years when my grandmother passed away. But it was not all peaches and cream. There were many struggles and many fights, but at the end of each day there was still love and respect. Name calling gets you no where and what he is doing to you is also known as emotional abuse. For the sake of your sanity, get out now. I hope there are no children involved, but if there are it is important to get family counseling so he does not treat the kids this way, too. DO NOT cut him off from his kids, that would be even worse for them.<br>  <br>  I have been where you are. He didn't change after 15 years and his new wife now gets treated the way I used to.|`|3Gjr6JG4aa	nope i don't . i think its pretty normal to fight an call each other names once in a while. those hard times are the ones that get you to the good ones. but in your case it does sound a bit out of proportion!|`|YoSgEUstaa	Sometimes we say hurtful things and we don't mean them... but if its regular and he does it JUST to hurt your feelings, then it's not very healthy. everyone says things they don't mean... but it should be constant.|`|c5WbXlhQaa	I called my husband an ****** once. I felt really bad afterward and we talked. <br>  <br>  I do call him a jerk sometimes|`|F3LBgfvwaa	My husband and I don't say things like that to each other, ever. Your husband has some anger issues. :(|`|W14VytAdaa	I've been married 10 years and also have parents been married 32 years with 8 kids together! I'm the 2nd oldest. I have never in my life heard them call each other names in the middle of any issues we may have overheard. And my husband would never do that either. That is awful. But it has to dow with HIM and maybe the issues he has with his upbringing? he needs help maybe...|`|ucVgUcDvaa	THAT is verbal abuse honey. And very few have a storybook marriage. <br>  Your parents do because they BOTH worked on making it that way. <br>  <br>  Get the book called "The Verbally Abusive Relationship" It will help you decide if he is abusing you. High light the areas that have been in your relationship. Then let him read it.<br>  <br>  It helped us. He stopped immediately. The mirror is ugly to look at.<br>  Married going on 28 years!|`|j9nhk1v2aa	No. My husband and I have arguments. This is a part of being married sometimes. But we never call each other out of  our names. Everything may not go the same way for you all the time. Why did you let him get away with calling you those names? This is completely unacceptable.Yes, you do know how to get out of it. You love him so much. And you believe it will work. This is what I call verbal abuse in a relationship. Please don't be in denial about this. You have to be the one to step up. Love yourself.|`|9e11a8bfdb68534bad7a82a7d59ef55aaa	WE ARE IMPERFECT HUMAN BEINGS. BUT IT'S NOT RIGHT TO CALL PPL NAMES THAT'S SO IMMATURE & SILLY.  VALUE YOURSELF AND DO SOMETHING ABOUT IT....|`|hs793CCxaa	Yes. 25+ yrs of fun and happiness. We appreciate each other and just want to make our partner happy and contented - why not? They are after all, the love of our lives. <br>  <br>  Never called her names, never. We are lucky though, we just don't argue - most things can be sorted by just discussing them.<br>  <br>  Your man WON'T change unless you force the issue and get him to treat you respectfully. We train people how to treat us by our reactions to their actions. Makes sense. Good luck. By the way, life and marriage ARE supposed to be fun!|`|T3BXC8qXaa	No, if we have a disagreement, we discuss it and find a resolution. We try not to let things escalate to "angry" and there has never been name calling in 17 years of marriage. <br>  <br>  You know his verbal abuse is wrong. It's not how you were raised and it certainly isn't normal. It sounds like he might need an anger management class...but I bet he'll get angry if you suggest it :||`|MLFBsZnUaa	lol the most I do is call my husband an @$$ or a d!ck. He sometimes calls me a b*tch, but we usually do that outta fun, as weird as it sounds. When we're mad, we stay clear of the names, as I know there is definite potential for each of saying something horrible we'd later regret.|`|AA10684513	I used to say things that would hurt my spouse until one day he turned and said "if you truly feel that way what does that say about you because you married me".  Ever since then I just walk away.|`|pRcqXCOqaa	Get out. Forget anything about anything. GET OUT. Do it NOW. If you don't YOU are to blame; noone else. GET OUT NOW|`|1NCPPHR9aa	Strangers on a train. wink.|`|AA10199093	Oh yeah, horrible things and then I regret it.|`|naequcqlaa	My parents were JUST like yours were.   Never did my sister or I hear them argue or have a disagreement.  They were the loviest couple I've ever known.  BUT, for some reason, I don't know if they "make" them like that anymore!!  I just think times have chged. so much, w/TV, movies etc. giving all different kinds of emotions, yea, name calling, threats etc. I feel it's just a "sign of the times" type thing.  Think of the TV shows that were on when we were kids.  Sure NOT like the ones we watch now & are so "programed" into seeing the best & worse of almost everything.  Next time he says some of these things to you, hy don't you just ask him why does he have to say such hurtful things to you.  Let him know just how you feel, & as far as you're concerned, he's NOT showing you any respect!  If you don't say anything, he'll never know just how you feel about it.  Let him know that it hurts you, let him know that you do your very best by him & for him, & that's how he really does feel about you after all?  Tell him the way he treats you that you wonder sometimes just why you bother doing your best to please him & have him turn around & slam you in the face w/the cutting words & things he threatens you with.  If you don't speak up & tell him, he'll at least never know how you do feel.  Give him a "reality check" so to speak.  You don't do it in an accusing way, you say "I feel" or "this is the way I feel when you do/say such things to me".  It sure can't hurt for you to voice the way you feel after he's said/done things that are so hurting towards you.  Hey, it's sure worth a try, but it sure can't hurt to get it out & voice it instead of keeping it all bottled up inside of you.  You could even say that you feel so disrespected when you hear the things he says to you. or ask him if that's really the way he feels & why does he want to hurt you the way he does.  You owe it to yourself to just get it out, & put it back on him but your way w/be way better than his way...Best to you, good luck...:)|`|nsVbWXKraa	my parents have been married for 21 years..... sometimes there is name calling and putting eachother down but it hasnt been swearing.... it was like calling someone worthless and such..... I am 19 and have seen it happen like 7 times in my life|`|wCnbeHeAaa	I never argue with my partner.  If we do argue we never call each other names, because through it all we know we love each other.  You shouldn't be with someone who threatens to divorce you.  They obviously don't care about your relationship enough to value it even during tough times.<br>  <br>  I would tell him that its either counseling or the highway, because that mouth is not acceptable, and marriages can work when there is good, clean conversation between the couple!<br>  <br>  Good luck.|`|Km8hU4lgaa	Story book marriages are few and far between, but so is the situation you are describing.  All marriages have troubles, but I would never think to call my wife such things as you're describing.<br>  <br>  I would think some kind of marriage counseling would be the best option.  I know it'll be really hard to get him to agree to that, but he's gotta do something to change his behavior.<br>  <br>  Best of luck!|`|253749a8c740b2b9ceb438a7f88d0d44aa	I don't have a story book marriage, but we do not call each other names. We have our disagreements, but it doesn't involve name calling like that. That's just a lack of maturity. Mine also knows not to threaten me with something he doesn't want. The first time he said he threatened me with a divorce, the locks would be changed when he came back. I also do not make idle threats. We say what we mean, and think before we talk.|`|hb94oOSeaa	We don't fight often but we are certainly not perfect and we both can take it as well as give it.The worst I ever called him was an azzhole or a dic and he's called me a bbittch. The truth is sometimes he acts like an azzhole and yes sometimes I'm a bbittch.<br>  Sometimes we get loud and heated but there are certain lines we would never cross. Our love and friendship out ways our moments of anger and hostility.|`|NmsuIXd1aa	the question should be why you there. my husband and i don't talk to each like that. we deicided before we got married that we wouldn talk to each like that. and we have been together 4 years and married  2.|`|mtOVRAnbaa	Me and My husband dont.. We care about each other to much to call each other names like that.. we do however call out when one is being an as* ... But we dont take it to the extent of putting each other down... Plus we dont want our daughter seeing that stuff..|`|dvgj6q6xaa	Yes, I do. Your husband needs to change his ways or get out. No one should be subjected to such verbal abuse. I know bunches of married people who have a "normal" relationship like your parents.|`|AA11315360	Yes I swear at my BF and he swears at me. Sometimes he calls me bad names and I call him bad things too. We apologize after.|`|KQF5X9Vpaa	neither me or my hubby or my parents have ever called each other names while arguing..its disrespectful and why would you do that to someone you love|`|wsS2rn9laa	Oh yea, I did. I aways felt bad later, and apologized...turned out I was right everytime...but I never did what yours does. Get help, thats not healthy!|`|8o7s9tynaa	My partner and I disagree, but there is no name calling and even raised voices are rare. Sorry about your situation.|`|0213a878584dfe668851e9dfd2d6a2e0aa	No, I never have... not even when I found out he cheated on me. It is just not who I am.|`|GRXdbUdoaa	I am so sorry that you have to go through this. But i am glad that i am not the only one that this happens to. When me and my husband get along things are wonderful. but he does yell at me and tells me he wants a divorce all the time. we have been married almost 5 years and have 2 kids. i love him and i always think he is going to change but like u i doubt that he will. and if ur hub is like mine then u can't even talk to him about the way u feel. we should leave them and move on. there is better out there and thats a fact but its hard to tell ur heart that. good luck. i'll keep u in my thoughts.|`|Kdph0XLXaa	Lose the loser!  Of course he won't change. They never do.<br>  I have been married twice. The first one was a nightmare; I was too young, he was a loser and abusive. I left him as soon as I was able.<br>  <br>  The second one *was* better. No name calling, no abuse. There were other issues involved there, but he was not the insulting type. <br>  The answer to what you're asking is no, not every man acts like yours and you deserve MUCH better.<br>  The absence of abuse does not make a marriage a fairy tale marriage. It just means the people have either been taught or managed to learn on their own a more respectful & productive way of being. <br>  Abuse is NOT normal. NEVER accept it as such.|`|cl0my1Nuaa	I hope you are not serious.  <br>  <br>  If you are, you must leave.  Immediately.  He will not change.  You have already waited and given him enough chances.  If you stay in this relationship, your self worth will slowly crumble, and one day you will wake up and find yourself an unhappy, insecure, and angry old woman.<br>  <br>  Some of the most powerful messages a person can relay is through the things that he/she will not accept; what they say "no" to.  You will not demand your husband's respect by accepting this behavior.  The only thing that will make him stop is if you leave.|`|slJWqCI5aa	My ex husband was that way and yeah he called me every name in the book, and I never retaliated until I found he was cheating on me. Then I let it all out. We divorced because I wasn't taking his damn abuse anymore. I am now remarried and my husband and I respect each other enough NOT to call each other names. If there is a problem, we discuss it and there are NO secrets between us, him and I have been through the ringer and we each learned what we wanted out of a relationship and it works for us. Our friendship comes before our marriage and that is what makes us work! Good luck!
Xx9Pr6RAaa	i generally dont like mantra's because they are either general or not very thought provoking. <br>  <br>  this one makes sense on a subtle level. in today's society it is the common thought that men still dominate and women are the weaker creature. Though i dont believe this to be true, that seems to be the general idea of society. <br>  <br>  in reality a women's greatest strength is her wit and a man's greatest weakness is his lust.|`|3iNobwVraa	I think it weakly follows gender stereotypes that no longer persist.  Strong people of either sex can get to a point where they just feel weak.  We all have those moments.  Life changes you.  Situations change you.  It's continuing to move when you want to lie down that makes a difference.<br>  <br>  And, I'm a woman and I am almost always hiding my weaknesses.  I am incredibly strong, to be sure.  But, we are all human, and we are all fallible (even if I don't let you see it.)|`|DJMPQlFDaa	I don't like being weak or vulnerable. I rather be an independent woman not relying on anybody or anything. C'est la Vie. Or in english that is life. Men want to be heroes but I rather they just be honest and respectable.|`|xaf3poA3aa	Facade?<br>  <br>  Ha ha ha|`|Ivg08iszaa	I like the first one, the second one just sounds bitter, to be honest lol|`|dCmSA6r2aa	sounds way to generic|`|xRZ1PRZwaa	Very interesting. Wouldn't it be nice to live in a world where it is alright for a woman to be strong without being called a bi%ch and a man tender without being called a wimp.<br>  <br>  That's why I love my marriage. I can boss my husband around, and he can hunker in fear! Just kidding - it's actually nice in our relationship because we're free to be ourselves - sometimes strong, sometimes weak and we're always there for each other regardless. Maybe I should just invite the world over to our house!
0wkSf58waa	No, you acted in self defense since she came at you first. What she did to you would be considered abuse.|`|7p9u5sexaa	well the way you tell it no but legally yes she can accuse you for abuse you shouldn't of gone   |`|oEGGYjfLaa	Not if she hit you first. I mean technically, you didn't hit her, so............|`|f717aa7717b59a95a4e925eadbe1dca5aa	She did put her hands on you. However, no man should hurt a woman you should have grab her not hard like you did and restrained her and then left. I don't get why you had to squeeze her as hard as you could. Most men are strong even if they are small so i am hoping you are really weak. Also you could have just restrained her and called the police. You had other choices. |`|2kTpJdKOaa	This is the sad thing for guys.  if she took you to court you'd probably loose.  Its messed up how a girl can hit a guy but it doesnt work the other way.

That way they can find out their true self.|`|LnY9fOuqaa	that he is either gay or bi-sexual.<br>  <br>  But he could be trying to get her to dump him.|`|uOBwNcbQaa	Your friend is bisexual|`|AA11933260	He is gay!

You have been putting your energies in the wrong directions for happiness.  Most people pursue money and things.  Happiness comes from service and cheerful, quiet giving of things and self.  The closer we can allign our purposes and goals with our real purpose of life, the more secure we become and the deeper our true happiness.      If you are really seeking, honestly want to know, go to www.lds.org and follow the prompts to learn more.  They have an actual prophet of God with the answers you need.  You can contact persons through that web site who can give you the real personal answers you are seeking.      Death, not a problem, lost job, there is a network to help you get a better one.  Bored out of your mind.  They have answers for that too.  Unhappy.  No Chance.  They DO have the answers.

73d2c6050e09443b51029990dda007d4aa	Sure it is good to be cautious. But don't let your fear keep you from living. The best experiences in life come through chance and opportunity. If you are to afraid to take advantage of them you are only hurting yourself.     Consider this... For the most part when you meet people they feel as awkward and uncomfortable as you. So already you have common ground. There will be a time when people will try to prey on you, but you cant let that stop you from living.     So go out, meet some people and live... that is what life is all about.    Good Luck|`|AA12182497	Thats not keeping your guard up, thats being shy....|`|AA12304384	If you're shy by nature, can you really control it? Anyway, there is a difference between being shy and being guarded. From past experiences, you may have good reason to be guarded at first.|`|733b472175d0926ae612ea786c539977aa	It's never a bad idea to gurad yourself against certain feelings or emotions. As far as being shy goes, you'll never have the chance to experience new things if you dont get up and go. You guard yourself when it comes to falling in love to easily. Make sure you know it is love before pouring your heart out to that person. Otherwise, go for it.|`|595408954755781de34a7c221a8eca76aa	Shyness is usually something someone does. But if you mean to act like something you're not. Um...no. Act like yourself. Look if you have a hard time trusting yourself with others...then work on trust yourself first. Think about what it is you want in meeting new people. Is it friendship? Just talking? Or maybe it is simply a relationship? If you have some idea what you want you can meet anyone and simply be yourself without hiding behind shyness.    Do not be covert. Accept who you are and enjoy others. Now after I have said this, it doesn't mean to tell your whole live story to people you have just met. They may see you as a person without boundaries. So be half and half. Learn your own limits and boundaries and set limits for yourself and other people.    Hope that helps.    K|`|72300a1609d6f48f1d35d2e696f4a283aa	being shy is who you are maybe try to be a lil more outgoing, but keeping a guard up is not wrong|`|faf330ab58b2ca9aa2e657a9bfb158c8aa	No, it's not wrong, it's what you are comfortable with. Just don't act too stiff, people will think you are being rude when they're trying to be friendly.|`|22be5faed0c844a0c4a17a6b9438e176aa	Bless you,being shy is not embarrassing or keeping up your guard.You are just being you whilst getting to know new people but dont worry as probably these new people you are meeting are feeling the same as you...just try to relax and enjoy meeting new friends....Good luck.|`|1bb79883643f8d9470203e062a7bc21daa	YES!

Be yourself, and when a woman wants to be with you, she'll be with you, and not a different personality."    Mr. Chivalry has spoken.|`|30d07729f97911f82f9e7e6b63c264fdaa	i think it sounds ridiculous too, just keep doing whatever you're doing and be yourself|`|AA11992413	If it works for you, keep doin it. They are probably just jealous that you got her interested so quick. If you started talking like that around me, I'd laugh and walk away. You are doin fine. Good luck.

1e5e770f583f8bf7d60243fb178705b8aa	Felicidades por tomar esa decision tan compleja....!!!        Lo que te recomiendo es lo siguiente:  Necesitas checar tu ciclo mensutrual de la siguiente manera:     --- Al inicio de tu sangrado cuenta 14 dias (tomando el primer dia de sangrado) este dia 14 es tu dia mas fertil, en este dia mi querida amiga, existen muchas probabilidades de que quedes embarazad.     --- Si quieres que sea mas seguro deberas de comenzar a tener relaciones 2 dias antes del dia 14 (dias 12 y 13 despues del inicio del sangrado) y dos dias posteriores al dia 14 (dias 15 y 16 despues del inicio del sangrado)     --- No es garantia que lo hagas diario durante estos 5 dias, ya que el conteo de esperma de tu pareja puede bajar considerablemente si la actividad sexual es muy alta o frecuente, te recomiendo que lo hagan cada 24 hrs. en este periodo de 5 dias.     --- Por ultimo: Mucha suerte.....!!!!!!1    Saludos|`|6951dd1b570c7dbf7ecf92f08a3e35c1aa	una visita al ginecologo.. a tu calendario.. muchas ganas y no uses condon XD|`|9738ba5cd4461c8f99b736449fa50e01aa	Yo creo que primero tienes que checar eso con un ginecolgo no crees|`|3b5d7fdd9a0f7d2692a5cd2f29bbaf4faa	Dale bomba nomas , todo el dia hasta que se llene la cocina de humo .

How are we influencing you in anyway?  Also, why would you want to limit our opinions?  You ask us an opinionated question and then tell us not to be rude, when, no matter how we might try and say you're ugly, you will take offense to it.

She openly admits having strong positive feelings for him.  He never said anything bad about her either.|`|e7eb99854aa324213b807aedede5921aaa	I would have to say yes.  Because it will hurt them now, but it will hurt even more the longer you keep up this lie.  If you know that you will never love them like you should then you should let them go. So, they can find someone that will love them the way they need.  Also, you will never be truly happy in this relationship.|`|165e6652a58dd5b4e96ffab092bedbc5aa	I would be honest with that person and let them know where you stand and let things work themselves out for themselves from there. If they don't then you can worry about deciding on the next course of action.

And sometimes people choose to give back the pain that was given to them. Is it smart? Is it reasonable? Is it emotionally mature? No, no and no.

a8a986b52d3c829a79d029f244b08889aa	Both mothers are stubborn. What i suggest is that you tell your mother to put these differences aside and let you and your best friend hang out.

If Mohammad want go to the mountain, then bring the mountain to Mohammad. Tell your friends Mom to pick you up at your house at what ever time, and when she drives up, go to the car, and tell her your Mother would like to speak with her before you head off to the mall. This way you get them to talk, and reassurance is made and then you and your friend can go back to worrying about better stuff. If you are afraid that this ploy will only complicate matters, as an adult I promise you, they will both be on their best behavior when confronted in this pre-arranged meeting.|`|173645aab9c7739cd9604fbbb7e2af8daa	Mmm, tough, why is Teresas' mom so demanding? i would side with your mom i would probably be pissed too.

13050a1243944d2ee1ec697c26fa798baa	of course, i mean it is totaly romantic in every way. and it is an emotional point of view from the person that wrote it to you, thier true feelings. it is genuine and they are always one of a kind not copied so its value is great to a woman.|`|a1238c5b8b5b3854c56b4275af838b1faa	Yes that is the sweetest thing!|`|1b793ca8852f421619c5e4e880e120eeaa	yes i love heart felt poems.my fiance rights one for me,very now and then.|`|AA12287228	Yes I do.

Sorry, wish I could give an informative answer.|`|AA11607435	Yes.  That someone cares enough about you as a person to write a poem about you- man, it just makes you feel good all over.  I had a guy write a poem for me one night when I was waiting tables in a restaurant in Jackson Hole.  It was late at night, miserable cold and snowing, and he wrote that the smile I gave him warmed him more than the cup of coffee I served him.  Even between complete strangers, just knowing that you've made a difference can be a wonderful thing.|`|45216dfdd13c7bc030c2a9fd83e4836baa	Not me....seems too corny!

The friend probably noticed him starring and was making fun of him.|`|AA11583035	He  likes you but is not able to ask you out because he doesn't want to get hurt.  He wants to tell you how he feels but is waiting for a time when he might get to know you better.

165e6652a58dd5b4e96ffab092bedbc5aa	This child has been through a VERY traumatic, very personal tragedy in his life and his behavior indicates to me that he needs councelling. I'm not sure but since you are married to her then you are tied to the situation same as her, but you need to ask a lawyer. Not really sure what you can do about this situation except encourage your wife to take him to get councelling. Any child would need it after loosing a parent so early in life. I was 24 years old when I lost my guardian/parent (grandma who raised me from birth) and that was 10 years ago this last May. I still go to a councellor to help deal with that loss. He did not just lose someone close to him, he lost everything that she is no longer there to give him. He's hurting and he isn't likely to tell you that, or how much. Boys just don't communicate pain. They internalize it and then act out. He needs professional guadance....perhaps it would be good to do that AND get family councelling for the purpose of bringing you all together as a family the right way. Other than that just remind him that you are his friend and that you love him. Showing him too much negativity will make it worse. Try positive reinforcement. Do things with him regularly and make him feel he is wanted in YOUR life. You are the key here....don't let the oppertunity slip away to make a difference in this child's life. Maybe his school councellor would have some ideas. On top of it all he is a teen boy which adds more difficulty to the mix. Get help....you all could use it to help get through this. Good luck! Remember that he is trying to figure out where he fits in as much as you are.  Love him and make sure he knows it!
AA11992413	Me & my guy started out as booty calls for each other. We both said we weren't ready for anything else, but I fell for him. I told him I loved him and at first he said he wasn't there yet. But after another month, he admitted he loved me too. Now we've been together over 2 yrs. Let him know that kids aren't completely out of the question - if they aren't, and tell him you still want to take things slow.

Ahora que si es tu caso mas recurrente, puede ser que tengas tendencias lesbicas, (no tiene nada de malo, de hecho mi esposa las tiene y no por ello es homosexual), tal vez deberias de consultarlo con un psicologo si es que te inquieta demasiado.

1e5e770f583f8bf7d60243fb178705b8aa	La revolucion femenina que se dio a finales de los 60s en Francia y a sociedad consumista que nos ataca ahora, ha impulsado a mas y mas mujeres a salir a buscar el dinero que en muchos casos no es suficiente para mantener a una familia, pero mas alla de esto es necesario que las mujeres se puedan desarrollar mas como seres pensantes y activos que son. Las mujeres no son objetos ni mucho menos y cuentan con todas las oportunidades que la sociedad les da, desgraciadamente el estigma que nuestras sociedades latinas les ha impuesto acerca de que ellas son las que deben de permanecer en casa para cuidar a la familia y al hogar las detiene todavia.     En sociedades como las europeas esto ya se esta acabando, incluso se estan cambiando los roles en este sentido: algunos hombres son los que se quedan a cubrir el papel de ama de casa y las mujeres son las que salen a buscar y conseguir es sustento economico de esos hogares.    Sin embargo existen, como en todo cambio, riesgos que debemos de preveer, ya que si esta familia tiene hijos de por medio la educacion de los mismos se ve comprometida y en algunos casos sustituidas por medios electronicos (como este) y en el peor de los casos por personas completamente ajenas a esta familia y evidentemente la educacion sera de un tercero que no necesariamente comulga con las ideas y principios de la pareja que procreo a estos hijos, y por ello este tipo de parejas deciden aplazar el tener hijos o simplemente no los tienen.    Le que debemos de hacer para evitar estos riesgos es mediar simplemente todo lo que estas parejas queremos o necesitamos hacer para no perjudicar a un tercero (hijo) que nada de culpa tiene de nacer en una sociedad que esta cambiando y tomando estos rumbos.    Es mi humilde opinion.

Me hace sentir autosuficiente.    Pero en contraparte existen mujeres que fueron educadas o por su propia eleccin desean casarse y que las mantenga su esposo de por vida.     Pero que flojera tener que estar a la expectativa de cuanto te dar tu esposo para el gasto, o tenerle que pedir para comprarte ropa,zapatos.    PERO OJO, HOMBRES NO CONFUNDAN, SI SOMOS INDEPENDIENTES PERO A VECES NOS GUSTA SENTIR HALAGADAS Y QUE NOS HAGAN REGALOS, Y SI VIVEN JUNTOS COMPARTIR EL GASTO COMO LAS TAREAS DEL HOGAR.

Mira eso va depende del hombre y del marido y si tu marido no le importa y gana buen salario o sueldo entonces luz verde te quedas en casa cuidando los ninos y haciendo la comidita verdad! es solo cuestion de q tu lo aceptes tambien y si tu como mujer sientes q ya te aburriste de ser una ama de casa siempre y estas completamente frustrada entonces a  trabajar se ha dicho!

Pues, para serte honesta, me incomodara mas mantenerlo a el, jajajajajaja!  Bueno, pero hablando en serio, yo, que soy profesional, en este momento estoy completamente dedicada al hogar y no me arrepiento. Lo decid as porque pienso que es fundamental (desde mi punto de vista, respetando otros, claro!) que sean la madre y el padre quienes directamente se involucren en la crianza de los hijos en sus primeros a?os, y por otro lado, afortunadamente y gracias a Dios, tengo la posibilidad de hacerlo. Muchas madres no pueden por entendibles circunstancias econmicas lo cual les hace igual de admirables pues tienen que compensar con calidad la cantidad de tiempo que no pueden darle a sus hijit@s.  Sin embargo, hasta cierto punto es aburridora la total dependencia monetaria, ya que en algunas ocasiones puede coartarte.

bc50da789b07ef58bba728ada518f925aa	Querido Amigo :te escribo estas lineas y espero sean raices de otras muchas ,hoy en dia uno se casa (de contraer matrimonio) por distintos motivos ,pero antes veamos que es "casarse" ,en los origenes del mundo nadie se casaba ,solo los mas fuertes guiaban a los mas debiles y las mujeres eran las que dominaban en muchas "tribus " por aquellos a?os ,imaginemos por un instante esos dias , quien llegaba a 35 o 40 a?os bien que podia considerarse afortunado !!!! todas las acciones tenian en principio la premisa de sobrevivir !!!! por lo tanto a los 12a?os  ya las mujeres podian procrear y los hombres a los 15 a?os ,pero solo los de 30 a?os o poco menos tenian normalmente ese derecho (placer hoy dia) recuerda que en la copula no solo pones tu semen ,ahi van muchos "datos" que sirven para "mejorar" la raza ,podria pasar horas escribiendo pero resumiendo hoy los que nos casamos lo hacemos por "Amor "(asegurar la comida en el doble sentido) asi no se nos vuela con otro mas "fuerte"|`|97cf2a425cc374c2a9824f887e907e89aa	En lo personal, yo creo que tener la seguridad de querer dar ese paso, de estar realmente convencidos, porque no es un juego, es algo que cambiara tu vida, no se si por completo, todo dependera de la relacion que lleves con tu pareja, bueno eso creo yo, creo que tambien es la ilusion de la mayoria de los seres humanos de algun dia casarse, tener hijos, educarlos etc. es como hacer un sue o realidad, claro que no todo sera miel sobre ojuelas, que habran problemas de cualquier tipo pero si somos inteligentes los sabremos superar, por eso hay que tener la plena seguridad  de que queremos dar ese gran paso en nuestras vidas, pero cada persona tiene sus motivos.|`|92bd428c5a5da554f742df0eab8141a5aa	No sera por seguridad econmica porque me mantengo sola.

Put him at ease and just say "Hey what's up - I like your shirt".  Give him a chance to overcome his shyness and talk to you by starting the conversation for him.

(unless your gonna be a prude at the reception, lol)<br>  <br>  3...the third one is pretty, and would look great if you are really focused on showing off newly tones arms and some elegant cleavage.  this one is also a more modest look and very reminiscent of the past and looks like MONEY!<br>  <br>  I would personally wear the first one, to show off my shape, booty and cleavage all in one:-)  but I would only do cute "2-step" dances that night as well|`|hb94oOSeaa	They are all very beautiful!

Ya que empiezan a acostumbrarse a la convivencia diaria, a ver los defectos y manas que no ves cuando andas de noviazgo. Traten los dos de ser tolerantes y ceder un 50% cada uno en alguna desaveniencia. Imagnate yo me cas a la edad de 19 a?os y a los tres das me quera regresar a mi casa!!!!  Pero cada vez que discutamos, mejor l se sala a caminar a darle una vuelta a la cuadra y yo me meta a ba?ar, cuando l regresaba nos sentbamos a hablar ms tranquilos y entonces veamos desde otra perspectiva el problema por el que habamos discutido. Trata de que cuando llegue de su trabajo, le abras la puerta, le des un beso de bienvenida, le ayudes a quitarse el saco  a darle un vaso de refresco natural bien fro y pregntale como le fu en el trabajo (el consejo me lo do mi bisabuela), yo no crea que eso funcionara pero si me funcion.

When i was not in the check stand at work (i worked at rite aid) he would walk around with me or sit down where i was working an he would spend hours with me. He would drive about 12 miles every day i worked at night just to go pick me up and bring me home. He would invite me to lunch and take me out. Now we have been together for about 8 months. He doesn't do any of those things anymore. He never goes visit me at work now. he never picks me up anymore or invites me to lunch.

AA11906603	You are so shy!  Just give her a kiss on the cheek the next time you see her - in front of everyone.  If you still feel uncomfortable then do it when you say "goodbye".  Obviously you two DO have feelings for each other, though it may not be clear yet what they are.  That's OK and a kiss can't hurt.|`|AA11613198	just kiss her on the cheek! girlfriends do it 2 say hello and goodbye. girl and guy friends do it too! after you do tell her she is the best girl friend u have ever had and u would never change it 4 the world! u want 2 be friends 4ever.|`|395ba13b6215bd11920db288b39e6959aa	If you already told her you loved her and she didn't act one it, that might be a bad sign.    Is she really shy? Or does she have very strict moral values?    If not, I think you already have your answer. Save it for the next special girl that comes along. Or save it for the person you really fall in love with. It happens. At least it did to me.|`|AA12253225	yeah,kiss her on the cheek first!!! she might be having the same thoughts but be afraid to act it out!! go for dude, you aren't being to hasty if its on the cheek. hey maybe she'll turn her head and kiss you on the mouth!!!! hope you enjoy it!!|`|AA12181537	First of all, there's nothing wrong with just kissing her on the cheek or even the forehead.  I'm fairly certain that you doing that would not upset her.  I'm sure she's quite enjoy it, and it would make her feel cared/loved/special.  And you would enjoy it to.  Friends to that quite often, and it doesn't "mean" anything.    Now, there's two things that you should take a look at.  When she told you she loved you as well, are you certain that she only loves you as a friend?  After being best friends for that long it's hard NOT to develop deeper feelings, and that goes for both of you.      I'm not going to tell you that you have feelings for her, because you're the only one that knows that.  But it does sound to me like you should take a step back and think about it.  There maybe more there than you're willing to admit, even to yourself.  Trust me, I've been there.

It all started when Leo was 7, his father got diagnosed with brain cancer and everything went downhill from there. That day he knew that he was different. Every other person on the street could tell something was a little fishy about him. But there was no telling what. His parents were especially worried. Was it because of his father's diagnosis? The thought of his father almost worried Leo to death. It is very hard to understand brain cancer at age 7. Especially when you know who has it. His father died on June 6th, 2006.     Leo's day felt even worse at 6'o clock that night. He saw a man walking around his house. But this was no ordinary man. The man was almost angelic....So familiar? Leo walked through his kitchen and realized...he knew who that was. But what was his name? Leo forgot the name. Why couldn't he remember the name??? He grabbed a loaf of bread and some ham and ran out of his house, hopped on his four-wheeler and drove off into the woods. Who was this man!! And the rest is for you to decide...hope this helps, kind of a crappy story behind it. But whatever. If you publish this ever, then I want some of the profit!!! lolz thanks.

Is she jealous of the close relationship you and your dad share?  Have you tried talking to her about why she thinks you don't want to work? When it obviously isn't true.  I'm really sorry that she wasn't excited when you and your husband thought you might be expecting a baby...that's really sad.   I wish I could give you an easy answer, but I can't. My mother is very much like yours sometimes, and like your mother she seems to favour my brother all the time no matter what, he can do no wrong, and I just don't understand why.     You have every right to be upset, I would be too. Maybe you should just talk to her one on one and see what the problem is.    Good luck, I hope everything turns out ok for you.|`|e7d3192fffc335f95576f35677955177aa	honestly i think u r jealous and childish and ur way to childish2b married he will c that 2 b4long|`|82644bccb70a7c26bc7e26b7794db8f2aa	your mom is probably just worried.

BUT IT SOUND LIKE YOUR MOTHER HAS SOME  ISSUES THAT MAY  BE THE PROBLEM. SO  I  WOULD  NOT BE SO EAGER TO LET  KNOW WHAT GOING ON  THAT SOUND HARSH BUT SHE HAS THE PROBLEM  NOT  YOU.|`|AA11073470	i think you have a genuine reason to be upset. You just want to talk and have your mother listen to you but she won't listen without constantly criticising you.|`|AA10704364	What about sharing with your Dad instead?    Certain personalities click and certain personalities clash.  We can't change others.  We need to accept them as they are with all their defects and 'warts'.  And hope that we will be accepted as well.    Try to find a close friend to share with - perhaps another bride.  You'll have a lot in common with each other.    Also, your husband should be your  1 confidante.    (Don't forget about G-d - He never rejects us or criticizes)
AA11829099	Either he is busy and doesn't want to stay on the phone with you to long, or he is not a talker and just wants to say what he wants to say and doesn't want his buddy to hear or he is somewhere he is not suppose to be and only wants to email you so you can't hear back ground noises...why don't you ask him?|`|c52ad719e79e0beb5f831de7bf8a7cdaaa	well, being a guy, i can say he likes you, but not sure of your feelings, and email is less personal so he feels more secure talking to you that way.|`|b21dd71bd4b604ba11d72a3c99c3a7e9aa	Could you imagine it if he was standing in front of his boy while making cutsey talk with you?  He'd never hear the end of it.  But that doesn't make what he's doing to you right.     I would wait for the friend to leave town and then tell your BF that you were more than willing to step back while they were hanging out HOWEVER  You would have appreciated a phone call during the week though.  Tell him that e mails never cut it.  You're his girlfriend; not a buddy.|`|b839b1cc04978371fe167ab422ec5b3aaa	He doesn't want his little girlfriend to hear the call.|`|AA10924968	Because guys are not verbal as are women.

You need to get yourself to therapy and figure out why you have these moods swings before you end up destroying your relationship. Looking for happiness elsewhere is no answer. You will not find it.

Fla1aBHFaa	no. wat is wrong with tat?|`|jWR6EHgyaa	Well... it depends on the age of those in question, really. If it's a thirteen year old going out with someone twenty or above, then well... that is definitely strange (not to mention illegal...). However if the girl is 71 and the guy is 78, people aren't going to read so much into it. You said young girls, though, so we'll focus on that.<br>  <br>  I think age differences that great are fine... once you're a legal adult. Before then, well... no. That just kind of screams taking advantage of, even if that is not always the case. And you know, once someone hits 18 they're truly responsible for their own actions and all that, so if something happens and the guy turns out to be a bad choice and you get your heart 'broken', then you've only got your own judgement to blame.|`|zzxZjt8Haa	Hmm..<br>  I'm 15...<br>  <br>  7 yrs old really big differents, but I don't mind to go out with older guy.<br>  It's more strange if go out with younger guy, thought.<br>  <br>  Guy will be the head of family. So He has able to get feed the family and responsible.. Normally, girls with choose 1-4 yrs older bf. some in same own. and very little younger bf.<br>  <br>  I ever attracted to a 24 yrs old man..<br>  That was very rape??<br>  <br>  Haha.. Because he was so good, treating me like kids.. hehe..<br>  He works and very responsible man.<br>  I was 13.. haha..<br>  <br>  Just think like this..<br>  It's better to get relationship with older man that serious, worked, nice.<br>  Than a young boy, handsome, nicebody, but playboy or not worked..<br>  <br>  Haha.. think future..|`|YyiOuxqpaa	I went out with a much older man because let me put this as eloquently as possible everytime I would talk to a young hot guy my age and express some interest they freak out and run for the hills.  Men to me are like this you want them they dont want you you dont want them they want you they love to compete and i think girls get fet up.  Hey maybe we want to be loved the most by our guy.  Girls want to feel like their the best, their the one girl that got you.  Now older men get this because once their old their old and alone they realise they arn't going to be able to pick up girls using their old tactics.  So then they resort to treating girls right, but in the end all they really care about is money, and still screw it up.<br>  <br>  no Im not harbouring any hard feelings or anything. HAHA HA|`|KASok5mKaa	I'm almost 15 going out with a 18 year old<br>  Older guys are more mature and seem to be looking for sex less than 15 year old boys are.<br>  It isn't rape unless you have sex, which I'm not until I get married.<br>  Also, he has a job and makes lots of his own money and is going somewhere, and respects women.|`|EyhML4GPaa	ive never done that i do find it wierd. like i dont think i could date a 24 and im 19... my boyfriend is 20. but my bestie is 19 and was dating a man that was 32 but she loved it because she didnt want kids and it wasa very clear he didnt and he was mature and out of his party stage... that would be the only upside i could see to date an older man was that he is out of his party stage because as it standsi hate to go out and party!! hope this helps|`|udPtqagzaa	yeh i prefer somebody of my own age. you're more likely to have similar oppinions and interests. i'm 16- what kind of in-depth conversations could i have with 23+ and has a much, much wider understanding of the world.<br>  sure, i can talk to guys who are older..but he'd be too much like a parent-figure.<br>  i think my mum would hate him too..|`|fztQXezVaa	Because hes about 10 times more mature then guys our own age.<br>  <br>  Oh and FYI it isnt rape unless the guy thats 7 years older forces her to have sex without consent, or she is underage.<br>  <br>  I personally havent, but ive seen alot of girls do it.|`|dXynvbJbaa	I think it's manly because an older guy tends to be more mature and experienced. I usually like older guys, but 7 years older is too much for me... at least it is for right now... but yeah I agree with you, it is sorta strange|`|CG6KM8Zwaa	girls prefer older guys because they are more mature, more developed, more experienced and they're usually a lot better looking|`|JuhsU1g9aa	It's "rape" if the girl is underage and the man is an adult...or vice versa.  But if the girl is 18 and the guy is 10 years older, then no big deal.|`|A5Tf6C3Iaa	no. my husband is 7 years older then me. i was 19 when we met and he was 26. i dont like younger guys cause they are too inmature for me. its a personal preference.|`|5PulLgfmaa	...Some girls think that if he's older that he will treat you better.

It's only rape if the older guy forces sex on the younger girl.|`|ouLKDu2taa	Well, if your like 13 and he's like 17 it's creepy and disgusting and the chances are.. he's only wanting what he 'wants' Which is, i think everyone knows what that is. My aunt is i think around 34 - 36 somewhere between there and my step uncle i think is forty some years old. I really don't have a problem with that. But if you're fairly young then it's odd to be 15 and be dating a 23 year old.<br>  <br>  But some women just like it that way. I've never done it.. I always try to find someone closer to my age the oldest age ill go to is well, i'm 14 and if my guy is like 14 almost 15, that's okay with me. Even if he's a year younger, that's fine.|`|bQu4A2awaa	well not really. <br>  sure it seems like a huge age difference but when you like or love someone. age doesn't matter. its just a number. <br>  the guy could be really mature and down to earth and you could feel this connection to them.so no lol i dont think its that strange. but if the age difference goes above 10 then you kind of know that the older guy/girl is just looking for sex and is using you.|`|XK6k2UAIaa	The maturity level is much higher then a guy that is the same age as you. No not true in all cases but most. Also they have the experience maybe a stable job and so on and so forth. 7years for me is a bit much but you can't help who you fall for.|`|XUDK0jlHaa	i honestly dont see anything wrong with it...<br>  i mean, i like a guy that is 5 years older than me... i think its because he is more mature and knows what to say and stuff.. he knows what he has to do to get a girl and he knows how to treat women. simple.|`|0C04Auafaa	it all depends on where the 7 year age difference starts. if your 18-21 and your dating a guy 7 years older its prob just attraction<br>  <br>   if your like 15 its either<br>  -  a need to be wanted so desperatly that hes the first one you can find or<br>  - it could that an older guy makes you cooler, <br>  - or that he can drive might have his own place<br>  <br>  i really don't think maturity is at all an issue, there are plenty of guys that are mature thaat are 2-3 years older than you , if what the're saying about maturity is true then I guess the're saying you have to be almost a decade older to be mature , that makes no sense,<br>  <br>  you don't have to go that far to find maturity, and since when is a 30 or 40 year old guy dating a 15 year old. i hear about it all the time, you can't say its maturity or cool factor there, its just wrong, there are no feelings in that kinda thing|`|tCNP6bbeaa	man,good tht u see gals going out with guys..<br>  what matters is whom do they like to go out with.<br>  may be the elder guys get them trapped easily as they have more experience and knowledge while young girls can hardly think of what elder guys might be thinking in mind..when taking such younger gals out.<br>  <br>  so for them it's easy to get gals much younger to their age,whom they can make feel-they are more mature in each sense and these kiddies are cared by such men  and ultimately they rape her emotional values and thinking at such a young age.<br>  <br>  I consider it to be a rape when it's with wrong intention and ultimately can hurt the gals-as they are much more younger in thoughts.|`|xJ4ooDT4aa	Well right now I am 15 and if I dated someone 7 years older than me that would be kinda creepy....The most is probably 2 years for me. I think when you are older 7 years doesn't really matter too much. When you are a teenager like me people are in different development stages and it is a lot different.|`|cDWHNcyoaa	first off they know how to love a woman. they take the time and love u till you fall asleep from exhaustion. i'm 20 and my husband to be is 36. he loves me for me, he has a stable job and knows what he's doing and going in his life. it is not rape as long as the girl is not 17 and under. when a girl is 18 and she wants an older man and they are in love that's great. sorry to u younger guys you are just into to much crap to have a solid relationship with u.|`|AA10824548	I like older men,they have played games in the pasted,cheated,etc most older men get to a point in there life where they are ready to settle down and do the right thing,most men not all.|`|z8qqKPgqaa	I think its gross.<br>  I have an age limit.<br>  I'm 16 and I won't date anyone over 18.|`|08bf08ae35695ea415c700f1817d21deaa	i think its sick too!!! i have no idea why any girl/woman would want wrikely (i know i spelt that wrong) balls???? lol|`|Q5PQbMd1aa	i think its weird

7sv1ku5Caa	I only have 2 kids, and I would have loved for someone to move in and help me.  If she really is over the marriage ( which I was) the only thing left is the kids, and it's so hard to take care of them and take them where they need to go with only one parent, especially if she has a job.  The hardest thing was telling my kids they couldn't participate in sports, activities, etc. because I couldn't drive them, well, I could quit my job and take them everywhere, including the homeless shelter since we wouldn't have a home if I didn't have a job.  Help with the kids if you can, believe me, that will be a great relief.
AA11068528	Well she is your "best" friend and I'm sure she spoke with you in confidence, so whether she  tells her husband or not is going to be up to her.  I would hope you would have had or will have a discussion about the repercussions by telling her husband.  How do both of you think he will respond?  What could this potential lead into?  Things like that.    We all have boundaries and I believe your friend is testing hers.  Let's hope it doesn't have an impact on your relationship with her, but more so, her husband.    True, she might not be gay, nor bi-sexual, but just attempting to test her sexuality.  It will be important that you stand by her side as she will probably struggle with her actions and decisions going forward.    Best of luck!|`|7a60b5fd43183f696a47e589fef5e146aa	She's making a poor choice, if I were you, I'd stay out of it.|`|b235622e608e184dcb231ac247fd7ba5aa	I suggest that you are prurient.

Truth be told, you are both adelpated, immature, adolescent, idiots; and, should be separated for your own safety.|`|49dc09d0101f98ed2ef215053d471e63aa	stay clear girl.u dnt want 2 get involed.u will lose a friend|`|AA11591306	She is definitely bisexual. Personally I dont have a problem with that, but with the fact that she is currently having sex with this woman as well as her husband. That is cheating no matter what the sex or circumstances and that is wrong. You have to decide whether your friendship with her is more important than telling the truth. Its a difficult one but do what your heart says.|`|e7520ba9b67329cf5de9c46c471bea98aa	Speaking from experience, I would distance myself from her. Eventually, it's going to all unfold and you're going to be in the middle. You can still talk to her and see her but don't be so close, and NO, don't tell her hubby, it will only make you look like the bad guy. It will get turned around on you somehow.|`|958eceac160c332cb6089458b9cc216caa	I think you were right.  Your friend might not be gay but is definatly bi-sexual.  Telling her husband is the honorable thing to do because this will somehow get out.  Not only that but she cheated on him by having an affair.
222f5b92a33bef9a5cf0a3e3356b953faa	HI I THINK SHE IS CONFUSED ABOUT TAKING THE RELATION BETWEEN U TWO.

165e6652a58dd5b4e96ffab092bedbc5aa	Sweety, you are not in a good situation. First of all he is too old for you. Second of all, I have been a step-mom and in a similar situation. The guilt of being the one to cause another person to be detached from their child, even if it was not your choice for it to be so, is enormous and too hard to live with. She is wrong for doing what she is doing and keeping him from his child for such a stupid reason. Technically she can't. He can take her to court for visitation. Still, you are too young to have to deal with taht situation and at your age it is not fair to you or him to be in it. Not fair to the child either. If you care for him so much then you really should care enough to let him go so that he can deal with the immediate situation with his child. Later and after he straghtens that out and after you get your life going then maybe try again. But for now, let him go so he can focus on the important matter of his parenting status. Support him as his friend but get out of the immediate situation. Good liuck to you!|`|4ddb2528520b7d7eef326c8171f21699aa	You are to young for him its illegal for him to be with you,If he goes to jail for being with a minor he will also loose right to his child and thats not fair to the child..Im sorry to say honey his baby comes before you and you are a big risk for him, You need to let him go. And yes the mother of his child can keep the baby from him ecspecaily because he is dating a minor and he can be charged with that.. Get out of it for the sake of his baby and find someone your own age|`|18f39fa9333c01f131220976c54b744daa	Nooooooo Your 16 thats under age thats ilegal Go out with me im 14|`|AA11419083	DO NOT put his relationship with his daughter at risk for your relationship with him. That's his child, and if you're selfish enough to jepordize the father-daughter relationship, then I guess you're just a child too.|`|e01f92891cfdef1a6d3e3c7decf2537faa	Regardless of what the two of you have in common one thing still remains the same. He is too old for you. If you are asking the question than you know for yourself that he is to old for also. With him being an adult and you a young adult he needs to get his life in order. He needs to set up child support and visitation rights if his ex-girlfriend is using the child as punishment for seeing someone else. This is no life for a young adult such as yourself. You need to venture out meet new folks, enjoy life. College will bring you new experiences and relationships. No sense on being tied down, now.|`|b6d34d1ae6b3ceda97cebc02361cd45baa	Date someone else.  You are young, and there are lots of people for you yet to meet.  Don't waste your time with someone who carries such baggage.

However, you really need to figure this out for yourself.  The question really is, "what is too much sex for me?"

I know it sounds like the oldest trick in the book, but trust me, it will get her attention and interest.  It shows you're interested.  But make it short, and hopefully a little seductive, or sweet, or whatever you want her to see.<br>  Make conversation, and depending on how well you know her, let it show off that you are very interested in her, her interested and also having that feeling returned!

Maybe because she doesn't want to stop seeing you/give you up, she keeps you in secret.

JklpZB5Eaa	That's a hard one...but my rule of thumb is that if he says he's not interested in that way...he probably means it...As hard as it is to move on, you kind of need to make some sort of effort to do that. Women have a way of romanticizing things that are actually very plain and clear.  Feeling how you feel definitely does not make you stupid! You can't help who you fall for! ...and as cliche as it sound, let him go and if he is meant for you, you'll end up together in the end...even if it's years from now...|`|64AwxBpXaa	just give it some time and you'll forget about him but if you really are meant together you will end up together just for now be friends with him and Just forget about him that you ever told him your true feelings|`|dd0d57e5ff24820c6981c10f9097112faa	dont let it 'bother' you.  maybe it's a nice name.  |`|ZvZE6HM1aa	I think all of those signs, book passages, newspaper print/whatever would be there regardless of your current situation.

f3aaaf77705c871344defc30b84518e4aa	as a divorced father of two boys after twenty one years of marriage i saw changes in everyone who was invvolved at the times. every family memeber was effected. my oldest son lost all his self esteem, did not want to be with me or with his mother so slept at friends and stayed away. my youngest was 11 at the time and was staying with his mother. he became so afiraid of what she was doing that he called child services against her, her anger spilled out against me even thou she served me, and any morals and  principles she had seem to disapate over night. i was so shocked that i found it impossible to trust my own judgement, but i found my personality changing drasticly. surprisingly i felt a peace and calm inside that i had not experienced in years. i found my outlook in life changing and my approach to it to. i found new thing about myself that opened new dreams i never thought imaginable. for example i never wrote a thing in my life now im in discussions with two publishing companys about two novels.  my youngest son lived with me, and he summed it up this way one day he said dad i sure glad i got to know you, because the man i see before me i have never seen before. my x wife still blames me, has gone from being a nice christian lady to being a woman that most men would run from. she is bitter full of anger, and struggling to find who and what she is. my oldest is just finsihing univeristy and my baby is now 17 and is training to be a master chef. both my children have matured faster then most boys do, because of what that had to endure while their mother and i where going through our divorce.|`|9051134f8e7f410f4a60793d4e984757aa	Id be happy to share with you but prefer in private email or im.|`|f067e604735a66b2c602b4fc61dd9274aa	Ok..I'll bite. Divorce is like a death, except no ones dies. It is truly a solo journey one must take on his or her own. As a divorced Dad, I learned that through the loss of your family, you really learn to appreciate what you do have. For me anyway, I love my kids more, if thats possible. A divorce will cause you to travel the spectrum of emotions. Shock, turns into anger, then to hate, then to sadness, then acceptance. If your lucky you will emerge a better person and learn from your experience. Some people can cope, others can't. The luckiest divorcees are the ones without children. You can truly start over once you make it through. When kids are involved, it's much worse. For me personnaly, it depends on the circumstances of a divorce. I would venture to say the one feeling everyone has in common is, failure.|`|61250c3c3be1f2cd6a02ffa73fd483ccaa	My Mum & Dad divorced when I was 15. Not an easy time!! Mum left us with Dad and although he was a good Dad it was very hard for me being the eldest and a girl. I had to take over the Mum role in the house and with the other siblings. This caused some resentment with my sisters especially, that still exists today!! My brother and I always got on well and still do but my relationship with my sisters has always been very trying.  Dad passed away 3 yrs ago but up until then he and Mum were always in attendance at any family functions and at Xmas and there was never a problem with that. My Mum remarried and my stepfather was always included as well. In all it was a very civil divorce and really the only thing affected was my role with my sisters.|`|e541e644384db0ba3827ceaf3a9be2b8aa	As a divorced individual, I was blessed that no children were involved. Obviously I did not want it to end this way, but when the other party keeps cheating on you, you have no other choice. But even though I'm divorced going on almost 2 years now, I still feel very sad and broken at times. It has definitely not been easy...but I do feel like a huge failure, and a huge waste of time and feelings.  I'm not going to lie, it does at times make me very very depressed. Some people have described divorce as if one of your limbs was cut off from you and you have to heal...and that takes time. The pain is the same as having one of your limbs cut off, but emotionally. IT's definitely not easy at all. But coping with it, and the help of my faith in God has really helped me through it all. Also if you have reliable and faithful family and friends, it makes it a little easier.  But all in all, it is definitely not an easy thing to go through...even though I've only been married for 2 years with this lady. WHat doesn't kill you, makes you stronger though.... thank God we had no children.

AA11092930	different people have different emotions to love...    for some it could mean:    1.  thinking about that person everyday, every minute,   2.  breathing, feeling every heartbeat when you are near that person    3.  wanting to be with that person every free minute, wanting to hold her hand, rub her back anything to touch her....

T87pwfi4aa	Well, I think it's pretty obviously that although you still love and care about your ex you cant be together.<br>  I think that everyone should be with someone that makes them feel great, instead of crappy.<br>  And dont act like immature kids everytime a problem arises.<br>  Which is how your ex sounds.<br>  Running away, or drawing things out just because she cant handle talking about them?<br>  That's not a person you should be with.<br>  <br>  You two were{/are?} in love! I would be surprised if your feelings for her just magically vanished into thin air.<br>  Because it sounds like you really cared about her, <br>  and would still be with her if she hadnt been like that.<br>  <br>  If you like this other girl, and think you could have something<br>  I would say to try it out with her.<br>  Give it a shot at least.<br>  But, you should tell her what you told us about not being sure if you're over your ex.<br>  I also don't think that you shouldnt get with this girl if you think your feelings for your ex are as strong as you say they are.<br>  You shouldnt bring that girl into all of this without sorting out your feelings.<br>  <br>  You? a man-whore?<br>  Lol, obviously you dont spend much time in this section.<br>  People ask crazy questions that are far more man-whore-ish than you could ever be.<br>  Besides, I dont think it's nice to call someone names in their time of need.<br>  :]<br>  <br>  You're very welcome.<br>  Hope this helps.|`|5up38DUlaa	just follow ur heart.. eventually someone will be hurt but it's ur own choice... who will really makes u happy?.. who is the one u really care for?? u just fall for another girl bcoz u want to be happy but u feel u still have feelings for ur ex, but what really makes u happy??|`|7af4d8f7e4e2aa6a6d0f6c8d4b25f558aa	u have to make a choice..who do u want to be with..who make u happy.but if u can not choose..they do not see anyone..think about what makes u happy.do u for awhile|`|NWSnWiYXaa	Has your ex changed?  Because if she hasn't there's no reason for you to go back like things are going to be different.|`|gxWSan9Raa	I think you broke it off with that other girl for a reason and once something like that is done than it is done and over with. I will tell you that some girls don't like talking about everything it is harder for some girls than others I would talk with her.   If that other girl is not right for you than I would call both of them off and concentrate on yourself until you get your feelings worked out.  But I think the second girl with you saying that it is getting serious you are in that relationship for a reason and that is because you want to be there.  Stick with it you will never know what will happen.  Follow your heart.Good Luck:)|`|ZF6SzUq0aa	I would talk to your ex more than this other girl. It sounds like you're not really going out, so you're not really doing anything bad. I don't really get why you broke up with your ex in the first place, but maybe you can start over and avoid what ever problem it was about. If you think you're going to do that, talk to this new girl and say you just want to be friends, or, in a less awkward way, just show no interest. Good luck!!|`|dBJbKYIuaa	First what you have to do is talk to your ex, find out how she feels. If she still has feelings for you, talk them out. If not, then just try your best to move on, and make a wonderful relationship with this other girl<br>  <br>  I had a friend who was dating a guy, but the guy broke up with her because he was still in love with her ex, and this broke her heart. So I wouldn't date the other girl, without clearing things up with your ex.<br>  <br>  Do you also really like this other girl? If so, talk to her, tell her you have feelings for two people. See what her reaction is.<br>  <br>  The key to success is communication.|`|TXNjM1qDaa	Its a good thing that you are aware that you may cause something bad and im glad. I don't think what you are doing is wrong because you did break up with your other girlfriend and now you have a new one. I think dating your new girl will make you have less feelings for the other one. It's ok to have feelings for your old ex because its your emotions and you can't help what you are feeling. The only thing that would be wrong is if you called your ex and told her you miss her and love her because then your new girlfriend would get mad at you. Just try to stay friends with your ex.
28HLij60aa	I'd say, take it one step at a time with your life. You've not long lost your job through redundancy which is stressful enough for anyone to take, but by adding pressure on yourself to have a girlfriend probably isn't in your own best interest right now....take stock of what you have at present, get yourself a new job and with your new job will come more confidence in yourself. <br>  <br>  From what you've stated in your question, I think you'll find a new girlfriend eventually, but I wouldn't go looking for one now with the situation you're currently in as it's all stress you don't need. :o) <br>  <br>  It might take a while to find a new job but hang in there-good luck!|`|K6vEbdqxaa	I guess this depends on what kind of guy you are.  I'm not saying women are gold-diggers, but you'd have to be a pretty great guy for a girl to overlook the fact that you haven't had a job in a while.  Most girls are looking for a man that is stable,  at least not on welfare.  Treat a girl right, and she will probably overlook that fact, as long as you are looking to better your situation!|`|MmaGJPzlaa	no|`|72a759eadcb04ef83b501e2c3dcde213aa	Women force men to pay because it's a way they think it will make them appreciate them for who they are (which isn't true, but what do they know?)<br>  <br>  Women are attracted to men because of the traits they portray<br>  <br>  You have two choices:<br>  Be a little more thoughtful to the girl and do all the little stuff that they would like e.g. a rose on the bed or a little text message saying how this (make sure it's good) thing reminds me of you or that time when we...,etc.<br>  <br>  Door number 2 is:<br>  aceology.net<br>  doubleyourdating.com<br>  mysterymethod.com<br>  styleacademy.com<br>  <br>  Unfortunately both require some money on some level.<br>  <br>  You meet women everywhere - it's a matter of picking them up|`|rcRoF7WNaa	You may be unemployed but not by choice.

Everyone was dancing around us and doing their own thing and we wer dancing then we kissed. It was the best kiss i've ever had. His bottom lip initially tucked into the middle of my bottom and top lip and our mouths seemed to fit together pefectly.<br>  <br>  It's funny because he isn't the typical kinda guy I would go for but the kiss was perfect and I never saw him again.|`|vQRYhLLJaa	It was my first kiss with my latest boyfriend (now ex). We got off at the same bus stop and went for a small walk. At the top of this hill where we had to part ways, we hugged and when I moved to let go, he still had his arms around me. I gazed into his eyes and he had his head slightly tilted so I leaned in slightly as he did and then we kissed =] It was like there was only two of us in the world.<br>  And then afterwards I had my first french kiss with him after we hugged again. It was such a lovely moment, and I was only sorry to see the relationship end after a week.<br>  But I suppose that's life for you.<br>  Hope you're well.|`|FI5QNB0Yaa	it was in a dumpster and he grabbed me, there wasa  bit of a teeth clash but i didnt let that put me of, yeah it was a bit sloppy but it was good, i realised he had a bit of chicken stuck in his braces but we had fun anyway,<br>  <br>  its hard to get the perfect gay boyfriend he was nice guy tho.<br>  x|`|3zwo0PWNaa	You should never 'give' a kiss. A kiss must be shared to mean anything!<br>  Good kisses start gently, kissing one lip, and moving around is good, if it is to become more passionate... open mouths, tongue tango... it should happen naturally!|`|ivsYJPx3aa	 I can't remember , I think i lost a friend ...

I don't remember ............|`|EJW0lLvaaa	i think that it was when i first started seeing the 2nd last guy i was with. i met him at work, and he left me his phone number, he had to go out of province to work, but when we first start texting it was non stop. he kept telling me how he could not wait to get back home to see me. i could not believe how fast and hard i fell for him. he was the most amazing guy, and i still wish i had him now. but anyways, when he finally came home about a week and a half after we start talking, he picked me up and we just drove around for hours talking about everything, it was amazing. when he dropped me off home he walked me to my door, i was really nervous so i gave him a quick hug and turned around to open the door, but he pulled me back and kissed me. i was kinda expecting it, but wasnt really ready for it, so we had a bit of a teeth bang, but it was just amazing, i had butterflys in my stomach. he said good night, and left, it was the most amazing kiss i ever had.|`|5vv5AYDgaa	The most perfect kiss I have ever given would probably be with a forbidden lover actually. It was dangerous and fiery and oh so exciting! It took my breath away, and I was the one that gave it!!!!<br>  <br>  It was on my couch I believe, watching Futurama. LOL! I just kind of jumped in his arms and smooched him! :D<br>  <br>  That was one intense night after that, I can tell you that. |`|31189ab5bc4e9c8e514f070574c067a9aa	I actually have three... <br>  The first was on July 1st 06 with my ex.<br>  At the time we weren't together, we were as you would say "talking." It was really the first time we had even hung out. We were at an abonded school with some friends when he wrapped his arms around me. About the time we were suppose to leave we were argueing about something, but not angryly it was just petty and cute. As I was saying yes he was saying no and next thing I realize was we were getting closer and just when he said no the last time we kissed and the whole world stoped.<br>  Second was with another ex of mine just a year later on July 4th 07:<br>  I went over to a close friend of mine and at the time current boyfriend's house to celebrate 4th of july. Though I was a bit bummed because I thought I wasn't going to see fireworks. When suddenly when it got dark we heard fireworks and ran out side and just a block behind us people were lighting huge ones in the street and while I was Awe struck my boyfriend (who I forgot all about at the moment) pulled me suddenly towards him and kissed me and again the whole world stopped.<br>  <br>  And the final was with my current boyfriend of a year now it was our first kissed on Oct. 5th 07:<br>  The moment he saw me for the first time he was deteremind to have me and seeing how I just got out of a very stressful relationship I wasn't interested, but he was persistant. When I began noticing the bond we had grow I started to realize how selfish I was will finally when he came on a camping trip with me and friends I decided I wanted to take the first step but thought I was to late. Till when I kissed him and he kissed me back I was stuck and never had the world stopped yet spun in my life.|`|W289BVt6aa	in the park on a clear starry night in winter.<br>  he pulled me in tight and kissed me passionately for about an hour. <br>  i still get butterflys when i think about that kiss.<br>  |`|JlqQwRqgaa	havent had it yet :( but my dream kiss would be in a park in the rain. |`|53f8e17ac4d340994c49ab057cb9a591aa	uh, with my boyfriend on my bed fully clothed. it was wonderful.

No, cheating is not OKAY, it never will and never will be, women who make excuses for this kind of behavior end up twisted like you and suffer and suffer and suffer.  Don't do it to yourself.|`|AA11373933	no one hates you for staying with a cheater and yes, you are right, the next man may do the same.    i just think of you less for condoning it|`|AA11172883	And you put up with it....sadly.|`|d5ad291f53d0ced7264697c0325b6d64aa	well if you are willing to put up with it. then stop asking for advice. really why do you ask us a question  & we answer you you get upset....don't ask if you don't want to hear what we think......and if he brings you home  a STD ... please don't cry to us!!!!! i hate to be mean about it but that is how it is.....|`|b34b8ce722d00cb3da9f775864f36951aa	There's no hate. Just don't give the whine and make a decision. No one can make you stay, no one can make you leave. It's ALL up to YOU!|`|9521b17118b4a8dfd902017f61dc0270aa	Listen to your contridictions.....    "he puts us first and lets the other girls know that I am number one"    How is he putting you first when he's cheating on you? Putting you first would mean concidering that his cheating will hurt you and not do it at all. Putting you first would be not enticing girls to have anything more to do with him than being just a friend...if that. Are you really listening to yourself?    Why do women settle for less unnecessarly? I mean you said you have a career and seem to be independent. Is it because you two have kids together? Well check this, by you staying what kind of disfunctional behavior are you showing your kids. If you are a good woman, you will be able to find somene worthy of your presence. I know it will be hard, but you have already done it for 6 months.     Plus what about STD's how do you know that he's being careful? That is a huge risk to take with children. You're a mom, you need to live to take care of your babies. A man is soooooooooooooooo not worth you life...    Not only is he handling your heart carelessly, you've also handed over your life.    Concider that!

Thankfully I have never felt like that, but I think that you should let her know that you saw her kiss the guy and ask her if she REALLY likes you or if she just acts like it for fun.  I dont think she is the kind of girl that you deserve dude.  Like that was a LOW BLOW really low.|`|Co1oUch0aa	Well, hmm.....idk what to say to that.

A girl can only wait so long....<br>  Another thing, she could have wanted to make you jelous perhaps?<br>  Well either way, you should talk to her just the 2 of u about this<br>  good luck<br>  <br>  help me?<br>  <a href="http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index;_ylt=AolsJqt3nTUhWDJvQeE6SBXsy6IX;_ylv=3?qid=20081107201532AAsqDEv">http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index;...</a>|`|u6vDU2CJaa	wow that's messed up. i think you should tell her what you saw. you dont deserve that, no one does. its happened to me before and it hurts. but all you can do is move on and forget about her. she isn't worth your time if she is going to do that.|`|maxAtuV4aa	Ok dude, get up and tell her you know! shes a horrible person for cheating on you!

In most places your relationship can get him in trouble for statutory rape due to the age difference. Especially if your parents were to find out, disapprove, and file a police report.

b94njWTDaa	Talk to Frank!|`|EX1GjjJCaa	All the propaganda you see on TV has not been proven at all.<br>  <br>  I smoke pot frequently. I started a few years ago in high school and am now a freshman in college going pre-med. I've always been a straight A student. I was the DECA president at my school, and I represented my school, state, and the country in the International Conference, scoring in the top 20%.<br>  <br>  Marijuana does affect short term memory, so basically when you do it don't do it when you're supposed to be learning. It has no effect on long term memory, and is actually proven to reduce the risk of Alzheimer's in people over 50 who smoke it. Look it up.<br>  <br>  There is not one single death linked to the smoking of marijuana. There is no link between smoking marijuana and any diseases.<br>  I myself would not even consider it a drug. To me, it is simply a weed.<br>  And when I smoke it it relaxes me and relieves stress. Why do you think they prescribe it medicinally? Because it does do good for your body. Especially if you work out, it releases tension in the muscles and soothes you.|`|lynmeenmaa	ok, im a stoner. im 24 and smoking since i about 16. i dont regret smoking weed, there are a lot of worse drugs that i have taken and i dont regret that either. i enjoy smoking it, i prefer it to drinking and do it a lot more often.<br>  however, it is NOT harmless - particularly if used often. at first, it may have no effect. then after a while, u might start to get fits of laughter while smoking it, and feel happy. you might start to feel paranoid the more u smoke it, or maybe even the first time. if there are underlying mental issues, for example if u predispositioned to depression, paranois, schizophrenia, forgetfulness or even just laziness, it may bring these problems out. it makes u think more deeply about things, and this can also cause depression in itself, for u begin to see the world as a shitty place. <br>  my advice, smoke some, enjoy it - but in moderation. enjoy it as a treat, try not to do it more then once a week try keep it at that. it DOES trigger psycological problems, and it causes laziness and lack of motivation. aside from mood swings and fights with parents.<br>  also, it is a stepping stone to other drugs - i personally wouldnt ever have taken anythin stronger if i hadnt smoked weed first - but then again i was always interested in getting high one way or the other.<br>  smoke weed, but Not every day. if u see urself getting bad side effects, take a break. respect d'herb and it'll respect u! <br>  peace :)|`|SXYtLoeoaa	I only know a handful of people that don't smoke weed. I am seventeen and I only smoke when I'm at my friend's house because she always has weed and I don't know where to get any. I think if I had a good connection, I might smoke every day. I don't mind stoners and I don't mind non-smokers. Except I don't appreciate the non-smokers who think stoners should die or something. It's a bit harsh to wish death on anyone.|`|2esGKO2Caa	Quit if you want to be a grownup Act like one. It's dope you said not to preach so i won't. But it is called dope for a reason isn't it!|`|3904bf9cec60af77f3ce3e9dfcd8c007aa	Legalise it for over 18s only.Buy it in small amounts from dedicated shops where it can be taxed.And regulated.|`|fC8OPOTkaa	Smoking in general is disgusting .. why would you pollute your lungs for nothing ... you don't achieve anything by smoking ! it's the most pointless waste of time ever.|`|b85499a57edbf5a1f37bce5ce90c8557aa	Any stoner will admit openly that it lowers motivation, and memory recall.<br>  From my experience being stoned also lowers testosterone it would seem.. The stronger the herb the harder it is on your lungs. Basically freebasing weed out of a glass pipe is as hard as you can get on the respitory system..<br>  <br>  Then again I do love the culture.<br>  And the feeling of a fresh buzz is like few others.<br>  It can be a fantastic way to stimulate conversation between people and is an inexpensive source of entertainment. I further enjoy elements such as the taste, aroma and history.<br>  <br>  Smoking carries health risks as surely as eating sugary foods.<br>  Eating a banana split every day will make you fat as sure as smoking every day will make it hard to breathe. That's simple common sense.|`|e28P8gWraa	Its not that bad, I grew up with a dad that smoked weed most of his life, Hes 61 years old, and when we had none he didnt seem any different than when we did. I used to smoke a lot during my teenage years but now Im cutting most of it out. I smoke maybe once a month like you. I exercise and run a lot, no affect on my physical state, I passed my ASVAB with a 94 out of 99 which most non smokers average a 50-60 so it doesnt make you dumb, Ive gotten engaged before and have plenty of friends who smoke or dont smoke, so it has no affect on my social life. And I was an assistant manager before I tried going into the army, so no affect on Ambition.<br>  <br>  Plus most people dont smoke near as much as cigarette smokers who are actually physically addicted to nicotine and smoke a pack a day at least. (4 joints worth of carcinagines) There has been no known reports of cancer from just marijuana inhalation alone as well as no overdoses.<br>  <br>  ANYWAYS The thing is, PEOPLE WHO DONT SMOKE, take all the propaganda and then push the PERSONALITIES of the majority of stoners as an affect of the drug. When in actuality its THE PEOPLE's fault for being the way they are. not the drug. PERSONAL RESPONSIBILITY IS WHAT ITS ALL ABOUT. That being said, Never do anything without moderation. Especially harmful drugs like alcohol.|`|TOIOyJ10aa	i dont agree with people who think this drug will destroy ur live.<br>  i have been smoking weed for a few years, i can tell you right now: it didnt do any bad things to me. in fact, i will tell my benefits to all of u!<br>  before i started smoking, i was in a really messed up situation, my parents just got divorsed.. my grades were very low and that all got me very depressed.<br>  so, i started smoking marijuana. not because i didnt know what to do, no, because my friends offered me. i know a girl with divorsed parents, she started drinking and well, she got kicked out of school.<br>  when i was high i just felt better, maybe that sounds stupid or something, i dont really care. i started to see that there were bigger problems in the world then mine. i started watching documentaries about the third world, stopped drinking, and i swear! my depression went away. because of the fact that i wasnt constantly feeling sorry for myself, i started groing up. i actually enjoyed school! my grades went up, and believe it or not. i graduated perfectly! and i did all of my exams high as a butterfly :D<br>  so, dont judge people who smoke, i rather judge alcoholics.<br>  there is never recorded a direct death caused by marijuana, alcohol, cigarettes and skydiving killed more people!!<br>  sorry for misspellings.. i'm high!! :P (that was a joke, i'm dutch and not that good in english)|`|Ts33DJSwaa	bad way to go, stay well clear, its a slippery road down that is easier just to not get involved with...health issues, crime issues, i could go on and on but check this out instead:<br>  <br>  www.uniteagainstdrugs.com<br>  <br>  with the facts about marijuana it should be easy to make your  mind up...|`|Erdyu0bEaa	Coming from a source that smokes every single day at least twice a day. I love it. I love weed. When I am feeling stress and down, I roll an L and sit back smoke and relax. I love the feeling of being slumped after smoking and laughing at stupid **** on tv. The bad thing about it i developed a bad reputation of being a Fiend and it honestly is so not worth it. I am no longer on track with school work. I spend hours doing nothing because I no longer have motivation. Hours that could be spent doing school work i am dazing, day dreaming or just being slumped, sleeping. I hate doing any thing productive unless it is time spent getting weed or a dutch. I am a pretty girl I honestly can say, and alot of guys always tell me to stop smoking because its bring my looks down. I look tired and drain. I honestly think weed is fun in the beginning, but in the long run you loose hope and interest in things that you once loved. I all I want to do is Smoke an L. I go on missions through out the day looking for weed. And thats not the me I am use to. I miss the old me but I am stuck. But life is life. I am now going to finish typing this answer and sign off and smoke an L. Best wishes.|`|QWEq5ms0aa	i love stoners man!<br>  i smoke like once a month too. stoners r seriously so chill dude.<br>  im also 16 =]. the heath risks r not as bad as like, for instance, smoking cigs. i dnt smoke cigs, ever. they r nasty n y smoke something if it doesnt get u high.<br>  like rlly, over everything (acid, pills, coke, crack, meth, ect..) i'd smoke dope anyday. esspeically since u dnt smoke every day, u'll b fine dude. stop worrying just live and enjoy ur high its totally worth it dude.<br>  o and personally, i prefer bongs, try it its amazingggg|`|EE7sAaMlaa	im the same age and do the same, problem is mate once u start the spliffs theyll move on to heavier stuff and before u no it ur on crack all the time. risks are physcologically damaging as well as physical, its 6 times more cancerous than smoking.|`|YVRXdfGHaa	The biggest risk is that the stuff makes you stupid. That's how people end up in jail. It also makes you lazy. 30-40 years ago, I did a lot of it. But I figured out that there was too much life to be lived, and you can't get it done if you are sitting around stoned.|`|AA11515948	There is a lot of evidence floating around about weed - lots of it is positive, lots of it is negative, lots of it is biased, lots of it is exaggerated.  It's very hard to do scientifically sound experiments with a drug that is illegal in pretty much every country in the world without the biased intervention of governments, especially since it varies so much in strength, purity, etc.<br>  So basically: inconclusive!<br>  <br>  I smoke joints occasionally, about as often as you, and I'm 16 as well.  I wouldn't do it any more often because in my experience (of other people) the side-effects get worse if you do it too often.|`|vGWD8Zncaa	Smoking pot every weekend isn't nearly as bad as people who smoke multiple normal cigarettes every day!<br>  <br>  The more regularly you smoke pot, the more harmful it is to the health but the occasional joint actually potentially has some health benefits.<br>  <br>  Bottom line - it's nowhere near as bad as the radically anti-drug crowd makes it out to be.  I'm not pro-drug; but pot is just not that bad.<br>  <br>  Crack, on the other hand....|`|iqRxZ2NJaa	I don't do it ALOT, but I have done it, and I love it haa. I honestly think that it should be legalized. Alcohol sure is legal and they have people out there driving drunk killing other people, yet when you are high you can drive fine. I mean, yeah everyone has their own opinion blahblahblah.. but I don't know why people are so negative about it. And F*** NO I would never stop being friends with someone just because they smoke it, i'm friends with plenty of people who smoke it cause i'm not a hypocrit.. plus it's THEIR life, if you don't wanna smoke it then good thats you; but they shouldn't be treated bad just because they enjoy different things than you.|`|BHeBSGemaa	Smoking weed is very nice. When people get drunk, they get into fights and car accidents. This doesn't happen to stoners. I think that it's a good way to de-stress. I don't know why it's not legal, it's pretty strange that it isn't. The risks are um, coughing, bronchitis, memory problems. I have been friends with stoners all my life and they are great people.|`|Czpfs8RLaa	It is up to you what you do with your body, so yes I would be friends with a stoner (as long as it did not affect our friendship negatively) I personally think it is stupid I dont know what the specific risks are but there are risks, I myself have never smoked in my 16 years of life though so I am slightly biased|`|3kwMsbH9aa	erm theres a number of health conditions, it will make sex shorter cos you wil *** easier, you could get lung diesease, your not a dumbarse you know the risks of smoking and marijuana is no different, and i dont mind it i mean ive tryed it myself and omg but its inadvisable dude dont do it,|`|lBj1AEhIaa	marijuana is super bad.

Anyone who says different is lying. And you can get psychologically addicted to it.|`|LVFdF4wyaa	smoking marijuana can have a bad impact on your heart, brain, and lungs. It also can hurt your everyday performance in physical activity. <br>  not trying to preach but seriously, don't do it.|`|UtwMxaPzaa	I wouldn't abandon someone- it's wrong, and I wouldn't do it, but people mess up.

Quit smoking and don't ruin your life in such a young age. Good luck to you.|`|UUB398aqaa	I think its the bees knees, that stuff is just amazing.  awe-inspiring even.  there is no better end to a day than sitting on the back porch smoking some bud and watching the sunset.  smoking marijuana opens the mind to abstract thought and makes most anything better - especially art (music, paintings, movies, etc.) sex and food.<br>  <br>  on a side note, i have lost no motivation or sense of responsibility.  most non-smokers are surprised to find I smoke because they are  think all stoners are hippie dropouts based on the "truth" commercials.  <br>  <br>  it doesn't kill brain cells and there are no cases reported of cancer, lung or otherwise, from marijuana smoke, or death of any kind as a direct result of smoking marijuana.|`|Swxir2ieaa	I think it's dumb. There plenty of better things that people can spend their time and money on. I was friends with a lot of stoners in high school, but now that i've graduated, I find myself really annoyed with stoners.|`|799djs1Uaa	I don't see anything wrong with it; there are less risks to it than smoking, and it helps many people feel better.<br>  <br>  It has absolutely nothing PHYSICALLY addicting, though the feeling of calm I'm told can be psychologically addicting. It lowers the blood pressure so if that's a problem with you... Smoking it also increases the heart rate, again if it's a medical problem..<br>  <br>  The biggest problem with marijuana, of course, is that it's illegal. The first time you get 'caught' with a baggie of it you get it confiscated and are given a verbal warning, plus they tell your parents if you're under 18 or 16, if you've no prior convictions. If you have more than I think it's 5 grams you get in trouble for having more than 5 grams of a class C drug, and if you have prior convictions, especially violent crimes (which makes no sense; marijuana calms better than many drugs...), you'll probably go to trial, possibly prison.|`|ctjz1Btiaa	Marijuana smoke contains many of the same carcinogens and toxins found in tobacco smoke, sometimes in higher concentrations. <br>  <br>  The daily use or intake of one to three joints or ‘cones’, appears to produce the same lung diseases and potential cancer risks as smoking five times as many cigarettes.<br>  <br>  Effects on the body?<br>  <br>  Central Nervous System<br>  <br>  Effects include changes of distribution of blood flow to the brain, inducing defects of short-term memory, anxiety, confusion, depression, difficulty in concentrating and thinking. It also affects educational development and can result in decreased ambition.<br>  <br>  Immune System<br>  <br>  Effects include a possible decrease in resistance to Herpes Simplex 2, as THC or Tetrahydrocannabinol prevents B cells from producing interferon, which is a substance that the body uses to resist viruses and cancer.<br>  <br>  Marijuana smokers also appear to be more susceptible to cancers of the upper jaw, mouth, larynx, head and neck.<br>  <br>  Lungs<br>  <br>  Effects include rebound bronchoconstriction, which is very dangerous for asthmatics. It also causes worse lung damage than tobacco smoke.<br>  <br>  Heart and Blood Pressure<br>  <br>  Increases of up to 50% in heart rate and increases of up to 16 points in diastolic blood pressure have been reported. These effects could be quite serious in individuals with diabetes or heart disease.<br>  <br>  Reproduction and Fertility<br>  <br>  Marijuana decreases blood levels of testosterone, it also affects sperm motility and reduces sperm counts.<br>  <br>  .<br>  <br>  Two studies conducted on the children of mothers who smoked marijuana, demonstrated that the infants were more often born premature with a low birth weight and were more frequently born with major birth defects.<br>  <br>  Another study of 204 pairs of children of mothers who had smoked marijuana before and during pregnancy, showed a tenfold increase in the risk of leukaemia.|`|dOSId1NIaa	I have never done it and never will.<br>  I had a friend who smoked, not often, but once and a while. One time when he was high he went into a seizure and died a few hours later at the hospital. =[<br>  The hospital said it was cause by something in the weed, like possibally a chemical used while growing it. I'm quite awear that cases like this are increadably rare, but I base the way I feel about marijuana on it.|`|r8ukAgWkaa	Well I know people who smoke occasionally and only with their friends. They seem to be fine, but those who are constantly stoned are screwed, because long-term smoking and an addiction to pot can be dangerous, as it leads to cancer, lung problems, and problems with the immune system.|`|dyv2sqtxaa	that is really bad for you. even if you do it once a month, its gna turn into 4 times a day. if u continue 2 do this, its gna either have u end up broke, in prison, or dead. don't do it. i would get help. if i were ur friend i'd call da copz on u. u should be ashamed of urself for doing sucha  terrible thing 2 urself.|`|nE25uwbxaa	It's completly up to you man, i think they are safer than ciggeretts. safer than beer, but those arent really thing to b proud of.<br>  <br>  I don't think pot is a bad thing though,, I personally wouldn't do it but it is safe and mind expanding.|`|pgF6i0L4aa	well lots of kids do it but if ur into sports or anything stay away from that ****.

Simple, soft first kiss. You don't have to make a special effort to make it a cute affair. It will happen on its own. You'll be nervous. I was. :) Just stay calm and remind yourself that it's no big thing. You're not expected to be an expert the first time. Just work on it and figure out what works for the two of you. Do NOT make it a Hollywood sloppy tongue involved kiss. It can be really messy and you'll feel stupid. Just talk it slow and remind yourself that whether you are kinda silly about it or it ends up being picture perfect that it will be memorable in a good way and he loves you no matter what. You go girl!|`|45xSfWBoaa	Am i have been told im a good kisser so il just tell you what i do. . .start off with your mouth closed and kiss him slowly and then open your mouth and use tounge(but slowly). . .and pull away before he does(so he will want more and not be board of you)|`|9k04hJucaa	well i mean if you are going to kiss him then tilt your head a little bit so your noses wont bump into each other also I mean there is  no right or wrong way to do it, you should give him little hints if you think its the right time|`|v9ElQeC1aa	I like it when my g/f kisses my neck and works her way up to my ears and then to my face.|`|cxj3FjKPaa	Surprise always work.

5530308b542f6343c54abe1993af315caa	Well, I think two people have to build trust in a relationship.  It is important to talk about your feelings with your girlfriend in terms of what your expectations are.  Does she know that you only want to date her?  Even if you two were not a forty minute drive away and lived closer, that might not make a difference in terms of your trust or lack of in her.  Perhaps she is waiting until you are ready to tell her that you love her in order for her to commit just to you.  Everyone is different though.|`|AA10790730	if you can't handle the relationship, don't get into it.

80a513b8f2840553c99dd4e0440c98b9aa	Depends on how big you are.  I am a small sized decent looking girl and I think alot of bigger guys are good looking especially if they have good personalities and/ or funny.  However if you were like huge that may be a deal breaker.  I would not want to be with someone who I feel does not take care of themselves.|`|OkRbLSo2aa	No....  size doesn't count ... for me at least..    I think us females look for a connection,  when conversation flows, personality also, but keep in mind what one female finds attractive in a man's personality may not be attractive to another,  when a guy treats us with respect and compliments us and is generally interested in what we have to say is a bonus.   Being a good listener and not offering solutions to problems is the key, you see, men naturally want to solve problems....   but, when a woman wants to 'vent' and talk...  she just wants to share, she isnt actually asking you for the answer to the problem....   except of course if you are asked for your opinion or advice. <br>  I just think you haven't met the right girl yet.  Also, when you speak to a woman, look into her eyes... and smile..     Good luck..   You sound nice to me!|`|KqPR3ZYuaa	When you see a girl do you notice her personality or looks first?

6734a09baf5a7a9a316317030c6a5946aa	well you married young and then did not wait to have a child.  You both basically did not give eachother any time to grow together, to understand eachother wants and needs in life.  We all change physically and mentally as we grow older.  Financial reponsibilties can also harm a healthy relationship.  After the honeymoon is over and reality and responibilty settles in the vows that you both took together becomes very obscure every passing day.  Together with Love, Compromise, Commitment and Sharing Responibilties makes a Marriage work.  Marriage is a hell alot of work, which non of us realize it before we take on it.  It takes two to Tango, are you both willing too?    After a child some men feel being neglected, because now they have to share their wivies with their kid(s).  Yes we men are big babies.  Talk it over, make time for eachother.    Before involving a marriage consuelor, talk it over without being judgemental (not easy), make a list of things that you both have now started to dislike about eachother.  Work towards changing some and make compromises on the others.  Go back to the basics, think about what made you like this person what was it? the touch, the feel, the look, the smell....  Try to be more creative in the bedroom and not judgemental.  If you don't like something he wants, politely tell him why and he should do that same.    I hope you got some good advice on here, and good luck.|`|16dd17e16e885d5039db572d5079e20caa	Divorce should always be the last possible resource.  Counseling works great, but sometimes its just time.  Being a mom is hard work.  Talking of divorce should be crossed off your discussion list because it gives both of you an out.  There is a book---read it.  It really works, I know.  Its called Light His Fire.  There is the alternate version for him if he would read it, but its not necessary.  Its great and makes sense.  I was 25 when I read the book and made it work.      Good Luck and don't give up|`|41d848a6254cc353a10a3682d5e561faaa	Welcome to the real world.  You don't need to be yourself all over again 2 years ago. What you need to do is to find some ways how to keep "the fire burning".. The only thing that the past can help you is to try to recall all the good points that your husband liked about you.  Try to apply it again.  But don't be consistent because it will just bore you.  Be creative, be alive!!!     Always remember, when you two got married, it was the two of you and only you both started that life together, kids may and have come along but never neglect your relationship, for time will come (that is..) and in the end all will be left is just the two of you.|`|7e1baf1389ee729d645d9fe9842c6839aa	I'm having a similar problem where we lost the spark.  We're not talking divorce but it just feels awkward at times.  Some things to help are taking a vacation together.  Leaving for a weekend with a friend and just doing your own thing for awhile.  Also, don't be a nag.  One of the big reasons that my wife and I don't get along anymore is she nags way too much.  Before we got married, money wasn't an issue, now it's constantly on her mind and she's always telling me not to buy a pack of gum or whatever because she says we can't afford it (She overreacts too).  So it then becomes an argument.  Chill out, enjoy life, don't nag, give each other your space and do things spontaneously.|`|AA11837483	That's the reason why I discourage people get married too young because the young couples are not knowing what they want or looking.. well, put this aside afterall is a fact.    Now, why does both of you talking on divorce issue?  Has your husband done something wrong that you cannot forgive or you did something wrong to him which makes him feel no hope in this marriage?  There is always a reason for everything.    Please have a final heart talk wtih him and see whether can compromise with each other.  If you cannot tolerance his weak points, same goes with your weak points, pls do give and take.  If because of financial difficulties which make both of you always argued, then I'm sorry but we can't help much on this issue.  Both you and your husband need to put more effort to raise the family.  Good Luck.|`|AA10865083	Why don't you both try counseling first. You did marry very young but I wouldn't be so quick to head to divorces court without looking into  your options first. Good Luck|`|123bae771e240e3462a9113441e3358aaa	no - it is hard to get that newness back as when you first started seeing each other. Try having a date night again where you just go and have a fun time and enjoy each other. It is so worth the babysitting money.

Think about your child first and realize that spiting up should be a last resort. That being said...the only way for you two to find out what the problem is, is sitting down and being honest about...everything. Hire a sitter, get a grandparent...someone to look after your son and then talk it out with your husband. Tell him how you feel. Find out from him whats bothering him and talk things out. Lay all of your cards on the table....and go from there.|`|AA11296385	Deal with any issues--get counseling if needed.    To get that crush feeling back is a matter of biochemistry--doing new and interesting things together can produce the right chemicals again.|`|553b55ec2d0ec88cb118ca82ec5bcf06aa	Everybody goes through that period of..well...boredom.  You will find new things about each other that excite you.  This is no reason to divorce.  Find things that you enjoy talking about.  Watch your wedding video.  Find a hobby you can do together, even if it is something one person likes better than the other.  I am 22 and my husband is 26, I got married at 19.  You're not too young.  Just try to find the beauty in one another that is inside you and remember why you love one another.  Take a little romantic get away.  Or just go out on a date.  You will find that you can love each other more every single day if you try.  Marriage is something that has to be worked at.  My husband and I are still very in love and are amazed at how we enjoy one another's company and love another more every day.  We have been married a little over 3 years.  AGE has nothing to do with anything, we are much more mature that many older people..maturity is a factor, not age.  Pray about your marriage everyday and you will see a dramatic improvement!|`|d5c6828c0098ceb16349abb7d92482aeaa	GET FREAKY IN THE BED!!! You gotta spice it up. Trust me, We have been married five years now and we went through it for 2 years before we finally realized what to do. ( be open about your relationship and go hit the sack, try new stuff) you 'll both feel the same way you used to. Don't split up!|`|AA11630537	Did you hurt him unintentionally? may be the past?  If not then its ok. Males are very enraged when hurt by females, especially the ones they love.  If you are mutually seperating then its ok. May be you headed for a relationship too early. If you still wanna continue someone has to give up and if you have brought in the divorce matter it would be you!  Sometimes its hard to give in to someone who is at fault may be but try it. Think about your son!  If you want to get the flame back, try giving him extra importance for sometime, then when he reallizes, your extra attention, try to ignore him. you can flirt or be more friendly with some of his or your friend. Insecurity ties a male back. If he does not feel insecure, appoint detectives to find a reason, may be you have another rival!  Cheers, its ok. He's all yours!

Todo lo que haz hecho hasta ahora me parece excelente, pero creo que detecto algo no muy bueno, no me creas del todo porque evidentemente no tengo conocimiento pleno de lo que pueda estar sucediendo, pero desgraciadamente los hombres somos, la mayoria de las veces, unos patanes: muy probablemente este con alguien mas, me da pena decirtelo de esta manera pero debes de tomarlo en consideracion. Lo que yo te puedo recomendar, desde mi miuy humilde punto de vista, es que para empezar te quieras mas a ti misma, nadie puede realmente amar a nadie sino se ama uno primero, valorate, cuidate, quierete, apapachate, ya despues de que te sientas amada por ti entonces ya estas en posicion de amar a alguien mas. Despues de que hagas esto te aseguro que te podras dar cuenta de muchas cosas que por la "ceguera" de tu amor por l no habias visto o simplemente no habias querido ver. Alguna ocasion escuche una frase de alguien que sabe mas de esto: "Muchas veces decimos: sin ti, sin tu amor: me muero; creo que esto debe de ir mas alla, te amo tanto y me amo tanto a mi mismo que sin ti y sin tu amor no morire" Analizalo y mucha suerte mi querida amiga.|`|3eb8f5998e9b8d9b7f73b1043f764b5aaa	Gracias por tu relato, Hoy are algo en mi vida que por preocupaciones del trabajo no lo hago, Mil GRACIAS !!

AA11847182	I think that is way too much of a communication.emotional relationsip thtey have going on for them to be opposite sex and both be married. It just leaves the door way to wide open.   In my opinion he needs to not communicate with this woman like this just to let you be rest assured you have nothing to worry about. Thats disrespectful to you as his wife. and of her of her husband.

He has other things on his mind and is not prioritizing things that are important to you.  When you get a moment alone with him, dont nag him but, let him know how much this hurts you.  Also, remember there could be worse things so, you should also remind yourself of all the great things you love about him.|`|AA11719207	just because he doesn't remember things doesn't mean he doesn't love you - men think and focus on different details as women and sadly enough it can make a woman feel or think they are unloved -- but it's just that details like that aren't typically something a man focuses on.  Think of other things he does for you - provides financially for you - hugs you - wants you to sit and watch football with him - it doesn't matter that you don't like football - that's not the focus - the focus is he WANTS you to be WITH him. For a man, that is love.

AA12346641	If you both are young I would let your mom say something especially because I don't think his mother sees how miserable she is making the both of you. Your mom would be best to try to talk to her about it. Your boyfriend may want to stay out of it for a little while until you both know there is nothing else you can do about her stopping, so that it isn't weird at home for him. I hope this helps and i hope everything works out.|`|AA11318723	this is your problem? are you going to marry him or something? if not, why bother?|`|AA11625178	I would keep your mom out of it. She has a place with you but not in this situation. If she gets involved I think things will get even worse, not better. Your forseeing that correctly. I think it really is your boyfriend place to stand up to his mom. If he truly likes you and wants this to work out then he needs to let his mom know that's where he stands. Also, why is his mom doing this? Is there an age difference between the two of you? Are you a very young couple where his mom's word should have some pull or maybe your relationship should be monitored? Maybe that is something to take into consideration as well. If not, and both of you are at an age where you can tell his mom to "butt out" a bit then approach it nicely at first and then tell her straight up.|`|1b29d63e60af83364795de8f8bad3819aa	I'm sorry you're in trouble. But you should let your mom speak with his mom. Have faith in your mom, she will make things better! Good luck!|`|55a405f9faa8a82293be4a246051376caa	your bf needs to talk to her.|`|44e865b82a13e6bc776c2049b49eece2aa	I just went through this my guy had to speak up to his mom, and for now she is sort of ok but u can tell she hates me but ya know who r u dating him or her that is the way i looked at it. she is going have to face it u r going to be dating him and ur going to be around him and he is going to be aroud her so she needs to grow up and realize that you two are going to be dating so ask ur self what do u want|`|AA11610394	This is really sad cuz her behaviour could make him want you even more. Your Mom should not get into this. He should find out what the problem is by asking her right out. Honesty is best. If you guys drive you should be able to at least go out alone for cheeseburgers. Life is full of compromising to make relationships work. She sounds so controlling. I knew someone who had that kind of Mom and once I did lose it and say something to her and she actually heard me. But he still ended up becoming gay and leaving home cuz she ran his life.

d2fb57e7db7cccd794cddae76b0b5d09aa	No it's not wrong for an eighth grader to ask a tenth grader out of that person is in love with the other one. Even if you aren't in love with them, you just like him or whatever, it's still not wrong. You only get one life, and i believe that you should live your life to the fullest. I'm trying to date my best friend (he is 16) but i don't know how, but i will figure out a way because if you want something you should go for it no matter what anyone else thinks or whatever. You shouldn't be shy. Being shy doesn't get you anywhere, i know because i am really shy when it comes to guys!!!! Age doesn't matter if you are in love so go for it honey.|`|AA12165010	pull him aside and tell him how u feel or write him a note if your too shy.

AA12367038	You can approach Iranian Consulate in Netherland. You can write to Presidents of Iran and Netherland. Also you can get help of Human Rights Group. Use Google for searching their addresses, sights, procedures etc. Since you do not know about his where abouts it will take time but do not loose hope. Keep on trying.    Best luck.
63c56285e0450bee3540f2d273671f20aa	I think it's more than ok. There is nothing wrong with people of differant faiths being together. You can learn a lot from each other.|`|AA12217087	well, the bible says not to go out woith someone with a different religion because that person will start practising that persons belefs.but if you really like her go for it|`|3fedb68a596b98ff73a811b73f860dcbaa	If its true love, love conquers all, despite what religion the two people are. If its just a fling or you don't think you'll be with that person for very long, and religion is extremely important to you and them, just cut it loose. Its not worth it.|`|74bd1cc66cc079003e5bbf43de482d47aa	As long as the two of you agree with it it's OK, but if the relationship becomes serious it might be a problem for the feature. Good Luck

c4d984353c85c3f0163204d4bf29719faa	The most likely way to succeed is this.  Get a group activity going.  Like a little party or 5-6 person outing to a hang out spot.     Then say this..."Hey Susie; Me, John, Kevin, Stephanie and a few others are getting together Saturday night, you want to come hang out with us?"    From long experience, this is the most likely method to succeed.  If she has any interest in you, she will go hang out on this semi date.  After that, you are in like Flynn my friend.|`|c78a575e839f4afd620bdf67c3257b9daa	Interesting, you like her because she is "diff rent from other girls" but you only "know each other to the surface, and no details." Sounds like a contradictory statement to me....|`|cc74dfdd50e575c62b9f39eaceed730faa	Ask her, that is the only way she will know and you will get an answer.|`|AA12241120	You seem shallow. I'd give up now.
9397cc9226bb971cf5c50a1676bb4351aa	Because deep down no matter how much you say you hate the person you at one time had feelings for them and it hurts to know that the feelings they had for you are now being transferred to someone else.|`|AA12256785	Maybe you don't want them to be happy or you realize "you" are lonely while all the other people that were in your life are settling down.. Or you possible do have feelings for them but you do not want to except it, meaning you are ignoring your own feelings..|`|AA11107557	The feeling of being replaced and left out. it hurts!|`|AA12151303	If you feel hurt knowing that an ex is getting married, then there is some left over feelings...you may try and say you have no more feelings for this particular person, but something is bothering you on why this other person found happiness....take a deep look inside of yourself....be the better person and wish them well.|`|AA10451155	i think a few reason, one because you dont want someone to fill the space of what you used to have.  also jealously, if the ex find a mate before you it seems as if you are being replaced in a way.  sometimes its hard to remember why you broke up after so long.  but you need to remember that you did and there were reasons.  Its not a bad thing to be hurt,  it shows you are alive.  good luck fighting the good fight, we have all been there|`|358795d0fbbf1db3dcca7b3beb206aa2aa	simply because you do still have feelings for them.  As bad as you dont want to think so, some wehre in all the dis-like for them, there is some feelings. it's funny how we can still miss or think about someone who put us through so much. I wonder myself about your question.|`|2df00a29b9674187d3c22b4d7925be0caa	I believe you still somewhat have  feelings for this particular person or you wouldn't feel hurt.Or maybe your feelings are telling you that you should have been the one getting married to this particular person,or still emotionally involved.And maybe you feel like he or she has done more for that particular person than you did to even be asked for their hand in marriage(jealousy).

If sex is involved and he only calls for that I would surely not want to call him or have him call me.       If sex isn't involved then I suppose a call wouldn't hurt.   Just don't expect the call to lead to true romance if it isn't what he is looking for
91f1aaed02ae4974793180bd015d549caa	Write up an anecdote of one of your favorite memories of a time that you and your mom spent together.  Type it up nicely or have someone write it in calligraphy and frame it.  Moms are really sentimental, she will love it.  And next time, START PLANNING YOUR MOM'S B-DAY PRESENT MORE THAN 2 DAYS IN ADVANCE!!!!|`|AA11946920	clothings and card|`|AA12218417	Give her something from the heart tell her how much you love her and how glad you are that she is your mother.besides some kids don't even have a mom or a dad. Or you could give her something she has always wanted(a bnlouse,swkirt, watch,Ect...) In hope my answer helps you .Hope this is your mom's best Birthday ever|`|AA10308244	I think you should ask your mom if there is anything in particular she needs or would like.  I often wish people would do this instead of just buying any ole thing that might not be wanted.  She may say not to worry about getting anything.  Then you have to ask the person closest to her if they know.  Best (but too late in the day for this now) is to listen all during the yr...she will mention what she wishes she could get sometime.  In the end remember, it is the thought really that counts.|`|1687fcba84dcdce354c1cffe9824fdb1aa	Find an old photo of you and her out of an album,get maybe a nice silver frame if you can afford it,and frame it.Im a mum,mums love stuff like that.all sentimental|`|644dad7f80e9014eca484c2009492557aa	take her out to get her hair done or a manicure. perhaps go shopping buy her an out fit. or lunch and a movie.

You see even when it is not long distance you want trust in a relationship. If it's long distance you Must trust eachother that neither one of you will fault and that both will try hard to stay together. I have this relationship right now. I trust him more than anyone and I know that he'd never betray me. He feels the same way towards me... I hope you can have the same relationship as him and me.|`|AA12019756	It's probably not going to work if you have trust issues.  Even if you're not long distance, it won't work out.  Trust is something you must have or your relationship will have major issues.|`|AA10140201	I don't think it's possible.  You have to have trust of your partner or you'll spend you time apart always wondering. If you can't trust him/her then you need to just break it off with them. (By the way, that was the easy solution, for the really hard one read on.)  Or...  You could take a leap of faith and trust that your partner loves you, respects you and would never do anything to harm you and carry on with the relationship.    A long distance relationship is very hard especially if one or both partners is unable to travel; give it some time and if it doesn't look like you'll ever get together then you've got an e-mail pal at the least.|`|a9fc4423c53791934e9a009b160a4144aa	If theres trust issues, there is no relationship

Love is necessary, don't you think?  Love is the glue that binds people.  However, I also think that if two people really love eachother it might be so scary their feelings for one another that they actually need to be very far apart.|`|643a0f81f0e12099f9141bbd51a671e5aa	Natural selection|`|1ccee5f1b7bb7ee3936a0738f70084feaa	it happens cause there is that one and only person made for you and evan if he is over the other side of the world you will meet one day and love is a sin and love is a heart braker and love is **** but love is a happy thing for some and a hurtful thing for others
f87b49d97828b4858f5bf6b10fa08cebaa	You sound very hesitant about him. That should answer your question.  Go with your instincts and meet him somewhere else.  There will less stress and you can really talk.  If he doesn't want to do that then you were right, about the sex, and his real intentions. Sounds like you are doing well on your own with the new house.  Build up your self esteem and place more emphasis on your total needs rather than allowing a guy or anyone to call the plays that will affect your life.Before getting into any relationship weigh the pros and cons.Lots of Q&A have to be discussed and agreed upon to plan a future. Sometimes you can love someone but it would disasterous for you to be in a relationship with them( spouses w/abusers of kids or self-emotional or physical or financial or drains your family from it's happiness in any manner,someone who wants to use you for $, cheats,lies to you,uses drugs, alcoholic,etc.)But you know him and his actions.  Look at his actions and see if they always match his word and promises.  Lots of luck.|`|8bd0ddbaf2d11096874142f7abd99d04aa	...maybe before he comes ova... to ur housee... then u could talk it over about what u thinik first..|`|1a69b8aacd22374321528fd39fbd9a61aa	oh yeah - go out for sure!  and take separate cars... you don't want to end up in bed together so quickly.  it'll never work out in the end.|`|91c4d3b9007420c6c2f599286c3cd60baa	you should do what you think is right ask him out or let him go to your crib|`|AA12351541	Yes, i think you should go out together.. Just to be sure !  ;-)|`|AA11683605	Call him and tell him you're interested in talking things over a nice dinner in a restaurant, but that he's welcome to take a quick peek at your new house before going out .  Have him pick you up and look "ready to leave" (eg. shoes on, purse in hand).  Show him around and make your way toward the door when the tour is done.  Kill two birds with one stone. He'll get the hint.|`|75dd6b5381478871e023d928f5e705f3aa	GO OUT FIRST TO SOME PLACE WITH A LOT OF PEOPLE THERE...

Don't bring him to your home until you've been dating again for about 6 months...go to his place instead. See how he reacts to that idea. And you can have sex anywhere!!
AA11820856	The key word is almost, let things be as they may|`|AA10091182	Stay out of it.  It's none of your business.

Lust is the desire for selfish fufillment, love simply seeks to give without the expectation of anything in return. Lust is in a hurry, love can wait. You know you're in love when you can look past the other person's flaws, faults, quirks, and unchangeables.    Love is NOT an emotion, it's an act of the will. Love is not a feeling, if you want to truly love someone, you must will yourself to do so. Love remains... it simply is...|`|AA11787788	For men...LOVE= NOT knowing weather to punch her in the kisser or just to kiss her.....|`|AA10530337	when I was able to fart and belch in front of him without shocking myself or him.

And every time you see her your stomach feels like it's being flipped upside down and inside out. And most of all, you'll know when no matter what color, creed, religion or disability she has, all you see when you're with her is the woman you love.

CKnHMYHnaa	I think its unaccepable behavior.  If he was just looking for friends then he would not have posted that he wanted one-nighters with no strings.  Reel him in!|`|SsfnitjXaa	I guess he is not as much of a workaholic as you said.  How can he be mad at you for sex text when he is doing this?  Yes this is cheating.|`|cCJvsEPsaa	intent to cheat.|`|0KmJwYunaa	Depends on whether you consider sex to be the basis of your relationship or not.<br>  <br>  There are some people that have open relationships and for them, the only problem would be why he hadn't asked you for permission before creating the account.   For some, the relationship in a marriage is more than sex and a desire for variety in sex does not detract from the marital relationship.   Of course, an open relationship may not be for you but you can still take a lesson from those who do in that isn't it more important that he kept it secret from you?   Why is it that he created the account if he knew it would bother you?   If there was something more that he wanted in his sex life, why didn't he tell you about it?<br>  <br>  Keep in mind that it's easy to create an account on these websites but nearly impossible to get rid of the accounts so it may just be an old account that he hasn't been using in a long time.|`|b54f3498c5b49790abdf2ee8cc8e9d1daa	YOU, yourself go make you a name up and start talking to him and wait for one week..Tell him u want to meet him at so and so....then see if he really wants to cheat or just passing time!

Of course you were still wrong in doing that, but his offense is even worse! If he had this up for 6 months, how do you know he never acted on it?! Looking for old friends, like on myspace or whatever is one thing, but blatantly stating that he wants' one night stands with no strings?!?!' What in the world was his explanation of this to you? Seriously, how do you know for sure that he never followed through with it? <br>  Was he a member on that site before you two were married or was this during your marriage?<br>  You need to decide whether or not you can still trust him and if you still want to be with him. Even God says that divorce is acceptable for situations of adultery. If you two can work things out and trust one another, of course that would be best but if so you really do need to go to couples counseling.<br>  Good luck to you and hope everything works out ok.|`|hOUEIEmBaa	You can take it any way you want. I am not sure if fantasizing is cheating or not. Unless of course he actually did something. Obviously he wants to know he can still be in the game. Just because your on a site and advertising, doesn't mean your doing anything. Been on there for years and have had an opportunity or two but never pursued any but its fun looking and teasing. Post one yourself if it would make it any easier and see what he thinks. Let me know I will look you up.|`|OCzaSGU6aa	Sorry but, why were you on Adult Friend Finder in the first place?|`|JWVZc4rnaa	I think that is sad. 
AA11812186	Welcome to reality.|`|ZzEAc5ecaa	get rid of the computer .. quick |`|tOdjjeAmaa	Myspace isn't like an "adult friend finder" site lol... Lots of people (I'd say most) have them just to keep up with old friends. My husband and I both have them, and Facebooks. He probably didn't say anything because he knew you'd freak out about it. That's how my husband is, lol... They just don't want a confrontation. He hasn't really done anything wrong. If you have read his messages and stuff and there is nothing to worry about (like cheating)... why worry? I get the same way about my husband sometimes. But I think you, like me, have trust issues for some reason. I'd try to deal with that first before you jump down his throat for not doing anything wrong. I get really immature sometimes and my mind will start racing and I will get onto my husband about nothing... I'm realizing that if I keep this up, it will just push him further away- so be careful and choose your battles. Good luck|`|19118ef0907ef0b119cc1faefbfca6f1aa	  Stop being such a controlling b-tch.  Your husband has a right to a life of his own.  Your insecurities could land you in divorce court.  Grow up and get a life.|`|3bAd5B4Gaa	I'd yank the internet out of our house so fast his head would spin.  My daughter and her husband nearly divorce because of crap on MySpace.  I chewed both of them out over the immaturity of ever thinking MySpace was more important.|`|kvcIdORcaa	It is Myspace... You realize people these days grow up with the internet and e-mail and a Myspace/Facebook account right? So if they get married one day they suddenly have to close all their accounts? Doesn't make sense. You're obviously insecure and don't trust your husband with anything.|`|JWVZc4rnaa	I think you are over reacting. It is just a myspace account. Its harmless. Isn't he allowed to have friends? Obviously your family means alot to him if he put yalls pic up. Let it go!|`|I3VfRjYLaa	Why should he tell you.|`|53A8kobkaa	You sound really possessive.  You need to give him some space or he'll be gone soon.  Everyone needs some privacy.  So what if he has a MySpace account?  You don't own him.  He is an individual being with his own mind.  Let him be.  If my GF did that shat to me, I'd leave her.|`|581JsaGsaa	it honestly all comes down to what you agree on. if you agreed not to do these things, then he should not do them, because it disrupts trust even if he is doing nothing wrong. now is the time for you to create your own myspace site and add him as a friend. make it clear you are married. sometimes people like to engage in a little escapism and it is usually harmless... but again, it all depends on what YOU as a couple in YOUR marriage agree on, and noone can really judge your arrangements. |`|7d3b7bf0383cc8e855b25d8834ab440faa	My husband started out on myspace which led to yahoo360.  Yahoo360 led to him having computer and phone sex with various women for almost two years until he decided he was done with our 12 year marriage and walked out.  He left me and our two young children.  I didn't know this was all going on because he started hiding the cell phone bill from me and carrying his laptop everywhere with him.  He also did a lot of his computer sex at work.  He lied and cheated and was completely arrogant about what he did.  He is 40 years old and started dating a 19 year old that he is now living with.  I found out about his online and phone affairs by an anonymous email to me.  Your advantage is that you know now and can do something about it.  You can make the decision instead of the decision being made for you.  My divorce was final last year and the kids and I are doing our best to start a new life.  Good luck and God bless.|`|CaJVaSItaa	You've been married 6yrs. Don't let something like this come between you two. <br>  There are other things you could think of to make your marriage a lot better.<br>  Concentrate on the kids, on your life, on your family and home, leave him to his "toys". Hopefully he will realize that nothing else is better than the real thing. <br>  |`|g6n3OnmSaa	  I'm not sure I would be any more worried about my husband having a myspace account than I would be by him going to work everyday or out bowling with his buddies.  If he has it in him to start one, then he'll do it someway and I'm not sure myspace is really anymore convenient than any other way.  One thing I would be wierd about is pictures of the kids or me in his account.  I just worry about stuff like that.|`|tKqOGuqKaa	Are you his mother or his wife? He doesn't need your approval to have a MySpace page. He used his work e-mail address because he knew how you would react. If he had told you "I'm creating and MySpace page" would you have said OK, or would you have berated him and said something like "I told you how I feel about it, I forbid it, or something along those lines?<br>  He is not a teenage boy. He had family photos up for Pete's sake. He told you to check it out, so right there should tell you he isn't hiding anything. If he is going to cheat, believe me it's not because he has a MySpace page....In my opinion, no spouse should feel like they are being reprimanded by their parents. It's a partnership. Sometimes you will agree, sometimes you won't. You have to pick your battles. This one seems silly to me.<br>  <br>  Added:<br>  I've read a few answers after mine that go on about how MySpace or some other computer site ruined their relationship. That isn't really true.  You were with men that had the intention of cheating. True the internet made it easier for them, they would have figured out another way if it wasn't for these sites. Having a MySpace page, Facebook page or a Yahoo 360 page doesn't mean he's looking for another woman. Men that cheat using these sites are cheaters. It's not the sites fault.|`|iCVejUGZaa	I went through the same thing with my husband.  He had logged on to Ebay with a different account than the one we have.  When I saw it, that got my attention.  From that, I discovered his secret email account, where I discovered he had been chatting with other women he met through this, to put it mildly, "singles" website.  He even had personal pictures on there, with one really personal, intimate closeup shot of a part of his body, and one shot taken at our wedding of him standing alone in a tux.  When I confronted him, he denied it until I showed him the evidence.  Then, he confessed.  He even met up with 1 particular girl.  He pretended to be single.  Took off his wedding ring.  Nothing happened, though.  From what he says, they mainly talked about work.  I confirmed this by calling the girl myself.<br>  Anyways, I'm old fashioned as well.  When this happened, it turned my life upside down.  I forgave him, and we have 1 child with another on the way.  I can't say I completely trust him now.  Over the years, it has gotten better, though.<br>  The good thing is that your husband had put pictures of your children on the webpage.  At least he is not posing as single.  However, I would be concerned about the female "friends."  He may not be cheating now, but if you hadn't discovered this, who's to say he wouldn't have done so 5 years down the road?  |`|jfQJ6kRdaa	You know, we can say all we want about relationships are built on trust and honesty...but the world we live in sometimes prevents us from being like that. I have a myspace and I can honestly say that myspace can be the root of all evil when it comes to committed relationships. We start to wonder how your significant other knows a particular somebody, etc. I know first hand it can ruin a relationship... because you start to suspect cheating, etc. <br>  <br>  Anyway, if this is something you and your husband agreed to he should have at least mentioned it to you. And if he's going to have the myspace, he should allow you access to it. That would be the price for having a myspace when both of you agreed not to have one. The fact that he put his family picture actually says alot. He isnt hiding the fact he is married with children. You need to let him know that you are disappointed that he didnt tell you about this and did it anyway. How would he feel if you went and did something without telling him or did something anyway after both of you agreed.<br>  <br>  I think it would be ok to keep the myspace as long as you have access to it whenever you want. And tell him that it's the only way you'll approve of the account. If not, get rid of it! Myspace can create a lot of drama.....|`|mkP9bqOJaa	Facebook and MySpace are both huge realities.  And, they are both fun, yet, could be damaging if you are insecure, which, unfortunately for your husband, sounds like you are.  However, if you have trust, shouldn't be an issue.  My question is WHY in the hell would you pull off the family picture and the picture of the kids?  The two things that prove he's proud to have a family?  My boyfriend has Facebook and I barely know any of his friends and he's a lot younger than I am.  I trust him.  I look and some of these girls are insanely cute, but, he's with ME.  If he emails them, whatever.  If he texts them, whatever.  they are friends - I trust in him.  We had a few rough spots not too long ago where I wasn't sure whether I should stay in the relationship, he omitted a few facts from me and told me that he didn't want to hurt my feelings but it was something he really wanted.  I told him to have some faith in me and not assume I'd react like other people, however, he can't have faith in you if you are going to act like you are now.  You have NO reason to react like a possessive wife.  MySpace and Facebook ARE primarily for old contacts and something to do.  Some, it's to see how many friends you can get.  Some, it's to show off their family and friends.  Which, with your family pics and kids on there, he was.  Get some self confidence and trust in your relationship.  Maybe he'll start confiding in you.  If not, you will lose him.  And highly unlikely to someone on one of those sites.|`|uKV0l5h9aa	You need to be able to trust your Husband.<br>  <br>  I don't know if he has does something wrong or not.  But I find it hard to believe you discovered this by accident.  You either suspect something is going on - so you should ask (vs. sneak around behind his back).<br>  <br>  You have to talk to each other - not sneak around each other.

889909dffa7864947bb5b253391cba7caa	Personally, I think jewelry is overrated. Sure, it's expensive and shiny, but it's not really creative. However, if she's REALLY into jewelry, go for it, but get her something unique, something that says "wow".<br>  <br>  Consider her hobbies. Does she like to read? What kind of books? you could get her a little "mini library" of books she's been dying to read. Since she's pretty spiritual, you could find her a really nice, decorative Bible, and write a love note for her to use as a bookmark :)<br>  <br>  If you guys have been considering getting a pet, puppies are great holiday gifts. Just be reeeeeally careful with that one. Make sure she really actually wants one, and that you're ready to take on the responsibility. <br>  <br>  Or, a vacation is always an awesome gift. Depending on your budget, you could take her to Europe, go on a road trip or camping, or go skiing/snowboarding. Time together is always a great gift :)<br>  <br>  gooooood luck<br>  <br>  |`|dt30O77naa	I was in the same situation two years ago. I came up with an idea that worked great. I took my girlfriend on a date close to christmas. We went to see a movie she wanted to see. Then went to her favorite restaraunt. After that I took her shopping, and told her about how much I was willing to spend. She picked out lots of things she wanted. However I told her about 100$ lower than what I wanted to spend. I bought something that she was looking at but would have put her over what I told her she could spend. I had that gift waiting for her on christmas morning. <br>  <br>  I liked this idea because I was a date, she got things I knew she wanted, and she also got a nice suprise at the end. I think she really enjoyed it. Even if she was a little sad about not having a gift to open on christman morning..... but that just made the suprise better|`|0wkSf58waa	My instant reaction is to tell you to get her a Nintendo Wii...but it doesn't sound like she's into games lol. Maybe something warm for the winter like a soft robe, or if she likes to cook maybe some cookware, good reading is always nice so maybe a Christian book that she would enjoy or perhaps shoes or a watch. Good luck!|`|cTk3SNjgaa	Depends. A necklace or some kind or jewelry always works. But then maybe  your should see what store she like to buy from and get a gift cards.

It has always been that way and it always will stay that way.  However, there are plenty of friendly gentlemen out there who don't follow the stereotype.  A gentlemen will look for a good girl, smart and funny.  They look for the girls who are innocent, pure, adventurous and so on.  But don't be fooled and beleive that virtues and personality are all that matter.  No guy will date a girl who is the epitome of "ugly."

You need to report this immediately so this sexual predator can get fired and jailed.|`|Y3jNg93vaa	lamo, well lets see u can get her fired, sued, thrown in jail, and put in the system as a child predator. so ye its kinda bad. but thats my opinion.|`|k0Yrh1G8aa	lol just go jack off instead of making up stupid stories|`|ElWhcLjwaa	Sorry, but the rule is a teacher won't have sex with you until you learn how to spell and punctuate.  Since you can do neither, I do not believe you two "kinda had sex."|`|tnrJyHZTaa	yea right and how old r u its rape in a way|`|fT6VVji9aa	Surely you jest.

Sex between an adult and an under aged person is not OK, especially when one of those people has authority over the other. Whether it seems great to you or not, have you never heard stories of older women getting their young students to do their dirty work for them, and then the younger guy goes to jail because of it? Ask yourself, and no offense, but what do you as a younger guy have to offer a professional woman that she could not find in a contemporary, or even a younger man, but one who is legal and independent? Any woman who wants a man who is not independent yet has a problem and is looking to control the younger guy. This may seem great at first as you might feel you reap all of the benefits of sex without any of the responsibilities of a real adult relationship. But some day you're going to find out that there was something really wrong with this woman. I just hope it's not too late.|`|lo1rEALbaa	love your lies man, but really nice story|`|UAchHJxsaa	niiiiiiice. lol|`|F5ZhFLBsaa	Yes, she could lose her job.  If you are a minor, under the age of consent which varies by state it is called statutory rape and is a felony.  <br>  <br>  However, I don't see her job loss as a huge detriment to the educational system if she is willing to break laws and ethical principles instead of assuring her pupils can spell properly and use proper grammar.|`|ePIDCAhcaa	Wow, thats extremely wrong, and it is totally not true...|`|cixY2L3caa	it's hot but it's wrong<br>  <br>  'kinda had sex' - i smell a rat - LIAR<br>  <br>  |`|kwf1FiD1aa	depends on your age ......<br>  <br>  if your under 18 shes going to get into alot of trouble....|`|ahtFZ1h2aa	well...she obviously didn't teach you how to spell|`|o7NvLDreaa	rong isn't a word sorry.|`|h5XmX0viaa	u have been molested.if u are under 18 years old that is a crime.u may not feel wronged now but later in life it may come back to haunt u.do something now to clear this up|`|lZNyLGY6aa	lol...kinda had sex?<br>  i would say it is wrong especially if you are underage|`|LN2oLOg8aa	i know its fun to fulfill our fantasies, but, is this real? if it is. then that's absolutely cool! i'd like that to happen to me as well!|`|d62KaqFHaa	wow. youre lieing retard|`|4DLr4zddaa	DUDE! nice going...fomr a girls perspective..lol. but she could go to jail if the cops found out....and if shes married or something...this could turn into a soap opera or scary movie and then you get killed!....sorry. lol...just be careful :/|`|ed1bb7e4e7470b245a4e2a14aabb3547aa	sounds nice and kinky i dont have a problem with it :]|`|5YkzXyg1aa	Good one!  i actually believed you for a second, and then I was like nahhhhhhhh.  xD|`|vDNrX7q4aa	OMG|`|TcufX5lSaa	well im betting shes an english teacher because of learning how to spell you were checking her out. and its WRONG. second thats illiagal. third thats discusing. |`|EEKp6qwlaa	i seriously think thatz wrong!!!! thats basicly like ******* your mom...!!! |`|KuLkxkgBaa	I totally support you! <br>  <br>  Nice!<br>  <br>  It's not wrong at all :) teacher or not, you would have done it.

Ever heard of them? This is basically what two year old do. Don't yell at her, she chews because she is still teething. She yells back because the older sibling she looks up to is being mean to her and she is hurt and doesn't understand. But guess what? She is going to bug the living *** out of you for a few years. But it will get better. Don't hate her. Later in life, when your parents are gone, she will be the one there for you.

69f4a5ba6dd00d43e18c49f4b14d4a28aa	Hey sweetheart. Hey listen, I realize you're hurt. I do, I've been there, and well it hurts and it cosumes most of your thoughts I'm sure. But you are young, and if this guy is going to flake out on you, then even if you guys got back together, what would it be next time? You know what I'm sayin? So pick yourself up and go on down the road. Just don't hold this pain against the next guy, ok? I understand this is not what you want to hear, but it's reality. If he really loved you, then he wouldn't let something like school, away from home or not, get in the way of that. Love is all we really have. Jobs, money, things, none of that **** matters baby. So just take time to get over the pain, and find you a man who will love you the way you deserve. Hugs, keep your face in the sun. It'll be ok. Believe it. Take care.|`|d94b5be55d9ee5bb2401ce3ea78773dcaa	Tell him that you love him, and if he dosent love you anymore.

AA11427670	I can answer this...  <br>  <br>  Cos he is married you are getting all the good bits of the relationship so not seeing the bad bits.  He is buying you stuff and taking you places and being generally lovely all the time because you are his 'lover'..  If you lived together things might be different.  You'll never get ovr him unless you have a major arguement, but it will eat you up inside eventually..  you said you didnt want him to split from his wife but the pain will engulf you because you need him with you..  You either have to split now before it gets too bad (you've only been together 6 months - infatuation can last up to 3 yrs) or ask him where you stand with him..  ask him if you are just a shag or do you mean more to him... x|`|4JrDGW7Taa	Yes, that's the trouble with affairs. The relationship is so perfect. And, the reason it is so perfect is that it is an affair. Affairs are mostly only on one level: sex. Affairs are not concerned with everyday living. And affairs can be broken off without much ado. <br>  <br>  Marriage is a whole different story. You see each other all the time, sometimes being very unattractive, worrying about money matters, doing everyday tasks.<br>  <br>  Take this for what it is. A momentary pleasure. Do not expect more.|`|xx2TtoZsaa	Your  not a dimwit. You are in love and you can't help who you fall in love with. He should leave his wife thou.

Wow, such a surprise.  And why bother lying in your question?  It's bull that you didn't mean this to happen.  Did you accidentally fall into bed while naked, and he just happened to also be naked in that bed?  It's wonderful how you totally ignore the harm you and Daddy love have done to his wife and their marriage.  All you are doing is hoping for somebody to say-  "Aw, it's OK, it's not your fault.  You are a wonderful person who just happens to screw married guys."|`|5DJcir9saa	Who cares that you don't feel used and disrespected, both you and him are totally disprespcting his wife and the vows he took when he decided to marry her.  It is true that you can't help who you fall in love with BUT you can decide whether or not you want to allow a man to lie and cheat on his wife, just so you can feel accepted.  You are only 36, you haven't lived a really long life and there are tons of men (SINGLE, I might add) that would be able to help you with that low self esteem that is obviously stemming from this dysfunctional relationship.  You should seek counseling to see how you can get past this and break it off with this man for good.|`|93d1272e676f48f0eee8d8378c0b91f2aa	it takes two to tango and you both knew what you were getting into. loving someone else's husband will never end well. they belong to someone else and cannot make all your dreams come true as they have to stay with their families.  you cannot help who you fall in love with, but you need to understand that you deserve more that someone else's husband and stolen moments. you need someone who can be there for you all the time and someone that will love you for who you are and all the time, you cannot find this unless you open you heart and you cannot do that unless you are away from this man. I think you know it is wrong and want to right it, but the only way is to let him go to where he belongs, with his family. good luck, i hope you find someone who will love you for being you.|`|cxYmH5FJaa	been there, done it and worn the t-shirt.  it will all end in tears, and they will be yours,  he will never leave his wife and no matter how many times he says he loves you, its still his wife that he is waking up to in the morning.

Nothing!<br>  So, if you do love him, then you have to let go, or ask him to make a choice, and if he does love you, then he'll understand and will accept that, or will accept to let you go.<br>  Anything else, then it's not love, but just lust and selfishness, because then what about his wife and children? <br>  Why lead a double life if he already knows that he doesn't want the one he has with his family?

Now ask yourself this does he have children? if so you are hurting them more than anything.

15429576f39fecdb6423a3bfaca3e7c8aa	It hurts to lose someone that you care about, but you said yourself that you were fighting so I'll bet you haven't been happy in a while. I know you can't forget about him, but try to not think about him and lean on your friends for support.<br>  <br>  The first step is the hardest. You need to get out of bed. Take a shower and make plans to do something with your friends. You'll feel a lot better once you do. <br>  <br>  I'm not saying to go out and look for other guys, because if he does truly love you he'll be back. I'm just saying that you can't waste your life pining over him. Make yourself happy first and worry about getting back together second.<br>  <br>  Also don't believe all the idiots that are saying he's met someone else. Thats a load of B.S. He just needs time to get himself together.|`|7d84621e89c49bcba037226d3361c90baa	I'm not saying that he definitely won't want to be with you again, but I WILL tell you this...don't wait for him.  I know it's painful, believe me...I've been there...but you need to pick yourself up and move on.  Start spending time with your friends, start getting out there and meeting new people.  Start dating other men...chances are there is someone out there you will love even more than you loved him.  If things are meant to be with him, then it will happen on it's own.  Stopping your life to wait for it won't make it happen, though, and it will be a huge waste of your valuable time and emotion if it isn't meant to happen.<br>  Now get out of bed, take a nice hot shower, do your hair and makeup all pretty, and go buy yourself a nice outfit or really awesome pair of shoes.  Then call up a few girlfriends and plan a night out as soon as possible.  Go out and have fun.<br>  <br>  Addition:  Oh...and I second what the answerer below me pointed out.  *NO* post-breakup sex!!!  There's nothing that hinders moving on with your life more than falling into bed with the guy you are trying to move on from.  I've learned from experience...him wanting to sleep with you does NOT mean that he wants to get back with you, and that is a huge mistake that almost every woman makes...equating a man's sexual desire with emotional desire.|`|fFe75M3Baa	One thing your ex is right about is making yourself happy first. From what you've said, it seems like he's moved on. He told you at first, he needed  space, then a week later told you its over. Move on. There are plenty of people out there, so go enjoy yourself. Don't wait around for something that may never come. Relationships are different for everyone, and you and your ex don't seem to share the same ideas for what a relationship should be. If I were you, I would move on. Maybe he'll come back to you, but how long are you going to wait around to find out? And trust me, he's not laying in bed crying his eyes out over you.|`|kTvn2Nltaa	I know its hard, but if you can, don't think about it too much. Worrying about it will do nothing. Maybe one day he will give you a call and tell you everything is better, or maybe he wont. If he doesn't, then only time will heal your pain. But don't go out and start seeing other guys yet, its way too soon.<br>  <br>  Good luck|`|smIFzjv7aa	If its meant 2 be then you will get him back!<br>  but ive been told that winners make it happen so try and get him back yourself if you care about him and he probably still has feelings for you.<br>  If not just move on with life and you will most definitely get over it!<br>  So good luck hunny! Hope this helps!|`|prMKOPKJaa	Give him his space for now. Do not let him use you as a booty call. When you do talk to him dont argue. People tend to make mountains out of mole hills. life is to short. Pick your battles and stick to what is really important to your relationship. If he doesnt come around then it is better off you move on now. You dont want to get stuck in an unhappy relationship. trust is a big thing in a relationship. give him some space and dont keep calling him. if he is true he will be back<br>  good luck|`|izbQoi33aa	I couldnt agree more - He has met someone else, dont set your life in the past. Enjoy being single for a while. He will only want you back when things dont go well for him. Get over him and move on.|`|5acf40d2aa61e65eff15834add1f7bd5aa	He's already got someone else lined up.....move on with your life|`|aFaSMYPFaa	If its meant to be.. it'll happen one way or another :)|`|AA12014379	It must be really upsetting for you right now, and im sorry to hear<br>  He still lvoes you its just his way of dealing with it, he might just need some air to clear his head and sort himself out, your job is to stay cool and be strong, if he sees your falling apart without him, its not gonna convince him, you need to sort yourself, get your job going, maybe hand out with some mates for a while, treat yourself some :) Keep in contact with him, just small conversations maybe ask him how he is ( how work is) dont constantly say you miss him, work upto it in conversation when you get one<br>  I'm not saying make him jealous you just want him to know you can do it without him, but you still love him, i hope all works out for you :)|`|b54DTBNbaa	GOING THROUGH SOMETHING SIMILAR EXCEPT A RELATIONSHIP OF TWO YEARS...I HONESTLY THINK THINGS HAPPEN FOR A REASON. I AM STILL IN LIVE WITH MY EX AND WE STILL SPEAK DAILY....HOWEVER I THINK THIS TIME APART WILL ALLOW ME TO MENTALLY STAND ALONE AND FACE LIFE STRONG. I AM NOT SURE THE DETAILS OF YOUR RELATIONSHIP I DO HOWEVER THINK THAT THERE IS AN ACCEPTABLE PHASE OF CRYING AND SOBBING THAT IS ALLOWED DURING THE INITIAL BREAK UP BUT AFTER A MONTH ITS TIME TO PICK YOURSELF UP AND LIVE LIFE ACCORDING TO YOU AND YOUR STANDARDS. IT WILL DEFINITELY BE A TASK TO LIVE LIFE WITHOUT UR SIGNIFICANT OTHER BEING THAT YOU'VE SPENT SO MUCH OF UR TIME TOGETHER BUT IN TIME YOU WILL KNOW IF HE STILL LOVES YOU OR WANTS YOU ACCORDING TO HOW YOU LIVE YOUR LIFE INDEPENDENTLY. DON'T SWEAT HIM, DON'T CALL HIM EVERYDAY...DON'T TELL HIM HOW MUCH YOU MISS HIM, THIS WILL ONLY SEND A NOTION OF HIM BEING SUCH AN IMPORTANT FACTOR TO YOUR SUCCESS IN LIFE, YOU HAVE TO SHOW HIM THAT THIS BREAK UP DOESN'T BREAK YOU OR YOUR SPIRIT....SO BE STRONG MY FRIEND AND IF HE DOESN'T WANT YOU IN THE LONG RUN, THEN THAT'S LOST, PERFECT YOURSELF AND MAKE ROOM A NEW LOVE.
3aRD0Gcdaa	just think of it as another day. I know it'll be hard because you might see girls everywhere carrying balloons and bears and looking oh-so-happy. Humm... buy yourself some chocolates, watch a chick flick, and just think happy thoughts. Be happy the two of you are still together and that he's thinking of you on valentine's day. That's all a girl really needs... love. :)  Maybe talking to him on the phone before you go to sleep will help ease missing him on vday... but it's really no more special than other days. We should celebrate love every day! Maybe when he comes back the two of you can have your own valentine's day celebration. :P|`|8FbOtXAXaa	No you don't sound selfish at all. Is he in the guard or something? Just curious. My suggestion would be to think of the Valentine's Day's that you two have spent together in the past and cherish that. Or if you are the type to write down your feelings just pick up your journal and write exactly how you feel. Sometimes its better to get it out.Good Luck!|`|1Lfd6oi3aa	Valentine's day isn't as important as the 364 days around it.  One day doesn't make or break anything.  People should be shown appreciation and love year round.  I would grab a rental movie and snuggle up on the couch with your favorite food and drink!!  Maybe give yourself a manicure, pedicure and facial or just do what you want!!|`|un2g7nhuaa	Go see a movie or something. Always an escape from real life. but don't go see some...romantic comedy or some such. Depending on where you live, Coraline would probably be a safe movie. Or Taken XD get some laughs out of the crazy ways to die. If all else fails, why not set up a call date?|`|qihcqR9laa	I would just celebrate valentines day late with him when he gets back. Just because you dont celebrate it on the actual valentines day, doesnt mean you can celebrate your relationship later. and, no, you dont sound selfish :)|`|B0nTbAkwaa	lol it's not that bad at least you have a boyfriend! and you never know he may do something special but if he doesn't it doesn't mean he doesn't love you he may have been too busy or something came up!|`|55pSqrDcaa	you dont sound elfish..but i hate to break it to ya...this year youll be spending valentines day like half of america...with no bf...its not that bad though...just go out and by chocolate for yourself :) :)|`|3X7hF6ssaa	It's okay- at least you have someone.|`|GIFz9wzjaa	you do not sound selfish.<br>  He should have a good reason for not being with you!!<br>  Just go hang out with your friends...go and have fun:)<br>  good luck!!!|`|yCo4wKKGaa	buy a dildo, and sit down and watch a movie and eat some popcorn with it. its basically the same thing as your boyfriend|`|G4FD97gjaa	Oooh, You'll be fine.<br>  Just say "**** It"<br>  You love him and thats all that matters.|`|SeKR3zncaa	Round up the bff, watch cheesy movies, eat cupcakes with pink frosting, and nibble on cinnamon hearts.

Just have fun with your buds until you can see him again.|`|u5y8kE81aa	i feel the same way.|`|sgRDJUXqaa	Just remember, Valentine's Day is a scam.  Why can't people do loving things for each other the other 364 days a year; why does the media force people to feel like their partner isn't enough 1 day out of the year if they don't go spend a million dollars on you?<br>  <br>  Be thankful that you have someone who cares about you every day of the year and doesn't feel they have to put it on thick on this one day.|`|wE2etBzbaa	You can hang out with friends who don't have partners on valentine day.  or chat with him if he can|`|UtYllvFcaa	masturbate <br>  go to a strip club<br>  have sex with a random guy you met at a bar<br>  buy a bunch of dildos and other sex toys|`|BHOM7Hlpaa	could add someone into msn <----- check my profile :D<br>  <br>  my gf aint here neither.

SKJsfRImaa	I was married to a man in the navy. His friends were all dogs and so was he. I won't assume yours is also but look at how his friends are in the navy. That should give you insight on what he is really doing when you aren't together because there is a lot of time spent apart. My ex and his friends ordered a call girl when I was sleeping and I woke up to use the bathroom and he was in there and she was hiding in the shower in a thong. Now it is funny to me because it is so ridiculous but it was devastating then. I never thought he would cheat on me with a hooker... when I was across the hall. His friends thought it was funny. I found out he only really married me because he was crazy and wanted me to himself but also wanted the higher pay. Eww.|`|U1h6Dntjaa	I am.  I think you'll get a lot of different answers to this question.  My husband is an officer on a submarine.  His boat is being built, and he has an important job on the boat.  This means I don't get to see him except for a few hours every day.  However, he was on a different boat a few years ago and had two six month deployments.  On a submarine, that means six months without hearing his voice (except for a few phone calls here and there), and just a few emails.  Because he's an officer, he gets a good salary and plenty of perks.  However, someone whose husband is an officer on a surface boat may have a completely different experience.  That man can likely call home more often than my husband.  His location will not be a secret.  Then you have the enlisted people.  They have a different experience than officers.  Then you have couples with children, couples without children.<br>  <br>  There's no clear answer to your question.  I don't love military life. We have to up and move every 2 to 3 years.  In 2006 we moved three times.  On the other hand, I made some very good friends- although there's little chance I'll ever see them again.  We do speak on the phone, though.  My family is always far from me and my son. It is a topsy-turvy life, but if you love your spouse, you'll stick with it.  What are the other options?|`|EMKuBql8aa	I was in the Navy and was married at the time. <br>  <br>  It's hard. Really hard. I was gone for about 9 months off and on for sea trials and THEN deployment. Sea trials are when the boat is in port for I dunno, 3 days, then out for 3 weeks, in for a week, then out for 2 weeks. You get the point. And then you go on deployment which is a year straight. Everybody was only allowed 30 min's a day for the computer (remember, laptops don't work in the middle of the ocean so you have to use the ships computers) that was barely enough time to read everyone's e-mails and respond. When you are in port, you are stuck using calling cards on payphones which can be staticy, hard to hear and so much more. Oh, and when you are docked at home, you work close to 80 hours a week. So you are rarely home anyways. <br>  <br>  But on the good, it is a steady paycheck, full medical coverage and steady employment in this economy.|`|0213a878584dfe668851e9dfd2d6a2e0aa	Well, been married to a navy guy for 5 years.Found out a month ago he has been cheating on me for 2 years. I was one of those who said, "he would NEVER do it", but he did and I think the majority of people in the navy does.<br>  <br>  Anyway, before you make this decision, talk to each other and make sure what each need and want from a marriage. It takes a lot of sacrifices to be married to the navy... you will miss bdays, anniversaries and more, but if you really love each other it will be worth it.|`|SqZ2WS2Maa	I just found out that one of my female friends who is married to a navy guy...well hes been cheating on her for the last year and a half. UGH STUPID MEN
NGz7R9enaa	Talk to her. Find out what is making her so unhappy. Explain to her what you have said here and let her know that you love her and only want for the two of you to be happy.|`|de947568c9e8173e12d8a9930bab48abaa	There is a fine line between being loving and caring and being a doormat for unwarranted abuse. You need to do one of two things: Get her into therapy or get a divorce or you will become physically ill from all this, she is toxic and negative and totally self absorbed. ALL of us go through "extremely difficult things" but we deal with them, we do not abuse those who love us in the process. So if she refuses to get help or change, you must, for your own life safety and health, get away from her, divorce her and find someone who isn't so neurotic and self centered and selfish.|`|W1rCsvTzaa	Some people are just very, very negative.  And I don't think that can change unless (1) They recognize the problem and (2) They are really determinded and committed to addressing it.    <br>  <br>  We ALL have issues/problems.  Some people, more women than men, are drama queens.  Everything is a big emotional production.  Some of the people are "sympathy junkies".  They actually thrive on other peoples sympathy.  <br>  <br>  YOU need to create some separation.  Get some of your OWN friends. Do a weekly guys night out.  Tell her you want to help her, and you NEED her to tell you what HER strategy is for solving some of these many problems that are making HER unhappy.  She needs to find how to make herself happy.  If you continue to carry the whole burden you will eventually burn out and despair.|`|8tJPK69iaa	Some people are never truly happy and you can't make them happy no matter what. When you stay with those people you tend to adapt to their way of thinking. I have watched it happen. My mother is very much like your wife, my step-father ( we refer to him as the Saint) stayed married to her because he really truly loves her. Now he acts the same as her.|`|CuGAYMlbaa	you have become the woman in your relationship|`|4fC6EJWfaa	Is she depressed? I think she may need some counselling and some meds...|`|Ectn7tkSaa	It has nothing to do with you or her life.  You are right, she would be unhappy with whatever life she had.  I think it could be more of a mental thing.  Not that she is crazy or anything but just a chemical imbalance in her brain causing her to react this way.  Take her to see a doctor.  She needs to be diagnosed and then put on medication which should help.  If she is happier you will be happier.|`|029366e443f706114f76140b91711233aa	She needs to get some help with dealing with her emotions and how in turn she treats you.<br>  Being a spouse does not mean that you have to be a doormat. Compassion and empathy are necessary...but when it gets to the point where those feelings are falling away and being replaced with resentment and sadness, then you need to encourage her to get help together to save your marriage.<br>  Best wishes!!!|`|ghz5D5iLaa	I am sorry to say that the time has come to worry about yourself. You cannot make  her happy. It does not seem  that she wants to be happy.You are only making yourself more miserable.

You can contribute to her unhappiness, and try to do the things you know she likes and enjoys, but you aren't responsible for it.  <br>  <br>  We all make decisions, consciously or unconsciously, on what attitude we are going to go through life with.  Some people chose to be happy no matter how crappy their lives may be...some people chose to be miserable no matter what good things happen to them.  <br>  <br>  The reality is, you're likely her whipping post for the bad relationship with her father.  She had a bad relationship with him, and wasn't happy, and...as a man...you're the next best substitute to drop all that baggage on...and any new stuff.  Since her mother died, she's likely grieving, and feels all alone...no matter what you may try to do and say.<br>  <br>  She needs counseling to get over it.  It's not going to happen unless the "self awareness fairy" suddenly clobbers her with a HUGE reality wand.  Most people need outside, independent help...and they have to recognize that they need help.  There are people who love to wallow in their own misery, and drag others into it as much as possible.<br>  <br>  You need help because I'm guessing you're a "fixer" and you "enable" her behavior.  You want to make it better.  You take responsibility for her moods.  You feel badly that YOU can't make it all okay, and maybe if you "love her more" or say some magic word, she'll be happy.<br>  <br>  Seriously..you need help..both of you.  It's the only hope you have that she'll learn how to be happy, and you'll learn to stop taking responsibility for the moods of another adult.|`|gmaCvh00aa	I think you're right about this:<br>  <br>   - I am really worried that she is just incapable of being happy and that she just attaches her unhappiness to whatever is convenient.<br>  <br>  The only thing you can change is you, or what you do or how you are going to handle this.  Not doing anything is the worst thing you can do, because, you say<br>  <br>  - I am miserable.<br>  <br>  Just as she is attaching herself to the nearest problem to avoid something she doesn't want to face in herself you are attaching yourself to HER and making her unattainable happiness your goal because of something YOU don't want to face.  This will go nowhere.  The rocks in her head match the holes in yours.  You said you are "Acting" sympathetic, so you told on yourself.  You aren't sympathetic.  You are pissed off.<br>  <br>  Therapy is good.  Alone or together, you should go.  It helps you peel away the layers and figure out what's what.|`|lFL5W6jYaa	Sorry to say but it may be you, she may be unattracted to you anymore. Any women can be a b*tch but I know when I am one just a couple of words from my husband and a look and I can't be that angry anymore even when I wasn't angry with him. If you can't make her happy than that's her problem if you have kids start focusing your time on them she will eventually see and you will see if she really loves you when your attentions are off of her.<br>  <br>  GOOD LUCK|`|yTAXDL5Jaa	ask her how her parents showed her that they loved her, see if it gifts or doing things for her or if its giving her positive words, or if its just being close to you or if its spendign time with her. As my husband says "you are not happy unless you are complaining." she may be in a cycle of negativity and cannot get out of it. She was never taught how to be positive and she speaks and acts it.|`|SlkLCLoDaa	Maybe you should try and see if she would be willing to go to some counseling. It sounds like she might have some depression issues and the longer it goes on, the worse it is going to get. Just explain to her that you love her and want to see that she is happy, but that you are unhappy with the way things are going. Just try and stay supportive of her.|`|aQB7IJcZaa	You must pursue your own happiness brother, that is the bottom line.  When one partner no longer wants to take care of the other and is miserable you must move on with your life.  You guys either grow together, or you grow apart.

I don't think you have a problem with that!|`|8a8e5dcc284740df009d2405e628cc0faa	She obviously has a personality issue where she doesn't know who she is, what she want and is never satisfied. There is not much you can do really because she will never listen to you and even if you have someone who she trust tell her anything she will se it as a plot against her then will go off saying "its ok i know its me i am always wrong i never do anything right you are all perfect and i am not" sounds familiar?<br>  Well two things you can do: continue to act the way you do today, take it and love her more everyday. It s a huge sacrifice but if she is your life she is worth it.<br>  Or you can be brutally honest with her and hope for the best which is risky. Somehow you are a little bit catering to her feelings by not saying anything. If you enable her to act this way she will continue to do so. Again ... risky business my friend.<br>  Sorry i can't help you more. Good luck.<br>  PS: have you heard of Dr Laura? You may want to look her up and introduce your wife to her. She is controversial to say the least but she has had great results.|`|BLaEQfdDaa	wow that's tough, for me my wife had medical issues when we got married, I knew our life wouldn't be normal, we couldn't go out to bars, concerts, or do things you would do as a newly married couple. she has really bad migranes, which she not able to work, drive. So I worked didnt mine, payin the bill, mortgage, ect, just because I love her with all my heart, but as time went on things got  tough for us, we didnt talk about things, being honest and open about things just faded away, stress on me turn out made me sudden lash out at her, for no reasons, It so bad, that one day she just told me that she fell out of love with me, she felt lost and need to find herself, she wasnt happy and she couldnt be happy with us anymore. I didnt realize through out the years that I hurt, but now Iam hurting when you love someone so much and now she doesnt want you anymore. IF for you things dont change talk about it, see where or what you two can do different, try to work things out, be honest with each other. let each other know how you both feel I hope you both can work things out, this is something you both must want. good luck!!|`|SlyKumQmaa	Grow a set and be a man! Shes not looking for a shoulder to cry on! That's what her girlfriends are for! She's looking for YOU to make the decisions, tell her why you live where you do and that you cant just up and move because this is real life. If she doenst like it, show her the door, and if she does leave Im sure she will come crawling back once she realizes what a ***** she has been being.|`|Vhfb7UACaa	If you have no kids then getting out of the marriage is an option.<br>  <br>  You can't make her happy.  She will never love you more than she loves herself. <br>  <br>  How is her relationship with her father?  This is a good indicator of what her relationship with you will be like.<br>  <br>  It sounds difficult but you may want to try to see if you can talk to her honestly about what she's going through.  You can still be loving and tell her that her behavior is upsetting you.|`|Xqfl10xQaa	You sound like a wonderful guy.It sounds like your wife needs more help then you can give her.you should not spend all your time trying to make a miserable person happy.If she doesn't see all your doing to keep her happy or at least acknowledge it.Forget her!! I don't mean to be harsh it just sounds like a waste of time.my sister is the same type of person no matter what she does or who she meets she is unhappy.I say if it you really feel you have done all you can then you need to let her go.You are hurting more than you're self.sounds like in this case love doesn't con core all.GOOD LUCK|`|nZUvBisfaa	Ok, I went through a similar situation where I was the unhappy one and my husband was the support. I was always angry because I was lonely. I went through a whole hell of a lot (Miscarriage, moved to be with my husband 62 mi from fam in friends to name a few) and I was feeling incomplete with out my family and friends. After a week of my consecutive bitching, my husband came home, threw a bus ticket on the table and in the weariest voice I've ever heard said, "If you aren't happy, just go, leave, and I will be here when you get back". I was so fed up with being away from my family that I did indeed leave. I went home to my family and friends and I cried the entire time. I realized that I loved my husband and that even though I missed my family I couldn't be without him. I came home 2 days later and he was just sitting on the couch. He hugged me and I had never felt so relieved in my life. What I realized what that no matter what I went through, my husband was there too, suffering yet supporting. I never wanted to hurt him again. Its been 1 year and I can honestly say our relationship is tons better. I asked my hubby not too long ago how he knew I was going to come back and he said, "Because you love me". He was right. <br>  <br>  My advice: Buy her a ticket.|`|tA1ztvXaaa	it's ironic how people can advise you and insinuate you've become the woman in your relationship when they for one don't know you and two may not themselves have a shred of sensitivity to the women in their life.  At the end of the day you have to make the decision on this however,  I say to you it  is very difficult to be in love someone like that, she needs help and you keeping it all to yourself isn't helping you.  Get the help for both of you now otherwise long term you will become resentful for loving someone who is incapable of loving themself.  Trust me I FOUND that out the hard way eight years later, no matter what you do or stick by a person, no point in trying to bring them  up and support them in the end if they are not happy nothing you say or do will make them happy.  Perhaps she's bipolar, or worse...no disrespected intended!|`|tcvQwTa5aa	oh you poor thing.Trying to keep someone happy is a full time job that doesn't work in the end.You cannot make her be happy.She seems to have alot of issues that she alone has to deal with.She seems,by your story,to be unhappy no matter what happens,like if she is very unaccepting of life.Maybe she's just got a ton of negativity in her mind and a bad attitude in general.You cannot fix everything for her.She needs to stop being so negative and get off of the road to hell(mental hell)I'm sorry for you that you have to(or for a better phrase,allowing yourself to)travel this road beside her.Some people just thrive on drama and want to drag everyone down with them unfortunately.My husband just stopped associating with one of his friends of 25yrs. because he got tired of listening to his constant whining and bitching about everything in the world.It just got old.I hope you can convince her to get off of her negative head trip and try to focus on the positives in her life.She will become happier if she does and gain some measure of peace of mind as well.Good luck to you(and her).

I'd like to call it more of a...concern. There could be multiple reasons why though. Maybe the girl has low confidence and isn't comfortable with showing her body or is worried about how she'll perform and how she'll compare to other girls that you've been with (if there's anyone else). Then there are also the girls that would rather wait and make sure that they're going to lose it to the right one so that they don't regret it in the future. Believe it or not a lot of girls regret losing their first time to whomever they lost it to. Then there's also the religion fact. If she's really religious then chances are she's going to wait until marriage. Then of course there's the pain factor. All girls hear about is the pain having sex for the first time and some girls are afraid of pain (for good reason). Hope this helped!|`|ec8d54c04117718b2ad085aad183295daa	in some Asian countries, keep virginity is some kind of self-respect, it's  crucial important in some conservative society.

165e6652a58dd5b4e96ffab092bedbc5aa	I think it can be one of two things. Good or bad. Good in the right circumstances, (like mine) or bad if it is a common occurance. For example. I got pregnant the night my husband and I met. I knew, several hours before, that we were going to be long term, even though we only met that day. 11 years later, we are still together and now have 4 kids. Things are not all roses and candy and we did separate for a year or so recently, but I now believe in love at first sight. My advice is that if you do not have that powerful intuition like I did then it is definately not wise to have sex on the first date and I probably should not have either, but at the same time, when it is fate, you know because the intuition is powerful, like in your face potent and you just KNOW!!!! Listen to your inner self. It's right every time! I would definately suggest NOT making a habit of the sex on the first date thing though.

AA11930332	Don't get into an email discussion. Too much is lost and misunderstood on the internet. Call him and thank him for expressing his honest feelings. But you really can't take all of the blame for the way he feels. Pretty much, you tell him, you aren't going to be able able to make him happy. If he is unhappy with you he will stay unhappy when he isn't with you. The only person who is responsible for his happiness is the boy in the mirror.    If you are still interested in the relationship, ask him to think all of that over and come talk to you about what is really bothering him. If it is games and junk like that, ask him if sending you an email where he denies any wrongdoing, blames it all on you, and demands that you take the next step is the way mature people should interact or if it might be a game.     I give you a lot of credit. You know this smack doesn't sound right and you know that you shouldn't go grovelling to his feet begging for forgiveness for whatever you might have done wrong.

I think it's important that you sit your kids down and explain to them that just because you are getting a divorce doesn't mean they won't see their father. It doesn't mean that you or he will love them any less. It's important though that you are happy in life and you're just not happy in the marriage.|`|1140e4621b02b3cc0e6a121c912567caaa	your husband is f_cked up.

Get a lawyer and prepare yourself for a messy divorce. KEEP in mind YOUR CHILDREN.|`|0b12c4ab207248967ed33c0dc1223534aa	Focus on the result of the divorce: a much happier family.  Explain that it might be a little hard right now, but in the future everyone in the family will be so much happier, and that's why you all have to go through this right now.  Also, get them in to see a family therapist as soon as possible (and it wouldn't hurt for yourself either).  Sometimes we're just a little to close to our circumstances and experiences to be able to talk them over objectively, or to talk about them to your kids, who are experiencing the same negative things, whether they show it or not.  Therapists are experts at letting kids (and you) talk about some of these emotions that they might not even know they have, and ultimately find ways to deal with them.  Also, the truth is that your kids' behavior is probably the last thing to change when they notice problems in their family; they've noticed and have been affected by these problems long ago.    Just never make them choose, and don't subject them to violent or mean fights.  If one starts, get the kids out of the house and deal with the husband when they're not around.  And ask that he do the same, for their sake.  I'm sure that he doesn't want to hurt them either, but everyone's judgement gets clouded in situations like this.    Good luck.|`|AA11865230	you should always be sincere ... kids that age may feel bad and think its because of them.... so the BEST thing to say i guess is  '' i will always love your dad because he gave me you'' - dont go into detail .. but be honest ... dont blame him just tell them ur sorry about it but tell them that they will understand when they get a bit older !!!!!!  and compremise with ur ex husband and tell him NOT to blame anyone for the childlrens sake!!! u have to start dealing with it urself and then the way ull handle it the kids will get the example and deal with it as well .|`|50d9c032539c57d99fbefeca7167d424aa	It will be hard for you and the kids maybe just remember they will not like it but they will survive.

If they still pretend not to understand, Tell them that they must not be selfish and you do not want an angry, unhappy mommy raising her kids.      You should not stay in that relationship, go ahead and  get your divorce, millions of kids in the states have dealt with that, so will your kids.|`|fad819765f50b8bff8acb23ff0e27254aa	You are in a hard situatiuon. My parents have 9 kids. They got divorced about 5 years ago. We ranged from 1 to 22. I was 18 at the time and I was the oldest at home. No matter what you do it will be hard on the klids. But I promise they will get over it and as they get older they will realize you had to do it. Just be honest wiht your kids, they are old enough to understand right and wrong. I wouldn't go into detail about what their dad has done, not yet anyways. Let them get a little older for that one. But let them know he has done some things that aren't supposed to be done and that you need to get away from him. Let them know they can still have both of you, and you both still love them, just that you and your ex don't love each other anymore. Make sure the kids know it wasn't anything they did, because they are at the age where they will blame themselves. Just give them enough info so they know whats going on.|`|75d787b65ecffe6085abd255227ad297aa	I feel for you hun, the only thing I can suggest is to get them into counceling, this allows them to express their feelings with a bias person.  They don't have to worry about having to choose sides with this person or not hurt their feelings.  I had to put my kids in counceling as the father as well filled their lil heads with all kinds of rubbish.  The other thing I suggest is to just do lots of hugging, fun activities.      Do not let them see you yelling, screaming or fighting with your husband this scares them and stresses them out way to much to deal with.  Expect alot of outbursts, pulling away, loss of apeptite, even nightmares.  It will get better they way I dealt with my kids is I said to them "did you like it when mommie and daddy yelled, screamed and fought" they of course said no, I then explained that for that to stop daddy and mommy can't live together but that did not mean neither one of us did not love them.    That is one thing you can do as well don't EVER put your husband down to the kids no matter how pissed you are with him or what you truely feel about him.    good luck hun, you have a tough journey ahead, stay stronge and it will get better.|`|AA11780989	I don't know how old your children are but they need to know as little as possible.  The problem is I think your ex (or soon to be) is telling them stuff to upset them to come back onto you.  You need to tell him to only talk to you about the impending divorce.  They don't need to be upset by all the "adult talk".  They are going to go thru alot and maybe counsellings will help them depending on their ages.  They don't need to know why Mommy wants a divorce.  I would just tell them that Mommy and Daddy are not going to live together anymore but that we both still love them very much and they will still be a part of our lives and nothing there will ever change.
AA10890075	No I don't think it is bad. Curiosity for the same sex is more common than people think. Be careful, it may just be curiosity and not something you want for real.

AA12105041	You can't, no one can but her.  Don't take responsibility for her actions, you or your wife.  It's great that she wants them together but it's not her relationship and they are not her mistakes.  Her mother will have to deal with her choices.  I would spend more time talking with your wife and getting her to see that she has to accept whatever the outcome is.  Her mother will get caught, if she hasn't already then it is no longer anyone's decission wether they will be together but his, and rightfully so.|`|AA12043392	Mind your own biz maybe?

That could be ugly. One thing that might be possible is find a way for him to discover it for himself. if you know she is going to be somewhere specific at a certain time and with the other person, innocently arrange a situation where dad will end up there during that same time, but do it in a way that leaves you clear of anyone knowing you had anything to do with it.|`|AA11689655	Here's some advice.  Mind your own damn business!    Does this affect you personally?  Leave it alone!|`|AA11081090	your spouse should confront the mother and try to do it that way. You can only support your spouse.

You have no control over her.    However, you can inform her husband, but be prepared for the repercussions from your wife and your MIL. Your FIL may not be too happy either. And sometimes the messenger gets the blame.    Better to leave clues that your FIL will find, and have him "discover" it on his own. He may already know and be cool about it, and just doesn't want anyone else to know that he knows because of his pride/manhood/whatever.    What concerns me more is the duplicity your wife is displaying. How can you trust her not to cheat on YOU?|`|AA12287228	well theres nothing you can really do, but tell her husband that shes doing it, but have proof, but that could ruin your marriage, because either one of the parents is going to hate you forever since you would be telling, write a letter and put it in there mailbox, with pictures, and saying whos shes been doing, my friend did that before, and he didnt kick her out, there still married of 31 yrs, so they will work it out or they will split up.|`|00aac4033c64fd6e54627ddab7a183d1aa	Stay out of it and listen to your wife

c8ef20d752e793e293a111c7bd9420efaa	I found myself if the same situation when I got married.  We have two children, and it is hard sometimes to find a compromise.  But you can if you try.    Look at it this way.  You are allowing your kids to see that it's okay to have different opinions about things, and that one doesn't have to judge or dislike the other becuase of that.  You both can present your views on the subject, and then let your child (once old enough) to decide how she/he feels about the matter.      As for when they are too young to make a decision on their own?  Talk about those things before becoming pregnant.  Decide on the biggies--ex. how to discipline, what faith to raise the child, etc.  Make sure that you are on common ground before having the child, and everything will be okay.  And just remember, parenting isn't easy whether you and your spouse are alike or opposites.    I have been married 7 years now, and our kids don't feel confused or torn.  They realize that different opinions are okay, and my oldest is now realizing that he doesn't have to hold the same opinions as his mom or day.  I think that is great!    Good luck!|`|2e92e14cc439f4c0ebb2404c1ef812ffaa	How boring would your life be if you were both exactly alike? Give it some time and work. If after 2 years you can't stand it any longer, then you can start to think about what to do. For now be patient.|`|AA11892568	naaaaaaaaa !!!!!!!!!!|`|f1221ac740b949abe98fbe47c529aca0aa	if you love each other,you talk,and addapt....if not  you get divorcwd....its  a  funny  world,eh?|`|813a80415c474e102e2187afee926d67aa	That's why it's called compromise.  Until you have children I wouldn't worry about these things.|`|AA12107238	It's okay to disagree and have different view points, as long as you discuss them in an adult way and no arguements.  I think your children would be lucky to have both sides of an issue presented to them and would end up being well informed adults with the ability to make good decisions.  If you love each other you can work this out as long as you both agree to work at it.  Good Luck!|`|689a44cc7843ed13c2a67e04aa412e43aa	DON'T have kids until you know the answer and have worked out all the major stuff. Opposites can be a good thing as long as it is harmonious. If the two of you argue about the large issues, you will confuse your child and send mixed signals. If you want children perhaps this is not the man for you.|`|e23782f27ed5afac8606d48285e8ddc6aa	relax let nature take its course|`|35a454da5980b059deb1efe39756917faa	lol - do NOT have kids until you work things out and are sure you can raise your kids in a loving environment.    This is why you do not rush into marraige over "feelings".|`|3787dd0348dcd338cd6fe2b29977a0aeaa	I am dating a Chrisitan and from the first day I met his family, his mom was persuading me to attend church, so i did. am i happy i made that decision, yes. but would have i liked to do that on my own, yes. let your children have their own views because if not you'll always wonder if they would of done that without you there.......as far as you and your husband, republicans and democrats fall in love all the time...........|`|d7109f67b48d98ed859a5db9cb400ac6aa	My husband and I are the same way (moved in together before we even went out on a date, and got married 4 months later). We've been married for 6 years, and he and I are TOTAL opposites. We have discussed having kids, and have diffeent views on raising them, as well. It will only be bad if you allow it to be...having parents with seperate views will allow your children to learn that "there is more than one way to skin a cat" (so to speak). As long as you respect each other's differences and teach your children to do the same, and remember that just because you don't agree with someone does not make them wrong. Two people can have different views on something and still both be right.|`|AA10729552	Because you love each other you need to learn to communicate effectively.  That doesn't mean you have to agree about everything, but both of you need to respect the others' beliefs and opinions.  Each of you has developed your values, and should respect that the other has them.  I'm sure discussions and disagreements around your house are very interesting.  There isn't anything wrong with having a debate now and again.  If the two of you can develop your communication skills so that even though you don't agree you don't get emotional or upset or insulting and accept the others feelings on what ever subject then there won't be any confusion.  As long as when it comes to your children you meet in the middle, as with any family decision, your children should grow up to learn to make their own opinions and values.  I think if each of you is a strong thinker, then your children will be too.  The key is to work together, despite differences.|`|AA11996816	you think your the only one with this problem let me tell you NO... there are thousands of other couples with similar problems but the difference between them and you is that they are not quitters!! if you love someone you will put a side your difference and try to look for similarties... with marriage comes compromise! if you both stand on two sides of the street you will never meet how about he comes half way and you come half way...   Religion are all men made as long as you believe in god thats all that matter...  my husband is catholic and i am hindu so as for the kids stuff do what i have thought to do... i will take them to the temple and also church cuz i have not converted but i do go with my husband as he comes to the temple with me... and well let the kids decided which religion they wanna follow...they have to follow it not me so let them see for themselve and who knows they may decide to follow both..  As for politics.. how many of those politicians put food on your table?? NON RIGHT! so why do you want to bring politices between u and ur husband? if something ever happens to you its your husband standing next to you not ur politicians!!  well everyone has their own values the biggest thing is to respect each others value and learn to adapt... this earth is 4.5 billion years old you know how it survived so many years thru adaptation... as long as there is a will there is always a way... nature has taught us that... learn and apply it in your life!!  divorce is not the solution, if you love him than you will work things out its not impossible you know!!  good luck!  (sorry for the spelling havng problems with the spell check)|`|AA10273788	I have not, but I have seen it work.  The point to take with your children is this, listen to all sides, and come to a decision themselves.  This will actually be a great learning tool for your children.  If you and your husband can respect that you feel differently about different issues, then your children will learn this as well.  A lot of things don't affect a marriage.  If you are conservative and he is liberal, will that really affect how you love each other?  If you're worried about how to raise your children.  Maybe take a day a week and ask each other one or two questions.  Things like, "Do you believe in spanking?  If so, how often?  Would the circumstances have to be extreme?  Would you go past three spankings?  Where would you spank?  Would you use a spoon or other tool?"  Then really listen to what they say, and ask why they say what they do.  Sometimes the greatest obstacle between two people agreeing is not understanding the reasons why.  Other questions that often comes up with parents is if their children will go to church?  What schools will they attend?  Will they be allowed to swear?  What television and music is appropriate for what age group?  What kind of video games will they be allowed to play when they are older?  How many chores should the be responsible for?  And at what age? {Side note, all children should have to do chores, starting from age one.  Teach them to put their toys away.  At age 4 they can start making their beds.  Age 10, dishes, and so on.  The differences between children that have no chores, and those that do are AMAZING}  Keep talking with your spouse.  If you find your voices are raising, it's time to end the discussion.  Take a few deep breaths.  Walk away promising each other you will rethink all that was said and try to see where the other person is coming from.  Come back and talk about it again when you are ready to compromise and really listen.  Do this for a year, a question or two a week, {More could put so much strain on your marriage that you tear it apart, go slow, you have time}  I wish you well as you seek to love each other more, and accept the other as they are, and love them where they are at.  :)|`|30374f14828a9cb39e3766e903dbfc39aa	Well for any marriage to work the couple has to learn to compromise.  your situation is a direct result of jumping into a marriage  (no offense)  You are married and I think you should try hard to meet in the middle with him on issues especially when it comes time to raise kids marriage is supposed to be for a lifetime try to make it work.|`|AA11240894	Before you have kids you should first be sure that you and your husband will remain married despite your differences. Having parents with different views is healthy for a child as long as one parent is not pressuring them to BELIEVE what they believe in. Give your kids the facts then let them decide on what they chose to believe, follow, and pass on to their kids.|`|1a69b8aacd22374321528fd39fbd9a61aa	you need to work through your differences of opinion BEFORE you have kids... find a middle ground.  counselling may help with directing you towards compromises.

165e6652a58dd5b4e96ffab092bedbc5aa	This is a hard one. I have many questions. Starting with the situation as a whole. Are the kids in a bad situation with the mom? Is there a leagal custody/visitation agreement? You said she is in contempt of court, exactly how?? IF there is a set agreement and court documentation to prove it, the dad CAN cal the police and have them escort him to the residence so he can pick up the kids. She HAS to let him take them if the paperwork says so. A police report on the situation would be filed and he would be entitled to a copy, EVERY TIME HE HAS TO DO IT. He can then use this documentation in his case against her when they go to court.  he would have to take her to court EVERY time there were an incident so that eventually the court will tire of her antics enough to do something harsh about it. If he feels he is entitled to custody due to what ever reason, he MUST be able to PROVE IT! He must have VALID, REAL proof that she can NOT argue against in court. There are a-lot of things he can do if the kids are in a bad situation with the mom. Abuse, neglect, etc. Getting state child advocacy people involved, police, etc. is one way but you can further build a case by taking the kids to a court recognized therapist for evaluation and use siad evaluation in court IF it is determined that the situation needs to change for the sake of the kids' best interests. What ever you do, do not let it go. Keep the situation in the courts' faces until they do something about it. I think it is also possible to file kidnapping charges in cases where arrangements are made for him to get them and they are not at the agreed upon location at agreed to time, but the agreement needs to be in WRITING and SIGNED by him AND the mom. If he has it documented and calls the police from the location at the time of the pick up arrangements then legal charges can be filed against her for contempt AND kidnapping. I will not swear to that as fact, but I think it is so. Best thing to do is call a family lawyer and ask what his rights are and what he can do. Hope this helped. Good luck!|`|AA11073414	There are many groups for men all over the world. If parents could stop using children as this tug a war the kids lives would be more healthy.Father has a lot of rights so he needs to do his homework about his rights ,call Bar Association and see attonery for few dollars and write everthing down dates, times, small talk, because you have no case without names, times, places and what people said. Hire Lawyer, as well mother will make the judge mad because these are his children and he cares about them and courts gte upset when you will not try to work it out and plus  grandparents are so so important    .Also kids as they get older will want to be with there dad sooner or later and she will push them into there arms if she does not leave the past in the past. If I can help in getting a list of mens group let me know. I have helped many people as I think of the kids because they have no voice.And this father must care to see his kids and want to go through all this.

If she truly is in contempt of court, she can be brought before a judge for that. As for organizations for help fathers get custody? I'm not sure where you would look. Maybe you could check on the find law website. If the father is paying child support, but is behind, he needs to be current before entering court. It will look pretty silly if he is in contempt of court as well.|`|25c582500c685d6d5c2e3ce5935e181caa	Is she refusing to allow dad to see the kids?  Why cant dad pick up the kids?  thoroughly document EVERYTHING....write it down tape fone calls printout emails...take pics even.  Unless she is abusive to the kids and you can proove it, custody wont change.  depriving the kids from having a healthy relationship with a good, non abusive dad is emotional abuse.  This still prob isnt enough to remove the kids from her... unless she constantly does it for many, many months...but they will issue her an order and possibly force her to make up the lost time..  He needs to file a family access motion, in it he can request that she be fined, forced into counseling, pay for the kids counseling if needed, among other things.      www.dadsrights.org  www.ancpr.org  www.greatkidsct.org/parenting_results....    there are many websites out there that will help.
4b498f6e980fdc467d4a25698cc860f1aa	--Is Catholic--    The other posters are completely wrong.  The records of the annulment are not kept at the court house as the annulment process is internal to the Catholic Church.    An annulment is recorded in the parish registry of where the marriage took place.  Simply ask your husband where he had his first marriage registered and then contact that parish.    Now sometimes records don't end-up where they are supposed to.  The place that you want to contact is the diocese where your husband's wife lived at the time of the annulment.  The people that you want to talk to are the MARRIAGE TRIBUNAL.    There might not actually be an annulment as your husband would have been involved in that process, at least to the extent of being notified.    Since you are Catholic, let me suggest that you get your husband to start the process of annulling the marriage.    Buy this book (by a good Catholic Lawyer)  Annulments And The Catholic Church: Straight Answers To Tough Questions (Paperback)   by Edward N. Peters     It sounds like you might be dealing with more than you are writing.  God bless.|`|1b793ca8852f421619c5e4e880e120eeaa	call the county court house and see if they can help you out. they should have what you need.but befor you do make sure you have all the info that you need.good luck|`|AA11943596	Call, write, or go to the county court house.. it will be there...ROB|`|165e6652a58dd5b4e96ffab092bedbc5aa	In most states it is simplest to contact the clerk of courts in what every county and town it was supposed to have happened in. They can look up the file and see if there is anything in there about it. If not then they could direct you further. I am not sure I understand your situation though. If he knows he got a divorce in 1976 then why does it matter what the parents did? I do not know much about Catholocism so I am a little confused. Either way, he can go about it the way I said and if the church thing is an issue as far as annullment, then he might check with the church where he thinks the parents would have done this. They should have some kind of record of it. Hope this helped.

Why would you want to get rid of yours. I think you need a doctor.
AA11580352	I feel for you. We're in the same situation. In our case, we would love to lose his ex and his oldest child (as awful as that sounds). Regardless, we still have to deal with them, at least to a point. Our attorney advised us to start keeping a journal with the dates and times she calls, brief description of the conversation as well as anything we might possibly perceive as a threat. We also jot down the dates and times where she "just happens to show up". Once we've done this for at least six months, then we can go to court and show a pattern of stalking and abusive behavior. In our case, it's also giving us a hand with getting custody of the youngest child.     I would highly advise you to contact either the attorney who handled your husband's divorce or consult a new one if they're no longer in practice. You definitely need legal advise and a way to protect the child involved. You can pretty much bet they're being grilled about their activities with you when they go back to mom!    Good luck!|`|165e6652a58dd5b4e96ffab092bedbc5aa	Tough one. But you DO have options. First of all, go to court with a custody/visitation agreement that is SPECIFIC to the problems involved. That she HAS to stay away when the child is with you. Talk to a lawyer and find out what your rights are in requard to the situation. It is possible to have the court set a certain set of rules that protect you from this kind of behavior from her and that will allow for legal punishment for violation of court mandate placed against her. You can also get a restraining order of intricate type to help control the situation. Consult a legal professional. There are things you can do. The child can be kept out of it, at least on your end. You also have some leverage over her when it comes to how she handles the situation in regard to the child. If she is being evil to you through the child or in any way affecting the child personally with her antics...example...filling the child's head with lies or what ever, you can use that against her too. You can take the child to be evaluated by a professional and use that information to prove that her behavior is harmful to the child. The court will do something about it! Good luck! Hope this helps!|`|c303ca2baf305b257d7e2ec6ce5a3b99aa	Be the bigger woman and realize this is life when there is a child involved.  Yes she creates havoc, but the more calm you are, the better for all of you.  No doubt he left for good reasons and picked you for good reasons......show him he was right by being mature and stable with the situation.  If things reach a dangerous area, that's when it's the father's place to step in and protect the child.  If she's trying to get him back, she'll only drive him to love you more.  If she's truly unstable, he can get custody and save the child.  Remember the child is the most important in this equation.|`|AA11354166	You need to tell your hubby how you feel about this situation, and see if he puts a stop to it...hopefully he will.|`|d03bc670ecb379f166955590eb24164eaa	restraining order or get the man of the home to handle it|`|c6ca18d12d632e2e8e0923ea411b127daa	Go to court, and if there is no custody agreement, get one. If there is an agreement, ask the court for a cease and desist order for her actions. Her actions in many states would constitute stalking. The court can issue a restraining order, but this would mean a disinterested third party would pick up the child, and drop the child off. This restricks your time with the child but it keeps her out of your hair.|`|AA12033834	talk to your man see if any time she is around you can be there with him and if she dont like it oh well he is your man not hers|`|AA11299941	Its not your job to do any of it, this is all on hubby. It's his ex and his kid and his problem. The fact is that if he stood up to her and refused to tolerate it there would no more problems. So many men become spineless weasles when dealing with their ex wives, I never have and never will understand it, personally I think its disgusting! The fact that she calls doesn't mean the phone must be answered and if it is you say he'll tell you about it when he gets home otherwise its none of your business. The woman is getting a payoff from her behavior, if she wasn't she wouldn't do it and its really that simple. Take away the payoff and you take away the behavior.     How is she finding out where you will be in order to be able to 'stalk' you? Someone has to be letting her know, one thing I can guarantee is that she doesn't just 'happen' to be where you are. She has no right to know every single thing you are doing with the kid, and if you are treating her like she does then thats where your mistake is.    You give her the home number, and change the cell number, she is not given the new number. The home phone is yours too and you have every right to answer it, if it is not relevant to the child the phone does NOT get handed to the husband. There aren't that many conversations that need to be held regarding the child, he has regularly scheduled visitation right? So everybody already knows when he'll be picked up and when he'll be dropped off. Yes he can speak to the child anytime, but the moment she gets on the phone you hang up, its really that simple. Mine had an ex like this, she used to call 6 times a day, i wasn't putting up with it so the number was changed, we actually had to change it 3 different times because he gave it to the kid and the kid gave it to her and she would have the kid call then get on the phone. The last time, since she wasn't able to learn the lesson, she contacts his mother and his mother contacts us. Life is much more peaceful now! The son doesn't need to know anything about any of this, its an adult problem and he doesn't need to be aware of it in any way. If she chooses to hurt the child by making a fuss about it well thats just another clue that she is a horrible mother.|`|3a71b3a254a390925874431b0f2a1a38aa	You cant. But your husband can. He needs to be a man and father and put a stop to it.|`|6891161f5fa2eb4b5d1f494f78a010e7aa	The two of  will always be connected as long as they have kids.|`|00aac4033c64fd6e54627ddab7a183d1aa	Dont tell her where you are going|`|AA11549317	Your husband should not talk to her. Try limiting his son's visits.|`|d7e4eef33704b291f2acb6f7c3a72799aa	tell her to look to stop his visitatoin with the child|`|d59161ee3cc380c4afd2d9c06687a1a5aa	You Don't The fact that you are invovled with dude means that you have to experience what he would be going through without you.

You chose to marry a guy with an ex and a kid - what did you expect? She's the mom, and he's the dad - they both need to be involved in each other's lives...it's a package.    Live with it.|`|AA12376946	Truth is they're connected forever. However that doesn't give her the right to constanly harass you guys. your man will have to go to family court to set some rules and some boundaries for his visits. Good luck!|`|c2aea0174044229b1cb027713ad71033aa	Unfortunately she will always be a part of his life because of the child. Now, I know this is difficult but try to put yourself in her shoes. Your child and your former man are with another woman.  That can be a lot to stomach. I don't think she is in the right here but I would probably be a bit** too if my husband was with someone else and we had a child. But on the other hand, you can not be expected to have to deal with this forever either. Now, you knew that he had a child prior to you guys getting together so some of it you will just have to deal with. Have you tried being the adult in the situation and maybe talking with the ex and tell her you are not trying to be a mother to this child. She may not listen but at least you know you tried. Maybe your husband needs to take the matter in front of a judge if it is getting that bad. She should not be allowed to follow you or harass you.|`|1ea0dc060b4d1a76a570ffe631edaca9aa	This women suffers from seperation anxiety and not to mention also a bit of Jealousy that he has moved on in his LIfe.

5ca90421910f50c7be9bd7eb38794edcaa	Please believe that it is fine to be a romantic person. Smile and learn to talk. Don't be too stiff and uptight when you are with your lover. There should be no ego between you. Just feel like two young children sharing a heart to heart relationship. Learn to compliment others for the small things they do to you. Show affection and love, don't keep it bottled inside. Touch others hands or shoulder when you want them to feel your emotions.

Find out his/her likes and dislikes and what their idea of romantic is and use that information to solve the issue.  Get educated on what it means to be romantic, adding the knowledge that it means different things to different people. Flexability to specific situations is key. Hope this helps.

4fc044b09c745ecda9ac330867e5cde1aa	You're not being immature, your being smart.  You told him how you feel and he told you that he does not feel the same.  If it is going to work out between the two of you, he is going to have to make the first move.  Keep the relationship as it is until he wants it to be more.  You don't want to crowd him and you also don't want him to think that you are chasing him.  However, you should leave the communication open to let him know that you are still interested.    Good Luck!!!|`|AA11555370	Mr. Chivalry says, "Find a man that will love you and show it. If you have to wait that long, and get the answer you weren't seeking, then it was a waste of your time.

He is being a bit immature in not contacting you to talk further - if you were truly friends that long, even if he doesn't love you the way you do him, he should be concerned about your feelings and want to talk it out with you.  That's only respectful and caring of a friends feelings.   You are doing right by not getting in touch with him....let him do that himself.  There really is nothing more for you to say to him if he isn't wanting to hear it - and apparently he is going to great lengths not to...so let him be...it may hurt a little ...but time to just move on.|`|04b1bc145be5ea0502384501adfca1bfaa	i think thats being smart not wanting to get hurt|`|ab6542ff2d89e5c6f14acf06a406efefaa	Been there.

I personally think you are doing the right thing, waiting for him to get intouch with you. I think he is the one being immature!

Maybe you should ask him why he is ignoring you.  Because if you were friends I see no reason why he should leave you to wonder.   But if he wants space, let him have it.  It hurts to move on, but it will hurt you more if you wait on a guy to make up his mind.

El se?or TIENE FAMILIA, que se divorcie significa para l que  ya no vive con ellos.

No me gusta la diferencia de edad, cual es la edad de la ex?  POrque este inestable tal vez gusta cambiar de mujer cuando ya us lo suficiente la actual y otra le llam la atencin.

Lo que puedes hacer es indicarle a tu esposo las cosas que te ponen incmoda y observar muy bien como se porta.    Tampoco le quites un padre a los ni?os por tu capricho.

Yo te recomiendo que hagas lo posible por todos los medios de mejorar la comunicacin con tu pareja, para que de esta manera, si existe confianza, amor y respeto, cada uno este consciente del lugar que ocupe y tengas la seguridad de que aunque est al tanto de sus hijos, ellos y su exmujer tengan un lugar diferente al que puedas lograr con l si formas una nueva familia.

Then she'll ask you do you really? And just simply say YES!

165e6652a58dd5b4e96ffab092bedbc5aa	What exactly do you want to know? I have been in a battered women's program but am not familiar with the one you are referring to. Still, I will help if I can. I just need to know what information you are looking for, specifically. What I can tell you for now is that there is really no real need for using a "program" like this one. If someone is being battered and wishes to escape it, they need only call 911 or local police dept. and have someone come and get them. That officer, or those officers will make all arrangements prior to their arrival for the victim to go to a shelter so that once they are safely removed from the situation they can be transported to the secure location immediately. Does this help you?|`|8a684d700865d4cb4a80c112cc56e85daa	Not familiar with this program, being a victim myself I am familiar with others.|`|8b7404936c0982fe345754b49ee7d110aa	I was an abused woman and i have never heard of that one, call your local police department, they can get to some information. also try abusedwomen.com

First and foremost tell him as a guy that has been through this there is not a worst feeling in the world then knowing that someone you called a friend and always clicked with likes you and tells you when it is too late.  Also he may do like a lot of guys do when he goes back and forth to his ex. He feels that no one wants him cause they have not approached him and takes the easiest path he knows he also may be fabricating  his female encounters so he does not look bad or look like he is not getting any attention from the opposite sex...male ego what can I say. You never know how much interest he may have in you cause  who knows you may not put yourself in the best situations to discover what he feels. Use a date at the movies or even a quiet day away from friends and just with him to try to break the ice. If all that ends in not at least you have your friendship.|`|4898d98949c10676ab44b0dd89b0ce36aa	do you want to get over him?|`|ff258bb0b10d58bc9a3912b033dd3673aa	You have to get it off your chest so i think you sould tell him and if he don't respond positively then u can move on.|`|6f15bc5d538813aa79409d8a9a8e5f02aa	Most of the time when guys talk about other women in front of one woman, it means they don't like that one woman. But there is always that slim possibility that this guy doesn't want you to think that he doesn't have other options (other than you). The only way you'll ever know for sure how he feels about you is to ask him how he feels. Are you good friends (not just friends)? Become his good friend, he's more likely to open up to you that way. If you feel that you have no chance with him and just want to move on then you need to stop thinking about him in that love way. Start hanging out with your girl friends more and do things to take your mind off him. Pick up and new hobby, maybe something done in groups. You might could find a new guy at a meeting or something.

I would say maybe try being more of a flirt and show him you like him. Dont scare him and tell him you like him (made that mistake). Act like you like him and maybe he will begin to show an interest in you.     Or go the other way about it, show him less attention than usual. He may also be trying to get you jelous.     NOw as i think about it, maybe you should tell him if thats what you feel is best. Sometimes if you tell the guy they begin to realize and think of you differently. GOOD LUCK!!    =]|`|f1321fed5aec6a8e44e7208252fcad30aa	Talk to him seriously and find out where you stand in his eyes.

Para mi es la escencia lo importante a la hora de amar, es estilo, sus sentimientos, la belleza se encuentra en todos lados, afortunadamente puedes encontrar personas que te dirn que no importa el color para amar, lo que importa es lo que lleva dentro de si, lo maravillos@ que puede llegar a ser esa persona contigo.    En cuanto al sexo y color de la piel es lo mismo, cheka muchas relaciones lesbicas o gays, se tratan como parejas heterosexuales, tienen problemas, se dicen te amo, se ponen melosos con su novi@, se ven con ojos de perro a medio morir por que esa persona les roba el aliento cuando se les acerca, al igual que tu cuando te enamoras sienten mariposas en el estomago cuando le ven.    Se abrazan, se besan, lloran y rien juntos, aunque para muchos el hecho de que con quien se van a la cama es diferente y hasta pecaminoso, sucio y dems estereotipos tontos y mediocres que la gente sin cultura, que no desea ver ms all de su nariz hace. Pero para otros es lindo ver que se amen, que se disfruten y sean ellos mismos, que nada ni nadie exista cuando se aman, cuando se miran a los ojos y se dicen TE AMO.    No hay por que encerrarnos en un mundo as de cuadrado, no hay edad, no se distingue sexo y color de la piel cuando se trata de amar, el amor es universal y maravilloso.|`|57ba3da936ab0fd11e882d9e7be10dcfaa	NO HAY COLOR NI EDAD SEXO EL AMOR LO PUEDE TODO|`|8419eb4f8f62150cbc9bbd15c3540ab2aa	siempre y cuando se amen y respeten lo demas no importa, ni lo que diga la familia.|`|4d8cf2313a8092816d0c9ec016981a01aa	En realidad no existe nada de eso lo que si existe es deseo desmedido y atraccion mutua...|`|69654234a5764153f45fc5a345f48fa2aa	No....  el amor no entiende de razas... creencias... habitos... nada de nada....  solo lo q se siente x dentro... nada mas...|`|ace3e359e9ccb8d648d22e52c7ecf87baa	como tu lo dices para el amor no hay edad,color, ni sexo ..|`|1b87fd762c934824d1ecb98dea2a216eaa	no, lo que debe de haber es sentimiento mutuo de la pareja

Creeme que es dificil resistir a todas las tentaciones y presiones que tenemos alrrededor, pero eso es una decision unica y exclusivamente tuya, si asi lo deseas que asi sea.     Lo que te puedo decir es que el sexo sin amor no es tan placentero como el sexo con amor. Cuando decidas entregarte a la intimidad con una persona creeme que sera el momento mas maravilloso que te puedas imaginar. El sexo en si es rico, placentero y satisfactorio, si a todo esto le aunas un sentimiento tan fuerte como el amor podras tocar el cielo con las manos.     Deja de preocuparte por lo que te digan los demas, se tu mismo, cuida tus valores e integridad, sigue tus impulsos y deseos y cuando llegue el momento, porque llegara, tu sabras bien que valio la pena la espera.     Para terminar, mi consejo es el siguiente: Cuando llegue el momento adecuado prepara todo lo necesario para que esa ocasion tan especial sea recordad por ti y tu pareja toda la vida: Una cena romantica, velas, un buen vino, buena musica.. en fin prepara un ambiente propicio e ideal.    Mucho exito y saludos|`|a923ae91d8299463d6be677f39fb2ca2aa	Neta es raro en la actualidad, pero es perfectamente entendible y respetable, mas sin embargo mientras tu sepas porque tomaste ea decision que no te importe lo que piensen los demas.

You said you know him personally. And yet you are not ready to meet?    Anyway, I was kinda similer situation sometimes back. So let me clear up the boy's probable view.    I don't know if he is working or not. But many a times, firms do have a restriction on taking personal calls during office hours, especially to ones who are in the middle management level. He might be very busy & a person who likes to keep his personal & professional life seperate. You may try to call him up at late evening after his office hours.    Meeting personally in this type of cases are very important. 'Coz it provides most of the impression of the person to both of the parties. So, go ahead and meet him up. But be careful about the venue. It should never be a very crowded place. But it should never be very lonely place either.    Hope you get it right ;)|`|AA11284386	its better to seek for his opinion on this ..maybe he is keener than u to meet u.....so try not to decide unless u r sure.|`|da59659a698cd6bf947220e9de439cc3aa	Dear friend,  Since u accepted his proposal, u shud meet him. u must know him. who knows whats on his mind about u. meeting him once wont be enough. Since u accepted his proposal, that means u like him. So what r u waiting for????....... meet him regularly and be in touch with him almost anytime. if u do it,then, it will b the start of a new relationship. When u begin to approach him,he will slowly begin to seize his busy activities and will come to u always.    Now the ball is in your court. Place your moves properly.    Good luck|`|31c43d4e294f2b3a09e8f370190b22d5aa	useless feloow

A ti te tendra un cierto rencor por mucho tiempo (?piensa que sentirias que tu hermana se hechara con el que sales?).    2. No se lo cuentes a tu hermana, y si ella deja de andar con el por otras causas a ti ni te afecta y para ella mejor.  Igual y termina casada con el. Tendras miedo que el un dia encabronado se lo confiese a tu hermana, y te odie por siempre.    3. Dale indirectas como que que te han contado que el es un cuerpo facil, pero asegurandote no le reclame a l. porque si no terminara diciendole a tu hermana que tambien te lo a hecho a ti.

Creo que deberas de decirle a tu hermana de todo lo que paso, de lo contrario se puede enterar por otro medio y no creo que te puede perdonar tan facilmente, recuerda que la sinceridad y la honestidad son valores que en una familia deben de ser y estar presentes para todo, sobre todo para las situaciones criticas como la tuya, ponte a pensar que esa relacion con tu hermana progrese y se lleguen a casar: ?podras vivir con esto toda tu vida? porque si ahora no te atreves a decirle ya casada creeme que nunca lo haras.

My suggestion is to wait and let it work itself out because she is going to do what she wants in your face or behind your back if she has to, but if your "friend" is like you say, she will realize she made a mistake and possibly get back together, or even you may move on yourself.

3f4a6f0581917b9acdd1a073cf9a90acaa	I think the best solution for this body type (mine too!) is to wear dresses with knee-length hemlines.  Also anything that ties around the waist is a plus since it will draw attention to your assets.  Also remember, if you want to appear to have a larger chest, wear higher collar lines.  Great options instead of boring turtlenecks are the "turtlenecks" that have the neck split so they drape over your collar and down your back.  Also, I always wear heels, even if they are small ones.  This helps to elongate your legs and even out the large thighs. Also, be confident about yourself!  Lots of guys love this shape.  The thin waist/ flat tummy always seems to be a turn-on and I know lots of guys who love thick thighs...especially if they are muscular and accompanied by a large butt.|`|AA11166728	WITH  A BODY LIKE THAT I LOVE..

En el caso de las relaciones es un poco ms dificil ya que depende de dos, y si una parte no le hecha ganas por mas que se esfuerce la otra parte no va a funcionar. Se require de mucha comunicacin y de mucha tolerancia. Y si aun as no funciona lo mejor es decir adios, ya que la vida es corta y hermosa para envidiar siempre y no ser feliz.    Suerte!|`|b9bc320dc94b8aa33d58206302b825f9aa	hay que hecharle ganas a nuestra relacion para que sea igual o mejor de lo que es.,.eso se notara a distancia. muchos detalles sencillos.. y listo,|`|ec2f04c6cf83ce0da69b9a40e4205bd4aa	No envidio ningua relacin, cuando veo a todas esas parejas felices, en restaurantes felices, comiendo comidas felices y so?ando con casamientos felices e hijos felices, me dan risa, una relacin se acaba EN CUALQUIER MOMENTO, y se sufrimiento s que no quiero volver a vivirlo nunca ms.|`|72d93bbbf938b8c4548b1651da9fe687aa	creo q si por q eso me a pasado muchas veces veo a mis amigas con una relacion muy bien llevada y la mia pues casi callendose en cantos. creo q uno si puede envidiar una relacion|`|1e5e770f583f8bf7d60243fb178705b8aa	Claro que si, pero esto se da debido a que tu relacion no esta del todo bien. Si tu andas buscando la perfeccion en otras parejas es porque no la existe en la tuya, si es que tu admiras como se tratan, se besan, se hablan, se miran o se acarician es porque tu no encuentras en tu pareja eso.    Te recomiendo que hagas un analisis concienzudo de tu relacion y de lo que encuentres has un resumen de lo que puedes recuperar y de lo que no, si son mas los no entonces creo que estas en el lugar equivocado, tu relacion ya paso a la historia.    Suerte y saludos.

2daaf4982e525bd0947aaebcf8d3fb38aa	Yes, it is very hard to let go when you love them very much. Unfortunately, letting go is the answer, because when someone cheats on you, they are begging to be dumped, and they're also begging you to go find someone better than them to be with. I hope that is what you'll do.  You'll be much happier with yourself in the long run.|`|8b9d10d1075052b40766489376f2dc3eaa	Not for me.The second they cheat or lie, I'm out .There are plenty of fish in the sea.Don't get me wrong I hurt.But I value myself too much to have someone like that in my life.|`|9b7cabf55655b8b1e7248d016af12266aa	It can be. If you are used to spending a lot of time together or if you've been together for a while, it can be difficult. The reason is, you have a habit of communicating with them. It is hard to write someone off completely cold turkey. It doesn't matter what they've done. You should keep yourself busy so that you don't have time to talk or think about the other person if you are having trouble moving on.

328d490344efe054bfeaef95e75fd74daa	You should wait at least six weeks.. this gives your BODY time to heal.. especially if you delivered VAGINALLY. IF you had an episiotomy then you stand a chance of tearing out your stitches. But then that is my view and I am not a doc.. just a mom of four..    ***The issue of postnatal sex is complicated by, among other factors, the reality that it is a taboo subject.     Asked what they felt was the right moment to resume sex after giving birth, young mothers had diverse answers.     Some said two months is the norm.     Others said four months. For others, it varies among individuals.     What then makes resuming sex such a difficult task for many new mothers?     Among the reasons given are pain during sex, unexplained aversion to sexual contact, and fatigue from paying full attention to a helpless infant.     Also complicating this sensitive topic is that most couples, especially new parents, may have harboured romantic but unrealistic expectations regarding the timing of postnatal sex. With the arrival of the newborn, the mother undergoes an unforeseen, but very real, sexual system crash.     On his part, the man impatiently stays on the lookout for external signs that his woman may have recovered and is ready to resume intimacy.     He practically monitors her energy levels: How active is she around the house?     Is she dancing again to FM radio music? And is she exuberantly calling her friends to arrange for that Sunday afternoon chat?     Whatever information the man gathers is presumed to be evidence that his partner is ready  at least until he approaches her for sex! One aggrieved new father had this to say about his supposedly neglectful wife: "This is a person who is unwilling to talk to me.     This is a person who fails to realise that we will be together long after our child has grown up and departed. Is she committed to our marriage?"     In a way, the man is right, at least judging from his evidence, and the cold response he gets from his partner.     If only the woman could share with him what she is going through! If only this well-meaning guy could realise his presumed evidence is faulty!     Unknown to both parties, many forces are in operation. Physically, the womans body is seriously battered.     Remember she has been carrying a weight, and there is the pulling and stretching and tearing to consider.     Besides, she may be in pain, which can be excruciating during sex, especially at the site of an episiotomy.     Gynaecologists have often discovered complications beneath what was assumed to be a healed wound.     Again, the surgical operation (if any was done) may have been badly carried out, in which case repeat surgery may be necessary.     Even with C-sections, one must not forget the impact of the incisions, and a disturbed bodily environment.     Hormones also do their share of damage.     Given that our bodies are biochemical systems, what we call thinking and feeling are largely chemical processes.     In the jungle of hormones (both those known and those yet to be discovered), two hormones might serve to illustrate. Endocrinologists (hormone experts) and gynaecologists explain that, following birth, the levels of the sex hormone oestrogen drop drastically, temporarily lending a major blow to the womans sexual functioning.     Worse still, the body gets flooded with the hormone, prolactin, which not only initiates and maintains milk production, but also kills the womans sexual desire.     On the psychological end, there is a turbulent disruption in the balance of the womans normal personality.     On top of her hormonal and physical changes (the latter which inevitably affect her body image) she may be anxious about the onerous responsibilities ahead.     Many men have commented that their woman "is not herself" during these trying moments.     How the woman responds is mainly mediated by her basic personality.     Some women sulk.     Some appear self-centred. Others may be confrontational and difficult to deal with.     Do not forget that you the woman are only half the equation. With the disturbances in the female partner come reactionary changes in the man.     Often, men defensively take things personally: "So she is rejecting me!" "So she thinks I am no longer sexually appealing!"     "And who is this man who is now taking her out?" Meanwhile, the woman is too preoccupied to show genuine concern.     Depending on how the man interprets the situation, relations between he and his woman can progressively worsen, sometimes getting to the point of no return.    Research strongly indicates that men and their women may be victims of evolution.     Coded into our genes is natures command that we procreate.     The catch is that this command comes in a disguised form: We desire sex.     We pursue potential mates. We feel good about taking great care of our children.    For new parents, natures decree that we procreate can be problematic: the woman must nurture her young one, often to the exclusion of everyone else  Lord have mercy on her miserable man!     What she fails to realise is that she can give some attention to her man without contravening natures laws.     On his part, the man is wired differently; unaware that he too is a robot of nature, the poor male wants to procreate every other minute.     Rather ignorantly, he continues to crave sex and excess companionship from a woman who must obey nature by focusing on her child.     The bloke fails to realise that now is not the time to make babies but time to nurture those already born.     How then do we resolve the impasse?

8c7a529dd8b211593af76e02ddb84d8caa	Es cierto que cada vez existe mayor cantidad de homosexuales y de hombres con parejas heterosexuales que pasaron por experiencias homosexuales... esto es simplemente porque SON HOMOSEXUALES.  El Dr. Juan Carlos Kustnezsoff, sexlogo, sostiene que el hombre que fantasea con situaciones homosexuales o que tiene alguuuuuna experiencia homosexual aislada, ES GAY.  Un hombre heterosexual 100% (entre los que me incluyo) te puedo asegurar que jams pensara en tener una experiencia con otro hombre, es algo totalmente impensado para alguien que no es gay.    Resumiendo: el tipo tuvo alguna fantasa con otro hombre? tuvo aunque sea una sola experiencia homosexual? est interesado en el asunto por curiosidad? entonces es gay.|`|57210a9193793a1df19d6c923f8a114faa	eso es cierto ya que no se puede confiar en nadie ni en ti mismo.|`|789e423445d215e359865976364852b9aa	Toma en cuenta que muchos hombres se casan para ocultarse a si mismos sus preferencias.

Segun la psicologia todos y cada uno de nosotros tenemos nuestro lado homosexual, (hombres y mujeres por igual), aqui la diferencia estriba en que tan cargado sea esta preferencia. Para la mayoria de los hombres, y sobre todo de nuestra cultura latina, el hablar de homosexualismo masculino es incluso una ofensa, pero no se han puesto a pensar que la homofobia es un sintoma inequivoco de homosexualidad latente.    Yo considero que los hombres que son bisexuales o que tienen preferencias gays son aquellos que en sus relaciones con mujeres han tenido problemas graves, (y que conste que no estoy diciendo que hayan sido provocados por las mujeres), es por ello que buscan en otro lado lo que en una pareja heterosexual no encuentran, lo que te puedo aconsejar, si es que tu duda va por ahi, es que si tienes miedo de que tu pareja llegue a tener estos "malos pensamientos", es que siempre hables con l de todo, y cuando digo todo es TODO, de lo contrario corres el riesgo de que si tu pareja lo ha pensado o lo pueda llegar a pensar, (tampoco digo que tu pareja sea bi o gay ehhh!!!), si tu no sabes lo que a l le inquieta pues evidentemente va a buscar "soluciones" por "otro lado".    Platica siempre con tu pareja todo el tiempo.    Saludos y exito...!!!|`|6fa13a02ae89887f14966b1d1475e112aa	Se rumora algo de eso, personalmente a mi siempre me han gustado las mujeres y conforme pasan los anios me siguen gustando muchisimo!!!|`|264b696ebebed0e63ccb7380db0ecae3aa	pues yo soy soltero y soy heterosexual y la homosexualidad como que no se me antoja    me encantan las mujeres imagina arazar a alguien mas velludo que tu o con la voz mas grueza    eso da miedo    y no soy homofobico  de hecho los respeto pero creo que no es para mi|`|fcde51d158fdae6495786b04e4b717ceaa	lamentablemente eso dicen,los gays dicen q son la mujer perfecta del hombre nose|`|2bcffebf9ee1bf5632e023d192c72f3daa	Te dire que conoci un amigo heterosexual igual que yo , en el lugar donde trabajabamos el jefe era m-aricon  de manera que el amigo heterosexual termino como amante del jefe y no era por dinero pues era medico y ganaba muy bien , a veces pienso que quienes hacen eso son homosexuales reprimidos o que les gusta el sexo anal y no son capaces de convencer a su chica para hacerlo , la verdad no se , por que pienso que cuando estan con un homosexual a la hora de las mamadas los dos se maman mutuamente , que porqueria , no ha nada mejor que la piel terza y suave de una dama , no me imagino estar con un tipo con una piel aspera como la mia .  espero que mi vocabulario no te ofenda , sorry  bye|`|ac3f36aba56ad192c8e315ff16deff19aa	Es cierto que aumenta notablemente el numero de hombres que tienen relaciones homosexuales. Creo que las mujeres no debieran cuidar como propia responsabilidad ese aspecto. El hombre debe ser cuidado por la mujer como la mujer por el hombre. Ms que cuidado, amado. Pero si el tipo es rarito, por ms que lo cuides, mejor perderlo que encontrarlo.

c2dbcb9d4cabe528a87b05b4fc95a676aa	1) she wasn't ALLOWED to date  2) she probably misses you.. she doesnt seem to have moved on.. being friends with an ex is generally difficult cos it'll nvr work out.. trust me.. you haf to be friends before you get together so it'll work out. cos like even if the relationship doesnt work out, you'll have the friendship yyou once had. just cos you took ur relationship to the next level, frm friends to 'couples' it doesnt mean you cant be friends. what i'm trying to say is that it's going to be difficult for the both of you.   3) are you willling to wait fr her til she's allowed to date? and is she willing to do the same in the future? cos if you're not sure bout that, then what's the point in getting back together? ur only gonna hurt yourself and her too...   4) is she worth the wait? do you really love her? cos personally, no offence, i dont believe in love cos i think it has failed me so many times but what is love? does it really exist? more importantly, do you believe in it?  5)if she mocks you, if you get the chance, pull her aside and ask her whats with all the mocking.. you can always say in a joking way (when she starts mocking) "why? are you jealous *laughs*" but dont sound too evil.. see her reaction...     well, i really hope everything works out well fr the both of you :) best of luck!|`|a0ccb072cc57711ed752fe338d94034caa	Ask her ouit|`|AA10399328	whoaa. i think it is best if you don't try to get involved with this girl. she seems unstable, and doesn't know what she wants. be there for her as a friend, but don't pursue a relationship. what if you love her, you are going to have to be long-suffering.|`|9c5e3c4ca5152d65d34c3e7bd19c0c45aa	you don't mention any of the other reasons, so maybe you should let this one go for awhile  and try again when she is allowed to date|`|a1d64b6d9ad22c1d3a82622ab82d1ff2aa	well almostthe same thing wtih me i have a BOYFRIEND BUT NOW MI EX IS JELOUS but the only thig different is that i moveddddddd on which u should try 2 dothe same|`|45348eb8186eebc5e95828c26540c771aa	She likes you, believe me.

After all, it is not said that "If you love something, set it free...If it comes back, then it is yours...If it does not then it never was."  You cannot approach this out of a need or a want.  For the need and want will only push them away further as you may appear desperate.  Don't self destruct here.  Find a hobby, hang out with friends, move on.  If she comes back to you and you were not expecting (or needing it) thats a bonus for you.

3660c8042ad2666d8b72ed2d6c5110c2aa	Oh, Christian, Christian, Christian,  Did you ever think that the routine for you having girls say no could be that you need to be more mature.  Look back at your question and review how it is written.  If you want a girl to think you are hot you have to first be able to express yourself better than you have in your question.  Spelling and grammar count big time!  Girls want to date guys that they can admire and be proud to be with.   Girls like guys that present themselves intelligently.  You are only 14 or 15 years old fortunately.  You have a lot of time to grow up.  What you may want to do is go over to this girls home and just start out by being friends.  You don't have to ask her out right away.  Focus on educating yourself so that you can have an intelligent and interesting conversation with her.  The rest will fall into place.  Good luck  and don't be so hard on yourself.  Have some self esteem and you should do just fine!|`|AA11613198	yeah. she might like u tho, but whatev. nevr ask girls out u only get rejection.|`|509bd8baf09f6f0ab1321b50848e0a04aa	If you spend your life hiding from risk because of fear, you're going to have a very boring life.  Go for it.  If she turns you down, believe me, you shouldn't feel ashamed.  You tried.|`|cc021f47dc9edbcda68cf205dfa41118aa	I bet she likes you since she treated you better than your best friend as people say, you'll never know til you try so take your chances because you dont wana lose her either.

Maybe ask him if he's interested or not, get answers that way you'll be certain.|`|AA10529327	So you two are texting each other but rarely talk (directly) ? He must be a (kind of) shy guy, so maybe that's the reason he never say "yes" or something. Else, try to play "hard to get", stop sending him message for sometime and see what's his respond:)
7e4jxj3Daa	Definitely the skirt! Show me those legs!|`|n1ywr8Pqaa	depends, skirts are generally hotter though. about 99% of the time.|`|ivlOxlG6aa	miniskirt.|`|ckdYl9Znaa	Yes the majority would, but it really depends on the guy and what both the skirt and pants look like....    Hope This Helps...|`|XnekCBj7aa	Mini skirt.|`|LPtUJ5p5aa	Miniskirts are definatley hot but honestly kind of slutty.      Jeans are way more classy, it all depends on what you want to happen that night.|`|C9BctAMQaa	MINISKIRT BABY! ;)|`|SzQKCeRqaa	I like jeans on girls better.|`|VO1zmW4daa	haha men!  do u really need to ask that|`|4qbpaVv6aa	I hope your question isn't serious. Miniskirt = showing a lot of leg and most of your ***.    Of course they're going to find that attractive, but for the wrong reasons.|`|nS83ag9raa	any guy who says pants is a  f ag|`|rceK0oglaa	i would say skinny jeans are better     http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index;...|`|iis0gF0saa	Only the shallow ones. Many girls in high school generally use their bodies to get guys, which is quite wrong. The majority of shallow imbeciles who want nothing but sex would be fantasizing in their head about how you would be nothing but a little sex toy to them, but there would be other guys thinking, "Wow...that's really sad. She's such a nice girl" I'm not condemning you! In your question, you haven't even said that you were considering this, so it's not right to say you're a **** or something like that. But there are guys out there who LOVE looking at a pretty girl, but also love to look past that. In example, wear some leggings under the mini skirt, it will be just as hot, but you won't have to worry about bending over. Or wear some snug (NOT SPANDEX!!! XD There are some girls who look like they can't breath because their pants are so tight! Lol) jeans, and a figure fitting shirt that doesn't show cleavage. A lot of guys will be thinking, "DAANG" but at the same time, that won't be the only thing they see. Good luck!|`|X9xNgS4Zaa	miniskirt---you will look so beautiful|`|bjqyM4yBaa	miniskirt giiirl ;]|`|jnBuYoiYaa	cant go wrong with a mini skirt|`|pfZPljVIaa	It doesn't matter as long as your pleased with how you look. Most guys though would probably like the jeans better though.|`|0WUcM6NBaa	skirt|`|HYF4RFjNaa	Its not all about showing too much skin, its more respectful when a girl dresses appropriate for herself and not what a guy wants|`|KaRbzqiDaa	Depends your body type, really.  Miniskirt if you don't have curves, jeans if you do. In my opinion anyways.|`|h0wDABGbaa	unless you have cankles/hairy/not in good shape legs, then mini skirt :)|`|L4QhCMcSaa	I respect the guys that say pants!  :]    f u c k o f f j dog|`|JVE8t1x3aa	To tell you the truth Skirts are always better but for me i think it depends on the girl. I like to see certain girls in skirts and some in jeans it all depends on their personality
ojNHRsj7aa	yes theyre allowed to go to prom. its not based on their religion. her parents are probably really strict, and theyre being very protective.  maybe cause they know what goes down at prom afterwards..  hotel rooms, drugs, alcohol etc.|`|mDq4Mf9zaa	who knows mayb she was grounded dur!!!|`|JX82ysInaa	Well, some parents are very strict, so I don't know.
ca6pFETbaa	cause she must be hot.... and your not...|`|3678a63c227fb95efdb295c02f4aa475aa	She has an excuse....what is yours for having poor grammar and English skills?    Seriously, GROW THE HECK UP!!|`|Cwuti01Zaa	Your question spells J-E-A-L-O-U-S-Y    From what you've said, she sounds hot. And who cares about her classes? Really? That's none of your business.    You have insecurity and jealousy issues, dear. Get the hell over it. I'm sure if guys were all over you, you wouldn't be b*tching.|`|LDVBKMiSaa	Surely you must be exaggerating?!    Anyway why are YOU girls so stupid?! We are an amazingly simple gender.|`|6e1afe89920dc60b537520b8276850c1aa	well you describe how she plays with her hair and acts all flirty in a secretive way, thats what does it. guys cant help it, shes attractive obviously and thats why they like her, also because she is new they are trying to make a good impression because she doesnt know what they are really like.  after a while they will lose interest and move on.  ofcourse they will keep trying, that shows that they actually really like her and she will see that and go for them. just because shes not clever doesnt mean anything really, its not about that. its about how nice they are and that they arent mean.  to me it just sounds like your jealous because guys arent interested in you|`|DtcuaIWmaa	Girls say that boys are stupid because they don't understand them. Girl do alot of stupid stuff them selfs so what your problem.|`|Qf5L0NWLaa	A) Guys being attracted to a cute, skinny girl with big boobs; what guy wouldn't be.  We don't 'grow out of that stage'.    B) Just because she doesn't speak English well does not mean she is stupid.  It may not be her first language.    C) A girl that doesn't speak much versus a girl that constantly babbles out every little thought that enters her head.  A lot of guys would pick the first one.  I know I would.|`|8tRY1U2Iaa	Why do girls always like the jocks who treat them like crap?    There's your answer.|`|e99f082baf624341f3874d3e40b80fe8aa	Just go find another guy that you will like..   Not every crush must end with you and him=together..
xb7ey8c0aa	Like I said before you need to have a long conversation with her about where she thinks your relationship is going.  She may think that your relationship has come to the point that it is exclusive and will end in marriage very soon.  If that is not where you are at don't have sex with her.
I08iONdaaa	you don't want to break the barrier, you want to ease your way into it. IF it's seriously there for a reason, then breaking through his emotional virginity is going to freak him out. when you're at a movie or something or hanging out on the couch, just kind of lean into him and see what he does. he might be a little awkward at first, but he might also lean back. My girl friend did something like this, and then one day she just gave me a kind of peck on the cheek. Nothing aggressive or anything. But it was pretty obvious to me at that point. haha. But she eased her way into it, and didn't freak me out, and because I liked her TOO it worked.|`|047IPSovaa	Take his hand gently while you look into his eyes.  He'll get the message|`|M2VneBW3aa	http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l9K4BKkLa...|`|p6bTb6IFaa	girlfriend u just let go theres more fish in the sea|`|IyfspYM8aa	Okay, here are some things:    If you are sitting next to him and he says something funny or goofy, knock into him softly with your soldier when you guys are laughing.  You can also so this when you meet each other unexpectedly.    Hugs are also a good way to break the barrier.  They don't have to be creepy.  Don't ask him for a hug, simply make the gesture when you say goodbye.|`|ea2395751480a69caa92c51b9cfe1156aa	Maybe he's as shy as you are, shy people can often hide it well. Try "accidentally" touching his hand or brushing against him and see what happens, read his body language when you do it.    If you get really desperate to make contact, then rub one eye a bit and pretend to have something in it. if he really likes you, he'll offer to look and that can be really intimate, helping a girl in distress.|`|QeALCWbqaa	grow as a person|`|5f3f6xAwaa	get personal with him ask personal question, send him strong signals ask him what kind of girls he likes and so on...|`|tg92pXDUaa	Walk in on him in the shower? lol|`|o8E9wsPCaa	maybe talking may help   or just make him want u are something like tat|`|AA12309903	DUNNO|`|hZxncF0yaa	okay, so this may sound silly.  but i think the most subtle way to break that barrier  is that when you see him but hes in front of you  casually grab his arm and start talking to him  i do that to so many random guys, and its not awkward at all!  haha  :)  or give him a hug when you see him and tell him some sort of good newsss!|`|n1gaa7Yxaa	haha it'd be cool if you told him to go out and then you tell him you really like him ..but i know you won't xD so just have fun live every mment like it was the last anddd.. the moment will came ALOONE ^^|`|C4LT48CFaa	Try wrestling with him, hugging him as the occasion requires, like to say goodbye or hello, lightly touch his arm during conversation.  Try playing sports or games together.  Good luck!
C0GpfPYOaa	Mmm yeah... now that I think about it, it would be handy when I'm kinda pi$sed off. Good for strangling.|`|ZPMHgfDvaa	LOL!!!!!    you're really funny!!!!    have a star! XD

Here is a great article on how to save money  http://www.associatedcontent.com/article...|`|a69669623feae1ab9569602fb1705468aa	You have to start thinking S-M-A-R-T. What kind of cutbacks can you make? For example: I drink bottled water. Now at $1 a bottle on something that covers over 65% of our planet is not smart. So I bought one of those water filters that screw into your faucet. I have bottles that I refil over and over again. I take them to work. Do you have a lot of small appliances around that house that are always on? I cut my electronic bill almost in half by unplugging all the clock radios and night lights. I also bought some of those florescent bulbs that look a lot like a regular bulb. These things use 80% less electricity than regular bulbs. You would be surprised, but these small things add up. I know I was spending money on the water filter and energy efficient bulbs but these things will pay for themselves in a month providing they pertain to you. If you really need the money right away start cutting back on your food costs. Romain noodles cost a dime and they taste just as good as campbells chicken noodle that costs $130 a can. Ok no chicken in romain noodles, but you are probably just missing about 4 tiny pieces of chicken. Put a brick inside your toilet 'chamber'. You will use a little lesser water each time you flush..Before you know it you will be ahead. Wanna be creative? Find yourself leaving lights on? Buy a motion sensor switch, the lights will turn on when you enter the room and will turn off (by a set amount of time) when you leave the room. I have one, they cost $15 at HomeDepot. Need new windshield wipers for your car? Who says you have to buy 2? You only need the new one on the drivers side, leave the old wiper on the passenger side.  So remember you have to start thinking S-M-A-R-T! Yours truly seahorsehawrey.|`|4POGapREaa	Almost everyone gets pissed off over money.  There is simply no way around it without someone feeling like they're taking the blame or being called out over some BS.  Just the word "money" can lead someone to have a freaking aneurysm & file for divorce.|`|de947568c9e8173e12d8a9930bab48abaa	Because you are working full time and he is basically dicking around doing nothing and he feels guilty.|`|8tJPK69iaa	Sit down with a financial ad visor, how mad can he get then.|`|AA11990465	 Some men are proud and feel like the financial matters are on their shoulders. |`|oqX0PwQiaa	He's stressed over money. Finances and romances are the number 1 cause of divorce. If you can handle the financial stress without having extra marital affairs you can usually work through your financial difficulties. They won't last forever.|`|16e4adeeb02361fa0a2b058a4967e42daa	Men don't like to be reminded when they're not the bread winners in the family. Money problems can ruin a relationship quicker than any thing else. You may have to play the damsel in distress. For example, "honey I've been trying to figure out what I'm doing wrong with the finances, can you help me figure this out?" He has to be the problem solver, the mister fix-it. Just talking about money when he doesn't have any is a sucker punch to the pride muscle that all men have.

fzvjSLTLaa	Your making it way to easy for him, he knows he has you so when he wants you'll already be there so he thinks he can just sweep you up and grab you when he wants.   Now it's your turn, it may cause him to act like youre now, once he realizes you got tired of waiting around like some beggar, he'll be confused and try to rekindle things back with youu, i know that you really like him and this might sound real cliche but there're plenty of fish ; PLENTY OF FISH in the sea.   it's your turn to shine and his turn to be the sitting duck, think about your feelings, it's not healthy to put yourself through this.|`|1zvEerNbaa	ask him out

Just say it like you planned it. If you say she looks nice, then it won't sound flirty. If you say that she looks hot, then you're just hitting on her. "Nice" is a good choice of words.|`|eIXrycvAaa	Yes, tell her. It's really sweet:) I know I'd like it if someone said that to me.|`|0A5ErVxTaa	This sounds good. But don't follow up with, can i have your number? or something like that. If you do, it will most likely turn her off. It is a good idea to start with something besides "hey you look really nice" since you don't really know her all that well. Pretty much, it sounds like you have the right idea.
4k5MkmInaa	The first step is to BELIEVE in yourself.    -write down your good points-what you think you're good at.everyone has something they're good at :)    try to be more laid-back-don't worry about the littlest things that get to you.    Don't care about what other people think of you.    -Never put yourself down.

l7awD5mcaa	I'm sorry to say this and I hope that I don't sound rude,  but please stop stalking him!  You are acting very clingy.  You don't need to call him every 5 minutes, you don't need to go every where he goes, you don't need to watch his house, you don't need to get dna samples, you don't need to google his records. So what if he didn't call you for 30 minutes? Maybe he was busy.  Just take a couple steps back, and let him have some space. Guys don't want girls that cling to their side and stalk him.    (I'm sorry if I sounded rude, but it's the truth)
CxunncUjaa	sounds like he's jealous, if he's comparing himself to your boyfriend  if he asks questions that are really just rude, you should tell him that it's none of his business|`|JRM0wwLNaa	He prolly has a alittlecrush on u or he could b acting like a jerk. I would would him that the questions he ask r really any of his business. U r not comfortable talking bout ur personal life with ur bf 2 any1. B blunt about ur feelings. If u keep hiding it then he will never stop. U don't have 2 mean 2 him but also sound strong about it so he knows that ur serious.|`|Ek2INE3Kaa	i think that he likes you and is jealous of your boyfriend.|`|GabGD8DUaa	its human nature. get used to it. ive been putting up with it for the past eight months|`|bK0ETaU0aa	I think he might be gay if he's asking so much about your bf and he might be waiting till u break up with him(sorry that's the only thing I could think of when I hear a dude asking "is he big?"

Otu7QfqAaa	I really feel it is important to be yourself... wear what makes you feel comfortable adn sexy.. At school try to be around him as much as you can.. and make eye contact a lot and smile.. I am telling you you will catch his attention by giving him a smile.. and if you are talking to him in the hall or something and are ready to go away just touch his arm, or shoulder as you leave and say bye.. he will remember that touch.. good luck.. but just remeber you are a great person and he doesnt see that then he is not worth your time..
23chgxiNaa	Wear whatever color looks best on you and a pair of jeans that makes your butt look great (this is what I always do :]).

ZSznCJhSaa	I'm wondering if this is a real question.    Why would you break up with your girlfriend for something that you did... something that she doesn't even know about? If you do break up with her over that... you obviously didn't care much for her in the first place.    Secondly. You are the one who touched the lipstick case, with the poo on it... maybe she should know that your hands have touched that in case she would want to break up with YOU over it.     Thirdly, her lips didn't touch the gross case, the lipstick inside was not what was touched, just the outside covering, so you don't even really have a reason to not want to kiss her.|`|rceK0oglaa	mann your i trouble now just throw it away and go buy her new lipstick or say i dont no where its at but put it somewhere she cant find it or just flush it down the toilet ha|`|ZcXQ4m0taa	wtf is this a serious question|`|1DVZ5LkRaa	you're an idiot.  eventually she will shower?  when you SAW her using the lipstick that would have been a good opportunity to tell her  if you're gonna break up with her over something you did then i just feel sorry for your girlfriend.  if this even REALLY happened.  you're the turd, in my opinion.|`|UMIRn2f6aa	?????  okayy.....  your gonna break up with her because her lipstick touched poo??  just tell her.  and tell her you didnt have time to wash it off.  and that you didnt tell her earlier because you didnt want her to be mad.  tell her your so sorry.  ....|`|z2XCCrxqaa	stop lying!   look where it got Casey Anthony!|`|USfBRbAxaa	Well, to be honest, I think she'd be pretty upset if you told her... And then possibly break up with you.     Also, is there any future in your relationship? If you're considering breaking up with her over this, then I can't see any love there.     If there's no future, and you don't love her, break up.     If you feel there is a future for you, then tell her, and if she goes off on one, try to explain, and if she's fine with it, then I suppose everything is good.     Until the next poo comes along.

If he keeps persisting tell him that since he can't accept friendship and insists on pursuing romance which you are not interested in that you two need to go you separate ways and leave you alone and stay away from you as you don't need the headaches nor stress it is causing you. If he persists still report him to the school Administration to be disciplined to leave you alone. If he is as sweet as you say he'll respect your wishes to be just friends,if he isn't then he'll show his true  colors and act like an asshole.|`|Li8jXBElaa	Tell him that you like him as a friend and maybe in the future you can be more than friends but for now you like him more only to be a friend|`|VegwUJiCaa	just tell him straight that you dont like him|`|3H9k7tN5aa	Just tell him.

Yes it's cold..but, we're used too.  Normaly our winter start in  december and stop at the end of april. From may to the end of June, it is spring, it's still cold, aroud 14 degrees and at night it turns down to 4 or 6 degrees.  The summer is realy short, start in end of june, and finish end of august.   I think that everybody here, would like to have more hot temperature, cause even during summer, it is rare to have more then 30 degree.  Often during the summer, we can have spring temperature.  Autunm start at the end of september till the end of november.  But often we have snow in the end of october, when Halloween comes, so little children usely pass Halloween with winter clothes.

AA11825404	you're a guy, it's normal for guys to have hair. no one is going to be "ewwww he has hair!!!!" now if you were a girl then people would be "ewwww she has hair!!!" but do what is comfortable to you. you really shouldn't care what people think.|`|AA11070175	everyone has hair on their arms just how much are we talking about?   and i definitely would not recommend shaving it no way.|`|e7f9613d5b480e9758d037bfe66ac6b9aa	use veet|`|7907289434c1f7ebf28e7b83319e9abbaa	Personally: I love hairy men; A hairless man, or a man who shaves/waxes his chest, arms or legs is absolutely HORRID to me, eeeeeewwwwww!!! A man is a man, not a chicken, whose feathers shoud be removed;)...And...don't bleach it either!!! Just keep it as it is!
0ox8VKwKaa	I think you know the answer. Friendship first and realize your dad gave you mixed messages. Develop and project your personality no matter how you look|`|iJrCZxy8aa	omgosh, date whoever you want    take it from a pretty girl ( a lot of people tell me)    guys like YOU are the reason to why i dont have a BF! my friend told me this guy liked me but was to scared to even talk to me, cuz he thought that i would laugh at him.    URG    so my advice is. Dont restrict your self. :)|`|f8CN2qIvaa	Date whomever you want.  You deserve someone who makes you happy, and the looks and personality are part of the same package.|`|DlPH44hCaa	your dad probably had to deal with a lot of unwanted attention, guys always wanting his wife and him maybe not feeling like he deserved her because not a lot of women were knocking down HIS door, you get what i mean? therefor, he told you not to date pretty women because of course, they attract a lot of attention, and there's always a lot of competition, a lot of guys don't want to deal with that insecurity of ''why does she like ME?'' and some hot girls are a pain in the a** because they want that attention and expect you to be 'sooo grateful' because they let you have them.. don't let those type chicks discourage you, they're a**holes and give hot chicks a bad name, there are pretty girls out there who weren't raised in a superficial state of mind ;)  your dad kind of gave you a mixed message, and i don't think he was aware of what he did to your brain when telling you this... I don't want to sound cocky, but a lot of people have labeled me 'gorgeous' and to be perfectly honest with you, i'm not attracted to good looking guys, they tend to be extremely superficial and I'm not into that at all... I tend to really really like the average-looking, unique nerdy types.. but whenever I talk to them they act apprehensive and it makes me feel like they're trying to avoid me because of what they think is to come with my ''looks'' and attention and all that sh*t    my only advice to you, and i really hope you heed it, is DON'T RESTRICT YOURSELF. I've lost out on a lot of really great guys because their dads told them to never date pretty girls.. date who you're attracted to. you deserve to be with someone who makes you happy, regardless of if they're a plain jane or a supermodel ;)
KVSQH025aa	yes bc you still had a relationship at some point so try to at least stay friends cuz you still care about each other just not in a romantic way|`|YegavBMyaa	depends on the relationship. abuse or stalker no.  yes for most. your not going to be best friends but a person should be polite.|`|VZRPSmFVaa	No.    Why put yourself (and the other person) through that?    If the relationship is over and you know it is - then move on.|`|30dcaa84e4ae3af962122e00e29297d0aa	i would leave it be for a while and maybe in the future communicate again.|`|67466c78d63c531282edf12f30416892aa	so dat ur ex will keep in touch wit u n talk to u so dat one day he'she mite decided to change his'her mind n want u bak. but dat sometime DONT happens..|`|H4XU0yDbaa	no way in hell...    if i am burning the bridges there is no way I am going to throw a rope across....  if it's done, it's done.

Im thick too and lots of guys like me even dough i have a boyfriend!|`|ZvEwLkOCaa	of course! they're gorgeous!|`|tQWvyxuaaa	some look absolutely stunning, but then again some look like they've just got home from Mc Donald's.|`|b663978a973dc30177a945edf1d63780aa	For being a chunky girl all those woman are beautiful.. Its nice to see someone except you for you. |`|EVDPFSi4aa	Some are pretty some of them look like they just got back from the local trailer park.     most of these models are not considered to the general public as "plus size"  (they look like they could be a 10-14) Plus size to me is anyone over 14 or the individuals that are 14 W or above. |`|b32e560414238926779c6d2630e98a48aa	some are very pretty and some, not so much (just like all models). But this site models you have to pay for their own subscription! That's not a model, its a site of really pretty plus size model wanna-bee's. And in the fashion industry its a shame a size 8 is considered plus size! The women on this site are more beautiful that the "fashion industries version of plus size" and don't deserve to pay to be a model.|`|tsdHndRhaa	that's great that you like a woman with curves, i think each of them have alot of inner beautiful qualities that makes there outer beauty shines even more.|`|zzaScg0haa	Some plus sized women are gorgeous, others just look like they don't take care of themselves|`|IItkpCj5aa	I think its better than skinny =]  |`|DS1P6NsSaa	i think some r pretty, but others are not so pretty|`|06SZm940aa	some are hot, some are not.  But I think the same way about normal girls.  In the modeling profession, most of the women look more like 12 year boys than real women.  I would rather see all types of women.  I am glad there is more of a variety now.|`|lWmEUapNaa	I think some are pretty, and others are not|`|ALJJKWkzaa	hell ya.|`|UI7bVzS5aa	yes and no
lMKy9Ho8aa	time. time and time alone, is the great healer. With each day, the pain will lessen. There are plenty of good people out there. Just because one relationship doesn't work, doesn't mean love is over. It just means it's time to move on and find someone else. I have been married twice and know what i'm talking about.  i was so heartbroken over a relationship; and then when the next guy came along, i felt so foolish because he was much better than the last guy.  There are plenty of people out there. the one we break up with is not the only one. good luck. =)|`|DN3lPdE0aa	not think bout it // hang out with people|`|Y8l895Hyaa	If u have a friend to lean on their shoulder you'll be fine but if you ain't got one you will feel the pain like for months or years|`|Qc3nCsXnaa	Im going through right now, I had to let my girlfriend go; beautiful (MODEL), smart, caring...yet she wasn't the one for me...It hurts a lot but I'm taking this time to focus on myself and learn from the relationship.

You should focus on you.|`|lSoIk4sqaa	its true that splitups hurt.you act courageous enough to fall into relationships bt foolish enough while trying to get out of it.most of the relations break due to doubts & bcoz their nt sure if their pair really luvs him.and after dumping or being dumped by a person it hurts bcoz yours ws a true luv.i cud hv ended to a marriage,bt broke due to fate & useless thoughts.i know i'm not giving u de rite ans,i jst wntd to mke u undrstnd.hwever it will take time to copeup with breakups.if u hv things tht remind u of hr -dump it.if u hv hr name written on u n all try to rub it off.try hanging out with friends a lot of time.also ask them to avoid hr name as a subject in ur cnvrsation.and one  naughty way is to go flirting.thts it try ur best to 4get her.gud luck!

SzQi9N7daa	An emotional affair usually entails discussing things that are private. His relationship with his GF or wife, your relationship with a BF or husband.  Hopes, dreams, fears, anything that you would normally discuss with your spouse.  It also entails constant contact as a means of connecting with the other person.  Again, something you would normally do only with a close loved one.  If you rely on this person for anything other than friendship odds are your treading on thin ice with an emotional affair.  Is it cheating? Hell yes it is.  I would also caution you that since your already emotionally engaged wit this person, the next logical step is to confuse this with love and then of course the sexual contact begins. Emotional affairs are just as devastating to those people who are effected by a physical affair.  You share something with that person who is not your spouse.        Conversely you begin to withdraw from your BF/GF or Spouse. You stop having meaningful discussions. You avoid any prolonged contact with BF/GF or spouse.  You try anything to refrain from having sex with them because sex is emotional as well as physical.  Since your emotions are conflicted and directed towards the other person you begin to think that having sex with your spouse is cheating on the person you have become emotionally connected to.          So    If you or they lie about contact with each other, if you constantly seek their attention, if you cant go through a day or week without thinking of each other, if your BF/GF or spouse asks questions and your answer is we're just friends but you hide the times your in contact.  If you avoid being with and having sex with your BF/GF or spouse. Your having an affair.     Your either the cheater or the home wrecker, which is it.|`|Zg8aORFYaa	Where you are not having a physical affair but you have feelings for them.|`|66jX06Onaa	Cheating starts in the heart and eventually becomes physical. If he were your husband, would you want him talking to another woman via email for hours at a time?|`|cebea3a8e8113acc7b540c298907a6c7aa	An emotional affair is a term used by a spouse of a so-to-be divorced person who is a flirt. Person "A" flirts, person "B" who is married to them sees this and files for divorce. Person "A" loses all credibility with both families and friends.|`|AA10531706	It is the same as cheating. I know a lady that left her husband for an emotional affair.Invite him and his wife over for dinner and let everybody get to know each other. Otherwise when the wife finds out she will immediately think there is something going on and the same w/your husband (if you are marrried). Why can't you ALL be friends? You and your friend are stealing precious time from his your spouses. I bet that you all tell each other personal things or share something in common that you don't share with your spouses. More reason to get together so that you all may have something in common. Eventually, it may get physical. I do believe that men and women can be friends, but that friend cannot be hidden from your spouse. You will wind up lying to cover it up. Put yourself in the other woman's shoes.
4c1e23e7e734c191f08c06f7b188cf51aa	guys like it when girls play hard to get. its all about playing the game. when your openly available to him, it makes there less excitement if he knows he can have you whenever he wants.|`|A3L0HiNtaa	He's probably jealous.|`|1PdUecpYaa	all guys are like that.. the minute you start ignoring them, they run after you..  it's very typical.  |`|4x2KMVbBaa	Guys want what they can't have.....or at least, they like the thrill of the chase and if you're chasing them, it's not as fun.|`|AA10170845	Absence makes the heart grow hornier.|`|b32e560414238926779c6d2630e98a48aa	cause now he's worried that you are not interested anymore. |`|d7SdhXm3aa	Guys like to chase.   They prefer to chase you, than to have you chase them.  When you'd answer all his calls and stuff, it probably gave him a self esteem boost, like "yah, she likes me" and he was confident so didn't really care about you anymore. When you don't answer, he's probably like trying to win you back or something to boost his ego.  |`|Wqr4DoJOaa	everyone wants what they can't have|`|AyIRqk0Paa	He wants to get into your pants.

I think either of these 2 reason or both:    a. playing the "game", who contacts who first until you can't take no more; kinda like ego stubborn game    and/or    b. "you don't realized what you had, till you lost it"  The lack of contact makes people feel empty, and they start to realize what the lost or miss|`|cdacceb19d4e116da160aad2e38cfe50aa	I think you're imagining all this.  lol    The TRUTH IS.  When girls are ignored they react even worse.    Most girls NEED the attention, and to be ignored...kills them.|`|Y8iZ30CKaa	Because guys want what they can't have. Its human nature. Sadly many girls get hurt because guys say that they love and want to be with them when they know thye cant have them, and when the girl gives up a lot for them, they back away and take back everything that they ever said, because the fight is over and its boring now.    Its a disgusting and horrible thing to do to a person.    |`|6gQiRUYDaa	Because like you said you are unavailable now. Guys oftentimes like girl they can't have. They take girls for granted, and when they don't have them, they regret it. When you take them back, they may change a little, but they are still kinda the same. I speak from experience.|`|Y6sOWBi2aa	Because he probably realizes how much he wants you/misses you now that you're unavailable.|`|jtXhbZOBaa	You ever heard of that expression "you want something you can't have"  |`|mjia2jT2aa	cause he cant have you, his fault for being slow|`|gsc47yumaa	yea, if u act like ur to good for him, he'll want u even more|`|iDc1DD5Zaa	all the men are the same. always you shouldn't show how much u care about them. u should act like life doesn't change without them!|`|AA10211688	because  i guess he wants challenge.. and i maybe even trying to prove a point that maybe he can get u back or something|`|EuYPuvgAaa	ahhhh. thats how guys are. Its super annoying but that is just how they function.|`|Xh1lllFEaa	Because you're no longer available he finds it exciting. It also means that he can flirt and be relatively sure that he can control the situation.  Excitement + control = happy man.|`|2f8d716fc293f3b33733dbffb01d590aaa	This is typical behavior of someone who is not really into you. Play it cool and see other people while he sorts out what he really wants.|`|4qPkJqHTaa	Guys are like that, I dont know why. Some are not, some are sweet, fun and not full of it. Others, like to play games. Maybe he like the "chase".

I'm the same way, when she's around i get bored with it but the minute she's not around it's "where is she? what's she doing? why isn't she answering my calls? i bet she's seeing someone else...she's gotta be cheating on me...i'm gonna drive by her house to make sure.. she's not home..where is she... ::call her up:: hey whats up where ya at? - my aunts- ok i'll talk to you later ::end call:: sure she's at her aunts.... probably at some guys house.... next thing you know he's got hidden cameras around ur house... stalking you lol...ok i'm not that bad but hey theres crazy people out there... point is, its how people are i dunno if you watch scrubs but a quote from that i like (and i think ihave it right) is:    "The funny thing about most people, is that when they finally get what they realyl want, they dont want it anymore. But not this guy! ::5 seconds later:: ...OH no! I dont want her!"|`|NTP7myOnaa	This is so typical of the alpa male. This guy wants to make YOU feel like the weaker, needier, less desirable one out of the two of you, but in reality HE is so dependent on YOU needing him, that because you have moved on and he is not  1 in your life anymore he is freaking out. It's really not about you, it's all about him. He is so self-involved and self-absorbed that he will now spend all his energy on "you" making it seem that he cares and misses you but the truth is he's only concerned about the spotlight being off of him. Don't even give him a second thought. He should have known the good thing he had in you when he had you. |`|AA12279561	It seems like you two are playing the hard to get game.

But often true! =P  I'd say it all really depends, on first impressions, if they show too much cleavage it sorta makes them look like a s l u t... but then again, it all really depends on the man.

I think he would go if you ask him.Didn't you say you inviting one of his friend?(HEY GIRL FRIEND CAN I GET AN INVITING TOO?.......LOL) Maybe you too will even talk to each other, and even end up having a good time.Because he can't just came to your party and not talk to you.(RIGHT ?)|`|AA10342964	yes good idea, happy b-day and have fun|`|c6aa8578e942702c51c1ae02f44f0ee5aa	yeah it might work most likely is that it will work but make sure to let him know that you want him to attend|`|79021a61b2485597895a8b7c76eff4c4aa	fabulous idea!! be sure 2 invite one of his friends 2 so he feel left out!!
h6NqNzHAaa	Only boys need to be taught that, men already know. Kick his butt into gear!
Oywmhz9xaa	Because I think most people were raised in a Christian home with Christian beliefs. That's how I was raised. I am against anything gay/lesbian. If God says it's wrong, then it's wrong. Just like adultery, robbery, murder etc... is wrong. It's what people believe.  If everyone has to believe the same thing everyone else believes that would make us a communist country wouldn't it?  I don't hate gay/lesbian people. I'm not comfortable with it either. I know it's not my place to judge to others. It's something everyone does. I have to work on it everyday. I have to remind myself that job is already taken. Too many other people forget it too.  So my beliefs is what makes me against against gay/lesbian marriage.  I know I'm not perfect and never will be. But I have to try as hard as I can everyday because my goal in life is to end up in Heaven not hell.  Everyone has to make there own choice in the things they do in life.  For some people, they want other people to make good choices too. It's just human nature.  I hope this helped in some way explain what some people are thinking and why.    Add;  Well, I don't think it's up to me to allow it or not. To me, it's just weird. I guess I think; if God thinks it's wrong, then I should think it's wrong. I do think everyone should be happy and have someone to love. I just think in the traditional way. I feel the same way about people that do other things that I don't agree with. I don't hate them and I will talk with them as I would anyone. I can say, if there is someone I don't like and don't want to be around them I don't hide it from them. That's just being two faced.   Try thinking about something you have a strong belief against, how do you feel inside? Do you kinda know now how others feel (about gay marriage is not right).?  It's just a deep seeded life long thought/belief.  I hope this doesn't come across as me being smart @ss, cuz thats sure not how I mean to sound.|`|4POGapREaa	I have no issues with it at all.  But that wasn't your question.  My husband is against it.  It's just splitting hairs as far as I can tell.  He has no problem with it as long as it's called a "civil union" and not "a marriage".  Whatever.  Six of one or a half dozen of the other.  It's all the same thing.  Makes no sense to me.|`|b32e560414238926779c6d2630e98a48aa	I doesn't bother me, Im straight and married. Others people choice on who to marry doesn't affect me, if it were my children, same thing. I have no business sticking my nose in other peoples sex preferences. What could i gain by fightingg someone elses' choices.|`|bpjpD7W3aa	God Himself sanctified marriage, God's word says it is between a man and a woman. 'marriage'' between homosexuals is just a peice of paper of this sinful world, it is an abomination in the sight of God, a stench.|`|rDrttpfIaa	I am a straight married women  and I am very supportive of gay marriages.  If straight people can get married in 10 minutes in Las Vegas then the homosexual couples who have been together FOREVER have the right.  Love is Love..Love is Blind. Everyone should have the opportunity to be married.   It would not affect straight marriages. If anything it would make them stronger. i don't see how people get off saying it will ruin the "sanity" of marriage. The meaning of marriage is about two people, the love that binds them together. Letting people express their love for one another is amazing...and should be free to everyone.   I for one would be honored if a homosexual couple was married at the exact same place i was. because they feel just the same amount of love that my husband and I shared.|`|IpgKy6M4aa	The idea that someone out there, doing that nasty gay sex - and CALLING it the same thing as their marriage is just  eeewwwwwww.    So, as long as they can keep them (gays) from CALLING it the same thing, they (straights) can keep from thinking it while they (straights) are doing it - and they (straights) won't become impotent because of making nasty gay porn inside their (straight) brain.    As soon as gays can CALL what they're doing the same thing straights CALL what they're doing - then they (straights) have to think about it - and - ewwwww - Suddenly, they (straights) can't do what they (straights) was doing before - and they (straights) have to think gay porn in their brain and they're suddenly frightened that they are somehow also secretly ... them (gay).    So, we can't let gays who want to do that CALL it what straights CALL it (at least they're not allowed to use the officially-sanctioned NICE name for it) - else the straights (especially the Christian ones) will be forced by scripture to make gay porn in their brains and they'll miss the rapture!|`|ZtfN4J6taa	If gay people have a partner and they are happy with that person, what is the sense or urgency to get married ?   Once any couple gets married the fun is over, most marriages end in divorce, especially with gay couples as they are more promiscuous than straight people.|`|IAllZ5bLaa	I personnaly think that there is no wrong kind of love. However, I will tell you what my soon to be mother-in-law proudly declares about the abomination of same sex marriages. And yes, it will be a lengthy post :D     She has a complete religious background. That alone (the quotes of bible from the ol' town that got oblivirated) is one of her most used reasons. She believes that it violates God's Will, and also states that in Corienthians that when love is discussed it is always between male/female, not same sex.     Her second largest reason is well, plumbing. She feels that our species does not reproduce with same sex (which i suppose is obvious). That is goes against our biological nature. That if it were intended to be same sex, we'd rather be asexual creatures or andrgoynous.    Lastly she'll generally end with a statement about how people who claim to like the same sex were either raped or abused, confused because of that, or grew up without the same sex role model. (for instance, she'd claim that a girl growing up without a mother would seek female relationships to fill the void and visa versa). (which i tell her is complete sterotyping)    I can't really go into detail much further on her argument because she gets angry that I tell her if I had a child that was gay it would be the same as if they weren't. She told me promptly that she'd never allow them in her house, though she'd "love" them enough to pray for their salvation. /sigh, but I cannot agree with her really, so that's as far as the controversal issue goes. :D    Also, as a side note, Some people do not feel that a gay relationship is "real" like a male/female relationship is. I'm not really sure why they say that, but it is one of the arguments i've heard about protecting marriage, which is supposedly "real" commitment.    hope that was some insight for you and forgive the spelling/grammar erros :D|`|oXF4zkAaaa	I have no problem with it, but if it is true that god wants only men and woman married does this mean that same gender marriages are all going to hell?
YyMFDs6Eaa	yes! its soo cute :)|`|Dzr2ZcdZaa	girl like guys that are shy, but as soon as you start a conversation with them try not to be so shy because being too shy is unnatractive|`|NEyQTW3Saa	yes i do|`|pX5Vuatcaa	yes its always possible...sometimes they like shy guys than handsome not shy ones
KkSW6EViaa	Hilarious.|`|eiJOdPgxaa	just turn that around for a second ; you lost weight, gained confidence in yourself and grew up.  Therefore you are probably giving off different vibes these days and that is what attracts them!|`|2oXy22pvaa	Yeah, cause well, looks do matter. It's what first makes someone interested in ya. Like, guys may say looks don't matter. But they never bother to get to know a girl for their personality IF they don't look decent. Kinda dumb of em :P I know guys can and some probably do care more about the personality, but it's a lie to say they don't care about the appearance|`|kB7UsIXdaa	i agree|`|LykjWv6faa	I think looks matter to everyone to an extent, no matter how much they tell you it's only 'personality.' Even girls do this too.|`|cqzZjRVwaa	Well I'll admit it, I'm shallow so looks do matter for me. However, I am still a firm believer that personality is also very important, because when you are 89, you want to be able to have an interesting conversation with your partner, and not about how she chipped her nail. Looks don't last forever, despite how much plastic surgery you get.|`|r8rykCkGaa	The lustful guys are the ones who acts like looks is absolutely everything but if you have discernment you should be able to tell who they are.  I don't want anything to do with those shallow characters who only want to satisfy their urges at the expense of others.  I don't have any respect for them.|`|DOoHDBTiaa	yup so true|`|QjavEeQXaa	Totally agree with you on that.|`|ssT6J7ifaa	i soo agree with you!!! Guys fall at my feet to but they just want sex and i DONT let them. Stand strong!|`|5E4t2xqNaa	Everyone has a preference.  I wouldn't date a fat slob. But some guys like that.|`|s30Duwdraa	That is a pile of poop!  Looks MATTER!!    Same thing happened to me.  I was always slim and got attention.  Then I gained 20 pounds or so... the attention was gone!    A few months later and 25pounds lighter, I was getting hit on left, right and center!  (men are friggin pigs!)    But I do think the same goes for women to a certain extent.  We judge men by their looks too.  And other women, for that matter.    Unfortunately, we live in a judgmental, materialistic society.  How we look impacts most of our daily lives (interviews, work, school, special events etc.)     and men are friggin pigs!  :)|`|vrfuO9Asaa	yeah i do agree|`|SRZza0cWaa	i agree|`|Nnplp5Qqaa	I concur.|`|LyoKmnZZaa	looks matter|`|pLW8RrORaa	looks don't matter when it come to "girlfriends"     when it comes to just hooking up, they do.|`|kWBXSjHXaa	Most guys care all about the looks looks come 2nd to me but its still important and if your chubby then i guess you know what guys will think..|`|2gh84Ec6aa	of course looks matter.  i mean seriously, who would want to date someone that doesn't take care of their selves.. wears the same clothes everyday.. or anything.  i'm not selfish but you have to agree, it makes sence.|`|Mwb5UkPBaa	I agree that to most guys looks really do matter. Mean I think some men are just pigs. I'm a girl. To me looks don't matter all that much. However, how do we know that guys don't think the same things about us. (Like guys saying all girls care about are look when they say the don't. lol.) So in a way how can we really all be 100% sure.|`|DiPc84wQaa	to be honest, looks doo matter, for me to like a girl she doesnt have to be like extremely pretty or anything but she cant be like over weight and stuff, she has to , in my opinion look decent, and ofcourse have a good personality. if a girl looks really pretty but has a crappy personality then i'd never like her ^_^     Hope this helps :)|`|SzQKCeRqaa	Looks do matter, obviously. But Personality > Looks. The girl needs to be somewhat attractive.    And anything you girls are complaining about can be switched right around the other way.|`|WQOC6ILMaa	Yah anybody who says they don't matter is lying. What initially attracts me to a girl is how she looks. It has to take one amazing personality before I see personality. It can happen but not too often. Sorry we're so shallow just the way we're made I guess. Glad things turned around for you.|`|is4zQxltaa	true story. for the majority of guys, looks are about 50-60% of the reason they go out with a girl. its what first attracts someone, because its the physical traits they see first.   i hate when guys insist on that. what a load of jerks. :P  then again, there r some guys (few and far between i'll admit) that care more about personality and less about looks.|`|KtJELbPzaa	I agree.........100%|`|6846a3395d16d18b95b001a1bda626a1aa	Men are more visual as earth creature are concerned, so looks do matter, but they vary from person to person.

They're so backwards they don't know which way they're going!|`|ZcXQ4m0taa	i agree|`|SRPwwLJ9aa	looks don't matter but people's preferences are some people don't want to go out with a cute fat chick, they rather go out with a cute slim chick even in the animal kingdom the one who gets the mate is the fittest one around. think about go out with the obvious unhealthy chick or go out with the obvious she looks healthy and takes care of herself. plus when guys say looks don't matter were talking about the face hun not the rest.|`|skxhE5owaa	And what? This is just a guy thing?  Let's be honest, girls can be just as shallow as some guys, I mean, you're nearly all like, oh my, this singer/guitarist/sportsman is well fit!  Or you all fancy whoever is the hottest guy in the school, even if you've never talked to him.  Girls judge on looks just as much, if not more, than guys.  And you can't stereotype all guys like that, if I find a girl genuinely nice then I won't give a damn how she looks.|`|zhNpB1uuaa	hmmmmmmmm|`|PPW5A954aa	Yeah, they think it makes them look sensitive but it is such a blatant lie!|`|xfpFimGYaa	I can't understand you|`|yQgUcJ1Taa	Girls say looks don't matter, but when I was short, it was difficult to get a date.  Once I grew taller (6'1''), it was much easier to get girls to go out with me.

He is fantastic. I love him.    So NOT every woman is looking for an asshole, we just need one to break our hearts so that way we know what we have when we find the good man. Just like ya'll need a ***** to break ya'll first before your happy with the sweet girl.    And I would rather make my own money and pay for my own ****, and I do. So thats bullshit about how we all change our tune when we find out how much money a guy has.  Thats just the way life is.|`|AA10531094	Boy, you really have an inferiority complex.  I don't care how many different ways you post this question. . . it still shows woman really upset you.

Good Luck!|`|AA12272885	You are way off base here.  Girls want a guy to respect and cherish them, while maintaining some independence.  Girls (just like guys) want to work for what they get, so you should never give them quite all they want.   There is a huge difference between being a confident, loving and faithful guy who is his own man, and a wussy little doormat.  No one wants the latter, the the former is very hard to find.|`|AA11447210	Actually, per your complaint the women (or so you think) aren't going for the good guys. If that's the case, there are a lot of single good guys and they WILL still be around when the women tire of the bad boys...where else would they be? According to you, women don't want them until they've been used and abused by the jerks.    Don't know much about women really, do you? Sorry you've been overlooked for a bad boy but you good guys have to understand, being a wall flower doesn't get you noticed...and there is a great difference in being a good guy (positive) and a doormat (negative).    Good luck sugar ?|`|P0jxi2Huaa	Consider all the women you have ever been in a relationship with. They are all different individuals. The one thing that all your relationships have in common is you. If you have been called clingy, maybe that's because you are clingy, and that is what ruins your relationships. People need space. Instead of trying to blame all the women on the planet for your relationship problems, perhaps you should take a good long look at yourself first.|`|AA12275607	wow. Pretty bitter huh?  You are right to an extent. Women want good, faithful men who will be there for us but we also want excitement. We want fun and spontaneity. Unfortunately, rarely does it come in the same package. The very fun, outgoing guys tend to be cheaters because they CAN. They tend to always have alot of admiration and most women want them.    On the other hand, MOST (not all) good guys tend to be boring and laid back. They will work hard and support their families and are faithful to their women. Their women however, always has to pump them to get involved. they tend to be home bodies and shy away from social gatherings.     So spice things up in your relationship. Do some fun things with your woman. Take her out unexpectedly and so on. That should help to create a balance for you my good guy.|`|Axs0Nj6Naa	I would just like to say you have grouped all of us women into 1 category and that's NOT fair. Yes, there are women who say men are weak and they don't realize what they have until it's gone. It's true, it happens. But you are taking your ex and putting all the rest of us into her category. I am not like her... I am into the nice guys because I know the "badasses" are going to screw me over. I've had my share of getting screwed over, so don't act like you're the only one out there.   And about the money.. again, you're categorizing us all. I don't give a flying f                   uck about how much money my guy makes, it's HIM that I care about. YES, there are women who are "gold diggers" , but not all of us are like that. I know you got hurt from your ex... but that is her.... don't try to put any sh        it on the rest of us who haven't done F all.

1e5e770f583f8bf7d60243fb178705b8aa	Querida amiga:        En mi opinion lo unico que esta haciendo contigo es utilizarte, se oye muy frio pero creo que es la verdad, debes de darte tu lugar, de quererte un poco mas a ti misma para que te valores aun mas, se que eres una persona valiosa por el simple hecho de poder amar a alguien mas, desgraciadamente estas amando a la persona equivocada.      Es muy cierto que ustedes como mujeres se enamoran demasiado de la primera persona con la que tienen relaciones sexuales intimas, pero debes de darte cuenta de la clase de persona que es este tipo, si no quiere ni siquiera complacerte con el uso de condon, creeme que no te quiere como l dice, yo te recomiendo que lo mandes a volar, que te des la oportunidad de encontrarte contigo misma y veras como todo te cambia; al principio puede ser dificil y doloroso, pero ponte a pensar en esto: En este hermoso planeta Tierra somos mas de seis mil millones de personas, ?no crees que puedas encontrar a alguien mas que te ame como tu amas y que te de tu lugar?  yo estoy seguro que si.

Forma una 'O' con los labios, ponlos cuidadosamente en la punta de su miembro y mueve la cabeza en crculos diminutos.  Coloca los labios ajustndolos al tronco y recrrelo, primero a un lado y despus al otro. Coge la punta de su pene suavemente entre tus labios, con giros rpidos, besndolo tiernamente y tirando hacia atrs de su suave piel. Permite que el glande se deslice completamente en tu boca y presiona el tronco firmemente entre tus labios. Sostn la presin un momento antes de soltar.   Forma de nuevo un crculo con tus labios y besa a todo lo largo de su longitud, succionando y besando al mismo tiempo. Mientras besas, permite que tu lengua "aletee" por todo su pene acabando en el extremo. Golpeando con ella repetidamente la sensible punta del glande.  Permite que su miembro penetre en tu boca tan profundamente como te sea posible (sin ahogarte, mujer), presionndolo y chupndolo. No le soples nunca dentro en el pene.  Puede ocasionar una infeccin.  Tambin puedes acariciar y besar sus testculos.   No consientas que te digan otra cosa: La decisin es tuya. Puedes permitir o no llegar hasta el final y que l eyacule en tu boca. Igual que puedes tragarlo o no, segn te agrade o no su sabor.  Por aqui tengo algunos otros consejos que te podrian funcionar, que con gusto puedo compartir contigo.    Saludos|`|fbcebc112d242ef84761c6405add753faa	Hola! vi que preguntas si es malo que te guste el morbosismo. Sabes? no tiene absolutamente nada de malo.

3Vyw9Si1aa	I was in the EXACT same position in 8th grade, freshman year I started becoming more outgoing and now I'm outgoing with guys and girls (I used to just freeze up when around the guy I had a crush on).    What I did was just push myself, especially with guys, because that was my weaker point. Just force yourself to take the extra step. As for normal everyday situations, just start conversations more, go up to random people you know but haven't talked to much and say hi. Make small talk. If you have something in common with them, like they also act/dance, it will be even easier. Or if you have a friend that plays tennis or something, ask her about that. People generally like talking about themselves. You can even talk about school if you want, like if you have a class with them. The conversation will go from there. Just act comfortable around them, even if you don't, eventually you will.     I wish I had become outgoing earlier, but I'm glad that I finally am now!    Hope this helped!!!!!!  Good Luck!!!!!|`|SzQKCeRqaa	Opposite for me, at school I am really loud and stuff, and around my parents quiet.     Shy is okay though, you just have to be confident and shy at the same time.|`|L4QhCMcSaa	Find and make friends at school  Once you feel comfortable around  your friends your going to feels  comfortable with the school  and your will be loud!!

Good Luck!  :)|`|fzvjSLTLaa	since you said you only speak when spoken to,   well when youre around your friends you should for all more feel comfortable to speak and join into whatever topic they speak of,   interacting will get you to alot of places and get you to meet & conversate with many new people, mingle in, not too much because from personal experience they'll think your weird(your friends ; it's fine to do when ever you want)  you might be holding alot of good ideas and opinions inside, let people notice you by hearing you.

Blocking him off totally though is a total *** move..  maybe thats why he keeps emailing you so much to just show you of how much of a jerk you are being to him...|`|6dyIRIEaaa	OMG LOL JOIN THE CLUB|`|QAwwmDuDaa	Tell him to back off or you'll get your cousin whos just came out of jail for murder to kick his a$$,i know you don't have a murderous cousin but he doesn't,lol.|`|NGTuXvM8aa	can you say psycho?

Anyways when I started seeing someone new he started calling me every hour, and not just on my cell phone but calling my work too, one day I finally just told him that if he called me one more time I was going to call the cops and have him put in the looney bin, he really needs help, and maybe they can help him there, and he stopped calling. Thank God....Now I see him around and he is embaressed by what he did so he doesn't talk to me more than to say hi. Thank God.....Some people just don't get the words...it's over.|`|vRmsvSb6aa	Just tell him about the other dude. Like how he pleases you sexually and all that.

1xHbgqB5aa	Well I really don't think that you are guilty of anything. And I'm not sure you really do have higher standards, even though you think so yourself.  It's just a matter of taste. It's perfectly normal to dislike a girl who is generally considered attractive. Although so many say she's like pretty or something, there's some thing that you just don't like. It could be anything from height and weight, color of eyes and hair, even the body posture or the voice... And coincidentally that's happening to you often, so you might seem like you have high standards, when you're merely following your own mind, heart, intuition...  So going with your own taste is not only good, but somewhat obligatory. I mean what chances could your relationship have if you simply don't like the girl.  This is fitting into the definition of generalization- blindly following what everyone else says. So don't do that and do what you please... And don't ever feel guilty at all.. :D|`|SsI4LLUZaa	You are just shallow because all you care about are looks.|`|swJuTXcSaa	its all in the mind|`|SyHmExgtaa	You're not wrong. You like what you like and you have that right.|`|zGgUsEmdaa	It just means you're picky. x|`|NGDMRWqBaa	nah, its alright just make sure that your standards aren't so high that no one can meet them. i am the same way with very high standards. problem is i end up going out with drop dead hot girls yet they are just brain dead... finding someone attractive on the outside and inside is tough...|`|X9xNgS4Zaa	you will end up miserably single----you have to lower your standards a bit because the girl that you are looking for may not exist, take the girls that are available and imperfect because you never know, an imperfect girl might end up being your soulmate.|`|Xf93fRTTaa	Keep it up and you'll be lonely and miserable later in life.    You must look for substance. Go for a woman for more enduring reasons than her pretty face and her figure.|`|MrDNaxYAaa	Hey, I;m pretty picky myself when it comes to guys. Its no big deal if you have high preferences. because that how you feel and just because you feel that way it does not mean your a bad person all it means is that it may be harder to get a girlfriend :)|`|mfFh1OAgaa	yep i was like you. i am very harsh and very likeee dry. so i will always think God she looks foul. but dont, a few months ago i realized this.    you can hav great fun with the ugly or under average chicks.    but im like you, im not ugly nor really hot, but i have managed to very nearly get the hottest girl in the year.    but dont always think about looks. as like even the hottest chicks can be bitches.|`|bYFS7xBCaa	why ?    anyway , it is your choice.it is you who decides.     I would advice you to look for a girl who is honest to you.|`|yAe44Eovaa	There is absolutely nothing wrong with having high standards. I mean, when you go shopping for a car, you want the very best car that is going to fit your needs for as long as possible. You aren't going to lower your standards and buy a crappy car. No, you'll keep looking until you find one.    Why would you ever want to "settle" for a girl who doesn't fit all of your needs?|`|s4M7tJU5aa	overlooking the fact that you are judging purely on looks and answering your question.... "is it wrong for having high standards?" (in looks)    no its not wrong per say... smart? well thats another story    your limiting yourself to only a handful of girls but hey you don't deserve to get laid anyway so why should i give you advice|`|KtJELbPzaa	why would there be something wrong with that. yuh have ur opinion like they have theirs.|`|ZlkqCoBWaa	Your just shallow, and probably a dick head, most girls wouldn't want to date you even if you were "hot" or whatever, because you are shallow.|`|24fjUKaVaa	Yes and No. Yes because that just means that you are shallow and no because sometimes you can't help what you like. But, if I were you I would be doing my best to lower them because if you don't your probably going to end up alone.

K8R4fCsZaa	I'm being serious.    it is because your working with a french teacher it is all subconscious the french are known to be sexy and open with sexual things so you are most likely filtering your thoughts using those stereotypes just get a picture of her and jank it a few times a night to keep your self sane and always remember it is just a sexual fascination with her because she is exotic to you nothing else and you should get on by without ruining your self by telling her or jumping on her like a horny dog lookign for a good leg hump!|`|68dae82437ede9e0c39dc1f85e7252a5aa	Let it go, start dating someone your age and your mind will go elsewhere.|`|iJrCZxy8aa	i think we all have times where we are attracted to a teacher.

Lots of females/males have a crush on their teacher(s). But please don't tell no one, it'll come back to you and smack you right in your face. I would keep it to yourself and to not tell no one. My advice on this is to not flirt with her. I'm a high school student and yes I have found a male teacher cute (I'm female and 15) but the thing is I am not attracted to him at all. He's not one of my teachers. But don't flirt with the french teacher. You can get in trouble. It's normal for students to have crushes, but be careful.  Many girls/guys have slept with his/her teacher and that teacher lost his/her job from it. The student well most likely will get expelled and have a recorded not to mention the court and all your friends will know.|`|ZG9zdEVaaa	How old are you??? Forget it. Off limits.

761d8108b19530927cb8a24b14164850aa	I also felt the same when I was growing up (I'm 44 now.)  The only advice that I would give you now would be to follow your feelings and don't be afraid to take a chance once in a while in asking a girl out.  I tended to be shy in school.  There were many girls that I liked but I couldn't muster up the balls to ask them out.  Now, I wish that I had.  See, if you start out as a teenager being a bit shy and not taking any chances of being rejected then your shyness will only grow over time until it becomes more of a fear -- and then you will miss out on many good times and feelings that you were naturally born to experience.  I was a virgin until I was 24.  Before that I always felt as if I was missing out on life -- looking back...  I missed out on a lot of lifes experiences simply because I feared rejection.  Don't make the same mistake I did...  take a chance and seize the rewards.    P.s; you'll discover over time that the girls are just as afraid of rejection as a lot of us boys (men) are most of the time.|`|18ed7c163665f54b94145be064f008ebaa	Sack up, pal.

In the mean time though just hang out and get to know her. Tell your friend you like her/ are intersted in her aswell. Maybe they'll understand. That pain in ur stomach is natural, it'll leave soon enough.|`|b0673fd40ca7ef81a3868292de758bd7aa	Casually ask if she would like to hang out.

You must ask her out. The way to overcome your fear of her not liking you is by being confident. Here's an exercise to perform for this: Close your eyes and imagine the worst possible thing she can say to you when you ask her out. Feel the moment. You might actually feel embarrassment. That's okay. Now, rewind this in your head as if it was a movie, and play it back, but this time, imagine that her voice is a high-pitched chipmunk. Rewind it again, and give her a big nose, once again, having her say the same thing. Play it backwards, speed it up, slow it down, and make her look ridiculous. This makes you impervious to being embarrassed and you will  realize that the worst she can say to you will come off as silly and funny to you if it actually happens. Good luck!

9ea5e8dd576fe0621bb8f8f8c17c8e7baa	Very common. Making friends at any age is not something easy. First things first. To have friends means you have to be a friend first. Would you be friends with yourself? Are you generous? Do you help out people when they need it? Smile, people like to be around positive people and joyful people.  Make someone happy every day by telling them what you like about them...or buy them a litttle gift, something you know they like! It could be just a chocolate bar! You are often at work, therefore you should start there. Then, maybe join a group of some sort.....learn a new sport, take up a class, twice a week...you will meet plenty of people in  a great environment. Hope this helps!|`|XhGR7RMnaa	How about your friends back from college or high school? Can you reconnect with them? Or, join a church maybe?|`|ACfSSOypaa	You could always meet people through your children.  If they play sports at least one parent will be at a game, walk up introduce yourself, talk about your kids, etc.  Where you work, if there is someone that you are particularly close to or always talk with, ask them if maybe one night after work do they want to grab a couple of drinks.  Join a club, take a class, go to church.    Good luck.

Do not put anyone on the spot if they do not want to be, and just encourage everyone to get a long with similiar interests... if you are a guy then do something most guys like, say sports, video games, hanging out watching tv, playing pool etc...     if it is a mixed group of boys and girls then just do something that everyone would enjoy say a movie or something...   just have fun and dont  be worried cause if you are worried than more than likely something will happen!|`|19c4c334ae2a06845d3107b59a71dcf2aa	oh yeah! ive gone to a lot of those types of parties! i dont know half the people but if they all like you, odds are, they'll all like eachother! just make sure to have lots of activities (wow that sounds lame...) but you know what i mean!|`|50jzZ9fWaa	I had many sleepovers when I was younger.

wT5KBfVcaa	I don't think you are selfish. This is your wedding, after all, and you already did so much for your friend.     I think friendships work best if both parties sacrifice a bit. Go for the lights, it's your limo - it's your life.|`|c50f572e5e61ab07304dd4007815daacaa	I don't think that you are being selfish, however I think that you need to take a look at the lights prior to the wedding with your friend.  If she can't handle the lights, won't it ruin your wedding anyways if she has a seizure.  I think you need to consider whether it's more important to have lights in your limo or you're friend healthy on your wedding day.  Once again, I don't think you are selfish.  This is your wedding day and you deserve to get everything you want on this day, but if one of those things is your epileptic friends in your wedding than, as you already know and have shown, that you need to make sacrifices which may extend to the lights in your limo.|`|NLN9JmrMaa	Neons won't cause a seizure...it's really just strobe lights, but many, many photographs during the course of the day would create a strobe effect.

Clearly that is minus the drink.    You have lost her trust for now, even though she is concerned for you, you must accept at this stage that your ex wants to be able to step back and view things in a less hectic emotional state.    You  may know a lot about your ex, but there may be something she didn't tell you and your actions may have reminded her of something that frightened her in the past  To get over it properly you may need to change the environment completely that may not happen until you can  leave Uni.    So back off, be cool and kind and have no expectations of her other than as a friend.  Make sure you tell her thank you, just once clearly and sincerely.  Let your ex make the next move.    Make efforts to make new friends, so that you can both move on if that is what needs to happen.    Not a time for you to plan your love life at present, you just have to go with the flow. If it doesn't work out, learn from the experience so that next time you feel yourself going 'off the rails' you wont take it out on those around you however unintentionally.|`|3834a20f7f3cce655a7beeba92c29db0aa	very hard to say,but you need to get your life on track 1st and for most before getting a relationship going.Take the time you need to get your duck's in a row sort of to speak( meaning time to get you life together and on track) best wishes & good luck|`|74cd03c7cfc8953c268c1f26cb2025d9aa	As she is still there supporting you, it must mean she still cares.

Reconozco que aqu en la Capital hay mucha gente de lo peor, que insultan a la gente y se comportan de una manera asquerosa, pero habemos muchos tambin que somos gente decente.

AA12070575	Sounds like you derserve much better treatment. Girl, I know what your going trhough my husband plays the same games except the parts about being with other girls. There are some things you should not take. You should pull yourself together for you baby's sake and say when you are ready to start being a father and take your vows seriously "then call me!" Apparently he needs a paternity test if he has doubts about being the father. I would get that done first. A man with doubts like that can weigh on a relationship. Also, you must decide what is best for you... Your child senses your pain and stress and if you are constantly stressed than it cant be good for your child. Just get the paternity test done and if he doesnt straigten up after he knows in black and white than kick his *** to the curb and find a man that appreciates you for the sweet and loving person you are...|`|9ad86643bed620a483f30b4cc1852732aa	Leave him.

U should give urself more respect even if he's not doing it, show him that ur worth alot more than what he's trying to make u feel like. Don't answer his calls and just completely ignore him so he can finally realize that he didn't value u as much as he should've. Don't give in, never give in, guys always know the exact thing to tell u to get to u or play with ur heart. Do not let it happen anymore!! I think i read that ur pregnant (not sure) if its his or not u don't need him to go one, in fact u dont need any man to go on its just u and ur baby.

Maybe she is shy and is just being careful and wants to get to know you first which is perfectly understandable.  I would be cautious as well on the first date.  I would not say that she is necessarily standoffish but just wanting to get to know you somewhat at first.  Maybe she is watching your movements and what you say to get a read on you and you should be doing the same.  It is best to be cautious at first because you never know the real person until you have been with them a few times and known how they may be through a few weeks.

dnoJPmG7aa	Everyone is attracted to different faces, traits & qualities about a person.  People in general especially girls like to be treated well. Be yourself, be kind, be genuine & sincere about your efforts to build good character. Work with what you have & take care of yourself. Confidence goes a long way. Be comfortable with who you are. All these things develop overtime. Also it is important to like yourself & don't doubt what you see in the mirror. The is crucial for someone else to like you or be attracted to you.  How can someone like you if you don't believe in what your selling them "yourself".  Find what your good at personality wise & evolve. For example if your naturally funny put that out there as a selling feature about yourself. Girls love someone that can make them laugh. All of this tosses up to experience as well. You'll find out what works for you & what doesn't. Remember be yourself & find something that's unique about yourself & build on that.  Good Luck...|`|rMTq7yMyaa	No    They neeed to be charming and sweet and funny.|`|W1rCsvTzaa	Charming/funny and confident helps.

My girlfriend is smokin' hot and I look like a goblin.   You just have to be fun, friendly, and outgoing.
tlHIqvdnaa	First, I think that you must ask yourself the reason you want to know this answer. Is it because you have a personal conviction that seems to to convince you that sex is wrong prior to marriage or do you just want to know because you are interested in knowing what others have to say about this. Basically, how will the many answers you receive benefit you?    Personally, I have to let you know according to the Word of God, you should not have sex before marriage because it is indeed a sin. You will hear a lot of people trying to justify their reasons for having sex before marriage - Christians and non-Christians, but wrong is wrong and if you want to stay in the PERFECT WILL of GOD, you must be obedient to his Word. I pray that you are already a Christian, however if not, I pray that you give the one true and living God the opportunity to show you how you can live a life that is acceptable and pleasing to him - Also, both guys and girls are guilty of not having stable relationships. It depends on how mature they are and if they are interested at that specific time in having a stable and committed relationship- hope this helps!|`|t8gWcBaeaa	yes, if u noe that thats the person ur guna spend the rest of ur life with :)    if not. no :) wat is the point?|`|rnXLZJyXaa	Yes, don't let religion control you, besides, you are missing out on many wonderful experiences if you wait till marriage, do what makes you happy.|`|C9BctAMQaa	YESSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSS|`|LykjWv6faa	It all depends on your own personal morality. Some people, especially those who are true catholic, believe that it is morally wrong because of what God tells them in the bible. Others believe that it's okay as long as you're in a committed relationship while even more people believe that casual sex is okay because it just gives pleasure. I personally am not against pre-marital sex, but it has to be with someone you love and care for and eventually plan to marry. Too many children these days think they're in love and give up everything that's pure for some sleaze that buys them a teddy bear.|`|01pY6dW9aa	A lot of them do regret it.. that's why it's wise to wait, cuz then you wont have any regrets!  and ya i agree too.. a lot of ppl dont have stable relationships.. not just guys, but guys and girls. They think they're in love and all, but no they're not.|`|x02jsjg6aa	Because life doesn't work that way.  What can seem to be a great relationship can become a horrible one as the two partners get to know each other better.  Then often they discover they really don't want to be together.  That's what dating is all about- learning.    Sex is just a part of dating.  People enjoy sex and it is not difficult to have sex without getting pregnant.|`|NGDMRWqBaa	right and wrong is defined by perspective... it depends who's perceptive your looking through. the only perspective that should count is yours and that's how you define right and wrong. everyone has a different perspective on whats right and wrong. just listen to yourself and not to others.|`|0A5ErVxTaa	Well, it depends on what you believe. Personally, I don't think it's right, I can't imagine getting married and telling my husband with whom I've done things like that with. That's just me though. I don't see what good comes out of it before there is a real relationship and a promise between two people.|`|AA10783670	Do you drive a car before you buy it?

eSVTVKNVaa	no offense..but your dad sounds like a d-bag. but he HAS to pay child support.|`|Mzjoeld4aa	theres always a homeless shelter....|`|JurCyY2Gaa	just make sure you are there for your mom.  take this opportunity to grow closer to her. tell her you love her.|`|tA8T4QYFaa	You're too focused on things - you will get through this OK. You're mom will find a place to rent and life will go on. It's more important to be a close family and provide support for your mother - and understand that she'll be very stressed - so be on your best behavior and relax - it's not the end of the world.|`|s1LfdCdsaa	Hi. Dad is going to have to "man up" and take responsibility for finances. If you are 15, I'm going to assume that your parents have been married for at least that long. This means he will not only have to pay child support, but may very well have to pay alimony or maintenance to your mother for up to three years. Here are a few suggestions for Mom:    * She should ask Dad to move out right away, then go to the County Courthouse on Monday and ask for paperwork for "Pendente Lite" or interim support. What this means is that she will be asking the Court for an order that Dad start making maintenance and child support payments right away. She should have a copy of last years' income tax return, which shows Dad's employer and his earnings from the prior tax year. The Court will use this amount to determine the amount he will have to pay each month. Mom should insist that his wages be garnished, so that the payroll processing company at his job will take the money out of each paycheck and forward it to the Support Collection Unit. They will then forward the money to Mom. Should Dad try to evade this obligation, the District Attorney will go after him.    In the meantime, Mom needs to ask family members for help. Is there a relative who can move in and share the expenses? Granted, the house may have to be sold as part of the divorce, but having a relative help with expenses will hopefully prevent foreclosure. I'm also assuming Mom has a full time job. If not, she needs to get one, even if it just pays minimum wage. If you are able to get working papers, you may want to consider a part time job after school, so that you can help as well.    If Mom is thinking about bankruptcy, she may be eligible for Legal Aid. Monday morning she should call the local Legal Aid Society (you can Google the phone number) to find out if she can have an attorney assist her. The most important thing she needs to do is get that Court order attaching Dad's salary, so he will have to pay his fair share.    Good luck.|`|yacLHWqEaa	im so sorry... but remeber yur parents will always love u....|`|4Y2w3EeXaa	steal as much stuff from your dad as possible to sell for money because once the divorce goes through, you'll never see him again.|`|i4rCbS58aa	I wish you the best of luck :)|`|wjz3RUTAaa	Get your parents to make up    Sit them on the couch and start making them talk it out and make sure that they will be together forever|`|Uu4vUvexaa	try praying for them   if you do not believe in God i do not know what to tell you|`|yy45iAbtaa	your dad will have to pay child support and alimony so i think your mom selling the house would be for them to split the money if she would fight it in court she would win so i don;t know what your moms finances are.and you are to young to get involved don;t worry your mom will take care of you.|`|d5dKlgEPaa	When your parents get a divorce, the court will usually split the house fifty fifty, meaning it will get apraised, and either one of your parents would have to buy the other out, or they would have to sell it and split the money.  If your mom does file bankrupcy she could probably qualify for government housing.|`|gLzJEX7Daa	I'm sorry to hear you're in such distress about all thats going on at home.  You're parents will always make sure you have a place to live.  Filing bankruptcy is best for finances.  You could live in an apartment or a smaller house, and pay rent - it's often much cheaper than buying a home.  You'll be OK, see if there are counselors at school that you can talk to, so when you do need reassurance or to understand whats going on, you have an adult to ask.     Good luck, I hope everything goes OK for you.|`|xRFLXYDzaa	My parents got divorced when I was 10 and my brother was 6. There really isn't much you can do. You can make them feel better by helping out around the house. Give them hugs when they are sad (it seems like you are close to your mom - I think should would like hugs). If you have siblings, especially younger ones, play with them and keep them company. My brother is my best friend because he was with me when my parents divorced. Stay close to your siblings.     I hope this helped a little.

Sorry but cant really do anything about the divorce|`|LN5nCjNRaa	Well my parents had got a divorce too..My family sounds just like yours. But honestly i'd say to just stick it out and let them handle it. My dad doesn't keep a steady job or pay child support. But my mom files unemployment to pay for our house and bills. Maybe your mother could get help from the state or other family members. My mom has to because she has to live in our house with me my sister and my sister's two children. I hope this helped.

On a biological level, I don't know that anyone could watch it and not become aroused.     I would have a problem if the guy I was with was doing it behind my back, lying about it, addicted to it. If I was going to watch it I would prefer something more artistic and erotic, or something more realistic and not these horribly fake figures built to stroke the male ego that the majority of us women will never attain.|`|tPiYH7KRaa	Generally the cheesy aspect is a total turn off... sometimes it's just a little over the top in a lot of ways.

If you want to really turn on a woman, stimulate her emotions.  That's what does it for me!  Gentle touching, hair stroking, face stroking, firm embraced kisses.  Passionate kisses.  Most women are more turned on watching a "chick flick" than porn because of the emotional stimulation.|`|AA11012822	It's a big turn on for me,the thing I dont really care for is most porn has 2 females together thats a big turn off for me!

It's something you HAVE to do.|`|AA10391352	them y dnt u tell him in his face|`|AA11417930	Tell him to grow up.  Simple.  Let him know if he continues to act like a butthole, then you can show him how you drag him by his nose.  I'd definitely stop his idiotic behavior.  All that sex talk in front of others is dead.  Let him know that, also.  Let him know you have a mouth also.  If he doesn't heed your call, then use your mouth and humiliate him in front of others and let him know how it feels to be treated like a tramp.  He doesn't have the right to treat you like that.  Some things need to be kept between the two of you, but he doesn't understand that yet.  Make him understand.  Good luck.|`|yMlxPJj1aa	u should just tell him the truth.if he keeps on and u feel wrong with him just tell him the truth.

If you believe that she's the one for you then stay in contact with her. Maybe one day she'll realize your the one for her and come back to you. You've gotta keep hope.  Don't let all your feelings out at once, let it out bit by bit but don't rush or overdo it!  Be her friend, the person she'll turn to if she needs help and let her know that you'll always be there for her.    I hope everything turns out the way you want it to, and good luck!
NGDMRWqBaa	usaully girls who have mostly guy friends are cool cause they have more of a guys atitude and not the bs and gossip girls give out. my ex had mostly guy friends. it was cool. +if you don't want her around other guys. it means u are afraid she might do something. gotta have trust to make a relationship work.|`|xNkmK0SHaa	A "girlfriend" who has many male friends is not read for or able to have a committed, exclusive relationship.  She is probably too immature and/or young to know what love is.  This "best guy friend" thing is a lie one tells oneself.  It seems as though it may have spread to you.   You must make your own choices in life, but I would suggest you consider (and maybe even discuss with her) why she needs "guy friends".|`|AA10783670	I have learned over the years that, if it looks like a duck, and quacks like a duck.

zNjACkxpaa	Are you asking about your kids? I suspect he would need to adopt them to become a legal guardian.    So what exactly are you asking?|`|bO2rzfISaa	I would be really cautious about this.  You wouldn't want to have to win custody if the two of you split. I'd wait until I knew him IN the marriage, really well.|`|AN9PdKmgaa	you are your own legal guardian unless you go to court to appoint one|`|AA11788494	No he is not legally.  Contact your local court house.|`|FMfAcAGpaa	I assume you mean for your children.  I would visit with an attorney on this one as state laws greatly vary.  You need a will, too especially when their are minor children to take care of.|`|gC8xO53Oaa	A legal guardian of you? Yes, unless you have appointed possibly your children because of recent health reasons. I'm no attorney, but unless there's a piece of paper that says someone else is considered your guardian, he should be. If you're talking about your children, you are the legal guardian and I think you may have to go through legal process for him to become theirs along with you.
WO4XjSfUaa	i think you should tell her. but 1st think whether or not this relationship will last cause the last thing you wanna do is go out with many guys and your mom either cant keep up or wont like you only having short relationshis. :]    hope this helps.|`|TtxkbLRdaa	Dont tell her

I go for personalty and usually shy girls have the personalty I look for.|`|3opnkGFDaa	well i think it's because shy girls aren't as emasculating as loud girls. it makes them feel more of a man than less of a man.|`|DK6kYxmGaa	I don't think they do, because I'm shy and have never had a boyfriend.

Just act confident and im sure some girls will even think its cute|`|yMtsnwPYaa	no, its not a big deal at all. its makes u who u r and personally i think a little gap is kinda cute!|`|GAxHmzM9aa	As long as it isn't a huge gap, but still if you want to pick up more women then I would consider getting it closed. It is a problem for some girls but not most.    Hope I helped.|`|cSlwSOnPaa	not at all! hopefully you wont find someone shallow enough that that matters to them, its such a minor 'flaw', it shouldn't matter. i know it wouldn't bother me. x don't fret about it :)
Pbsayz4Aaa	she must try to talk on things that he likes,some new topics,,may be ur friend can give her some surprise..say something and  do the other way..u have to search for ways to lighten up things ,,its not all his responsibility..and yeah this phase come in relation i feel but it pass|`|HJEXk7Pmaa	she should fine someone else that isnt boring|`|XLRwtIyWaa	our rltnshp nvr work out.
NyGjQTdvaa	Sex is really important to me in a relationship too, so don't just think that men think that (my very recent ex boyfriend didn't want sex near as much as I did). If he's not willing to let the gal get used to his sexual appetites over time, he's not worth it. Chances are they haven't been in the relationship, or together, long enough to form a committed bond so it should be relatively easy.|`|DCHvyqOGaa	If your having sex be happy! So have the sex and be protected and then get to know him! Or talk about it...
a0b40c7a80dd3de9085039f8daf76ec6aa	This is the question girls have about guys too. Insted of guys put girls in your question.    Girls or older woman think of males all the time. Maybe not so directly, but they are always somewhere in our thoughts. For example, I have a crush on someone and i'm trying to figure him out, what's he thinking, what's he like and even now as i'm answering your question i am thinking about him. so there 24/7|`|B2OYOhIpaa	normally all the time. |`|NoT3WGaEaa	Oh trust me dude you would be surprised how often girls think about guys.|`|5E4t2xqNaa	It depends on the guy.|`|6WWWqc8caa	every second! :)|`|LS8LcuRaaa	yep, all the time....|`|SzQKCeRqaa	A lot.|`|jChbnuafaa	well if i like a boy or think he is attractive     then i think about him quite a bit   what do you think girls do on sleepover talk about other girls NO we talk about boys all the time|`|AA11425983	like 23/7|`|EANeX10Jaa	ALL OF THE TIME    THEIR LIFE'S ARE BASED AROUND US|`|PmNGnHU8aa	all the time thats why they try to busy themselves with other things all the time. answer my newest one?|`|4oeBAHANaa	24/7  when they wake up in the morning thats the firs thing they think about,  all day that's the only thing they want to think about.  and just as they fall asleep it's the last thing to cross their mind.|`|VG2NYjTbaa	it depends if she likes the boy. I don't think about ever guy I see walking around.    but if it's a boy she likes, pretty much 24/7.  :)|`|pDpS2j6Xaa	all the time!|`|VwnsSC4waa	a lot!!! but not all the time|`|xPHyTQlYaa	All the time.|`|1DVZ5LkRaa	I don't think about every guy I see, but I think about the guy I like like almost every minute.

The busier our schedule the less we think about them.|`|HEI2Zx8Haa	Generally, if a girl really likes a guy, she'll think about him A LOT.|`|F6wLGNTHaa	girls think of boys ALL THE TIME.  we dont stop thinking!|`|xRFhWMFSaa	it depends on the girl.

fwpw3kvlaa	I agree with what the others said.  I also think that sometimes feelings hit us before we know it.  I also know a few people who are in situations they never, ever thought they would be open to, much less extremely involved in.  You take a look at a situation and say to yourself that there is NO WAY that I would do this (ie have an affair, sleep with a married man) so sometimes that means your guard is down.  You're not expecting it to happen and when you fall in love with that person, it's hard to remember all the stuff you swore you would never do!!  I'm in this situation and I can tell you that it sucks!!|`|AA10791101	There are plenty so just look around and I am sure ou will find all you Can handle.

Love ya!|`|1b29d63e60af83364795de8f8bad3819aa	Hello....it's very true that sometimes we allow ourselves to care for people who are not responding the way they should.  And we can't control our feelings, but we can control if we let other hurt us and/or how much will they be able to hurt us.  Sorry to hear about you and your wife. But it will be better for you in the long run.   Hope you find a great new love!|`|244be8ebdc9d2370e4adeaec2a892ea9aa	I think we just always want what we can't have.  The grass always looks greener on the other side.  You have to learn to open your self to the right people.  People who are available to you.  Your worth having that, right?  It's all about who you let in.  Your absolutely right, holding on is the worst thing you can do.  The important thing is that you remain open.  We've all been hurt one time or another.  So maybe being interested in people who we know are unavailable is safe.  Otherwise it's just a cycle of being hurt over and over again because we know we can't have them, or they don't want us.  Its just setting your self up for being hurt again.  I'm sorry about your wife.  It must have been hard.  I'm divorced my self, so I've been there.  I was married for 20 years.  Hang in there and keep an open mind and heart.  The right person will come into your life.  She will be open and ready for you also.  It'll happen for you when you least expect it.  Good Luck

b82ybE3gaa	IF I had enough courage i would fart in front of my boyfriend who openly farts in front of me, but I think its icky, and he claims its just him "being a guy" and that girls aren't supposed to do that.    Good question...in an odd way!

Its annoying.|`|CMMRmx9faa	some girls don't fart or burp, they b*tch!!! or they would explode!!!|`|qIwiGY0Caa	Farting has nothing to do with women's rights...

PyC1MIkXaa	Of course it's normal.|`|Kh5o3QCcaa	I kind of went through a phase like this... but it was a mix between friends passing and friends being diagnosed with different cancers.    I admittedly got numb, and only shed a tear at one of the funerals.    I won't claim it's normal, but it's how I coped with it all, and it worked for me.  I felt like I was crying on the inside, it just nothing would come out.  It was an all too large dose of reality all at once.... and there was nothing I could do to stop it.    I feel that I made it safely through the mourning process in the end, but it did bother me too that I couldn't express my emotions 'normally'.  What matters is that all of those around me knew how I felt, and didn't need it to be 'proven' more or less.  This type of grieving also allowed me to present a strong face to those worse affected by these ttragedieswhen they needed it most.    Stay  strong.|`|SsoNkOTZaa	Of course its normal. That's just your body's way of dealing with that much sadness. it will get better with time.

You need ot find a way to let that pain out. College work is what is normal and steady. I honestly haven't experienced exactly what your going through. My only advice is to turn to the one Person that loves you. and that you can turn all your burdens and pain on. Because he loves you more than anybody ever could. He even died for you and rose from the dead. Ha your probably like freaking out right now and everybody that's reading this is like omg she is a freak! But, honestly, i dont care. That man. that died for you. His name is Jesus Christ. GOod luck. And no, your not crazy for feeling numb.|`|hCIAD98Zaa	Well you're hiding your emotions really.  You can't cry because you cried your last tear   or this happen to fast for you to digest .    Why not write all your feelings in a piece of paper   so you can express your emotion instead of keeping   them for you .    Try talking to a close friend of yours.You should   continue focusing on college so you won't think   a lot about what's happening in life .    Hope they rest in peace and that you get better .|`|isg9i7Z4aa	ya its normal u dont have to worry about all these it happens dear..people who are loved by the god taken the earliest atleast u r lucky that u were loved by the poeple hu god loves the most..dont worry ok...now be normal and speak to other people try forgetting evrything and get along with ur life ok...lets their souls rest in peace...

YAWkCPqYaa	hello , you really need to listen to your heart , it will speak volumes for you , good luck to you and your baby|`|PHKSoUTDaa	You don't trust the ex, and you don't love the new one!  Maybe NEITHER fit the bill!|`|C568eIL7aa	just close ur eyes and do what ur heart tells u to do..|`|RdMpPhhPaa	stay with the new one!!!|`|H8tXHWRsaa	What i say is stop seeing the boy and go bk  to your ex because he is the father of your baby. Your family doesn't trust him right, but you do.  Just FOLLOW your HEART. Trust it never fails.|`|wj3hc5SSaa	i feel so sorry for you it must be hard to decide..  in a way i think if your ex has really genuinely changed then maybe it would be good for your baby to have the real dad around since it would make things easier in the future, but i think from the way ur ex treated you was  not acceptable and you don't know for sure if he will ever go back to being the way he was or go on drugs again.. if he does do this the baby will need stability in his life and if you and ur ex break up again your baby might be confused who his/her father figure may be in the future ! if your family dont like him maybe they think you deserve better ! but maybe its a risk you might want to take and things might work out good this time..|`|uroMie3Taa	stay with new one - you started having feelings for your ex because you were looking at photos and it brought those memories/feelings back|`|AA10960571	I think if you want to be with the father of your baby and he is willing to work things out u should.  A young baby needs both of his or her parents.  He may have been acting crazy due to the drugs that he was taking and then he stopped cold turkey.  That has a lot to do with how someones attitude is.  I think you need to have a long talk with both of the mean and let them know how you are feeling if neither understand than that is not who you should be with.  Yeah he is going to be mad that you are with someone else but he messed up.  U guys talking is a good sign that things can get back to the way they were.  Be true to your feelings and yourself.|`|4CkM4UZ5aa	if i were you i would go and have a serious talk with your ex.. talk about your options and how you feel about each other  from my point of view.. it seems like you dont like your new partener enough to have a full relationship. and i wouldnt worry about what your family thinks, i would just concentrate on your babys new family.. and making it as strong as possible :)  its a hard situation to be in.. and some things are easier said then done.. but to be honest i would follow heart over head|`|VRBF8okwaa	ok there are so many answers for you but the best one is do what makes you happy! not what makes your family happy... you are always no matter what going to have feelings for your ex because he is the father of your child. i would say to take your time, think things through, and be careful what you choose to do. you and your ex are separated so what you do and who you talk to is your business. if he asks you then say yes i made a new friend and that is all we were. JUST FRIENDS. if you do plan on getting back with your ex, you, him and your family should all sit down and talk and let him and your family know what is going on and how it is going to be! good luck!
AA10395956	Cookies or a long romantic kiss :D
o88qLRgbaa	If that is her personality and you don't like it, then its not going to work, and don't you dare try to change her to fit your life.  We women are not modeling clay.|`|tjFcfI9Aaa	well it sounds like your too ...how can i put this ...you dont sound like you have a sense of humor..just try to be a bit on the laughing side of her|`|C9BctAMQaa	Dude i have basically the same problem as you. Tell her this "Baby im sorry but you really need to act more mature or this isnt gonna work, we are both adults so i think we should both act like them" It worked for me|`|E6T9DPT9aa	How about writing her a letter about how you feel? This will open her eyes as to what she is doing wrong. Sometimes it is very oblivious to women when we are frustrating out partners. We need to be told, to change.    All my best (:  E-mail me if you want to know anything else (:|`|b7246aa9c54ecf3cf12beff32046d863aa	talk to her and guide her in every aspect of life like a real man. nobody is perfect. i think yu probably have some negative sides too. are you perfect  ? are you everythign that a woman can imagine ? if you were perfect then you wouldn't have such a problem because you would already approach the subject as a perfect adult. okay, now don't accuse her and see what you can do for your relationship.    we learn lots of things from each other in a relationship and sometimes it just requires effort for each other. if you like her, i think you will find a way to make her feel more secure about your relationship. the problems of women are usually because of emotional insecurities, because the men hurt them without knowing that and women find themselves dealing with lots of dissapoitnments, insecurities and worries about men, relationships and sex. you need to make her feel comfortable, loved, cared and secure. it will take a little effort, but it will worth to win her heart.|`|I7qHLCQqaa	Conniving how so? As far as things around the house go, the likely explanation is that she was raised differently then you were, perhaps her parents or guardians did not emphasize cleaning etc.   People that are emotional, as you describe, tend to be thinkers. It is a trait that has been noticed for hundreds of years.    Unfortunately, the way she converses is a reflection of mental and emotional dispositions, and those things cannot be changed or adulterated. Hate to say, but she is not going to change, and I think you know that.     The problem in bed is not to be taken lightheartedly. Sexual miscommunication or a lack of mutual understanding regarding what the two of you fundamentally see as worthy of arousal is a huge problem. You have no other choice but to actually confront her about it, and the two of you will have to compromise and youll have to do things she likes and she will have to do things you like.     There are two ways to view things macroscopically: 1. the two of you are, generally, a good couple and have relative chemistry and all the things you are describing are natural particularities. 2. the two of you are somewhat compatible, but not enough, and thus the particularities that you notice symbolize whats later to come, that is, relative dissatisfaction.     I say the best thing to do is just offer open communication with the subject at hand, there is no way to implicitly suggest for things to change.|`|v4bvtHDxaa	I do think you should go to counseling.  I think it would say a lot if she refuses to go.    First, you are a great man.  From what you've written, I can tell you really care.  Most of all, you have a lot of respect for yourself and your girlfriend.  That's a wonderful combo.    Second, two things concern me the most: use of the word conniving and outlook towards sex.  Do you think she's basically manipulating you in terms of her outlook towards sex?  Will she not even go anywhere you want to go, so to speak?    Lastly, everyone brings their own garbage into a relationship.  It's all how you deal with it that matters:)|`|AA11602839	Good luck with that one. She seems very bitter. You may not be able to break this one. Good luck. If she's worth it, stick it out.|`|BxERyZUraa	BREAK UP WITH HER!|`|mO1yXCasaa	If you love her then you'll deal. There's nothing wrong with having a sit down with her and- why are you asking the internet ppl?|`|L4QhCMcSaa	Baby im sorry but you really need to act more mature or this isnt gonna work, we are both adults so i think we should both act like them"    i think that would work

LHYdU3XDaa	I really think that if you are the sweetheart that you say you are and if she is as well that it wouldn't hurt to talk to her about seeing each other. Sometimes the girls that are really hard to talk to, maybe because there too pretty or whatever are the bestfriends that you'll find. And truly you'll never know until you ask! And if she not interested she'll let you know gently. Most girls that i know don't refuse a traditional type first date. Start out as friends. Friends, true friends can make it though just about anything! Good luck! I hope that I helped you a little!|`|636h7oEyaa	Wow, I'm going through the same thing.

qDpFSqn4aa	Easy, you're not a kissing person.  There are a lot of people like this.  I'm kind of one of them.  I love my wife with all my heart but I'm just not a kisser.  I say go along with the kissing, you might like it better in time but don't be put off if you're not a kisser just tell your guy this up front so he doesn't get down hearted.  Reinforce your love for him all the time and reassure him that all the time you're telling him about your kissing problem.  Communication is the key in every good relationship and there's no time like the present to start.    I really hope this helps.|`|GuA9zI3haa	well.... maybe he's a bad kisser?|`|ezI5HwRWaa	You might just be one of those people who doesn't like kissing and doesn't get anything from it.     If you've kissed other guys before him and you've felt something with them, then maybe it's just the way you two are kissing. Keep working on it and trying new ways.|`|O4VrWvoQaa	i have been with my boyfriend for nearly 2 years now and every time he kisses me or i kiss him i still get butterflies... not as much as i did when i 1st got with him but i do still get that little flip in my stomach... maybe u just dont like kissing.... all people are different and have different prefernces. If you know u love him and he makes u happy and smile then whats the problem. :)|`|98SORVOwaa	Maybe your just not into it.. no biggie
ppuqLBMBaa	for now if she is going through hard times you should really comfort her...tell her how much you love being with her and that she is your best friend and that you cant live without her...maybe once the hard times are over get a little closer and tell her you like her but for now just to be the friend she needs...im going through tough times myself since my parents are getting a divorce and if it is anything like that just let her talk it out and let HER come to YOU|`|KhVyci6kaa	aw, she kinda reminds me of me.   okay well if she is a lot closer to you than any other guy than there's one thing you don't have to worry about it is that she doesn't like any other guy more than she likes you. one day just take her out to eat or plan out a really nice elegant date saying we're gonna hangout, dazzle her off her feet and than ask her out. if that doesn't work than make her jealous. because trust me it works. no matter how much she hates relationships it will work because she will eventually miss her best friend.
AA10153736	Well your kind of screwed I've had friends go through the similiar situation Heck I would of had to go through the same thing if my ex's parents didn't love me and think I was what was best for their daughter. The only thing I can suggest is having your boyfriend show your parents that he's what's best for you otherwise you'll never see the light of day becuase you'll always be grounded. A friend of mine went through the same situation where his girlfriends parents told her that once he turned 18 they couldn't see each other any more and if they did she'd be grounded and that' exactly what happened. I mean legaly I don't think they can do anything other than ground you unless you two have sex. Also if you two have sex make sure it's before he turns 18.  I had a friend who his girlfriends parent tried to sue him for haveing sex with there daughter and he got off because of some crazy thing about them having sex and dating before he was 18 or something like that. The easiest way is to have your boyfriend some how show them he is what's best for you. I was dating a 15 yr old when I was 17 and when I turned 18 the parent never had a problem with it becuase they loved me and thought I was great for their daughter. Heck I even had her mother tell me she was worried if her daughter and I ever broke up I would have ruined her for any other guy because I was such a great boyfriend and guy. I did like 1k worht of work on her fathers car and that made him like me just make your boyfriend show them he is wha'ts best. Also an extreme route you can take is tell your dad fine you wont see him any more but you wont do any school work you will flunk all your classes and since you wont have the grades you will not get into a college. If you really love him don't let him go I did that once and I still regret it every minute and it's been over 2 years I still remember everything about her.|`|3a682bd2b6dcc9c1c2090e64d3624112aa	My dad is the same way!  Well, my advice is tell them that you don't know if you'd ever be the same without him.  Try to work their emotions and hearts when explaining your situation and your feelings.  Maybe even cry a little.  If your parents really care about you, they'll let you trust your heart and your judgement.  (Use the "if you really love me.." card).  With some tears.  Eh.  Good luck    (and i agree with joseph7, your parents don't trust teenage hormones, and you'll most likely met someone better or something, but that's not what you're asking for) so do what you feel is best, but don't regret anything years from now.  things change & people change.|`|J7mSnQPpaa	Believe it or not, they KNOW whats best for you and thats for you to learn patience and wait until AFTER you get an education and can work and support yourself IF the need arises.Lets say your b/f gets a goood job at 18, they let you marry, you have 3 kids and he dies but the life insurance barely covers the cost of the funeral (many other bad scenarios), how would you support 3 kids?You couldnt.You CAN live without him, you did for 14 yrs before dating him.You can wait another 4 yrs, if its true love you will be with him again when you turn 18.Your parents are smart enought to know the dangers of trusting teenage hormones.They arent going to take the risk.|`|AA12317258	... :( im sorry. my boyfriend is gonna be 18 in may, and im only 15... just turned. i understand how you're feeling. you have to understand that your boyfriend will be an ADULT soon. your parents just dont want you getting hurt.|`|AA10922989	Yea he sounds like a great guy who truely respects and cares for you. Just like you've descibed him, and toldus how he respects you and all. Tell your parents that. Talk to them, show them that you are responsible enough to be withan older guy. Hope my advice helps|`|AA10742214	I understand how badly you don't want to listen to your dad and stay with him. But you both are still very very young. Your dad only wants whats best for you and he sees your relationship from a different perspective. He's looking at years from now and seeing the consequences. You should listen to your dad and wait until you are older before you consider marrying him. Although the not letting you see him anymore is kind of harsh. You should tell your dad that you understand what he is trying to do but that he shouldn't keep you from someone who is practically your life. Tell your dad that you promise not to marry or anything else serious but to just let you still see and talk to him.    Hope I help! =]|`|79021a61b2485597895a8b7c76eff4c4aa	OMG THATS SOO GAY! HES GONNA BE NO DIFFERENT! HES STILL GONNA BE THE SAME. I WOULD BE LYK SCREW U DAD IM GOING OUT WITH HIM! OR RUN AWAY TO VEGAS BABYYY!!|`|RyXku4NUaa	There is no advice on convincing your parents he is best.  Sometimes parents know more than kids give them credit for (and sometimes less).  In this case, they're just looking out for you.  At fourteen, you should not be dating a legal adult.|`|xcJwxyRRaa	What's the hurry...slow is go in my book and obviously Dads. Dad is a smart and wise man, respect him and you will go far and all will be fine. It seems the bf is respecting you and Dad so far..go with it....might be the best thing you ever had to wait for in your long wonderful life..  and you have the rest of your best years ahead of you...as you know bc you sound as if you are also very wise and smart like your hero; your daddy..

Prepara tu el desayuno, piensa que almorzar sin que ella cocine, tal vez comprar la comida, luego salir por la tarde a pasear o ir al cine, para terminar cenando en algn restaurante a la luz de la velas. Regalarle algn anillo o pulsera o collar de valor. O si no cuentas con suficiente dinero, puedes hacer lo mismo solo que elige algn regalo mas barato como un pulover, o prenda de vestir.   Dile sobre todo que la amas y que siempre la amaras. Y que tu vida cambio para mejor desde que la conociste, dile que la amas, pero mejor es demostrrselo con lo que te he dicho.

Te recomiendo que ese da de la cena tengas desconectados telefonos, fijos, celulares, localizadores o cualquier aparato que los puedan distraer. Avisale a todo mundo que esa noche NO EXISTEN PARA NADIE...!!!    Creo que con esto la hars sentir como lo que es: Tu esposa y una persona especial y unica.

Lo que puedes hacer es que seas tu mismo, no trates de impresionarla en exceso porque se va a dar cuenta, se honesto y sincero, cero hipocrecias, a las damas les choca que uno este hablando nada mas de uno mismo, escuchala, dejala que hable de lo que ella quiera y en base a eso tu expresa lo que sientes; tratala de la manera mas natural que puedas, piensa que es una persona mas, que no hay intereses de ninguna especie; hablale de lo que a ella le gusta hablar y expresa lo que tu sientes de ese tema en concreto; has de cuenta que estas dando una conferencia de algun tema en especifico y desarrollalo.    Las mujeres son los seres mas divinos y hermosos que Dios ha creado, pero tambien los mas complicados de entender y comprender, lo unico que nos queda a los hombres es amarlas, cuidarlas, comprenderlas y consentirlas.    Saludos y exito...!
8J0yYwUdaa	Si exactamente, cuando conoces a una persona de la cual te enamoras o simplemente te simpatiza no es por verle el pene o la vagina, sencillamente es porque te gusta su fsico, su forma de ser, tal vez su cuerpo, pero no lo que no tienes a la vista, y sabes que pienso, finalmente las dos cosillas esas sirven para lo mismo, y como siempre digo, solo hay que saberlo usar.|`|4b8433fd5196e3c86ab3c21b6bcb8741aa	Creo que es tomar muy a la ligera un tema tan complejo .  Creo que dentro de todo , las personas buscan ser queridas y amadas , pero es que muchas veces , las ideas que les inculcan son vanas y prejuiciosas .  Creo que cuando la sociedad acepte hablar de la sexualidad de manera abierta , algunas de las penas que nos acompa?an , iran desapareciendo .  Creo que para ello hace falta tiempo , y un cambio muy grande , pero no esta todo perdido .  Esto sonara a discurso de hace 50 a?os atras , pero en verdad es que todabia no alcanzamos una aceptacion para hablar de la sexualidad .  O acaso hace falta nombrar alguno de ellos , como la homosexualidad , el adulterio , la curiosidad  sexual cada ves tan precoz en los adolcetenes de hoy en dia .  Son todos temas dificiles , que aunque se este estudiando y tratando de debatirlo de manera abierta , todabia hay muchas normas morales y eticas que lo impiden .    Saludos .|`|XQRgmoLAaa	EN LO DE LA VIGINIDAD ESTOY DE ACUERDO Y EN LO DEL TAMA?O NO...SOY MUJER Y DEFINITIVAMENTE NO.|`|1e5e770f583f8bf7d60243fb178705b8aa	Mi querido amigo....    ? Tienes toda la razn...!!!!!       Lo que importa es quienes somos y como somos, no que tenemos, que no tenemos o que nos sobra o nos falta. Se trata de sentimientos.        en cuanto al aspecto sexual el tama?o del miembro o la virginidad no importan, lo que realmente importa es el sentimiento, la intencin y como hagas el amor, es nada ms como actuas o tratas a tu pareja. Puedes llegar a tener un orgasmo sin necesidad de una penetracin fisica.      Recuerden que el organo sexual ms potente, activo y desarrollado es el cerebro.    Bueno... eso digo yo..!|`|nXxVILRnaa	Me parece que tens poca experiencia, eh.  El tama?o es fundamental para ellas ms que para nosotros. Pero nos deja ms satisfechos. La virginidad es otro asunto.  muchos piensan. Por qu casarse con alguien que hasta pudo haber sido prosti.  Podr ser ridculo, pero la falta de virginidad de una mujer ha divorciado ms parejas de lo que imaginan. Es algo como recuerdo que no muchos hombres superan en su vida.

Entiendo que algunos hombres, cada dia menos creo yo, consideran a la virginidad como simbolo de pureza y dignidad, pero esa es un criterio machista que solo cabe en la cabeza de alguien con horizontes mentales muy limitados.  No se debe valorar a la mujer por la condicin que guarda su himen, no crees?.|`|7Gg5pHvoaa	porke es una forma en la que nostros podemos  decir que fuimos los primeros en quitarle algo  muy importante a una mujer...  es algo que nos hace sentir bien exaltados!!!!|`|wyQi8Mbraa	la sensacion de desvirgar a una chica(que sea grande ya) eso nos pone a 100,introducir tu pene en una vagina limpia donde ningun otro pene ha sido metido jeje se que lo explico de una manera rara pero no se como explicarlo de otra forma xD|`|skyL5YjVaa	buenos me parece k es una vieja cuestion machista; solo trata d pensar esto..... cuando compras algo esperas k sea nuevo no??.podria se consideerado como algo parecido,  ademas de considerar k la mayoria d los hombres somos muy territoriales; y lo nuestro keremos k sea solo d nosotros y nadie mas lo disfrute.   ademas la sensacion al momento de la penetracion es muy distinta al hacerlo con una mujer virgen, k con una k no lo es..  a mi punto d vista la mujer no tiene ni mas ni menor valor por ser virgen o no.  lo k importa son sun valores morales y su intelecto. y claro tambien su fisico

Hrv3Tu8taa	You have to decide that for yourself. Which one makes you happier? Which one are you more comfortable around? Think about why you like each one.

But asking people here isn't going to help. We don't know how you REALLY feel about these guys. Think it over when your alone and think of everything you like about each of them. Then ask yourself who you can see yourself best with. But remember only YOU can decide, no one else|`|3H9k7tN5aa	We can't decide that.|`|L4QhCMcSaa	go for the one you think of the most!
aez7WCqQaa	Thats so creepy. I was dealing with the same thing, cept I didn't go to a party.    He probably talked to her to see if you're interested in him, or if you're just leaning towards being friends. Confront him, maybe make the move.    We can't always be shy, can we??|`|5tS24cb6aa	umm hello? is this dominos pizza|`|mdtkor2Paa	no|`|z9Ard2Daaa	Tell him how you feel! If you don't you might lose him! He might have talked to the other girl about it because he is just as confused as you are and he needed someone to talk to. The best thing to do is show him how much me means to you!|`|438798fdaa5483e8c6fa84449c2a25f4aa	communication is the key to most problems. no matter if it hurts you must talk about things. how are you going to solve your problem without discussing it. good luck    bubba|`|AA11441704	unless you talk, u never know|`|GMNKQxPraa	Are you an Asda Ace?
AA10059574	You could trust him OR you could call her and ask her who she is. Tell her the number came up on your bf's phone and you were making sure he didn't miss an important phone call.|`|BPJLHKRJaa	confront him. Beat the **** out of her. I swear U need to do that. You should start talkin to a guy and let him find out secretly..|`|0cc18a2d8ee588096040fb954ca5a550aa	Be honest and ask him. If you call her and try to figure out who she is, and it turns out to be just a friend.. then you'll be in the hot seat for not trusting him. Don't do anything "to" her. Just ask him what's up.|`|AA10775298	If your talking about a cellphone, take out his *sim card* and replace another one in it, do this for about 2 days MAX, place his sim card into your cell phone and message the chick pretending to be him.  Confront your boy. If he looks like he is lying kick him to the curb girl, as for her, phone her and tell her she is welcome to him.  ( gave this advice to a gurl friend of mine and it worked a treat )|`|LHYdU3XDaa	You need to check yourself! Are you doing anything? And if you can't trust him after that time period maybe you shouldn't even be together! Yeah I would ask him some questions but are you going to believe what he says? If not you should do some looking into it before you go crazy about it! It could be something about you and him! Take it easy before you jump to conclusions!
h0wDABGbaa	hey, ive had the same experience. but i got over the guy.  anyway, the tip that i would give you is that stop being hard to get. you might think guys like it but they dont. be friendly and open up. if you dont wanna be the one that approaches to him then give him a reason to approach to you. i know its easier said than done, but have a go at it. good luck!|`|LPtUJ5p5aa	Here is a tip for you, you are getting this earlier in life than most girls do, and hopefully this puts things into better perspective for you.    Hard to get = impossible to get for a guy. We don't get hints. When guys are around guys, they say what they mean, and mean what they say, there is no "hinting" or underlying message.    Girls seem to communicate in a series of hints and riddles, that we have to try and figure out.    It has happened to me before, a girl plays hard to get, and I just assume she isnt interested, try being a little more upfront with him, dont play hard to get so much, just be straight with him, have fun, be flirty, smile and laugh, he will come around if he is interested in you.    Good luck!|`|CUc2gqzjaa	maybe you played TOO hard to get, so its to late you already did screw up, move on :/ sorry
b32e560414238926779c6d2630e98a48aa	i think it would be better to talk to a professional . They will know what steps to take. You should speak to a psychiatrist or a councilor. Its not good to hold in all that pain, and try not to feel guilty for the way you reacted at first, its not your fault. Infact denial normally comes first, you would be surprised to know that alot of people deny the truth because they don't want it to be real. but surely you can not hold this in or it will distroy you, ruining your life in other ways.So... you NEED to talk to a professional and your mom. im sorry this happened to you, you'll be okay though, keep your chin up.|`|klhFMdCgaa	Oh my God, you have to charge your dad with child sexual abuse. That is not healthy. You have to tell someone besides the anonymous people online. You have to tell your mom, and apologize to your sister for not supporting her. Get her to testify with you. Get help, dude!|`|2L8fvUbeaa	You need to tell your mom! It could get worse. What if he decides to go further next time? and actually rapes you? This is very serious and something needs to be done about it. What if he finds a girlfriend with a daughter and does the same, or worse, to her? And he beat the crap out of you! Did you and your mom file charges? You need to do that too! This is a seriously sick man and he needs to be punished for hurting you and your sister....before he does it again!    TELL YOUR MOM!!!|`|BqrQFLH5aa	honey, that is horrible. and i get how you don't want to ruin his life but he's ruining yours. you should tell your mom at the very least. find a quiet moment, first of all admit that you lied about your sister... just don't put up with this. you have to tell someone. you do not have to live with this abuse, and if your parents are divorced maybe the least you can do is live with your mom. girl, you need help, and getting it online isn't how. you need to tell your mom or an adult you trust, like a grandparent or someone like that. and don't stay around him. you need to cut him out of your life at least until things change. |`|kqMuhsnJaa	i wud hav told u not 2 bring it online...but u wanted help. i think u shud tell it to ur mom. really. this can get worse. OR talk 2 anyone u feel really close 2 (exept ur friends) If it works pls send me a msg!|`|AA12037505	Say to your daddy that GOD don't like what he is doing so stop.Do not think that what he is doing is your fault it is not.If no one beliveve you at hone tell someone like a teach,the cops or a neighbor.And pray that GOD for help.|`|y0m9t0Adaa	I'm so sorry you're going through this.  I think you need to tell someone.  If you don't feel you can talk to your mom, find someone else you can trust.  Maybe after telling them, they'd be willing to go with you, as a support, to tell your mom.  You are not to blame here!!  Just because you denied it in the past, does not mean you can't be trusted.  It means you're scared.  Please, talk to someone.  If your friends are true friends, they are not going to leave you.  They will help you ... the same with your boyfriend.  Do not be scared ... You don't deserve this.  What your dad is doing is wrong ... get some help!|`|FGPb5YxQaa	Please please please speak to an adult that you trust and tell them what has been going on.  I am so sorry to hear what you have had to go through but it is so terribly important that you seek help immediately. This matter can be dealt with in private and it won't be broadcast so don't feel scared about talking to someone about it.  What he has done to you is wrong, full stop.  This cannot continue so please tell a trusted adult who can support you and seek advice and help for you.  Be brave, trust that you're doing the right thing...because you are!
b9adbb0032ac47f277d0127da4ceff15aa	Hola locox    Realmente no se que este pasando pero yo creo que antes no habia tantos divorcios porque antes la mujer "tenia" que estar con su esposo aunque ste le pegara, le fuera infiel o le hiciera cualquier cosa, la mujer no podia decir no o dejar al marido porque "que dira la gente", pero ahora ya no es asi, tanto la mujer como el hombre tenemos derecho a ser respetados, si no lo somos pues nos separamos, pero de igual manera tambin es porque no somos capaces de ser tolerantes ante nuestra pareja, cualquier pleito y ya nos queremos separar, tal vez no entendemos que casarnos no es solamente para no estar solos y vivir con alguien mas, sino que al casarte estas aceptando que tendras nuevas responsabilidades y derechos y que tambin lo estas haciendo con la persona que realmente quieres, persona que aceptas principalmente con sus defectos.  Para mi esas dos cosas son factores importantes en los divorcios: 1. Machismo y 2. Tolerancia y respeto.  Saludos|`|5b6f7c40aaf41ba095c9eab2bcc0d2bdaa	En primer lugar no es solo en Mxico que pasa esto. Pasa tambin a Chipre y a muchos pases. Y en segunto lugar creo que eso pasa porque las parejas se casan por inters, por bronca, por obligacines, por embarazos inesperados, o parejas que son enamoradas se casan por prisa... Por eso hay tantos divorcios...porque la gente no se casa por amor como antes... Tambin porque los familiares de la pareja muchas veces se meten en su matrimonio y hacen la vida imposible a la pareja o al uno de los dos...porque no quieren su pareja qu s yo... Las parejas que se casan por verdadero amor y sus familiares no se meten, no se separan pero son pocas. Desgraciadamente...|`|a2c22536cd5bda250cdd4cf4c38b5385aa	es simple es puro egoismo de ambas partes pero por desgracia es mas en los hombres creo yo saludos|`|BfHRrwT2aa	por nuestros actos torpes,por la suciedad perdon sociedad que todo ya lo ve tan normal por que la humanidad esta transformando al mundo en algo cruel...por todo eso estimado yahoose......saludos|`|hgLwEV3Taa	segun mis abuelos y tios mayores disen que antes no era haci pero ahora en haci en todas partes del mundo   cada ves se convibe peor ,la verdad no es fasil la convivencia pero cada dia ahora es pero los problemas de dinero influyen mucho en los matrimonios y tanta dicucion temina con la pareja|`|bQj8k1QMaa	as es,pero no solo es en Mxico,en todas partes,tal vez ya ponemos el matrimonio ala ligera y ya no le damos la importancia,tal vez porque ya no nos guiamos por los sentimientos,vivimos tan rpido hoy en da que no nos paramos a pensar  que pasa,yo me separ de mi esposo a penas hace 2 meses,por infidelidad,son muchas cosas hoy en da si no funciona la separacion es lo practico,no estoy de acuerdo..suerte|`|addff6854dd10ff8b0835045bc0f136faa	No era as antes habia valores y temor a Dios como se dice, ahora, no hay valores y nos importa poco lo que pase adems ya no somos dejados(as) Ahora ya nos ponemos al brinco cuando hay infidelidades, traiciones, golpes etc.... y antes las mujeres aguantaban ms por el temor y por que como lo voy a dejar por mis hijos, es mi marido lo tengo que aguantar y miles de frases ahora.... ya todo es distinto.|`|1e5e770f583f8bf7d60243fb178705b8aa	Por tanta globalizacin.....

La principal es la prdida de nuestros valores mexicanos: la fidelidad a lo que hacemos y creemos, la importancia y respeto de la mujer en nuestra sociedad (al matriarcado mexicano), tanto por los hombres como por las mismsimas mujeres. La inercia social nos est llevando a ser cmodos y aplicar la ley del menor esfuerzo. Es ms fcil destruir que construir. A los hombres nos falta valor para reconocer nuestros errores y corregirlos. Las mujeres pierden su dignidad con la bandera del feminismo. Lo anterior minimiza el valor del matrimonio, y de muchas otras cosas ms.|`|ztviuqLyaa	Porque la gente no es del todo responsable al tomar una decisin as, se casan porque sue?an con una fiesta, o porque hace tiempo que estan de novio, o porque no se cuidan y tienen hijos, o porque hay que casarse, queda bien. No dimensionan lla magnitud de la decisin que toman.|`|U7w2yLJtaa	Hola   La  causa principal es por falta de AMOR y al faltar tan importante sentimiento tambien comienza la falta de comunicacion y confianza para poder decirnos lo que nos agrada y molesta de nuestra pareja y tambien por falta de comprencion por que empezamos aver a nuestra pareja como alguien al que podemos exigir que se nos agan las cosas y no la vemos como la pareja que algun dia prometimos protegerla y ayudar en lo compromisos del matrimonio.  Lo que yo te aconsejaria que platicaras con todos esos matrimonios y les dijeras que recordaran por que se unieron y se perdonaran todo lo malo que ha pasado en sus vidas y continuaran y se dieran otra oportunidad por que todos nos merecemos esa segunda o tercera oportunidad.   Recuerda que DIOS vino y dio su vida por nosotros y aun que fue maltratado, humillado y crucificado el nos perdono y mas aun nos promete una vida eterna en presencia de EL.  DIOS te de sabiduria yentendimiento para poder ayudar y aconsejar para que no haya mas divorcios en este mundo.|`|90699b6af3de2ca7e0311816579ae695aa	Acredito que seja devido a m forma??o dos namoros que come?am numa estrutura de paix?o que logo acaba e depois casamento  como uma joia que precisa ser labidada e para isto a pedra preciosa sofre bastante mas depois fica linda com a lapda??o.

aOBmcGAZaa	You just asked this....    The only person who can really tell you if it's too soon is you. If you still have hangups over your other fiance, dating at this stage is doomed to fail. If you don't, then go for it. But remember to be honest with yourself. You might just be expeirencing that whole new person euphoria, after that goes away, will this other guy still have a chance with you, or will post relationship hangups and guilt set in?    You have to make that call, we can't.|`|kQA7SbY9aa	You can go out as friends, but don't start planning to replace your ex-fiance just yet. You are comparing the new guy to your ex...I think that's a sign that maybe it is too soon for a new relationship. Wait a while for the ex to be 'out of your system' before you get involved with someone else.|`|0ky4TktEaa	That all depends. Are you over your ex? In other words, make sure this isn't the rebound guy if you want to give him a fair chance. If you're done with your ex for sure, then by all means go for it. He sounds like a wonderful guy; especially since he adores your son.|`|OQF6x5CDaa	be CAREFUL!!

People should not care on how you may live your life. IT IS YOUR LIFE, after all, right? It is not too early for this to happen. Your friend might just looking for the right time to show his feelings for you - and not to mention, his concern for your kid. BUT... It MIGHT be too early for you to fall in love with this guy. What I mean is that, you just broke up with your ex-fiance. All I can advice is that you take your time. Nothing to rush, really. Just follow your heart AND your mind. A right decision comes from a harmonious understanding between the heart and the mind.    I wish you all the happiness!    P.S. Don't really get use to compliments. They wear out after some time. Believe me. :-)
f1734c79346c98e938e588703c7ac31faa	I think that being hit on by a man is a complement but that doesn't make you like the man more. So, if you're thinking about hitting on a woman, just don't do it.

It's obviously a big blessing from God and different than just a typical "more than friends" situation - in this case, take your time because it's a big risk putting your close relationship to the next level as far a romantic one...take your time and just value what you guys have...if you really love someone and they feel the same way, it'll just happen :) Good luck and i REALLY hope things will work out with you guys in the near or far future|`|b819707f13385bf4c86b70445289cf03aa	you won't be anyhing more if you keep on getting mushy and needy. What you gotta do is stop telling her that you have feelings for her.    Be warned though after you guys become more than frtiends things won't be the way rhey used of you guys break up    Now, what you gotta do is start teasing her and stop geing nice all the time. I mean, you gotta make her laugh, bust on her and act cocky and confident yourself    All these things above trigger attraction in a woman and that what you gotta start doing|`|QkW3DZUnaa	then be bf/gf! take things to the next lvl. the next time you see her, bring her a box of chocolates or a flower and tell her you want to be her bf =)

Someone who sees the best in you.     If you were lucky enough to grow up with healthy parents, you have experienced the feeling of having someone who has always looked at your good qualities. Many of us missed that experience. You will be a lucky person if you have found a mate who is always looking at your 'silver lining'. Too often today people are more than willing to judge you by your errors, not by your potential.     2. Someone who gives you the benefit of the doubt.     There are so many times in your life when you need that little edge, that little opportunity to take just that extra step. It can seem as if your efforts are going nowhere and although you want to keep moving forward, there are so many negatives staring you in the face. That person who knows things could go either way for you but takes that leap to believe you will make it is the person who is more valuable to you than gold.     3. Someone who watches over you.     You need a guardian angel who is there, waiting to catch you if you fall, ready to help you when you stumble, ready to pave the way for you when you cannot get moving. There are people who love you who do just that. There are people who do not make a big deal out of saving your bacon. Do you know who they are?     4. Someone to watch you back.     You never know these days who is waiting to catch you off guard, to make sure you don't do well, to sabotage your efforts. You like to think that people will rejoice when you     do well. Many don't. If someone 'has your back' and runs interference for you when you are trying to run the gauntlet through life, give that person a big 'thanks' plus lots of your attention.     5. The person who tells you we all make mistakes.     You hate to be around that judgemental, harsh person who reminds you, 'I told you so', when things so south. You don't need anyone else telling you what you already know. On the other hand there are people who just let you know that the only way any of us learn is through experience. When you have really ended up in the dumper and blew it, stay close to the one who knows that the person who hasn't done anything wrong hasn't done anything much.     6. The person who gives you advice from the heart, not from the head.     When the situation gets rough and some big decisions need to be made, it's fine to have people outline the pros and cons of a problem and give you 'head' answers. But if you need a nudge sometimes to tip the scales, you always listen to this person who knows you must do what will let you live with yourself and have self respect.     7. The person who won't be the 'yes man' who agrees with you     No one who loves you is going to give you the green light and tell you to let er rip if it's clearly going to be bad for you. It's sad that often you surround yourself with people who tell you what you want to hear. The one who loves you will tell you to get help for a drinking or drugging problem, to stop the extramarital affair, and to be a good and decent person.     8. Someone who tells you to knock back, smell the roses, and enjoy life part of the time.     If you are a person who is a real performer and doer, there are likely to be people around you who enjoy the fruits of your labor and want you to do even more. Sometimes you may even see yourself as only valuable when you are giving, doing, and performing. Listen to the person who tells you that life is short and you need breaks and some R&R. That is the person who is looking out for you and your health.     9. The one who smiles at you and means it.     The person who loves you looks at you with eyes that smile and mean it. Too many people give you that slick smile, that quick pat on the back, and then forget that you even exist.     The eyes are the windows of our soul and you can read into a person's smile if it is saying, 'You are a fine person and I want to be with you as long as possible'. Don't fall for any phony smile that attracts you off in another direction, only to leave you stranded and alone.     10. Someone who sees you as beautiful, inside and out.     You know you aren't perfect. There are only too many examples of you looking around and thinking that you have flaws and aren't like the people on television. The person who loves you sees you through eyes of acceptance with no conditions. As you gain a few pounds and your hair gets thin, the person who sees you as attractive, inviting, and appealing is the person who loves you all the way, no strings or demands.     Nowadays, it's really important to know who loves you. Everything in our society is throw away, and many people have carried that over into the most important relationships in their lives. Think hard and look carefully. People who love you , like comfortable clothes, are easy on the heart, mind, and soul.|`|d43d5a707d38cbcfb48a7cb5151c7f12aa	He likes you,and you don't need to do anything,but be yourself,if he starts throwing things at you in class,.....its the real deal.|`|67466c78d63c531282edf12f30416892aa	um if ur not even sure dat he likes u, den y even ask if he loves u? lol..well um iono.. if ur female intuition is tellin u dat he DO likes u, den go head, give it a achance, tell him. wat u got to lose? but da female's intuitions are not always rite, lol..
AA11125121	If you're old enough to drive (or have a parent or friend who doesn't mind playing chaufer) then there are about a million places you can go.  - the movies  - dinner  - lazer tag  - bowling  - the park  - a playground  - the mall  - the skatepark    find out what your date likes to do in their free time and do that or introduce her to something they've never done before that you have.|`|13ea391090eedb47043ae58959d4152eaa	the classics are always the best!!!! a move and popcorn... (secretly go on the web and read the movie reviews, to see if there is a romantic twist to the movie, and then take her to that movie!) it works every time, as long as you dont do that over and over again... and when you and ur g/f r in the theatre, and the romantic part comes on put ur arm around her! we LOVE that stuff!!!!!!    also if a carnival or fair is in town... perfect opportunity for a ferris wheel kiss... *ahhhh* just make sure ur G/F is ready if its a first date... NEVER COME ON TOO STRONG!!! also get a soda or cotton candy to share, that way things dont get too boring!    also a trip to a picture booth isnt a bad idea either... ; ) ... and if you have been going out 4 a while... try on the last pic, to kiss her... *ahhhhhh*     or if you have the money and the time... go to a concert for her favorite band... (I DO NOT RECCOMEND THIS FOR ANYWHERE NEAR A FIRST DATE!!!) and when they play a slow romantic song... lean in and take the kiss, or hold hands... ur choice!!!|`|81968c428709b51f9312fd8cf15c6df6aa	I like going to the movies and to the mall|`|c9d048a869dabc42f6b7935bfcecf40faa	to the mall or skating rink or Wally world(WalMart) or even just out wlking around|`|9dd7224885319cb49ef6caed28427c6aaa	Um...I guess you can just 'hang out' and go to different places: Get something to eat, maybe ice cream or pizza or whatever.

Kh5o3QCcaa	Of course she's still talking about you, it's still a fresh break up.  It takes time to change your routine, and habits of thought.  If you felt great with-out her, it's time to leave it be.  If you did the breaking-up, and you're still trying to contact her, that's only going to add injury to insult.  It's sort of saying "Here I am, and I don't want you, but I will let you be my friend."    To me it always hurt more to be a friend while the wounds were still fresh.  I'd say let her go, I am sure you have plenty of other friends or are capable of making new friends.  Don't hurt her more if you don't need to.... it would be rather selfish.|`|L4QhCMcSaa	if you love her keep going for her!  if its strong enough!|`|3rIvKCu6aa	you should eat her , so that you can have you with you all the time ... IN YOUR STOMACH (: just kidding, tell her you JUST wanna be friends.|`|kA1mYSOtaa	Atr, let me ask you something...why is she your ex in the first place? Because you lived far apart? Here is my take on things. If you live far away and things fall apart, it is likely because she is not interested enough in you to be thinking of you at all times and she will start to wonder what else is out there, particularly in the area in which she lives. Put plainly, does a woman who "loves" you even care about the distance? Was she making an attempt to come and see you? If not, ask yourself this: why? Could it be that she is too busy with all the slow-dancing she is doing in that other part of the world? Of course she talks about you a lot. You're the ex boyfriend that "lived too far away" for things to work out. That type of story line is great (and I mean GREAT) for Hollywood; however, none of us have our own private jet, and this is NOT a movie.     There IS, though, a happy ending in sight. Here's how it goes. You DON'T waste your time texting her. You only speak to her if she shows up at your house in tears, beating down your door; NOT when she calls your phone. That is her leash for you, and she will use it to keep tabs on you. If she asks what you've been up to, you should tell her, "Well, I've been real busy as a photographer's apprentice. You know...taking pictures of all these supermodels and all. It's really quite tiring." She will recognize the sarcasm, of course, but that is not the point. Building mystery with humor is exactly what will intrigue her and make her want you back. Still, you need to make a rule for yourself as I did: NEVER take an ex back. If it didn't work once, twice will only break your heart, and you have taken enough of a beating at this beauty's hands.     Your philosophy should be as follows: there are FAR too many good ones out there to keep giving the same one chance after chance. Find someone nearby who respects you, is flexible, and is a giver. Do that, and you will no longer worry about what this girl is thinking or saying about you. Now get out there and get some phone numbers!
N2BAdOXEaa	You are almost right in that regard, but not always. The chase is faster and more exciting, but the catch is just as much fun. But different in many ways. It takes two trying very hard to make a relationship work, and both need to communicate the others desires. But most cannot do this from the beginning. Work harder at it and the rewards will be worth it. You just need to take this relationship to the next level, by being creative. Good luck with your choices.|`|AA11119957	u just not trying, its your turn to keep him. its easy to pull a guy in but to keep him is a another story.|`|bYFS7xBCaa	it looks like yo play tooo hard to get at the beginning ,so they guy will try to rest himself and try less.     you should be something in the middle , neither too hard nor too easy.     jus natural

Your bud is respecting you by encouraging you to go out with her to save face.    Your best bet is to talk with your bud about this. Get his feedback often and let it loose. If your friend hooks up with the girl, than you can say that you hooked your best bud with the best girl. Plus, you never know if this girl has a sexy sister or cousin. ;)      cheers

You have to eventually get out of bed.    It's easier to show a person what you need than to be with a jerk who happens to satisfy you in bed.    I think that's why a lot of women make big mistakes when choosing a spouse or mate.|`|9227f445dd747c16fdb3934ea62382dfaa	Men an women are differnt and not too many women who are married have tested the waters as guys do. They probably will  not be married if they did.  Women do not consider the exact sexual act as lvoe making: there are other things through out the day that start it for women.  Mate selection is not based on the bedroom, because a house has many other rooms that need to be filled.  Additionally, many women stay quiet because the truth would be too devastating.|`|AA11943241	Yes my husband sure does...

My husband is wonderful in bed..If he werent or if he needed to change some things, or the way he did some things, I would tell him, and we would work on it together...Part of why the sex is so good, is because he meets all my needs emotionally also...

fmZJOYewaa	It's hard to break up.  It's very hard when you care for someone but you or him has changed.  I think with eaither option there is ope if the partner is willing to work on the replationship.  But from what you described, he is giving you the sugar coated version and not wanting to lose you completely in case.

I am going through the situaion right now. I have outgrown  my ex. And he keeps harping on. The fact that: We are not together. Yet I have told him. That I don't love him anymore. I guess it all goes. Hand in hand.  My ex use to convince me that: He loved me. Yet when it came to him. Doing what needed to be done. In order for us to progress. He never persued anything,yet he always expected me. To always mak ethings right. What the hell ever! I am only one person. Everything had to evole around him. Once I realised that. And got over my hurt and animosity. I grew strong mentally. And this is why he is an EX.|`|AA11012822	I think if you've fallin out of love with  someone & you stay in that relationship for all the wrong reason's yes that could make you a very unhappy person. When  a person is  unhappy or not content  with life as it is, it is only natural to want to remove your self  from the sitiuation that cause's them pain. In your case  it was your marriage,the best thing you could do is move on with your life, you wouldnt wont to be with somebody that didnt want to be with you!|`|9e9f4291392994e15641f40bd2525821aa	He's a coward, so it's easier for him to leave it this way, rather than just telling you straight.  Actions speak louder than words.  The fact is, he has moved on.  So should you.
5E4t2xqNaa	Just keep reminding yourself of all the things you didn't like about your relationship.  Everything happens for a reason.|`|Uu8iCur8aa	Well to start, if they have gave or gotten you something and you still have it throw it out! That will make it little easier on you. After you do that get rid of any pictures so you can't make it harder on you looking at them. Then either try to get someone else or get involved in other actives you like to do so you will be concentrating only on that activity, or if you get someone else then you can only focus on them.
AA12190953	How about asking them. Its usually best to do this in person so you can see their reaction, and you can tell if they r lying. I like it when pple come directly to me and ask something instead of playing games and asking everyone else but me. So thats y I do the same for others. Leave the drama for those who thrive on it.
1e5e770f583f8bf7d60243fb178705b8aa	Hola Ori...      Creo que que todo esto que te pasa con tu "amigo" puede ser por dos razones principalmente:    1. Competencia: Como dices ambos son buenos estudiantes, ambos tienen buenos promedios y ambos han sido premiados, es por ello que el "amigo" siempre anda tras de ti para que no le hagas competencia. Tomalo con filosofa: velo como un reto personal, se ms competitiva que l hasta que l reviente y no pueda alcanzarte el paso, con esto te lo podras quitar de encima poco a poco.    2. Esta enamorado de ti...!!!, digo, puede ser. Por ello trata de hacer todo lo que tu haces, para que te des cuenta de que vale la pena, que es igual de bueno que tu y que te fijes en l, (que es una manera muy estupida de llamar tu atencin), pero tambien te lo puedes quitar de encima haciendo lo que te recomende arriba.    Ahora bien, si lo que quieres realmente es mandarlo a volar definitivamente y rapido, pues de frente, firme y segura: miralo a los ojos y dile muy clara y certeramente: !Ya no me estes " $% %"%"%!, vete mucho a la ! " $%!%    A ver si as si entiende...!    Bueno... eso digo yo!    Saludos|`|7OK94hkJaa	Vos se vos mismo, y no te fijes en lo que dice o hace el chico.

XbZIicftaa	I suggest a marriage counselor.  He doesn't think it's a big deal, but he needs to understand that you do, and your trust was violated.  I don't think this should end your marriage though.  Find a counselor that will help you move past it and trust again.  Also, be sure that you both understand boundaries on appropriate contact with the other sex!  Ego boost or not, going on dating sites is totally inappropriate.|`|Kh5o3QCcaa	It could just be an ego boost.... but I still find it rather shady.  Can it be saved?  You need to talk to him.  Tell him how you feel about the marriage, and what he means to you still, and see what he has to say regarding your marriage and how he feels about you.    As far as the emails, if that's all the further it got, they can still be very dangerous.  It's called an emotional affair, and I personally find them more threatening than a physical affair.  They are deeper, and more heartfelt.  Even if he didn't connect with anybody in that way -yet- it's still him looking to see what is out there for him.      I would ask him to respectfully stop with his 'browsing' and come up with a detailed goal of how to boost both of your egos together like setting up date nights where each of you can dress up for one example.    Best of luck.|`|hcc8fq7jaa	Yes, a man CAN stay faithful to a woman forever. So, he was basically "flirting" online? I wouldn't worry.  He had concerns that you were no longer interested? Did he explain why? Maybe there are little problems that you two need to honestly address. I don't know how old he is, but I'm 41, and we've been married 22 years. I know I sometimes feel like my wife doesn't want me, or more accurately, that she could do much better. He may be going through a period of insecurity. It happens to everyone at some point. He probably just needs a little reassurance that women still find him desirable. Women go through the same thing, BTW. You seem pretty open with each other, perhaps consider indulging other fantasies. Maybe the two of you would want to try signing up on adult sites (like adultspace) where you can meet other people, and exchange pics, etc. You don't necessarily have to "hook up" with others, but it can be a lot of fun to talk and flirt online (together) with other people. It's just an idea. Keep in mind, you need to be having this discussion with him. Good luck.|`|pgdNUFt1aa	my mom and dad have been married to 55 years now! good enough answer?|`|bwKZ8MWWaa	1 he is faithful but wants some excitement   2 is he just wanted sex, that's pretty easy to get, and if he were getting it, he wouldn't be wasting his time on "dating Sites"   3 Sign up on the dating site, seek him out and then watch him soil himself when he arives to meet the mystery woman, you!|`|FnR5anh5aa	Well, he hasn't cheated on you yet so you still have a chance!!

b5dbad004b636682546f6aaa4634aa72aa	Yo digo que es tu decision...    No se trata de solo abrir las patas aunque la sociedad diga qeu solo es otra forma de pasar un bonito momento con alguien.    Pero en mi humilde opinin, la sociedad machista nos juzga a los hombres que no nos acostamos con todas y cada una de las ni?as -y que el que mas sexo tiene es el macho alfa.    "Yo digo que esto son estupideces machistas"    Si te quiere: sabr esperar, y si no te espera entonces solo te quera para un acoston.    La verdad es que estuve esperando a enamorarme y ahora que me estoy enamorando, en lo ultimo que he pensado es en sexo porque veo esa relacin ms a futuro.    Yo soy casto (a pesar de ser hombre, ya tener 22, y a pesar de tener un chingo de ni?as atrs de mi):  -y me valdra madre no llegar casto al matrimonio, pero si no lo he hecho ha sido porque en mi humilde opinin ellas no se merecen ser tratadas una ms con la que me acost (pero la neta a todo mundo le digo que no soy casto, porque la pregunta obligada es ?porque? como si yo fuera extraterrestre, o si son muy inmaduros lo toman a burla.    -Si algn da entraras a un ba?o de hombres (en un antro) y escucharas la forma en la que los borrachos nos expresamos de las mujeres, creeme que nos escupiras en la cara.

Pienso en las mujeres que tuvieron relaciones conmigo y luego anduvieron con otros chicos, no las critico ni me burlo de l, al contrario, a veces pienso en que el tipo es afortunado.

Si es por el tema de aprovechar, tambin me parece correcto porque el ser feliz implica aprovechar, equivocarse, divertirse, entregarse, comprometerse. Es relativo que los hombres podamos aconsejar en ese tema que es tan individual de cada uno. Y por ltimo, las novias no son objetos, son mujeres que si han llegado a la puerta de ese momento sexual son lo suficientemente maduras para vivivirlo o no con su novio sin necesidad de que uno aconseje.

Pero, como han dicho otros participantes en esta pregunta, bien difcil que es conseguir una mujer as en el mundo de hoy, primero porque, como ves, la mayora de hombres ya han tenido relaciones no slo con una, sino con varias mujeres, siendo novios, amigos o lo que sea, pero sin haber tenido primero un compromiso serio, eso quiere decir que as mismo ya han habido muchas mujercitas y mujeres que ya han perdido esa calidad.    Ya todo depende de lo que cada uno valore permanecer o no virgen, sin ser ofendido, abusado, intolerado, objeto de burla, retrasado, etc. Cuando alguien se impone a tantos factores y quiere mantener para si mismo esas particularidades, quiere decir que es un o una valiente de mente y de actitud, y que nunca se sentir deshonrado consigo mismo, eso tambien es tener temple y ser leal y firme a sus creencias y principios, que, como repito, aunque en el mundo actual ya no valgan ni cinco centavos, si te sientes bien as y no le has entregado lo mejor de ti a cualquiera que te calienta la oreja, me parece muy bien hecho, te has dado a respetar y te has valorado ms.    Caer es muy fcil, pero mantenerse primero antes de caer es lo difcil, la tentacin es tan grande que anda por todas partes, y aunque tarde o temprano se puede caer, es mejor caer bien.|`|JEUi6RZ9aa	AMI la verdad no me interesa si me caso con ellla, la voy aceptar con eso. al menos no es problema para mi|`|C3i2F2T2aa	obiamente importa   pero este mundo ya nadie le interesa  eso|`|rzU9xNXlaa	Si ya he tenido relaciones y no estoy casado, sera extremadamente injusto exisgir virginidad por parte de la mujer, respondiendo a tu pregunta:    No, no importa y menos en una sociedad tan abierta y de doble moral como la que en este momento se vive    ?Saludos!|`|1e5e770f583f8bf7d60243fb178705b8aa	Claro que no me importa...!!!!!

No todos los hombres somos iguales, ni tampoco las mujeres... yo creo que es un hombre, que tuvo que pasar un duelo, si es que lo hizo, puede ser un hombre responsable y cuando uno es responsable y se preocupa por sus cosas, somos, serios y poco demostrativos.  Pero cuando un hombre acta, como lo describs, no significa que no te quiera o no te tenga presente, sino que puede ser as su personalidad, fjate en peque?as cosas en el, si no le florece el ni?o, que todos llevamos dentro, sin importar la edad, aunque sea por instantes muy peque?o, aprende a descubrir su perfil, antes de tomar decisiones equivocadas, yo estoy casado con una mujer maravillosa y no es demostrativa, ni mucho menos ha estado cuando la he nesecitado, me costo mucho entenderla, hasta peleas y discusiones hemos tenido, pero hoy puedo entenderla, sabes por que, porque primero me entend y me analic a mi mismo y descubr en mi, que era y soy un hombre egosta.  Un beso y suerte!!!

76de5c3a376ed31368b444b8481f20deaa	At the website below you can order personalized M&M's. You pick two colors and a message to put on each one. *Tip - if you leave the second message blank it puts the first message on both so if you want a message on only half the m&m's put a space in the second message box* Pick her two favorite colors or colors like red & pink or white, & write "Marry Me?" or something like that on them. An idea I think is romantic would be to Put the M&M's in a candy dish (maybe a glass heartshaped one) and hide the ring in the candy. Or if you dont want to spend the money on the personlized ones buy or favorite kind of candy preferablly one small like m&m's and just hide the ring in it as she eats the candy she'll find the ring.    http://www.mymms.com/customprint/|`|AA11380378	Include her interests and your history into your proposal.    is she into cooking? travelling? gardening? hiking?     With a little more detail we can come up with some ideas.     Well I just came up with one... on Valentines day, tell her that you want to have an anti-valentines day. Go and do things that you will normally don;t do on valentime's day: go to the zoo, the museum, go to mcdonalds, buy gardening tools, etc. som,ething completly off track.... make sure that she knows of yoru idea of doing something anti-valentines for change and have lots of fun doing so.    At the end of the date, you can tell her that Valentine's day would have no meaning if you don;t do something romantic... then get on your knees and propose.    This is the best that I can do on a short notice  and ith little info heheh    Congratulations and good luck|`|c4200926bb4c76f6d6636f7cb8a1751eaa	Something that is unique to your situation.  Think deep inside of you "what would make her feel special".  Maybe something the two of you have always talked about ~ train ride into the country, trying out a special place to eat, feeding ducks at a park, anything you know she has wanted to do.  I would say "honey, I know this is something you've wanted to do for a long time...but ...there is also something I've wanted to do since I met you...and that is to be with you always....etc..."    Just an idea.      Congratulations and good luck!|`|d5b01d45841edb14ae829bc60415c334aa	Why do you want to get married?  Seriously, answer that question for yourself and then you'll have your proposal.  For instance, if you want to get married because you cannot imagine waking up without your special person, that's a great way to start.  Of course, if the answer is, dunno, maybe you should think harder, lol!|`|f15dda0ce5bcbf659d0e89a8d31c31f8aa	When I lived in San Diego 18 years ago....on my way to work, on the side of the road was a large hand made sign that said a girls name on it, then the next sign said "I'LL LOVE YOU FOREVER".....and of course the last sign said "PLEASE MARRY ME (and his name).....sure made an impression on me....GOOD LUCK with how ever you do it :)|`|AA10060160	You should check out www.adiamondisforever.com.  They have some great suggestions on proposal ideas along with a TON of other great information.  Whatever you decide to do, just make sure that it is thoughtful and comes from your heart.  You want her to remember that day for the rest of her life.  Hope this helps.
oWbKiXlsaa	La seule chose que vous pourriez voir  l'ouverture du caveau, c'est le cercueil du petit gar?on. Rien de plus. Mais cela pourra rouvrir des blessures jamais cicatrises. Mes condolances et bon courage. L'urne sera simplement dpose sur le cercueil. Vous pourrez voir le cercueil uniquement si vous vous approchez du caveau pour y jeter une fleur.    ***Saches que les cercueils sont placs  entre 2 et 5 mtres suivant les caveaux. Vu que celui-l date de 20 ans, il a t creus dans la terre.  Les cercueils sont fabriqus en bois massif. Ils sont costauds, crois-moi, j'ai port celui d'un de mes grands-pres et celui d'une de mes grands-mres. Les racines ne peuvent pas le casser. Au pire, fais confiance au personnel des pompes funbres et au personnel du cimetire qui ont 'habitude et le respect pour prparer au mieux la crmonie pour viter de vous attrister plus que ce que vous allez ressentir.***|`|lxKFZt99aa	Ne t'inquite pas,on ne voit rien !!!    Les pompes funbres auront dj ouvert le caveau afin d'y dposer l'urne de ton Oncle.  Tu ne verras pas le cerceuil de ton cousin.  Ensuite,le cortge se retire et ils refermeront le caveau aprs.  Il se peut qu'entre temps,vous "jettiez" une fleur en hommage.    Malheureusement,?a sera  nouveau une triste journe pour tes grands-parents.  Bisous et courage|`|azj9Vo2Jaa	Je voulais juste te souhaiter bon courage! Ces moments sont toujours difficiles. Courage a toute ta famille!|`|B3IioFMZaa	Ne t'inquites pas : ce n'est pas le cercueil qui sera ouvert, juste la tombe et les cendres de ton oncle, mis par dessus. C'est prvu...

34a7b6e3051820f067046aa7a01deae7aa	I wrote all of these. I hope you like them. I'm not sure if they all apply to you though they're most about being heartbroken but I hope you like them!!    1) I gave my heart, my soul, my everything.  I had given you my true love.  And I thought you had given your everything.  But then you tore my heart into pieces.    As I watch it fall, shatter, tumble.  I begin to wonder why I even fell for your sly tricks.  Why I even loved you.    I thought you loved me.  But I guess I was wrong.      2) My heart started rising, starting beating a million miles.  It raced through me, reaching for you.  And I thought you had too.  But fate was wrong.      3) I thought you said forever.  I thought we were meant to be together.  But you shattered my heart and tore it into two.  And now it's covered in bruises and scars.  You're only making it worse.  But the pain is still there, but I shall resist it.  I still love you.  And I thought you did too.  Au revoir, mon amour.  Good bye my love|`|67466c78d63c531282edf12f30416892aa	"what meant to be will find its way"..  "what goes round comes round"..|`|FgvnLPaKaa	He was my north, my south, my east and west    My working week, my Sunday rest.    My noon, my midnight, my talk, my song    I thought the love would last forever, but I was so wrong.|`|hKOiHnXQaa	I didn't want to let you go  But it had to be  I wasn't right for you  And you were not right for me.    You make it hard to say this   I'm telling you no lie  It was great being with you  But I had to say goodbye.      I wrote this   Just a little somthin somthin off the tip of the mind  :)|`|ebd72200976a538119d921ac1204fc8baa	It's better to have loved and lost, than never to have loved at all!!!!!!!
091LTWTCaa	No, beauty is in the eye of the beholder.
AA12130542	she may not be mad at all. she may just not think it is appropriate for you to be a part of her life while she is with someone else. or her boyfriend may not think it is and she is respecting his wishes. and you were the one who cut off contact. in that time she may have decided that her life is easier without you in it. it sounds like the two of you had a lot of drama in your friendship, and she may be happier now without it. that doesnt mean she hates you or is mad at you, she may just have moved on past wanting you as a regular fixture in her life. it happens with all relationships. theres no reason that she cant be friendly with you when she sees you, without being friends with you.|`|AdTnizwOaa	Aproach her and ask her what's going on. There may be rumors about you that she believed that aren't true, or she's just assuming you are mad at her for having a boyfriend.       I used to think the same with a boy i had a crush on, I thought he blocked me because he was on, on my different screen name. I got really upset but one day I asked him if he blocked me but I figured out he was just busy all the time.    If you are uncomfortable in confronting her face to face go on your other screen name and ask her, if you guys were really good friends why should she want to forget that? Yes, we girls tend to be dramatic, but i  see that you are curious to keep the friendship ..so find a way to talk to her.|`|ziI9NyLnaa	dude i say she's kind of mad of course. but i would stright out come up to her and say hi how r you doing and stuff like that say no hard feelings and say can we be friends again|`|ggtFDZfQaa	she might be upset and hurt. i mean, she got a bf, and you totally shut her out. she's probably hurt or she just might not wanna be your friend, srry.|`|H5NVYoNOaa	Every woman has a backup plan if the current bf doesn't work and you're dude.
AA11932907	your mind is the key to the answer......|`|1Oyy38U0aa	When a friend hurts you, mentally or physically.  Why?-Miley
Xf93fRTTaa	So what's more important to you? The dude? Or your friend? Answer that question honestly, and you'll know what to do.     What's that thing The Fray says in that one song? Sometimes the hardest thing and the right thing are the same?     That's what the kids are listening to these days, right?|`|0ox8VKwKaa	The most important thing to do is be upfront and honest with your friend. You will lose your friend otherwise and you will feel like you did something wrong. Its his decision as to who he likes. You can't control that. Don't hold anything back with your friend, but also make it clear with your friend that will you continue to see him if he likes you. You will feel better about yourself if your honest with your friend and yourself. Sometimes this is hard to do, but the reward is great.
GFV4Wxkpaa	i mean you can look all you want but when you start touching than thats cheating. i think flirting is on the line but that just depends on the person.|`|lQGDV7MEaa	I would say "doing anything you do with your partner," only with someone else.|`|LykjWv6faa	1.) Touching.  2.) Kissing.  3.) Sex. (I think this is the big obvious).  4.) Going out on dates with other people because you're 'tired' of your partner.|`|NoT3WGaEaa	Is normal to have thoughts I mean damn that goes for guys and girls.|`|LPtUJ5p5aa	This is an age old struggle between guys and girls.    It is human nature to find other people attractive and have romantic thoughts about them, its ACTING out on it that makes it cheating, wheter it be kissing, sex or even hanging out with the intention of taking it to the next level.    Lets face it, guys are jealous by nature, they want to protect what they love, a girl thinking about another guy opens the possibility to a girl leaving for someone better, its a trust thing.    Sounds like your boyfriend needs to relax a bit, and let thoughts be thoughts.....|`|JQcIwPXJaa	I think there are different levels of cheating and yes, that means even in your thoughts. If it starts in your thoughts eventually you are going to act on it.|`|PFBKuVhBaa	ive heard the expression  if you think about it your already guilty.  but see isnt it kind of human nature to look at attractive people  even if your not thinkin about anything sexual?  i say  kissing another person or having sex with them is cheating.  looking or talking isnt considered cheating to me.|`|CUc2gqzjaa	touching romanticaly|`|01xjZhtRaa	I think intimate physical contact would be cheating|`|SzQKCeRqaa	That's not cheating.     Cheating is doing something sexual with someone who is not your BF/GF. That includes making out, sex, etc.|`|WiBOrXUCaa	kiss them, hold their hands  and worst of all   having sex with them >,  thats definitely cheating xD haha|`|385b5c9d7cdef8d18d881b50a9b24b0faa	being unfaithful to your mate.|`|LS8LcuRaaa	It's called emotional cheating. Not nice either... Real cheating is, when you're intimate with another person (so kissing and more....)|`|kItRaRmlaa	there is emotional cheating and physical cheating...    also sexual pleasure of any kind besides that between a man and woman in a relationship is cheating.................acording to my high standards...which includes porn, online etc etc. my bf agrees|`|205ce36b2214521105667ecdc666b6c5aa	going out with one person and associating yourself with another|`|Y8l895Hyaa	no that is not cheating.Cheating is like when your in a relation ship with some one and have s*x with some one else|`|0WUcM6NBaa	Having a relationship with 2 people simultaneously (at the same time).|`|DS33Wl4waa	Looking at other people is not cheating, it's actually doing something with them that would be considered cheating|`|AA11602839	There are two kinds of cheating... physical and mental.|`|AoHuQQC1aa	idk|`|OQqAlHL8aa	If you are truly committed, having romantic thoughts about another man would be wrong. Though looking casually shouldn't be a problem.|`|Fs61jmqRaa	having the smallest feeling about someone else besides your true lover!|`|oqqPpzdqaa	Have you watch "CHEATERS"?  Cheating is "not honest" with your spouse. Doing something you know is bad and hurting, someone you love. Family breakdowns, fights, quarrels, divorced is the result. Why then get married? If you are married, the children are the victim of broken marriage.|`|MMiw1nImaa	okay so i think cheating is like ANYTHING AND EVERYTHING that you would consider relationshipish that you would do with your real boy friend with another person   ex: kissing your boyfriend and then walking up to your biology lab partner and kissing them.|`|4qPsEQFlaa	i personally think cheating is wanting to be with someone else. like my bf could kiss someone else as long as he doesnt want a relationship with them. kind of a one time only thing you know. but my bf is like yours. hes really protective and cheating is anything romantic with someone else to him.  but alot of people say that when guys are defensive, that means they are hiding something themselves.
70cf902dadc5b4b4b26486a165124b57aa	I had a similar situation......I was up front an honest about what I looked like.  She on the other hand was not and was reluctant to send a pic.  It turned out she was nothing what she said she was.  My guess is he hasn't been totally truthful as to what he looks like......ask him to come clean or put up the picture.|`|AA11811892	because he is a guy he is showing you his ego it is not that you would not like him all he was trying to do is see your picture and he thinks now that you look ok but not good for long term relationship may be or friendship so this is what you need to do start talking less to him online or on the phone ignore him and when he asks you why just tell him that you are more busy i think he finally would realize that showing his picture was a good idea and if he brings it up just say when i wanted it then you did not show it to me now you want to and i do not want to see it|`|91cb143168e4b9472e6c7101403074ecaa	id say that it was becausee he was afraid you wouldnt like him any more!...i think!|`|48e0b8004db8c3dd561a72764dc3025aaa	Chances are that he thinks you are too pretty for him, and he will not post his pic for fear you will think hes ugly.  He may be fat and nasty, so he wont put it up!    Just relax, if he doesnt post it, its his problem!|`|AA10269578	Well...his a real jerk. Forget about him. Move on. The thing is about your picture being posted and he doesn't post his own?.., just let it go..time will pass by and you can forget him. Men will shower us woman a praises which is contradict to their hearts. They said this and they said that which is not came from their inside, its just a part of being them. They are a real commentator, they talked more than woman, they recognized even slightest smell in your body which after wards they talk about it with their buddies and then giving up woman always. men are men..They throw you praises but in reality they despised it and saying goodbye and goodbye to you...Yeah..it's true men always saying things which is not true. They always say that they can't hurt woman...yeah, they don't hurt a woman but ignoring a woman and making woman think that they think the same way as you make you hurt so much....Just forget about it...Be open-minded and strain forward towards your goal in life...    Take care...|`|f8a6058136a2d214ccc4e86e3543fcf2aa	see again u email him. let us see what happen! i think so that he didn't like u .he may just telling lie about u . u dont worry u will get many friends soon .i will pray for u .i have also not having so many friends .by seeing ur feeling.i want to make friendship with u .  will u  become my  friend . would u like to become my friend .soon u reply me             my id www.selvaemile@yahoo.co.in  ph9444410915   ;     04426841454   wating for ur reply!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

SO INSTEAD OF LISTEN  TO HIM FIND OUT FOR YOUR SELF HOW HE FEEL.|`|752a57b483fbdca1b05d3c06a0822c6eaa	It is very difficult to provide a true feeling and true love of a brother and sister relationship in any other relationship of a boy and a gal and in your case this is internet contact so you should consider this factor before you analyse anything else...    You have not talked about your true feelings.. do you have ONLY a feeling and love of a brother for him? or you have not recognized your own feeling as of yet..?    This is quite possible that he is in your love but as you have named your relationship as bro-sis he must be feeling guilty from within and must be suppressing his love for you..    He was crying because he never wanted to expressed himself in that way to you and his friend has done that..    If you have true brotherly love for him and if you feel that he has something more than that then you should leave him along and grant him an opportunity to forget you gradually.. or else you should accept his love and enjoy your life...|`|0e1a96627956742e02017f4d0ff5a01faa	did u tell him the truth......................did you tell him how his friend had forced you to believe that he was in love with you............well if he is ur brother then he would understand............................  another test for your relationship............gal.........|`|ccc53d4e9fd048c961f83ca93a026805aa	hi! i am v.j   pls grow up! you have nt done anything wrong in expressing your feelings .

dd1f927248c50b7511137071de2458a5aa	This reminds me soo much of my best buddy. He liked this girl and this girl liked him, He gotten close to her and decided about asking her out.    The day he was going to ask her out, he learned that she has a b/f. This broke the guys heart, poor schmuck. But that didn't stop him from asking her out for a coffee and hang out.    Eventually, the gal dumped the other suck for my best bud. Been together ever since.    Bottom line, its for you to decide. You may still hang out with the guy but remember that you have your own boo. Its the atleast the most rescpectful thing to do is hang out platonically and if your feelings tell you that something is right or not, you will know and decide from there.    goodluck    cheers|`|rTaOOcwNaa	Perhaps he will, but nobody wants to be the rebound guy.    I recommend you dump your boyfriend, and then ask the boy out yourself.  This will give you the power...|`|7bdfbb61a03af20de78c2f39e954af6aaa	Maybe, how can anyone predict what this guy is gonna do? he might be afraid to pressure you into another relationship so quickly.. if he REALLY likes you and hasn't forgotten about you and moved on to another girl yet then hopefully he will ask you out.|`|YIEuOXvkaa	well ur single now so maybe but guyz do mobe on! just be careful and dont do n e thing stupid!

If you are shy wait until you see her alone, not with her friends and ask her. You might regret it if you don't. Good Luck
00ba14df888a1fbc98d0509d2fdf84a8aa	She's probably shy too. Ask to sit next to her sometime. Here's a pretty safe action...walk in sometime when there's an empty seat next to her, point to the seat, nod your head, and ask "Are you saving this for anyone?"
AA11456013	eehh..no!!!! were not mind readers!!!!!|`|AA11302074	too complicated could be a number of things|`|AA12099535	she must be wondering you must be crazy for staring at her.|`|AA10607811	Tell her how you feel inside and let her know that you like her. Start talking to her and maybe one day shell feel the exact same way for you too!!|`|516cb97d6eb8503e7b508722c2488730aa	Well it sounds like it could just be a case of "look, she looks, life goes on".|`|AA10939861	well i think that it means that she is shocked   or thinking about it  i am going through the same thing and when he looked at me i didnt smile because i was shocked|`|AA12253823	if you like her then just tell her because you may be surprised she may like you too. she may not smile at you because she doesnt know how you feel about her so just gain the courage and just talk to her and tell her. dont be afraid of asking out a girl because if you always go running scared then you will never fall in love and be alone your entire life. so just tell how you feel. Good Luck!|`|12fc13cad736f3dd722324494b737687aa	Probably not.  You might want to try smiling back.  It usually works.
a274a024ae8de51744103c10154affe0aa	well she probably like u and u like her because u've asked 53 questions about her so y don't u just go talk to her|`|e43af09176dd9cc830cb140f3b2928fcaa	she thinks you cute.
d50b6925f49a5b2e6c5bafcb214a5cceaa	Don't listen to all the other answers around here! This means that she was giving you signals! These signals I read are too strong to be misunderstood. You NEED to ask for her phone! But don't rush... Because there's plenty of time (at least 1 month). Not many girls would give such signals (there are many reasons), and she's a keeper (70% sure). So think of a plan to ask her out. It's not your imagination if she does it 3 times. If you need advise on asking her out, simply ask another question on Yahoo! Answers, and give me my 10 points. I'd be happy to help you out more if you want my help. I'm sure you two will have a good time if you go out!|`|AA10565903	this means u need to pay attention to church instead of what is going on around u. oh yeah go whit out your buddies.|`|b3a592b5c314a1359eeaf14cae380fc8aa	i love carrots|`|db08742a5fc24506d05902ef4d50864caa	it doesnt mean anything...... no offense but you just are hoping that this means that she likes you, because you probably just thought she was hot...
AA11990602	Girls give you signals by looking at you and smiling.  Twisting thier hair while they are talking to you, or looking at you, tells you that they really want you to put your hands on them.  If they have long hair, sometimes they will flip it over thier shoulder when you pass by.  They are trying to get your attention.      Just be yourself.  Strike up a converation about something you are very passionate about, because if you know a lot about a subject, you help create a positive feeling, a sense of confidence.  Women love confident men.  You don't have to be the best looking guy around, in order to get the best looking woman in a place, you have to feel like you are the best man in the place for the woman you want.  Some guys think that the most beautiful women will not talk to them, so they never approach them.  Just look in thier eyes, and not thier assets (boobs and buts), smile, and act intelligent.    Good luck and keep your confidence level up.  Remember this... You will MISS 100% of the shots you don't take.  If they say no thanks, move on to the next one.  It's a numbers game.  The more you talk to, the more opportunities you'll have of meeting someone you really like.|`|b79cc83001dda42fdd692b121f3a3eb5aa	its very easy riverdal_baby@yahoo.com I will tell you

8a49fc655789176306e864ddb91a4fbeaa	It means she is interested.  One way that people talk with their body language is playing with their hair.  It is a way of having others look their way.  If she is making eye contact with you when she does this it is YOUR attention she is trying to get.
b39acaaaa18dd194ed9609c01e32b768aa	well either she likes you or her and her friends are laughing at you and making fun of you. probably the former though.|`|1a511c080ac6c8b1a8aa2e234312c881aa	SHE defeintley likes u trust me on this one.

2cd0c927eb2ad29aa364669c974b41b4aa	If a girl quickly looks away it means she doesn't want you to see her either because she thinks your cute or hates you and hopes you don't see her. But since she was playing with her hair she probably likes you.. no matter what she is doing to her hair.    So in simpler forms it means she likes you!|`|c86cf3d1884d05ac95aee7198929f6dbaa	subtle flirting is when u use spell check|`|b51b41e6c79385fdcbcddcb3599d3d16aa	that means she like but she wants 2 kno do u like her|`|0307656ba8c6ca9d46dc7349730003c0aa	she likes u|`|053e663aa89dcabe9d5bc206bb3c86daaa	She was probably looking at u but didnt want u to see that she was checking u out. maybe u should say hello next time.

aVDyZFxqaa	I'll try to.  Do you know what it is like to climb a mountain?  Do you know what it is like to ride in a submarine?  Silly, I know. But if you ask something like that to someone, they will say, idk, I've never done that !  Same thing with Love.  Love is something people hear about in songs, in church, in the movies.  So they just repeat what they've heard. They have not been down that road before. That's all it is.  When you've been in love or in love now, honey, you know it!  However, that is another question.  Good Luck.|`|qDpFSqn4aa	You're obviously young and the youth only think they know what life is all about.  This is why so many young lovers tend to break up.  You have to learn how to love.  I'm betting you're not fully informed either but that's not for me to say. Everyone loves differently and it takes time to get to know each other.  During this time they learn what love is.  Life is all about learning.  I'm 51 and I still learn new things to this day.  Usually it's the ones who think they know all about it are the ones who are least informed.    Hope this answers your question.
ZSznCJhSaa	I'm not sure I understand this question...    Some people DO know what love is. I have experienced love. But if you are asking why people who don't pretend that they do... well... because they don't know what it is.   Before youve been in love and felt it, you aren't sure what its supposed to feel like and when you will know that you are in love. Its confusing because its undescribable and no matter who you ask they wont be able to tell you what it feels like and you wont understand until youve experienced it.    So they say I love you because they think they are supposed to, they think their partner wants them too or because they think thats how they will get a girl to do what they want.    But some people DO know what love is.|`|PyC1MIkXaa	Because nobody knows what love truly is.|`|cSaRk1Ygaa	Well... no one really knows the true meaning on love. In my opinion love is something uncontrolable. To be in love means that the person who you love and loves you in return means that you can love them as they are and want to be with them forever. As clique as that may sound.|`|DiPc84wQaa	i think they haven't read a dictionary before or atleast, looked it up :)|`|w3tNq8npaa	I think love is unexplainable.It's so many things in one that people have a hard time defining.But then you could be like my friend and say that love doesn't exist.I think love is real but everyone has a different definition of it.Maybe the world will never know.|`|AAgX0SDcaa	People first learn to love from their parents, if they were unconditionally loving parents they will learn as a child to love that way. If love was given only conditionally, then they will learn to love someone so long as everything is going their way and they get what they want. If their parents give them toys and other gifts instead of attention and love, they will equate material gifts as a substitute for love and become either gold-diggers or people who try to buy their way into someone;s heart. If the child doesn't recieve positive attention and has abusive parents, his love style is most likely to be that way too. There are exceptions, but for the most part our first teachers are our parents. The way their mother and father treat each other is a valuable lesson for all children.|`|4oeBAHANaa	people say that   *hate*  is a strong word  but so is  *Love*  and people throw it around constantly.|`|SsoNkOTZaa	They are mistaking love for lust, because they haven't actually experienced love yet to be able to know what it feels like. Lust is the closest they have got, and so they think that's what love is.
LykjWv6faa	Wow. After reading this, I can feel your pain. When I was your age, I was the same way: Depressed, alone, no friends, parents expected too much from me....no one really cared.  I myself, back then, resorted to self mutilation and for a while, the pain did help me forget what was going on around me. I've attempted suicide over 10 times..and each time was unsuccessful (Which, now, I am grateful for when I look back.) I was bitter and angry at everything...but,you know what? I sought a therapist, was sent to a mental hospital. About a year in darkness, I found my light--I realized that life is too precious to just throw away like that--even if things were always turning out horrible for me. I had the gift of life--we only live once...you have the choice to make yourself a better person...school, work...just getting out and doing little things for myself. Now, I'm 20 years old...out of my hell, with a wonderful boyfriend and a few friends I made during my stay at my job and college.    Please, don't use a permanent solution to a solvable problem. Seek the help of a counselor or a therapist. If I can get out of the same hell that you seem to be in, you can too. There is a door that leads out.    Take care.|`|AA12190953	As far as the abusive situation at home, first thing monday morning, go into the office and ask  to talk to your school counselor. Tell the counselor everything, dont be shy or try to protect anyone. Because all your going to be doing is helping the abuse to continue if you hold anything back. They can get you started in the right direction. Thats what they are there for is to help you, but they have hundreds of kids passing by daily so sometimes they miss important stuff. Like you, so you need to let them no, because you do matter kiddo.  Remember the squeaky wheel gets the grease. They may be able to give u ideas on the friend thing to. There may be a student club that ur not aware of, like music , art , video gamers, etc.. that you can join. They may even have some suggestions for after school activities.     If they counselor doesnt have any suggestions as far as the friend situation goes, you can always call your local christian church and ask about the youth group. often times they have a person who will be able to come pick u up for church. Or check the internet for any youth groups like the YMCA, start making a list of things that interest you. Like reading, sports, hiking, horses, your pets, etc... then write about each one what you like about it , why u like it, how u got interested in it , how long etc... This will help when u first start to communicate with other kids. So you wont feel so self conscious, and youll have some ideas of how to respond to questions or add to a discussion. So you wont feel so nervous.|`|suoY5vxbaa	aww im srry! seriously.. that is really bad... don't kill ur self.. no one wants to.. i no for a fact.. u might want to but if u think about it (well u still might.. idk) u don't wanna cuz too many ppl will miss u.. u may not think they will, but believe me, they will... and don't cut ur self either.. it might feel good but u still shouldn't... its not good for u... i really don't know what else to say but just don't kill or cut ur self cuz it really won't solve anything... i feel really really bad for u.

See if he usually goes for younger girls. See if he is a tool/uses girls or if he's sincere. And maybe ask him about it, like talk about it and see if he wants you or just wants your body.  No saying a freshman can't date a senior, just make sure his motives are good intentioned.  And also keep in mind that its stachetory rape if you two have sex since he's above 18 or 17 (Not sure which it is) but anyways you're too young legally and just too young.|`|DN3lPdE0aa	sex// or mayb he really like u

IJanDRg7aa	I find my self looking for a different type of girl then most guys. I don't just want to stare at their body. I'm all for the personality. I want someone who is their own person and not suckered for propoganda. A girl who is a strong thinker, and does what she wants because she wants it, not because everyone else does.|`|rnXLZJyXaa	Body: Bulbous rolls of fat jiggling down all over with a face that looks like it got blasted by a volcano with huge rhino thighs and a monstrous butt.  Hair: No hair, shaved head  Personality:  Extremely bitchy|`|7e4jxj3Daa	Nice shape, great legs, and sweet.|`|s4M7tJU5aa	you'll get like a different answer from every guy lol
tHw6GAsfaa	No. Now, I am not trying to say that they are incredibly flattering, but all you are trying to do is fix up your teeth, so you look even more beautiful when you get them off!:)|`|zYwnyy3Laa	who cares if you have them now? in a few years, it'll be worth it.    and personally, everyone i know doesn't even notice them unless you point them out. so its all cool :)|`|gp5KrhrPaa	Not really, it just depends if you/they look good with them.|`|kB7UsIXdaa	depends on the person. personally i find them unattractive but my friend sitting next to me (who has them) thinks they are just fine|`|Ir51Eb0Kaa	No they're not. They gave me a beautiful smile and I'm so happy I got them. No regrets!|`|bzK1Hpdgaa	They aren't usually pretty...but hey if you have braces, in a few years you'll be the most attractive. Or at least you'll have the best smile!|`|sJMFoJloaa	Not normally... Most people look really cute with braces :)|`|AA11660242	Nowadays, they kind of are. The have the new invisible braces that are'nt nearly as noticeable as the wire-and-rubber band regular braces.|`|gCGzs6PDaa	no, they arent unattractive............... I have them and i have only had one bf but some of the most popular and prettiest girls in my schoolhave them........... I think it all depends on who has them and how well you take care of them|`|fHnGnRsJaa	If people thought they were attractive, they would be getting them even if they didn't need them, like people who get plastic surgery, botox, implants, etc.|`|AA10839105	I love braces for the most part some people do look rather strange with them while others look quite nice I love freckles, glasses , braces it's sorta nerdy but nerds are in right now so who gives a ****|`|wybTIqXVaa	I actually never notice if someone has braces or not until, seriously, a year or so after I've known the person.  My three-month-or-so boyfriend has braces and has had them for a year or so, and I didn't even notice until about a month ago. xD|`|clu2Ia4paa	no not really but it does depend on the person (the face is the same, only the mouth is affect when closed it is the same (a bit puffy for some people) when opened the same but with braces lol) its only unattractive when u have food stuck in them :S  i hope i helped :)|`|Gs7AlXhDaa	well it dpends on ur age---if ur in middle school, pretty much everyone has them so no one cares-but as an adult, they kinda r...|`|MHQVnqaXaa	if you're in middle school. no.  if you're in highschool...sry yes.|`|UMIRn2f6aa	NO!   i think braces are SO pretty!!  and they are.  :D|`|IHRLadqTaa	Don't worry about braces, if someone likes you they dont care what you have, they will only care who you are (that is if its true love, and that kind of love is the best). Dont worry about it.
hCIAD98Zaa	I think you should go with your guts .  Why should you built distance and destroy   your hopes because he has this " thing " with a girl .    At the end , you'll be unhappy and it'll be too late  because you didn't had the chance to ask him out .    Just take your chance|`|9SSO454taa	wow!! your hot, Just text him that you like him. Good Luck =] plus if you text me i would say yes damn you hot xD|`|SRPwwLJ9aa	just calm down its not like you can force the guy to give up his girl and don't try flirting with him to steal him away because that's the bad way to go about it, the only thing you can do is stay friends and hopefully there would brake up and if it was meant for you to go out with him then you will eventually, it might sound long but patience is a virtue|`|L4QhCMcSaa	keep distance from him and  if he calls you after a week  answer and if he starts   talking the way he talks  to you then you should be   like if you aint going to commit  to me then i dont want nothing with you|`|GMNKQxPraa	If he is old enough to be your farther then its wrong anything inbetween is fine in my opinion. But you have to be 18+ first.    PS can i...... ;)|`|RVAG01cdaa	if you love him then go for it!! talk to him privately about it and i am sure it should be alright.. the worst he can say is no!!

GabGD8DUaa	teardrops on my guitar by taylor swift is an obvious one.  uhm....and you you you by julianne hough.
yxinxA2daa	I am going to assume that, that's the goddess girlfriend. Most guys would love to have her as their girlfriend but still. Maybe she's sexual towards you because she had a past relationship who her ex was very sexual and she wasn't ready for sex which he dumped her for. &now that you've come along she doesn't want to let you go and she's picking up her last game where she last left it off and she's ready for sex.  I think you need to talk to her about it because highly you said that you guys weren't in the relationship only for the sexual contacts.    Honestly, I think she's trying to please you.  Since you're an older man she probably doesn't know what to say or do so she tells you dirty stuff.  She probably gets really caught up in both of your sexual world that she's really open about it.|`|66e03546d71298a34daadeb6dce02da6aa	Maybe if she gives you oral a few times that will cool her engines.|`|sZ1xbQXlaa	Yeah that is sorta normal but sometimes when you feel like thats all you talk about maybe tell her straight up or change the subject in a suddle way oor take her mind off it and talk about something else or do something else|`|492681182d7c9b1f14276670369e851baa	Er. are you OK?  Most bloke would sell their cat for this sort of stuff.|`|01pY6dW9aa	Dude, a 16 year old girl who's acting like that all the time is pretty annoying and she can't control herself too.|`|fCZKGBjBaa	Her being younger, probably feel like she has to impress you by talking like that or acting like thats all she wants. But if you guys are actually in a relationship than you should let her know it'll happen eventually and when the time is right, thats not all she should talk about. I'm not sure of the age difference but just make her aware you'll love her either way.|`|cp2182xNaa	Yeah, it's normal. Maybe not too usual...but normal enough. I'm 16 too and I talk about sex all the time with my boyfriend. I text him dirty things and I love his cock. We haven't had sex yet, but yeah. It's really fun, and just enjoy it.|`|GabGD8DUaa	well i guess it is normal. me and my boyfriend do the same thing just not as explicit. haha|`|4evaEQVwaa	Her being 16 and you say your and older guy sounds like your 21 so I dont really think you two need to have sex right now. I feel you should wait until the "honeymoon stage" is over (which will only take a month or two) and then see how you really feel about each other. And with her being soooo  young and that horney all the time I think you need to strap twice because I can understand a young girl having urges but wanting you to do all that extra stuff like pictures ...come on dude she aint even felt it yet so why is she so hyped? IDK I think you need to calm her down some and let her know that theres no rush and that you are always gonna be there and then see what happens.|`|WeWqZD8Zaa	i guess it depends how long you ve been together.  its ok if she says these fa couple of times in the day but its not ok if every time you talk all she mentions is ur ....,if all you talk about is this subject.Also,in many women magazines eg cosmo,u will see sometimes that they advise women to send an erotic text to their man so u know,put him in the mood,to spice things up,so maybe thats what she s trying to do,and theres nothing really wrong with that.However, the best thing you can do is ask her,i mean she will definitely give you the answer that you need.good luck.  p.s. i find it really great that you are into this relationship for more reason than just sex
hCIAD98Zaa	I think you should start by telling him   you appreciated what he's done for you for so long  and you're really happy to have a good friend like him.    Why not give him a card with feelings and gratitude.  It would sound friendly but maybe he'll react with a hug   or a kiss on the cheeks. You could give him 2 days before  Valentine's day or right now just to say a little thank you .    I understand how it's like to wait for someone's response   but I think the waiting is always worth it when you know  you're really in love with that person .    Good luck with him and get well !|`|rQEJATQgaa	I know that you would only kiss a guy that you are serious with, and you haven't had a first kiss yet, so you could drop incredibly subtle hints all day then at the end of the day ask him about how he feels about kissing and ask him if he would kiss you. Don't do it at the beginning of the day because if he doesn't want to kiss you then the whole day will be ruined.  Also he may be like you, as it normally is, that he just doesnt want to set things off too fast for you as you say he is "gentlemanly" and if he knows you he knows that you only kiss people that you realy like.  Try kissing him but if you don't want to push him then just leave it at you guys are going out and only kissing as that sounds good.  I'm very shy as well but I have a girlfriend and it was pretty much exactly the same as how you described|`|bYFS7xBCaa	I don't know about valentine day, but I think that a lot of people love it.    I think that people date that time ,and have sex.|`|AA11640076	Just talk to him about it. i think he might be shy to make the first move he realllllly likes you|`|SZ9BNWVIaa	just watch how he acts with other girls.  But he's either really caring about you as a friend or there's more going on.  xx
biDakFvUaa	Keep your friends close and your enemies closer. If your sister is deeply in love with him just try to be her best best best friend and listen what she need to say, because if some body  say things about him then she won't listen, just let her see how bad he is. Good luck|`|aXKWnLKMaa	ok don't panic take deap breaths talk to your parent have a family meeting talk to your sister see how it works out|`|DDptTGiZaa	please check more on  club of ___ kissinterracial co m_____|`|9q7UPZIfaa	She should admire you enough to trust you judgment, however, you may have to let this ride out.

6b30aed383f4ffc3871d7c091d3bed64aa	Aww... I had to deal with a long distance relationship for 4 months... I've got 3 tips for you.     Make him record a voicemail on your phone, a long one that will comfort you, and listen to it when you miss him.     Call him and leave msgs on his phone (if possible). It feels like you've talked to him and told him what you wanted to say.     Make little presents to give him (like folding paper, etc) for when you see him again... This will keep your hands busy.     Good luck and stay strong!|`|147607adf55cb5f3a236aadc7f042230aa	If you choose to date someone in the military then you are going to have to learn that work comes first!!!! He is not always going to be able to call or write when you need him too.     Be patient and understanding. I'm sure he misses you just as much as you him. He is having a harder time then you if you think about it.     I use to tell my husband that by the time he gets home the garbage will be ready to take out...he was out ALLOT!!!!|`|94e259603b8ac9c75dbe7d9ab8ed3edcaa	BEING A FORMER SAILOR IS NOT EASY ESPECIALLY TO A GF CAUSE A SCHOOL IS FOR A SHORT PERIOD OF TIME THEN THEY GET TO GO HOME AND SEE THERE FAMILY AND YOU BUT THATS ONLY FOR 30 DAY THEN SHIPPED OUT TO SEA   PS THE TOWN WHERE HE PROBABLY AS NTC GREAT LAKES IT ABOUT 1 1/2 HOURS FROM CHICAGO|`|c2a707442882a18c98ab19930fe3d263aa	Truthfully, I would be REALLY careful with that relationship. I only say that because I was in the military and unless your guy is the best and most faithfull guy in this world, he will mess around on you. No matter how much he says he won't, he doesnt realize how it is when your really in the military and get to the base.  Now i am not trying to scare you, because im sure there are guys that will try to be faithfull, but it is hard when you are away for so long.  But to answer your question, I would deal with it by trying to fill my life up with friends and family and trying to do stuff for myself.|`|e9e75c6476110767844b199f2a567801aa	I am married to a Sailor and you have to keep yourself busy.

Let her have her time to chill & grow up & then tell her that he only hugged you becuz you gave him a card. Tell her that that's a stupid reason to get mad at you & that you still wanna be friends.

(what I've noticed)    -when I injure myself or do something kinda stupid (it's often for me :P)  -when you act a little silly (without being ridiculous, just like playful), that could be like, a random funny face, a little random dance, just random cute stuff  -being competitive with them, silly debates and stuff. always just playful stuff.    I dunno, it's just I've noticed guys seem to laugh when I'm playful and more lighthearted. Then again, that could just be the guys I hang out with. Cause some guys wouldn't find it funny. It also depends on your personality, cause sometimes a girl acting a little silly can be dreadfully annoying if it's over done. Or if it looks like your trying to hard, then it's not really funny. Also, if it's all the time it can be annoying.

Mq27Wg5aaa	Well this sounds like my story lol. I met my boyfriend in highschool. We had history together lol. In my case we sat right beside each other so it was easy enough to talk. If you can ask your teacher if you can move and make up some excuse. I was the shy one and he was the outgoing one. I asked his friend one time if he likes me because he was always flirty with me. come to find out he did and we gave it a try. We have been together for 2 year and 3 months now. Its kind of hard fo ryou because guys need to stand out a lil. Just to let you know a girl doesnt approach you if she likes you. Unfourtunatly you have to do the work here. Just say hi to her a couple of times get used to talking to her. Then just ask her if she wants to hang out or do something. Then thats when you tell her when  you two are alone. The least that can happend is she tells you that she looks at you as a friend. Dont be heart broken then because then you know you got to move on...|`|yC7hgBfGaa	. . . . .. . . . . . . . . . . ,.-. . . . . . . . . .``~.,  . . . . . . . .. . . . . .,.-. . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .-.,  . . . . .. . . . . . ..,/. . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . :,  . . . . . . . .. .,?. . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .\,  . . . . . . . . . /. . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . ,}  . . . . . . . . ./. . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . ,:`^`.}  . . . . . . . ./. . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . ,:. . . ./  . . . . . . .?. . . __. . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . :`. . . ./  . . . . . . . /__.(. . .~-,_. . . . . . . . . . . . . . ,:`. . . .. ./  . . . . . . /(_. . ~,_. . . ..~,_. . . . . . . . . .,:`. . . . _/  . . . .. .{.._$;_. . .=,_. . . .-,_. . . ,.-~-,}, .~; /. .. .}  . . .. . .((. . .*~_. . . .=-._. . .;,,./`. . / . . . ./. .. ../  . . . .. . .\`~,. . ..~.,. . . . . . . . . ..`. . .}. . . . . . ../  . . . . . .(. ..`=-,,. . . .`. . . . . . . . . . . ..(. . . ;_,,-  . . . . . ../.`~,. . ..`-.. . . . . . . . . . . . . . ..\. . /\  . . . . . . \`~.*-,. . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . ..|,./.....\,__  ,,_. . . . . }.>-._\. . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .|. . . . . . ..`=~-,  . .. `=~-,_\_. . . `\,. . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .\  . . . . . . . . . .`=~-,,.\,. . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .\  . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . `:,, . . . . . . . . . . . . . `\. . . . . . ..__  . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .`=-,. . . . . . . . . .,%`>--==``  . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . _\. . . . . ._,-%. . . ..`\|`|ooRxjLXcaa	find her on myspace, or whatever, and get her number through there so that you don't have to be all nervous and stuff doing it in person, and once you have her number text her and get to know her, and once you get to know her, ask her out. and don't be shy to talk to her.

Just engage her in simple conversation. You're friends on facebook? Send her something funny, than ask her if she got it the next time you see her. You could both laugh and talk about whatever it was. That's a good icebreaker. I wouldn't sweat it. Even if she "rejects" you, SO WHAT? At least you'll know for sure, rather than torturing yourself wondering. You'll also be better off getting past that fear. The hardest part is approaching the girl, once you get past that fear, it will be even easier the next time. Trust me, if you don't find out, you'll kick yourself.|`|mdtkor2Paa	just ask her out|`|sD1SZXEmaa	my my, you're crazy about her now huh?

He did end up talking to her once and got burnt by her. I felt bad, but I think it gave him some closure.    Sometimes, things can turn out well. But you may have to find that on your own.

Then there is the guy who is a convicted sex offender, he wears a trenchcoat like the matrix. And lastly, their is "The Professional", he wears a cardboard Burgerking crown and a fake muscle suit. We walk around town and knock on random doors. When the person answers, I dance and do a Jar Jar quote, then make a loud screech with an air horn. While the person is reeling from the sound, the sex offender confesses that he is a sex offender (as required by his parole). Then the grimace throws some leaves and dirt into the persons house.

AA12379133	Well it's like this... Immaturity has everything to do with it.     One he has his girlfriend A who has been with him for a while, He can see Girl A anytime he wants and even spend time away from Girl A and still get some when he goes back.     Then he has Girl B, a new girl, she doesnt know him, but wants him and she needs the green light to go forward and give it up.     He lies to Girl B says he and Girl A are broken up, then he gets some from Girl B because he's told her all that she needed to hear.     In all fairness, assuming that your guy is a good guy, relationships are a little strange, sometimes it takes a few visits to fully break it off with someone. Girl A might need a little conforting or need to talk to him still.

Yet, they are not satisfied because they are looking else where. Don't let this guy get the best of both worlds, tell him to lose the gf, or he loses you.     p.s. ....do you really want to be with a guy who does that to a woman anyway?
733cb8e62843d7e06ab3c59a0f87ee3aaa	Tell him you're not ready. That's the best thing to do. I had my baby at 19, I know I wasn't ready, you have a whole life ahead of you. I f he doesn't understand your needs right now, you may need to put your relationship on hold with him until you are truly willing. Also make sure he is really serious, like where's the ring, does he have money saved for this baby he wants and for you two to be moved in together. If he doesn't don't take him seriously until he's got all this together.|`|e4282373943d6fd6a043703f302aaf3faa	Tell him that you're not ready for that.

Its too early, tell him its not the right time for you. If he loves you then he will wait.|`|AA10704364	19 is way too young to have a baby.  You are not much more than a baby yourself.    Give yourself a chance to live life a little.  Go to school to have a career.  Travel.  Have some fun.      Being a Mom is NEVER DONE!!!  NEVER.  As long as your child is alive, you are always a Mom and will feel responsible.    Also, don't let someone pressure you to do something that you're not ready to do.  That is letting yourself into a possibly controlling relationship.    Good luck.|`|c3a1a57ab0707d2296e8aa9f6bd4dc91aa	Don't ever do anything against what YOU believe is right!  Ask yourself if you will regret what YOU choose to do now??  If he is not the right one; you'll know doll:)|`|35ef9dddc22caa65c89cdea64f6a98bbaa	If you're not ready, then you're not ready. You need to sit him down and explain WHY you can't live with him at present. You're only 19 - the whole world is open to you - there is plenty of time to settle down and have children. Maintain your independence. You may love him but don't let him blackmail you into anything. If he loves you then he should be able to see where you're coming from and slow everything down. Remember - no babies!

He needs to learn how to live with out you and on his own before he learns how to live with someone. He is too dependent on you, he is comfortabel with you being there for him and he does not want to lose that. Its more comfort and not love. DUMP HIM

You can always tell her that you love her but not in that way if it gets really uncomfortable for you. But you may be reading too much into it...she touched your leg, so what? Wait and see if she tries to kiss you before you say anything.

There is no dilemma here because he doesn't want you, so sorry, but you're pining after something that's never going to happen.  Once a man doesn't want you, he typically doesn't change his mind.

Chances are that it'll end up being the same with arguing and yelling. Instead, show a bit of interest in him at a time. Make him chase you instead of just grab you back to the same place. If he really WANTS to go after you, then you gain the right position. Remember, a man is the head in the relationship, but a woman is the neck that turns the head in the right direction. If you're able to direct your relationship where you want, then you probably won't argue as much.   good luck!|`|e746b739b6ea9d9f5c2d7c17780a1878aa	stay single until you know what you want next time.|`|AA10318939	well its hard to say babe...i mean...just see who u LOVE the most and wanna be with the most..THERE HAS To be one of them that u like more than the other! SO choose him iN MY OPINION ok|`|9c5d199632daf00d5672fd58255cec1caa	Why did the 1st relationship end? Ask yourselves these questions. Who is the one you want to be with. Who are you thinking about?  When you lay your head down at night which one crosses your mind? Who do you see yourself with in 5 yrs? It sounds like you've been unfair to W because you've had D in your heart? Is that fair to him???? Just lay it all out and decide which one makes you a better person? Whom would you rather be with. It's all the help I can give. I can't make the decision for you ! Good Luck!|`|6df95359670f99d201fc033d9518cd87aa	he's an ex for a reason.  don't go back|`|221b27dc2502e722580b9a30a39af9acaa	Yes, go back with the ex, because he is still on your mind and you can't begin a new relationship and make it work until you have closed the book on the old one.  It will always be a shadow between you and the new guy.|`|AA11927279	Sit down with a piece of paper and write all the pros and cons of each relationship, and maybe this will help you figure out what was missing from the one.

I thought that you guys had such a good time together. I think you are the only one who can answer this question. If u still have feelings for your ex ex(D), then i think you should get back with him, dont just date someone while ur heart belongs to someone else because u will be the one who ends up hurting the most.

Life, if on the right path (pure and true to ones self and others) than everything else fills in.  You don't need anything right now.  What you are attracted to are the qualities you are looking for in a man.  Each man you meet will have something you want.  Eventually you will meet a man that has each of everything.  If you tie yourself up now you may miss him tommorrow.  If you aren't in a rush to be bound, then hang tight for a bit.  It won't kill you to be single.  It never does.|`|22be5faed0c844a0c4a17a6b9438e176aa	Sounds to me as if you have got yourself in a right pickle.Lets start with D,now you were with this man for 2yrs but it was fiery so hence why it did not last,those kind of relationships are good to begin with,excitement and the thrill of not knowing what emotion is gonna happen next....but after a while you want to settle down and grow up abit,have an adult relationship.Now this W person was the opposite he was Mr dependable,somebody you instantly knew could bring a stable future and relationship but not the thrill of D.If i was in your shoes personally i would go for Mr dependable W because after a while Mr thrill D would eventually wear me down.hope that's helped a little.......good luck.

AA10784641	Of Course. Just keep in mind that it is human nature to love something and want something that you don't have. So you are going to be allured more by an old boyfriend that you once had, that you now fantasize about than your overweight husband who is currently snoring on the couch. But if you lost that same  husband to an untimely death such as cancer or an auto accident. Suddenly, he would be the one you idolize cause you can't have it. Get it? Human nature is a funny thing.

cZVETaDLaa	Well I think were both the same. I am also afraid being on my own with my two kids. And like you said that is what is holding me back. Me and my husband argue all the time. I want to be a better wife but when I try it seems to get worse.For the same with me I did not finished high school but I am trying to get my GED and hopefully I get a small career to fall back on. So maybe you should go for your GED. It will encourage you more and maybe you can go to a community college part time and work full time. We have to be strong we can do it. Well maybe you can write me back since we have a lot in common. I hope things work out for you. God Bless...|`|1b771d8c5ecb7cf9ea18297c6a0bf6f7aa	You have to get on your own two feet by getting a job and stashing away some cash. Do this as soon as possible.    And you say your family is wealthy, so I would consider asking for temporary help in the form of a loan or a place to stay. I know you say you can't involve them and want to do it all on your own, but don't let foolish pride get in the way of your freedom and happiness. Good luck.|`|AA11996507	Of course you can make it.  You're never too old to expand your education and skills.  And a restraining order will take care of him.|`|AA11317411	If you're fed up with your husband emotionally, then leave. No money in the world can buy true love. The world is a harsh place, show it that you're a strong and independent woman!|`|8376bdc87fccc5f06632449f618f2e8eaa	The bible says: I have not given you a spirit of fear, but a spirit of boldness. So, we know that the fear you are feeling is from the devil, who wants you to remain in bondage. I can't tell you whether to end your marriage, but I can tell you, if your life is in danger, that is a pretty damn good reason to! I don't understand why you can't go to your family (what family wouldn't help a daugher in danger?), so I would encourage you to call them and ask for help. If not, seek help from a friend. If there is no one close, call your local shelter (if you have internet, you can search out places on the internet). But, before you leave your husband, make sure what you want to is FINAL. There is no going back and there is no changing your family's mind about him once you confess to them what is going on. I don't believe you should fear anyone in this world. Gather strength from God, who is stronger than ANY person or enemy in this world!|`|73868e15f1e5aa2ed714d155caee7577aa	Just take it step by step physically (getting rid/selling little things you don't want on Ebay or a garage sale).  Take it step by step emotionally gradually too. --I'd definately secretly get some emotional help whether voicing out your troubles w/a pastor or therapist, ideally BOTH. You want to build yourself up as much as possible. Do you want to leave right away or can you willingly plan it out better by staying a little while, while you work to save some money? Do you need a financial safety net to fall back on? Maybe a relative or two would help you, when your starting out. Plus you could work and have the best of both worlds saving cash in the bank.  Develop the best that you can and prepare yourself on all levels before you make your move. If your in a dangerous situation (and I sure hope not!)--perhaps get away far away and stay w/a friend or relative. Work on your confidence by reading self-help books, listen to self-enrichment cd's too. By getting confident you need to get active. That's the only way to build this treasure within. People just aren't born that way, they become this way and there's many ways to have it too, everyone's different.  I understand your scared. But isn't it scarier in a way to keep living a lie? Your life is worth a lot more than this. ANd you really definately deserve to be happy and have peace within. If you'd like someone to email, you may email me. It's right on my account on yahoo Q&A.

If you don't love him that's o.k but you have to have some respect for him, I mean you have to tell him everything, including reason why you are not leaving yet and start looking for job, as soon as you find one you can leave. If he's kind of person that you know that will not understand you, than don't tell him anything, just start looking for job, even with minimum salary at the beginning, just enough to rent house and to buy food.

My grandson is 2 1/2 and my son (age 20) and grandson lives in our home.  They moved in last June.   I take care of my grandson most of the time.  Some times my son gets mad at me for one reason or another and tells me he thinks I am to strict with my grandson.  He thinks that my routine with him is silly.  As he says Change it up a little.  Its hard to know when to step in and take care of him and when to butt out.  Its a no win situation sometimes.   When my son is home he spends most of the time in his room and the grandson stays in the living room with us.  so of course I take care of his needs and get on to him when he is doing something bad.

dd1f927248c50b7511137071de2458a5aa	When in a free relationship, you don't worry about classifications and such. You just live life with the person whom you choose. You feel free and more at comfort when it comes down to it.     The moment when the marriage carpet rolls in, its a completely different feel.  To be technically someone's possession can bring a big downer down to the relationship.     Personally speaking, the idea of marriage is nice but it gives you the impression of being trapped. Plus sinking 10 000$ for a ceremony cuts deep into the pockets. I'd just like to live my life with my love without worry of this.

Por lo que dices, crees que es lo mejor que has tenido en tu vida en cuestion de novios y sientes que no puedes darte el lujo de perderlo, eso te desepera y siempre quieres agradarlo y lo sofocas con teatros y celos infundados que no son mas que sintoma de que te sintes insegura y vulnerable pues sientes que todos lo ven como lo ves tu y te lo van a bajar en cualquier lugar y a cualquier hora. Y mas al querer compararte con sus ex novias que han sido segun tu, 'mas bonitas'. si sigues asi te va a odiar. te lo aseguro.

Preparada, alla vamos    Tips para RECONQUISTAR alguien que aman,   o mejor dicho plan de ataque con todo para detectar encontrar, retener y detectar los signos del amor en el 2007 (el amor propio y de pareja).    No te conozco pero vale hacer una advertencia antes de empezar.    Siempre ten un plan B (desintoxicarte del supuesto amor que le profesas) por si falla todo lo que a continuacin te comento    Autoevala y pregntate:  *Vale la pena? el re-conquistar a tu ser amado o es mejor concentrarte en el que te merece "el mejor esta por venir, buscalo mejor y no lo dejes escapar".    * Detecta las principales barreras que tengas a la vista o que aun no te has enterado que tienes (posibles rivales e intereses que le quitan esa atencin que tanto pides, te suena familiar "amigos-as", ex, parientes, etc)    *Reconoce el terreno actual de la batalla (porque te gusta, que hace, que te dice, sus intereses actuales, anteriores y nuevas conquistas, "amigos-as" en comn que te informen sus pasos, es mas duda de toda informacin no solicitada, reconoce el lenguaje no verbal para saber que es coherente lo que dice y lo que hace)     *Antecedentes que paso antes que rompieran (de tu parte que puedes mejorar y de parte del amado como te trat y a lo mejor lo perdonaste, sin tomar en cuenta esos peque?os grandes detalles que te indican si esta o no interesado en seguir contigo)    Primero comienza por verte y sentirte bien. Concete, detecta y cambia aquello que lo aleja  * Vestidos, jeans, bolsas, color de cabello, maquillaje acorde a tu color de piel  * Realiza alguna actividad que te permita sacar toda la energa y mantenerte en forma  * Date un tiempo para pensar en otras amistades y pedir retroalimentacin sobre como eres y que te recomiendan para reconquistar a ese amore    Segundo realiza un perfil de tu amado (conquistador, dominante, machin, tmido, intelectual, reventado, hijo de mami, mentiroso compulsivo, inmaduro, super interesado) este es un estudio detallado de cmo piensa, que hace, donde frecuenta. Si sabes como es sabrs que botn tocar para que avance o se detenga en este toma y daka de la vida.    Tercero realiza un plan detallado con fechas y acciones a seguir para que parezca lo mas casual aquello que pongas en prctica.    a)Detalles lindos: Reglale aquella msica que el muere por conseguir, aydale con aquel proyecto que tanto te ha platicado pero no sabe por donde empezar  b)Sorpresas: Asiste casualmente a las fiestas que el vaya, ve los juegos que el desea ver o asistir, salidas al campo.  c)cosa romntica: Dulces, recados, notas, emails, mensajes al celular,  d)Intimidad: Si es necesario planea un entorno romntico y apartado de las distracciones para seducirlo con un buen vino, tabaco y aperitivos que le indiquen que estas a punto de caer pero que el se crea el conquistador.  e)Perversa.- Puedes hacer todo lo contrario a lo que venimos hablando como: Darle celos, ignorarlo, colgarle, hacerle psicologa inversa, lo que ustedes llaman tratarlo con la punta de las zapatillas. A veces les gusta y regresan por mas (hijos de la mala vida)  f)Original.- Piensa que le llama la atencin y consguele aquello que muere por tener uno igual, resulvele un poco la vida y veras como cambia su trato e inters por ti.  g) dile lo que no funciona y lo que quieres ANTES de que vuelvan y asi dejar de una vez por todas en claro para que no se repita el mismo ciclo de victima y victimario.    Recuerda que todo esto es si VALE LA PENA o no esa persona y no te obligan a ser otra a quien tu eres, que no te maltraten y tengas que perder tu identidad o dignidad. No se le ruega ni se rebaja una persona que sabe lo que vale.    Fin. No mas rollos y feliz 2007.    Que gane el mejor y que obtengas aquel amor tan codiciado.|`|594ca6b833b7d473290b5eeed5d6e5e6aa	para que se vuelva loco por ti debes dejar tus inseguridades  a un lado ....y no esperar gestos , que tu misma consideras cursi|`|a8936673e073f3195b44215d24cdc8d9aa	sacate la ropa y dale un buen sacudon general......ma.mada incluida|`|d1374dc2b0f9c4a076683541fa0a4797aa	?Sabes cmo volver loco a un hombre en la cama? - Escndele el control remoto de la tele.

AA11331190	Sounds like he wants easy females and found out you were not easy. Too much work for the only thing he wants.  He doesn't want a relationship with you by the sound of it.  If he's talking to other females and ignoring you he isnt worth bothering and worrying over.  Hes a disrepectful punk and always will be.|`|WjNIz531aa	the reason is because when he found out that u wasn't goin to have sex with him he had no use 4 u any more. And when he asked u if u loved him he was trying 2 c if he had u wraped around his fingure he wanted to make a fool of u and 2 c how far u would go in such a short amount of time it was all a game to him he mite have said really sweet things but he was lieing and when yall broke up he didnt like you anymore and then once he realized how gulable u was he decided to take advantage of that so he is a total ASSSSSSSSS!!!  TRUST ME just forget about him k bye|`|babae433a3a1cd282d8817b6ec17b7d6aa	Seems like he wants sex but no commitment. He backed out of the relationship, but wants you available if he needs you. Hes probably looking for a **** buddy, but preferably not you as there are too many issues involved. Please avoid this. I did the **** buddy thing thinking I was fine with it, telling myself I didnt care about the guy. You will get hurt. You are worth more than this. XXX be strong please.
EiW6ocewaa	it costs a lot to forget about a guy u love, but don't be selfish, she probably want him bore than you want, also she's your friend, dont mess ur friendship for a boy,also is a friend, tell her how do u feel about this guy, and then things will get by themselves|`|AA12169870	Ok  Al...You're a girl with a guy avatar....hmmnn....Are you a hermaphrodite?

You just busted her sending an aim message regarding her wish to have another girls night out.  What are your gut feelings?  If your gut feeling is she's NOT being honest with you, she probably isn't.  ALWAYS LISTEN TO YOUR GUT FEELINGS.
10cdf10f848ef9d1de57ac51286432d6aa	depends what you mean by hassle? if its texting/ringing etci would say that ive learned after putting up with this type of harrassment for 8 years is to totally blank him, do not answer phone or door do not reply to texts just pretend he doesnt exist, he wants to provoke a reaction from you and if you dont give it it becomes futile for him.    obviously if its violence or verbal abuse you need to keep a record and get a restraining order. i would say keep a record anyway because if you involve the police a few times they will prosecute him for harrasment which doesnt cost you anything as a opposed to filing for an order yourself.|`|168ae74e67cbd6881466c67b965f8c01aa	buy a gun and let him see you with it, or a water pistol that looks real from a distance, restraining order,|`|524c0d2e4d7aefb801e47fb343558551aa	the only way to go is put a restraining order out on him,when he contacts you send his butt to the can.|`|e333b36169b055181dd989efc08d2e0baa	Be firm with him do  n ot give him any hope that you are warming towards him, change your phone numbers etc. If you can move do so, contact the police to get it on record that he is hassling you in case he is violent towards you. Can you move jobs, home etc. anything to get away, if you get another boyfriend he will still always be there. A retraining order sounds like the best thing. Good luck|`|xVMP0QVJaa	tell him to get a life stop been a sado he had his day now move on or get him removed ie get new man to have quite word privatly|`|AA10699735	i would say move change your number but don't keep someone harassing you like that. i would say to tell him to stop but some people don listen do they so i think you should get a new address and move you can always do that.|`|RchxHpuhaa	i think you should give him an audience  for you to know his mind.and if you believe he is not up to your expectation then maybe you should convince him im sure he will reason with you.|`|3c3078407b95fd87c53987fba10056c0aa	Get a restraining order.      Or put arsenic in his coffee, that works well too.|`|22be5faed0c844a0c4a17a6b9438e176aa	Obviously your ex is not getting the message that its over and your moving on.Best course of action get a restraining order against him.Write down and log every nuisance call or message he leaves,if you have caller id on your home phone number and your mobile then let it go to answer machine as all of this will help when you go to the police with concrete evidence that he is harassing you.Its not nice being a victim of harassment or stalking so make sure the police listen to you and that you want something done.Might i also suggest that if things carry on you ask a male friend to stay over for a while until all of this calms down especially if you have young children for yours and there safety............good luck.|`|AA10242125	Get a restraining order.
169a37b1a84a23b6da836db1738dd985aa	Just straight out flat ask him. That's the simplest way. You can go up to him or something in the halls and pop the question. Stop stressing over this its not getting you anywhere so get it off your chest already! Got for it! What have you got to lose? If he says no then you guys can still remain friends anyway. Its simple. And it seems like it wasnt that hard in the first place once you do it. So get it over with your not getting anywhere sitting on the computer asking how to ask him out!   Hope this helps, best of luck!|`|GxfSZyE3aa	just jokingly be like so if i told you i liked you what would you do?!!? and if he says back haha or soemthign then that means its too akward to answer and if he says i might ask you out or something then there you go..no harm there.|`|67466c78d63c531282edf12f30416892aa	well first, hav get someone 2 find out wether he's available or not..

rK6oPxt0aa	I think you're both being too careful around each other now.  When there was nothing to lose you didn't have any trouble talking to her.  I get the feeling she may feel the same way.    Don't treat her as if she's going to melt if you say or do something wrong.  Maybe she'll catch on and do the same.  Then you'll have your old friend back.|`|3122ae6f8b98a3cf8f31941e30e7d8deaa	don,t keep her|`|N6BpDKSwaa	well, maybe now that she knows that you like her, she might feel uncomfortable with it, just try to act llike a friend and get close again, then make your move when you think things are back to normal, and if things dont work out, move on!|`|67466c78d63c531282edf12f30416892aa	wow..well maybe..iono...im not a people-person..des symptoms are jus 2 weird 4 me 2 say..lol..well iono..maybe she were disguisted or havin 2nd thought.. maybe she dont wanna lead u on, cus of somein..|`|f1ec78bc328e6eab3355ffa75d716025aa	Ok, well maybe shes shy. When you guys talked about hanging out and stuff im guessing she felt comfortable talking to you. Now that you guys havent talked for a while and no new plans are made she is afraid to say somthing. If thats not the case she might not know what to say to you. Ask her out again but this time with a group of your and her friends. That will make her feel comfortable and maybe spark some new conversations in french class.|`|8ab981546c5c85cbaefe3aa68d486933aa	im in the same f'ing situation...keep talking to her man. be funny, girls like a guy with a sense of humor. if you have your own car, then your in the bag man. ladies love a guy who can drive them to the mall|`|AA11831425	there is only one thing to do, though you did not go out with her yet, but the best thing is to talk to her and tell her that you miss talking to her and as you say miss her smile , just remember not to change your talking styl with her and always be sensetive and romantic
005a9dec26e573113e2eee596c25e980aa	I tell my friends that I love them all the time.  If you feel that it may be recieved in a way that it is not intended, I would not say it.  You also do not want to do anything that would offend the spouse or cause issue in their marriage.  Some people aren't comfortable with "I love you" and think you can only love someone in a romantic way.|`|d57e29c219b565c305798b1e32e4886faa	Since I love my friends like family you bet I tell them that I love them.

I usually say "I love you" to my sisters, mother, but not to a guy friend, and I have guy friend for 18 years, and in a "sister" kind of way, I truly love them, but it would be weird to say those words, being that I am married, and so are they.|`|C8qtZwsjaa	There is a different in who you want to say "I Love You" to and it is also depend upon how the other person will perceived.  Maybe you could look up the thesaurus for "Love" and use the synonyms|`|AA11885249	i would, especially if we have been friends for a while. i'm sure when my friends get married i will still say i love you to them.|`|HXVN8CgZaa	No, they shouldn't.  People who are married protect their partner, and if this makes you uncomfortable, let him know right away.  If he says you are over-reacting, tell him that may be true, but you still don't like it and really wish he would stop that.  Honestly, he probably thinks its flirty and cute, and now it needs to end.|`|5472912519051908ed850d6ecdf22934aa	Well, right when they're screwing they do.    In front of the spouse, no. But when they are making The Beast With Two Backs, yes, they do.     Isn't that what makes the world bearable for them - their secret affair filled with drama and romance?|`|YTqrEe4Haa	Only if you're drunk i.e. "I LOVE YOU MAAN!"|`|AA10666000	yes....i tell people that i love them    what if tomorrow never comes, i want them to remember that i loved them
cebea3a8e8113acc7b540c298907a6c7aa	Ball and chain   20th century slang term, meaning wife.    Origin    The allusion being to the presumption that a man's wife held him back from doing the things he really wanted to. This, of course, refers back to the actual ball and chain, which was a heavy metal ball, secured to a prisoner's leg by means of a chain and manacle. The ball and chain was in use in both Britain and the USA by the early 19th century (and possibly much earlier). The earliest citation in print is from The Times, January 1819:    Actually I was thinking it goes back farther than that! My great great great grand father used it in one of his letters back in late 1600's. Possible pirate origins. I'm thinking possibly Capt. Anstis of the "Good Fortune"|`|b278d0795f6a4fb95e99a928fdb3a974aa	just type in "Origin: ball and chain" into google.  there are several sites that can give the origins of many phrases|`|AA10666000	They are biker phrases that have become popular.

I'm sure he has no idea how you are feeling. If he is loving I am sure he will understand and reassure you. You don't want past relationships to ruin what you have.|`|5ElpcLVxaa	this is really hard and depends on you alone. with time you will come to trust him more and more and eventually these feelings will go away. make sure he is aware of your feelings, stress the fact that it isnt him, just your past experiences that make you feel this way. he should understand and try and make it easier for you. just be honest with him and yourself and give yourself time honey.|`|8da08eaa84fd5c7769feb240d4d1bdf3aa	If there is no trust in your marraige then there is no real marriage.

It was his first serious one. If you find that the trust issue and jealousy is really eating you up then you could always try hypnotherapy, it worked for him. After all he has given you no reason to distrust him.|`|948ba76f763d3c756a7d698e9062c21caa	Quit looking at others and other relationships.  Just focus on this one.  Has HE given you any reason to not trust him?  Is he faithful?  Does he take care of you and love you?  That's all that matters, You don't say how long you've been married but my husband was divorced when we met and after we were married he also had such issues.  It took time and patience and me often telling him I wasn't going anywhere and that I loved HIM until he finally seemed to lose that distrust.  Now we are happily married with four children and I make sure he has no desire to look elsewhere because he is happy and satisfied at HOME!|`|vh6aXH7eaa	if he has not cheated he has not cheated do not blame him for the faults of others I am a 52 year old single male I would like a partner but I do not want to cop it for the previous ones
RrPoISrMaa	Yes and that is a very painful situation to be in. If there is really no chance the two of you can be together, than to have a chance at sharing a love with someone, you first need to accept the fact that you love this person that is unavailable to you.    After accepting that part, give yourself time to mourn the situation to validate your feelings. Avoid getting stuck at that place however, because then you are keeping yourself from moving  on and being open to new opportunities for love, which can be a safe, but very lonley position to be in.    Life is too short to do that, and sharing and receiving love with a partner is a precious thing that makes life much better, and gives meaning to both your lives. Good luck, and I'm sorry to hear that you fell in love with someone you can't have.|`|AA10572585	Sure. Hopefully that love lies dormant over time. You may never lose it, but you will be able to continue to live your own life.|`|1a224f3c589d38a106124e6002598931aa	Well, there is an expression: Love conquers all. Two people in real love should be able to communicate, compromise and work together to solve any problems. So, I think the answer should be no. However, if one of the them is not willing to work on the situation, then yes.|`|c0bHCZ7Xaa	yes stang it is posible and it happend more often that what u think lot of us love someone and have to let them go 4 one reson or other soo it is hard bu tif u can get that chance of one touch one look once in a while it can fill u up|`|a970dd077d350edbb0333b950832956eaa	yes i wasted 6yrs of my life on a guy just to end up heart broken dont sit around n wait for ne one cuz it never pays off in the long run|`|6486d805c7376b91ac13c160d1845727aa	Yes, and it's the most painful heartache that never heals and everlasting flame that seems to never burn out.   :-(|`|yBhh63gUaa	yes,love is unconditional..it comes without been invited and go unwillingly..it doesnt mean that if u are in love,u have to be together..sometimes u just been destined to be in love with not to live together..so,sometimes u just unable to share your life with that person as u were not destined to be together.,|`|xZfd6fvWaa	Yes I was ....I always regretted it.    It's the most painful thing in love that can happen..|`|b3e18ba566904d719867a7b03e4a68c6aa	uuhh yeah. get over it|`|b764b7d24f9f95edf15050be9bafd1daaa	yes it is possible. it happens all the time|`|M2NYCktBaa	oh yes it happens|`|AA11554727	don't think so...|`|AA11583035	Yes,  but the love will fade and at best the love will not be relevant anymore.|`|AA11124925	Yes, and sometimes it's for the best that way|`|oX6eoEopaa	yeah....this is possible especially if the person already has commitment to another|`|vCmcYk98aa	yes....that happens to most peoples...    There is a Latin proverb about love"love is a bit of sighing,a bit of crying,a bit of dying,and a good deal of lying."

First you CHOOSE to not be jelous (reguardless of weather or not you FEEL jelous), then act on it in that way... the feelings will slowly follow suit. Prayer in this direction will also put you in the right attitude.   Good luck!|`|KkOnaWV5aa	Find the source.  Not what caused you to be jealous, but exactly what jealousy is.  It's a mix of different emotions, anger, pain, sadness, fear... and determine each of those and what about the situation causes those feelings.  If say you have a gf/bf, and they cause you to become jealous simply by glancing at another person, then most likely your insecurity causes fear of losing him, irrationally to someone he doesn't know by name, hasn't seen before, and likely will never see again, or even remember that person in an hour.  Anger, pain, sadness.... they can come from your best friend going out with someone you admire.  Most of these feelings can be thought through, until you realize that they are coming together to create a complex poison that is eating you up inside.|`|AA11560508	Through prayer.|`|cb91f0c02e924c03ced26e79ea280ed9aa	You realize what a waste of time it is to be jealous and how destructive it can be. Being jealous points to personal issues within yourself and these need to be addressed soon or else they'll just get worse and one day you'll realize how silly and immature you behaved by being jealous. You need to figure out why you're so jealous and you need to concentrate on the positive aspects of yourself and what you have to offer someone. You have to realize that there is ALWAYS someone out there BETTER looking, more talented, more intelligent, etc...but YOU are also better at some of these things than some people out there. So...do things to improve yourself to be where you want to be content with yourself and not jealous. When you accept things you can't change about yourself and work on improving what you can, then you learn to have "peace" within. You feel good about yourself and that if someone doesn't appreciate you for all of these good qualities, then it's their loss or bad timing or maybe they don't think you're their idea of what will make them happy (no matter what you do or change). So, don't be jealous. It's a total waste of time and emotions. It's not very attractive to someone else if you're a jealous person. Remember this and remember the thing I told you about there always being someone better at this or that...because that will always be the case and this will never change. The better you become...there will still be someone better at whatever it is you're thinking of. So, learn to be happy with yourself and with others and you'll get rid of those jealous feelings.|`|AA12241934	You grow up!|`|7mZA2cSraa	yeah... i broke up w/ my bf... and he is allways flrting w/ all ths girls ... ahhh.. i hate that...|`|84d1ac18f43cad75e58413e5b2f581a5aa	Why would one want to? If you are feeling jealous there is a reason for it.
AA11541176	well start with normal kissing...then slightly turn your head to the left (or right docent matter) then as you have turn slightly open your lips so it well seem like you want to suck his lips...so your partner is going to do the same thing (his going to turn his head, and open his mouth) so take out your young only about an inch...and touch his..when you touch his tongue so tend to wrap your tongue around his or just move around his tongue ...oh yeah...do this slowly...not to slow..but slowly....then the way you could finish it is by just pull out your tongue really slowly and start closing your lips and back of slightly...and the best way to end it is by giving him a small kiss once ur done...like right after he closes his mouth. just kiss him...hope i helped...|`|yiqqHovFaa	trust me, hun, whatever u do with ur tongue, ur guy will love it! just go with the flow; youll soon find what works for you. and to end it simply close your mouth and/or pull your head away. trust me, ur guy will go crazy over you, whatever you do1|`|Mf7mrRqraa	well if you don`t know what to do ,this tells  me you are too young for this step in you sexuall revolution,give it time you will learn many things,rent a porno this is a good place to start ....|`|be3c2b7f248402b7a17505df96118197aa	WOW! ii remember my first kiss. i thought the same things you did. i tried to avoid it..but dont turn ur head.

Nothing to be scared about.|`|79021a61b2485597895a8b7c76eff4c4aa	WELL ur supposed to write ur name is cursive with ur tongue and if u mess up u start over and when u get it right ur done!!  (its almost impossible not to mess up though...)|`|QfvpHdz6aa	Haha this is a funny one. When you french kiss like swirl your tounge around his/ hers, gently bite his/her tounge, then kinda go into a makeout. You end it by pulling gently apart. That's what worked for me.
AA10481841	I would definatly say she likes you. If a girl tells you she misses you and thinks about you a lot that must mean something...right?? I think she likes you a lot and maybe has a boyfriend just because she feels like if you want her you would come after her...or maybe she is just really insecure. Talk to her about how you feel. I BET she feels the same. Good Luck|`|AA10791200	the question here is= does she like u as friend or as a man, the touching u really does'nt mean a lot (yes and no), you need to level w/her an let her know your true feelings, but also explain u do not want to loose the frienship if that's all it is, don't be afraid, what are friends for?                                                         good luck|`|Rtn8kXsAaa	Sometime when you are talking with her, casually ask 'if you was to ever break up with _____, do you think we could go out sometime'?

She has got the bad relationship syndrome. I would step back and tell her to go talk to him. To tell her how you feel you would come between him and her and then when  she is unhappy with you she will run to some one else. It's the typical thing, you can ask any one who has been on the same side as you.|`|qVMg9YRsaa	HAHAHAHAHAHAHA....you can tell her, BUT you are risking the chance of her not wanting to hang out with or the chance of her liking you back. I don't know if I would tell her while she was in a relationship because you could complicate her life. And a real friend would never want to do that, right? So just play it cool. I say that you can do more with actions then words ever could so keep hanging out and see what happens...|`|9ea5e8dd576fe0621bb8f8f8c17c8e7baa	Hi! Well, its clear that you both like each other's company.  If you DONT tell her, are you ready to live with this? Always thinking about her.....but never having her!   I totally suggest you to talk to her....tell her that you really like her and now it seems that if you continue this relationship with he, you will expect more out of the relationship so.....tell her that a decision needs to be made....cut down on the time you spend together .. so your feelings dont grow anymore for her since she does have a boyfriend. She should then, tell you how she feels about this. Go!Go!Go!|`|076d822de74d40ed78184f8ff01c59d8aa	Its sounds like shes blowin that guy and diggin you boy.

b819707f13385bf4c86b70445289cf03aa	Here's what you should do, after spending some time with her on a night    Start talking and after a while lightly touch her hair for a couple seconds and tell her  that her hair is soft, after that keep talking, then do that hair touching thing again and then look at her lips and go in for the kiss    The key is her reaction to you touching her hair a little sensually, if she likes it then she likes you and will wait for a kiss from you,     God I'm good|`|FUd6tIpLaa	JUST ASK HER OUT|`|ac12e148951d27b70c4acc8a50cc662faa	ik you asked girls but you will know when the time is right it is something that just happens|`|023edcc7f48aacbfb80d82d856f1463eaa	green light! go ahead just do it|`|AA11312293	You haven't said that you've actually gone on a date with her, so I'd say that's step number one.    If she agrees and the date goes well (look for little signs, do not drive too deep into the meaning of anything or obsess over detail) then take her somewhere at the end of the night were you have semi-privacy (park, roof of building, be creative) and simply wait until the right moment comes. And if the right moment isn't coming, make it yourself. Compliments are a good way to go, especially when cleverly worked into a conversation.     Whatever happens- do not ask if you can kiss her! Nothing ruins the moment quite so fast as that.    From the sounds of it, the worst that could happen is she could tell you she doesn't like you like that- in which case feel free to be angry at her for leading you on by accpeting the date in the first place.     Otherwise- I'm told unwrapping starbusts with your tongue makes you a better kisser.|`|xpgRr8WDaa	My signal for when I want a guy to kiss me is staring straight into his eyes and giving him a soft smile.     Be bold.|`|Zs3uusoeaa	if she wont quit lookin you in the eyes she wants you to kiss her
AA10704364	He is vengeful and vindictive.    Does he go to a church?  If so, ask the spiritual leader to intervene on your behalf.    But, the best antidote for this kind of behaviour is, believe it or not, to pray for him.  Pray for him to have everything that you would want for yourself or your daughter.  Health, happiness, harmony, wealth, peace of mind, all the good things.  Even if you don't mean it, do it anyway, do it every day for at least ten days.  You will find that you will begin to feel differently about him, and perhaps G-d will take a hand and help your relationship with him to improve.    What have you got to lose?|`|AA10354968	First good for you to leave him. No one should be in an abusive relationship. Second because you left him he has no other way to hurt you but to do what he is doing. He know that it hurts you that he keeps taking you to court for little things and he will keep doing it until he gets tired of it or you stop caring that he is doing it. He knows money is tight for you and not paying for his child is making it tighter. As a parent you want to protect her. But stop sending clothes with her when she goes to his house. He has money and he can go buy her clothes. Plus he has the ones that you have already sent.   The only thing that I can tell you is that when she gets older she will remember the things he has put you through and he is the one that has to explain it to her.|`|AA10789336	This proves, just because you have an degree you are not necessarily smart.  It is his daughter, be happy she has a nice place to stay..  Stop complaining and act as everything is A-OK.  Let him see her any time he wants, she will always be his daughter (be happy he acknowledges her).  Have the damn furniture delivered to his door step.  Give him time to cool down.|`|AA10208217	crazy ,selfish you need to be telling this abuse to a lawyer or a judge just in case protect your daughter just to be on the safe side of things you know he sounds like a real wack job.

This hot hot guy started walking over to us,  so she said look he coming to talk to you and when he got to us he asked for her number not mine so just cuz you think they are prettier then you,  doesn't meant that everyone does.

If her friends are prettier then her then why not try to get with one of her friends??  =]|`|AA10287707	probably not mainly cause im not a lesbo and have a boyfriend!|`|Hprq2zwoaa	noi dated a girl like that yesterday it only lasted an hour. im dead serious not even jokingg except she didnt have glasses and her friends were equal to her not prettier but she was short and a ***** kinda like what u described|`|dJ7aHATmaa	sounds like my girlfriend, however the last part is of no comment|`|BD8UAzqIaa	i think that person should think about it because there are girls out there like her that really love someone and also there are girls prettier than her that don't care about the guy, they only care if they got money, a job and a nice car.|`|zmgIQKY8aa	wear tight *** panta and a tank top to school  skirts wooks wear a thong gramma pantys are the worst you can do|`|XnRIof5eaa	If I were into girls... Absolutely. As long as she stays interesting! Which it sounds like she would be since she is a free spirit and she wants to a guy to chase her. As long as shes not boring, and willing to let someone control her.     I'm sure a lot of guys would like to date her :)|`|AA11497473	If I were a guy, probably. It sounds like she has her own mind and class. Who wants a girl that lets her friends control her and throws herself on guys??|`|u7LSohRyaa	I'm not a guy but I can see it happening for you.  I'd change the way I act around guys.  There's a difference between a flirt and just being approachable.  Guys like strong, intelligent women with a good sense of humor to break up any tense moments.  You wouldn't want a guy that wants someone weak and clingy. Guys that just want a pretty girl might be shallow. It's good for you to have your own life and not dependant but remember to be a team player when you meet the right guy.|`|9S1ZSAhQaa	Probably.|`|t0o6QzXkaa	As long as she's a good person,then yes.|`|d13f689ebc45e6c194596076588d3b58aa	i would if she was a nice person and had some looks about her|`|6kMp7IoJaa	yes i will. if i think you and me have some cnnection then he!! yea!
IayyNAfgaa	i don't know how good of friends you are but i think that you should tell her.. It's wrong to keep stuff like that from your friends. I probably is going to bother you everytime you go over there. And as for her brother well if you tell her he might back off a bit. Just tell her it happened once and that you felt really guilty and couldn't bring yourself to tell her. Tell her what happened in not alot of detail, just so she gets the point. Tell her that it won't happen again b/c you don't have any feelings for her brother and if you had to go back you'd rather have not done it anyway.. I know this is going to hurt her, but as a friend you should respect that you'd want to know if the whole thing was turned around.|`|AA10368751	I would just go on with your life.  Stuff happens, in your case you got drunk and got laid for no reason.
AA10851748	I think she likes you a little try flirting with her if you cant then maybe you can ask a friend to find out for you but make sure its your best friend.|`|AA10426171	she likes you - take a chance man for once grab the bull by the horns - ASK HER OUT TWIT!!!|`|0u9gguq7aa	Well obviously she likes you ask her out dont be shy about it and dont waste time.|`|604b1db06e9e18ea9a80e63486707d2eaa	if you really like her ask her out i mean dont be afraid if rejection. whats the worst thing that can happen|`|67466c78d63c531282edf12f30416892aa	we'll im not a guy, popular, loser, or have time to look at ur other "DOZEN SIGNS", but here's a thought, how bout ASK her wassup..set things out u kno? i mean if u not a TOTAL loser, den u'll get a chance .|`|M1lyOo1naa	Lol...you're so cute. Don't worry, I'm 36...I'm just remembering back to the days of high school :)    Teenage girls are a quandry...I certainly was! I played boys so badddd...I'm sorry for that now, because some of those boys turned out to be wonderful men...    Anyways, she has already made the first move(s). It's up to you now! Just go for it! The both of you will be relieved when it's finally out in the open...ASK...HER...OUT!    Whisper it to her in gym when she sits next to you...or get her someplace alone, and just do it!    Girls like guys with balls. It's that simple. If you don't ask her out soon...she's going to take it as a sign that you're not interested and she'll move on.    Best of luck to you!!|`|wJ0EbT9Yaa	It has been a while ,but when i was in high school i was Very popular and known for being "COOL",THE "IN"croud was me and everyone wanted to be my friend.Just because you are not as popular as this girl does not make you less of a person.

Really because of age i wouldnt think she would exept you. Just go for someone your own age and be yourself. Just be friends with this 21 year old. But really I dont think this is love for you to. You have a better chance with a 16 or 15 or 17 year old!
kTPIFRK4aa	I would not let her go and basically the lady I am with in a relationship has to be confident of herself, warm personality and be spontaneous.|`|AA10368751	Doing it 3 times a day and the girls be total s!ut around only you and she tells you to do stuff to her while doing it.

If you see that he is getting too harsh on you tell the police  and always watch your back if you think things with him are getting crazy around you file a police report . and do not walk alone or have some type of pepper spray  or even a whistle.    be safe be well god bless
KrOXppXEaa	Look, he didn't cheat on you cause you wouldn't have sex with him right away.  That's just what he told you, cause he wants you to feel like it is somehow your fault that he is a jerk who can't make a commitment.  If monogamy in a relationship is important to you, dump him now, before you fall any more in love with this poo.  Sometimes our hearts just don't make the right choices.  Don't take him back!  You'll thank yourself later when you see him cheating on his next gf.|`|AA12177586	Ask yourself this question. If he cheated on you, does he love you?|`|AA10025651	as the saying goes "once a cheater, always a cheater"...my girlfriend cheated on me and i took her back, then she did it again later on...stay away from him|`|MBlYcuJVaa	If he doesn't respect you enough to wait for you, then he doesn't deserve to be with you.

ZW3EKtCCaa	Sabes vivo a una hora y media de mi trabajo; estudiaba a hora y media de mi trabajo y hora y media de casa.  Cuando amas quieres estar con esa persona, y desde luego pudiera ser que un dia fueras tu a visitarlo y en otra ocasion el te visitar si es tanta la complicacin.  Conozco a personas que van 1 vez a la semana con distancia de 3 horas, digo ya es algo un poco mas complejo, creo que no se justifica lo de tu novio solo por la distancia...  Mi hermano tuvo novias a 2 de distancia y las visitaba 2 veces a la semana.   Pero bueno, cada cabeza es un mundo, suerte.|`|1e5e770f583f8bf7d60243fb178705b8aa	Mi querida Pilar.       No me lo tomes a mal pero creo que te esta evadiendo. hubo una ocasion que mi, en aquel entonces novia y yo, viviamos a ms de tres horas de distancia y sin embargo, nos veiamos al menos una vez cada quince das, pero minimo era cada semana.     Yo en tu lugar tomara ms en serio MI VIDA, en el sentido de checar si vale o no la pena estar con un novio a distancia y que el me este dando vueltas, recuerda que hay un refran que dice: "Amores de lejos... es de pend.....ejos".

QRtQiTiTaa	Cuando una mujer no piensa exclusivamente en lo fsico y espera de un hombre algo ms que lo meramente fsico y exterior, se puede interesar en un hombre mayor. Sin dudas que un hombre de ms edad puede ofrecer una vida ms consolidada, metas ms claras y seguridad en todos los aspectos. Todo depende del grado de madurez de la mujer, a mayor madurez ms cansada estara de los sube y bajas de la juventud.|`|1e5e770f583f8bf7d60243fb178705b8aa	Mi querida amiga:       tienes toda la razn y te lo digo por experiencia. mis dos ultimas parejas han sido mucho mas jovenes que yo (a la primera le llevo 13 a?os y a la actual 15 a?os).

Un hombre mayor puede que este mas centrado que uno mas joven pero igual hay algunos que nunca maduran y el hecho lo muestra el que este buscando jovencitas para el sentirse un muchachito de 20!  Obvio que una chica de esa edad no entiende lo que es ser mujer aun y su personalidad no esta definida por completo.  Algunas quizs lo hagan por tener estabilidad econmica.  Otras porque buscan al padre y proteccin que nunca tuvieron en su ni?ez.  Con esto no quiero juzgar y decir que todos los casos son funestos y no terminaran en nada.

Para mi gusto son muchos los riesgos.     La manera en que puedes ayudarla es darle apoyo moral y mucho cari?o para que eleves su autoestima y pueda por si misma salir a encontrar a ese ser maravilloso que la esta esperando alla afuera.

Si tienes dudas seguramente deberas tener una bonita cornamenta  La mayora de los tos es lo que quieren y no me refiero a la vestimenta sino a la libertad de expresion de ambos.  Cuando uno va con una prostituta y le pide que se masturbe solo por el placer de verle disfrutar lo hace sin pedirte explicaciones ni cuestionarte e incluso lo disfrutan.  ?Que tiene de malo eso?  No necesariamente un tio va con una de estas chicas al "mete y saca". A veces hay fantasias que te hacen feliz, o simplemente hablarlo, pero las mujeres casadas parecen que cuando adquieren la libreta de matrimonio tambin  adquieren los hbitos.  Cuando tiene que ser ms libre porque tienen "permiso" para darle duro a la "matraca" es cuando mas tonta se comportan las "se?oras" y claro el marido busca algo ms "entretenido".  A mi particularmente me agradan la mujeres que tienen ideas propias y no dependen de lo que yo quiero o se me ocurre en materia de sexo.

You will have more guys stick around. You may also want to check your attitude.

De conformidad con las distintas legislaciones puesdes obtener el divorcio: ---por Mutuo consentimiento, es decir que ambas partes se presentan en Sede Judicial y lo solicitan.  -Por causal: Que pueden ser muy variadas segn las distintas legislaciones, pero que por regla general son:  -----Por adulterio de cualquiera de los cnyugues  ------Por atentar uno de los conyugues contra la vida del otro, cuando por este hecho se produzca sentencia criminal condenatoria.  -----Cuando han existido entre los conyugues servicias o injurias graves de uno respecto del otro.  Siempre el Juez deber en estos casos tener en cuenta el nivel cultural (educacin) y condicion social del conyugue agraviado.  ------Por propuesta de un conyugue para que se prostituya (Ejemplo: Le dice el marido a su mujer que se acueste con Fulano de Tal porque as obtendr un beneficio// O ella le indica a su esposo que se entregue con fulana porque eso la beneficiara etc.etc.).  ------Por el conato de la mujer o de esposo para prostitur a sus hijos y/o por la connivencia en la prostitucin de aquellos.  -------Por la condenacin de uno de los esposos a pena de penitenciara por mas de 10 a?os.  -------Por ri?as y disputas entre los conyugues que les haga insoportable la vida en comn.  --------Por el abandono voluntario de uno de los cnyugues, siempre y cuando ese abandono haya durado ms de tres a?os.  --------Por la separacin de hecho ininterrumpida y voluntaria de uno de los conyugues, sin justificar el motivo que lo haya ocacionado.  --------Algunos Estado establecen como causal la incapacidad mental declarada de cualquiera de los conyugues, siempre quela misma sea permanente e irreversible.  Pero ojo que le aplican obligaciones de proporcionarle alimentos por vida.  Existen legislaciones que han legislado a favor de la mujer (Uruguay), donde la mujer puede solicitar el divorcio por su sola voluntad, sin explicacin de causa.  Su proceso es complejo, pero, la mujer por asi quererlo y sin explicar porque, lo puede pedir y obtener Sentencia de Divorcio.  En una demanda debes tener presente de denunciar el Matrimonio Civil celebrado acompa?ando Partida de Matrimonio.  Denunciar el domicilio de la demandada, fundamentar si es por causar, por ejemplo cuales han sido las circunstancias que te llevan a tomar esta decicin, ofrecer prueba de lo que dices con testigos y elementos de prueba que acrediten tus dichos.  Si existieras hijos, previo a la Sentencia, tienen que regularizar la Tenencia, la Guarda, Regimen de Visitas y lo ms complicado cumplir con una Pensin Alimenticia para los menores.  El conyugue que por razones del divorcio queda en inferioridad de condiciones a las que tena cuando era casado, puede solicitar una pensin de alimentos.

Hacer el amor es mucho mas complicado es entregarte a la persona que tu amas para que te de placer y te preocupas porque esa personas tambien reciba la mejor dosis de placer que pueda tener. Cada vez le dan mas importancia a car?os, besos, roces, y se llega a tener una confianza en donde pides lo que mas te provoca en el momento y eres capaz de complacerlo proporcionandole lo que l pida en ese momento.   Que viva el amor con sexo!  Que viva el sexo con mucho amor!!   :D

dCm460AWaa	Well I hate to break the bad news but it does seem like something fishy is going on. If he really care about you, and especially since he's been in Iraq so it's not like he sees you all the time, then he wouldn't act like this. He would be more mature about the situation and now throw a fit like a little kid. In my opinion, you did nothing wrong. On the other hand though, he has been through a lot over in Iraq and has probably seen worse things then you could ever imagine. If he really wants it to work, then he will come back to you. If not, then he never really took it that seriously in the first place. I'm sure that there's a ton of other guys out there that would love to go out with you, and treat you a lot better as well. Good luck and I hope that everything works out for you.|`|53XqdVE7aa	well i think for you to of left him a voice mail saying "I get the hint, I guess I won't talk to you later" was really wrong to say because he problay has alot on his mind because i know this might sound dumb but sometimes you have to put your self in his shoes by saying that you have to sometimes think about the other person and what if you just got back from iraq and then you and your girlfriend spent 8 days together none stop and then maybe he needed a break from you ya think and if you guys have been going out 9 months he is deffintly worth it and you should just have left that voice mail and if he called up set then maybe you were being rude and it got him upet because i know if someone called me up leaveing a voice mail saying "I get the hint, I guess I won't talk to you later" i would of got up set and maybe he took it the wrong way because maybe he thought you were breaking up with him because you have to always think about what you going to say it before you do and think if you were the other person and you got a voice mail saying that and do you think you would of got up set and maybe he had alot of stress on his mind just coming back from iraq just sometimes you have to think of what your going to say and do it before you do do it and i think you need to apoligize to him and maybe he won't be upet and you need to see him and give him a big hug and say your sorry that's what i think you should do.also if your that worried about him cheating on you then call him.You need to just GIVE HIM IS SPACE GIRL and i think you need to ask him if he has been cheating on you because i dought he has and if he gave a promise ring saying he was going to take you to WA with him then relaxe and give him his space to breath.|`|gpMAkzKSaa	give him his space. if he wants to continue your relationship he will come back. there is no way to force him so just sit back.
kplc5Rsvaa	NO... dating your bestfriends ex is the worst possible idea.

You can not date your best friend's ex.  If you cross that line, your friendship will probably go down hill.  There are too many men out here.  There's no reason for you to recycle the one your best friend just threw away.   Even if she told you she was ok with it, she'd hold it against you.  When your best friend breaks up with her ex, so should you.  She should be mad that you're still speaking to him.  Forget about this guy, and find someone else who hasn't swapped dna with your best friend.
uu6fbD4Taa	You both should get therapy to fix this miss, but if things can't work out then divorce him. nobody can be happy in a war's house |`|cdt4F6ZWaa	You need to get out of this marriage, if that's what you can call it at this point.  Document all those nasty things; write down the things he says when he is abusive.  Find a place, either with family or friends who can take you in temporarily then seek a divorce lawyer.  It doesn't sound like this man will ever change....don't put up with this abuser any longer. The longer you keep saying "well he makes all the $$", or "What will happen to my kids?", the longer YOU will be unhappy..  And your kids know when you are not happy.  They deserve a better home environment, where you are not constantly fighting with your husband. And, you deserve better.  |`|b32e560414238926779c6d2630e98a48aa	Hmm, for now i;d say stay (for your boys)...but if you are truely unhappy go discover you. Go do your thing, go to school or work, discover yourself again. When your boys are a little older (and understand more)  you have learned how to be you again (and have put aside a little money) then leave. |`|c60d629a9c752c61dbe6a0c1f82dda78aa	Well, are you doing something to drive him away from you?    If not, locate a women's crisis center and talk with them about your situation. If you decide to leave and take the kids with you, inform the local police station in advance that two of your children have threatened to run away in the event of a divorce. If you are a stay-at-home-mom, you are entitled to alimony and child support (if the children go with you), so don't worry so much about that.    Make sure you have a plan and a back-up plan in case the first plan backfires. Be prepared for the worst and remember that unhappily married parents are not good for the well-being of your children. The best thing you can do is help yourself so that you can help your children. Best of luck to you|`|ffb42367736232c58e1232280031062aaa	Your afraid to leave because your kids will run away??? How about you should be afraid that what they see is how theyre going to act towards women because thats all they know. If you dont work (and havent worked) you should be able to get alimony and child support. that should be able to get you and your kids by on your own. If however, you do get divorced  and your boys do run away, you have 2 options. 1, let them live with their dad and hope and pray they dont turn out like him, or 2, tell them you will put them in boot camp and/or juvy if they do. Your the parent and they are the kids.... that means YOUR the boss! As for your husbands addiction (WOW) it wont slow down. My sister got divorced because she lives on her computer playing games like that and her hubby didnt appreciate it so----- needless to say, you need to leave and think about your kids and not yourself right now.|`|AA11705300	 First, and most important of all, stop fighting. It is going to wear down your kids and make them miserable because your behavior and your husband's is so out of control. Yes, you're part of the problem too. It takes two to have an argument, a fight, a discussion, whatever. You say he makes money and you don't. Well, get a job and arrange for day care for the kids. And start seeing a therapist to sort out your own feelings about what is important to you and what you are doing in your life. If your oldest boys are asking if you are going to get a divorce, that means your household is being poisoned by all this conflict and it is a sad and hurtful situation. You can change this around, dear lady, by just stopping the arguing that YOU are contributing to as much as anyone. You are asking for the world to put the blame on him for the sad state of affairs in your home. Your husband may be desperately unhappy and that is why he's so deep into World of Warcraft. We'll never know but for sure, you can pull yourself together, take a deep breath and stop punishing everyone around you - and kids are innocent in this scenario - and calm down and stop fighting. Just stop it, for God's sake. You're sure you have to fight as sure as you are certain that your husband is a jerk who is making you miserable and so you have to fight, fight, fight. Get a grip, see a therapist and try to find some way to keep your household peaceful and your marriage intact. From your question, I gather that you will ask a therapist how you can get the hell out of this marriage and how you can do it so no one blames you. Well, everyone is going to be unhappy because you want out and you don't care who you drag down with you - that's what bothers your kids so much, too, by the way.     It's going to take work. Maybe the work is going to be done only by you. Maybe your husband will sense a change in you and respond and actually be interested in going to counseling some day too. But what YOU are doing right now is destructive and hurtful.|`|NuCu5RbTaa	i still wonder what is a six figure income. is this like 1000 dollars 99 cents? it is a six figure. or is it 100 000 dollars? it is a six figure too. u mean a month? wow. and when do u even have time to argue? shouldn't u be busy spending all this money? it takes hard work to spend all of them|`|AA10263182	Go to a counselor-work on yourself.As you change things at home will  change.|`|d9ccdfd7d368cd2f0beb5378c9e60e25aa	You need a serious affair.

Call a couple of your friends and go out bar hopping one night a week, or once a month to get away from it all.|`|aeLyiRczaa	There is no way with this amount of information that one can really help another make this call.    I will offer this to you, as I have seen it a lot.  Now, your husband is not acting like a husband is suppose to act, from what you say.  But we only have a bit of the story.  I will also say this.  Do not fall into that trap of verbal abuse, he did ugly, ETC.  Those are all terms that really are just pop psych crap in my view.  First, determine if much of what he has done that you say is nasty, were things that you really honestly contributed to him doing?  Not an excuse for him mind you, yet you do need to be honest with yourself about it.  Next, verbal abuse.  I think that many want to claim abuse when it was really that they didn't like what they heard.  Look, to say that a person is a fat pig may not be nice, but is it true?  Make sure that what he has said to you or of you is not just him being accurate.  It may not sound nice or loving, but was it honest.    I have a saying.  If you kick a dog when it is asleep, you cannot be mad at the dog when it bites you.  Make sure you have not been guilty of making a lot of the current situation come about and make sure what you call abuse isn't just someone being honest about things.  Hope that makes sense to you.    I would say that there are some problems that both of you have and also that both of you have caused in one another.  You both need to deal with those openly and honestly.  Teach your boys that people can and do work things out ( to include fixing their own wrongs )and do better instead of teaching them to just leave or just stay and use because it is easy.  Good luck to your family.|`|ZJOClpxkaa	I know exactly how you feel because I am going through the same thing being torn.  I posted mine in 2 seperate places (religion/spirituality AND marriage/divorce).  I got different type responses from both sections.  I will put the links below so you can see the answers that I got.  Although my situation is somewhat different than yours, it still hurts, especially when there are children involved.  You need to do what is best for you AND your children in order to not end up in a mental ward somewhere on antidepressants.  All children don't react the same, but mine did alright since it was for the best for all of us.  You sound as if it would do no good to talk to your husband.  Maybe you should seek counseling to help you through this.  If you are this unhappy, do you honestly think it will get better.  My husband won't seek counseling either (he told me so today).  Therefore, I have made my decision to file for divorce.  WOW is evidently very addictive, since my daughter's husband plays it as well and she almost divorced him over it.  Check to see if there is a support group in your area of other women that are dealing with this type of thing.  Most places have one.  You need some friends right now that can be there for you to help you through this and that understand what you are going through.  God Bless You and I Wish you the best.|`|9ONygcZcaa	Tough call. I would suggest counseling although the most effective is that he attends as well. Its probably mentally messing with your kids as well as they sense the friction in the household. It also sounds like your kids might be siding with you more than him which is creating underlying resentment towards him.     I have been married for 8 years and have saught counseling. Eventually, my wife got tired of counseling and the effects diminished. About 3 months ago we decided that the fighting and friction needs to come to an end. Being that this is my first marriage and marital vows mean something, I wanted to continue to work on it but, she did not. So, while I had a chance to think and reflect the marriage went south and resentment and anger started to develop between the 2 of us.     On a bright note, now that the divorce is starting, I feel a sense of relief after being depressed for the last few years. My personality before the marriage is starting to return. Granted she is trying to throw me under the bus, but as it was explained to me, in the big picture all that I am worried about it my material posessions. |`|6b2de78a5b529b770c3b7d186d3bf0c6aa	Do not let your kids control the situation, tell them it would be the only way to have a peaceful home ,it's the best thing you can do by getting a divorce, you're  not doing you kids any good by staying in such a bad marriage, consider taking them to counseling to prepare them for the divorce. |`|13YWI5cIaa	No matter what his faults are, first look at yourself. What do you need to change and what can you do better. There are some great books out there about making a marriage great. If you change, he will almost certainly change.|`|TZotf2myaa	I have not been in your situation. From the way you describe the situation it sounds like you know the right anwer, but want someone to tell you that it is okay. It is okay to feel the way you do.     First I would recommend meeting with a therapist to help unload some of the emotional burden you must be carrying before you make your decision.    Also, my parents divorced when I was 12 (in 1992). Kids are never going to feel relieved by divorce. In the long run, I can see that my life was drastically improved by my parents NOT continuing to fight all of the time. While your kids may mean the world to you, they are resiliant and could move past the anger and pain they may initially feel. As a parent, I am sure that it is painful for you to see your kids be angry or hurt by a choice you make. If you fear that this will drastically affect them emotionally, find a local counseling center to assist them through the transition.    Regardless of your decision, I wish you joy and happiness in the future.|`|ll9bT0nZaa	leave him the kids will get over but first either stash some money away so you have somethin or get a part time job and start savin and tell him you want some extra cash he sounds like a nerd playin worl of whatever and not goto counsleing with you, you can tell hes not putting time in this realtionship like you are. the kids well get over it just sit them down if you decide to leave bet thing though is first is to try to work it out and tell him he cant talk that way to you anymore but try to work it out and if that dont work go stay with family for a lil bit untill he understands he needs you and wants you back then set your ground rules but try to work it out first|`|CD2fwVz4aa	Wow, that's a tough one.  A few things you have to consider before divorce...first, have you really sat him down and discussed the problems?  If you have only hinted to him about your unhappiness, he may be too caught up in work (or WOW) to catch on.  If you have discussed your issues in depth with him and he still doesn't seem to care, then you have to think about your happiness, because it is misery being married to someone you don't love.  On the other hand, depending on what state you're in, since he makes the money and you don't, he'll likely get custody of the kids.  When my first wife and I divorced I was in the military and deployed a lot and so, according to the court, she could provide a more stable life for our son so she got custody.  Since I live in TX and she lives in AL, I can only afford to fly my son here to visit me about once a year and it's VERY hard on my heart.  It still hurts so bad not to be able to see him every day, even though it's been almost 5 years since the divorce.  The choice is up to you, but either way you go, you'll suffer to some extent.  Sorry.
HH90Eghaaa	Wow, its called trust!  Its a basis for all relationships!  Without it you have nothing!  Might want to talk with a professional marriage counselor!|`|RC8Pxx8eaa	Being "allowed" to have freedom in a marriage does not necessarily mean that person will cheat.  If love is at home she wont need it outside the door.|`|BPNDa95Laa	freedom has nothing at all to do with a ***** who cheats on her husband.|`|11cf8f776163fff338cd696072ad743aaa	ARE YOU SERIOUS? freedom and people who want to protect her?    women are not children. they do not need a big strong man to protect them from the evils of the world. they have minds. they mature. they make their own choices. who do you think you are, man?    the most secure men know to trust their women and treat them as equals.|`|b32e560414238926779c6d2630e98a48aa	First of all, if YOU are controlling HER freedom..she is not free. If you want her to feel free give HER those options. If she is a good woman she will be true to you. But don't make her feel like you are "letting" her be free, because that truly is not freedom.|`|ZsxbOXtzaa	Most women will have an affair while married. They will deny it to themselves, and even to the one they are having the affair with. Without the freedom to do so they become slugs, and automatons.If they come back, and don't tell you , you are ahead. They will have grown as a person, and will probably use the experience to please you. Humans are not naturally monogamous. Don't draw lines. Don't make rules, just live with what ever happens.|`|z9UvDdlGaa	If you married someone worth the air she breathes, she could have all the freedom in the world and still be faithful to you.|`|KgV9XMs9aa	As much as the man you idiot. She's not a pet.     Cheating =/= freedom    And it depends on what kind of relationship you are looking for. Exclusive, open, etc. |`|AEXJcpmHaa	a girl shouldnt lose freedom because she cheats, she obviously is lame and cant committ soooooo if she is cheating then you should just leave her.....rather than try and control her in some weird way. its better for you if you find someone commited to you.|`|8fw3zE3gaa	WHAT!!!!!!!!   You basically don't think women should have freedom and that all women that go out with out there man are just trying to get some.......  What is wrong with you.  You are falling for the wrong women and these women that cheat on you are obviously not in love with you.     I have all the freedom I want.  He can not tell me were I can and can't go.  Or what time I have to be back.  I give him the same.  We trust each-other and truly care and love one and other.  I would never cheat on him there is no other man I would want.  My fiancee is the love of my life and no other man could take me away from him.      Guys cheat too maybe they should have freedom taken from them too.  |`|aan2EVoJaa	a woman need freedom, of course, but all with the husband accordance..she wants to go 4 a coffee with a friend, at the hairdresser, at shopping...talk to her and ask her, that's the best way to find how much freedom she needs.i bet that u need as well a bit of freedom.|`|9oQ0AwiBaa	trust will help determine if a woman will 'misuse her freedom"- every person in a relationship may abuse their freedom of faithfulness but if you trust them, there's no worries|`|Hb3YCBqvaa	You ask several questions. It's good that you are questioning the assumptions you may have been raised with.     Your efforts to be a good person and faithful husband are the only thing you can really control in trying to influence a wife's fidelity to you.    Freedom is essential for men and women within marriage. God gives us free will to choose to do right or wrong, and to choose to love or not love.     If you wish to have a marriage based on minimal freedom, control and domination, where your wife is merely a pet, then confine her to the house and administer beatings whenever she transgresses. You may have control but you will never have love.     If you wish to have a marriage based on true love, trust, commitment, loyalty, faithfulness, honor, and truth, then worship your wife second only to God, give her the same respect and freedom that you wish for yourself.     The problem is that in some cultures women are treated like property. I hope that is not what you wish for your future wife or God forbid, your future daughters.    Men and women alike commit adultery often. This is not exceptional behavior, it's quite common. You cannot protect a person from sleeping with someone else. To think so is stupidity and self-delusion.    So, perhaps you should be asking a different question. How important is love and respect for a man or woman within marriage? Or, how about, do I have the kind of character and kindness within myself to be a good example of a husband? If God forbid my wife were to cheat on me, has my behavior contributed to her unhappiness, and should I imprison her or set her free and learn from the experience?     Remember, love and devotion are empty and meaningless without free will. Sorry for the sermon, but I have a daughter. |`|YbSsCVRRaa	freedom from freedom is necesary

Obviously its a positive thing to say to you and he is also trying to be respectful by the way he phrased it so it sounds to me like hes interested.

1HTRWrawaa	Hey check the calendar, it's 2008. Women are no longer a man's slave. You ate off those dishes, so get off your b*tt and wash them. When you finish with that clean the bathroom, unless you want to start peeing on a bush and taking a shower outside with the garden hose.     I know, you poor thing, life is so hard now that you have to do half of the work. It was so much better (for you) when you could put in your 8 hours on the job, come home, lay down on the couch in front of the tv and be waited on hand and foot.     Just remember, women aren't financially dependant on men anymore. We can work and support ourselves. So any time you don't want to do your share, your wife can just walk right out the door. Or in your case, your wife can kick your b*tt out the door. Lol If I were you, I'd stop whining, get off that computer and get those dishes done. Ha Ha Ha|`|b32e560414238926779c6d2630e98a48aa	Lol...u should deny her sex for a bit, she'll learn her lesson.

0ME2fbysaa	You don't forget the one you love. if you have ever really loved someone you will always care. Caring for someone and loving them are 2 different things.You have to accept that you are not with that person and move on with your life. Go out. Live. The answer is not to look for someone else to love. The answer is to love yourself beyond measure. You are spending so much time loving someone that you are not with... that you are neglecting yourself. Why??? because you are unhappy. If loving someone else makes you unhappy you are not loving yourself enough. Like I said, go out. Have fun.laugh smile. I have been in a situation where it seems that person is all that you can think about. All you wanna talk about. But once you start getting out and doing things to occupy your time and your MIND, slowly but surely you will move on. I think we want a quick fix for saddness or a broken heart, but the saying is true, TIME HEALS ALL WOUNDS. And if you are willing to get up and move on, it will happen. |`|b32e560414238926779c6d2630e98a48aa	You never do, if its true...|`|MkfAD8Y2aa	you love someone else.|`|kpPbnzwXaa	you don't|`|JlbxqSM6aa	I don't think you ever truly forget the people you love, you just create area's in your heart and mind for those loves so you can pull out the memory of each to reflect upon once in a while,|`|8P6MmLv0aa	You never forget it just gets easier to live with I still remember a girl I was keen on at school and that's a long time ago.|`|6846a3395d16d18b95b001a1bda626a1aa	Over time, the image fades, but not the good feeling that you had.  They become part of who you are in terms of the loving person that you are.    Falling out of love with her/him is no easy task.  But, if it is something you have to do, it will speed you on to a path of healing which I have found to be renewing, and a catharsis to any vexing the she was to my heart.    Healing is a process as is a return to love.    |`|wI3AAkIoaa	Find a new love and never look back.|`|KFT6ZbSbaa	awww... you need to move on, it will be hard. but you can do it! haha!|`|acafdcce761f87a23b935269eb5f71f2aa	Find another lover to distract you.|`|oNtvUpESaa	You never will.

Good Evening! For those of you who don't know me, I am _________, the very proud big sister of our glamorous Bride. I want to start by congratulating bride and groom, and thanking all of you for coming here today.     i found this speech on a site and its actually adressing the brie as your sister,i think..but it sounds really nice    When I look at the bride and groom, I feel such a whirlwind of emotions? I know that _____ has found her true match and I know that theirs will be a marriage of long standing. My heart is bursting with love for you two today. I know you have a wonderful adventure ahead of you, and with God's blessing your marriage will last for decades to come.    I never knew _____ before he dated my sister, so I can't tell you horrible stories about him, but I can tell you that I think he is perfect for my sister!? He's easy going, interesting, easy to talk to, and he has a great sense of humor! We are very happy to welcome _____ into our family. We know he's made for us, and we hope we're made for him!     ______, I want to note how beautiful you look today, and to tell you that this has truly been a special day for me. Thank you for giving true meaning to the word sister and for sharing the last 28 years with me. My parents and I have just loved this girl from the day she was born. We've coddled her, enjoyed her, and laughed with her.? I know how much joy she has brought into our lives, and I know that she'll bring that joy into ______ life as well.     As children, _____ and I were pretty much inseparable, and we always managed to keep each other laughing. When I think back on our adventures in childhood, I have nothing but fond memories. The fondest memories include the times we spent at the river having picnic lunches.     Add a personal memory here, or two etc. To this day, ____ is the only person I know that can make me laugh so hard it hurts. I have a lot more funny and embarrassing stories about her, but because this is her special day, I will leave her alone now.    I thought about the words of advice that we'd like to give to the newlyweds and came up with this:    The two secrets of a long lasting and happy marriage are a good sense of humor and a short memory!     Always remember to say those three important little words..."You're right dear."  If you're clever, you'll always have the last word. However, if you are very clever, you won't use it.     Whenever you are wrong, admit it. Whenever you are right, be quiet.  And, _____, always remember...a happy wife, makes for a happy life!     Separately, you are two special, remarkable people, but together you are complete. As you sit side by side through this roller coaster of life, remember to scream from the peaks, hold hands through the dips, laugh through the loop the loops, and enjoy every twist and turn.     For the ride is much better when you share it together. Coming together is the beginning; keeping together is progress; working together is success.     My wishes for ______and _______ are that they have a continued loving friendship and partnership; that they enjoy success and laughter; that they are blessed with children; and that they always see and talk with their heart.?     My greatest wish for the two of you is that through the years, your love for each other will deepen and grow. Years from now, may you look back on this day, your wedding day, as the day you loved each other the least. I wish you the very best. My love to the both of you.    Please raise your glasses while I toast my sister and her husband:    Take each day and cherish your time together. Love one another and stand together. Take time to talk to one another. Put your love and your family first; your job and your hobbies second. May your love be like the wind, strong enough to move the clouds, soft enough to never hurt, but always never ending? So here's to love, laughter, and happily ever after. Cheers!    ...=D..just chill..and the words are gonna come from within you..good luck!!..and congrats to the bride and groom!|`|ALQFHnHTaa	Hope everything went OK. I got in too late to advise you...sorry.|`|9ea5e8dd576fe0621bb8f8f8c17c8e7baa	Hi,     here is A MUST READ article before your deliver your speech. IT will be very helpful    http://www.associatedcontent.com/article...|`|HDtnHS83aa	hello boys and girls.....I would like to give out a nice big welcome to our new sexy sister in law.

3bAd5B4Gaa	hhmmmm money.  That's the green stuff we used to have back in the 80's, right?  Good luck on saving money nowadays.      Do not put your money together until you are legally married.  It's scary to think you could have one fight and you'd lose everything you'd been saving.    No one can answer your questions without knowing what kind of ring, dress, reception & honeymoon you envision.    Try envisioning something small!|`|AA10886262	Do NOT open a joint account until after you are married; start saving today, spend less than you earn and put the extra in your own savings account; and your fiance should do the same|`|qXCSWQpdaa	Spend less money than you earn.|`|9b4c3cf261f87e8eff03139562cebd19aa	best to save 10% of every check you make and put in a normal saving account unless the marriage is down the road say about six or seven years and then savings bonds might be the answer the cost of the wedding depends upon lots of factors such as how large so cost can be large or small |`|wI3AAkIoaa	If you go with how the economy is, you plan a small personal ceremony with few extras.  Then you can save on may expenses.  Total cost aprox  $1,000... then if you decide you want anything big you can do it later with a post wedding party.  The main thing is being together.|`|9e4f17e04f6a518df825311a06f819d2aa	For a good wedding, $5000.  For a great wedding $20,000 or more.      To just get married, which is what it's all really about, very little. Decide what's important (necessary).    Putting the money towards a house is much wiser.|`|27a59266d149599ab64b136938f6ef56aa	Well hope you didn't propose without an engagement ring.  That whole "take her to the jewelry store and tell her to pick something out" thing is very unromantic.  Cost depends on what kind of wedding you want.  My wedding cost about 1500 bucks, but my wife and I wanted a simple outdoor wedding.  We rented a pavillion at a county park, rented some chairs. and had a pot luck reception at the community hall where my inlaws live.  My wifes mom and sister made bouquets and centerpieces, and other family pitched in to decorate th hall.  First thing you need to do is talk to your future wife about what kind of wedding the two of you truly want before you can decide ow much it will cost.  Have a wedding that represents you and her rather than just mimicing whats in magazines.  Trying to plan a big fancy wedding just to meet the status quo will cause more fights and stress in the planning of something thats supposed to be a happy occasion. To save up, just decide if you are sharing the cost or if its all on you to decide what kind of account to open.  Then just put a little away from each paycheck leading up to the wedding. Again, have a wedding within your means and the whole experience will be alot more enjoyable than if you try and show off.|`|9ea5e8dd576fe0621bb8f8f8c17c8e7baa	HI CuriousE,   Sometimes its in the small things you can save money.  Read this short article on how to save money. Am sure you can find some helpful tips. Sometimes saving money is a temporary solution for  a period of time so dont see it as a "forever" thing.  http://www.associatedcontent.com/article...

If you feel like you helping them is starting to make you feel depressed or is bringing u down, then u may need to step back alittle. You can only help those who are willing to help themselves. Some of my friends are like that and it can make me cranky sometimes because it just seems that they are determined not to see the good in anything. They dont even try, so I have to put space between them sometimes for my own sanity. Being happy feels way too good so dont let anyone else ruin it.I go by this:  Dont worry or stress over the things that you cannot change. Good Luck|`|Jeh5NFbnaa	Sadly there is not much you can do, you can only do so much the rest is up to them. The best thing you can do is just lend your ear to them and maybe do something nice for them. It seems like you are caring person, but don't drag your happiness down because they are not happy. I think you just being a happy person will give them hope and uplifting spirt for them, but in the end they need to find their own strength and path.     I mean I getting through a divorce of 15 years of marriage I could be depressed and unhappy. However I look at things in my life I am grateful for and thank God for them. Let him handle the rest, just stay content where I am knowing things will get better. Also family and friends always help, but I don't put my problems on them. I figure them out on my own. However everyone must decide what path is more comfortable for them.|`|9ea5e8dd576fe0621bb8f8f8c17c8e7baa	Hi Linz,     Basic thing you should know. WHat to say and not to say to depressed people. The rest is out of your control. Dont change though!  http://www.associatedcontent.com/article...
IN1X1CVGaa	no  he prolly wants you to :D|`|7jpaOKu2aa	No i don't think it would its just a little peck. I've only kissed 2 guys in my whole life and im 15 and when i say kiss i mean a peck and nothin more and ive never made out with anyone either but kissing is a big deal to me it shows someone you truly like them its just a way to get closer to that person to me|`|a0b40c7a80dd3de9085039f8daf76ec6aa	depends on your age actually if you are under 18 it'd be to fast. if not than it's fine, just don't make out in a movie. Keep him waiting a little, find more romantic place for your first kiss with him.|`|NRldAzrpaa	It depends how long youve known him. Just go at your own pace and do what ever feels right.|`|6MCrTTRTaa	idk do wut u feel isright  how long have u guys known eachtoher?|`|22GMiNzaaa	no make out with him!|`|GabGD8DUaa	kiss him tonight.  it won't be too fast.|`|AA11447210	THAT is an emergency? You might want to review the definition of the word.?    If a good night kiss seems appropriate tonight, then let him give you one. If not, that's fine too. Nothing to stress over, seriously.|`|hQ8cae3oaa	I think it would be fine, or you could leave it for the second date.|`|G5Xf3vm5aa	no actually havea full make out session|`|Otu7QfqAaa	first off.. not an emergency. and emergency is your leg got cut off and or something.. haha... and you already broke the ice and kissed him on the cheek so on the lips shouldnt be too nerve racking.. but just go with the flow... it you are comfortable and it feels right then go for it.. an ddont ever kiss someone and do things just becasue people are telling you too.. you are better than that.. your life you make the decisions..|`|RSFRTYn9aa	yes... most relationships that kiss right away don't last that long...|`|YyMFDs6Eaa	no, go ahead and kiss him maybe once or twice at the movies, and once when he drops you off at home, but no making out or more than that    good luck :) i'm excited for you!!!!  (yes i seriously am excited for you because thats the way i am :)|`|GuA9zI3haa	I don't think so... Call me a whore, but i usually kiss a guy i like (just on the cheek) before i'm his girlfriend, to let him know i like him. So if you're going to the movies, i would say you could kiss him, but at the end of the night. Maybe you could hold hands through the movie though... That would be cute.

NO ONE has the right to tell me that Im wrong for going for what I like or that I should purposely be with someone that I do not find attractive just to "give someone else a chance"     WE ALL have feelings,some of us do something about our appearance as well.

But i can pritty much garentee that no guys like me and it is because of my looks.

Skip the store-bought stuff and give your boyfriend one (or more) of these Advice Girl-Approved Valentine's Gifts for Guys:        * Homemade cookies. Make them from scratch, wrap them in a hand-decorated box and give them to him at the beginning of the day. (That way he can share them and make his friends jealous of how cool his girlfriend is.)        * A mix CD. Burn a combo of his favorite songs, your favorite songs, and songs that you share (like whatever was playing when you first kissed). Then decorate the CD case with photos of you together.        * Tickets to a concert or sporting event. Bonus points if the event is on Valentine's Day.        * A drawing of his hero or his favorite band. (Or a collage or cool photoshopped pic.) Don't forget to frame it. He'll be mucho impressed by your creativity.        * A romantic picnic. Make a couple sandwiches and a special Valentine's dessert, and buy some sodas, chips and salsa. Throw it all in a basket and voila! An al fresco dinner for two. If it's too cold to eat outside, then unroll a picnic blanket in your living room.        * And for the guy who has everything, a coupon book. Make it out of construction paper (the cheesier the better) and fill it with coupons like, "Good for one back massage," "Good for one viewing of whatever movie you want," and "Good for one evening of hanging out on the couch playing video games with your friends." He'll never stop hugging you with appreciation.|`|dwIJnVqxaa	you can wear a sexy outfit for him.|`|ff4140e1e57a167f311cdcf56edb86e3aa	ok dont listen to that guy above ^ thats just a bad gift idea... it all really depends on how long you you"ve been going out with him.|`|Gbln5NyZaa	Anything food related.

You're a virgin, so your life is slowly coming to an end? Girls don't care whether the guy's a virgin. We worry more what the guy will think when he finds out that we're a virgin!    It sounds like you're looking for a relationship, rather than just sex. Start meeting girls with the intention of getting to know them on a personal level, rather than just on a physical level. The rest will fall into place, because girls like guys who are genuinely interested in what they have to say. You can start asking girls on dates, and get into the dating scene. It's really not as scary as it looks, it's actually quite fun.|`|RFP57Pf6aa	Alcohol! It's a guaranteed confidence booster!

FUbzUOt4aa	If you do decide to give it a go with him then you should be prepared that it may ruin your friendship. It seems as though you have gone passed the point of getting to know someone you fancy and into proper frienship.

You should talk to him and see if it is worth taking to the next step|`|BHYqBizzaa	f*ck his brains out!!! there you go!!!|`|e1baQ2EEaa	OH MY GOD, im in exactually same situation! =O|`|ggtFDZfQaa	ok, i dated a guy just like this(wasent the best relationship ever). he's probably waiting for the right time or something. or maybe he doesnt know, guy are slower than girls when it comes to this stuff.|`|1f7f96b2de62c068296591eb4b406c40aa	Fallow your heart and see ask him what real between u and him just ask him|`|qRYuBJVVaa	He probably likes you more than he does w/ other girls.

But in rare cases, popular guys aren't total stuck-up jerks.|`|RFP57Pf6aa	Erm, doubt it.

Does she like me?  2. Is she single?  3. Does she have any previous boyfriends I should worry about?    The best way to tell him you like him is simple, go on a date or something together (a restaurant is a safe bet), hang out a bit, and get to know eachother. Eventually let slip, as if in an "oops by the way" fashion, that you really like him.|`|ZMEon78Daa	I think that you should hang out with him in a group setting. Make sure your both really comfortable. Try and set yourself around him most of the night and talk to him. If the night goes well suggest hanging out alone sometime.|`|XQHnH1TVaa	Ok just look for singles.. go to google and type and something like "does he like me or not" and ALOT of info well show up. in the mean time, just be yourself and flirt.. dont be afriad.. its a guy. you are friends i believe and  he likes you.. dont be afraid of rejection because this "relationship" hasnt even started and it would be WAY easier to move on. .anyways,  if he looks at you alot and is around alot than he likes you.. i hope i helped :) good luck |`|GfHvFqssaa	Try to talk to him in anyway you can and and you'll know if he likes you because he will start talking to you. If he ignores or is annoyed when you talk or hang around him then no. You should also try to hang around him and see if he moves away or looks at you or any other signs. I heard that when a boy bugs you constantly or says hi at least 5 times in 1 day, they like you.  Hope that helps.
CrF0F04Uaa	If you really like him maybe you should just talk to him and tell him how you still feel about him.  he might understand how you feel also.   So hope that helps =D

I'd like a girl to be shorter than me, and slender (but only because I am skinny).|`|4a5hJNIHaa	Hair dont matter...  Shorter than the man...  and some what athletic|`|vO1dtPQHaa	I love every type of women, I really do there's not one who doesn't attract me if they are any of those!!!!!!! (But they have to be good looking)|`|cWh9z8Bjaa	Well I have slight preferences, average height brunette with an athletic build...but I like curvaceous blondes that are tall, or short redheads that are slender, what I'm trying to say is that girls in general are pretty awesome looking and most guys can appreciate a lot of different things, and if a guy likes you, his feelings for you make him like your body type more than others :)|`|0WUcM6NBaa	well, i don't care about the hair, its just mostly the face i care but hair is nice, redhead, my height, curvy and a small athletic build.|`|JVE8t1x3aa	blonde or brunette  average or short  curvy or althetic
7e4jxj3Daa	Any time!|`|lQGDV7MEaa	I have reason to believe that you are a transexual.  Good day, sir/madam.|`|NfY6oJscaa	humm,,,,, yah in my next life,,,|`|aodn8BV7aa	Email me!
ZKsSnT64aa	Is it ok to date 2 girls at the same time???|`|ZA11WBR2aa	You want to be a wh0re and get screwed by 2 guys and you ask if its wrong, of course its wrong and immoral to do that.  What are you, a porn star or something?|`|e1beK65uaa	You shouldn't date either of them if they only want you for sex.|`|gp5KrhrPaa	Pick the one you care for the most. You'll end up losing BOTH OF THEM if you continue this.|`|vVd4pw35aa	I didn't read the description but I no it's not right to date two guys at the same time...|`|Ir51Eb0Kaa	No it's not. Would you like it if your boyfriend had another girl on the side?|`|X5fEQGgNaa	Mayor McCheese says:    "it's never ok for a woman to date two men at the same time.  this is most definitely cheating and should be dealt with quickly and harshly.  it is, however, not only acceptable, but also expected for men to do this as that is our seed-spreading nature.  the only exception to this rule is when the woman is actually just having sex with men and is not dating them in any way."    it would seem that you aren't actually "dating" these guys and would thus appear to fit the exception clause.  i admire the boldness of considering a three-some with these two guys.  that's a no bullshit, take control type statement.  me gusta mucho.      should you ever crave my lean, all-beef meat (when you turn 18 of course) hit me up as i will be able to deliver a happy meal the likes of which you will never forget.    The Cheese has spoken.|`|4l2qOy7Paa	ok i think you know this answer... HELL NO. it's called cheating einstein.|`|sD1SZXEmaa	well its alrigh i guess. But you would have to pick one in the end.|`|Y6mghMloaa	Ok obviously steven just wants you for sex sooo theres no need for him...|`|NGDMRWqBaa	its alright to date 2 or more people at the same time. its when you decide to go steady or become exclusive that's its consider cheating...|`|sebhK7r7aa	No|`|2GQv8dfgaa	dude im really sorry but they probably don't like you, they just are using you for sex. its sad but guys like that don't want anything but to bang you. drop them. find another guy who likes you for your personality then go and do whatever you want with him after youre dating for a WHILE.|`|vS4LzNPFaa	yes its wrong 2 cheat because wen sum1 finds out theyve been cheated on it hurts them alot  nd its completely harsh of u 2 think of dat  i don think u shud go out with anybody until u understand that|`|haWw3B8aaa	Its your actions that make you who you are.  Who are you?|`|C1KHeim1aa	no it's not right to date 2 guys at the same time. you gotta pick one :)    anyways, if a guy just wants you to get in your pants, you should dump him right away. i mean, he obviously doesn't like you for who you are. also, if they are underage drinkers, i wouldn't hang out with them. Definitely dump Steven and Jake is too young. I mean, you're a year apart, but that's not what i mean. He's not that mature yet and you also have to think of consequences if you get pregnant. My final decision is dump both of them and take a break from the guy world ^.^|`|b05bKonnaa	prostitute...
5E4t2xqNaa	You're already getting bad vibes from her. Trust your instincts.|`|AA10503158	Well because you both keep making eye contact, that tells me she may have an interest in you. She may have pulled out the phone as a hint that she has one now. My advice is, less staring and more communication lol. Next time you see her, make small talk; don't immediately ask for her number. However, after you make small talk slip her your number instead. Good Luck!|`|45Z14uMraa	hey sry john... please everyone take a look at my question? im in need?    Please? Help with a Girl?|`|HEI2Zx8Haa	I think you should be like, "So I saw the other day that you have a phone now...can I have your number?/ do you want my number?"    Or you could say something cheesy like "So I see you have a phone now, I bet it's lonely without my number." haha
yC7jXmK1aa	i'm somewhat in your boat. i think if you both have love for each other and are willing to try, then it will work. but if one of you is at the point where they dont see it working at all, then you should let it go.. now it's time for me to take that advice! haha|`|sPQBluKEaa	me and my boyfriend had so many stupid fights and we were really rocky for a while. what helped us was really thinking before we started fighting. if it's something that you would normally fight about that you thought was stupid, then just kind of shrug it off and talk about it calmly later if it's really bothering you. also, make sure neither of you question the other one. that really bugs people. i think that if you really want, you guys could change and make it work, but it's all up to you guys.|`|5Q8vMxuqaa	Well sleeping with another man sure didn`t help, I can tell you that. If you tell him it was just a ``one time thing`` he`ll probably think your a ****, sorry. The only thing you can do is now is wait for him to get over it.|`|ad7ae5e8f17688d3566fad454e8fc09baa	There are 6 billion people on this planet, find another guy. Love isn't supposed to be this hard, and it's not worth it|`|AA12272885	You need to stand up and be your own person.  No one can pressure you into sex, you did it cause you wanted to.  Then you committed the unpardonable sin of confessing to the guy you were trying to get revenge on (that is what is was revenge sex).  So what did you expect would happen?  Did you think he would hold you and tell you everything was alright?  No way, he has an ego after all!!  The relationship was a mess to start with, and you put the icing on the cake.  So if this is going to work, you have to grow up and act in a mature way from now on.|`|xaCfXC0saa	If you really do love eachother then you should be together. Leave it for a few weeks then do a massive romantic gesture like apologising on the radio or writing him a poem/letter and send him chocolates, tell him you don't expect him to forgive you but that you were so upset about leaving him that you would do anything to make you feel better and that's why you slept with the other man. When you explain try to make it look like you were in the wrong even if you weren't, then if you don't get back together, all you can do is hope. good luck :)|`|SSFauVw0aa	yes you can      will you be happy absolutly not. sorry|`|12ouSe0zaa	No dont give up. There may be a chance that he still likes you . he just doesn't want to admit it.|`|jT9Tr5j0aa	u an win him bac if u be kind and show u rly care 4 him.. ! jus you kno talk to him and try not provoke arguments lol|`|OhJMuSR5aa	honestly, you should just give it time. all relationships have their ups and downs. if you guys really love each other, you should be able to work this out together.|`|SsoNkOTZaa	NEVER give up on something or someone you want. If you both love each other you can make it. Try to talk to him about what is causing the fights, and how to stop fighting so much. Fighting made my boyfriend tell me to move out, and we ended up talking through it and figuring out ways to fix the problems.|`|2xBfTvueaa	Well...I am a boy and let me tell you it's very hard for a boy to forgive a mistake that you made. sleeping in bed with another man...that would make me wanna kil myself if i was the boy. But that's just me. You have a chance. Just don't lie to him|`|TQVn9pGWaa	he slept with you and 2 days later couldn't be with you no more.....??? well what happena when you guys weren't together is your Business anyway not his he made his bed now he gotta sleep in it. I would let him get over it if not then i guess he's not willing to make it work.|`|AA10870669	IF you slept with someone else is because you aren't sure of the relationship you had anyways. There is nothing wrong with you sleeping with someone else or telling the truth to your supposedly boyfriend, as a matter of fact that is a good thing that you are honest.  Remember you are not married or in a serious relationship so you can do as you please. Truthfully a year is nothing, and besides unless you actually lived with him is hardly a relationship anyways, if you fought not living together have it for sure you guys would of been apart sooner if you lived together. Stop looking for things to cling to move on and take what you have learned as that lessons in life. Sometimes are things that you did together that you miss not the person it self. FOr example drug addicts stick together because of the drugs not because they have a problem...
M7tCiP8Waa	A cute card maybe a little candy something cute cheap and from the heart.  Like get him his favorite candy and a card you would think that he would find funny.|`|cSaRk1Ygaa	Get him something he likes. Or you can do what other people do: the cute little cards and some chocolate.|`|wmtbNdO0aa	A card that plays music.   Or heart shaped cookies.  (Or both)|`|USfBRbAxaa	For Valentines Day, its always nice to receive a present with thought.    For example, a home-made card is perfect, as you can personalize it.     Men are very hard to buy for, so listen to hints he may give.     For example, my boyfriend said he liked this curved photo frame in a card shop, so I've bought him that and to finish it off, I'm getting a photo of us developed to put in it.
aVDyZFxqaa	Do you mean to start dating again?  Naw, I'm older than that and I'm dating.  I could date every weekend if I had the money.   There are lots of people 50 and over that are very interesting  to talk with. In fact, it is hard to stop talking.  Good Luck.|`|qDpFSqn4aa	Not for me.  When I turned 50 a girlfriend from college found me after 22 years and we've been together for the last two years.  It was the beginning of my new life, one that is now whole for both of us.    Get your butt out there and mingle.  Meet new people or call some old ones.  It's never too late until you're dead and why not make the most of your life no matter when it happens to be in your life.    Hope this helps, good luck.

96zZlJVYaa	I speak for myself, she wouldn't be talking to me at all. it don't make any sense if you like someone and you want to treat them bad? sorry, I had one gf try that crap with me and we broke up after 6 month of dating. if you treat me bad, you can kiss my hagged!  end of message...
QkxpVe5Iaa	I don't really know....there's an interview where they do kiss....but they said they were just close friends...they look so cute together though..
lsFDEx2oaa	She likes you, she's waiting for you to make the move to ask her, go on the date just the two of you.      To be honest, you really should have acted on this a while ago.  After the second time you two hung out.    Look at the history here, you guys clicked, she felt comfortable to sleep in your bed with you, etc.  Things move along well there, ask her out there.    By doing that, you don't hear about the ex boyfriend because it's a non-issue.  Also, then there aren't these gaps in time.      Be happy she is still interested.  Usually, when you miss your window, that window is pretty much closed.  Act quickly, before this window closes too.|`|Ir51Eb0Kaa	Yes she likes you.|`|sD1SZXEmaa	dude, i think she's too outgoing. Just stay away from her.|`|rR2i2fJNaa	I think she likes you, but isn't sure if she wants a relationship with you. If you really like her then keep hanging out with her and keep talking to her. Just see where it goes from there. If it's meant to be it'll be.   Good luck! =D|`|RsnKo6Okaa	I would go for it. (:|`|9383de8d1e0067ca2e8ae7245d9fbdb3aa	wow.. okay thats mad long.. you should write a novel.. lol    okay, I think she  likes you, and for the not responding to your facebook massges all the time, is deff a girl thing, we girls don't want to come up to strong or maybe she doesnt have time. they like you but sometimes they don;t show it.|`|XMIjisNAaa	you have to make yourself like her so that you can open up for her to like you. its usaly alot easier than you think|`|fYCb3bI8aa	Ummm... wow... she totally likes u... otherwise she wouldn't have slept in ur bed... that and just because she doesn't answer every message doesn't mean she doesn't like u... she's prolly doing something... or just doesn't want to talk... take it easy like ur friends said and she'll come running back...    ps. stay cute!|`|YJVILAq7aa	woah. I can't believe I just read that whole thing..anyway.    In my opinion..this girl definatley likes you.  When girls don't like certian guys...they try to stay away from them because they don't want to send out the wrong message.  If she didn't like you..she definatley would have sat in that open chair, and not next to you.      Also, About her sometimes not answering your wall posts, and answering I.M's with one word answers, alot of girls do that to guys they like.  This is because they don't want to come across as annoying, and they want to try to play it cool.      Another thing..dude, this girl slept in your bed.  I'm pretty sure that if it was me, and a guy i didn't like asked me to sleep in his bed, i would pass on that.    My advice to you is to invite her to dinner, just the two of you, to make it more personal, and less "friend-ish"    If a guy was asking me on a date for the first time i would want him to say something like this,  "I know we have been spending a lot of time together, but how about it's just me and you next time" and give her a wink.     Hope I helped and good luck!     PS- girls always love compliments, so if you're trying to show her that your into her, give her a few compliments, and always look into her eyes.|`|JjJj69xiaa	Well dude, definitely there is some sort of chemistry there. So you should chill and not stress it so much. About the whole facebook thing, It's no big deal. Facebook messes up like that all the time. I'm currently talking to some girl on it too, and sometimes I can't really write back to her cause it does weird things. So she probably wants to talk to you just as bad. From what I have read and personal experience there's a great chance that she is into you. However, girls can be confusing at times. She seems like a really outgoing type of girl. So her flirting with you might be something she does often with someone other than just you. Even still there is a fine line to when flirting is more than just what it is. Just go on assuming she does. And remember, the art of love, is merely the art of persistence. So hang in there, and sure enough things will all come together clearly.
z9Ard2Daaa	My friend is going Thur the same thing, and i will tell you the same thing i told her... It is best to get to know him as friends before. He might not want to get his heart broken again. So humor him. Just start out as friends and see where things go. If he likes you then something more will grow from the friendship...|`|IHRLadqTaa	Well it all depends on the guy. If he looks at you with eyes filled with love then you really know he likes you, check his schedule to see if he realy has things to do because it might be true. If he does not want a relationship it is probably for a reason, dont worry there are many people out there.|`|Uu8iCur8aa	Well there are alot of things I could say about that...But if he said he just wants to be friends, then he wants to just be friends. But he can also be hiding his feelings for you, alot of guys do that|`|cFFa6FW3aa	Guys can be weird sometimes lol.  But maybe he's going through something.|`|4l2qOy7Paa	no this hasn't happened to me... im 13 haha. but maybe he just needs some time. i mean he got a divorce and stuff and he probably doesn't want to get really close to someone again until his heart can heal a little bit. you just have to give him some time. and try talking to him again asking him what's the jig?? haha. good luck. =]|`|tX2giFynaa	Yes, he really want to be your friend. Be careful, somebody can make wall between you and your friend.|`|SsoNkOTZaa	I was in this situation 2 different times with 2 different guys. It turned out each of them had only acted like they liked me because they planned on sleeping with me and dumping me.|`|31ac49d076f2ee3dc76ae11e48a42a12aa	That's the sick confusin situation, it'd be better to let the time pass for a while, to make mental things clearer.  bonne chance|`|bK0ETaU0aa	I think you need to confront him about all this confusion and you need to settle this because he must be a very awkward person
wybTIqXVaa	Wow. I had the exact same (EXACTLY THE SAME) situation. I really liked this guy, right? And I liked him more and more over the last year. Only thing was, I'd never had a class with him, and I don't think I'd ever talked to him. This year, I had one class with him (orchestra) and probably ended up talking to him about 5 times over the course of a month. And I think just about every time, it was him or me having a conversation with other people, and then the other one joined in somehow.  Then here's the kicker. I'd told a few of my friends (OK, a lot of my friends) about liking him and one of them actually asked him to the homecoming dance for me without consulting me first. I thought he'd say no; we'd never talked and he didn't even know me. But he said yes. It's crazy. And now, I've been going out with him for 3 months.  So one thing you could do is tell one of your braver friends and ask her to ask him to a dance or ask him out, but that's SO risky and really, really scary. So I wouldn't do that.  You could also just try to get to know him, you know? Do you have any classes with him? Or do you share any classes with him (like you aren't in teh same class, but you have the same class different periods)? Ask him what the homework was and then complain about how you'll have to spend so much time on it or something. It's a conversation starter.  Good luck! :)|`|cmFU81rQaa	I think you should waltz right up to him, introduce yourself, give him a big smile, tell him you like seeing him around, and tell him where you hang out at lunch and that he should come find you sometime.|`|vS4LzNPFaa	it will be good if u have any common friends who can introduce or just wen u pass by maybe bump into him and say sorry  or ask him d time or sumthing general like that  or u cud juss say hi nd see how he reacts if he likes u he will try 2 hav a gud convo|`|6gPTv8lOaa	well, i would talk to him alittle. see if u can drop hintss. good luck|`|KlbyLesSaa	Wow I had your same problem.  Maybe try to get one of your friends to talk to him and ask for his number. If you txt him say u wondered who's number it was|`|zNDqBwMAaa	Same problem. I think what I'll do is smile at him and hold eye contact for a few seconds. (: Try it!|`|Tg6ySuUOaa	if any of his friends are in your classes, talk to them a lot and pretty soon you will meet him. Best of luck!|`|24fjUKaVaa	Find someone that you know and he knows and then get that person to introduce you. Then just talk to him.|`|hZxncF0yaa	seriously, going up to him randomly and talking to him isn't as bad as it sounds!  theres many good reasons you SHOULD do this  -it shows that you are confident  -he'll notice you  -you'll get to know him one on one  -he'll probably be impressed you had the guts to do that    just introduce yourself and be really cool  act like hes you're best friend, but don't weird him out and get too excited... (:|`|RtLPoDPDaa	OH MY GAWSH  i'm in exactlyyyy the same position as youuu   sooo uncanny!  but i talkkk to himm.

IF9OYLx7aa	Hey I'm a Mum with identical 14 year old twins so I can relate to having teenagers, I've also got two older children who have successfully made it into their twenties so I have SO been there.     Look as frustrating and all as it is don't hit your teenager or kids. I KNOW they can drive you crazy and my twin 14 year olds don't listen too well either but here are some of the things I do when they refuse to listen to me:    I try to work out why they aren't listening, is it the TV or the computer that's distracting them?  Am I yelling or being grouchy and asking them to do something in a way that isn't reasonable?  If I am then I try to moderate my approach.    If they are just being crabby for no reason and refusing to listen because they can't be bothered I turn off the TV or computer and repeat what it was I was trying to say.  I tell them they can go back to their show/game when I'm done talking and I can see what I've said has registered.    If they get rude/nasty/use bad language they go to their room.  Plain and simple.  And if they won't go I march them down there myself.  No hitting, no losing my sh**.     I also remove myself for a bit if I'm getting quite upset, I'll got sit in my room for 10 or 15 and then come out and try again.      The thing is though is that bottom line is that my kids respect me because they know when I say something I mean it.  They also know I treat them fairly and listen to them when they speak.  I don't just expect them to obey me because I'm their mum.    If its so bad with your teen that nothing you say works, and believe me getting physical won't either, then you are going to need outside help.  I'd contact a child and families agency and look into counseling and family intervention.  I did that with my oldest child and even though she moved out quite young it helped me develop skills and tools to parent my other children in a better manner, my oldest was just very difficult and I have not had any of the same problems with my other three or my step kids.    Try the being firm approach with consequences that you don't back down from no matter how much they scream...and ask for help if you need it.  Violence isn't the answer.|`|3cZ4ZJPSaa	What is it you wanna do?????????|`|njtGMFw7aa	wooow u must be out of your mind. im 16 and i wouldn't even et my parents tough me. u r CRAZY!|`|QOzAkOSUaa	People don't listen when you shout at them or hurt them. Why would you want to hurt your child? This is not the right way about it. Why don't you take him/her to counselling to see whats wrong.|`|DlPH44hCaa	it's been socially drained into our heads that physical discipline is better than verbal discipline.. actually, it's worse. because in this case, the child either obeys because it fears for its life, or once strong enough to fight back, very may will (can be a very scary situation). also, it just sets up the kid to thinking that physical hitting is OK, and are so much more likely to end up with someone abusive. I think your child is just going through that stage where their hormones are going a bit crazy, and is wanting to be defiant and see how far they can push you... instead of reacting in a violent physical manner, I think you'd see a whoooole lot more of a difference in your child if you took away their priviliges, and talked through problems instead of so easily losing your temper.. earn their respect, be kind and try to work with them because you're just one year away from the dreaded TEENAGE YEARS haha.. get a hold on them while you can.. I'm not saying to be a push over and let you child go crazy, but physical discipline should be only a LAST resort, a child is a very fragile human, and should be treated like the gift they are..... I was a victim of a parent who thought that physically beating me would make me listen... it just made me want to retaliate because i was angry that they didn't care enough to just sit down and care about me.... good luck darling !|`|01422986073bb1352f22e7c8ebaaaeacaa	It sounds like you need help and guidance with parenting a teenager. they can be very challenging, but please don't resort to physical or verbal abuse. There's a good video on what is child abuse at Saber Hacer, as well as resources at www.SaberHacer.com in the Parenting Section.    Please get some help - contact your child's counselor, your pediatrician, psychologist, or even your county Child Protective services for referrals on where you can get some parenting help.|`|MuUqPKwdaa	wow u must be syco ur not supposed to touch your child anyways in 13 im retty quite and if my mom touched me i would smack and think anyone would wow dont even touch her ill call child service on u  why would u even ask that    just tell her shes not acting ok take away her call phone r computer dont hit her or grab her u must be sso stupid and a horrible mom
FMfAcAGpaa	You are on ground ZERO of trust buddy.  Do what you did to get your girl all over again only after you have had some self-reflection as to why you were testing another female.  Good luck with that.|`|yGwda7wPaa	You need to go to counseling.  If this isn't the first time you have done this, but you love your wife and don't want to hurt her, there is something wrong.  These two things together don't make sense.  What you are doing is hurting her.  But, if you have a chance now, take it to do whatever you can to prove to her that you love her and you want to be married to her.  Maybe you can go away just the two of you and have some quality time together.  My advice, ditch the cell phone text messaging feature and let your wife see all of your phone calls or text messages in the future if she wants.  Show her that you are committed and have nothing to hide.|`|gC8xO53Oaa	You made a big mistake doing this I guess you know! It doesn't matter to a woman if you had sex, or was talking to another female secretly. It's still a betrayal. Your marriage is so young and it's sad you chose to venture out, even if it was only texting. I don't think there is much you can do at this point except throw yourself on her mercy because at this point , she doesn't trust you about anything now. You've already hurt her, now all you can do is tell her you're so sorry and make your life an open book. I hope you both can make it.|`|YHcyuka3aa	Seems like you both need a swift kick in the rear. She is out going to bars and she is mad at you for having an affair? Sounds like Pot calling the Kettle Blackie! Both of you get your morals back where they belong and stop trying to hurt each other. Stop your cheating (its not flirting) and stop it now.|`|fJZQ6gl4aa	You must understand that you can only love one woman after you marry and that is your only one wife.  You can speak and talk to other women of course, but once you start flirting it could mean you have other thoughts, including being unfaithfully.  Only you can draw the line.  One way is to let the other women known that you are happily married right out, and that any gestures, hints or the like toward them should not mean otherwise.  I myself enjoy being with other women and girls even though Im very happily married.  THEY will appreciate this too and may become great friends...but remember, you have only one dear wife that you love and do it for her, for yourself and for your kids.
rh3RNM5faa	Tell her the truth NOW! Tell her that you love her!!!! Or you'll regret in the future!!!    ~Go for it tiger!!!!

83t9G4gcaa	Love at 14 is a crush.  Love at 18 is hormones.  Love at 21+ is real.    In five years you'll remember him, and smile over your memory of what you thought love was at 14.|`|V2IJHt94aa	It isn't bad for you to have feelings for an 18 year old.  It isn't necessarily bad for him to have feelings for you.  But legally speaking he can not really take your feelings any further because you are a minor, and a minor by a significant age difference.     Your parents reaction will probably reflect their feelings about him, you, your future, and all sorts of things outsiders can't even begin to guess.  Don't be insulted if they react negatively.      Also you should keep in mind that your focus for the next four years or so needs to be on school and interacting with a variety of individuals.|`|AA12108398	They will say you are to young and that you can't see him anymore.    frighteningtruth.webs.com|`|WuL6Al3faa	Only if you do meth|`|B5AKcZ5Laa	its only 4 years telling your parents would be the right thing so that he could come over and hang out and things like that and so you dont always have to go out but bring it up one day when their in a good mood and just be like i've been talkin to this guy and i've grown to really like him alot and i would like it if he could come over one evening to hang out and meet you two... somethin around tht be mature about how you go about bringing it up...|`|x6eq1XRvaa	well its illegal for you guys to have sex so the relationship would be kinda pointless..|`|a0h7SLMRaa	You want them to trust you and hiding something like this is not a good way to earn trust.

GVC08Swkaa	Well as a sex change patient myself, I think that he should just keep acting straight, save up money for the procedure, because it can be over 50 000 $   and when he is 18.... he will find happiness, because people like us are not different. Our brain is of the females. We are really females, who were born inside the wrong body.|`|AATmqYQ1aa	If your brother is a grown up then he can do what ever he pleases to his body. He doesn't feel comfortable in his skin so he needs to change it so he can be happy...we only live once.    If your parents don't accept him then that's just too bad, they cant really do anything to stop him, he is who he is. They should love him no matter what.    Now...if your brother is lying to his partner then that is something that he just got himself into..that's going to be a big mess.      Just support your brother, there's really nothing else that you can do.|`|AA10655022	SERIOUSLY tell him that sex change is the most fukd up thing eva,i m serious..tell him bout it that its not good at all and that he is gonna upset his parents alot who took care of him all his life and they dont want to see that,parents cant bare that shame..its just awful|`|4f928be0b9419dfd5070c2a489577792aa	It is really is not your place to share this info with your mother.  Your brother needs your support and obviously trusted you with this info. When he feels it is time then he should speak to your parents.  They will find out eventually.      The lying to the boyfriend has me greatly concerned.  I would have a difficult time with that and I would make my brother tell his friend .  His boyfriend needs to know the truth and your brother needs to tell him soon!  That is just wrong and deceitful to continue this lie!  What a horrible situation for the boyfriend not knowing the truth.|`|XeEkpxXoaa	well u obviously cant keep this a secret forever.  its better to let ur parents know sooner than later.  i would talk to ur brother and talk to ur parents with him.  explain in a calm and organized manner what he is doing and why.  and dont forget to support him along the way..if its hard for you, imagine how hard it is for him.  good luck|`|e9U7jO3Zaa	wat the hell fin weirdo why would he do that that is dumb idiot|`|mcqO9Hgxaa	wow. i would talk to your brother have a heart to heart and tell him to sit down and have a talk with your parents. because no matter what the truth will come out. so no point in lying.  hope everything works out for you and your family.|`|AA12323302	I think you should talk with your brother about telling your parents together that way all the heat won't be on him because you'll be there to back him up and help make your parents understand.  Having a sex change is a HUGE life decision that shouldn't be made alone and he needs to come clean and accept the consequences and he's gonna need your support.  Good luck to both of you!|`|4KocdJt4aa	Run as far away as you possibly can.|`|S4p1Luahaa	you should tell, im sure theyll understand..|`|EgGrKWjxaa	you should tell him not to do it .  he should be happy for what he is!|`|XExUVo0Uaa	This is gonna all come out sooner or later.

EdLeOUBfaa	I think its great as long as you have enough adults there to watch all of the 5 year olds. They can swim, but they probably aren't the best yet. So as long as there is plenty of supervision it should be fine.     Sounds like fun!|`|4RLjQ4M4aa	kids + water = awesome!!!|`|b5184ff2ec1ca13b698a969bd675c543aa	kids love to swim so i think its a good idea|`|Mj0BA4Yvaa	As long as you have LOTS of adult supervision, I don't see why it wouldn't be appropriate.  Did he give a specific reason?|`|VyEtrqtYaa	I think pool party's in general for kids are not a good idea.  Just ask Tommy Lee.  I would pick something where there will be better supervision and the possibility of a child dying is slim to none.|`|NBT5PoRVaa	it will be fun for the kids but remember that most kids who are 5 don't know how to swim yet and even many kids who are 8 don't know how so you might not want to go inviting a lot of kids from school. other than that it sounds like a fun little birthday party.|`|Uu4vUvexaa	he just does not want to pay the money   he'll get over it|`|OH3oIPgqaa	It really depends if you can both keep an eye on both ages. If so, you can got the rec center.|`|PQifZodNaa	Your husband have issues.     It will be fun for children to have a pool party.|`|racnq84Vaa	My opinion is that not all 5 year olds swim.  So their parents would have to attend.  So you then have to feed the parents.  And you have to make sure that you have more than one life guard.  And you then place your family morally and civilly liable not to mention, criminally liable if one drowns.  You cannot keep up with your child, their children and a party and keep everyone safe.  Not without major help.  Not to mention the puking.  When a kid eats junk and swims too soon.  Because a 5 year old will tell you they have not eaten if it allows them in the pool.  So I agree with your hubby.    But really, you two need to learn the art of compromise and listen to each other.  Instead of worrying about who is right, worry about what is best for the marriage and the family.  Is a party really worth an argument?  When you two could both scrap your own ideas and work on an alternate idea together?  It's just a birthday party.  Not the be all and end all to life.  So much more in this life to worry about.|`|ZNq5lIHgaa	Have you tried hitting him?|`|AA11383443	As a husband and father of 2 kids who are 4 years apart. even though my kids are almost grown now ages are 16 for the girl and 12 for the boy, I think having a swimming party is a good idea and the 5 yr old would love it. I loved swimming when I was 5 and so did both of my kids and they still do today. I got plenty of pictures of them playing in the water. I say go for it.|`|kn0peJ2Xaa	i kind of agree with your husband,5 years old are a lots of work,especially around the pool.what about a bowling alley?jumping beans?park with playground?ice skating ring?|`|yzIB8Cbiaa	Five year olds may be a little hard to handle in a pool that is also deep.|`|c2dfad4dc1f663f9f98d8667a84e7f6daa	I think it would be fun for the kids but it sure would be a lot of work to watch that many children around the water.|`|TYetEnJ5aa	Its a great idea, why would it not be appropriate???|`|1hciyvKdaa	It might be that the responsibility of all those five year olds in that setting doesnt sound appealing to him.  I would try to bend and get another place and suggest that and see how he fells about it. A good marriage hinges on when to pick your battles.  You would be smiling with real smiles if you both like the local and plans right?|`|AA10461616	As long as they all can swim and the moms/ parents (other than you) are willing to closely supervise as there is a big difference in how most 5 year olds swim as opposed to 8 year olds.  I'd guess I'd be glad that your husband even cares about the 5 year olds birthday and all his friends.  What does he suggest instead?  At some point they will be old enough that they each will want their own type of party, probably in a couple of years, so it's probably now or never.|`|GWRP3vLQaa	There must be other types of parties you can think of. It is hard to keep enough eyes on a bunch of excited and boisterous little kids around a deep pool. Sorry, but I agree with your husband.|`|su37vnIXaa	it depends what they have there. do they have a really shallow end 7 floaties you can rent?|`|RSDmLgXDaa	Well you can ask your kids where they want to go i mean it's their birthday. but a swimming pool party at the local rec center is good too. the 5 years old can wear a floaty if he/she cant swim|`|1uvrkDWNaa	As long as there is plenty of supervision for them, it should be okay.  Maybe he's just worried about the liability.|`|Iub2QWaIaa	I don't see why it wouldn't be appropriate. Just make sure there is a lifeguard and everyone either knows how to swim or brings a life vest. I know the life vest sounds over the top but I have a pool and at parties things can get busy so its always better to be safe then sorry. Tell the kids I said Happy Birthday.|`|poC9j0Diaa	I think that you and your husband should work this out between yourselves.|`|L0fAWSdHaa	Pool party that's great.

Of course a 5 yr old will have fun. Have you ever met a child who doesn't like swimming? I haven't and I used to babysit for a whole block of people. As long as there is adult supervision and floaties, then great party idea.|`|3ee8101ef611dcb2fe20c82dfe728d6caa	He may be right. A lot of 5 year olds aren't comfortable in the water and don't know how to swim. Would you want to be responsible for 10  five year olds that can't swim? You would have to be extra careful around the deep water....You may find a lot of kids don't show because they can't swim and their parents aren't comfortable leaving them at a pool party..I know I think it would be more trouble than it's worth, but that's me.|`|5fdgfNCRaa	I'd be careful about watching over not only one child's group of friends, but two children's groups of friends... especially with half of them being kindergarten age. You also may not know which children know how to swim and which don't (esp. the younger ones).I assume there will be a lifeguard on duty, but you'll still need to be keeping an eye on all of them. It sounds like a fun idea in theory, but in practice I think you're biting off more than most people can chew.|`|lGSv138Paa	It wouldn't be so bad if the parents stay with there kids. But if the parents just dump them and leave so that they can get away, I would say it is not the greatest idea.|`|bA94Uy4Saa	It sounds fun! Little ones love to swim!

VAfyKWmUaa	You're only 24 you have your whole life ahead of you.  I'd wait. Just my opinion though.
zNjACkxpaa	I am in a relationship and I go to lunch with lots of guys, married and single.     I have even traveled with guys.      I don't think there is a problem unless he wants more. And would fast food make you think he does??|`|AA11447210	No, it's not "wrong" if your and his behavior is appropriate. However, rumors can start no matter how innocent your lunches are. Someone could see you two leaving in the same car and the next thing you know the story is you were off having sex somewhere instead of getting a Chick-fil-A sandwich.    Also consider, how would you feel if your husband were having lunches alone with a female coworker? If that would make you at all uncomfortable or uneasy, then consider how his wife might feel and respect that. Don't do anything you wouldn't want done to you.    It's a fine line...and even if nothing ever happens rumor could start that could harm his marriage and reputation (and yours). Not fair, I know, but consider all the possible consequences and everyone who might be affected before you decide to go forth because to you it's fun.    It's not wrong, but it might not be a good idea. Only you two can decide if it's worth the possible risks.|`|wzqahEqiaa	There is nothing wrong with eating together as a group (more than 2 people).    If you know he has a thing for you (crush) it's better that you aren't eating alone with him.  If you do eat with him alone rumors will likely begin that you're having an affair.  Be careful about the emails.  People at work can probably read your emails.  Rumors can also start with emails.    Make sure you just remain friends and respect the commitment he's made to his wife.  If the guy is unhappy with his wife he should get a divorce before doing anything.  Don't put yourself in the middle and cause a divorce.|`|5ILdSx7faa	It sounds like it would start out innocent but I think this guy is a pig and I think you have made the right choice.  If he were thinking about his marital statis he wouldn't be setting himself up by asking you to lunch by yourself.  Always staying in a group doesn't make it so personal.|`|AA12272885	I think it is perfectly acceptable to go to lunch with a married man, if that is the norm at your office, and neither of you see it as anything but lunch as friends.  I have done it many times, especially in a group.    You say though that you believe he has a thing for you, but just going to lunch and emailing each other doesn't indicate he wants more.  If you have seen other signs he is interested in going further, or he hints that he does, then stop the lunches.  He may just want friendship, which is harmless.  Be above board about going to lunch together, and suggest periodically that you ask another co-worker.|`|oOVAbKPmaa	Yeah, and you just might get yourself a glimpse of his wife in that BK ANGRY WHOPPER you're chowing down on...!|`|8ac2e5cbdd946ee60c803052559873c5aa	You are exercising prudence, which is never wrong.  Keep "being paranoid" and you'll have nothing to regret.    In general, whether lunch with a married man is wrong depends on the man, the reason for the lunch and probably whether it is something he would tell his wife.    It isn't that hard to practice the Golden Rule about this, is it?  Do with this husband what you would want your own husband to do...|`|8bTder08aa	This guy is a co-worker.  Unless you want to be looking for a new job, keep things between the two of you professional.      Personally, I'd be far from flattered if I felt a married man I worked with "had a thing" for me.  Doesn't he care about his wife?  A husband and wife should care for each other more than they care for anyone else in the world.  Doesn't this guy care that he's behaving in a way that could cause talk?  Does his wife know he behaves this way?  Seriously:  why on earth would you want to have anything to do with a married man who gives the impression he's ready to betray the trust his wife places in him?      Best for you if you cool things down and start holding this guy at arm's length, behaving professionally.  Your instincts to turn down his offer of lunch were spot on.  Best now to back off completely.    Most likely, if you do, this guy will turn his attentions on someone else that he thinks he can come on to.|`|by7H31Djaa	I think you did the right thing! He's a married man and has no reason to be wanting to have lunch with another women even if she were married too. Being friends with married people is fine but when you start to have one on one time it's getting a little to dangerous.    Even if you don't think a married man has feeling for you i think it's still not right to have lunch with them or just be alone. People always start out as "just friends" before ending up as something else! So far he may not actually made a move on you but it is yet to come. You could start this way and before you know it you're on your 3rd time alone with him and find yourself thinking about him at home and wanting to be with him more and more as feelings start to develope.|`|lGSv138Paa	There is no harm in going to get something to eat. Just act like you normally would. People always start rumors, whether they are true or not.|`|G8Wsmbogaa	Even though you're just friends, I don't think it's appropriate for you to hang out with a married man.

Think about his wife! What would you be saying if this were your best-friends husband doing this to her. You would want to follow the chic and kick her *** I guess. Sorry to be so bold but it hurts when you've been betrayed! Find a guy with no wife they are much more fun anywho!!|`|EY2ixfZzaa	Just watch your self cause fast food will turn out to a eating but not at a fast food! becareful!|`|1da4a2d0455c0102329b9db0565c3a34aa	It's only wrong if you and your husband think it's wrong.  Before he takes you again mention it to your husband he's already taken you and see if he doesn't make a big deal of it.  If it's cool (which it should be) then go for it.  You enjoy each others company, he must not seem like a seamy type and if others know you're going and can come along it'd be even better in a group.  Things like this are only wrong if there's an ulterior motive and that's not the case.|`|dBuc8c2Raa	Speaking as a married woman, please refrain from going to lunch with him.  Your woman's intuition is probably dead on...he probably has a thing for you and likes the thought of your company.  Just put yourself in his wife's shoes...|`|49A8M4ZSaa	Having lunch with a married man? I don't see anything wrong with it. But others may perceive it differently especially when you have lunch together everyday.  You are the only one who can tell if it is wrong.  If you think you are falling for this guy, then it is better to put a stop to it. Likewise, if you sensed that he has some feelings for you. If you were his wife, I don't think you would like your husband to be with other women, don't you?|`|ev33OxJbaa	If it is a group of people having lunch, fine.  The fact is that he is married and stay away from him. Besides you work with all these people. Find someone outside of the workplace that is single. Put yourself in his wife's place, you would not like your husband doing that.|`|O36qjj7Oaa	If you feel that he has a thing for you then stop going out to lunch with this man and e-mailing him immediately cause this could turn into an affair.|`|7e8be8f471de4c60d8884f52a597ddc2aa	Yes you did the right thing. Just tell him your going to have lunch with your bf or something like that|`|GWRP3vLQaa	Going to lunch in a group is probably harmless enough, as long as neither one of you is slowly edging toward getting together.     Rumors are easy to get started and hard to stop. I am sure there are single men around that you can be friends with, and just because he hasn't made a pass at you yet, doesn't mean that he won't somewhere down the line. You already suspect that he has a "thing" for you.    Married men who encourage "friendships" with single gals, and single gals who can't make it clear to married men that they have NO interest in being "freinds" with them are playing with fire and sooner or later there will be trouble.    I know it is flattering to get attention from guys, but you wouldn't find it so flattering if you realized that the reason he is paying you so much attention is he thinks you are one of those gals who might put out.    Bottom line, married men are off limits, period. End of story. You'll thank me later.|`|417a83c7cb091ac86d2ec601c9b825e2aa	No, its not wrong but sooner or later someone will start some sort of rumor about it, why don't you avoid that now, and not go...its really up to you ...But...I am here to tell you , if you were to go to lunch with my husband and I find out about it, it could possibly be your last meal. It is always best to put yourself in the wifes shoes, would you like it if another woman went out to lunch with your husband...I think NOT!
gPlUDaRoaa	Well,if you own the business then refuse to let them rent from you.Yeah,it's sure does sound like they are messing with you.Talk to your ex & tell how you feel and that you aren't going to put up with their crap no more.|`|bO2rzfISaa	For your own sake, stop taking all this so personally. Lots of people call kids buddy, I don't think he's doing it to get yout goat.     You are well within your rights both legally and morally not to rent DVD's to them. WHen they come to the counter just say, "You need to find somewhere else to rent." And don't rent to them. Also don't go psycho about it in front of your children. Stay completely calm.|`|m81dfyOYaa	I think they are either trying to f*** with your wits or are completely clueless and totally tacky. Don't give either one of them the satisfaction of showing that it bothers you. Put the same sh*t eating grin on your face when you have to see them, that will bother them more than any show of anger.  My ex came to the house to pick up a blender to make his new live in mixed drinks. I was seething inside and felt like whacking him about the head with it but forced myself to be happy and smiling. He remarked to my boys later how good I looked. So, keep you cool and force yourself to be happy around them.|`|81wvN8Rraa	They are messing with you. I would refuse to rent to them or I would charge them so much they would not want to rent from me anymore.|`|t1WOxnI8aa	Yeah he's messing with you and your ex should be shame of herself for allowing a man to antagonize the father of her children. If you let him know that his efforts to get your goat is getting to you then he will continue to do it. However you have every right to ban him from your store. He don't have to like you but he sure does damn well have to respect you especially in your place of business and your home. Don't resort to violence but don't accept that sh!t from him or your ex. Talk to your wife and ask her to come alone when dropping the boys off.|`|dfhmx7a9aa	Seriously kill them with kindness. I know it sounds so stupid and very difficult but it works better then getting angry. They are messing with you on purpose but when you stop showing you care it won't be so fun for them. I'm going through the same thing!! It hurts and it is very hard. He's not worth going to jail over cause you bet he would throw there if you touched him.

One thing to not do through is try to do anything you see in a porn. Don't do that.     The best advice I can give you is to just do what you feel. Make it Pleasurable. I'm not going to lie. It's mostly going to hurt at first. After that through, Just try to make you and your partner enjoy the most of it that they can. Also, Google Sex Positions to use for your first time.|`|MwHxyNogaa	Watch some porn movies to see what the women is doing.It is not like the movies but it will give you an idea.|`|LT9VHxr5aa	hi well i am guessing your boy friend is not a virgin, let him lead the way hun he will know what to do, just start of slow and also plenty of foreplay, dont think too much into it cause it will make you tence. can i suggest a few wines b4 you take part in this exciting new intro to your life,   so  1 stay relaxed,  2 first time is better if you lay on your back  3 dont think about it too much,  4 and the first time can sorta suck a little sometimes, as there is a feeling of pressure down stairs, but the more relaxed the better.  have fun pratice makes perfect,|`|MubwaR3Kaa	Babe..  on my first time i just lay there,  let him put it in ( or he may ask you as doesnt no where to put it )  then let him do the work..   help a bit at times when you know hes gettin tired.  + If he hurts tell him as it can sometimes hurt on the first round..  but it gets more and more pleasurable after the first few.  You'll be fine :)|`|ZMn3gbccaa	I think maybe you should watch a couple porno get an idea of what to do. When you pleasure him, suck and lick on the head of his dick, while stroking it.

JhhKLYipaa	It is not wrong to talk to a member of the opposite sex if you're married. Jeez, talking isin't what causes affairs. There's nothing wrong with having her on your Facebook, just show your wife so she won't think you're trying to do something wrong.   It's normal to have regular social contact with both males & females, anybody who says it's not has social problems..|`|0PbYE3M7aa	your probably reading too much into it. just accept her.|`|5ILdSx7faa	Ask your wife|`|lf4Qj1T8aa	Safe to say you'll be faithful to your spouse if you just add her on Facebook.

This is how affairs start.
nE95Hnn5aa	I am assuming in the marriage vows that YOU took it stated something to the effect:  to LOVE, honor and to cherish.....    Please consider an excerpt from this article, meditate on it, and then ask yourself:  Is texting a male friend considered cheating (which it is not, adultery is cheating) however, you may want to consider the principles that could be applied to your situation.      Love and HopeEssential for Happiness    It has rightly been said that from the cradle to the grave, humans need love. Without it, people pine away. But what exactly is love? Although the word is used loosely nowadays, the Bible beautifully describes it: Love is long-suffering and kind, it says. Love is not jealous, it does not brag, does not get puffed up, does not behave indecently, does not look for its own interests, does not become provoked. It does not keep account of the injury. It does not rejoice over unrighteousness, but rejoices with the truth. It bears all things, believes all things, hopes all things, endures all things.1?Corinthians 13:4-8.    How unselfish true love is! Because it does not look for its own interests, it places the happiness of others ahead of self. Sadly, such love is becoming increasingly rare. In fact, in his great prophecy about the end of the present system of things, Jesus said that the love of the greater number [would] cool off.Matthew 24:3,?12; 2?Timothy 3:1-5.|`|aGOBuJtKaa	Wow he seems so insecure, sure the hubby isn't up to something himself?|`|cDubFtwlaa	not cheating hes being a paranoid jelous control freak|`|8WfFuSlQaa	If your a stay at home mom, that's great!  But you should find some social outlets.  Maybe meet with other stay at home mom's and do things together.  Believe that may help.  And as far as the texts.  Put the shoe on the other foot.  Would you feel comfortable if your husband was texting other women and you didn't know about it?|`|7e8be8f471de4c60d8884f52a597ddc2aa	I think you can tell him that its not cheating but that you will stop because it upsets him. But if the texting had anything different it would of been a lot worse, like I caught my ex, so I know how your bf feels.|`|64b71311b453645560ceb49d58250d08aa	your husband is emotionally abusive and insecure with himself. it isn't cheating to have a friend of the opposite sex.|`|7waA9vGeaa	Usually, anything you wouldn't want your significant other to know about or see you doing is considered cheating.    However, your circumstances are different. It seems like your husband is overly jealous and I'm surprised you didn't notice this before you married him.    Talk with him. Try to make him understand you're not trying to do anything to upset him and he has nothing to worry about, as he is the one you married and you love him, not the male friends you may send text messages to.    If he doesn't seem to reconsider his position on this matter and loosen up a little, I would reevaluate the whole situation and think about whether or not counseling is in order.
zzUgYFy4aa	he smiles  he flirts  he tells you  he hits you (love taps only)  he follows you around  he blushes when he sees you
iHTe2Omiaa	i'm sorry to hear about this. have you tried talking to him, telling him how you feel? next time you see him, sit him down and tell him about everything, let him know that your here for him. maybe he needs someone there for him, maybe he'll open up something to you about what he's going through. talking is the only way you can solve this. don't worry your not being clingy, boys can just be difficult sometimes. i hope all goes well!
AA11337760	Your son thinks it's your fault because you are the one that left.  He is to young to understand relationships, you have to give him time to grow up.   You are not divorced yet, so keep it on the down low as to when you go out.  I don't understand where your x is getting his information on what you're doing, are you telling him to make him jealeous, is he a staker, does he have someone watching you.|`|7e8be8f471de4c60d8884f52a597ddc2aa	Just keep doing what your doing for you everything will get better just give it time.|`|06f1b8496562ceae60b7c13272bc0615aa	My personal opinion is you should take time with your son and hold off on going out very much. Get counseling with your son together as a family. Dont speak against your husband to your son even though his father is speaking bad about you. My parents used me as a pawn to spew their hatred for one another and I despised them for it.   So right now you need to concentrate on you and your sons relationship and I strongly recommend that counseling.|`|vVTmJjJDaa	it's quite normal for a child that age to "blame" someone (usually, a parent - sometimes, a sibling) when there's a divorce....even if that person isn't deserving of it...    however, my question to you would be:  Why are you telling your soon-to-be-ex anything about where you're going or what you're doing? - stop giving him too much information - it's none of his business now.  that's likely to put an end to a whole lot of the drama and subsequent emotional problems he's causing for your son, as well as yourself.|`|AA11401294	eventually your son will need you. just keep the door open.  meanwhile, do your thing. you will survive!|`|81wvN8Rraa	Just live your life and spend quality time with your son.|`|s1LfdCdsaa	Your son needs a Dr. Phil type of therapist who will break it down for him so he can understand at an age appropriate level that Dad is anything BUT a hero. This type of therapist will also help make it clear to your son that any disrespect towards his mother will NOT be tolerated, and that he needs to adjust his attitude ASAP.    You could use the help of a good therapist as well. I hope your job has EAP, since you should do whatever it takes to get the both of you into therapy. Good luck.|`|AA11788494	Maybe it is time to tell your son what happened.  He will is mad probably because of the split itself but I would tell him the truth about it.|`|RlcfZAxQaa	Maybe the 11 year old son knows the REAL story behind the divorce.    By what you have written here - you walked out on hubby & son. If that is the case, then no wonder the son gets mad at you.    I'd like to know what you do with your friends that get the boy so mad.|`|ksqPjgEUaa	Your son has no idea what the true meaning of cheating is - he's 11.  All he knows is that mommy & daddy are no longer together & he has no idea why. ~ Arguing in front of your son is never a good idea. He won't understand. Maybe when he's older, but for right now he blames you for leaving his home & disrupting his stable family. ~ Try to talk to your son in terms he will accept. Tell him you love his father, but he made a poor decision & it's not something that can be repaired at this point. ~ Your son does not hate you. He's angry & isn't old enough to get why. In your healing, you have to remember he is hurting too.  Tell him how much you love him. Tell him you will always be there for him. He needs reassurance that this isn't HIS fault.|`|dfhmx7a9aa	My husband cheated for 8 years and I wanted to stay and work it out but he filed for divorce and I have 3 children.

She is far to young to explain in detail all of her fathers extra "friends" so I just tell her it's ok to be mad, I am mad too but the love we have will get us through. Also I wouldn't be telling your husband anything about your personal life unless your trying to make him jealous and if you are you should think about why?|`|5OXtsCv1aa	You and your soon to be ex need to allow your child to be a child.

Talk to your husband and im sure both of you loving responsible parents will agree to do whats best for the son you share.|`|95022b8a93402999302f760e35ffd0daaa	Stop playing the victim. You are being manipulated by two men in your life because you have played the victim. Don't do this, you are being   torn between your son and your ex.    Remember you have a life, you are a lady on mission, and none of them should stop you from reaching your destiny.     Yes you made a mistake, but be prepared to pay for the mistakes and move on with life. Declare "I cannot remain guilty for ever". See the devils intention is to continue making you feel guilty, without receiving pardon, he will keep reminding you of the past mistakes and how you are not prepared for the future. He will remind you of how serious the mistakes were, and he will make you feel lie you are the only one who has done such serious goofs. The truth is that you are not a pioneer, others before you have passed that route and overcame the challenge, others before you have done probably even worse mistakes that those you are thinking about, but they moved on.     Others before you have had serious consequences for their mistakes but they moved on.

c2dfad4dc1f663f9f98d8667a84e7f6daa	His ex sounds psycho. Your husband needs to grow a pair and tell her to quit with the emotional blackmail. If she offs herself, it won't be his fault, it's her mental illness and/or manipulative personality. She needs help but your husband shouldn't be buying into her crap.|`|GWRP3vLQaa	I think you know that what your husband is doing is wrong, and it doesn't sound like your marriage is so happy now because of it. It is you husband's responsibility to straighten up and fly right, or he will have two exes to deal with. He may have to deal with her on some level because of their daughter, if the wife has visitation, but in no way does that require him to write these kinds of missives to her.|`|iD4ejChZaa	obviously she is lonely and nobody gives her enough attention so she is living in the past, a past that wasn't that good or they wouldnt be divorced. she is jealous of his relationship with you, she sounds kind of pitiful, anyone can see that.  she is trying to get him to say sweet things to her, and you know men- don't be too shocked at what he said. men often put their foot in their mouth, and besides that words don't mean as much to them as they do to us women, I think guys forget half of what they said where-as we remember it word for word for 20 yrs.. For instance a guy will say anything to get a girl in bed and she believes it just because he said it.  You have nothing to worry about, he could simply say you have no reason to email me we are X's not 'friends', if she cares about the child she can call her.    he can always just delete the emails, believe me she'll stop.|`|bQpIctgPaa	He needs to tell you anything he tells his ex.  There should be full disclosure.  If he isn't secretly still in love with her and hiding any plans and communications with her, then there should be full disclosure.  There is the important consideration of the ex's feelings, not because she should be able to interfere in your relationship, but because she is your stepdaughter's mother and it would break her heart if anything happened to her mother.  You can be both stern and sympathetic.|`|bO2rzfISaa	Have you convinced yourself yet how great your marriage is? You're feeling bad because your husband is cheating on you with his ex. All that stuff YOU think about her isn't what HE thinks about her. He's still interested. You browbeat him into retracting his real feelings about her. You didn't succeed in erasing his feelings, though. You've got a big problem. Your options are counseling or divorce. He needs a new phone number that she doesn't have, and you need  keystroke software on the computer that he doesn't know about. Watch his phone bill like a hawk and monitor the computer until you can trust him again. Like after about a year of therapy.|`|wzqahEqiaa	Wow, that's a tough circumstance!  The daughter (with the ex) put a complicated twist on things.  It's sad when children are put in the middle.  The ex wife will be in your life forever unless your husband decides to stop contact.    Remind your husband that he's married to you.  His commitment to you should put any feelings to rest about the past.  His issues or feelings for the ex should have been resolved before he remarried.    The ex needs to move on and leave you and your children alone.  The "spoiled" thing just sounds strange!  Be careful because it sounds like the ex wants a romantic relationship again with your husband.  Your husband should stop writing to the ex.  Any contact should be strictly about the daughter.  Good Luck!|`|b34bca47be644e0ef6a339cf479e2cd8aa	I would ask him to choose between sitting and reading emails from his ex or having a marriage with you.|`|racnq84Vaa	He needs to man up and tell her to end personal contact.  That she can ask about daughter and daughter related issues only.  Otherwise he will cease communication completely.  Then he needs to stick with it.  If she emails that she is going to off herself, he can call her local police dept and send them the email and they will put her in the nut hut for a 72 hour hold and evaluate her.  He owes her nothing more.  The problem is not her though, it is him, he is wrong.  He married you, not her.  You sleep with him, not her.  So this 'it's all her fault, bs' is just that, bs.  He has to own what he does.  And you need to woman up and tell him to either end it or leave.  Because she does not make him do what he does.  He does it of his own volition.  When you wake up and realize that, you will be better off.|`|ksqPjgEUaa	She's obviously unstable & he knows it. He handles her in his own way. No, it's not right, but he's trying to maintain a positive - especially if she's depressed. ~ She hasn't let him go & probably won't until she meets someone else. ~ If your husband is communicating with her, he should suggest she get out & make new friends. Her dwelling on the past when he's obviously moved on isn't going to do anything except cause problems in your marriage - which in turn is what she wants.  She's being passive aggressive. Making him feel sorry for her.  If you really wanted.. you could send her an email yourself stating that you can't believe she is trying to convince YOUR husband to being deceitful. That she's out of line & the only communication should be about the daughter & it can go through you. She needs to let it go... She's making an *** out herself.|`|lvelp0CGaa	Ok I seriously hate being a kill joy on any situation but honey you need to wake up , you can tell yourself and us all you like his admitting to her he still misses her and still cares for her is a lie , it wasnt because she might commit suicide and the truth of the matter is even though he viewed their marriage as a nightmare you have to remember he chose her , he fell in love with her openly and of his own accord for what reason's they're marriage failed doesnt matter .    When my 2nd husband told me of the nightmare marriage he was in with his 1st wife I was sympathetic and wondered how he tolerated her for so long , she worked part time washing dog's and never used that money to put in for the financial's of the running of the house , she never cooked , never cleaned , she used his work money to buy everything that cost way more then he would have even considered spending on the items , she bought animals worth hundreds of dollars and ignored them he worked afternoon shift and she never had a hot meal waiting for him at home when he got home at 10:30 or 11:00 pm she always bought pizza or mcdonalds or burger king for her and their son , his son was 5 when I moved in with him and he could microwave his own fish fingers and pizza slices my children couldnt even do that because I always cooked them good meals .    Anyway she did a lot worse things according to him and even after she and his younger brother warned me everything was not as it seemed I took his side over theirs believed everything he said about her .    Your husband has given you his version of the failed relationship truth is BOTH are responsible for the demise of the relationship and you can scream that your happy and in love IF this were true he wouldnt be speaking to her the way he is and claiming he misses her , I think your husband still loves her more then just the friendship , more then just the sharing of the child and you are so in love with him your hiding behind a mirror of black smoke to protect yourself from what may come .    You need to wake up hard as it is and just start getting ready for what ever pain he is going to bring upon your marriage because he isnt over her and something is missing in your marriage you dont see he is ready to stray fix it before you end up a single mother whether he goes back to her or not never live in a dull sense of security because your security is gone he has proven that by flirting with her and lying to you dont fool yourself anymore .
lvelp0CGaa	Ah Jay welcome back we've missed your wide eyed opinions and stupidity of the reality of marriage seriously I'm glad your back mate .    Anybody male or female can have as many partners as they choose and live quite happily and in consent , they wont always be happy and jealousy at time spent or not spent will be a large issue but polygamists all over the world those that marry for love or just because daddy swapped them for a snow plow it still works just depends on how your raised , as to the legalities of such unions its never going to happen so just live your life as you please society is way to wrapped up in its own B.S. idealism's time we all branched out and just LIVED .|`|c73c9fc0da3874e1d4faac4608c7b448aa	Who the HELL would want more wives?  Cannot stand the ONE I have NOW!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!|`|VC3YXawhaa	Aside from religious and legal reasons, it just wouldn't work. People can get pretty territorial over each other (even if at first they never thought they would be). This can lead to other problems, like fighting in the house, or even the extreme of women killing each other's children. In some cultures, polygamy is accepted, but they still have the problems mentioned above. If you want to read some really interesting information about why polygamy sometimes works, "Why People Have Beautiful Daughters" is a really good book. (I forgot who it's by, but it's easy to look up)    Note: There are a few reasons why legally, polygamy wouldn't work. Think about insurance benefits, taxes, etc.....It gets pretty complicated to include a second set of dependents in all that........It's not purely a religious (or anti-religious) issue.....|`|Ixom7U5uaa	If  a man really loves his wife.. she is his equal and friend.. he does not need another    This type of  thinking is insecurity at its finest - and if an individual  uses religion as a reason.. thats even worse|`|ia2oWu18aa	cuz u can share da luv....lol =P|`|zNjACkxpaa	if you don't live in the US you may be legally allowed. State laws say you can only legally wed one person at time.   In the states you can live with as many people as you want if you provided all agree.     If you can support multiple "wives" and their children and they agree then you can. Provided that all involved are legal adults and you know what you are getting into have fun|`|8722a385a740fd3c165b65c08ed568ffaa	I always fantasized about having 2 guys at once, so maybe one i will marry two men at the same time|`|AA10241709	As long as you don't mind a woman having 2 husbands, then you make a good point.|`|417a83c7cb091ac86d2ec601c9b825e2aa	They can, but sooner or later there would be a knock down drag out fight between the 2 wives. . . ., does a man really want to deal with woman constantly bitching, I think not? Most of them can't even deal with one's nagging.|`|AA10766729	Because it's the law in the US (and other countries).  Polygamy also results in multiple mothers-in-law....and who the HELL would want THAT???|`|iZDsMCghaa	I suppose if both women are happy about that arrangement and no one is forced into it, than why not? None of my business ut I do wonder about the children they would have. Would probably make life hard on them with their peers but possibly if it were more acceptable in society than it would no longer be an issue because it wouldn't be taboo(that's how I feel about homosexuals having children), I agree in everyone equal right but until its more accepted it would be a hard environment for a kid.|`|lGSv138Paa	I wouldn't mind that so much, if she did all the cleaning. I am willing to  to share a little.|`|AA11447210	No realistic reason actually, other than in spite of the US supposedly having separation of church and state that many of our laws still come from the xian bible/beliefs.    A man or woman should be able to have as many consenting spouses as they desire. I cannot imagine for myself why multiple would be preferred (especially being one of several) but to each their own. Just because it doesn't interest me doesn't mean it shouldn't be legal for those who desire it.|`|5DVo2A8iaa	It can't be done as a legal arrangement, but if both women are willing, it could work as a living arrangement. When three or more people are together as a romantically involved group, on an ongoing basis, it's called polyamory.    To make this kind of arrangement work, members of the poly "marriage" need to work through feelings of jealousy, etc. Of course, this is true of many two-person marriages, too.|`|5ILdSx7faa	UMMMMMM depending on what country your in it's against the law|`|racnq84Vaa	If that is your mission, then be prepared for an extra husband too.

Change your phone number if the calls bother you.
