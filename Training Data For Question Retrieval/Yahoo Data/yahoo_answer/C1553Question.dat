20080901181853AAMGZBr	Society & Culture;Religion & Spirituality	Dios nace de un deseo interno de poseer todas las respuestas, aunque no sean certeras, sino viles supuestos?	No hay razones lógicas para creer en Dios, todo argumento para justificar la idea de Dios, depende esclusivamente de un estado emocional. Hay quienes  dirán que el ateísmo es sólo una idea de un "no Dios", pero lo cierto es que el ateo no imaginó dicha idea, si no que es resultado de una reacción intelectual al concepto primario de "Dios" de los creyentes, es decir, estamos ejerciendo la lógica para descartar lo inexistente, no estamos inventando a Dios, debido a que, en primera instancia, es imposible imaginar lo que no existe y estar seguros de que lo que imaginamos es lo correcto.       Lo que hace la mente del ateo, es utilizar las ideas que ya poseen proyección en la realidad, a manera de herramientas para descartar un absurdo, es decir, una idea vacía.

20081005114912AAhAaFS	Society & Culture;Cultures & Groups;Other - Cultures & Groups	What language should I take?	So as we all know, in high school all students are required to take a language in high school for usually about three years. I can't really decide what to take.  I have narrowed it down between taking either Italian or Japanese.  My other options are Spanish, Latin, and Chinese. But supposedly the Japanese teacher is the nicest but the Italian teacher is kind of mean.  However, Italian is more similar to Spanish and English (the other two languages that I am fluent in) than Japanese, and I find it easier to be able to learn, not to mention that that way I wouldn't have to memorize a whole other alphabet. Also, my aunt speaks Italian so she'd be able to help me out but I don't know anyone who speaks Japanese.  So what do you think? What are your opinions? I'm grateful for any kind of help, so thanks!

I asked about my father whom I never met. I just found out that he left her before I was born. She told him if he left he should never come back. After I was born, he came back to see me but she wouldn't let him. He called sometimes and she didn't say much. She never allowed him to see me. He stopped calling a long time ago. I asked her why she wouldn't allow him to see me and my bro (his son) even though their relationship didn't work out. That I didnt understand why he still couldn't see us. She said she didn't think he had any of our self interest in mind, he was self-serving, selfish and she was upset that he walked out on her. She said i could still have a relat. w/him. I teared up and said but I'm 21. She said are you just looking for something to cry about. She knows I'm sensitive. I"ve always been since birth. I'm in therapy & on meds. Why do you think she'd say that to me. I cried myself to sleep. She looked distressed. I'm sooooooo upset with both of my parents. All this hurt and anger is building up inside of me.

20081111165644AAC7nVu	Society & Culture;Religion & Spirituality	In order to be a true Christian, do you have to go to church?	I believe in God and Jesus with all of my heart and soul.  My father was in the Air Force, so we moved around a lot when I was a kid.      Now, I am married and have three kids.  We have moved around a lot as well and I believe have finally settled down.      The problem is that I have been to many different denominations and they all seem to interpret the Bible differently.  It was frustrating.  I thought, "there is something wrong with this picture."  I don't want to raise my kids in the "wrong" denomination.      Plus, my mother-in-law is always telling us that we HAVE to go to church or we'll go to hell.      I've decided to study the Bible and pray to God for guidance.  Since I began this mission, I have learned more about God than I ever did in church.  Why is that?

20081030083858AAHCaWU	Society & Culture;Cultures & Groups;Other - Cultures & Groups	Iranians/Persians please?	OK this thing started very recently:      Its all over YouTube, and its all over the internet: blogs mailing lists etc      I am seeing that Iranian/Persian teenagers increasingly are turning into European-wannabes by acting, talking and even pretending to be them... They back this foolishness up with the excuse of "we are Aryan, so we should be with our fellow caucasians". Note that as I see in youtube, some extreme adherents of this belief go as far as to propose a racist "aryan brotherhood" between Iran, Germany, Armenia etc.....      To tell the truth I am ashamed by these fanatics. Whats the point of forming some race-based nationalistic union when those whom we call "fellow aryans" from Europe actually dont consider us Aryans? stupid racist videos against particular race groups are all over Youtube, anyone with a little dark skin is considered as "non-aryan"      Truth be told, Aryan actually refers to a group of Indo-Iranian, Indo European group which extends to too wide a scale among too many different cultures to form a "race-based" union. its not just what is now considered "white people", "caucasoid" actually even refers to places as far as Sri Lanka and Bangladesh, meaning dark skinned bengalis and vedics are aryan as well...      What is disgusting is the fact that white skin is seen as the primary things defining heritage. I have a white skin colour, I am tall and what you call Aryan... but I look 100% different from any european or Indian or Arab, I am persian I want to be myself and follow my culture and not beg for food from some other culture I am totally unrelated with. I can be considered white in America for how I look, but in reality I am not Euro-white and I will never want to be      Say no to white nationalism...Pan-aryanism is foolish      I hate people in my country who embarass me with this racist nonsense...      Black or white, arab or chinese, indian or european, dark skinned or light skinned, we should all be ourselves, yet treat each other equally      What do you think?
20081105214305AA3DyM3	Society & Culture;Religion & Spirituality	Why is there so much hate in R&S?	I am an Atheist.  One thing I do not understand is why there is so much hatred.  I see people asking questions about how funny it would be to see all Christians dead.  I see a small percentage of Christians condemning Atheists to hell.  I would wonder why there is not more intelligent debate and less hatred.  I find that most believers are decent people who want to be free to believe what they choose to believe.  Many Atheists like to treat them as if they are stupid or something because they choose to believe in God.  I don't understand this.  I choose not to believe in God.  I cannot accept the fact that there is a divine creator.  That is just my choice.  I feel no desire to tell others they are "wrong" for choosing to believe in any God.  For all I know it is me that is wrong.  Why is it so hard for people to quit judging others?  I realize there will always be extremists in any group but it just seems to me that allot of people only come here to incite hatred and judge others.

It's the day when the realm of the Fae is nearest to the human world...so it's a faerie holiday.      It's the day of All Hallows Eve, the night before All Saint's Day, so it's a church holiday.      It's the day when spirits can come back and visit this world, so it is a day of the dead.      It's a "stolen" holiday from Druids and Witches, the day of Samhain.

I am asking this from a historical and spiritual perspective.  I am not trying to argue that one is better than the other.  The history of Christianity shows us that there were many different Christian sects that existed in the first centuries.  Ultimately, the sect that went to make up the Roman Catholic Church "won" the Christianity war.  The other sects were persecuted for their beliefs by the Roman Empire.      What do you think if they hadn't have "won?"  Where, as Christians, would we be today?

And I live in a 95% Hispanic city which the school I go to is 99% Hispanic. So, what's going on with a lot of Hispanics that don't know Spanish.

I understand that not everyone celebrates Christmas but why get offended by it? I don't get upset when someone says "Happy Hanukkah" simply because I don't celebrate it. I'm not putting other religions/cultures down by saying it either. Really it's no different than being angry at someone for saying "Happy Birthday" to someone when it's not your birthday. When we are forced lump it all together and say "Happy Holidays" instead, all that is doing is making us all the same. I thought we were supposed to celebrate our differences in cultures.

20070922164947AA7Blzo	Society & Culture;Other - Society & Culture	"What's up" or "how are you"? How do you deal with those?	Let's say I meet a friend that I haven't seen for some time. Let's assume I don't want to know how he is, because:      1)I know he's doing well and everything is perfect in his life.      2)Me asking "how  are you" will lead to him asking how I am, and I don't want to answer that question.      The way I see it, when people ask "how are you" they want to hear something like "Fine, thanx" or "I'm good".   But what if I'm not? I don't want to start  telling the person how miserable and messed up I am because:      1)I don't complain to people about my problems.   2)I'm sure no one wants to hear my "crap"anyway.      So... Back to my main topic.. Provided I DON'T want to lie and say I'm good, is there any way to AVOID the "how are you", "what's going on"  and "what's up"questions from both sides without making people see me as a jerk or someone who is boring/indifferent/doesn't care?

In psicologia le emozioni sono definite come reazioni affettive, in genere brevi, ma intense, che sorgono all'improvviso in risposta a degli stimoli ambientali che, per un motivo qualsiasi, ci colpiscono. I sentimenti, invece, non dipendono da uno stimolo esterno, ma dai nostri valori, dall'influenza del nostro contesto culturale e persistono nel tempo.   Secondo voi, è possibile che un'emozione si trasformi in sentimento e con quale meccanismo?   Grazie.

Leggendo sul vocabolario trovo la definizione di prete:    prte, sm. - 1 Il sacerdote cattolico. SIN: pastore, religioso. LOC: fu consacrato prete. 2 Ministro del culto. SIN: sacerdote. 3 Intelaiatura di legno atta a contenere lo scaldino nel letto. SIN: scaldaletto, munnia.     Or dunque, non coincidendo il mio stato con le prime due definizioni devo pensare di essere uno scaldaletto?  Ma gli scaldaletti riescono a porre domande?

Siete del tipo che si lancia nella conversazione senza preoccuparsi troppo degli eventuali errori, oppure siete più riflessivi e a costo di sembrare taciturni parlate solo quando siete certi di contrare l'espressione più corretta?   E più in generale, siete del genere che vuole approfondire la conoscenza fino "all'eccellenza", oppure preferite il lato più immediato e comunicativo di una lingua?   Curate la pronuncia, oppure la ritenete di secondaria importanza?

I believe scholarships should be based on financial need and ideas. Scholarships should not be based solely on ethinicity. Everyone is an American here in the United States. What makes America uniques is because we are made up of different cultures. This issue should open the eyes of America because scholarships based on ethinicity just enhaces racism in America. Everyone should have an equal chance of getting a scholarship regardless of ethinicty and skin - color. Just because I have darker skin does not make me better than a person with lighter skin. Both of us should have the equal chance of receiving a schoalrship.

20080303072143AAMk4HH	Society & Culture;Religion & Spirituality	Mi sono chiesto, come fare a liberare la società dalla religione?	?      E' ovvio che non è cosa da poco. Nel nostro caso la religione attanaglia la società da migliaia di anni ormai e non se ne si può liberare dal giorno alla notte.   Inevitabile per cui, che si dovrà intraprendere un percorso lungo generazioni.      d'altronde credo che il male che porta giustifichi anche molte bugie. Per esempio si potrebbero raccontare bugie alle nuove generazioni purché se ne tengano lontano.      Per esempio si poterebbe raccontare bugie sul fatto che:   - La religione è sinonimo di guerra (le crociate, la terra santa)   - Che alcune istituzioni religiose sono colluse con la mafia e con i massoni   - Che istituzioni religiose ha avuto rapporti economici con i poteri forti anche organizzazioni poco lecite   - Alcune Istituzioni religiose hanno avuto al suo interno una percentuale di pedofili molto più alta di qualsiasi altra società, ente o istituzione.   - Che sempre le stesse istituzioni religiose si sono prodigate per difendere i pedofili al loro interno e che potessero abusare

When that sense of self worth reaches zero, what emotional torture is placed upon that person? Is it so hard to see that the constant stream of malicious intent behind the comments people make is actually destroying the self worth of young people?

20090130190243AAStZ3j	Society & Culture;Cultures & Groups;Other - Cultures & Groups	This Black lady is afraid of me?	Ok there is this black family that live close to me, they are one of the few black families there.   there is this very old lady she must be in her 80s, everytime I go outside, she is sweeping or cleaning her garden,but she is seems to be afraid of white people.      When i go outside and she sees me, she inmediatly goes inside her house, I have seen her do the same thing when she sees other whites coming.      The thing is that I find it funny and I usually do things on purpose to make her run, One day when i got home from school, she was sweeping the sidewalk, when she turned around, i picked up a stick from the floor and started making noises, she screamed and run really fast, i laughed really hard      but i want to stop this, how can i stop it?    she is old and dont want to mess with her but i cant help it, im always doing something to scare her. what should  I do?    btw why is she afraid of whites??
20090130194342AA5nxdn	Society & Culture;Etiquette	Am I being impolite? ?	OK, today in my class in high school, my teacher's throat hurts so she cannot raise her voice. My classmates are talking loudly after the bell rings and still talk after the teacher stands up and trying to make the class calm down. Today there is a test, so time is precious. They are all AP kids so they should know what to do, but apparently they don't. So, in order to help out, I yelled loudly saying "QUIET!!!" The really loud kind that hurts ear drums. I thought I was just trying to help, but the more I think about it, the more I think maybe I am being impolite. So, am I impolite by doing this? And...if it happens again, how should I help my teacher to calm the class down effectively?

It seems to me that some Christians, not all, but some, think that atheists are "Hard headed" in that no matter what, they will never convert. Can someone stand up?

I would like to make a quick point before I continue on with my question. I'm pretty sure if god DID show himself, I men truly show himself(Heal the blind with a single touch, calm hurricanes, ect...), then I and most atheists would convert. We see a set of given facts, and draw conclusion from that. We don't hate god.      So on to my question. What are thinking? Why? Have you never meet an atheists? What is you logic you use to draw this conclusion? Show me real proof and most other atheists, and we will convert. But it has to REAL.

20090130193729AAusZYv	Society & Culture;Languages	Will my semetic-like vocabulary system work?	The semetic languages (hebrew, arabic, and such) have a unique way of forming new words. They have three consonant-roots that are used to form additional words by adding vowels into them.      My system works similarly, except it doesn't allow for consonant clusters (it only allows a CV syllable structure) and only has seven consonants and 3 or 4 vowels (haven't decided yet if I should use both i and e or just one). And my roots will mostly only be two consonants. So basically my words will look like kula, kala, kilu, kalu, etc, and all of these will have something to do with speech (word, language, talk, shout, voice, etc). But I'm worried that having only the vowels vary might make words look too similar. Should I use this system or find some way to make words more different from eachother?      Note that not all roots are so restrictive. I plan to have individual roots for stuff like human relations (friend, enemy, like, dislike, love, betrayel etc) or the ground (land, dirt, rock, floor, farmland etc).

20090130195851AAIhN5h	Society & Culture;Religion & Spirituality	Atheists, why do you ignore the importance of the messengers behind religions?	Clearly, most if not all religions emerged after a man brought a new message and people rallied around this message.  Yet, if you ask an atheist to explain why we have religions, he will ignore this. He will say people had fears of natural elements, etc., but not that there was a man with a positive message.  This is amazing, especially when we consider that most of the times the message wasn't easily accepted initially, but met vigorous oppositions instead. This suggests that religions did not emerge from fear, but instead fear was an obstacle to these religions initially.  Most importantly, it also suggests that there was a value to the message.  People rallied around science because science brought something useful. That is the way it works.  It was the same thing for religions. You might have small sects that rally a few people for a little time on the basis of fear, but no religion has been created that way.  Why do atheists distort the reality? Is this something too much opposed to their belief?
20090130195616AAkD9ZV	Society & Culture;Religion & Spirituality	Having eternal life  is one of the worst curses you can have?	Think about it. Ok, so you die and go to heaven (or whatever else you believe in). Sure, first couple years maybe fun. Hell, maybe the first few hundred years would be fun.     But what about a million years after that? A billion years after that? Trillions and trillions of years passing by with no end in sight. But, hey, at least you will be god's personal knee bower and servant...for eternity.    If you never stop existing then you lose any purpose you have whatsoever. You have no inclination to do anything.Why would you? There is no climax.No conclusion.Everything is just a continuation of everything else.     Everything would become meaningless as you just sit and wait for...nothing eternity after eternity after eternity.    I really don't understand why people buy into this whole "immortal" thing. Nothing attracts me to it. Personally, I think wishful thinking that you have eternal existence is just a projection of human greed.    Sure is a good thing that we all may rest peacefully one day.

Let's say someone is Asian and prefers to date only black guys, then she's open-minded. I do not see how who you date makes you any less racist or open-minded.

20090130194834AAsqjvB	Society & Culture;Other - Society & Culture	Can you believe that this happened to me...twice?	Here's are 2 stories, the second from awhile ago. I'm writing both of them tonight because I can't believe what just happened to me today, cannot believe my bad timing and bad luck!!      Today I went to a seminar and there were about 200 people there, people from all over the region. I randomly chose an empty seat and sat next to a woman and we started making small talk. After lunch she asked me where I was from and from which office and when I told her, she was stunned and silent and then I realized that she must be from the office of our only local competitor. I said, "are you from ___" and she said "yes" and then it was completely awkward from there on! We made a little joke about it but then avoided each other for the rest of the seminar...      Here's story 2:   Two years ago we found out we got ripped off in a business relationship. It had just happened and we had just fired the thieving ***holes and I was still upset. I went to my daughter's friend's house to pick up my daughter after a playdate and told the mom the story. She said, 'let's ask my neighbor for advice, he's an expert in the field, etc., etc., I wish he were home right now....oh and there he is!"       Her neighbor, the expert, was getting out of his car. We excitedly ran across the street and approached him. He was wearing sunglasses. He saw us and stood there with a strange expression on his face, but he was still wearing his sunglasses. The mom said, "Hi __, this is my friend and she wants to ask your advice." I started telling him my story about getting ripped off, and then he still stood there without saying anything. Into my second sentence, I realized who he was -- he was one of the two guys who had ripped us off!! I said, "Oh, it's you, ___, I was just going to ask you for advice!" The mom was stunned and slowly realized what had happened. We both stammered that we had to go back and check on the kids and ran back to her house. She ended up having to cover up with her neighbors because they were friendly (their kids play together) and tell them that all I said was that we couldn't afford them (without any mention of the ripoff). What are the chances that he lived across the street from her AND that she would take me to ask him for advice??!  She says that now she's not surprised, she's always thought he was creepy and wondered how he made so much money -- now she knows!!!!!!!!

20090130182224AADuMFw	Society & Culture;Cultures & Groups;Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual, and Transgendered	People confuse me for a girl! Should I be offended?	All my life people have confused me for a girl. I have long hair below the shoulders and an extremely feminine face so people are sometimes confused when they see me. And I get it a lot now especially when I out with my man because of how opposite we are. Im a really feminine bottom male, but he is EXTREMELYbutch, masculine, and handsome top male. Plus my body figure is a lot more shapely than his’. Infact when I was little and developing, the other kids used to tease my body and make fun of me and call me “big booty boy” ‘plump butt” and all kinds of stupid things. So when I stand next to my man, people often confuse me for being his woman. Ill never forget the one time that we went to the mall and some guy standing outside the store tried to sell my boyfriend a woman’s gift to give to me. When he saw us, he said something to my boyfriend like, “why don’t you buy this for your lady?”, and he was referring to me as his lady. The mall is always crazy, people always try to sell me women’s perfume, purses, and other women products. Im not neccesarilly annoyed by it because Im used to it, and I would never cut my hair because its my identity and plus my man likes it. Weve been together 3 years, so you know that hes my everything. Should I be offended when people confuse me for a girl?

I'm making up a myth for a school project on Greek Mythology. I am saying that tornadoes are created from all the birds of the sky and fish of the sea and animals of the earth flying/swimming/running in a circle, in the same direction at the same time, same speed. Anyways, I need to include some characters in my myth that relate to the natural occurrence. Any help or ideas would be great, thanx!

20090130202251AACQMEz	Society & Culture;Religion & Spirituality	Do you ever wonder why many don't believe in God as there are so many mixed up false religions posting on here?	When I read this forum lately I see so many false doctrines being spewed all over the forum that it's a no wonder why so many are non-believers and have little faith. The false Hell-fire doctrine is a regular on here; not to mention the next false doctrine -- Trinity -- where "Jesus is God" says the misinformed and mislead; and then there's all you need to do is believe in Jesus and that's enough to get you into heaven??       I mean even the so-called informed are lacking in accurate truths and constantly spread falsehoods about truthful Bible and Godly standards. Even when shown the truth both false Christians and non-believers alike are blasphemous and stick to their stupidity and ignorance. They don't want to learn the truth and change. No wonder why so many are confused...       Satan certainly is working feverishly and he's got the non-believers and false religious ones in the palm of his hands.      True Christians, please weigh in?

20090130202510AAzPAZl	Society & Culture;Etiquette	How to cope with people who laugh at your accent?	I'm new to the United States.   I speak English with an accent that is prominant only sometimes, but you know, sometimes, some people and not all of them, give me a strange look, even laugh at my accent or sometimes get mad why I can't speak as nice as them. Well, English is my second language. I also speak French and Italian but never felt so inferior when speaking other languages. My English is good, just I have a different accent. And I'm so lonely here, this makes it more difficult to cope ... I sometimes find myslef crying because of the bad manner of a salesperson or something like that. I personally, never treat people in this way. Anyway, how to cope with people who don't like my accent?   How to get less hurt at least?

20090130202758AADEcJ1	Society & Culture;Cultures & Groups;Other - Cultures & Groups	Why aren't parents looking over their teens?	... especially girls?      Teens are really out there. They're going out, having unprotected sex, getting pregnant, and girls trying to ruin a good guy's life. I mean look at how these girls take advantage of guys and wind up pregnant, and then they blame the guys when it was really their fault. I've notice that girls are really out of control these days, while the guys are going legit.      And being a teenager, they just wait until the baby is born. Why don't they have an abortion? Its better that way. They're spreading demons (babies) like wildfire.      So why do teen girls do this to themselves? Why are they trying to trap a good man with these evil spawns? Why are girls becoming so bad and evil these days?         I'm sure some of you stupid teenagers and breeders are going to flag this because you people sensitive!
