pIGZsA3saa	remamazita, ahi te va algo que me encontre:   La aparicin de Rayuela en 1963 fue una verdadera revolucin dentro de la novelstica en lengua castellana: por primera vez, un escritor llevaba hasta las ltimas consecuencias la voluntad de transgredir el orden tradicional de una historia y el lenguaje para contarla. El resultado es este libro nico, abierto a mltiples lecturas, lleno de humor, de riesgo y de una originalidad sin precedentes.    El amor turbulento de Oliveira y La Maga, los amigos del Club de la Serpiente, las caminatas por Pars en busca del cielo y el infierno tienen su contracara en la aventura simtrica de Oliveira, Talita y Traveler en un Buenos Aires te?ido por el recuerdo.     y otrico:  Que Rayuela no es una novela corriente queda claro desde un primer momento: en la primera pgina, Julio Cortzar nos invita a seguir uno de los dos modos posibles para leer. As, tenemos un primer libro, que se lee de la manera habitual, con la nica peculiaridad de que no terminamos en el ltimo captulo (ni, por tanto, en la ltima pgina), sino en el nmero 56 (en total son 155). El segundo libro que propone el autor es tremendamente original, pues hay que seguir un "tablero de direccin", que nos lleva de un captulo a otro hasta recorrer los 155, pero no de manera consecutiva; as, empezamos en el captulo 73, de donde vamos al 1, de aqu al 2, de ste al 116... y concluye en el 131.    De este modo, Cortzar rompe con la hasta entonces ineludible obligacin de acabar un libro cuando se acaban las pginas, y leemos sin saber cundo vamos a terminar la historia. Esta ruptura con lo convencional hace de Rayuela una antinovela, pero no es lo nico. Otra de las reglas novelescas de las que Cortzar se re es la de la trama: se supone que en una novela ha de haberla, que han de pasarle muchas cosas a los protagonistas y al mundo que les rodea, pero en Rayuela no es as. A pesar de la extensin del libro, la trama es aqu prcticamente inexistente (y aun as engancha como pocos).    Los captulos del libro estn divididos en tres partes: del lado de all, del lado de ac, y de otros lados. El primer libro que propone Cortzar (el ms normal) slo incluye las dos primeras partes, y se leen en ese orden. En el segundo tambin se sigue ese orden, pero intercalando continuamente captulos de otros lados ("captulos prescindibles", segn el propio autor).    En el "lado de all", se narra la vida (en la que, insisto, no pasa prcticamente nada) del protagonista, Horacio Oliveira, en Pars. Asistimos con l a las reuniones del Club de la Serpiente, nos paseamos por la fra capital francesa de madrugada, observamos el amor poco habitual que existe entre l y La Maga... Cuando estamos "ac", lo vemos en Buenos Aires (su ciudad) junto a su amigo de juventud Traveler, que est casado con Talita, en quien Oliveira ver reflejada a su a?orada Maga; y en el sofocante calor de la capital argentina veremos cmo Oliveira sigue renunciando a crecer y convertirse en un hombre como todos los dems refugindose en la lectura, la msica y el pasado... Los captulos "de otros lados" son de lo ms variado: el estribillo de una cancin, una cita de un libro, un titular de peridico, ms frases que amplian una conversacin...    Leer Rayuela es escuchar jazz y tangos, tomarse unas copas o unos mates entre cigarro y cigarro, hablar de infinidad de libros, compadecer a algunos personajes y detestar a otros, pasearse por las madrugadas de dos ciudades tan distintas y hermosas como Pars y Buenos Aires... Leer Rayuela es tambin disfrutar de los innumerables juegos de palabras y con el lenguaje que hace Cortzar (como los cambios de registros, o la invencin de idiomas), de su increble facultad para combinar magistralmente momentos de un irnico sentido del humor (como la escena con la pianista, o la indiferencia con que algunos se toman el intento de suicidio de uno de sus amigos) con otros de un intenso dramatismo (como lo que ocurre con Rocamadour), de su inacabable originalidad (como en el captulo 34, en el que segn leamos las lneas pares o las impares tendremos uno u otro texto)...    Pero lo que ms me gusta de Rayuela es que se trata de una (anti)novela inacabable, en ms de un sentido. En primer lugar, porque si elegimos el "segundo libro" que propone Cortzar (es decir, si seguimos el tablero de direccin), no se llega nunca a un final, ya que el penltimo captulo nos conduce al ltimo y viceversa. En segundo lugar, Rayuela es inacabable porque el lector puede inventarse sus propias combinaciones: al no haber apenas trama, podemos ir de un captulo a otro segn nuestro antojo. Cortzar nos brinda as la posibilidad de convertirnos (en parte) en creadores y "escribir" nuestro propio libro partiendo del que tenemos entre las manos. Esta posibilidad (que recomiendo encarecidamente) me result irresistible desde el primer momento y la he llevado a cabo en ms de una ocasin, haciendo de cada lectura una distinta.    Rayuela tambin es inacabable porque por ella no pasa el tiempo, nunca se quedar desfasada, nunca ha habido ni habr nada parecido a ella, y en consecuencia todo lo que se ha dicho y se dice sobre esta obra no es nada en comparacin con lo que se dir. Es una Obra Maestra con maysculas, que ocupa un lugar principal en el Olimpo de la Literatura, del tama?o de la Odisea, el Quijote, Fausto o Ulises, por poner unos ejemplos.    Pero Rayuela es inacabable fundamentalmente porque es una novela obsesiva, obsesionante, compleja, apasionante, y sobre todo imposible de olvidar. Sus conversaciones no desaparecen al cerrar el libro y sus personajes no se conforman con quedarse en nuestra memoria, sino que son de carne y hueso. A esto slo le encuentro dos explicaciones: o bien Cortzar era un hechicero que cre un libro de c|`|oHicd0Sqaa	me hubiiera encantado los 10 puntitos pero mas que nada te respondo por que me interesa saber que tal esa obra, soy fanatica de ellas, de hecho hago una de fantasia con un grillo y una mujer pero no se que poner al final, como eres tan buena tal vez me puedas ayudar, ademas sos muy linda, apta para papel estelar, jejejejeje, ayudame es la siguiente preg    http://es.answers.yahoo.com/question/ind...|`|lu8H0IWIaa	guau Indira, viva Colombia desde aqui en Costa Rica, te acuerdas de mi?????, el peque?ito al que le habias respondido, Rayuela la habia leido hace mucho tiempo, casi no recuerdo nada, pero si me acuerdo que en el cole me lo exigieron, un besote, estas preciosa y tines estrellita, tengo otra preg para ti, cuidate|`|930fe73b33732f29f1d90a326d6ddf17aa	La le de las dos formas.

Obra clave de la literatura hispanoamericana contempornea que supone la consolidacin de un estilo personalsimo, rebelde y pardico, donde el lector asiste al destino de personajes que circulan entre las pginas evitando la predeterminacin propia de la novela tradicional  No es posible hablar del argumento de Rayuela sin caer en inevitables reduccionismos que nos alejan del sentido profundo de la obra, ya que lo relevante de esta novela no es lo intrincado o novedoso de la trama, sino el vasto universo psicolgico de cada personaje y la relacin que, desde este universo, establecen con el amor, la muerte, los celos y el arte.    Teniendo esto en consideracin, a continuacin se presenta un sucinto resumen del argumento general de la obra, la que puede dividirse en tres partes:    La primera parte, Del lado de all narra la vida de Horacio Oliveira, un argentino avecindado en Paris y su relacin con la Maga, los que se rodean de un grupo de amigos que forman el Club de la Serpiente, con los que entablan memorables conversaciones y discusiones que nos entregan la visin de Cortzar acerca de la condicin humana como reflejo de la condicin del artista.   La segunda, Del lado de ac, devuelve a Horacio a Buenos Aires, donde vive con su antigua novia; all pasa largas horas con sus amigos Traveller y Talita; en el primero se ve a s mismo antes de partir, en la segunda ve a la Maga, inolvidable y siempre presente.   Finalmente De otros lados, que agrupa materiales heterogneos: complementos de la historia anterior, recortes de peridico, citas de libros y textos autocrticos atribuidos a Morelli, un viejo escritor (posible alter ego de Cortzar). Estas pginas, si bien en ocasiones se relacionan con los captulos que las preceden, muchas veces no son ms que estmulos imprecisos que Cortzar nos presenta para ayudarnos de alguna forma a alejarnos de la linealidad clsica de la literatura y sumergirnos en subtextos y subtextos de subtextos.   En su fondo y en su forma, Rayuela reivindica la importancia del lector y hasta cierta forma lo empuja a una actividad y protagonismo negado por la novela clsica en la que ste era llevado por la linealidad de una historia en la que lo ms importante era "lo que pasara al final". En Rayuela el argumento no importa o slo importa en tanto es el escenario en que los personajes habitan y se desenvuelven, en una libre y profunda vitalidad que el autor les otorga y de la que l mismo dice no hacerse responsable.      [editar] Tablero de direccin  La novela propone dos lecturas (el autor sugiere que pueden ser infinitas): una de la manera tradicional, empezando por la primera pgina y siguiendo el orden normal hasta que ponga Fin (a pesar de que la novela an tendr muchas pginas ms); y otra leyndola en un minucioso orden de captulos establecido en el Tablero de direccin que figura en las primeras pginas del libro. Con esta lectura, intercalada de collages, se sobreexpone de informacin al lector y se le hace cmplice de teoras avanzadas en materia de novela. La libertad como eje central.      [editar] Notas  La rayuela no slo da el ttulo a la obra sino que es su metfora esencial. Consiste el juego en hacer pasar una piedrita de una casilla a otra con la puntera del pie, avanzando cuadro a cuadro hasta llegar a la ltima casilla. Cortzar recurre a la variante argentina del juego en la que la primera casilla se llama Tierra y la ltima Cielo. El juego es mencionado varias veces a lo largo de la novela. Lo ve Horacio en sus paseos con la Maga por Pars, se identifica con el amor que sienten (Al besarse alcanzan la ltima casilla de la rayuela) , est dibujada en el suelo del patio del manicomio.   El captulo 68 es un ejemplo del "glglico" o lenguaje musical. Evoca una escena ertica. Por un lado, es un juego, una burla; pero hay algo ms: es un lenguaje exclusivo, no compartido de los enamorados que los asla del resto del mundo.   En Rayuela, se nombra al escritor argentino Juan Filloy, de gran influencia en el estilo de Cortazar|`|d0447191a189d965fc1bd0b9586830a7aa	Novela extraordinaria. El captulo siete es un verdadero poema de amor.

The Nazis built a huge army, which was sent almost entirely into Poland and France in 1939 and 1940, the Navy and Luftwaffe were patrolling the sea lanes and skies over western Europe, engaged in the Battle of Britain, and elements of the army were fighting in North Africa with Rommel's Afrika Corps.   Within months of the entry of the United States into the conflict, Hitler made a fatal error which eventually caused his regime to collapse: He inexplicably opened a second front by invading Russia, splitting his forces and thereby causing his world domination plan to fail in the cauldron battles on the Russian front.   This error in judgement led to the destruction of arguably the finest, best trained, and tactically sound army and air force ever assembled. The Russians simply outlasted and out reinforced the Germans, and what was left to protect Germany from the American invasion of Europe was not enough.  Your grandad might have served in multiple theatres of the war, which coincides with your Grandmother's account.   It's an interesting question, that unfortunately does not have many records to use as a resource. Good Luck, and dig deeper.

His origins are unknown but he is one of the Mesopotamian city gods, namely of the city Assur, once the capital of the Old Assyrian kingdom. It might therefore be that he was a personification of the city itself. From about 1300 BC priests attempted to replace Marduk with Ashur in Enuma Elish. From the reign of Sargon II he was identified with Anshar the father of An, probably because the similarities of the names. In this version of the Enuma Elish Marduk does not appear and instead Ashur slays Tiamat as Anshar. Some scholars have claimed that Ashur was represented as the solar disc that appears frequently in Assyrian iconography. However evidence points out that it is in fact the sun god Shamash. Many Assyrian kings had names that included the name Ashur.
b620ee9ffe6252c90305858258e1bd65aa	Nasser died September 1970 this is the first fact you need to know.    This is one answer I did not copy it to the end:    Nasser recognized the potential popularity and power of a terrorist guerrilla force that could strike at Israel with relative impunity and then fade away into the obscuring fog of statelessness. However militarily ineffectual those strikes might be, the mere fact that some Arab leader was killing Jews in Israel generated popularity and support in the Arab world.  Under the tutelage of the Soviet dictatorship, Nasser founded the Palestinian Liberation Organization (PLO) in May, 1964, with Ahmed Shuqeiri at its head. Nasser's goal was to have the PLO displace el-Fatah in the Arab popular mind as the new strike-force against the "Zionist enemy".      The Six Day War between Israel and the Arab dictatorships changed things dramatically. Again the massive Arab armies, thoroughly outfitted with the best equipment that Communist Russia could provide, were humiliated by tiny Israel's pre-emptive strike. Shuqeiri was indecisive, but Arafat seized the opportunity and forged an alliance with Nasser. From September to December, 1967, Nasser supported Arafat in his attempt to infiltrate the West Bank and to develop a grass-roots foundation for a major terror war against Israel. These efforts were unsuccessful because local West Bank Palestinians cooperated with Israel and aided them in their pursuit of him and his el-Fatah operatives.        Ironically, Arafat described this era in his authorized biography as a time of his greatest diplomacy. When word of Israel's peace offers reached him, he and his adjutants understood at once that if there were peace between Israel and Jordan, there would be no hope for a Palestinian state. So he set off on a grueling shuttle-stop tour of major Arab countries, preaching the need to reject unconditionally any peace agreement with the Jewish State. Arafat claims credit for the results of the Khartoum Conference in which all the Arab dictators and the PLO unanimously voted to reject Israel's offer to return much of the land it had occupied as a result of the war in exchange for peace. With this admission, Arafat inadvertently takes the responsibility for Israel's prolonged sovereignty over the West Bank and Gaza Strip. Had he not intervened, Israel could have made peace with Jordan, and the West Bank would have reverted to Jordanian sovereignty in 1967.      Perhaps because of this, his efforts found no support among the Arabs of the West Bank. So he established a base for his fledgling terror army in the city of Salt which is in southwestern Jordan. From there he executed some raids across the Jordan River and began to establish clandestine contacts with Palestinian officers in the Jordan Legion, almost half of whose officers were Palestinians.     http://www.discoverthenetworks.org/indiv...  By this time Nasser had become a hero in the Arab world. In 1958 Syria and Egypt united under his presidency, forming the United Arab Republic ,hoping that one day all the Arab nations would join, but the Egypt-Syria union, however, broke up in 1961 after a military coup in Syria.     By 1967 the Arab-Israeli situation had deteriorated. After the UN peacekeeping force, at Nasser's request, had been withdrawn, and Egyptian guns blockaded the Gulf of Aqaba to Israeli ships, Israel attacked Egypt and occupied the entire Sinai Peninsula up to the Suez Canal ( Six-Day War) in just six days.After humiliating defeat of Egypts forces, Nasser, taking responsibility for the debacle, resigned, but the thousands of people took to the streets, demanding his return to government. He stayed in power for 18 years even in the face of a large number of domestic competitors and opponents .On September 28, 1970, he died suddenly of a heart attack  http://www.famousmuslims.com/Gamal%20Abd...  http://www.pbs.org/wgbh/amex/hijacked/ti...  http://www.meforum.org/article/1069

The war (World War I) made him even more unpopular. There was a bread riot and a strike. Nicholas came back to Petrograd to sort out the strike - when he got there the Duma advised him to abdicate - the Duma formed the Provisional Government.<br>  <a href="http://www.soviethistory.org/index.php?page=subject&SubjectID=1917february&Year=1917" rel="nofollow">http://www.soviethistory.org/index.php?p...</a><br>  <br>  October Revolution<br>  <br>  The Provisional Government carried on with the war - this was deeply unpopular. The hunger that caused the February Revolution carried on. The Bolsheviks recruited heavily in the army and industries in the big cities, they offered "Bread, Land and Peace". When they stormed the seat of the Provisional Government in October 1917 they declared themselves the new government. Lenin was their leader.<br>  Led to a civil war won by the Bolsheviks in 1921.<br>  <br>  See:<br>  The October Revolution - Roy Medvedev<br>  <a href="http://www.soviethistory.org/index.php?page=subject&SubjectID=1917october&Year=1917" rel="nofollow">http://www.soviethistory.org/index.php?p...</a>|`|shVgCizBaa	What caused the russian revolution?1905-1917    <a href="http://www.thecorner.org/hist/russia/revo1917.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.thecorner.org/hist/russia/rev...</a>        Why Was There A Disaster in 1917? <a href="http://www.johndclare.net/Russ3.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.johndclare.net/Russ3.htm</a>                                        Russian Revolution<br>  Causes <a href="http://www.factmonster.com/ce6/history/A0860855.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.factmonster.com/ce6/history/A...</a>     The Russian Revolution<br>  <br>  WHAT WERE THE CAUSES FOR THE RUSSIAN REVOLUTION? <br>   <a href="http://www2.sunysuffolk.edu/westn/russrev.html" rel="nofollow">http://www2.sunysuffolk.edu/westn/russre...</a>         Russian history: The causes of the Russian Revolution <br>    by David O'Donnell <br>  <br>  The revolution that broke out in Russia in March 1917 was sparked by food riots in St Petersburg. During the harsh winter there had been little food available in the Russian capital and finally the patience of the population ran out. When the authorities tried to restore order the police and soldiers simply joined the rioters. Tsar Nicholas II was absent at Stavka, the Russian military headquarters on the Eastern Front, and so was unable to assert his authority in person. In a very short time the Romanov's three hundred year hegemony of Russia was eclipsed. The Russian Parliament or Duma ignored an imperial edict for is dismissal and set up an all Party Provisional Government to restore order. The bread riots helped bring about the final demise of the imperial system, but a belated industrial revolution, the failure of the Tsar to implement political reform and Russia's disastrous involvement in the Great War also played their part in bringing about the Russian Revolution. <br>  <br>  Ads by Google<br>  By the late nineteenth century Russia had partially industrialized and an urban proletariat began to emerge in the major cities such as St Petersburg and Moscow. In the countryside things were changing too as a consequence of Tsar Alexander II's abolition of serfdom in 1861. Russia because of these changes had the potential to become a modern state; however, political development did not keep pace with social change. Tsar Alexander II had also drawn up a constitution, but his assassination in 1881 rendered his efforts in this sphere null and void. Neither Alexander the III nor Nicholas II who followed showed any interest in constitutional reform. Rather, they attempted to reimpose the absolute autocracy of their Romanov ancestors. As a result, the majority of the population continued to have no say in the running of the country and they became increasingly restive and open to exploitation by political extremists.<br>  <br>  In 1905, in the after-mouth of defeat in the Russo-Japanese War and a failed revolution, Nicholas II was forced to agree to the formation of a parliament or Duma, but it had no independence of action and did not really represent the people, who by and large, remained disenfranchised. The Tsar's failure to recognize the need for political reform in the period 1905-1917 would ultimately lead to the demise of the imperial system. Indeed, Nicholas II appears to have been caught between two worlds neither embracing change nor able to turn the clock back to absolutism. The stage was therefore set for the final act of the tragedy.<br>  <br>  Russia's involvement in the the Great War brought all the simmering tensions within Russian society to boiling point. The severe defeats as well as the shortages of food and essentials caused widespread hardship. In 1915 the Tsar foolishly took command of the army. He therefore spent long periods away at the front leaving the unpopular German born Empress and her confident the drunken and lecherous mystic Rasputin in charge of affairs. In March 1917 the people took matters into their own hands and ended three hundred years of Romanov rule. In October 1917 the Bolsheviks overthrew the Provisional Government and established a Communist dictatorship. The form that the Russian Revolution took may not have occurred if Russia had not gone to war in 1914, but the end of the old Tsarist system was certainly inevitable because it did not adapt itself to the changes that had transformed Russia from a backward agrarian state to an emerging modern industrial one <a href="http://www.helium.com/items/599957-russian-history-the-causes-of-the-russian-revolution" rel="nofollow">http://www.helium.com/items/599957-russi...</a>|`|OZe8yHk5aa	I'll answer this without just copy and pasting from a website.<br>  <br>  The Russian Revolution took place in October 1917. It occurred during World War One. The Russian government was ruled by one man, Nicholas II, who was the tsar (king). He had total control of the country, but was a terrible leader. He did a bad job of leading Russia during the war, and many Russians suffered with lack of food.<br>  <br>  In February 1917, many citizens protested and overthrew the tsar. The new government was called the Provisional Government. They did a bad job as well, and the war continued. Eventually, in October 1917, the Bolsheviks (Communists) overthrew the Provisional Government. They wanted factory workers to rule the country and for the government to own all factories and land. <br>  <br>  Essentially, the revolution happened because the government could not help citizens get enough food. It was a failure of leadership.<br>  <br>  <br>  If you need any more help, or if something isn't clear, let me know.

In WW1 they faught the British who were using something of the same slogan, who had gotten that slogan from their former Roman masters. Also it was meant to protect the German people, never meant for confused gender identity youth of America, the Neo-Nazi movement spawned more from the KKK than from the actual Nazi regime who were fighting for Rights and a possible invasion of foreign policy (Alliance forces) had nothing to actually do with color- that as well was a campaign - Japan was in the Axis as well as some parts of Africa . KKK coined the phrase "WHITEMAN" which was out of the ignorance of history, they claimed such a thing because they not able to directly trace back anymore to the original culture, of say Irish celt- or Spain- or Turk - or French, by far are the KKK a white race, since there is and never was a "WHITERACE" or that would include the light tones of about 900,000 lighter Asians.

shVgCizBaa	Brigadier-General Charles Lawrence (December 14, 1709 – October 19, 1760) was a British military officer who, as lieutenant governor and subsequently governor of Nova Scotia, was responsible for overseeing the expulsion of Acadians from the colony in the Great Upheaval. He was born in Plymouth, England and died in Halifax, Nova Scotia.Governor of Nova Scotia<br>  Charles Lawrence was named lieutenant governor of Nova Scotia in late 1753 when Governor Peregrine Thomas Hopson left on November 1 due to health problems. Lawrence was officially sworn in on October 21, 1754, holding this position until 1756, when Hopson resigned the post and Lawrence was made governor. He served as governor until his death in 1760.<br>  <br>  To his new post, he brought considerable distrust of the French. The French Acadians of Nova Scotia had become British subjects by the Treaty of Utrecht (1713), but exhibited no willingness to participate in the British-French quarrels that were ongoing in the region at the time. Lawrence adopted a view that he found in the correspondence of previous governors: that though the Acadians should not be antagonized, they should be required to take an oath of allegiance. In July 1755, he attempted to force a visiting delegation from Minas (Grand Pré region) to take the oath. When the delegation refused to submit without consulting the population they represented, Lawrence imprisoned them. The council then decided the expulsion of individuals refusing the oath was appropriate, and that "it would be most proper to send them to be distributed amongst the Several Colonies on the Continent." Although there was no military plan in Britain mandating the expulsion, Lawrence was never rebuked for acting without orders.<br>  <br>  As lieutenant governor, it was he who was responsible for writing the 1755 Acadian deportation order, securing the approval and co-operation of William Shirley, the governor of Massachusetts. Together with the refusal to take the loyalty oath, one of the major reasons for the deportation was lust for the fertile Acadian farmlands. Lawrence was convinced these rich meadows would make excellent farms for English Protestant settlers. The deportation, known to Acadians as the Grand dérangement (see Great Upheaval), was a form of ethnic cleansing; historians estimate that approximately half of all Acadians died as a direct result of it, primarily due to shipwrecks, disease, and exposure. Some survivors eventually reached sanctuary in south Louisiana where they formed the basis for what would become the Cajuns.<br>  <br>  As governor of Nova Scotia, Lawrence saw the settlement of the Acadian lands as his most important task. He fell into conflict with merchants like Joshua Mauger, and was the object of formal complaints against him in the form of petitions to the Board of Trade. Lawrence issued proclamations in 1758 and 1759 seeking settlers for the Acadian lands, directed mainly at New Englanders. Since settlers were reluctant to break new forest land, he combined new and old land in each grant; merchants interested chiefly in taking advantage of the lands the expelled Acadians had settled, as well as those interested in using the lands as awards for military veterans, opposed this policy. But Lawrence wrote privately to Lord Halifax that "drunken, dissolute, and abandoned" habits, especially the habit of idleness, made veterans bad settlers.<br>  <br>  In 1757, Lawrence was further promoted to the title of brigadier general and commanded the successful siege of the French fortress at Louisbourg on ?le Royale (Cape Breton Island) in 1758.<br>  <br>  It was during his tenure, but not with his approval, that Nova Scotia had its first elected legislative assembly which met in 1758. This elected body is the oldest representative body in Canada. He is said to have died of pneumonia in 1760, after over-indulging in a local Halifax, Nova Scotia banquet; others report that he died "after catching a chill." He is buried under St. Paul's Church (Halifax)<br>  <br>  After Lawrence's death, the Board of Trade ordered an investigation into complaints against him. He was criticized for approving excessively large land grants and concealing of the true cost of his land policy, but was exonerated from the most serious charges. His role in the expulsion of the Acadians occasioned very little commentary at the time of his demise.<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charles_Lawrence" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charles_Law...</a>
w3uYxwiraa	I believe one of them was called Phenomena? Tell if I'm right. They had various collected stories about odd or supernatural events, followed by questions. Am I right?<br>  <br>  If I am right, it was published by Jamestown publishers and was part of the critical reading series. There were 9 or 12 books I believe. The ISBN of Phenomena is 0-89061-106-8.<br>  <br>  It is black and square-shaped. Don't know about the others. Phenomena is the only one I have.<br>  <br>  Other book titles in the series are Aliens and UFOs, Apparitions, Calamities, Disasters, Eccentrics, Heroes, and Monsters. Hope I helped!

0ZoY4YHDaa	I personally don't like her works at all.. Her 'non-fiction' book, Stupeur et Tremblements, about her experience in Japan, is the only one I liked.   But this is my very personal opinion... I find her works depressing (Hygiene de l'Assassin, Antechrista), repetitive (she re-uses the same themes over and over again, without elaborating or giving more depth to her analysis), and not very profound.     Most people who have read her love her.. So I might not be the best person to answer your question. And apparently, no one else here even knows her!    What about you?
yCU47Zskaa	Usually, on a sunny day I have my exposure set to around 1/200 to 1/2000 depending on how bright it is usually in really bright areas like light reflecting off a lake I might set it to 1/2000 but if it's a shady area then maybe around 1/60 to 1/250.  I know the more you experiment with the camera setting the more you will be used to these type of lighting situations. But, yeah 1/30 is too bright for a sunny area. Ps. Try to have your ISO around 100 for outdoors. Hope that helps.|`|8l5HY3K2aa	id put the camera on aperture priority and set the shutter at say about 1/160 depending what im shooting.<br>  <br>  if you need to email me,|`|AA10912074	There is the "sunny 16" rule for estimating exposure.  <br>  <br>  On a sunny day (in the sun), set your shutter to 1/ISO and the aperture to F16. <br>  <br>  Now, if you understand "stops", you can estimate your aperture.  Let's say you have ISO set to 100. <br>  <br>  Shutter is 1/100, aperture is F16<br>  Shutter is 1/50, aperture is F22<br>  Shutter is 1/25, aperture is F32<br>  <br>  That should give you some ideas.  1/30 shutter speed is like a third of a stop faster than 1/25 second, so something like F29 would work.  Check the exposure on your LCD, use the histogram if you can, and then adjust.  This should be a good starting point, though.

4h9PlVi8aa	The language is somewhat ironic in that it deals with describing, primarily, the physical weight the soldiers carry about their person. The irony comes through when readers quickly figure out that the narrator's descriptions deal more with emotional and psychological weight than physical weight. I think this comes through most clearly with the photograph and letters of the girl the Lt. carries with him and discards after one of his men is killed. Such a moving story.|`|MKzpTdplaa	i'd describe it as the do your own homework kind of language.|`|5U8oNM8Saa	The language in this story is simple yet profoundly effective. It is hard to believe that a story which appears to be about the things soldiers carry in their knapsacks could be about so much more. O'Brien uses long passages of desciption to convey the repetitive and seemingly endless nature of the days which the soldiers endure and at the same time converys the emotional weight which they bear along the way. He implies that the emotional weight is much heavier than anything they are physically carrying.

AA12095483	Why did women grow discontented with their lot? For the same reason slaves grew discontented with their lot. Women were not treated as persons - they were possessions, belonging first to their fathers, then to their husbands. They could be (and were) married off to whomever their father wished, whether they liked the person or not. They could not own property. They had no rights. And a little of that goes a very long way.
NYU37jfGaa	Women had always been involved in the textile trade in large numbers, but formerly they would work at home, doing spinning etc.  As a result of the industrial revolution, they went to work in factories, which must have been a totally different experience for them.  They worked very long hours for small wages.  They were probably not earning much when they worked at home, but at least woul dnot have suffered the same grim working conditions.<br>  <br>  Also the seperation of home and workplace which occured with the Industrial revolution meant that married women who worked were away from their homes all day, instead of being able to combine work with childcare as they could in previous times.  The children were also working in the factories in the same appalling conditions a stheir mothers and fathers.

aOy01jFEaa	Learning to forgive others is also knowing how to forgive oneself.<br>  When the odds appeared to destruct expectations of wellness. Everything seem turns into darkness. Hatred will be like a contagious disease of pain and misery. To give as well as to take it like a never ending unbreakable chains of bitterness. Probably that the locks of offense getting stubbornly harder only in time without a glimpse of acceptance.<br>  What can be gained in such a restless matter? Being victims of miseries caused by folliness, avenging schemes to seek a 'just' resolution to determine a fulfilling task of oneself or other purpose. Is still all never working to gain things being truly lost. The fact that without mercy and forgiveness. The more of that we only have to lose, by surrendering the mind, as if lost in a small dark cage filled with thorns. <br>  Sometimes that even losing more new fortunate matters for ourselves to the expense of clinging on the unforgiven miseries caused by others. Growing with some of our important aspects might be frozen in time. We are only granting more favors to our foes from that..<br>  Proper yet cleverly ways of justifications still exist. When that fails..The wronged will never be. It is all but only in occurrances of physical matters indeed. That nature is powerful with its forces regardless of time. Maybe it can be difficult to intellectually specifically conclude specially when at presently in great rage. But we ourselves are also a part of nature..We learn and grow with it, from flaws and imperfectons. <br>  Hence to forgive is allowing oneself to grow with nature. Growing keeps the soul being enriched. That soul never perishes with oneself. It will remain with us..Even in time. <br>  <br>  The energy we release when we hate is very tremendous specially when it's intense. That only imparts a piece of energy excreted from our beings. It is not a positive one (it might create more delusions instead). So as when it can possibly return to us more unfavorably. For it may also cause losing a part of an emitted energy just for vengeance, or hatred. Is it really worth losing apart of it, when we are truly unforgiving nor without mercy to satisfy us? Will that satisfaction be genuinely fufilled? When we are hurt and wounded. Whether forgiving or not, the wound may still remain..We can only learn from those wounds.<br>  We are liable to be hurt, but without forgiveness the misery will be always clinging through into our lives and it might truly only affect our well beings on a very negative way.|`|VLP5l3J0aa	Only if they're worthy.|`|f2cQrG7jaa	Only to relieve the conflict within ourselves, not out of love or duty.

KADDz1EPaa	The barbarians have undoubtedly caused the collapse of the Roman Empire, especially the Goths of Alaric and the Vandals of Genserico.<br>  By the italian historian|`|K60FfiIfaa	They had a major role, and ultimately the empire fell because of them.  At least that's true for the western half of the empire, as the eastern half lived on as the Byzantine Empire.<br>  <br>  Westward migrations of nomadic peoples from the steppes of Asia pushed into Europe, displacing European peoples like the Germanic tribes, the Goths, the Huns, and others.  They fled towards the Roman borders, seeking new lands to settle in.  Rome had many chances to peacefully take them in, which could've revitalized the empire after being depopulated during plagues.  Instead the bungled negotiations or stabbed them in the back with treachery on several occasions.  <br>  <br>  The barbarians turned on Rome and invaded, raiding border cities and so forth.  Rome struggled to defeat them, and on several occasions was forced to pay them off with land, in exchange for mercenary service, to defend Rome from other barbarians.  This created two problems: 1. Rome lost tax revenue as it gave away territory, and 2. the mercenaries were ultimately loyal to their tribal chiefs or kings, and not to Rome. <br>  <br>  Roman territory shrank, and barbarians increasingly controlled more of the military.  Eventually it was so enfeebled that the barbarian Odoacer was able to depose the last emperor Romulus Augustus, who by that time was little more than a figurehead to the barbarian-dominated army.<br>  <br>  There were many other factors that led to the fall of the empire, but barbarians were undoubtedly one of the major causes.|`|7149XmBqaa	They knocked at the gates a little too hard.

2Ko12Elfaa	I've been taking the T by myself since I was 14.  I don't know your situation, but fear on the train is ridiculously over-inflated.    Edit: Hiram: I'm not sure that's completely true.  Remember, it's not crime that's down... it's crime statistics.  And crime statistics are the most unreliable type of statistics I can think of.  Someone must A) commit a crime; B) that crime must be reported to the police; C) the officer in question must properly file the crime; D) the precinct in question must submit crime data to a national database.  Pretty much all of the methods in these steps change over time and represent many personal interests.  For example... how many of last year's rapes or domestic violence crimes do you suppose ended up in the database?  How about from a neighborhood distrustful of the police?|`|FoIxsunVaa	Crime statistics are down since the late 1990's.

At that time, society protected certain types of people, but was far less safe than it is now for African-Americans. Human rights laws were not as present as they are today.

(ayudainfoen ventana)[1] (Deln Boldaq cerca de Chit c.1162 (?) - Gansu 18 de agosto de 1227), fue un prncipe mongol que unific a las tribus nmadas de esta etnia del norte de Asia, fundando el primer Imperio Mongol. Su verdadero nombre era Temjin (cuyo nombre significa "el mejor acero"). Bajo su liderazgo, los mongoles comenzaran una oleada de conquistas que extendera su dominio a un vastsimo territorio ocupando desde Europa Central hasta el sur de Asia. En el marco de esta expansin, las hordas mongolas conquistaran importantes reinos de Asia, como el Imperio Jin del norte de China (1211-1216), el Imperio Tangut, el reino Kara-kitai y el Imperio de Jorezm.    La transcripcin de su nombre mongol a caracteres del castellano sera Chinguis Jaan. La ortografa ms habitual de este nombre en las lenguas europeas es "Genghis Khan", ya que en ingls y francs no existe el sonido "j" //, y se representa con kh que tiene valor fontico de /k/ en esas lenguas. Por otra parte, la transcripcin espa?ola ms fiel a la pronunciacin mongola sera "Chinguis Jan". El trmino jan (o kan) etimolgicamente significa "prncipe" en persa mientras que la palabra Chinguis significa "ocano" o "universal", esto es: "Prncipe Universal, en la poca se pensaba que la tierra era una vasta llanura rodeada de agua, por lo que tambin se le denomina como "se?or de todos los ocanos" .

Perteneca al poderoso clan Borjigin y era hijo de Yesugei-Baghatur y por lo tanto nieto de un tal Qabul Kan que haba hostilizado las fronteras de la China yurchen y posedo el ttulo de jagan.    Como descendientes de Qabul Kan, el clan de Temuyin tena un alto rango, aunque no parece haber ejercido un poder muy amplio debido a que los mongoles no eran uno de los pueblos ms poderosos en la estepa. Sin embargo, la favorable situacin de Temuyin y de su clan se ve truncada por la muerte de Yesugei, envenenado por los trtaros, y el consecuente abandono de los clanes que apoyaban a Yesugei, debido a que por aquel entonces el heredero no tendra ms de diez a?os.  A partir de este momento la familia de Temuyin (l, su madre y sus seis hermanos) se vieron abocados a vivir en la indigencia, alimentndose de la recoleccin agrcola y de la pesca, agravado esto por la persecucin a la que se vieron sometidos por los clanes rivales, especialmente el de los 'taichiut que aspiraba al posible janato dejado vacante por la muerte de Yesugei.    En este perodo, mediante la participacin en razzias y peque?as incursiones, as como en otras actividades, comenz a adquirir fidelidades de otros individuos jvenes, muchas veces en su misma situacin, que se unieron a l. Cabe destacar un personaje de bastante importancia que fue Jamuka, un joven de sangre noble que realiz juramento de anda o hermano jurado con Temuyin. Es indudable que la posicin de Jamuka ayud en cierta medida a su anda a subir posiciones en la carrera hacia el poder.  As se comenz a formar el ncleo de lo que en futuro sera su guardia imperial. Pero ms importante que el apoyo de Jamuka fue el de un antiguo aliado de su padre que haba sido anda de ste: Toghril, Jan de los keraitas, que le acept como un jefe de segunda fila. Su posicin ahora favorable, unida al propio magnetismo personal de Temuyin, le proporcion la adhesin voluntaria de an ms hombres a sus filas.    En este momento se produce un incidente que va a afianzar an ms el poder de Temuyin: su mujer Borte (tambin B?rte o Bortei) es raptada por un clan merkita pero ya entonces Temuyin est en condiciones de pedir apoyo militar y tambin Jamuka aparece con su clan, de forma que el clan merkita es derrotado y la posicin del futuro Gengis Kan afianzada.    Disputas y rivalidades por el poder llevaron a la separacin de Jamuka y su anda de tal forma que el primero intent retirar el apoyo a Temuyin, pero por motivos de linaje, de carisma personal o de mejor posicin, muchos clanes bajo el mando de Jamuka se separaron de l para ponerse voluntari|`|UsoTy04eaa	Su misteriosa muerte en 1227 puso en peligro todo lo que habaa conseguido, por lo que sus herederos la mantuvieron en secreto hasta asegurarse el control de sus conquistas.

NiuYkbGMaa	The Navigation Acts were an attempt to put the theory of Mercantilism into practice in the British colonies. The object of mercantilism was to minimize imports that cost the nation money, and maximize exports that made the nation money. The belief at the time was that there was a finite amount of wealth in the world and if you don't get it, your enemy will. Colonies were a means of reducing England's dependence on foreign nations. Each colony would provide a raw material to England and this would allow the nation to not have to purchase that product from another nation. By establishing colonies loyal to the Crown, Great Britain would be expanding a dependable market for the finished products coming out of British industries.|`|AA12375660	It's an economic system that is used to benefit the mother country.    http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mercantilis...|`|mnIeK8q6aa	It's protecting your nation's business. It is done by setting special requirements that cannot be met by competitors:   For example, sugar is produced both in tropical countries (cane sugar) and western countries (beet sugar). Beet sugar is more expensive to produce, so you add a tariff on can sugar. Keeps cane sugar nicely out of the market.   It can be done by forbidding shipment in other ships than your own nation has. England did that, which lead to the Anglo-Dutch wars.  When TV were mass produced in Japan, for a while nations found 'technical problems' to hinder import.   Japan protects its agriculture by setting exceptionally difficult standards for foreign products.     The nation as a whole might benefit from mercantilism, but it is the consumer who pays the price.

It is just your concentration, I guess. While reading a novel, just forgot about everything else or in other words clear your mean.     Just try the following steps and it will help:    1) Make sure your room is lit up brightly so you are comfortable with the lighting    2) Hold your book to the right position from your eyes, not too far and not too long    3) Start reading the book from the first chapter itself, do NOT skip anything    4) If there is a sentence that you don't understand, ask someone to help me    5) Keep a dictionary with you. You may often come across a couple of words that you won't understand    6) Keep a small notebook where you write down these words and go through them. It is a great help    7) If you come acorss any interesting sentence, just jot it down in the notebook and highlighting your novel will NOT be a good idea    If you forget something again the novel, just go back to the chapter and skim though it again. If you have any difficulty, write a short summary of the chapter, no matter how long or short it is.    In addition, you will notice that after a few hours of reading your mind will sway away from the book. Nothing wrong with it. Bookmark the page and take break and starting reading the book again.     And most of all, just get engrossed into the novel and you won't forget anything.     Good luck!    And here is a good list of books:    The Secret of the Lost Necklace by Enid Blyton  House at the Corner by Enid Blytton  The Seven Dials Mystery by Agatha Christie  The Alchemist of Barbal by David Clement-Davies  Mirror Dreams by Catherine Webb  Mirror Wakes by Catherine Webb  Lover's Lanes by Jill Marie Landis  Pandora by Anne Rice  The Cold Cash War by Robert Asprin  Inkheart by Cornelia Funke  The Thief Lord by Cornelia Funke  The Secret Country by Pamela Dean  The Hidden Land by Pamela Dean  Champagne Charlie by John Franklin Carter  An Oblique Approach by Eric Flint  Valley Forge by MacKinlay Kantor  Speedboat by Renata Adler  Pitch Dark by Renata Adler  Within This Present by Margaret Ayer Barnes  Seven Seats to the Moon by Charlotte Armstrong  Oy Pioneer! by Marleen Barr  The Kite Runner by Khaled Hosseini  A Thousand Splendid Suns by Khaled Hosseini  The Haunting of Nadia by Julia Jarman  The Indian in the Cupboard by Lynne Reid Banks  Word from Wormingford by Ronald Blythe  Nights at the Circus by Angela Carter  The White Ladies of Worcester by Florence L.

Mother dies- and the mother dies in Two Princesses too.  See what I mean?  And is Sarina her sister?  Because, you know the main girl in Two Princesses has a sister, Meryl.|`|ve4K3rb1aa	wow.    this has potential,  but it isn't great.    loose the word 'skinny'  lattes are skinny,  people are thin    doctor in this isnstance shouldn't be capitalised.    it's all a bit random.  there is no flow with it.    first you are talking abou bugs,  then a wedding dress?  and then the balck death.    it jumps around far too much.  you need to focus.    i would loose the dress,  and teh black death unless she has it.    the sorcerer sounds interestinmg,  but all you do is name him and then ignore him.    i think you need to know where you want to go with this.|`|wqHRZFveaa	The Black Death  i think that would be a good title... you are a really good author...

EL POEMA DE LA CULPA     Yo la am, y era de otro, que tambin la quera.             Perdnala, Se?or, porque la culpa es ma.                                                                                                                Despus de haber besado sus cabellos de trigo,   nada importa la culpa, pues no importa el castigo.   Fue un pecado quererla, Se?or, y,                                                                                                                                               sin embargo mis labios estn dulces por ese amor amargo.                                                                                            Ella fue como un agua callada que corra...   Si es culpa tener sed, toda la culpa es ma.   Perdnala Se?or, t que le diste a ella   su frescura de lluvia y esplendor de estrella.                                                                                                                     Su alma era transparente como un vaso vaco:   Yo lo llen de amor.  Todo el pecado es mo.   Pero, como ?no amarla, si t hiciste que fuera turbadora y fragante como la primavera?                                                                                                                                            ?Cmo no haberla amado, si era como el roco sobre la hierba seca y vida del esto?   Trat de rechazarla, Se?or, intilmente,   como un surco que intenta rechazar la simiente.                                                                                                                            Era de otro. Era de otro que no la mereca,   y por eso, en sus brazos, segua siendo ma.   Era de otro, Se?or, pero hay cosas sin due?o:   las rosas y los ros, y el amor y el ensue?o.                                                                                                                   Y ella me dio su amor como se da una rosa,   como quien lo da todo, dando tan poca cosa...   Una embriaguez extra?a nos venci poco a poco:   Ella no fue culpable, Se?or... ?ni yo tampoco!                                                                                                                             La culpa es toda tuya, porque la hiciste bella   y me distes los ojos para mirarla a ella.   S. Nuestra culpa es tuya,                                                                                                                                                     si es una culpa amar y si es culpable un ro cuando corre hacia el mar.                                                                            Es tan bella, Se?or, y es tan suave, y tan clara,                                                                                                                         que sera pecado mayor si no la amara.   Y por eso, perdname, Se?or, porque es tan bella,                                                                                                       que t, que hiciste el agua, y la flor, y la estrella,                                                                                                                 T, que oyes el lamento de este dolor sin nombre,                                                                                                    t tambin la amaras, ?si pudieras ser hombre!

AA11372183	a few things I can add:    1. Mosque (because Islam plays a big part in afghanistan)    2. Turban (there are very different types of Turbans, make sure you get the one that normal afghan people wear as part of their traditional dress)    3. Kalashnikov (ak-47) (because wars been there for ages now)    4. Poppy pods (they have big farms of poppy pods)    5. Samovar (it's a metal container that they boil water with for tea, very big part of every day life)    6.Afghan rug (hand made ones of course)    and just so you know the colors you mentioned dont represent afghanistan. maybe it works all together, but not as seprate symbols.  |`|ZZL9jMLyaa	Roadside Bombs, camels, Osama Bin Laden, Camel Spiders.....you get the idea.

"pirouettes" make sure your lifted and your pose is at your knee. leaps.. make sure your chest id lifted toes pointed.. basically in all you do have your toes pointed through your ankles and stay lifted at all times!    hope that helps you!    good luck on making the team!

It doesn't have a plot. Bella is helpless and needs to be protected all the time, most of the book is written about how sexy vampires are, and when Bella's man leaves her she starts hallucinating! weak female, sexy strong male, no plot. i don't know what you see in it other than a dull love story.did I mention there was no plot? Try reading something more interesting and don't dumb yourself down to glorified fan fiction! I mean seriously, vampires sparkle in the sun? look at me, I'm a sparkly vampire! sound odd to you? never mind, all Twilight fans are blinded by a dull love story, and never want to hear that their super vampire lovers aren't all that great.

They shall remain nameless.    It was not what I had planned.  Once again a move so quick.  I needed to make my lists and sort out and pack the boxes and label everything.    I knew there wasn't much time  but I knew that I could do it my way.    But it was not to be.    Well meaning people and scheming people got in my way.    So many years have I had to move.  From one coast to another and in the same city.  So many moves and this was actually the worst.    I'm just an old pro at it if I can do it my way.  It's amazing to me what a life it takes on of it's own.  The hurry, the panic, I always try to avoid.    But I wasn't listened to as usual  and a circus of horrors developed.  You would have had to be there and be glad you weren't.    How amusing; I had planned it a certain way.  Sorting through memories and arranging them while listening to Carole King.  Might have happened a few hours now and then.    Might as well had drums beating and horns blowing as we were not heard as to how and what we wanted moved.  Memories of trying to organize and trying to be in all the rooms at once to protect my daughter's treasures.  Insanity.  Oh, I tried being firm and being assertive and even ended up yelling but it all fell on deaf ears.    We felt so defeated but kept moving on.  Some blessed breaks refreshed our weary minds and bodies.    Was it Christmas? What happened to my child's vacation?  I treasured the quiet times that did occur and treasure the people who understood.    I am working on blocking the insanity of it all as my New Year's prayer for my daughter and I.    Our new neighbors gave us a great welcome of garbage and yelling.  What a shock!!! All the drama!!!  Normally we love emotions but not this kind!    We laid on our floor and cried.  But we kept going on and got here finally.    That tightrope of walking between hell and dry ice kept me from falling into it.  Kept my faith even when it was as small as a mustard seed.  Kept my humor even though it fell flat.    Hope my child recovers soon and gets to have some kid time and fun.  Broke my heart when she said, "why are we being tested by God?"    Hope I didn't lose friends by not having the time to return calls.  Sent out ten Christmas cards and that was quite an achievement.  Missed the computer so and words and feelings kept dancing in my head.  But had to hang onto lists and time frames.    Sorting, packing, moving heavy boxes, cleaning and nearly all of it without any rythmn.  Would rather have strangers to move me then people I love who do not listen.    Someday we will look back on this and laugh.  Got the tree up at least and plan to keep it there for January.    I'm taking a break and it's Christmas for a month.    The pain will melt away but I feel so violated.  I could never do that to anyone; throw precious things out against our will.    Had my say and will be on my way.  Thanks for listening and now I am going to soak this aching body in a long bath.    Crave our privacy all the more and want to withdraw into a shell.  Give me time to be sociable;  just need to heal.     Can anyone beat that?

El autor es annimo y pertenece al periodo helenstico de la escultura griega (siglo II a.C.). Est considerada como la escultura clsica realizada en mrmol ms conocida del mundo antiguo.  La estatua se encontr en dos pedazos en 1820 en la isla egea de Melos, llamada tambin Milo, por un campesino denominado Yorgos. Esto habra servido tambin como un retrucano en el nombre de la isla Melos, que significa manzana en el idioma griego. Cerca de la estatua se encontraron un fragmento de un antebrazo y la mano con una manzana y estos restos son considerados parte de sus brazos. Yorgos la escondi de las autoridades pero fue descubierto posteriormente por funcionarios turcos, que cogieron la escultura. Un oficial naval francs, Jules Dumont, reconoci su valor y arregl su compra para el embajador francs en Turqua, el Marqus de Riviere. Despus de algn trabajo de reparacin, la estatua fue presentada al Rey Luis XVIII en 1821. El finalmente la entreg al Museo del Louvre en Pars, donde todava se muestra hoy a la admiracin pblica.  Despus de haber hallado la estatua, se hicieron numerosas tentativas para reconstruir su postura, aunque nunca se restaur.    La Afrodita de Milos (griego: "? ? ?"), ms conocida como Venus de Milo es una de las estatuas ms representativas del periodo helenstico de la escultura griega. Representa a Afrodita (Venus para los romanos), diosa del amor y la belleza. Esculpida en mrmol en un tama?o ligeramente superior al natural, el autor es annimo, aunque tradicionalmente se ha atribuido a Praxteles. Actualmente se encuentra en el Louvre de Pars.    Descubrimiento y autora  [editar]La estatua se encontr en dos pedazos en 1820 en la isla egea de Melos, llamada tambin Milo, por un campesino denominado Yorgos. Cerca de la estatua se encontraron un fragmento de un antebrazo y la mano con una manzana y estos restos son considerados parte de sus brazos. Yorgos la escondi de las autoridades pero fue descubierto posteriormente por funcionarios turcos, que requisaron la escultura.    Un oficial naval francs, Jules Dumont, reconoci su valor y arregl su compra para el embajador francs en Turqua, el Marqus de Riviere. Despus de algn trabajo de reparacin, la estatua fue presentada al Rey Luis XVIII en 1821. Finalmente, el Rey la entreg al Museo del Louvre en Pars, donde todava se muestra hoy a la admiracin pblica.       Dibujo de Debay de la estatua con el pedestal perdido, publicado en 1821.La autora no est clara, porque junto a ella se encontraron otros fragmentos con inscripciones que mencionaban a dos artistas de Antioqua llamados Agesandros y Aleixandros, aunque se desconoce si stos eran lo autores de la obra o de otros pedestales colocados ms tarde junto a la estatua. Se ha llegado a atribuir incluso a Scopas, escultor clsico del siglo IV adC, aunque en ella no se detecta el pathos caracterstico de este autor.       Fama y restauracin      La gran fama de la estatua en el siglo XIX no era simplemente el resultado de su reconocida belleza, sino tambin en gran parte debido a un mayor esfuerzo de propaganda por parte de las autoridades francesas. En 1815 Francia haba perdido la Medici Venus, considerada como uno de las esculturas clsicas ms finas en la historia, que haba sido saqueada de Italia por Napolen Bonaparte. Tras la cada de Napolen, la Medici Venus haba sido devuelta a los italianos. Los franceses promovieron conscientemente la Venus de Milo como un tesoro ms grande que el que ellos haban perdido recientemente. Fue alabada debidamente por artistas y crticos, que la consideraron como el paradigma de la belleza femenina elegante. Sin embargo, otros estudiosos como Pierre-Auguste Renoir la calificaron de gendarme grande.          Caractersticas     Tiene una altura de 204 cm y se labr en mrmol de Paros, posiblemente hacia finales del siglo II antes de Cristo. Est tallada en fragmentos, algo usual en la poca a imitacin de las esculturas crisoelefantinas del periodo clsico.    Aparece semidesnuda y con perfil y reposada expresin clsica en su rostro, sin embargo, su ligera contorsin da lugar a una figura levemente serpentinata, rasgo tpicamente helenstico. El manto, que cae cubriendo la zona pbica y piernas, la convierten en una Venus pdica como la Afrodita Cnidia de Praxteles donde puede estar su primera fuente de inspiracin, ya que este modelo iconogrfico goz de gran xito y fue muy imitado incluso siglos despus. Tambin puede inspirarse en la Afrodita de Capua de Lisipo, extremo que no excluye la influencia praxiteliana toda vez que ciertas corrientes del helenismo escultrico recurrieron a modelos clsicos en un intento por volver sus ojos a la poca de mximo esplendor griego.    Esta estatua no deber ser confundida con el grupo de estatuillas prehistricas conocidas como figurillas de Venus.          Eso es todo....Suerte!!!
Eww0aa4waa	5R and 4R are among the standard picture sizes. The number in 5R means the picture is 5 inches wide and the "R" designates it is a rectangular shape (as opposed to "S" for square in the old photo processing machines).    4R = 4" X 6" or 10.2cm X 15.2cm  5R = 5" X 7" or 12.7cm X 17.8cm  3R = 3.5" X 5" or 8.9cm X 12.7cm    Quick note: Image files from a digital cameras come in several width to height ratio, the most common is 4 x 5.3. To fit in those standard picture sizes, some portions of the images may be lost due to cropping.
kfOpbbCyaa	I'll go against the flow and say you should read The Amityville Horror by Jay Anson.    To me it's the scariest of the three, because it is supposedly a true story. Whew...that's one house I never even want to go near!|`|AA12367393	It by Stephen King|`|YKPo55j1aa	the shining by far is the scariest.     is the amytiville horror good? the book?|`|4e911a1a92f0524d87554578ea0e7544aa	I like IT. Also, check out Bram Stoker's Dracula.|`|fbAecUsSaa	I agree completely with CK1, Amittyville is a spooky, spooky book.  One of those hairs on the back of your neck stand up ones.|`|63b948f89ebc2e053374a20fd8f4b0b6aa	Never read the Exorcist, but I read the other two. I liked the 'Amityville Horror' because it was good and to the point, but in my honest opinion, I liked 'It' better. I thought it was much scarier and I could imagine everything so vividly. Most people who dont read King very often get bored with It though. I know a few of my friends did. If this is the case, go with Amityville, if not, or you're willing to give it a try, go with It.      Now, which would be easier to write about? is a better question in this case.    Amityville horror would be easier if you were doing a plot driven paper on the subject. Since it's also based on true happenings (which is a lie), you could also introduce an investigative quality to your work. Is it true? or was it all a hoax? Answer: it was a hoax and that was admitted, but most people dont know this, and you can still provide proof that it was false.    It would be the better choice when the guidelines ask about character development and literary elements (especially atmosphere, mood, and imagery). It's also a much better author study since Jay Anson wrote Amityville Horror based on someone else's account, whereas King wrote It based on his own imagination.    I do a lot of English work and often have to look at my choices like this. Fortunately, I've written an essay on the Amityville Horror and proved it false (for a research paper), and written an author analysis paper on King and how he builds and develops the characters and plot of It. So I've done both essays.

Kvjy5DE2aa	The Giver by Lois Lowry is nothing like The Host.  The Host is true, in part about a parisitic alien that attempts to control a rebellious human and, through her, falls in love with the humans love interest.  The book is more about the inner turmoil and struggles we face attempting nonconformity within each of our own cultures.

I liked how the book showed humanity's best and worst and showed Wanda coming to terms with that. I felt like it was a very deep book without being hard to read like so many "classics."

AA11372183	right click, go to properties, click on the "details" tab. scroll down, under the Image category look for "Bit Depth". whatever number is there divide in 3 and thats color depth. if bit depth is 24, color depth is 8 (becasue there are 3 color channels)    or if you have photoshop, open the image in photoshop, and in the title bar look for the number at the end. that's colour depth.
e7XoG8a2aa	To get a squarish toe, use paper, but be careful that you don't cramp your toes up. If you use something hard, you may hurt your toes.    Add satin ribbons.  If the slippers are leather it's unlikely that you can make them look like satin, so just clean them up and they should be OK.    I really think that they would be fine without the padding but just with ribbons - very cute.    Have fun!|`|W8XShSnzaa	card board maybe|`|Dp9F20QSaa	just sew ribbons on !! it will look fine|`|f87aEYY5aa	Maybe try putting paper in the toe?? to appear that it has a hard toe.

AA11372183	whatever song you like, google it on the net and get the chords or notes, depending how he has taught you to play.  i started guitar on my own and from the net.|`|nDcSY8UQaa	probably because it's easy, it's  a song you know and can focus on, and right now he's focusing on your finger placement and chord transition which is what you should be doing, instead of worrying about what song to learn next, there all easy once you know how to play.  well maybe not all of them, but it's a lot funner when know the fundamentals|`|W8Uf5LsAaa	You should understand that he is making you learn the fundamentals. So stop thinking of the songs and get perfect with the basics. Then It will be easier for you to play any songs on your own.|`|dHmLs5rqaa	ok i've only been playing for about 2 years but my dad owns a guitar shop in branson and there is one thing that i learned from all my free leasons. you need to learn three chords if you can learn three chord and "walk" into them and change them you can learn hundreds of songs.    you need to learn 3-5 chords first and after that everything will be easy,    A, C, D, G, E after you learned those you can play anything. later on down the road you can do tablature and maybe pick up some more chords like A-minor or E-minor, F, or B.     don't really trust the internet just work on chords first dude trust me it will be worth it in the long run|`|pVCn5p7oaa	You need to get finger strength and basic technique, and playing any song will do it for you.  Learning chords is next, and that is a process that can take a while.  You learn some right off the bat, but some of the rarer or more difficult ones take longer.  Your teacher is probably just starting you off with a simple song to strengthen your hands.
dRSV6Puyaa	Sweeney Todd first appeared in a story entitled The String of Pearls: A Romance. This penny dreadful was published in eighteen weekly parts, in Edward Lloyd's The People's Periodical and Family Library, issues 7-24, 21 November 1846 to 20 March 1847.

Whether it was from the movie--where bella goes to james from the hotel--or the book where she goes from the airport, in reality, alice and jasper would have most likely caught her.     if you mean the very end when bella and edward are dancing, and victoria is there, also in reality, edward should have been able to read her mind or at least sense that victoria was there, so the producers didn't think that through enough.|`|dghVV2CEaa	I would erase the words that say 'THE END" and replace them with "Sequel to be released summer of 09"

NeOwDBulaa	It happens to me only in Harry Potter, and I think I know  why.  I started the series when I was really young; my best friend got me into it. And when I say 'got me into it' I mean that Rowling's world literally consumed me.   It became our main focus when were with the other. We'd play cute Harry Potter related games and pretend that we, too, were witches attending the brilliant school. I mean, what child didn't? Our imaginations were powerful and ruled us entirely; Harry Potter became the main drive of our young minds.  So, naturally, I always had dreams about Harry Potter and being within the plotline itself, normally with my best friend. I believe that I still have these dreams to this day because Harry Potter sculpted a vast, important part of my childhood freedom and, although I'm, of course, considerably older now, I still find my mind lingering again on the prospect of Harry Potter, remembering it all and what it meant with a smile. Because of its vast influnece, it remains in my mind as something more than just another series.  For that, I thank Rowling.|`|DjCLWseZaa	Every night.

I don't know why this happens but its really weird. It happens after I watch movies too.|`|wCaFESnfaa	lol. I myself, have several times found myself talking to some characters from Dean Koontz books.   Mostly though its the books that have the biggest impression on me lol.

Witch is almost like everyday because I go book hunting or read new or old books practically everyday. A book I was writing, I couldn't get it out of my head; that night I slept about it. When I read Tail Of Emily Windsnap sometime ago I dreamt I was a mermaid! It was creepy because I normally don't dream about a bunch of fantasies like mermaids. It also happens when I day dream. Sometimes I can't focus in school because I'm to busy day-dreaming about something book related. When I was little I had a nightmare about a goosebumps book, but that dream wasn't pleasant.

6dmhY4Hxaa	From my personal experience, I really loved the books and the movies of the following:  The Notebook- Nicholas Sparks (I know, I'm such a girl).  A Guide to Recognizing Your Saints- Dito Montiel  A Clockwork Orange- Anthony Burgess. Probably one of my favorites. The writing style of the book is so different and unique, I loved reading it.  Atonement- Ian McEwan  Everything is Illuminated- Jonathan Safran Foer  Requiem for a Dream- Hubert Selby Jr.  Fight Club- Chuck Palahniuk.   The Virgin Suicides- Jeffrey Eugenides  Wristcutters: A Love Story. It's based on the short story by Etgar Keret. His collection of short stories "The Bus Driver who Wanted to Be God" is a really good read. They're all really short but really interesting. And the movie is my favorite!  The Lovely Bones was a really good book. The movie is coming out later this year.  The Da Vinci Code by Dan Brown.    I think I can honestly say that all of these books are worth reading. Maybe not the Notebook since you're a guy, but everything else you won't regret reading (or watching).|`|BGU3VpQFaa	Everything is Illuminated  Fight Club  Night Watch and Day Watch  Most Jane Austen novels  Forrest Gump  Frankenstein  Dracula  Color Purple  I could keep going...|`|af4772f173ca267b8f3a8a7329ca035aaa	I would say the Namesake, The Kite Runner, and some others that i can't think of at the moment.

31N7XIohaa	Dionysius Exiguus (Dennis the Little or Dennis the Short, meaning humble) (c. 470  c. 544) was a sixth century monk born in Scythia Minor, in what is now the territory of Dobruja, Romania, and a member of the so called "Scythian monks" community.    Since about 500 he had lived in Rome, where, as a learned member of the Roman Curia, he translated from Greek into Latin 401 ecclesiastical canons, including the apostolical canons and the decrees of the councils of Nicaea, Constantinople, Chalcedon and Sardis, and also a collection of the decretals of the popes from Siricius to Anastasius II. These collections had great authority in the West and still guide church administrations. Dionysius also wrote a treatise on elementary mathematics. Bede and 'Felix' elevated him to an abbot (a leader of monks) even though Dionysius' friend Cassiodorus stated in Institutiones that he was still only a monk late in life.    Dionysius is best-known as the inventor of the Anno Domini era, which is used to number the years of both the Gregorian calendar and the Julian calendar.       http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dionysius_E...|`|59e4b9f1fd97d5d9ac83813ad5fe645aaa	oh ya easy for a nerdy dweeb|`|gb1BGP8xaa	Did you just search on his name?  http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/05010b.h...|`|0ve51pW9aa	He was a Catholic monk that established the date of Christ's birth as being December, 25th.

I say this because of both positives and negatives - Midwesterners are considered hardworking and dedicated to their children and society.   Southerners are considered less educated and prejudiced.

All three are solid working class states, religious and self-reliant, and given to standing for the traditional values upon which this country was based.

Id appreciate it if you couldbegin by being  open-minded.  He hesitated for a moment. Ill give it my best effort, he agreed,  cautious now.  Im not breaking any rules here, I promised. This is strictly about  you and me. I cleared my throat. So . . . I was impressed by how well  we were able to compromise the other night. I was thinking I would like  to apply the same principle to a different situation. I wondered why I  was being so formal. Must be the nerves.  What would you like to negotiate? he asked, a smile in his voice.  I struggled, trying to find exactly the right words to open with.  Listen to your heart fly, he murmured. Its fluttering like a  hummingbirds wings. Are you all right?  Im great.  Please go on then, he encouraged.  Well, I guess, first, I wanted to talk to you about that whole ridiculous  marriage condition thing.  Its only ridiculous to you. What about it?  I was wondering . . . isthat open to negotiation?  Edward frowned, serious now. Ive already made the largest concession  by far and away  Ive agreed to take your life away against my better  judgment. And that ought to entitle me to a few compromises on your  part.  No. I shook my head, focusing on keeping my face composed. That  parts a done deal. Were not discussing my . . . renovations right now. I  want to hammer out some other details.  He looked at me suspiciously. Which details do you mean exactly?  I hesitated. Lets clarify your prerequisites first.  You know what I want.  Matrimony.I made it sound like a dirty word.  Yes. He smiled a wide smile. To start with.  The shock spoiled my carefully composed expression. Theres more?  Well, he said, and his face was calculating. If youre my wife, then  whats mine is yours . . . like tuition money. So there would be no  problem with Dartmouth.  Anything else? While youre already being absurd?  I wouldnt mind sometime.   No. No time. Thats a deal breaker right there.  He sighed longingly. Just a year or two?  I shook my head, my lips set in a stubborn frown. Move along to the  next one.  Thats it. Unless youd like to talk cars . . .  He grinned widely when I grimaced, then took my hand and began  playing with my fingers.  I didnt realize there was anything else you wanted besides being  transformed into a monster yourself. Im extremely curious. His voice  was low and soft. The slight edge would have been hard to detect if I  hadnt known it so well.  I paused, staring at his hand on mine. I still didnt know how to begin. I  felt his eyes watching me and I was afraid to look up. The blood began to  burn in my face.  His cool fingers brushed my cheek. Youre blushing? he asked in  surprise. I kept my eyes down. Please, Bella, the suspense is painful.  I bit my lip.  Bella. His tone reproached me now, reminded me that it was hard for  him when I kept my thoughts to myself.  Well, Im a little worried . . . about after, I admitted, finally looking at  him.  I felt his body tense, but his voice was gentle and velvet. What has you  worried?  All of you just seemso convinced that the only thing Im going to be  interested in, afterward, is slaughtering everyone in town, I confessed,  while he winced at my choice of words. And Im afraid Ill be so  preoccupied with the mayhem that I wont beme anymore . . . and that I  wont . . . I wontwant you the same way I do now.  Bella, that part doesnt last forever, he assured me.  He was missing the point.  Edward, I said, nervous, staring at a freckle on my wrist. Theres  something that I want to do before Im not human anymore.  He waited for me to continue. I didnt. My face was all hot.  Whatever you want, he encouraged, anxious and completely clueless.  Do you promise? I muttered, knowing my attempt to trap him with his  words was not going to work, but unable to resist.  Yes, he said. I looked up to see that his eyes were earnest and  confused. Tell me what you want, and you can have it.  I couldnt believe how awkward and idiotic I felt. I was too innocent   which was, of course, central to the discussion. I didnt have the faintest  idea how to be seductive. I would just have to settle for flushed and selfconscious.  You, I mumbled almost incoherently.  Im yours. He smiled, still oblivious, trying to hold my gaze as I  looked away again.  I took a deep breath and shifted forward so that I was kneeling on the  bed. Then I wrapped my arms around his neck and kissed him.  He kissed me back, bewildered but willing. His lips were gentle against  mine, and I could tell his mind was elsewhere  trying to figure out  what was onmy mind. I decided he needed a hint.  My hands were slightly shaky as I unlocked my arms from around his  neck. My fingers slid down his neck to the collar of his shirt. The  trembling didnt help as I tried to hurry to undo the buttons before he  stopped me.  His lips froze, and I could almost hear the click in his head as he put  together my words and my actions.  He pushed me away at once, his face heavily disapproving.  Be reasonable, Bella.  You promised  whatever I wanted, I reminded him without hope.  Were not having this discussion. He glared at me while he refastened  the two buttons Id managed to open.  My teeth clamped together.  I say we are, I growled|`|hfNXDCPQaa	Eclipse Chapter 20. That's my favorite scene :D|`|mRQ5SqySaa	I think it was in book 2 where edward broke up with her.

O0amJatTaa	Yea Twilight was very interesting. I dont know if you like animals alot but most 16 year olds do (like me^_^) i would suggest Marly & Me by John Grogan, this book was awesome and by the time i got to the end i could hardy finish it without my eyes watering. Another good book thats kinda related to twilight is Blood & Chocolate by, this is a romantic, supernatural, werewolf book about a girl then she falls in love with her enemy basiclly, but yeah thats a really good book to. In the end of this book you might cry some also. The Outsiders, by S. E. Hinton. This book is diffrent then the others but its still a great book for young adults. Its about the soical life of two groups of teens that are totally diffrent, kinda like sterotypes. There is alot of drama, tragedies, morals, violence, action, suspense, and you will definitly cry at the end of this book.    These are my top 3 books i have read in the last couple years, trust me you wont regret reading these.^_^|`|YpuMiu3zaa	The Hunger Games by Suzanne Collins. Its really good.

They had been heavily drinking. Basically, when they saw me, they raped and bashed. They left me to die when Carlisle found me and carried/ran me to his house, where he bit me.    Chapter "Unhappy Ending", Eclipse|`|GR2XNzCCaa	Read her section in Eclipse. It is very interesting. But if you must know, she was about to get married to the richest man in town's son (Royce King II), she was at a friends house late, and when walking home at night, her fiancee approached her with 4 of his drunk friends and they presumably raped her and left her to die. That was when Carlisle found her and decided to change her, but Edward was upset about his decision and so on. That's how she became a vamp though.|`|V1x2UJpMaa	Rosalie Lillian Hale was born to a middle-class family in 1915 in Rochester, New York. Her father had a stable job in a bank while her mother was a housewife. Her parents were social climbers and Rosalie, who was extraordinarily beautiful, was the ticket they needed to reach their social aspiration. She was clearly the favorite of her parents, with two younger brothers. While growing up, Rosalie dreamed of a lavish life--a life with a rich husband and children as beautiful as she was. Her parents influenced her want of material things, which made her vain and conceited. She wanted a big house that someone else would clean, with a large lawn that she would play with her children on. In Rochester, where she grew up, there was only one family that had what her parents wanted--the Kings. Royce King owned the bank Rosalie's father worked in. His son, Royce II, saw Rosalie for the first time and began dating her. It was a quick courtship and the couple was soon engaged. The engagement went too quickly and wedding plans were made. Rosalie couldn't help but feel something was missing from her relationship with him, despite the fact that Royce was everything she'd dreamt of. She soon began wanting what her good friend Vera had--a husband who wasn't necessarily rich, but one that loved her and was there for her, and a small baby they could raise together lovingly. One night she went to Vera's, and while walking home she realized how late it was and she wished that she had called her father to escort her but realized it was silly since the way was so short. As she continued, she saw several drunken men. One of them turned out be Royce. Showing her off to his friends, he ripped off her jacket and the pins from her hair. When she cried out in pain, the men seemed to enjoy it. They proceeded to beat and later rape her. Royce and his friends left her dying on the streets. Carlisle Cullen came to investigate the grisly scene, found her half-dead and tried to save her humanly. Rosalie had never liked Dr. Cullen or his wife, Esme and her brother, Edward, as he then pretended to be. It had bothered her that the family was more beautiful than she was. Dr. Cullen, who turned out to be a vampire, saved Rosalie that night by turning her into a vampire after he realized she could not survive her wounds as a human. Despite the fact he and his family are vampires, they only fed on the blood of animals, calling themselves "vegetarians". Soon after becoming a vampire, she killed Royce and his friends in vengeance but was careful not to spill a drop of blood, knowing she couldn't resist that. For this particular reason, Rosalie prides herself on never having fed on human blood. Two years later, while hunting, she found a young man named Emmett being mauled by a bear and ran him back to Carlisle. She begged for him to save the dying Emmett, who reminded her of Vera's little boy Henry, by changing him into a vampire. The two fell in love and were soon married. Rosalie and Emmett currently reside in Forks, Washington, but they often live away from the family as a married couple. Rosalie is the only one of the Cullens (except Carlisle) to keep her last name, on account of her not wanting to be a vampire. It is for this reason that she resents Bella for wanting to be a vampire, for "throwing away" everything Rose ever wanted but never had a chance to have. Rosalie is described as being astoundingly beautiful, even for a vampire. She is tall, statuesque and has wavy blonde hair to the middle of her back. She is physically 18 years old.|`|FK0Lc696aa	She was getting married to this egotistical rich guy, and because she was so beautiful, the man tried to show her off to his friends when they were drunk. They raped her, and left her like that.     Carlisle was the one who found her.     You can guess what happened next.|`|y2KWnWKaaa	It explains Rosalie's story in the 3rd book, Eclipse.

She went to her friend Vera's and was walking home when a group of rowdy men came acrossed her in the night. She reconized the men as her future hubby and his friends. The group was drunk and they raped her and left her in the road to die in the night. Carlise stumbled acrossed her and made her a vamp.|`|kv2sMwfoaa	Rosalie was left almost dead after her fiance and his friends attacked her. Carlisle found her on the street, and hoped she would be to Edward what Esme is to him. That didn't work out. Rosalie hated Edward as soon as she heard his voice.

Yrx7HJNOaa	you should spell check first.. because its hard trying to read what your saying...|`|z36j8rmRaa	Hey, great to meet a beginner writer.  Let me see if I can help you.  First, you need what's called a hook for your first page.  Something like this:    Sonder sunk his sword into the belly of the creature.  Its icy fat closed around his hilt.  Just one left.  Only one and he could rejoice in his blood-earned freedom.  Just one.  It would not be easy as this one had been.  Four months moving though frozen tundras to even get a whiff of the icy creatures dung.  How long before he found the last?    Sonder drew his sword from its belly and thrust it into the snow.  "A bloody sword makes for a difficult draw," he parroted.  Father would have been proud.    Remember to make me feel what your main character is feeling.  There is a little rule in writing called "Show don't tell" that means show me whats going on in the story instead of telling me what's going on.      Before: The knife cut Jacks hand and it bled all over the new carpet.    After: Jack felt the sharp blade pierce his hand.  The blood flowed down his arm onto the pristine carpet below.      Before was telling.  After was showing.  Hope this helps. I have given you some links to follow to help you out in your journey to writing that wonderful novel!  Blessings.|`|e30a9e9e5716e986b609ef9728d116ccaa	i recommed you play Mount & Blade you can get the trial from the internet it might help you with your research. you might be a little bit young to start writing a novel, you could try writing some short stories that take place in the medieval era. but oh well anyway, it's good that you are interesed in literature and you wanna write. i can't give a beggining for you, but it seems to me that you have a writer's block. first of all, try to think about the whole plot, the characters and the ending. write them down (only the summar ideas) and then you can think up a beggining. if you can't just start writing whatever comes into your mind. you can always change it. good luck mate;)!|`|d2hrH6EEaa	HEY! get off yahoo answers I think that it's twelve and up. plus, you can't spell fo shizz. and yo grammar? it sucks.  you fail. and never ever ever EVER EVER EVER EVER EVERRRRRR start a story with "one day there was a blah blah blah" that is an automatic failure.    EDIT: to answerer below me  lol why should I get off of Books and Authors? I like to write just as much as anyone else. I couldn't even read his question! Plus you're not supposed to use yahoo answers unless you are 12 and up. Which I am. So why don't you get off? plus at least I'm not posting questions going OMG OMG EDDDWWWAARRRDD. oh yah. that's worse.|`|y9ltHzilaa	Because you are only eleven, I won't be as vicious as I usually am.  You do not want to write a story. From what I can tell, you want US to write a story FOR you, so that you can say it is your story. That is not going to fly. You want us to not only write the beginning, but add a few explicit scenes in there for your personal gratification. I'm sorry, but if anyone answers this in compliance with your wishes, I will be astounded. It's not your story if someone else writes it for you. Write your OWN story. And use a spelling and grammar checker liberally.|`|H2cMlG9Kaa	wth! you gotta learn to spell first! i could barely read what you were saying!  and second, this is your story, you have to be creative with your introduction, and that " one day there was a powerful king", sounds way too amature, like a kid's story or something.  Think of the intro yourself, ask your english teachers for help, learn about motifs and symbolism and learn the tools of the trade before you get started.
f5ULS8qIaa	well when you started talking about HE toll ot became interesting and made sense but in the beginning i had no idea what you was telling to say
i8lzbQytaa	That is a really cool plot. I like how she is blind and he is deaf, so in a way they literally need each other. Nice job|`|DU4DWTSRaa	It's a very unique concept. I would say that with both characters having such profound obstacles, it would lead to a lot of complication in writing and may make the story too confusing and overwhelming for the reader. I would probably prefer it if only one were blind/deaf and the other had something else going on in their lives (e.g. a history of abuse against them, drug abuse against themselves, disease etc) - so that way they could help each other out on different levels and teach each other about what they have to be thankful for. I would also prefer this, as when I first read your concept, my initial reaction was that the characters and their 'chance' encounter felt little far fetched (whether it is or it isn't - it just felt that way)    This is also the sort of novel that I would prefer to read if it were told from both angles, with either character as the narrator for each different chapter or a few consecutive chapters. (rather than from a third, outside party or unknown narrator)|`|klPvo7iwaa	sounds cool!|`|SSmM05guaa	That's really good. But how will they communicate?|`|AlV10Equaa	i think that would make a great story  I have to write a story for english , its about a girl who gets abused  GOOD LUCK|`|vPIHndQ3aa	im pretty sure something like ths was done before|`|Y6TDCkaYaa	im sorry but you shouldnt be a writer    you see this is what people who fail school end up doing they want to etiher model write books or work at mcdonalds which is going nowhere.    this career is an under acheivment!|`|rUNlmQG5aa	Well, at least your thinking like a writer. There must be some hope of repairing their handicaps-i.e., it could be done immediately but the US health care system is so goofy and there is no way for them to get coverage, or if they do its' a "preexisting condition", etc, etc. Also- how many great musicians are deaf, you might want to make her a struggling painter instead. Since you are only 12 I'd say its' an awesome idea.Keep going. You have all the makings of an engaging story but you need to tweak the particular conditions, somehow- sorry if I was a bit sarcastic. I merely wanted to make a point- Good luck.|`|49olAmNHaa	hey thats good & my bro has a character named jaden  But Do Not Revel Ur idea's to eny one else!!|`|DPegPYRPaa	How can he have a passion for music if he has never heard it?

He writes the lyrics and she does the sounds?|`|d6bb91335d2d467b86fe9b280c4c812eaa	That could be tough to write.

But I have to give her credit....I'm counting down the days until the next book comes out. I believe that they will end up together, and that's all I really want. So I have hope haha|`|gPYTkIW2aa	I think that it is for the better of the plot. Mason's death was necessary for Rose to grow and mature. She became a better fighter and was taken more seriously after she fought and killed the Strigoi. Dimitri isn't dead (but he might as well be) so we don't really know what else is gonna happen with that.     Personally I want Rose and Adrian to be together. I love Dimitri but now he's a goner, and Adrian loves her, she should be with Adrian.     Unless I'm wrong, no one else died...    please answer mine--http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index;...|`|VdxhJVoqaa	We don't even really know whether Dimitri is dead or not. I have a feeling he's not. You know she's gotta build up some suspense...it's a book, anything can happen.
ceBTTCPwaa	To Kill a Mockingbird is a Pulitzer Prize-winning novel by Harper Lee published in 1960. It was instantly successful and has become a classic of modern American fiction. The novel is loosely based on the author's observations of her family and neighbors, as well as on an event that occurred near her hometown in 1936, when she was 10 years old.    The novel is renowned for its warmth and humor, despite dealing with serious issues of rape and racial inequality. The narrator's father, Atticus Finch, has served as a moral hero for many readers and as a model of integrity for lawyers. One critic explained the novel's impact by writing, "In the twentieth century, To Kill a Mockingbird is probably the most widely read book dealing with race in America, and its protagonist, Atticus Finch, the most enduring fictional image of racial heroism."

Linking particular characters to mockingbirds reduces them to the level of animals; on the other, it says that even animals are worthy of sympathy and the respect of being left alone. By making killing mockingbirds a clear-cut case of wanton destruction, the book creates a rule for judging more complicated situations.    From Shmoop/Symbols/To Kill A Mockingbird

YPtNr2O6aa	Probably 'flowers for algernon' by daniel keyes - the story is told through the diary entries of a mentally disabled man who undergoes an experimental procedure to improve his intelligence. The procedure had only been performed on mice (the latest being the aforementioned algernon) with excellent results. Before the procedure, the diary entries are very badly written and full of errors and simple observations. these diary entries gradually improve as the procedure takes effect with the mans intelligence eventually far exceeding even those of the scientists who performed the procedure - he begins to see how those people he had thought of as friends were really only luaghing at him and not with him, his intelligence alienating him from everyone he had held dear.  But then the mouse, algernon, starts to deteriorate and his intelligence begins to return to normal. Soon the same begins to happen to the man and the rest of the book shows his decline from brilliance to disability - with simple mistakes slowley beginning to creep back into his diary entries until he eventually returns to how he was before.|`|hU0Wu98kaa	uncle tom's cabin by harriet beacher stow     i love this book because it's really emotional and deep.  you really get to know the characters and an idea of how slavery was really like in the 1800s. i would definetly reccommend this book if you havent read it.|`|NBf5q2f5aa	twilight twilight twilight twilight twilight twilight twilight twilight twilight  saga saga saga saga saga saga saga saga saga saga saga saga   =] =] =] =] =] =] =] =] =] =] =] =] =] =] =] =] =] =] =] =] =] =] =] =] =]|`|jDnNJB2Haa	Harry potter and Goblet of Fire    or    ANYTHING but the city of ember|`|AoLutkcEaa	Hi I know some people will be mad and some will be with me, the Twilight saga.|`|hYLi7xXQaa	Tales of the City by Amisteaud Maupin  The first six and harry Potter books   Lord of the Rings  Sirens of Titan by Kurt Vonnegut  Raw Shark Texts by Steven Hall  Little Children & Election by Tom Perrotta|`|rdEKTBqDaa	I have several favourites so here they are:  Wicked Lovely and Ink Exchange by Melissa Marr  The Summoning (Darkest Powers series) by Kelley Armstrong  The Unseen series By Richie Tankersly Cusick  and  Night World series by L.J.

FNwYzjogaa	http://www.whatshouldireadnext.com/searc...    Here try this site, it should help you. It will give you books on related topics.
	This is a really long question. There are lots and lots of different things that can improve your drawing. What always frustrated me as I was trying to learn is I didn't know where to start. When people say "Practice"  it makes me want to scream. If you don't know what to practice it feels like going in circles! It's like teaching someone how to drive a car by giving them a heap of parts.    anyways rant over... here's some advice lol     1. Get a sketch book and some pens (various types to see what you like) Go somewhere, (anywhere, park, mall, subway, soccer field) Sketch from LIFE!!! This is the best exercise you can do by far. Do quick sketches of what people are doing, Don't worry about details or outlines, heck, use a crayon. Draw lots of gestures, are they sitting, standing, leaning. What leg are they resting their weight on, what way are their shoulders tilted, are they tall and thin, are they short and fat.  you want to work quickly, while trying to incorporate as many things you know as you can. This will help with showing movement, proportions, mood, and general drawing.  Don't worry if everything looks terrible at first, gotta start somewhere right!.  2. Practice Proportions  just spending time practicing proportions is a good way to put them in your mind and eventually your sub-conscious.  Find as much info as you can about proportions, there are 2 main systems, the head-system (a person is 8 heads high) and the 5 eye box system {(the one I prefer), the head is 5 eyes wide, from the top of the head to the pit of the neck is 2, 5 eye boxes) Find these and practice drawing from them. Memorize important land marks, the half way point of the body , how long are the arms, legs etc... There's lots of stuff out there to look up.    3. Learn perspective, 1,2,3 point, curvilinear and atmospheric. Start with 1 and work your way up. Perspective is essential to drawing anything. It helps create depth and realism in any image. Start out by drawing cubes cylinders and various other simple forms, and then start breaking more complex objects down, a bike is just a series of cylinders. A hand is a box with cylinders for fingers.    4. Anatomy. this one's kind of advanced but is essential. Practice drawing skeletons, this will help with your posing, and proportions. Then move onto drawing the muscles. If you know your bones and muscles you can draw a person doing absolutely anything.    I always recommend life drawing to people because it's very challenging and you will learn so much. A wise woman once said to me there is no problem in drawing you will face, that you wont face in life drawing.    Painting adds more complexity - you'll also want to look into tone- shadows / lights and color- which is a whole great big challenge on it's own.      Good luck! - www.conceptart.org   -> my favorite website, head to the forums, very useful!|`|qk2loPdWaa	the best thing is to practice drawing circles and straight lines and later it gets easy but those are the basics|`|944a14c77cfd5df8decc7beffcf31f38aa	From pencil and paper and paint and canvas, sorry that all the advice I know. Practice I knwo the word sounds painful and I kind of hate saying it but its true in art practice is everything.|`|Y0rFpnTWaa	practice makes perfect|`|w8CzcnTGaa	painting and drawing. draw apples in angled lighting and get feel for values and shading then move to painting and look at colors that would best fit the shade your trying to re-create and that should work then move on other things.

IBEVI6YQaa	Hello!  I have read The Host by Stephenie Meyers, and it is her first adult fiction novel.  to answer your first question: no, it is not the same family from the Twilight series, the 2 are not connected in anyway.  To give you a little info without spoiling it for you: The Host is a science fiction novel about a group of alien "beings" who take over humans and use their bodies as a host.  If you wanna read an excerpt from the book before you decide to purchase, visit the website!  http://www.stepheniemeyer.com/thehost.ht...    I really enjoyed the book and I'm not a sci-fi person at all.  I hope you like it!|`|NBf5q2f5aa	i just got it from the library i asked the question a couple of hours ago....u can llook at my questions if u want and c wat ppl answered theres some good answers =]|`|YorMkZYAaa	Let's see here:    This IS the Books and Authors section, there ARE a load of Twilight questions, and there ARE a lot of Twilight readers in this section. What do you think?|`|AoLutkcEaa	Our world has been invaded by an unseen enemy. Humans become hosts for these invaders, their minds taken over while their bodies remain intact and continue their lives apparently unchanged. Most of humanity has succumbed.    When Melanie, one of the few remaining "wild" humans is captured, she is certain it is her end. Wanderer, the invading "soul" who has been given Melanie's body, was warned about the challenges of living inside a human: the overwhelming emotions, the glut of senses, the too vivid memories. But there was one difficulty Wanderer didn't expect: the former tenant of her body refusing to relinquish possession of her mind.    Wanderer probes Melanie's thoughts, hoping to discover the whereabouts of the remaining human resistance. Instead, Melanie fills Wanderer's mind with visions of the man Melanie lovesJared, a human who still lives in hiding. Unable to separate herself from her body's desires, Wanderer begins to yearn for a man she has been tasked with exposing. When outside forces make Wanderer and Melanie unwilling allies, they set off on a dangerous and uncertain search for the man they both love.  Stephenie Meyer is an amazing phenomenonout of the brightness of her mind and spirit comes the illuminated darkness of her stories. For no matter how much pain her characters suffer, Meyer infuses the tales with light and hope." Orson Scott Card, author of the Ender Saga    "A fantastic, inventive, thoughtful, and powerful novel. The Host will keep you reading well into the wee hours of night, and keep you thinking, deeply, hauntingly, well after the final word." Ridley Pearson, author of Killer Weekend         Reviews  Library Journal  Meyer, Stephenie. The Host.  Meyer's YA vampire novels (Breaking Dawn will be out in August) have been touted in the Wall Street Journal as successors to J.K. Rowling's Harry Potter series. And with a fan base that has grown exponentially with each new release, they may not be far off. All of which makes the publication of Meyer's first adult novel even more noteworthy. It lives up to the hype, blending science fiction and romance in a way that has never worked so well. In this page-turner, Meyer explores what happens to relationships when two beings inhabit the same physical body. Earth has been overrun by an alien species called Souls, which invade human bodies and erase personalities. As the novel opens, Melanie Stryder, one of the few human holdouts, has been captured by the aliens and is implanted with a Soul named Wanderer, who is something of a legend among her own kind because of the many hosts and planets she has experienced. Inhabiting a human mind and body is unlike anything Wanderer has ever known, and soon she finds that Melanie isn't quite willing to give up to this invader. Overwhelmed by Melanie's memories and feelings, Wanderer finds herself driven to reconnect with Melanie's old life. As with her vampire novels, Meyer will make new fans of readers "who don't read books with aliens."Jane Jorgenson    Publisher's Weekly: A Love Triangle Involving Two Bodies  Stephenie Meyer, author of the bestselling Twilight YA series, makes her adult debut.  The Host  Stephenie Meyer. Little, Brown, $25.99 (640p) ISBN 978-0-316-06804-8 In this tantalizing SF thriller, planet-hopping parasites are inserting their silvery centipede selves into human brains, curing cancer, eliminating war and turning Earth into paradise. But some people want Earth back, warts and all, especially Melanie Stryder, who refuses to surrender, even after being captured in Chicago and becoming a host for a "soul" called Wanderer. The straightforward narrative... shines with romantic intrigue.    hoped i helped.|`|ZGlty72daa	The Host has NOTHING to do with the Twilight series,  basically it's a sci-fi book. It's all about a race of parasitic aliens taking over the earth. It focuses on Wanderer, a parasite, who finds herself in the body of an older girl from Earth. When she realizes that the host body she is in is still alive and trying to resist the parasite, she begins to feel the same emotions that Melanie, the host, felt. Together they set off to find Melanie's love and the rest of the resisting forces.|`|4D7cuMZ0aa	it's not like Twilight at all  You might like Twilight more or you might like the host, really there two different types of books.  Personally I like The Host more. It teaches you something worth it at the end:)|`|WiXhwyInaa	I haven't read it, but I have it. And NO, they are not the same family from "Twilight. (I wish...)|`|nkMCPx5Vaa	it has nothing to do with twilight! lol.       the host by stephenie meyer is more of an adult read. its really confusing the first 100 pages or so but it is really good so read it!    i loved it. good luck.    i dont want to spoil it so i cant exactly explain the summary well. sorry
AA10729675	Nowadays, the trend that pays off is to write a mystery novel, a who dunnit in the Ancient times, far in space and time.  So the description of the scene of the crime and the way it was committed are exotic.  Ghosts are always good assets in a book.  They will always scare us coming out of nowhere, and when they should be somewhere else.  Sounds and smells could work too because readers can identify with an characters who are confronted with scary or strange sounds and smells.|`|y2KWnWKaaa	Maybe something about a kid who gets lost in the woods and can't be found.

kfOpbbCyaa	Neither her steadiness nor even temper change. Her character remains the same and her affectionate heart.    Her situation in life changed several times. She started out as a child with her family living with a wealthy relation. Then she was the eldest daughter to her father who had inherited the property. Then her father died and she became a, relatively impoverished, visitor in what had been her home for years. Then, with her mother and sisters, she must move to an unknown county in England, away from all they knew and loved, and make a very small home their own. Before leaving her former estate home, she fell in love. In her new home she found out the man she loved had been secretly engaged to another for years. Elinor went through heartbreak twice over: once when her father died, then when she found she was forever separated from Edward. Then another heartbreak over her sister, then joy that her sister survived and joy that Edward was free. The entire book is a series of changes for both Elinor and Marianne.    I'm not sure what other changes she went through, since her character didn't change. She did learn more about the character and nature of both her half-brother and Fanny. She met Mrs. Ferrars, who was abominably rude to her, so the suspense concerning Edward's mother was over. She learned what an unnatural mother is like when Mrs. Ferrars disowned Edward and gave his inheritance to his younger, worthless brother. She found out that a conniving woman who was willing to demean herself in order to manipulate the circumstances can succeed. (This is Lucy Steele, after marrying Robert. She humbled herself and praised Mrs. Ferrars so much that Mrs. Ferrars forgave them both and restored their wealth to them. Mrs. Ferrars, on the other hand, never fully recognized the worthier Elinor nor gave Edward a large inheritance (as he deserved). Elinor learned that the nosiest busybody can have the biggest heart. (This concerns Mrs. Jennings who, though having many annoying traits, showed herself to have a heart of gold, especially when Marianne fell sick.)    Does this help? (Marianne would be a bit easier to do, since her understanding and behavior change by the end.)
mHHy7Foraa	Proctor confesses because at first he believes that it is the right thing to do. Apart from him breaking one of the ten commandemnets (which ironically he forgot about - thou shalt not commit adultery), he is a very religious, honest man. However, he shreds the piece of paper when he learns that it will be put on the church door as he doesn't want it to affect his sons' lives.    He confesses to sleeping with Abigail because he realises that this is the only way that she would be stopped from spreading lies and accusations around the village, resulting in the death of innocent poeple. Again, irony in his part, as this is wht causes his death. He obviously doesn't realise tha Abigail will accuse him...    eLIZABETH pROCTOR REALISES AT THE VERY END OF THE PLAY THAT (sorry, capitals... :P) John is a strong man, and he would want to die a marytr. She says that she cant take it away from him. She is also obviously upset by the fact that her husband has had an affair. She is angry at him personally, but repects him as a person.    hope this helps x|`|4sXYcMIBaa	well they dont c eachother beforehand so how cud she    proctor confesses to save his wife adn all the others not to mention it makes him a tragic hero because he confesses to his dirty deed and makes him look better in gods eye but really its to get his guilt off his chest and save loved ones bcuz then it wud show i forgot wat the girls name was tht he committed adultery with, but with her it wud show tht she was making it all up bcuz she loved proctor|`|8UYWHSZBaa	b

ve4K3rb1aa	i think you need to do alot of research on thi sbefore you even attempt to write it.    trust me when i say that someone commiting suicide is not doing to it send a message. and to to even sugest that is disrespectful.    about 10 years ago i tried to kill myself.  so i know what i am talking about.  it's not something to be treated lightly.  and the only person i was thinking of at that time was me.  i just wanted to die.  that was it.  and years later when ihad a baby i had very severe post natal depression and that fear was at the forefront of everyones mind,  including mine.  having that sort of illness scared the hell out of me.    i don't think,  no disrespect to you,  that you can wite this story unless you have been in that sitaution. the emtions are so overwhemling that you can't possibly understand if you havent been through it.    more recently mycousin killed himself.  he had been going through a lot for a long time,  adn he had been ill for several years,  and it wasn't a shock,  but instead of being shocked and asking why and blaming themselves etc,  the family knew that he was at peace in a way that he never was when he was alive.    there is so much that you need to think about here.  and i really don't think that you fully understand this subject.  you should talk tosome of the suicide charaitues and help lines.  they will be able to give you lots fo information if you are determined to write this.    all i willl say is,  if you must write it, please treat it with respect.|`|0Iio64yzaa	that sounds like a really deep and interesting story!!   i'd read it for sure!|`|UWocyag9aa	Is there going to be a part 5 that says what happens to all 4 of them??...instead of just the resolution?    Besides that...this sounds incredible!!   really..    let me know when it comes out in print...lol    for real|`|mqdkcHDFaa	Written correctly and handled delicately, this could turn out really well.  Written badly and handled crudely, this could be a disaster.  But I think it sounds really good for a basic outline, and I'd love to read a book like that.  Admittedly, I do tend to lean towards depressing books, but this sounds like a book that can make me cry, and that's good.  :)  I wish you luck, and in the future, try not to post ideas like this on the web.  No matter how much you ask people not to steal answers, chances are that someone out there is immoral and lacking creativity and will decide to steal your story.    Edit:  Acting Junkie: This storyline sounds nothing like Jodi Picoult's The Pact.  The only similarity is the common theme of teen suicide.  I've read The Pact and loved it, but it really is quite different from the plot being discussed here.|`|SSmM05guaa	That story will give out a good message to the people who think that bullying others could cause a bigger problem. Good job!|`|Kvjy5DE2aa	This story sounds interesting for sure, but very very very much like Jodi Picoult's the Pact.  Like I said, it sounds interesting, and I believe you believe in it, which is the most important thing, but please make sure you look into Jodi's novel first    Also- 4 stories isn't that high :)|`|gcfaO4RMaa	I have no idea how long it might be, but the story line sounds like such a good idea!  Just try and make the ending somewhat happy, because the rate of teen suicide is so high; you don't want to give anyone any ideas.  Good luck!|`|afWoScNbaa	Well it definitely sounds depressing. I personally wouldn't read it.    It sounds like one of those books that, if you write it amazingly well, high school students will be forced into reading it and dissecting it in the years to come because it "Has great lessons"    But if you make it interesting enough and make the summary on the back page better, it might work out.     Good Luck!

14pjwQPLaa	Rosalie called Edward and told him that Bella was dead, because of what Alice told her of her visions.  Alice keeps warning them that her visions are somewhat erratic, but Rosalie felt the need to run to Edward and tell him what she knew had to be earth-shattering news without a confirmation that it was true.  She started the whole chain of events -- Edward called for confirmation, and got Jacob muttering about Charlie being "at the funeral", which, to him was confirmation -- although the next reasonable question SHOULD have been, "Oh?  Whose funeral?"  As a result, Edward ditched his cell phone in a South American trash can and then took off to Italy in order to commit his own form of suicide.     Alice had, as a wise girl, came to check things out and found Bella alive.  It never occurred to her that Rosalie would be in such a rush as to bring Edward such terrible news.|`|SSfOeCOXaa	i think Alice told Rosalie that she saw Bella jump off of a cliff and Rosalie told Edward that Bella died.|`|h9mDJj61aa	Rosaline told Edward because she didnt know that Bella was still alive|`|8m8CGiUTaa	no.no.no.no.

(which she wasnt)    so then since edward thought she died he went to italy.  and it was rosalies fault because she told him that she died.  and it was a little bit of jacobs too.|`|5I9aWZTyaa	Alice told Rosalie that she saw Bella cliff diving but she didnt see her get rescued because alice cant see werewolves. She told Rosalie not to tell Edward cause he would overreact, but Rosalie did tell him thats why when Alice was on the phone she was like 'Why would you do that Rosalie?" but Edward knew that Alices visions were not always true and he didn't beleive that Bella would do that so he called the Swan house pretending to be Carlisle to confirm, but when Jacob said that Charlie was at the funeral he thought it was Bellas funeral, so he went to italy and asked the volturi to kill him cause he cant live in a world where she doesnt exsist.|`|FE4B8uynaa	Alice told Rose that she seen Bella killing her self by jumping off a cliff and it happens so that day Edward called Rose to see if everything was okay when she told Edward that Bella died.

596cb0e83ef32238ab39c7938f21bbd9aa	The aim of the crusades was to take over the so called Holy Lands. Much of the ambition was to just loot the place instead of saving it. Sometimes there was a success and the crusaders held it but it was never held for very long. They did hold Jerusalem for over 75 years at one time. But that is just a drop in the time line for the Mideast. Eventually, the Crusaders were kicked out.  Last, we still feel the effects of this effort. Many of the Islamic nations still remember it as if it was yesterday and they are not fond of those memories. Hence a successful failure.|`|1fRVcnHiaa	The Christians successfully achieved nothing. It's kind of like how "Hannibal knew how to gain a victory, but not how to use it." They managed to take provinces from the Muslims but shortly after they tended to lose them. Also they never managed to dislodge the other religions from Jerusalem and "reclaim the holy land".

Alexander Hamilton and his Federalists did not like him much for not declaring war in England and read about the XWZ affair.  But all in all my source points to examples stating he was a good and courageous president, not in a military sense, but in a political one.  Adams was born in the Massachusetts Bay Colony in 1735. A Harvard-educated lawyer, he early became identified with the patriot cause; a delegate to the First and Second Continental Congresses, he led in the movement for independence.  During the Revolutionary War he served in France and Holland in diplomatic roles, and helped negotiate the treaty of peace. From 1785 to 1788 he was minister to the Court of St. Jame's, returning to be elected Vice President under George Washington.  Congress (under Adams) appropriated money to complete three new frigates and to build additional ships, and authorized the raising of a provisional army. It also passed the Alien and Sedition Acts, intended to frighten foreign agents out of the country and to stifle the attacks of Republican editors.  President Adams did not call for a declaration of war, but hostilities began at sea. At first, American shipping was almost defenseless against French privateers, but by 1800 armed merchantmen and U.S. warships were clearing the sea-lanes.  Despite several brilliant naval victories, war fever subsided. Word came to Adams that France also had no stomach for war and would receive an envoy with respect. Long negotiations ended the quasi war.

j3ZY1zRBaa	Love is like a white dove soring in the sky  Your eyes glow like a thousand Diamonds  Appealing is your presence so beautiful like a rose  When I see your shadow it makes me fall head over heels for you.    Your smile brings joy to my smile  Not a single fight would make me hate you  In your eyes I found the peace that I wanted  So lets light up the town with our joy.    Because I was born to tell that I love (you)  Feeling so ambitious while I sit beside you  I'm tired of being alone  A person like you is impossible to find.    Let me be your hero  Let me be your angel  Let me have your smile in my piggy bank baby  If I'd ask you to stay would you?      Very beautiful :) I'm sure you will make her very happy|`|5w74mOzNaa	*Soaring  2nd line, don't use 'like' twice (a thousand, not thousand)  It's head over heals...

46zxsu1haa	Yes, you need to be taking at least 15 or more hours a week at your age if you want t go pro.  At your age I was taking 2 or more ballet classes a day, 5 or 6 days a week. At 15 I was taking 3 hours of dance at my performing arts H.S. (5 days a week) followed by another 1 1/2 to 3 hours a day at my ballet academy 6 days a week. Practicing at home is good, but it isn't the same as taking class. You have no one to give corrections. Getting corrections and working on them is a most important element in becoming a better dancer. You should be starting to do partnering at your age and you can't do that at home ether.

The Count of Monte Cristo - It's got love, revenge, intricate plot, and the writing style really allows you to identify with the main character.  2. A People's History of the United States by Howard Zinn - It's a history book but it has a lot of quotes from primary sources to back it up and make it much more powerful. Plus it tells the often ignored or quickly passed over stories of the United States.  3. Gandhi - An Autobiography - the man certainly has an interesting life and it's weird to read about Gandhi smoking a cigarette, among other things.  4. Surely you're joking Mr Feynman - I actually read this before I knew who Feynman was. I think that made it much more interesting. It's also non-fiction but again written in a very entertaining way.   5. The Portrait of Dorian Gray - This story has been redone in popular movies and literature but nothing captures the way Oscar Wilde tells the story of this young man's descent.   6. The wizard of Oz - why not? you probably know the movie, and it's a short book full of extra stuff that never made it into the popular culture.  7. and anything by James Clavell - his books are all drama and fighting during various epochs in Japanese history.

iNXqiDIYaa	The Perks of Being a Wallflower is an epistolary novel written by American novelist Stephen Chbosky. It was published on February 1, 1999 by MTV. The story is narrated by a teenager named Charlie, who describes various scenes in his life by writing a series of letters to an anonymous friend.    The story explores topics such as introversion, teenage sexuality, abuse, and the awkward times of adolescence. The book also touches strongly on drug use and Charlie's experiences with this. As the story progresses, various works of literature and film are referenced and their meanings discussed.    The story takes place in a suburb of Pittsburgh during the 1991-1992 school year, when Charlie is a high school freshman. Charlie is the wallflower of the novel. He is an unconventional thinker, and as the story begins he is shy and unpopular.    Chbosky names J. D. Salinger's The Catcher in the Rye as an inspiration,[1] and he pays homage to Salinger's work by naming it as one of the books Bill gives Charlie to read.

Czpfs8RLaa	Triple Alliance of 1882     In 1879 the threat of expansion by Russia against Austria-Hungary led, German chancellor, Otto von Bismarck, to agree a defensive agreement with Austria-Hungary. In 1882 Italy joined Germany and Austria to create the Triple Alliance. Germany and Austria agreed to support Italy in the event of an attack by France, in exchange Italy had to agree to remain neutral in case of war between Austria-Hungary and Russia. However Italy was prevented from becoming completely integrated into the alliance due to the rivalry with Austria-Hungary in the Balkans and the Adriatic area.    Triple Entente  Bismarck also attempted to maintain good relations with Great Britain. However the exceptional build up of the German fleet threatened Britain's standing as the prime European naval strength. These circumstances led to the creation of the Anglo-French Entente in 1904. German support of Austrian aspirations in the Balkans also antagonised Russia, which in 1907 concluded an entente with Britain. Consequently Britain, France, and Russia, formerly fierce rivals came together in the Triple Entente.    The Prospect of War  So Europe effectively became divided into two armed camps with the indirect involvement in the alliances of several smaller countries. To prevent further expansion into the Balkans by Austria, Russia promised to aid Serbia in the event of war with Austria-Hungary. Belgium was in a difficult position because it had been assured neutrality by Britain, France, Russia, Prussia (Germany), and Austria.    The threat of a European War came close to reality following a number of international crises and two local wars.    1905-06: Germany intervened to support Moroccan independence against French encroachment. France threatened war against Germany, the crisis was finally settled by an international conference at Algeciras, Spain, in 1906.   1908: In the Balkans the annexation by Austria-Hungary of Bosnia and Herzegovina caused the Serbs to threaten war against Austria. Serbia could not fight without Russian support, and Russia was not prepared for war so further conflict was avoided.   1911: In Morocco, the German government sent a warship to Agadir in protest against French efforts to secure supremacy in Morocco. The possibility of war was averted by a conference at Agadir.   1911: In an effort to annex the Tripoli region of northern Africa, Italy declared war on Turkey. Germany's current policy obliged it to cultivate friendship with Turkey, so the Italian attack had weakened the triple alliance.   1912-13: The Balkan Wars increased Serbia's desire to obtain the parts of Austria-Hungary inhabited by Slavic peoples, reinforced Austro-Hungarian suspicion of Serbia, and left Bulgaria and Turkey, both defeated in the wars, keen for revenge.   As a result of the Balkan Wars depriving Turkey of its European territory, Germany augmented its army. France next increased peacetime military service from two to three years and subsequently all the other European countries spent huge sums on armaments and their armed forces.     Eventually it was a Balkan dispute that led to World War I. Although Serbia achieved independence from Turkey in 1878, many Serbian nationalists remained dissatisfied because the Austrian Empire they detested continued to influence control of a large Serbian minority.    For some years before 1914, the relations between Italy and its allies had been strained, and as a result Italy did not carry out its obligations under the Triple Alliance by entering the war on the side of Germany and Austria-Hungary. Instead, after considerable secret negotiation in which the Triple Entente powers promised Italy substantial territorial gains, in 1915 Italy declared war upon its former allies, thereby openly dissolving the Triple Alliance.
LsE1RS0vaa	i think the real monster was victor. you can't mess with death and lives that way all for your own curiosity. he took a human who has passed on and gave him an unwanted second life that wasn't really his own and made him an uncivilized monster who just wanted to be normal agaion but never could be. victor was wrong for leaving him i mean he should have taken responsibility. i think the monster came to him maybe out of respect since he gave him life or just showing that he is more civilized than victor by coming to him when victor wasn't there for him. it was sort of karma for victor b/c playing god is wrong but he didn't completely deserve what came to him.

ceBTTCPwaa	Animal Farm is a novella by George Orwell. Published in England on 17 August 1945, the book reflects events leading up to and during the Stalin era before World War II. Orwell, a democratic socialist and a member of the Independent Labour Party for many years, was a critic of Joseph Stalin and was suspicious of Moscow-directed Stalinism after his experiences with the NKVD during the Spanish Civil War. In a letter to Yvonne Davet, Orwell described Animal Farm as his novel 'contre Stalin'.    http://www.bookrags.com/Animal_Farm    http://www.bookrags.com/notes/af/    http://www.sparknotes.com/lit/animalfarm...    http://www.cliffsnotes.com/WileyCDA/LitN...    http://www.novelguide.com/animalfarm/ind...    http://www.pinkmonkey.com/booknotes/monk...    http://www.gradesaver.com/ClassicNotes/T...    http://www.pinkmonkey.com/booknotes/barr...    http://www.bookwolf.com/Free_Booknotes/A...|`|xJoMSkI5aa	The pigs use propaganda to control the ignorant masses and control the rest of the population.

Squealer often threatened the animals with things such as "Surely you don't want Jones to come back?" He also blames everything that goes wrong on Snowball, who represents Leon Trotsky, a Russian who was expelled from Russia by Stalin. Everything good on the farm is often attributed to Napoleon, which is another form of propoganda, saying their leader is the best.    He uses fear and force by executing all of the animals who admit they were in contact with Snowball. He kills those four rebel pigs and a few other animals. He then later changes one of the commandments from "No animal shall kill any other animal" to "No animal shall kill any other animal without cause." This strikes fear to all the animals that they must not disobey Napoleon.    Hope that helps you.
E28mQDX0aa	First of all, you'll need to get your hands on a copy of Writer's Market and go through it looking for agents. This book has tons of information about agents. Like, what they would like to represent and what they would not like to represent You should pick several (at least five).There will also be different ways in which to contact them, some like email, others like snail mail.     Once you have your list of agents, you're going to have to send out a query letter to each of them. These letters should not be longer than a page and should include: a brief greeting (it's always good to prove that you've done your research by mentioning what the agent has represented before), an list of where and what you have published before (short stories in a literary magazine, etc), a very brief (like a paragraph) summary of your book and a reason why your book will sell and why the agent should consider representing it. Though, I will check each agent that you want to send your query to, since some are different than others. You can find the information on the agency's website.    The story sounds interesting, but it sounds a little strange. But, that doesn't necessarily mean that an agent will pick it up. It's the writing that is also important.|`|ve4K3rb1aa	it's a bit of minefeild to be honest. what you need to do is finish the book. and edit until it is perfect.    after that you need to get a copy of the writers hand book by barry turner - it lists all the agents and publishers in the uk, us and ireland.    along with the contact details you will find whether they accept unsolicited ms or not, and what sort of material they are looking for.    then you send them a query, some ask for just a query letter, others ask of a query plus a synopsis, some want the first three chapters.    make sure to follow the guidelines to the word because a lot of agents and publishers won't even look at your work if it isn't submitted the right way.    get a copy of 'from pitch to publication' by carole blake. she runs a literary agency and rreally knows what she is talking about. it's the best book on publishing i've read, and it really lays it out and makes it simple.    sometimes they will just reject the work, sometimes they will ask to read more or it. sometimes they will pass on that too.,    it can take years and hundreds of rejections before you get published. it doesn't mean you can't write, it just means that you haven't found the right place for your book yet.    don't loose heart.    but the main thing is to finsih first      also,  while alot  of agencies and pulishers are now accepting email sumissions, most sill want it in hard copy,  so you will need to chek the guidelines for each company before you send them anything    hope this helps.|`|e4K1Xkn5aa	First of I just like to say that your book sounds really good.  I think the best thing you can do is finish the book if not already done. Then contact the publishers by going to their website.  I would think the websites would have the information you need to send them your story and see if they'll publish it.  Best of Luck!

Sarah Osborne died before she could be brought to trial.  Tituba saved herself by confessing that she had been tempted by 'a tall man from Boston with white hair' (presumably the Devil) who had threatened to kill the Parris children and herself if she refused to serve him .  Sarah Good resolutely continued to proclaim her innocence, and so was condemend to death.  On the scaffold, when she was asked by the attending clergyman to confess and save herself, she replied scornfully "I am no more a witch than you are a wizard, and if you take away my life, God will give you blood to drink."|`|qmXFCVMIaa	if i remember right it was the  wife of the man, who was having an affair with the  leader of the girl troupe that was calling everyone a witch.

But if it is causing such a huge controversy, then perhaps it shouldn't be forced in schools.     Just my opinion.    Can you imagine?  You write a story, and a few higher up people want to ban your work... something you've spent so much time on; something you WANT people to read?

3258fd9ca0baa8e13a1a5449e7bdca00aa	Two workers were killed in a catwalk collapse in 1956 while the bridge was still under construction, before it opened.  But there hasn't been a collapse since then.  Are you sure you're thinking about the right bridge?    EDIT - for Plasma:  The Mackinac bridge did not "replace" the Tacoma Narrows bridge; they're in totally different parts of the country.  The Mackinac connects the Upper Michigan peninsula to Lower Michigan.  The Tacoma Narrows bridge connects the Kitsap Peninsula to the Tacoma area, making it possible to get from Gig Harbor to Tacoma (or vice versa) without taking a ferry or driving halfway around the Sound.  The original Narrows bridge collapsed in 1940 and its replacement opened in 1950.  Construction of the second bridge across the Narrows started in 2002 and it opened in 2007, giving the Narrows the world's longest twin-suspension-bridges setup.|`|j4CaE6zSaa	it didnt    it has never collapsed.    it has had some deaths from construction and 2 after if was built.   the bridge itself has never collapsed to date.    there was an earlire bridge that did collapse:     Tacoma Narrows Bridge, which opened on July 1, 1940 and dramatically collapsed into Puget Sound on November 7 of the same year.    the great Mackinac Bridge replaced it.
NYU37jfGaa	The Depression was a difficult time for poor women.  In 'America's Women' Gail Collins writes:    'The average family income dropped 40 percent between 1929 and 1933, and while men took second jobs or searched for better-paying employmen in an oversaturated market, mos tof hteir wives stayed home and struggled with what Eleanor Roosevelt called "endless little economies and constant anxieties."  At the bottom end of the middle class, women worried about losing their homes and falling back into the class of renters - in Indianapolis, more than half of the families with mortgaged had defaulted on them by 1934.    The marriage rate dropped.  The nation declared a truce in its war on spinsterhood, and magazines once again ran articles about women who found happiness in life without a husband. "Do you realize how many people in my generation are not married?" asked Elsa Ponselle, who wsa working as a teacher when the Chicago school system ran out of money and started paying its staff with IOUs.  Her own boyfriend, a commercial artist, vanished when he was laid off from his job.    The people who suffered most during th eDperession had generally been poor all along, and now they quickly got poorer. "I have seen fear grip the people in our neighbourhood around Hull HOuse" wrote Jane Addams.  O fall the terrible signs of the Depression, she thought "the clutch of cold fear is one of the most hideous aspects." In New York, Meridel LeSueur, writing an article for the New Masses, said it was "one of the great mysteries of the city where women go when they are out of work and hungry."  Few women were actually on the breadlines, she noted, and there were no cheap flophouses for women as there were for men.    Certainly some single women slept in city parks and even traveled as hoboes on the rails.  Bertha thompson, who called herself 'Boxcar Bertha' estimated that 500,000 to 2 million people were hoboes in the 1930s, and that perhaps a tenth of them were women.  But mainly, the women who took to the road went with their families.  Peggy Terry, who traveled as a migrant worker, remembered seeing a "Hooverville" in Oklahoma City. "Here were all these people livin gin old, rusted-out car bodies.  There were people living in shacks made of orange crates.  One family with a whole lot of kids were living in a piano box."    The sense of solidarity among the poor was often - though not always - strong.  Housewives with very little still fed hungry tramps who came to the door.  Pauline Kael, a teenager during the Depression who grew up to be a famous film critic, rememberd her mother vowing "I'll feed them till the food runs out."  One of Lilian Wald's visiting nurses went to teach a young woman how to give her firstborn baby a bath and found not one young mother but two.  The other girl had been in the next bed in the maternity ward, and when she confided she had no place to go, she was invited to the tiny tenement, where the husband gave up hsi half of the bed to the guest.  "I can't do much for her, but I can put a roof over her head." said the first mother.    The issue of whether women should work was chewed over constantly in the newspapers and women's magazines, with the consensus coming down on the side of not.  A federal law, passed during th eDepression, prohibited the employment of "married persons" whose spouses also worked for the government.  Of the people forced to quit, three-quarters were women. (Eleanor Roosevelt called the law "a very bad and foolish thing" - government salaires, she argued, were so low, a family needed two incomes just to get along).  Legislators in twenty-six states introduced laws completely banning the hiring of married women, although only Louisianna actually passed a law, and it was quickly declared unconstitutional.  More than three-quartrers of the nation's public school districts refused to hire married teachers - unless they wree men.  Despite all this, the number of married women who worked continued to increase throughout the decade.  Most of them were poor women struggling to keep their families above water.'
AA10505866	I get obsession, but there's nothing wrong with obsessing over something at a moderate pace (or at least it's not more wrong than obsession in the first place...probably). That said    This might fit well in a mob setting. I generally detest mob stories, but it could be two "families" solidifying the end of a generation of fighting and bloodshed with a marriage. The girl is the oldest sibling, and her younger brother is worried that her husband might take his place as head of the family, so she's worried about him causing said disaster. Then she stops him somehow, or he dies, or falls off a bridge, or becomes a Shinto pacifist vegan, or something, and then the disaster is averted. And then you can put in another twist: the girl he decides to marry instead of the main girl is her cousin, or younger sister. *twist!* Or not. The mob is also good background for future stories, and there's a lot of material available for building the setting.    But like I said, I hate mob stories. I feel dirty for suggesting this.|`|ye6IiFr7aa	wow that really sounds intresting!! can i have a copy??!!?! i would lovveee to read!! |`|Q49d8oD1aa	well, for the setting, you could make it historical...taking place in medieval times (arranged marriages were common), that way you wouldn't have to create a whole world...just do some reasearch on a country's history (I suggest England or Scottland), then write a story based on what you know of life back then...  does that make sense?|`|0IZ2SYmYaa	That idea sounds good to me. It kind of reminds me of Sleeping Beauty because she fell in love with a prince in the woods and did not know that that was her betrothed.|`|jv0BDTNMaa	Writing a book is an arduous process. It seems like you already have a decent amount of information in your head, so just write it down. Keep writing until you can't anymore. Then go back and revise. Your characters and settings will evolve as you write more. Trust me, things will come to you as you write. Just go for it. But don't expect to finish it any time soon. Good books usually takes years to perfect.

It's hard to explain but it's about the future, after mankind basically destroyed the earth (global warming, destroying forests, polluting the ocean, etc) survivors made a new society where there's no argueing, war, etc. Everyone is considered "ugly" until they turn 16 and have this sugery that makes them "pretty" and they move to this part of town where all they do is have fun and party all day and night. Tally, the main character cant wait to turn pretty. She meets Shay who's a rebal and convinces Tally to leave the city for a night to see what's out in the wilderness. Tally learns all kinds of things about being pretty and the truth is.. it's not really pretty. EXTREMELY good, and the sequals (Pretties, Specials) are even better. It's full of adventures, cool technologies, romance, etc. There's also a fourth book from another perspective and it's set in Japan called Extras, but it's not as good as the others in my opinion.    The Hunger Games by Suzanne Collins  This book is also set in the future and is extremely intense like you're actually in the book. It's setting is in Panem, a city that's now in what's left of North America (which has become smaller after global warming and melting of the ice caps). Surrounding Panem are 12 districts where each year, one boy and girl between the ages of 12 and 18 are chosen to be in the Hunger Games where they are put into an arena and battle each other and try to survive until there's only one left and is the winner. There's also romance in it and gets kind of sad. I cried at one point. haha but it's really good. Stephanie Meyers, author of Twilight, even recommended it.    Deadly Little Secrets by Laurie Stolarz  It's the first of it's series and is also really good. It's about a girl named Camelia who lives a normal life - dating, has friends, decent grades. But, one day when she was picking an earing that she dropped crossing the street, a car was coming towards her and it wasn't stopping. Suddenly, a hot guy shoves her out of the way, saving her life. He left without her saying thank you or asking what his name was. Three months later, she's starting her junior year in high school and there's this rumor about a new guy named Ben who supposedly killed his girlfriend. Camelia doesn't believe in rumors and when she sees Ben, it's the guy who saved her life. She tries to talk to him but he ignores her at first, but later Ben begins touching her weirdly but Camilia only gets more drawn to him. She later finds out he's not ordinary. He can know the future or past of a person by touching a person and he senses that Camelia's in great danger. Really intense but good with a twisted love triangle.    I've read twilight and loved it but i thought these books were almost as good or even better.    Other books I've heard were good and planning to read is Need by Carrie Jones, Evernight by Claudia Gray, Lament by Maggie Stiefvater, Beastley by Alex Flinn, Old Magic by Marianne Curley, Elsewhere by Gabrielle Zevin, the Blue is for Nightmares series by Laurie Stolarz, and Evermore by Alyson Noel (coming out in February)    I recommend Need by Carrie Jones if you really liked Twilight.

k13V3Xj8aa	Star Trek has the best framework I think to be fan fiction friendly.  Having your own starship you not only can do personal stories on the crew interaction, but adventures into "strange" new worlds. The range of things you can write about is huge.  Do you want to be maquie rebel or in the dominion war or a freighter captian...  the clean goody too shoes of origonal trek or the darker edge of Deep space nine.  They even have an alternate universe and time travel in the cannon the tv series'    Star wars has a wealth of cannon (books and movies) to draw from.  I think it's limitations isin having the jedi or seth omni potent and just crushing everything in their path.  Charactors need limitations and weaknesses as well as strengths.  Lucas drew on basic mythology archetypes of Jung if your a skilled writer you can do coming of age youth and wise old man tales.    Warhammer I think is the simplist but limited.  You essentially have groups loyal to the emperor or consider him a false emporer... then depending on who you's perspective you rely on they are heretics.  It can have a lot of action but a story like Alien, Rambo, or Preditor is about flash and fighting... not charactor development.    Thats how I rank them.  In the end it's fan fiction and is about the fan and them having fun playing it the sandbox of the fictional reality of the creator.  Write what you enjoy.  Thats why your a fan right?

Tx8JHmDvaa	no i dont like them. here's why. (i have read the series)  1. bella is annoying, whinny, boring, stupid, and selfish  2. there is a lack of a plot  3. the characters are Mary Sue and Gary Stu, they have no personality, spunk, or the spark of life  4. its written horribly  5. i don't need to read about how "HAWT" edward looks on every page.  6. steph meyer is horrible author  7. breaking dawn was by far the worst book i have ever read. first the impossible pregnancy, and the "fight". meyer sets it up to be really good and then nope, nothing.   8. the ending is TOO perfect  9. bella is TOO perfect when she is a vampire  10. the characters don't learn or change.  11. the annoying fangirls drooling over a fictional character.  12. its overrated  13. it gives girls a horrible message which is woman need a man to survive. especially in new moon, bella becomes catatonic for 6 MONTHS just because edward leaves. then she finds jacob and she'll happy. then jacob tells her he doesn't want to be friends and she's depressed again. come on.  14. the books are sexist  15. the books set feminism back a 100 years  16. my personal favorite, "Twilight made me cry because i could feel a part of my brain dying."  17. it gives a bad name to literature  18. its cliche love. a super hot guy falls for a normal clumsy girl. how many times have i heard that?  19. vampires don't SPARKLE and none are vegetarian. meyer destroyed the name of vampires.  20. shall i continue??? because i have more to say.|`|yon7jR8Oaa	Overall: 10  Individual Books  Twilight:  7  New Moon: 6  Eclipse: 9  Breaking Dawn: 9  Midnight Sun: 10 (has the potential to be the best she has written)    Twilight was the her first book if introduced everyone to all of the main characters and the "love-hate" relationship was amusing.  New moons beginning and end were good (I loved Aro), Eclipse had very good love scenes, Breaking Dawn was intense the only reason I deducted a point is because I wanted to know more and the book just ended, and lastly Midnight Sun is the best because it has more of the Cullen family interacting with each other they are hilarious (plus knowing what Edward is thinking is more amusing than hearing the story from Bella's side)|`|km1vuLUzaa	Breaking Dawn 10  Eclipse 8  Twilight 7  New Moon 3    alot of exciting things happened in Breaking Dawn  Eclipse was kinda slow but still better than Twilight  Twilight was the beginning of e.thing it was alright  New Moon sucked at the beginning cos Eddie wasnt there but it got better in Italy|`|Fed34ceuaa	i totally agree with smiley     sorry i thought the endings were way to perfect|`|QBNRbODBaa	I agree with you smiley, and I want to hear what else you have to say.

hJP9y6kjaa	A noise gate will *not* help you. What you really need is a limiter - something that will keep the signal within a certain level. Closely associated is a compressor, which will restrict the signal but also boost it at the same time, to provide some sustain.    Some links below.

Shortly after finishing nursing school, Becky Phillips, 21, goes to Vietnam, where she has been "in country" for almost a year. Her daily tasks involve horror and blood as the choppers unload countless wounded GIs. She is plagued by many demons, including surviving an attack on a helicopter and watching as two friends died. She and Michael, one of the young soldiers in the company, begin writing, and a romance develops. Then he is brought to the ER, and the cocky, confident kid she has come to know is now an angry, embittered young man who is sent home. Finally, it is time for Becky to return to her former world. In a particularly moving scene, a businessman in the airplane seat next to her all but recoils at the sight of her uniform. Once home, after spending her days in her room and her nights drinking on the living-room couch, she heads West, finds Michael, and tries to figure out what to do with the rest of her life"  http://www.amazon.com/Road-Home-Point-Si...|`|v6yMBpB0aa	the widow of the south?

AnimatorDV: Simple+ became freeware.    http://www.animatordv.com/download7      If you're on a Mac, you could try Framethief or FramebyFrame.    http://www.framethief.com/    http://web.mac.com/philipp.brendel/Softw...    With any of these programs you can set the framerate of your video, and how long each image lasts onscreen (even as little as one frame).

AA11712689	Pencils have been painted yellow ever since the 1890s.  And that bright color isn't just so you can find them on your desk more easily!    During the 1800s, the best graphitei in the world came from China. American pencil makers wanted a special way to tell people that their pencils contained Chinese graphite.

biheycXqaa	yes yes yes yes yes yes yes yes yes yes yes yes yes yes yes!!!!!  I love Edward Anthony Masen Cullen!!!!!! He's is totally my husband!! (if he were real).  My favorite of the series is Eclispe or Twilight because Eclipse has an equal amount of Jacob (who I fell in love with after seeing the movie - even though he is a moronic puppy... haha) and Edward. And I love Twilight because that has the most romance in my opinion.  But I also do think Edward is all wrong for Bella. When she's with him, I get the feeling that (in Breaking Dawn especially) they cannot go 2 seconds without touching each other or stand to be apart. Edward is also a little controlling. Jacob is better for Bella - healthier. Like.... Jacob is the sun and air and Edward is just a drug Bella is addicted to.  I totally agree.....  TOtally TEAM EDWARD!!!>3  Edward=LOVE!!!!!!!!!!!  He just ain't right for Bella!!!  I can;t belive that there are ppl out there who say it's stupid!!  Guess they haven't read it yet! haha|`|JfVxCDb7aa	I've never read it, but I did ask 2 questions online at y/a about it.

Honestly, it is a good series. The characters become well developed, and the storyline isn't bad. I do, however, think it is simply written. Stephanie Meyer does a great job making you fall in love with Edward (if you haven't noticed by the craze), and you'll probably love him too. It is just that now liking the series is just pointless, everyone likes it because everyone else likes it and there's a movie.  Also, the first three are very good, but I think the fourth book was horrible. It didn't make any sense, I'd say why but I wouldn't want to spoil it for you.          I guess it's like Harry Potter, read it just because.|`|LUhVw1P3aa	HOLYYYYY CRUDDDDDDDD!!!!!!!!!!!

He does descend into evil.    While "equivocation" is referenced explicitly in the play (check out the porter scene), it can be considered the entire unspoken foundation for Macbeths thoughts and actions. Equivocation goes a long way to explain Macbeths descent into uncontrollable evil: was Macbeths destiny decided by the witches or himself? It all comes back to the question of whether man can ever actively choose evil, or if he simply falls into it when hes not paying enough attention. This is the stuff of good play-writing, but it was also an essential question to get the folks of England at the time to ask themselves, for the sake of their threatened king  and their own souls.

ceBTTCPwaa	The Scarlet Letter (1850) is a novel written by, and is considered the magnum opus of, Nathaniel Hawthorne. Set in 17th-century Puritan Boston, it tells the story of Hester Prynne, who gives birth after committing adultery and struggles to create a new life of repentance and dignity. Throughout the novel, Hawthorne explores themes of legalism, sin, and guilt.    http://www.bookrags.com/The_Scarlet_Lett...    http://www.bookrags.com/notes/sl/    http://www.sparknotes.com/lit/scarlet/    http://www.cliffsnotes.com/WileyCDA/LitN...    http://www.novelguide.com/thescarletlett...    http://www.pinkmonkey.com/booknotes/monk...    http://www.gradesaver.com/ClassicNotes/T...    http://www.pinkmonkey.com/booknotes/barr...|`|xJoMSkI5aa	The forest and wilderness are seen as the home or dwelling place of evil by the townspeople. Such a wilderness is compared to the moral wilderness in which the narrator situates Hester: "moral wilderness; as vast, as intricate and shadowy, as the untamed forest" (18.2). The forest contrasts with the town, or "civilization," the former representing a place where passion and emotion reign, and the latter, a place where law and religion prevail. Interestingly, Hester lives on the edge of town, on the border between wilderness and civilization. She straddles both worlds.    From Shmoop/Scarlet Letter

Z0v6G0Kgaa	1.  Iwo Jima was our first experience trying to take Japanese soil (as opposed to land they'd captured like Guam).  And for the first time with us on the offensive, our casualities were greater than the Japanese.  Iwo was a shocking experience.  Than the Japanese copied those tactics (don't defend the beaches, connect bunkers and spider holes, interlocking lanes of fire, stay in the holes and make the Americans dig you out) at Okinawa and casualties were worse.  And then the Japanese introduced the Kamikazes in large numbers at Okinawa.  The US concluded (as the Japanese intended us to conclude) that invading the mainland would be a bloody and brutal affair.  The US estimated 1 million US casualties (250k, the rest wounded) to take the southern island of Kyushu and 1 million DEAD Americans to take the mainland proper.    2.  Civilian casualties.  At Okinawa, the Japanese military told lies to the civilians (most of whom were not actually Japanese but Okinawan natives--regarded as lower caste and not really Japanese).  They told them that Americans would rape and torture.    Over 45% of the civilians on Okinawa killed themselves.  Some with grenades borrowed from soldiers, others hurling themselves off of cliffs or using knives.  They killed their children too.  If that percentage is an indicator, than over 10 million Japanese civilians would have killed themselves in an invasion of the mainland islands.  And this ignores those we'd have killed with ground support artillery and airpower.  Or all the civilians who'd be killed fighting us (the Japanese were training women to charge our troops with bamboo spears and children under 10 to throw themselves at tanks as they detonated anti-tank mines).  And of course, Japanese soldiers usually had casualty rates of near 98% or higher.  So invading the mainland could have easily resulted in total Japanese dead of over 15 million people as they fought tanks and aircraft with bamboo spears and 8 year old suicide bombers.  And Japan as a country would have been flattened--much like Berlin after the Russians were through with it.  Which gets us to....    3.  The war ended before Russia could do much.  If it had come to a land invasion, by then Russia would have owned ALL of Korea (and certainly would not have given it back).  They did take Sakhalin Island.  But instead they'd have taken more land (the war ended before they could).  And just like Sakhlin Island (which they did seize), they'd have kept it--probably  all of Hokkaido.  Japan would be a shell of what it is now.    4.  We were greatly offended that the Japanese attacked us without warning (due to a decoding problem in their embassy in Washington), we considered them liars and unethical.  Supposedly the Japanese were negotiating with the Russians to end the war.  But Russia never told us.  Furthermore, the Japanese had also launched a surprise attack against the Russians in the Russo-Japanese war and the Russians didn't trust the Japanese.  Then, once the Allies had met at Potsdam, we publicly called upon the Japanese to surrender and they refused.  After we bombed Hiroshima we again called on them to surrender and they refused.  The Russians declared war and they refused to surrender.  We bombed Nagasaki and they refused to surrender.  Only when the Emperor intervened and several days after Nagasaki did they surrender.  And even then there was a coup attempt to prevent the surrender.  So anyone who argues that Japan was ready to give up, that they were ready to surrender and we were just "piling on" is full of it.  The Japanese were given multiple opportunities to to surrender and refused every time.    Last thought:  technically we didn't "nuke" Japan.  We didn't use nuclear weapons, we used atomic ones.|`|ZmdIlkpQaa	1.  Japan was making ready to defend the beaches against the planned US invasion.  The Emperor had appealed to the people for the "sacrifice of 10 million Japanese lives " to drive the invader back into the sea, and they were training school children and even women how to employ sticky bombs, bamboo spears, and molotov cocktails to this end.  It has been estimated that the invasion would have cost 250,000 or 500,000 American lives, and perhaps as many as several million Japanese lives.      2.  Targeting of entire cities was not out of the ordinary.  Please see the fire bombings of Dresden, Hamburg and Tokyo in the year or so leading up to the dropping of the atom bombs.  The only difference at Hiroshima and Nagasaki was the radiation, and the fact that the raids required only a couple of bombers, and thus only risked the lives of a handful of American aircrew.    3.  The dropping of the bombs was kind of a last ditch effort and was also part of a larger bluff.  The US had only two bombs completed, and one more on Tinian that was no assembled.  There were no more bombs, and it would be many months until more could be produced.  Between the dropping of the first and second bombs, leaflets were spread across Japan warning that we would continue to destroy their cities at will until they surrendered.  The Japanese Right actually staged a coup to prevent surrender after Hiroshima was destroyed, but the leaflets and the destruction of Nagasaki finally convinced the Emperor.  Had they not believed the bluff, the US would not have been able to bomb another city, and was, in fact, saving the last bomb to drop ahead of the invasion, planned to start in November, 1945.|`|1fRVcnHiaa	It did make a really cool explosion... but other than what you said there  are no really good reasons. Japan had been training civilians to fight to the death against the allies. A reason might be that we would have had a second Berlin wall as Russia was about to launch a landing as well.
JIFi4Cvmaa	Geiger, Emily (c. 1763-c. 1793), revolutionary courier and folk heroine, was probably born in Upcountry South Carolina among German-speaking Swiss who began settling in the so-called Dutch Fork between the Broad and Saluda rivers in the 1730s. Early Geiger grants were in Saxegotha Township. Some traditions name her parents as John and Barbara Zanger Geiger.  Although some Germans and other Upcountry residents were neutral early in the Revolutionary War, the Dutch Fork evinced pro-British behavior in 1775 and again in 1780-1781 when the British initiated their Southern Campaign. In May-June 1781, Nathanael Greene, Continental commander in the south, besieged Fort Ninety-Six, about two day's distance west of the Dutch Fork. The arrival of Francis Lord Rawdon with reinforcements to evacuate the fort brought the opposing commanders into proximity.  What happened next is the stuff of history and myth, as stories in the nineteenth century were elaborated and propelled by copying without source citations. According to Elizabeth Ellet, author of Women of the American Revolution (1848), Emily Geiger, then a young girl, did heroic service as a courier in the service of Greene. Ellet claimed to have interviewed acquaintances of women whose contributions to independence she recounted, and she corresponded with collectors of oral tradition in several states. Ellet's account of Geiger appeared in quotation marks without an indication of the source. Ellet related that Emily Geiger volunteered to take a written message from Greene to General Thomas Sumpter through an area of "blood-thirsty Tories." She was intercepted by Rawdon's scouts, and "an old Tory matron" was summoned to search her. Alone briefly, "as soon as the door was closed, she ate up the letter piece by piece." Released following the search, "she took a route somewhat circuitous to avoid further detection and delivered Greene's verbal message to Sumter."
AA11441385	Economic conditions after the First World War, and political and social instability, created a climate conducive to the rise of strong leaders who promised to restore prosperity and stability.  The premise inherent in their rise was that the short term disadvantage in the surrender of rights and freedoms would be outweighed by the eventual return of prosperity.  Typically, the strong leaders sought the support of all of, or factions of, the military.  Thus was the scene set for the ascension of Mussolini and Franco (and, incidentally, Hitler.)|`|XjcER6zvaa	start by giving  facts not discuss in class.

AA10084471	First of all, you should understand it primarily as a parody, and probably a parody of more than one target:  of stream-of-consciousness jumble; of the tendency in some books to revert to a foreign language for dirty parts.      Next you should understand that it does not make literal sense; it is not correct in any language and cannot really be translated.    But the fun is trying to pick out the meaning. I'm not the best at it.  (By the way, look at "the Annotated Lolita" which footnotes all this kind of thing in the book.  Any academic library will have it.)    Okay I managed to find the approximation in The Annotated Lolita:    "The sap ascendeth, pulsates, burning, itching, most insane, elevator clattering, pausing, clattering, people in the corridor.  No one but death would take this one from me!  Slender little girl, I thought most fondly, observing nothing at all."|`|944a14c77cfd5df8decc7beffcf31f38aa	I think it may be in Latin look it up in a latin to english translator, you can find one on google.

ElLBELGeaa	In terms of Musical Theatre, he is the best there is. Andrew Lloyd Webber's shows have completely turned the world around. Lloyd Webber takes Rock 'N Roll to whole new levels with some of his musicals. Most of his musicals have changed the music and theatre industry. For example, during the early 1980's, Broadway was in it's worst financial decline in years and then in 1982 Andrew Lloyd Webber's Cats opened and ran for 19 years (a total of 7,485 performances). ALW's Starlight Express was one of the first that had the whole cast perform the show on roller skates (a 3 hour show). ALW's The Phantom of the Opera is probably the best known musical in the world. That show opened on Broadway in 1988 and is currently still running (21 straight years). Even go back before those shows, ALW teamed up with lyricist Timothy Rice to write Joseph and the Amazing Technicolor Dreamcoat, Jesus Christ Superstar, and Evita. Jesus Christ Superstar was made into a film in 1976 and two of the stars of that movie were nominated for Golden Globes. Andrew Lloyd Webber has had is bad shows. Jeeves (1976) was a complete failure. Tell Me On A Sunday (1978) wasn't much better. Song and Dance (1984, a remake of Tell Me On A Sunday) didn't last long but did win a Tony Award for Best Actress in a Musical (Bernadette Peters). Starlight Express (1986) lasted 3 years on Broadway (18 years in London, Aspects of Love (1989) was long and quite frankly, boring. Sunset Boulevard (1994, based off the Billy Wilder film) made a big impact on Broadway at first and then closed, owing its producers $25 million. Whistle Down the WInd (1998) was a success but never opened on Broadway (The song "No Matter What" from that musical went on to go Platinum in 25 countries). The Beautiful Game (2000) didn't make it to Broadway, Bombay Dreams (2002) closed after it opened, and The Woman in White (2004) was a bad idea to start with. You probably by now think I'm a dork and why I told you all this doesn't make any sense. However, if your going to ask a question, you should get a complete answer in return.|`|IBEVI6YQaa	Andrew Lloyd Webber is a world famous composer for musicals and the like. You may  probably remember the musical Cats that ran on Broadway and London (where it ran for 21 years).  Webber was the composer for this musical as well.  Another more popular show of his was The Phantom of the Opera (still running today on Broadway).  He has also composed songs for the Olympics.  Webber is a genius composer and without his music, many of us wouldn't be able to enjoy the movies and shows we so love today.

They have bizzare title but they're GREAT! :)|`|wdvUNvz6aa	i completely agree and alot of hers are romantic but there are others by catherine clark, kate cann, rachael hawthorne, they are just like cute reads nothing too heavy|`|mO1s4pMgaa	Uglies series by Scott Westerfeld  This is an extremely good book. It's hard to explain but it's about the future, after mankind basically destroyed the earth (global warming, destroying forests, polluting the ocean, etc) survivors made a new society where there's no argueing, war, etc. Everyone is considered "ugly" until they turn 16 and have this sugery that makes them "pretty" and they move to this part of town where all they do is have fun and party all day and night. Tally, the main character cant wait to turn pretty. She meets Shay who's a rebal and convinces Tally to leave the city for a night to see what's out in the wilderness. Tally learns all kinds of things about being pretty and the truth is.. it's not really pretty. EXTREMELY good, and the sequals (Pretties, Specials) are even better. It's full of adventures, cool technologies, romance, etc. There's also a fourth book from another perspective and it's set in Japan called Extras, but it's not as good as the others in my opinion.    The Hunger Games by Suzanne Collins  This book is also set in the future and is extremely intense like you're actually in the book. It's setting is in Panem, a city that's now in what's left of North America (which has become smaller after global warming and melting of the ice caps). Surrounding Panem are 12 districts where each year, one boy and girl between the ages of 12 and 18 are chosen to be in the Hunger Games where they are put into an arena and battle each other and try to survive until there's only one left and is the winner. There's also romance in it and gets kind of sad. I cried at one point. haha but it's really good. Stephanie Meyers, author of Twilight, even recommended it.    Deadly Little Secrets by Laurie Stolarz  It's the first of it's series and is also really good. It's about a girl named Camelia who lives a normal life - dating, has friends, decent grades. But, one day when she was picking an earing that she dropped crossing the street, a car was coming towards her and it wasn't stopping. Suddenly, a hot guy shoves her out of the way, saving her life. He left without her saying thank you or asking what his name was. Three months later, she's starting her junior year in high school and there's this rumor about a new guy named Ben who supposedly killed his girlfriend. Camelia doesn't believe in rumors and when she sees Ben, it's the guy who saved her life. She tries to talk to him but he ignores her at first, but later Ben begins touching her weirdly but Camilia only gets more drawn to him. She later finds out he's not ordinary. He can know the future or past of a person by touching a person and he senses that Camelia's in great danger. Really intense but good with a twisted love triangle.    I've read twilight and loved it but i thought these books were almost as good or even better.    Other books I've heard were good and planning to read is Need by Carrie Jones, Evernight by Claudia Gray, Lament by Maggie Stiefvater, Beastley by Alex Flinn, Old Magic by Marianne Curley, Elsewhere by Gabrielle Zevin, the Blue is for Nightmares series by Laurie Stolarz, and Evermore by Alyson Noel (coming out in February)    I recommend Need by Carrie Jones if you really liked Twilight. I heard it was really similar but with werewolves instead of vampires and more. Some people told me they liked it better than Twilight too. So yeah.. you should check it out|`|YjCfu0heaa	Have you tried reading something that isn't "teen" or "romance"?  Nothing wrong with it, just that there are more books out there, that don't have a cute guy and girl falling in love. Nothing wrong with trying out some great crime-drama, or the old classics, right? Just because you're a teen (and I am assuming you are one) doesn't mean that you have to settle for books for teens, right?  Anyway, try finding a book called, "Razzle". I forgot the author, but it is called that. It's for teens, and it's a romance novel; real nice story.
AA10303012	How about because it is morally unjust and immoral to "own" another human being.    The decision against slavery wasnt so much a "decision" as it took a terrible bloody war to resolve the issue.  The outcome was that slavery was abolished, the slaves were freed, the South was severely damaged during the war, and black people are still  trying to achieve equality.

RdjyNxHlaa	Religions in the East tend to believe in several Gods, Goddesses, etc. They don't turn to their scriptures as much as people do in the West (ex. The Bible, The Tanakh, etc)    Hinduism instead of believing in one "God", believes in something called Brahman. Brahman is the absolute, the ultimate reality, the universal essence that is present in all things.    What we call reincarnation, Hinduism calls Samsara. In their religion, it's a bad thing to be born again into another form because it's like aimlessly wandering through life and not achieving liberation by breaking out of the cycle of rebirth (Samsara).    You might also have heard about Karma in the Hindu religion. Karma is the principle that actions have effects that will affect the present life and determine the quality of future lifetimes.    There's much more you can learn by reading a book about it or taking a class on it.|`|77NzfiVkaa	What is the significance of Christian religion?

ceBTTCPwaa	Brave New World is a novel by Aldous Huxley, written in 1931 and published in 1932. Set in the London of AD 2540 (632 A.F. in the book), the novel anticipates developments in reproductive technology and sleep-learning that combine to change society. The future society is a living embodiment of the ideals futurism was founded by.    http://www.bookrags.com/Brave_New_World    http://www.bookrags.com/notes/bnw/    http://www.sparknotes.com/lit/bravenew/    http://www.cliffsnotes.com/WileyCDA/LitN...    http://www.novelguide.com/bravenewworld/...    http://www.pinkmonkey.com/booknotes/monk...    http://www.gradesaver.com/ClassicNotes/T...    http://www.pinkmonkey.com/booknotes/barr...    http://www.bookwolf.com/Free_Booknotes/B...    http://summarycentral.tripod.com/bravene...|`|xJoMSkI5aa	1. Huxley wrote that the focus of Brave New World isn't science itself, but science as it affects people. The vision he paints of a technological, futuristic society is both horrifying and fascinating. In a world where people are controlled down to their very impulses, emotions, and thoughts, science has the ability both to imprison (by conditioning, for example) and to set free (the frontiers of scientific discovery often lead to change).    From Shmoop/Brave New World|`|7basZRQ7aa	Brave New World has LOTS of support for all of those.  The idea of mass producing humans goes with the science creating a social balance, therefore destroying civilization (as we know it).    Everyone's life is predetermined and their personal meaning is lost, just the meaning of their part for the society remains. Our God is replaced by 'Our Ford' and everyone does pretty much the same thing, enjoying the pleasures of daily life. Since nobody has the passion as that for God, there's no questioning life, only following it.    As for art, it's creative. Helmholtz, who has somewhat of a yearning to write, was a problem at the end and thrown out of the society. It causes people to view things from their own way. If everyone in a world is conditioned to view something the same way, this would cause problems in keeping those beliefs strong. Art would destroy the social balance, just like a belief in God would.    I hope any of this helped you out, sorry if I'm vague at times.
CUiNJLWmaa	It's by Cate Tiernan.  And I don't think it's like the Twilight series, this one looks like it actually has a plot.
iNXqiDIYaa	The book consists of a series of short stories, many of which deal with God and Christianity. The title story consists of letters written by the archangel Satan to archangels, Gabriel and Michael,[1] about his observations on the curious proceedings of earthly life and the nature of man's religions. Other short stories in the book include a bedtime story about a family of cats Twain wrote for his daughters, and an essay explaining why an anaconda is morally superior to Man    The Creator sat upon the throne, thinking. Behind him stretched the illimitable continent of heaven, steeped in a glory of light and color; before him rose the black night of Space, like a wall. His mighty bulk towered rugged and mountain-like into the zenith, and His divine head blazed there like a distant sun. At His feet stood three colossal figures, diminished to extinction, almost, by contrast -- archangels -- their heads level with His ankle-bone.
AA11898755	Good grief.....first,try to ignore the ignorant while they wait to evolve.    An individual (woman) makes choices, whether to participate in the dictates of societal repression, personal devotion or assertive personal expression. The title implies that within any system the interior reality of the individual may be remarkably different from the costuming associated with the system within which she exists. A woman in a repressive, system of backward ignorance and brutality may hold to a philosophy of freedom of thought and liberality of justice that is at apparent odds with her mode of dress. On the other hand one who chooses a seeming assertion of great freedom and openness may in fact be plagued with interior doubt and harsh judgement. It is a more nuanced take on the old saw "never judge a book, et.c."|`|4aveC2aaaa	you want me to do your homework for you alessio?    well:    the illustration depicts the different beliefs of different religions.   the one on the left is clearly islam and shows the modest beliefs of the religion, whereas the one on the right is christianity and also the modestness of the Bible. as for the one in the middle, this is the result of not following the exact words of the Bible and Quran, where you have people acting on behalf of their own selves.     or, the lady on the left, Islam, can represent the east, and the christian lady can represent the religious christian areas, and the on in the middle, can be the west     ^_^ hope i helped
AA10015648	The Chamber of Secrets movie had all the spells wrong - according to that movie, all spells just flung people across the room.

vryw9udtaa	well, there were a lot of little things. in the early books, they would be mean to each other for no reason- that's what kids do when they like someone. and then ron gets really jealous when hermione goes with krum to the yule ball in GoF. and then when ron goes out with lavender, hermione gets extremely jealous of her. and then there are small little things, like them talking about who they were going to slughorn's party with in HBP. and then when hermione smelled the amortentia, she was explaining what she smelled and stopped, because she was about to say something about ron. and how they just grew closer over the years. ron is always very protective of hermione. and in the last book, it says that they were almost holding hands while they were sleeping in grimmauld place. and hermione cried on ron's shoulder at dumbledore's funeral. just a lot of little hints sprinkled throughout the books.|`|AA12090951	There were never straight forward hints.  It was more of a tension thing, them fighting, feeling awkward when hugging, not being as close as Harry and Hermione in the friendship sort of way. I think they just had to get mature enough to recognize their feelings for what they were.
HE3IkyL8aa	Could I hug you? Please?  I'm just so...glad you think Harry could beat Edwards ****. LOL.  Well, I think...    Stephenie:   Much too repetitive. She uses "incredulous" at least 50 times in Twilight alone. Have a range of vocabulary.   Her grammar...is horrid. You should edit the heck out of your work and get other people to edit it too (peer editing?).   Weak plot. It saddens me every time I hear about how the series is exciting. Especially Breaking Dawn. Make sure you don't write too much about things that are unnecessary. If you haven't read it, Steph writes about this huge ordeal about Bella worrying and she never needed to worry anyway because Edward always comes through in the end. Complete waste of time.     JK:  I don't think you're planning to write novels, but JK connects the plots of all of her books, it's so awesome. She's very sophisticated and you can tell the difference between Meyer and Rowling. Rowling obviously had more/a better writing education.    You're only 15 years old, so don't worry too much about it. You might sound a bit like Meyer, but think about it, she made a nice bit of money off of her series. She had a unique idea.   Just write how YOU write, don't concentrate TOO much on being nonMeyer.|`|5wg7tKc6aa	Hahahahahahhahahahahahahahahhahahahaaha I LOVE YOU!|`|2l8AsMlFaa	If you have an idea for a story, write down everything about that idea  for now, later when you have more time than expand on it.|`|3hIr3Dllaa	use your voice and you'll sound lik eyou|`|CoGTm3lVaa	OH MY GOSH!!!!!!!

You won't get influenced, that way|`|n7lL0Q4uaa	As they say "know thy enemy"    To make sure you don't go down the literary path of Stephanie Meyer, I suggest you read the books of her, J.K Rowling, and any other authors you hate and adore. Analyze the books; why do you hate the ones you do? The unrealistic characters? The lack luster wording? Why do you love the books you do? The sentence structures? Plot flow?     By analyzing your books you can  exclude the things you've found you dislike in books like the one S.M writes and make sure they never see the light of day in your works.

BZwJeuMGaa	yes.    each actor (the main ones) signed a contract that said if they were to continue the series to make them into films, they would be in them.    nothing to worry about. unless a serious anti-twilight fan kills him.     lets pray that wont happen.|`|nXi9GLtxaa	definitly new moon  he said in an interview once "y would i stop after this series i probably wont be working" so i would say its safe to say most likely all of them|`|Xfjea9feaa	hes doing new moon and eclipse, but he said in an interview that he hasnt signed on for breaking dawn...=[|`|dHjjLozcaa	I think that as of right now, the only thing that is confirmed is that he is definitely doing New Moon.

Oh and interesting facts.  This isn't a solid fact it is just my opinion by the way.|`|YKMu1jJ8aa	i can't chose. they are like completely different type of books. they both rock ^-^|`|d4f069f2e54b4e587428e8c0a60fc4c7aa	Hem. I speak for all antitwilighters when I say it is the worst book ever written. (I've read the entire series, including Midnight Sun, fyi) It is seriously just a bad fanfiction about vampires, that is what Stephanie meyers writing is like. She seems to have the mind of fifteen-year-old girl desperate to get a boyfriend. Bella's patheticness borders on sexism and all of the character's are extremely one-dimenstional. Example (description of personalities):  Bella: Mary Sue/ pathetic  Edward: generic   Alice: nice  Emmett: macho? can't really think of anything else to describe him, though "macho" isnt a personality trait.  Rosalie: b*tch  Jasper: ???? He has no personality! I'm dead serious!!!!   Carslie: father  Esme: mother    That's about all of their personality.     There are so many disturbing things throughout the entire series that are seen as completely normal! For instance, Edward stalks Bella! He watches her sleep every night and listens to her when she sleeps! CREEPY! Also, the fact that she gets pregnant when she's a teenager doesn't seem to weird anyone out because it's "true love". Or the fact that, the first time they had sex, he BEAT her up! And, of course, the fact that he gave her a c-section with his teeth because her baby was destroying her from the inside wasn't odd, oh no. Or that they name their daughter "Renesmee" which is the weirdest name ever, or that Jacob, an adult werewolf, fell in love with this newborn! WHAT THE HELL???!!! Not to mention how sappy they are ALL the freaking time and their love was random and made no sense. Plus, this story has NO PLOT WHATSOEVER. 348 pgs of this book have no plot except "I love you Edward!" "I love you Bella!" After these pages, this so-called "plot" just turns into another vampire being obsessed with Bella for no reason other than the fact that she smells good.   Bella and Edward are also the MOST GENERIC characters ever written. Neither of them have ANY flaws! Bella's supposed "flaw" is that she is unbelievably clumsy to the point where she literally trips on flat concrete every 5 min, and, yet, somehow, everyone finds this incredibly endearing so it's not a flaw because everyone loves her for it! It is said constantly that she's not exceptionlly pretty, and, yet, all the guys in the school want to do her and Edward thinks shes the most beautiful thing ever. And don't even get me started on Edward! His only personality is "I love you bella!" He can do no wrong, his only flaw is that he gets jealous, and what generic teenage girl doesn't love that? He SUCKS. I hate him. It's annoying how generic he is. And every time he kisses her she FAINTS! Plus, everyone in the entire town is obsessed with her for no reason, and then Edwards family becomes obsessed with her for no reason and the werewolves become obsessed with her for no reason! She's not even likable!    Twilight is a generic romance novel seemingly written by a fifteen-year-old hormone-crazed girl desperate for a boyfriend. It's a bad fanfiction about vampires with no other plot other than "I love you, Edward! You're so god-like and sexy!" The writing is horrible and sappy. Look at these quotes: "Do I dazzle YOU?" "Frequently!"-"Friends don't let friends drive drunk." "Drunk?" "You're intoxicated by my very presence." "Well I can't argue with that!"- "Take care of my hear-I've left it with you."- "I'm getting closer to 19 every stinking day!"- "Holy crow!"   No one can possibly disagree that is a prime example of horrible writing.     Harry Potter has great characters, good plot and character development, it's funny, it actually has a plot, it was well-written, and it had many allusions to so many things throughout history and in mythology and other literature. JK obviously did her studying to write Harry Potter. There's nothing even remotely similar about them.    Twilight is an embarassment to fiction while Harry Potter created an entire fandom. Harry Potter was the cause of the Twilight fandom. Harry Potter started the midnight release parties, all the forums for books, the fangirls, everything. You twilight fans owe Harry Potter everything!|`|swxiulwtaa	To Anothergirl: Everyone prefers romance over action? Yeah cause every male prefers The Notebook over Die Hard.

Ugh it's so ridiculous, I thought this was pleasure,not obsessing.|`|ZtzKsVjdaa	Anotherguy, I guess I'm nobody because I HATE romance.  If what you're saying is true, Twilight should be more popular than Harry Potter and I wouldn't even call any of what happens in Twilight action.  Heck, I wouldn't call it romance either.  I don't particularly find controlling stalkers romantic.

ddbe0d06b594f10f2f7630118dff98a7aa	If you're graded on difficulty of the poem, the Dickinson poem is a little tougher. For the first half of the Emerson poem, it is stating opposites, which is easy both to understand and to memorize. I think the Dickinson poem is both more difficult to comprehend poetically and also to memorize. Hope that helps. good luck|`|rsg0zBT6aa	Of those I choose number two.  Of my own suggestion I would say "No Doctors Today, Thank You" by Ogden Nash.  Here it is:<br>  <br>  They tell me that euphoria is the feeling of feeling wonderful,<br>  well, today I feel euphorian,<br>  Today I have the agility of a Greek god and the appetitite of a<br>  Victorian.<br>  Yes, today I may even go forth without my galoshes,<br>  Today I am a swashbuckler, would anybody like me to buckle<br>  any swashes?<br>  This is my euphorian day,<br>  I will ring welkins and before anybody answers I will run away.<br>  I will tame me a caribou<br>  And bedeck it with marabou.<br>  I will pen me my memoirs.<br>  Ah youth, youth! What euphorian days them was!<br>  I wasn't much of a hand for the boudoirs,<br>  I was generally to be found where the food was.<br>  Does anybody want any flotsam?<br>  I've gotsam.<br>  Does anybody want any jetsam?<br>  I can getsam.<br>  I can play chopsticks on the Wurlitzer,<br>  I can speak Portuguese like a Berlitzer.<br>  I can don or doff my shoes without tying or untying the laces because<br>  I am wearing moccasins,<br>  And I practically know the difference between serums and antitoccasins.<br>  Kind people, don't think me purse-proud, don't set me down as<br>  vainglorious,<br>  I'm just a little euphorious. <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  P.S.

But that in no way shape or form is like spelling.      Also in the spirit of fairness, not only did he upset religious folks, but the people who actually know about the topic.    And to be fair again, only one of your four so-called "Twilight Haters" actually was one.  And I'm positive what she meant about "being as bad as the Twilight questions was the yes or no nature of the question and the horrendous overuse of chatspeak.      Also the words brainless and ditzy were never used.    If you want information, please, take the time to use full words, and make your sentences grammatically correct.  Rather than a direct criticism of you, the two who assaulted you rather than the book read like they were fed up with the chatspeak ridden questions that riddle this board, and you caught the brunt of their fury.     Ironic because this is a board about literature.    But I digress.  If I'm reading the posts correctly, rather than insulting you, two of them assaulted the book (which, again, was massively inaccurate), and two attempted to point out the flaws with your post, in an admittedly brusque manner.|`|s3HK7Mv1aa	I'm sorry about them.    :(    There will always be rude people on the internet.|`|QlB3VXWraa	Don't take it personal.

There is chaos everywhere, even in formely prosperous mid-America. Gangs and fierce armies of children begin to form almost immediately.

UeRBQBa9aa	This test on Bikini atoll, Marshall Islands: Feb. 28th, 1954, and code named "Castle Bravo", created the worst nuclear disaster yet known on Earth.  "On February 28, 1954, the U.S. detonated its first deliverable thermonuclear weapon (which used isotopes of lithium as its fusion fuel), known as the "Shrimp" device of the "Castle Bravo" test, at Bikini Atoll, Marshall Islands. The device yielded 15 megatons of energy, over twice its expected yield, and became the worst radiological disaster in U.S. history. The combination of the unexpectedly large blast and poor weather conditions caused a cloud of radioactive nuclear fallout to contaminate over 7,000 square miles, including Marshall Island natives and the crew of a Japanese fishing boat, as a snow-like mist. The contaminated islands were evacuated (and are still uninhabitable), but the natives received enough of a radioactive dose that they suffered far elevated levels of cancer and birth defects in the years to come.[citation needed]    The crew of the Japanese fishing boat, Fifth Lucky Dragon, returned to port suffering from radiation sickness and skin burns. Their cargo, many tons of contaminated fish, managed to enter into the market before the cause of their illness was determined. When a crew member died from the sickness and the full results of the contamination were made public by the U.S., Japanese concerns were reignited about the hazards of radiation and resulted in a boycott on eating fish (a main staple of the island country) for some weeks.[citation needed]".

Annie Dillard (for thinking & her beautiful way of writing).May Trees.    Belva Plain. Carousel, Crossroads.    Barbara Taylor Bradford. (English settings).

A Woman of Substance was either the first or one of the first in this series. Check the page before the title page to get a complete listing.

gWX21Jtwaa	Agrarianism is a social and political philosophy which stresses the viewpoint that the cultivation of plants, or farming leads to a fuller and happier life.    Or    The Farmers' Alliance was an organized agrarian economic movement amongst U.S. farmers that flourished in the 1880s. First formed in 1876 in Lampasas, Texas, the Alliance was designed to promote higher commodity prices through collective action by groups of individual farmers.
BjBkO0CSaa	Hmm, so just to clarify, the 1st wave was in the mid-1800s and composed mainly of Irish (escaping the potato famine) and Germans (coming to America for better opportunity.)  The 2nd wave went on from the late 1800s into the early 1900s and composed of people from Eastern and Southern Europe & Asia.      So similarities: a lot of the people coming to America were poor [the Germans were middle-classed] but other than that, the Irish were escaping the potato famine with very little savings and the Eastern/Southern European and immigrants were coming because they wanted a better life in America - also, in general, it was pretty difficult to get into America; Ellis Island (east - European immigrants) and Angel Island (west - Asian immigrants) are notorious for having meticulous restrictions for who could come in and who could not, and it was terrible coming all the way to America only to be sent back :(    also, throughout American history, there has always been negative sentiments towards immigrants; part of it is because they were willing to work for cheaper labor, another part was their differences [different language, different customs / traditions, etc] while we embrace this today (America, the melting pot) back then people thought "if you're coming to America, you should speak English and celebrate July 4th!"  Germans were also criticized for their "clannishness" apparently they settled in their own neighborhoods with their own kind, and Americans saw this as close-minded and clannish     differences: LOCATION - the first wave was mainly from Western Europe, most of these people spoke English, and were able to assimilate (blend in) with Americans; the second wave had very different languages and did not know English; the Italians and Chinese were the two groups of people who did not come to America to settle permanently, but to make some $ and go back ; also, the treatment of immigrants was not always equal > during the first wave, the Irish were highly discriminated against (NINA = "no Irish need apply" > signs on a lot of windows; * the Irish/Chinese are famous for having provided the labor for building the transcontinental railroad, which was very dangerous!)  while the 2nd wave immigrants had it tougher than the 1st wave (because they were more different to the Americans) one could say in general, the Asians had it the worst ] while European immigrants could at least get by with their looks (they're all WHITE!) the Asian immigrants were clearly different, and prejudice was a factor from the beginning.    oh and the second wave also had one extra difficulty ] since the poor were multiplying (and most immigrants were poor) it's generalized that immigrants made a large part of the slums [lots of them lived in big cities and did cheap labor jobs @ factories]     All in all, life as an immigrant was TOUGH! hope that gives you an idea of what our ancestors had to endure in order to give their kids [and future generations] a better life filled with opportunity - aka the American Dream.      So I've summarized a lot of the info, you can go into more detail if you want [Google search can help you there,] but hopefully all the info above helps you.  Good luck!|`|8cXAf7lCaa	Off the top of my head:     The first wave consisted of mostly Irish, German immigrants. Or, rather, mostly Western Europeans.    The second wave consisted of Italians, Slavs, Hungarians, etc. Or, mostly Eastern European.

I mean, reading Jake's version in Breaking Dawn, cracked me up because his language and sense of humour and thoughts are so modern and funny, but sometimes he can come across as selfish and bitter.

Lovely Bones- Uber depressing|`|osDGbTncaa	i have read almost every single one of those, and they are amazing. totally worth it!!|`|M627my7Baa	The Lovely Bones was amazing! Kind of depressing, yes, but it's written from the viewpoint of a murdered 14 yr old girl. She's looking down on her family &coming to terms w/ her own death. Very unique perspective!     Freedom Writer's Diary is supposed to be a good read also.|`|JZCbAR4Yaa	I've read The Host. It's a bit long and it takes a few chapters to get into the story but I enjoyed it. It's about aliens coming to earth and taking over the planet. With a bit of romance thrown in.  It takes a lot of pages to say what could have been said in a lot less pages but it's enjoyable and it's not very taxing to read. By that I mean that it's very uncomplicated reading. No long words and the story is very easy to follow. After you get past the first few chapters when I had no idea what was happening.|`|fMf6CgGWaa	The Host and Uglies are awesome books they are full of adventure and all this other stuff they rock go to www.bn.com (barnes and noble) and you can read there what they are like. The Host is fantastic I loved it so much the beginnig was ok but once you get into the middle it is like Whats going to Happen Next!? I want to keep reading! here is a brief description on the Host:  The Host: Hosts are being used in humans that are near death. When a girl named Melanie almost kills herself a soul named Wanderer(Wanda) is her soul. These souls go to different planets and have different lifes every time. When Wander and Melanie want to find her family and friends. They run into trouble. Wander falls in love with one person while Melanie is still in love with the man she had not seen in a while. Melanie should not be talking to Wanderer. If the Healers found out they would have to put a different soul in Melanies body. This a book with every kind of emotion and feel.|`|bM9Y79wHaa	Mmmmm, I've read The Host, it's good, but Twilight is better... Alota people say the Uglies series are good.
1ZeNgdUaaa	I would probably say Gilgamesh.  He was an ancient Sumerian king, mostly mythological but is probably based on an real person.  The Epic of Gilgamesh is considered to be one of, if not the first ever book ever written.  Sargon The Great from Akkad would also be a strong candidate.  He was also in some of the earliest days of Mesopotamia.|`|gWX21Jtwaa	The ancient Egyptians chose to begin their official history with a king named "Meni" (or Menes in Greek) about 4000BCE|`|UeRBQBa9aa	There is no actual answer to your question, as it is too general.  Although the ancient Egyptians had 'champions' or 'hero figures' that were actual men and women, most are believed to have been semi-deified into 'gods' or deities during some period of time during the 5000 yrs. of actual Egyptian history. [Menes is now believed to have been a warlord/king named Aha or Khasekhemwy. 'Menes' is the much later Greek name given to this early leader of Upper Egypt, who is thought to have been one of the kings of Upper Egypt to unite both Upper and Lower Egypt....The actual tomb of the "Scorpion King" has been discovered near Abdju [Abydos]. He, also was a warlord/king.  Other 'hero/champions' have all been legend or contained in myths as far as ancient history.  You would really have to have some idea of which era of history you wish to apply.  isis1037@yahoo.com

E3U4JtpFaa	I was (too) in honors English and when this Shakespeare unit rolled around, I was quite nervous too...    But honestly, it was okay. Romeo and Juliet was way easy to understand because I already knew the back story- as you probably do too. Don't worry about it so much, take notes after each scene, and if more help is needed, try cliffnotes or something. But you shouldn't need that. If you finished the first semester with a 4.0, you'll have no trouble understanding Shakespeare.    Try rewriting the parts you don't understand in prose. And if there's something you're really stuck on, honors English teachers are very, very smart.    Good luck!|`|58d4c5f78f3d1c66eddbabe45ac7e097aa	I love Shakespeare. Especially Romeo and Juliet. But they do speak Old English like "anon" and "thou" and "art" and stuff.    Make sure you get a book where the context is on the right and vocab and translations are on the left. that's really helpful. :)|`|M627my7Baa	It's natural to not know what the heck Shakespeare is talking about, they had a really strange way of speaking back in the 1500s!     But remember, these are the classics for a reason: the man was good! I'm sure you've heard of Cliff's Notes? I bet you could find something like that online. And don't worry. . .if you just manage to eke thru the class & forget everything you learned, you're not the only one. Maybe when you get older you can sit down and read him, slowly, for fun.|`|3zSYBeTFaa	Try to go to a play.  They're plays not books and should be seen.      Also, Why it's always R&J I don't get--it's my least favorite.  Cliff notes help (do they still make cliff notes?)  It gets easier as you practice.      Also, if you think it's talking about sex or making a joke--it is.      It took me the longest time to figure that out.  I thought if they are going to ban books like "Tom Sawyer" they surely wouldn't allow books that talk about sex.  (I was a freshman in the 80s and the first class in our schools history that had a sex ed class).  Remember the world doesn't run by logic.|`|1a0cdf84b10327b2e35d799092f75617aa	no shakespeare was really easy for me to understand. my class read that last year too and our whole class got it lol. but we had the most amazing teacher who explained everything if we had trouble lol
cxDbdhELaa	You must engage yourself into the philosophical project.  You do this by studying philosophy in an historical framework, by studying the philosophies espoused by the greatest philosophers in history.|`|nyk6l3c5aa	I seem to always make my way back around to nihilism every time I look too hard for meaning in anything. I guess the trick is to not care if there is a meaning to anything.|`|ce9pMwKMaa	sometimes all you can do is wait it out - acknowledge it - step back and see/look/feel your feelings and let time run its course.    i am guessing you feel trapped about something - maybe you feel physically limited maybe you feel physiologically limited - but the word "trapped means you are feeling caged or caught in something.    that something can then reach out to every level of your life until it passes or you talk it out - think it out - wait it out.|`|FF9mMlgKaa	well I think anyone who is looking for a meaning and finds a lack of one distressing, they see no point in living because they don't have anything in their life to keep them going. I'm having an experience like that right now and I realize that if I had something worthwhile that I was doing with my life a lack of meaning wouldn't bother me, it's like with a piece of art "what's the point?" but you don't care if you actually like the picture.

Often times when feeling overwhelmed I will step out in nature and combine the views with some fresh air. I know that sounds cheesy but it sometimes helps to know that we are somewhat minute creatures in this magnificent existence. Maybe you could find a good book to read, or a friend to talk with. I hope something good comes to you.|`|tcRpXd7Vaa	Create value.    Find the poetic balance in your life.|`|Uz7xLUAIaa	Let me try to answer your question of how I found meaning... I was a sophmore in college and had no idea what I should major in. I was dating a girl who took advantage of my trust as well as my money. My family all lived four hours away and I was by myself constantly. I felt that there really was no meaning to anything I did, because I felt like I was stuck in a life that that cared little about what I wanted. However one day I was watching the news and saw the breaking news story of the man who went into an Amish school house in Pennsylvania and murdered nearly all of the girl students; execution style. At that moment I knew I was going to be a police officer. After that realization everything I did had meaning, because everything I did was for my goal of protecting society. What Im trying to say is that you need to find something that truly motivates you to wake up in the morning and pursue it as hard as possible. Depending on how old/economically stable you are you could also move/take an extended vacation. No one will know who you are and you are free to blaze a new trail, or return to your current life.|`|oK0frWxMaa	well if u look at life logically ther is no meaning we just exist here.all of our life we struggle to get on top and when we do then what ther is nothing left u just live and furfill ur mortal pleasures.Ive thought to myself the same thingthat everything we do is insignificent and ive found out that life is all about the struggle it makes u feel alive.The struggle to obtain whatever it is u want is an adventure a makes u feel alive.Once u have it u search for the next thing.So ther always must be a goal in life something u need to furfill.This gives meaning.U need more challenges or life will become dull thats my opinion.what u should do is do something that makes u happy take in some air and look at the  beauty of life and it never helps to keep ur feelings bottled up this will overwhelm u u need to express ur feelings and get rid of al of ur negative energy stay away from negative  people behavior and language take some time to smell the flowers that is also meaning that u have the privilage to see Gods beautiful art ......love your friend and everyones Angel|`|9R0wRAxbaa	Does your question have a meaning?    I think so, otherwise it could not be understood.    So, MEANING exists! In other way there is a purpose for everything.    Ask God to help you seek for the Truth.|`|552de7febc71eb51ff1ef430b6431237aa	The US Constitution states that all men are created equal.  In reality, I think this statement is not precisely accurate.  I have come to believe that all souls are created equal--no soul is better or worse than anyone else's.  If you are feeling trapped, it seems to me that you lack the confidence in yourself to know how important you are and how important your contribution is to the people around you.  If you're feeling anxious about your life and where you are going, don't fret.  Everything moves at its own pace.  If you could see the big picture, you would understand that you and the world are as they are.  However, our level of awareness and understanding prevents most people from seeing the big picture.  I would recommend collecting your thoughts.  Figure what your intended outcome should be and take whatever action is necessary to reach your goal.  Don't stress at straying from your intended goal, just take what life offers and be pleased with the knowledge that God loves you.|`|HrsPCzaBaa	Nihilist.

jA1nfMeyaa	People who pose this question and consider this a flaw in the story have not read all of Tolkien's books and don't understand the full scope of Middle-Earth's history and mythology.  Making fun of it only shows their ignorance as they're making fun of something they haven't fully researched and don't understand.<br>  <br>  I've answered this on YA already, so I'll just post what I've already written in explanation.<br>  <br>  They can't just fly up, because the eagles they were divine and sent from Valinor by Manwe to watch over Morgoth (the original badass of Middle-Earth). Like Gandalf, being of a divine nature they CANNOT take matters into their own hands and dictate the fate of the inhabitants of Middle-Earth. It is up to the people of Middle-Earth to decide upon their own fate. The Maiar can only aid and advise them, but they are forbidden from doing anything huge that would change the tide in their favor and dictate the fate of Middle-Earth.<br>  <br>  They can do things every once in a while, like saving Gandalf at Isengard, but going off to destroy the Ring is the responsibility of the people of Middle-Earth, not the "gods." Once the Ring was destroyed, then it was okay to go there to save Sam and Frodo.<br>  <br>  The Lord of the Rings doesn't go much into the history and mythology of Tolkien's world. This stuff is better explained in the Silmarillion and his other works.|`|lsKEbeacaa	Gollum had to play his critical role in the ring's destiny. <br>  <br>  If Frodo & Sam had flown to Mordor and destroyed the ring without much resistance, what would be the point of the book? The greatest of actions requires the greatest of sacrifices. Frodo gave his life in a real sense for the sake of others. For in the end, Frodo, Gandalf, Bilbo, and several others departed the shores of Middle Earth forever and passed on to the Blessed Realm aboard that Elven ship.<br>  <br>  <br>  ***P.S. Your avatar name suggests you are a Beatles aficionado. If that's the case, You da man. I Am The Walrus is one of my favorite songs too. Do you know what "cool" chant the choir is singing in the background towards the end of the song??? I found out long ago....|`|Z1go9fvRaa	Notice in the video that they're blindfolded, so it probably had something to do with some sacred "law of the birds" not to venture into Mordor, which is why Gandalf had them blindfolded. In the third movie they picked up Frodo and Sam at the end, but that was probably because Sauron was dead by then. Tolkien probably had some kind of weird reason for them not going in there; either that or those blasted eagles are just REALLY hard to find.|`|v1D9zsC5aa	beaatss me babee :)|`|BLMh0dG6aa	That's the big question,<br>  <br>  The answer is they could have, but you could also go backstage and watch the magician practice al, his tricks, the fun is that he holds your attention enough so that it doesn't matter to you while reading it|`|gvzqPk2Gaa	the mordor dragon riders would kill them quicker<br>  they wanted to be safe

No other story shows the devolution of an individual with such striking clarity.  And the ending is superb.  "The Murders of Rue Morgue" is an excellent detective mystery.  For comedy - yes Poe has some - the try "Hop Frog" or my fave, "Three Sundays in a Week".  For utter creepiness and suspense, "The Fall of the House of Usher" or "Pit and the Pendulum" are great examples.  If I had to vote for one all time favorite, the "The Black Cat" is mine.
31N7XIohaa	The popular theory is around 20 million, Some say as high as 100 million (which I think is a bit high). Together with the lost of lives in WW2 and Hitler (Around 20 - 27 Mil). Russia would have lost close to 40 - 50 Million people. If the 100 million toll is believed together with the lost of life in WW2, Then their will be no one left in Russia. (May be 15 million at most). <br>  <br>  You will find that the most used theory would be at around 20 million. <br>  <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joseph_Stalin" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joseph_Stal...</a><br>  <a href="http://www.spartacus.schoolnet.co.uk/RUSstalin.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.spartacus.schoolnet.co.uk/RUS...</a><br>  <br>  <br>  But there is no argument, both Hitler and Stalin where Ruthless and Blood letting rulers of Nations, where the people of those nations were just to frighten to do anything it.

Or any one who just tries to stand up against them. <br>  <br>  The best way to know or fined out about these times, is to chat to some one whom had lived under these times. (From 1930's right up to 1950's) Weather they were in Germany, Russia (USSR) or Eastern Europe. You will fine that there will some that will talk about it. <br>  <br>  [Survivors can provide accounts of conditions at the time, but when it comes to an actual count of the death toll they are only able to repeat what others have said.

GMYNuFCDaa	Gas is much better if you don't need to use it in your house. Electric is really easy and stable to use, and if it's in the basement in the Winter it helps heat your house, so that's a bonus. I wouldn't recommend that with a gas kiln, in fact I think legally you need an outlet pipe up to code to do it, and more than just a fire place code too, because  it's so much hotter and actively releases exhaust.|`|mzRSO802aa	I personally like a gas kiln best.

Artemis Fowl- Possibly the best books series I've read, and from a great author too. They incorporate fantasy, life as we know it, seriousness, and humor all in one book. Lots and lots of comic relief! Plenty of action too, but in a sci-fi/ fantasy way.I think the first is the best, followed by the next too. Six books so far, all well over one hundred pages. By Eoin Colfer, but all of his stuff is good! I actually picked it up after strugging through most of Twilight, and couldn't put it down! In fact, I never got to the ending, I had read it while I was reading the first half of the book!    Also, The Thief, by Megan Whalen Turner, which I have yet to finish, is simply awesome. Two other books follow it that I'm eager to read.    I am the Messenger, by Markus Zusak, I've been reading, and it's great too. Very funny. His other book, The Book Thief, is also supposed to be good, but very very sad. I'm too sensitive, so I haven't read it.

AHuBqplbaa	Just start telling the story and introduce characters as they come into play, and show things about them through the story,  rather than telling in a boring information dump, and stick to things that matter to the story.    So we would meet the first character, who is narrating, right away, hopefully dealing with in an interesting situation that grabs the reader. The rest of the characters will come as he/she meets up with them, and the view of the new characters, when the story is in first person, will come from what the main character sees and how he/she interprets them, which not necessarily exactly how it is.

amcqJkWhaa	Life is a tragic comedy.     All things could be looked on as insufferable, despairing, but you could also look at it with humor, when you can... Angle of perception.     It's the kinda thing where, in retrospect, you can look at yourself like a fool, who thought he was enduring the worst. Maybe you were. You made lots of mistakes, or so you tell yourself. Then, in this retrospect, you can laugh at how silly you've been, because you realize something very grand...    Romeo and Juliet can be looked on as a tragic comedy. At the end, the two lovers both kill themselves, by misperception each time... (at least for Romeo) It's kinda funny how they miss each other by SECONDs, but then that is also part of the tragedy. heh.     Any myths, and fantasy, and fairytale, though they are treated with ridicule, and themselves employ clowns as their characters, for their own devices, they really have more to do with real life then books using the naturalistic or realistic style...   "It is a fool's prerogative to utter truths that no one else will speak" ~ The Sandman, by Neil Gaiman  I think it's a good quote, because truth when spoken, may always sound like folly... Someone who says truths, in their most naked statements, well, maybe they're ridiculed most of the time...   Anyway, with myths, and fantasy, and fairytale, although sometimes it may have a comedic air, it is tragic that, at least in some part, they are treated as trash and not looked to further. Because they really have something to offer...|`|swxiulwtaa	watch the movie "Burn after Reading" that might help|`|D343SIeDaa	It should have a simple background in the beginning and towards the end the scene takes a turn for the worse but it instills humor.

The girl replied, "I just want you out of my life"  She laughs at her boyfriend but then she was shocked at his reply.  "Ok baby, if that's what you really want, thanks for everything, I will shoot myself than see you with another guy. I love you baby, bye."  Then the girl tried to reply as fast as she could thinking she could save her boyfriend and tell him she's just joking, but when she sent her message...    Check operator...

sc4BtGxGaa	I taught HS and MS music from 197 to 2008, am a professional classical musician, ad a competition judge in NY state.  No matter how innately talented you might be, you are WAAAAAAY too under-prepared to take a college audition in about a year.  No matter how intensely you might work withe the *finest* of teachers,  you cannot possibly assimilate all the knowledge and *physical* technique skills in this short period of time, if you wish to be accepted into any decent college or conservatory program.  Sure, there are really low-level colleges that will take anybody - there is one up the road from me - but the education you receive at a place like that prepares you for NOTHING, expect years of struggling to pay back college loans.    You may keep this interest for a long time, and continue to study and  improve.  Perhaps you will accompany singers, play in a church, or do some community performances.  But for me, a life-long professional and mentor to my young colleagues, to advise you to seriously consider pursuing this as a collegiate major, and then career - well, that would be deceitful on my part.    People have asked this before, and I have given them a similar sincere answer,  Sadly, some of them did not want to HEAR the truth - they took as Best Answer the one from an uneducated, inexperienced student who would say "You go girl!  You can be anything you want!"  That sentiment might be nice - we are free to PURSUE anything we wish - the reality is that we must be adequately educated and trained if we intend to be a success.  You are not at that stage yet, - and cannot realistically achieve this in one year.  Please think about this, and choose your college path accordingly.  Good luck|`|Aurhesleaa	Of course you can!    First thing first; find another teacher or talk to your school's music department head. Devote as much energy to it as you can.    Next year, apply to music schools as well as other colleges. That way you have a back up plan.    Good luck!

It has a deeper and richer sound than the violin. It is slightly bigger than a violin, and has the ability to play some lower notes. This is due to the bigger size, and the thicker strings used.<br>  <br>  Wikipedia says:<br>  <br>  The casual observer may mistake the viola for the violin because of their similarity in size, closeness in pitch range (the viola is a perfect fifth below the violin), and nearly identical playing position. However, the viola's timbre sets it apart: its rich, dark-toned sonority is more full-bodied than the violin's. The viola's mellow voice being frequently used for playing inner harmonies, it does not enjoy the wide solo repertoire or fame of the violin.

Write, for example, 'The night is starry   and the stars are blue and shiver in the distance.'     The night wind revolves in the sky and sings.     Tonight I can write the saddest lines.   I loved her, and sometimes she loved me too.     Through nights like this one I held her in my arms.   I kissed her again and again under the endless sky.     She loved me, sometimes I loved her too.   How could one not have loved her great still eyes.     Tonight I can write the saddest lines.   To think that I do not have her. To feel that I have lost her.     To hear the immense night, still more immense without her.   And the verse falls to the soul like dew to the pasture.     What does it matter that my love could not keep her.   The night is starry and she is not with me.     This is all. In the distance someone is singing. In the distance.   My soul is not satisfied that it has lost her.     My sight tries to find her as though to bring her closer.   My heart looks for her, and she is not with me.     The same night whitening the same trees.   We, of that time, are no longer the same.     I no longer love her, that's certain, but how I loved her.   My voice tries to find the wind to touch her hearing.     Another's. She will be another's. As she was before my kisses.   Her voice, her bright body. Her infinite eyes.     I no longer love her, that's certain, but maybe I love her.   Love is so short, forgetting is so long.     Because through nights like this one I held her in my arms   my soul is not satisfied that it has lost her.     Though this be the last pain that she makes me suffer   and these the last verses that I write for her.|`|X5afTqKiaa	Once there was a man who loved a woman soooo much so they got married buttttt she cheated and he jumed off a bridge happy now ur soooooo emo!!!|`|CC7G2eGGaa	Read the Outsiders...Or page 637 of the 7th Harry Potter book.|`|fwCxjxlcaa	A WALK TO REMEMBER BY NICHOLAS SPARKS!!!

qdlmy4l8aa	Ask someone with familial dysautonomia.     We'd certainly be dead much sooner. Pain enables us to figure out when things aren't working right. We feel pain. We go to the doctor. We get medicine. We live. (sometimes)     If not for it, we wouldn't be able to tell when we were ill, or had inconspicuous injuries that need attending to. I would not say brave, but disadvantageous.|`|1XRHUCvtaa	There wouldn't be any consciousness to the life on Earth.

As far as feeling no physical pain, I agree with an answers posted before mine. Shorter life expectancy.

1404d9070bb3e8dbdfa989926c402b0eaa	"Hey, Al" by Arthur Yorinks  http://www.amazon.com/Hey-Al-Arthur-Yori...  "The plot of this book, for 4-year-olds and up, involves the travails of Al, a janitor who lives in a dingy apartment on Manhattan's West Side with his dog Eddie. One day, a funny-looking bird sticks its huge head through Al's bathroom window and proposes a journey to a terrific place where there are "no worries" and "no cares." Al agrees and takes Eddie with him. What the two experience is paradise--butterflies, wildflowers, chirping birds and cool streams--but it soon gives way to the uncertainties of being away from home, and a moral: that home is where the heart is. This sharp, wry and tender story, which won the 1987 Caldecott Medal, marks Yorinks' and Egielski's fourth highly praised collaborative work."

1l69CCScaa	This answer appears to reflect Cicero's early form of duty-base utilitarianism.  It was his view, if I remember correctly, that all citizens have a duty to their state and society.  This specific quotation means that at any given time we have a duty we may or may not act upon depending on our character.  To relate it to a book I'd say it's like everyday life taken to the moral extreme.  At any given time you can/should be helping your neighbor shovel snow from the walk, or helping to make dinner for your family, attending a public protest, teaching your child to read, or somehow improving yourself.  This is an encompassing philosophy that rules all action all the time.  That said, it gives no moral holidays.  There is no time when we can just sit back and relax because there is always something else we should be doing.      For further reading I'd suggest looking into Utilitarianism.  First founded by John Stewart Mill, it has become one of the prevalent theories in modern ethics and politics.|`|AA11564934	oh so it's for a NEWSPAPER, not HOMEWORK  at all.

Cicero sounds like a realistic person. When you think about it, the very nature of our existence is supported and maintained by duty. Gravity for example is always forcing us down, therefore it is a form of duty to coexist with this natural condition by constantly exerting our muscles just to do something as simple as sitting up in a chair or breathing. No matter what were always working to some extent.|`|zZY3JX30aa	It means whatever you choose for it to mean to/for yourself on a personal level.    It's all relative.

Make sure when you're describing him too what colour his eyes are; does he get a lot of sleep?  If not, don't forget to mention the dark circles beneath them and also, is he an insider or outsider - i.e.: Does he spend most of his time in or out of the sun?  This will give you an idea of the pigment of his skin.  Is his hair greasy or dry?  Does he style it, or let it flow naturally?    As a writer, you need to be able to think about all the tiny pieces in order to put the full picture together - but be certain not to mention it all at once.  If he's depressed; use metaphors to describe his inner feelings.  If he's shy, then give examples throughout the story as to how he deals with different individuals.    The most important thing you need to remember in writing is to SHOW, don't TELL.    I have a Diploma of Arts in Creative Writing; and am an avid writer myself, so I hope this answer has helped you.

ceBTTCPwaa	To Kill a Mockingbird is a Pulitzer Prize-winning novel by Harper Lee published in 1960. It was instantly successful and has become a classic of modern American fiction. The novel is loosely based on the author's observations of her family and neighbors, as well as on an event that occurred near her hometown in 1936, when she was 10 years old.    The novel is renowned for its warmth and humor, despite dealing with serious issues of rape and racial inequality. The narrator's father, Atticus Finch, has served as a moral hero for many readers and as a model of integrity for lawyers. One critic explained the novel's impact by writing, "In the twentieth century, To Kill a Mockingbird is probably the most widely read book dealing with race in America, and its protagonist, Atticus Finch, the most enduring fictional image of racial heroism."

ceBTTCPwaa	Albert Camus (7 November 1913  4 January 1960) was an Algeria-born French author, philosopher, and journalist who won the Nobel prize in 1957. He is often associated with existentialism, but Camus refused this label. On the other hand, as he wrote in his essay The Rebel, his whole life was devoted to opposing the philosophy of nihilism while still delving deeply into individual freedom.    http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Albert_Camu...    http://www.the-ledge.com/flash/ledge.php...    http://www.thenation.com/doc.mhtml?i=200...    http://www.camus-society.com/|`|xJoMSkI5aa	If you thought religion in The Fall was confusing, look at what Camus had to say: "I do not believe in God and I am not an atheist."

JZCbAR4Yaa	I love Persuasion the most. It's just very romantic and for me, it seemed like the most realistic. It's cliched, it's just like an older version of Nicholas Spark's The Notebook, but it's so well written.|`|BGU3VpQFaa	Persuasion is my favorite, but I wouldn't recommend reading it first.  I see it as being kind of the more mature version of Pride and Prejudice, being about an older couple and on their second chance rather than first impressions.  Reading Pride and Prejudice isn't cliche.  It is really the best introduction to Austen in my mind.    Minus P&P, here's a good order to read them in:  Mansfield Park (a cinderella like tale)  Sense and Sensibility  Northanger Abbey (a little different with gothic elements)  Emma (also a good one to start with!)    Persuasion|`|mLAUkQLDaa	Pride and Prejudice is a great book, but the next best is Sense and Sensibility.     Have fun reading!|`|uZTzird4aa	sorry, i only read pride and prejudice...it was good..cliche?...yeah ok|`|C5QV222iaa	idk but i am getting ready to read some jane austen,  maybe i'll read them all then i'll tell you which is the best|`|amcqJkWhaa	Heh. They're all great.   But, your use of 'cliche' to describe the act of reading Pride and Prejudice, astonishes me... I was going to say, that is my fondest book I have read, by Jane Austen, if not the whole gamut...     Pride and Prejudice, is my favorite, so being what you asked for, I suggest you read that first. However, as you are not I, your opinion will differ for it. Big shock!   When I first read P&P, I had to have a dictionary close at hand, because I hadn't read classic books like so before, with the old English and the vocabulary that is not dumbed down... Also I think I was in middle school.   I am now-- older, and have read more books, and Pride and Prejudice, I have read now 3 times. It's not the least bit hard to read anymore... I was pleasantly surprised when I got the book last Christmas..     But, of them all, Pride and Prejudice I remember most of all, then comes Emma-- that is a sweet book. I'm sure the others were good too, but I haven't come across them in a while, I think I might want to read Sense and Sensibility in short time.|`|sRGESDz1aa	pride and prejudice is definitly the best.  it would not be cliche at all to read that.  its a good book you should read that one.
JZCbAR4Yaa	Lately all the bookstores I visit have are just books that they want to sell, and they aren't usually what I would call good books. And anything I do want to read they never have it.

I was disappointed.

They are cheaper too.      Trade-a-Book stores are the best because they attract serious readers.  Also if the books are on the shelf horizontially (so the titles are easy to read and the shelves hold more books) instead of vertically--that's a great sign!    good luck!

BjBkO0CSaa	Well, for one thing, Jerusalem is the "holy land' of not one, not two, but THREE major religions.  So "fighting it out" is out of the question - that's not to say that violence does not occur in the holy land, but it is a place of worship.  I think people, no matter what religion, see Jerusalem as a holy place where violence is unjustified.      Peace - ANYWHERE - is vital.  The violence going on in Africa needs to be stopped, and I don't know why it continues to go unwatched.  But the world tries to maintain peace in all Holy places, and that's just a general respect to religion.  And as to fighting it out, what good will that do?  It's not going to solve anything and people will just unnecessarily die, so...    Hope that answers your question.|`|Z0BNqCVAaa	The answer is complex:    1. There is a strong base of Jewish support in America. Supporters of Israel hold a significant number of positions of influence in our society. Enough so that we remain a powerful supporter in terms of helping keep Israel's enemies at bay.   2. Christians, Muslims, Jews and a variety of pagan races have been fighting over that piece of ground for 5000 years. It is considered a holy city by all of the first three on that list. Christians, Muslims and Eastern Orthodox religions keep a significant presence there to this day. Those three added together probably constitutes at least half of the worlds religious inhabitants. So there is a built-in interest in Israel worldwide.  3. Israel is the only country in that region with nuclear weapons. Considering the millenia of bad blood between the Jews and Muslims, one has to believe that were the Muslims to do something to truly threaten Israel as a nation, they would not hesitate to use one. Or two.  And that would cause utter chaos in that part of the world, and significant problems for the rest of the world. So, we pay attention. We must.|`|AA11304025	That's just what the jewish land thieves would like because they have the best weapons from the USA.

Just pay attention to what's going on over there from time to time and you will understand everything that Jesus talked about concerning this.    The word Jeru means "City" and Salem means "Peace"    When you put them together you get Jerusalem which means "City of Peace"

ceBTTCPwaa	Adventures of Huckleberry Finn (often shortened to Huck Finn) is a novel written by Mark Twain and published in 1884. It is commonly regarded one of the Great American Novels, and is one of the first major American novels written in the vernacular, characterized by local color regionalism. It is told in the first person by Huckleberry "Huck" Finn, best friend of Tom Sawyer and narrator of two other Twain novels.    The book is noted for its colorful description of people and places along the Mississippi River. By satirizing a Southern antebellum society that was already anachronistic at the time of its publication, the book is an often scathing look at entrenched attitudes, particularly racism. The drifting journey of Huck and his friend Jim, a runaway slave, down the Mississippi River on their raft may be one of the most enduring images of escape and freedom in all of American literature.    http://www.bookrags.com/Adventures_of_Hu...    http://www.bookrags.com/notes/hf/    http://www.sparknotes.com/lit/huckfinn/    http://www.cliffsnotes.com/WileyCDA/LitN...    http://www.novelguide.com/huckleberryfin...    http://www.pinkmonkey.com/booknotes/monk...    http://www.gradesaver.com/ClassicNotes/T...    http://www.pinkmonkey.com/booknotes/barr...    http://www.bookwolf.com/Free_Booknotes/H...    http://summarycentral.tripod.com/theadve...|`|xJoMSkI5aa	For Jim, the river will take him to freedom in the legal sense.

sjMIFH9Faa	Annulment and divorce what quite common, not 50% like it is today, but still quite common. <br>  <br>  An annulment was a declaration that the marriage is invalid. This may come from a variety of reasons. Maybe someone was pressured into the marriage, that person can talk to a panel of clergymen and if they decide that the person was pressured into the marriage, the clergymen would rule that the marriage never took place to begin with. <br>  <br>  The the famous renaissance example, Henry VIII. He claimed that because Katherine of Aragon was previously his brother's wife, his marriage should be annulled. Under most circumstances an annulment would be granted. However, Katherine was the aunt of the Holy Roman Emperor and he pressured the Pope not to grant the annulment. His troops actually invaded Rome. <br>  <br>  Now divorce was different. A divorce is a personal and legal separation between man and wife after the two made an oath before God that they would be together "till death do they part." You were allowed to get divorced, but the Church wouldn't recognize it and they wouldn't allow you to get remarried.<br>  <br>  So in the Middle Ages it was stupid to get a divorce because having legitimate children is pretty much essential, so if you wanted to split from your spouse you had to come up with a reason why the marriage shouldn't count in the first place. But they were granted quite often, we just have one notable exception.|`|kZT828wJaa	You could not divorce in the middle ages in Europe as the Catholic Church held power over many of the governments of the day and was integrated into the life of all of the peoples. If you tried to divorce your wife, you would be 'ex-communicated' which means you would be separated from 'the lord' and condemned to damnation by order of the church, which in Christian ideology of the time meant a one way trip to hell essentially. A notably exception was Henry VIII of England who was prevented from divorcing his wife by the Catholic Church, so he abolished it and created the "Church of England" which shared the same rituals and idea's as the Catholic Church, except the King is in charge instead of the pope, and divorce was allowed. However, if you happened not to be the ruler of one of Europe's major powers, this wasn't really an option, so you were out of luck.|`|wkNYSCi1aa	Most people in the Middle Ages (in Europe) were Catholic and Catholicism does not allow divorce so divorce was probably not so common in the Middle Ages.|`|8747ad5946dec06c50e2f01268404c87aa	They didn't have divorces.<br>  They did have accidental be-headings though...|`|AA12095483	Prior to Henry Vlll (who was the last of the medieval monarchs) there was no such thing as divorce. A marriage could be dissolved by annulment - that is, the marriage was not legal in the first place, or it could end when one of the partners died. But there were no legal divorces prior to Henry Vlll.

No math, not real predictions, just a bogus "second theory" to bolster his image. He thought quantum theory was nonsense EVEN WHEN EVIDENCE SUPPORTED IT. <br>  <br>  He was a lousy scientist and a lousy human being. Did he study psychology? Hell no.

Not only will it not sound good, cheap guitars (especially that Les Paul Special 2) will go out of tune extremely quickly (like before you even can finish one song) and your guitar will always be buzzing randomly because of poor factory quality made products. I would recommend at least bumping up your budget to a $300 guitar plus a $200 amp. In that case, I would recommend the Squier Classic 60's Vibe guitar and a Marshall MG 30 watt amp. If you absolutely cannot spend more than $300s, then I would recommend heading over to www.guitarfetish.com and buying an XV-500 or an XV-870 and also a Line 6 Spider III 15 watt amp.|`|3xHuLeiTaa	The Les Paul pack will give you a harder,fatter sound.If you're into heavier stuff like Led Zeppelin,Aerosmith,Lynyrd Skynyrd,get the Epiphone.If you're into the Beatles and more mellow stuff get the Squire.Take a look at what the guitarists in you favorite bands play.But for classic rock I'd recommend the Les Paul.|`|34XCm07vaa	theres nothing more classic than a les paul, mijo. when im not playing with my mariachi, i rockit with my les paul to hendrix and van halen.|`|6Z4zv8XZaa	get a gutiar, not the starter pack. for 300 dollars you can get a WAY better gutiar.<br>  <br>  Shop around.

You can see the same thing happening in China and India today, countries who have taken over the manufacturing of many of the products and services that we consume today.<br>  <br>  The full employment caused by the industrial revolution also caused hundreds and thousands of jobs in supporting industries as well as shopkeepers and merchants.  The lesson to be learned from these revolutions is that, unless you have a thriving middle class, you are either already or will become a third world country.

In order for any decisions to be made, most, if not all landowning Athenian citizens were required to meet and decide. In a meeting with so many people, it was hard for people to reach a conclusion. In addition, which increasing population, this system became increasingly hard to maintain.

Their units served for only a few weeks or months at a time, were reluctant to go very far from home  -------------------------------     During the American Revolution many  Combatants  were from the Militia  American armies and militias<br>  At the outset of the war, the Thirteen Colonies lacked a professional army and navy. Each colony provided for its own defenses through the use of local militia. Militiamen were lightly armed, slightly trained, and usually did not have uniforms. Their units served for only a few weeks or months at a time, were reluctant to go very far from home, and were thus generally unavailable for extended operations. Militia lacked the training and discipline of regular soldiers but were more numerous and could overwhelm regular troops as at the battles of Concord, Bennington and Saratoga, and the siege of Boston. Both sides used partisan warfare but the Americans were particularly effective at suppressing Loyalist activity when British regulars were not in the area.[2]http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ame...|`|9okusH1kaa	For the militia it is. The militia were able to go home if they wanted to and because it was cheaper, they often went home for the winter and returned when it was battle season again.

YXGdwwTJaa	It is hard without any actual details to give a full answer.<br>  <br>   Would the tribal member be of  the same people as the mummy was?  Ethics vary, being fairly subjective.  What were/are the beliefs concerned?.  Some peoples insist that the body must be whole to go to heaven or to be reborn; other cultures think that the body is a discarded shell, like a butterfly's cocoon. <br>  <br>   Many Egyptian mummies were taken from Egypt to museums and private collections where they were variously used in medication, pulled apart in the interest of curiosity or scientific study, or displayed in cases.  Did this treatment help the mummy to achieve eternal life or did it just get immortality in being viewed or written about? <br>  <br>  It does not seem right to sell a mummy, but then this may be he best source of much needed finances. Usually bodies are found by scientific excavation and used only to find out about the past, which, to me, seems like the past helping the future it did not see. However we canot decide on whether or not it is right to sell a long dead body.  We are in societies that favour organ transplant, which sometimes happens with money changing hands, buying parts of a living person's body,which seems far less ethical than getting het up over those long dead.

Eventually his bloodthirstiness was exposed and he was executed himself... via the guillotine.|`|b6c4080f75661c90f953bca01c3033feaa	On a basic level, economic meltdown. Ultimatly that is what set off the French Revolution, it was the spark that lit the fire.    France was a country in debt, having debts dating back about 200 years, to the times of Louis XIV (the Sun King) and his wars. It was this financial crises in 1789 that eventually led to the French Revolution.

This change was caused by the technological advancements (machine guns being introduced caused trenches to be necessary).|`|0fc3402838faf715903c6caf2d179a64aa	Well....

You can make a case that the Allies (Mostly French) bitterness and viciousness to get a pound of flesh from Germany is what lead to WW2 25 years later.    But basically your question needs to be answered by entire text books.|`|jD4cBvNCaa	Well to me the biggest effect of ww1 was the fact that, our government started the income tax , even though it was known to be unconstitutional, because they lied to the public, and said it was only for the war effort, and that when the war was over they would remove it. the rest is history, once the government gets their hands in our pockets, they never will take them out,short of a mighty move of the people they are stealing from . the other effect was it lead to WW2 because Germany was forced into a bad situation, that they didn't totally cause but the agreement between France, England, & Germany was so bad for Germany it made it easy for Hitler to spread his lies, and false promises on a already seriously hurting people, .A war that probably shouldn't of involved Americans, since the war was going to stop in Europe, just before we came into the picture, because we were lied to also, the first world war would not have happened, had some people had not promised the English, they could assure them of our help, before WW1 we had always been more pro Germany than pro English, because after all we one our independence from England not Germany
B2EfflTzaa	You can say that in todays society people are trying to conserve the typical family. (mother,father,sons and daughters) Its different from the society in Brave New World because no one had parents.     Try relating it to your own family at some point in your essay. It will make it more personal.     You could also try an example like match.com. People today strive for a partner and to them it is something special. Unlike in Brave New World where monogamy is looked down upon and people have sex with a different person every night,     I can't think of anymore reasons. sorry. Hope that helps.|`|87c3ab205244a705347516d3762ec3f0aa	Brave New World is one of my favorite books of all time. really!  but thats a hard one! its odd because marriage/relationships are seeing a general trend of ending through instances like infidelity, lies, etc. all of these are associated with coldheartedness or not really being that emotionally attached to our partners. in Brave New World, if you remember, women were borderline prostitutes at night, in my opinion, and for goodness sake, wore a belt that kept their contraceptive devices at hand!  in this case, it seems as though relations and sex isnt cherished, and in my opinion, isnt that important to some/most people today, i mean youve seen many instances of people sleeping around just to get some, right?    however, there is an aspect you can examine. when the "savage (john)" kills himself, this can be seen as a rejecting of this society that Brave New World centers itself around. he desperately desires Lenina Crowne, correct? remember that one chapter where he sees her lying down sleeping and wants nothing more than to see a woman he truly desires like the other men she's been with have seen her, but he chooses not to?  between his suicide and controling his desire, John the savage plays a major role in describing the zeitgiest and humanity in general. i really think that Mr. Huxley included this character and his demise to WARN us from adapting into this "Brave New World." I also find it ironic that Bernard's last name is "Marx," the father of communism, a social experiment and way of life that has failed repeatedly.    its odd though that you HAVE to say no to our society moving towards this type of world because of love, marriage, etc. because of things like scientific advances such as parents being able to PICK the sex of a child, relationships being based on the physical rather than love, etc.  but i think your strongest arguement is through John the savage being a warning to society against this type of world, and encouraging us to seek love and individuality, or else our society turns into the monster of artificial life and "encouraged" death seen in Brave New World.    however, there are instances of people seeking out true partners though dating and courting, marriage for LOVE, and monogamy, but if you remember, monogamy was scornful in this novel, but isnt quite so in reality!    also, if you remember, people were manufactured, but in reality, we are concieved out of a mother and father, in most instances hopefully to create a family. we have our own set of parents in one way or another, not created by science.     i always relate my writing to a personal level as well, because it makes you look more "in touch" rather than just analyzing a book because you have to. it looks great when you make connections!    ill add more if i think of anything else, good luck! english is my best subject so email me if you need help!
