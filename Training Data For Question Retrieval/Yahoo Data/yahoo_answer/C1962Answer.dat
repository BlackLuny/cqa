54rpE896aa	with the 1st controler press home and hit connect controlers then on the other controllers hit 1 & 2 simitanusley.
pMMVhQnZaa	well the creator mention of a new zelda game at work title, Zelda ;axis of shadow or darkness,well anyway,he never gave info on it release date or it story line.Only that it will use the same graphic engine as twlight princess,but more improved.and that was basically it.<br>  <br>  But for release date that a hard one,it usally take up to 3-4 years just to make zelda game like ocarina of time and twlight princess,my best guess is somewhat in 2009 or early 2010,but i know it will be worth the wait =)|`|8x3e7Gmjaa	i heard about it too! they had talked about it, but gave away NO info on the games story, but did say there will be some major difference in the gameplay? guess we're gunna have to wait and see :) wish it would have been out for christmas though, twlight princess was a beautifully done game, there were things i would have changed though, i would have it more closely tied with ocarina of time, i think they hit the nail on the head with that game.... damn i love the zelda series, i been playin it since i was born! ;)|`|422293cc42b708b9eaf49bc63da90705aa	A new Zelda game has not been announced. |`|adJiKFHqaa	As far as I knew there wasn't one confirmed yet?|`|YvD0ZS6Baa	new 1 coming out, can't wait!

C8mFdBygaa	Its sad but thats the case with A LOT of online games. BC nintendo doesn't take care of their servers for online play.

d0745208e8d9260952c0f551139d1d27aa	yeah the pawn shop is a bad idea.  wait tell closer to christmas and then sell on ebay.  they already said they are going to probally have a shortage on the wii with the wii fit.  so people will probally at least buy it for what it is worth plus shipping if not more.  a pawn shop will probally give at most half of what they will sell it for.  usually they do a third though. a game stop or game crazy place if you have one is even better then a pawn shop.  those are places that sell games for all systems.  they useally buy used systems.  as long as it works.  again pawn shops useally rip you off.  you could probally go on craigslist as well for your area and find a person willing to buy it for what its worth or a little less.  especially if it works.  and if you have games and remotes sell it for about how much it all is.  minus a little bit.  if all the games and wii and all are brand new and would cost 300 dollars then sell it for 250 to 275 being that they are all used.  good luck and hope you get a good deal for it.|`|da497b496d860db69805aee850404dcdaa	Craigslist it.|`|zFbPgNAMaa	You'll get a lot more money selling it on ebay, especially with Christmas coming up.|`|436c94fc0fa9c48d429644e694c2b4a9aa	i would buy it if there is nothing wrong with it and if ul give me a good deal|`|AgIMqbc1aa	Not interested....if it was a ps3 It'd be a different story.....|`|hkdCUjInaa	no that is dumb to a pawn shop go on ebay|`|1usIOzzwaa	pawn shop is for people in need of quick money and ebay is for people who want to make lots of money of a stupid thing a suggest you find a random buyer|`|FCWsP06Aaa	i would compare Your prices of selling it at a game stop, on ebay, or yeah a pawn shop|`|NzBvkHlxaa	NO.

5S6s2sFraa	You can find lots on eBay, but be careful buying highly sensitive mechanical equipment from there. You really have to know what you're looking for. I saw a camera on there recently which someone pointed out for pure trivial speculation that was being advertised as one thing where it was actually a combination of more than one camera, and thus rendered non-functional!

You don't see as much promotion for other mp3 players. It's been known as the "cool" mp3 player and people like them.<br>  <br>  Another large factor is the popularity of iTunes.<br>  <br>  The iPod seems to be the mp3 player of choice to many celebrities as well which makes many other want the product.<br>  <br>  I personally like the new nano, I just recieved it. I've had other mp3 players, but I do like the look of the iPod the best. I am an avid Apple user so I may be a little biased.|`|K6JnyBJ1aa	It's all in marketing!<br>  <br>  When you buy an overpriced, mediocre-quality iPod, you're buying the label, the name, and the status. Much like all the 12 year old girls running around in Abercrombie and Fitch clothing, you're paying solely for the fact of having something that looks somewhat pretty, is very user-friendly but not versatile, and that has a reputation. Many people choose to buy such items because they're costly - having something expensive makes them feel like they're buying the highest quality label, when really, the company is cashing in on it by using foreign labor and low-quality parts.<br>  <br>  In fact, these companies will intentionally make poor-quality goods that will break just outside of warranty, forcing the consumer to buy a new item or pay them for repairs. This is a scam. For example, a few months ago, the complaints to Apple soared because the warranty of the first batches of of the video iPods had just ended, and all the headphones began breaking. It wasn't coincidence - Apple had made poor quality headphones, and subsequenty, everyone with an iPod had to buy new ones for upwards of $25 each.<br>  <br>  So, in a nutshell, you can buy into something with a reputation for quite a bit of money if it makes you feel better about yourself, but don't expect a high-quality item from a big name brand.

XcF4L6KMaa	Altell in the past never let their customers use pic messaging on their Blackberrys. But they do now. And I would have to say for me at least it is definitely worth every penny. Email is the best for any phone out there, and it is very reliable. I am on my 3rd berry right now, and will never own another phone type. But it depends on what your gonna do with it. Some people have no use for internet browsing, email, and calendar features, but I live off of mine, and I would be lost without it.|`|AA11431779	It does in fact have that feature.  I am an Alltel Wireless rep, and the only blackberry that doesn't have that ability out of the box is the 8130 Pearl which it is able to after you go through the downloads and software updates through either the blackberry website or the software.alltel.com website.  The curve is most definitely worth the money, I have had customers come in and tell me that they love the phone, I have had people compare both the pearl and the curve and the curve almost always wins due to the size of the screen and the larger qwerty keyboard.  Many of the features are the same, and I the owner of a 8130 pearl regret not buying the 8330 for those reasons

It is normal to see a very faint picture of what you had on the screen for a few minutes with a plasma tv but it will go away. Technology has improved and it is a lot harder to get burn in, your xbox being played for a few hours a day will not hurt it.

XcF4L6KMaa	It shouldn't be an extra amount for text. The data package you pay for covers this, Im positive of this. The Iphone does not have a more stable operating system as you imply. And the final killer, the Iphone will not send or receive pic messages. Blackberry has an app store coming next month, so the app thing will cancel its self out shortly. Jailbreaking your phone will not help it if your staying with AT&T, so don't waste you time or money. You will void the phone, and Apple wont touch it. Also, another thing I hate about the Iphone, is that you cant even change the battery in it. You have to send it back to get serviced. I have friends with the Apple, and I have owned 3 Blackberry's. I would have to say, the Blackberry is a way better phone and a few of my apple buddies are waiting for their contracts to end so they can get them also. Yes I agree with you on the tethering. Don't do it, its a waste. you will chew up 5gb in no time, leaving you with a big bill. I asked about the reason that they charge extra, because I already have unlimited internet on my phone, and they gave a an answer that made completely no sense what so ever. They jack the price up to what a standard air card would run you. Dont get hung up on the novelty of the touch screen. I have a Storm, and I can tell you first hand, swiping your finger across the screen gets old real fast. Once the wow factor of your friends ogling over it wears off, youll realize that the trackball on the Berry is alot easier and so much faster to use in the long run. Thats the only thing I miss going from the Curve to the Storm is the trackball, lol.

BZumpQkaaa	First things first, is there any where you can charge it? Most ipod issues are fixable. Here's a link to try a few things<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.everymac.com/systems/apple/consumer_electronics/ipod_faq/ipod-troubleshooting-wont-turn-on-appear-hung-sad.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.everymac.com/systems/apple/co...</a><br>  <br>  My friend owns a phone shop and they replace and repair ipods all the time, it's not an expensive job if it comes to that.
3a63b7259eaf399b366677517089238faa	Not true at all. Your iPod can be used with up to five different iTunes accounts. The _only_ time this could happen is if your iPod is Mac formatted (you used it on a Mac the first time) and you plug it into a Windows PC. The iPod will not work in this case without doing an iPod restore using the software from Apple because Windows does not recognize the Mac filesystem.<br>  <br>  It does work in reverse however, using a Windows formatted iPod on a Mac without restoring the iPod and erasing all the music works just fine.<br>  <br>  Also, keep in mind that the iPod restore procedure does require you to click a few confirmation dialog boxes, so there's no way to inadvertently erase your iPod.<br>  <br>  Personally, I use my iPod with my HP Notebook PC, my Mac Mini, and I plug it into my girlfriend's PC when she has songs that I want to copy. I also plug it into my PC at work when I need to charge it, but that one doesn't have iTunes installed since it's a corporate PC. It does make a handy charger however.|`|8a8381b69bfc33f55f9aa21e88782195aa	no?
b753de26a72af7483d4fed646644300eaa	no. newer phones can do that but not the 5200. when you say "on" do u mean the back light or the actual lcd?

AA11054456	there is no way that apple wopuld like you to do it.  there are programs that you can download that make it easier but if you dont know much about computers this way isnt the right way for you <br>  <br>  Option 1:<br>  Assuming you're moving files legally between your own computers, check out iPodAgent at <a href="http://www.ipodsoft.com/" rel="nofollow">http://www.ipodsoft.com/</a><br>  ________________________________<br>  Option 2:<br>  The manual way around this problem is to use the iPod in its alter ego - that of portable computer disk drive. Successfully tested under iTunes for Windows 4.2, 4.5, 4.6, 4.7; Windows XP Home.<br>  <br>  - Start with the iPod disconnected from the computer - DON'T CONNECT IPOD YET<br>  - open iTunes<br>  - open iTunes Preferences - this blocks iTunes from seeing an iPod connection; leave the preferences window up and running<br>  - connect the iPod to the computer, wait about 15 seconds before continuing<br>  - open 'My Computer'<br>  - Tools menu, Folder Options, View tab, enable 'show hidden files /folders'<br>  - open iPod icon in My Computer<br>  - open iPod_Control folder<br>  - you should see a folder named Music<br>  - drag this folder to somewhere on your computer hard drive<br>  - after the copy completes, right-click the new Music folder on your hard drive and select 'Properties'<br>  - clear the checkmark next to 'Hidden'<br>  - Close that explorer window<br>  - eject iPod from System tray "Safely Remove Hardware" icon. This icon looks like a small gray rectangle with a green arrow floating above it. It's only there when a removable device (like the iPod in this case) is attached to the computer. Right-click & select 'Safely remove..', then click 'Stop' in the next window, OK in the next window, and then Close to complete the ejection.<br>  - disconnect the iPod from the computer<br>  <br>  - go back to iTunes, cancel the preferences window<br>  - File menu \ Add folder to Library \ find that Music folder copied over from the iPod<br>  <br>  Your iTunes library should be back in action! But wait - there's more!!<br>  <br>  Long time forum regular Otto42 has a java script/program that can also retrieve the playlists themselves from the iPod as well. Here are his instructions and a link to the most recent thread discussing this tricky process:<br>  <br>  ] This is really useful when you're pulling all the songs off of an iPod to put them back into iTunes, because you lost your library or anything along those lines. Come up with your own reason for using it.<br>  <br>  ] Download this program:<br>  <a href="http://otto.homedns.org:8888/iTunes/iPodGetXML.zip" rel="nofollow">http://otto.homedns.org:8888/iTunes/iPod...</a> <br>  (If you can't download it, try again later. The connection goes up and down a lot.)<br>  <br>  ] Now, put the iPod into Disk Mode or otherwise access the iPod as a drive. Make sure you can see hidden files, then go to the drive and the iPod_Control folder and find the iTunesDB file. Copy it to your PC.<br>  <br>  ] Put the copied iTunesDB file in the same directory as this program, then run the program. It'll read the iTunesDB, get all the playlists, and create an XML file for each one. Now just import those XML files into iTunes to recreate the playlists.<br>  <br>  ] Notes:<br>  - The songs in playlist must already be in the iTunes library. If any one of them isn't there, iTunes throws up an error when you try to import the XML file.<br>  - The song names, artist names, and album names in the library all must be identical as to what the iPod has. If you just copied all the music off the iPod and into iTunes, this will be the case, so it's generally not a big deal. but you'll get an error if it can't find the song in the iTunes library, so it's something to keep in mind.<br>  - It probably won't be able to cope with unusual characters in song names. Sorry, not worth my time to fix. Dealing with unicode is way annoying.<br>  - Smart Playlists get changed into regular playlists. It's *possible* for me to add the smart playlist stuff in there, but it'll take a while to work it all out.<br>  <br>  <br>  it takes a littl ewhile but i have done that to al my new computers and it has worked with no problem...make sure you follow the instructions word by word something little could cause you a problem|`|AA11124594	Try the instructions in this CNET article: "How to get songs off of your Windows iPod."

bdb8ccbce9fb1f7a2f372bc9e3bf7e40aa	Maybe now there may be a new model of a video ipod. But,if you buy this now, later on means like after a few weeks you may see another brand new model with more features than the one which you have. So, I insist you to wait on for 2 or 3 weeks and wait for a new model with excellent features to buy.<br>  <br>  Thank You|`|ivunDmlraa	buy it right now|`|ayiuPe7waa	One person said you should wait two or three weeks. Frankly, if you want a video ipod, get one, as there's no telling what will happen. You have three basic scenarios:<br>  1. Get a video iPod. After this, a new one will come out. No matter what. If it comes out a day after, it really isn't any different than if it comes out a year later.<br>  <br>  2. Wait two or three weeks. Either a new one will come out, you'll buy it, and then ANOTHER new one will come out, and same story. Or, a new one won't come out, and you'll have just wasted time.<br>  <br>  3. Wait as long as it takes for a new iPod to come out. After you buy this one, a new one will come out.<br>  <br>  And it goes on...without an announcement, there's no sense in waiting. And if you buy one, and the next day, a new one arrives, think about this: the new one will be replaced, too.

381e3207230460fe8521d523304a91a6aa	The 360 can achieve 1080p using the component cables, but it's very unlikely that there will be any 360 games in 1080p because the DVD-9 doesn't hold a lot of info, as compared to the Blu-ray and HD-DVD.  Companies will most likely have to make multiple disks if they want their games to be in 1080p.  Since it's going to be expensive to make 1080p games, companies will make a smaller profit if they decide to go with multiple disks.  So you can see why most companies will not make 360 1080p games.  Plus, not too many people have 1080p HD TV, so even if companies make it, most gamers aren't going to take advantage of it.<br>  <br>  There probably will not be any HDMI output on the 360 unless MS decides to redesign the 360 and add the HDMI feature in the redesigned 360.
AA11416397	I guess that that is your only other option although if you think about it you will pay $200 more for a PS3, so I believe that it is a worthy investment to put in $100 for a Wireless Adapter.  Either that or get a 50 foot ethernet cable.  <br>  <br>  I just got live fro my XBOX 360 also, so I had the same dilemma, but my XBOX was right next to my router so it was easier.

iNY1YVaPaa	I've used this camera before, it takes good pictures, it only needs a little brightness and contrast adjustments sometimes, but if you really want good pictures and you have a little more money go for a DSLR, there are some cheap one's out there, you could use them in full auto mode, in other words you only have to zoom in or out and take the picture and the camera will do the rest, or you could use your creativity and handle it manually, it's fun!

CQA4HAdmaa	I do notice the difference, but don't think it's worth the money and don't think I'll ever buy one.  I'm OK with the standard|`|AbRfd29Haa	I have a Blu-Ray player, a 71" DLP HDTV, and a digital amp with 7+1 speaker surround sound. <br>  <br>  Blu-Ray is definitely worth it... I really don't buy DVDs anymore if the Blu-Ray is available. The price difference isn't much for 6x the quality. Of course, it makes more difference on some films than others, and there are poorly transferred BDs just like there are poorly transferred DVDs. Some material has a ton of detail, and the Blu-Ray is just day vs. night over the DVD (a few of these include "The Dark Knight", "Barraka", "The 5th Element", "Apocolypto", "Wall-E", "Blade Runner", "2001", "Iron Man", and "Planet Earth"). <br>  <br>  In technical terms, anything shot on 35mm or better (70mm, iMax) or on 2K or 4K digital is greatly improved on Blu-Ray. So right off, if you're into independent films shot on DV, there's no measurable improvement. Naturally, if they don't spend the effort to properly transfer and master a film, the difference may not be important. And nature or action films tend to have large, detailed scenes, they often benefit more than tightly shot human dramas (the improvement is identical, but your eye doesn't care as much). <br>  <br>  Of course, if you don't have the gear to take advantage of Blu-Ray, it would not be worth the price... today. But will you upgrade at some point?
j5Apt8hWaa	You have two choices.  1) forget the technology and do it the old fashioned way, taking control of your camera and adjust the shutter speed to reflect the -1, 0 and +1 exposure or 2) call the Canon help line 800.OK-CANON and have them help you.|`|vkzkXWfzaa	I think its because your in Manual Mode (don't quote me as I don't use Canon).<br>  <br>  Normally Manual Mode overrides any other settings try Av (Aperture Priority) instead. Then it will alter exposure by changing the shutter speed, which is usually what you want as then you will have the same depth of field in all the shots.<br>  <br>  Chris|`|AA10912074	If you are using your timer and have AEB on, it will take three pictures - bing bing bing - when you press the shutter once.  <br>  <br>  If you are in any other mode, including manual, you need to press the shutter release three times if you are in single shot mode, or press and hold the shutter down if you are in continuous mode.  <br>  <br>  You mentioned you tried it in continuous mode (where you have hold down the button until all three pictures have been taken) - does it take three pictures at the same exposure?  Or are you letting your figure off the button before three pictures are taken?  <br>  <br>  In single shot mode, after you press it once, you should see a green dot in the view finder, reminding you that you still have an AEB picture to take. <br>  <br>  Hope that helps!|`|pZGLhV2Waa	Auto exposure bracketing does not work in manual mode. As Fhotoace said you have to do it the old fashion way. Read the lightmeter in the viewfinder and just set your exposure for one over, one normal and one under. Or you can use one of the other modes.|`|6489dd6288438d0ac1d6bd81b79f0d8daa	I think that you should download the Firmware Update that's available from Canon.com (click on firmware.html).<br>  <br>  here is what the Update fixes...<br>  1.Fixes a phenomenon in which AEB (Auto Exposure Bracketing) shooting does not operate normally under specific conditions.<br>  2.Fixes a phenomenon in which the Live View exposure simulation warning indication does not properly display during Live View shooting.<br>  3.Fixes a phenomenon in which images cannot be played back after continuous shooting when a printer is connected to the camera or a video output terminal is used.<br>  <br>  <br>  p.s. I also have the 450D (XSi). AEB works fine...you should shoot in continuous shooting mode, not Single Shot mode because in single shot mode the camera only takes one shot. And, don't forget that you can<br>  <br>  However, I think I might need the firmware update, because the freakiest thing just happened when I was playing with the exposure compensation.  I managed to dial in -3 and the minimum setting is meant to be -2!!! <br>  Turning the camera off, then on, put it back to normal (?).<br>  And then, I tried it again and the scale went as far as -4 on one end and +4, the other. Is there something that Canon is hiding from us?

LddkW0JFaa	Most computers with DVD drives can play regular DVDs. The only exception would be really old computers (like ten years old or more).

Older players might not be able to do any of the formats.<br>  <br>  Should be no issue on a pc.
Cl8FwsI2aa	I don't understand why people answer this question if they haven't played on both Xbox LIVE and the PSN. To answer this question, one must have had an experience playing on both.<br>  <br>  I own both video game consoles. I used to play Halo 2 on Xbox LIVE on my sixth-generation Xbox and it was amazing. The ranking system, the ease of playing against another team in matchmaking and the magnificent features it offers. Xbox LIVE is one of the chief reasons I purchased the Xbox 360. Microsoft doesn't disappoint, Xbox LIVE is the undisputed champion. The PlayStation Network pales in comparison. It's featureless and laggy. I'd rather shell out cash on a superb online gaming experience (Xbox LIVE) as opposed to getting a free, featureless and laggy online gaming experience (PSN). The reason why the PSN is free is simply because it isn't good and I'm being generous. Sony need to improve this area significantly. Also, Xbox LIVE has Netflix streaming, another slick advantage. Xbox LIVE is a reason, alone, to purchase the Xbox 360.<br>  <br>  To conclude, Xbox LIVE is incomparable to PSN. While a honourable mention should go to the PSN, it just doesn't come close to the highly polished Xbox LIVE.<br>  <br>  Good luck.|`|Hiasgb75aa	Xbox LIVE is better but PSN is free.<br>  <br>  There isn't much wrong with PSN, but LIVE does have more features. Unlike most people here I have browsed through both so trust me. I'm a PSN guy because I know my parents wont spill the cash yearly just to let me play online, so that makes PSN more worth it in the end, but if you have the money to spend LIVE is worth it and it has Netflix to download movies and you can view all the games your friends have played (a feature which I'd like to see on PSN)|`|qtlzdtMVaa	I have both. Xbox....*BARF*! Ps3 *hurray*!<br>  <br>  Xbox:~<br>  -Breaks constantly<br>  -Pay monthly online<br>  -Looks ugly<br>  -Graphics are alright<br>  -Crap games (only decent game is Gears Of War - the only reason I got it)<br>  <br>  Ps3:~<br>  -Very reliable<br>  -Free online<br>  -Looks...I have no words...it's just beautiful...<br>  -Graphics are outstanding!<br>  -Best games everrrr (Call of Duty, Resistance, Fall Out, Metal Gear Solid, Tomb Raider, Killzone 2 to come etc...)<br>  <br>  The xbox is nothing compared to the ps3, it's just NO match. PS3 is worth every single last penny...=D<br>  <br>  Hey! You get more twats on the xbox you noobs. Yes I do admit there are lots of young idiots on the ps3 but there are also decent people as well, like meeee!!! haha!<br>  <br>  Add me if you wish lol, It's 'NoodleGirl' Please say in the message who you are and where you added me from, cause I will just decline otherwise and I don't make friends with idiots, so watch it!|`|1WgOj89kaa	Playstation Network is completely free with no subscription or anything, along with getting fantastic, free online play, you get playstation Home and Playstation Store for free as well. Simple PSN is better|`|QxtdyNvgaa	i dont care about online features but ps3 is better because i have one and i regularly play on my cousins xbox and its quite good but not better than ps3!|`|pl2SocVKaa	psn is free so that is why its better because they are basically the same thing|`|tyRNuhJkaa	Both have good points and bad points for example the psn is free xbox live isn't, on both you can add friends, download mods, games, demos,surf the internet,etc. i did here that that the xbox allows you to download movies now which currently the ps3 doesnt do on the other had i think the ps3s internet browser is more advance. however it just depends on which one your Friends are playing on or which one has the games you like the best, as both have exclusive games, for example halo and Resistance<br>  <br>  so at the end of the day both are equal in good and bad points.<br>  hope this helped|`|aEUAhBzBaa	xbox live is always better PSN offers great features personally i play my ps3 wayy more xbox live is cool but paying to play with my friends makes no sence to me wen i can play with the for free on playstation and theres millions of people online so is not like u wont have others to play with.<br>  <br>  xbox and ps3 is a matter of how many freinds own each system and what type of games you wanna play.|`|BYHmKxpdaa	We have both. Most of our friends have Xbox 360s because they are more affordable. You also have to consider the game selection. 360 does have more games available. A 13 month subscription for Live is 49.99, but it has been on sale lately for 29.99. There are a lot of kids on BOTH networks if you ask me, lol.|`|8L0gj33Vaa	well I didn't know playing xbox live was free but what I do know is that xbox live is a better experience in gaming as it has developed years onto it's service while sony is quite new on the online service and yes playstation network is totally free at least that's what I've heard...|`|FKP9rHIHaa	PSN is much better than XBL because yes PSN is free also it has lots of other features like music, game trailers, photo albums, playstation store and playstation home. Not played an Xbox in a while so i dont know but i can guarantee you that PS3's are excellent.|`|WuHVJQzVaa	it doesnt matter... ps3s are so expensive that like no1 has them.. xbox has so many people on it and alot more games... xbox 4sure|`|EMhEVkYwaa	PLaystation 3 is awesome because it just is lol|`|SUEk4Uxvaa	psn is<br>  its free<br>  more people are online etc etc<br>  <br>  nothing to do with xbox live its ****|`|L3aCgcbxaa	PSN is free, everything free, everything should be free to everyone, and people should help eachother through the power of community...like Yahoo Answers. <br>  <br>  PSN fits into my freedom of gaming perspective.<br>  <br>  What is so good about Xbox live? nothing, thats what, concerning gaming, PSN can do the same things as Xbox live, the only thing different  is the downloadable games on offer.<br>  <br>  Get PSN, cos there R more players, contrary 2 the fact that there R more xbox 360s than PS3s, less than 30% of Xbox owners go online with their console, presumibly cos of the price...|`|7oyaNbfSaa	Yes, Playstation Network is free, but because of that, you have a lot more stupid people on there, and a bunch of young annoying kids. I have never regretted the money I pay for xbox live. I have played on both networks, and the xbox live network seems to be more stable, with fewer glitches, and it is managed much better.|`|JDOhH8TLaa	Definatly Xboxlive<br>  <br>  over 10x more content for games<br>  <br>  over 4x as many arcade games<br>  <br>  admittedly it costs but not as much as most people play for mmo's and they usually play more then 1 mmo at one time.<br>  <br>  Not to mention xboxlive has about 5x as many members then PSN so you'll get to play with a lot more people, Halo 3 usually has over 500,000 people playing it, and CoD WAW has similar numbers.|`|3SjdyNcKaa	Xbox live all the way <br>  <br>  ps3 is free yes but xbox is so much better and 5 quid a mouth isnt bad.
4O6RfAIHaa	Actually, yes. Some network providers charge per KILOBYTE for each message sent plus it would count as a text message if you were on a non unlimited plan. When you get your bill, check to see if it has any data charges for 1 kilobye here and 1 kilopbyte there and that will tell you that it caused a small internet connection/bandwidth to connect with the AIM server.|`|1kxqzyy9aa	it means nothing ,if you are on a different network than the receiver then you pay, or he/she pays if you are not on the same network as her/him|`|17e9c7e9b8c52f6480ee24e65f4d402eaa	nope <br>  <br>  but standard text messaging rates apply to the person receiving the text|`|E0LuEgigaa	you're fine. i text my girl all the time using AIM and she has unlimited texts.

c3b645N5aa	NOOOOOOOO!!!! More megapixels are not better for you. I've printed amazing 20x30s from a 6MP Nikon D40 BECAUSE it only has 6MP.<br>  The more megapixels you cram onto the camera the WORSE the quality gets (especially true with cheap point and shoots)<br>  <br>  Instead of looking for more megapixels, read reviews and determine which camera has the better picture quality.|`|cn0ALwwLaa	Generally, yes, more megapixels will help you achieve this.<br>  <br>  If a camera has 10 Megapixels (that is still a lot I use mine that is 4 for EBay and it looks great. The lens has to be good, because it is capturing something very detailed.<br>  <br>  A bad lens will blur, you need to worry about distortion.<br>  <br>  It comes down to how far away and how small the text is, Brands are below.<br>  <br>  Anything over 10MP with a brand like Nikon (the best) will work fine. Canon and Minolta are still very good.<br>  <br>  Hope this Helps!|`|GJ3Wdav2aa	you have more chances with 8mgp DSLR with telelens than with 14mgpx small camera (not talking about cameraphones) .<br>  if you tight on money, buy yourself used sony a100 from ebay with 18-75 and 70-300 lenses.<br>  and a flash. you'll be ready for anything.|`|mhQbtz1Yaa	Megapixels are basically the amount of pixels in your picture, and pixels are the tiny squares.<br>  <br>  If you have less pixels, the picture will be grainy and choppy. But if you have a lot of them, it will be very crisp.<br>  <br>  It does come down to the lense. I suggest any lense like Leica or Carl Zeiss. Canon uses Carl Zeiss, and I have the Canon Powershot SD790 IS. It's 10 megapixels, and honestly you probably wouldn't need more than that. <br>  <br>  Chances are you wont be able to take a picture of a note blowing in the wind with ANY camera, but you could try...<br>  <br>  Another factor you need to include is the shutter speed. The higher, the faster the pic will be taken, and that will reduce blur.<br>  <br>  good luck!

Devices that utilize HDMI usually have to conform to HDCP standards (not always but usually) the thing that is really gonna stop in you in your tracks though is that component is usually analog, HDMI is pure digital.  I have seen devices that serve this purpose to DVI which is a matchable standard with HDMI but they are usually not at your corner store because they start at about 700 dollars.

VJ1C5JsYaa	Currently there is no official notice that it will ever be free. Simply peoples wishful thinking. Currently Xbox Live is run by MS they run major servers for the larger games. Since they are running servers and considering the speed at which Xbox Live runs it is unlikely that it will ever be 100% free. Personally I hope it never becomes 100% free. If it does it means that MS will no longer run their servers to allow people to play wonderfully lag free games to the degree that we do. If you actually take the time to think about it from a real perspective then you would also think that it will not be free. Do you really want to play laggy games like on the wii or PS3 or like you can find on any internet based game? If you don't pay for the service then of course you can expect lag and lots of it. If you do pay for the service however you don't expect lag and its for that very reason that MS works so hard to give people lag free games.|`|1WgOj89kaa	It should be free, the PS3, along with being better, is free to join. So microsoft need to make Live free in order to stay in competition with the great Sony.|`|QaJGkXp2aa	No way to know since there's nothing official about it, but there's definitely some buzz in the industry about the possibility of this happening.

rTlWyR6eaa	That motherboard is a micro ATX, for building small computers.  Since you're planning on using a huge double-GPU card, you aren't building a small computer.  It will still be compatible, but it's kind of pointless when you can get a full ATX mobo with more features for the same price.  <br>  A Q9650 is good enough to play any game just fine.  I have a Q9300 OC'd to 2.7GHz and a GTX280 and I can play pretty much every game I've tried at the highest settings at 1920x1080 resolution.  Since you're planning on using components a step up from mine, they'll be just great for playing games.<br>  A couple of things to consider:<br>  <br>  A:  Make sure you have a powerful, high-quality power supply.  If you go cheap on a PSU you're inviting problems that could become very expensive.<br>  B:  Make sure you get a big enough case to fit that 4850X2.  They're pretty long, and a micro ATX case like one for that motherboard will not be big enough.

eVptHOOBaa	Only Rebel XSi has this function. XS, or 100D don't have live view. You'll have to stick to the viewfinder. Which in about 95% of the cases is a better choice than LCD anyway. <br>  <br>  LEM.<br>  <br>  P.S. Sorry, I confused XS with older XT :/<br>  I don't know much about XS, except that if you didn't accidentally flip AF lever on a lens, it should autofocus. It has two autofocus modes in live view - contrast detection, which works through the matrix, and is slow, so give it some time, or phase detection, which flips a mirror for a second (cutting your view) to autofocus, then brings live view back... Check your manual as to how you switch between those modes...

kKQ9Jp8haa	While you keep your computer in sleep mode, it does use power. If it is plugged in (either a laptop or a desktop, both do this), the charger that connects to the outlet retains an electrical charge and uses electricity. I'd say shutting down the PC is not only better in terms of electric use, but also better for the health of your PC. If you have it constantly running, while it might not be doing anything, it does keep it warm and processing some basic functions that generally shorten its lifespan. Shut it down. =)|`|DTlFaJkaaa	extended component life, I swear newer components are made cheap on purpose, so they'll burn out after a year rather than the usual 2 to 3...|`|I51RUYZraa	Sleep mode is an awesome concept, it allows you to keep the system state active in ram while shutting down all none essential devices such as the display device and hard drives.  The extra juice used to turn a computer on commonly referred to as surge current still exists, because the truly power hungry components such as the hard disks will be shut on when brought out of sleep the real advantage here is speed and power consumption, ram is easily 10 to 20 times faster then a hard disk in all ways so comming out of sleep is much faster, because ram has no moving parts and uses very little electricity when it isn't passing data this provides a notable improvement on battery life.  The down side here is that there has yet to be a single Windows based computer that uses it properly.  Seriously if I had to guess averages I would say it accounts for about 69 percent of all windows crashes (30% would be Nvidia's drivers and 1 percent being faulty hardware).|`|MDQrdno8aa	Lots of people say it's better for your PC to leave it in sleep mode with the power still on.  I had an engineer friend tell me the same thing.<br>  It does make sense from an electrical perspective.  The time when an electronic device is under the most stress is that short period of time when power is first applied.  Think about when you see a light bulb burn out.  It's almost always when you first turn it on.  On the other hand, I've never heard anyone say that their PC is dead because they turned it off too much.  Personal choice, I guess.|`|67H4k1lgaa	if you shut down your pc you save some energy but you will have to boot it up again if you want to use it.<br>  <br>  If you sleep it, your computer will 'sleep' and use up energy but not as much as running the pc.<br>  <br>  you should not sleep your pc if its a laptop... you loose power.|`|qMVOV9t4aa	Yeah shutting down lets it rest. Sleep mode still awake with power going to it. Hibernating it saves your current session, without having to boot windows.|`|6wPmEBLTaa	Its always good to do a complete shutdown. As software might require a shutdown. <br>  Personally i rarely shutdown my PC (Not even sleep mode) and it runs fine (Using Ubuntu 8.10 not windows)<br>  <br>  The main Advantage to doing a complete shutdown is good for if you pay electricity bills (Sleep mode uses a low power state) shutting it down every night will save you quite a bit on your electricity. otherwise there really isn't an advantage to using shutdown (Plus leaving it on you have instant access)|`|citgf07Waa	shutting down may help it go cooled because wen u keep it in sleep mode the PC uses Electricity and some times heats up the comp...........u may also keep it in hibernation mode rather keepin it in sleep mode|`|vkPgHVLdaa	It is more convenient to leave in sleep mode, but it may overheat and is safer to just shut it down.

Turn the system off via the switch on back and then hold the power button down and turn the system on via the switch in back.  Keep holding it down and the system fan will spin super fast to clean the system out and then the system will turn off.  Turn it off and on at the switch again and power up as usual.  This MAY help.

VJ1C5JsYaa	As it is not open knowledge anymore about the manufacturing cost of the first gen Xbox I could only guess at the price. When it first came out MS was not using a China based manufacturing plant so the cost was a little more then later they altered parts to also be able to cheapen the system. Considering that they state the current 360 at about a $715 manufacturing cost if you think that the old parts may have been a little cheaper or they may have had things that they didn't need in it adding to the cost I would put my guess ranging from around 500-800 per console. I put such a large area based on the fact that the system would have cost more at the start and then once they learned better manufacturing techniques they where able to cheapen it.|`|MaCVp5Xsaa	not as much as the 360 thats for sure and why arent you at school?

AQ4b4Iilaa	I can tell you exactly what you need for macro work.<br>  <br>  Sony A300 (with liveview) with a Tamron SP 90mm AF f2.8 Macro lens.  I have this auto-focus lens and it is absolutely amazing, it is a legendary 1:1 lens.  Switch it to manual and your macro shots will be pin sharp.  You can get the lens new or you can get it used off eBay.<br>  <br>  There is also the older Tamron SP 90mm f2.5 which is only manual focus, try to get the f2.8 version though so you aren't stuck in manual.<br>  <br>  Also the Sigma 105mm f2.8 Macro is a 1:1 lens, but the Tamron is better.<br>  <br>  These lenses also make nice portrait lenses.<br>  <br>  If you can not afford the Sony A300, then get the Sony A200.  They are identical, but the A300 has liveview which will be handy for macro and tripod work.  If you want more mpix, then get the A350.|`|TbTO5SXlaa	First, a DSLR does not have  "... inbuilt macro capabilities." With a DSLR you have to buy a macro lens for macro photography.<br>  <br>  Second, a DSLR does not have a "... good zoom range." Again, with a DSLR the zoom range is determined by the lens chosen. There are zoom lenses that are wide-angle zooms (12-24mm, 17-35mm), medium length zooms (18-55mm, 35-105mm) and longer zooms (70-200mm, 70-300mm) and even wide-angle to long focal length (18-200mm).<br>  <br>  One camera with Live View that actually works with the autofocus is the Sony A300. There are several advantages to the Sony live view. Suppose you're in a crowd and have to hold the camera over your head to get a picture. Just flip the screen down and you can compose, check focus and shoot. Its also a good feature if you're doing macro photography at ground level. Just flip the screen up and you can easily compose and shoot. If you'd like to take really candid pictures of people you can flip the screen up, let the camera hang from around your neck, discreetly look down, compose and shoot - and your subject will never know you took their picture. Of course it would be foolish to try to use a DSLR at arm's length like you would a compact digicam.<br>  <br>  The A300 also has Sony's version of Image Stabilization (IS) in the camera body. This simply means that any lens you use will become an IS lens. Nikon and Canon have their versions of IS in some models of their lenses - but not in all of them. Plus, with Nikon and Canon you get to pay for the IS every time you buy an IS lens.<br>  <br>  The A300 can use every Minolta Maxxum AF lens made since 1985 plus all of the after-market lenses that were made for the Maxxum A-mount. Just think: a 20+ year old Maxxum AF 70-210mm zoom will be an IS lens on the A300.<br>  <br>  If you'd like to see actual examples of how the in-camera IS benefits a wide-angle lens, go to <a href="http://www.shutterbug.com" rel="nofollow">http://www.shutterbug.com</a> and type 'maxxum 5d' in the Search box. The Maxxum 5D was tested in the Feb. 2006 issue of Shutterbug. In the test, there are 2 pictures of a yacht at anchor. A 24mm lens was used (36mm equivalent). One was with the IS "OFF" and one with it "ON". The large pictures look very similar. However, when a small section of a window on the yacht is enlarged the one taken with the IS "ON" is much sharper.<br>  <br>  You can also read a review of the A300 at the Shutterbug site.<br>  <br>  Good luck with your decision.|`|j5Apt8hWaa	At present, the most bang for the buck is the Nikon D40 with 18-55 mm lens ... Under $450 US or under ￡245<br>  <br>  There is a huge problem with live view .. actually more than one.<br>  <br>  1) attempting to use a 2 pound camera at arm's length is asking for camera movement which is the prime cause of image blur.<br>  2) live view is only usable if the camera is attached to a telescope or microscope ... and possibly  when mounted on a tripod and using it for studio photography to take shots of products.<br>  3) the least expensive cameras with live view, are just over $1,000 USD|`|TwIK4Ivlaa	Within your budget the best option would be to get a Nikon D40 with a kit lens. <br>  <br>  For macro you can start with +1, +2, +3, +10 Diopter lenses which are available as front mounted filters. With the 18-55mm kit lens, the size required will be for 52mm. Seeing by your earlier works on the link provided, I suggest that you save up for a good macro lens in future.|`|31420ed41c716cbb02addca8d450fc2eaa	fhotoace seems not to know much about cameras that don't say Nikon on them.  You can get live view with an Olympus E510 or E520 that works really well.  You will have to learn to adjust to one major thing and that is that focusing in live view on a DSLR is a tad slower.  That is mainly because what is going on inside of your camera.  <br>  <br>  Live Views most horrible problem is that it simply eats your batteries up, so use it sparingly.  <br>  <br>  My wife used my E510 in live view to shoot at a wedding reception and all of the pictures turned out really nice.  She DID NOT HAVE TO USE A TRIPOD OR A MONOPOD.  <br>  <br>  the cameras that I mentioned do have a macro setting, but that is best if you have a macro lens.  With the macro lens, you really do not need the macro setting, just focus and shoot.  I think that Olympus offers a 35mm and a 50mm Macro lenses.  <br>  <br>  You can get two lens kits with the Olympus models, one from 14-42mm and the other from 40-150.  They have incredible lenses which are made totally of glass, not plastic elements like Nikon and Canon.  <br>  <br>  As for using older lenses which are not made for digital, you can, but you will lose features tht the camera offers. Olympus is made so that the image stabilization is in the camera, not the lens, so if you have access to older Olympus lenses, you still have image stabilization, but you will not have auto focus.  <br>  <br>  There is a lot of garbage being tossed about on cameras that are not either Canon or Nikon.  Truth be known, both Sony units and Olympus units are some of the best.  <br>  <br>  The other "drawback" that Fhotoace often brings up is that the aspect ratio is 4:3 and not 3:2.  That is not a problem and I would think that since that great photographer must, on occasion, use medium format or large format, most of which do not come in 3:2 aspect ratio, he understands how to frame and to crop.  <br>  <br>  My cameras in medium format shoot 6x6, 6x7, and 645 formats, none of which are in 3:2 aspect ratio.  <br>  <br>  Investigate them all and pick the one that fits your pocketbook and your hands.<br>  <br>  a 35mm macro lens for an Olympus would be the same as a 70mm in 35mm format and the 50mm would be 100 in 35mm format.  14-42 would equate to 28 - 84, and the 40-150 would equate to 80-300mm on a 35mm format.  <br>  <br>  Aftermarket lenses for the Olympus models are made by Sigma and you can use Leica lenses that are made for Leica and Panasonic units.|`|xG5ZlJDqaa	There are limitation you should acknowledge on a dslr before purchasing:<br>  - They are big, bulky, and heavy. Forget about "discrete" public shooting<br>  - Buying a dslr is almost never a one time purchase. You are most likely going to spend more on accessories and lenses than the body itself<br>  - Even though a dslr has the added bonus of being able to switch lenses to match the task at hand, keep in mind that lenses are not cheap. The cheapest kit lens are around $150, decent zoom lenses are 500 and up, quality consumer telephotos costs $700 and up, macro lenses costs $400 and up, fast zooms, primes, and telephotos can easily go into the thousands.<br>  - Furthermore, there is no true "do it all" lens on a dslr. The best you can get is a 18-270mm (27- 405mm 35mm equivalent) Tamron , but that it still far off from the "superzoom" compacts of today, often with a 35mm equivalent of 28- 500mm range. Furthermore, those "do-it-all-lens" do not have macro capabilities either.<br>  <br>  <br>  With those tips in mind, no dslr has built in macro capabilities. No dslr has a built in zoom lens that would go as far as the Fz8. I'm not sure what 1000 singapore money is when converted to canadian, but the most cost effective way to own a dslr and lens that would cover your everyday shooting would be to get a Nikon D40 with the kit 18-55mm, and a 55-200mm lens that would cover your telephoto needs (under $600 on amazon.com) Then maybe you would want to get a macro lens too; the Sigma 70mm f/2.8 has generally positive reviews for it (costs $450 on amazon.com)|`|AA12191047	When you are talking about consumer SLR cameras there is Nikon, Sony, Canon, Pentax, Panasonic, & Olympus. And they go in that same order from Highest to lowest price. And all the base models are comparable in performance & picture quality. I have used all except the Sony and have a good friend for the source. It depends on the user if they are a photographer and have a brand preference. I would suggest a 4/3 system camera which would be any of the new Panasonic Olympus E- whatever SLR cameras With interchangable lenses. An E-420 would be good, plus in-body image stabilization. I love the New Panasonic Lumix G-1 camera. It is so small and light and if you have any old film SLR cameras with lots of lenses or can get any old camera lenses cheep, with an adapter you could use all the old lenses. Only the Panasonic and Olympus 4/3 cameras let you use old lenses from any camera with original quality via adapters. Also the Olympus cameras go for all the other brands and only Olympus and Pentax have in-body image stabilization. Other camera brands like Panasonic put it in the lens, so you can either buy the regular lenses or if you want in-body image stabilization you have to pay more per lens. But thats just a feature not everyone needs

Some have full manual setting and the ability to use an external flash etc. The big issue is cost, all of the reall good ones are expensive. <br>  <br>  Try going to www.dpreview.com and looking through the thousands of reviews of almost every digital camera ever made.<br>  <br>  While you are there, look at the Panasonic DMC-LX3 - it is a brilliant small digital and exactly the same camera as the Leica version but at a much lower price. A lot of very well known professional photographers carry one as a pocket camera.|`|kkJp175zaa	A-series are good. A590 is the latest, and it's not expensive.<br>  <br>  If you want to stick with Canon... then SX1 IS/SX10 IS are excellent, particularly the first. They're ultra zooms, and the former has HD recording. They are plenty of other brands offering UltraZooms, but you wanna stick with Canon, there you go.<br>  <br>  I really don't like IXUS... so I wouldn't suggest it.|`|AA12191047	Actually If you want to stick with Canon i would look at the Power shot G-9 or G-10. Its a great camera with professional features that you will learn to use more as you grow as a photographer. I have many Photographer friends that use ad love this camera and know professional photographers that use this camera as a backup and keep in their pocket for a walking around New York City camera.|`|FdssEauAaa	I am a huge fan of my new Canon IXUS 80 IS.  This is known in the US as the SD1100 I think.<br>  <br>  This is the first camera I've had which records decent video.<br>  <br>  Anyway, besides that, the great feature is the optical image stabilisation, which makes it great for low light situations - this thing was made for social functions and parties because it is ultra slim, fits in your pocket, has face detection so the focus and flash is just perfect when taking photos of groups of people, and is yet fairly configurable, more so than most compact digital cameras.  If you are prepared to twiddle with the menus you can do special effects, long exposures, manually adjust the exposure, color and other settings, and more.

It has a lot to offer. Currently lots of DLC to go with it and a giant world to go with it. You will spend to lots of time trying to get stuff finished and still not be down. Best free roam game I have ever played. I give it an overall 8.5/10<br>  <br>  Fallout 3: Made by the same people as Oblivion. At first I thought I would hate it man was I wrong! This game has about as much to off as Oblivion. GFX are outstanding, story is thought out and well done. So much side stuff to do you might not know what to do for awhile. Currently no DLC but I expect that will change at some point. Its a little less open-ended then Oblivion but never the less it is still a great game. I stayed up and got hook playing for 14 hours Straight. Overall score would be a 8/10. <br>  <br>  I give Oblivion a slightly higher score due to the fact it is much more open-ended then Fallout 3 is and for how much sooner it came out the GFX still rival that of Fallout 3. Plus I have played over 70 hours of Oblivion and not even come close to finishing it. However I have put about 40 hours into Fallout 3 and the main quest and a lot of the side stuff is all but finished.

HEs6bzOtaa	I would say now days DVD is much better than VCD<br>  VCD is like 10 years old<br>  get  a dvd player<br>  <br>  hope this helps|`|IH7KP137aa	Compared with DVD<br>  Due to relatively small storage capacity, feature-length films sold on VCD are usually divided into two or three discs and television series may come in a boxed set package with multiple discs. In both cases, most films run at roughly 60 minutes per VCD, before viewers are prompted to change discs. However, there are also VCD players that have built-in CD changers which provide a queue of several discs. Subtitles are found on many Asian VCDs, and unlike DVDs, cannot be removed.<br>  <br>  VCD does have a few advantages over DVD-Video:<br>  <br>  The VCD format has no region coding, so discs can be played on any compatible machine worldwide. Many VCD players can compensate for the differing frame rate and pixel count between NTSC and PAL/SECAM TV systems. <br>  Some titles available on VCD may not be available on DVD and/or VHS in the prospective buyer's region.
RCbtRF4xaa	Logitech QuickCam Pro 9000 Webcam is an excellent cam. I was sceptical at first as it has a high price tag (except on amazon) but when i saw the quality of the build and the quality of the video its just fantastic. Nothing else to say its well worth the money. The low light video is great and it adjusts the aperture perfectly so not grainy images just clear how they should be. the focussing is quite responsive too if you have face tracking on. <br>  One other great feature is its stand its so versatile it attaches to anything or stands perfectly. <br>  <br>  Logitech QuickCam Pro 9000 Webcam <br>  Price: ￡49.57 Delivered FREE in the UK<br>  <a href="http://www.amazon.co.uk/Logitech-QuickCam-Pro-9000-Webcam/dp/B000T5GMJE/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&s=electronics&qid=1235406373&sr=1-1&tag=winkkk-21&linkCode=ur2&camp=1634&creative=6738" rel="nofollow">http://www.amazon.co.uk/Logitech-QuickCa...</a>|`|cc030d61dc9bcfd7d41ed6138df0d0b1aa	I use logitech<br>  logitech.com|`|vkzkXWfzaa	Any Logitech Pro camera and that includes the older ones such as the 4000 Pro and 5000 Pro.

6g1MUG5xaa	get new batterys|`|VJ1C5JsYaa	I don't think it so much a problem with Fallout 3 but more with your controller. There are several things it might be. First is the normal your batteries might be just about dead. I don't think that is your problem since Im betting you checked that already. Also another thing I have noticed with my oldest controller is that since I have used it so much and changed the batteries so many times that the battery pack is slightly lose. Not enough that you actually notice it but just enough that the controller disconnects. I would at least attempt to try another controller and see how that works for you. If that's not the case then I honestly can not tell you what it might be as I have fallout 3 and have never heard of this problem related to the game. It sounds more hardware related then software.
nQ7G1nBVaa	Will you use the steamer enough to make it worth it?
Ml3FH7V2aa	If you changed the HD the DRIVERS for the audio card probably didn't reload.  If you know the audio card maker you can download the correct drivers from the web site. If your computer is Compaq, HP, Toshiba, Dell etc, you can also usually download the audio drivers from those websites as well.<br>  If you have no idea what card you have visit<br>  <a href="http://www.driverguide.com/" rel="nofollow">http://www.driverguide.com/</a><br>  for easy help.<br>  <br>  Drivers are the software that make the sound cards work.

usA4AGQDaa	To be absolutely honest, I don't think you can move messages from the phone memory 2 your sim card.  Sim cards don't hold a great deal of info.
Ml3FH7V2aa	There are several good resources for GPS reviews<br>  Here is a long list for you <br>  <a href="http://www.consumersearch.com/auto-gps/reviews" rel="nofollow">http://www.consumersearch.com/auto-gps/r...</a><br>  <br>  I think you will find Garmin is one of the better units because they have been at it longer than anyone else.  Magellan, TomTom, and several others are also good devices.
YiY9Yd2Jaa	No, not the data part. You can use the SIM card in a non BlackBerry phone just for normal calls and texting, but none of the BlackBerry browser or IM functions, nor can you get email. On a couple of occasions when I have have run out of battery life I have popped the SIM card into a Nokia or Sony phone as a temporary fix.|`|4cMuedpWaa	Absolutely not.<br>  <br>  Can swap the sim in emergency for a call but your internet data will not work as the Blackberry uses its own system so no internet, no emails.|`|BYHmKxpdaa	No. Blackberry uses it own internet and is made especially for its phones.
OVPYlo1Yaa	no, you should be able to receive the call automatically, their might be a problem with the phone check its settings to make sure that its set to allow all calls or just ring o2 customer services for help <br>  Hopes this helps

oQSzZeubaa	Hi!  On one hand, this is an instrument that you have a great deal of experience with, know the shortcomings, and fully realize what needs to be done to make it perform to your current needs.  Look at Brian May, who continued to use the guitar he and his Dad had made themselves!  Apparently, the "Series 10" model was made by the Bentley company, which may have been purchased by Jackson at some point in their history.  Check out <a href="http://reviews.harmony-central.com/reviews/Guitar/product/Series+10/Superstrat+Copy/10/1" rel="nofollow">http://reviews.harmony-central.com/revie...</a> for a couple of User Reviews.  From strictly an impartial perspective, the cost involved in reworking your present guitar (e.g., pickups and pickguard, machine tuners, replacing electronic components, rewiring for additional tone options, etc.) dictates that you would be financially better off finding a new guitar that more closely meets your needs.  Other considerations to factor into your decision would be the neck shape (modern “C” necks are really nice to play), style of frets (medium-jumbo make pull-offs and tapping a lot easier), and bridge design (two-point bridges are a lot more stable than the earlier “vintage” style).  Unless there is a financial issue, why not leave the Series 10 stock to play occasionally, and purchase a new guitar that is more in line with your needs?  Hope some of this helps!  Best regards, Dana
