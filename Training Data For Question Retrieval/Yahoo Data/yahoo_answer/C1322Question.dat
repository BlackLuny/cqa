20090202193222AAh8aG9	Social Science;Psychology	Does anyone know if this is a mental disorder or just a horrible person?	I know someone that will get great pleasure in watching others fail, attempts to make others paranoid, has arguments in his head and then acts out the argument with a friend in the way that he thought about it, only thinks he is right. Does this guy have a problem?

I mean there is probably a really good reason why they can't but I just wanna know why the governement can't just get those machines that print up money and just dedicate a whole group of people to print up money for major companies and for the governement? Again I know if they can't there must be a very good reason, I'm just wondering because I haven't heard them turn down this idea. Thanks!

20090202141901AAk08tm	Social Science;Psychology	Need help with making an important decision?	I have a big problem.   I have been planning to go to an scout outing on one weekend this month for a while now, but now I find out that the winter dance I have also been looking forward to going to for a while now is on the same weekend.     The decision is one way or the other.  I can't fit both events in the same weekend.  Here are my circumstances:   I've been planning to ask this one girl out for a while now (see one of my previous questions) and I was really looking forward to it.  I have not been to a dance for 2 years.     However, my boy scout troop is just starting up, and my boys look up to me as a role model.  THe outing has many challenges and competitions involving scout skills, and I'm the best at most of them in my troop.  I know that the boys will do worse without me, and I'm normally there to provide encouragement and as a resource for them to fall back on when they forget certain skills.  Plus we have a big race, and being the boy with the longest legs, I run the fastest and I have the most endurance.    In my eyes, they are both equal in value, but I want an unbiased opinion from a second source besides my parents.    Don't just say "Do what your heart tells you" tell me what you would do if you were in my shoes.     Thanks.
20090202135406AAL4YE7	Social Science;Psychology	Psych experiment - people watching (naturalistic observation) WHAT TO OBSERVE?	I want to do a naturalistic observation (people watching) for my psychology project, and I want it to be interesting and funny. Any topics of what I could observe people doing without them knowing I'm watching?   EX:      Seeing who washes their hands after going to the bathroom      Dropping money and seeing who takes it and who gives it back   (but not those because they've been done)\      The other thing I'd do is seeing how people react to certain situations.    EX:       Walking up to strangers and saying or doing some different things (like grabbing their hand, smiling, compliments, etc) and seeing how different ages/races/genders react.       Wearing a prom dress to school      It's for a high school class, and it can deal with sex, just not an obsene amount of it!          If you could think of anything interesting for either of those it would be awesome :)

20090202135619AAIWFCq	Social Science;Psychology	How do I get over a broken heart? (Please help)?	This going to be rather long. Anyway, my boyfriend of 5 years was incarcerated for 2 years in February of '07. I made the choice to stick by his side. He told me that he didn't expect me to be faithful, but don't fall in love with the guy. So anyway, the whole year of 2007 I worked and went to school and got my degree. The following year I got laid off from my job. I didn't get a job until May of 2008. Anyway last May I was bored and so I decide to contact some of my old high school classmates on myspace. Some of my classmates added me some of them didn't. The last classmate I added and he responded immediately. He gave me his cell phone number and told me to call him.He told me that he was a marine and stationed in North Carolina. However, he was coming back to our hometown in Aug for good. I swear I have never ever had chemistry like I did with him. He even said it. He was like you know I don't know what is about you, but I'm really drawn to you. So anyway I told him I had a boyfriend that was incarcerated for 2 years. I showed him recent pictures of me and he said I was very pretty. He was reluctant to become my friend since I had my boyfriend. But we ended up talking every single day for hours on end. However, we decided that we would have sex only one time when he got back home since I haven't had sex for at least 16 months. I admit I loved talking to him. He had a very soothing personality. He would literally call me everyday to tell me any new updates in his life. So as the time got closer for him to come the more I got nervous because I never ever cheated on my boyfriend. At first I decided not to do it, but then I changed my mind. When he got here the first night we rented a hotel room and sex. From the time he got in my car we couldn't stop kissing each other. We agreed that we would only have sex once. However, it didn't stop there. One night on my way to work he called me and told me that he needed to meet me some where to talk. Anyway, he confided in me what was bothering him. Then we ended up having sex in his car. The last time I saw him was in Aug. He invited me over his efficiency he was staying at since his parents kicked him out. He loved cuddling with me when I was in his presence. We spent the day together watching movies, buying lunch and dinner, talking, and we couldn't keep our hands off each other. He was like why do we keep seeing each other I thought this was one time thing. I told him I don't know. I guess after that he decided to distance himself from me. However, he told me what apartment complex he was moving to and I told him I was happy for him. Then he called two weeks later and told he was sick and had bronchitis. I asked was he alright and did he needed anything. He said no he was fine. So told him I would call him later on to see if he was alright. When I called him he answered the phone immediately. We chit chatted a little bit and was like he was waiting for me to say something because there were long pauses between our conversation. A month goes by (Oct) and I see on his myspace that he's a new uncle. So I him texted congratulations. He texted me back immediately and said thank you so much. Two months goes by I sign into myspace (I get on myspace once a month or every two months) and I swear as soon as I signed he put a picture of him and his new girlfriend. I was hurt, but, said well he found somebody and I respected that. Then last month he sends me message through myspace stating to call him on his cell phone and typed his number in. However, I didn't get the message till 4 days later. So I sent him a message asking him was he ok and was it ok to call him. He sent me a message right back stating naw that wouldn't be a good idea I was drunk and mad at my girlfriend. sorry.. I found it to   be b.s. because 1. he has at least a 1000 friends on his myspace page list and I'm like on the very bottom of the list. 2. I changed my name to my nickname two months prior and I never told him my nickname. 3. How did he know that I didn't have his cell number. Plus has drunked dialed and texted me a few times and he when he did I couldn't understand anything he said. So my response to him was yea ok and I haven't contacted him since. I noticed while we were on myspace he took his picture down of him and his girl. I must admit I do miss him very much and I think about him a lot. I was trying to get over him since my boyfriend is getting out like at the end of this month. Why the hell do I miss him so much? He's the only guy I ever considered leaving my boyfriend for. It feels like brick landed on my heart.  We're both 26 yrs old. Thing of it is. I'm the one who told him we should only have one sexual encounter and that's it. We did talk about potential relationship, but I was so scared I'd be making a big mistake. He once played a joke on me and texted me that he was not coming, because he reenlisted in the marines. I texted him how long has known this. He said two weeks ago. I got
20090202134447AAohiJn	Social Science;Psychology	How can I help my poor mother!?	I apologize in advance for the length...      My mother was recently diagnosed with Ankylosing spondylitis after having been to countless doctors, misdiagnoses, and wrong treatments. It took her 25 years to get a diagnosis. The disease is hereditary and affects .5-1% of the population. She also had breast cancer last year. This year, my grandfather was diagnosed with bladder, lung, and bone cancer. He only has about 2 months left. My Pop goes to the same oncologist as my mother did, and she accompanies him to every chemo treatment. My mom had recent bloodwork to check for some other disease they thought she might have (she doesn't have it.) This morning when she went with my Pop to the oncologist, the doctor came in and asked her if it'd be alright to tell my grandfather the news. (she assumed it was the negative bloodwork.) So she said yes. The doctor went on to tell my mother that the disease she has is hereditary and he is the likely giver. My grandfather has already lost a son (mom's brother died when he was 25,) and now he thinks he's the reason my mother has been suffering her whole life, and that his predicament is what she will end up like. He's only cried twice in my mother's presence; the death of his son, and now this. She thinks he's going to go to his grave thinking he failed.       Not to mention my poor grandmother! She's losing her husband, lost her son, and saw her daughter suffer through cancer and this disease.       My mother hasn't come down from her bedroom all day, and I'm worried about what this is doing to her (psychologically.) She and her family has already been through so much. HOW CAN I HELP HER?! =(    She's also worried that I might have this disease too.
20090202135649AA3d4qk	Social Science;Gender & Women's Studies	Feminists--were you closer to your fathers growing up?	Well...I am a feminist and a lot of this is because I grew up looking up to my dad, and I wanted to be an engineer, make my own money, not worry about fitting a "feminine" type of behavior (aka being outgoing), and I took a wide range of interests that are both masculine and feminine.       Is it the same with you?  Or if you looked up to your mother, was she more of a feminist type?  Or did you find feminism independently of your family?       I'm wondering if it the same with other feminists here, while anti-feminists probably looked up to their SAHMs or female tv personalities or something, and wanted to focus more on shopping, having kids and getting a richer husband.  (not that there is anything wrong with that stuff!)

I believe true friendship is the willingness to see with both eyes, to understand and accept both the lovely and the unlovely.

20090202134724AAlfQMS	Social Science;Psychology	Kind of a deep question?	You know how you can sense at some level when someone needs attention or to be agreed with for their emotional well being? Let's say the person that needs attention feels threatened by someone, and you can sense it would make them happier to see the person they're threatened by be rejected by others. If you were really good friends with the person they're threatened by, would you feign rejection of your friend when you're with the insecure person? Is feigning agreement with the insecure person a sort of kindness to their ego, or is pretending to support their slander of your friend a betrayal to your friend?       I hope I explained this well. Thank you for any answers.

20090202135953AA8CK0R	Social Science;Psychology	How do I deal with not being the only thing put 1st in her life?	Well, I have a girlfriend I love dearly. And I pretty much put her 1st in my life and would do anything for her.  But I worry about her a lot (Well used to.. I had trust issues from past relationships but I believe I have rebuilt it) and I am very insecure as well.  I have major jealousy issues too, just to add on to that.    Well now to get to the question at hand. My girlfriend is on her school's speech and debate team.  She also figure skates as well. She told me that she has a tie for 1st in her life. And those things are Debate, Figure Skating, and Me.    Right now she just got a new debate partner, who is a guy, but I think I am no longer jealous of him. But the thing is that she has to spend every day for the next week after school with him and because of this I can't see her like we planned (which I was excited for because of not seeing her in a while).  And now she is writing cases and researching.     Now I am not mad at her. I get happy off of her doing well. Its what makes her happy and if she is happy, I am happy. I just want advice on how to better cope with it and deal with not being the only number one thing. Which I completely understand why it is like this.

20090202143456AAZ3iNn	Social Science;Psychology	Am I going wrong inside?	Today I got in an extremely bad mood, but this has been like this for a very long time already... But today, it was a little bit more.      I almost got into a fight with a f*cking 10th grader (I am 9th grade) because he was annoying me and he threw an orange on my face. This really made me mad, because I can be very tolerant, but I can also be very conceited, and so I got really mad and I punched him in the neck with a paint brush, but luckily for both, I didn't do it hard. He then began screaming at me and I screamed at him too and we almost got in a fight but some people tried to separate us... Anyways... after that, I just got mad at everyone, and I just pushed everyone in the corridors and didn't talk to anyone in the class, and didn't even do my work.      So yeah, it's not only that that bothers me... It's just that I am always angry, without showing it, at all these people who just make me sick... Now I could go on a rant against all the humanity, but I think that you don't want to listen (or read would be more appropriate) to my ramblings... But just to say that I feel like I hate love, and I hate all the people who just live their **** life in a **** family just to get married, have sex and **** kids, work and DIE... I feel as if nobody actually cares about neither me, neither anyone else, actually... as if "love" was just a stupid concept to give reason to rejection and all the other sh!t like this... and  I feel sort desperate, because I think I'll never ever be able to live in society, I just want to go alone in a forest or something and make my own house and just live with the nature,,, They seem way more nice than a big chunk of these people. And even though this makes me feel bad, I *like* to feel as if I wouldn't have a family anymore... I isolate myself but I like to be alone, it makes me feel better than with **** poeple. Parents annoy me with their "you smell! You never do your work! You're ugly!" and so on... but I also realise that I am the one who is a ******* jerk who is conceited and thinks only about his little a$$ while kids have far worse issues, but I can't help it... it's a big contradictory feeling... So I don't want to see a psychiatrist or whatever, because they will say that I don't need any help, as you might say too...       I sort of begin to hate everyone, and just today, I decided to take the class picture of the year (every student's got a copy) and to soil it and cut it with scissors and flush it in the toilet while p*ssing on it...               Ok maybe you don't care about any of this crap I told you about, but I wanted to calm down so I wrote this... Please at least have the will to not answer at all if your only answer is "too long, I don't care, 2 points" or "you st00pid sunovab!tch what the **** you wanna say?"      Thanks for reading this, if you have, and I hope I didn't waste your precious lifetime.
20090202143558AAMIEg7	Social Science;Psychology	I'm having a hard time socially?	I'm a 15 year old guy, and I have never had social problems. Even now, nobody but me knows that I have them. I am good in school, very approachable, and I am known as the 'perverted, funny' kid. People like me, but lately, I haven't been liking people back. I transferred from a huge middle school where I was really happy. There were tons of kids to hang out with, but I had to transfer out because I needed to be more academically stimulated. Now, here I am at a much harder school, and I don't know if the kids are all elitists or if I have just made that up in my mind as a way to take emphasis off of the fact that I might be depressed. I feel like everyone around me is a bit pretentious these days. What's worse is that I have no time to hang out with my friends from other schools because there is so much work to do. My only available social time is in school, and it has gotten to the point where I like to sit in the bathroom because I am so bothered by everyone around me. The thing is, I don't really feel depressed. I just feel bored with the people around me. I still laugh easily, joke as much as I used to, and feel passionate about school. However, I make excuses not to socialize and I sit at home. A really good friend of mine who I have known for 5 years and I used to really, really like asked me out, and though I still feel really passionate about him and I am heart-crushingly obsessed with him, I said no. I am becoming more and more withdrawn.      I told me mom that I think I might need some sort of therapy, but she recently stopped seeing her therapist because she lost her job. Money's tight, and I don't know if that's an option.      Will I snap back into being myself? Does anyone have any sort of insight?

Yesterday, I had this HUGE break down where I was freaking out and crying and hyperventilating and there was this whole fight between me and my parents. It was terrible. I'm just lonely. I feel like my friends don't understand. Every time I try to talk to my parents they're all like "It's nothing. You're a teenager. Nothing's wrong with your life. You have everything. Blah blah blah." I just want someone to listen to me. I try reading my bible, I go to church, and I try to seek God, but nothings changing. I just feel so insecure. And so unsure about myself. I just look down on myself and always expect the worse. I thought things would get better, but they never do. I wanted 2009 to change things but I still feel sad and lonely. I don't feel good about myself and I feel like no one understands. I live in a small town with close to NOTHING. I just want to explode sometimes. I feel like people are trying to control me and I feel like no one is listening to how sad and frustrated I am. I just need to know someone is there. My parents are all "Just because we get mad doesn't mean we don't care." But I just feel like they don't. I can be having the darkest of days and they can be downstairs laughing and enjoying each other. I can tell them what's wrong and they can scoff it off like its silly. I just want someone to care.
20090202144125AAUN5lF	Social Science;Psychology	Psychology Question!?	Three year old Ivan frequently takes other childrens toyrs from them, showing little concern for their feelings, even when they cry. When he does this, his mother tells him to "imagine how other kids feel when they lose their toys." using cognitive development to explain ivan's antisocial behavior. Why is his mothers comment unlikely to influence his behavior? How would you encourage Ivan to stop behaving this way?

He has told me that it is good 2 hear my voice, etc... He is like 53 yrs (don't kno 4 sure). I think that I read way 2 much into his looks and body language that he had towards me.  He moved away a year ago...he came back 4 a conference and I saw him again and he was still the same way with me....staring @ me. Our eyes would communicate. I've talked 2 him on the phone twice. The first time was very pleasant. He told me how pleasant it was 2 hear my voice and it was a pleasant surprise. We laughed. He wanted 2 know what was on my mind and I told him that I couldn't say... The second convo. (couple weeks after first one) was about his online bible study class and i just got an awkward vibe that time. LIke he didnt want 2 talk.I have been apart of his online bible study class and he is completely different with me now.  He is just a spiritual figure, but distant @ the same time now. I just feel so bad that I even read so much into his ways. I know that if we were 2 c each other now, he probably would not even pay any attention 2 me like that anymore. Or would he?

20090202203502AApWALl	Social Science;Psychology	Do they think I am a psychopath?	My family often makes references to be self-sufficient nature,   which they see as antisocial.   They immaturely coddle my shoulders, which I find very unnerving, which is of course precisely why they do it.   My sister has told me I am apathetic about most things, and although quite calmly, she stated that she thought it possible for my moral idealisms to dissipate later in life.   Okay sure, I do not care for most people. Why should I, they are not worth it. I hold myself in the highest regard, I have no superiors I have met yet, and my intellectual equals are sparse. But I have a moral system - Politeness, which abhors all that is brutish.   Today I wasted hot water in the shower, and was berated vehemently, too which I responded with the calm admonition that I had done 'wrong', although I do not believe that in any way.   My accuser departs with the lament 'You don't give a sh*t about anything!'   Somehow I was not punished. This is wherein lies my question - my accuser proclaimed that something must, must, be done about my wasteful disregard. Yet he only reminded me once more, and he looked very nervous, and my mother very snarky in her insecure latching nature.   I feel quite nervous about them.   After all, the government has allotted them my every right.   But is it indeed my calm demeanor that asserted a puzzlement, probably an aversion to and out of a base instinct to back away from my elitism?   Remember the question is not of my actual psychopathy.   A shower is an eloquent philosophical thing that feeds the theta brainwaves.

It seems that she is only concerned about men and their feelings and it is up to the women to suck up their feelings, shut up and do anything to make their husbands happy.   And men do not have to do the same.       If a man does something inappropriate, it is the woman's fault.
20090202204727AAN1jN7	Social Science;Psychology	Is it okay to kill yourself?	I've got nobody.   I am way way passed stress and tired of trying to recieve help. I give up.

20090202122112AAJJU8q	Social Science;Psychology	What is this phenomenon called?	I hope this doesn't sound too crazy, but I wonder if anyone can relate to this.  This sounds weird, but I can't help it.      We all know that some people are transsexual or transgendered.  These people are trapped in the body of the wrong gender (or they believe that they are).  In other words, someone who is physically a man but feels like they were meant to be a woman... would be considered transgendered.  They sometimes go on to have gender reassignment surgery, and go on to have relatively (compared to the past) normal lives.  I don't understand it, but I wouldn't judge them either (I have no idea what it's like).      Is it unreasonable to suppose that some people are born with the wrong last name?     Some people simply don't like their last names, but that's not what I'm referring to.     I don't know very many people like me, who have a legal last name that they can't identify with.  I felt like I was meant to be named something else.  I hate the name Williams, but I don't even think of it as "my" last name.  I feel like I got stuck with someone else's name.  As a kid in school when I had to sign that name I felt like I was being forced to wear someone else's ugly old shabby sweater.      I think that males have it easier in the world for a number of reasons and I've disliked my gender, but I know I'm a woman.      When I found out I had Spanish ancestors I was happy at first but now I feel foolish telling people.  Your last name represents your heritage.  There's nothing Spanish about Williams, so when I tell people that's my name they think I don't have Spanish blood.  It's really annoying because I loved latin culture and longed to be a part of that world.  I have a name that labels me an outsider.      Is there a name for this?  I got stuck with this legal name, but I feel like I'm not a "Williams," or that I was supposed to have a different name.  What does it mean?      I don't mean to offend anyone but I just feel like I was meant for another name.
20090202115130AA9bcIQ	Social Science;Psychology	Did I do the right thing? If so, why do I feel so depressed? ?

I told my mother it should go see a vet and she was like she is too tired and there is money involved so I told her that I would pay her back b/c its just a helpless little kitten.       It hates me b/c its not used to humans and I don’t know what diseases it could carry and I have another little kitten that I’m scared will be sick too, that hates the orphaned kitten and growls at it.  I don’t know if I’ve done the right thing or if I’m doing the right thing b/c I don’t know how to care for a malnourished  kitten. And I have to do everything alone, but I can’t b/c I don’t know how.      Nobody seems to care about this little kitten and I do but I don’t know what to do and it feels like I’m just making everything worse b/c the kitten looks so sad and no one seems to care. I just don’t know how to make things better. I just feel so selfish b/c I’ve brought this big burden and messed up everyone’s life and I don’t even know if I’m doing the right thing.

I won't go deep into details, but I recently got out form a severe depression with a help of a girl, who later just dumped me, because we were in a rebound relationship. She got back to her ex... I love her, although and I move on... But the problem is that, i don't have a support, cause all my real friends got busy and don't even call me (when I call them, they say, they are not available) and in some ridiculously fantastic way my virtual friends from social sites don't even reply me. None of them... I feel terribly, because playing on the guitar, listening to good music and going out to take some photos doesn't make me feel good... Now what the hell I am supposed to do right now??????????
