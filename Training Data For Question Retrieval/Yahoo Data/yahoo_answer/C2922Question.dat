20080619091943AAJiwEE	Environment;Other - Environment	How can I improve this topic on an ecological crisis?	I was considering the topic "Basic Human and Civil Rights or The environment".  It is about balancing human and civil rights with the needs of the environment.  In the future, the world ecological system may not be able to handle several billion people, causing death, wars, suffering and increased poverty.  But the right to life and liberty are basic fundamental human and civil rights, should or can world governments impose various forms of birth control & eugenics, to keep human populations within manageable levels?

20090223004544AACvN0m	Environment;Global Warming	What if Climate Change...is not really happening and is just an illusion blown out of proportion by activists?	Today, the Climate Change agenda has engulfed high ranking politicians and world leaders. The media has constantly mentioned about 'sustainability', 'green energy', 'conservation', 'endangered species', 'global warming' etc.      However, has anyone ever stopped just a moment to think, is all this really true and really happening? Is our world getting into trouble with rising temperatures? Why are so many people so obsessed with saving the Earth and saving trees when millions are dying in Africa?      Where's the evidence that rising temperatures are directly responsible for unstable weather patterns like flooding in Bangladesh or more hurricanes in the North Atlantic?       Historical weather patterns has not shown that climate change is really happening. For example, during the Carboniferous Period millions of years ago, North America and Europe are sweltering hot and tropical, unlike today's temperate climate. The earth has undergone cycles of heating up and cooling down over millions of years.      What is strange is that not more than a few decades ago, people are worried that Earth may enter into another Ice Age. A hundred and fifty years ago, during the Industrial Revolution, it was so cold even frost fairs were held on the frozen Thames River in London.       The historical climate patterns are not very consistent with activists' claims that climate change is really happening.      I don't see it a good reason to allocate a large portion of the budget to green energy and renewable energy when we can't even eliminate poverty, get rid of deadly diseases and stop starvation in Africa. Why spend millions to save some endangered animals when people are dying without hope somewhere else? It is sheer hypocrisy.      PS: This is not an attack on Climate Change but a critical review of its proposals and ideologies

20090223005217AALAwsW	Environment;Conservation	Why isn't TATA stopping the port construction at Dhamra in spite of widespread protest?	A new port is being built at Dhamra, Orissa, dangerously close to the mass nesting site of the Olive Ridley turtles. " Its less than 15 km from the turtle mass nesting beaches at Gahirmatha, and just five kilometres from the Bhitarkanika National Park, India’s second largest mangrove forest and home to the saltwater crocodile, aside from other lesser known natural wonders.", quoted in the Greenpeace India website campaigning for the turtles,  http://greenpeace.in/turtle  . As you all might know already, these turtles are an endangered species and need all the help that they can get.      The port construction happens day & night, and the night lights(artificial lighting) at the port throws the navigation of the Ridley sea turtles out of whack, who've travelled half-way around the world back to their beach-of-birth to mate and bring forth the next generation.      Human interference with nature in the guise of development will only bring more harm to our planet. If the construction continues, the pristine habitat of the Olive Ridleys will face irreversible repercussions along with the mangrove forest, housing the saltwater crocs.      What do you think should be done?
