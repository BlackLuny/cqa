20080305140731AA9ZU3z	Pregnancy & Parenting;Pregnancy	Is there a high possiblity that I am preganant, or a low one?	I had sex about two weeks ago unprotected with my boyfriend. He was in and out about two times and then I said stop, because I didn't want to risk anything happening. After that it took him about another half an hour to "finish" through other things (no more sex). I spotted two hours afterwards for about two days. I also do not got my period regularly. I take a pill to start the cycle in the first place (aka release the egg, and such). I'd like an honest opinion, no trash talk please. I know it was stupid.

Ok, so there are so many posts about the octuplets, but I just watched a video clip where the grandfather stated he was going back to Iraq to help earn money to care for the children and his wife had filed for bankrupcy. Who else feels for these grandparents (even though they don't have the heart to kick their daughter out). They are taken advantage of and at an older age they should be relaxing and reaping the benefits of having worked their whole lives, not to be ran ragged changing diapers, waking up at 3 am, and financially supporting 14 kids and their "adult" (I use the term loosely) daughter. Who else feels these grandparents are being taken advantage of?

I don't understand it.....why do some women want babies so terribly...only to then complain when they don't sleep long enough, or they have to hold them for them to go to sleep....or they don't want to feed them so often. Jeesh..I mean....isn't that what newborns do?? Im a very young mother of 3 children, and work full time, and never do I complain about how my newborn doesn't sleep....or what I have to do to comfort her...I just do it....because Im their MOTHER. Thats what Im there for. Not to make them little robots and to hurry them into being independant as an infant so that I don't have to do so much for them. I'm just curious as to why some mothers are like this??

Please PLEASE do not harass me in any way here, I'm suffering from quite a bit of trauma for the day, and I'm in no way prepared for any more.    I am/was 3 weeks pregnant, almost a month. For definite.  Last night I was starting to spot, brown, and then light blood. I thought, oh, this is normal seeing as my period would be soon if I were pregnant. I get to last night, and I start bleeding bright red. It was only a small amount, but I got worried. My husband was telling me it would all be okay.  I get to this morning and I'm bleeding so heavily, it's unbelievable. I have to change my sanitary towel a lot. I took a test, and it came out negative. All day, I've just been keeping myself to myself, and crying, knowing this is probably a miscarriage.  This weird period thing is causing me great pain. Although when I was lying down, it hurt the most in my right side. I've had these pains for 3 days now, only today having the heavy bleeding.  I've been stressing so hard lately, and this is just making me ill.    Please help? Words of wisdom? x

20090131085425AAvpnQg	Pregnancy & Parenting;Newborn & Baby	Mommy's HELP!!: 9 month old sleep problems?	I asked this question previously but need some more answers. We are having a really hard time with our daughter at night. She used to sleep great, 7am-7pm. Our schedule through the day is perfect and she has no trouble with napping, eating or drinking. I bathe her at 6:30pm, massage then a bottle at 7pm. I burp her, then she falls right asleep. Around 8:30pm she wakes up hysterical. I pick her up to make sure she doesn't need to burp and put her back down. She screams and crys hystercially like I have never heard before. Shes not sick, no fever, and we don't believe she is teething. We took her for her 9 month appointment a week ago and the doctor said her gums do not look like anything will pop up anytime soon. (she has no teeth yet) For the past 4 nights all she does is scream and cry all night long. Last night she finally went down after some juice, then woke again at 12am, and then again at 4am. I tried letting her cry for 30 min but it does not subside. Whats worrying me is the sound of her cry. Its like a cry I have never heard before. It almost sounds like she is losing her voice. I have no idea what to do. She is perfect through the night but its like she is terrified to sleep at night, even if she is exhausted. We have tried everything!! What could be causing this??

20080501050512AA0s0CU	Pregnancy & Parenting;Adolescent	Dirty school politics- how do I stop this guy from winning?	Ok, we have two canadates. One (A) has been on Student Government for 3 years. She spent 2 years as class president, and one year as vice president of the school   The other (B) is on baseball team. Baseball team members are the syeriotypical jocks at my school. He's never run for anything.    B has been using dirty politics- he photoshopped a photo of A so it looked like she was holding a joint, and posted it all over MySpace. The rest of the baseball team helped. The caption under the picture read... "Do you really want a junkie for president?"    So A's bf (the current student body president) retaliated by posting a letter about how immature the baseball team is, using no dirty language or rudness. He has been suspeded from student government. B is still allowed to run, and has not been in trouble for this.    How do I get people in school not to vote for B- or even better, get him kicked off the race? Ideas and advice, plz?

20090131085457AAmjjoa	Pregnancy & Parenting;Newborn & Baby	Recommendations for a schedule for a 2 month old?	We haven't been able to get our 2 month old daughter on a schedule yet.  I've heard some people say that they had their kids on schedule right from day 1, and others say that they started at 3 months.  I've gotten to the point where I have to get this child on a schedule or I will go nuts.      Does anyone have any recommendations?  I figure the night-time schedule should be bath, bottle, story and/or song, and then bed, but at what time should I start that at?  Also, our daughter often will not sleep on her own.  I frequently end up having to get up out of bed and sit with her in the rocking chair until the wee hours.  I'm hoping that an actual schedule will help change that.    Thank you very much for your suggestions.

20090131085726AAUg8HF	Pregnancy & Parenting;Parenting	Would a woman still mary this man?	Would a woman still marry a man who only wants children using a surrogate mother?  This way the child has a legal father, but no legal mother.  If the woman does not want to us her own eggs, he will use an egg donor and she does not have to sign any paperwork or pay any money.  If the woman wants to use her own eggs she has to sign paper work that says that she is an egg donor.  He can never trust any woman with this unless it is his mother, or his attorney is confident that any agreement will hold up in court.  This is legal in California and Illinois, India or Ukraine.

20090131082125AAvXYDg	Pregnancy & Parenting;Parenting	Parenting situation, please read, best answer 10 points?	My daughter Dallia is 12yo. We were on a trip where she had unprotected sex with a boy, they barely knew each-other for 2 days. She started getting nausea a few weeks later. Then she told me about it and we got a pregnancy test. It's positive. I'm going to take her to a doctor but I need some advice first.   1. How should I handle the situation with less psychological consequences for her? (She knew about protection, sexuality, she had a 1-year-lasting relationship with one, I never punish, always talk and we get along very well, I've always handled the situation intelligently and I don't think grounding or taking something away is a good reason for her to stop doing something. Talking always worked.)   2. Is this a pattern she follows? (Her mother was 15 when she had her, I was 18 and I was even younger when I had my son, different mother who was 16)   3. Should she keep the baby or abort it? (If she aborts, she may not be able to have kids again, if she doesn't she will continue school by homeschooling for a while and I will take care of the baby)   Any help is welcome

20090131105719AANGweK	Pregnancy & Parenting;Trying to Conceive	Friend is bothering me about TTC...?	I stopped using birth control in April '08, started getting regular cycles in June '08, and started TTC in September '08. My husband and I are still trying.       I have a very good friend with PCOS who was told she could never have kids. She got married, didn't use protection, and to her pleasant surprise, got pregnant w/in 5 months. She had her daughter in Dec. '07 and she told me the other day that they're TTC as well.       Ok, with all that said... She calls me like maybe 3 times a week or I'll call her & every single time, she answers the phone with "Hey! Are you pregnant yet?!" And sometimes, especially when I just got my period, I want to snap at her and say, "Are we even friends anymore or are you just looking for someone to babysit?" It's allllll she talks about & she's so flipping ungrateful for the one she had "on accident". She even says that sometimes-- "We wanted a boy, not a girl.", "it would have been better if she was planned", "I was so disappointed with the birth experience. I just want this one to go better." Etc. I mean, she's one of my best friends & she's the kind of person who would go out of her way to do anything for you (except stop bugging me about babies).       Advice??? =/

I was severely lactose intolerant as a kid, and while it wasn't quite as bad as an adult I still couldn't drink regular milk or eat anything with a lot of dairy without getting sick.      Then when I got pregnant it no longer bothered me, and even now 16 months later I still consider myself cured. I can eat dairy just fine. I'm pregnant again now, and still able to eat dairy. I think I'm cured for life!      Can pregnancy improve lactose intolerance? Did this happen to you?      Thanks!!!

20090131093753AAVRsYw	Pregnancy & Parenting;Parenting	Are my parents being unfair or am i being a brat?	ok so my parents subscribed to a facility that has a pool, gym, weight lifting room, game room, & a indoor tennis court.   so last night i asked my parents if i could bring a friend with me so we could do tennis while they are in the weight room. and they said yes. so today they asked me if i was ready and i said "yep just let me call my friend" and they were just like "you are not bringing a friend!!!" and i told them how they said i could and stuff and they denied it. so now i when i ask why i cant they just say "because i said so" and i just want a reason why i cant bring a friend. and then i finally said "im not going anywheres till you say why i cant" and they still refuse and now their mad at me because their not going now.      is it really that hard just to say why i cant bring a friend??

20090131092754AA9ciA7	Pregnancy & Parenting;Parenting	6th grader to old to be spanked!!?	Ok I got suspended thrusday for cheating on a test. I got home at 9:30 at morning I was sent to my room until dinner. My dad told me he was going to spank me. When It was dinner time I could go down. My parents just basted on me with how mad they are at me. I have been lying lately past Cerf and not doing my homework so I was getting yelled at about that plus cheeting on the test. I had put my ipod on my ears so I could not hear them when they was not pay any attention. Well yeah my dad saw the ear piece and my ear when he went on about the cheating thing again.( he took my ipod away) By the time they was done yelling at me I was crying. I was not hungry so when I was done my dad told me to wait up stairs for him. I waited in my room I knew I was in trouble but he went way to fair. He came in my room with a hairbrush set the hairbrush on my bed and said the way you have been acting this is not how I am going to have you raised. He was sitting my bed and told me to stand up I did.He pulled my panted down made me go over his knee and spanked me like 14 times or more with his hand. It hurt so bad I was crying!! Then grab ed the hairbrush and spanked me 11 times with it!! Ok today my but is still red!! No marks but really really red!! I don't think he had the right to put his hands on me!! He is leaving on a trip today so I don't have to see him for like 2 months (took my ipod with him!). I don't want to make him sound like an evil guy he does not spank me but 2 or 3 times a year if I am really bad. I just think being in Middle school that he shoudl stop spanking me!! Do you think he was wrong!! He has never spanked me with an object until now!!

She got a demerit and had to serve a detention after school. When she got home her parents found out she owed a book report, so they said she couldn't eat until that was done (she didn't eat that night,she didnt get it done) and her parents took away her internet/computer priveledges, phone, TV in her bedroom (she can't sleep with it off) and basically the whole communtication that night was screaming. and now her parents are making her stay after school to make sure all the work gets done..Every day mon-fri.

20090131101020AAmkN7a	Pregnancy & Parenting;Parenting	Moms- please read this- need advice?	I want to start a unique uplifting newsletter! I need everyones advice whether its bad or good pleassee!?   Ok first off, thanks for reading this. Since my letter will be going to people like you, its vital for me to have your opinions.      Here is my idea-       While watching the news, reading the newspaper, basically listening to everyones convos- I notice one thing- its all bad!   No one ever talks about the good things in life anymore. ITs who murdered who, how our markets are dropping, teen suicide rates, etc.       Am i right?      I love to write! But I dislike writing at school because I like to free write my thoughts while including others, not write about a particular subject a teacher gives me that I may know nothing about and have to fake that I do.      So.....    I want to disperse a local womens/family newsletter.          MY ideas   Include good positive uplifting things like: (tell me if these are weird or too generic)      1 GOOD things people have done in our local communituy (i live in a pretty big one)      2. GOOD rates/statisics       3. ways to shop better even if its just some good low cost recipes      4. I have to include some workout/motivational tips since its a womens newsletter.       5. ways to do more things that cost less like matinee movie days, crafts, how to find good scholarships, schools with good tuition.      6. parenting tips,makeup tips, inexpensive spa treatment ideas you can do with home goods      7. alot of people want to volunteer or donate time but dont know where or how, so i would include local events like runs, walks, breakfasts, benefit dinners people could help with or if they have money they could help sponser.      8. maybe coupons? I was thinking if it got popular I could ask local boutiques or shops to buy a block of advertising from my newsletter and they could include like (bring this add and get 15 percent off) stuff.      9. ways to recycle, reuse etc      I want my newsletter to follow the theme "be the change"   everyone wants a changeing world.... but no one is doing anything about it.       let me know what you think whether its harsh or not. I love to listen.      also, I need ideas on how to pay for stamps and such. I would just put my newsletter around shops till it got a little popular, then people could join a mailing list and I could charge a few bucks a month for like a bi-weekly newsletter??       would you as someone who would read something like this pay a few bucks to get a newsleter of this sort sent to you twice a month?      Yes, I am a very girly girl. I do everything from four wheeling to pageants. Sorry if I sound too fakey/dreamy world like. I have goals/dreams and I am always looking for ways to share a few smiles!
20090131102254AAldKkV	Pregnancy & Parenting;Toddler & Preschooler	How do I get my 4 year to listen to me?	My son will be 4 years old in April.? Everyone tells me his behavior is normal and not to worry.? My son wont listen to me at all, no matter how I ask or what I do. Everything is a fight with him, from getting dressed to brushing his teeth.? I 've tried to play games and talking calmly.? As far as discipline, I 've tried time outs, taking toys and activities away.? I've even done what I don't like, because I don't know what to do anymore, and that's yelling and patting him on the butt, just to get his attention. He listens to his dad but not to me. He acts like a child who gets no attention.? When I get home I greet him by hugging him and telling him how much I missed him and love him and I then ask him about his day.? I spend time doing things with him every night.? The amount of time varies, but he does get my time every night.? I don't feel I need to spend every minute I am home with him.? I feel he needs to learn that mommy has things I have to do and that's its okay to play by? himself.? How do I get my son to listen to me?
20090131103632AAuYSwP	Pregnancy & Parenting;Adolescent	Unexpected teen father?	alright, well i turned eighteen just under a month ago, and around that time i had sex with a girl that i have known for a while but we have never really been close ever ,we talk every now n then and it was just a one night thing. no protection was used, and as i was getting closer to finishing i asked her what she'd prefer me to do, she said to finish inside of her, i said won't you get pregant and she said no i won't. so iassumed she was on birth control or something. anyways like two weeks later she tells me shes pregnant. i told her aboretion os what seemd right in my mind as were both  still kids in high  school etc etc. she also lives in a different city and whatnot. she told me she wants to keep and doesn't need my help regardless of anything and basically won't listen to a word i say and doesn't even seem like she wants me to be a part of it what soever. she has about six siblings i think, a few which have children ,and her parents said they'll support her dicsion if she wants to keep it. I'm college bound and alreayd got accepted into a few universities. my life was all on track until this happened and i'm completely mind F*cked now. I can't/ don't want to be a father at this point, my homelife is already unstable as we are getting foreclosed and my parents are splitting. i just want to go to college and make something of myself and then have a kid. i don;t know what the heck to do, and especially with the situaiton of the mother, she barely ever will tlk to me, even if i try calling she usually ignores me. i feel like i'm losin my mind everyday and i don't know what to do... i know i'm going to get a lot of flack for this, but if at least one person could tell me something...i just want to keep pursuing my education and whatnot, i don't how to go about this

20090131123552AAt7opP	Pregnancy & Parenting;Parenting	How is it possible to have some hot kids and some ugly kids?	I don't understand how that works, I thought family genes run in the entire family? So how can a guy who's really hot, have a sister who's not so hot? There's this girl at school who isn't that good looking, but her brother is. I always say to her, how can somebody as ugly as you be related to somebody as hot as your brother. What you think I'm mean for saying that to her? Well boo hoo, I don't care if I hurt her feelings, she deserves it for not having the hot genes like the rest of her family.  How does that work though?  Do the genes not get passed down the same to every kid?  Wow I feel so bad for that girl, she got the ugly genes lol.

I know if its colored it's usually pretty soon. Or if you know the answer to the question and you didn't experience it that's fine too.    Also, my midwife said I am effacing yesterday. She didn't say how much. She could not reach my cervix and she said she didn't want to put me through the torutre yesterday but she's gonna check again Wednesday.

He'd rather have his hand than the pacifier which is fine and he doesn't suck on his fingers just makes his hand into a fist and sucks on it and it's starting to get kinda dry and starting to crack and don't dare put lotion there because then he'll suck on his hand and get lotion in his mouth.

But i have suspected pre eclampsia and i have to go to the hospital everyday to get checked. I know its a possibility every time i go i could have to get induced but today they really wanted to do it and i basically refused it. I got myself in such a state and cried loads! The thing is i wasn't prepared at all today, they just sprang it on me and being stuck at the hospital all day i couldn't eat anything (no facility's there other than chocolate vending machines, yes i should have taken something with me but i didn't) and i was so tired from being there all day i just didn't wanna do it. I am going to speak to my midwife tomorrow & i think i will let them do it monday but i no it will be a repeat of today where i am going to cry alot and get myself into a mess. I need to calm down but i dont no how to. i'm terrified of it! If i go naturally i have no choice and i will just go with it because i am doing it there & then but if i am induced i know whats coming and i cant calm down. Does anyone else feel like this and what can i do to overcome it?

20090131130325AA5iNOW	Pregnancy & Parenting;Newborn & Baby	Am concerned about starting my baby on cereal....advise please!?	I know you get cereal that you add milk and cereal that you add water. I exclusively breastfeed but have no luck expressing milk(10 ml in an hour). So I have to use the cereal that you just add water to.My concern is that it contains formula....how do I know what formula? And could that small amount of formula cause any problems(allergies,constipation etc)? I am a first time mom and really want to do whats best for baby.

20090131123333AAS7axB	Pregnancy & Parenting;Pregnancy	Should I tell my baby's father that he needs to be there for my pregnancy with the terms all or nothing?	I recently learned that my boyfriend was cheating on me. We had a huge fight and we stopped talking for a minute. Then I found out that I was pregnant. I called him to tell him and he seemed really interested in keeping it and being an active part of the baby's life. The thing is that he doesn't know if he wants to be an active part of my life. I found out on Wednesday, it is now Saturday and although we have talked about it over the phone, I haven't talked to him in person. I keep trying and well, we have been having a lot of conflicts about our schedules and getting together. I want to tell him that I need him to be there for it all or he can't be a part of it. What I am thinking of requiring from him is this: he needs to meet my grandparents as my boyfriend and then help me tell them that we are having a baby. I need him to help me tell my mom and my sister. Then I need him to be there for all of my doctors appointments and my baby shower. I want him to come around often. Not just once a week and not just when he feels like it. He needs to make an effort, too, because I'm not just going to call him and ask him to come over every time I might want to see him. I need him to take some initiative. He needs to be there to help me figure out housing arrangements (because right now we both live with other people), he needs to help me come up with a savings arrangement for our baby so that we have everything we need when it gets here, we need to do a lot. He needs to be an active part of mine and the baby's life, or I am going to completely write him off, not give him any details, accept any phone calls or text messages or anything. He needs to be there for the baby and I and forget about all these other girls who aren't carrying his child. He needs to make the baby and I a priority even if we aren't together or I have no problem dropping him like a bad habit. Is that too much to say? If so, how should I modify it. If it's not enough, let me know that, too.
20090131125935AAzDamn	Pregnancy & Parenting;Newborn & Baby	My baby had his collar bone broken during delivery, is it safe for tummy time?	My son is 3 weeks old, and was 10 pounds. I had an extremely hard and painful time giving birth to him mostly because of his size, which  resulted as a fracture in his collar bone. There isn't anything that we can do for him besides being extremely careful with his right side, and the doctors said that the fracture will heal in 6 weeks or so.      I was curious about laying him on a mat on the floor to help him build muscle like American Baby Magazine suggests, but am concerned if that could result in a bad thing. I lay him on my stomach and he lifts his head a lot by himself, and it doesn't seem to hurt him much, yet I'm afraid to let him do it too much in thought of it making the fracture worse.       What is your opinion on this?

20090131112147AAkgNK0	Pregnancy & Parenting;Trying to Conceive	I've come up with a plan. tell me if you think it is wrong?	i recently suffered a mc. DH was so excited when i got my bfp and crushed when the baby was lost. he also expressed that he doesn't want to mess with home pregnancy tests anymore. and since i've had a loss prior to this one, he had a hard time getting excited about this baby, and as soon as he did. it was gone. so, i'm thinking the next time i get pregnant, i won't say a word. i'll go on my own, and get the blood test, and wait till i'm at least 7-8 weeks to tell him. the only thing is, i'm not sure how he would feel about this. probably mostly surprised that i kept the secret for so long. but maybe upset that i didn't tell him. i just don't want him hurt again? what do you guys think. i know you don't know my DH, so it will be hard to say how he would feel. but what are your personal feelings on an idea like this? thanks for reading, and baby dust to all!

I am supporting my wife and new baby of 3 months. We often argue about taking care of the baby on weekends. In a recent fight, she said that taking care of a baby is harder than what I do because it's 24/7. Meanwhile, I commute 1+ hours a day to the city and work in a high stress corporate environment. I find this hard to believe - so I'm asking anyone out there with experience - is my wife right that motherhood is harder or is supporting a family financially in a corporate job harder?

20090131142110AA7tZRC	Pregnancy & Parenting;Adolescent	Guys: Do you have problems starting conversations with girls?	I do.       I go to trampolining classes (yeah, laugh if you want, but then again, the level of fitness and concentration far outdoes that required in soccer/football), and there are all ways these 3 girls there (10, 11, 13). I don't have a problem speaking to the youngest one, but I feel strange talking to the other two. If they start the conversation, I don't seem to have that problem, but if I start it, I feel weird. This mostly applies when I speak to the 11 year old (she goes to the same school as me). I am starting to overcome the problem with the oldest one, but I still feel kind of strange. It stops me having conversations with them, does this happen to you? Because I really like them, but it's just this really annoying feeling.       PS: I'm quite a bit taller than them, and my voice has broken (I'm 13) and a lot of the time, they seem to think of me as an older teen (15-16), is that what makes me feel uncomfortable?       PPS: When they ask me to do things like "As many somersaults in a row" and I say no, they just start giggling and call me scared. I'm starting to think one of them likes me (the oldest) because she stares at me quite a lot. Today I starred back and she just started laughing.

20090131135824AAb4E78	Pregnancy & Parenting;Pregnancy	Squishy Stomach and yet hard...pregnant?	I keep thinking i might be pregnant...from either this month or from november or december....i had a period in november and december i took plan b, january i had a normal period but then i had sex and now im worried because people say that they had their period throughout their pregnancy. I took 7 hpt in december. all were negative, but then people said they never got a positive till 3 months in ( im 18 if this is a factor) Other symptoms i've been having: upset stomach/loss of appetite, itchy stomach. I wiped the other day and i had a lot of clear goop, i have a headache that goes down my neck and im constipated. my period isn't due until the 13th or so....Also this morning i layed on my back and pushed on my stomach like 2 or 3 inches in from my hip bone and it made a like watery squishy noise, it does that on both sides....what is it? is it from constipation? We used a condom every time and we only had sex 5 times, they were ribbed condoms with extra lube and when i looked at the condom there was like dried white stuff in the same spot on 3 of them, could it have been lube that had dried? He pulls out before he cums, but i know he had pre-*** a little below his belly button so is it possible that some of it got on the condom? Is it too soon to test? last time we had sex was the morning on wednesday, but i'd been having all of these things way before that. The goopy stuff was on thursday. Would a blood test pick it up? Is it too soon to have symptoms?  What are the odds of 2 different brands of hpt bought at different locations in different towns being wrong? Also the symptoms seem to lessen/go away for like half an hour after sex or orgasam. And i have to pee....alot. Like i haven't had anything to drink yet today and i go to pee like 2 times an hour but only like a very small amount. I also have sharp pains in my stomach

20090408135059AAnFzS3	Pregnancy & Parenting;Adolescent	On May 24th, I will no longer be a teenager. How should I spend my final days of adolescence?	Before I get to the question, I want to say that I will not be answering for about a week. I will hopefully be back after a week, and hopefully will be here to stay after that. My son is still in the hospital, I still visit him, I still worry about him, but he's okay, and that's GOOD NEWS. He's much better than I thought he was, and better than I made him out to be, but I was worried about him, because he's my world. So, I will be back to answering in about a week, so I will see you all then.   Now, to my question. I am nearing a month until I am no longer a teenager, which is pretty exciting to be completely honest, but it is scary. I like being a teenager. I don't want to be twenty. Gah. Anyway, what should I do in my final month of adolescence? Any suggestions? I feel like it would be good to get a preliminary list going of things I want to do, beginning on April 23rd, and ending on May 23rd, the day the day before my twentieth birthday, the day I am dreading. I want to make the most of my adolescence, so I would like to know what you would do if you were me. How would you spend your last month of adolescence?      Thank you      ~~Geo
20090408151319AAU953E	Pregnancy & Parenting;Adolescent	How do you apologize to someone who hates your guts?	I said something mean to a girl, and I hurt her feelings, and now I feel really guilty. She probably hates my guts, and I feel guilty about saying these means things. I was under a lot of stress, and wasn't thinking. I wasn't really her friend...I barely knew her, but it hurts, because I'm not the kind of person who likes to be on bad terms with people. I don't know how to apologize to her, because I'm honestly angry with myself for letting myself say something nasty about someone who I barely know. Suggestions?

I have moved my 21 week old from her Moses basket to her cot today. She has fallen asleep but I am so worried about cot death. I wont go downstairs and keep checking every couple of minutes that she is breathing. I bought a basic foam mattress for her as my health visitor advised it doesn't matter what sort of mattress it is as long as it is brand new but now I am thinking whether I should have invested in a fancier mattress for her with the pocket holes and everything so that i don't worry so much. Is there anybody else who has felt like this and if so what did you do to relax?!  Also has anybody used the babesafe mattress wraps and would you recommend them? Thanx in advance

Me and my mom and aunts were talking about what i would name her.    I told them I like:   Kaydee Rayne   Isabella Rose   Layla Hayden       Then they laughed and my mom told me that if I named them one of those names it would be obvious I was a teenager when I had her.    They all said they were awful.       Now, I'm willing to reconsider, I just like those names. They sound cute and pretty.    Do you think they'll reflect an immature mom?

20081004203114AAclDgt	Pregnancy & Parenting;Baby Names	Need A New Name... With Pictures!?	Hi everyone! So I've recently come to the realization that my name really doesn't suit me. Hardly anyone, even my parents, actually call me by my name — it's always nicknames. I sometimes don't realize people are talking to me when they call me by my name because I'm so unused to hearing it... so I think it's time for a change. I'm also about to graduate this year, and I'm worried that my name won't suit me as I grow up, move out and get a job — I don't think it's very adult sounding. So anyways, take a look at the pictures below, and tell me what you think my new name should be!       http://i446.photobucket.com/albums/qq182...     http://s446.photobucket.com/albums/qq182...     http://i446.photobucket.com/albums/qq182...     http://i446.photobucket.com/albums/qq182...       p.s. I'm of Germanic descent, so if anyone has names that could reflect my cultural background, I'd love to hear them!
20081006084453AAnh9K6	Pregnancy & Parenting;Trying to Conceive	Temp drop day AFTER implantation possible?	  I chart, & am familiar w/ cycles, day counts etc.  However, in the months of doing this never had this happen.     +opk, ff.com, & bbt charting.   On 4 dpo I had dk brown when wiped twice yesterday & my temp in the morning the highest of this cycle.  However, today, my temp dropped very low (as low as it was during af cycle).     My question is: can you have the temp drop the day after implantation (if that is what happened, even though I think it's too soon).  I reviewed my chart to see if I O'd sooner & looks like I could POSSIBLY have O'd 3 days earlier (by my temp chg), & our bd times would match, thus guessing I was actually 6 dpo instead of the 4 dpo I thought I was?       A catch, I forgot to mention.  I started af on 10 dpo last month & never done that before.  I normally start 15+ dpo.  Does anyone feel that may have caused my cycle mess up this time?       Ah, confusing?  yah, me too!     So, I have never spotted like that 2 weeks before my af time.  I am curious because if I'm not pg, I'm taking a job, but I want to assume I am pregnant, & therefor will NOT take this job.  But, don't want to waste my tww wishing I am because these signs, when it is sadly, just a "glitch" in my cycle this month!  I know it is too soon to go to the doctor, too, just wanted to hear if others had this similar.   THANKS!

Normal 15 luteal   2.  +opk- faint line oct 1st (cd11)   3.  temp shot up oct 2nd (assumed oct 1 was O day)   4.  temp dropped w/ in normal temps oct 3 & 4   5.  brownish when wipe on tissue 5th-day, & highest temp spike of my         entire cycle   6.  temp dropped yesterday (lowest of entire cycle) & stayed low today   7.  today +opk w/ fairly dark line (but not darker than control line)   8.  AF isn't due till oct 17th   9.  CM leads me to believe I could have O'd around either test, and         FF.com says it isn't sure since I posted my lowest temp on oct 6th         (cd 16)      ? faulty opk test oct 1st?     ? you know how to add link for my chart?

I just feel so disgusted and disappointed. I don't understand this. I had a VERY faint positive at 2 days late, but nothing since then. Everything else has been negative. Why does this happen? I feel like an evil trick is being played on me.       Like, if it was positive, then why do I keep getting negatives now, and still no AF?

I thought that I would be able to handle all this, but I cry at least 5 times a day. I am not happy...ever. My husband cheated and I left. That is causing the panic attacks. Thought I was getting better until these last 4 weeks when all I do is sob! Is there anything I can take for depression while I am pregnant or should I wait it out to see if it is just hormones. Can't go back to the doctor until November because of insurance problems. I know I need to speak to a professional, but I was wondering if anyone had any personal experience with this.

20080927174516AABTP1z	Pregnancy & Parenting;Newborn & Baby	Help with baby's separation anxiety?	My 9 month old has started freaking out when I'm not around, even if i'm just in another room. I was at my cousin's baby's 1st birthday and anytime I was out of sight he cried like someone was stabbing him! My relatives told me that he's 'too attached' to me and I should do something before he goes to daycare at a year old. I'm pretty much the only one who takes care of him, my husband does sometimes but when he does my son won't stop crying, it can sometimes go on for hours. I leave the house in hopes he will get used to it. Plus I'm completely exhausted from never getting a break from our clingy baby.    I'm trying to get him used to other people by bringing him to a playgroup and baby swim class, but its very hard to leave him with anyone. Even when my mother-in-law (whom he adores) watches him for a couple of hours so my husband and I can go for dinner- she calls us before even our food arrives to say to come back because he's so upset. Any suggestions or encouragements??

This is not the first time that an incident of this nature has occurred to him and yet the school does nothing. I was wondering if there was any type of action that could be done because apparently, the school officials don't believe that it's that serious of an incident.

20090408155058AAOYnEQ	Pregnancy & Parenting;Pregnancy	Tell me what you think .. pregnant?	I think I might be pregnant. I'm kind of driving myself crazy! haha So, please help.       Since the 26th of March I have been nauseated allll day long up until about 3 days ago it started slacking off. The first day of my last period was on the 7th of March. It's a very real possibility that I am. Most woman are on a 28 day cycle which means I should have started around the 4th-ish. Well, today is the 8th & even if I was on a 31 day cycle I should have started. The 6th I kind of had a little bit of cramping.. not much though. I thought I was going to start my period but I didn't? So I waited til the next morning and took a hpt & it was negative. I still think that something is going on. For one, I have never felt like this. Secondly, I NEVER miss my period. Always been regular. Today I'm starting to have some pain in my side and lower back which would be about right if I was going to start my period except for the fact that I have good periods, cramping a little bit but no other pains associated with it. If I was pregnant, wouldn't the hpt have told me so?       :/       any thoughts?    should I go to the dr or just wait a little while. I know that a blood pregnancy test is most accurate but my doctor said really the only time they usually do that is if you go to the er?

Also started on clomid on this cycle so dont know if it could be due to clomid.   My period is not due in another 6 days.      No mean comments pls..thank you

20090131091932AAB8J40	Pregnancy & Parenting;Toddler & Preschooler	Babysitting nephew again tonight (5-11)-- fun ways to keep him occupied?	I love him with all of my heart, and I want to keep him happy. He likes to cook with me and he loves choo choo trains and "vroom vrooms".    He says "blue" and he loves puppy dogs (Blues Clues, I think would be a nice match). I've babysat him twice before. I'm in the 7th grade and my mom and little brother are also there. Last night he got sleepy really early, like 6:00 and he usually goes to bed around 11 and wakes up late too. He started crying off and on like two mins at a time and we tried to cheer him up by rewinding backyardigans in the forest going "AUGHHHHHH!" lol so he'd laugh then he'd cry "mama..." it was heartbreaking and even I chokes up. Do you think it's better to say "Mom's gonna be back later" or try to keep his mom completely off of his mind as best we can? What do you think?      And what are some fun activities we could do? He has this "Max" HEBuddy plush dog that he calls "Hah, Hah" when he sees a dog or his plush dog. And he likes soccer as does his dad. We could play "pet store" with my old plush animals and a cash register? And my little brother  (10) has some sport ball pillows that they like to throw around and fake fall everytime it hits one of us. He's really a happy 2yr old, but I want to make his time here really fun.    Sometimes we lay out one of my green blankets and pretend it's grass and make a park w/the animals and get some goldfish or something and put it in a bowl for my old plush animals and him to eat:P   What are some good ideas for us to do to keep him happy and make him have a really good time?   I don't want to make him feel like "Okay, Aicen, we're gonna lay in the living room and nap and watch cartoons". I want something to keep him occupied and really happy. What are you're opinions and some creative ways for us all to get his imagination going and play around the house? Thanks for the help(:

20090131084633AAVgcbH	Pregnancy & Parenting;Toddler & Preschooler	Are my kids the only ones who are naughty?	My boys are very curious. If I turn my back they will get into something. Sometimes its the pantry others its the box I keep the rice in (they like to dump that all over the floor, they climb up the shelves in the pantry). Or, they will take a stool or a chair and climb up onto the counters. Yesterday, my two year old got into one of my cupboards and took out some red ink...      And, started fingerpainting all over my white dining room carpet. WE also went through a toothpaste phase. While *napping* he`d sneak into the bathroom and smear toothpaste EVERYWHERE.      I tell friends about it and they act like I`m nuts. Are my kids the only ones constantly into something? I`ve enrolled my oldest in preschool (starting in August) do you think that will help cut down on the mischeviousness?      PS:  I do the naughty corner. Don`t spank - with the help of the peditrician we discovered spanking was leading to night terrors.

We haven't quite figured out the rooming assignments yet. There is only 3 rooms available, one on each floor. (we filled the other rooms up already) Problem is, there will be 5 kids. (we already have our room) We want the baby to have his own room. So 2 rooms available. My 5 year old wants his own room, away from the noise. We are considering it, because he is in Kindergarten, and the teacher gives homework. We were going to give him in the 3rd story room. But then, Braden, Jason, and Brogan would share the 2nd story room. It is a semi-large room, and they would get a new bed. Should we do this plan, or 5 with 4 year old, and 1 with 2 year old? Also, which would you recommend for a 2,4 year old bed? A trundle bed, or a bunk bed?

I normally use Dove moisture therapy with Vitamin E/cocoa butter as I do for the belly area.  But today OB said I should get some cortizone cream.

I took the EC the day after to prevent becoming pregnant.  However i read that the EC can only stop fertilization from happening, but if fertilization has taken place before I took the pill (i took it 24hours later and heard that you can become pregnant within 4 hours), that i was not able to remove a fertilized egg.        Now i'm having cravings for the strangest foods, my tummy is tender, if i bump it agains something or the car's saftey belt pushing against it, and i have this feeling, quite similar to being nervous, on my tummy the whole time.        Could it be the effect of the EC?  or could i be pregnant?  Please help.

20061208123047AAIgYLW	Pregnancy & Parenting;Trying to Conceive	Hey, if you get this am-I-preggers right.....?	Yup, asking the question again. Taking a test today, but it may be too early, so if it's neg, going to take one in two days, and then one more time. In the meantime, points go to the most creative and accurate.      I miscarried at 6 weeks a couple of months ago, and since then all periods have felt like miscarraiges. Last month, I started the pill (Ortho Trycyclen-low) but didn't start the pack this month because of the nasty side effects I was getting before. My period was light, short, timely, and induced by sex, but just as painful.  Thought I was pregnant, interestingly enough I got a faint positive that happend an hour after the time limit before my period, but later tests said no.      This month, I'm on CD 25, either ovulated on day 12 or 16 so I'm either 13 or 9 DPO. I've had light cramping, bloating, gas, FATIGUE, tiny bit of nausea, a cold, somewhat sensetive nips, and a that dark line on my tummy. I had it right away last time I was pg but I'm not sure if it's from the first one.

20070122063711AAvV4oX	Pregnancy & Parenting;Pregnancy	Kick counts and fetal non stress test...?	My Dr wants me to have a fetal nonstress test next week to make sure baby is getting enuff oxygen b/c I am hypertensive(controlled with meds and haven't had a spike in BP since I've been preg but am spilling a little protein in urine.)  I've read that this test is widely misinterpreted b/c sometimes when it is administered the baby may be sleep or simply chilling and the result may be off.  Also I read the instructions on how to do a kick  count and again I worry about the results b/c my baby doesn't usually move around a lot during the day.  Some days shes VERY active while other days shes kinda lazy.  How can the results of these 2 tests be reliable given the circumstances?  Has anyone had either or both of these tests done  and if so what was the outcome?

20090131084136AAFyebl	Pregnancy & Parenting;Newborn & Baby	Please help...I don't know where to turn...?	I don't know where to start...I'm a 22yr old first time mum. Since having my baby boy now 9 months old I've been treated for post natal depression. Nobody had a clue how severe it was until my partner walked in as I was about to take pills just after Xmas. I was an expert at putting on an act.   About a week later I came clean to the staff at the baby group who insisted I went to A&E in an ambulance where I had a psychiatric assessment.   Shortly after this my Health Visitor asked me to come to clinic for a chat where I was very emotional and when she asked if I would harm my son i said I didn't think so...In these states I haven't a clue what I'm saying...next thing I know I've got social services knocking my door down reducing me to a wreck with all sorts off accusations. My HV told them he was cause for concern for several reasons. My mental state, things I'd said when I was particularly emotional, and the fact that my son is overweight. He's 30lb and has gained lots of weight (even when I breastfed exclusively for 4 months) but his daddy is 6ft 4 so cameron aint gonna be tiny. He's heavy but also long.   Everyone is giving me a hard time and I feel like everything is my fault. I should never have trusted that *****, she's always had it in for me. My partner is supporting me the best that he can but doesn't understand completely.   Now social services say a child protection committee meeting is being arranged with lots of professionals there. I'm gutted. I'm not even supposed to have my son alone! They have pushed me to the edge with their criticism and accusations and I don't know how much more I can take. I feel so lonely and unable to trust anybody. I'm petrified they'll take my baby. I've never harmed him. Nor would I.  Everyone keeps telling me to pull myself together but I just can't.   Have they gone too far? I'm hypersensitive at the moment so surely they could have approached things differently?    By the way...my son was seen by a paediatrician in november who wasn't concerned about his weight and we'd reassess when he was aout 2 but my HV has dragged it on and on.

20090131092345AA6J4f6	Pregnancy & Parenting;Newborn & Baby	What do think  Boy or Girl ?	I'm 24 weeks, carrying pretty high, didn't crave anything in particular initially but now I'm craving chocolate and sugary candy. I've had no nausea and my energy level has been pretty good. The hair on my legs has really slowed down, barely need to shave my legs. Baby heart rate between 153-155.   At my 20 week ultrasound I asked the technician not to reveal the sex but she included this in my report to my doctor anyways and he almost let it out of the bag and said.."they don't normally include the sex unless it's requested."  What do  you guys think?  could it be a boy because they're generally easier to make out on an ultrasound ?

20090131111109AAiCsZU	Pregnancy & Parenting;Trying to Conceive	OPK question? opinions & answers please?	Ok so is it possible to get a false positive on an OPK from using FMU?   I am asking cos I have been testing every day since I got back from hols. It's early for me to O since my period was only on the 23rd Jan so I wouldn't expect to O for another few days at the earliest.   I took tests that were negative at all times of day and then it has been getting darker - yesterday's test (from about noon pee) was nearly as dark as the control if not as dark. hard to tell.   then this morning I took at test with FMU because I was doing an HPT as well. The HPT was negative but the OPK looked like a surge to me. It had a darker line than the control.   I thought that was weird so I tested again this evening at about 7p.m and it's negative again. MUCH lighter than yesterday and this morning's tests. Do you think I have O'd? The surge is not supposed to last long so I guess it fits but puts it very early. good news is we have been having lots of sex including today!   It would put me on a 23-24 day cycle rather than my usual 28-31 day cycle but I seemed to struggle to O last month and had a week long surge before finally O'ing on CD17 of a 31 day cycle.

I tried laying her down drowsy in the bed and left the room but she would start "calling out" to me and then start crying a little in which id return and she would start smiling when she sees me and id give in and give her my breast as a pacifier LOL      I don't believe in letting the baby cry it out.... and even if it was an effective method, i know i can NEVER do that... my heart wont let me... i cant even let her cry for half a minute without seeing whats wrong and comforting her....      are there any suggestions in helping her to find ways to soothe herself to sleep? she used to take a pacifier but recently she just spits it out....

20090131105856AA1iN40	Pregnancy & Parenting;Newborn & Baby	How do I get my baby to sleep through the night again?	I have a 3 month old who was sleeping through the night - going to sleep about 9:30-10:30pm until 6:30 am and then taking a 3 hr nap at 7:30am.  It seems like his bedtime should be earlier - from the books I've read - since he falls right to sleep in the morning; however, my bigger problem is he's waking up now.  Falling asleep about 9pm and waking once in the middle of the night to eat.  I'm not sure what to do to get him back to sleeping through the night - feed him continuously at night, put him to bed earlier, etc?  He's a whopping 15+ lbs.  I'm a bit confused and could use some help.  Thanks!
