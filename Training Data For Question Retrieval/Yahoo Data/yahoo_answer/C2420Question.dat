I want to buy the book Artemis Fowl - The Time Paradox on www.audible.com   (I cant buy it yet because its not out in norway (out in English not Norwegian) so i can't buy it yet)   I like audio books and I improve my english whit it   (when I listen to the English of course)   But I want the narrator to be Nathaniel parker, not Enn Reitel or Adrian Dunbar!      I first taught that Nathaniel didn't narrate The last book, but i googled  a little and found this!    http://www.nathanielparker.com/cms/index...

One of the parts of the source is a whole skeleton of a human, unburied, can't quite figure out why it is that he might have died and what activities this human would have done to cause its death, as it is obvious that it wasn't a noticed death, otherwise it would have been fully buried right?        :)

If you haven't the summary is:      An unsolved murder.A missing child.   A lifetime of deception.   In 1977, pregnant Genevieve Russell disappeared. Twenty years later, her remains are discovered and Timothy Gleason is charged with murder. But there is no sign of the unborn child.   CeeCee Wilkes knows how Genevieve Russell died, because she was there. And she also knows what happened to the missing infant, because two decades ago she made the devastating choice to raise the baby as her own. Now Timothy Gleason is facing the death penalty, and she has another choice to make. Tell the truth, and destroy her family. Or let an innocent man die in order to protect a lifetime of lies…      And if you haven't read it tell me if you want to or not and why.      Oh it's a Target Book Club book. It's the cover with a blue background and a little red haired girl walking away on it.

20090205052816AAWkwrq	Arts & Humanities;Books & Authors	Twilight -- does it get better? (no spoilers, please)?	Okay -- I'm on page 236 of Twilight.  The first 150 pages or so I was really into the book, but it is getting SO repetitive.  Okay, I get it.  Edward is good looking.  He almost glides when he walks.      Her writing is getting on my nerves, too.  They haven't had a conversation where Edward's expression hasn't changed a dozen times.  At each sentence, we find out his expression: angry, his smile half-smiling, eyes look scary, face chuckles, etc...      Are all the books like this?  I really want to find out how the story goes, but the descriptions I can live without, you know?    Stephenie Meyer is certainly no Judy Blume!    But the story is good, just stop with the, "He blinked his eyes and looked mysterious" after each sentence.  It gets old fast.  But I understand this is her first effort.  Surely she improves in subsequent books?

I need to buy a copy of Austen's Northanger Abbey and Persuasion and the Bronte sisters' Jane Eyre, Wuthering Heights and The Tenant of Wildfell Hall.      I'm stuck on which publisher to go for. I need one with a good introduction, biography, bibliography and in-text notes. More information (but succinct and understandable) the better really!      Obviously the most popular are Penguin and Oxford World's. I was wondering which to go for? Oxford World's new editions seem to provide lots of information but the text is a little bit small. Penguin is bigger. Also, which has better paper? I'm going to be doing a lot of highlighting!      Also, are the Wordsworth ones good? What about Modern Library, Oneworld and Vintage?      I've been thinking on this for days, even gone to look at them in the bookstore but I still can't decide. Penguin seems to be the most popular. Found a few Oxford World's and on occasion, Vintage, but not really any of the others.

Im 15 and i love to write, and for the past month or so i have been planning and writing a book, about a girl who moves to the east coast with her younger sister and meets some very strange characters.       Im only three chapters in, and so far everything has gone fine but now ive hit a wall... im trying to introduce one of my favorite characters, keira violet, a girl who is random and crazy and funny, who likes to propose to teachers in the hallways for the hell of it and likes to talk about random things normal people wouldn't dare talk about in public, she just doesn't care.       But now im getting a bit confused. Keira is sort of based on two people, two friends who are a little bit random, but one is rather nasty with it and the other is the complete opposite, but both very strange and confident.       Now im getting confused at how i should write Keira, and she is quite clear in my head but it is hard to put it down into words. Please can someone give me some advise? Thank you!

20090205053950AAdklRq	Arts & Humanities;Books & Authors	Please help! What do you think of my story?	I know I post quite a few of these but I'm trying to develop my writing skills and I feel that this piece is lacking somewhat, but I am unable to distinguish what exactly that is.   Any advice on how to make it more engaging would be greatly appreciated. Thanks!      He gripped the back of his neck, trying to ease the tension, the intense desperation that strained every muscle in his body. The storm was nearing the bay with every moment that passed and the winds howled, banging on the roof of the dark shack. A light flickered somewhere nearby and he glanced at it briefly before looking down at the table. He had lost, and he knew it. This very thought alone made him feel sick to the stomach and pray silently to God that he would get out of this alive.       “Six sixes.” Murmured another man, triumph clearly defined in his voice. Every slovenly-kept drunkard around them jeered, or otherwise cheered, slamming drinks down on the tables, beer sloshing everywhere, drenching their clothes, or splattering onto the floor. A pistol was fired, as the commotion grew more pronounced.       His eyes darted towards the left hand side of the inn. How long would it take him to get out and make a run for it? Not quick enough, he gathered but as foolish men do, he opted to give it a shot on the slightest chance that fate was not against him tonight.       Throwing the wooden chair aside, he jumped on the table, knocking his offender aside in his bid for freedom. There was a sense of uproar as the table collapsed; he landed amongst the rubble and destruction as hands grabbed at him; fists collided with his nose, his jaw and his gut. He doubled over in pain but could not afford to waste a second to compose himself. All he cared about was getting out of there as fast as his two feet would allow. Only one noticed him stealthily exit the inn and disappear outdoors, into the storm that became more furious with every second that passed.      He found solitude behind a pitiful excuse for a harbour and waited out the minutes before he felt safe enough to move. In that short space of time, he watched, grateful that the ships brought with them a shadow that would conveniently conceal him until all danger had passed.

20090205064236AAhtpn9	Arts & Humanities;Poetry	PLEASE... honest opinion!!!!!!?	I learned to write poetry when i was a young teenager, to help with my depression and anger.. I never let anyone see them till now. I was wondering if they were any good could you please be completely honest and let my know what you think...      I search for a reason      I search for a reason, my purpose, an answer; in this thing I call my life. Why must I be strong on the outside but yet so weak an fragile within. I am an old and wounded soul, lost in this world looking for peace and happiness. How much pain can one person endure before they feel no longer?   I have endured many lives of pain, in just a few years in this life, I wonder if I’m cursed, or if their something wrong with me. My heart is empty, it’s a chamber of mazes, which I get lost and scared in when I search it. I feel broken, my tears flow no more and my empathy is not to be found. My dreams have fades, and my life, my world is darkened, darkened by my past.   I am unwanted, and rejected by the ones who said they once loved me, my own blood spews me out of their mouth like a poison, they express their true hatred for me, they cures my name and turned their backs upon me. Only to turn around to stab me in mine or to rub in what I could never have.   I sit in the corner, I cry out for love, I screaming out for acceptance, but yet I’m still alone, my curiosity has the best of me, to see if my efforts were all in vain or maybe I was never meant to have such things. Still foolishly I still try, disappointed and rejected.

Immortal Now      A breeze blows past,   rippling beads of sweat on his tired brow   ensconced there in protest   of the great heat of   this final summer’s assault      The writer diverts from dark thoughts,   muses on the breeze,   its source   and the joyful interpretation obvious   on the laughing girl sitting   adjacent and unaware      Her laugh is the key, he thinks   and notes accordingly,   and her name shall be Selene,   a yogini    universally loved      He pauses then and closes his eyes   savours the caress of another breeze,   respite from the exhausting heat—   I used to love the heat, worship it   but now I wish for escape    to a lesser extreme,   to comfort      She—now Selene—squeals again,   personification of the now;   I like that, he thinks,   personification of the now…      Brush strokes then,   some broad like house paint   others   a creation of a single strand;   the tiniest of points, the most valued of insight      Pages fill as Selene is born,   placenta-specks of graphite and eraser dust covering the table   like leavings, echoes of creation      Somehow, unnoticed—ironic, he thinks—   the girl   (Selene’s mother or Selene herself?)   exits the scene,   leaving only the ailing writer   aging quickly   perched on the precipice of  two new stories;   but it is the story of Selene   now immortal—you’re welcome, he quips—   that consumes him now      Another breeze touches him then   cools him, unnoticed   as he writes into the afternoon, evening   and infinity
20090205053439AAx11eN	Arts & Humanities;Books & Authors	2 books I can't remember the titles for...?	So, for the life of me, I cannot remember the title of these two books. They're both AMAZING books in my opinion and it bugs the heck out of me that I can't remember the title to them.      Anyways, the first one takes place during the Great Depression, and it's basically about a girl who's father kills himself and she has to go to live with her aunt, where ever that is. She decides to basically become a "hobo" type person, and rides the rails with a guy she meets. The whole time she's pretending to be a guy though.    I hope that's enough description for it.      And the second book, it's about a kid who's father (I think) finds an egg of some sort, and the kid basically hatches the egg. It turns out to be some sort of raptor thing, and the mother is looking for it. Along the way, he has a dog and a girl with him to help him return the baby to it's home and parents, and of course a man is hunting them to get the baby to sell it like a zoo or something.   That's the best I can describe it. Gah.      So yeah, please, please, please get me the title to these books. Thanks in advance.

20090205064415AAQQnIz	Arts & Humanities;Philosophy	Was this on purpose...?	I attend a music school. The girl in question and I have perfect pitch. Ever since I attended the school, people have always compared us (she was there first). However, everyone always talked about how I'm such "a great pianist". I never did anything to fuel these conversations, I simply practice and perform at concerts. Once, I had to perform at a concert before she played her instrument, and she rolled her eyes before taking the stage.      The girl, usually and quite often, treated me cold the whole time. One semester, we were both taking a composition course and the girl asked me to play the piano part to one of her pieces. I was surprised, but I thought that she had simply decided to be friendly. I agreed to play.      She gave me the score and it contained lots of sixteenth notes and grace notes that do not lie under the fingers well (she was not a pianist). I asked her about the tempo of the piece and she said that it was very slow and that I didn't have to worry. Because we were using many of the same instrumentalists, she also requested that we hold our practice at the same time and take turns working on each of our pieces. I agreed to this also.      During the rehearsal, she started out conducting at a breakneck speed. I noticed that all of the other instrumentalists had whole notes and I was the only one with faster notes. (The saxophonist had a few triplets for about four measures, but he had his part for about three months because he was her boyfriend.) I could barely keep up, and I'm usually a competent pianist. Every time that I would make a mistake, she would look at me with an evil look and then look at her friends with a smirk. She then began to conduct even faster, almost to the point where it fell apart. She would call out every note that I missed (as if she had perfect pitch and I didn't - we BOTH do.) Her presence and her attitude made me so nervous that I missed even more notes because she stood extremely close to me and look over my shoulder as I practiced and announced my mistakes before taking her score away. In addition, she used up all of the rehearsal time, which she said that we would share, so that none of the instrumentalists had time to practice my piece.      Afterward, she sneaked and told the teacher of the class that I did not do well in rehearsal and that she couldn't use me as a pianist. On top of that, she boldly stood in the practice room and called out every note that I missed and then asked for her piece back.      As a competent musician, I have never been through such an ordeal. What do you think that she was trying to prove by making me appear to be incompetent?  Was it on purpose or an accident?      Additional Details:   (By the way, I think that she might be a little "unstable" in her perfect pitch abilities because I often notice her humming flatly and then playing a note on the piano to get into "tune" for that day. People with perfect pitch usually don't have to do that.)      I don't know... she could be faking the whole "perfect pitch" thing... but I haven't told anyone that; it's her business!

Unlike some of his others such as 'One For The Road' and 'Mountain Language' where his point of suppression and torture being a world wide problem and that it could happen or be happening here in Britain, his meaning behind 'The Homecoming' isn't as clear...    I persoanlly feel that Pinter is striping humanity down to basics and that is why many critics see animalistic qualitites within the characters of the play. He has just exagerated to make it more shocking and eye-opening for the reader/audience.    I really wish to hear other peoples theories :D    Thanks xx

How did the classics write    such beautiful pages    when the muse their words    were written for    was not nearly as beautiful,    shining, passionate, promising, or strong    as you?    What luck (if it is such) do I    deserve to live and be called your    Love, and have you desire me to    call you Mine forever?    My heart is overflowing, full of    so much yearning for you (even    though you let me call you Mine)    so full of love sometimes it seems    to hurt.    How can such a dream as true    love be the root of any discomfort?    A question arises: Why are we allowed    to have what we have together?    Why did you choose me? We are    so fit for eachother.    It's a sigh of relief, assurance, happiness,    fullness I breathe when I pause    to clear my mind of everything but you.    I am always sighing. It is wonderful.

20090205060033AA3Dy6K	Arts & Humanities;Books & Authors	What's the name of this poem?	This morning I woke up reciting a poem I have never heard in my life. I don't remember the words the story behind it stays in my head. There was a conflict between two men. One man had a weapon, a knife I think. He kept threatening the other man with it. Basically saying don't come closer or I'm going to kill you. But the other guy didn't hesitate. He kept getting closer. The guy with the knife kept backing up. Asking himself if he had what it took to kill a man. When he backed up to the wall he called out for a nurse. At this point the story ends. I'm not sure if he called the nurse for himself or if he called it for the other guy because the poem leaves you guessing. Was he able to kill that man? Or did he call the nurse for himself because he knew he could not kill the man and therefor had unwillingly forfeit his life? I'm hoping someone out there can tell me the name of this poem or if it even is a real poem or if I'm just crazy. Thanks for your time.

I'm mostly black by the way and I must admit I feel uncomfortable with the amount of posts attacking us.      In response to some posts I've read I'd just like to say that I do have a job, I don't constantly whine about slavery or use the race card and I don't give a damn that Thatcher called someone a Golly wog. I'm not the one who fired her and I doubbt it was a black person who did so please don't insult us.      I have plenty of white friends and i'd hate to think this is how they truly feel about my race.Why can't we just live and let live. I know the PC brigade are rife at the moment but if you don't feel something is offensive then go ahead and say it. In fact it is more insulting when you feel someone is watching what they say around you. Teach your kids bah bah black sheep. it doesn't bother me. In fact that was my fave nursery rhyme as a child (along with Mary, Mary) :)

20090205071442AA9mnOp	Arts & Humanities;History	Is this a Coincidence?	History Mystery         Have a history teacher explain this----- if they can.                Abraham Lincoln was elected to Congress in 1846.   John F. Kennedy was elected to Congress in 1946.      Abraham Lincoln was elected President in 1860.   John F. Kennedy was elected President in 1960.      Both were particularly concerned with civil rights.   Both wives lost their children while living in the White House.      Both Presidents were shot on a Friday.   Both Presidents were shot in the head      Now it gets really weird.      Lincoln 's secretary was named Kennedy.   Kennedy's Secretary was named Lincoln .      Both were assassinated by Southerners.   Both were succeeded by Southerners named Johnson.      Andrew Johnson, who succeeded Lincoln, was born in 1808.   Lyndon Johnson, who succeeded Kennedy, was born in 1908.               John Wilkes Booth, who assassinated Lincoln, was born in 1839.       Lee Harvey Oswald, who assassinated Kennedy, was born in 1939.                   Both assassins were known by their three names.   Both names are composed of fifteen letters.      Now hang on to your seat.      Lincoln was shot at the theater named 'Ford'.   Kennedy was shot in a car called ' Lincoln ' made by 'Ford'.      Lincoln was shot in a theater and his assassin ran and hid in a warehouse.   Kennedy was shot from a warehouse and his assassin ran and hid in a theater.      Booth and Oswald were assassinated before their trials.      And here's the kicker...      A week before Lincoln was shot, he was in Monroe , Maryland   A week before Kennedy was shot, he was with Marilyn Monroe.      If you fold an american 20 dollar bill in a certain way on one side you see a picture of the Pentagon Burning, and a picture of the twin towers falling on the other side, and if you fold it a certain way OSAMA is spelt out.... WEIRD!!!!!       Is this all a coincidence or a Hidden conspiracy? Seems too Ironic..

They both rand down the hill to fetch you a pail of water. Why Him is over She when She & Him is your life.      Drink from it's long river. Love in me as its source. Sentimental waves say their goodbyes. And your heart cries out for its long lost lover. Dreams of this candy land have faded away.

This star can move under its own power and they are having it investigate a black hole.  the end of the story was unusual.  the star starts dying as it gets closer to the black hole; in fact it starts screaming!  since time slows down the closer you get to the event horizon, the person with the mental link to the star has to listen to it die for the rest of his/her life and eventually goes insane!

Stanzas For Music   By Lord Byron      There be none of Beauty's daughters   With music like thee;   And like music on the waters   Is they sweet voice to me:   When, as if its sound were causing   The charmed ocean's pausing,   The waves lie still and gleaming,   And the lull'd winds seem dreaming.      And the midnight moon is weaving   Her bright chain o'er the deep;   Whose breast is gently heaving,   As an infant's asleep:   So the spirit bows before thee,   To listen and adore thee;   With a full but soft emotion,   Like the swell of a Summer's ocean.

Skandranon, the black gryphon accidentally swallows one if I read correctly. Could someone explain to me how this pearl-looking weapon works that Skandranon is holding on the book cover?      2) The book makes it sound like the makaar are an evil breed of gryphons. Are they a corrupted form of griffins or are they a different species?      Thanks.

I know we all get attached to characters and there is a certain desire to want to know what happens to them after the book ends.

Thoughts?

Catching my reflection in bits of  Shattered dew,   Thinking how funny my thousand eyes  Shone  And how sad it was that they saw...  How horribly, greedily, they drank in the  Poison of  Sight.    Catching my reflection and watching it   Beat veined wings  Against the crystal threads of my home,   My anger,   Spun from my body and sticky with  Millions of years  Of feeling nothing  As soft eyes closed...    What day was it when the first dry  Wings fell to the ground, betraying me  To the trusting things as  Predator...    What day was it when the butterflies,   The kind, lovely beings, ceased their  Visits, and  Cursed my  Sight...    If, by spinning, I could empty   My belly of anger,   I would web the stars...  Then stalk the highest corners of  Eternity...  Crawling on my belly into  The House of God.

The hushed whisper of a wounded sound,   The quiet strength of it's radiant glow.      The pale skin on narrow shoulders,   That fell against the covered branch.   An ounce amity, to shift the boulders,   To turn the fear of a frozen blanch.      Skin and blood, across damp earth,   Will grip the hold of fine, new dirt.   In the snow she ran from birth,   To cradle the sorrow of her childhood hurt.      Cold, black eyes that drank clean blood,   Marble lips of invisible words.   Her closed fingers that sealed the bud,   And the deepened cry of feathered birds.      She walked away, over the layers of ice,   Draped across the blood soaked floor.   His woman's soul that bore no price,   As he left her to bleed upon the moor.

I hate just saying something, so you probably don't understand it.       Simmering in the bushes,   you whispered bitter charity in my ear,   two baleful circles shining    your face drawing near.    Recoiling to a shell   and your head sighed back.   Abruptly you haltered my jitter,   you’d had enough with this track.   Rising, I felt you rise away from me,   On my knees I beg, apologise, plead.   The curve or your hunched back   half clench knees, motion paused,   Standing, waiting. I submitted to the cause   of hope you’d love me.    You lost yourself into the gasps,   whilst I stared at your crumpled face.   I lost myself that night, I lost my grasp.

Here Rosenwald gives his first appeal to pathos. This crisis was now within our homes, even more then it had been in previous years. The author is trying to appeal to Americans values, and one can assume that most if not all people value their health, so to here that obesity is going up is an eye opener to people.

I didn't even like them all; I'm sure they'd all agree. Yet i would give my life for them,i know some did for me.-----So bury me withSailors please, though much maligned they be. Yes bury me with Sailors,for i miss their company.-------We'll not soon see their likes again; We've had our fill of war. But bury me with men like them till someone else does more"

20090205083141AAUhpaW	Arts & Humanities;Books & Authors	It was predicted that I would die today, what should I do?	am an editor of a highbrow literary magazine and chairman of the management cofnmittee of one of the biggest local literary clubs, known by its abbreviation as massolit. I had a talk in  a park with one of our writes, Ivan Bezdomny (it's not his real name, it's a pseudonym). He was commissioned to write a long anti-religious poem for one of the regular issues of his magazine. He got it all wrong -he has talent, Bezdomny does, but he approached the subject from a wrong point of view. I talked to him about the famous Philo of Alexandria and the brilliantly educated Josephus Flavius, and a passage in Chapter 44 of the fifteenth book of Tacitus' Annals. It was a novelty to him, and he listened, and, hopefully, understood what was wanted. While we talked, a man came up to us - a foreigner, he wore an expensive grey suit and foreign shoes, a beret and spoke with an accent. He said that he overheard our conversation - and was happy to hear that we were atheists. Then he started rambling about deep issues, like if there is no God, who, then, rules the life of man and keeps the world in order, suchlike things. Then he said that men do not, because they are mortal, and they die suddenly. Then he said that I would die today, my head would be cut off! I said that I had a meeting that evening, with the massolit, and he said, impossible, and rambled about some Anna who had already bought the sunflower-seed oil, and had already spilled it. I am not religious, and I am not superstitions, but the way he talked made an impression on me. What if he was somehow -  I don't know how - right? What if my destiny is to lose my head tonight? How can I prevent it, what should I do?

I Need to know if these questions are true or false. There are 50 questions. And I can't find 5 of them, please help me!      10.One of the advantages of digital photography is that images created cannot be manipulated or changed and will be saved permanently in an inalterable state.         25.Sir John Herschel discovered in 1819 that hyposulfite of soda was suitable as a fixing agent for sensitized paper images      30.The daguerreotype was reproducible and could be used to produce images intended for mass distribution.       34.The calotype's paper negative made possible the reproduction of photographic images.       43.The Calotype Method, also known as the "wet plate" technique, involved coating a glass plate with silver iodide in suspension, exposing it while still wet, and developing it immediately.
