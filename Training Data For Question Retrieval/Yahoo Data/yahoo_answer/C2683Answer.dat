Oestrus females also roll around  a lot and may crouch their front legs and lift their hindquarters and move their tail to one side as an invitation to be mounted.  Wanting to go outside could mean she can smell a tomcat in the area, so if she is not spayed you do not want to let her outdoors until she stops calling.  You also need to get her to a vet to have her spayed.<br>  <br>  If she is already spayed and you are in the northern hemisphere, it could be the effect of springtime making her more interested in being active.  But the fact she's even louder outdoors suggests she's calling for a mate and that he can smell a potential mate nearby.|`|AA11589437	She is probably in heat. Does she put her bum high and likes you to pet her on top of her tail? DON'T let her out, make an appointment with the vet to spay her.|`|KQPDtrw8aa	yes that's normal, she is in heat. If you get your cat spayed, which means a cat hysterectomy, she will not do that anymore. Which is also good to make sure you help control the pet population.|`|c60XUC11aa	She is in heat.  Unless you want kittens around, get her fixed or keep her inside at all times.

In the UK you can't buy it made up for horses but at the chemist you can buy the essence and then just mix that with water into a spray bottle. Some horses do react to it so the first time or two just use on a small area and Monitor. This works really well and is cheap.<br>  <br>  Also feed garlic. It sweetens the blood and reduces the number of bites. The keeping them in at dawn and dusk is good, also control any standing water as this is where they breed and an open pasture with no trees is good as if there is a breeze then the midges (the insect they react to) finds it harder to fly and so don't bite as much.
B6zl0AJDaa	Actually pumice stone will pull out the hairs if they are loose, but not trim them down like you're hoping for.  You may still have to use your clippers.<br>  <br>  BTW all the slick N Easy blocks are are grille blocks you can buy for 1/2 the price at a resturant supply store.  Then you use your shedding blade or a small saw blade to slice it into 1.5" thicknesses.|`|NOAwpvcTaa	Yes, Grooming Blocks are Awesome. I use them on my thoroughbred in the winter/spring when he sheds. I like to curry first so all the dirt and loose hair gets to the surface and then use the shedding block, after that I hard brush and soft brush and then spray some coat shine and it makes a huge differance, plus he's really soft after!|`|j45Q2ipRaa	Once you use it, you will love it.  The Slick N Easy will become part of your grooming kit all year long.  It not only helps get rid of the shedding hair, but dirt that is deep.

I use them on my mare every spring when she sheds out. They are great and last me all summer long. They are almost better than a curry comb. I say Yes.

eyZhiXYpaa	First of all, good for you that you are keeping your cat's injections up to date (tons of people don't where cats are concerned, unfortunately).<br>  <br>  It depends on your Vet but you should be looking around ￡15 - ￡20.<br>  <br>  Good for you responsible pet owner!!!!|`|4aAhEK9daa	He's at the vets now and you're asking US how much it will cost?  Um, wouldn't it make just a tad more sense to ASK THE VET?  Prices vary from country to country, city to city and even vet to vet.|`|DIihJrUiaa	I would check with your vet as it varies a lot dependent on your area and your practice. If you are having the full set of vaccines, including felv, then I would expect to pay around ￡40-50.
eyZhiXYpaa	Keep doing exactly what you are doing (just make sure the pup doesn't see you clean the poop up that he does in the house).<br>  <br>  Ignore the poop in the house (just clean it up quick when he can't watch you) and keep using your wee wee language whilst he is outside.<br>  <br>  Take him out around 10 mins after he has eaten (this is the time he will most likely want to poop) and WAIT.<br>  <br>  As soon as he does go (and he will eventually), MASSIVE PRAISE.<br>  <br>  Don't pick him up or cuddle him after he has done his wee (Ignore him) until he does his poop and then you can take him in.<br>  <br>  No matter how much he cries - he must learn that crying doesn't get him attention.<br>  <br>  It's really hard and time consuming at first but you'll get there.<br>  <br>  Good luck my friend!|`|pLv0Ejt9aa	My suggestion is, while you are outside with him and he is playing in the snow, clean a small area from the snow where you want him to poo. Then when you go in with him, go after him, pick him up and take outside again. put him down in that snowfree area and wait for him to do #2. Don not go inside until its done. Praise him a lot when he did.<br>  Read my article on house training a dog on my site under articles.|`|e2Pgwa6raa	watch your dog- they have a poop ritual. my dog turns 3 times in a circle before pooping. when you think he's going to poo, take him outside. if he does a #2 WAHOOmassive praise.|`|IARPr7k5aa	try kenneling him after you bring him in from peeing, then after like 10 or 20 minutes, take him out to poo, and then give him a treat.|`|NAGiNKFWaa	The bladder isn't grown until 6-months-old, they are not fully potty trained until 1-year-old.  Take him outside and use your commands, and wait for him to "go finish" He can't go potty in the house if you don't let him in.  Don't allow the play time until he does "go finish" just keep using the command.  It is likely that he needs a good 10 minutes between his pee and his poop, so hang in there.  I use a crate* to potty train with, but only for potty training and then I break it down and store it.  I put blankets and a small food and water dish in the crate.  Dogs don't potty where they eat and sleep.  When they are first little, I only expect them to hold their potty for 4 hours, and then 6 hours, then 8 hours and so on.  So when they are first little, I set a timer or alarm clock to wake myself up at night to take them *out.  I only allow my puppy in the bedroom* or the living room, only one room at a time.  They have to graduate to more space.  If I allow them to have full run of the house, it will overwhelm them.  I take them out the same door each time.  I tie a dinner bell to the door handle.  Do not use a jingle bell as they could get their toe caught in it.  So when they are little, I ring the bell for them, and then open the door to go *outside to potty.  When they get bigger, I take their paw and whack the bell and open the door to go potty.  Eventually getting to the place where the puppy will ring the bell and let me know when they need to go potty.  Dogs want to please you, so it is your job to let them know what behaviors please you and what doesn't.  So when my puppy goes potty, I give her a treat*, and clap, and make a fuss and praise her.  So she learns that going potty outside makes me happy.  If she has an accident, make a disgust sound like “tsst” and take her out right away.  I never yell* or spank* my puppies.  Take them out when they first wake up, after they eat or drink, before nap, finish romping, when their activities change, or when they are sniffing around. Some puppies go pee right away, but may not go poop until 10 minutes later, so wait for the poop.  I have a little play time here, because sometimes I think they are done, and they are not.  Puppies train at their own pace.  While I may have a puppy that hasn't had an accident in several weeks, I don't let my guard down.  I don't expect my puppies to be "fully potty trained" until one-year-old.  If they have a setback, shake it off, and start over.  I only have my puppies in the crate when I am not watching them.  When I am sleeping, cooking, ironing, doing chores, basically when I am not watching her.  All other times, she is out of the crate practicing being a "big girl."  This is the time I train her how to behave in the house.  So we are practicing "no barking", 'no biting", "no jumping", and "don't eat the furniture."  I also have to practice "playing inside" so she doesn't knock over things.  You must keep the puppy in sight when they are little because they don’t know the difference between newspaper and carpet, and you don’t want them sneaking off and getting into trouble.   Some puppies can sleep through the night around 3-months-old, but their bladder is grown around 6-months-old.<br>   <br>  REVISIONS: <br>  *I use a CRATE to train with.  It is the method I prefer, compared to other methods I have tried.  I noticed that if they are in the crate, while I am doing chores, they are o.k., because the crate allows them to see me and be re-assured.  The crate can also be a comfort when stored in the basement for dogs who live in areas where thunderstorms and tornados are an issue. .  However, use the method that works best for you.....a laundry basket, a cardboard box, a woof-woof house, x-pen, child gates, whatever works for you.<br>  *OUTSIDE, pee pad, litter box, whichever method you are using.   When the puppy is first little, keep the pee pad, litter box near the food and water dish, so the puppy can eat and drink, and then go potty.  You can move it away as they get older.  The pee pad has a scent that smells and initiates potty.  Sometimes a pee pad makes a sound that scares some puppies, so you might want to use a litter box if that happens.  The pee pad allows a puppy to walk around, but a litter box keeps the puppy in one place. <br>  *BEDROOMS, I use the bedroom and living room for training, because it works for me.  Choose rooms that work for you, but watch for rooms that are damp, or drafty.  While my puppies sleep in the bedroom during training, once they are trained, I let them sleep where they want to.  They don't have to sleep in the bedroom forever.<br>  *TREATS.  While I use treats for training, you don't have to.  I like Charlee Bears for training (a little cracker for a little mouth,) I use them for training, but once they are trained, I cut back on them. <br>  *SOME PUPPIES will go potty in the same spot each time.  Some puppies have to be told to go potty.  A command like "go out" for pee, or "go finish" for poop, might work for you, keep saying “go finish” until the puppy poops.  This is a good thing to train if you travel with your dogs.  By using commands, the puppy won't get confused when you are visiting someone, on vacation with you, or when you get to a new home.  The command will tell them what you want them to do in an unfamiliar place.  You might also want to use a leash method, so the puppy doesn’t sneak off, or for strange places.<br>  *YELLING.  It is not a good idea to "yell" or "spank" your puppy and then take them outside when they have an accident.  They may get confused and think that going outside is punishment.  While you want to correct them, if you are extreme, they may not want to go outside again.  Shake it off, and resume your schedule.  You have to keep it real.  Puppies train at their own pace, but a puppy can only hold their potty for a few hours.  A guide would be 1 hour for each month of age, plus 1 hour, so a three-month-old puppy should only be expected to hold their potty for 4 hours at most.    <br>  SOURCE:  These tips, tricks, and ideas were contributed from many brilliant minds.  Thanks for your help!|`|rDLTnjRyaa	In a case like that, you should get the dog set up so you can put it outside for a few minutes to do his business. Get a tie-out for the dog. Find a place that you can secure it to, attach the other end to the dog, and go back inside. Ignore the dog for a few minutes but keep an eye on it to see what it is doing. Once the dog has had its fun playing in the snow, he will finish his business out there. Once he is finished, then bring him inside. He shouldn't poop once he is brought back indoors. Some dogs won't finish their business if their owners are watching them. Once your dog sees that you aren't out there with him, he will probably whine and stuff and try to get your attention, but don't give in to him. Give him the amount of time it takes for him to go poop and praise him when he does. Hopefully this helps.

8cikAYp3aa	when the crupper is on your horse with the saddle in the correct place, you want two fingers to fit between horse and strap.  It shouldn't be tight or it will cause rubs, nor so loose that it touches her anus  which will make her buck.. For trail riding I avoid cruppers altogeather and use a breeching strap.  It is much more comfortable for the horse when crawling up and down hills.|`|XJ9oSR2daa	Always fasten the crupper lastly when you tack up.  You don't want the horse moving off and the only thing attached is the crupper.<br>  <br>  For tightness, it just depends.  For me, I adjust where I want it then pickup the long piece down the croup and I want it to not move less than an inch up off the croup.  I have one mule that its tighter than that on due to the fact he can't handle things moving up on his shoulders.|`|UIM8X38Oaa	I agree with both answers above,  they know what they are talking about.  We always put the crupper on after we have fastened the girth.  They got the fitting things down to.<br>  <br>  But be sure you lounge the horse with it on first if she is not familiar with one.  If she is going to buck or kick at it which alot of them do it is better to see whats going to happen on the ground first. :)<br>  Happy Trails.<br>  <br>  Good Question,<br>  Thanks,<br>  Jenny
TwxOY5zCaa	Here is some information on moving house with a cat and on how to settle a cat into the new house.<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.messybeast.com/moving.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.messybeast.com/moving.htm</a><br>  <br>  For the first 3 weeks (minimum) you must lock the cat door so he can't escape.  You must also make sure he is microchipped and the chip is registered (or if he's already chipped, make sure the change of address is registered).  Don't even think of taking him out on a harness until he is settled in the new home, even if that is more than the 3 weeks (3 weeks is the minimum period recommended by cat rehoming groups).  When he is allowed out on his own, make sure he has a collar and address tag (even if he has a microchip) in case he gets disoriented and neighbours think he's a stray.<br>  <br>  For indoor entertainment you need things such as a scratching post or climbing tree with at least one perch.  Viewing places such as window sills and shelves, but you must make sure the windows are not left open (or you have mesh guards to stop him forcing his way out through a cracked open window).  Fishing-rod toys and balls are recommended and he'll need at least 2 interactive play sessions daily (each one of 20 mins minimum).  Clockwork mice, catnip mice and jingle-balls are good, but change them round every few days so he doesn't get bored.<br>  <br>  A puzzle feeder is is also good - something he must roll along in order for cat biscuits to drop out of it.  Crackle sacks or big paper bags to climb into are good.  Some people like to get DVDs of wildlife as well.  Remember that cats live their lives in all 3 dimensions, upwards as well as floor level, so he definitely needs places he can climb onto.|`|fac19b1dbb2ff2df17b3984f0bd6c4b3aa	You can get lots of playthings for cats from any good pet stores.|`|4aAhEK9daa	Cat door is a VERY bad idea.  Though he might find his way back home he can't if he's DEAD.  If you let him roam loose he could end up hit by a car, dismembered by a loose dog, poisoned, catching a disease from other cats.  Why not keep him indoors where he belongs?  <a href="http://www.littlebigcat.com/index.php?action=library&act=show&item=indoorsoroutdoors" rel="nofollow">http://www.littlebigcat.com/index.php?ac...</a><br>  <br>  Put a birdfeeder outside a window that he can sit in.  Then he'll be entertained by visiting birds but not killing them like cats allowed to free roam tend to do for sport.<br>  <br>  Buy toys that you can wave and he can chase.  Toys with a pole, string and lure on the end.  Cats love toys that move and that they can grab, bite and attack.|`|UNFxjNHkaa	keep him inside!  Its healthier for him and he'll live much longer.  Cats do just fine when they're indoors as long as they have something to entertain them.  Get him lots of toys and a scratching post and he'll be good.
XB0UpJsLaa	I usually get on from the ground. My horse is only 15.3h so it's pretty easy. Or sometimes i will use the mounting block if I'm in english. I agree with you about the leg up!

aCqSF87Raa	BSL doesn't address the issue of WHY certain dogs attack. It just places the blame on an entire breed (whichever seems to be most popular at the time) and ignores the fact that MANY dog bite cases stem from the owner's ignorance. <br>  <br>  It will be interesting to see the higher ups of any particular county scratch their heads when dog bite cases don't diminish after banning every single "vicious dog breed." They'll have to move on to ban other dogs - like Labs or Golden Retrievers - when ignorant or irresponsible people begin to buy THOSE dogs. Maybe when THAT happens they'll pull their heads out of their butts?|`|tnTxHVO5aa	I think the person that answered your Q was ignorant.  That is the problem.  There are was too many people that think like that.  That is why BSL is an issue at all.|`|uKOYK1Lvaa	People like that sit there and that hate other breeds, and support BSL....right up until BSL begins to ban their breed.

j45Q2ipRaa	Don't worry too much about the cat.  They will handle themselves and is doing so with the howling, hissing and growling.  <br>  <br>  To the dog, this is a game (usually) not wanting to hurt the cat, but play and in this game, the cat wants no part of it.<br>  <br>  Time to train the dog that is isn't acceptable.  When he starts to go after the cat, say no, out or what ever command he has been taught to stop an unwanted behavior.  If he doesn't have one, now is the time to start. Find a trainer that can help you.<br>  <br>  We have 3 dogs and 3 cats.  We only had one that even wanted to chase the one of the cats.  Funny as it may seem, it is the one cat who growls, hisses and howls.  She would get in that cats face, stand there and then leave.  The other dogs never bothered any of the cats.  We told the one that pestered the one cat, out and after a few times, they are living fine together as she has learned that this is not an acceptable game.  They now eat out of their respective bowls in the same room without an incident.<br>  <br>  Good Luck.|`|eyZhiXYpaa	You need to train the dog that it is wrong for him to do this (i.e. not acceptable in human eyes). Don't forget that this will be hard to train into the dog as it is part of nature that dogs chase cats, fact.<br>  <br>  I wouldn't worry too much about the cat - believe me, cats are more independent than dogs and can usually look after themselves in these types of situations. The dog will be the one that comes out with a nasty scratch if he goes too overboard with the cat.<br>  <br>  Just make sure you grab his collar and state NO, everytime he goes for the cat.<br>  <br>  You could also try the water mister spray and give him a squirt when he goes for her - dogs hate this.  Also say NO when squirting.<br>  <br>  Good luck.|`|e2Pgwa6raa	my dog does that. he chases cats, but will leave them alone. theres nothing you can really do I'm afraid, just keep them apart.|`|5f6fbccb8643408cbd62a8431b3e5c44aa	Some behavior training with a licensed trainer.

MfcTIdlraa	If Cleo is less than 10 years, he'll get over it.  His nose is "bent out of joint, that's all.  That happened to me a while back.  Cleo will probably come around in a couple of weeks.<br>  He is used to being the only kid on the block, and now he has to share your affection with the new kid.  Be sure you don't over do on the little one.<br>  Ceo is still the big chief on the totem pole, and he deserves the respect due him.<br>  Love both of them equally.|`|4aAhEK9daa	Well if you were doing it the RIGHT way it would take a lot less time.<br>  <br>  Cats should NEVER be just tossed together.  Cats are territorial and it's totally normal for the existing cat to act defensively to the "intruder".  Your cat isn't being moody.  How would you feel if your parents brought in another child without any sort of warning and told you it would have to share everything of yours?<br>  <br>  Put the new kitten in a room with its own food, water and litter box - a bedroom or bathroom would be best. Keep the new kitten completely separated from the existing cat for at least a few days - a week may be needed since you didn't do this right from the start. Put an old tshirt with the new kitten to get its scent on it, then give this shirt to the existing cat and then back again. This way they'll get used to eachother's scent. <br>  <br>  The WORST thing to do is to just plunk a cat down in the middle of a room with access to the entire home. Being in a new home is overwhelming and can be quite scary for most cats. So let him get slowly used to your one room and THEN once BOTH animals are relaxed THEN let the kitten explore the rest of your home and interact with the existing cat. <br>  <br>  I sure hope you had this new kitten checked out by a vet before you allowed it to interact with your cat.  If it came from a shelter it's most likely already going to have been tested for Feline Leukemia - a deadly and incurable disease. If this is not the case then this test is a MUST as FeLv is contagious among cats.  If you didn't and this cat is FeLv positive it may already be too late - your cat may be infected as well.|`|DIihJrUiaa	It took my eldest cat a few weeks to get used to things both times we have brought a new kitten into the house, but they did get there when left to their own devices. It's good to ensure they have a bed each, a food dish each, and at least a litter tray each so they have choice and hopefully that will help Cleo to feel less like her territory is being invaded. I also recommend getting a Feliway plug in for the house.|`|fac19b1dbb2ff2df17b3984f0bd6c4b3aa	If she is anything like mine then probably never as she cats are very territorial and will quickly establish a pecking order and make sure hate youngster understand as well!!!My elderly persian ins 24 years old the other 2 are 7 and 9 and she like a lot of she cats prefers her own company....however if you had got another cat the same time as her this maybe would be different but cats are like humans so maybe they will get along and maybe they wont but each will have their own territory within the house you will find.|`|C7DOTjhqaa	It will probably just depend on their individual personalities.  Some cats just never get along, but it sounds like your two are doing very well if they're actually sleeping right next to each other already!<br>  <br>  You don't say how old Cleo is, but if she's a lot older than Cosmo, she probably will have limited patience for all that kitten nonsense.  As he gets older, they will probably be just fine.  (Or he may start to bring out her inner kitten after a few weeks!)<br>  <br>  I've had two personal experiences with introducing a new cat to an older cat, and they were both dramatically different.  The first was a one-year-old spayed female who was paired with a neutered male kitten.  With those two, the female HATED the male throughout their entire lives together, and never learned to peacefully coexist.  She was especially sensitive, though, and we chalked it up to that.<br>  <br>  The second experience was a 14-year-old spayed female (not the same one as above) introduced to a spayed female kitten.  They figured out how to get along after a month or so, but they were never what I'd call great buddies.  I think it's different with every pair you try to match up, and the cats that get along best are ones who grow up from kittenhood together.<br>  <br>  Just give it time, I guess, and see what develops.  Sounds like they're doing great, just be patient!<br>  <br>  Good luck!<br>  <br>  P.S.  Percy-and-Penny, are you this arrogant when you "hand out this advice to adopters all the time," or do you save it special for Y!A?|`|Xr5bU3t1aa	Every cat is different.  I have 7 cats ages from 10 down to 2 yrs old.  When I do fostering of kittens, I never do a introduction...I just let the kittens out, and sooner or later, all my cats tolerate or love the kittens.  I have a few feral cats that go and hide for a few days, but after a two week period, they are just fine with the new kittens.  Cleo sounds to be doing just fine with the new kitten... hissing and swatting is all part of the "I'm boss" game they play with newcomers.  I'm sure in another 2-3 week, they'll be best of friends.....|`|pU9Rd1vIaa	Sometimes cat never get used to each other. One of my cats died last year and in the 3 years we had my other cat, they never got along. But usually it will take at least a month for your cats to get used to each other. Just give it time and the older cat will get used to having another cat in it's space. :D
fVF5IdDvaa	Yes it would be cool to have a pet hedgehog, but hedgehogs are wild animals and are not supposed to be kept as pets.  They also carry fleas and other nasties which you wouldn't want in your house and I've not seen any de-fleaing spray for hedgehogs in my local Petsmart!  <br>  <br>  If you find an injured one or rescue one from the road you are supposed to take it to the RSPCA otherwise they should be left alone.<br>  <br>  Your best bet is to leave some dog food out in the night to attract a wild one and observe it through the window.  Don't leave milk out as apparently it as it makes them ill.|`|f1lpdiNEaa	No it is not alright to take a baby hedgehog from the wild - which you already know by the sounds of it! <br>  <br>  I've never heard of anywhere selling them as pets and I used to be a veterinary nurse and only ever encountered wild ones. Hedgehogs are not suitable pets, they belong in the wild where they are much happier than being being cooped up in a cage. They also carry lots of ticks and lice, so not something you would want to have in your home. <br>  <br>  Why not get involved volunteering with a wildlife rescue centre in your area and look after them that way.|`|0bPQsqK3aa	We have a "pet" hedgehog but he found us not the other way round. You can't take a hedgehog from the wild. We have a hedgehog box in the garden and put out cat food every night and he comes and goes as he pleases. This is as far as you can go. If a hedgehog comes along and takes a fancy to your box then great,  if not maybe you should think about getting a rabbit or a guinea pig instead.|`|pkCW6nHuaa	NEVER EVER EVER EVER EVER TAKE A WILD ANIMAL FROM IT'S NATURAL HABITAT! It would be cruel, and the hedgehog would most likely die. They have at many pet stores, the one I go to has one in, but you probably don't live anywhere near me! Pet stores will often let you order one in so you can come pick it up when it is delivered to the store.|`|rEFMUCnZaa	Hedgehogs are wild animals and should not be pets. They can carry diseases that can go to you of other pets. Wild animals when taken from their natural habitat can become mean and dangerous. there was a circus tiger that they had for a long time and one day it killed its keeper.<br>  <br>                                     :-(|`|DFWvjolMaa	This is a controversial subject. Hedgehogs are considered by some as wild creatures who should not be kept in a domesticated environment. On the other hand, all pets come to us this way.<br>  <br>  However, you should not take a wild hedgehog in as a pet. This would be extremely cruel to both the baby and its mother who may be out looking for it. You would not be able to simulate its natural habitat easily, etc. They also carry many parasites.<br>  <br>  The domesticated hedgehogs which you may have seen are not the same as the species we have wild in the UK and they have been bred in captivity. The most common of these being the African Pygmy, but Long-Eared hedgehogs are popular, too.<br>  <br>  Obviously, if you do want one of these, you're going to have to search hard for a breeder. These do not just pop up in Pets At Home. <br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.hedgehogkingdom.co.uk/index.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.hedgehogkingdom.co.uk/index.h...</a><br>  <br>  I would contact the above breeder, who are situated just outside of London. They appear reputable, but do some research so as you know what to ask them when you do contact them. They do not list prices online and I expect that as with any breeder, they work on a case by case basis.<br>  <br>  There is also a good care sheet on the page, I note, with a list of what you will require to keep them. Any good breeder will do a home check to make sure you will be keeping the animal well, so please do not lie to them.<br>  <br>  Either way, this is not a cheap pet!|`|evkp2syTaa	Hedgehogs are not domestic pets.<br>  Forget it and choose something else.|`|g7M1DxFCaa	Maybe from an animal rescue centre?  Unlikely though.  I've never had one as a pet, I don't know if you really can or not, how'd it'd be for them.  I've rescued a few out of the middle of roads though, they're not easy to pick up.  Don't get one from the wild as they're now an endangered species and you'd be further depleting their numbers plus it may be illegal.  If you see one in your garden you can feed it (catfood and milk is good) and it'll keep coming back but will still be free.<br>  <br>  Edit:  Leopardshaz - THERE'S NO NEED TO SHOUT!<br>  <br>  Edit:  Ok, it appears that milk may not be good but dog/catfood and water should be good for them.  Don't leave it out if there's no hedgehogs about because you'll just get rats instead.|`|jyGTlpzTaa	No, it is cruel to take a baby hoglet from its mother, it will never become properly tame, and your house will be overrun with fleas. Common British hedgehogs actually get very large at maturity (sadly you never see this because most die before full maturity) and as such cannot be kept as pets, plus the stress of being tamed will probably kill them.<br>  <br>  An African Pygmy Hedgehog will cost you ￡150 at the absolute minimum in the UK, because they are difficult to breed and have small litters. If you cant afford to pay this, how do you expect to buy a suitable cage and toys, a heat mat and all the food, and most importantly vets bills when they come up?<br>  <br>  If you cant afford the vet, you cant afford the pet.<br>  To be honest I think the best thing you can do is donate or go help at Tiggywinkles or another wildlife rehab place, it sounds like an African pygmy hedgehog is out of your budget.<br>  <br>  Edit: No dog food or milk for hedgehogs...you can buy hedgehog food now, or cat food does the same job. Dog food is not high enough in protein and is too fatty.|`|oCJVZ1WCaa	Hello. :)<br>  Under NO circumstances should you go into the garden or whatever and capture it and keep it - they are wild...

If you want a rodent why dont you try a guinea pig? They are soft, friendly, eat a variety of fruits and veggies, trainable, shy at first but come around with love and attention. They are already domesticated and I'm sure there is a guinea pig rescue in your area. Please buy a rescue and save an animal from being put down.

He needs to be closely monitored by the vet & I would say he needs a follow up wellness checkup. Sometimes Parvo needs a second round of treatments. If the home was not disinfected to the hilt he could of contracted it again, this includes toys, the carpet, rugs, blankets, couch....anything that might of come in contact with the dog while ill. The vet can tell you how to take care of this. I hope you take him back in I think he may need it.|`|eyZhiXYpaa	Hi, as I am sure your Vet has told you (hopefully) - There is NO CURE for Parvo (sorry if you were not told about this).<br>  <br>  A dog with Parvo needs to constantly be treated for dehydration (which is what the animal with Parvo usually dies from).  If you dog is surviving Parvo there is a good chance it could get it again.<br>  <br>  This is such a nasty virus but hang in there.  You just need to make sure that your dog gets as many fluids as possible.<br>  <br>  Sorry to say but this is a very serious illness, but with the right treatment it is recorded that up to 80% of puppies with this virus will live.  Dogs have a 50-50 percent chance of survival.<br>  <br>  Good luck - I hope I haven't upset you too much but I think it is always better to know.<br>  <br>  Obviously you will know what stage your dog is at better than I, I wish you all the luck in the world.|`|hgIyPPb3aa	Put a little bit of Cayenne in his dog food and time to heall
DFWvjolMaa	Don't take this the wrong way, but I notice you ask a lot of questions about your hamster. You seem to worry far too much about normal hamster traits. If you just want something to write about, fine; but to be totally honest, your hamster sounds like a completely normal and happy chap. Be glad that he lives longer than your other hamster, etc.<br>  <br>  As for this particular question, it's a natural thing for him to do. If you're worried your dog will eat him, don't allow your dog in the same room and close the door behind you. The hamster walks backwards because he doesn't want to come out, simple as that. I notice you also say that your hamster isn't as tame as he used to be, it's normal for any animal to slow down in their old age.<br>  <br>  Also, a lot of hamsters don't actually like balls. Some do, but for those who don't it's probably due to the fact that they can't see very well at all. <br>  <br>  When you pick your hamster up, try to pick him up by scooping him up with both hands. This is a far safer way to pick up most hamsters and is particularly good with dwarf species who are known to be harder to handle. Maybe it would be a good idea to give him a treat to calm him down when you first put your hand in the cage, this should make sure that he associates the hand you have presented him with as something good.<br>  <br>  Try to do basic taming activities with him again and start from scratch if he is particularly difficult. Put your hand in the cage and just leave it there (without moving it, or approaching him) and he'll adjust.<br>  <br>  And try just to handle him! The balls might seem a great way for them to get exercise, but hopefully he has a wheel for that. Just bond with bond with him.|`|5wVeLrXuaa	Ohhh just let the little guy walk backwards if he wants to! lmao|`|cd5ea88ea5b547ee2a3d5ceba4c5ce04aa	Is your hamster moonwalking?

Just put your hand behind him or get someone else to put their hand there to stop him or catch him if he does start to fall. If possible find another way to take him out the ball so he doesn't walk backwards|`|38B9AkVjaa	well there is nothing you can do to stop him walking backwards, your dogs shouldn't be in the same room anyway and when you are holding him you should have both hands round him so he can't walk|`|nuc5DBD8aa	Don't let your dogs near him?|`|rEFMUCnZaa	Oh just let him walk backwards just watch him so he doesn't fall off but hamsters are hardy and if not to far off the ground then the fall won't hurt as much.

5f6fbccb8643408cbd62a8431b3e5c44aa	Do not breed them....No need to. Just because you think having pups would be cute is not a very good reason to breed. Out of the welfare for these animals alone. If you don't have the fiances for emergency vet care that is another reason. If you don't know what you are doing and you get inbreeding you will have a huge mess of a problem and a load of hamsters everywhere. If you breed 2 females you will easily end up with at least 30 pups, and if they breed each set will have about 15 pups. So get out your calculator and think hard if you have the room to house that many hamsters let alone find them homes. They breed very quickly often enough people do not get them separated in time. Just not a good idea and I am sorry but I had to be honest.|`|FW0iLLKXaa	You don't sound smart enough to know any thing about breeding.

Or for other versions, just Google "dog breed quiz" and I'm sure you'll come up with others.<br>  <br>  Our family found the perfect breed for us (whippets) using a similar quiz.<br>  <br>  Also, don't forget that there are a lot of mixed breeds out there that need good homes!  Sometimes the best dogs are mixed breeds adopted from a shelter, so consider that as well!|`|7fb9ba045d96cd607bd916c4c659256caa	Schnauzers are the best Family dogs.|`|fac19b1dbb2ff2df17b3984f0bd6c4b3aa	A jack russel or a staffy.|`|j45Q2ipRaa	There are a lot of dogs that are good family dogs.  The majority of what makes them a good family dog is training.  That training is not only for the dog, but the family.  While labs and goldens are wonderful (have them myself) they can have challenges too when not trained.<br>  <br>  Look into breeds that you think you want and find out if the energy level, etc fits the needs of your house.  Once you think you know what you want, find a rescue that caters to that breed or go to any rescue to a dog that is looking for its forever home.  Purebreds and mixes all need to be loved and have a forever family.|`|i5MxtGENaa	i would have said golden retreiver or labrador lol but for a smalll dog maybe a daschund<br>  <br>  <a href="http://images.google.co.uk/images?gbv=2&hl=en&ei=poiiSdnLK-TIjAeZl-zGCw&sa=X&oi=spell&resnum=0&ct=result&cd=1&q=daschund&spell=1" rel="nofollow">http://images.google.co.uk/images?gbv=2&...</a><br>  <br>  or a westie<br>  <br>  <a href="http://images.google.co.uk/images?gbv=2&hl=en&q=westie" rel="nofollow">http://images.google.co.uk/images?gbv=2&...</a>|`|XKhNw221aa	German Shepard, or a Rottweiler.|`|owe7lyyYaa	Weimaraner, hands down. And the cutest. But they are FAMILY dogs, this means they will love their families more than life its self, but will not show strangers the same care. Often quite the oppostie. The exception to the rule: Children. They seem to like all children, and even tolerate the mean ones. The weim seems to understand that they are to be gentle with them. Very good protectors/theft deterrant. Oh wait...you said small......Then the Papillon.|`|KOwzDLPdaa	I have Spaniels are good for families as an intermediate sized dog.

If you are active and do lots of outdoor activities then a spaniel might be okay - but if you live a more sedentary lifestyle a spaniel will drive you bonkers because they need lots of stimulation. This is just an example - I suggest going to a rescue centre where they can re-home a dog whose temperament suits that of your lifestyle and family size. If you get a rescue dog you don't have to go through the chewing/toilet training phase you would with a puppy.<br>  <br>  If however you really want a purebreed pup, buy a book that describes the different temperaments and acticity levels of difefrent breeds.<br>  Good luck.|`|Fe258lHUaa	It really depends on the family.<br>  <br>  I suggest a ~PUG~<br>  We have two because we couldn't get enough of the first.<br>  Try watching this vid...|`|4sNStzPRaa	shih tzu's are nice, but so are pomeranians :D fluffy!!! ^^|`|e2Pgwa6raa	SPRINGER SPANIEL!!!<br>  fun dogs, brilliant off the lead.<br>  <br>  they don't run off too if you get the right one from the pack.|`|a3Gq5jxYaa	I think SLUMDOG ...hahahaha<br>  sorry i dont know

My friends dog ate a huge chocolate bar that was wrapped up under the Christmas tree (paper and everything) and just had the runs for a week.<br>  <br>  Try to keep chocolate out of the way though.|`|KOwzDLPdaa	Chocolate is bad for dogs but it would depend on the size of your dog, how much he lapped up and how much chocolate was really in the hot chocolate. My 2 year old German Shepherd got into my garbage can and ate 6 chocolate cupcakes! But because of her size she was okay, it would have made a smaller dog much more sick.|`|fac19b1dbb2ff2df17b3984f0bd6c4b3aa	As a one off yes fine,but chocolate isn't good for dogs as a rule and if you give a dog chocolate then make sure it is the one specifically for dogs.|`|qzPZf2XPaa	He'll be fine, such a small dose of milk chocolate powder may only cause diarrhea.<br>  If it was cocoa powder or dark chocolate powder, I'd be at the vet ASAP though.|`|Xb7CPz5naa	Your dog should be fine ! If he's small and he had quite a lot keep an eye on him to make sure he isn't acting wierd...If he's a big dog he should be fine...every one thinks chocolate is bad for dogs it isn't really unless it's in it's diet and your feeding him chocolate regulary. If I were you I wouldn't be worrying he'll be fine ! :)|`|8ey4ArjXaa	I would say that if he starts throwing up then take him to the vet immediately before anything gets worse.Otherwise he will be fine.
6FBpafUYaa	Is the bulb an Incandescent or a Fluorescent? if its an incandescent it will heat up pretty quick and raise the temperature of the water along with it. Not so much with the fluorescent. Also are there live plants in the tank? If so then you will need between 12 and 14 hours a day of light. If no live plants, about 10 hours is good and will keep your finned friend healthy.|`|fYupEegGaa	Between 6 and 12 hours of light each day.|`|QjKJdFhwaa	easy way to solve this is put the tank by a window so that the betta gets natural sunlight and grow heahty.|`|Yc6eUIW9aa	If it get light from daylight that is sufficient.  But if not, leave on the light for about four hours so it will be more active and swim more.  Some people leave their's on for eight hours.  Whatever you prefer.
uIaD4nkMaa	Honestly you can't unless you know someone to give you one.  You want a purebred, you have to pay for it.  The only free puppies you'll normally find are mutts.|`|5f6fbccb8643408cbd62a8431b3e5c44aa	No such thing as a free adoption I am so sorry but it's not going to happen. Please make sure you can afford medical care for the dog before you get one. They need a lot of vet care, vaccines and they have emergencies. Most vets don't take payments, mine require full payment at time of service.|`|aCqSF87Raa	If you don't have the money for a simple adoption fee, you won't have the money for it's general care. Dogs cost money, and even if you find a "free to good home" dog there is no guarantee that the dog is healthy or behaviorally sound (which is usually why they are free in the first place.)<br>  <br>  You're looking at spending $400 on initial supplies AND first vet check. And a good $100-$150 a month for food, flea/tick prevention, heart worm prevention, grooming, etc. Emergency costs should the dog become sick or injured can soar WAY over a thousand dollars.<br>  <br>  If mom and dad say "we don't have the money" then you don't get a dog. Period.|`|AA11333096	Honestly, the cheapest Shih Tzu I've seen was at ATC, an ad was posted up with Shih Tzus for P8,000.

Wn3LGHTvaa	Not every female who is uninterested in sex is a lesbian. This goes for turtles too. Maybe if you fed her some wine and dark chocolates, gave her some flowers, and put some Sinatra on the stereo, that might help. I don't know whether it would affect your turtle, though. Better just leave your male to his own devices.|`|sdOMcaI9aa	Maybe she's just not interested in breeding...you can't force them. Is she the right age? Usually when reptiles mate the female is bigger then the male.
gU34xa9vaa	Sorry you had to give your cats up, that must have been awful for you. It's good you've found them another good home.With the younger cat being traumatised before, he will take much longer to settle than the other one. Tell the new owner to leave him where he is, but to put fresh food and water nearby, he'll probably come out when it's very quiet.They will have to be very patient with him but I think when he sees no one is going to hassle him, he will gradually come out more.|`|5f6fbccb8643408cbd62a8431b3e5c44aa	It is going to take some time for them to adjust. It's only been 2-3 days and I would say give it a week or two. The cat will eat when he gets hungry enough to eat and is most likely sneaking bites and drinks when no one is looking. Do not feel horrible for giving them up. You did the right thing if you were unable to provide for their need. A very honorable choice to make. Tell the person who got them to leave some kibble out for the shy one. It will be okay in time and I am sorry you had to give them up. Just know they are okay and fine.|`|eKtEWrcmaa	This is very common. Usually with older cats though who have been known to starve themselves to death mourning their families.<br>  <br>  If the family is close by take over a blanket/item of clothing/towel that smells like your house. That can bring some comfort.<br>  <br>  Have them get a feliway plug in from the petstore. They are around $30-50. Its like an airfreshener that plugs into an outlet and emits pheromones that can help sooth a cat during a stressful time. It has no odor for people just cats.<br>  <br>  Have them put the cat in one bedroom where it is quiet. Provide cat beds and igloos that the cat can hide in and feel safe. They need to slowly work their way up to full house rights. It can be overwhelming for a cat being in a new home. Have them go in and just talk to him. No forced holding just talking in a soothing tone.|`|vwC7klVVaa	The new owners just need to give him time and space he has had alot of unroaor in his life so it will probably take him time to settle. The new owners could try a feed him strong smelling cat food . Morrisons do a nice couple that are fish or they could try tuna in brine.|`|fac19b1dbb2ff2df17b3984f0bd6c4b3aa	Cats need to find their pecking order and the nervous one is just staking out terratory you need to advise that the nervous one is fed seperately so that his confidence can be regained.|`|hktbfRPWaa	He just needs time. He maybe thought it was short term and was fine, but now he's been there a while he's thinking different.  Make sure there is fresh food there for him at all times so he can see the owner is not going to starve him like before. Try talking to him gently. When he gets hungry he'll probably come out.  It may be best not to force him - he may get scared or angry and hurt someone. If he shows signs of being ill in anyway then maybe get a vet to check him out
PKhIXkJAaa	I have one.  They were bred by mixing a chihuahua with either a Pomeranian or a Papillon, as there were originally no long-haired chihuahuas.<br>  <br>  Here's my little guy Timmy ..<br>  <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/16949082@N07/2383498039/" rel="nofollow">http://www.flickr.com/photos/16949082@N0...</a><br>  and<br>  <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/16949082@N07/3007150073/" rel="nofollow">http://www.flickr.com/photos/16949082@N0...</a><br>  <br>  What are they good for ?

Not sure if this is true or what the story is. What chihuahuas do best is be the best, most loving, faithful canine companion as person could ever want.|`|WHEftie5aa	The developmental history of the Chihuahua is very difficult to trace and is based largely on speculation and theory, however through folklore, legend and archeological finds, there is sufficient evidence to prove that it is without doubt an ancient breed originating from Pre-Columbian Mexico, and it is believed to predate any other breed of dog in the Americas. The most common theory and most likely is that Chihuahuas are descended from the Techichi, a companion dog favoured by the Toltecs and that the modern dog developed through breeding with miniaturised Chinese dogs brought to the Americas by the Spanish Conquistadors.<br>  <br>  Historical records of the Techichi, which were thought to hunt in packs, can only be traced as far back as the ninth century but it is highly likely that this is the Chihuahua's native Mexican ancestor. Evidence of this is that the remains of dogs closely resembling, but slightly larger than the average Chihuahua have been found in such places as the Great Pyramid of Cholula, which dates back to the 2nd century BC and predates the 16th century. There is also evidence to suggest that the Techichi may also predate the Mayans. After the Toltecs were conquered by the Aztecs, it is believed that this early ancestor of the Chihuahua was adopted as a symbol of the upper classes and it has been suggested that they were used in religious ceremonies for the absolution of sins and to guide the sprits of the dead. In terms of size, the present day Chihuahua is much smaller than its ancestors, a change thought to be due to the introduction of miniaturized Chinese dogs, such as the Chinese Crested Dog, into South America by the Spanish.<br>  <br>  A progenitor of the breed was reputedly found in 1850 in old ruins near Casas Grandes in the Mexican state of Chihuahua from which the breed gets its name.[7] The state borders with Texas, Arizona and New Mexico where Chihuahuas first rose to prominence and were further developed in the United States. Since that time, the Chihuahua has remained consistently popular as a breed, particularly in America when the breed was first recognised by the American Kennel Club in 1904.<br>  <br>  The Chihuahua has also become part of a popular crossbreed in the United States in the Chihuachshund, which is a pairing of a Chihuahua and a Dachshund. There is also an unusual crossbreed called the Chihueagle, a pairing of the Chihuahua and the Beagle.<br>  <br>  Genetic tests place the Chihuahua with other modern breeds originating in the 1800s.[|`|AA11101806	mexico|`|9IvcV7tiaa	You've already got answers to your question, just want to say congrats on your new little family member, and how lucky you are!

The Chihuahuas are the smallest breed of dog with a strong-will, yet extremely devoted to their owner. They are quick learners with a curious nature and make for an entertaining companion. Their suspicion of strangers makes them excellent guard dogs.<br>  <br>     Some important things to be aware of when selecting a dog of this breed, with large and prominent eyes, they are prone to eye problems. These little dogs are also susceptible to respiratory problems so will need a clean environment.|`|ujrx2gWQaa	It was not clearly evident in what place but it is in the American Continent and the chihuahua not specified the long haired one is from the Chihuahua Mexico, it was originated. They can be a substitute to teddy bears. They can be your personal and true friend. They are good in playing.
fOLO4TNhaa	Nope the dog was not in shock. The guy and the dog where on Dogs 101 on animal planet. The pug has been sky diving since it was young. It has sky dived 12 times already NOT in shock. The dog surfs with the guy, the dog skate boards with the guy, the dog rock climes with the guy etc... THINK can your dog say it has been sky diving? It has been surfing? Its has been rock climbing? This dog has done its since it was little it is his life style. Most pugs walk around a house all day. This pug has adventure this pug has seen things probably no other dog on this earth has. That dog is one of a kind. The dog does in joy it. It is mental stimulation and its new things to see. The most your dogs have done was walk on a leash WOW.<br>  <br>  I don't think its cruel.<br>  <br>  Add: Also the guy rescued the dog from a puppy mill he was sick and he brang him back from basically the dead. From a dog that was going to be sitting in a rabbit cage its whole life to a dog jumping out of a plane at 10,000 feet, Surfing huge waves, Climbing big mountains etc... LUCKY DOG!|`|kvHqnR5Haa	I am a licensed skydiver and I know how hard those openings can be.  When you take an innocent animal and put it in that situation you are asking for an injury.  When the ripcord is pulled you can be jerked pretty hard - a human can brace him/herself for the opening because they know it is happening - a dog can't.  The chances of that dog getting hurt due to a rough opening is pretty high.|`|eyZhiXYpaa	I feel frustrated that I cannot view this link.<br>  <br>  If you think this is cruel in any way then it probably is (and so please don't say sorry to the person who posted it).<br>  <br>  You can report this if you are not happy about it.<br>  <br>  Good luck.|`|e2Pgwa6raa	yep. looks horrible.|`|4IZHdhJQaa	Im Sorry..... but HOW ON EARTH can anyone think this dog is not being ABUSED???<br>  <br>  Poor lil pug, someone needs too save him from that guy!!|`|owe7lyyYaa	Maybe the dog likes it.

That shold not have been allowed happen.|`|MfIz3TPVaa	did the dog complain?|`|DYKYImD0aa	Definitely yes. Dog's aren't accessories to do with as you like. They enjoy doing what dogs like doing, not what humans enjoy. I wish people would stop treating their pets as toys!|`|P8Q39vA4aa	Um yeah i value animal welfare. But thats is not animal cruelty what so ever. The dog is enjoying it. He is not in stress, and is completely safe. Lots of people sky dive with there dogs, big dogs even. I have seen people skydive with labradors. As long as the dog is not stress its fine. I think you really need to figure out whats truly animal cruelty this is the second time you have posted and they were both not animal cruelty. <br>  <br>  The lack of movement is from one the quality of the vid and two because the dog was strapped in tight so he could not move and potentially fall. Also see the guy was holding him. <br>  <br>  If the dog was in stress, that dog would be dead, pugs dont do well with shock.<br>  <br>  Edit- That guy is giving a neglected puppy mill dog a better life. The dog love sky diving, and he did move in the vid. The dog loves to surf too. Is that cruelty? no.<br>  <br>  If i could surf and my dogs like to do it, i would take them surfing. I would put a life jacket on them at first.  I may with my bulldogs teach them to skateboard but only if they want to.<br>  <br>  <br>  My weimaraners actually get out and run in the field and actually do what they were bred to do. Is it animal cruelty if there is a chance they could come back bloody from scrapes and cuts. NO.|`|VmLZFN4Taa	Yes, there is no way an animal would ever enjoy sky diving because they do not understand that they are safe. All they know is that they are falling. It is sick what people do to their pets.|`|N9pKl35Xaa	I wouldnt call it animal ABUSE. Its not like his throwing it out of the plane with its own parachute. Its straped to him so its not going anywhere it can't free fall until he gets hold if it. Ok i understand dogs arent meant to sky dive and i read that the dog looks scared, but i dont think its 'abuse', Cruel maybe because the dog doesnt like it (apparently, just from what ive read), but not abuse. Yeah yeah thumbs down times a million.|`|32ed2884882d13680bd2f9e8ee367fc9aa	Yes it is animal abuse.  It was in shock and terrified beyond anything we could ever imagine.  The owner is trash.  Sorry but I call 'em like I see them.|`|fac19b1dbb2ff2df17b3984f0bd6c4b3aa	YES as this isn't enjoyment for the dog is it! just someone trying to big themselves up at a dumb animals expense.|`|FW0iLLKXaa	My dog would be jealous.

They are sisters and are the best dogs we have and have ever had.<br>  <br>  I suggest looking up some private breeders. You could go and check out there Kennels. If you find them appealing (meaning, they are clean, the dogs are groommed well, etc.) then you should save there number.<br>  <br>  Other people, like BYB, (back yard breeders) you should stay far away from. There puppies are almost always sick and will die before a week after you buy them.<br>  <br>  Occasinally, you can find a Boston at your local animal shelter.

N9pKl35Xaa	My dogs arent allowed in the house, huge rotties walking around here my Mum would kill them! (not literally just a figure of speech). But if they ever get in here the first thing they do is pee! Male dog pee is the WORST smell ever (and dont tell me they should of been trained! They're trained as outside dogs). Anyway when im out there sometimes they just ignore me and lay around. The younger one will follow me around everywhere and just stand next to me for 20hours if he has to. The older one will always come to my side and sit directly next to me, if i move to the left half a meter, he still comes and stands next to me. If im sitting on the ground and the younger one is around the older one literally sits on my or sits against me like a leaning post. If you go out there acting all exicted they jump around and wobble their asses (because of the lack of tail! haha) and get all excited. And depending on what words we use to call them they can just come excited or sometimes they will come alert. But all round they are very friendly toward me and always let me know im welcome!|`|FW0iLLKXaa	Insanely adorable I can't even stand it sometimes.

kZ5wWUg2aa	This Disease is very infectious!  It is a severe gastroenteritis and can be fatal if not treated. Its more common in cats that are unvaccinated that are under 1 year of age. It is spread by oral contact, infected faeces,urine and saliva.<br>  <br>  It causes depression, Fever, diarrhoea, tummy pains, and dehydration.<br>  <br>  Its treatment involves fluid therapy, and anibiotics. The cat needs to be isolated away from other cats.<br>  <br>  Disinfectants are available to kill this virus in the environment and all areas when the cat has been need to be scrubbed with this special disnfectant.<br>  <br>  Hope this helps<br>  <br>  There is a disinfect called F10 which kills the virus there is also another one called trigene.<br>  Dettol wont kill this virus!!. I know that some bleaches like White King kill the virus but the first two are the best. Ask your vet about them as they are not available for sale most of the time but your vet may be able to see you a small portion to make up with water|`|3JJu3MIbaa	It is a viral infection caused from feline parvo.  It is primarily spread through contact with an infected cat's bodily fluids, feces, or fleas. Sometimes it is spread through contact with bedding, food dishes, or even by handlers of infected cats.<br>  <br>  It is infectious to other cats, but it is impossible for a cat to spread Panleukopenia to a dog, as dogs can not contract the virus.<br>  <br>  There are vaccinations for Panleukopenia as part of the FPV.<br>  <br>  There is no specific treatment for the panleukopenia virus. The therapy is aimed at providing supportive care and for treating the secondary bacterial infection. These include: <br>  # Intravenous fluids<br>  # Injectable broad spectrum antibiotics<br>  # Withholding food and water<br>  # Antiemetic drugs (drugs that control vomiting)<br>  # Intravenous nutritional support<br>  # Blood transfusions<br>  # Recombinant human granulocyte colony stimulating factor (G-CSF)<br>  <br>  If this is the case, I hope that your cat gets better.
NAGiNKFWaa	Shame on you picking on poor Hershey, no wonder he is sticking his tongue out at you.  ( Just kidding) Well you are right, it is a dominance thing and you won, however, I don't like this is a form of training.  I think it has a tendency to provoke the dog, often when the dog is just eating a bone, minding his own business, and then when the dog bites the owner, they blame the dog.  I think you are doing a fine job with Hershey, and you don't need to do this with him.  I know there are people that do this with their dogs, but I don't, I think it provokes the dog, and frankly you are doing a really good job with Hershey, you don't need to agitate him.  You said yourself that when he jumps on the bed uninvited, you take him off the bed, you were doing it right.  I guess it is up to you if you think Hershey needs this kind of training, but I think you are doing just fine without it, however, every owner has to do what is best for them and their dog, so ultimately it is up to you.|`|fac19b1dbb2ff2df17b3984f0bd6c4b3aa	You should never do that as you may end up getting bitten as to a dog this is a direct threat....staring out an opponent!|`|eyZhiXYpaa	With dog training and general dog ownership there is nothing wrong with trying new things (as long as it isn't cruel).<br>  <br>  You just proved your dominance over your dog, that's all.

The name should be: short, easy to say, not sounding like another word that you would use often. From there you can decide if you want it to reflect their personality (Zippy), their appearance  (Oreo).  You can select a longer name and then shorten it for the call name.  (My mom had a collie once named Alastair, but they called him Al.)<br>  Do remember that you're going to have to call this name out loud in public.  (Did you know that George Washington had a dog named "Sweet Lips"? And Lincoln had a dog named Fido).  I've given you a reference with a list of names, and also my website and blog addresses as well.|`|Bz5aeBKpaa	it all depends on the type of puppy you are getting. but hear are a few names that may help you decide<br>  rex<br>  max<br>  rocky<br>  Bruce<br>  domino<br>  toby<br>  bamby<br>  <br>  you can also use this website to get a list of other dog names. hope this helps<br>  <a href="http://petrix.com/dognames/a.html" rel="nofollow">http://petrix.com/dognames/a.html</a>|`|4IZHdhJQaa	I work around puppies every day, they always end up with names like "Monster" or "chook" .<br>  <br>  Depending on what breed though i think there are different names,like for eg I love the name "Mango" for a yellow labrador.

4BBjhHAnaa	Cats do something called "kneading" that is when they sort of work their paws at something and extend and retract their paws.  This is very soothing for them.  Your cat, however, probably didn't learn the proper way to handle her claws from her mother a litter mates.  She doesn't realize that she is hurting you.<br>  When you go inside, she gets upset.  She really likes the attention you give her and she is lonely and possibly frightened when you leave.<br>  <br>  You should consider rescuing her rather than letting her stay outside.  She can get all sorts of diseases out there and she would probably be much happier in your home.<br>  Get her all of her shots and have her spayed.<br>  If you can't take her in, you should take her to your local no-kill animal shelter.<br>  She may stop clawing once she feels more secure.  Also, you can use a spray bottle to teach her to stop.  Unfortunately, if her behavior will not change and she is really hurting you or is tearing up your furniture, you might have to get her declawed.  I highly recommend against this as it is very painful for the cat.|`|UNFxjNHkaa	I think marsena meant that she DIS-agree's with declawing.  Because she said that the cat would have no way to defend itself outside of the house.  Which is a valid point to NOT declaw the cat!<br>  <br>  Anyways - Do you clip your cats nails?  My cats do this too when they're sitting on my lap, but I keep their nails short so they dont hurt me - they dig their claws in because they're comfortable not because she wants to hurt you.<br>  <br>  As for the meowing - is she spayed?  She could be in heat.  If she's not spayed you should have that done|`|fac19b1dbb2ff2df17b3984f0bd6c4b3aa	The digging of the nails in is called cleeting and all cats do this it is a sign of contentment and feral as well as domestic do it (I have both) you need to put a cushion on your lap if she does this and let her have her little moment which is a natural cat behaviour anyway showing her enjoyment.A she cat has a deeper MEOW Than a male cat has so it is quite normal.|`|MfIz3TPVaa	i agree with the declawing esp if it was to get out of the home how would it defend itself  just sligthly pick up on it paws when u feel its goin to claw your leg also try to put something in your lap to protect you ,try letting her in your house and you will have a friend for life.|`|GtqdaAGZaa	because she is in heat.<br>  Or maybe! because shes a kitten and they do that.
283f865e237ea72119b132f652eb514baa	well if it is a real bobcat then it will eat the domestic cats. keep your cats inside and get them spayed/neutered. that way your cats will be happy, healthy, and safe, and you can still enjoy watching the real wildlife. bobcats are quite reclusive so seeing one in the wild is a wonderful thing. seeing them eat domestic cats is not a wonderful thing.|`|P8hOtEdOaa	Are you sure this isn't some large domestic breed?

And if it's on your porch it's been there for a long time or it's sick or starving. Rule of thumb with rabies...if it's wild and acts unusually tame, it could be rabid...and if it's domesticated and acts uncharacteristically wild it could be rabid. Please call animal control, the police, or someone, before someone's two year old child gets attacked and killed.<br>   A Bobcat is not an animal you want to tangle with and if it gets hungry enough, or it has babies, it very possibly could kill someone.|`|8ey4ArjXaa	Call the pound and tell all of the tenants with cats to keep them in.<br>  Do NOT use spray at all beacause it could shoo all the other cats away when the bobcat's gone(reminder that spray stays for a very long time.)|`|gieEWY1Qaa	Whatever you do.

Adjust accordingly to his body condition.|`|ahzL8uCKaa	What ever kind of food you are using whether it's dry or wet it should have a chart that tells you how much to feed him daily according to how much he weighs on the back of the food bag. <br>  <br>  best of luck with your new puppy|`|aSKsDtwLaa	Three times a day until about 6 months of age, then twice from then on.  For a puppy give him all he wants just remove the bowl when he is done (15 minutes or so), how ever much he has eaten is a good gage for the next meal.

I suggest staying away from any dog 'food' if you can call it that, at grocery stores and Wal-marts, they are all packed with fillers like wheat, corn, gluten, by-products and meat-meal which, believe it or not, contains euthanized dogs and cats if you care to check this out; <br>  <a href="http://www.rotts-n-spots.com/id12.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.rotts-n-spots.com/id12.html</a><br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.dogfoodanalysis.com/dog_food_reviews/" rel="nofollow">http://www.dogfoodanalysis.com/dog_food_...</a><br>  <br>  Stick to a 5-6 star rating, or at the least, 4.|`|GIeGVJRmaa	Puppies have small stomachs but large appetites, so feed them small amounts on a frequent basis.<br>  <br>  2-3 months: four meals a day <br>  <br>  It's best to keep to the feeding recommendations of commercially produced puppy foods.|`|ndaraRSOaa	once a day and onl a half a cup|`|ZHIrFqIraa	Puppies need to be fed three times a day.  Beneful has a lot of corn in it so the puppy doesn't use a lot of the food and poops out most of it, so he gets hungry faster.  You might want to try a food that doesn't have corn.  A good food should have a specified meat protein as the first ingredient, such as lamb or chicken.  The puppy's body will digest more of the food, filling him up better, and he will poop less.

Btw the two states that they are illegal in are California and Hawaii.|`|hQQuqyYcaa	I don't know about illinois. If you see them at your local Petco, then they are legal, lol.

f1gmEmUTaa	If it's glazed then it's sealed. So it shouldn't be a problem at all.

Good luck!|`|Z4PxfObXaa	I'm taking a Ceramics class.<br>  From what we have learned, once the glaze has been fired, everything is okay.<br>  If fired glaze is safe enough to eat off of, then I'd say it's safe enough to stick in your fish tank.|`|yczbg2pKaa	no glazed  just get a normale pot  that is not shiny|`|S9vnARx8aa	I would play it safe. Even though the piece is glazed, it may still not be 'safe' if certain chemicals were used in the glaze (zinc oxide for example) then the piece is not food safe (the chemicals can leak out over time) and thus, not safe for your fish tank. There is no way to tell what chemicals were used in your glaze if you do not know where the piece originally came from. I would take it out of the tank and replace it with a piece you know is safe.|`|8KxNa0eVaa	In my opinion, I think you should play it safe and just wait to buy an item that you are sure will not cause any problems in the water.  Better safe than sorry, you know?  Anyways, good luck!  Fish tanks can be a pain in the butt some times.
DYKYImD0aa	Hide and seek is great for dogs. You give your dog the stay command, then go find a hiding spot and call him to come find you. Give him lots of attention or a treat as a reward.

C7DOTjhqaa	It's very unusual for a dog to urinate or defecate where it sleeps, so my guess is that he really can't hold it.  (It's instinctive to keep his "den" clean.)<br>  <br>  Try cutting off his water access about three hours before he's going to be confined.  Then make sure he gets to go out two or three times before going into his crate for the night, to make sure he's had a chance to empty his bladder.  And if he does pee outside in the hours before bed, be sure to praise him to high heaven to reinforce the behavior.<br>  <br>  Hope this is helpful, and good luck!|`|2c844fcf526bc2b90f16b7c425e11aa7aa	He's not yet able to hold it all night so you need to get up once during the night and take him outside.

And what happens if it gets the guinea pig? Many guinea pigs have died because of this.<br>  <br>  > Another reason is because each animal needs different diets and food.

Then maybe you shouldn't have bought ANOTHER animal in the first place!!!|`|JGq9rKBOaa	No, rabbits and guinea pigs shouldn't be kept together. People do it, but that doesn't mean it's a good idea. A few people saying, "It worked for me," don't make the risks any less significant.<br>  <br>  Rabbits have very strong hind legs, and show their dominance by mounting. Rabbits kick. An excited or territorial rabbit, even a small one, could seriously injure or kill a guinea pig. <br>  <br>  Also, their dietary needs are different. Both need fresh hay all day, and veggies, but guinea pigs need a pellet that has added vitamin C. Rabbit food can also contain antibiotics that aren't good for pigs. <br>  <br>  But above all, their SOCIAL needs are different. A guinea pig and a rabbit will not socialize like two rabbits or two guinea pigs. They're different species - looking similar does not make them relate to each other in the same way. It's like speaking a different language - rabbit social behaviors are different than guinea pig social behaviors. Even the way they interact with humans is different.<br>  <br>  I have a rabbit and three guinea pigs. The guinea pigs are caged, the rabbit sleeps in a pen at night and is free range during the day. He doesn't have access to the guinea pigs, but sometimes he sees them through the bars of the cage - and they don't even seem to recognize the other species as another animal. My rabbit has had more social interactions with my CATS than he has with my guinea pigs. The guinea pigs don't acknowledge his presence at all - they're too busy acting like GUINEA PIGS amongst themselves! <br>  <br>  Guinea pigs vocalize a lot. Rabbits do not. Rabbits have a "potty corner" (which, in pet rabbits, can easily be a litterbox). Guinea pigs are messy. When let out for 'floor time," guinea pigs play "follow the leader," which I've never seen in rabbits. Basically, what I'm saying is, even if they don't kill each other, they won't be as happy together as they would if you housed them properly.<br>  <br>  I'd recommend choosing between either guinea pigs and rabbits. If you get guinea pigs, get multiples. Most female-female pairs work well, as do female-neutered male pairs. Often two males can be kept together, but they might need a little extra space. Even neutered males will fight over females, so never try to house multiple males around females. I have a neutered male and two girls, and it works great. <br>  <br>  For information on guinea pigs, check out these sites:<br>  <a href="http://www.guineapigcages.com/" rel="nofollow">http://www.guineapigcages.com/</a><br>  <a href="http://www.cavyspirit.com/" rel="nofollow">http://www.cavyspirit.com/</a><br>  <a href="http://www.guinealynx.info/" rel="nofollow">http://www.guinealynx.info/</a><br>  <br>  If you get a rabbit, I'd recommend starting out with either one or an adult bonded pair. If you get two babies, they'll need to be neutered/spayed, and that means you'll have to separate them at some point and then reintroduce them. I wouldn't recommend trying to introduce rabbits unless you've already kept rabbits long enough to understand a bit about their personalities and social behaviors. <br>  <br>  Try <a href="http://www.petfinder.com/" rel="nofollow">http://www.petfinder.com/</a> when looking for rabbits (or guinea pigs) to adopt. Many shelters have rabbits and guinea pigs, and there are also specialized rescues. Rescue rabbits will usually already be neutered/spayed, and if you want two, you can usually find bonded pairs or trios.<br>  <br>  For more information on rabbits, check out <a href="http://www.rabbit.org/" rel="nofollow">http://www.rabbit.org/</a><br>  <br>  For both rabbits and guinea pigs, make sure you read the parts of the sites about their PERSONALITIES - it'll give you a better chance of choosing the one right for you! They're very different as pets, despite similar appearances. Don't get a guinea pig expecting it to act like a rabbit with smaller ears - people who do that are often the ones who label guinea pigs "boring."|`|nPdKJyK4aa	Guinea Pig carer is RIGHT!!! DO NOT PUT GUINEA PIG AND RABBIT TOGETHER. It is not a waset to invest in another cage its for the healthy and safety of your animals. If you want an inexpensive cage google c&c cages.

It could have simply been an elevated ammonia/nitrite/nitrate count that caused the first problem, and a water change and/or ammonia neutralizer would have fixed that.<br>  Melafix isn't the greatest medication to use anyway.  Most people say it's a waste of money.<br>  The next problem could have been the result of adding melafix and stresscoat at the same time. I once put a water clarifier and ammo lock in at the same time and immediately the water had like 1" of foam at the top and within 5 minutes, 37 of my fish had died.  Luckily I had another empty tank going and was able to swiftly rehome the ones that survived.<br>  you have to read the labels and see if it's ok to use different things simultaneously.  If it doesn't say, I wouldn't do it, now that I've experienced what it can do.  The salt wouldn't have hurt in either case, unless the fish you had couldn't tolerate salt.  Some can't, though most can benefit from it especially when they're ill.  You didn't say what kind of fish they were, so I can't help you with that, but in any case, I don't think the salt is what caused the growth in your tank.  (sounds like algae to me).  <br>    Did you measure the things that you DID put in the tank to prevent overdosing?  That happens alot, especially in smaller tanks, it just easy to do. The only thing I would guess it that you put two things in the tank that shouldn't have been mixed together.|`|qeOlkRM0aa	You probably overloaded the tank. How many fish did you have? What kind of filtration? Was it cycled? There's a good chance you also over treated the tank. 10 gallons isn't very big, so when something goes wrong, it will go wrong quickly. My advice would be to tear down the tank, scrub it out and start over.

AA12347845	Here are some basic tips to start off -<br>  <br>  - Buy the largest aquarium you can. You may have to consider both available space and cost. Note: larger tanks are easier to maintain.<br>  <br>  - Research thoroughly which species or community (group of compatible fish) you would like to keep. Dont opt for something very exotic and thus difficult in the beginning. All that can come later after you have sufficient experience.<br>  <br>  - Get all the essential equipment while buying the tank like hood & light fittings, filter, heater, thermometer, airstone/air tubing & air pump etc. Note : if you are buying a modular aquarium you will not have to buy a hood & lights and it will probably have a built in filter as well. Also ensure that all fittings are appropriately rated to suit the size of the tank. Buy a Test Kit - its the best investment you can make.<br>  <br>  - Get the tank up & running. Wash & lay out the gravel, fill up the tank halfway with clean, aerated (for 24 hours to remove Chlorine) tap water, put in the decor & plants, instal the equipment & turn on.<br>  Note : use 60-75 % RO (Reverse Osmosis) water if you intend to keep soft water fish like tetras. The percentage of RO water depends on the hardness/PH of your tap water.<br>  <br>  - Check water parameters and temperature then add a couple of hardy fish like danios or platys to start the nitrogen cycle. Dont overfeed the fish ! In case you want to do a fishless cycle go to a good fishkeeping site & download instructions. Instead of fish you will require pure ammonia or fish food.<br>  <br>  - Change 25% water weekly for 3-4 weeks, check the parameters(weekly)  especially PH ammonia, nitrites, then add a couple of more fish.<br>  <br>  - add a couple of fish every week, constantly keeping the parameters in check/control till you have reached the optimum fish population for the tank capacity.<br>  <br>  Important -<br>  1. Always find time to observe individual fish. If something seems abnormal you can remove the particular fish and nip the problem in the bud. <br>  2. Never overfeed - this is the single biggest reason for deterioration in <br>  water quality & fish health.<br>  3. Keep an eye on your equipment to ensure that everything is working properly.<br>  <br>  Most of all enjoy your fish - there's nothing more relaxing than looking at a well maintained, beautifully laid out aquarium.<br>  <br>  All the best !|`|ZgaBUns4aa	There are 100s of fresh water fish breeds. While researching on the variety of fresh breeds you may divide the fresh water fish in to 5 main categories. Following are the 5 categories:<br>  <br>  1. Small freshwater fish - A moderate cleaning of the tank is sufficient enough for these freshwater little fish to survive.<br>  <br>  2. Large freshwater fish - To keep large water fish in the aquarium you would have to cut down on the number of fish would like to maintain. It is advised to keep 2 to 3 large water a fish in a moderately sized tank.<br>  <br>  3. Gold fish - They can even survive in bowls without an air pump provided the water is changed on a regular basis.<br>  <br>  4. Bottom Feeders - You may keep a bottom feeder variety in your tank if you want to keep your tank clean. <br>  <br>  For more information try the below link<br>  <a href="http://www.petcaregt.com/fishcare/fresh-water-fish-tips.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.petcaregt.com/fishcare/fresh-...</a>|`|wnnudNp5aa	Before you do anything, go to a pet store, book store, or your local library and pick up at least one book (more is better) about keeping a freshwater aquarium.

QbcnDDxUaa	Moulting (SNAKES SHEDDING SKIN)serves a number of functions – firstly, the old and worn skin is replaced, secondly, it helps get rid of parasites such as mites and ticks. Renewal of the skin by moulting is supposed to allow growth in some animals such as insects, however this view has been disputed in the case of snakes.<br>  Moulting is repeated periodically throughout a snake's life. Before a moult, the snake stops eating and often hides or moves to a safe place. Just before shedding, the skin becomes dull and dry looking and the eyes become cloudy or blue-colored. The inner surface of the old outer skin liquefies. This causes the old outer skin to separate from the new inner skin. After a few days, the eyes clear and the snake "crawls" out of its old skin. The old skin breaks near the mouth and the snake wriggles out aided by rubbing against rough surfaces. In many cases the cast skin peels backward over the body from head to tail, in one piece like an old sock. A new, larger, and brighter layer of skin has formed underneath.[26][28]<br>  An older snake may shed its skin only once or twice a year, but a younger, still-growing snake, may shed up to four times a year.[28] The discarded skin gives a perfect imprint of the scale pattern and it is usually possible to identify the snake if this discard is reasonably complete and intact.[26] This periodic renewal has led to the snake being a symbol of healing and medicine, as pictured in the Rod of Asclepius.[29]|`|e4ffd05d5175695c64fc913b628c28a3aa	snakes dont live skins. <br>  they leave their skin.<br>  I believe they dont wear jeans and tshirts or chudidars or sarees so they shed their skin away because of the following rerasons.<br>  <br>  1.The snake just hated the color pattern and design of the skin. <br>  2.The skin might have just got loose or tight by a cm/mm something.<br>  3.The snake's life partner didnt like the way its skin is.<br>  4.The snake never followed fair and lovely cream Advt. and the skin dried.<br>  5.The snake doesn't use sunscream lotions and vaseline and got skin allergies.<br>  I think these are enough.

They live on land and water. So snakes vary quite a bit, but all snakes young and old, shed their skin.<br>  <br>  When they do this the even the film covering the eyes is cast off. During the process of shedding, the skin is turned inside out. The snake removes the skin by rubbing against rough surfaces. And snakes shed their skin several times a year.<br>  <br>  The skin of the snake is scaly and this is very important to them. The scales on the skin enable snake to move gracefully and even quickly. The broad scales on the underside can be moved forward in such a way that the rear edge of each scale pushes against some irregularity in the ground. When the snake is pushed back against these irregularities, then whole snake moves forward.<br>  <br>  When the snake wants to move quickly or with great speed, it combines with another method. This consists of swinging the body sideways into loops and by pushing against any stone or plant it touches, gliding along the twisted path formed by the loops.|`|e40214e61a518c8534dc6ad01c1109caaa	Snakes do not live their skin.

Cats are driven to mate by their hormones and nothing else. Satisfaction, love, relationships, have absolutely nothing to do with animals mating. That is just humanizing them and it is wrong. They are not humans.<br>  <br>  3.if a male is neutered,does he still show an urge to mate?<br>  A- Yes sometimes he will for up to 2 months after his surgery. It may take that long before all of the hormones are out of his system. He will have been surgically altered though so even if he were to go through the motions, he has no testicles and no sperm so he can not impregnate a female.<br>  <br>  Bottom line: It is much better to have both animals altered. Intact females can get uterine infections and uterine cancers, are at an increased risk for bladder infections and mammary cancers. Intact males can get testicular cancer and are at an increased risk for bladder infections and mammary cancers. Not to mention that millions of unwanted cats and kittens are killed in shelters every year, simply because there are too many of them. Altered animals will not have the urge to roam or to fight, nor will they spray urine. Tomcat spray is nasty and intact females spray as well. Better to have both altered.|`|f5a8d99afbb73cd0703df99b87996901aa	Neutering takes away the sex drive. For a while, some cats still "go through the motions" of mating after neuter but pregnancy won't result. A male cat's penis has spines on it designed to hold it inside the female cat till sperm is released into her.  The process does cause pain to the female. Since they lack the estrus scent most toms leave spayed females alone.

MstjbpVJaa	There are quite a number of things that your bird could have died from!!!!<br>  <br>  But going by the position that you found your bird dieing,I would say that it died of "Shock" I have bred various species of birds and this dying Head back position is consistent with Shock.<br>  <br>  This is no reflection on your bird keeping skills,something frightened it and that was the finally.<br>  <br>  I have it happen to my birds they were in Aviaries with plenty of places to hide, but nothing can prevent Shock (like the local Cat or Sparrow Hawk)visiting.|`|09e41Hdwaa	It could be various reasons.  Don't listen to James, lovebirds are not that sensitive.  In fact, I've noticed that they seem to be one of the most hearty birds out there.<br>  <br>  It would be wise to take your dead bird to the vet for a necropsy.

AA11901352	With optimum conditions koi grow at just under 1 inch per month for the first 12 months they are alive. (1/16 of an inch as a fry)  All fish are different so I would say from years of breeding koi your fish is just around a month.

The Black Moor will be slower and probably 4" within the year.<br>  <br>  The Tetra - what species of Tetra? There are dozens upon dozens, in all shapes and sizes. Probably a few months old.<br>  <br>  FYI, the Koi should be in at least a 600-1000 gallon filtered pond - never in a tank. The fancy Goldfish (the Moor) should be in at least a 20 gallon tank - it will get bullied by Koi and Common Goldfish so they should not be mixed. The Tetra needs a tropical set up, not coldwater like the other two, and is likely to get eaten by either of the other fish as they outgrow it, they are not compatible.<br>  <br>  And it's "they" not "dey"!!
LWEceVT4aa	I would suggest a carrier. When my dog is scarred he'll do two things, if I'm not around he'll run to my room and go under my bed, or if I am around he comes and practically jumps in my lap(65pound husky lapdog). <br>  <br>  In the room that the dog sleeps in is there any beds he could sleep under??? Dogs like small confined places... They see this as there safe place. If there is no bed, then I would <br>  suggest that you purchase a carrier for her. This is another ''safe place'' for her to go during a storm. <br>  <br>  So here's a great way for her to learn carrier is a good thing. First time you introduce her to the carrier make it a joyful experience. Coax her to go in by throwing in some treats and praise her a lot when she goes in. When there is a storm during the day bring her to her carrier and give her treats in it again... Soon she will understand to go there during storms, be consistent and this will work for you.<br>  <br>  *** You can line the bottom of the carrier with anything you want, a blanket or pillow, but you should add like one of your old shirts or something with your smell on it so she will smell it and be comforted.<br>  You should also leave on a tv or radio, or even just put a loud ticking clock in with her, and one of her teddys.<br>  ***I reread your question, and it turns out you already have a crate so... pretend like its brand new and start over with it with the advice I have given, dogs are supposed to see their crate as a safe place, if she does not she needs to be re introduced to it.<br>  <br>  ***Oh for the person who posted above me THEFINAL... I can't even believe you would say this. This lady and her Husband adopted this dog, ultimately saved its life and are looking for a bit of advice, I don't know them but I trust them knowing they saved a dogs life. And you tell them to rehome him! I can't believe it... She is ALLERGIC did you not read that part???

Remember she is still very unsure and you don't know how her previous owners treated her, especially when there was a storm. Maybe (although I doubt it) they allowed her in the bed or they pampered her when she got so scared. But then they wouldn't have dumped her at the shelter. Anyway, you will have to give her plenty of love and attention so she can learn to trust you and so she can feel safe and secure. Do not pamper her when there is a storm. Rather put on some soothing music. You have to desensitize her from loud sounds, like thunder. Just for the beginning put her bed next to yours. Let her learn that her bed is a safe place. After a few months you can start moving her bed out of your room. It takes a long time to really desensitize them - be patient.<br>  And just try this - stop eating anything containing wheat - your allergies will go away.|`|u1gLTZYIaa	You can get mild sedatives for dogs that are scared of fireworks etc. These should keep her calmer.

Hugging & cuddling her when she in a weaken state will just make her more frightened.<br>  <br>  Attitude instead make it look like your having the time of your life-Aka next time have a party when the storm around-Make it look like your having fun, dancing, singing, playing a soothing or upbeat party music etc-this show the dog their nothing to fear!<br>  <br>   Another tool is when there no storm, buy a CD disk of a thunderstorm and play it consistly at it lowest volume, then gradual increase the volume until its around the same level that a real thunderstorm would be-this is called desenitation<br>  <br>  As much as it hard to do, ignore the behaviour of her barking in the crate-when the storm on, once the storm over & she quiet-let her out and have a play, then reward her for good behaviour. <br>  <br>  A dog is an animal which does not possess the same reasoning skills as humans. They are simple creatures with instincts, and limited emotions. They do not premeditate; do not plan ahead. They live for whatever is happening at the moment. When a human shares its affection with a dog who is in any other state of mind but a calm, submissive one, (for example aggression, obsession, shyness, skittishness, fear or hyper activeness and so on...) and you give him a hug or pat him on the head and tell him it is ok, it is comforting to the human, but feeds into that state of mind for the dog making it more intense. While a human feels they are comforting a dog, the dog sees it as the human being weak. If your dog has a traumatic experience and you show him affection during that time trying to comfort him, rather than letting him work it out in his own mind, you leave him stuck in that state of mind. Later when your dog faces this traumatic situation again, you then comfort the dog, intensifying the situation even more. You are creating the problem. Dogs do not see comfort and affection in the same way we humans see it.<br>  <br>  Belief me I made the mistake of patting my dog  when she was scared as  puppy and as result she used to side jump on walks every day-ever few mintues she freak at door,a car door,a sudden bang etc, once I realised that patting was only making her more fearful, since i stop patting her when she in that fearful state, When she calm down i said come on lets go- she realise their nothing to fear and now she no longer freaks everyday on walks, she hardly freak at all & 12 dozen kids can sneak up being her and start patting her-this previously used to freak her!! She a labrador x golden retriver.<br>  <br>  Not 80% OF shelter dogs are abused- That is BIG myth, <br>  <br>  Myth: Shelter pets are obviously not good pets, or else their original owners wouldn't have gotten rid of them<br>  <br>  If the main reason why a pet gets brought to rescue shelters was because they were a *bad* pet, there would be thousands of empty shelters across the country. Animals are brought to shelters for a large variety of reasons, some of which are...<br>  <br>      * Their owners have passed away<br>  <br>      * An irresponsible owner didn't get their pets spayed or neutered so they found themselves with a litter of babies that they could not keep or did not want<br>  <br>      * The animal's owners were abusive to the animal, so the authorities have removed the pet from the harmful environment<br>  <br>      * An animal was purchased or adopted by someone who did not take into consideration all of the responsibility that caring for that pet would entail. A good example of this would be someone who adopts a pet in an apartment complex that does not allow animals and then is subsequently forced to get rid of the pet. <br>  <br>  <a href="http://calmaudio.com/" rel="nofollow">http://calmaudio.com/</a><br>  <a href="http://www.usask.ca/wcvm/herdmed/applied-ethology/articles/thunder.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.usask.ca/wcvm/herdmed/applied...</a><br>  <br>  It also not a good idea to have a dog sleeping in bed<br>  <a href="http://www.pets.ca/pettips/tips-12.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.pets.ca/pettips/tips-12.htm</a>
IuYekkPVaa	To be happy indoors, cats need a mentally and physically stimulating environement that recreates the outdoors as much as possible.<br>  <br>  Your cat will need something to scratch.  Provide them with a few alternatives; scratch post,sheets of corrugated cardboard or wooden log to see which they prefer.<br>  <br>  Cats like climbing and sitting in high places, so a cat tree or a window seat with a view of somewhere busy will keep them amused.<br>  <br>  Toys that dangle off a wand stick will give your cat the opportunity to practise their hunting skills.  Hide food treats inside a treat ball as another way of keeping them entertained.  <br>  <br>  Make a frantic box.  Take a large cardboard box and put shredded newspaper, newspaper balls etc. into it.

IuYekkPVaa	Cats have two basic responses to something when they are scared - flight or fight.<br>  <br>  A timid cat will try to escape to avoid confrontation and their tail will be down.  A more confident cat who is prepared to stand their ground, will try to increase it's size by puffing up it's tail, and the fur on it's back will stand on end.  This is done in the hope that they will look intimidating and that their opponent will back down.

6979bf0ecfe9ee379c6d4efa120ff381aa	Yes I still would do some vacuuming. Get that black and brown stuff out at least once every 6 months. You can work your way around the plants or replant them if you have too just get some of the stuff out.If you don't the nitrates will build up and your water will get stinky. You don't want to get the bottom clean just get a little of that stuff out of there. This is also how you stimulate angelfish to breed although I don't think a 10 gallon tank is big enough. That is assuming you have a pair of course|`|svrFBaENaa	10 gallon tank is way to small for angelfish. They get very large.<br>  <br>  And yes, you need to vacuum the gravel. It removes a lot of fish poo and uneaten bits of food that will decay and add a lot of nitrates to your tank|`|bDPVRtCNaa	Uneaten food and fish waste settles under the gravel and breaks down. It needs to be removed using a gravel siphon.<br>  <br>  I hope you plan on upgrading to a much larger aquarium in the near future.|`|AraBfesHaa	If you could see what's under the gravel, I'm sure you wouldn't be asking that.  Nasty, nasty stuff.  You need to clean it out periodically to keep the water quality up to par.<br>  yes, it's a little time consuming, not bad, though with only a 10 gallon tank, but once you see what you get out of there, you'll see why you need to do it.
5f6fbccb8643408cbd62a8431b3e5c44aa	Might want to try giving her omega 3 fatty acid supplements. It could be dry and irritated skin. My vet has my pet on this treatment, and I am starting to see new growth and less destruction to the area he was trying to damage. <br>  <br>  DermCaps are sold at Petsmart and there is one brand that is identical in ingredients but is a dollar cheaper and you get 40 extra tablets.  I think the brand is centuary 21....You can get it online if you don't have a Petsmart. Main ingredient is cod oil. <br>  <br>  My vet told meto expect it to take 2-3 weeks to take full effect and reach the skin. I have noticed it getting better in about a weeks time.<br>  <br>  There is something called bitter apple spray try that too. Petsmart and Petco have it. Online or in the store.|`|N9pKl35Xaa	Well the more she licks the worse it gets, when you see her doing it you have to pull her up immediately she wont listen but tell her 'No' or clap or occupy her with a treat or her favourite toy. Its crucial you get her to stop one way or another because it because like OCD and they will get infected and nor to the bone if they are given the chance to do it. Or the Vet is a huge option for anitbotics to reduce the infection as you are trying to train her to stop. But apparently its an addictive thing to them, the more they do it the better it is for them (cant remember what my vet said about it) but yeah, you gotta get her to stop with training her.|`|4ab58a8654f438c9feb415c928245003aa	Perhaps there is some king of yeast on it's coat which can be detected by our human eyes, as well as the vet.<br>  <br>  maybe change your dog's shamppo to CHITOCURE. I am using it for my dogs and it is good for any itchess they might have.|`|2bf0afb576f3b1843272a3d582d8496eaa	My dog did that because of allergies.  His paws would itch - there was something in my garden that he turned out being allergic to.  He'dchew his paw until it was utterly bloody.  You might want to try giving your dog a small dose of an over-the-counter antihistamine like Benadryl - just give the dog one tablet  for each recommended dose (I think it's every four hours), do it for a day or two and see if the behavior changes.  Antihistamines are okay to give to dogs - my vet recommended it as well to give to my dog when traveling so he'd sleep through the trip.  If the pill helps you can go back to the vet and get advice for treating the allergy.<br>  <br>  Edit:  note that your dog is certainly doing this for a reason, not for their own entertainment, so it is likely not a habit that can be cured by discipline - it is more likely that something is wrong and you need to deal with finding out what is causing this behavior whether it is allergies or something else.  Trying my recommendation is only for a day or two and will cause no long-term harm.  If that doesn't work you need to look for other treatment options, and see another vet for their advice.|`|ZNDqYUwkaa	As OR said, use a good Omega 3 supplement and there are a few good ones around, but I am in UK, so not sure what you have over there. Give your vet a call and they can help you. <br>  <br>  I have a Rottie/Lab mix too, 9 months now, huge and I know just how playful they are. Saffie seems to have springs in place of her leg joints and her tail could wipe out a small sky scraper!<br>  <br>  If I were you, I would keep going with the collar and dress her paw if necessary overnight when you can't supervise her. Take the dressing off in the day to let the air get to it to help it heal and let the skin breath. Do this while giving her the supplement consistently.<br>  <br>  When the skin is healed and there is a little fur regrowth, I would use a little bitter apple spray. All the types I have seen are safe on the skin, but not on broken skin. I would never use chili paste or anything homemade as you cannot properly determine the effect it will have on the dog. If you use bitter apple spray though, it should help to prevent her going at it.  like she does. <br>  <br>  Good luck and give the supplements a month to get working. If you see no changes after that, ask your vet if there are any dermatologists that they can refer you too. I know of an animal dermatologist near to me that has referrals from all around the south of the UK, so I don't think there are many around, but worth asking. There are many forms of skin problems that cannot be seen by the human eye and a scraping needs to be looked at under microscope to diagnose.<br>  <br>  I hope your girl is ok and have fun. BTW, at 4 years, how big/heavy is she? Mine is 9 months and 35 kilos (77lbs) and as her mother was a rottie, rescued while in pup, we don't know who the father was or how big he was, but looking at her, he must have been a black lab.<br>  <br>  Anyway, good luck!
5H8kjwHDaa	Well maybe he heard on the news that it was Chinese lead.|`|7M8Pf378aa	I dont blame your dog for being scared, being hit with a lead would have hurt and to have it put on him to go for a walk, well he will be remembering how much it hurt and he is scared of it now. I would try getting him a different lead to try and convince him that its ok, its different and it wont hurt him, you need plenty of patience with him as I am sure if you got hit you would be wary of that object was used around you or with you as well. Its not that he hates it, he is simply scared of it|`|0fygxRHLaa	hehe|`|J5C3WKxfaa	never ever hit a dog it solves nothing.<br>  <br>  gradually introduce your dog to his lead again reward him when he has the lead on, he is frightened that he will be hit again, show him that this will not happen.<br>  <br>  put the lead on your dog and play with him give him treats and cuddles and slowly he will get use to it again|`|AA11101806	you will have to be holding your dog, and make sure he is calm.  then pick up the lead/leash and attach it to his collar.<br>  <br>  you will probably have to be down on the ground and keep the lead behind you.  then you can pick it up when he is calm.|`|Dg0YKEQyaa	He should have never hit him with a lead, what you need to do is show the dog your loyalty by hitting your dad with the lead.This will prove to the dog you care and he will respect you for it.|`|DHwuMoWbaa	put a dildo up it bum
yAuLv2GPaa	When any dog approaches mine I make them both sit and watch it approach. More often than not the strange dog will stop long before it gets close to my dogs and check out their body language. By keeping my two in a calm relaxed state and staying that way myself the other dog senses no threat and moves in to smell. Only once have I had a problem with another dog acting aggressive toward mine and a well placed kick deterred the fight that would have occurred.|`|e2Pgwa6raa	my dog has the same problem as this. he was chased as  a puppy by 2 labradors, and now he is scared of other dogs. in that situation, it was the right thing to do, but don't do that every time you go near another dog. just walk normally, and let your dog inspect the other one. it'll take time for him to get use to other dogs though.|`|zIvkQPKwaa	Theres Nothing You Can Really Do,<br>  Theres No Proper Way Of Dealing With This.<br>  If It Was Me I Would Tell The Owners To Keep Their Bloody Dogs<br>  On A Lead If Their Dogs Act Like That!|`|V8JtHopoaa	Thats all you could of done if the 3 girls didnt even bother trying to get their dogs of yours. In my opinion they shouldnt of been walking the dogs if they cant control them. Ive been in that situation before and its got to the point where iv felt like booting the other dog,cos the owner just wasnt botherd, i mean my dog was so expensive and im not just gona let a mongrel attack her. Shes like a second child to me.<br>  If i were you next time it happens just keep your dog ther stood still, unless the dogs fight!  Your dog needs to know that not every dog is going to want a fight.|`|XIH2oKtJaa	i only had my rottweiler x dogue de bordeaux for a week when coming home from a stroll a pit bull (in the UK - not happy) ran at him and bit his neck. i let go of his lead to give him the best chance possible, as there was no way i was going near that dog! the owner jumped off his bike and made a pathetic attempt to get it. he fell over. my partner pulled the pit off by its legs but my dog wasn't happy so bit its head very hard. the owner then put a chain on it. since then my dog lunges at every dog he sees. when he does this i tell him to leave it and usually make him sit facing the opposite direction. so in answer to your question i would let my dog go if the dog was already attacking, otherwise block if just approaching more steadily. oh if it was kicking my dogs butt i would boot it in its head no way i'm gunna let my dog get killed by some psycho *** dog.|`|eyZhiXYpaa	You did the right thing. This is a tough one as in the 'rules' it states that you should never get involved if your dog is approached by an aggressive dog or gets into a fight - AS IF!<br>  <br>  There is NO WAY I would leave my little pup to the mercy of another dog.  What you did was right, just make sure you walk away with your dog asap - NEVER RUN, as this makes the aggressive dog want to chase.<br>  <br>  Although they say against it, I would pick my dog up and have a go at the kids with the aggressive dogs off lead - it is illegal to let your dog off lead and without a muzzle if it shows unprovoked aggression to other dogs.<br>  <br>  The owners of the other dogs need a kicking BIG TIME.|`|xU8PhgSIaa	I would be mortified!!  But you can't allow your fear to be known. All owners should have their dogs on a leash or know they will obey a voice command. Unfortunately, some owners don't follow these rules. It could easily be a tragic situation for dogs and owners. You would be correct in taking control of your dog and hopefully the other owners would do the same. You should leave the scene as quickly and calmly as possible though. To keep your dog from being aggressive or barking at other dogs, be aware of when a strange dog is around, remain calm but in charge, keep your dog's focus on the walk. Position the collar higher up on the neck and if you anything distracting ahead, firmly, but gently, pull or jerk the collar to refocus and control your dog's actions. This will take several lessons, determination, & consistency on your part, but you and your dog will benefit and be safer and happier. Hopefully, others will control their dogs better than the owners of the 3 you experienced. Good luck..I hope this helps.|`|kWwgWSSgaa	* You did the right thing by staying calm when you were faced with an aggressive dog.<br>  <br>  *Walking away casually can often help, but tugging on your dog’s collar can anger your dog, making the situation more intense<br>  <br>  *If you are out for a walk and a dog tries to approach your dog put yourself between your dog and the other dog. First try a verbal warning & if that doesn't work, carry a stout walking stick and use it to drive the other dog away!<br>  <br>  * You can tell a great deal from reading both dogs body language. If your dog is afraid try and walk away, if neither dog seems to be backing down, or if snarls and deep growls are already involved, you may have to physically defend your dog. <br>  <br>  Your dog expects you to protect it from nonpack members, if you don't he will protect himself. When your dog barks give a firm *hush* command to correct him.<br>  <br>  *Remember to carry a cell/mobile phone so you can call for help.<br>  <br>  Some people should *not* be allowed to own dog. Keeping a dog under control is very basic. Good luck with your dog.|`|9ea79964f4ddad1359a8089c6729bb4caa	When I see a dog approaching mine, I try to get the situation under control and try to avoid a fight by showing the other dog that I am dominant and I am not scared of it. I get in front of my dogs and tell the other dog to go away! Most dogs faced with any opposition will turn around and run away.....you do need to stay calm, but you still need to act in a way that shows the other dog you aren't scared. The best thing to do is keep your own dog calm to avoid a fight. If the other dog doesn't get any closer, turn around with your dog and slowly walk in the other direction. If it does run at your dog, pick up a stick or anything you can find to fight the other dog off.....if nothing works and a fight ensues, all you can do is try to break it up without getting hurt.|`|7fb9ba045d96cd607bd916c4c659256caa	Anytime that another dog approaches your dog that is off leash.

AA11101806	get another one.<br>  <br>  <br>  Weimaraners are fast and powerful dogs, but are also suitable home animals given appropriate training & exercise. These dogs are not as sociable towards strangers as other hunting dogs such as Labradors and Golden Retrievers. Weimaraners are very protective of their family and can be very territorial. They can be aloof to strangers, and must be thoroughly socialized when young to prevent aggression. They are also highly intelligent, sensitive and problem-solving animals, which earned them an epithet "dog with a human brain". They are ranked 21st in Stanley Coren's The Intelligence of Dogs, being of excellent working/obedience intelligence.<br>  <br>  From adolescence, a Weimaraner requires extensive exercise in keeping with an energetic hunting dog breed and prized for their physical endurance and stamina. No walk is too far, and they will appreciate games and play in addition. An active owner is more likely to provide the vigorous exercising, games, or running that this breed absolutely requires. Weimaraners are high-strung and often wear out their owners, requiring appropriate training to learn how to calm them and to help them learn to control their behavior. Owners need patience and consistent, firm (yet kind) training, as this breed is particularly rambunctious during the first year and a half of its life. This breed is known for having a penchant for stealing food from table and counter tops whenever given the chance. Like many breeds, untrained and unconfined young dogs often create their own fun when left alone, such as chewing house quarters and furniture. Thus, many that are abandoned have behavioural issues as a result of isolation and inferior exercise.<br>  <br>  Weimaraners are often kind to children, but they may not be appropriate for smaller children due to their tendency to knock a child down in the course of play. The breed is so full of energy that early training to sit (through positive reinforcement) is critical to prevent jumping in the future, as these strong dogs may knock over elderly people or children by accident.[1]<br>  <br>  It should never be forgotten that the Weimaraner is a hunting dog and therefore has a strong, instinctive prey drive. Weimaraners will sometimes tolerate cats, as long as they are introduced to the cats as puppies, but many will chase and frequently kill almost any small animal that enters their garden or backyard. In rural areas, most Weimaraners will not hesitate to chase deer or sheep. However, with good training, these instincts can be curtailed to some degree. A properly trained Weimaraner is a wonderful companion that will never leave its master's side.|`|AA11457471	Any kind of setter.|`|b5b08a7f14d2315049ad9f67246d2a56aa	why not get another one?|`|rLDf1gGGaa	Remember all dogs breeds are different, and even the same breed of dogs, may greatly have a different personality, You seem to like the hounds and sporting dogs<br>  <br>  Greyhound<br>  Temperament:  The Greyhound is an affectionate breed that loves to be around his family, including children. They make a wonderful family pet, however they do have a prey instinct and should not be in a home with smaller animals such as birds, cats, rabbits, or something of the sort. The Greyhound does extremely well with other dogs, however they get along best with their own kind and do very well with another Greyhound in the home. This breed does get along well with children but because he is so sensitive, this breed would do best in a home with older and more respectable children.<br>  <br>  Whippet<br>  Temperament:  Amiable, docile, yet high energy, the Whippet makes a wonderful child's companion providing the child knows how to handle a dog. Rather independent, this breed is also a quick learner but does require consistent training methods and variety as they bore quickly. The Whippet is a very sensitive breed and should never be roughly handled, as shyness is a factor.<br>  <br>   Weimaraner <br>   Temperament:  The Weimaraner is happy and cheerful, highly intelligent and loving. They can be very willful and opinionated. This breed exhibits a truly unique personality. They are passionate and reliable. The Weimaraner prefers to live inside as a member of the family. They require companionship and attention and do not like to be left alone for long periods of time. This breed gets along well with other dogs but not cats. They are not recommended for very young children or the elderly as they could easily knock them down. The Weimaraner is brave and loyal.<br>  <br>  Vizla<br>  Temperament:  The Vizsla is friendly, lively, and affectionate with their family and those they know. They are alert and watchful. They will bark when they sense danger or visitors. They are very reserved with strangers. The Vizsla is very demonstrative, but has a tendency to be willful and distracted. They get along well with older children and in most cases other dogs. They will tolerate cats they are raised with. The Vizsla loves to chew on anything and everything and is not a calm and placid breed. They will become destructive if they are allowed to be bored.<br>  <br>  Chesapeake Bay Retriever<br>  Temperament:  Intensely loyal and deeply devoted, the Chesapeake Bay Retriever has a strong protective nature. This breed is friendly, loving, and affectionate. They do best in a home with older considerate children. They will generally get along with other dogs they have been raised with but have a tendency to be combative and aggressive with dogs they do not know. They do not do well with cats or other small household pets. This breed thrives on family interaction and will become destructive if ignored, lonely, or bored. The Chesapeake Bay Retriever is not recommended for the novice, apathetic, or sedentary owner.<br>  <br>  Nova Scotia Duck Tolling Retriever<br>  Temperament:  Some say this breed has the wonderful temperament of the ever-popular Golden Retriever, but the Toller has been known to be a little wary around strangers and unfamiliar animals. However, this breed will tolerate quite a bit of child's play, and would do well with another four legged companion given they are properly socialized.<br>  <br>  Spinone Italiano<br>  Temperament:  The Spinone Italiano is exceedingly intelligent, exuberant, and cheerful. They take their hunting duties very seriously, but are lively and entertaining in the home environment. They thrive on human companionship and do not do well if left alone for extended periods of time. They will suffer separation anxiety and will become bored and destructive. Spinone Italianos are excellent with considerate children and other household pets, although they do have a tendency to chase after anything that runs. The Spinone Italiano is generally quiet and is not suited for use as protection. They have a very patient nature and will return respect they are given.|`|YuNLL3ppaa	Get another Weim!!

mvrygTYTaa	The dog doesn't respect you. Neither you nor your husband are acting like the pack leader and she has taken the position instead. Private dog training can help if you have someone who will work WITH you in teaching you how to be a pack leader. The trainer can't do anything if you aren't willing to make the effort, and as long as you are scared or dislike the dog, it will know because dogs are great at reading emotions like that.<br>  <br>  There is a great deal of dog training that can be done. Cesar Millan has many books available and you can also check out Victoria Stilwell if you don't like his methods, both are on animal planet and you can learn more about training through them.|`|pLv0Ejt9aa	First of all I would rather suggest joining a dog club. It is less expensive, you only pay a annual fee and not per lesson and also your dog gets to socialize with other dogs and to me that seems really important in your situation. <br>  Secondly my guess is that when you got this beagle puppy she was so cute that you gave her much more attention that the other dog. You probably, without knowing, did things that gave her the impression that she is more important. Now she considers herself as the leader, and she will fight and do anything to maintain that important role.<br>  Here's what you need to do: you must be the leader of both your dogs. Do these four things consistently:<br>  1. Before you feed them - eat something, let them see you do that. Then first give the male dog his food, and then the beagle.<br>  2. When you leave the house - ignore them both, just walk out, do not say goodbye.<br>  3. When you come back in - ignore them for 5 minutes. Then greet them, first the male then the female.<br>  4. Always when you do anything with them - first the male then the female. In that way you establish yourself as their leader and you establish the older dog as the leader of them.

Perhaps attaching your leash to a dog harnesses instead.<br>  Surgery is necessary in severe cases or they will ‘choke’ to death.|`|MKuDawP7aa	It can be rather frightening to witness your dog reverse sneeze for the first time. Reverse sneezing in dogs is rather common. Although it can look disturbing, this condition isn't harmful to your dog at all. So, what exactly does dog reverse sneezing look like?<br>  <br>  During regular sneezing, air is pushed out rapidly through the nose. In a reverse sneeze, air is pulled in through the nose rapidly. This prompts your dog to make a loud snorting sound which makes you wrongfully think your dog may be suffocating. These episodes are usually short, lasting for just one or two minutes.<br>  <br>  Causes<br>  <br>  Reverse sneezing in dogs is brought on when the soft palate and throat becomes becomes irritated and causes a spasm. The exact reason for this is usually unknown. However, the cause may be due to various reasons. Common reasons include allergies, nasal inflammation, mites, viruses, and foreign bodies.<br>  <br>  Symptoms<br>  <br>  As mentioned earlier, dog reverse sneezing is relatively common and usually nothing to worry about. However, there are a few symptoms that sometimes accompany this condition that you should be aware of. These symptoms include nasal discharge, bloody nose, lethargy, decreased appetite, and breathing difficulty. These signs indicate that there may be something seriously wrong with your dog.<br>  <br>  Treatment<br>  <br>  The best way to handle one of these episodes is to get your dog to swallow. This can be accomplished by pinching his nose briefly or massaging his throat. You can also try giving your dog something to drink or eat. If the episodes occur very frequently, your veterinarian may have to give your dog medications to control them.<br>  <br>  Outlook<br>  <br>  Reverse sneezing in dogs may just be a temporary condition that occurs once then goes away. Other dogs may develop a chronic problem that they have their whole lives. Dogs of any age, sex, or breed can be affected by these episodes.|`|Bk7wmQyfaa	Maybe its something in the house he is allergic too when he sleeps in that area...dogs can get allergic like humans too. find out what it is|`|AA11101806	he probably has allergies to something.   take him to a vet.|`|76b38b2fd5f30d4ab8b90d0f6b190897aa	take him to the vet...<br>  in this way you don't worried and you'll know what he has!!!<br>  <br>  byeee!!!!

Do not put water with it either. They rarely drink and you will end up with a wet Barn Owl, only adding to its troubles.<br>  When you handle the birds make sure you are wearing gloves. I usually get hold of the birds around the legs and lower wings as long as no leg injuries are apparent, keeping them together, but this can take practice, so the best way is with thin leather gloves.... not thick ones otherwise you may squeeze too hard because you cannot feel the bird well enough.<br>  Now keep the room its in quiet and dark and this will reduce stress.<br>  <br>  You now have to call the vet and take it up there. Or call the RSPCA who will collect from you. <br>  Rehabilitating birds of prey is real difficult without the correct knowledge and despite the amount I have had, they always get a visit to the vet before I do anything at all with them.<br>  <br>  Hope this helps!
eyZhiXYpaa	Hi there.  Loads of dogs have 'runs' or 'crates' and there is nothing wrong with this as long as the dog isn't abused and left there all the time (which your dog obviously isn't).<br>  <br>  The dog is trying to get out as he doesn't like it in there.  This means that you have to make him/her WANT to go in there and like it.<br>  <br>  You sound like quite a responsible dog owner anyway but if you haven't tried the following, give it a go:-<br>  <br>  Put plenty of treats in there and hide them so the dog has to sniff them out.  Feed him and water him in there for a few weeks.  Give him his favourite toy in there and play with the dog outside the run and then throw the chew toy into the run and let him bring it to you (with the gate open so they can enter the run and leave as it wants to).<br>  <br>  If a dogs wants out, it will chew away and most runs / crates will eventually get damaged.  I would worry about the dogs teeth though as chewing on metal will create long term problems.<br>  <br>  Try to get the dog to like it.  This is the only thing I can thing of that would eventually work.<br>  <br>  Good luck!|`|hgIyPPb3aa	Try good solid oak and teething toys and tug of war games and plenty of open running.

LOL.|`|MKuDawP7aa	Dogs are not born with soft mouths, but they can learn to bite softly if taught properly, which means plenty of information and communication from you and from other dogs.<br>  <br>  Interacting with other dogs is critical to teaching your puppy bite inhibition. When two dogs play together and one bites too hard, the other one cries and runs away. This behavior helps to teach the biter to play-bite softly.<br>  <br>  Normal puppies can and should play-bite continually in social interactions, because biting and mouthing are normal canine behaviors. Puppies and young adolescent dogs have a physical and psychological need to use their mouths. Remember, dogs use their mouths the way humans use their hands.<br>  <br>  Soft mouth exercises need to begin as soon as you get your new puppy. Puppy teeth are sharp, but their jaws are underdeveloped so these exercises should not be painful to you. When your puppy is mouthing your hand or fingers, monitor their bite pressure. If your puppy bites too hard, screech “OUCH” very loudly and look at your puppy as if she just ripped your hand off. Then leave the room and ignore your puppy for several minutes.<br>  <br>  You need to make a strong impression on your puppy that if she bites too hard, she will end up playing all by herself. Being very social animals, most dogs and puppies will not opt to play by themselves. Be prepared to repeat this exercise over and over again so that a trend emerges…Bite too hard, play by yourself!<br>  <br>  This exercise is even more effective if all the people that come into contact with your puppy implement it with one exception. Young children should never teach soft mouth exercises. When you puppy starts to get overexcited and begins to bite too hard, have your children leave the area so you can do the training.<br>  <br>  When your puppy is consistently demonstrating better self-control, you can start to monitor even the moderate to light pressure bites. Now, if your puppy is putting her mouth on you with even moderate pressure, screech “OUCH,” leave, and ignore her for a few minutes. Then go back and try again.<br>  <br>  Remember, you must give your puppy plenty of outlets for her mouth and jaws. Stuffed Kong toys, frozen wash cloths, chew toys soaked in broth or chicken stock, and tug-of-war games are just a few great ways for your puppy to use her mouth and jaws in an acceptable way. If you say no to one item (your hands or your clothes) you must say yes to another (her toys).<br>  <br>  And always manage your puppy’s behavior. If she is biting and mouthing you excessively, this is a clear signal that she is bored and needs to release some energy. A good dose of aerobic exercise should remedy this. <br>  On a final note, never reinforce your puppy’s biting or mouthy behavior. Your attention, be it scruff shaking, grabbing her snout, or smacking her nose is all reinforcement to your puppy and will make the problem worse.<br>  <br>  Biting is a normal stage that puppies go through, and when properly managed, never needs to become a big issue down the road.

SuAlwdD4aa	The tiny balls are defiently eggs, but crab eggs are extremely hard to hatch in captivity due to their process of maturation, the larvae go out to deeper water to mature and return to shore when they are older. None of my crabs that have had eggs have ever hatched.  If this is a freshwater fiddler crab they need both land and water in their tanks. I used to have some freshwater crabs that would always escape from my tank and i never knew why they wanted out so bad until i read somewhere that the freshwater crabs need some land in their tanks and are very unhappy without it.
mDlxe3DMaa	Yeah their heart usually becomes enlarged. you can see it extend further out from their stomach than usual. they tend to breath heavier and roll over to the side. if they talk different than they did before, you will defiantly know they had a stroke. since it is your bird you will know if the singing is different or if it even becomes more of an effort to sing than before. if they breathe more rapidly after a stroke and their beak is open which is more common after having a stroke.<br>  Keep your bird in a quiet room. I moved mine into the closet and have a light next to their cage, keep your bird calm for a while they will need a couple months or more or so to recoup. especially after having a stroke if spooked or overly excited could relate in a heart attack killing your bird. use your best judgment and dont stress your bird by any means, loud music, or loud noise of any kind, grabbing them or letting them out to fly.|`|Z9kCzIkyaa	could you tell us his symptoms so we can better understand your birds current health? and yoou could go to google..com or yahoo.com and read up on it

VDP3pNCPaa	If your males are not neutered and are sexually mature, that will be a major issue with odor.   I have looked into the Breeze system, and am a bit skeptical.<br>  <br>  However, while I can't give you the answer you may be looking for, if you do make the change, keep the other litter box available.  The Breeze system uses larger particles, and cats can become very picky about their litter, especially if you make a drastic change, and the Breeze system is quite a change.  If they take to the new system, then you are all right.  But if they don't like it, that is real trouble.<br>  <br>  I have multiple cats, and use several different types of scooping litter.  The Arm and Hammer seems to have the best odor control, but I really have little problem unless they decide to not cover.  It is all a matter of scooping out the clumps each day.|`|fe420cf41ead9560ba0cb8531d43ebadaa	I have one and I love it ( or actually my cat does). It's a lot easier to clean than the regular littler litter boxes and I have no odor whatsoever in the area where the box is. Guess it's just a personal preference thing. I got the one I have because I have one cat that cannot go into the basement any longer and he needed a box upstairs and the box is in my bedroom where I definitely did not want odor.|`|AA11398236	You could, but I would also recommend you get a Litter Maid.

The man wiped the dog's butt and tucked the tissue back into his pants pocket... WTF!  I thought the owner was going to pick up after his dog, not pat it's hiney...The dog has to be depressed with this moron owner.<br>  <br>  Good thing you moved on from this guy...you'd probably be wiping HIS butt by now.|`|U1RcZjqJaa	I wipe my female when she is in heat because she would always sit to clean herself and get it on the carpet and when its muddy out I wipe their paws but not like that guy thats obsessive!|`|DhE0rEWiaa	Yes my first English Bulldog I had to wipe his butt after he went poo, I kept a box of unscented baby wipes at the back door and I had to wipe his butt when he was done, he had no tail not shure if that had any thing to do with it he would try to wipe him self on the grass he just could not get him self clean and he could not lick him self, so yes I had to wipe his butt. Better then having him make a mess in my house. <br>  <br>  As Dog owners we have to do what we have to do and to wipe a dogs butt is not gross to me, if you had a baby you would have to wipe the baby when changing so to wipe a dogs butt no different, better to wipe the dog then to have it make a mess in the house then you just have to clean up smeared poo on the floor or rug..I have been cleaning poo off dogs butts for 22 years now so to clean my dog no different.|`|m1lu7CFJaa	I've had to on occassion - but I don't make a habit of it.  Sometimes when our golden has soft stool it can get caught in all of the "feathers" that he has by his butt.  I don't want it on my furniture/carpet so I cleaned it off.  And my other dog just had issues where it would sometimes not fall completely out so we'd have to wipe him then.  On muddy or rainy days I will wipe off the dogs feet when they come in - we have fairly new carpeting.|`|B1UcaukFaa	I have had to with my dog.  Some breeds are very hairy in the rear end and require attention.  Obviiously the guy you dated had other motives.

More so when its muddy, snowy, icy etc etc. To prevent possible infection.|`|KvUJZa1Paa	Being as my dogs are white I do wipe there feet when they come in, this time of year there is alot of snow in our yard and we spread salt on steps and sidewalk so yes we wipe feet, There has been time when we use a pan of warm water and shampoo to wash feet so they don't track mud and snow and to get salt residue off of pads on their feet.<br>  <br>  But to wipe butts, oh heck no
AA11901352	Yes you can apply for a harvesting or salt water product license  in just about every coastal state.  There are guidelines and regulations.  You will also need logs as to what you take, size, creel limits on all.  You need to prove you not only have a place to house these creatures, you will need to prove you are financially able, set up and have the knowledge.  You will also have to be a certified SCUBA diver.  If you are not many states will check your logs monthly.  Any fish you log that is NOT a shallow water fish will earn you a fine.  There are specific harvesting methods.  Taking fish and not logging them will also earn you a fine.  Taking fish endangered or out of the area will earn you a fine.<br>  <br>  There are forms you need to fill out when selling or transfering your marine fish to either suppliers or dealers. (Chain of custody kind of)<br>  <br>  Here is a form you need to fill out if you are in Florida, you will also need your license to do business in the state of Florida prior to filling this out.  Also if you have so much as a parking ticket you had better list it on the application.  You will need to read the first listed to ensure you have all of your endorsements prior to filling out the application.<br>  <a href="http://marinefisheries.org/Docs/SellSaltwaterProducts.pdf" rel="nofollow">http://marinefisheries.org/Docs/SellSalt...</a><br>  <a href="http://marinefisheries.org/Docs/Wholesale-RetailAppP1.pdf" rel="nofollow">http://marinefisheries.org/Docs/Wholesal...</a><br>  <br>  The department of state and the Wild life management in your state will be able to help with the applications and fees associated with the application.  Remember, just because you paid for the application fee doesn't mean you will get one and you do not get your money back.  <br>  <br>  If you are transporting from state to state, you also need a license to do so (even on the internet) for each state you indend to send to.  You also need to know what you can and cannot ship.  <br>  <br>  Your paper work will need to be complete for not only the IRS, but the state (for taxes) your sales and ship to records for the Wild life Commission.<br>  <br>  Every state is different.  It isn't as simple to just go diving catch some cridders and sell them.  Salt water fish have a chain of custody up until retail sales.  <br>  <br>  Don't try to dodge the IRS or the wildlife commish since if you have too many deaths from caught wildlife, they will pull your license in a heartbeat.<br>  <br>  Hope this helps|`|A4G03Bzbaa	Yes there is but good luck getting one.  They dont just hand those out to people who want them.|`|sbWz5qyRaa	Contact your state's Department of Land and Natural Resources (DLNR).|`|86b135e0c5c7fa8152fab546e88b509caa	Depends what country you are in.<br>  <br>  Most councils and governments will not (hopefully) give out such licences to any old person who applies however, you'd need to be a licenced pet store or wholesaler I would imagine for starters. It's because of people taking fish out of the sea for the pet trade that so many are now endangered, including the ever popular Bangai Cardinalfish.<br>  <br>  Rather than lending to the decline of wild populations, maybe help with conservation efforts and captive breeding programs. Bangais breed readily in captivity and have been saved in that respect for the pet trade. Whereas others like some Angelfish can be exceptionally difficult to breed and rear in captivity.|`|32ed2884882d13680bd2f9e8ee367fc9aa	yes there is<br>  <br>  why would you want to do this?  take them out of their habitat and have them stuck in some tiny tank where they die and suffocate<br>  <br>  better yet get into breeding saltwater fish in captivity and let the wild population alone

3fcf101a2615a631d556e32ec980eae0aa	Extra time you have needs to be devoted to training these dogs (that will give them the attention and structure they are craving.)  Make sure they are getting a decent amount of exercise along with the mental stimulation to cut down on boredom...which leads to destructive behaviors.<br>  <br>  Crate the one that wants to chew and potty everywhere when you can not directly monitor him.  And make it clear to the female that nipping is absolutely unacceptable.  A firm no and stopping the attention she is getting should help her learn (ie. turn your back and leave the room.)|`|o92SOJpWaa	well if you have time u can take them to a pet smart and they have a training system there . or i not shure if this costs money or not but you can try to call dog whisper or just watch dog whisper and try some of his tichniques|`|OxFsslN8aa	It sounds like your dogs could use some exercise, boundaries & limitations.  I know you are busy with a baby but if there is any way to get your dogs regular walks, it would work wonders to getting a handle on the other problems.  Give your dogs boundaries and limitations by not allowing them to roam the whole house.  Keep them in the kitchen if you cannot watch them & ensure that they are pooping and peeing outside.  <br>  <br>  One thing that makes me nervous is that you think your female dog "doesn't do anything wrong, she just nips people here and there".  This is a huge red flag.  What happens if she nips your 3 month old son in the face?  You let them sniff him and you never shoo them away if they seem interested.  One wrong noise or jerky movement from your son & the dogs could bite.  Dogs are very wary of small children because they cannot predict movements and they cannot discern what to make of all the noises.  When dogs correct other dogs or fight, they go right for the face - that is where they often bite small children as well.|`|moIPv7pFaa	The dogs see the baby as an intruder; not one of the pack. Its very common for dogs to act out if a new person is brought into the living situation without being properly introduced. You should've started treating the dogs differently as soon as you knew you were pregnant. Now they're confused because all of the sudden things have changed DRASTICALLY. You may have to give them to someone else to take care of, at least until you have time for them. Contact a trainer in your area to see if they can help out.|`|Imn5oOWiaa	treat your dogs as if they were your 2 older kids.. <br>  You wouldn't want your other kids feeling left out because of a new baby would you?<br>  Try to make an equal amount of attention to both of the dogs. take them outside, let them lay on ur lap, play catch with them.. take everyone outside to run around.|`|O6SBsgO8aa	Totally Jealous----------They need the attention they were getting before and with a new baby, you cant do that.

I'm actually between clients right now, so I have a little break.|`|AA12128656	well- the dog should no longer have run of the house if he is eliminating inside. he should be crated when not immediately supervised.<br>  part of the problem was the abrupt change in the attention they received. it should have been a bit more gradual. the male is having a hard time adjusting to the fact that he's not the pack baby anymore. he became loving to you and sat by you all the time, now he can't do that.  <br>  <br>  do crate the dog, and have him earn his house privelages.<br>  <br>  it's a good time to bundle baby up in the stroller and take the dogs for a walk too, because he needs some exercise to help get out all this extra energy, instead of using it for destroying your house.|`|m72ZD6AJaa	Unfortunately, treating your dogs like babies creates destructive behavior; they are not babies, they are companions, and they need a structured home environment to thrive. You have broken the structure and have not repaired it for them, creating hateful, jealous and angry dogs that are acting out to get any kind of attention they can (and yes, nipping is still aggression and should be taken VERY seriously). Your situation will require you to spend more time correcting the problem than if you had properly trained them to begin with, and it is going to be harder with the occupancy of a newborn. <br>     You need to retrain your dogs to be respectful, and to know their place in your family. You are alpha, not them, and the behavior both dogs are exhibiting is unacceptable. However, you need to be respectful as well, and take the time to train them in a way that will produce a well-mannered, well-behaved family member, not in a way that will add fear to the already awful mix of emotions. I recommend the book "How to train a puppy you can live with", it is available on Amazon.com for cheap, used, and it uses methods that are positive, non-cruel, and that work.
TpOVmqpHaa	In many cases it can be left alone.  Less frequently the blood supply may 'die', or ulcerations/infections may pose a risk to the health of the dog, in which case removal is necessary.  Only your vet can tell you for sure.|`|342b3711423c978836fa192cef3238d8aa	You need to ask the vet who saw your dog this question.|`|AA12128656	definitely ask your vet. we can't examine the dog, nor are most of us vets.|`|9kTejB0uaa	This is one for your vet as he alone will be able to look at her, and recommend your best option.  If she's in pain (glaucoma for example, is a painful condition), it's probably best to remove the eye.  Don't stress if this is the recommended option - we had a hound who, right from the moment her eyes opened as a puppy, had a cloudy eye.  No treatment worked and it blew up into a horrible mess.  Removal of the eye was the only option and it was then discovered that she had an abscess right at the back of the eye - very rare.  She never had the use of that eye mind you, but apart from turning her head round more than normal, she lived a full and happy life with her one eye.|`|bIaywrBCaa	There should be no reason to remove the eye unless it is cancerous.

l0ktQUnWaa	It is not illegal to own an RES turtle. There are some laws about selling them. I have included a link for that information.<br>  Does the turtle have recurring respiratory infections? This could be a Herpes virus that really can't be treated. It is basically a cold that will keep coming back, although it can lessen with time. You can take your turtle to a dog/cat vet and explain the situation. They may not be able to do much, but they should be able to get you antibiotics to try. <br>  <br>  Edit: Here is a link with a lot of health information.<br>  Hope it helps!<br>  <a href="http://www.anapsid.org/mainhealth.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.anapsid.org/mainhealth.html</a><br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.redearslider.com/legal.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.redearslider.com/legal.html</a><br>  <br>  Good luck with him!|`|HdqicK0gaa	i've never heard of a state where its illegal to own a turtle unless its lik extremely endangered but maybe u could lik do an internet search on what to do
cnZlMojUaa	My dog was spayed about the same time. No bleeding, no problems.<br>  <br>  I don't know how your dog came into season after spay surgery. The spay prevents the dog from having any more heat cycles. Trust your gut instincts on this. If you are questioning the vet, please take her to another vet. You should be able to get her records transferred. You could also request a consultation with an internal medicine vet. This sounds like a case that might be out of your vet's specialty area. Good luck. I can tell this is really stressing you out. It is hard when our beloved dogs are sick.<br>  <br>  Personally, if the dog is being affected by a tick bite that causes hemorrhaging, I would be very concerned about putting the dog under for an exploratory surgery.|`|TCqrS8Vqaa	hiya, some think wrong there.take the dog  back to the vets asap.|`|9kTejB0uaa	Get away from this butcher of a vet as fast as you can!

6SeWCfUfaa	See I wouldn't call that "dominant" I'd call that untrained puppy.   Right now, the pup is a blank slate, he doesn't really know what you expect of him, so he's just going with what's fun and feels good.  There's nothing dominant about that.  But you do want to start shaping his behavior.<br>  <br>  With puppies, our pups want to be with us all the time.  You can use that to your advantage.  If the pup starts to play to rough, tell them no, if they go back to doing what they were just doing like you didn't say anything at all, put them in their crate for 3-5 Min's.  When they come back out, if they do that rough playing again, "no" then back to the crate.  And when they're playing by YOUR rules, they get to stay and play.  It's a powerful tool and very affective with a puppy this age.  <br>  <br>  Do the same with the humping. If the pup humps, tell it no, if it continues to try, crate for 3-5 Min's.  If it comes back trying to hump, back to the crate for 3-5 mins.  Pretty soon, humping will become not a lot of fun for the pup.<br>  <br>  Demanding food - start making the dog WORK for it's kibble.  Seriously, you can teach a lot of sit, and down and roll over, even at 8 weeks while making a puppy work for dinner.  People always ask how my puppies are so well trained by 16 weeks, and this is why.  They work for every kibble from the time I get them.  I teach them everything from sit and wait, to give me kisses during meal times.  And they love it.  It's one on one bonding time with you ... with food!!  Life doesn't get any better than that for a puppy.<br>  <br>  Keep at it, but remember that the pup knows NOTHING.  You'll have to teach it EVERYTHING.  And right now it's a little sponge that will soak up everything you teach it.  Including harsh treatment, so avoid that.<br>  <br>  Good luck!!|`|eyZhiXYpaa	I am a poodle owner (a toy and a miniature pup) and this is totally normal behavior. Pups start to hump things straight away whether they are dominant or not, it is natural - getting him neutered will help with this (when he is around 6 months old - i.e. best time to neuter).<br>  <br>  Just make sure that you follow training methods for the nipping, i.e. generally ignore bad bahavior and walk away and reward good behavior.|`|lqt3wTQvaa	you just need to show that you are number 1...the dog doesnt run your life, you run the dogs..you're the Alpha...you just need to show that to you dog by firm handling and training...dont cater to your dog|`|AA11244754	Yes, his humping is a dominance thing, but one of the things you could do (and I'm sure that I will get some thumbs down for this one) is leave his food out all the time, then that way it will make him feel more secure and also consult your vet about getting him neutered.  Some vet's might not want to at this age but it is safe to (I am assuming that he has his little testes already) because neutering along with training will go a long way in that.  Until he gets neutered, just gently kick him off you leg and have your guests do the same thing and this goes for the biting and pulling on the clothes too.  When you refuse to let him hump tell him in a firm voice "no" or "down" and be consistant.  When he does this reward him with a small treat and lavish praise.|`|OxFsslN8aa	First of all at 8 weeks of age male dogs are simply doing what comes naturally & they have little idea why they hump things.  Have your dog neutered at 6 months of age to help with this.  <br>  <br>  For the barking and demanding food, you should be eating first.  The alpha wolf in the pack always eats first.  Your dog needs to see you eat first and then when the dog is sitting calmly & submissively you should feed him.  If you feed him when he barks then he is controlling you & you lose your position as the leader.  I would also suggest that you are the first to come in and go out of the door and you teach him to heel so that you lead on walks.  In every aspect of his life, you need to lead him.
G3cLz9GXaa	Kudos for asking a very important question!<br>  <br>  My first suggestion is to thoroughly research each breed so you know what to expect.  Each breed will have its own requirements for grooming and care.  You also need to be familiar with possible health problems or issues to watch for and how to handle them. The long ears require at a minimum weekly ear cleaning to help prevent infection.  Familiarize yourself with bloat.  In deep chested dogs this is always a risk and it is an emergency.<br>  <br>  The Breeder<br>  Find a breeder that you can actually go to their house and see the set up.  On the internet you have no idea what the set up is or the care of the parents have been. I have a rescue who came from a so called breeder. (More like puppy miller that I turned in to animal control.) Her ears were infected and had to be flushed out before they could be treated.  She also lost 10 teeth and is only 7 1/2.  She was thin because she couldn't eat.<br>  <br>  Plan to spend a few hours with the breeder. Ask questions  and go with a list.  A reputable breeder will answer your questions willingly and be available to answer any questions before and long after you take your new puppy home.  You need to know there breeding philosophy.  Most don't breed the dam more than once a year. Meet the sire and dam if both are on site and interact/observe them.  Seeing the parent's personality will give you some idea of the pups personality...though it is not a guarantee.  Ask to see the parent's registration papers don't just go by the breeder' word.  Also ask about the pups socialization.  They need to be socialized with humans and not just left in a kennel area with little human contact.<br>  <br>  The Puppies<br>  Please don't go and just point at a pup.  Interact with all of them.  You may go with a couple of pups in mind and pick a completely different one. But don't be surprised if the breeder has you remove your shoes.   You can carry many illnesses in that can be devastating to pups.  You also want to ask about the puppies health history especially any illness, shots, medications,  the worming schedule and what they use.<br>  <br>  When you decide on a pup a reputable breeder will have you sign a contract.  There should be a 1st option clause that states in the event you can't keep the puppy no matter what age the breeder has the 1st option of getting the puppy back.  Don't be alarmed, a good breeder never wants one of the pups abused or placed in a shelter. There will more than likely be a spay/neuter clause as well among other things.  Read the contract thoroughly.  A good contract has the best interests of the puppies foremost.<br>  If at all possible visit with the puppy if it will be a while before you get to take them home.  Most breeder will not let them go until they are at minimum 8 weeks but they make be 10-12 weeks.  That time is needed and so important for the pups socialization within the litter.<br>  <br>  When you take your new puppy home be sure to get him/her to the vet within the time frame that was set up in the contract.  A good rule is to make the appointment a couple of weeks before you bring your pup home or as soon as you get the puppy.  Also puppy proof your home before you bring the pup home.  Things we take for granted can cause huge problems for inquisitive chewing pups.  Set up a safe area for your pup be it a crate of pen set up.  The pup needs to be kept safe when you can't keep eagle eyes on them or you are away. <br>  <br>  The Vet<br>  Please make sure that the vet is very familiar with the breed you chose.  Meaning that they see them regularly in their practice.  I can't stress this enough.  You don't know how many vets that will do unecessary surgery on a basset hounds legs when there is nothing wrong with them.  If the vet is not a 24 hour vet then familiarize yourself with the ER Vet and keep their number and address posted.  You never know when an emergency  will happen.  Somewhat like when you have children.<br>  <br>  Pet Insurance<br>  Yes it is an extra expense but can be sooooo worth the money.  Those little trips to the ER vet are expensive.<br>  <br>  Very Important Advice<br>  Remember that cute little puppy grows up into an adult and loses some of the "cuteness".  Any time you consider taking a new pet into you home you to commit yourself to the lifetime of that pet.  That means from puppyhood through the senior years.  I can't stress this enough.  As a member of basset rescue you don't how many seniors are just dumped or taken to the pound because they are "old".  It breaks my heart as I have two seniors in my home and would never give them up.  The seniors are many times passed over and pounds will kill them because they are old.  So please the commitment to care for your new pup for the rest of their lives including when they are gray, slower in their walk and less energetic than a pup.  Also join a group online of people that have the same breed.  I belong to the Daily Drool which is a basset group.  They are a great resource for questions and concerns and|`|eyZhiXYpaa	You can usually find reputable breeders through the internet.

AA11901352	There are a number of reasons partial water changes are needed.  First off changing part of the water allows the removal of toxic items in the water from the fish waste.  Water changes are needed to remove elevated nitrates (even ammonia and nitrites that are produced thru fish waste and decaying uneaten foods)<br>  <br>  Second, partial water changes replace much needed minerals to the tank.  Fish absorb the minerals from the water they live in.  Not changing the water does not replace these needed minerals that the fish need.<br>  <br>  <br>  Understand what is clean to you and me is not a clean environment for fish.  What you don't see are the colonies of good bacteria that have established in the tank.  These bacteria break down fish waste (ammonia toxic) thru the nitrogen cycle and turn it into nitrates a less toxic chemical.<br>  By cleaning the entire tank you are ridding the tank of this bacteria.  Now that the bacteria is gone there is nothing in the tank to break down the fish waste causing the ammonia to spike to unsafe levels and either killing, injuring or burning your fish.<br>  <br>  You should be on a schedule of no more than 25% weekly water change.  The filter can be rinsed  only to remove build up of uneaten foods and gunk and replaced.  Tap water contains not only heavy metals bur more than 160 chemicals, many of which are harmfull to your fish.  The filter doesn't need to be CLEAN to be effective or to do its job.  Even the filter media can remain in the filter for months and does not need to be changed unless it is falling apart.<br>  <br>  Nothing more than the 25% weekly never the entire tank.<br>  <br>  Here is a good link that will explain why it is important not to empty and clean the entire tank.<br>  <br>  <a href="http://freshaquarium.about.com/cs/biologicalcycle/a/nitrogencycle.htm" rel="nofollow">http://freshaquarium.about.com/cs/biolog...</a>|`|qeOlkRM0aa	A complete water change will shock your fish. There is no way you can make fresh water that has the identical properties as the water in your tank. You may also remove some of the nitrifying bacteria.<br>  Cleaning your filter with tank water, will clean the gunk out, but not kill the needed bacteria that breaks down fish waste. Tap water will kill it.|`|NBfBKI1Uaa	Doing a 100% water change will not in way affect the amount of beneficial bacteria. The nitrifying bacteria require surface to attach themselves and is never found free swimming. <br>  <br>  We only do partial water change to keep the chemistry of the tank as stable as possible. Doing a large water change will not only remove nitrates but also many essential mineral needed for the survival of the fishes. It is more important to maintain stable water chemistry than replenish all the essential elements and get rid off all your nitrates, nitrites and ammonia.<br>  <br>  Tap water contain chloramine and that can easily kill the bacteria the filter media is washed in the tap water.

But then there is nothing wrong with washing it in chloramine or chlorine free water.<br>  <br>  <br>  -rds|`|AHEFXgE7aa	You're thinking like a human, and not a fish.  Human water is not fit for fish. If you change all the water it will look clean but stress out the fish, and maybe even kill it.  The filter had good bacteria the fish needs, so cleaning it out will kill it.  You don't really need to scrape off the algae, only if you want a clean looking tank.  The fish will be fine with regular feedings.<br>  <br>  Cheers|`|eyZhiXYpaa	You should never do a complete 100% water change as this will kill your fish.<br>  <br>  You should also always used a tap safe chemical with your tap water to make it safe to use in your water change.<br>  <br>  Partial water changes are there to freshen the water for the fish without getting rid of all the good bacteria that they need.<br>  <br>  I think you need to read a book about fish.  I am suprise you still have fish that are alive.|`|3bf821ff353c216ffc93ff7a91b60828aa	Why go through the trouble of changing all the water out instead of just 25% each week?  That's more work then just a little bit every week :)  <br>  Too large of a water change, and the temperature and the ph will most likely be off, which will send the fish into shock.  <br>  <br>  You rinse the filter media in used tank water, because there's beneficial bacteria growing on it.  If you rinse it in the tap, and you're on public water supply, the chlorine and chloramines will kill off the bacteria, causing your tank to go through another cycle process.  See link for more info on that:<br>  <br>  <a href="http://freshaquarium.about.com/cs/biologicalcycle/a/nitrogencycle.htm" rel="nofollow">http://freshaquarium.about.com/cs/biolog...</a><br>  <br>  You can scrape the algae if you want to.  Not all plecos eat the same type of algae.  Guppies generally aren't algae eaters, they may nibble on some, but they won't keep the tank clean of it.|`|DU7iO8EHaa	Partial water changes are a lot better. If you do a full water change it takes out the good bacteria. Then you pretty much have to start over with cycling your tank. <a href="http://www.kokosgoldfish.com/cycle.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.kokosgoldfish.com/cycle.html</a> You need to scrape algae off the surface of the water, but not the sides and decorations.|`|QjKJdFhwaa	go to google and resaech fishtank cycle and do alot of reseach berfore and after u do something.|`|86b135e0c5c7fa8152fab546e88b509caa	A 100% water change and/or cleaning your filter in tap water will kill off good bacteria within your substrate and filter media meaning your tank will be unstable and you're liable to have an ammonia spike and that will kill your fish.<br>  <br>  Small partial water changes keep parameters stable and stop spikes such as this.<br>  <br>  Keeping a fish tank is not keeping fish at all, but keeping bacteria and water. The bacteria and water will then keep your fish.<br>  <br>  What kind of Pleco? What "kissing guppies" - do you mean Guppies or Gouramis? Not all Plecos will eat algae and even algae eaters will only eat some soft algae - not tough algae like green spot or hair algae nor toxic slime algae.|`|bDPVRtCNaa	Logic tells me that removing everything takes away beneficial bacteria that breaks down fish waste. 100% water changes means that fish will be stressed when taken from the tank and suffer from high levels of ammonia every time you change the water.<br>  <br>  Partial water changes keep the cycle going. Ammonia-Nitrite-Nitrate-You remove the nitrate. The fish can stay in the aquarium, and the process shouldn't take more than twenty minutes.<br>  <br>  Washing the filter under the tap mean chlorine is running through it. Chlorine kills bacteria, including the bacteria that you need.<br>  <br>  ~Scrape algae from all panes except for the back. Yes your fish need food, but you should be supplying them with flakes, algae wafers, and fresh vegetables. You can't depend on the algae produced by your tank. You really don't want algae, it means that ammonia, and nitrates are built up in your tank.

Tetras kept in good quality water can live several years, and I've had angelfish that lived 5 years or longer.

They are semi aggressive, and so much fun. They come right to the glass when I put my face next to the tank. You can add other types of barbs to give it a community look. I have Rosy barbs in with mine, as well as a red tail shark & some Opaline gouramis. Just make sure you have lots of hiding places & large enough tank. Mine is a 46 gallon.
ijvWMbxVaa	Ive read you should have the temperature 75 to 82oF. Also you should make sure that the filter is low current, because bettas are weak swimmers. I suggest that you add 1 tsp of aquarium salt per gallon of water, to kill any diseases that might occur. The color change is probably due to stress. Good luck!|`|BMri9tITaa	It's not because it has a filter in the tank!  Filter in the tank is good!<br>  <br>  Bettas make themselves look bigger and brighter in order to scare off potential invaders to their territory.  We call this "flaring."  In the wild, bettas are born ordinary green and brown.  They only turned into the bright colors we prize when they "flared," although we were eventually able to breed them so that they were their flaring colors all the time (like that blue you like).  Most likely the original color change, turning red, was due to your betta flaring.<br>  <br>  A couple of questions:<br>  <br>  1) Did you cycle your guy's tank before you added him in?<br>  2) Did you treat the water at all?  If you didn't add dechlorinator, he may be getting sick from the chemicals in the water.  Try adding a dechlorinator if you haven't.  I use TetraSafe, although any of them are good.  You can buy one at any pet store or fish store.  Add the recommended dose (usually 5-10 tbs) near where the filter goes out, this will allow the dechlorinator to spread faster.<br>  3) How often are you feeding him?  You should only be feeding him sparingly, once a day or once every other day.  If you've been feeding him more often, try not feeding him for a little while, and in a few days, give him a shelled, uncooked pea to aid in his digestion.<br>  4) How big is his tank?  If it's only a bowl or a gallon tank, you may want to upgrade to a slightly larger tank (2 or 5 gallons, or somewhere in between).<br>  <br>  It may just be a general infection.  If you can, try taking a picture of him and showing him to someone at your local pet store, who knows bettas and fish really well.  They may be able to give you a better diagnosis.|`|CnTKZns1aa	maybe it changes colour when what kinda mood it is in<br>  <br>  Depends on what food your feeding him|`|d8qGTIIgaa	camoflague
IddUYNR3aa	Are you sure it's a male? This behavior sounds like a female in heat. Or there could be a female in heat nearby.

Sounds more like a female in heat.  If he/ or she is not fixed I would get that done ASAP.  I sounds like something to do with that.  If not, it could be a sign of a UTI or other condition.  It's better to make sure its not something serious because even a UTI can lead to death without treatment.|`|xarKlp0Oaa	He is probably just trying to get your attention and would like you to pet him. It doesn't seem like a big deal.|`|h7ftvB9waa	Oh that is because it wants some love and it is in love with another cat.|`|ArKT9O7Maa	He probably is asking for attention.  just rub his back and he's probably calm down.  My cat does the same thing even though she is older.  Except my cat lays on her side and makes me rub her belly.
J2UTO39vaa	So- my hubby and I went through this same question 2 weeks ago. We settled on a Basset Hound because we have 2 young children. Bassets are an extremely loving dog, intelligent, calm and tolerent (plus get along well with other pets- especially cats).<br>  <br>  Golden Retrievers are more family oriented from what I've seen (my brother has one and a friend I have, has a boxer). The boxers seem to be more hyper and aggressive..... but it can depend on the owners, too, I'm sure.<br>  <br>  It may help to look up the profile of both breeds which will tell you temperment.<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.dogbreedinfo.com/purebred.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.dogbreedinfo.com/purebred.htm</a>|`|igrMkjU2aa	The Boxer is one the best breeds to have for a family pet. The Golden Retrievers are good to, but they are not outside dogs. It really depends on your home enviroment and how much time you have. Dobermens may not be the best breed for a family.|`|nSGd2Pv1aa	doberman and golden retrievers are the best family dogs out of the three. Boxers are gentle but kinda dumb (that's my experience). Golden retrievers are smart, high energy and gentle. Dobermans are loyal.|`|QhO7jIkDaa	Papillions are the best dogs... i know they are small dogs and a lot of people dont like small dogs but this breed is really nice!|`|XxTQIoBkaa	hello<br>  <br>  i would recoment a cocker spaniel a english/working type, i own one she is 4 mont old and full of engery but knows when to be calm she is very intelligent and loyal ad her tail is always wagging! she is happy all the time loves cuddlesand snuggles up in bed wth you on a night. house training is brilliant and is renowend in the breed forlearning quickly and easily..<br>  <br>  how ever i live in england and i dont know what american cockers are like<br>  <br>  xxx|`|r9wVJXJsaa	if you want a hyper family dog i would get a shelty i have one and untill he turned 10 he was the most hyper dog ever and the breed is great with familys sooo good luck with your pet|`|jyGTlpzTaa	I wouldnt call Dobermans hyper (or is it Dobermen, never got that), out of those the boxer is most hyper. I would rate retrievers and boxers as better family dogs, the dobermans I have met are more one-person dogs, but you really could count on them to protect your family members, whereas boxers might do a warning bark (and because they are big with short noses people would probably respect them), but really they are fluffy teddies.<br>  <br>  Please bear in mind all of those are high energy dogs that will need a LOT of walking.<br>  <br>  If you have those breeds I'd expect you to either have a big house and garden, or capable of doing a good few hours of walking daily, not to mention training. Dobermans are quite dominant dogs, you will need experience to train those guys correctly, bear that in mind.<br>  <br>  I'd go with a boxer if you can keep up with the walkies and afford the vets fees (they are not the healthiest of breeds).|`|RjyNInW6aa	Well if you don't mind me saying so I advise you to get a mutt. The shelter dogs are normally better dogs than the ones from breeders. My friend has a mutt who is so active he only sleeps at night and doesn't nap during the day. Well that is als because they have a blue-tick coon hound puppy which I discourage you not to get. But if you insist I say a boxer they are normally more protective of there families.
Qe04KxYoaa	Don't worry as they are still with the mom until they are 8 weeks and at that age can start on the vaccines you should not have a problem. OH you got her from a bad breeder than take her to the vet and ask them what they think you should do. You will need to establish a good relationship with your vet anyway so start now.|`|8ivnzNi5aa	Just bear with it until you can have the beastie vaccinated.  Good luck with it. That seemed to work with my American Eskimo.|`|aCqSF87Raa	What about a garage? Basement? <br>  <br>  It won't be long before you can take her out, so even paper training right now won't really stick in her mind. Normally i detest them, but I would use Wee Wee pads as they DO look and feel different than newspaper: it'll be easier to totally get rid of them as opposed to newspaper (which you may accidentally leave lying around later on.)<br>  <br>  Best way to do is is just line wherever she is with them and not let her out of that area. Don't praise for the potty when she goes, just clean it up. Then when she can go out just get rid of them and put her on a "potty schedule" and take her out often and praise a LOT for any business done outside.<br>  <br>  You've only got a few more weeks - we were told we could bring our dog into our yard after her second injections, which was at three months old i believe.|`|24CFl7sjaa	Keep the crate in the room nearest the exit door, section it off or if it is a large crate get a small cat box as a sleeping area that the dog can get into. Paper the rest of the crate for the accidents that will happen overnight. Put paper down next to the exit door, when your pup is out of the crate and looking to pee, run it to the exit door paper. When you let your pup out of the crate the first place you should go is to the exit door paper.  This encourages the pup to go to one specific area to wee etc and when you can finally get the dog out she will be used to running to the exit door so you will know that she needs to go. When pups are tiny its a good idea to feed them in their crates as they will want to go within 10 to 20 minutes of eating, so you can scoop her up and get her to the right area with minimum fuss.<br>  Good luck and enjoy your pup!|`|hKVOw1Sjaa	You obviously took the risk of having a puppy under 8 weeks of age so you have absolutely no choice but teach the puppy on paper and it is easy to transfer from one to a crate.you can divide the crate in two sections so the pup has sleeping section at the back and at the front leave newspaper for her so if desperate during the night she can wee there.l start crate training my puppies before they are sold so new owners end up with a crate trained puppy,nearly completely toilet trained and also in emergency will use paper overnight.l am sure you understand why you cannot take your puppy onto the pavements as until she has had ALL her shots she is not immunized against the diseases like distemper,parvo and especially kennel cough.Remember that despite getting the first shots she is Still not covered as the vet will explain to you as it takes up to 14 days to take effect so please bear that in mind instead of rushing out the door and onto the streets with a puppy which is still able to contract diseases.|`|J5C3WKxfaa	not much you can do, just make sure she is let out a lot to go on the paper, you must remember she is only 7 weeks so her bladder ain't very big so accidents will happen, its only for another week before you can take her out.<br>  <br>  btw a puppy should never leave the mother until 8 weeks, they learn from there mum even though they are weaned they stillshould be with her
Amkmles0aa	gave your cat 7 more days if your cat is doing it then then its vet time|`|SLSX6QQsaa	The first thing you should do is check his mouth for anything that might be bothering him.  Look everywhere, including his teeth (look for brown spots and signs of decay) and around his gums and roof of his mouth.  If there's nothing there, you could take him to the vet to have him checked over by a professional but I might not bother with it if hes eating and drinking fine.  Drooling is a sign of pain in some cats, usually some kind of oral pain.  I had a cat who lived to be 27 and he was quite the drool-er.  He would drool a puddle if I pet him or cuddled him.  He did it because he was just so happy he couldn't help it.  There's nothing you can do, and you shouldn't want to.  It means he's just so, so, happy :)  Sometimes I would set a towel under his face on my shirt or wherever he was sitting because I didn't want a  big drool spot on it lol|`|R4Ij1u0Baa	One of my kitties used to drool a lot when he was happy. He once even blew a bubble of drool. He eventually stopped, but it was cute in a way. My other cat who is around 14 years old started to drool because he was missing teeth. But my guess is because he is really happy and loves you heaps, just get a tissue or put him on a towel so you don't get drool everywhere lol.|`|DIihJrUiaa	It's quite usual for cats to drool when they are happy and purring, some cats are more slobbery than others! If the drooling is constant, it might be worth a trip to the vet to rule out any problems.|`|GSkA8wh9aa	It could be a bad tooth or poisoning. Or it could be he's so happy and relaxed that he forgets to swallow. You don't mention if he's acting normal, eating and all.
hKVOw1Sjaa	Most of the larger breeds cannot conceive till around th 14th to 18th day of their season (heat)  so depending when your boy got to her it could only have been a few days before you caught them as if she has conceived she would not allow him to mate her..The temperature rule is mot proofpositive but a good indication.Are you feeding her extra meals then usual as a pregnant female need sfar more food then usual so her tumy noises may be from hunger as you cannot hear the pups this way.Feel her abdomen and see if she has 'dropped' at all and that means her bulge seems to be larger now towards her rear end and closer to her vagina..Some people use the method if they will not eat in the morning they will not have the litter that day,false idea,l have had females eat a super breakfast and 4 hours later give birth.All you can do is watch her carefully and as soom as she breaks water  you know pups are going to arrive any moment.The time between pups being born should be no longer than around one and half to two hours so if she has a pup and you make sure it is out of the sac,breathing and helped it suckle on a teat and nothing happens despite her having contractions worry re time period above as you made have a breach birth or to you a puppy stuck or in the wrong position to be born and that for you is a vet job.have your vet's ph no handy with you at all times just in case you have to call for directions or help.<br>  If you think the due date is March10 you better hope she does not have early labour as she will lose the puppies it is too early as the time frame could not be right or your arithmetic is not correct.My advice if you are really worried and there is any discharge that concerns you is to take her to your vet and he will tell you how close she is to having pups.Good luck|`|bIaywrBCaa	Sometimes their temp will drop and it really has nothing to do with the labor. March 10 is still 18 days away so that would be very early, even say if she was bred a week earlier. It is probably nothing. Just watch her and if anything seems wrong, take her to the vet.
3p6wp7DYaa	Neutering him might help is you haven't already done so. Around 60% of male dogs stop spraying after they are neutered. Other than that, you need to clean up the spots with some specially formulated enzymatic cleaner and keep the dog on a crate overnight until the habit is broken. Remember, dogs are creatures of habit and if you don't change the pattern somehow, he will never stop.
MstjbpVJaa	Now is the time for them to start nest site hunting,so they will be off house hunting in likely places,any where,gardens local woods,etc.<br>  <br>  Also if there are any insects coming out they prefer them to food from feeders.<br>  <br>  They "Will" be back.|`|6g1MUG5xaa	migrate<br>  <br>  <br>  |¨¨¨¨¨¨¨¨¨¨¨¨¨¨¨¨¨¨¨¨¨¨¨¨¨¨¨¨¨---<br>  |-----------2 Points--------|||"|""\__<br>  |__________________|||_|___|)<<br>  !(@)'(@)""""**!(@)(@)****!(@)|`|S07eHvdSaa	Birds in some parts of the world have started to migrate and this may be the answer to your question however, if birds are migrating out of your area some birds should be migrating into your area.  So keep your feeders up.<br>  <br>  Another reason may be you have a cat or other predator stalking your feeder.  Placement of your feeder is important.  Birds should have a high perch above your feeder to look for predators.  They should also have a place to hide if  a predator shows up while they are feeding.   A bush or a brush pile would offer the birds protection.|`|t3G5xSbIaa	they've gone south hun or maybe its matin season or somthin they'll be back dw|`|JOfW3U5taa	migration :)|`|Z9kCzIkyaa	migrationnn...
3p6wp7DYaa	I personally do not see the point in teaching a dog to pee and poop indoors. Besides the confusion and possibility for accidents in the carpet, you and the dog will miss out in some pretty essential parts of a canine's life, like socializing with other dogs and walking together.<br>  <br>  I can see your rational for teaching her this, but you have to realize that the problem here is that she is not housebroken yet. No dog needs to have a "backup" plan for his toilet needs unless it is sick. If you properly housebreak this dog, you won't need to teach her to use the litter box. If you want the dog to go to the bathroom both outdoors and indoors, you will really have a hard time with the training as dogs don't generalize well and they cannot perceive fine differences such as it is ok to pee inside the house, but only inside this box.<br>  <br>  That said, I imagine litter box training should be the same as housebreaking. You keep the dog confined to a crate at all times, and just take her out to use the litter box. When she does what you want, you praise and treat every time until she learns the drill.|`|YUQgyPT3aa	You are just going to confuse her by telling her its ok to do her business in the house.  You need to take her out and stay out until she goes.  If she goes in the house, take her right back outside.  She will never catch on if you don't stick to it. <br>  <br>  good luck<br>  <br>  EDIT: Just because something is "available" to purchase, doesn't make it a good idea....|`|z2TjjnxVaa	Just the same way that you would train a dog to go outside. It requires patience, some dogs are slower than others.  Every time she goes in the house you have to pick her up and put her in the litter box. I know quite a  few people that do use this method, or they use those fake grass boxes.|`|FcwS0jBUaa	its going to be harder to train your dog to go inside and outside. but its not impossible. First it sounds like she doing good with the outside, but she get confused with the green carpet. It will take time for her to reconize the difference between the outdoors and indoors , but they usually figure that out on their own. For training her for the litter box , everytime she goes to the bathroom on the floor, spank her , tell her "no" and then proceed to put her in the litter box. Associate the litter box with a word like "potty". This may take a while but it will work.|`|HNturDtkaa	Sorry, but training a dog to use a litter box is ludicrous! Because it's small doesn't make it a cat. You have a real dog, please treat it as one. Potty training a dog is very easy if you reward-not punish. A dog at 4 months, untrained, can't be trusted to run the house unsupervised for several reasons. The dogs' safety being #1. You must also teach independence.At this stage I would suggest going to your local library and get books on puppy training. I love dogs much more than people, so please learn to give your dog the training it deserves to be a good citizen even if it's just in your home.|`|eyZhiXYpaa	Hi, cats are independent, dogs are not.  Maybe you should have got a cat.  Dogs are also not really litter users either but it is possible to train a dog to use one.  All you need to do is research (i.e. google) on how to paper train your dog and instead of using newspaper, use the litter.  Dogs are much messier than cats and so I can imagine you will have litter all over the place in a matter of weeks.<br>  <br>  I would just concentrate on training your dog not to poop and wee in the house at all and take it outside (which is the usual method for dogs).<br>  <br>  If you don't feel you have the time to be taking your dog out for walks etc. or to go to the toilet, you shouldn't have got a dog in the first place.<br>  <br>  They are very time consuming and need appropriate care etc. this includes walks (ALL dogs need walks, even the tiny Paris Hilton type dogs).  Sorry, I don't mean to be rude but this is my answer to your question.
AA11901352	As was mentioned, every tank is different so there is not set PEAK number. (a good guess is twice the amount of the peak of ammonia) Vaccing deep into the gravel won't hurt the bacteria colonies in the tank.  .5 (although this too can prove deadly for some fish) for both is looking good and heading to the end of the cycle.  Were these readings after the partial water change or before?  <br>  <br>  5 is nothing for nitrates since they are the end product of the nitrogen cycle process.  <br>  <br>  Oxygen doesn't affect nitrites it affects the neutrifying bacteria that converts it.  Here is a great article on the cycle but it seems like your tank is headed in the right direction here.<br>  <br>  <a href="http://freshaquarium.about.com/cs/biologicalcycle/a/nitrogencycle.htm" rel="nofollow">http://freshaquarium.about.com/cs/biolog...</a>|`|fYupEegGaa	The average peak of nitrite is 0.75 but it could get higher. Here's a website to help- <a href="http://www.petco.com/caresheets/fish/NitrogenCycle.pdf" rel="nofollow">http://www.petco.com/caresheets/fish/Nit...</a><br>  Scroll down to the bottom of the link and it shows a chart showing what the nitrite, ammonia and Nitrate should be in your tank throughout cycling process. Also you should raise the temp in your tank while doing the cycling process to about 82F this will help beneficial bacteria grow faster.|`|3Ql70kuAaa	Marcus was right.  It not how it CAN get but how high it SHOULD get if you already have fish.  Nitrite can poison them if it get over 1.0.  So you have to do water changes to keep it below that.  If you did a fishless cycle before you put the fish in, it wouldn't matter how high they got.|`|NBfBKI1Uaa	That would depend on many things. Main factor is the amount of ammonia. <br>  <br>  But usually when the nitrate level reaches 40ppm, the cycling process is considered complete. And thus many would do a substantial water change before adding fish.<br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  -rds|`|ur5wDhkMaa	As you have fish in the tank, you should be doing daily water changes while cycling. The fish are constantly adding ammonia and the filters bacteria is converting it as fast as it can into nitrite, but until there is enough of them they can't cope, so you help the filter with daily 20% water changes from the gravel. This removes waste food and poop.<br>  <br>  Nitrite stays locked behind nitrate, the more surface agitation you have the more nitrate is exchanged for oxygen and the more nitrite can progress through the cycle.<br>  <br>  You really don't wait for a peak when you have fish in the tank and .5 is high. The PH will also drop slightly with the removal of ammonia from the bottom.

Unfortunately you haven't really got much of a chance of getting an answer without an autopsy as it could have been any number of hidden causes.<br>  She was fine in the morning, she was happy and then she went. Lucky dog, it sounds like she had the best of a life, suffered no visible pain and was deeply loved. It happens and you have to take comfort in the fact she died peacefully.<br>  My first dog was 14, she was totally fit and healthy, still had her teeth and never had a day sick in her life. She sneezed blood one day and we took her to the vet, she had an unseen inoperable tumour at the top of her nose. There was nothing to give an indication that she suffered at all right up to that moment. The vet told me she could have gone at any time. Its sad but these things do happen.|`|HdOVYIWjaa	I was in the same situation about 2 years ago.  I had a puppy who was a neopolitan mastiff/american bulldog/boxer mix.  She only lived to be 6 months old.  We came home one day and found her (she looked like she was sleeping too).  I only had enough money to do either the necropsy or cremation.  I went with the cremation, finding out what happened would not have brought her back =[.  The vet said that the breed mixes weren't favorable and the rate that she was growing (she was already 70lbs at 6 months) that her heart probably wasn't growing fast enough.  It really is sad when you lose a pet, especially one that you've had for 9 years.  If she was relatively healthy, she probably died due to some condition of the heart that she would not have had any symptoms for.|`|z2TjjnxVaa	It was probably something with the heart.

Make sure you worm him / her regularly and I would suggest clearing up the poop from the yard as soon as the pup has gone.  You should then be able to ween it off the poop.  Whenever you see the pup go to the poop and try to eat it, spray the pup and shout NO BAD with a water gun.<br>  <br>  You should be able to train the pup that eating poop is bad.<br>  <br>  This has nothing to do with the amount you are feeding your dog, dogs do and will always eat almost anything.  Dogs will eat garbage if given the chance and they never seem to get full.|`|HNturDtkaa	You might try a higher quality dog food, but this is normal for all dogs. I shovel up my dogs' poo as it hits the ground for several reasons. 1, they can't eat it if it isn't there.2, they can't step in it and drag it in the house and 3, I won't step in it!|`|xarKlp0Oaa	This is normal puppies just eat their poop. My sister is having the same problem with her 6 month old golden retriever and the problem usually goes away after the first year. It won't hurt her it will just give her horrible breath.
TpOVmqpHaa	Very gently feel up and down the foot and leg for any signs of a break. Apply gentle pressure to see if there are any areas that are significantly painful (produces a whine or yelp when touched).  If everything seems intact, it's ok to wait a day or two to see if he begins using the leg again.  In most cases it's just a bruise or sprain and will need no further attention other than rest.|`|JM4Uiunqaa	Um, hello! It's probably broken or at least seriously bruised. You need to take him to a vet ASAP. If the paw heals wrong he could be crippled for life and you could be charged with neglect if your vet/the authorities find out you are not treating your dog's obvious injury.|`|9kTejB0uaa	Ouch!  Poor baby.  It's probably only bruised, but if this continues beyond the next 24 hours, or if it swells up badly and he's in a lot of pain, I'd get it checked by your vet.|`|93ix6nyvaa	I'd check to see if there's any visible bruise or swelling. Most likely than not, there is physical pain on that back paw. I wouldn't wait to have him checked out at the vet.|`|24CFl7sjaa	If he wont walk on it after an hour, take him to the vet.|`|eyZhiXYpaa	Keep an eye on it, it may be a bit bruised.<br>  <br>  If it continues into the night you must take him to the Vet tomorrow to have it checked out.|`|Tb3hIDy8aa	It is probaly hurt! If he doesn't walk on it soon, and cries alot you should probaly take him into a vet to take a look at it.|`|5f6fbccb8643408cbd62a8431b3e5c44aa	Yup very simple....Time for the vet to take a look at him if he isn't walking on it by the am.
qA18Nxslaa	It's not a good idea to house two corns together. They are closely related to kingsnakes, which are cannibals. That being said, many people are very successful housing corns together, but for those who were UNsuccessful, they lost a pet snake to the belly of another. Even if neither of the snakes has a desire to cannibalize, you also risk one smelling a food item on the other and, still being hungry, decide to eat first, ask questions never. Is this a risk you are willing to take? <br>  If you already have the seperate tanks, the best advice would be to keep it that way. Whatever you decide, I wish you the best of luck!|`|V2c0dAtwaa	They say it's always a risk to do so... but some herps pull it off...<br>  <br>  I wouldn't say yes but I wouldn't say no either... it depends on how the snakes get along i guess.|`|8i90ov0Gaa	If they're already in separate cages, which is what's best for them, why do you want to change that? Snakes are solitary and prefer to be alone. Not to mention a 20 gallon aquarium is too small for a pair of adult corn snakes.|`|zzzd9tC4aa	I have 2 female corn snakes, they are both different sizes, but they live happily together. First of all I put them both together for short amounts of time in a completely different cage, so that they didn't get territorial. They were "jumpy" at first, but then we left them get beyond this stage and put them together and they are fine. As for feeding, I feed them in the same cage, but I make sure they never go for the same mouse. Put about 3 shelters in, so that they can be separate if they want to. However mine love curling up together under the same shelter. <br>  <br>  If you have 2 males, they might fight and be territorial- I'm not sure. If you have 1 male and 1 female they will definitely breed and this could bring tension to either snake, and cost you money to buy incubators etc..|`|7ZjloThDaa	Its not always a good idea but can be done. If they are male and female they will most likely mate.<br>  <br>  If you do put them together you MUST put them in different cages for feeding. It is very dangerous to have them together for feedings. <br>  <br>  Good luck|`|aIXMXRiFaa	If they dont have too many issues yeah.. but some have really bad temperament, and i wouldn't suggest it if that's the case. How big are they?|`|n8UBfhgpaa	are they male/female? you could probably google this for a better answer
hR87A418aa	feed them 3 times a day maybe even a 4th n put a lettuce the size of 4-5 inches. since they love it|`|Wn3LGHTvaa	Turtles are notorious beggars. Feed them all they will eat at one time, then ignore them until the next scheduled feeding. Go easy on the romaine. They need a high-protein diet with lots of vitamin D and calcium to grow properly.
AA11101806	I'm not familiar with those brands, but mixing two brands isn't bad for the dog as long as she has a consistent diet.<br>  <br>  it's essentially the same thing as some dogs that get some canned food mixed in with dry.|`|AA12128656	settling on one would be a good idea, but most brands of dog food can be mixed. it's especially advisable to mix them when switching from one food to the other. is there a reason you're using both foods?|`|GSf09ALBaa	I can see no reason why you cannot mix two brands of superior food for your puppy.|`|p7swtBYzaa	If your puppy isn't getting intestinal upsets, it's o.k., but I have to ask why you would do this.   It makes no sense, why not just give the one you find more nutritious in the first place?<br>  Do you have 2 different kinds that you want to use up - that would be reasonable, but why would you purposely buy 2 different kinds?<br>  <br>  I can see adding some lean protein, a little rice and veggies, but why 2 different dry kibbles?|`|9kTejB0uaa	Hum - I have to ask why?  Yes I add a very little tinned meat into my puppy's food, but combining two brands ...... ?  I guess it can't 'hurt' if she's doing okay on this, but I think it would be far wiser to settle for one or the other (and I don't know these brands).|`|BWZ6pBoHaa	No need to feed any puppy food, it only makes dogs fat.  Lots of good dog foods out there, my preference is Canidae All Life Stages.  It can be fed from puppyhood all the way thru adulthood.|`|mOFShz3Eaa	its souldnt be a problem as long as both brands are high quality and your dog is on a consistante diet.|`|KuUx34hCaa	Most breeders would say no I have raised dogs for over 60yr. & for the last 20yr +or- I have used Natural Choice puppy & Adult as their is no chemical or by-products added which means you don't need to feed as much & it's healthier I use large breed: this  food has ever thing a puppy &/or adults needs it's a little more expensive but you don't use as much good luck Ardy|`|xarKlp0Oaa	It is okay for now, bur eventually I would pick just one food.

omBhu3gjaa	first, clown fish do not grow fast, they are one of the slowest growing fresh water aquarium fish. i have seen many that about 6 inches long that are around 6 years old. yikes thats a long time. depending on how agressive of a tank you want, i have some clown knives that are about 6 months old and ten inches,l but they are very agressive and will only eat live goldfish :( other than that there are many less agressive fish that get big to. tinfoil barbs get huge and are not very aggresive along with bala sharks. but honestly if you want cool fish that get really big, you get an aggresive tank, many agressive fish are more exciting and have better personalities, then you could get oscars, or flowerhorns or other beautiful south african cichlids that grow fairly fast|`|1f4c803984defdfd24e382289f4e3180aa	I like my Pleco. I was naive and didn't know that they grow huge.<br>  <br>  It's now almost 9 inches. I like the fact that it changes colors and interacts with me when its feeding time.|`|stMcVPCMaa	Clown Loaches are my favorite "large" fish - they start small in the fish store but they grow fast and can reach over a foot or more.  They have a great personality and need companionship so make sure you get at least 3.  They can be "pushy" when food is involved so if you have other bottom feeders, keep an eye on them to make sure everyone is getting enough.  Otherwise they are very peaceful so they are great in a community tank.<br>  <br>  I also like black skirt tetras for a big tank, especially in large schools.  They get pretty big (for a tetra), over two inches long, and I think look really cool because of their particular schooling habits.  Other large tetras are congo tetras, buenos aires tetras, and red/blue tetras (aka columbian blue).<br>  <br>  Angelfish are another large fish favorite of mine, and in a large tank you can even keep a small school of them.  Depending on your tank size (hard to guess with just a length measurement) you can probably get 5 or 6 of them.
stMcVPCMaa	It won't hurt him as long as you don't overdose and you follow the water changing required.  There's actually several varieties of disease that attack fins so proper diagnosis is needed so you know what kind of antibiotics to use.  Generally the descriptions on the antibiotics packages tell you the type of symptoms that antibiotic will treat, so check the labels carefully when purchasing.  If you have a GOOD fish store in your area (by this I mean a locally owned store with healthy fish, and not a chain store), you may be able find someone there who is extremely knowledgeable and can help you choose the right medicine.|`|wnnudNp5aa	Treat him with Maracyn-two. It won't hurt him, but will cure all sorts of fish ailments. Good luck!|`|3bf821ff353c216ffc93ff7a91b60828aa	Like humans, it's not a good idea to medicate unnecessarily.  It'll just increase the bacteria's tolerance to the antibiotics, and eventually they won't work.  Fin/tail rot is easily treated without meds, especially in the beginning stages, by just increasing your water changes.  It's usually brought on by poor water quality.|`|ijvWMbxVaa	I use aquarium salt. This works well. I use 1 tsp of aquarium salt per gallon of water. Also the temperature should be 80oF. take any plastic plants out of the tank, these can tear his fins and cause infection.

V7jycPqdaa	Phone and ask your local Vet !|`|AraBfesHaa	The BEST thing to use is Maracyn2.  it treats both, and is the best medication I have in the fish medication box.  I barely use anything else anymore. It even treats more than it says on and inside the package.   It has cured several of my fish when I didn't know what was wrong with them,  some of them even closer to death than yours sounds like.  you just need to start treating ASAP if you want to save them.<br>  You can get it at petsmart and petco, and private fish shops.  <br>  Walmart doesn't carry it.<br>  Melafix says it will treat fin rot, but most people will tell you it doesn't really work, so don't waste your money.  Use the best available.|`|wnnudNp5aa	Like Katie said, treat them with Maracyn-Two. It is one of the best all-around antibiotics made for fish. It may be too late for your fish, they sound pretty far gone, but could be worth a try. Good luck!|`|RGqs6ySGaa	marcyn powder|`|3bf821ff353c216ffc93ff7a91b60828aa	Goldfish won at the fair, most likely a common or comet.  They should grow to about 10-12 inches.  Shubunkin about 10 inches.  With that said, and you're serious about getting these guys to live to their full potential life span of 20+ years, you really need a larger tank.  Ideally a 55 gallon/208 litre tank will be needed, but for now, 30gallons/113 litres as a minimum would work for a short time with plans to upgrade to the larger size in the near future.<br>  <br>  Popeye and fin/tail rot are usually brought on by poor water quality.  1 goldfish alone needs at least a 15-20 gallon/ 75 litre tank to start out with.  Your tank is about 5 gallons, which is really only suitable for a betta.  There's no way to keep the water quality good with even one goldfish, much less two in a 5 gallon tank.  <br>  <br>  So, for now, I would suggest doing daily water changes of 50%.  Feed them every other day, and only once a day, just what they'll eat in a few minutes.  Net out any uneaten food.    Get that larger tank asap.  Don't use aquarium salt in the tank, that's not good when dealing with dropsy or popeye, makes them retain more fluids.  Just keep up with the water changes.  That should be enough to allow them to heal on their own.  Again, I strongly suggest the larger tank, there's no way around it.  After 2 years, those fish should ideally be around 6-8 inches or larger, and I have a feeling they're no where near that.  So, that means they're also stunted.  Good luck!<br>  <br>  <br>  .|`|9wtpCNb6aa	Well it could be a number of things, do you have parasites in your tank?  Certain parasites can appear in the tank if you feed your fish too much for example, the remaining food attracts the parasites.  These parasites can then attatch themselves to the fish and start eating away at them, which could be the cause of the fin rot.  Its quite easy to tell if they are there as they will be more than likely on the glass of your tank or on the fish.  Look out for very small moving white bugs.<br>  <br>  The other one thats lying on the bottom, may have something more serious, although it could also be swim bladder.  This is also caused by parasites or a viral infection.  This will cause the fish to lose its boyancy.  Some people pre soak the food before putting it in the tank to avoid the fish swallowing air.  Another reason could be skin flukes, again caused by parasites.  These parasites will be about 2mm in length.  <br>  <br>  I would check the PH, GH and KH levels in the tank.  Test for ammonia, nitrites, and nitrates.  Change the water once a week, if you have gravel be careful not to stir up the bottom too much.  Dont overfeed the fish.  One thing some people try is putting 2 pre-shelled peas in the tank, this provides them with certain nutrients which can help constipation, as they may have that too.<br>  <br>  Good luck, maybe scoop them out and get them to a specialist if things dont improve soon.  Always remember to re-climatise the fish before sticking them back in the newly changed water, do this by putting them in individual bags, place them in the newly filled tank and leave them for about 20 mins minimum.|`|yT9QnQxmaa	use mellafix i used it for my tiger oscars cuz he had some  mean lil monsters eating him alive in his body.it is cause by many reasons!<br>  get that thing and put the drops in.if you have other fishes in it's still fine!|`|QdQBYf05aa	It may be too late by the looks of it. The one that is on the bottom of the floor probably has an internal problem like tumour etc. Ive found with goldfish that you need to keep the water very clean, not just tap water too. You can buy special filters to filter the tap water so its okay, and then need to be cleaned out once a week. Having real plants will help keep them healthy. <br>  <br>  There is a treatment called Mellafix which is excellent(im not sure if its spelt like that but it sounds like that) But it actually works and is very good. You should be able to get it easily. <br>  <br>  Good luck
l0ktQUnWaa	A Bearded Dragon is an excellent pet. Do the research before you get one and you should not be disappointed. The pet stores will tell you anything to make a sale. There are good breeders online too!<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.beautifuldragons.503xtreme.com/home.html?merchant_return_link=Return+to+Beautiful+Dragons+Reptile+Rescue&form_charset=UTF-8" rel="nofollow">http://www.beautifuldragons.503xtreme.co...</a>|`|SUs4rN49aa	I've never had any experience with reptiles before I got my bearded dragon in September and I would think I am doing a pretty good job since he seems healthy! <br>  <br>  All you have to do is just do a little bit of research before getting one. Depending on the age of the bearded dragon, you'll need to get a cage.. bigger one for an adult and about 18x18x18 for a baby since they will be small at first but they do grow fast! Baby beardies eat crickets, just pin sized crickets about 5-6 a day.. and then introduce him to vegetables as soon as you can. When beardies are adults their diet is 80% vegetables and 20% crickets. <br>  <br>  You'll need the proper amount of lighting, two sources of light, one for heat, and another for calcium absorption. You'll need to dust crickets once a day with calcium powder. Avoid sand in the habitat as a baby, because this can cause impaction in the stomach. <br>  <br>  I would recommend the site beardeddragon.org lots of bearded dragon owners on there to help you out. <br>  <br>  I think bearded dragons make really good pets.. They are pretty easy to take care of. You turn on their lights when you wake up, throw in some crickets and vegetables, and you are good to go. If you handle them daily they are super social.. mine reminds me of a dog sometimes because he cocks his head at you when you talk to him. Once you do more research on them you will know whether or not to get one. Good luck!|`|NzSA6dmyaa	while veiled chameleons are probably the hardiest chameleons but all chameleons are difficult to look after, many shops will say what u want to here to get a sale. bearded dragons on the other hand are hardy, friendly easy to care for and as long as u have the space they are very easy to care for, they do need UVB lighting and to be kept pretty warm like the basking spot needs to be about 100F and 4x2x2 foot would be a good size vivarium for an adult but they are pretty much bomb proof, enjoy handling and are great first lizards. <a href="http://exoticpets.about.com/cs/lizardsaspets/a/beardeddragons.htm" rel="nofollow">http://exoticpets.about.com/cs/lizardsas...</a>|`|kWnEvDxeaa	OMG bearded dragons are the BEST PET EVER! they are really adorable and are easy to take care of...

I would either get a 3d opinion or have a vet lance or biopsy one before going ahead with further treatment.  Good luck|`|m1lu7CFJaa	My dog had lumps too, I was told they were fatty cysts/tumors/warts - all the same thing according to my vet.  Although his didn't smell.

OxFsslN8aa	I would hope that you never use a shock collar for barking.  Dogs really have no idea why they get a shock for doing something as natural as making a noise.  It's cruel & wrong.  <br>  <br>  How much exercise does your dog get?  Have you worked with treats to have her sit when visitors come?  How long have you worked on the other techniques?  For many dogs it takes months of consistent training; not days.  If you allow her to bark sometimes because you aren't prepared when someone comes to the door, you are sending a mixed message & the training will take even longer.  <br>  <br>  When you leave the house, don't talk to her.  Make it is simple as if you are going to the bathroom.  Samething as when you come home; don't look at her or talk to her for 5 minutes after you get home.  Some people make the mistake of talking to their dogs and explaining that they are going to work & everything will be OK.  This only makes the dogs more anxious.  Same thing with coming home; if you ignore the barking & jumping then the dog won't get attention for it and the behavior will stop.  I would have treats when I came home & provide one when she sits quietly.  I don't even open the door to my house until both of my dogs are sitting and quiet.  They can see me through the window & although it's below zero here I still wait for them to sit.  It works great.  They know that they cannot have any part of me when they are excited.|`|Iyl5N9EKaa	First, dogs will bark. Secondly barking when you leave is separation anxiety. Give her a kong before you leave, this will distract her! Also, I would embrace that the dog barks when someone is coming. One day it could be an intruder. Sounds like you haven't been consistent on your method to stop it. Stick with the muzzle. Say "no" and put it on for a few minutes and take it off. She does it again, put it back on. Be consistent it could take months before it stops but eventually you can correct it. People tend to think these things can happen overnight. I have set up pretend knocking to discourage "trigger sounds" that will make my dog bark.  Being only a year old, the dog will eventually get use to certain sounds and stop, right now everything is new to her. Be patient.|`|eyZhiXYpaa	NO - please do not consider this as a method to curb barking i.e. the collar - this item should be removed from the pet stores and should be illegal.<br>  <br>  Unfortunately if your dog is a barker you will not be able to STOP the barking completely - dogs bark this is life, their bark is their voice.<br>  <br>  Try the squirt gun method - mist him/her with water and should NO BARK.  Keep the consistency up with it and you may eventually see some results.<br>  <br>  PLEASE NO SHOCK COLLAR.<br>  <br>  Thanks.|`|teDI6RQ8aa	Get a can and put a couple rocks, pennies, or whatever in it to make a racket every time she barks.  Shake it for that racket when she barks.  We put a couple mini screwdrivers in a can and shake it.  My "Schnoodle"(I know, it's not a breed.  I just wanted to try typing that once.) is a barker.  We got him a couple weeks ago from a rescue.  He's two years old.  His barking hasn't completely stopped, but he has sure come a long way since we started that.  He doesn't bark at EVERY little thing anymore.  Just several times a day now.  But one or two shakes, and he stops.  It pretty much used to be a constant bark.<br>  <br>  Edit: For my Toy Poodle, we'd splash a little water in her face.  She's usually pretty quiet, but once in a blue moon she barks just to hear herself bark.  The splashing worked.  When we first got our "Schnoodle", her barking picked up, but with the shaking of the can, she's stopped doing that.<br>  <br>  Our dogs get plenty of exercise.  They go to the dog park almost every day.  Not for very long, but long enough to get a good run in.  It would be longer, but up here it gets below zero during the day in winter.|`|ezzSeBnLaa	As mean as it sounds, a barking collar works wonders. My bestfriend had the same problem with her dog so she got one of those and now he doesn't make a sound.|`|nZg00MQOaa	An instinctive canine behavior, a bark now and then reminds you that your dog is still very much a dog. However, constant barking can be disruptive, if not downright nerve-racking. Fortunately, there are ways to prevent or curb problem barking.<br>  <br>  Here's how to treat this problem <a href="http://tinyurl.com/5agl4q" rel="nofollow">http://tinyurl.com/5agl4q</a>

Depending on the severity, you may be referred to a specialist to evaluate if surgery is an option.  Pain medication should be prescribed either way.|`|f10424ac1ac7b1791b4f665094823d61aa	Elastic strapping is sometimes used in a break.   <br>  <br>  Or it it is a sprain, your vet might not do anything.|`|ehoM8ZyHaa	depending on how broke it is? if it is just a sprain they may do nothing about it, or wrap it up so he can't move it around. if it is broke they could do surgery or just wrap it up as well and let it heal on its own.|`|8584e0329fb17c662606d5a6a8650ee2aa	If it appears possibly broken, they will X-ray it just like they would a person.

DplwqVOsaa	i asked this question i had to use a new email my dog is house broken he i 2 years old he is a big dog and i have a cat.[im ttilly11 useing a new emali]|`|9kTejB0uaa	OK.  First of all you need to be sure your dog doesn't have a medical condition that's causing this problem.  And for this, you need to see your vet.  Is this a puppy?<br>  <br>  Can't answer your question, apart from the possibility of this being a medical issue, until I know whether this is a puppy, or an adult.|`|PXfUyd5aaa	Because he's a dog and you haven't trained him.|`|s76aC4G8aa	Could you provide more information other than my dog pees everywhere?  How old is the dog, is he a puppy, has he been properly housebroken, what is causing him to pee, is he submissive peeing is he peeing because you haven't gotten him out enough, etc.<br>  <br>  Please provide more information on the dog breed, size, age etc so we can help you, otherwise it's difficult to give any help.<br>  <br>  Late Add:<br>  Well if he's 2 years old and he's just started doing this then have him checked for a UTI.  I'm assuming he's been properly housebroken and you've had him since he was a puppy right?  Hard to tell without even more information.<br>  <br>  Is he getting out enough to potty?  Is he neutered?  If he's unfixed he could be marking, has anything changed in the house, has anything new been added, sometimes that has an affect on a dog.  I remember when we purchased a new dog bed for my sisters dog and my puppy who was 8 months old and housebroken peed on the bed, which we assumed she was "marking" Mocha's bed.<br>  <br>  At 2 he should be fully housebroken, if the vet rules out a UTI and he's unfixed look into having him neutered to stop his "marking" behavior, if he's fixed then make sure he's on a schedule to potty and he gets out enough during the day.  Pick up the water bowl around 7 pm at night and make sure he gets out a few times before bed.<br>  <br>  If you are looking at him and he's urinating on the floor has he been abused for pottying?  Some dogs can become submissive pee-ers (sp?) it's a dogs way of submitting to you by urinating, if he's been beaten because of it you'll only make the problem worse since the dogs basically saying "I'm submitting to you I cannot submit any more than I already am" so try to figure out "why" your dog has suddenly started this behavior.<br>  <br>  Work on getting him outside more and praise him when he potties outside and ignore him when he goes inside.  But first you need to rule out any UTI before going any further.<br>  <br>  Good luck|`|AA11244754	All you have said is where he pees, try providing us with other extremely important details, such as...oh age, whether or not he was house broken when you got him, if you've had him long or just adopted him and from where...stuff like that.  Can't help without it.|`|teDI6RQ8aa	He needs to go out to potty every hour or so.  He also needs to be neutered.  He should also see a vet in case he has a bladder infection.

XB0UpJsLaa	If you want a well bred, or registered one..the english can be anywhere between $800-1500.. the french bulldogs usually start at $900-2500. French bulldogs are more expensive because they have very small litters. Or you could find an AKC breeder..if you are not interested in showing the dog, they sometimes will sell one puppy for a little cheaper because it doesn't have perfect conformation or a color flaw. Again, if your not showing that wouldn't matter to you. Or you could find the a breed rescue group. For more info. on them and registered breeders, you could check out www.akc.org and either go under breed, or find a dog.

7ZjloThDaa	Yes many turtles and tortoises are endangered. Below is the the  International Union for Conservation of Nature's red list which is a list of all endangered/threatened animals in the world. This link is already at the list of turtles, it will tell you a ton of information about each species including whether they are endangered.<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.iucnredlist.org/search" rel="nofollow">http://www.iucnredlist.org/search</a><br>  <br>  I hope this helps|`|89xzNpVaaa	Look, turtles are kind of animals but there are many types of turtles, not all types of them are endangered but yes, many types are endangered such as;<br>  <br>  Big-headed Pantanal Swamp Turtle<br>  Chaco Side-necked Turtle<br>  Brazilian Radiolated Swamp Turtle<br>  Black Spine-neck Swamp Turtle<br>  Pacific Pond Turtle<br>  Asiatic Softshell Turtle<br>  Cuatro Cienegas Softshell<br>  Peacock Soft-shelled Turtle<br>  Leith's Softshell Turtle|`|27a6064141149e4c067b229800e7b9ffaa	Depends what you mean by turtle (Americans, British and Australians all call different things turtle). Some species like the sea turtle are endangered, others like the texas tortoise are quite common.|`|MfcTIdlraa	Many are common, many are endangered.  if you don't know which is which, leave them all in peace.|`|FfxmE9Toaa	Yes, many species are endangered. Both freshwater and sea turtles.|`|8cikAYp3aa	YES!  most species of turtles are atleast threatened and many are critically so.  Biggest factors facing them are US.  we hunt them, eat them, take away their habitat, poison and pollute,  steal their eggs, and grab hatchlings/young from the wild for the pet trade where inevitably some idiot with no clue buys them and they die or get abandoned when they are out grown.
N9pKl35Xaa	Try the AKC website (I dont know about the American one but the Australian one has listed breeders that are proper breeders otherwise they would of never been listed). Alot of really good breeders are also known to be 'Private' and you would probably only hear about some of them via 'Mouth and Ear'. Its how we heard about the Rottweiler breeder we got our dog off. One of the best leading breeders in the state but was a Private listed Pedigree ANKC Registered Breeder or whatever the hell its called. Or just ask your local vet, breeders usually send emails etc etc to vets and ask them to pass on the info. Even look to Shelters? Or go to Show dog and ask around, sometimes breeders will actually be there because they're nominated for Breeders awards. But yeah, its a matter of doing research and asking around to get the quality of dog with the blood lines and everything.
pLv0Ejt9aa	Everything you do with your pup must be training, but it must be fun and games. She is still very young so at this stage your training should consist more of playing and building a bond with her. She must learn through your loving and caring for her that you are her leader and that she can trust you. Read more on puppy training on my site.<br>  Enjoy your puppy and remember she will be easily distrated until she is a year old. So have patience.|`|9kTejB0uaa	Well you can start the basics right now, but I have to ask why you have this puppy at such a young age?  She really should be back with her litter-mates for at least another 2 weeks!!  Frankly I think I'd leave it at the housetraining at this point - sit and come aren't seriously necessary yet - are they?  Poor wee thing has enough on her plate to adjust to a new home and being away from the nest at this point (plus the housetraining).  Leave her to become a bit more established.  She needs to eat, sleep and play, for now.<br>  <br>  Mutter-mutter, who let you have this puppy at such a young age, especially when you are maybe not experienced?|`|YUQgyPT3aa	She is still too young...she should still be with her mom for 4-6 more weeks.<br>  <br>  EDIT: Weaned does not mean REMOVED FROM mom and litter...It means to get them started on soft puppy food|`|kd9kWB8Kaa	as soon as you get home.  puppies have short attention spans.|`|wyfjsfikaa	Since you received your puppy so early it is very important to start training right away, your puppy is not learning important thing that it would have if it stayed with the litter till it was eight weeks old. Dr, Ian Dunbar if the "father" of puppy training I highly suggests that you take a look at his website and buy his book "before and after you get your puppy". it will help you to have a happy healthy pup.|`|mOFShz3Eaa	you should start right away, it helps if you teach her to come to her name first that way you can keep her attention longer. dont expect too much from her right now but be patient and make the training fun. i would use food kibbles instead of treats though they're better for her and shes kinda young to be givin treats just yet.<br>  <br>  all the best|`|xarKlp0Oaa	It is never too early to start the basics. All puppies are easily distracted but the earlier you start the better she will do and she will also get used of it faster and not get distracted so easily.|`|AA11244754	Just do 5 reps on command when you are training her.  Remember she's only a baby and doesn't have that long of an attention span and praise her when she does do what you want her to.  Also using a small treat will work.|`|s4OtfZ7Gaa	you can start now, no prob. but dont expect to work with her for more than 5 minutes at most at a time. use treats to lure her into what you want her to do|`|AA11101806	start training her now, but you will have to be patient with her.<br>  <br>  right now the best thing is to work on behavior and responsiveness.|`|BWZ6pBoHaa	You need to take the 6 week old pup back to the unreputable breeder who sold you such a young dog.  She needs to be with her littermates and Mom.|`|s76aC4G8aa	There's a reason pups don't find new homes until they are 8 weeks old, first of all it's illegal in most states to sell a puppy before 8 weeks old, lastly they miss out on important etiquette that they learn from their mother and littermates, pups weaned too early develop behavioral problems that you will have to deal with when they get older, the first being bite inhibition, this is taught by the mother and littermates, now you will have to teach your pup bite inhibition without making him aggressive or fearful of you. I suggest you pick up a book on training puppies and what to do when the pup bites you or prefers your feet and hands to his toys.  It'll help you get over this hurdle.<br>  <br>  Pups have 5 minute attention spans if that, so anything you teach will have to be taught in 5 minute increments a few times a day.  Pick one trick and stick with it until it's learned, keep the training short and always end on a positive note, use treats as reinforcement reward within 1 second of the pup doing the desired behavior and NEVER reward the pup until he's doing the behavior you desire that way they make the connection between behavior and reward.    Make sure you're rewarding the correct behavior, if he sits and you wait too long and he stands and you reward him then he'll think you want him to stand so you've got to be quick with the timing of the treats.<br>  <br>  When he gets older you'll be able to teach more but right now if you go past 5 minutes you've lost your audience, and repetitious drilling of a trick is punishment to a dog so don't get frustrated if he doesn't pick it up quickly, it takes time and patience with pups.|`|KuUx34hCaa	Your doing the right thing a pup can be trained at 4 weeks while they are still with their mother little at a time use food as a training tool & stay with it in short sessions & it WILL pay off in time. Ardy|`|AA12128656	why do you have this pup so young?<br>  <br>  pups don't find homes till 8 weeks because that's a law, and a developmental REQUIREMENT, not because they just haven't "found" homes yet.<br>  <br>  you should be ashames of yourself for bringing home a pup who should still be with its littermates. <br>  <br>  i certainly hope you'll report the person that "bred" these dogs, since it sounds like you brought the pup home at 5 weeks?!?!?|`|TSc8OE4vaa	You can start training now, but don't expect her to master any commands for a few months.  The earlier you start the more solid she'll be with her commands.
A2IDiIpIaa	I said so when you asked and yes it is true, the Petco employees are there for making money, not ensuring a good healthy animal.<br>  Kaytee Forti Diet - Mouse, rat and hamster contains Ethoxyquin (<a href="http://www.avianweb.com/ethoxyquin.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.avianweb.com/ethoxyquin.htm</a> shows you the problems with ethoxyquin) you probably got this bag <a href="http://www.petco.com/product/5906/Kaytee-Forti-Diet-Mouse-and-Rat-Food.aspx" rel="nofollow">http://www.petco.com/product/5906/Kaytee...</a> or something extremely similar, here is the ingredient list Ground yellow corn, dehulled soybean meal, ground wheat, ground oats, ground peanuts, dehydrated alfalfa meal, corn gluten meal, dried cane molasses, lignin sulfonate, fish meal, corn sugar, calcium carbonate, salt, dicalcium phosphate, animal fat (preserved with BHT), brewers dried yeast, dried beet pulp, dl-methionine, choline chloride, riboflavin supplement, ferrous carbonate, vitamin E supplement, vitamin B12 supplement, manganous oxide, ethoxyquin (a preservative), l-lysine, zinc oxide, niacin, menadione sodium bisulfite complex (source of vitamin K activity), vitamin A supplement, calcium pantothenate, cholecalciferol (source of vitamin D3), copper oxide, pyridoxine hydrochloride, thiamine mononitrate, folic acid, biotin, calcium iodate, cobalt carbonate, sodium selenite, natural flavoring.<br>  Ethoxyquin, pyridoxine hydrochloride, would you want to eat these things? <br>  Ethoxyquin can be cancerous and there have been many links to it, but would you want your furry friend to have something you wouldn't want?<br>  Hopefully this helps, but why on earth would you not spend 25 cents more per pound for a better food like oxbow regal rat.<br>  Here is a link for oxbow regal rat- <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Oxbow-Regal-Rat-Food-3-lb/dp/B000GABM1K/ref=pd_bbs_sr_1?ie=UTF8&s=home-garden&qid=1235400758&sr=8-1" rel="nofollow">http://www.amazon.com/Oxbow-Regal-Rat-Fo...</a><br>  <br>  I really hope you trust this advice, as I have done very thorough research.

It's a pesticide known to cause cancer in humans.  It's used as a preservative in all Kaytee pet foods, and a few other brands.  There was a point where even Oxbow was using it for their product to preserve the fish meal that was in it. <br>  <br>  Yogurt drops are high in sugar.  <br>  <br>  As for what the Petco lady recommended, most of those people don't have a clue what they're doing or saying - it's what they're taught since they know nothing about the critters they're selling, or trying to sell.  They tell you to get what the store sells - which is usually overpriced garbage.|`|8474581acbbf3af73ba609e00ff353ecaa	Yes! Kaytee foods ALL contain harmful chemicals and additives. <br>  You can try the SueBee's diet, found readily online. <br>  It contains a mixture of cereals, pasta, and some other items readily available at the grocery store. You can mix it in whatever size batch you want, and because it contains so many different ingredients, rats enjoy the variety. <br>  For a standard block food, get Harlan Teklad lab block. It is absolutely safe, and 100% nutrition for rats. <br>  Good luck!|`|hC4Z8HIbaa	Pretty much any 'rat food' you buy in a pet store is trash, including Kaytee. If a pet store is your only option, try looking for Mazuri (Petsmart) or Oxbow Regal Rat. Just be advised that some rats will rather starve than touch Regal Rat food. It is supposedly the absolute best rat food in terms of a complete diet, but some rats just don't like it. If you look at some online pet stores, you can find Native Earth. I can't remember which store, but one offers something like 40 lb bags for $30. I think it might be petfooddirect.com? You can also order food from rat rescues. I personally think this is the best option because all profit goes back to the rats. I personally order my rat food from Capitol City Rat Rescue in Nebraska. I believe I have seen people offering high quality rat food on ebay also. If nothing else works out, you can feed a high quality dog kibble. Not stuff like Iams or Beneful. The stuff you do buy should have a low fat and protein content. Rat people I know that feed dog food usually buy Senior or Weight loss varieties.|`|sw2R5A9iaa	the rat doesn't understand the term "boring".  keep the bagged food handy, but feed fresh daily.

8i90ov0Gaa	Since you've asked a few questions about tortoises, I'm going to assume when you say "large reptiles", you mean tortoises. The answer is absolutely not. Many tortoises are killed each year by dogs, usually the family pet which is left unsupervised in the back yard with a pet tortoise. Dogs see these as large chew toys. The fact that the tortoise goes into it's shell and doesn't fight back makes the dog even more curious, and even if it doesn't kill or injure the tortoise, the dog will stress it out. I was just at a breeder's house a few weeks ago who has several large tortoises, including a 180 pound Sulcata, and he has a black lab as well. He told me he would never consider leaving the dog with the tortoises for this very reason. Just because a dog looks like it will be fine around tortoises when you're watching it doesn't mean it will act that way when you leave and it becomes bored.|`|aIXMXRiFaa	Definitely not reptiles from the order Crocodilia (crocodiles, alligators, etc).

And tuataras are usually fine too.|`|NzSA6dmyaa	depends on the dog and the reptile, if its an easy going dog and a docile species of reptile the it might be ok.

In which case they do not lay eggs but will eat fry.<br>  <br>  Sitting on the bottom of the tank and gasping for breath is also a sign of water quality issues, lack of oxygen or an internal disorder. <br>  <br>  Livebearers like Guppies and Mollies will hide when they're about to give birth (to live fry, not eggs), but not usually for several days, usually only a few hours.

Put in another tank. They will do some romance and may get violent as well. In the early morning you will see eggs. Once you see the eggs, immediately remove both the fish. Check internet for guidelines. There are different type of eggs. Some float, some stick to floating roots, some on floor, some on bubbles. You didnt say which fish. If it is a chichlid, you need to leave the father with the eggs, because they keep the eggs in mouth.|`|QIQ1fB0Haa	yes, your mom is correct you should keep her in other  tank or in other bowl and give her oxygen and food because if you wont give she will eat up her eggs i also love fishes and my fish also give birth to 14 babies<br>                                              bye sneh cham|`|yT9QnQxmaa	U Should put her in a different tank with oxygen and put a bowl at the bottom for her eggs and bring in the male too.She's more tired of carrying the eggs around.
yY6Aj1xpaa	NOT a chance....the last thing I need is a whopping case of road founder.  It's not "horsemanship" per se' but a lack of common sense(no brains) that leads these mindless riders on.  They'll never consider what a fall on pavement from slick shoes will do to them and their horses. Death or permanent disability.  The question is, "Is it worth it"?<br>  They (the riders) believe they're bullet proof.  Indestructible.

That girl need a good slap to the back of the head! lol. No laughing matter i know but how stupid can the girl be. I can only imagine the damage she is probably doing to her horses feet and legs.

Obviously, she has never had to care for a horse with pulled tendons or worse yet, navicular!|`|UIM8X38Oaa	No ,that is bad if someone does it alot.  <br>  <br>  I wouldn't get to mad over it, but instead realize that she probably does not know the crippling affects that can have on her horse.  Maybe she has not been told that.<br>  <br>  If you can email her than do so and explain what can happen to the foot from this,<br>  <br>  Jenny|`|cSqx1DxKaa	Nope, no way.

jV7SmnaTaa	As long as you get the exam in writing it shouldn't be any problem. Veterarians are honest people and their diagnosis is legally binding. If they tell you the horse is great and ready to go and you get it home and it's lame and sickly - they get sued...no vet wants to get sued! No worries, you can use their vet for a vet check (but you need to be on the one to write the check to pay the vet and get their diagnosis in writing). Have fun with you new horse!  Best wishes!|`|kjZk25DEaa	Never would I ever trust a vet in that case, it's call anywho.com. .. . type in vets and the state/zip code, make a phone call and that's that. . . seriously as nice as people seem, you can never be too safe. . . I've sent a horse back across a state before becauseI wanted my vet to see him becuase I trusted my vet more then any of the other vets that I knew where the horse was at.|`|j45Q2ipRaa	That can be a sticky situation.  Is there a way for you to check out the vet?  If not, put a contigency on the sale that states if he passes that vet's check and you get him to your place and find that the vet missed something, the seller will refund the cost of the horse, vet and transportation to and from.  If the seller agrees, then you might have a little bit more of a warm and fuzzy.<br>  <br>  Sometimes you just have to trust unless you are getting the horse locally where your vet or a vet you know is doing the presale, which could sometimes limit your options.<br>  <br>  Good Luck.|`|FcR8G8hPaa	I had this situation occur for both of the horses I purchased. In one case I had the owner come down with the horse and I had my vet do the prepurchase (and the owner waited to be paid while it was done). In the other, I asked my vet for a referral to a vet who was not the owner's vet somewhere near the location of the horse, gave specific instructions and got a good vetting that way. I had to pay extra to the owner for transporting the horse to the prepurchase, but that was fine with me.<br>  <br>  I always want the best, most objective prepurchase I can get. This is a big commitment. You do not want to end up with an unrideable unsellable horse. Do it right, even if it costs more. It can save you a lot in the long run.|`|XB0UpJsLaa	I would probably not trust the sellers vet. I had a similar situation where we used he sellers vet. We ended up getting way over charged for a simple vet check, and it turned out the horse had hoof problems. Many times the vet will pass the horse, because he knows the seller. Good-Luck!|`|s4OtfZ7Gaa	because the seller is out of state, i would try to work out a deal, that once the horse gets shipped to you, you have a short period of time to have the horse examined by your own vet|`|ff42beaeb7a8ee5d3b32dd2655c08c36aa	yes, i would trust him.  he is bound by a code of ethics to give you the answers which you seek, and not cover anything up.|`|sKZbK6Y5aa	i wouldnt its a conflict of interests...|`|vBR9nB81aa	No. When doing a pre-purchase exam, ALWAYS use your own veterinarian. If you do not have one, go by word of mouth from some friends. Code of ethics means nothing, of course they are supposed to say this and that, but they dont. I know alot of things that have gone wrong during pre-purchase exams and people end up buying something they had no idea about. ALWAYS use a vet you know and trust. Their vet works for them, not you, even though your paying them yes, they have been working with that other person and horse longer, they have a developed relationship. Trust me on this, I have seen many things go wrong, and I dont want to see you end up with a lame horse or a horse with many issues. Good luck|`|1tX7KwHsaa	I would honestly try and find the next closest vet just to be on the safe side. If your already hauling the horse 30 min. up the road for the sellers vet , 15 min longer to a different vet further up the road couldn't hurt. If this isn't an option though, I would def. go  with burnt_in's advice. Get a written bill of health with his signature and have a second opinion when you get the horse home.|`|QOQATPMfaa	We've had five or six horses vetted in my career as a rider (I'm 19 now) and we always use our vet. While the owners vet may be truthful most of the time, there is always a chance they'll exclude something from the final results. It's too risky when buying an animal as expensive as a horse to not make sure they 100% sound at the time you buy them|`|AA10051633	There is a conflict of interest there, the vet himself should advise you to get another vet to examine the horse.  Find yourself another horse vet that way the report won't be bias and different eyes see things different ways.|`|TSc8OE4vaa	No.  He is working for you now, but he knows that the seller will be paying him in the future.  Never trust the seller's vet.|`|Chxoncy7aa	I would want to get another vet. You never know.  He could pass over a problem that another vet will tell you about.|`|8cikAYp3aa	We have before.  Ask the vet to give a written Vet evaluation of the horse.  If he signs it then he'll have his reputation to keep if he pass's something  obviously wrong on to you.  Also call your vet and have him come to do a check as soon as you get home.  Its a bit of extra cost but  with the written eval you have the seller if something is horridly wrong and should have been caught.|`|RloOJ43haa	I would not. Is is a conflict of interest for the vet. Even if you are paying, the seller would be a regular customer. The vet will not want to make a regular customer upset by finding something on a prepurchase exam for a horse that customer is trying to sell.<br>  <br>  I suggest you try to find another vet in the area, even if it's a bit further away.|`|DdpvxfkNaa	No, I wouldn't trust the sellers vet. That vet probably knows the horse so it will do a checkup that he won't really pay attention to...he will just whip threw it and say he knows the horse is healthy. I think you should bring in your own vet because he will not know the horse which will make the check-up a good one and he will really pay attention to the horse because he/she doesn't know it. Also, it is always good to have someone who doesn't know the horse...to look at it. Never trust the seller or their friends. (unless you REALLY KNOW THEM!) Good luck :)|`|kd9kWB8Kaa	not me.
VWvI5RyBaa	Did you have her spayed?  If not I believe your little lady cat wants a male companion.  Usually it starts later, after at least six months but some starts at 4 months.  If she isn't spayed yet, you just need to have that done and the problem should be solved.|`|n8UBfhgpaa	quit being mean to your cat, some cats are just talkers and love there owners. we used to have one that had to be put down that was very affectionate. I miss him. our cat now is so independent he wont even let u pet him. he will come sit on my lap but if i touch him he leaves. enjoy the fact that u have one that owants to be with u and quit hitting and spraying it. shame on you for being so irresponsible|`|TSc8OE4vaa	What breed is she?  Some breeds, like the siamese, will meow constantly and there's not much you can do about it.<br>  <br>  Anyway, just ignore her when she meows and eventually she'll stop doing it.|`|UNFxjNHkaa	Why would you spank your cat?  That is just terrible.  She has absolutely no idea why you're doing that.  She's not doing anything wrong by meowing.  You're only supposed to use a squirt bottle when she's actually doing something wrong (ex- scratching furniture, jumping on countertops or fighting w/ other animals..etc).  And you shouldn't be ignoring her.  She wants your love and attention - which is NORMAL.  Your kitten isnt doing anything wrong and doesnt deserve punishment simply because she's annoying you.<br>  <br>  Have you spayed her?  If not, do that and the crying in the middle of the night will stop.<br>  <br>  Why would you even consider getting rid of her?  If you cant handle this situation - then I dont think you're ready to be a pet owner.<br>  <br>  You said "Try only getting like 3-4 hours of sleep at night because your cat won't stop meowing".  Many of us have BEEN THERE, DONE THAT.  Dont think that you're so unique.<br>  <br>  Get her spayed.  If the crying in the middle of the night doesnt stop, then do this:<br>  <br>  This is what I did to get my cat to stop crying at night:  I locked her in a separate bedroom w/ food,water and a litter box.  She stayed in there every night for one month.  I started letting her back out after that, and she never made a noise again while I was sleeping.  In fact, she sleeps in my bed with me all night long now and doesnt make a noise!<br>  <br>  Im not judging you - and NO its not okay for her to be crying all night.  But physical punishment and yelling never works, and that is what you're doing when you "spank and spray" her.|`|O1L07lxuaa	just take it easy,your kitten is in her estrus. it's normal for animals,speccially cats.just try to find a mate for her and help her  get through this.u know it is the high period of estrus in spring,especially cats|`|SLSX6QQsaa	Is she spayed?  My cat was EXTREMELY whiny until she was spayed.  And that wasn't just when she was in heat, just in general.  She is still pretty needy but much better about the meowing.  If you are going to get rid of her, please find a new owner yourself or take her to a NO KILL shelter while shes still young and has a better chance of getting adopted.  Its too bad that your bf hs no emotional attachement to the cat. You should not consider getting rid of it, if you really care.  It's too bad that people often treat cats as if they are disposable, not really members of the family or living creatures.  Very sad. I hope you find a way to work it out and please show my posting to your bf.|`|Amkmles0aa	iwhen you was a kid if you was away from you mom you will be sad your cat is sad hyour cat needs to see the mom|`|E3yOmel9aa	Please give her to somebody who will love her instead of abusing her. Would you spank a human baby because it wants attention? Would you squirt the baby with water and ignore it?<br>  Maybe the food you are giving your cat is upsetting her stomach? Have you taken her to the vet?<br>  If you loved your cat your boyfriends opinion would not factor in your decisions.
nY1nq9hCaa	My dog got kicked by a cow the next day she could not move spent 2 wk in vets still not walking and tests, they said nothing was wrong but advised me to get further tests costing over ￡600.  I could not afford it because i was a student and career.  Took her home she walked fine, turned out she was soft but there was pain before but they should have let me take her home long before when they could not find anything.  They where ok about paying when i can.<br>  <br>  My mums horse who was very ill got a visit by a drunk vet and he done nothing but charged her for it, she is not paying it tho.<br>  <br>  More should be talked about between vet and owner to minimise costs or they should be more regulated to avoid overpricing|`|811921e95b3795dad10075b3f9e12029aa	I am so mad with the vets too.  My dog had a sore patch of skin, and 3 visits later  and ￡150 lighter in pocket they told me the tablets weren't working.  Then they suggested doing 'a skin scrape' - basically taking the top of the skin off with a blade, to see if there were bugs, but claimed they couldnt see anything even under the microscope.  They are not going near my dog again- I changed vets.|`|f5a8d99afbb73cd0703df99b87996901aa	Not really because I'd rather be safe than sorry.  Some vets do try to charge more than necessary so the best thing to do is ask around to people who have pets as to how they like their vet. Word of mouth is the best way to find a trustworthy vet.|`|vwC7klVVaa	It is hard for vet to sometimes tell what wrong without doing test as are pets can't tell them how they feel and were it hurts. I have never regretted taking any of my pets to the vets and paying for any test they have need . Even if the test proved everything was ok . I have fantastic vets who i have been with for years and i know sometimes that have to do test to rule things out just like  doctors have to . But they would never doing anything just to make money. Just be gratefull you cat is fine and what every would do don't give your cat human anti-acids tablets as they are dangerous to animals.|`|Ksbf5OUQaa	They have to rule out things by doing x rays and such, or would you rather they'd just said "oh its indigestion" and she'd died of something else because they hadn't done an xray or other tests!! Also they wouldn't have done xrays etc without good reason, so they have acted in your cats best interests and tried their best to find out what was wrong with her.|`|0J1cYbXQaa	You vet depends upon your explanation, they ask many questions to come to a decision, they are reliant upon signs from the cat and descriptions of symptoms and history from you so when you rush along saying they may have swallowed something they will react in accordance. I have a great deal of respect for my vets<br>  <br>  I am glad your cat is fine now that's the main thing|`|yldVFIcXaa	I hope you were joking about the anti-acid tablets.<br>  <br>  You really shouldn't give any animal medicine that's designed for humans.

If they took that approach the animal could die whilst vet and owner sat and waited to see what happened.|`|0Gyrecxxaa	I feel your pain, trust me. Tomorrow is "vet day" here and routine maintenance alone is going to cost me in the neighborhood of $400. The birds toenails need trimmed....all the dogs and cats need shots....Carmel has the sniffles....YIKES!!<br>    I once paid $1000 to an emergency vet because I thought my Yorkie was dying. When his face swelled up and he started falling out I freaked. Carted him to this "emergency" hospital at 3 am. They demanded a $500 deposit up front and then they ran hundreds of dollars worth of tests..found nothing. Had me believing he had Parvo. Told me if I didn't let them put him in the hospital, at $250 a day, he would die. Told me he'd been poisoned (they thought), which I knew was bull. Snatched him out of there, off of the IV, at 12 pm that  day and carted him to my regular vet who'd been out of town. She took one look at his face and said.."go home and check the attic stupid, you've got hornets in the house and he obviously tried to eat one and lost." I was a BIT angry. Antibiotics and some Benedryl, Benji was good as new in two hours flat.<br>     Would I do it again? Absolutely....and so will you! People who are truly owned by these creatures will stop at nothing when one is in pain. All you can think clearly is "fix it FAST" just as you did. Don't feel bad. We've all done it a few times. We'll all do it again. You did the right thing, no doubt about it.|`|E53fC992aa	its the same when you spend a lot of money trying to get the animal better and then it has to be put to sleep as that's what happened to me ,my cat went missing for a week and turned up at the bottom of the garden unable to walk i just knew it would not live but the vet gave me hope and keep treating him again the minute they would drain his lungs they would fill up again every other day i would take him back i would sit and watch him of a night drag himself out of his bed and use his litter tray and it was heart breaking in the end i sore a different vet and he took one look at him and said there was no hope to put him to sleep i would of worked a 24hr day to pay for the vet bill to keep him alive if it did work ,don't get me wrong i know vets cant predect whats going to happen ,but i knew from the start he would not make it i just wish they had told me before it cost me ￡350|`|f1lpdiNEaa	As animals can't speak for themselves the vet can only go on what symptoms you explain to them. Maybe they thought she could have been hit by a car or something, especially if she complained when being touched. They probably did the quickest, most logical thing to try and find out what was wrong but unfortuntatly whatever they do to investigate it is going to be costly!<br>  <br>  She's ok now and you have the reassurance there's nothing wrong.

MKuDawP7aa	There are many products for cycling available too, but most in my opinion do not work well (although properly cared for BioSpira is effective).<br>  <br>  Another method is fishless cycling where un-scented pure ammonia is poured into the aquarium (3-5 drops per gallon pure ammonia) so as to bring your ammonia level to 4-5 ppm. Then it takes about 3-8 weeks for the aquarium to cycle. Although this method is growing in popularity, I do not recommend it, not because it does not work (it does), but because human nature is to want to add fish sooner than the 3-8 weeks it takes for this method.<br>  <br>  Another method is the gradual addition of fish food to an otherwise empty aquarium (no fish). This can be a very effective means of cycling that is preferred by many experienced aquarists. <br>  The method of adding “aged” media is much faster (you still have to take it slow), and provides all the necessary bacteria, the only negative is adding disease pathogens to your aquarium, but I have rarely encountered this problem.|`|stMcVPCMaa	Yes-your tank is cycling.  Yes, it is bad for your fish to be in there with high ammonia - but that's the most well-known and arguably the best way to get your tank to cycle, so leave them in there, and - Yes, you should add ammo lock.  Ammo lock does not reduce the ammonia, so it does not interfere with cycling and you will continue to read ammonia levels with your test kit, but it does protect the fish from its effects.  Keep an eye on your fish to ensure their health is not suffering, and do lots of water changes.  Don't add any more fish until your ammonia level declines, then you can slowly continue to add fish until you reach the limit for the size of your tank.|`|d8qGTIIgaa	yes|`|bDPVRtCNaa	Yes the tank is cycling, and yes it is bad for the fish. Ammonia is lethal even in minuscule amounts. <br>  <br>  So as to not interfere with your cycle try 10% partial water changes daily. The bacteria you want is in the substrate and the filter media, and not as much is found in the water. Don't vacuum the substrate, just remove water.
a1wly9wRaa	Barbs and Tetras get along with Gouramis and each other.|`|stMcVPCMaa	I'd keep some of the more aggressive tetras (relative to other tetras!) which is typically the larger varieties, such as buenos aires tetras and  black skirt tetras.  Congo tetras would probably do well also, because of their large size, although they are not as willing to stand up for themselves as most other tetras of the same size.  You can also try a Bolivian ram cichlid - I keep those successfully with tetras so they should be no problem with gouramis.  These are all relatively slow-moving fish, which matches the gourami's energy level, and will stand up for themselves without being likely to initiate aggression.  The tetras will be best in groups of 5 or more.  For your size tank I think the black skirt tetras (any fin variety or color) would be best as they are the smallest of these tetras, plus a ram chiclid if you like them.|`|BMri9tITaa	Corydoras, otoclinus, most tetras (though some are nippers, check before purchasing), rasboras, cherry barbs, rosy barbs.<br>  <br>  I wouldn't go with the barbs, though, as they can be speedy, which would tire the gouramis out.<br>  <br>  Corydoras are awesome.

DhE0rEWiaa	Hello, Tools you will need. Undercoat rake, Slicker Brush, Shed n blade, I do not recommend using the furminator on the Husky this tool is a 40 blade a surgical blade on a rubber handle and yes this tool dose cut the dogs coat every time you use it, this tool is not a brush and should not be used as one. <br>  <br>  If you are going to groom your dog I recommend investing in a blower to blow out all that undercoat especially with the husky and all that undercoat, This will help you allot and cut down on the brushing. <br>  <br>  As far as a good shampoo you want to use a soap free product and use a good conditioner. Tropiclean is a great product. <br>  <br>  The brush you are using is not going to get through the thick coat of the Husky you need a slicker brush. <br>  <br>  If you can you may want to set up a bathing area with warm water you can't get a dog clean enough or get the dogs rinsed out well, with the thick coat of the Husky using cold water will not do the job you will be rinsing the dogs forever. <br>  <br>  Two web sites to check out <br>  www.tropiclean.net <br>  www.petedge.com<br>  with pet edge check out the K9 blower, they run about $357.00 but it will be so worth for you as the owner of 2 Huskys, # ZT857 this will help to blow out all that undercoat and will help to cut down on all the brushing. <br>  <br>  All the tools you need, A good shampoo and conditioner rubber curry brush, slicker brush, undercoat rake, Shed n blade, K-9 blower. <br>  <br>  Use the curry brush when bathing this will help to work the shampoo into the thick coat of the Husky and to loosen up all the undercoat.|`|YUQgyPT3aa	A furminator is great for thick hair...also a shedding mitt to finish with after combing to get the remaining loose hairs off.|`|IdSqunZuaa	Here's what I know about Husky's grooming, check it out, <a href="http://lnk.nu/dogtime.com/t5h" rel="nofollow">http://lnk.nu/dogtime.com/t5h</a>|`|AA10229248	A furminator to brush out all the dead hair. A shop vac is very handy and has a double use - it will suck up the loose hair both in the house and on the dog. Some dogs will let you run the vacuum right over them and enjoy it. Most shop vacs also have a blower option. You can use the blower to blow dead hair off of a dry dog and blow water out of the coat of a wet dog after a bath.|`|I38WF5aFaa	Huskies don't need fancy grooming.  A bath and brush will cover it 95% of the time.  A slicker brush is the best I have found for removing shedding undercoat.  There are several brands and you get what you pay for.  My preferred brand is Universal.  A good metal comb will be handy during heavy shedding and a matt splitter is something you should have.  Don't forget nail trimmers and scissors to trim any long fur between their toes.  <br>  <br>  I don't like bathing huskies or any other dog too frequently.  It can dry the oils from their skin.  A quick daily brushing will remove most of the dirt without irritating the skin.  Once a month should be often enough to bathe a dog.  My huskies are bathed about 3 times a year unless they get into something extra nasty.

AA11101806	dogs can be quirky.  he may have just wanted to play.<br>  <br>  one of my dogs started barking when there was country music playing on my computer.  he stopped doing it when I stopped the music, and started again when I resumed the song.|`|lwCRXwjoaa	maybe its haunted
8cikAYp3aa	okay so the guy at the pet store is a total quack.. 7 is neutral.. Above 7 is basic or alkaline.. below 7 is acidic..  <br>  <br>  You shouldn't be keeping fish in with him unless they are feeders,  Because thats what they will become.  <br>  <br>  turtles do fine  in the 6 to  7.5 range..  depending on what kind you have.   my snappers tank runs about 6.8  and the red bellys  around 7.2  difference in diet I supose since they are filled from the same tap|`|FfxmE9Toaa	I would send an email to <a href="http://museum.mdwfp.com/" rel="nofollow">http://museum.mdwfp.com/</a> (Mississippi Museum of Natural Science.)

f5a8d99afbb73cd0703df99b87996901aa	A hamster who is safely in a secure cage is not going to be eaten.  I kept a hamster for a long time with 8 cats in the house.  He finally died of old age.  Make sure to secure the cage to a wall so it can't be tipped over.  There's really no way to keep the cat from trying but if it can't get to the hamster no damage can be done.<br>  <br>  Don't buy from pet shops who sell dogs and cats as these come from puppy mills most of the time.  If the place reeks of animal urine and is unkempt, go elsewhere.  The pet store we used to have had more dead fish floating in the tanks than live ones so finally people quit shopping there and it shut down.|`|SLSX6QQsaa	You can't change the nature of a cat, so you have to protect the hamster.  I had a very curious cat and a hamster when I was a kid.  I could not get the normal fun hamster cages, instead I had to make a special one that the cat wouldn't break into.  I did this by buying a 20 gallon fish aquarium and setting up my hamsters living space inside.  For the lid, my dad constructed a very heavy wooden lid which was much to heavy for any cat to pull off.  It fit exactly into the top of the aquarium.  He also drilled some (very tiny, thin) holes though the wood so he wouldn't suffocate (important!)  On the top of the wooden lid, he put a dresser handle on one end of it so I could easily pick up the lid.  You could also set a brick on top if you are concerned that your cat is too strong.  And if your cat is really strong, you might want to set the aquarium on the floor so he doesn't push it on the ground and break open the aquarium.|`|DIihJrUiaa	Just don't let the cat have access to the hamster! It's that simple really, as it is only natural that the cat may want to chase and even eat the hamster if they are together in the same room, especially if the hamster is not in its cage.|`|pDv13gJwaa	get a piece of paper and cut out the work clueless, now find some tape, take the paper and the tape and attach it to your forehead.. <br>  <br>  sounds to me like you have two very annoying pets but one sees the other as a toy, not good|`|z2TjjnxVaa	You can't! Some cats might not bother but it's natural to them. Just make sure they can't get a hold of the hamster....we have a hamster ball and the cats just like to watch him run around.|`|SQM20nuraa	When my friend brought over her two bird for me to babysit when she went Coconut Beach, I kept them on a fairly-leveled desk. You should also keep it in another room. That way the cats don't have access to it. And at night, put a sheet over the cage. Tuck it in so the cats don't lift up the sheet, too.|`|xarKlp0Oaa	It is just instinct for a cat to want to eat a hamster. They are rodents and cats just like them. All you can do is keep the hamster cage in a different room where the cat can't go.|`|pyEvNC8Taa	well, keep them away from each other. or make the experience of touching the hamster the worst ever so he/she won't do it again :)|`|UNFxjNHkaa	I have 3 cats - and a hamster... and they leave the hammy alone for the most part - if anything they'll jump up on the counter and sit next to the hammy's cage and watch her eat.  Fortunately, I am lucky that my cats do not want to kill/eat her.<br>  <br>  What you'll need to do is put the hamster somewhere where the cat will not have access to the hamster.  Like in another room where the door is always closed.<br>  <br>  Or, every time you see the cat trying to bother the hamster, get a spray bottle and fill it with water and give the kitty a little squirt - it will take a little while, but your cat will eventually learn not to go near the cage.
u1HahCoqaa	It is a rare breed, so I would assume quite a bundle. Sorry I cannot give you a price estimate.<br>  <br>  And I guess you could have it in your house, and could hold it in your lap, but horses do not house train, and they are not like cats or dogs who are content to snuggle up to people and sit on their lap. They may be little, but they are still horses.
TO3Ojjr0aa	I agree he feels insecure.  Ours will pee if you wake her up usually during the day.  She doesn't pee usually though.  But if my daughter has friends over and they get it out and bug it she'll pee.  I think it's a defense mechanism.  They do it when they are stressed.  <br>  <br>  So if I were you I'd change my approach.  Offer lots of treats by hand.  Get him to trust you and feel comfortable with you.  It takes time, let him explore your hand without picking him up.  Pick him up and put him down several times a day, get him used to you and then he'll happily go in your hands and not pee.  <br>  <br>  Yes, it is normal for them to chew chew chew.  Their teeth grow too long if they don't.  So make sure he has lots to chew on, sticks, treats, dry corn cob (look in the bird section).  They also like carrots and celery, hard nuts in the shell.  <br>  <br>  They will still bite their cages, but giving them things to chew helps.|`|xarKlp0Oaa	I have had many many hamsters and they all peed on me too. I think they are just so excited to get out of their cage that they just pee. They don't eat everything that they chew they just like to chew on things. This is very normal and you can buy some wood stick at your local pet store to stop them from chewing on other things.|`|oNHtVHzsaa	you should probably block off the glue in your aquarium because that could hurt his his stomach. it's ok for them to chew on this like their wheel, it will not hurt them because the pet stores make them so its ok if they buy them. your hamster may be scared of u, and thats why he is peeing on you. give him a few days to get used to you, and try to let him smell you, and then gently try to pick him up. if he resists to any of these, just leave him alone. he'll grow out of it. good luck and hope this helped.|`|YBVQDwSEaa	animal will do something stupid wen they feel unsafe..try to protect them self...even if the pet knws you...|`|24CFl7sjaa	Hamsters tend to like to elimate (pee) in one corner of their cage so he might be scared or marking, hard to say. I expect he will stop when he is more used to being handled<br>  All rodents have teeth that grow continually, they have to gnaw things to keep them at a comfortable length, they will chew on everything you give them. Get him a hamster chew he can destroy to help prevent him destroying his home.|`|RjyNInW6aa	he is just marking his territory. Though if you have other animals than yes you are scaring him but probably not. hamsters chew on everything so you don't have to worry.
b3b3292f0a82969ceed4f00b38611bccaa	My cat personally hasn't had one, but I belong to a Yahoo Group for asthmatic felines and many cats there have had them so i have read a lot about them. <br>  <br>  Most say do it as a last resort though I don't exactly remember the reasons. I know it's invasive. I remember reading it more than once because it was discussed that our cat may need to have one. I am by no means advising against it, you must do what must be done to get to a diagnosis so you can help the cat get well, just sharing what I have read about the subject. If your cat is sick, and this is a recommended diagnostic test then I would certainly say it's warranted. <br>  <br>  Do they think your cat has asthma? <br>  If so, check out <a href="http://www.fritzthebrave.com/index.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.fritzthebrave.com/index.html</a> <br>  and <a href="http://www.felineasthma.org/overview/index.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.felineasthma.org/overview/ind...</a> <br>  <br>  Good Luck.

J2UTO39vaa	Get her to the vet immediately. Animals have allergic reactions and other reactions to meds and vaccines all the time. A cat of mine died from liver failure from one of her kitten shots.<br>  <br>  The weird smell isn't good at all..... it means she's really sick.<br>  <br>  She sounds like she is dehydrating which can cause her to go down hill very very quickly.<br>  <br>  Vet visit- NOW!<br>  <br>  Good luck!|`|SLSX6QQsaa	It's probably something to do with the worming tablet.  I would definitely call the vet and see what he/she thinks you should do.  It depends on the cats individual situation and if the cat is very sick, the vet might even need to give your cat IVs to keep her hydrated or if it's too large of dose your cat could have OD'd.  Poor kitty.  Call the vet, now :)  Good luck.  I think she will be fine.|`|UNFxjNHkaa	take her to the vet - she def. could be having an allergic reaction.

s76aC4G8aa	The lower the quality of food the more a dog has to eat to get any nutrition let alone enough to satisfy him.  Iams is a low quality food with nothing but corn, wheat, soy and fillers, no meat and not enough protein to satisfy him.  Dogs eat their own feces because they are missing a nutrient from their diet.  Also 1 1/2 cups per day is not enough food for a labradoodle that's like 1/2 cup of food per feeding barely enough to sustain him and unless he is overweight should be fed a lot more food.  A dog of that size should probably eat 1-2 cups of food at each meal so he should be getting anywhere from 2-4 cups of food a day, no wonder he's hungry.  My Weimaraner gets at least 2 cups of food a day 2 times a day which is probably what your dog should be eating but my dog is on very high quality dog food therefore eats less of it.<br>  <br>  Since you're feeding IAMS you'll have to up his food in order to satisfy him so he should probably eat 4 cups per day 2 times a day.|`|EnwYxbS4aa	Some dogs just like humans have higher metabolisms (my cross breed eats twice the amount of my other 2 dogs and is still very slim)so the feeding instructions on the bag is an average guide only.<br>  <br>  Keep doing what your doing and once he doesnt start to get fat hes fine.  Iams is a good balanced food.|`|s4OtfZ7Gaa	the bag is usually not correct in their feeding suggestion, if he starts to gain too much weight, cut him back. iams is a good food, no worries there, but i would recommend you have him tested for worms|`|AA11101806	if you've been to a vet, and he has cleared all of the tests/checks that were done, AND there are no other problems, your dog might just have a high metabolism.|`|v2LTlc3Taa	You should probably investigate for worms, see a vet just in case. Some dogs (like people) can just naturally eat tons and never end up overweight.|`|wyfjsfikaa	If your dog is on month hart-gaurd or interceptor the likely hood of him having worms is very low. I would recommend getting your dog on a much higher quality of food. I really like california naturals, or any of the natura products they are good. If your dog is still really hungry you can feed him vegetables like green beans and carrots you can also add small amounts of oatmeal to his food (1 teaspoon for five pounds) stay away from corn.|`|AA12128656	you dropped the quality of the food, which may account for his increased apetite.<br>  in addition, having been wormed as a pup doesn't mean he's completely rid of the worms, and he may have actually picked them up again during his poo-eating. take a stool sample to the vet for a test. <br>  poo eating (corophragia) doesn't necessarily mean that he's starving. lots of dogs will do it, unless they are completely too stuffed to eat. it's a survival instinct, and means that the owner  isn't cleaning up the poo quick enough.<br>  do have his stool checked for worms, and get him on a better dog food.|`|zL1sggpCaa	I would suggest Bil-Jac personally... Our dogs love it.<br>  <br>  What you want to look for is a food that has little or no fillers (like grains of any kind). Dogs need meat, not grains. I can't tell you how many bags I looked at to see that the first ingredient listed was corn. And then meat by-products, not even real meat.<br>  <br>  So, my suggestion would be to find a better quality food. In return you will spend a bit more money, but he'll eat less of it. So, it kind of averages out. He'll be fuller and have better nutrition at that.<br>  <br>  Think about it this way... you can get by with eating McDonald's right? It isn't healthy for you, but your body can eat it... and of course, you feel horrible. BUT, if you were to grill up something lean, like a chicken breast fillet and have some whole grains and a salad, your body feels better.<br>  <br>  Same thing with dog food.|`|TSc8OE4vaa	Iams is a good brand of food, no need to switch.  He might just have a high metabolism.  Another possibility is that he has worms- do you worm him frequently?|`|AoSeHXeQaa	Have you had him wormed?  That might be a possible problem.<br>  I have a 100 lb dog who eats that much :o)<br>  <br>  In general, you dont have to feed as much of a good quality food.<br>  I feed Flint River Ranch nugget, which is a very high calorie and high nutrition food.  You might try feeding a better food, once he is wormed.<br>  <br>  ****<br>  Okay - then it is probably not worms.  Maybe he just has a high metabolism.  When my big dog was one year old, he used to eat a cup more every day than he does now (at two years), so yours may slow down as he gets older.<br>  <br>  I used to feed Iams, and at least the first ingredient is meat, not corn, unlike some of the supermarket brands.  A lot of people dont like it, but my 14 yr old lab mix ate it for most of her life.<br>  <br>  However, it is lower calorie than the food I feed now, and I have seen a tremendous difference in the dogs condition and coats since I changed them to Flint River Ranch.  If I were you, I would still give it a try.|`|JiCKFTuIaa	"Chicken" instead of "chicken meal" listed as the first ingredient is a scam employed by many dog food manufactures. At 8 pounds to the gallon of the water contained in "chicken" it takes very little of it to be listed first. After the water is removed during manufacturing that chicken would be lucky to be listed in the first 10 ingredients.<br>  You will notice that in both of the foods listed, a "meal" is listed second (chicken meal & chicken by-product meal). So the chicken is listed for your benifit, and the meal is for the dogs benifit.<br>  <br>  Don't know just what you consider "mini" but 3-4 cups/day is normal for a Labrador.|`|aEeCCHVlaa	Have you had him checked for worms?  If he stopped poop-eating after increasing the daily rations, it sounds like he was not getting enough nutrition before.  As in humans, tape worms will consume a large portion of the proteins ingested from eating. Or his metabolism could high.  A human with high metabolic rate can eat a lot of food and not gain very much weight.  Since his weight has leveled, this could also be the problem.<br>  Bottom line: have him checked out by your vet.
dgJcxkCGaa	He could have swallowed some if they are small enough or if he chewed off pieces. Dogs or puppies that chew rocks are missing some mineral in their diet. That is one of the reasons I know that they will chew on rocks or stones. He is a puppy so maybe he is using the rocks because he is teething if he is of that age. I would keep doing what you are as taking them away as you finding him chewing on them. I would also find a good chew toy for this pup and anytime you find him chewing on something he should not be replace it with the chew toy.|`|DIihJrUiaa	There is a chance he will swallow the stones or break his teeth chewing on them. The best thing to do is not to leave him unattended in the garden so he cannot chew on them, and to give him a suitable chew toy (not a bone as stated in another answer, bones can cause problems too!) to distract him.|`|AA11101806	no.  he doesn't know that he should not swallow them.<br>  <br>  if you want him to stop doing it, you have to correct the action/behavior while he is doing it.<br>  <br>  try giving him a nylabone, or give him  a treat when he finishes and you bring him inside.|`|btX6mM3Taa	Give him rawhides, bones, chew toys. As long as he cant choke on them they should be fine.|`|baf8d786caacbd70e08d18d9ba7c0c17aa	Give the dog a bone instead|`|5IcNNkkuaa	Just watch him closely when outside, and do what you have been... take them out of his mouth instantly.<br>  <br>  You could also invest in a training class, depending on how old your puppy is. They teach you commands such as drop it and leave it which will make your life a whole lot easier.
eyZhiXYpaa	It is wrong to 'baby' an animal as this will make them do it even more.<br>  <br>  I totally know where you are coming from though as I still do this with my 10 month old pup. After I tell him off, I cuddle and kiss him two seconds later - this is soooooo bad.<br>  <br>  Try to ignore him (it's tough I know).<br>  <br>  It is a shame I can't practice what I preach with this one.|`|1Is7u1wUaa	Ignore him! Your puppy cries because he knows you are going to give him attention for it!|`|AA12128656	he cries a lot because you've trained him to be a brat.<br>  <br>  if you keep giving him attention when he cries, he'll never shut up.<br>  <br>  in my house, crying means "i have to pee" so dogs that cry get put out.<br>  dogs should not be encouraged to cry or whine. when my dogs whine it means "i hurt something" so i check them out.<br>  <br>  how would you know whether your dog has to potty or is hurt if it never stops making noise, because you're training it that every time it makes a sound, you'll love it up?!<br>  <br>  there's two words i say to my dogs when they make unnecessary noise... "shut up".|`|OBwqjS8maa	If you pay attention to him when he cries, you're reinforcing the behavior. If you want him to continue crying, go ahead and pay attention to him, but if you want it to stop, it's best to ignore it. I know it's tough and heartbreaking, but it's really the best thing for him.
Uy79dKEmaa	Maybe he just looks like a Reggie!
DIihJrUiaa	It's all about taking things at the rabbit's pace and not forcing it on to her. Just sit down in her run and allow her to come up and sniff you and hop on you if she wants. Give little treats (such as a pellet of food) when she comes up so she knows you aren't a scary person! I would advise getting her speyed as soon as she is old enough (probably about 6 months) as this makes a real difference to their temperament and is essential health wise since unspeyed does are at a very high risk of uterine cancer. The main thing to consider with a Netherland Dwarf is their dental health, as due to their skull shape they are more inclined to teeth issues. Make sure she has access to hay at all times, plus lots of grass, and get her regular dental checks. Good luck with your new arrivals.|`|pyEvNC8Taa	teach it to jump over obsticles! that's really fun for the owner aaand the rabbit =D|`|GyyD8IuWaa	Be patient with her, and treat her with respect.

You need to maintain the nitrite level well below. Buy a recirculating submesible water filter which can reduce the nitrite or and ammonia levels. Keep the water clean without adding more food. Do not overcrowd the tank. You can use 2% of table salt (uniodised) in the tank.

You're gambling on a dog from parents with no health screening.  The dog may be fine his entire life, or he could develop expensive chronic health issues.  I'm assuming this lady also doesn't have any conformation or working titles on her dogs either?  The thing about seeing both parents is that it can give you an indicator of how your puppy's personality may develop.  So without being able to see the parents, without health testing, and without any indicator of the temperament or trainability of the parents you're taking a big gamble.  And the story about selling the mom and not having her any more is suspicious.  It sounds an awful lot like a story that a puppy broker, who acts as a middle man for puppy mills, would try to sell unwary buyers.<br>  <br>  In the end, it's up to you.  But personally if I'm going to pay a breeder good money for a puppy I would want a lot more information than what she seems to be able to provide.  It sounds like this puppy will be a total crapshot and honestly if I'm going to take that much of a risk I would rather save a life and rescue a dog than reward an irresponsible breeder for producing a litter.  A puppy like this might turn out just fine.  Or it could turn out to be a neurotic mental mess with health problems to boot.|`|N9pKl35Xaa	Sold the mother HA! Probably hidding it away due to its crazy illnesses. Either parent? Meaning the Dad is where? Ohhh thats right, she dunno who the father is! But than again if it is a proper breeder i wouldnt see the need because if you are seeing a proper breeder you would have done background checks on him/her/the breeding kennels. Proper breeders should have a hip and shoulder test done just for measure and the dog should have one shot that covers about 3different things.(well ours did some others have a few aswell) The b*tch from my older dog was on a plane back to QLD (QLD = Queensland, a state in Australia if you arent Australian? Or for those who arent Australian and are like WTF!?) for a Show when my dad went to see the breeder but the breeder had the male and had photos and everything of the b*tch. Footage, papers, awards this that and the other, everything to back his evidence that she was a purebred pedigree, qualified for breeding, no problems with hips etc etc. <br>  I would be insanely careful about seeing her about the dog, insanely insanely careful! Would even recommand not seeing her.|`|aCqSF87Raa	If there is no genetic testing and the mother dog is not available, do not buy from this person. Period. I would have doubts as to if she even ever owned the mother dog or if she "got rid of" the mother due to health or behavioral problems.<br>  <br>  Yes it is important to see and meet the parents dogs (both if possible.) You can tell a LOT about a pup just by looking at mom and/or dad - size, possible color, possible temperament or behavior... if mom is aggressive in any way that may be passed on to the pups for instance.<br>  <br>  I would not hesitate to walk away from this person - sounds like a bad situation and idea. Why not adopt from a shelter if you're just looking for pet quality? The quality of dog would be the same (no health testing, no parent viewing) but you wouldn't be supporting a BYB and you would be saving a life.|`|fOLO4TNhaa	I know your not looking for a show dog but if your willing to have the dogs life cut short also do you have the money for the mounds of vet bills you will be receiving, are you ready for heart ache and a dog that will be put to sleep at a younger age then most? Puppies that are not tested, cannot see the parents? SOLD the mother? They are defiantly back yard breeders looking for some extra pocket money. Please DO NOT buy from them. Look for a reputable breeder that test all there dogs have dam and sire on premises. And have health grantees for at least 3 or more years and provide papers and a health certificate. Doesn't have to be a show dog. BUT has to be healthy and live its full life pain free.|`|pc7ZjexJaa	It would be best to meet the parents<br>  <br>  This "breeder" seems a bit sketchy<br>  I would find a different pup

SzW9GmRsaa	Depends how close you are to anywhere.  Land nearer the A roads will cost more, if you're not too far from Ayr itself the price will go up ... land in the middle of nowhere will be cheaper.<br>  <br>  The best thing to do is get hold of a lawyer and find out exactly what's going on.  The landowner might just be picking figures out of thin air, but if you want any sort of legal protection from the system you'll have to get everything in writing and put in a written offer for the land.  A verbal offer isn't worth the paper it's not written on!  It's obviously costly to get solicitors involved but it keeps everything running smoothly.  They'll probably be able to give you pointers on how much to pay.  Be sure to use a local Scottish firm not an English one with a base in Scotland - they don't tend to have a clue how Scottish land law differs from English and are totally useless.|`|fc5e4f4741642787d64f7d84cccb7b94aa	Go to a few local feed stores or bigger barns and ask around.

Well she can reproduce but you can not register the littler. As beautiful as she may be, she does not meet the bread standard.

These birds also initially have grey irises which change to a pale yellow colour by the time the bird is a year old. The Congo grey parrot is found on the islands of Príncipe and Bioko and is distributed from south-eastern Ivory Coast to Western Kenya, Northwest Tanzania, Southern Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC) and Northern Angola. In aviculture, it is often called a "CAG".<br>      * Timneh African Grey Parrot (Psittacus erithacus timneh):<br>        These are smaller in size, have a darker charcoal grey coloring, a darker maroon tail, and a light, horn-colored area to part of the upper mandible. The timneh grey parrot is endemic to the western parts of the moist Upper Guinea forests and bordering savannas of West Africa from Guinea-Bissau, Sierra Leone and Southern Mali east to at least 70 km (43 mi) east of the Bandama River in Ivory Coast. In aviculture, it is often called a "TAG".

This tells you how much salt to use by the size:  <a href="http://www.aquariumlife.net/articles/tropical-fish/64.asp" rel="nofollow">http://www.aquariumlife.net/articles/tro...</a>|`|AA11901352	What kind of "spotted puffer"?  This is a generic name given to so many puffers.  Understand you need to know what kind since not all puffers can live in full salt, even if you attempt to acclimate them.  <br>  <br>  Green Spotted puffers Tetraodon nigroviridis go from fresh when fry to brackish not full salt as an adult.  Keeping or attempting to keep them in full salt will shorten their lives.  Some actually do well while others won't in full salt.<br>  <br>  A white spotted puffer Arothron hispidus is full marine only <br>  <br>  Spotted Congo puffer Which is full salt as well.<br>  <br>  T. fluviatilis is a brackish water pufferfish. T. nigroviridis can handle small amounts of salt (they actually do better with some salt), but is considered a freshwater fish.  T. schoutedeni is a purely freshwater fish, <br>  <br>  You need to know what kind of fish first.  If you are attempting to acclimate a fresh water fish to salt it won't work.  If your fish is getting older and needs more salt simply start adding more salt when water changes are done.<br>  <br>  You cannot simply take a fresh water fish and start adding little bits of salt or salt water to a bag and float them to acclimate them.|`|QV6swGUMaa	read this i found it about them.<br>  You should have already set the tank up and had it running before you purchased the fish. These puffers can acclimate to fresh water when they are young but should eventually be turned over to brackish water and finally to full saltwater. You will need to get yourself some marine salt mix and a hydrometer, if you don't already have them. However, if you don't already have the tank set up the outlook is not so good for these fish. If you already have a fresh water tank set up and running then you should be fine for now with them in there they will just need to be acclimated to the fresh water slowly. Turning your freshwater tank into a brackish tank is not so hard. You can gradually adjust the salinity by adding a little marine salt to some of your tanks water, wait for it to dissolve and then slowly add it to your tank. After some time has passed check the salinity. If you are not getting a reading then do it again the next day and continue with this each day until you are getting a salinity of 1.010. This will be at a good brackish level. The puffers can live in this for a while until they start to get bigger at which time you may want to change them over to full salt water. Remember to add salt to the right salinity when doing your partial water changes. Get the salt level correct in a bucket before you add the new water to your tank. There are allot of things that go along with keeping a saltwater tank and I could sit here and write an entire book to explain it to you. In the mean time do some research and some reading on how to set up and maintain a saltwater tank so you can prepare yourself for switching your puffers over to saltwater when the time comes. <br>  hope it helps.|`|MKuDawP7aa	This is a quick guide to determine which puffers are from freshwater, brackish and marine.<br>  <br>  Fresh water Puffers:<br>  <br>  Auriglobus modestus; --- Bronze puffer<br>  <br>  Carinotetraodon borneensis; --- Bornean redeyed puffer<br>  <br>  Carinotetraodon irrubesco; --- Red tailed redeye puffer<br>  <br>  Carinotetraodon salivator; --- Striped redeye puffer<br>  <br>  Carinotetraodon travancoricus; --- Dwarf Puffer<br>  <br>  Colomesus asellus; --- South American Puffer<br>  <br>  Monotrete abei; --- Abei Puffer<br>  <br>  Tetraodon baileyi; --- 'Hairy' puffer<br>  <br>  Tetraodon barbatus<br>  <br>  Tetraodon cochinchinensis; --- Fangs Puffer<br>  <br>  Tetraodon cutcutia; --- Common Puffer<br>  <br>  Tetraodon duboisi; --- Dubois' Freshwater Puffer<br>  <br>  Tetraodon lineatus; ---Fahaka puffer<br>  <br>  Tetraodon mbu; --- Mbu Puffer<br>  <br>  Tetraodon miurus; --- Congo Puffer<br>  <br>  Tetraodon palembangensis; --- Palembang Puffer<br>  <br>  Tetraodon pustulatus; --- Cross River Puffer<br>  <br>  Tetraodon suvattii; --- Arrowhead Puffer<br>  <br>  Tetraodon turgidus; --- Brown Puffer<br>  <br>  <br>  Brackish Puffers<br>  <br>  <br>  Colomesus psittacus; --- Banded Puffer<br>  <br>  Tetraodon biocellatus; --- Figure Eight Puffer<br>  <br>  Tetraodon erythrotaenia; --- Red-striped Toadfish<br>  <br>  Tetraodon fluviatilis; --- Ceylon Puffer<br>  <br>  Tetraodon nigroviridis; --- Green Spotted Puffer<br>  <br>  Tetraodon Sabahensis; --- Giant Spotted Puffer<br>  <br>  <br>  Marine Puffers<br>  <br>  <br>  Arothron caerulopunctatus; --- Blue-spotted Puffer<br>  <br>  Arothron diadematus; --- Masked Puffer<br>  <br>  Arothron hispidus; --- White-spotted puffer<br>  <br>  Arothron manilensis; --- Narrow-lined Puffer<br>  <br>  Arothron mappa; --- Map puffer<br>  <br>  Arothron meleagris; --- Guineafowl Puffer<br>  <br>  Arothron nigropunctatus; --- Dog-faced Puffer<br>  <br>  Arothron reticularis; --- Reticulated Puffer<br>  <br>  Arothron stellatus; --- Starry Toadfish<br>  <br>  Canthigaster bennetti; --- Bennett's Sharpnose Puffer<br>  <br>  Canthigaster coronata; --- Crowned Puffer<br>  <br>  Canthigaster papua; --- Papuan Toby<br>  <br>  Canthigaster rostrata; --- Caribbean Sharpnose Puffer<br>  <br>  Canthigaster solandri; --- Spotted Sharpnose<br>  <br>  Canthigaster valentini; --- Saddled Puffer<br>  <br>  Diodon holocanthus; --- Porcupine Puffer<br>  <br>  Sphoeroides annulatus; --- Bullseye Puffer<br>  <br>  Sphoeroides marmoratus; --- Guinean Puffer<br>  <br>  Takifugu niphobles; --- Niphobles Puffer<br>  <br>  Takifugu oblongus; --- Lattice Blaasop<br>  <br>  Takifugu ocellatus; --- Fugu Puffer<br>  <br>  Takifugu pardalis; --- Panther Puffer<br>  <br>  Takifugu rubripes; --- Tiger Puffer

Exercise will often help move things along.  Hopefully it is just constipation, and you may need to change her diet.  HOWEVER, realize that bowel obstructions are VERY dangerous, so if she is showing any addtional signs of being sick....lethargy, vomiting, not eating, etc, she needs to see the vet immediately.|`|uZlWMDq2aa	A dog poops at least 6 hours or less. but its best to take your dog out at least twice a day so he want go in the the house. But if your expecting to house train your dog you should take him out at least 4 times a day so he can know that outside is were he should poop. and every time he uses the bathroom outside praise her so she knows its a good thing to go outside. <br>  P.S. check around the house just incase, you never know where dog leave their dropplets|`|xarKlp0Oaa	You may have to change her food to a canned food temporarily because it is richer and will make her poop.

MKuDawP7aa	Dog training problems can stump many pet owners, but how to get your puppy to stop biting? Well, that one is a very common complaint among puppy owners and I'll explore it further in this article.<br>  <br>  Biting is a defense mechanism for animals, including our domesticated dogs. A dog needs to be able to protect himself from attacks from other dogs and biting is a natural response. Dogs are also carnivores and in the past had to be able to tear apart their food to eat. Keep in mind, too, that puppies are getting new teeth and are teething. When this occurs it feels good to the puppy to bite. Puppies first learn to bite when in the litter. Have you ever noticed how rough they play? They are learning what is acceptable biting as the other puppies will squeal if the bite is too hard. This feedback helps them to learn how to control their jaw and develop bit inhibition or "mouthing" instead of biting hard.<br>  <br>  If you want to know how to train your puppy to stop biting, you can start off by thinking like a dog. When your pup's biting hurts you, squeal to let your pup know. Sometimes that might get them more excited so if that's the case, try your own negative tone instead.<br>  <br>  Just as with any unwanted behavior, you should reward attention to good behavior and ignore bad behavior. If your puppy is nipping at your feet, don't give her attention until she stops. Try walking away from her without giving her notice.<br>  <br>  You can also try substituting a safe toy for biting, instead of your body parts. This will help them learn what is acceptable and reinforce the good behavior. When she starts biting you, hand her a chew toy instead.<br>  <br>  Please do let them know that it's not okay to bite. One way to do this is to give them a tap on the nose and say "no bite" when they start biting. Eventually they will make the connection that this fun biting thing gives you displeasure and they should stop.|`|AA12128656	redirect his biting to a chew toy, and encourage that.<br>  if he still tries to bite you, playtime is OVER.<br>  <br>  <br>  schipperke mom.... training should be done without yelling.<br>  when you train your dog to listen to you talk softly, the dog will listen better its whole life.|`|9kTejB0uaa	Perfectly normal.  Take his face in your hands, look him in the eye and calmly say 'NO BITING!', and give him one of his toys.  Also fold your arms and turn away.  He will soon realise this behaviour doesn't get any response and switch to doing something else.  And you do have to defuse the situation - the more manic they get at this age, the more nipping they will do.  It's what they did in the nest, but it does need stopping when they are puppies.|`|93ix6nyvaa	I'm having the same problem with my 4 month old too. When he starts biting aggressively, we yell "NO!" and give him a toy to play with, and it usually works. If it doesn't work, then we'd get up and yell "NO!" and walk away and ignore him for a few minutes. We need to let him know that playtime ends when you start being mean and biting hard.|`|YUQgyPT3aa	Its called training...and it should start from day one.<br>  <br>  Obedience, manners, and Crate training.<br>  <br>  This will also help with potty training.|`|AA11101806	tell him  "no bite!!"<br>  <br>  use corrective behavior with this, and force him to release when he does it.|`|89c7e5af6668337660a2665976affbf3aa	Tell him "no bite" and give him a toy that he can chew on in place of your hand.|`|kT0r8husaa	Our mini doodle had a big problem with biting as a puppy.  It took until he was about 8 mos. old to quit on demand by saying "no bite", but he finally learned it.  The problem was my husband would play rough and let him play bite with him, then the puppy started playing with everyone that way.  I would tell the kids to squeal loudly whenever he put his mouth on them and bit with pressure, that's what his siblings in the litter would do to let him know he was biting too hard.  It's how dogs learn in their own lingo.  Eventually as he gets older the "no bite" command can be learned.  Whenever we say it he stops biting and starts licking. :), it's funny.  Also, whenever you get down on the floor to play always have a toy in your hand to put in his mouth when he starts getting too rough.  You can also have a leash on him at all times in the house, when he won't listen or you can't catch him, grab the leash and start working on your commands, (sit, lay down, etc.) and get him mind on something else.|`|wyfjsfikaa	The best way to teach your puppy to not bite is bite inhibition training. When the puppy bite you, you need to let out a yelp as if you are a litter mate signaling to the dog that it hurts. The yelp needs to be a high pitched quick noise that surprise the puppy bit does not scar him, if this does not work, quickly stand up fold your arms and Huff off for a couple of mins then resume play. Soon your puppy will learn that his biting you will stop the play immediately. Please read the links to fully understand how this works and why.|`|xarKlp0Oaa	When he bites or nips all you can do is say NO as sturn as you can. After time it will stop since he is still just a baby.

dnl66ZXTaa	Make sure you keep them away from all other fish until they get bigger or the other fish will eat them.   But some fish flakes in a tiny plastic baggie and crush them into very fine flakes.  You can feed them fish flakes and they will be healthy and accept the food but you can also buy freeze dried bloodworms and freeze dried shrimp to add to their diet which will help make them grow faster.   You also should put a heater in with the fish because the colder water will make them want to hide.  GOOD LUCK!|`|FkGh0LuWaa	You can feed them fry food or crushed flakes.|`|stMcVPCMaa	That depends on the type of fish.  Fry hatch in many sizes, from large enough to eat crushed flake food to so small they can only eat infusoria.  You'll have to tell us what kind of fish these are to get a valid answer.|`|7kJmoufUaa	Frozen rotifers.
BWZ6pBoHaa	I had a dog who did the same thing.  She was diagnosed with Allergic Bronchitis.  Take your dog to a canine internal medicine vet for a diagnosis and meds.  My regular vet also scoped my dog and found nothing.  Your dog needs to see the specialist, your regular vet can refer you to one.|`|GSf09ALBaa	If that is all your vet did, I would go to another vet.  This could be the first sign of heartworm infestation, kennel cough and a slew of other things.  Get him to another vet now.  He needs blood work done!|`|Sl9lwyVdaa	My dog does the same thing, when he is excited or nervous.  I usally make him move around or rub his throat. <br>  I took mine to the vet also and they couldn't find nothing wrong with him. Just try to take his mind off of it.|`|mOFShz3Eaa	take him to a GOOD vet there could be serious problems, or it could be nothing. i had a dog who had a problem with inward sneezes, yes dogs can do this. it sounded kinda like a cough sneeze choke, had him checked out and found that this was all it was. its better to be safe thn sorry so i would find a good vet soon if i was you.|`|VwmaWcp9aa	My Boston pup did that and it turned out to be kennel cough.
JGq9rKBOaa	Sign up for classes!<br>  <br>  Sure, you can train basic commands on your own, but with very intelligent dogs, they usually appreciate the "extra work" and socialization. A "puppy kindergarten" would be a good start, but don't stop there - some dog obedience schools offer higher level obedience and even agility classes. Depending on where you are, you might be able to find places to do some herding. You don't need to turn him into a "working dog," but a few classes  will keep him mentally occupied and TIRE HIM OUT.<br>  <br>  With high-energy dogs, a tired dog is a happy dog!<br>  <br>  Also, I'd definitely invest in a fence. It allows for more freedom than a chain, and more protection as well. If you're in an area where people have free-roaming dogs, or there are a lot of strays, a chained dog is vulnerable and at a big disadvantage. I live in Trinidad and there are tons of street dogs. Most people here keep their dogs in fenced in yards, and I've seen the street dogs try to start fights through the fences! <br>  <br>  That said, I wouldn't recommend keeping him outside alone for any significant part of the day. Dogs like to be around the family. A lot of people think that dogs are happier with space to run and play outside, but honestly, the "emotional problems" that can come from being isolated in the yard are a bigger problem. Some structured exercise - an agility class, a long walk, a game of fetch - will give a dog plenty of exercise and "outside time."|`|moIPv7pFaa	When he gets old enough, get him neutered. An unaltered cattle dog can be WAY more than you might be able to handle; especially if he's not doing what he was bred for. Teaching him to fetch will be a fun game for him. Also, long walks and playing with other dogs and training classes (like others have suggested) would be good for him too.|`|wyfjsfikaa	When You are away he should be kenneled to keep him safe and from being destructive from boredom. I would also invest in a puppy kindergarten class and interactive games like tug-a-jug, Kong's, Puzzle balls. all of which you fill with food to keep the dog working for it reward.|`|BWZ6pBoHaa	What you really got is an Australian Cattle Dog.  You need to put up a fence, an outdoor kennel, something!  When the dog gets older, find a cattledog trainer and get your dog on livestock.
AA12083992	Change her diet means feed her a better brand of food. Poor quality foods will cause excessive shedding.Our pets need quality  food. Read the ingredients list and learn what the stuff on there is and what it does (or does not do) to/for our pets. A quick pet food 101. If the pet food contains corn/corn products or by products it is a poor quality food. Corn is a filler that can trigger skin problems. (allergies, skin problems, itching and excessive shedding) By products is anything from an animal not fit for human consumption, including cancerous tissue. Do not pay attention to advertising, they all say there food is great. "Vet approved" means they have a vet on staff to approve their product. In other words, someone paid to approve it. Same with foods most vets recommend. Salesmen "gift" vets then the vet recommends the food. Most vets are not nutritionists! Quality foods have meat as the first ingredient Wellness, Solid Gold, Innova and Merrick are a few of the best brands available.

It could be that she needs more fish oils and omegas for her skin and the symptons are losing and excessive shedding.  I recommend you look at dogfoodanalysis.com and find out what they rate your current food as and give you an idea of how good her diet really is.<br>  <br>  In the meantime, I recommend you go to your nearest horse tack shop and buy a bottle of Miracle Groom made by Absorbine.  The stuff in nothing short of liquid gold in my opinion, spray down the dog with it once for three days straight, towel dry after each spraying, and use a slicker brush to brush out the loose fur.  After the initial three days, spray her down every three days for two weeks, then once a week for a month, then once every other week.  You will see an incrediable difference in her coat, lack of shedding, you won't need any other shampoos or conditioners, no doggie smell, dirt literally falls out of their coat and doesn't stick.  This stuff is amazing.

We use a rubber curry comb (made for horses) on him back wards, and outside. With them being so slick coated combing the frontwards does nothing.

vBR9nB81aa	Depending on the horse, I use either quilts (or pillow) and standing wraps, or I use shipping boots when going out of the city. I would not just use the standing polo wraps as they do not offer the protection that the pillow wraps do. They work great for ground work, but outside of that, if you need to wrap a leg in the stall or trailer, always use a quilt or pillow wrap underneath. It can cause damage to your horses leg otherwise, especially if not wrapped properly. Good luck!|`|VyiUHuVVaa	You should use pillow and standing wraps to trailer a horse- not polo wraps which don't offer enough protection.|`|36612d416e7176f5335f2b3fb47cf46caa	I don't see it being a problem as long as the leg is padded and protected.|`|iiNAJfGCaa	Actually, you will want to use shipping wraps... which are similar to standing wraps but are longer and cover the bulbs of the heels. Standing wraps are often used to help with injuries (bowed tendons, reduce swelling, etc.) Polo wraps will be useless. You want something that protects the horse up to his knees and down to his heels. I have seen some people use standing wraps coupled with bell boots, which works as well if you don't have shipping wraps on hand. Just make sure you KNOW how to wrap... otherwise you are endangering your horse more than if you didn't wrap at all.|`|zBhwEbUkaa	Yes. That is going to be your best bet on keeping your horses safe when traveling.

In general I would think of an amateur as just that, not much experience at all.  Junior being a young rider of any level.<br>  <br>  Competition wise, Junior could pertain to horse or rider, a divisional class.   Amateur in this category could very depending on association.  Rodeo, amateur would be non pro but potentially very high skill level.  Some other associations, amateur pertains to amount of earning won, if you have won more that x amount of dollars you can't run in an amateur or "novice" class unless. (based on rider) Or the class is listed "novice or ameteur horse" then the rule applies to the earnings of the horse. etc. etc. etc.    I think your question would be answered a little more clearly if we knew exactly what situation you are pertaining too.  But in general, junior is young rider and amateur is beginner, non experienced.|`|fpBUrBWaaa	im  junior rider and i dont even have a horse. i barley ride horses and i still do very well. most skills that junior riders have are trotting.
m72ZD6AJaa	I appreciate the love you have for animals and the desire to give one a home, but I don't think a dog is right for you right now. Leaving a dog alone for 6 hours a day isn't the worst, but if you are it's only caretaker, you will need to make up that time AND put in extra time for training. <br>  <br>     Dogs are extremely sensitive and need to be trained right away to ensure they are learning everything they need to learn to be well-mannered and behaved; you don't want an insecure, untrained dog that will rampage while you are gone. Also, look into crate training and the book "How to train a puppy you can live with" which uses positive training methods. <br>  <br>     If you aren't completely set on a dog, why not get a cat? They are fun, snuggly, and they are pretty much self-sufficient; no real training needed beyond proper housebreaking. You just have to be sure to clean the litter box every day when needed and give them plenty of toys for stimulation.<br>     Or guinea pigs; they were my first apartment pet and they are great!

A dog really really, needs alot of attention and a place to run and get alot of exercise. You don't seem to have the qualifications there to have a dog. and unless you have the time and room for a dog you really shouldn't get one. It is almost abuse to keep a dog locked up in a cage all day, with no one there, and not any exercise to be had. If a dog had a back yard fenced to run around in all day it wouldn't be so bad. It sounds like You really need to get a cat. They can go long periods without any one. As long as you leave food and water they'll be ok. They don't need as much love and care as a dog. A cat takes care of itself. go for the cat. it's a better match for you right now.<br>  That is probably why your guardians don't want you to have a dog. they know theres not the things there a dog needs to have to be  happy and healthy.|`|IdSqunZuaa	This is a good question!

You sound quite responsible - it is very important that you research what breeds will suit your lifestyle BEFORE you get one (which is obviously what you are doing).<br>  <br>  I would go for something like a toy or miniature poodle. These don't shed, don't bark too much (remember ALL dogs bark as this is their voice). They are easy to train and as with all dogs adjust to some time alone.<br>  <br>  YOU MUST make sure that the dog can be let outside by someone during the time you are not there i.e. a dog shouldn't be forced to hold it's bladder for 6 hours.<br>  <br>  Please also note that you will probably have to go for an older dog (maybe a rescue) - you cannot leave a puppy alone until it is given time to adjust i.e. an hour hear and there etc.  A pup should become an adult from 12 months onwards.<br>  <br>  If a pup is left alone too much too soon it will suffer from separation anxiety and could lead to tearing your house up.<br>  <br>  Be wise - good luck my friend.<br>  <br>  Poodles are also good alert dogs and can adapt to apartment life (as they are small).|`|F4OKs8efaa	The Border Terrier is an active dog, so it won't do for you, are you sure you should be getting a dog if you haven't got enough time to take care of it?

XPcnHs7Iaa	Yes.<br>  It is actually an immune system issue.  In times of stress, it can reappear. Oral ivermectin will help control it. It really isn't contagious between Mom and pups, but it is genetic.  Mom's mites invade puppies hair follicles before their immune system is strong enough to fight them off.  If they have the same immune weakness mom has, then they will battle it always just like mom.|`|Uigvko5Laa	Simple answer, yes.<br>  <br>  Long answer, all dogs have the dem mange dormant to one degree or another but if a dog has a bout of generalize dem mange as an adult there is/was something out of whack with their immune system in regards to dem mange, if it was out of whack in the past, chances are it will be in the future. Sar mange even though it is much more contagious to other dogs, it is much easier to treat for the long term.<br>  <br>  Your best bet is prevention, a high quality 4 star or better food(non-grain/wheat/filler), regular vet visits and vacines. The key is put as little stress and distraction on the immune system as possible.|`|Be6Dlk9Aaa	yes it's possible. or it could be a different parasite, or a completely different problem.<br>  the vet will be able to look at the skin and take samples to determine what it is. good luck.|`|AA11244754	you could do one of two things that would be easier and more reliable than asking on here, a) research it yourself, b) call your vet and ask|`|eyZhiXYpaa	Of course it can resurface. You dog would have just contracted it again, probably from another dog that it has come into contact with - Sarcoptic mange is highly contagious in dogs and remember, it is also contagious to humans from dogs.<br>  <br>  Mange is a parasitic skin disease caused by microscopic mites and you need antibiotics from the vet if you have any concerns.<br>  <br>  Watch out for rashes throughout your family just in case.<br>  <br>  Good luck.

eyZhiXYpaa	Puppy nerves.  You MUST ignore the cries at night.<br>  <br>  Get a crate for him if you haven't already and pop him in it at night and leave him - do not EVER approach him and let him out of the crate whilst he is crying - otherwise he will continue to do this.<br>  <br>  My pup cried for around 2 hours the first night and then it gradually got better.  He will adjust.<br>  <br>  You could also ball up some socks and pop them in his crate (so he feels like he is with his litter mates), a ticking clock is also good to have near his bed as this resembles the mothers heart beat.<br>  <br>  You have made a mistake with him but this can be repaired.<br>  <br>  If you don't have a crate, get one and pop him a nice warm bed in there.  Start crate training him immediately and help him get used to his new bedroom.<br>  <br>  IGNORE the crying.<br>  <br>  Good luck.|`|1Is7u1wUaa	I'm glad you posted this question because I need to tell you that what you have been doing is making the whole problem worse! Sorry! Leave him downstairs, go to bed and if he barks completely ignore him! If you go down when he is barking he will only think that the barking got you there and by rewarding him with your presence will only do it again and again. Expect a couple of weeks before he stops barking, it will probably get worse before it gets better, but remember he has just been taken away from his mum and siblings so is bound to be feeling lonely, you just have to teach him that at night time he sleeps downstairs and you get up when you want to not when he wants you too. However, having said that, as he is still very young and not house trained yet, you will have to get up in the night to take him to the toilet. Make sure this is at the same time every night so your puppy gets used to a routine and only go down when he is being quiet. This should help him not to think that you are coming down when he is barking.  Also when you take him to the toilet during the night, don't make any fuss, just let him out, make sure he goes the toilet, give a little praise so he knows he's done right and go straight back upstairs and ignore any barking!<br>  <br>  An alternative is that you could keep him in your room, and gradually move him out of your room and downstairs a bit at a time so he gets used to not being with you at night.|`|Imn5oOWiaa	I just got a puppy 3 days ago too! He's a little thing though. toy fox terrier / yorkie mix. <br>  <br>  I went and bought a cage for him the same day i got him, i put a nice fluffy blanket in there, a couple small toys to keep him occupied and a puppy pad incase he has to go potty. <br>  and before bed i put him in there and put a blanket over top of his cage.

It will stop.|`|O6SBsgO8aa	Put a t-shirt you have worn in with him at night.  also you could put a stuffed animal in with him.  He misses his littermates he was used to cuddleing up with.

This will last for about a week but go to be and place his bed next to yours so that you can be there to reassure him.  Don't let a puppy upset your whole routine because when you do return to it (if you keep what you are doing up) this will only confuse the little guy; or if you don't want to do all that, put him in bed with you, he will cuddle up next to you and it will help him adjust to his new environment because he will have your body heat and hear your heartbeat but don't sleep on the sofa any more or else he will think that is where you always sleep.|`|OxFsslN8aa	Unless you want to sleep this way from now on, I would change the arrangments.  You are conditioning the pup to only sleep when being held.  Puppies are used to sleeping with littermates and when you take one away it will cry but this doesn't last long.  If you don't mind, many people allow their dogs to sleep with them in the bed.  My dogs sleep in their own beds next to mine where I can hang my hand over the edge & reassure them that I am near.  Some people put ticking clocks near the pup to simulate the heartbeat of the mother dog.

Some possibilities include a sebaceous cyst (minor) which is caused by an inflamed oil gland in the skin, an abscess from a bite or other wound (can be serious) or cervical lymphadenitis (the lump is usually larger in this one and can be either harmless or serious if bacteria leak out of the inflamed lymph node and into the blood).<br>  <br>  A good small animal vet should be able to help you sort it out.

Then you better move one of the adults to a different home. Bitches rarely get over/get past a fight like that.|`|5bYpbodUaa	Have you ever watched the Dog Whisperer with Cesear? I have. And WOW...he certainly can make a difference with dogs and their owners. <br>  <br>  Exercise is one of the main keys to keeping a dog, like border collies, and others, well managed. They need to release a lot of energy. You have two very energetic dogs, (the border collies). They need a good 45-60 minute walk every day each. <br>  <br>  I would suggest calling Cesar from the Dog Whisperer and asking advice on this. Since you brought a new dog to the mix, he can help you to introduce this new dog in a more healthy way for all of you.  :-) <br>  <br>  I'm going to go try and find his website...brb...Ok..here it is. This is amazing. Watch the video he has and watch how he works with dogs. He's just absolutely amazing. I love watching him.<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.cesarmillaninc.com/dogwhisperer/" rel="nofollow">http://www.cesarmillaninc.com/dogwhisper...</a><br>  <br>  I'm sure his contact info is on there too.  Hope this helps.|`|Bh6NwFzeaa	I hate to say it , But you should never have two females and a male. Especially if the male is the puppy. Both females think the male pup is theirs and will fight to the death over it. I had two older females and then got a male pup. Those two females fought everyday over him. I have the scars on my hands to prove it. Many times I came home and they were locked on each others necks. Fur and blood everywhere. <br>  Make sure they are all fixed and then you have to do alot of training.|`|Iyl5N9EKaa	The dogs need to be constantly supervised especially with a new arrival. Slowly introduce them to the dog by having them in the same room for short periods of time. Make sure the collies are getting plenty of attention and exercise. A tired dog, is a happy dog. Make sure you are feeding the collies first, and letting them out first to help establish alpha roles. Do not tolerate any misbehaviour. Try to separate the fighting before it gets out of hand, spray water or make crashing sounds if you can not interfere. Usually thought and planning goes into doing something like bringing home a new puppy to ensure smooth transitions. I must advise you not doing this twice. I would advise you taking the puppy to obidence school because it would benefit both you and the dogs.|`|IdSqunZuaa	Dog-dog aggression is a very serious matter. Until your dogs are successfully treated, keep them a safe distance from each other ("safe distance" meaning the minimum amount of space they need to remain calm and unstressed).<br>   <br>  Here's more details, <a href="http://lnk.nu/dogtime.com/ry0.html" rel="nofollow">http://lnk.nu/dogtime.com/ry0.html</a>|`|lqt3wTQvaa	are they spayed?
fFtBqFB6aa	keep her on a leash?????|`|9kTejB0uaa	Er - have you ever heard of fencing?  Making sure when your outside door opens, she can't run out?<br>  <br>  I'll tell you one thing, if she survives (unlikely by the sound of it) once she's been hit by a car, she'll be fearful of them.<br>  <br>  What's going on with your dog is down to you to sort out, and you need to start with where/how you are keeping her before she goes under the wheels of a car, and some poor driver has to live with killing your dog for the rest of his days.|`|5bYpbodUaa	You need to train her. Do not instill fear into her, that will cause other issues.  You never want to use fear to control an animal.  <br>  <br>  She still is a young pup and it's never too late to get her some training. Especially training to where she'll stay in the yard and not run off. <br>  <br>  Have you ever watched Cesar Millan the Dog Whisperer? He's AWESOME!  And he can train any dog with any issues. Even the most difficult dogs. He's just great. Here's his website: <br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.cesarmillaninc.com/dogwhisperer/" rel="nofollow">http://www.cesarmillaninc.com/dogwhisper...</a><br>  <br>  Cesar will also tell you not to scare your dog into being have. You just have to know how to handle the dog, and how to get her to know that you're the leader of the pack. Check his website out, watch one of his videos, and give him a buzz. He can really help you. For the safety of your dog, this is necessary.  :-)  <br>  <br>  In the meantime, make sure you keep your dog on a leash, and in the yard. You can get fined for your dog to run around without a leash.|`|KvUJZa1Paa	Well since putting her on a leash isn't answer how about when she goes out into yard you put her on a chain and then she cant escape. Either fix the fence that is there or put a new one up, if that cost to much them for under 20 bucks you can go get a chain and a thingy that screws down in to ground. simple as that.<br>  <br>  Ones of these day she will become afraid all on her own, because she will get hit by a car or truck and then she will be DEAD.|`|YUQgyPT3aa	Train your dog.  Boxers are very smart, fast learners.  If she's bolting and running, that means she's probably bored and in need of much more excercise than you are currently giving her. <br>  <br>  Teach her manners at the door, she does not go out until she is on a lead and you TAKE her out the door. <br>  <br>  You should really look into fencing in your yard.|`|AA11615514	I don't think you'd want to make her fearful of cars or anything else. A fearful animal isn't good. What I think you want to do instead is work on getting her to obey and to not run outside. Getting some obedience training from a professional dog trainer could help.|`|AA11101806	you will probably have to get an invisible fence.<br>  <br>  that way, when she tries going out of the yard, she will learn not to go that far.<br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  * you really need a physically fenced-in area for her.|`|teDI6RQ8aa	Try and figure out how she escapes, and make sure she can't do that.|`|3hBQz33Yaa	I feel for you i have a dog that does the same thing. I don't ever LET him out without a leash and i have a fenced in back yard but he would rather run around free. No more than i get the door open he is trying to escape i do my best to block him, i tell him no, but there are times he pushes me out of the way and gets by. Lately ive been  making sure he is confined when i open the door or ill let him out of the back door with the fence while i open the front door. Sometimes i even put him on a leash while i go to the door and when he tries to get out obviously he cant and i tell him no. Hopefully he might learn that way. I wish i had more advice but im having the same problem. Just wanted to let you know you weren't alone and its not as simple as just putting him on a leash or not letting him out like most have said.lol Good luck!|`|CYf0eWgyaa	Unfortunately I had to use a wireless dog fence for my dogs.  It was something that was a last resort simply because I don't believe in them, but not one of them has run off yet.|`|Iyl5N9EKaa	Riddle:Why did the dog chase the car? Answer: Because its a dog. Your dog can not get out on her own. Figure it out and stop it immediately. She must always be on a leash, it is the law. Tethers and extended leashes are great. Being that the dog, sorry puppy is 10 months old she and you will benefit from obedient school. Your dog must know the recall command in case she slips out. Making her scared of cars is not going to correct bad behaviour. What if she sees a squirrel or small animal? You will still have the same problem of her running into the street. Good Luck|`|m1lu7CFJaa	I don't think you can actually make her scared of cars - unfortunately that usually only happens once an accident has occurred - sometimes not even then.  I would suggest you either get an outdoor kennel/run so that she can run outside.  Or an invisible fence - they work wonders.  They recently came out with a new wireless invisible fence - no digging required.  Although some owners have had interference from buildings/electrical equipment/etc.  We have the petsafe wireless invisible fence - and it works GREAT - only interference was our ionic breeze.  Whenever the dog walked by he would get shocked - simple solution - stop using the ionic breeze.
fYupEegGaa	I think he is probably about to molt (Shed skin), I have hermit crabs and they molt too. When my hermit crabs are about to molt they don't move or barley move. If your crayfish start to smell then it is dead. If your crayfish molts then leave the sheded skin in the tank.|`|PlBHhU3Kaa	it may be in shock or waiting for a fish or food to swim by try to use a tong to feed it and dont move it you can hurt it|`|Vi8RDbhUaa	In Louisiana we call them "Craw" fish, and we eat them buggers. Lots of em'.  Sounds like he may be ready to shed. They get very lethargic when it's time to shed or molt.  It's really a very cool thing to watch. If he is Molting isolate him because his new shell will be very soft and other fish will find him tasty.  It takes a while for it to get hard again.|`|SuAlwdD4aa	It should be fine. I have several crayfish and lots of the time the remain perfectly still and wait for food to come by or get dropped in the tank. It may also be trying to hide, or as someone else said it may be getting ready to molt. How big is the tank and how big is the crayfish?|`|ugCaMO3saa	im not sure. but i think im sure theres something wrong with it.|`|HzjeKsDJaa	idk maybe he is about to molt
YUQgyPT3aa	Get a second opinion...|`|JsBb732Maa	I'm sorry about your dog being sick :-( On the blood test did they check for cancer? My dog lost a lot of weight and would barely eat and the test showed cancer of the liver and it had spread to other places and I had to put him down. I really hope that's not going on with your dog but with mine it was sudden and I had no clue that a sudden weight loss could mean the possibility of cancer.|`|GSf09ALBaa	A sudden stop in eating.  A loss of appetite and weight of 8 pounds.  Occasional vomiting.  Fever of 104.  And that is a fever which means she is fighting off something.  Urine test was done and bloodwork was done and your vet cannot find anything wrong.<br>  <br>  The bloodwork should have showed anything abnormal.  I would call your vet, ask for another set of bloodwork, get a fecal done also and don't leave until you have an idea what it is.  Also, ask to see the blood panel.  I always look at it on any of my dogs.<br>  <br>  This could be IBD, Liver, Heartworms, just about anything.  If you cannot get satisfaction from your vet, ask for all of your records and take you dog to another vet.|`|Iyl5N9EKaa	I would consider getting a second opinion. Blood and urine tests won't detect everything. An ultrasound would be a good idea. I would switch food as well, and be generous on the treats. Make sure she is capable of pooing and urinating. This will give you clear indication in regards to her system. The swifter remark is smart, make sure there isn't any hazards around causing the illness. Good Luck|`|QGuxbItCaa	Get more tests. I could be cancer.|`|3zm0jA0yaa	I'm no vet nor should you listen to anyone who is not, but I'd would say to get another opinion. If she or he can't find what is wrong with your dog and you love them as i'm sure you do, then take her to another vet, and get a second opinion. The first vet may have missed something and you could possibly lose your dog over it. Yes, I'd say go get another vet to look at her, preferably one with a better lab/ that can run better tests. Good Luck with your shepard. I love them too. And tell the second vet everything the first one said. A dog does not run a 104 temp. over nothing. something is wrong.|`|UX0Ys5bKaa	that's what happened to my dog if dogs do not eat or drink and they barf that means they r dehydrated, if the vet gives u this medicine<br>  to stick in its food and it still does not eat then stick it on ham or something or she does not like her  food , sorry to say it thats what happened to my dog 4 months later she died but thats because <br>   she wasn 12 years old <br>  <br>  <br>        HOPE UR DOG GETS WELL!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!...|`|m1lu7CFJaa	Our dogs went through an odd phase similar to yours.  I would try switching her food.  Our older dog after a while would just start throwing up his food - even though he had an appetite.  Our vet recommended switching foods (we switched from dog chow to dog chow indoor formula) and it fixed the problem.  Eventually though he started doing it with the indoor formula food - so we switched back to good ol' dog chow & he was fine again.|`|OkJp8W4naa	I must suggest that Allergies can be an issue if he is allergic to a protein in his food. You may want to try him on a different diet with a completely different meat protein to see if this changes things. I also suggest decreasing the food amount but feeding him more often.<br>  Check Out For More Details>>>><a href="http://www.agritura.com/index.php/cat/c380_Dog-Food.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.agritura.com/index.php/cat/c3...</a>|`|Rg9DnsBBaa	sometimes my dog dose not eat for days.do you go out with your dog if not people could be feeding her stuff that can make her sick.|`|hFNqA23Maa	try giving her new food it happened with my dog too...
