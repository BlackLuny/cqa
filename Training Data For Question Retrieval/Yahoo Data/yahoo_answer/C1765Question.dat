20090227103856AAHAa0w	News & Events;Current Events	When is Obama or someone else going to tell the truth about the "tax cuts"?	I dont think most of the public are aware of this. The so called tax cut, that we are getting starting in April are NOT what you think.    First off, its about 13 bux a week (dont spend it all in once place). Secondly, the extra 13 a week goes down to 9 a week next year. Now here is the REAL kicker. Tax rates are NOT decreasing! This is not a tax cut. In 2009 on your tax return, this 13 bux you get a week this year will show as income. Talk to your tax people if/when you do taxes this year. That is how I found out. Again tax rates are not going down. This isnt a tax cut, its a credit, which means YOU HAVE TO PAY IT BACK!   So when will Obama make this clear to the public? He certainly doesnt tell us this during his speeches. I know most of you are in Awe of him when he talks. But be careful, someone like him who can speak so well, can do so in such a way you never hear what he really means or intends. Look beyond his words. He is lying and leaving out things. So much for transparency

We shouldv'e never been there to begin with. Out concern shouldv'e been Afghanistan & that's it. It was Bin Laden & his cronies who where behind 9/11 Not Hussein & Iraq. It was a war of lies based on getting some revenge for Daddy Bush Sr & to make his buddies rich as a result of the fake war. It was also about Weapons that to this day where never found.  Thank you Obama for finally having a timetable to end this unjustified war.

(AP) A German shepherd named Astro who has been missing from his family for more than 9 years is finally home. The Geary family was shocked when they recently received a call from an animal control officer who said that Astro had been found.    The dog went missing from the Geary family's Port St.Lucie, Fla. home shortly after the family adopted him. Since then, they have moved three times and ended up in Louisville, Ky. On Jan.29, 2009, an animal control officer in Tennessee picked up Astro after receiving a report about a dog running loose. Officers tracked down the family through a microchip implanted in the canine.Dennis Geary says he wasn't sure if Astro would remember him. But when they were reunited, the dog sat down and began licking him.       http://in.news.yahoo.com/210/20090227/95...

First couple of weeks in January I was able to pull up infomation from past press briefings back in 2004. Now when I go to the website It doesn't allow me to look up past information. Only for the current year. Why would they do that? It's part of our history when bills are signed.

She wears a lot of make up, tons of it on her face, and it makes her look like she is hiding a beard. And that skanky blond stringy hair, or wig, what ever it is, looks like something dirty that's been hanging in a drag queens closet for 20 years. She even looks as though she would be a tall skinny man if she wasn't wearing all that make up and that old dirty wig. Look close at her...IS SHE REALLY A MAN??

The grieving relatives of a family of six who died in a crash on the M6 have said they can never forgive the man responsible for the deaths.....is there any wonder?      Paulo Jorge Nogueira da Silva was driving a 40 ton lorry, which due to his dangerous driving killed a WHOLE innocent family.      He will serve just 18 months in custody before he is released on licence. He was given just three years per person he killed, what kind of deterrent is this?       http://news.sky.com/skynews/Home/UK-News...

20090310003347AAR640h	News & Events;Media & Journalism	Do you consider yourself a forgiving or a condemning type?	Accuser, Exonerated Man Are Friends   AOL   posted: 6 HOURS 9 MINUTES AGO    LAW NEWS, NATIONAL NEWS   (March 9) - When Jennifer Thompson identified Ronald Cotton as her rapist in 1984, she was sure she had found the right man. But she was wrong.   Cotton, then 22, was convicted of raping Thompson and another woman on the same night in Burlington, N.C.    He would spend the next 11 years behind bars for a crime he didn't commit.      In 1995, DNA evidence cleared Cotton of the rapes and showed that another man who was in prison with him was the rapist, a case recently covered by CBS' '60 Minutes'.      Now, Thompson and Cotton are friends and have written a new book together on their story, called 'Picking Cotton.'   The two speak on the phone weekly and travel together to speak out on the problems with eyewitness evidence. Even their families are friends.   Thompson said she felt horrible guilt when she found out Cotton was not her rapist. "Suffocating, debilitating shame," she told Lesley Stahl in a CBS '60 Minutes' interview        http://news.aol.com/article/rape-victim-...       P.S.  I bet the cops and the media who helped place this innocent man behind bars haven't apologized for the role they played in the conviction of an innocent man.   Sad thing is, many people behind bars are innocent and when they are released the holier-than-thou crowd still condemns them .      To Err is Human   Forgiveness is Divine

First listen to the short JFK speech, which is not well known I assure you. He was killed because of it. But it is real, that is indisputable.       http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dxnpujfan...       Will Obama confront the truth about 911 or will this country continue to crumble?      A steel foundation building has NEVER fallen in history because of a fire, regardless of the size. And we are expected to believe it happened three times within a couple of hours?       BBC showed Tower 7 falling live 20 minutes before any US broadcasters. (Which shouldn't have fallen anyways. Again, I can site hundreds of historical comparisons. The government's explanation that the air pressure caused by the falling towers caused tower 7 to collapse in demolition fashion is simply absurd.)      etc etc      How can the administration expect the country to recover with this horrific lie being the reason for so many of the current problems?      No truth bashing please. If you have that inclination after doing 5 minutes of real unbiased research on the topic, then YOU are not telling the truth, and you know it.

20090310022636AAHi7sV	News & Events;Current Events	Amnesty on illegal immigrants?	The Government is 'pondering' an amnesty on illegal immigrant - allowing those in the country to stay as it'll cost ￡11,000 per immigrant and 34 years to deport them all.      The Government seems to ponder a lot doesn't it?      Anyway some of these immigrants work, either on the sly and not paying tax, or some actually have NI numbers and pay tax.      How about we let the working immigrants become legal, and contribute to this country, and deport the workshy British people?  There are people in this country who don't realise how lucky they are yet take advantage.  They refuse to clean, wait tables or work other low level jobs.  The fact that these workshy people didn't continue with training, education or work up the ladder and thus only qualify for lower level jobs seems to escape their notice.      And before the usual suspects start getting palpitations, I mean the workshy, not necessarily all unemployed people.  Yes some people are honestly unemployed and seeking work, and deserve the support to do so.  It is the deliberately workshy, or even worse those that fake disability or other syndromes to get out of work.      So how about deport the workshy to a country that will appreciate them (like Iraq or Aghanistan) and keep the working illegal immigrants?      I'll await the abuse with anticipation!      ;-)

Every radio stadtion is advertising this Show also Tv advertising and also Adds everywhere around victoria, take box hill for example.      There is just something not right. This show is on Tv early so that kids and students are exposed to nudity and sex. And most of them are watching it secretly to not let there parents know. All this is to do with advertising and money making.      I think underbelly is destroying the minds of kids and other people.      What do u think?
