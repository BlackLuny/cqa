20090203065441AAZJyRA	Pregnancy & Parenting;Pregnancy	Pregnant and need some advice right away...?	I'm about to give birth in a week and I really don't know what to do about a situation here.  To make a long story short, the father of my child (ex-bf) and I don't get along and he doesn't plan to be at the hospital when I give birth, at the same time I've been going out with another guy for a couple of months now and he seems to really care about me and willing to adopt my newborn.  The problem is whose last name should I put on the birth certificate?  My ex's last name or my current new bf's last name?

20090203070027AAtuqUv	Pregnancy & Parenting;Pregnancy	Bruising because of baby kicks?	I am 31 weeks pregnant with my second child and this one seems to be a lot more noticeable then my last. He takes up so much room in my tummy already that I always have something in my ribs or hip bones. He is constantly stretching and kicking like I imagine I would if i had that tiny amount of space to live in. But it feels like I have very tender spots on my belly and it is very achy and feels like it is going to explode.... has this ever happened to anyone else? Am I going to look like a pansy when I ask my doctor about it or should I be worried?
20090203070110AAPMIGQ	Pregnancy & Parenting;Pregnancy	To induce or not to induce....?	Ok, my fellow mommies. I need some advice. LOL      Yesterday, my doctor says I'm at 3 cm dilated and he's giving me the option to induce labor on Sunday, Feb. 8th (due date is actually the 12th). He's leaving it up to me to either induce or just wait until I go into labor on my own. And who knows... the baby could decide to come before Sunday anyway. But I don't really want to go past the 12th if I decide to wait it out.       I don't know what to do. If you've had labor induced.... what was your experience?

I have been pumping up until now and want my son to latch for a number of reasons, but mainly because I want him to self wean and I am sick of the artificial pump!    I am in contact with Dr. Jack Newman about this and he seems optimistic    I have two questions:   Has anyone heard of this working at this age?    How do I deal with my friends and family thinking I am "weird" for trying to latch him at this age?

20090203071725AA19rXD	Pregnancy & Parenting;Pregnancy	Urgent help - What on earth is going on w/ my body?  For 10pts?	I'm 5 1/2 weeks pregnant.  Had one miscarriage 11 months ago.      I've had very mild spotting (only seems to appear on the toilet paper in the mornings - this is the 2nd morning)   Last night i was awoken by a burst-like strong popping sensation on my left side - it hurt so much i woke up immediately to throw up, but i didn't.    I thought surely this ectopic, but had no pain after that, no bleeding no shoulder pain - fell asleep like a log..      However, as soon as i got that sharp pain (almost like a poke w/ a knife) i had the same feeling in the center of my lower ab and on the right side of my lower ab...just not as sharp - it was mild, but i know it was there.      The spotting i'm having is extremely small, but it is accompanied by mucous.       I've called the doctor, couldn't speak to them cuz it's too early in the morning, so i had to talk to an after-hours nurse, and she wasn't any help.        W/ my miscarriage last time, i had no cramping or pain, but did have more blood w/ mucous that time and that was at 6 weeks- i was feeling great otherwise.      I need to call my doctor, but just for assurances sake has anyone had what i'm going through and had a perfectly healthy baby?      With the "cramping" i'm also experiencing leg cramps and sometimes    sciatica on my right leg.      I'm going mad here! HELP PLEASE.

I noticed this morning that my son has been grinding his teeth(he only has 3...2 bottom and 1 top that isn't all the way out yet)   He hasn't done it a lot, and I'm sure he is just getting used to having teeth.     My question is, when does it become a problem?  And how do you stop a baby or toddler from grinding...or do you even bother?  It doesn't bother me, but I don't want him to do any damage or anything.  And since he is going to lose these teeth anyway, can he still do damage somehow?

20090203072558AAVP2UP	Pregnancy & Parenting;Other - Pregnancy & Parenting	Anyone with 2 years and 3 months between their kids? (spacing)?	If you have a just-over-2 years gap between your kids - what is that like? Do you wish you had waited longer? Or maybe wish it was even smaller?   Dh and I are about to go for number 2 and I know I don't want a big gap between kids and yet I am so nervous! Am I ready? Will I be able to give half of my attention to someone else other than DD? I feel so guilty thinking I would take attention away from her. But I know I was 3 when my sibling was born and it was such a blow to me, so I've thought if DD is closer in age to number 2, it wouldn't be as hard for her. I am hoping all my feelings are normal for someone going for number 2 and it is not that I'm not ready!
20090203072641AA09L2D	Pregnancy & Parenting;Newborn & Baby	How do I kwow if I have an oversupply of milk and if this is a problem?	I read a question about pumping and some answers said that if you get 4oz or more in one pumping session it could be an oversupply problem.  I have pumped a few times when my son was sick and not eating as often so that I didn't risk losing my supply and when ever I did I would get 4oz from each side and I only had to pump for 10 minutes total (5 on each side.)  I do think I have a really fast let down because my son only eats for like 5-8 minutes each time he eats.  But one thing that is making me wonder if this could be a problem is that I hear my son gulping really loud and fast when he eats.  Sometimes when he unlatches on accident milk sprays all over the place and continues to until I get it back into his mouth.  Recently he has been unlatching and relatching a lot after the first few minutes of eating and I think it may be that the milk flow slows down and he is getting too used to it being really fast.  Is this just a fast let down or an over supply.  Do either of these pose a problem for me or my son?  He eats every 2-4 hours and he is three months old.

Beside I thought you couldn't spoil a baby.       Does anyone else get tired of people telling you this. All I am doing is comforting my baby. Is that such a bad thing.

20090220160549AAlhStX	Pregnancy & Parenting;Parenting	Strip searching kids at school?	I have seen more and more of this and i find it sick, the law gives the schools the right to strip search children, elementary school, middle school, and high school. One middle school girl was made to get completely naked and comb through her pubic hair because another student accused her of selling drugs in school when it was the other student who was doing this. and another when teachers were making every child strip search because they were looking for $40 that was stolen from another student. Do you think this is right? should a school be able to do that to the kids, and they dont even need parents consent either. What would you do if your child was strip searched at school without your knowledge. They were threatening kids with suspension if they did not do it.       something like this just happened in my town, and i cant believe that it is legal          http://www.starttherevolution.org/archiv...

I was visiting my husband at work today for coffee and while we were there, one of his co-workers came in and chatted.  Since I had our son with me, she was asking all sorts of questions, and when she asked if he crawled yet I said no.  She said that he might just go straight to walking, which I sort of think as well...but who knows.     Anyway, case in point, she said that her husband took child psychology and said that when babies don't crawl it means that part of their brain didn't develop properly.  I haven't searched for anything about this online because I'm not really concerned ...yet.(in 2 more months I might be though)   Do you think this is true?

20090220162810AAc2kRT	Pregnancy & Parenting;Pregnancy	Can anyone tell me how far along u think i am please help?	i went to the dr yesterday. it was my pcp doctor not an ob. i go to my ob on the 26th. anyways she said that i was 9.4 weeks BUT on jan 28th i had an ultrasound and it said i was 8.2 weeks. How can i only be 9.4 weeks. there was a good heartbeat and she said everything was fine. i didnt realize what she had said until after i got home and didnt call to clarify. the doctor i seen wasnt my unual doctor so maybe she was just read something wrong. my last period was december 3rd and my due date they gave me was 9-9-09. i go to my ob for my first viisit thursday so i will talk to him then and im not overly concerned because there was a good heartbeat. how far along should i be, and should i call the doctor back to clarify? she said since everything was going well and she didnt antisipate any problems that she didnt need to c me for another month, my next apponitment with her is 3-18.

20090220164616AA05yug	Pregnancy & Parenting;Pregnancy	Does this sound absolutely ridiculous?	My sister-in-law delivered our babies at the same small rural hospital.  They are about 5 months apart, and we were discussing our experiences last night.  She told me that the first night the nurse looked after her little one in the nursery.  The next morning she brought her back to the room and told my SIL that the baby had been pretty upset the entire night and was very difficult to soothe.  Then the nurse asked my SIL's husband to step into the hall with her.  She told him that she thought the little one was going through withdraws and asked if she had smoked cigarettes during the pregnancy.  She had smoked before the pregnancy, but started quiting when she found out.  She was completely quit by 12 weeks.  He told the nurse that and she said that if my SIL had smoked during the first weeks of her pregnancy then the baby was most definitely going through withdraws now that she was born.  Does that even make sense???  If she hadn't smoked in 28 weeks, then how could the baby possibly be going through withdraws???  Do babies even have withdraws from cigarette smoke????  I just found it pretty ridiculous sounding, and wanted to know if anyone else agreed.

20090220164452AAmi9qS	Pregnancy & Parenting;Pregnancy	Pregnancy question about due date?	So I just found out I was pregnant. I went to the doc and was asked when I had my last period. My last period started on Dec. 26th 2008, however I know I conceived on or after Jan 13th because that is when I had sex. They calculated my due date by my last period though. Is this right? There is no way I can be 7 or 8 weeks preggers if I had sex 5.5 weeks ago right? This confuses me.

I went back to my doctor, asked for the referal because they asked me to book an app for 3wks with my doc, well, he says we should wait till 16wks and i tried to explain to him that we need to go back because i was only 9wks for this scan it was too early to detect anything at that time and they needed to wait till the proper dating scan, he still wouldnt budge so what should i do? i have read about at 12wks they check for down syndrome and spina bifida (spelling) and can detect abnormalities etc.. i told the doc this aswell, what should i do?      should i find another doctor whose willing to give the scan or what?

When did you feel your baby move into position and were you able to feel it? How different it is than just regular movements?      My mom said my brother and I both turned last minute but she didn't say what it felt like and for some stupid reason I didn't ask her.      Thanks.
20090220164614AAVTO4I	Pregnancy & Parenting;Newborn & Baby	I really dislike my dog that  I own, it's been terrible?	I have a 4 month old and we live in 2 bedroom town home. Place is pretty small. We had to move to town home because we got this huge dog- Black Russian Terrier...    http://www.mistylakespetresort.com/image...       See link above , if you don't know this breed. After I had my baby I started to hate him. He is the sweetest, smartest dog that exists. But he has so much hair, I have to wash floors all the time, his hair on baby clothes, in the laundry. 1st year was total mess because he would have very weak stomach, so if he would eat somthing wrong he would throw up all over the house or have diarhia... so I was the one who end up cleaning it all the time... I am so sick of it!      Now, I come home every day and he destroys something, 1st he was destroying my baby's toys, and now he destroyed that thing in the play yard where u hand baby's toys... what the heck, seriously?         My husband is in love with him, but I hate him... How do you live with our pets? Any problems?      Can any one suggest something?

20090220162520AAieOp1	Pregnancy & Parenting;Parenting	Should I fire my babysitter?	I normally get a 15 year old girl who lives down the street to babysit my kids. She normally does a good job for babysitting all 4 little girls (ages 8, 5, 3 and 1).       Well, I left her in charge of the kids last Saturday and she didn't do to well. When my husband and I got home from the get together we were going to, it was well around 12:00 AM. None of the kids were in bed, and my 1 year old daughter was asleep on the floor. When I asked where my 3 year old was, she said she was in the bathroom. I asked her how long, and she scratched her head, and mumbled an hour or so. So when I went to check on her, there was puke everywhere and my poor baby was sick! I thought she knew to call us when she got sick... My 8 and 5 year old were both drinking pop, and a big rule in the house is no caffeine after dinner.      So watching 4 kids can be stressful. But after I paid the sitter I regretted even hiring her. I got a nice surprise, she had gone through my bathroom and used my straightening iron. And she failed to even check on my 3 year old when she was sick. She didn't put any of my kids in bed and didn't do a good job. She just watched tv and let them do whatever.      Should I fire her? I would just stop asking her to do the job and find a more responsible babysitter. My husband and I don't go out too much, so it wouldn't be a huge deal or anything.

Member since: 07 de Fevereiro de 2007    Total points: 2,245 (Level 3)    Points earned this week:      --% Best answer    First off I am 34 and started my period at age 9. I have always had heavy painful periods, and was put on the pill at 14, before I was even active to control bleeding. I got off the pill in my early 20's to have kids. I have had two wonderful girls, but since my last (she is now 6) my periods have been horrid. I had a D&C 3 yrs ago because I bled for 4 months straight and it helped, but they are stil lheavy and are now cyling back to being longer and longer. I do not want to take hormones to control them because my mom died at the age of 46 from agressive breast cancer. My husband is fixed and we do not want more kids, the doctor said I should get a hysterectomy and leave my ovaries, and am thinking I want to.   My questions, did you feel better?? Did it help with your problems?? Or cause more?? Also how much down time will I need after, I have a 6 and 8 yr old.

( not using condoms until towards the end) he  had to pull away fast. a little came out but he said it wasnt inside me. but there was also plenty of pre-*** present. i know people will probably respond saying that we shouldnt do that, but i like to let things happen. like if im meant to have a baby then i will. my question is what are the chances that i could be expecting?

20081210074318AAFyeJz	Pregnancy & Parenting;Pregnancy	Could this be morning sickness?	Hi, so my hubby and I have been TTC for a few months now, but we've had issues because I was on birth control for a couple years and as soon as I got off them, my periods stopped! I also had irregular periods so this was not out of the ordinary. I went to the doctor and they said I was not pregnant but just to wait and see what happens within the next few months. Anyway, I've been off the pill now for a few months and we've been TTC but have not had any luck. Well this morning around 4 AM I woke up and was REALLY sick to my stomach! I threw up twice between 4 and 6 AM. When I woke up this morning I was a little tired and a tiny bit nauseous still, but I'm okay now. Obviously I know you cant tell me wither or not this was morning sickness, but has anyone maybe gone through the same thing? Does it sound like it could be morning sickness, or is it all in my head? I don't have any other symptoms, and I didn't eat anything the night before that would make me sick. Any thoughts or stories you could share to help me out a little? Thanks!

If someone babysits him, I have to tell them that if he asks for "Jelly", what he really wants is peanut butter.      My hubby tried to show him the difference between peanut butter and jelly, but he started crying!      He just refuses to even TRY to say Peanut butter.      We say "Say Peanut Butter"      He says "Jelly"      DOH!

20090220104127AAnUT9c	Pregnancy & Parenting;Pregnancy	17 weeks, 4 days pregnant and I don't really feel pregnant...?	I can't stop worrying about my baby.. I heard the heart beat at 15 weeks... I had an ultrasound at 16 weeks weeks and my next appointment isn't until March 3rd. I haven't had any morning sickness at all, or any head aches, so I can say that I didn't REALLY feel pregnant before, either. But for a while, it was hurting when I had sex with my boyfriend and I thought that was due to being pregnant.. Well, we had sex the day before yesterday and it didn't hurt at all... And usually when I would go up the stairs I would be out of breathe and today I feel totally fine just running up and down the stairs. The only real symptoms I've had is sore breast, having to pee more often, darker nipples and really dry skin... All that stuff is still like that.       Am I worrying for nothing? It's so hard for me not to worry because I haven't felt any noticeable movement, yet. And I just feel completely fine.

We're terrified to tell her parents since they're hardcore Catholics. We were going to do abortion but she messed around to much and never called them... Weeks went by and the total price went up to $1595, we had the money but she still never called. I'm to scared of the possibility ofsomethingg going wrong since she's so far along. Wefinallyy decided to just tell her parents and hope for the best. We have no idea how to break the news the them, especially since she is 5 months pregnant. I told her I rather not see her again till she's 18 then risk having her risk getting hurt in an abortion, shefinallyy agreed but now were stuck in the disposition of how to tell her parents. I highly doubt saying "Mom I'm 5r months pregnant, we were going to get an abortion andthat'ss why it took me this long to tell you" will work... Her parents are big into their religion and we're terrified confused and at wits end. The worst part is I have a baby coming on Feb 25 and I'll be gone for a week or so. (Thebaby'ss momma lives over an hour away). I got information on adoption but now Nicole is saying that she doesn't know if she would be capable of carrying the baby for 9 months and then just give it up. I'm desperate for help!!! Please if you can help I'd greatly appreciate it!!

He runs, jumps, he isn't clumsy on his feet, he can stand flat on feet, but he toe walks alot.  When he was two years old I brought up to his doctor's attention and she said not worry about and he'll grow out of it.  I told her again yesterday and finally she reffered to me to a feet specialist.  She said "its tight" what ever that meant??  His doctor couldn't really give me a good answer and said the foot specialist will help.  Should I be concerned? To my knoweledge he dosent have any developmental delays...he pretty smart for his age, but he is super hyper.  I am thinking he super hyper because he's been on asthma medication since he was a baby, but he outgrowing the asthma.. thank God      O yeah I read somewhere it could be Cerebal Palsy?  What exactly is CP?  I though CP is diagnosed at an early age??      Thank you in advance,      Concerned mom

I stopped taking the pill around 5 days ago, and had unprotected sex with my fiance in the hope of falling pregnant. I was diagnosed with PCOS around a year ago and all the other attempts of getting off the pill have resulted in no periods which meant i wasn't ovulating. I got my period around 20 minutes ago, which is good, it means i'm finally able to have my period without help of a contraception. My question is how long does it take for the egg to be fertilized and can i get my period in between? My mum said she had her period (or spotting) for 5 months of being pregnant with my sister and i, and she didn't realise she was pregnant until her periods stopped, she said they felt like regular periods, cramps and all.

I'm also 5 months pregnant and just started leaking that colestrum stuff which is normal for me, 5 months pregnant with my first is when I started leaking it too. My question is, normally when your breastfeeding and the baby is hungry or irritable the milk starts to come out, would the colestrum start to come out if my son was hungry or cranky? Because I noticed that everytime he's irritable or even at lunchtime the colestrum would come out more. Is that a hormone thing? It's hard to explain just wondering if this has happened to anyone else or this is just normal for my 2nd pregnancy?

We were set up through the adoption agency we used to adopt my 11 month old son. She is 7 months pregnant. When her parents found out she was pregnant, they wanted to send her away somewhere, like to a maternity home. The adoption agency talked the parents into letting her stay with us because were not to far away and she can be taken care of and loved.       She is considering parenting her baby but her parents have decided she can't come home unless she puts the baby up for adoption. We are not adopting the baby. When she came to stay with us I was very open minded about her being the parent. I believe it's best for a child to stay with the bio family if they have the resources, time, and love to care for the child. However, I've noticed that she is a typical 16 yo. She shows no interest in my son. She has asked me no parenting questions. She doesn't pay attention to any of my routines with my son etc... She loves to just watch tv.

20090220104613AA7JKie	Pregnancy & Parenting;Newborn & Baby	My exclusively Breastfed 5 month old Won't nurse!?	My DS will be 5 months old next tuesday. Recently, talking in the last week he won't nurse longer than 2-3 minutes at a time. Occasionally I can get him to nurse for about 10 minutes but that's it. He is 18lbs 1oz the last time he was weighed and that was just wednesday. Also he isn't sleeping at night and I am convinced it's because he is hungry but yet he still won't nurse. Could this be due to teething?? I mean what's going on?? I have took him to the DR like 3 times this week and nothing seems to be wrong! Any opinions.

20090203074504AA6K1i6	Pregnancy & Parenting;Parenting	Hey Mommies..have you ever accidentaly shoplifted ?	I have a 3 and a half year old daughter and this morning, we went to do groceries and it is freezing here, it's -30 degrees. So I took a basket and I took her jacket, hat, scarf and mitts off and put them in the basket and we filled our basket with food and than we went to pay and before we left, I got my daughter dressed up again and when we got to the car, I put her in and when I moved my purse and my gloves, I found these nuts that I had put in the basket that I forgot to pay for. Am I the only one this happens to ? And it's not the first time, at Walmart also it happened. my daughter wanted a chocolate bar so I opened it for her and forgot to pay for it and just little things, like she may be holding a stuffed animal she wants and I just forget to pay for it. I hate that I forget like that but am I the only one ?
20090220134025AAkNbGg	Pregnancy & Parenting;Pregnancy	Can someone help me understand this?	At my appointment last week they did an internal exam.  I got my entire prenatal record today at the doctor...they never told me anything about the internal exam (it's a group practice, it sucks and I hate it, but I don't have a choice).      I was reading the notes they had on it and it said: soft, 1cm, 2cm long.      I'm thinking that the soft part refers to my cervix being soft.  I'm also guessing that I'm 1cm dilated...but what does 2cm long mean?        Thanks for any guesses you may have on what this all means!  I'm just curious!

20090220164827AAtoqJv	Pregnancy & Parenting;Baby Names	Which name do you prefer:  Elfrida or Lydia?	Elfrida is an Anglo-Saxon name that means "elf strength". It was revived in the 19th century but is still uncommon.      Lydia is a Greek name that just means "from Lydia (in modern day Turkey)". In the New Testament, Lydia was a woman converted by St Paul. It has been used since the 17th century when Protestants began using previously little-known Biblical names. Lydia hasn't left the top 300 since 1880.

20090220165135AA8tLSR	Pregnancy & Parenting;Adolescent	???????  ???  ???????	These are just random questions [I didn't write the survey].  I love answering surveys, hopefully you do too.  And hopefully some might make you think a little.       Would you shave your head if a family member asked you to because they had cancer?      What would you do if the doctor told you that you were pregnant?      Did the one person who hurt you the most in your life apologize?      Are you good at hiding your feelings?      Are you wasting your time on someone?      Last thing that made you cry:      Do you have a bad temper?      Do you think you'll be married in 10 years?      How many funerals have you been to in your lifetime?      How often do you think about suicide?      What is your deepest fear?      Do you REALLY love all your family?      What do you want to believe in?      Do you have a secret crush on someone?      Are you proud of who you are?      Do you feel alone even in crowded rooms?      What is the worst thing a person could do to you and still be forgiven?      You're dying in 10 seconds, what are your last words to your best friend?      ...to your worst enemy?      Do you care if people hate you?      Freedom or safety?      Think of a random person, and give them a message here, no names:      Has a song ever made you cry?      A book ever made you cry?      Is the world crumbling to pieces?      Name on moment where you couldn't control your rage:      Name one moment where you sincerely wanted to just die:      For the last one, just say anything you want, anything at all:         Answer as best you can, I know some are weird!

20090220164231AA1TAsq	Pregnancy & Parenting;Trying to Conceive	Many answers please...10 points to best answers!!!!?	My lmp was on August 28th. I was on the pill, so it lasted a normal 4 days then I started the new pack on that Sunday. Well on the 3rd day of taking thwm I started bleeding super super heavy. No pain or anything. Just a ton of blood. And this lasted 4 days. Non stop heavy bleeding. Well after the first day of heavy bleeding I stopped taking my pill cause I thought it was my body just doing its thing. I never went to the doctor, cause I was in no pain. Well it stopped on September 6th. I had unprotected sex on September 7th..then not again till September 13th, and then like evryday from the 17th till the 22nd. (my bf and I just moved back in with each other) And well my next period would have been on September 25th. It never came, so I took a pregnancy test...got a negative. So I waited until October 5th. Took another one and it was negative. So then on October 7th I took one in the morning and at night. Still a negative. Then I waited and took one 9th and it was a fait positive..took one agin 3 hours later and it was a bit darker. So I knew I was preg. Went to the doctor and theres came out positive too.       Well. based on my lmp my due date is June 4th which is what the clinic gave me.   Well I went and had an ultrasound done and they told me there wasnt anything there and though it was an etopic preg. They tested my hgc and it was going up..so I went to another hosiptal and had an ultrasound done where I was super early and it put my due date at June 15th. Well I went to another hosiptal who dated my due date at June 16th. Well I had about 6 ultrasounds from 2 different doctors before my 12 week mark, and they all dated me at June 15th as my due date. And now at 23 weeks she is dating June 15th still. So based on ultrasounds she right on..but its some what off from my lmp. Based on my due date of ultrasound I got pregnant at around the time my next period was due to come. But based off my lmp I got preg a day after that crazy bleeding. Im confuced and need some advice. Its been on my mind.

20090203075057AANYJT9	Pregnancy & Parenting;Adolescent	Why Would My EX Disagree With My Decision RE: Our 11 Year Old Son's Education?	I want to send our 11 year old son to a school that has no sports program.  If his grades are good, he can play club sports.        He is smart but would rather draw football plays, daydream about jump shots and winning the Olympics than anything.      Next year, he will enter Jr, High and I FEEL he needs to focus on education and when he gets to High School, he will be able to play sports there.        My ex says send him to a school that has sports and ground him if his grades are not up to par.
20090220132529AAFS8cz	Pregnancy & Parenting;Pregnancy	Babys gender issues....will it matter what the baby is to us in the end?	I guess I just can't see myself with a daughter.      I mean I guess I just always thought I would have a boy if I had a kid. You know.      Even when I was younger and I played with dolls my baby doll was a boy most of the time (it was just a little bald headed doll with a white outfit)      I really want a boy. And I shouldn't want a boy over a girl. I should want either.      I've always been real good with boys...but not at all with girls. It seems I can get more on a boys level then girls.....      I don't really like girly activites like dressing up, makeup.      I'd prefer to be outside with the dogs, 4 wheeling, riding horses.      I'd rather play cowboys and indians than barbies (or whatever dolls are popular now)      We even have a nice boy name picked out (Sawyer Lee)       But I can't even think of good girl names (we are still just TTC but we have talked about names)      But my question is if I don't have a boy will I be upset? Or will all be forgotton when I hold my daughter?         Thanks      I guess because we are TTC its become more of a reality and I know I may not have a boy like I always thought I would      (I have 3 sisters and a brother....2 sisters and my brother and I share teh same father....but my other sister and I just share a mom.....so I've been around a lot of girls....my youngest sister is 9.       My husbands mom was pregnant two other times....I'm afraid one time she had and abortion and the other time she was into all kinds of junk and the baby boy was still born......My husband has always figured we have a good chance at a boy....since his dad had two sons and his dad was a family of mostly boys)        I know that irrelevent but my husband actually wants a little girl

So I know a lot of people say "oh teens are going to have sex" blah blah "so why don't we just give them condoms" I mean. Why don't you just talk to them about sex and abstinence ( not schools im talking about at home). Don't ignore the whole conversation and say "ok here's a condom be safe" EXPLAIN         This just annoys me because I'm 17 and I plan on saving myself until marriage. It's old fashioned I don't care. It's like I hear so many stories about people getting pregnant from a broken condom and STI even though they used protection. I know the teenage mind is very sexual but I am a good example that self control can make all the different. My moms rule is if you live in my house you are going to make me a grandmother in it.

Friday night I drank, smoked pot, and had sex for the first time and of course the condom broke, and I'm not on birth control. I was freaked out but my boyfriend said he didn't even climax. I was on ecstasy during that time. Saturday I took 3 "30" adderall pills and didn't sleep the whole night. This whole week I've been eating non-stop, I've been nauseous every day, I've been extremely tired, and I get sick from smoking a cigarette. I took a pregnancy test but it was too soon to do so. It's been exactly a week and I still can't shake the sickness. My friends laugh when they hear me say I think I'm pregnant, and that it's too early for signs. I'm not proud of what I did and I'm never doing it again. I don't know if it's because I had sex, or the drugs I did, or even sharing everything with people. To top it all off I just got a cold.

When I was 20 weeks, my ultrasound showed there could be an obstruction to the baby's kidneys. Since then I've had 2 more ultrasounds, and both have come back that there could be something going on. Both my family doctor and my OB have said it's probably nothing to worry about. However, my OB is sending me to a specialist next week for a 3D ultrasound to get a "closer look". Should I be worried? I've heard this type of thing happens a lot. I'm 26 weeks pregnant, and I've been feeling a lot of fetal movement.

20090203074756AA3F97Y	Pregnancy & Parenting;Trying to Conceive	14 babies?  How did she get there without help from inept doctors?	When my husband and I decided we wanted to have a baby.  It was very difficult.  We both went through extensive test.  Both body and mind.  I had to be healthy to carry, which is suppose to be for any woman carrying a life inside her.  I had to see a therapist to deal with any arising situation if I decide to go through any treatment.  Maybe its not part of their guidelines, but I was even asked about my finance, if I plan to stay at home.  To this day (we are not lucky yet) I am glad my doctors asked.  It put things into perspective.     My question is for the doctors.  If she was “checked”, they would have seen that her body already went through many pregnancy.  If she was seen by a therapist they would have seen that something does not add up.  We've put this woman through a microscope, why not the fertility doctor?   After spending time reading about this woman, someone claims that she paid for the treatment from a large settlement that she received.  So, the doctors did not give two pennies if the woman was unstable, as long as she was able to pay for the cost, its all right.  You had to spend a good amount of time with her while treating her.  And not once she did not mention her “other kidssss”.  Does that seem normal to you?

20090203075825AA9EzSc	Pregnancy & Parenting;Toddler & Preschooler	How long do you wait for your 2 yr old to calm down?	My 2 yr old son does what most toddlers do when they cant say the word, he whines. And it drives me freaking NUTS! Because its this high pitched whine/scream.     Last night he wanted something in the kitchen and he whined his whole way through. Our biggest challenge right now is getting our son to actually SAY what he wants. Hes perfectly capable but its obviously easier for him to whine and usually Daddy gives him what he wants, so he knows whining works well. I, on the other hand, dont typically give in and I will wait until our son calms down, quiets down, or tries to say the word. But sometimes hell get very loud, very whiny, and hell scream and cry because hes not getting what he wants instantly. (Yes, I know, normal toddler)    Im well aware that my husband and I need to be on the same page but actually making that happen, I feel like Im walking to wall. My husband always thinks that he knows what our son needs so he just does. Now another thing that worries me is that my stepdaughter has speaking issues because her mother and father ignored a lot of the signs. I do defend my husband that he has tried, hes made phone calls, hes paid for therapy, but her mother dropped the ball and has other priorities. And now my 5 yr old stepdaughter struggles big time. She gets made fun of at daycare, she struggles with speaking so her confidence is low, and shes having a hard time adapting to daycare with the big kids. Shes not my child so I can only say my piece but in the end, shes not my child and I can do nothing to help her. But our son, he IS my child and I will not repeat that same mistake nor will I allow it to happen. So I DO feel its important.     Now how long do you let your 2 yr old freak out and throw their little fit before you can speak to them? Do you just let them be and throw their tantrum regardless of how long its been? Every time I try and wait for our son to be calm, when I go to speak to him about what it is he wants, or what behavior he did was wrong, whatever the case is, he starts back up with whining when I start speaking. I know consistency is key here, so do I just keep on? Continue to put him in timeout to calm himself? (He cant go in his room because he has toys all over and thats not exactly MY idea of time out even though Im sure for him its great)    I guess Im just wondering how many times is too many? I know with a 2 yr old, their attention span is a short one anyways. So at what point do I give up or try another way? I just feel like its useless sometimes.

Its way up high (but below my breasts). I dont see how it would be the baby as its around my belly button. Could this be acid reflux or Something else attributed to pregnancy? it just started hurting this morning, And I dont want to go to the doctor for every ache and pain. Or else id be there every day for something I know is normal. I was just wondering have you had this? Or what it might be? I know only the doctor will know. Could this be from my stomach starting to stretch? Or something else. I did have diarrhea twice yesterday which Was really weird for me.... (sorry tmi) now i have this pain. Im just wondering if its from diet something ive eaten Or if its just a normal pregnancy pain?   (18 wks 3days pergnant #1) I had pains like these before being pregnant and was tested, ultra sound on my ribs, and stuff and They never said anything to me either way! And havent had it since as i said...? So is this just something from pregnancy? Or something else, and maybe they didnt want to do further testing (as thats when I first found out i was pregnant I had pains in my ovaries and in ribs).

20090203080048AAWPMok	Pregnancy & Parenting;Adolescent	Why do people put so much importance in marriage before having a baby?	PLEASE READ THE WHOLE Q FIRST!      I know that's the way things used to be done, dating, marriage, baby, but now i don't think it makes any difference, whats important is that the parents love each other and are a stable happy family, a marriage certificate doesn't make this happen (in fact it seems to have the opposite affect if you check out divorce stats) anyone can get married, it doesn't prove anything, it doesn't make you more ready for a baby, it doesn't make you stronger, it doesn't mean you love each other more, think you have to be stable and in love when you decide to get married so you are in already married at heart before the piece of paper. and if one of the couple wants to leave they will married or not, they dont think "oh wait cant leave im married!" they just file for divorce.    eg. which to you is a more stable relaltionship, a couple together 10years, unmarried, share house, bank account, are clearly in love and have a beautiful happy/healthy baby.   or    a couple together 10 years, married, share house, bank account, are clearly in love and have a beautiful happy/healthy baby.      to me there is no difference? the unmarried couple just felt either no need to get married because their relationship doesnt need proof (as marriage seems to be used as nowadays) or they dont believe in marriage because divorce is an option that so many people take so there really is no value to having that certificate anyway anymore      (i havent had any bad experiences in love (thankfully) ive had one great boyfriend since i was 14 (he was 16) and we are engaged, getting married after graduation, i just dont think it matters when people have children (no we dont have any we are still to young really, 21 & 23) i just think its unfair how people just seem to just dismiss unmarried couples as unserious or unstable to have a child. i think marriage is great but its not what defines a relationship at all!)

20090203080944AApJ1hN	Pregnancy & Parenting;Newborn & Baby	Room decorating help...?	My husband and I are expecting a little boy in April.  We would like to have a basketball themed room.  I've looked everywhere to find just basketball, but all of the bedding sets that I see are all sports mixed.  Any ideas on where I can find just basketball?
20090203081127AAkC0SN	Pregnancy & Parenting;Newborn & Baby	Important......opinions needed?	My son is 8 months old and in december his pediatrician suspected that he had Scaphocephaly. She sent up to go get x-rays of his skull. 2 days later she called us and comfirmed that my son indeed had Scaphocephaly and would need surgery.      Scaphocephaly is a type of craniosynostosis which means the fontanelle, or soft spot at the top of the head, is absent or closed. A ridge can be seen, or felt running along the top of the head. The skull looks very long when viewed from the side and when viewed from above, the skull is wider near the forehead and gets narrower towards the back. When looking straight on at the infant's face, the forehead seems quite prominent, and the sides of the skull look narrow.      We ended up taking him to a nuerologist at Children's Hospital in D.C. and he said my son didn't have Scaphocephaly that he had Trigonocephaly which is a different type of craniosynostosis and would need surgery right away and to come back that friday (This was on a tuesday) to see the surgeon because this needed to happen right away. He came up with this diagnosis looking at the same exact x-rays that my sons pediatrician looked at. Fine and good he is a specialist so i believed him.      In metopic suture craniosynostosis, or trigonocephaly, the forehead will have a triangular shape and the eyes may appear closer together. The deformity can vary from mild to severe. There is usually a prominent mid-frontal ridge (pointed forehead) down the forehead that can be seen or felt and the eyebrows may appear "pinched" on either side. The eyes are usually spaced closer to each other than normal, causing a definite recognizable deformity of the forehead and eyes. When viewed from above the forehead has a triangular shape.      We went back on friday to see the surgeon and looking at the same exact x-rays that the ped and nuerologist looked at, stated my son had neither one and would not need surgery. The surgeon also works at Children's.      We talked to the neurologist that same day right after seeing the surgeon and he said he didn't agree with the surgeon and to get a 3-d CT of the skull and brain.      I don't know what to do because I have 3 different doc saying 3 different things and 2 of which says he needs surgery. Both types of craniosynostosis causes pressure on the brain because the skull can't grow properly and the brain keeps growing and they both require surgery to correct it. If a child doesn't get the surgery it can cause seizures, mental retardation, or even death. I don't know what to do. I'm scared for my child. Children's is supposed to be the best and if i can't trust them then what? Please I need help.
