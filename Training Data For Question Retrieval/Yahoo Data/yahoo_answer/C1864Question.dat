Then all of a sudden, my internet explorer just pooped out...whenever i run it, it does not load any site at all. I have cable and i know it is working, so something must be wrong with internet explorer. So i downloaded mozilla firefox so i could surf the internet. It works fine surfing the internet, but when it gets to videos they do not work at all. It says its missing a plugin but i clicked install plugin and it said it couldnt find the plugin it was looking for. Whenver i try to view a video no player shows up at all. Is there a way to uninstall internet explorer and windows media player and reinstall them? This is making me really mad that i can't view videos.

20070307205847AACwusk	Computers & Internet;Internet	I need Website help?	I'm am for looking for a site to sell my music as mp3 downloads where a viewer doesn't have to become a member of the site. I recently joined Broadjam, Soundclick, Mp3.com, Artistopia.com, SonicBids, and GarageBand.   All the sites require the listener to register and then start an account by depositing so much money in it.   This in turn makes it extremely difficult for me to make any possible sales. It takes the numbers from any hundreds to fractions of a percent. It would be better for the artists and the sites if they had another route for listeners as well to straight bill instead of having to go through all the hassle. Basically there may be a million members on any such site and that is my only market there.  What I would like is a site where they can be billed straight to credit card or paypal from the site without any signups or memberships or deposits. This would enable me to market the planet. Do you know of any such sites?

However, I decided to take my game up a level and installed CS3 on my Macbook. It looks like a really nice program but I'm having a really hard time adjusting to it. I can't even manage basic things like resizing layers. So I was wondering if anyone out there has some good advice on how to pick Photoshop up quickly. Any tips at all would be greatly appreciated.
20090227054257AAf6m2N	Computers & Internet;Hardware;Laptops & Notebooks	Toshiba Laptop Crash Problem?	I bought this laptop nearly 2 years ago but i've been having this problem since around the 3rd month from purchase. Now that i'm entering uni, this problem is proving to be that much more annoying.      Basically the problem is that everytime i turn on the laptop (toshiba a200 - h01 or something like that, Vista Home) i have to either restart the laptop when it reaches the log on screen OR log on and then restart the laptop within 5 - 10 mins of use otherwise the laptop will seem to shut off everything but the power, meaning that absolutely nothing is responsive even though the power is still on and the screen still appears to be on (faint backlight still stays on). After it does this I have no choice but to hold the power button in for 5 and restart it like this.   Now if i restart the laptop right when i turn it on then this problem does not exist. It also doesn't occur when i put it sleep mode or standby.      This problem is highly inconvenient since i'll most likely be taking my laptop to uni and i don't really want to waste time having to restart the laptop every time i turn it on.      Any help will be appreciated.

I am currently in the market for a new computer. I want to get our entertainment out of the Stone Age. Currently using Windows Me OS from 2000.      I have $700 to work with now, and recently acquired AT&T DSL high-speed.   I have a new Wii system that I want to go online with.   I have a Zune.   I am starting a small business website buymimotorcycle.com for the sale of Motorcycle, ATV, Moped, Go cart ect.      I just bought a 32 inch Magnavox TV with the PC compatibility. See:   http://reviews.cnet.com/flat-panel-tvs/p...       I would like to know if this will be worth my time or what is a better choice for near free TV.  http://www.satellitepcbox.com/?hop=lucad...       It would be nice if everything worked together and was expandable for the future.   I do not know much about the future of computers and entertainment other then the price of one today usually is in the landfill tomorrow.  If any one has some good suggestions to what and how I will make it out of the Stone Age prepared please say something.      Should it be the Apple Mini, HP or other? The mini seems small in comparison yet what do I know.      Thank you.

20080502040436AAMVLiH	Computers & Internet;Software	Is anyone a whizz on ProTools?	I posted this question a week ago and I got two stars and one answer telling me that they didn't know the answer.  What is that about!?   So I'm gonna try again otherwise I'll never find out.      I have been using ProTools and I'm having a little trouble with it.  To be honest, I don't know if it's ProTools or Cubase I'm having the trouble with.  I have used Cubase to make drum beats, but the only way I can put bthem into ProTools is to record them (poor quality) and import them into ProTools as an MP3 file.  I know that with ProTools you can import MIDI tracks.  I have saved the drum beats as a MIDI file but when I import them to ProTools they come out played on piano.      I know that when you first open Cubase it is a piano sound that you get but you can change the map to use the drums and this is what I have done.  I have also saved it like this too.  Can anyone tell me what I have to do to keep the MIDI file as a drum map when importing it into ProTools?

20090304091025AAG95qG	Computers & Internet;Programming & Design	Build dynamic menu with VBA in MS Access?	I am building a database in MS Access which will be used by multiple users. Because of the sensitivity of the data, some users will have more access than others (higher / lower user privileges)      What I am trying to do is dynamically build the menu on the switchboard depending on the current users rights.      I've built a function thus far which takes the current users rights as a string seperated by commas. The function then splits the string into an array and iterrates through each value to make menu items visible. This portion works great...      However, what I need to do now is re-position the menu items on the switchboard and resize the menu itself dependent on:      a) How many menu items there are, and;   b) Which menu items are present.      I'm really stuck on this one, and I could use some help from you guys!      Thank you in advance for your advice.
20090304084958AAnPQ7V	Computers & Internet;Software	Where do I find additional information regarding Technical Support with DELL and Microsoft Software?	First off, the computer is a DELL 4100. Old, maybe, yet for my purpose of use, it is more than adequate. Have since upgraded with/to Windows XP Professional.       The issue at hand is that a reboot (WS Service pack 3 error) with CD was made and now it is asking for Product Key and since it was manufacturer installed and furnished CD, MICROSOFT Support will not furnish key - I am told that I have to purchase again, the Software - $399 (original purchase 2/08), because the one I bought is expired.      Called DELL and they sid no, went to Target and they said no - who do I believe? or does/has anyone else experienced this issue.

20090304090115AAdrGEA	Computers & Internet;Hardware;Laptops & Notebooks	1 of 5 laptops fail so, can I use a solid state Dell Mini with GoToMyPC and run programs on a desktop?	I'm actually asking for my wife who is a teacher and has to visit students all over the county. I don't want to buy her a laptop when statistics tell me 20% of them will crap out right in the middle of a hard to schedule parent-teacher-student-conference.       So, can I used a Mini "social networking" computer to connect to her school desk top computer using GoToMyPC.com?       * Have you already done this yourself?    * Are the solid state mini computer more reliable than the laptops?    * Can you foresee any networking issues?       Thanks so much.
20090304084909AAyOnTB	Computers & Internet;Hardware;Laptops & Notebooks	Trouble with CDROM and boot disc..?	The boot discs for XP, Ubuntu, or Vista that I have won't work. I know the discs work fine because 2 days ago I was trying to install XP, got the disc to boot and then got a file error. Right after that I used the Ubuntu disc and have that installed fine on my laptop right now. However the past day or so when I have been trying to use my CDROM to try to boot XP and Ubuntu (in order to set up dual boot, using the Ubuntu disc to partition and the XP to install XP in the partition)NEITHER DISC WOULD BOOT. I have it setup in Bios to read the "USB CD-ROM" as it says in my HP laptop first. When I do put the disc in I would here it turn the discs but it would not "turn over" as you could say and actually read so at the beginning I would get a screen for about 10 seconds then nothing and it would boot normally. There were a few clicking sounds about 5 seconds after the initial buzz of the disc being or "trying" to be read. Also currently in Ubuntu under places, there is a CDRW/DVD drive displayed however it always says "failure to mount" when I try to put a DVD or CD, ANY DVD or CD in. Any help would be greatly appreciated.
