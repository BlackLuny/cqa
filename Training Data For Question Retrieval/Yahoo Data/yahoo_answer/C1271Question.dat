20090307160907AAuoVsZ	Science & Mathematics;Engineering	10 x probe vs 50ohm coaxial cable?	Hi everyone! I was wondering why using a 10x for measuring signal at high frequency is so much better than (or it actually works) compared to a normal 50 ohm coax when I connect it to the oscilloscope. I know that the 10x should have a higher resistance, but I don't understand why using the 50 ohm cable would not give me the desired signal (the signal detected would operate at a very different frequency)....   Thanks a lot!

20090307150033AA2kh9c	Science & Mathematics;Chemistry	Can I separate a two component oil with steam distillation?	I have a two component (two separate compounds) natural product oil and I'd like to separate one component from the other.  They have different boiling points - Can this be done with steam distillation?  The oil is not miscible in water - and if I understand steam distillation correctly (which I'm not sure I do) - the one with the lower boiling point will co-distill with water first???  [Since we are not talking about a solute in a solvent, we don't have the freezing point depression or (in the case of my question) boiling point elevation problem, correct?]  From what I understand, with steam distillation we are dealing with the sum of the vapor pressures of all components involved - and once the sum of all 3 compound's (my two oil compounds and water) vapor pressures equal atmospheric pressure, the distillation will take place - is that correct?  But will they still distill lower bp compound first with water, and then the higher bp compound with water?    Please state in your answer if you've actually performed a steam distillation of this type before.  Thanks in advance.

My friend and I were working, and we found this equation:      Square root of "y" + "y" = 2      Deductively, one can quickly figure out that "y" is equal to "1", since the square root of 1 plus 1 equals 2. However, neither of us have been able to prove it algebraically. This seeming anomaly in math is driving me crazy, and I'm hoping someone here can show how it can be done, or at least explain why it's so impossible.

20090225080120AA2HDMo	Science & Mathematics;Mathematics	Calculus help, needed quickly?	I need some help with these problems. I missed a few days and am behind now, I just don't get how to fuly do them.      1) Given that sinA=-8/17 and CosB=4/5 with A in quadrant 3 and B in quadrant 1, find the following:   a. sin(A+B) I'm thinking it's something like 40/85 + 68/85 so it's sin(108/85) but then how do I get the exact answer, not some clumpy decinmal.   b. cos(A-B) same as above, or am I doing them wrong?   c. tan(2A)    d. sin(A/2)   I know that since A is in quad 3 then the cos is +, but that really doesn't help me all that much in solving it.         2) find the exact value of sin75 degrees.    Do I convert this one to radians and then do like I did in problem 3, or is there a different method for degrees?      3) find the exact value of tan pi/8. For this one I went through the identity going tan(pi/4)/2 which =(1-cos(pi/4))/(sin(pi/4)) but don't know where to go from there.      4) Write (cscX/cotX)-(cotX/cscX) in terms of sinX and cosX and simplify. I've tried it a few ways on this one but it never seems to get in any simpler form, I feel like I'm missing something.   I went through these steps:   (cscX/cotX)-(cotX/cscX)=(1/sinX)/(cosX... but I'm not sure I did all my math right, or if I'm going in the right direction with this.      5) Verify the identitiy (sinX/1-cosX)=(1+cosX/sinX). I'm just not sure where to go here either.

A store begins to stock a new range of DVD players and achieves sales of ￡1500 of these products during the first month.    In a model it is assumed that sales will decrease by ￡x in each subsequent month, so that sales of ￡(1500-X) and ￡(1500-2X) will be achieved in the second and third months respectively. Give that sales total ￡8100 during the first six months, use the model to    A) Show that the expected total sales in pounds during the first n months is given by kn(51-n), where k is an integer to be found.

20090307111918AAUwuLz	Science & Mathematics;Mathematics	Question on variational calculus?	Hi all. In order to further the research I'm doing just now, I'm working through some variational calculus, through a very good book with lots of exercises, but few solutions, as is always the way :)      So here's one: Find the extremals of the functional      J[y, z] = ∫(from 0 to π/2)[(y')2 + (z')2 + 2yz]dx,       where y = y(x) and z = z(x), and we are subject to the boundary conditions      y(0) = 0,   y(π/2) = 1,   z(0) = 0,   z(π/2) = 1.      I don't want to give my attempt unless I influence the outcome of the answers I get; so the only formulae i will give are from the book:       To find the extremals of a functional      J[y, z] = ∫(from a to b)[F(x, y, z, y', z')]dx, we solve the Euler-Lagrange euqations which turn out to be      ?F/?y - (d/dx)[?F/?y'] = 0   ?F/?z - (d/dx)[?F/?z'] = 0      I get answers that don't look right, so I'd appreciate a second glance. I recommend reading about VC to anyone. It's a beautiful field but a complicated one - so I hope there are some experts on here that will help me over the next few months (I'm looking at you Scythian!) ;)

20090307105550AAPbHif	Science & Mathematics;Mathematics	I need some help with this trigonometric substitution prob.?	Evaluate: INTEGRAL dx/(x2+9)      Ok so I have my triangle drawn and my value for x is 3 tanθ and my value for dx is 3sec2θdθ.      I rewrote the integral with these values..canceled out the 3 and 9 which leaves 1/3..and replaced tan2θ+1 with sec2θ.  After this I canceled out the sec2θ from the top and bottom which then just left me with INTEGRAL 1/3dθ.  This isn't correct is it??  The answer has to be in terms of x and I don't see anyway to put it in terms of x so I have the feeling I've done something wrong.  Can someone help please?

20090227085212AA8Gg9H	Science & Mathematics;Mathematics	Optimization Problem?	A box is to be made out of a 6 by 14 piece of cardboard. Squares of equal size will be cut out of each corner, and then the ends and sides will be folded up to form a box with an open top. Find the length , width , and height  of the resulting box that maximizes the volume. (Assume that W is less than or equal to L).       Let X be the side of the squares removed. To solve this problem we should maximize the function V(x) = ___ over the interval [a,b] with a=____ and b=___.   The function V(x) has a unique critical point in (a,b) at x =___. The values of the function at the end points and critical point are V(a)____,       V(x)=____, V(b)=_____.   Thus, the box with maximum volume has dimensions L=___, W=_____, H=______.

If the boulder does not move, what is the resistive force acting      Vx= Vcos   Vy= Vsin      Used Vx= Vcos and Vy= Vsin for each force and got      y: 450+(-267)+(142) = 325   x: (-386)+(-705)+(-531) = -1622      1622(-i) + 325 (j) for the resulatant or net force.      the second part of the question is what im stuck on. i guess from the resultant the boulder is moving so there has to be a resistive force but i don't know how to get there.

GREAT !!       i guess if any country ever runs out of an animal.. they could always go to USA and ask for their "pets" back.. coz soon there will be more endangered tigers as housepets in USA than there are left in the wild forrests !!       so how do we overcome this.. do we keep shooting animals ?? do we accept if you go to the forrest a bear may just bite you or do we shoot them all.. so we can all walk in the baron forest together ??       it seems the modern human ruling over the planet has made bad decisions now for over 100 years.. and i mean decisions so bad they've affected the livlihood of every human and every livbing being.. we are all now gonna suffer coz of the mistakes of 100 years.. as summed up perfectly by the fact rich americans can own rare endangered monkeys as a housepet.. while in the wild.. so few rare animals have survived this HOLOCAUST !!!       so who agrees that Americans should go back to owning a cat and dog and leave tigers and chimps for the jungles ??

I don't even know who I am nor passionate about anything. I just feel like I'm kind of drifting along. Adding to that, I've never been in a relationship, which is fine with me..but I'm not even sure of my sexuality and would never want to kiss a guy. (I kissed a guy before...and just know that I wouldn't want to do it again. I could possibly see myself in a emotional relationship with a guy, but not a physical.   I would say I'm an extremely philosophical person, kind of interested in nihilism, because I don't really believe life has meaning. But part of me wants to find my own meaning and truth.   Adding to that, I've never really had close friends, and don't share my emotions with anyone. Part of me is like, what's the point, we're all just going to die? What's the point of any of this?      I know that I can't look to anyone else or anything to make me happy. I have to make myself happy...and I am trying to really get to know and love myself...but I just can't seem to get there..?

Alright so in class yesterday we got an assignment to determine who got HIV first.  30 students were given a beaker each and were told to mix their liquid with four partners.  After everyone finished mixing the liquid, the teacher placed a chemical into each of the beakers and said that each beaker that was infected with HIV after the exchange would turn purple.  8 beakers out of the 30 turned purple and our assignment is to figure out which beaker initial spread the HIV to the other beakers.

20090307172220AAjQ67T	Science & Mathematics;Mathematics	Help with Quadratic equation problem?	I have a math project to do and the question is as follows:      The path of a large stone fired from a torsion catapult can be modeled by y=-0.00545x2(x-squared) + 1.145x, where x is the distance of the stone traveled (in yards) and y is the height of the stone (in yards)      I used the formual x= -b/2a, or x equals negative b over 2 times a, where a is -.00545 and b is 1.145. The answer i got was that x = .003120125. Then, i used the value of x and plugged it back into the equation to get y, which came out to be y = .003572596.      I got some very odd totals. I do not know if my equation is wrong, or i mixed up my multiplication and division. If someone could please reach my work, or tell me if I am correct, that would be great.       Thanks!
