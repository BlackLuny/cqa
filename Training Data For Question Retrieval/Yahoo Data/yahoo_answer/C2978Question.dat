20090226193226AATTfrG	Environment;Other - Environment	Toxins in our environment?	Is it true that basically every material that the average person comes in contact with is toxic.  I have read from many different websites, and have found many places saying that this is true.  I would like to avoid toxins, but if this is the case wouldn't be almost impossible.  I have also heard that plastics, depending on their chemical composition, are always leaching chemicals into our food.  I would love to get rid of all my plastic ware, and stop using plastic wrap but i just do not have the money to make a change such as this.  Even if this was the case there are still all the other exposures throughout the day such as bottled water and bottled soda and juice.  How can I avoid as much exposure as possible, and is it true that plastic is harmful in all applications.  sorry if this is a lot for one post, I would just like to know.  thanks in advance
20090226195147AAVDtKg	Environment;Global Warming	What are some of your opinions on Global Warming?	My opinion is that it really effects us in many different ways. Also I think that the constant increase of temperature effects us not only in the sea level but also in the different kinds of perspiration. But that is just some of the things I have to think about as a 13 year old because the weather today effect our life tomorrow and if this keeps on going on we will soon be removed from this planet and no im not speaking of god I am speaking of the everyday needs. What do you think??

20090225121844AASpWBt	Environment;Green Living	Would the pollutant/chemicals be better or worse in farm raised fish versus fish caught in the wild?	One reason I don't eat fish is that there has yet to be a fish tested that doesn't have mercury or other chemicals in them.  If someone farm raised fish using all natural food, etc, wouldn't that be a pollutant-less  option?  Does that happen?
20090226210255AAltN34	Environment;Other - Environment	What's is my carbon foot print please?	I don't drive, smoke, or drink beer. I wash my clothes in cold water, I sometimes do three or four loads per day. I pee outside on the grass, I sometimes leave my tv on in my room, I buy some organic foods, I turn off lights, and I do unplug some appilances like a toaster. I walk every day on my tennis court, I put clothes with buttons on them outside on my fence, I do recycle, I dig in the trash cans for finding recyclables and I put them in recycle bin. I don't use paper towels that much, I spit outside in the grass and on my tennis court. I only take three baths per day. I sometimes take four baths. I do take short baths. Thanks for the answers. Let keep our Planet more Green Please. Jared Out

20090226213018AAPYD9q	Environment;Global Warming	A way to reduce global warming?	Is it possible to absorb heat by fissioning argon (rather plentiful in Earth's atmosphere) into oxygen, absorbing heat, and then using the oxygen to make ozone to patch up the hole? Scientists could do this in the middle of the Sahara desert to reduce global temperatures... right?   xD

20090226193556AAcUBOp	Environment;Other - Environment	CFL bulbs: What should I do if I break a lightbulb made with mercury?	For some reason I have a bad habit of knocking over things and dropping things. Over the last few weeks I have accidentally broken 2 light bulbs that had mercury in them (CFL bulbs). The first time this happened I got really sick afterwords and got a rash.. (the rash went away after a few days by itself). Is this just a coincidence? (My friend got the same rash as me (it was identical in appearance), but hers hurt and she said that her doctor said she was allergic to penicillin. Mine never hurt and I wasn't taking penicillin.)   Also, I would like to know the proper way to dispose of CFL bulbs and what to do when one breaks. I know that CFL bulbs are better for the environment, but I really don't think I should use them,  because I'm afraid I will end up breaking them. The problem is that I live with other people and we have CFL bulbs in all the rooms of our house; I don't want to change all the bulbs in our house, because they would probably not be down with that.
