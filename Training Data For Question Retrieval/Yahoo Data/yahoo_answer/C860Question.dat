20090205040249AAnPsXT	Business & Finance;Taxes;United States	Did anyone else get this message this morning concerning their Tax refund being deposited on February 6th?	Do you think there will be a offset? Or is this the general statement?      "Refund Status Results      Your tax refund is scheduled to be direct deposited on February 6, 2009. If your refund is not credited to your account by February 11, 2009, check with your bank to find out if it has been received. Please wait until February 11, 2009 before you contact us again because we are unable to take any action until then.   Please read the following information related to your tax situation:          * Tax Topic 203, Failure to Pay Child Support, Federal Non-Tax and State Income Tax Obligations      Please Note:      Your refund may be reduced to pay a past due obligation such as child support, another federal agency debt, or state income tax. If this applies to you, the Financial Management Service, who issues IRS refunds, will send you a notice informing you of any offset they have made. The details of the debt are not provided to the IRS. Please do not call us to inquire about the details because we will not be able to answer your questions. Instead, direct any questions you have about the offset or debt to the agency identified on the notice. "

20090205051725AAu23wQ	Business & Finance;Careers & Employment;Other - Careers & Employment	Issue with background check?	1) Ok, I got fired from a job in another Country for dishonesty -No, I did not steal, but falsified records and my resume to get a job. The job barely lasted for 3 months. This happened about 4 and a half years back. I learned from that mistake, and I moved on, and here I am, in the USA now.      I wanted to come clean, so I honestly told my current employer about the job loss due to dishonesty (without going too much into excessive detail), and they were ok with it, and offered me a position. In their application form, I even listed this job that I lost, but instead of going into any details about reason for leaving, I briefly put it as "Job Ended". I am about a year and a half into this job.      Now my company wants to get a Govt. security clearance for me, and I filled out a form that went back 7 years, and again, I honestly declared this job that I lost as well - again, giving a brief explanation, but not going into any details.      If the investigation reveals that I falsified records and my resume, will I be pulled up by my current company for not going into details? Worse though, will I be in trouble with the security clearance chaps for the same?      As for as the form - I've been honest about it. But I'm just worried that they may come back to say that I did not give them complete information and create trouble.      2) Sometime ago there was a major disagreement with my wife. It got to a point that I almost decided to call the marraige off. We were living apart for 3 months before we got back together. This aspect completely missed me, and I failed to declare this on the form for the question "List all places you have lived" - What shall I do? Shall I let it go?          I posted this once before - thanks to the gentleman who responded, but I want more of your opinions.      Comments/suggestions?

20090205051302AAqD9nz	Business & Finance;Personal Finance	Bankruptcy or debt consolidation?	I was divorced last fall, in Texas, where I still reside. My attorney refused to ask my x for disclosure, so I did not know that my x had $15,000 in credit card debt. The divorce papers say she's liable for debts she incurred from the day I walked out on her, and for all debts that are in her name, which these 3 revolving accounts are.  But, she hasn't paid and yesterday, after getting turned down for credit, I checked my credit online and found out that two of her credit card companies have put charge-offs on my credit, a third one is about to, because she's 190 days past due on it, and she never paid the phone bill so Embarq has put a charge-off on my credit, too, for $150, which is the least of my worries, but my credit score is barely over 400 now.  Everything else on my credit shows "paid on time/as agreed".  I've never made a late payment on anything my whole life.    I'm considering bankruptcy, but I own two homes (one is a rent house, both are mobile homes).  The industry I work in is winding down and I had planned on moving into the landlord business.  I'd planned to purchase an RV park, not only as a new career, but as my only retirement income, as well.  I'll be 50 years old in a few months.  I don't have years left over to build more credit.  Suing my x for whatever she owes me will not do any good, because she refuses to work, doesn't have a job skill and will surely never pay me once I win in court.    My income is excellent, and I may make too much for Chapter 7.  Also, one of my homes is in a mobile home park inside a city limits.  My main home sits on 2 acres in a subdivision, outside of city limits.  I'm concerned that if I file bankruptcy, I won't be able to keep both houses.  I also have two cars. One is a junker that my X trashed and gave back to me while the divorce was still pending.  I owe less than $2,000 on it.  The other car is very nice, only 2 years old, and I owe a lot on it.  I'm paying on all this, on time.  My only concern is losing my homes and the good car.  Personally, I have no other bills besides the two house payments and the two car payments & their insurance.  I have no revolving accounts.  Given my plans for retirement and my unsteady job security right now, which do you think I should do, file or consolidate just her bad bills and pay them off over time?

20090205052829AAKWCDK	Business & Finance;Insurance	Does anyone think it is fair that a married couple where both work should have to ?	My husband works in health care. He pays mega bucks for health insurance for our family. 2 years ago I went back to work. Here is our choice: I must take insurance through my company (according to my husband's health care provider) which would cost me $400 a month and is horrible or my husband has to pay a $185 penalty per pay period (every 2 weeks) has anyone else had this come up? We recently hired a girl sort of in the same boat as I but for her it is even worse bcuz her husband's health care provider is the same as ours. In both our cases we talked to HR who cut our hours to 32 this way insurance is not offered to us and our husband's won't be penalized. I just sort of think they scam us every way they can.
20090205053802AA8okdq	Business & Finance;Taxes;Other - Taxes	Tax refund "processing delay."?	The situation is this.  My wife and I were separated almost all of last year, maintained separate households, the whole bit.  She had my stepkid living with her, I had my child living with me.  We recently got back together.      Since we lived apart, we met the guidelines for HOH...and that is how we filed our taxes.      Now, since we had previously filed jointly, we BOTH claimed the 08 stimulus refund, $1688.  I claimed it on my return, she claimed it on hers.  Now, the IRS site says mine is being deposited tomorrow, her's has a "processing delay."      Oh, one more thing: Prior to this year she was a stay-at-home mom.        Here is what I'm thinking: I'm thinking that since she didn't file separately in 2007, and yet claimed the 2008 ($1688) stimulus rebate, that's why there is a delay in processing her refund.  Question is, will her refund be lessened?  Doesn't seem so, because when doing her taxes, it didn't add to her refund by claiming it.  I'm thinking that a human will review and see that she didn't file in 07, and also didn't receive the $1688 that she claimed to have received anyway...then release the money.  Am I right?

20090205063527AAOLnQ7	Business & Finance;Renting & Real Estate	Is the real estate market going up in 6 months?  Should I wait to sell my house?	Basically I live in a neighborhood build in 1950 so out of 400 homes they are all pretty much the exact same.  There are only 2 models to chose from.  Our home was extended so I have finished dormer upstairs- giant family room and extra bedroom and full bath.  I also have a back room that was an add on so my house is pretty large compared to other homes.  Our home is UNDER market value price and people are still under bidding by insane amounts.  Everyone is under bidding us by 30,000 which is cheaper then the smallest row home in the area.  We can't sell that cheap we are already losing money.  But it's been like a circus- I have at least 4 couples a week coming through my home- sometimes 10 a week.  Everyone wants to see it because it's large and has the extra full bath for a great price- we are only like 5 grand more then the smaller homes.  Last week a couple ask me how low I would go and when I won't agree to the 30 grand they made a weird comment about waiting until I loose house!  I laughed and said- I am relocating and can afford both my houses but would only like to pay for the one I would be living in.  Everyone assume I am losing my house and thinks they can scam me for a great deal.  My other house will not be finished for about 6 months- should I leave my house on the market or pull it?      I live in Philly so it's not like Ohio or other markets.      The agents are very nice and say their sorry about a 100 times, they say that everyone is demented from watching the news.  One agent said that one girl thought she was going to get a brand new mansion house for like a 100,000 and flipped out when she came in my house because of the low ceilings 9 foot.      Ugh- How do I get through this?  And everyone is terrible rude- walking with muddy boots through my home.

Ok let's say I build a house and I do a lot of the subcontracting myself and even some of the work myself and therefore build the house for quite a bit less than I would pay a builder for a turn-key house. Let's say my construction loan balance after the house is complete is $200K.  My question..what is the PMI based on?  Would I have to come up with 20% of the construction loan balance or is it just dependent on the appraisal? In other words, if I put down 5% ($10K), my mortgage would be $190K. If the house appraised for $237,500, would I be exempt from paying PMI?
20090205054850AAIkB82	Business & Finance;Renting & Real Estate	Does FHA require suspect Mold to be remediated?	I'm in contract on a property I hope to close on Feb. 25. The home inspection revealed that the AC closet had some mold on the floor boards.  The report was clear that the rest of the house was non-condusive to mold.  We had it swab-tested, and the lab results came back as the non-toxic type (although the lab is not willing to write "non-toxic" on their report).  The inspection reports were forwarded to the bank the same day.  3 weeks later, when I received my commitment letter, it had the condition of having an "acceptable results of a mold inspection" without any further clarification. When we pushed them for an answer, they said they wanted all mold out, or a quote from a remediation company along with required funds in escrow - except that by the time they told me this, I was contractually out of time to perform any inspections or inform the sellers that we needed it fixed (so, we're out of luck, and this will have to come strictly out of my pocket). The underwriter says that he needs the mold cleared for FHA requirements, but, I've searched EVERYWHERE and did not find any documents that say that FHA requires mold to be remediated.

We still have the same amount of gold, silver, diamonds, and platinum in the world today that we had before this worldwide recession. We are told that there is no money. This tells me that our money is not real. Is it a scam or a joke. What is the American dollar based on? It was on a gold standard once. At one time, a person could take an American dollar, (silver certificate), into any USA bank and walk out with a silver dollar. A man sold billions of dollars in stock that did not exist and yet he is not in jail. A regular person will get put in jail for stealing a beat up rusted out $500.00 car. This is not adding up. Who has the gold, silver, diamonds and platinum? What backs our money? What gives it value? Is it all worthless paper that we are being fooled into thinking it is real?

20090205082553AAfeN0S	Business & Finance;Credit	Trying to clean up my husband's credit but I have a few questions about handling charged off debt.?	My husband has a charged off debt of $1287.85 through the Military Star Card Program. We received a collection notice from OSI Collection Services Inc. The notice says he owes the above amount PLUS $521.54 for interest and penalties, $494.46 for Collection fees and $50.73 for administrative fees, for a total of $2354.58.      This seams fairly bogus. I mean why do we owe a collection company interest, collection fees and administrative fees? I know these companies buy the debt for pennies on the dollar. Usually for about 20% of the actual debt. So why in the hell would I pay almost twice the original debt?      I am completely willing to pay the full amount for the ORIGINAL debt but all of these tacked on fees are just rediculous.      How do I go about negotiating a reasonable settlement? Should I just forget it all together since it is in collections and has been charged off?       We are trying to buy a Van in the next couple of months so I am trying to clean things up but if contacting this collection agency is going to make my husband's credit worse rather than better, I'd like to know ahead of time.       Any advice or suggestions would be great!

20090205072202AAjuKG2	Business & Finance;Personal Finance	Should I take out a loan and focus on my tiny business?	I've always wanted to have my own business since I could remember. I finally came up and designed my own product. It's not a "I'm going to make a million dollars off of this" type of product. In fact, it will have a very limited customer base. Anyway, I don't mind coughing up my own money for this product because I can use it, too, and it will open up doors for other products just like it. As well as give me experience.      Starting up this business, right now with the company I'm talking to, will cost about 9,000. I will only have about a third of this. I'm trying to cut down the cost to about $4,000.      Should I take out a bank loan if that's not a possibility? I really want to own my own business, I have a great sales rep who can sell water to a fish (and he happens to be my best friend), and I really want the experience for when I start up bigger, more lucrative businesses.      I need some guidance.

We bought a house last year (6/08) and are First time home buyers, would we get $7500 or would we qulaify for the $15000.  It seems that it's all speculation right now, but the way I was reading this new legislature was that the $15000 will be for home buyers in 2009 and the $7500 credit will be gone.  Actually, the articles I have read state that this new credit would "sunset" the $7500 credit.  Does this mean I won't qualify for anything now?

I have put more than $20,000 and countless hundreds of hours into updating, insulating, refurbishing and painting, landscaping,etc. There is a 600 square foot detached garage which is twenty years old, insulated and drywalled.   For sale now in the same neighborhood, there are houses of the same size and approximate age, with no garage, no recent remodeling or  updating, with asking prices which are at least 20% higher than the    realtor wants to ask for my house. I think that he is trying to scam me into selling cheap just so that he can make a quick sale.  Any opinions or advice?   I have not signed a contract.

Basically i am just wondering if it could even survive being put through the trash process..it was just a small laptop hard drive outside of its case..usually if you just drop them they are toast. i also heard the trash from my town goes to the local power plant to be incincerated so the only chance it could have been found is point a to point b. What do you guys think?      I cant seem to get these thoughts out of my head and this has completely taken over my life..any help would be great i am really suffering here, i just really dont know what else to do..i am on paxil and have considered therapy but i dont know if that will even help me..       I have always had obsessions throughout my life. But not one that has gripped one so violently like this. I am sure people are sick of seeing me ask this, but it is theraputic for me to get reassurance, although i know it is not a solution. I guess i just feel silly seekign therapy for something so ridiculous. It is embarrassing.      I want to try and get over this without going to therapy, i am just not sure how.      Should i seek therapy? I have already checked my credit report and what not, but i always seem to just tell myself it just hasnt happened YET.

My primary residence currently worth $300K, and the original loan on the house was $585K (first for $60K and second for $120K). The purchase price for the property was $585K   I also own an investment property which is currently worth $225K. The loan on the house is $280K (only first loan). The purchase price for this property was $285K      Now, what I did was I took a second home equity loan of 60K from the investment property and put it towards the second loan of the first property (by refinancing into a lower interest loan). This is how the equation looks like now:      Primary residence   Current value:$300K   Loan 1:$460K (Interest only - 5/1 arm to expire in 2 yrs);This is the original loan   Loan 2: $60K (30 yr fixed P+I); (Refinanced loan)         Investment property   Current value:$215K   Loan 1:$280K (Interest only - 5/1 arm to expire in 2 yrs);   Home equity Loan 2:$60K (15 yr fixed P+I);      I cannot afford to hold on to the properties.   My question is, if I foreclose on both properties, what are the consequences. Can the lenders come after me for the deficiency amount. I tried to short sale for last 6 months, with no success.
20090205071914AANcExt	Business & Finance;Taxes;United Kingdom	New Business - Should I set it up as a sole trader or limited company? What are the benefits of each?	I do not have much experience or knowledge on the financial and legal side of starting a business, so i thought someone out there may be able to help me. Below are the details of what the business is, and its plans. If you can advise me on how to start it, and register it etc. please.    The business-     to run approximately 5 educational courses per year.  will not have a base, evrything will work from website, phone and email  payment will be made by paypal or bank transfer  the course itself would be in a hired hall or theatre  each course we expect about 200 attendees.  and rough charge would be 50 per course per person.  so evry course will take about 10,000, and yearly 50,000     Workers-  there are alltogther 3 workers involved, me being the course director  we all will get comissioned based wages, per courses  whatever the profit is from a course the workers will get a pecentage of it,  eg, 1st worker 20%, 2nd worker 15%, 3rd worker 15%, n the rest of the 50% profit will be invested for the next course, this is if we meet our target, the percentage can change due to what the profit  i will have volunters on the course day  the course instructor will not get wages, rather a gift     so if you can advise me on what sort of business i should set it up as and the measures i shall take in to account.

20090205070052AA96JgC	Business & Finance;Credit	Apartments "accidentally" ruined my credit? What can I do and who do I talk to?	I lost my job and asked the apartment complex that if there was anything I could do to get out of the lease without having to pay the 500 dollars termination fee. They were very sympathetic and said if I could move out by the weekend that they could rent it out that quickly and I wouldn't have to worry about anything. Well 4 months have gone by and I received a collections notice saying that I owed the collections agency 500 dollars. I quickly called the apartment complex, and she "forgot" to notify our agreement to the headquarters, I asked if they had gone after my credit and she said they had. She said she was going to do everything in her power to reverse it. In the past month I had tried to build credit by getting small credit cards, and even co-sign for a loan, and they all turned me down even with great co-signers. I now know why! I am infuriated and want to know if I can press chargers, and what kind of lawyer I talk to about this matter. I have called many and they all say they don't cover that kind issue. Please use references with your answer so I know that it's legit and not just an opinion. Thanks!

Okay so i'm on JSA, ive been on it for over a year now, i'm not a person who just sits on my backside all day and claim money, I have been doing voluntary work for a year.  Anywayz I go to the job centre and i went straight to the machine bit to look for some jobs and i found a few, i did continue to look for more but my name was called.  The guy (job advisor) did not even give me time to sit down he just handed me back my book and said "see you in two weeks time".  So with a puzzled face I was like "so isn't the system not working then" hes like "Hmm theres no jobs on there for you" so i was pretty pissed by that but anyway i came home and i went on there site to find there was more than 10 jobs in different areas close to where I live that I could apply for so i could not understand why he told me there was no jobs.      I know times are hard now with Credit Crunch, but there are still jobs available and the jobs I did found i still had to ring back the job centre to get more information because some jobs say you need to ring the job centre to get the companys number or to know how to contact the company whether its email or post.  I'm just angry, Has anyone ever experienced this??

20090205074500AA4pHkQ	Business & Finance;Renting & Real Estate	Does anyone else think it's unfair that houses purchased in 2008 don't qualify for non-repayment/$15,000?	I purchased my home in June 2008 and was unaware of any legislation regarding the $7,500 tax credit. I have yet to file my taxes because my husband and I are waiting to see what type of legislation Congress passes and see if it will affect our return. We have been debating about whether or not to use the $7,500 tax credit, especially since we would have to repay it. Yesterday we found out that they might not make home buyers repay the $7,500, and furthermore, might increase the credit to $15,000...but I've seen a lot of blogs saying that this will only be for homes purchased in 2009.       I think this is the most ridiculous thing I've ever heard of! If they are essentially amending the first piece of legislation, they should amend it for the entire time frame, not just part of it. Honestly, I don't care as much about the amount of money I would receive on the credit, but I do care that people who purchased 6 months after me might not have to pay the money back! I made my contribution by purchasing a home when the housing crisis first hit our community. Since then, I've seen houses purchased for tens of thousands less than what they were listed at when we made our purchase, PLUS the interest rates are almost 1% lower than they were when we purchased. People are already getting better deals than most 2008 buyers received, so why shouldn't we be allowed to receive the same government aid the 2009 buyers will?       Extend the deadline for home purchases all you want to, but don't single out the people who purchased in the original time frame!

20090205075514AAlSvon	Business & Finance;Taxes;India	Tax Benefit for Under Construction property?	Hi I have purchased under construction property with loan of 31 lacs. The construction is not going to complete before 31st March 2009. I have paid Interest of Rs 2.4L in this financial year (2008-09). I understand that I can not claim tax exemption in this year. But the same amount has to be equally divided for next 5 years. That means, I can claim (2.4L + 48K = 2.88L) for 5 years from 2009-10 onwards. Which is of no use to me since the actual interest paid in those five years itself will exceed limit of 1.5L.       Does that mean, I have lost exemption of 1.5L for current financial year (2008-09)?   Is there any way I can save this much tax?

She doesn't have a bank account and wanted to get her return sooner than later. Just like most of us she has bills she's behind on. She's suppose to get her direct deposit tomorrow 2/6/09 but I've read several things saying that because she's not on my account that the IRS or bank won't let the deposit go through because of that and that the money will be sent back to the IRS and they will issue a check. But I've also read many things saying that the bank will most likely let it go through.

20090205084255AALwsqH	Business & Finance;Careers & Employment;Other - Careers & Employment	Job Interview - Ever been turned away because of this?	I had a couple of job interviews today, similar companies, and I wore my usual - a pair of dark-wash jeans, a t-shirt and a dress shirt over top. I've always worn this kind of thing for interviews. This is what I usually wear for interviews. (Trust me, I don't look bummy).      When I got to the second interview, I was sitting in a waiting room, waiting for the interviewer. When she came in, this is exactly what she said, word for word - "Hello, love. Nice to meet you. I'm sorry to say that I'm going to have to refuse you, and there will be no more interviews because you're wearing jeans - that's our policy. And next time you go to an interview (whispered) dress up a little."      I just said "Are you serious?" Because I thought she was joking! I was expecting her to say "Come on in!" But she wouldn't even let me through the door.       I just felt really insulted because I'm not stupid - I know you're supposed to look nice for an interview. It was very condescending, as well as humiliating. I don't own a nice pair of pants, but I have plenty of nice jeans. It felt a little discriminatory, because it's basically saying, OUT LOUD, "I'm not hiring you simply because of the way you have dressed."      Any input on this?

If the IRS was to flag your return for some reason/question some thing on it, how long after they receive it should I hear from them requesting more info? I e-filed on 1/16, if they were needing info or proof from me would they not have contacted me by now?   a lil addtnl info....   You see, I have been banging my head off the wall trying to figure out why I won't receive my refund till 2/24 when I filed on 1/16. Finally today it hit me....I had a daughter in 1997 and claimed her in 97 & 98. 2000 through 2005 my boyfriend claimed her NOT as a dependent but as an exemption so he did NOT receive eic or child tax credit for her. In 2006 & 2007  my boyfriend did NOT claim her as an exemption and I did not file taxes cause I didn't work due to pregnancy, then my baby being diagnosed with cancer and then her passing.   What I'm thinking is that because there is a child that is on my tax return for 2008 that hasn't been there since 1998 MAYBE this is the hold up with my refund? What do you think?    Thanks for the input, I appreciate it. I know it's a long one...sorry, I was trying to put as much detail as possible.

My horror story begins in March last year when I was travelling from Morocco and my baggage went missing. I reported the matter to a desk at Heathrow which was representing the airline that I was using. They asked me to wait a week and ring a number they gave me. It didn't turn up a week later so I rang this number in Prague. They told me to send them a list of items in my baggage and they would look for it again. I sent them the list. I also rang my insurance company to tell them that I had a claim to make - I filled in the paperwork and sent it off. In the meantime the airline asked me to send me the original paperwork proving that I was travelling with the airline etc. I did this. Since then I have made numerous calls, written letters, to the airline and they keep completely ignoring me. The insurance company in the meantime sent out an assessor who told me that they had a letter from the Airline saying that I hadn't lodged a complaint with them!!!! This is despite numerous conversations and letters. The insurance company now want a letter from the airline saying they will not pay out. This has been going on for nearly a year and I caught in this bureaucratic trap through no fault of my own! What can I do resolve this issue. Please help!!

This morning his says the 6th for DD as well (his must have taken longer since it said there was an RRC mistake that they corrected, they added another $300 to his return). My question is, he has some old defaulted student loans. We have called the offset hotline, and have been told that there MAY be (1) interception, from the Department of Education. But now that the IRS has updated and given him a firm DD date of tomorrow, does that mean that we may actually see the refund instead of having it jacked??????

I confirmed this before moving in due to respiratory problems. During the summer I did not have a problem with smoke in my unit, but it has become a significant problem since winter hit. I reported this to my landlord and said I believed the neighbor was smoking in his apartment because the smoke seems to come through the ventilation system. The landlord's say they have checked and found no one smoking in neighboring apartments. They say the smoke is not coming from outside, even though I can walk outside and not smell smoke nor see anyone smoking while there is a strong smoke smell inside my apartment. The landlord's have clearly stated that they will do nothing about this.       I need some sort of test to prove that there is significant smoke in my apartment. I think if I could test the air in the ventilation system and verify there is smoke in there then perhaps the landlord would be convinced to try and help.

20090205083410AA51fax	Business & Finance;Renting & Real Estate	How long should I wait to buy a house?	Having ~$18,000 saved up, and making about 55 gross in a year (hopefully a raise next month), I'm wondering how much longer I should wait to buy a house.  I've been saving at a rate of about 1500-2000 a month.  I am going to sort out my credit when I start thinking about actually doing this, but there's no reason I shouldn't have good credit, I always pay my credit cards off completely when due.        I need to know how much I can expect to actually be able to put as a downpayment.  I always kind of thought I could use whatever I saved, but then realized there can be a lot of other costs, and that I should also have a fair amount of money saved up for rainy day funds.  How much more should I try to save up?  How much will I actually be able to put down for a downpayment, versus how much else will I need to spend on closing costs and have available later?      I've been looking on online calculators, and feel like 200,000 is probably a conservative upper limit.  Does that sound right?  I don't have much in expenses other than a few hobbies.      I'm also waiting to see how this whole 15k tax credit thing works out.  Would it be better to look now, in winter, when there are less other buyers making offers?  I know theoretically it would probably be best to just save and save, but I don't want to be doing that TOO much longer.      Thanks for any advice anyone can offer!

20090205082919AAg5FtM	Business & Finance;Taxes;United States	At Which Date Will I Get My Tax Return Check?	I filed online with TaxACT and chose direct deposit with no paperwork.  The email sent from TaxACT said the IRS should have the money sent on 2/6/2009 (tomorrow), though it isn't a guarantee.  The IRS website said I should have it BY 2/10/2009 (Tuesday).  Technically tomorrow is by Tuesday, but does this mean I won't get my money until Tuesday?  I also don't know if the information given on the website takes into account that I chose the direct deposit method.  Had I chosen to receive a check, it could possibly be sent out tomorrow and I receive it Tuesday.

20090205082252AAYZmjC	Business & Finance;Renting & Real Estate	My apartment wasnt ready for me to move in on Feb 1, should I pay rent for these first few days?	When signing my lease I gave the landlord's assistant a list of things I wanted to be done before I moved in which included fixing holes and painting walls white including one wall that is green, re-caulking around tub and putting up a pole for hanging clothing in the closet. They had 2 weeks to complete the work from the time I gave them my deposit to my move in date.     When I moved in this Saturday, nothing from the list was done. And there was no heat and there was a big crack in the pipe under the sink and a clog in the pipes.     I have been very patient and worked with the landlord to get the items on my list completed and the additional repairs done.   The first two days, I stayed at a friends for 2 nights while heat wasn't working and brought a friend in to wait for gas company so heat could get turned on because his super couldn't be there and neither could I. I met the super one evening and gave him money so he could get materials for the pole. I met the plumber another evening so he could help with the clog and broken pipe, but didnt have materials to fix it.      The super still needs to come, paint and fix the caulking, and hang the clothing rod. The landlord has arranged for the super to come and meet me 2 nights in a row to fix everything, but the super never showed up.   The plumber is supposed to come tonight to fix the pipe problems.     Am getting really frustrated and considering moving out even.   I haven't been able to unpack any of my things for the entire 5 days of living there. The first 2 days I had no heat. The last 2 days I haven't been able to use the sink.     Should I tell him Im not paying for rent for days until problem is fixed?  Could I break the lease and find another place? Would I be liable?

20090205083750AAc0yRo	Business & Finance;Credit	Can a mortgage company refuse to report my mortgage payments to the credit bureau?	CitiMortgage, Inc. took over my mortgage from another company about six months after we filed Bankruptsy. Since they took over the mortgage (in spring of 2004) they have refused to notify the credit agencies that my payment are on time and current . The payments are automatically taken from my account. The reporting agencies show me as "delinquent" since Citibank took over this loan. They have repeatedly refused to report my payments and tell me that they "don't have to". No one else wil consider me for Refinance because of this and a credit score under 600. Is there any help for me or am I stuck with these (as I see them) CROOKS.
