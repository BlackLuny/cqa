20090203104814AANJDhS	Family & Relationships;Marriage & Divorce	So is it really true? how to make it enjoyable?	they say that your first time will be very awkward because you don't know what you're doing.      I'm 24 and a virgin btw.      So what if I went on wikipedia and other educational sites and found out all the areas of the body that are sensitive sexually?(neck, head, waist etc)?  And whoever I sleep with if he is a virgin he researches himself before doing it.      Would it make it better?
20090203111932AAx9pGX	Family & Relationships;Friends	How can someone deal with this?	I have a friend who feels isolated and alone. He is traumatised by recent losses in his life, and suffers from depression and low self esteem. He has practically shut himself off from everyone, and refuses all help. This is compounded by the fact that he never takes medication, no matter what it's for.      I know that he feels that everybody has deserted him, and I've seen some indications that he may be contemplating suicide. However, he will not engage in any kind of discussion. Also, I feel that maybe he does not trust anybody any more, as he has become extremely secretive.      I need to know what might help my friend. I know he needs someone around to reassure him he's not alone, but he clearly feels alone even with company, that he only rejects. All his other friends are getting annoyed with this behavior, and are starting to complain about him. I fear it may not be long before they give up on him.

20090203120946AA4zipa	Family & Relationships;Marriage & Divorce	Are his feelings genuine or is he on a taboo high-He moved out to date his roommates' ex?	He moved out to date his roommates ex. She didn't think he would ever like her and wasn't trying to be more than a friend. She likes him now that he's revealed his interest. How should she feel about his sacrafice? Does he like her just because it was forbidden. The break up was over a yr ago and the guy broke up with her. Do you think this guy likes her b/c he has decided to through caution to the wind and like his roommates ex and he is living on a high from doing something taboo or are his feelings genuine for her? He seems to appreciate a lot of qualities about her.

20090203112242AAtAjCy	Family & Relationships;Marriage & Divorce	Why do guys yell at you and get so mad even though they say they love you a lot?	we love each other a lot but we are always fighting...it's because we are both stubborn. when we are not fighting we are very affectionate and loving towards each other...anyway my husband yells at me and blows up on me a lot, but i mostly think it's because we've been together for almost 4 years and i don't trust him fully and he knows that and i always feel like he is lying (it all has to do with my childhood). anyway he blows up whenever i question his honesty or his trustworthiness, etc. pretty much anything related to those subjects he blows up on me about. is this really bad on his end? or am i the bad one here? please refrain from being rude...thank you
20090203122847AA08b3U	Family & Relationships;Friends	I can't believe she said this about me?	So yesterday I was at a basketball game, and i was talking (and flirting) with one of my guy friends, but he is def only a friend. my one "friend" is a cheerleader and she saw us talking and immediately  thought we were going out. i had to tell her a dozen times that we weren't. my guy friend texted me that night saying that he was talking to her after the game and told him that she thinks i like him but he shouldn't date me cause i am too manly! okay i'm 5'2" like 120 lbs i'm one of the smallest girls in our grade, i don't see how i am manly! and she's supposed to be my friend, but i kind of lost a lot of respect for her when my ex broke up with me. we used to fight all the time because she would flirt with him and then he would lie about it. it made me so mad that she said that about me. what should i do? i ignored her all day and even sat at a different table at lunch.

20090222200013AAL2Vv6	Family & Relationships;Other - Family & Relationships	Why aren't we communicating as much this week?	This girl I've been dating for a couple months now has been very busy this week. Normaly she would still find the time to text me or text me back but hasn't really been too communicative this week. I asked her a couple days ago if she wanted to hang out this next coming week and she said "yes definitely", gave me a quick update then headed off for work. I decided I need to give her some space. Should I be concerned about the lack of communication this past week or could it just be that she's busy and hasn't forgotten about me? I just dont want her to forget about me      Less than a week ago she told me she likes the way things are going with me and shes glad I didnt give up on her before (long story). Last time we hung out was during a very romantic valentines where she spent the night with me (no sex though).

Don't get me wrong, it is great when we have sex, but I would just like it a little more often. I don't feel wanted or needed. I'm not sure what to do.

From what I've learned most guys don't like girls that ***** but kinda like it when they are a ***** to them.  I guess it's like the same how most girls are attracted to the a holes while most guys are attracted to bitches?  Would a guy rather just hit & quit it with a ***** over a nice girl or it doesn't even matter?  Would they rather date a ***** over a nice girl?  Or do the guys like a nice girl, that's a ***** every now and then?
20090222200148AAlB6Zz	Family & Relationships;Friends	Closeness to a best friend?	There's this guy who I consider as my all time best friend.  Is it normal for us to talk about things like relationships/girlfriends and how good of friends we are and stuff that the stereotype of a guy wouldn't normally talk about?  Also, I am very defensive of him where if someone is talking to him I will feel left out.  Is this strange?  I also enjoy the time I have with him and always look forward to seeing him.  I had a bad experience before with friends and I'm wondering if I'm so attached because I haven't really experienced having a true friend.  So, I mostly just want to know if it's normal that I find this kid as utterly awesome beyond belief?  (by the way, I'm not homosexual, especially considering I always talk to him about my girl problems)

Sorry for the mistakes I am dyslexic so i will try my best to break down the information.      I am a british citizen and was made homeless 2 and a half years ago when my mother kicked me out. Now I'm living in my 2nd hostel, I've just turned 20, have no other issues that make me a priority apart from the fact that i live in a hostel already, just been given an eviction notice for things i simply have not done.       I don't know why my hostel owner has decided to come down on me like this but some have said it's because of my age and seeing as I'm the youngest in my hostel (every other girl here is over 25) some are saying this is the reason theey are trying to kick me out.      Eviction notice is for 30th march 2009, have been bidding for the last year every thursday without fail i'm currently "band AS" but just not seem to be getting any where.      I even started to bid as early as possible, around 7.30am on the bidding day morning but when i check my queue position in the houses i've bidded for on the date the bidding closes i find myself still low in the queue. It varies from like 14 to 47      Basically this is my last chance being housed as after being evicted I will never be a priority and have the oppertunity to be offered another hostel or even think about private renting as I have no savings.      I would appreciate any advice/information on how this whole bidding system works? Is this a 1st come 1st served thing or is there some other way it works?

What I would like is to get 10k, drop the case and then have him sign over all rights as a father.  I think it would be fair for both sides.        Now here are the real questions:      Will the state allow that?   Would the state pay and then he owes them?

20090222201147AAJSPM6	Family & Relationships;Marriage & Divorce	Would you be upset if this happened to your spouse?	Ok, here's a little background info.  My hubby's family doesn't like me much.  Also, my stepdaughter has been getting into quite a bit of trouble lately, and when he told his family what she did (it was a pretty big thing, and for certain reasons is was important that they know), they did not want to talk with us or her about it, and have not contacted my hubby since.  This was about 3 weeks ago.      Anyway, yesterday was both my hubby's brother's and my hubby's stepmom's birthdays. My husband found out that a birthday party was being thrown for them this evening, yet neither him nor the rest of our family (me and the kids) were invited.  I realize that things are a little rough right now, but isn't family supposed to love unconditionally?  I am angry about it, not for myself because I could care less, but I am sure that must have been hurtful to my husband.  I asked him how he felt about it, and he said he didn't care, but he's the type that doesn't show much emotion, and I'm pretty sure he really does.      My question is, would you be angry on behalf of your spouse in a situation like this, or would you just let it go?

20090222201432AA9piBs	Family & Relationships;Other - Family & Relationships	Why are people so bad at parenting now, no one disciplines their child about inappropriate behaviour in public?	I don't get it as the parents of these badly behaved kids must have been disciplined by their parents as that's the way it was in the past. So why are they so scared to give their kids a good telling off when it's warranted. Seriously, they do seem scared of their kid becoming emotionally upset or not liking them. Examples being: I know it's not parents but a school group at an observation tower I was at recently where me & the other members of the public were enjoying this fantastic view of the city, then the school group arrives - the kids were about 10 so should have known better - they ran around, tried to break the binoculars there for the public to use, yelled all over the place. Their teachers said & did nothing about it & let them run riot. The people running the observation tower ignored them also even though myself & all the other adults there were glaring at the kids & their teachers. When I was at school we would have gotten a little pep talk from our teachers before going to something like that - we'd be told you're representing your school so behave & don't make noise, etc. If we did misbehave we would be told off.      The next day I was on a plane & the maybe 8 to 10 year old kid behind me kicked & punched the back of my seat the whole time. I glared at his parents & they looked embarrased, yet failed to tell him off. He then stood up on the seat in his shoes & yelled out stuff. The parents & airline staff did nothing, even though me & the other passengers were looking on, appalled. He was way too old to be behaving like that.      If you go to the movies & parents are there with their kids they let their kids talk loudly throughout the whole film & if you say something they say, he's just a kid, etc. But they always look embarrassed & don't know what to say when I ask them, so when you were his age you did that at the movies? Obviously not, so why won't they tell their kid to shut up? I'm tired of asking people to tell their kids how to behave.      The worst is when you're in the changing rooms of clothing stores & an unsupervised kid comes & opens the curtains while you're getting changed, exposing you naked to the whole store!!!

I hate to do that, but they always end up crying and i don't know how to react. Sometimes i mean about the break ups but it annoys me when they get upset and cry. Please don't make me feel bad about myself because i know what've done is probably wrong. I can't help it,  i'm so empty hearted.

Because sometimes I think that Indian men don't understand how hard it is and what a sacrifice it can be for their new wives... sometimes with little or no help from their husbands or mother inlaws..... in a new and strange environment.   Would men cope as well in that situation?

20090222201023AA3DAMG	Family & Relationships;Marriage & Divorce	Found porn in my partner's drawer while looking for my DVD?	so I watched it - I don't mind a bit of porn and I certainly don't mind him watching it, but he seems to have a really low sex drive at the moment, unless he's having his needs taken care of by watching the porn...what do you think?  (He has been depressed for almost a year but I thought he was getting better).
20090222202704AAwN2mX	Family & Relationships;Family	Why am I so paranoid?	My sister's husband is pretty much the coolest guy ever. He's friendly to pretty much everyone, and whenever I visit them (which is like, once a year, lol) he always seems like he enjoys my company. but every time, I get this feeling that I'm just not cool enough to talk to him. I feel like he always sees something negative in me...maybe I'm a quiet dork who just sits in a corner, while he's the outgoing jock type of guy.   but he certainly doesn't act like he dislikes me...he actually seems to care about everything I do, and seems kinda overprotective at times. Not that it's a horribly bad thing.      I still feel like he's way too amazing to be related to me, or to even want to talk to me. Every little thing he does that seems like he's doesn't want to talk to me, I take it way overboard and think that he hates me. I hate that feeling. I think it could be because I'm a teenager and he's in his late twenties. I don't know, what do you think?

20090222202222AAYFhK3	Family & Relationships;Marriage & Divorce	What a mess a cheater makes?	wife of 10 years has been cheating with a guy 15 years her senior (she is 38) we have 2 wonderful boys 4 and 2. In the last 12 months she has gone away with him on several trips both overseas and interstate  totaling 2 months away, she comes home after 12am at least 2 times per week and uses me as a babysitter for the kids, so she can co off and live a palatial lifestyle and have the comfort of her home environment (when it suits her) counselling - she walked out; due to what she has done it has been very easy to emotionally detach myself from her. She has no remorse and goes along each day as if nothing is wrong, every time I speak to her about it, she builds up an angry wall of defence and i cant communicate to her. She has health issues which I am not sure if her hormones are being affected at all, its like she has no morals.   The kids are with me all the time, I organise them in the mornings and take them to day care/school and pick them up, and I do at least 70% duties, I do pull back just so she can spend time with them.   Before you all say, throw her out or get a lawyer!, I have spoken to a lawyer and in Australia; what she has done does not constitute her being a bad mother, as the judge would say "we have different parenting styles" and i would have to share custody.    I have been very accomodating and have had on my parenting 'hat' since there birth, I have not missed a day or night of there lives and as I said she has been away for more than 2 months (not counting 2 X per week returning home after 12am) so if we shared custody, to me it would feel like she is getting exactly what she wants and I am being punished by not seeying my boys and caring for them every day.   I have mentioned to her that I want the boys during the weekdays so I can be sure they get a stable schooling environment and she can have them on the weekends, she denied and said she wants them 50% - again, why should I give them up 50% ?
20090222204113AAF9L1T	Family & Relationships;Family	Parents feeling left out?	when I was going through the crappiest time of my life, my parents were always there. My life has always been evolving around them. Now that I'm actually thinking for myself and about myself, they have started to say really degrading things to me and harassing me. My life doesnt evolve around them anymore and I'm growing up. Right when Life is getting better for me, they do and say these negative things that bring me down. They also dont want to give me space, I'm not a teen anymore.  Do you think that maybe they feel left out? They feel as if They're not as important as they were before? What should I do?
20090222202646AAiCbKV	Family & Relationships;Friends	How can I apologize to him?	I had a really great friend, and I messed up the friendship because I got into a pretty brutal verbal fight with his girlfriend. We never got along, but I guess eventually it was just a breaking point. Well, this friend has found every possible way to erase me from his life. And whenever I do find a way to say, "I'm sorry, and I'm not asking for forgiveness, but I need you to know that you were a great friend and I never meant to hurt anyone," he doesn't even hear me out and he finds a new way to shut me out. How can I just tell him I'm sorry when he won't allow himself to hear a word I say? Not to mention, it's his birthday. I just wanna let him know that I haven't forgotten.      The fight was also the day after my grandmother died, so I said a lot of things I shouldn't have said. I've already attempted apologizing to his girlfriend, but that didn't go over well. We're two completely different people.

In particular, with my one of my guy friends. I JUST WANT TO BE FRIENDS! But this one friend, he's super nice to my face, but the thing is, I don't think he really likes me. I'll talk to him a whole bunch when we're face to face, and he'll talk to me and we both seem pretty happy and all, but when I text him to ask him something he doesn't respond- only occasionally. Is that a bad thing? I mean, he's not the most responsible guy in the world, so should I worry that he hates me?

20090222202806AAJVxvX	Family & Relationships;Marriage & Divorce	Perfect gift for wife?	Most people complain about their spouses, but I have nothing but good things to say about mine. I recently bought her a "queen for a day" spa where she spent 6 hours being pampered, but that was a friend's idea, not mine. I am not very good with gift idea. The two best things I know how to do is work and play with my 2 kids. I feel that my love for her has grown over the years (12 years). She is not only my wife, but also my best friend. I enjoy doing things with her and spending time together. Whether it is going on a vacation or simply being in the kitchen and cooking together.  The time spent with her is never dull. We joke around together all the time; we push each others buttons jokingly and tease each other constantly. Being around her, I feel like a kid again because we are always playing around. When it comes to sex, I have no complaints there either, after 12 years the fire is still burning hot. To be married is a wonderful thing -- and to be perfectly matched is to have accomplished the greatest and most challenging thing any of us will do in a lifetime. I don't want to ask the same friend again for another idea which is why I am here. Now, what can I get this wonderful woman who is one of the best wives that has ever roamed the face of the earth?

Her best friend (lets call her Sopia) was sitting beside her and saw that i saw her doing that and is like "don't say anything." then all of our group of friends saw her doing that and they were pretty much brushed it off.

20090222202940AAKEigV	Family & Relationships;Friends	How can I confront my friend about the way he treats me?	One of my closest friends happens to be my ex from a while back.  I noticed he has a tenancy to be kinder to me when he's single, and more reserved (and even ruder) when he's dating someone.  For example, when he's single his voice is softer and more perky, he'll come to visit me at work, and he stays firm with every planned meeting to social events.  When he's in a relationship, he acts snappy on the phone, makes up excuses about not wanting to do causal stuff together (I've caught him in a lie about being 'sick' and saw him with his girlfriend at a movie), and goes weeks without any contact at all.    I'm not jealous of his girlfriends, and I support him all the way, but like any friend, I get confused and bothered when he treats me this way.  Is this just a guy thing?  We haven't been together in several years.

When i was younger i was raped, through sexual abuse, which lasted for a number of months. Me and my partner have a brilliant sex life, but i can only have sex when im in control. If he goes on top or we try anything where im not in control i just freak out. i think this is to do with my past. should me and my partner work on him being in control, by having gentle sex with him on top to work on my fear, or should i see a specialist/counselor?       I'm 18 and the abuse happened when i was 11 by a man of 45. this was obviously a very traumatic time for me, and ive found it very difficult to get close to men. my current partner knows and understands this and is willing to do anything to help me.       any answer or suggestion would be helpful.    thank you.

20090222203759AAjZGlQ	Family & Relationships;Weddings	Engaged and confused?	We got engaged in November of last year, and then everything seemed perfect and we have been together for 5 years. We, like most couples, have had our arguments and have never really broken up. Now i'm starting to think that the planning and everything is making things worse, we are fighting more now about the cost and costs of certain things...for example the dress. i wanted to get this specific dress today but he said i should wait and shop around, because i have a year and 8 months until the wedding. But i know the dress I want, so why wait? It was a trunk show and i wanted to get the dress for 15% off, but now its over and he said that over 1000 would be too much to spend. WITH the discount and tax it came out to 1200. He thinks i should shop around but i don't want to go through the hassle of haggling just for nothing.    My question is, why do you think its harder on your relationship once you are engaged is it just the wedding pressure? Or will this set the basis for the actual marriage?
20090222205134AAyC8nD	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	I have 2 girlfriends. IDK what 1 to keep! Please help!?	Ok, so I have a new girlfriend I met online and she was the love of my life. She is sweet and caring. But there is a problem, I have another one. I forgot that she chatted with me last week and she is pissed off because she wants me so bad. So wants to kill herself if I dont comply with her demands.       She seems okay, but you can see there is a problem here. She lives in North Dakota. I live in Massachusetts. We are both 17, but my other girlfriend in Maine is also 17.       Both of them have their share of problems, so I don't know what one to keep. I want to keep one of them but my heart is not in the flow. I cant follow my heart because IDK where it is right now. I think its with my girlfriend in Maine. She lives closer and she, well, makes me feel "happy."      Any suggestions from those with past experiences?      Both of them are from online. The one in North Dakota wasnt even in my life. Shes like yea..um..u and i r going out right. Ima like i dont think so i got a gf already. Shes like u dont remember me. I was ur gf first.       To be honest I think she is lying and only wants me because she is stressed and desperate.      This was also the first time I had a girlfriend ever in my life and I might have ****** it up.      I think sum of u r right. Maybe I should get rid of them. They say theyll kill themselves, but theyll be aiight.       All the girls around here are stuck up and ****. I dont' want 2 do that.
20090222210145AAqYgPL	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Not sure the best way to handle this?	There is this woman who I have started to date whom I met at the health club I work at. We are hitting it off really well and it's mutual attraction both physically and mentally we have great conversation etc.      My concern is now that I am dating her I feel differently when I see guys at work checking her out not just looking but really LOOKING and commenting to each other (I'm a guy I know how we think) I know what they want.   I thought about just walking up to her and slipping in an audible comment about our relationship so the guys would just see that she is off the market but that's not really how I operate, I'm not a jealous person but I really like this girl and feel like she is being disrespected.      Should I confront the guys or should I just only step in if something starts to get out of hand?

20090222211941AASQNpy	Family & Relationships;Marriage & Divorce	Is forgiveness easy for you? (parable)?	Two friends were walking through the desert. During some point of the journey, they had an argument; and one friend slapped the other one in the face.       the one who got slapped was hurt, but without saying anything, wrote in the sand , today my best friend slapped me in the face.      They kept on walking, until they found an oasis, where they decided to take a bath .       The one who had been slapped got stuck in the mire and started drowning, but the friend saved him.       After he recovered from the near drowning, he wrote on a stone: "today my best friend saved my life"       The friend who had slapped and saved his best friend asked him, "after i hurt you, you wrote in the sand and now, you write on a stone, why?"       The friend replied "when someone hurts us we should write it down in sand, where winds of forgiveness can erase it away.       But, when someone does something good for us, we must engrave it in stone where no wind can ever erase it"       Learn to write your hurts in the sand and to carve your benefits in stone.       They say it takes a minute to find a special person, an hour to appreciate them, a day to love them, but then, an entire life to forget them.

20090222205202AA2G9rY	Family & Relationships;Family	Do you ever feel like your parents are INSANE?	My mom's complaining and trying to explain to me fro 20 minutes why she felt hurt because I walked into the room and told her that I was going to need someone to help set up wireless internet for my computer. (Her job dealt with computers.) Anyway, she was so offened that I wouldn't ask her for help outright. I mean my god, all she had to say was, "Well, you know who to ask?" or something funny like that.      I am I wrong? Is she just really sensitive and this is one of those I-love-you-but-you-are-insane moments? Or am I like majorly insensitive for not asking for her help?

20090222211615AAJ0tMo	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Do you think he will ever love anyone, or is he too jaded?	My friend who I love (we were involved a couple of years ago but he got really depressed and felt guilty so I was there as his friend because he honestly couldn't handle a relationship), seems to be pretty jaded.  He's had about 3 or 4 serious relationships which ended with "getting his heart ripped out".  So whenever there's a romantic movie on TV he changes the channel.  He's never told me he loves me to my face, he said it on the phone one night though, and left a message on my mobile when I was out of town telling me about his night and said "love you" at the end.  I've never said it to him, I have to stop myself sometimes because I get so overwhelmed by this feeling I have for him.  Do you think he's afraid to love because of getting hurt before, or maybe he just doesn't love me?
20090222211032AAxdnWy	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	How do you ever truly know yourself?	I've come to the conclusion that the reason I don't have many close friends nor ever been in a relationship at 21, is because of my inability to love myself. Part of the reason I can't love myself is because I haven't figured out who I am yet. For instance, I'm studying economics and business in college, but I know deep down, that these aren't my true passions. Basically I haven't found what I want out of life. I then tell myself that life has no meaning anyway, so nothing really matters.   Anyway, I realize that I do have some good traits...like I can be extremely funny at times and I'm easy to talk to. I then start thinking that maybe I am a decent person, just trying to find my way in life like everyone else and that I shouldn't be so hard on myself. But when it comes down to it, I don't know who I am or what I would like to be...so how can I truly love myself? Maybe I should just love that I'm trying to find myself..?

Okay, so I'm really nervous because these former classmates have been the ones that I disliked so much when I moved to the Philippines. I was in this Christian school and I had NO FRIENDS. Like ZERO. I wasn't very interested in them and I didn't want to turn into them back in the 6th grade.. I was having a hard time from the move half way across the world and basically I'm pretty sure I was a freak to them. Anywho, years have passed. I've gotten over the move, things got a lot better but still haven't talked to them much in so long. I'm finishing the 9th grade right now. Today they're inviting me to hang out with their whole class whom they are still classmates with because I changed school and well.. I tried to ask my friend to come along but she isn't willing to help me at all. And well I don't want to be out of place considering I didn't make much friends with them. So should I go? I'm really shy and scared on how to deal and stuff.. and well, I am close with like 2 or 3 people out of all like.. 18 but I'm still pretty shy.      Can someone please give me advice. Should I go? I feel like somehow this will overcome my shyness and I feel a bit pissed that my friend wont come along with me, so I don't know.      Sorry if this was long.

20090222213853AAzQL3P	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Any way to get over guilt?	I, on two separate occasions, slept with a man I knew was taken (the same man, the first time he was engaged, the second time he was just married).  It was my ex-boyfriend, and it happened last year.  I know it was 100% wrong, and I won't bother trying to excuse myself.  I feel absolutley horrible about it, and am certain it is the reason for my recent bad dating karma.      And on top of that, I was sort of involved with someone else.  I say sort of because he decided very early on that he didn't want anything serious/be exclusive.  So while I know I didn't technically cheat on him, I again feel horrible.      All of this guilt, combined with lowered confidence, has stopped me from dating completely.  I've come to the conclusion that I'm not good enough for anyone, and should be alone.  But I don't always want to feel this way.  Is there any way of getting over this wretched guilt?

It seems like a lot of the time if a guy asks what women want in a man, women usually say a bunch of personality traits and say looks don't matter so much. Guys tend to list physical traits, but sometimes some personality traits as well.       Do you think this is a correct representation of what guys/girls look for in their "mates?"

20090222213454AAiMLjw	Family & Relationships;Other - Family & Relationships	Im so confused!! Does he genuinely like me or is he just trying to get in my pants?	There is this guy who I know through a friend and we partied together a couple of times. The first time, we didnt really talk much and I was into his friend and we ended up kissing. But he is a player so I think I will leave it at that. I started flirting with the other guy and my friend told him that I was into him. He said that he sounded excited and said that he should do something about that. The next time we partied together, he started talking to me more and kept putting his arm around me the whole night. HOWEVER, I saw him kissing one of his friends who was really drunk but I dont think they did anything else. I asked him about what he was looking for and he said he is keeping his eyes open for the right person. I said I was too and we had this "moment" when he said "you just never know..." and looked deep into my eyes. I ended up falling asleep in his lap while he was watching a movie and he kept stroking my head. He then went to sleep and covered me with a blanket. I havent talked to him since and I want to know if he like me or if he is just trying to get into my pants, like his friend. But Im a little unsure because he didnt ask for my number or give me his, even though we were talking the whole night. How should I go about this?

20090222205150AAS8pDu	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Is this a sign of love?	I'm not quite sure if this is love or if it's something else. I've known this guy for about three years now. About a year ago we used to dated on and off. We stopped talking for about 4 months but now we're talking again. He has a girlfriend, but always calls me when he has problems with her, and then I give him advice on how he should make his girlfriend happy...but idk.  I think I still like him...but differently than other guys. He's the only guy I feel extremely comfortable around & whenever i'm upset I always confide in him. He has alot of flaws but I seem to look past them and like him for the way he is...   Out of all the guys i've dated he's left the biggest impact in my mind.

20090222211352AAcXDgM	Family & Relationships;Friends	Did or does she like me as more than a Friend or what? If not then why act like this?	My friend and I haven't been talking for a while. She and I had a falling out a few months back. In the process her BF texts me "she's my GF not yours, bla bla bla...." Then she texts me "your not my man bla bla bla".      Now I never made a pass at her or anything that could be concidered to be a pass. So why would she and her BF seem to think I was trying to be her BF?      I confronted her about it the next day and asked her why they both would think that, And told her she knows I never wanted her as a GF, much less was trying to make her my GF. she said I know and just called him an ****** and blew it off.      The next time I saw her she was totally pissed at me and wouldn't even look at me. I tried to work things out for a few weeks but she was still pissed. Finally she make the comment, that she is not mad at me, was never mad at me and she has no feelings for me good or bad. I told her i wasn't going to kiss her butt to be my friend and that was that.      That was a month ago, now she is staring at me constantly and even acted like she was actually really happy to see and talk to me when I wished her a happy VD last week.      WTF???? Im confused, she's my friend, then she hates me, then has no feelings for me and now she likes me again?      Any Ideas what is going on here? Because I don't!

They tell me we're so cute together and one of my friends says that he gets the cutest smile when he talks to me and he never gets that smile on unless he's really, really happy.

There's a girl that ive been friends with for quite a while and ive had a crush on her since we met. she and i are really good friends and she considers me to be her best friend. Personally i didn't believe in best friends cause people will always let you down in the end. (but that's neither here nor there) ANYWAYS...the guy shes with now is a DICK! (but hes also one of my good friends. ive known him since freshman year in school. before i knew her)  for as long as they've been together ive hated the sight of them being together. i used to feel like i would be a way better match for her. i love her to death and want her to be happy. she cries to me all the time about how he hurts her and lies to her and i wish she was with me because i would never do that to her. now im finding out that they were seeing each other longer than i knew. is it jealousy??? is it that shes a great girl and i think shes wasted on him and should be with me? she tells me every detail about she and him and i smile and laugh but i cringe inside. i cant tell her how i feel because it would ruin our friendship which i really treasure. i hate feeling the way i do and i NEED to get over the fact that she loves him and not me. all i can think of is avoiding her completely but that's not fair to her. How do i get over my crush and keep our BFF status intact!?

20090222204519AARwamT	Family & Relationships;Other - Family & Relationships	Will she forget about me (details inside)?	Ive been dating this girl for a couple months now. I really like her and she says she really likes me, that she likes how things are going with me, and that she's lucky I didnt give up on her when I could have (ive liked her for awhile). Coming off a romantic valentines day evening at the beach we have been less communicative this week. It made me kind of come off as needy, but she said she didnt get sick of me but she has just been really busy. I decided to back off and give her space and haven't spoken to her in 2 days now. I'm afraid she'll forget about me or something, but dont want to be clingy.      Do you think she's just been busy like she says? Am I at risk of her forgetting about me and how I make her feel? Its like I want to give her space, but I'm paranoid that I'm doing damage to what we have going (which seemed really good). What should I do?

Well heres the story:      I start talkin to this girl in class last semester and all that and i hang out with her one night and we both have a good time.  Unfortunatley this is the last night i was able to see her before the vacation.  So she says we should hang out after the vacation and all that.  So i get her number, text bac and fourth for about a week then i stop hearing from her all together.  So I dont hear from her all vacation. Then classes start up again and she happens to be in 4 of my classes but she doesnt make eye contact, didnt sit near me the first day( i was there first), and makes it like she doesnt know me.  Im all like wtf...she even walked right past me a few times....i was like what the hell did i do?  I didnt do anything wrong at all.        So anyway this girls just got me all up in arms.  I dont know if i want to talk her or not.  Im like fcuk it, she should make some attempt too, its not like i havent been approachable unlike her.  I think i made an attempt to approach her once.  i even asked her something stupid just to talk before class one day when it was just me, her and her friend...and she basically one word answered me and started talking to her friend....      so my thing is, whats up with her?  Do you think I should approach her or would i be a complete tool box if i did?  Its pretty clear she doesnt want to talk but i dont get what would change her mind...she went from wanting to chill after the vacation to not even talking to me...         thoughts....

20090222211251AAub1UA	Family & Relationships;Other - Family & Relationships	What should I do? To trust or not to trust.. :(?	I want to throw my boyfriend a surprise birthday party and I want to invite all our friends. His 2 best friends are girls though and I used to be the really jealous type and trust me i've gotten way better. I even want to invite them and choose to trust them but my MOM gives me a dissapproving "years have told me... they'll take him away and he'll leave u for one of them" looks and talk. Now I have doubts.. She's always right but I feel like a jerk not trusting him and them. He's earned my trust by now. It's like she's trying to make me like her and almost happened but I fight to be myself and not turn into a jealous woman like her. What do you all think/suggest? I don't want to turn into her. Oh and i've never met his friends btw. He hasn't seen them in months either but they love eachother like bro and sis and he misses them which is why I think it would be a nice surprise to invite them. I just want him to be the happiest he's been in a long time that day.

My mom said she wanted a better life for me so she found a man over an internet dating site and we moved here to the US and got married. Now I have a little sister and a little brother but they are just my half siblings. I always wonder about my dad and if maybe he would change his mind if he met me. Its not like I want my parents back together or anything, I just want to know my dad. I know its a long shot and I know that things might not go how I want them to, but I don't want to spend my whole life wondering what could have happened if I did contact him.             So please give me some ideas. I only know his first name is Alexander. My mom's side of the family all lives in Russia so I might be able to ask my grandma about my dad but how should I go about it because I only remember a little Russian. I talk to her quite often so I guess I could ask her to tell me about him the next time she visits us. Because she does speak some English. So any hints, and pointers? I just really need to at least see a picture of him of find out his last name. How do I ask my mom about this without anything getting awkward or anything??? Thanks Guys!!!!!!!!!!! :)

20090222214225AAsYlSe	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Should i tell him how i feel?	i've liked the same guy since i met him 4 years ago.  he's a friend of my brothers (they went to the same college + played soccer together).  4 years ago my brother asked him if he liked me and if he'd date me:  the guy said he liked me, but didn't wanna risk their friendship if a relationship between he and i didn't work out.   he and i are PERFECT for eachother:  same passions, same interests, similar personality.. and oddly enough, same bad luck with love.   now it's 4 years later, and although they are still friendly, he and my brother don't really talk or hangout anymore.  I talk to him more than my brother does.  i haven't mentioned to him my feelings since my brother talked to him about it 4 years ago.. i'm 100% sure, but i think he might still have feelings for me too-- there's just that vibe in the air. should i tell him how i feel!??   if so, what's the best way to do so??

20090222212007AAfI3Im	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Confused about girlfriend?	I have been with my girlfriend for 6 - 7 months now.  We always talk on myspace and such and have gone out on quite a few date.  I finally wanted to do more then just kiss and such and told her this 'What I'm trying to say is I want you I want us I love you I wanna be with you I want a more with you... I don't know how else to say this but I honeslty can't imagine myself with anyone else but you and a huge reason is because I don't want to be with anyone else but you... I'm ready to take this to the next level but I'll wait for you as long as you want but understand there will always be that anticipation'  and now she is ignoring me acting as if sex is all i ever wanted and I dont know what to do ive been with her so long and I love her  but she has always had trust issues rarely ever wants to spend time with me and the recent event sent her out on a self righteous rant about how she is proud about herself for being who she is and that i shouldnt try to change her and  i dont remember asking to change her in that message but I just dont know.  My question really is what do I do should i just try to ride this out or should i really start thinking why she never wants to spend time or even commit in a way like that to the relationship.  I love her but even a guy can be abused enough to wonder what to do when after so long spilling out my heart causes her to recoil in fear and hatred.

I've gotten plenty of advice here about what to do about my husband with PTSD.  You can look at my old questions if you are truely interested.      I just want to know if there is a program out there for a spouse who needs to leave a PTSD soldier.  I love him but I hate it here.  I have no life.  His anger is not to be desired.  We are both in counseling, well, I just started last week so no progress yet.  But really, I am a stay at home mom, and I have been looking for a job for over a year but nothing.  How can I afford to leave unless the army can do it.  I have searched their sites but havent found anything about help for spouses except for counseling and support groups.  I don t need that from them, I need benefits for putting me in this position to begin with.
20090222213314AAKFgdV	Family & Relationships;Marriage & Divorce	Guys I need your advise how to console my husband and myself i guess..?	My husband has been working in a real state company and considering the ecomic issues that we are facing in today he is so much stress that one day or the other he might loose his job and yes i admit that loosing his job will not really be an option for us as we are living in a country which needs to have a descent job to retain your residency.. considering the visa of the entire family.  Everyday he felt like a hell going to his job as aside from the pressure we handles with the economic problems, his boss is really too much and the way he does things are very inconsiderate.  My husband feels that he is not being treated well, when he answer back and reason out the boss does not accept his answer, instead of being motivated he felt emotional and mental torture with the boss.  Actually the boss already had that reputation among the colleagues  that he is like that.  The boss even kick one of his colleague as he has a very good connection with all the directors and HR managers.. you know kind of who you know thing..   He is just new in the company and not even six months and I felt  so sorry for what he is feeling right now and for where he is right now, If only I could go and kick the *** of his boss just for once to get even with how he mistreat not only my husband but his other subordibnate as well, I swear I'll do but I cant of course, its just one of my day dreaming to comfort myself.        I dont really know now what to say to my husband anymore without even sounding like a nagger or letting him feel less like a man.. I want to support him but I just dont know how to do it the right way.  Everytime he goes home and tells story of how he is again  mistreated by his boss, Im bursting out anger not with my husband but the racism that is there, but still I end up saying to him to calm down and just let God decide for his fate as we can no longer change who he is but either we  live with it or to get out of it.. "       Please help me.. thanks.

Well in december our attorney was asked by his just hired attorney to give him one of our trucks, of course it had to be mine, but since the default is still in the courts hand is it possible to get the truck back? the default ends in April, and they havent tried to make an agreement with us, such as dividing property items. i can tell the whole story of the divorce but MY GAWD it would take forever. i have been through so much of it i have gotten myself into problems, im only 17..

20090222213858AAxtN34	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Am I extremely short for a guy?	Hi,      I'm an asian indian, and I think I've just about stopped growing, and unfortunately, I'm pretty short, since I've around 5 foot 6 in the evening (so probably 5 foot 6.5, max 5 foot 7 in the morning/afternoon). Is this extremely short for a guy? I'm trying to stretch and eat well so that I can grow maybe to legit 5 foot 7, maybe 5 foot 8 if I'm extremely lucky, but how bad is my height as is?       I don't really care about my height except in terms of relationships, since it seems like even short girls all want a guy who is 5 foot 10 or above these days. In fact, I wouldn't even mind dating a girl taller than me. So I guess if possible, can you answer this in terms of dating? Also, if my height is kind of lacking, how can I make up for it (i.e. should I lift weights and get more muscle, get slimmer so I appear taller, etc.)?       It kind of annoys me because I think I'm a good guy overall since I'm ambitious, intelligent, and polite (sorry, I don't mean to sound cocky, but that's how people would describe me probably), so how important is height to most girls?

When he got his durango, she got a van.  When w got a flatscreen TV, she bought one bigger.  She even copies the purses that I buy... but the ones she gets is fake (you can tell between the real and fake ones). She thought she was doing me a favor buying me a purse (that looks real) for Christmas.  I am working hard right now trying to loose weight -  eating well and workout 5 days a week.. Now, I hear she wants to do bariatric surgery! When you go into her trailer, I can see where she tries to copy what's in my house.  This is frustrating. I would really like to talk to her about it but everyone in the family says I shouldn't because it will make her blood pressure sky rocket and put her back in the hospital. It's not my fault she doesn't take care of herself!  So.... this is REALLY bothering me. What should i do?
20090222214257AA1tubE	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	I feel like my gf isn't smart enough for me, is this bad, or am I just wrong??r=1235367188?	I don't want to sound cocky or overconfident, but I do feel that I am very intelligent and know all sorts of things from random events, to history, geography, religion, a little bit of everything. I've definitely met some smarter people in my life, but not many. Right now I'm in a relationship with a 23yr old woman, I'm 22, and somehow I feel like the only thing wrong with her is that shes not smart enough. It's not like shes dumb, but just doesn't know that much about many things, even though she speaks 5 languages, and I only speak 2. Everything else is great: sex, shes beautiful, caring, loving, but I'm just concerned that in the long run she wont be smart enough for me. I'm thinking about proposing to her soon, but sometimes when we talk and she wont know certain things, or how to pronounce some things, or explain her thoughts, and it somewhat irritates me and makes me wonder whether I'd be making a mistake by marrying her or not. Some serious advice would be appreciated...

20090222215015AAoslxM	Family & Relationships;Friends	Did she do it on purpose?	First let me ask you. How often do you send a text message to the wrong person by an honest mistake.      This girl, who use to be a really close friend and I asked her out last week texted me today. To clarify the story. We got into a huge fight. A fight where were "done" with each other and never speaking to eachother. I know she cannot hold a grudge long, and she knows I can never be mad at her. I will admit to myself, that that is true, that I can't be mad at her and that I am just very aggravated and disapointed with her. Anyways, it's been 4 whole days that went by without texting eachother. And tonight I get a picture message from her. A pic of herself actually which she always use to send me pics of her. Almost immediately, she sends me a text saying that message wasnt meant to be sent to me.      I think she did intentonaly sent it to me because it does take a few seconds to send a pic message, and should could of easily cancelled it during that time. And then she sends a standard text right away saying it wasnt for me. If she honestly didnt know it was sent to me. It would of took her longer than a second to realize that she sent it to me.

20090222215148AADRsZG	Family & Relationships;Marriage & Divorce	Serious answers please. I really am stuck PLEASE?	This is the story. My husband and I have been together since I was a preteen. I am now in my twenties(early 20's). In those beginning years up to about I was 18 we had a best friend. He was mainly my best friend. Lately, I have been stuck on wondering what would have happend between me and the best friend had I notbeen with my husband. My husband is an amazing guy, and I honestly don't believe there is a better man out there. He's never done anything to hurt me at all. When Im upset or anything he's always there. I want to be good for him, and I want to be the wife he deserves, but I just can't help but wonder and sometimes I go see the guy (nothing ever happens, and my husband knows. He just trust me.) The guy knows how I feel and he feels the same way. I feel so guilty because my husband is such a good guy, and I would die if I ever lost him. I'm just so stuck because I told the guy I had to stop talking to him because I couldnt do this to my husband,and then I missed him for weeks and weeks till I finally gave in and started talking to him again. Now, I want to stop talking to him, but his father wasjust in a horrible incident, and I dont want him to feel alone. I'm just so confused. Also, the best friend doesn't compare to my husabdn in no way. I just can't leave him alone, and I don't know why. Please somebody help me and tell me what I need to do. I have prayed to God for the strength to let him go, and I know it may take time, but the guilt is overwhelming and Im just so lost. Please help

He seems to ignore me a lot and a lot of women say guys do that. I really can't stand it. Help! What is the purpose for being marriage, are thing I am starting to thing about.

20090222215950AAfZ3Ud	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	How do i get to know him?	i'm a sophomore in high school, and there's this guy that i think is cute, who's a junior at a neighboring high school in the same city. i saw him at a tennis game against my school and his. i haven't even talked to him, just saw him and i thought he was cute. as i found out more about him, he's best friends with this acquaintance i have from my history class, and friends with my 2 closest friend's boyfriends. unfortunately, my acquaintance is a bit annoying and can get up in your a$^ about things, and i'm not close with any of my friend's boyfriends.       the worst part is that he recently broke up with a girlfriend he's been going out with since his freshman year. he asked this girl that i don't like to the prom, and they seem to like each other. i've lost a lot of guys that i liked to this girl (but that's not the only reason why i hate her).       how should i get to know him? one of my closest friends say to just talk to him on facebook - that is, add him. we have aprox. 36 mutual friends, "so that's okay", she says. i still really want to meet him, and although i only know him by face, i'd like to get to know him as a person. what do i do?

20090222222137AA9NHFi	Family & Relationships;Other - Family & Relationships	Your thoughts on complicated situation?	It's such a complicated situation - we (me & Anthony) were together then his life started to fall apart, and he got really depressed so we're just "friends" (it was too much for him to deal with a girlfriend, trying to make me happy when he wanted to kill himself) but he says he is loyal to me. We spend most of our free time together. He said that we're friends and we should do whatever makes us happy - but if he knew I sometimes spend time with a male friend (whom he perceives as a "threat" but I've never had any physical contact or anything with this friend) he would be shattered. As it was, when that male friend came to my house, Anthony was really upset because this friend had met my parents at that visit (not planned, they just happened to be there). I went to see Anthony after wards and he was sitting in his backyard in the cold crying and saying "You've killed me", and grilling me about me spending time with my friend. Help me figure this out? I think he's happy to be "friends" but I think he'd be really unhappy and upset if I moved on. Thoughts?

This girl, who used to be my best friend years ago decided she would try and ruin my life. So she turned all my friends against me except for my best friend. My bestie was always like    "I hate that b*tch! I can't believe she did this to you."   Now they go to the same school and my bestie thinks its ok to become besties with that biatchh too and still be mine too.    At least I have my other friends back that were turned against me.   It's not the same though.   Now I'm all stressed with this freaking schoolwork.   And i think i'm about to go on a major low. Apparently, i have Cyclothymia. Which is like bi polar.   I dont know what to do. Everything is spinning around in my head and i just can pin anything down.    I have all these assignments due soon.      Help me please :(

I hella want to buy a blow up doll that has realizim. I was looking at some web sites that have some but they cost alot I think the one that cost the most was like $2oo. well I was thinking if I had a girlfriend I could keep and talk to it would be great. And you know what I would love to take that blow up doll out to the movies. I would even pay for two tickets. You think I'm going crazy? Well I think its normal cause if I have her (blow up doll) I would feel great I would talk to it everyday and me and her would build a realtionship. And hey I could even buy some fake friends I could just by a bunch of barbies and those barbies can be my girlfriends friends and I could buy some GI joes and those guys can be my friends and best budds. Well I think about it and I would have friends and a wonderful girlfriend. I was looking at a blow up doll that looks like a real girl my age. Is this normal?

I had a crush on this girl and after we got older at 18 i asked her out, so we were partners for about 2 years until she left the country for studying abroad. i waited another year then i went after her, i knew she was kind of cheating on me, after 1 month we broke up and i didn't hear from her until a few days ago that she called me and was nice too me, i was shocked so i couldn't control myself and she probably realized how excited i was on the phone, but after a couple of days and a few phone calls from her she stoped calling me and i think she still does'nt want me in her life and she maybe just called to see how i was doing.   but I am feeling like I don't want to live anymore.   it was so hard to get over her love and i was trying to get back to life for the past 3 years that we had broken up.   But now the only thing I think about is her and I want to get her back if there is a way...

20070228172039AAaAOTM	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	What should i do?	i had this band were my girlfriend played drums I played guitar and this guy Jesse played guitar. we were playing for about 6 months and had a decent amount of material. and suddenly Jesse doesn’t start showing up to band practices which sucks because it hold up the band. he is also an weekend alcoholic. he’s an amazing guitarist and drummer and a damn good screamer but he is just not commited enough at least that’s what it seemed like.      we were planning on getting a house together in Pittsburg after he got all his dui fines paid off. but then he doesn’t show up for band practice and turns his phone off all the time. he then sends a message on myspace saying that he doesn’t want to move to pa and that he basically wants to just rots’ in Winchester Virginia(a small town were nothing happens)and quit the band.      this seems reasonable in way considering we were moving into a apartment(my girlfriend and i) and we had no were to practice. so now we are official on bad terms with Jesse which sucks that he has made this decision. and he is just always lying.      2 weeks go by and we just finished moving into the apartment and getting the internet hooked back up. jesse sends a message to my girlfriend and here is were things get interesting. the first line says "the truth is i want you" and then it goes on and on about why he cant tolerate being in the band anymore because he wants my girlfriend so bad.         Everything now makes so much more since and a lot of things are explained now. Now the thing is now is that i don’t know how to react. should i be mad and want to blow up and smash his face in or should i just not even worry about it at all. it just seems to me that it is kind of disrespectful you just don’t say that about your friends girlfriend while you are currently going out. but then again it kinda seems like he was being respectful by just leaving the situation and not making any moves. What should I do? It just really ******* sucks that he had to go and have a crush on my girlfriend and ruin the band

Hace todavia unas 2 decadas las oficinas privadas y de gobierno estaban llenas de escritorios con maquinas de escribir y poco despues con computadoras pero quiernes invariablemente estaban detras de tales escritorios eran las secretarias juanita o cualquier otro nombre en diminutivo.   En cambio hoy en dia pasa lo mismo las oficinas privadas y de gobierno siguen llenas de escritorios con computadoras pero ahora quienes estan detras de los escritorios son licenciadas en algo (casi siempre en administracion, psicologia, contaduria, mercadotecnia, etc).  Es como que si  las mujeres decidieron ya no estudiar para secretaria de nivel tecnico pero ahora estudian para trabajos de secretaria a nivel universitario. Acaso las actuales licenciadas hacen lo que antes hacian las secretarias como contestar telefonos, recepcionistas, mecanografas, sacar fotocopias etc?

Last time when taking in a frienly and tolerant way with a asian-american woman (probably she was chinese but how to know??), she started taking about her husband even when it was out of context.

I have been through disappointing relationships through out my life. I've had a boufriend get another woman pregnant on me, abusive physically & mentally, and I had someone living a double life. I am a good woman and I just feel like giving up on men all together because they just dont seem to respect women or even care about their children if they get you pregnant. Why? Why are so many men so doggish? How do you heal and learn how to love again. I'm tired of the let downs and the shock of finding out the guy isnt what you thought he was. I'm not a magnet for this because a lot of women I know go through the same thing. Guys ask me out all the time & I dont even get excited any more to get to know anyone new because I feel like in the long run he'll be some male chauvinist bastard too. I love men dont get me wrong, but I just dont feel like I'm going to meet anybody decent & worthy of my love & admiration...

We have spoken on a few occasions (by few I really mean a few). She is the most amazing woman I have ever seen and she may just have some idea that I like her (after an email I sent her indicating "hope to see you again soon"). It was a friendly email and not a come on It also included my phone number (almost as a signature piece). The last time we spoke was nice but brief, in which time I found out she was seeing someone. This was just over 3 months ago. I haven't made any contact with her since, however I am still head over heels for her.       I need to know whether she is still with this guy, but I can't just ask her in an email. But I need to make some kind of contact, even if it is just to show that I still remember her. Ideally to find out if she is single. All I have is her email address. That's it.       I am in dire straits and need some super advice. HELP.      RonR.

After that happened we went back to arguing all the time. Does this guy like me or does he really hate me and happened to use me once?

20090222215751AA0wNIy	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	What else can I do to drive her crazy????	My girlfriend and I have been dating about 3 months, and we started getting kinda serious about 2 weeks ago. And this weekend we went to the movies and afterwards we parked and got in the back and started making out.       I fingered her and after awhile, she leaned back and I lifted up her shirt and yea.... She seemed like she liked it quite a bit, and after awhile, i started fingering while doing tht and I think I made her *** because she told me 'right there' and i sped up and after awhile she told me to stop and she was moaning so yeaa.      We did tht for like 2 hours, and then I drove her home. Im pretty sure she'd be willing to reciprocate but i dont know how exactly to ask her to.        I really care about her alot, and I respect her, and I honestly think I love her, and we both said it 2 weeks ago. And I want her to have fun, without going to far or making her feel uncomfortable.  Were both virgins and we both agreed on waiting for quite awhile, so anything besides that is open for thought.      We were joking around and she mentioned something about me biting her, and after apologizing, i said something about 'You could push me farther, if you'd like' and she wasnt expecting it and said she'd have to think about it. <- she kinda pushed me to her chest, and yea, said farther as in yea.       She told me I left an enormous hickey on her boob, and we were joking about it, and i bit her nipple on accident[i have braces] :\ lol, and she told me she liked everything but tht part so ill just have to remember tht.       And about the head issue.... im self conscious.. Im kinda bigger so i dont look as big as I actually am. I am around 5.4-5 inches and around 4.5 around.  But when I push down all the way im about 6' so idk... is this bad???          and a small question for the girls...?      - Any particular reason that she doesn't let me pull her underwear down when Im fingering her? It's kinda difficult for me to get a good angle sometimes. Im not pressuring her into letting me, im just asking about it.

I've liked him from the day I met him and everyone around me says we flirt a lot.... He seems like a great guy and I dont want to lose the opportunity because I cant figure out if he's single!!! I don't know any of his friends, and all co-workers are older and a little stricter on work relationships, so they're out of the question... any advice is helpful. THANKS!!

So how do you know when its really over? how do you know that the love is really gone, or if your just going through a rough spot?  When do you put your foot down and say i have had enough im leaving?   how do you leave when you still have so many ties: ie: lease on a house, dog and still feel for the person...somewhat?

20090222220210AAwu2YU	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Shy girls, what would you be thinking in this situation?	So there's this girl I like but I'm really shy around her and have barely talked to her in a few months of knowing her.  I think she's kind of shy too, so usually there's just silence between us.  Like, the other night we were sitting next to each other at dinner and there was nobody else there, but it was just awkward silence for like an hour before she left.      Does the fact that I never say anything to her and she never says anything to me mean that she doesn't like me?

I've liked him since last year, but I just found out that a girl that's nothing but selfish also likes him.

20070702131826AAH3Xid	Family & Relationships;Friends	Friendship problems...?	Okay what do you do if you have been friends with someone for four years and you have become best friends but all of a sudden she hates me.      It all started after our cancled My Chemical Romance concert because the band was sick. We also had backstage passes to go meet the band and we couldn't use them. (we won them not bought them) Then that Monday she kind of stopped talking to me unless we were at lunch. Then as it got closer to Final week we stopped talking at all.      I've been trying to talk to her and find out what's wrong by texting and calling her. But she doesn't answer my calls and she won't answer my test messages.      Anyone had this happen to them?   How did you fix it?   What did you do?
20090222220135AAJ2wku	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Why dont girls like me? and give me attention?	ok so I am a great looking guy. the best shape of my life. Im a musician. I play guitar in a band and last night we had this huge show and we rocked. Ive been playing in this band for like 6 years. we have so many songs and we have some experience. and I have wireless. and we were playing to like 200 people. I was out in the crowd on my solos playing to girls and people. I emphasize girls cause I was  doing what I do musicly but after the show no girls really came up to say hi. Im just wonderin cause all the other guys in the band atleast chilled out with a few different girls. Im really fed up cause I am myself I try hard and it doesnt seem to matter if I try or if I dont try cause it does no good. for half the night I really wasnt thinking man I want a girl. I was thinking man Im can't wait to play man this is awesome. the perfect show. our talent really shined but it came apparent to me throughout the nighjt that man no girls are coming over to me. whats up with that. I tried to blow it off and be like oh well. but it kept happening. I was all alone while all the other guys were chilling with girls. in the band I am the most in shape one. I work out Im muscular and I do lots of mountain biking and I have great hygeine. it's like a big coincidense that after this long all these girls arent worth it to me. it's like it's meant for me to feel this way. like I said I went to the show that night and I lvie everyday to enjoy what I love to do but it became apparnent that some reason no girls wanted to talk to me. Im really deppressed cause Ive been single for like a year and I really want somebody special. it's so hard to be single and to never make it anywhere or meet somebody of quality.

She is sending me yahoo messenger messages calling me names, she has called my house, called my cell phone, even sent me myspace messages telling me to quit looking at her myspace page, I cant even look at her page because it is private. I am trying to just forget about her and move on. She even sent me messages saying i was stalking her because i was gonna go to a concert she wanted to go to. Its getting very annoying and i dont know what to do. She even is blaming her email getting hacked on me, i dont even know her yahoo id. I dont know what she is going to do next. She has even threatened to bring her friends to my house to egg my car. I dont know when she has time to do this because she has a baby and a husband and she just turned 18 a month ago. I told her to leave me alone because in texas it is against the law to contact someone more than 2 times after they tell you to leave them alone, but all she said to that was you wanted it that is why your myspace page is still public. I dont want to get a restraining order because that stuff will stay on her record i think forever. What should I do?

20061129075817AAhK1sA	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	My ex-girlfriend said that I'm one of her best friends, but she doesnt think we can ever be friends again...	once she moves to Austin.  So, I asked her why...and it's because of the fact that I may jeopardize her future love interest and her relationship.  It is very disturbing to think that somoeone I was with for 5 years, and professed being in love with, is not even considering a future friendship.  I do not want any negative statements, this is something that I am very troubled with.  I dont get much sleep, my apetite is GONE, my desire to do some things have diminished.  Yeah, time will heal the wounds...but, why do I keep losing the only people that I trust !?!  I have no clue why things all go bad at the same time.  People other than myself have tons more to deal with.  I am very appreciative of what I have, but the simple thought that she has become distant, lies to me about LITTLE THINGS, doesn't help me in times of need...man, that's what hurts the most.  I have continued to help her, regardless of what it is.        So, if you have the time, please let me know a few of your thoughts.

Has anyone felt like no matter what you do, you'll never reach a major point in your life? My boyfriend and I have been discussing wanting to move out on our own, but we're both very frustrated because everything is expensive. We're both definitely old enough to be on our own, so the situation doesn't have too much to do with age. Does anyone have any advice on how I can become and remain determined to get a place of my own. I regret not saving money from past jobs I've had.

20070121223934AAuuj59	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	I love this guy....?	I think I'm in love with a good guy friend of mine. He's single, so there's no strings attached. However I honestly don't know what to do, he's said in the past that he just see's me as his friend. Now that we've been friends for over a year, I realize that I really love him. Then recently he told me he loved me, and I'm almost positive he just means as a best friend. (Even though he didn't specify) After all that's what he's said I was.       I love him unconditionally for who he truely is, and I could see us going out...but I don't think he sees the same thing. You'd think he would have told me by now if his feelings for me had changed.       I'm completely stuck, he knows I really like him...What's going on?!
20070404235012AAXZjOK	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	So What's Next???	I met this guy in one of my new classes at school today and I really want to get to know him, hang out with him, and you know see where it goes. He's cute, likes basketball like I do, and seems nice and easy to talk to...you know very chill. We exchanged numbers even and well, that was it.       Now I dunno what to do next...I just don't want to things to be the same as it has been with every other guy I've ever met. It always seems like the ones I want aren't into me and the ones I get are either creepy or complete a**holes.       I feel like he should call me, but I was the one that went and talked to him. Now what do I do???   Next class I plan to dress up real cute, but I'm really unsure if this is really how I should go about getting him. I've always been the go-get em girl. I guess you could say I don't like waiting, but I always hear the advice, "let him chase you."      Anyone got any ideas???
20070411004714AAxiaAq	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Need more ideas...?	Ok, so there's this guy in a class of mine whom I really like. I met him, have been dressing cute for class, and he seems interested. At the same time though, he seems to be hinting that he doesn't want to get too involved with any one person at this time. Even said in class once when asked by the teacher that he didn't want to get too attached to anyone and that he'd rather have a bunch of friends, rather than a soulmate.       I can't help it though...I think he's a cutie. He smiles at me, looks at me when I talk to him, he's easy to talk to...we even have penciled in plans to shoot hoops this Friday together.    I promised myself I wouldn't dooo this but...I think I'm falling for him.       I'm trying not to get too attached to him cuz' I don't know him all that well and well after college we probably wouldn't see much of eachother, but I'm admittedly getting caught up in things.      FYI, when I like someone it's clear to even strangers. Yet he's still there. N.E. ideas on keepin' him?
20070409180901AADK3Mn	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Yaaayy....Girls that wanna get a guy here's advice.?	My plan to get this guy in one of my classes went soooooo smoothly today. Thank you to all of you that gave me advice. Girls if you're looking to impress a guy just chill out. Dress up really cute, do your make up,  but be comfy and let him do the rest.    Talk to him like you would one of your just good guy friends, bat your eyelashes, and ask him to do an activity with you that even you enjoy or even to study with you.       It works, but use your own intellegence and add your own personality/flare on getting him to notice you.       All it takes is practice, practice, practice just like anything else. =) Go in with a open mind though and you be likely not to end up empty handed.       As for me, this guy and I have penciled in plans to shoot hoops this Friday. He's going "help" me with my b-ball skillz.       THANKS PEOPLE... =)
20070123132805AAk9LCb	Family & Relationships;Friends	I got my friend my old job and now she is driving me crazy.  She is so ungrateful.?	She had been looking for a job for ever and i finally pulled ajor strings, she had absolutetley no experience, and got her my old job. My boss was my mentor and now that relationship is gone.  I have spent nights and weekends training her, she is probably one of the most selfish people i have ever encountered.  Everything is about her.  She has yet to thank me for getting her the job.  I really don't think she respets the boundaries of my relationships that i have formed with the people she now works with.  It is driving me crazy.  What do you suggest i do?

Went through a time where i was trying to figure out whether I truely loved her- so I put distance between us and we didnt really meet up, talk properly.      Ever since its been rocky though. Still arguing abit.       I met up with her recently and she has told me she doesnt love me anymore. she says she just doesnt feel the same.      Im just very confused as it broke my heart. I know I once was thinking the same. She says she doesnt feel for me in that way and dont want to be together no more.      Im taken it quite hard yet I want her more than ever. losing her has made me realise what a fool Ive been.      Just wondering for some advise. She said she doesnt know if things will work out if we try again. We gone on a break for a few days so she can think things over.      I know they say give them space yet i cant get her out my head and feel like ive lost apart of me.

20070313120213AAJEpbb	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	What the f%@$ is up with my b/f?	Here's the sitch:I've been dating this guy for over a year now and we love each other very much. 1st prob, there is a 3 yr age gap between us (me being the older of the 2).  2nd prob: Almost a month ago, out of nowhere he decides to up and leave with friends and go over 300 miles away from me..to spend time with friends. No prob. Then, just this past weekend @ 3 in the AM, he calls and after greeting me, says that he thinks we should see other people. I ask why. And he says, he loves me and that he DOESN'T want to see other people but that he's not too sure we can make things work and that he thinks he's losing his freedom. Well, we patched things up and he says that he wants to try and that he loves me very much.    My questions are:   1) I think that his friend (who is jealous he has a g/f) said something to him. He never tells him that I call. What do you think?   2) Do you think that I should try to work things out with him and make the relationship work?

Recently I told my friend(and crush) that I like him. I thought that giving me his phone number and and invitation to a band performance that those were key signs that he liked me. But now our friendship hasnt been the same. We use to talk a whole bunch and had so much fun IMing back and forth. Now we barley talk at all. I call his phone and he doesnt pick up and when i IM him he says he'll be right back and when he gets back he says he has to go. I regret telling him but i dont even know if i should go to his performance this weekend.Also I invited him to a performance of my own and want to get him a ticket before there all gone. He doesnt go to my school so we barley see each other and Im very confused. What can i do to repair the relationship? Should I still go to his performance and get him a ticket to mine? Please help. Thank You so much
20070410195829AA4hISp	Family & Relationships;Friends	Is it too late for friends?	i am a HS junior, and at the begining of my sophmore year, my parents forced me to move to a school that i had always seen as being a bad school. as stubborn as i am, i rebelled against the school and pushed everyone away that had any interest in being my friend. over these 2 yrs, my social ability has plumeted to zero, and my grades have skyrocketed to straight A's. now, i'm desperate for a social life, but i know that most everyone sees me as being a nerd and that i'm someone who's a teacher's pet and stuck up. i really want to have friends now, but it's been so long that i have lost every shred of my social ability and if i change my attitude i think i will seem fake. i'm really not mean or stuck up, but i'm so quiet, reserved, and antisocial that no one wants to be my friend anymore. there are also very few other people like me. i think i may also have a social-anxiety disorder, but i'm scared to tell my parents i may need medication. Help!
20070411073850AAefyN6	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	I don't quite understand her! What do y'all think?	I am a college freshman dude, and I have had a crush on a classmate for about two months. She seems to know that I like her. Maybe girls have the instinct. Anyway, we are in the same writing class, and today our class took a field trip to one of the libraries on campus. The girl and I haven't talked for weeks, and partly it was because I've been busy. Actually we never had long conversations. Today I noticed that she looked at me from behind quite often. And when my eyes and her eyes met, she sort of looked away. A really shy person, I also looked away. I should have waved at her. I tried to talk to her after class. This is how our conversation went   me: hey, long time no talk   girl: yeah   me: what are you up to?   girl: I have an econ exam in 10 minutes   She did not try to make an eye contact and just walked away at a fast pace, and I wanted to talk to her longer, but I didn't wanna seem desperate. I can't tell if she has no interest or if she's just shy. She's honestly too good for me

20070429140457AATvq7Z	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Relationship help please!?	Ok, so I've been goin' out with this girl for 2 months now and I really like her, but I don't know what to do. She seems very uptight around me and I'm not sure why . EX: I went to her friends sweet sixteen with her and we danced and what not, but when I tried to hold her hand she would immediately move it away so I couldn't. It was more like we were friends than boyfriend and girlfriend, but then when we are around 2 or 3 of her close friends, she is much more affectionate with me. I'm not sure if its me or what, and I've tried to kiss her, but she won't take a hint that I'm about to kiss her. I kissed her on the cheek for the first time yesterday night and I didn't see a reaction, unless it all came out with her friend that was there after I left. I asked 2 of her friends for advice and one said let her go and one said stay with her, so i'm kinda lost. any help would be much appreciated.

I was very upset at first and was going to find his lady and tell her the truth. But then I stopped because I realized it wasn't my problem but theres. I'm the lucky one. I'm not married to him.

20070617122738AAOIjbu	Family & Relationships;Friends	Why am I not attracted to my guy friends but they are to me ?	I have 3 great guy friends, two in particular, who are amazing people. We get along so great and we talk on the phone all night long. All 3 of them like me, I would even say love because on numerous occasions, all of them have told me that they want to marry, want me to bear their child, how I am their soulmate, and that I should give them a chance. I find it hard to be attracted to someone who is my friend. Initially, I was attracted to them in the beginning of our friendship but I never knew they felt the same way & my feelings would leave. Then months later, they would confess that they always like me & I'm the perfect girl. When I've tried to do the whole bf/gf thing, I felt weird when they tried to kiss or touch me. People say being friends first is the best kind of relationship but how can you be attracted to someone who is your friend ? What can I do to change my thinking ? b/c I feel like I'm losing out on great guys any woman would love to have.

20070623172411AAzKDny	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	After breaking up, moved on or keep waiting?	I have just broke up with my gf of 5 years over some infidelity issues on both parties. I handled it pretty badly but am recovering now. She said that I would still be her soul mate after we have gone through so much good and bad times together. Right now, she's seeing this guy and I think they are getting together pretty soon. She says she still love me as much as last time, just that she don't have trust in our r/s for now. She didn't rule out the possibility of getting back together in future, but right now she just wanna be with this guy and we'll be best friends. So I am wondering should I moved on and start seeing other girls as well? Or should I wait for the day when she thinks she's ready to work on our r/s again? The reason holding me back to date other girls is that I am afraid that when she wanna get back to me, I'll be with another girl and that will miss out the chance to work things out with her again, cuz right now i still love her dearly and hope to be with her again.
20070624044234AAqWRGV	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Pubic Hair?  Do you like it- or not?  Guys & Gals- please answer :-)?	Hi.  I'm a guy and I like pubic hair on a woman.  Why?  I dunno- I just do.  Always have.  Just do.  A fact ;-)  I would like to know what you think :-)      Trimmed is okay, and if a gal wants to shave her underarms and legs and all that- that's just fine with me- no problem.  I like that alright- it's kool.  But the pubes- I like.  Always have, even if it's bushy but trimmed nice at the panty line.  I otherwise love pubic hair.  A woman without pubic hair... seems like less than a 'woman' to me.  I feel that it's a good sign of sexual maturity.  What... is your opinion on pubic hair?  Be honest, but please don't be rude or nasty.  Pubic hair-a good thing, or not?  You tell me.  I love it :-)  Thanx :-)   ~ Jon

Me and my boyfriend have been dating for a year now..   my mom dosen't not like him,   but she keeps saying he acts rude toward me..   in NO WAY shape or form is he.. i've tried to see it her way, many many times,  and it's just NOT true.. i've asked friends.. my pastor and everything.. i've tried really hard!   she's even said herself he's very respectful of adults and is always very thankful and nice..   the only thing i can even think of is he's very open about his opinions of people which can sometimes get mean ((just like every other person on this panet including me)), but he's never rude toward me or my friends or family and it's not like he tries to force his opinions on me or anything!   i've asked my mom for examples, and they don't make sense to me! i'm really happy with this guy, i'm in love with him i think, i want her to like him!   what's with her thinking that?

20090203124031AAzAaKy	Family & Relationships;Marriage & Divorce	Husband having trouble with responsibility, lacks common sense?	I love my husband dearly, but he has a problem handling responsibility, multitasking, using common sense etc. Is there something I, or we can do to help him learn and adjust?       Here's a bit of back round. I was raised by my father only and have been cooking dinners and doing household chores since I was 12, we were low income. I work full time as a make-up artist and part time as a Drama teacher, 6 days a week. I am 22.       My husband was raised upper middle class, did a slew of sports and activities, and had no chores growing up. In fact, his mother insists on her children not doing anything around the house so they could focus on school. He is 24 and works full time for a pest control company, also 6 days a week.       When he gets home its a nightmare getting him to help with anything, he is willing to help but after a few minutes will get distracted and somehow end up back on the couch. If I leave a list of chores he will do maybe 80% of them. He doesn't pay attention to where things go or how they work, and has a tendancy to make poor choices due to lack of common sense.       The 3 things he's supposed to handle are dishes, garbage and finances. This week he forgot to put the garbage out (despite reminders) and he won't do the dishes until 3 or 4 hours after we've eaten. As far as finances he constantly forgets to tell me whats going on, resulting in a few very avoidable over-drafts.       When we discuss it he gets upset with himself, he's very sorry and I know he's trying. It's hard because he's just learning these life skills I have had my whole life. Women in similar situations what have you done?
20081003085247AAWN8Xz	Family & Relationships;Marriage & Divorce	Do most men avoid talking about feelings?	My husband avoids talking about things that I think need to be talked out, resolved. The result is that I don't feel he understands me or himself and it's like we drift along like 2 strangers. Until something happens and then we argue. Are most men like this? What do you do about it?

20090203124205AAoFv7H	Family & Relationships;Friends	Is it ok that i'm mad at my best friend??	Ok,so my best friend is my best friend and all but sometimes she is bossy and mean.For example:Today my homeroom teacher was asking us who the protagonist and antagonist was in different movies.She asked us about Beauty and the Beast,after I said the answer I said "I have never seen Beauty and the Beast."So she (my BFF)was like "You suck"I know she's kidding when she does that,but it hurts my feelings.I try to tell her to stop calling me names and stuff but she's like,"I'm just kidding!"She is not a frenemy either.What should I do?
20090203124931AATc3mi	Family & Relationships;Friends	My friend lost her job last week and owes me $900.00 and she's worried?	she is worried about the dead line we set, for her to repay the money. She says her rent isn't fully paid , she has to pay utilities and car payment. I told her not to worry about paying me back at this time. She is a total wreck about everything. I want to forgive ger for this debt to me, but $900.000 is alot of money. She is a great person and would give me her last dime if I needed it.  She wants to get a loan to pay me back by this coming friday and I don't want her to. I told her $400.00 of the $900.000 is a gift from me and she can pay me the $500.00 when she has it. I clearly understand her issues. But she thinks I'm upset with her. What else can I do to make her understand I am not upset with her..
20090203124308AAnAQ0T	Family & Relationships;Family	Ok this one is going to sound bad but try not to judge....?	I have a 19 year old son and a 14 year old daughter who was born with spina bifida.  I had to let my son move in with his father when he was 10 because he was out of control and I had a hard time with him and trying to keep my daughter alive.  So anyway he came to visit one time and he ended up molesting her when he was 14 and she was 9.  So he was sent off somewhere because of this. He was in there for 2 years and when he got out he was caught with child porn. He claims up and down that it was a mistake and that he has absolutely no interest in children, he was 16 or 17 when that happened so he was sent away again.  I tryed to get him help but with my income I just couldn't his father wouldn't.  So now he is in big boy jail for theft.  He wants to move in with me and my new husband of a year when he gets out. I'm scared.  My husband says we can't trust him and I kinda agree, what should I do I love my son but I also have to take care of my daughter.

20081117143134AAh2nCT	Family & Relationships;Marriage & Divorce	Is there a way to find info regarding a low cost divorce service?	A friend of mine who lives in the state of Kansas is seeking a "no cost" or either a very low cost divorce service.  Her husband is currently incarcerated in the same state and will not contest it.        There are so many online possibilities to choose from, so I thought it best to ask if anyone knows of a highly credible source (with easy to follow step-by-step instructions) or perhaps a great legal adviser here on Yahoo Answers.      Thanks!

Yet, he still hasn't taken our relationship to the next level. He told me a few months ago that we are just friends.

Introduced me to a guy friend and we started talking all the time! We had everything in commen and told each other everything. We were like best friends, and then i developed a crush on him, he never found out untill i got caught for having a myspace and was grounded from the computer for 4 months, so i couldnt get on AIM and talk to him and i didnt have texting at the time so i couldnt talk to him that way. He gave me his number a while back so during the summer i texted him asking him how he was doing and it was really akward and are convos didnt last so long.Then i found out that one of the girls from his school slipped it out and told him i like him and i havnt talked to him since.

20090222104601AAXifnl	Family & Relationships;Other - Family & Relationships	It drives friends & family crazy when I only offer computer help if they aren't running windows.  Is that mean?	I've always been into computers and computing. When Windows XP came out I hated it. And from then on I only use Mac and Linux; with excellent results.  Personally, I think Windows users should be either very knowledgeable about security and maintenance or have an IT department responsible for that if they must run it.      So when friends and family ask what I think about what kind of computer to get I suggest Mac or PC running Linux. And offer to help them learn it and help when things go wrong.  But if they get a Windows PC, they might need someone for support or to recover from a crash and with my strong dislike for working with windows, that's work I really don't want to be the one to do.  But I would if they get a Mac or Linux box which I know more about and have had good luck working with.  The post windows crash or fighting windows viruses are just not battles I want to fight anymore.      It makes some of them really mad.

20090203124028AAYCd5E	Family & Relationships;Marriage & Divorce	Why can my fiance only express himself when he is drunk?	he doesn't have an alcohol problem or anything.  He is not an emotional person, and doesn't talk about his feelings much, it's hard for anyone to get close to him.  When he gets a couple drinks in him he is totally opposite, and what is weird is that he makes good sense, I can have excellent conversations with him about how he really feels and he will actually open up and really get emotional.  When he sobers up, if it was too emotional a conversation he will claim not to remember it and blame it on being drunk.  Why can't he be this way sober, and by him saying it when drunk I've always heard drunk words are sober thoughts

20080709205112AA3YDxo	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Need Help!!!!?	One of my coworkers is moving away to another state and he and I became really close on a friendship level because after all I am married and I take my vows very seriously.  Anywho, today at work, he told me that he is in love with me and he doesnt want to leave because he will miss me too much.  He knows the fact that I am married and I never knew he felt that way for me until now.  Should I tell my husband or just let it go?  He bought a beautiful ring, which I didnt accept. I am totally confuzzled right now.  I thought he just saw me the way I see him.  Im not used to this at all, men notice me, but then my rings.  What am I to do?  I feel like a teenager right now(no offense to the teens reading this)!!!
20081102071749AAApWl6	Family & Relationships;Friends	What's a good "gang"/group name :D?	I want to find a fun name for my friends and I, we're not an actual gang (we're whiter than white bread :D and against drugs and alcohol and stuff.) We mostly dig just hanging out with each other and in the nearby city/dowtown areas, and we go out swing dancing every so often (is that wierd-sounding for high schoolers to do? haha)      I want a one or two word name; for instance, my brother and his friends called themselves "Swarthy" and he spray-painted onto a jacket "Swarthy is a gang"...Just throw out some words and we'll see if any of them catches my eye.

20080707133319AAs4m1K	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	What's going on with him? Is this normal?	I met this guy recently out of the state, since i was moving back home , we decided to exchange emails and keep in touch from there. We got to know each other on the net and talked quite alot.       Then one day, he asked me whether i like to watch porn..my impression of him slightly changed, i don't know..it's just that we just started getting to know each other and out of nowhere started acting all horny, like asking me sex-related questions, how i masturbate, what i like to watch on porn, and that he'd like to share some vids + pics with me..anyways, i don't wanna go too much into detail and i apologize if i've mentioned any inappropriate content.       Well, he told me he has a girlfriend out of the state..so i mean, it isnt normal to be doing this behind her back is it? I know it's pretty normal to have a strong sex drive at this age and everything..he wasn't being too vulgar..just acting horny thats all. What do you think of this ? i just thought it was a little inappropriate ..
20090109090414AAwrnSd	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Is it good to have the best of both worlds? is this smart ? have a boyfriend & a sidekick?	I was thinking about my boyfriend & how much I love him  & how I want to be with him forever but then sometimes he dont be actin right so I figured why not get another boy on the side( not 2 have sex with or anything like that) just someone else to talk to N chill with. When my boyfriend aint viben wit me right. That way I dont be so caught up wit my boyfren because god forbid something ever happen to us & we break up I would already have somebody else who I wouldnt mind being with. or having a relationship. F.Y.I me & my boyfriends relationship is good & I'm really happy right now but then there are times when & wonder if he's being completely faithful to me or is he with someone else? And other times he'll be acting stupid like guys normally do. SO I figured when those times come just talk 2 my sidekick and when my boyfriends tighten up & get right den I'll stop talkin 2 my sidekick until I need him again. I'm not a cheater or anything I was just wondering. And I'm 17 & my boyfriend is 18 So can you guys please help me????????????

20070815151259AAWIZWU	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	I'm getting mixed signals. Does he like me or not?	When I started talking to this guy online, he said he was starting to like me. He paid for my lunch and I thought everything was cool, but he didn't even try and hug me, or hold my hand. Although when we were in one of the stores he tried to tickle me and then when we were sitting in his car driving back to my car from the other mall, he kept poking me in my stomach. I wouldn't think a guy would do that sort of stuff if he didn't like you, but my friend was sort of shocked that he didn't at least hug me. And he's told me he's a pretty forward person, and that in past relationships girls thought he moved too quick. Is possible that because of the backlash in past relationships he could be trying to take it as slow as possible? Before we had met up, I had mentioned a concert that was like an hour or so from him, and told him I'd be there, and he said he may go (even though he doesnt listen to the band), and I asked him again last night, he was like, "probably, we'll see". Any thoughts?

20081009072702AAlg9WX	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	What do you think about this situation, what would u do, think?	My man had a couple of bad months (financially) so we haven;t been going nowhere, maybe like once a month for a drink or 2, thats it. He finaly got a good pay this month and so I was looking for more action for us (Just to let you guys know, I do spend my money on us too, specialy on his dinners I cook for him). He rang me 2 days ago saying he is going to buy wheels for his car for like 200quid and so he won't have much money for the rest of the month. I told him well, if its important to you then sure go for it , on what he reacted : Oh but u also important to me. I was obviously not happy from the tone of my voice but what could i do? If i start to blame him he will get upset that im telling him what to do. So I was hoping that he will get the message and wont buy that stupid wheels so we can spend some quality time, but yesterday.....he went and bought them. I now feel like he doesnt really care about us , all he cares about is himself. Do you think im right to be upset???

20081006072732AAUg9bX	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Would a man take his time getting to know a woman if all he wanted from her was sex? ?	What I mean by this is... Say, you are attracted to a woman and you know that you could "seal the deal" because you know that she is attracted to you, too. Now, if you took your sweet time getting to know her, does that mean you may be interested in more than just the sex?       I ask this question because I have a pretty huge crush on my neighbor (we live in an extremely small neighborhood in the woods).  He has been spending all his time with me and I think things are probably going to move in a different direction here, soon.  I'm 28, he's 41.  He hasn't tried anything yet and we have spent the last 2 months together.        We both talked about our previous relationships when we first started hanging out and I told him I definitely needed to get to know the next guy I date as a friend before anything else.  Well, he comes to my house every single day right when he gets home from work.  Do you think he would spend this much time with me if all he wanted was sex?       BE HONEST

20081018182218AAkO3YA	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Girls, how old were you when you began to accept/love your body?	As weird as this may sounds, I was 14 years old. The majority of teenage girls are unconfident with their bodies.   I thought it was weird. I hated it.   In sixth grade, I was like 5'3" & about 80 pounds. I was very underweight. Kids called me anorexic and this one boy asked me if I was bulimic one time. Some even called me anorexic to my face! I was just a skinny little thing.Kids saying those things about me really hurt me, and I would look in the mirror and think, "wow. I really do look anorexic/bulimic". Now when I look back at pictures of me from middle school, I cringe. I was a pin thin girl.   In 7th and 8th grade I talked to this school counsler. I loved her. I felt like I could tell her anything. She was amazing. In 8th grade she told me that I was a skinny girl, but that I had a great figure. She said that I'm thin, but should be proud of the body I've got. I felt her room that day feeling confident. That little talk with her really helped me.   Eventually I gained weight. I got healthier. I'm still very thin. It's just not as severe anymore.    Now I love my body. I love my legs. They're long & toned. I love my boobs. I really do. It feels really good to love my body. It's an amazing feeling. I love it.   Yes, of course I still have my doubts. I still wish I could put on some weight. I'm not always 100% happy with my body. Generally though, I love it.    I want to help other girls who are unconfident in their bodies. I know what that feels like. It's a terrible feeling. If I could help just one girl, my goal is already complete.
20081220223924AAVir84	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	I know it's long but please read this I seriously need help I really love this on girl, just answer and read .?	I like this girl alot I am a freshman in high school I have never had a girlfriend, I have been interested in 4 girls in my life so far. I have asked out 2. The first one I asked out, 3-4 times I was desperate, young, and had no idea how weird I was being. I think I alienated her alot because I went through a satanic phase at that time and was really into Marilyn Manson, Cradle of Filth, ect. I even looked up black magic spells to get her to like me. I was a freak I know I was an absolute freak. I alientated alot of people back then. Now I still like music, the music I have liked my whole life even before that phase I did all that **** in my phase to seem cool, and mysterious it was pethetic. any way now I am a guitarist and my favorite bands are AC/DC, Led Zeppelin, and Aerosmith. Anyway I like a new girl now but the situation is problematic. The girl who I asked out many times is good friends with the girl I like. However, I think things have settled down now the girl I used to like realized it was just a phase. at least I hope so. anyway, this is the real problem. to talk to the girl I like I have to walk over to her lunch table and not only talk to her, but her friends as well at least one person at that table is my friend so that's good. but that's the only way I can talk to her besides from smoker's hill, by my school. the name implies what it is but it's also a hangout for kids that are not of the norm. now for the bad part, she used to say hi to me from time to time and we had a couple of chats here and there. then she and I would pound it and she would say hi to me more often, them boom nothing. she just stopped talking to me. she even stopped saying hi when i'm standing right next to her. I wasn't being clingy. I only came over to her table 4-7 times in the past 2 months. I first started liking her when she was outside with her friends locked of the school because if you don't make it to class on time the doors lock so I opened it for them then at lunch she told someone of he saved us from the cold and she gave me a nickname it was dylan because she says I look like thats my name and now she calls me that or used to then she would offer to pound my fist. she offered it. but now nothing, even at smokers hill when I'm right ******* next to her nothing! when I offered her a light she took it and gave it back like it was from a stranger. I have many concerns first of all, why did she stop saying hi at least? does or did she like me? can I get her to if not, and how? also how does my situation look? if she s ma how can I fix it? how can i find out what is wrong? how can I move from pounds to hugs? oh and she does smoke she lit it and gave it back to me

So there's this family... i'm friends with the kids who are my age, but the parents really aren't good ppl to be around... they are manipulative, and it's really easy to Like them. it happened to me a while ago, i had some troubles in my life, and found myself confiding in their mom more than i even said Hello to my own mother. She convinced me that my parents weren't good parents and didn't have the right way to handle children, and i believed them. And i rolled my eyes whenever my mom brought it up because 'there's nothing wrong with them, ur just overreacting'. then one day, my dad took me out on a walk to talk to me about them, he told me about some things i never knew about things they did (and email that some parents and children recieved about and upcoming event was different to the kids than it was to the parents, both made to be more appealing to the age group by the slight changing of words. some conversations that she and my mother had... etc.)    My concern is that my friends are going to get hurt... my best friend is "sucked in" just like i was, and he argues when i try to tell him about these things. he just gets mad and says '[i'm] just retarded. and [i'm] becoming like my parents (who are also stupid according to him)'    I'm just worried about what might happen. i'm not allowed over to their house, and i cant be anywhere that the parents are... but my friends think their friends with these adults.

20080929131958AAhMq0g	Family & Relationships;Friends	Did I Have The Right To Be Mad?	The other day I was chatting online with a friend who was helping me with a paper. He didn't understand what I was asking him. So I decided to call him in order to give a better explanation. Since my phone is a prepaid and is currently out of minutes until I can afford to get some more I asked a friend if I could use hers. She said yes without giving me any stipulations. I gave the phone back to her and thought nothing more about it.      Then later I went over to ask her another question and seen that she was on IM and had given my friend's number to whoever she was talking to she quickly tried to hide it too.       I asked her who she had given my friend's number to and at first she said she didn't give it to anybody. Then got to thinking about my sister and sent her an IM and I casually asked my friend if she knew that my sister was online. She told me no. But my sister had already told me she was talking to my friend cause they are friends too.      I asked my sister if my friend had given her a number. She said yes but was unable to tell me which number it was due to computer failure. But I knew it had been my friend's.      Since we were in the computer lab at the college I decided to drop the matter cause it was upsetting both of us and other people trying to study didn't need to hear our problems.      When we got back to my house I confronted her about it. I just simply asked her why it was ok for her to lie to me whenever she wanted if she wanted me to be completely honest with her.      She told me that I had no right to have information about my friends number and that was that.      I told her that may be what she believed but one way or another I was going to get my answers. Did I have the right to be mad at her giving out the number?      PLEASE NO RUDE OR DUMB REMARKS. JUST ANSWER THE QUESTION.

20080229183125AAPeoRo	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	I screwed up. How can I fix the pain I caused?	I've been dating my boyfriend for 3 years, and I love him. He's my best friend and the most compatiable man I've ever been with. I can truely see myself settling down with him someday. However I have a problem with sex. I can't have it with him. Even if we mess around I get bored within minutes; we've tried everything we can find but I can barely make myself kiss him with tongue. We fight about it a lot, mostly because I'm his first and he's not mine. In fact with every other relationship I'm usually the one begging for more. I know he's stressing about this and its hurting him bad but I don't know what to do! Last night he stopped answering his phone right before a date and hung out with a friend I dislike instead. Later he called to say goodnight, I asked if he forgot he said no. That was it. Then I blew up said horrible things and accused him of a lot of inappropriate things. How do I fix this?
20081005002451AAPNJjA	Family & Relationships;Friends	Do I tell my friend the truth about her ex?	A close friend dated a man for 3 years, and became engaged near the end. However one day fairly recently he broke it off saying he was joining the air force and needed to focus on himself and couldn't handle having to take care of her on top of it.      Its been a few months since the break up and my friend has only gotten worse. She's close to rock bottom right now. My friends and I are at a loss for what to do.      Sad this comes to myspace, but unfortunately it does. During the breakup the man told her he'd "always love her" and "someday they would be together again". She will hold onto these words forever. However, just a few days ago another friend and I were on myspace leaving a message for an old friend when we noticed the ex had left a comment.      The comment was in regards to why he broke up with our friend. He stated "thought he loved her but was mistaken"  and was "glad to be rid of her". The comment was posted the same night he called our friend and mentioned how nice it was to "hear her voice".      We're at a loss, do we tell her of the comment-and how? Do we ignore it and let her find out through time?

20080307230041AA8ocrB	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Date help please!!! How do I ask her to dinner? girls I need your help especially?	I recently starting hanging out with a girl I knew 2 years ago. In the short few weeks we starting hanging out again we've become close. She hugs me every time she sees me and when I leave. I like her as more than a friend. I didn't have the guts to say date but I asked her to the movies and I said I would pay. She told me that was nice of me but I'm not sure if she sees it as a date. She has said that she doesn't want another boyfriend for awhile she has had a few before yet I have never had a girlfriend. I want to make myself clearer to her that I like her more than a friend so I plan on asking her to dinner letting her pick anywhere in town even the most expensive place. I plan on giving her flowers to but how do I ask her? I've been told I shouldn't say the word date why would that be wrong. I plan on asking her when we go to the movies if she wants to go out to dinner after. Would it bother her offering flowers when she might not see it as a date? thanks to all that reply.

20070802194831AAoRXxG	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	One last shot?	Please help... I'm 16 and from the Philippines, and just recently, I told the girl that I love that I love her. The only problem was, her feelings said otherwise. She also said that she likes the guy that is being paired with her. But one thing that I noticed when she was voicing out her reaction to my revelation was that she was avoiding saying anything to hurt me, although I was very much ready for anything she was about to say. Now, we're still friends (thank God). Now, my question is: Should I make one last pitch and try to win her heart for the last time, or just let it be? I'm not planning on launching my pitch anytime soon, but sometime around March (when our Senior's ball is on). Please, what do you think I should do? Thanks!

Before you say 'get a job', I got paid decent money out of a recent internship and never spend any of my money if I don't have to, but father won't allow me to buy a car PERIOD. I am almost 20 years old entering soph. year of college and I've only driven a FEW times in my life in a 1 mile radius from my home. Why, because father is a prick that believes I should lack any kind of life experience until I get kicked out of the house. I'm getting sick of being FORCED to mooch of my parents and want to be more independent and have a car, especially so I can get some actual experience driving. Is there any way possible that I can go about accomplishing this? TIA

20070816183144AAoAEgr	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	I like this girl but she is hard to read..Is there alarm to believe her or not?.?	My girlfriend and i have gone out for 4 1/2 months. i love her but she has not said it back yet. That's not what i'm hung up about. If my girlfriend has a few pictures of a guy back in her home town.i have asked her and she says just friends with the guy. I have seen pictures of them kissing and being close with each other more than once. She tells me they are just friends and never had sex.Is there alarm to believe her or not?. She is European but still the pictures almost look like the ones you would take like you were more than friends. We are together but she is leaving to go home and study for 5 months. i asked if she was going to see him and she said yes but told me he has a girlfriend. Maybe she is just with me for now and is going to go back to him. Again i like her a lot and want to make this work.
20070820102036AAOnKP6	Family & Relationships;Friends	Don't know what to do!?	I broke up with my gf a few months ago. A friend introduced me to a few of her friends and I thought I really liked this one girl so i have been talking to her a lot and I do like her but then one of my friends said that maybe i fancy my friend but she has a bf whose also my friend. I'm really confused because I thought I wasn't quite over my ex and i like this girl who was really in to me but know i don't know what I'm feeling and since my friend said that i might like my friend I've been thinking of her. I'm scared that i do like her and that if i do i can't do anything because she is dating my friend and it would ruin my friendship with the both of them. I can't speak to anyone about this so can you help me.

20070830125111AAQSTfP	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	How do you know you're in love?	I'm in love.  I know I am because I rarely get angry with him, no matter what he does or how he acts...I tolerate things from him that I wouldnt from anyone else... I cant imagine my life without him... even after a year and a half, I get butterflies when I first see him when we've been apart even for a day...hearing him say "I love you" makes me feel whole and complete... I find him sexier, more handsome, and cuter than any guy... I would trust him with my life... I have confidence that he can do anything he attempts...I feel safe with him...normally a slightly selfish person, I want to share anything with him and do anything I can to make his life happier and easier...I get pleasure out of doing little surprises for him... I think about him constantly... he is my best friend... he pushed and inspired me to improve myself and grow as a person...most importantly, I just FEEL it.

20081009072423AAcMmfc	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Should I invite him or not?	I broke up with my boyfriend of 2 years in the beginning of September. We meet at school and for the 2 years had the same group of friends, because the break up was sudden we didn't really talk about who gets the friends kind of thing, so he ended up with them and I haven't talked to anyone since the break up. I have had some of the friends call me and email me about hanging out with them but my answer was  always the same "I'm not ready" and it was true.    About a week ago my now ex boyfriend came up to me and started talking to me and (not to be mean) but he had some tears in his eyes and it just made me feel worse so I ended the conversation but what little we did say I have to say it was nice talking to my best friend again. I have been planning to have a halloween party just for the groups of friends iI no longer talk to just so we can kind of get back in the groove.    The question is should I invite him or not???

20070930183211AAgCNRN	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	There's a girl that I like...?	I'm in high school right now and there's a girl that I really liked last year, but I was too shy to admit to it.  Then, about halfway through the year, her seat was moved so that she sat in front of me in one of my classes.  She started playing little games with me and sort of flirting.  She also kept trwould stretch every once in a while to touch me and I was almost certain she like me back.  Unfortunately, I got very intimidated when she started pursuing me and I managed to convince myself that she was just using me.  When I saw her in class this year, I actually got mad at her for having used me even though I know she didn't and tried to convince myself that I didn't like her anymore, but I still do.  I think she still likes me to some extent, but seems to have given up on me because I managed to almost completely avoid her last year.  My question is very vague:  I just want to know what you think I should do about this because I'm completely lost.  Any advice would be appreciated.

I am 25 single, great job, normal lol, mature, good looking, clean etc. I have dated many amazing girls, a couple for multiple years, and had many great times. Some of them i messed up (just wasnt ready to tie down) and some they messed up. if you ask anyone that has known me there isnt anything "wrong" with me. I personally try to rid myself of any bad qualities i may have. BUT ....   I am the last of my friends to be married, I dont even have a steady GF, I dont understand it, and now it seems i cant find one, I havent had a worthwhile GF for almost 6 months !!, I have only dated 1 girl during that time also !!!   I lmoved to a town with about, 90k people and we have 2 colleges, I work full time, and go to the bars sometimes on the weekends, thats really all, no other activities sadly :(   Anyone have any suggestions on how to kick start my life ? Am i behind ? I feel like i am the lacky of my friends and they all thought Id get married first.... Any suggestions ?
20071029153212AAH39Jq	Family & Relationships;Friends	My friends are in a fight but it's hard not to get involved?  Read on?	I'm in a group of 5 best friends; two of them are in a fight (I'm not too sure why, because I've been trying to stay out of it as much as possible).  From now on I'll refer to one friend as #1 and the other one as #2.  They both have been fighting on and off for the past month or so.  #2 doesn't hang out as much with us anymore, so I don't really know what she's thinking, but #1 told me today that she was going to forward me something #2 wrote to #1 yesterday, to show me the bitchy thing #2 said.  I remind you we're all supposed to be best friends.      So my issue:   I DON'T want to read the letter because really it doesn't concern me (not that I know of at least), and I should just let them two figure this out by themselves and I don't want to have to take #1's side   I DO want to read it so I know what the whole thing is about so then I understand what's going on among my group of best friends.      I urgently need advice!

Everytime I looked down and then up again I would see him looking and smiling at me.   A couple days ago, me and him were partners and we were working on math problems and he would ask me the answer to some problem and I'd answer him and he'd go and check to make sure, so I'd always say "don't you believe me" and once he said "Of course I believe you, I just thought it looked wrong so I had to check.", and then this other girl(in our group) goes "Ya, you're very believable" so then he goes "ya..you are"

Heres the deal: I'm 18 yrs old and in my second semester of college, I have never had a girlfriend my entire life and I always acted as if it didnt matter much to me. During the first year of college I met this Vietnamese girl who is rumored to have had sex with a lot of people. The girl showed me affection, we kissed, etc. but never had sex, and I lied to my friends and said I did since everyone labels her a "Ho". When I left home for the Christmas break at the end of the semester I thought shed be here when I returned, I even bought her a present. well the bottom line is SHE ISNT HERE ANYMORE, and now I'm going crazy, all I can do is think about here, I dont even care about school anymore and it hurts on the inside because I miss her so much. No one has ever shown me the affection shes shown me, and now I'm lonely and feel like ****. I cant even get a girlfriend. I feel like just ending it all right now, and I desperrately need some advise from someone anonymously. Please help.

That is not the main problem however, her brother who is 15 as well is my best friend. He studies with me in the same class and we both always hang out. He is preety conservative about his sister, so this made the situation more difficult for me. My entire valentine's day has been really solitary. She is divorced, however, but i hardly care. She is new here, she used to live in 'England but came to live here because her dad wanted her to. So she does not know to many people. I noticed her look at me all the time, and she notices me look at her as well. And by the way, i am not bad looking, i am good looking. I am not boasting around, it is just so that you know more and can help me out better. So what should i do to get her. What are the steps i need to follow. Should i talk to her? Will my friend take it easy if he knows about it?

20080308192819AA29NN9	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Relationship help? GUYS MOSTLY.?	My dad owns clubs, the biggest ones, and he an employee I REALLY like ..    But theres one problem, he's older then me by like, 7 years...   and is seeing a girl, (not pretty)    Normally I'd assume I have no chance, but I always catch him looking at me.   Everyone has always told me I was pretty, all the employees there always compliment me and stuff.   so yeah, he's always looking at me, and I'll smile at him and he smiles back, but its not a smile because I'm smiling, I can feel something. I got drunk the other night and he was working and I  laid down on the couch and he was looking at me.   And when he hugs me bye, he squeezes me tight, and kinda holds me for a bit, and when he hugs other people it's just for a sec, and really loose.    My friend also said that it seemed like he was trying to get our bodies to touch . .   does this mean I have a chance ?! Not even for a relationship, but even a hookup.

20080320154057AA10bu8	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	(For the Ladies) When you're playing "hard to get"?	In an attempt to understand this frustrating game that girls play I've made this list of questions:      Part 1: How do you want the guy to respond?   a. Subtle flirting   b. More obvious flirting   c. Come right and tell you he likes you/wants to date you   d. Play hard to get back      Part 2: If he responds by doing either a, b, or c (above) how are you MOST LIKELY to respond?   a. flat out tell him you aren't interested    b. act totally uninterested    c. act uninterested but throw some subtle hints to the contrary (leave the door slightly open)   d. show that you are interested      If you answered a, b, or c, how long will you go before you crack and show interest?      Part 3: If the guy plays hard to get back, how are you MOST LIKELY to respond?   a. lose interest    b. get confused and/or sad and therefore stop pursuing   c. want him more and therefore show interest   d. continue playing hard to get as usual      Also, if the guy starts flirting with other girls (or they start flirting with him) how will you respond?
20080321044106AAHyduW	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Broken Heart?	My boyfriend and I have been together for 2 going on 3 years.  Yesterday we had a HUGE fight.  A guy I used to date in high school (almost 10 years ago) called.  At first I didn't know who it was calling so my boyfriend called the number back.  I explained to my boyfriend who the guy was.  He says something was going on because the guy called at 7 in the morning. I told him that I really didn't know why he called that early but he threw a fit.  I told him we only talked a few less than 5 times on the phone and that he stays in Chicago.  We never had sex or planned on being together.  I apologized to my boyfriend for giving my number out to an old friend and told him I would never do it again.  Well that wasn't enough for him and he broke up with me.  We just found a new house yesterday and now he says he doens't want it.  Whatt could or should I do so that we can get over this and move forward with our relationship???

I believe when we watch pornographic or some nude images even it tends us to get addicted to it. and arose our sexual desire which we tries to fulfill either by masterbation or going to other sex. which is illegal.      do you think this pornographic.. easy of access of pornography really destroying our social life? where love was the motive but not illlegitimacy is growing day by day?   how can we control it?      be sincere to urself.. when you reply.      plz vote if you really think we should avoid watching even movies.. that has some kind of nude even.

My boyfriend and I have been dating for awhile now, and he never wants to have sex anymore. I spend the night at his house quite often..and he just never makes a move to do anything. He knows it's getting to me, but he doesn't really seem to care all that much yet. Its been weeks since we've last done it, and we used to do it all the time!!! His libido was so high, and now I can't even get him to make out with me! It's really starting to get on my nerves to the point where I get bitchy around him when I think about it, or when he doesn't want to do it. He tells me he loves me more than just on a physical level... but it's not really physical at all. I know he loves me and cares about me yada yada yada.. but where did the sex go? I don't have any reason to believe he's cheating on me, so I really don't know what the problem is. What can I do?!

I mean we've both dated other people but never been in love or really cared about the other person. We've been together 2 and half years now, but I worry about our differences. I mean we're not into the same tv shows, I read and he doesn't, I hate sports and he is obsessed, he's very smart and in college for mechanical engineering and I'm into cosmeteology and that stuff goes way over my head, his family is religous and mine isn't...we're into paranormal and alternative things...which freaks him out a little but he's okay with it...I mean really we just really love other and it was a "love at first sight" sort of thing. We have gone through alot together...does being different really matter?

20080707203515AASprwS	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Moral question?	Ok, I'm not one to disrespect someone else's relationship, let alone a marriage, but what about an engagement?  If there's someone you want to be with, but because you were too shy or put it off too long, you found out the person just got engaged, is it too late?  If someone's just "involved" sometimes you have time to let the relationship to run it's course, while you do your own thing, but once someone's engaged, there's a definite time limit.  Is it selfish to try to break up an engagement for your own wishes?  Or is an engaged person still technically available?

20080708210555AAt3iwc	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	My boyfriend is obsessed with his computer!!! soooo frustrating!!!?	My boyfriend sits ALL day long on his computer usually playing rp games, on counterstrike, or teamspeak. And when I say thats all he does, that is all he does. I get so frustrated because sometimes when we're on the phone, i'll have to listen to him ramble about his games or the people he meets on there. This sometimes hurts my feelings because its like he has these great relationships going on and I seriously feel out of the loop from him. I just wish that he would find some better things to do besides sit in front of his computer all day. He's already fat and he is lazy but he is my boyfriend and i love him. I prefer making friends and socializing in person, not through a computer screen. It probably seems petty, but it does bother me that he seems to spend way more time on his "social networks" than he does with me. I know guys can be "techies" and its perfectly normal, but sometimes it can truly bother me.......any girls out there know what i'm talking about and feel the same?

20080710204936AAPNJ2U	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Why is this guy not talking to me after sex?	Me and friends were at this one guy's house drinking and sitting around a fire just socializing and getting drunk. I got sick. I went into the house to throw up. The guy who invited me to the party (also whose house we were at), came inside to check on me. I fell on the floor and he asked to kiss me. I said ok. We ended up having sex that night. And while I was still in bed with him, he asked me if I would date him. He said things like how he thought I was beautiful and wanted to date me when he first met me a week before that night; and he said this stuff in all sincerity. I gave no definite answer that night. I slipped away early in the morning, and saw him at work the next day. But things were awkward. He tried talking to me once on my way out, "Have a good one" kind of thing. But it's like he is sad about something. I want to still be friends with him, but I don't know what to say. I am confused on two points: 1 Why is he sad and distant? 2 What should I do to get us talking again?

20080711202954AAlbzj3	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	How do I let her go?	I love this girl so much, with all my heart, but we have a long distance relationship. We used to talk everyday all night, now she's hardly ever on because of her parents, and lets just say I'm not their "type". We had the perfect thing going but now we're losing it. I love her but it's too much. I want to let her go because I can't keep hurting her this way, she's needs someone to hold her, not someone to talk to over the net. I'm afraid that if I let go, she's commit suicide, she's very suicidal. She's also OCD. But this whole situation is making me feel like I can't do this anymore, like I've failed the relationships, life itself even. I can't bare the pain anymore and I can't keep lying to her about my attempts. She doesn't deserve the pain I'm putting her through. But I can't let go, I love her too much.

20080910193921AAhNLnx	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Guys, Girls, ANYONE! Help me out here!!?	I broke up with my ex awhile ago. I was with him for 2 years on/off. We lost our virginity to eachother. He was basically my first everything. He did not treat me well. It took me so long to figure that out. As soon as I finally realized it I dropped him, stopped talking to him, and wouldn't hang out with him anymore. He did so many hurtful things to me. He tried to keep in contact and eventually got the hint.      Anyways, my mom came to my school today to drop off something in the office and when she was walking outside she saw him with a couple of his friends. My mom said he came up to her and said hi with a smile on his face. They had a little conversation and then he left with his friends.      Is that weird? Or is it just me?      He's a very shy guy so I'm surprised and especially since he was with 2 of his friends...

It's not a weight issue for him, it's a control issue.  It runs in his family, his dad and sister does it too i discovered.  But i've told him over the years that i want him to get help, i need him to stop, i'll help him, be there for him all the way. we've got 3 kids together and 1 on the way and i really can't take it any more. I see him over eating and i try to hint at him to not, but he laughs like it's nothing. Then i hear him go the bathroom and when he comes out i know he's been sick.  It hurts me so bad to see him go through this and i know you'll probably say he needs to want to stop.  But i think he does only doesn't know how. It went better for a while, i knew he was trying to reduce it, and that made me get off his case a lot, but now it's started becoming bad again.  It causes arguments cos if i even mention it he swears and shouts at me.  I can't deal with it, to the point i want to ignore it and pretend i don't see it, but i do see it and it's killing me.

20090203124849AABe0lB	Family & Relationships;Marriage & Divorce	I want to make myself happy...?	Hello. I just recently separated from my fiance of two years. The two of us still talk on a friendly basis, and he has made it clear to me that he still wants to be with me and marry me. However, about one year ago, he gave me an STD that he said that he got from a previous relationship. I believed him and stayed with him, but whenever I wanted to talk about it some more, it seemed that he only got more and more frustrated with me. It was a difficult time for me because he was my first and everything seemed to be going perfect up until that point. Because of this, I decided to seek advice from my grandmother and she took it upon herself to call him and question him about the situation. Since then, everything has gone downhill. I did not mean to make him look bad in the situation. I just needed some more time to talk about it. After I asked my fiance for counseling and he refused, I didn't know what to do. Anyway, I am still hoping that things will work out between us, but I also don't want my grandmother to be disappointed in me if I choose to start the relationship again with him. I also don't want him to feel uncomfortable. I just want to make myself happy. What are your thoughts on a loved one not approving a possible life partner? Thanks in advance.
20090203125137AAT8pWi	Family & Relationships;Family	SELF-ESTEEM PROBLEMS! ?	I have very low self-esteem. Although I am considered accomplished by people that know me, I feel inadequate most of the time. I guess I do a good job at “faking” confidence.     Since I have recognized this problem, I am working toward moving in a better direction. I have started surrounding myself around positive people and going for therapy to manage this.    However, I now feel like I want to cut all my immediate family members (parents/sister) out of my life, because I believe they influence me to feel bad about myself.  Sometimes I get angry thinking about some of the things they have said and done to me. I believe they don’t even know how what contempt I have for them. I keep most of my feelings bottled up. The few times I have even confronted them about mean things they did they just deny it and turn it back on me.        Please give me suggestions on how to handle this. I do not want an argument and I am trying to prevent saying something mean.  I know if I continue to ignore their phone calls it poses a risk of one of them showing up at my home/job unexpectedly.          Should I just tell them that I want them to give me some space?        Serious answers only please.

Our children are 7,9 and 12.    We are both working professionals who love to play sports with our children in the evenings. We make sure our kids are doing well in school. Myself and my hubby like to go out on friday night to the bar...kids are left with a family member...we have yard parties once a month where we have a barbeque, beers and some music.      The woman who lives next door is a devote catholic..and thats fine. I am catholic too and go to church every sunday....HOWEVER its like she thinks we are evil. She only allows her daughters to wear dresses are this is traditional..she doesn't like my kids to play with hers...she says alcohol is evil...and there is constantly religious music coming from her house.....she says the father should be the bread winner and mother a care taker..

20090203131141AAZ0QtZ	Family & Relationships;Family	How can I forgive my brother?	He married a woman only 8 months ago that is tearing our family apart. She's building walls between him and us and he's just blindly following her word against ours. He chooses to let her lay the rules down because its easier then fighting about it. But, in turn he's also betraying his family. Everyone else in my family is trying to make amends with them, but they choose to pretend like nothing is happening and refuse to talk about it. I can't allow people in my life that cause more harm then good....regardless of their family status.      I choose not to talk to him until he figures things out for himself. I assume it won't happen until they divorce, and who knows how long that will be be. I haven't spoken to him in almost a year. But, I hate carrying this anger around with me. I don't think about it often, but on the occasion that I do, I am filled with rage.      How can I let him go? And how can I let this anger go?

20090203125946AAfrUww	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Is there more guys like him?	First of all all my life I ran into perverts and deviants and women haters.      So I abandoned all men except one.  We've been friends for 5 years and he's the only single guy I know who's not a deviant and respects women.      He surprised me the other day which made me love him and respect him even more.  He knows about my medical problems and how I didn't reach puberty until age 23.  I confessed to him that he's the first guy I'm physically attracted to and he's really hard to be around with.      And you know what he did? He said ok that's normal.  He didn't jump my bones, he didn't try to seduce me or flirt with me!      He is so stinkin awesome!  Guys like him are rare in my life.  I live in a rural town so when I move to a big city(a Christian college) will I meet more guys like him?      We're just friends and agreed to not get involved romantically.      What would you do if you were in my shoes?

20090203131809AAXCxa2	Family & Relationships;Marriage & Divorce	When a married couple just "grow apart", how would you suggest they re-connect?	It's really me who has done the majority of the changing.  I used to enjoy going out, but now, with 2 young kids and one on the way, I'm happier with quiet get togethers with friends and family.  I can't stand  drinking anymore.  I enjoy church.       Over the past few years mine and my husbands lives have gone in separate directions.  We have separate friends and outings.  He doesn't want to hang out with 'churchy' people and I don't want to hang out with drunks.        Going out alone doesn't even sound appealing. I can't imagine what we could do that we'd both enjoy.        Have you and your spouse ever been through a phase like this or do you think that we're doomed?  I can't imagine going back to who I was because I have children who depend on me now.  Frankly, the old me is kind of embarrassing.        Any ideas?
20090203130051AAYvrVy	Family & Relationships;Friends	Is it wrong of me to feel this way around my friends?	So last year (senior year in high school) I started being really close with this girl named Katherine, she is Filipino. We would always go out to lunch and have the same classes. We became really close and I eventually ended up hanging around her friends 24/7. However, all of her friends were either Filipino or Chinese, which I didn't mind, but sometimes I would feel a little left out (I'm half white and half mexican). Anyways, whenever we all went out to eat, i would hear them talking behind my back. Whenever I suggested eating at Chipotle, they would say it was because I was Mexican. They wouldn't invite me to their volleyball/tennis games because it wasn't "soccer", and one time I overheard my friend Katherine and her boyfriend saying that I looked like the black sheep out of all of them. I felt really uncomfortable, but unfortunately, we all applied to the same university and we all go here now. I still hang around them but I can't help but feel weird around them. I know they joke, but sometimes they really hurt my feelings. Just last night they invited me to sushi and made fun of me because I don't know much about it or what's good to order..      should i stop hanging out with them?   i've told them it bothers me but they do it behind my   back anyways... i know it's OK to joke.. but I've seriously   had enough.. please someone advice me on what to do.

20090203125735AAHkwd4	Family & Relationships;Friends	Is this situation messed up or what?	Just wanted to get an opinion on something, will try to make it short.  I had what I thought was a new friend that was introduced(she introduced herself) to a friend that I knew for 7yrs, this old friend begin inviting the new friend to outings without me.  Before I knew it they were exclusive and I was invited as an after thought every once in a while.  I confronted them about it and one just ignored it and the other said there was nothing wrong with what she did.  In my circle of friends this is not ok and this would have never been allowed to happen.  I recently ended the relationships because it had become too toxic and a side note, I also was told by one that the only reason she hung around the other was because the husband was her "best friend" and she only hung around to be around this friend's husband.  Does this sound foul or am I overacting?

If you say the way you cook your eggs are better. He starts crying. and if you say he's annoying he starts crying and says things i've never said. Like you hate me! Or you don't care about me. But i do care about him. and he's negative. and watches Most Haunting on Discovery. and loves scary things like U.F.Os and ghosts. Most 8 year old boys love sports and gets hurt a lot. My brother is super interested in stones and reptiles. Not like it's bad. He's a bit girly too. He uses big words too. I maybe think i'm just over reacting. or i'm worried about him. Just please tell me how to help his situation. and i know you'll say. "He's your brother! and everyone is different in there own way!"       I'm confused.
20090203125955AAnpVss	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Why doesn't she text and call me as much anymore?	So i've been dating this girl for about three months, and lately she hasn't been calling or messaging me as much as she used to. I mean shes just acting a bit different. I talked to her and she said she still likes me as much as she used to, and would love to keep dating me. She just has a pretty busy life. Up to about two weeks ago, we would talk on the phone for extended periods of time and text each other a lot every day. I guess what what i'm tryin to say is: Do people tend to act a bit less lovey dovey further into the relationship than they do when first starting to go out?

20090203130910AA5JwdX	Family & Relationships;Friends	Should I dump my "friend?"?	My friend ditched me on my birthday and I've known her for five years. She has this supposedly best friend that she only known for a year. My friend ditches me when her friends or other friends come by. I got her this gift for Christmas and after school she went with her other friends to open presents and yet again ditched me. Also, for english class I wanted to read this book for English, and we had a list to pick a book from. Ok so I went up and choose this book, but my friend was like "please could I read this book, you were going to read this other book anyway" so she just snatched it out of my hands. I ignored for almost 2 weeks now and she still hadn't figured out what she had done wrong, and then I wrote a letter explaining why I was mad. Afterward, she said I was accusing her of things and that I was making her sad and angry, and she told me to go speak to her during lunch. I did what she said in the last 3-4 minutes of the period and then she blew me off and said lets talk tomorrow. Soon after she said that I walked away angry, and this is were I need help.       P.S. The whole school knows about it ,but one of my friends said that I should give her one more chance so that the school wouldn't make rumors and agree with me(which most people already do), but my sister said dump her she is not worth it. Thanks for helping!! Sorry this was long

20090203131209AAdsnTu	Family & Relationships;Marriage & Divorce	How do I keep my dad from denying his blessing for my marriage?	I am 23yrs old but a part of an old fashioned family.  I have been with my boyfriend for over a year and I know he is the one.  Nothing in my life has ever clicked as much as this.  We have discussed marriage and decided we are ready.      Problem is, my parents, specifically my dad, are not ready.  I am one of his last remaining children (one of six, only one other sister unmarried) So far my dad is against the relationship because it seems like we got too close too fast and due to language barriers he cannot communicate with my boyfriend.  Based on asking my siblings, they all think we should wait before getting engaged to avoid drama.  However, neither I nor my boyfriend want to put our plans on hold because my dad is not ready to let go.       So other than holding off, how can I keep my dad from saying no?
20090203131209AAxaN2h	Family & Relationships;Family	Was that inappropriate? A long coffee story and I hope I dont offend anyone.?	Well, Im 34 right now but I remembered something these days since I was a boy. I was about 10-11 y o I guess and we had those neighbours we were getting along well, a family with a small child that me and my sister ware babysitting from time to time. They had a VHS (those were rare in that days where I am from) and many times I was going to their place to see a movie. There was a time when the husband was gone away in another country and I went to their place and find the lady alone (the baby sleeping) and I watched movies with her.   One day she said that she has some new movies that she already saw, but I didnt so she played one. It started fine, with an island, some woman that got there and a tribe. Great movie I thought! The tribe captured her and than they showed the woman naked and immobilised, with several females from the tribe massaging her with some oil. Each one had a part of her body, and the 2 queens massaged her breasts and the other one her genitalia. The victim was in pain I supposed because of the noises. Than the boss  arrived and done something to her.  Later a man saved her as she was, naked, and they jumped on a boat. An arrow from the savages landed in her crotch but the man managed to extract it. Strange movie, even if it wasnt quite pornographic because it wasnt that graphic.  Than there ware 2 other women touching each other and I finally asked why where they in pain. My neighbour was standing next to me, watching and eating popcorn all this time. She  laughed and asked my if I really didnt know. She that told me that there was pleasure because thats what women feel sometimes when they are touching their pus*ies. I said that I supposed that only little girls have something like that. I really didnt know what women have down there only that they have hair (and I was curious). She told me that they are almost like little girls, just a little bit different.  Something came up and I had to go home, so that was it.  My neighbour was older than my mom so I suppose that she was about 35-37 that time.  It was a strange day for me, I didnt understand big deal. Nowadays I guess that she did something wrong (even if I looked a little bit older that I was). I just remembered this event the other day and I ask myself if she did something wrong after all and if that day had a bad influence on me. Im a regular man, about to get married, and probable a father one day soon.  Serious answers, please!
