20090222185542AAdkM4X	Business & Finance;Taxes;United States	Filing NY and CA income taxes? Earned CA income before moving to CA.?	I took a job in the second half of 2008 from a company in CA.  After a few months of me working for them (telecommuting, effectively), they moved me to CA.   I earned roughly half of my income from them as a resident of NY, and the other half while as a resident of CA.      When filing my NYS and CA income tax returns, I'm confused as to how to divide up my income.   From what I've gathered via Turbotax's questions, NYS wants me to claim all the income I earned while I was living in NY, regardless of the source, and CA wants me to claim all income earned from CA sources, even before I became a resident of CA.   Basically, it seems like there's an overlap of that few months of income at my new job that both states want me to claim.      Does anyone have experience with this, or any clearer understanding of the situation?  I hope I've explained this well enough.      Thanks in advance!

20090222192432AAjub0V	Business & Finance;Taxes;United States	Why doesn't America switch to Fair Tax (Consumption Tax)?	In a time of crisis, with illegal immigrants taking jobs off hard-working Americans and bringing the money back to Mexico and giving NOTHING back to our economy, every dollar counts and every American needs to keep all their money coming from their pay check (including me), so why doesn't America just switch to Fair Tax? By taxing products directly at a higher rate, the immigrants will still have to buy stuff which means they actually give back to our economy instead of leeching the money off and taking it elsewhere and those hard working Americans that keep getting laid off can keep their jobs!

Hello,      I used to file taxes last year using H & R block but that was when I was still in college and they had a special student rate. Now that I graduated I am wondering if I should do it myself and just buy a tax software.      I heard so much complaints online about H & R block on how they charge a lot for non-students and it made me question if I should go back.       So I am wondering if anybody does really have any bad experiences with H & R or maybe I am just being paranoid.       And on a side note,  does anybody know if they keep a clients previous tax information from the last time they file information ? Because I am considering using the H & R online program.

20070326183932AAnf6xv	Business & Finance;Careers & Employment	What can you do with a supervisor who is "a-hole" of the year?	At work we recently got a new supervisor. He's an ex carreer military man, close to retirement age.       This guy is a big wind bag with a chip on his shoulder, and he's making life hell for many of my coworkers, mostly the women. He berates them and criticizes them in front of others and frequently has them in tears. He's even verbally abusive to the other supervisors in front of the employees. But I don't care about them as they can take care of themselves.      I do care about my coworkers, and wish there was something  I could do to this guy to divert his attention away from the workers to his own life or problems. I don't want to hurt him or do anything illegal, just redirect his attention, to give them a breather.      Our company had a strike several years ago and since then the company and the new human resource director have all had an attitude toward most of the workers, so they are unsimpathetic and unhelpful to people with problems.      Any suggestions??

20070422122546AAR5ICx	Business & Finance;Other - Business & Finance	A mountain of 60's baseball cards - evaluation? Pricing?	Hi.   I'm hoping someone will make my day saying that I have the possibility of having a gold mine on my hands.   My dad collected sports cards religiously in the 60s. I have one of many shoeboxes of cards he owned. I estimate there to be about 400 in this box.   Here's the thing - I know nothing about them, really. The best I've got as far as trading card knowledge is an extensive history with Pokémon cards. Yeah, pretty sad.      I was wondering how I could value all of them? They're honestly from tons and tons of different sets - probably 65% topps. I'm afraid that a standard value book will not cover them all.      I'm just very interested in the values. They're pretty much untouched since about 1974, so they're all in about the condition he first got them. Except for a few that he'd obviously traded for. But still, they don't look 35-40 years old by a long shot.    Any ideas to get me started? I'm a broke high school student so I can't really afford professional evaluation. Free sites? Guides?

20070322135840AANqXI2	Business & Finance;Credit	Franchise lawsuit?	we bought a franchisee jan of 06. we pretty got lied to when buying the business. now there is a legal lawsuit on 4 of the franchisees regarding unethical behavior. now the shopowners before us already had one or a couple of warnings about the unethical work. then we bought the shop and weren't aware about this. then one of our guys got caught not 'doing' the job but 'chargin' for it..we were not aware of it. and that is not my way of doing business. i was very unfamiliar about the way this franchise works and their system. but i got into it and now i can't even sell it.  however what our guy did was rather minimal compared to the other. the other shops have had several warning. now the lawyer assigned by the franchior wants to take all our cases together. if we get a penalty all of us get a penalty. so i want to know whether i should get my own lawyer because i should also get a warning like the rest of the shops did before i am entitled to a penalty etc..any suggestions...

Delinquencies (30 – 180 days): Can remain seven years from the date of the initial missed payment.       Collection accounts: Remain seven years from the date of the initial missed payment that led to the collection (the original delinquency date). When a collection account is paid in full, it will be marked "paid collection" on the credit report.       Charged-off accounts: Remain seven years from the date of the initial missed payment that led to the charge off (the original delinquency date), even if payments are later made on the charged-off account.       Closed accounts: Closed accounts are accounts that are no longer available for further use. Closed accounts may or may not have a zero balance. Closed accounts with delinquencies remain seven years from the date they are reported closed, whether closed by the creditor or by the consumer. Positive closed accounts remain 10 years.       I just copied it, look it up under contact us. You can find it under Ask Max Credit Advice.

The other day, my town's code enforcement officer came by and said that there was a discretion between my home's current tax assessment and the previous one.  It turns out, the previous home owners had put in a finished basement and extra bathroom, but never got Certificate's of Occupancy for the work.  When we bought the house, the town building inspector and Title Search did not discover any of this.  Now two years later, it has come to light.  I'm not sure what the town is going to do in the situation.  Who would be responsible for the COs?  Is it my fault? Is it the previous home owner's fault?  Is it the town's fault for letting the sale go through without addressing the CO issue?  Anyone have any idea?

20090203133930AAcLzua	Business & Finance;Taxes;United States	Will I receive my w2, if it says "return service requested?"?	My friend got her w2 and it says "return service requested" on it. I used to work at the same place however I've since moved and have a forwarding address with the post office. Now with that said she got hers on 1-31-09 I have yet to get mine. My other w2 was forwarded but does not have "return service requested" on it. So will it get forwarded, or sent back to the employer with the new address so they can resend it to the new address?

20080125073521AAOOyg8	Business & Finance;Small Business	What are other alternative paying methods that other businesses like mine use to pay their employees?	Hi, my name is Edward.  I am 25 and my uncle wants me to take over the family commercial caulking business. Right now I am working with the caulkers out in the field to learn how to caulk.  Also, to make sure they do not milk their time for their paychecks and drag their feet.  Unfortunately the caulkers do!  We pay them by the hour so they are in no rush to get the job done and we profit share at the end of the year, but it seems like that is not enough motivation. My question is, what are other alternative paying methods that other businesses like mine use to pay their employees and increase production?      Thank you for your time any answer would be greatly appreciated! :)
