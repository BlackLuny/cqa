Conservatives love to argue that Obama will create debt that will enslave our grandchildren, whose taxes must go up to pay it off.  OK, so who was president when the US seriously paid down debt, and which debts did we pay back?      WW2? Nope. Never paid off that debt.   The New Deal? Didn’t pay off that off either.   WWI? Uh Uh.   The Civil War?  Nope.      Jackson was president in 1835, when we almost paid off the Revolutionary War, the Louisiana Purchase, and the War of 1812.  That’s it.  For more than 170 years, national debt has gone up. Nobody’s grandchild suffered.  It didn’t destroy us because countries carry debt, just like people do.  But unlike homeowners, who carry debt way beyond their annual incomes, the national debt is smaller than national income (GDP), and will be after Obama leaves the White House.      So why will Obama cripple the country when all previous debt did not?      See link for national debt back to 1791.  It has NEVER been zero.    http://www.treasurydirect.gov/govt/repor...

I think if we start seeing some good results by the end of this year then he is doing something right. If we don't we could always vote for a change in congress in 2010.

Injured good Samaritan ticketed for jaywalking         ETDENVER – A good Samaritan who helped push three people out of the path of a pickup truck before being struck and injured has gotten a strange reward for his good deed: A jaywalking ticket.      Family members said 58-year-old bus driver Jim Moffett and another man were helping two elderly women cross a busy Denver street in a snowstorm when he was hit Friday night.      Moffett suffered bleeding in the brain, broken bones, a dislocated shoulder and a possible ruptured spleen. He was in serious but stable condition Wednesday.      The Colorado State Patrol issued the citation. Trooper Ryan Sullivan said that despite Moffett's intentions, jaywalking contributed to the accident.      Moffett had been driving his bus when the two women got off. In the interest of safety, he got out and, together with another passenger, helped the ladies cross.      Moffett's stepson, Ken McDonald, said the driver of the pickup plowed into his stepfather, but not before Moffett pushed the two women out of the way.      When he awoke in intensive care, he learned of the ticket. "His reaction was dazed and confused. I was a little angry," said McDonald.      The other man also was cited for jaywalking, while the pickup driver was cited with careless driving that led to injury. Sullivan said the two elderly women haven't been cited but the investigation is ongoing

20090226165421AACrWDu	Politics & Government;Law Enforcement & Police	Will I get a ticket sent home!?	So I was driving this morning and I came to an intersection. Although it is one of those types of intersections that could do with 4 stop signs, this one had a light so it wasn't a major intersection and you have to for the other cars to pass first before you turn left.      Well, I was waiting on one last car to pass so that I could turn left and like any other person would do, I pulled up into the intersection a little bit. At the time, I wasn't all the way in the intersection, just a little bit of the front of my car was so that the cars perpendicular to me on the other street could probably pass in front (not sure if they could though) but it would be a bother to them and they would probably have to swerve a little bit and the light was also yellow. Well the car I was waiting on finally passed but the light turned red just as it finished going through the intersection and I was slowly creeping up ahead even more so that I could make the turn. So I ended up making the turn on a red light and there was a cop behind me. Now I am scared that I will get a ticket sent home in the mail for doing that because the cars who had the green light could probably have gone in front of me but like I said, I'm not sure if they would have been able to and I had pretty much really pressed the gas when the light was already red. Sorry if this is really confusing, it'd be easier to explain if I could draw exactly where I was.      So do you think I will get a ticket or not? At first I figured oh, the cop was right there and would have pulled me over right then and there but then later doubts crept up upon me and I thought that maybe he really had to get somewhere and a camera in his car caught the whole thing and a ticket will be sent to my house instead. Eeesh.

Taliban kill 'US spy' as 'gift to Obama'      MIRANSHAH, Pakistan (AFP) — Taliban militants beheaded an Afghan in Pakistan's lawless tribal region after accusing him of spying for the United States, local police said Thursday.      The 35-year-old man was kidnapped one week ago and his body found Thursday in Razmak some 65 kilometers (43 miles) south of Miranshah, the main town in North Waziristan, an official said.      "He was slaughtered overnight. His headless body was put on the roadside, police official Munir Khan told AFP.      A note found on the body of the man, identified as Shafiq Gul, said he was "spying for the US".      "Whoever spies for the US will face the same fate. This is a gift to (US President Barack) Obama," the note said.      Islamist militants frequently kidnap and kill local tribesmen and Afghans, on alleged charges of spying for the Pakistani government or for US forces, who are battling a Taliban-led insurgency across the border in Afghanistan.      Pakistan's rugged tribal regions have been wracked by violence since becoming a stronghold for hundreds of Taliban and Al-Qaeda rebels who fled across the border to escape the US-led invasion of Afghanistan in late 2001.      The new Obama administration is conducting a comprehensive strategy review in its war against Islamist extremists in Afghanistan and Pakistan.        http://www.google.com/hostednews/afp/art...

Not to mention that criminals don't care about following the laws.  They will still have weapons, one way or the other.  Banning assault weapons is absolutely idiotic to me.  I have every right to own the AR-15 in my safe.  What logical purpose is there for banning assault weapons when so few are even used in crimes?  What's next?  Is there going to be a ban on all guns?  Knives?  Baseball bats?  Staplers?  A sock with a bar of soap in it?  Anything can be used as a weapon, so where are the dems in office going to draw the line?

20090226174630AAeEDu3	Politics & Government;Civic Participation	Are the Republican Governor's cutting off their noses to spite their face?	The response to the Obama's speech from Indian-American Gov. Bobby Jindal as you all know by know was a comical disaster. Bobby Jindal aka "Kenneth the Page", the newly-tapped spokesperson of the Rush Limbaugh-led Republican Party, and a handful of Southern governors, took their stand on expanded unemployment benefits which make up about 2 percent of the economic recovery package.      This, despite the fact that economists from all political ideologies concluded that extending the length of time that workers can collect unemployment insurance benefits would be one of the most effective stimulus measures.      A 2008 Congressional Budget Office memo stated that it would be an effective measure for Congress to pass because "it seems likely that recipients would spend most of those benefits."      Mark Zandi, former economic adviser to Sen. John McCain's campaign, estimates that for every $1 invested in unemployment benefits assistance, $1.64 in economic activity is generated.      Gov. Jindal is being joined in this folly by Mississippi Gov. Haley Barbour and South Carolina Gov. Mark Sanford, whose states have high jobless rates and could use the most economic assistance.      Are they so opposed to anything Obama does that they will cut off their noses to spite their faces? Or are they just pathetic sore losers looking to get political points on the backs of the unemployed?
20090226175029AAuMjlR	Politics & Government;Politics	I think I might be...anti-death penalty...?	Or would pro-life be the term? (because technically, it's "for" life)      I've always thought of myself as pro-death penalty. Some people deserve punishment I thought.      But then I started thinking about it and asking myself some questions.      Like these:      Sure, you can say that you think the guilty should be punished, but let's say you were personally on a jury and had to decide whether someone deserves to live or die. (lets say there was the average amount of evidence pointing towards guilt)      Could you put someone to death?      Lets go one step further and say they wanted you to be the executioner, and kill the person yourself.       Since you're pro-death penalty, would you have any problems doing it? (the criminal was found guilty...)         I asked myself these questions and found that I could never take a human life myself, or sentence someone to death for that matter, no matter how guilty that person was.       And I don't like the "it's morally wrong if I do it, but okay if someone else does..." idea.      So I don't know what to think right now. I like justice, but not when I have to administer it.      Help?      Note: I'm fairly independent. A complete mix.

They were suppose to keep him safe while he was there, do we have any right to sue?   well, when he went into the hospital it was because he said he was going to kill himself. this hospital was suppose to keep watch and make rounds every 15-20 minutes at night. this was when he killed himself. the police that came and told us said they were called to the hospital at 4am but the coroners report said that the time of death was around 2am. there was a 2 hour period that he was dead before they found him, so i am guessing they did not make their rounds that night like they were suppose to, so i think that is negligence on their part, especially since their job is to keep them safe when they know they are suicidal.

20090226174620AAzdgIk	Politics & Government;Politics	How would you label me politically?	I think our political system is twisted between what I believe is conservative and liberal and republican and democrat.      For example, the war in iraq. To me it seems like a very liberal war, yet people label it a conservative war? How is it conservative when it is very costly and is intervention? Traditionally conservatives are for keeping spending down and keeping government intervention out of everyone's business (locally and internationally).       Another example is the Patriot Act. It seems to be very democratic b/c republicans are for less government involvement, yet it is considered to be republican.      That is why I have trouble labeling myself conservative or liberal and republican or democrat.      I am pro-universal healthcare (if done correctly), against the war in iraq, anti-abortion/death penalty, anti-abstinence only sex ed (i believe in pregnancy prevention to make abortions unnecessary), against bail outs and stimulus packages that don't directly create jobs, for oil drilling, against importing jobs and goods (keep it in the us), for strong border control, against affirmative action, for legalization of weed, against deficit spending, for investing in alternative energy (solar, wind, etc)...       So how would you label me?       ...I don't know if they will help, but I liked Ron Paul more than any other politician in the past election. If you need to know more about what I stand for then just ask and i'll respond.

20090226172920AA0jP2n	Politics & Government;Law & Ethics	Legal advice; car crash?	State of California driving laws required.      I was going east bound on a 2-lane main street, while the person that hit me is coming west bound on the same street. I'm in lane #2 (farthest from median) going straight, while the other driver is in lane #1 (one closest to median) making a left.       The light was green for both of us, meaning she is supposed to yield and I have the right away. We are both the same distance from the lights, both doing the speed limit.   Instead of yielding at a solid green light, instead she decides to speed up. Then we hit in the middle of the intersection!      She told the police I had my left turn signal on (which I didn't), but I was still in the straight away lane regardless. She also told my insurance agent the same thing. She then tells her agent a different story. That I was in the left lane now, trying to go left...So now, her insurance is saying they're most likely going to dismiss the claim because it's "he-said-she-said". Now, my car is totaled all in the front and she only has a medium sized dent on her right front fender.      The police all(3) said that It looked like she was at fault by the stories. I am planning on getting written statements from all or most of them.   I had 2 passengers with me, they both saw what happened...but they're of no use, because of the "biased friend" thing. I took pictures of my car the moment after the accident. Then, came back 2 weeks later (today) to take pictures of the left-behind tire marks from all the oil on the tires when it gushed out after the hit. It shows i was going straight, then veered off to the right side of the road so I wouldn't block traffic. The reason I waited so long to take the pictures of the aftermath, is because I barely heard the news today that the other insurance company is , and I quote, "Most likely going to dismiss this claim...".       I am collecting as much evidence to take the party at fault to court. Is there anything else I can do to make sure my case goes smooth, along with all the evidence I have so far? Is it possible to take the other person's insurance to court also? Any and every piece of advice will help, thank you.

She says shes going to kick them out if they show up, but if that happens, they told her they are going to call the cops. so i have a few questions about what happens if the cops show up:      1) A lot of people are telling her that cops need a warrant to get into her house. Is that true? And if it is true what should everyone at the party do?      2) If the cops do come into the house, what will they do? Will they just kick everyone out or will they call your parents too?      3) Is it better to stay inside the house, or run if the cops come?

20090226174204AAJUAeH	Politics & Government;Law & Ethics	Is shoplifting not a serious crime anymore or what?	My parents own a store and recently there have been a surge of shoplifters.      We have a security camera and we have even had an incident where a young mother came into the store with a stroller and tucked over $100 of goods beside her baby inside the blanket. Upon calling the cops, the cops let her walk out of the store with the goods, took her name down and said that she will only be charged if she dose it again. what I don't understand is why are they allowed to walk away with the stolen goods?      This also happens whenever teens steal items. The police will come and say that it's the shoplifters choice wiether to return the goods or not, then they call there parents and once again let them off with a warning.      Now I go to school and learn about all this, "you get caught stealing once and it goes on your record forever." and "you won't be able to find a job after stealing"       Obviously from what I've seen, this is obviously not true. I live in Cananda ontario by the way... is this acually how the system works? Steal once, walk away with the goods then get a warning to never do it again?

20090226175017AAen2cn	Politics & Government;Law Enforcement & Police	Is there a deadline between when one is accused of "disorderly conduct" and when the charges can be filed?	Here is what happened:   A friend of mine smashed around five pumpkins in his suburban neighborhood and then went to WaWa. When he drove back into the neighborhood he was pulled over by a cop who accused him of throwing a pumpkin in someones yard, which really isn't a big deal to begin with. (which he definitely did not do). Actually he knew who did this, it was one of his other friends.       The cop looks in the bed of his truck and sees a small piece of wood (which was from a decoration attached to one of the pumpkins) and a few pumpkin stems. He then makes a comment about my friend breaking mailboxes. He lets him go and the next day my friend picked up the pumpkins because he felt bad.  Well, this happened in November of 2008.       In January of 2009 the same cop caught my friend and some other guys spray painting the school rock (which is meant to be spray painted for school spirit) They spray painted "vote for john" on it. Well the cop tells them they have to stop "F***ing around" in the middle of the night (it was around 10:00 pm) and find better things to do with their time. They were showing school spirit for heavens sake!       Well what do you know, a few weeks after this he gets a letter in the mail stating that someone had filed a complaint regarding pumpkins being thrown in a neighborhood. He is charged with a disorderly conduct and in the report the officer states that "They admitted to smashing pumpkins and there were pieces of pumpkin and a mailbox in the truck-bed"       First: It is not illegal to have pumpkins or a piece of wood in the back of a truck bed. (And the piece of wood wasn't even from a mailbox).   Second: It stated that someone filed a complaint... however, there were no other people involved in the dispute so no one could have filed a complaint.   Third: He smashed five pumpkins and picked them up the next morning. Would he really be found guilty of disorderly conduct?      My question: Is there a time limit or deadline between when someone is "caught" for an action and when someone can file a disorderly conduct charge for that action??   (It appears as if someone just randomly filed the complaint months after the action took place, isn't there a time limit between when they can do this)       My Opinion: The world is getting more and more ridiculous every day. Cops are wasting their time and ours when they make a big deal out of things like this. The cop should have just told the kid to pick up the five small pumpkins...just my opinion. I feel that I keep seeing on the news people being charged for the most ridiculous things.

20090226190948AADP6Kk	Politics & Government;Elections	What do you think about Mr. Obama's spending, budget, redistribution of wealth, and other decisions thus far?	I did not vote for him and although I have never made over $250,000, I think that taxing the rich to finance his extensive budget will backfire - the rich can just move overseas and we will not see any of their tax money.  Also, in his stimulus and budget, where is the scalpel?  He stated in the debate that he will go over the budget line by line with a scalpel - and yet they approved that gigantic stimulus package so fast, there is no way anyone read and analyzed it all.      Since I am in the middle - making more than minimal wage but less than $250,000 and always pay my taxes, I guess I have to prepare for a bumpy ride because I won't get much but expect higher prices on everything - products and services - as he taxes businesses more.

I've known my friend 4  15 yrs, and the b/f for 4 yrs. something happened, it got out of hand, I hit in the leg, not very hard his kid in the leg because he threw a shoe at my head, for taking the febreeze away from him. His father gets home,  goes ape sh!t and threatens to have his ex wife and daughters beat me because I gently I might ad hit his kid. This man I believe to be a drunk, cant wait to have a beer till like 10 am. I left a number of things there. I felt threatend, I thought he was going to do something. I know he has a gun in the house. Hes a balla in the ghetto. II was scaredand left in a hurry with a cab. I left behind a 350.00 ring from zales that I know he or someone has pawned already. 6 dvds and like 6 cds. Don't care much about that stuff I want my ring or 350.00. This incident was over 3 months ago. I dont act that way towards my niece and nephew. His kids are reallllyyyyyy bad, even stole from me while I was there. I made cookies with them, did crafts with them etc. Do I have a right to file a police report, and or take him to small claims court. Should I leave it alone, and forget the past. my friend is no longer talking to me after 15 yrs of friendship.

20090226182604AAkjf51	Politics & Government;Law & Ethics	Sexual assault questions.?	My friend has recently been slapped with sexual assault charges (for which he is 100% innocent). He has been banned from a local karaoke nightly gathering and the school that this person goes to because of this as well.       I have a limited amount of time to type this, so I'll get straight to the point.      Question 1.) - Even though he hasn't been charged or convicted of anything, why can they ban him from certain places if he hasn't even been charged with anything and why is HE the one banned from these places and not her? If he were to actually go to these places, would he be arrested?      Question 2.) - Is there any advice you can give him on getting through this and the legal battle that will follow?       Question 3.) - Anything else you can say?      Thank you.

20090226185134AAu60Rt	Politics & Government;Government	Have you heard of he new law Obama wants to push through?	Basically, Obama is currently trying to push through an all inclusive bill protecting human rights. I have no problem with this except for one small part. There is an addition to this bill that prohibits a parent from invading their child's privacy.       So basically this means if my son/daughter is smoking crack, having sex with their boyfriend/girlfriend, or getting ready to blow their brains out I can't kick in the door to stop them without telling the police and getting a warrant. And before anyone starts saying that I'm going over the top the bill clearly states, "A parent may not invade or violate the privacy of anyone living within the household for any reason that might want to be kept private."

20090225121118AAnxbNJ	Politics & Government;Law & Ethics	Robertson was not aware he was being recorded at the time and thus spoke with extreme frankness. Is he rightly?	Is he rightly exposed as a Anti-christ with the mark of the wild beast?       "Hmmm. That sounds like a takeover of government! It’s important to remember that Robertson was not aware he was being recorded at the time and thus spoke with extreme frankness. (Americans United later released a tape of the closed-door session, and news media outlets across the country reported the information.) He put his goals right out there before a friendly crowd. It sure sounded like a theocratic platform to many.   Of course we don’t want a merger of mosque and state in America. But we don’t want a merger of Robertson’s brand of Christianity and state either. We need to protect religious liberty for all but with the understanding that the power of government will back no particular sectarian view. The best way to do that is to maintain a high and firm wall of separation between church and state."   The above "a tape  of the closed-door session" is kind of long but in the end said, "The cast of characters has changed, but the script is still the same," said Lynn. "Pat Robertson is still driving for a controlling voice in the Republican Party and the U.S. government. If he succeeds, this play could have a tragic ending." See the whole thing if you have time:    http://www.au.org/site/News2?abbr=cs_&pa...    Like Divine Truth ask, Is Pat Robertson an Anti-christ HYPOCRITE? If Pat in truth followed Christ example would he even get mixed in human government business noting what Jesus said at Matthew 4:8-10 as to who Pat would have to worship if he is mixing in human government unlike the one he says he follows! Jesus would not mix and he is our example! The Devil said, “All these things (human nations) I will give you if you fall down and do an act of worship to me.” "if you fall down and do an act of worship" That would have made Jesus a Devil worshiper! So what does that make Pat Robertson since he is trying to make human government into God's kingdom which Jesus did not try to do or tell his followers to do?    http://blog.au.org/2007/03/20/holy-hypoc...    Revelation shows religious leaders in our day would have great power over world rulers. And they the nations will use the U.N. to end that ungodly power, off their backs! Revelation 17:15-18, "15 And he says to me: “The waters that you saw, where the harlot (religion mixing in human government is unclean like a sick harlot) is sitting, mean peoples and crowds and nations and tongues. (great influence over people) 16 And the ten horns (nations that hate religion mixing in government) that you saw, and the wild beast, (the United Nations) these will hate the harlot and will make her devastated and naked, and will eat up her fleshy parts and will completely burn her with fire. (take ALL she has away from her [IRS?]) 17 For God put [it] into their hearts to carry out his thought, even to carry out [their] one thought by giving their kingdom to the wild beast, (U.N.) until the words of God will have been accomplished. 18 And the woman whom you saw means the great city that has a kingdom over the kings of the earth.” (Religious leaders have great power over government leaders as Pat Robertson and other clergy have, not by God's will!) The mark of the wild beast really means people in government (mark on forehead) or back human government (vote for or mark on hand). Revelation 17:5,6 "5 And upon her forehead was written a name, a mystery: “Babylon the Great, the mother of the harlots and of the disgusting things of the earth.” 6 And I saw that the woman was drunk with the blood of the holy ones and with the blood of the witnesses of Jesus." And Jesus is a Jehovah's Witness and the Pat Robertson (kind) is drunk with the blood of Jehovah's people today around the world as true history shows! They do not mix in government business for the same reason Jesus did not, because God's kingdom does not come by way of human government as Daniel 2:44 shows is a fact! Have Jehovah's Witnesses show you their year book of 1975 page 188 at heading to see what bad influence religious leaders had over leaders in America in the 1940's! Babylon the Great of Revelation is no mystery to Jehovah's Witnesses! I will make a hard copy of this info to fax, mail and email to others!

20090225120151AAK1ghV	Politics & Government;Law & Ethics	What are the chances Tom Ammiano's bill to legalize marijuana in California is passed?	There are 51 out of 80 Dems in the lower assembly, 25 out of 40 in the upper assembly, so 11 Dems in the lower and 5 in the upper could vote against it and it would still pass. I highly doubt that the Governator would veto such a bill. But then the federal government could invalidate the whole thing if they decided to enforce the Illegal Substances Act in California.      I'd love to hear an answer from someone with some expertise, rather than just see this degenerate into an argument over whether weed should/shouldn't be legal.

Its State Certified and all of the police departments in the area send their recruits there. But I plan to move back to my home town in Arkansas after I graduate. My question is when I talked to the local police department back home they told me that going to a police academy on your own with out being sent by a police department was a stupid idea.. that it would be a complete waste of money because no one will accept my schooling if I put myself through it. The only way any police department would ever accept it is if they sent me there through their application process? Is this true? I am about to spend 7000 dollars to send me through this academy because I have always dreamed of a career in this field but now to find out its a waste of my time and money kinda ticks me off? Is this guys just full of crap and doesnt know what he's talking about or is he right?? any info would help me a ton!! Thanks!!!!

(In this case a percentage of the estate value).  He mentioned the hourly fee in the initial discussion but his letter of agreement now mentions a 'responsibility fee' in addition to this.  Of course he won't estimate the number of hours (a licence to print money?) and the responsibility percentage fee itself is likely to be thousands.  I can't find reference to this term anywhere online as a usual fee that is charged in probate? Can anyone enlighten me as to whether this sort of approach is normal please? Thanks in advance.

Even though I'm conservative, the war in Iraq is a waste; however, Obama should get no credit of Bush's accomplishment of giving Iraq democracy( well at least temporarily). If you look at the very end it'll say "An existing U.S-Iraq agreement, negotiated under President George W. Bush, calls for U.S. combat troops to withdraw from Baghdad and other cities by the end of June, with all American forces out of the country by the end of 2011."      so my question is: Liberals/democrats are you happy with this? If you are... so much for "change". and if your not with it, then too bad. rofl.

20090226181130AAo9a2S	Politics & Government;Civic Participation	Should Republican voters be held more responsible?	Perhaps if we held them a bit more responsible they might vote a bit differently. What if we took a look at voter registration and then doled out health care, food stamps,unemployment and any kind of government assistance according to their party with none of these going to the Republicans. Since they are against all forms of helping anyone I guess they would not have to worry. They can live off their ideology and perhaps Rush Limbaugh could feed them, he could afford to give some away.
20090226183801AAjuaTA	Politics & Government;Politics	What political party should I join?	I am pro guns, pro-choice. I am pro-military and am for a large well funded military and am not afraid to go to war and fight, have twice already. I am pro-environment and think global warming is a bad thing. I am pro-gay rights and do not care if they want to marry. I am anti-Immigration and anti-trade. I am a fiscal moderate and do not mind that my taxes go to social programs as long as they help others and are not too high. I voted for Reagan and Clinton. I did not vote Obama but he is fine with me. Obviously I am not fit for either party so would independent be my party? Besides I am my own person and no party controls my thoughts.

"We have known for decades that our survival depends on finding new sources of energy. Yet we import more oil today than ever before." - Preventing domestic energy production is DNC policy. Not just oil, either. "Alternatives" are fine as long as it's spending tax money on research but they BALK actually implementing them.      "The cost of health care eats up more and more of our savings each year" - driving up cost is an inevitable consequence of distorting the market to create a preference for "third party" payers; DNC policy.      "Our children will compete for jobs in a global economy that too many of our schools do not prepare them for." - any changes to which are ALWAYS resisted by 100% of the Democrat Caucus.

I can assure you that the rich (myself) and the poor (obamians) will be poorer in 4 years.  Their little 401k's are about worthless now and soon interest rates will be climbing to fight inflation so the cost to borrow will be higher and just when they feel like they may have something going on so they can be rich too they will be hit with all those new capital gains taxes and income taxes.

In america, experiencing the fredom and paradise of the american dream it is hard to think about the wrong doings going on over there. so mr.udall i want you to think about what it would be like to be in darfur right now. Your town. you home that you grew up in your whole life. Ransacked. burned to the ground. the woman in your town raped then killed. y our men simply killed. now i wont bore you with facts like 70,000 dead in a 7 month period. 7 months out of a 26 month conflict. now sir i am doing the best i can right now. And at the age of fourteen it's more convinient to think aobut the girls that might like me, or the girls that i like. but im thinking aobut darfur. This is the best i can do short of flying over to darfur and helping my self. but at the age of fourteen i cant do that. i cant and if i could i would. but you mr.udall and to anyone who you show this letter too you have the power. you can make a bill. you can propose to congress. And if you can't america deserves better, darfur deserves better. THese people need help. you probably get zillions of e-mails and letters a day dealing with the misplaced stop signs and people complaining about the stimulous bill. so mr.mark udall member of the united states senate. and a man with the power to change the lifes of the people of darfur i ask you sir. i ask you to help change the world. now might not be the most convient time with the economic stimulous taking place and such. we need to take care of our own country first. blah blah. these people are dieing mr.udall. and i need your help to change the World

But for some weird reason, we're fighting over who can do more worse ; Police or the Dean of our school, keep in mind he's a middle school dean.

20090226183951AAEOMIk	Politics & Government;Law Enforcement & Police	I recently got a ticket, just need some advice?	Well it was around 10:50pm when I was heading to drop off 4 of my friends to there home. On the way to there house I noticed this one cop kept following me so I drove very safe. I made a full stop on a stop sign and proceeded and that was when the cop rung its sirens. He said he pulled me over because I did not make a full stop ( I believe this was just an excuse to pull me over). So he asked for my license, registration, and insurance ( which I had) and told me that i could not drive anyone until 12 months after I got my license. Then he asked if anyone was on probation and my friend was, so he searched us and the car and didn't find anything ( took 1 hour). He also made me take a breathalyzer which I passed. In the end he gave me a ticket for violating my restrictions (12814.6 (b)(1).        So I am wondering if I can fight this ticket in any way because the cop pulled me over even though I made a full stop (Anyone will have the common sense to drive according to the law if a cop was following you).  I have witnesses as well. Thanks guys, will appreciate any support.
