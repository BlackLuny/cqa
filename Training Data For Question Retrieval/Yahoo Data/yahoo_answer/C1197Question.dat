Well, I'm a 15 year old girl with long thin arms, and really small hands with short, stubby fingers. I can't do long nails really because the white part is about a half a centimeter long before my nails even reach over my fingers tips, and its kind of hard to play piano and guitar and stuff with long nails, on top of the fact that they're really weak and break and peel. So there probably isn't, but is there any way I can make my short stubby hands look thinner and more elegant?

First of all, yesterday I woke up with a HUGE pimple right smack dab in the middle of my forehead.  I tried everything, from honey to salt water to lemon juice, even my Proactiv refining mask.  I also put on some pimple cream stuff.  What else can I do??? It's hideous! :(      Also, I need some ideas for makeup.  I'm wearing a light minty green dress but I'm wearing hot pink accessories to spice it up a bit.  I want to use some hot pink liquid eyeliner that I have (if I can find it in my room...) and maybe even some black eyeliner...but I don't want to look like a hooker. So any tips for how to use the hot pink liner in a way that looks elegant? (HA. Right.) And other makeup tips. Oh by the way, I have green eyes and dark reddish-brown hair, in case that's important :]      As for my hair, I'm just going to curl it, put a (hot pink) tiara on, and take some hair on each side and twist it around the tiara.      Oh, and I got these new flats but I wore them yesterday and they kind of hurt.  I wore some of those special socks with them, but it didn't help.  What else can I do so my feet won't hurt from dancing?      Anyway, any tips are helpful.  Thanks :D

20090131115736AAWRg2V	Beauty & Style;Hair	Help with problem at work.?	I am a hair dresser and i'm having an issue with my co-worker. I have confronted  my boss about it but she hasn't resolved the issue. I believe she has talked to the person, but it was short lived. The person talks down to me and other clients, make remarks under the breath  (that you can still hear). You never know what will set the person off. I confronted them about an issue and all that did was make things worse. What should be my next step.

20090131132050AA8cYDd	Beauty & Style;Hair	Too old for braided ponytails?	I have long, wavy hair and ever since I can remember I have been wearing it in some sort of a braid quite often. Even though I'll soon be 20, sometimes I even wear it in 2 braids "like a little girl" (especially these past months when I was on crutches and my friends and I decided it would look cute with the signed cast, flat shoe on my good foot and decorated crutches LOL but now I'm back to normal finally!). I like the way it looks on me and so do my friends but sometimes I have this thing where I think I'm being silly by wearing braids like that and should change my style. Sometimes I'll wear the braids starting in the morning to match a cute outfit and sometimes I just braid my ponytails for fun even if I'm wearing clothing that looks well, different with my hair that way.      I see movie stars doing it and it looks cute but I'm the only one on campus who seems to be so into braids lol.      Thanks everyone; hope I'm not being silly.

There are people out there who actually pull out their hair so be glad you don't actually pull out your hair!

20090131173000AA6mXtZ	Beauty & Style;Fashion & Accessories	How would I go about making this shirt?	I bought some amazing golden yellow satin fabric and I've finally found something I want to make with it. Here are two pictures. If you scroll down on the websites you can see a bigger picture of the shirts.    https://www.shoprumor.com/product.php?pr...  and  https://www.shoprumor.com/product.php?pr...    In the first picture it looks like there are side seams. On the top piece and the bottom piece. So I'll assume that there are also seams on the other side. With the top piece my question is should I include a zipper some where? Maybe with the seam on the side? I can't tell if these shirts have a zipper or not. But satin isn't stretchy at all and I would like a fitting top. Also, I don't need two side seams really. But would it look weird with only one side seam? Ugh. :)    On to the bottom 'bubble skirt" type piece. Again, one seam or a seam on each side? I think I have the pockets figured out. I hope. I'm thinking for the bubble effect sewing in a piece of elastic then folding it up and under to sit on my waist. That should give me the bubble effect and I can't find an easier way to do it.     Also, what the heck should I do about lining?! I don't want the shirt too bulky but I don't want it too thin. I have 2 yards of the fabric so I have enough to make the lining out of the satin with the right side facing my body. Hmm.    I'm sorry this is the longest question in the world. But if you have any tips or tricks please send them my way. Also if you could find any more pictures that would be amazing. I've searched everywhere but I can't seem to find a cute top with pockets. I'm not really a fan of the straps but this shirt seems difficult enough and I'm only good at sewing not great. lol     Oh sorry one more thing. :) It looks like there are pleats at the top of the bottom piece... Do you think those go all the way around? Gosh I hate pleats. lol If anyone finds a super cute satin top on the internet that looks easier let me know. I'll really consider something easier.     Thanks everyone!

The length of my hair is '6-7 inches above waist'. I have thin hair. My scalp is dry. Every time i comb my hair, i notice great loss of hair. I put oil after and before every head wash. Also i massage very gently. Currently using Parachute therapy oil. There is no specific time/season of hair loss in my case. I don't remain depressed/tensed about anything. I am a very easy going and fun loving person. I am healthy physically as well as mentally. I eat all vegetables,  I drink milk every morning. I love to eat fresh fruits. Basically i am north-indian, working in mumbai in Siemens currently. But i don't think that my hair loss problem is coz of place/water change coz i had the same problem in north too when i was staying there. Its not hereditary also. Its been years that i am suffering from this problem. Its first time i am posting my query to you and will be really grateful to you if i will get a genuine reply from your side. Please suggest !

20090225172506AAtZ1wc	Beauty & Style;Other - Beauty & Style	Asking a girl out in high school, please help! help an ignorant teenage guy.?	so i've had the hunch that she likes me for a long time (laughing at all my jokes smiling talking all that, eye contact) but today it seemed like i was getting a really strong vibe during study hall, we would glance up every so often and get eye contact and she was looking at me like girls do when they're trying to flirt with their eyes.      but she also started laughing at her spanish homework and showed me the book (and only me, though there were other friends at that table). it said something like describe how you would ask out a date for the senior banquet or something along those lines. i didn't really think it was funny but smiled at her into her eyes.      so was she asking me to ask her out or what? i want to ask her out, she's gorgeous and really cool. but be impartial, maybe she just likes me as a friend.      was she hinting that i ask her out?      and also if i do i'll be asking her tomorrow. what about a movie with friends there? Inkheart? or any better ideas? also what do i wear when asking her out, just the normal? and what are the lines i should give her? should i tell her i like her and then ask her or let her figure it out on her own?

20090101124353AApVH7a	Beauty & Style;Other - Beauty & Style	Should I switch schools?	Ok so I go to a really small school. There are only about 50 people in my grade. I have about 5 friends and I really don't like it. Last year, I had more friends but they left to go to public schools. I want to go to a bigger school in my area where I would have the opportunity to have more friends. Now there is a slight problem. In the past when I have gone to a bigger school, I have had troubles making friends. I can be kind of shy. At the beginning of the year, I went to a bigger public school and left after about a month because I did not like it. But now I really don't like the small school I go to now. I did have the option to go back when I was at the bigger school and I always thought about going back to my old school(small) when something bad happened. So I chose to and just gave up. If I were to switch again, I would not have that option.           I really just want more friends and I think that the bigger school would give me that. I think I would have a different perspective because I would not have another option. The small school is just making my life more miserable than it should be. I am just bored. So what do you think I should do?

20081017144756AAiHhAq	Beauty & Style;Hair	Questions for Hair and Body?	I'm not sure about opinions so...I'm asking.   I personally hate my leg hair.    And Armpit hair.   I have a lot of leg hair compared to friends.   But I'm not a wookie...hairy enough to choke a cat.   I still hate it though.   It looks filthy, and it catches on my Roller Blades, aside from that, It also snags in my skinny jeans. D:   But In my actual point, what will people think if I shave that all off?   I'm 14 and entering High School next year.   And I know about all those answers "Just do what you want! It's your body and noone has the right to judge you for it!"   Well I know that, and nobody really says anything about it.   But I wanna know what they think so I can decide to keep it or shave it.   And Arm pit hair? Opinions? I'm gonna trim it in the least.   Two more things,   How do you darken Stubble?   I shave often, Every morning.   But no matter what, the hair is always white except for a few.   I've let it grow out in 6th, But it was kinda weird since the stache was the most obvious and everyone kept asking how I grew it. xD   I have a lotion that slowed the amount grown, and it's still taking affect.    Won't be shaving every day...   Also, once I start making money.   I'm gonna cross dress. Fer sure I'll shave it all then.   How do women get a smooth body? My legs are rough, and it's disturbing.
