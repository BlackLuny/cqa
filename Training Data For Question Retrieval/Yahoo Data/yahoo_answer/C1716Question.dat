London, Feb 19 (ANI): Hunters are tracking a family of Yetis after reports that the creatures are living in a mountain cave complex in a Russian town.According to a report in the Daily Star, sightings have been made near the remote Russian mining town of Tashtagol in Siberia.    The animals are said to be more than 6ft tall with ginger-black hair and leave large, distinctive footprints that include toe marks."There have been reports over the years about these creatures, but the number has increased dramatically," said Galina Pustogacheva, spokesman for the town. "We have had more than 10 sightings in recent weeks," she added.    The creatures have been seen walking on two legs by villagers from the hamlets of Elbeza and Kabarza and tourists visiting the region around the Azass caves on Mount Shoriya.    "People here are scared the creatures will attack villages because of hunger," said Nikita Shulbayev, deputy head of the local administration."We made a decision to send an expedition to research this issue. We need to understand whether they are dangerous for people. We need to calm people down," she added.    "Scientists from Kemerovo University will help us discover what the creatures are - whether they are a rare kind of bear or a surviving primate from pre-historic times," she informed.

Why are 2,500 languages threatened with extinction?       PARIS (AFP) – The world has lost Manx in the Isle of Man, Ubykh in Turkey and last year Alaska's last native speaker of Eyak, Marie Smith Jones, died, taking the aboriginal language with her.    Of the 6,900 languages spoken in the world, some 2,500 are endangered, the UN's cultural agency UNESCO said Thursday as it released its latest atlas of world languages. There are 199 languages in the world spoken by fewer than a dozen people, including Karaim which has six speakers in Ukraine and Wichita, spoken by 10 people in the US state of Oklahoma. The last four speakers of Lengilu talk among themselves in Indonesia.       India tops the list of countries with the greatest number of endangered languages, 196 in all, followed by the United States which stands to lose 192 and Indonesia, where 147 are in peril. Australian linguist Christopher Moseley, who headed the atlas' team of 25 experts, noted that countries with rich linguistic diversity like India and the United States are also facing the greatest threat of language extinction.       Certain languages are even showing signs of a revival, like Cornish, a Celtic language spoken in Cornwall, southern England, and Sishee in New Caledonia.       UNESCO deputy director Francoise Riviere applauded government efforts to support linguistic diversity but added that "people have to be proud to speak their language" to ensure it thrives.        http://news.yahoo.com/s/afp/20090219/ts_...

WASHINGTON – Transportation Secretary Ray LaHood says he wants to consider taxing motorists based on how many miles they drive rather than how much gasoline they burn — an idea that has angered drivers in some states where it has been proposed.      "We should look at the vehicular miles program where people are actually clocked on the number of miles that they traveled," the former Illinois Republican lawmaker said.      The system would require all cars and trucks be equipped with global satellite positioning technology, a transponder, a clock and other equipment to record how many miles a vehicle was driven, whether it was driven on highways or secondary roads, and even whether it was driven during peak traffic periods or off-peak hours.      The device would tally how much tax motorists owed depending upon their road use. Motorists would pay the amount owed when it was downloaded, probably at gas stations at first, but an alternative eventually would be needed.       http://news.yahoo.com/s/ap/20090220/ap_o... 
20090220062556AAlvgpV	News & Events;Current Events	Is Obama endangering the USA?	Here are some recent comments by Bill O'Reilly.  After reading this, would you answer this question ?  "Are you fearful for our nation now that Obama is at the helm?"        "Thursday, February 19, 2009    Joseph Biden is a prophet. On October 19, 2008, the now-Vice President said, "Mark my words. It will not be six months before the world tests Barack Obama like they did John Kennedy."      Forget about six months; the foreign affairs insults arrived within three weeks of Obama's presidency. And with the economy dominating the news cycle, very little attention has been paid.       Let's take them one by one.      By far, the most important insult to the Obama administration came this week. Shortly after Obama's envoy, Richard Holbrooke, visited Pakistan, that country surrendered to the Taliban and al-Qaeda, putting the entire world in danger.      In a shocking abdication of responsibility, the Pakistani government now says the Taliban has the authority to impose sharia law in the northern part of that country. That means the Pakistani government is allowing these terrorists to do whatever they want, and that will include continuing their attacks on American forces in neighboring Afghanistan.      This is huge, and President Obama would be wise to respond quickly and punish the Pakistani government. They have thrown in with terror killers; the USA cannot accept that, nor should any responsible country.      Insult two: The government of Kyrgyzstan is closing the big U.S. air base on its soil. That air base supplies NATO forces in Afghanistan. Again, this is huge.      The reason the base is being closed is because the Russian tyrant, Putin, doesn't like America assisting nations like Poland and the Ukraine in their defense strategies. So Putin, who the Kyrgyzstan government fears, has succeeded in hurting NATO's war against the Taliban. Nice.      The third insult comes from Iran. No surprise here. While the mullahs yak about talking with President Obama, they continue to fast-track nuclear weapons. A report by the Institute for Science and International Security says that Iran could have weapons-grade nuclear material this year. So there is now an urgency to the situation and Obama must respond quickly or the nuke genie will be out of the bottle.      And finally, insult four: Crazy Kim Jong-Il, the leader of North Korea, celebrated his 67th birthday this week by threatening a nuclear missile test.      Again, because of the terrible economy, many Americans have no idea all of this stuff is going on, but there is no question Barack Obama is being tested and the villains are watching closely to see what he will do.      In his speech last October, Joseph Biden also told Americans to "gird [their] loins." I'm not exactly sure what that means vis-à-vis foreign policy, but it doesn't sound good. I also don't know whether President Obama is "girding" right now, but he had better be doing something. "      End of O'Reilly's report.........are you AFRAID of our new leadership?

A fourteen year old has suffered 1st degree burns after spending 19 minutes on a tanning bed, in a salon that was unstaffed.      The place had warning signs stating that you have to be over sixteen to use the beds and the fourteen year old has admitted that she saw them, but still chose to use the beds.      A consultant dermatologist said it is the view of both the British Association of Dermatologists and the British Medical Association Cymru Wales that unstaffed tanning salons should be banned.       However Mr Hadley the owner has said "It's an unfortunate incident. We do feel for the girl but she shouldn't have gone on for that length of time.

20090220064641AApz0tI	News & Events;Current Events	Do you think Osama bin Laden can be found in this manner?	Methinks its a bit far fetched...      A Californian geography professor has used techniques for hunting endangered species to pinpoint three houses in Pakistan where Osama bin Laden could be hiding.       Using patterns of how animal species spread, the world's most wanted terrorist can be tracked down to a town in the tribal region of North West Pakistan it is claimed.       By factoring in his need for security, electricity, high ceilings to accommodate his 6ft 4in frame and spare rooms for his bodyguards, the search can be further narrowed to three walled compounds.        http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnew...

20090220045211AAo3zt4	News & Events;Current Events	Obama wants to ban 'hate speech'...?	Since reading about Fred Phelps on the BBC news website today I have been reading through some of his thoughts on America, The World...everything.      So he believes that Obama banning 'hate speech' is going to cast him in to 'fiery pits of brimstone' along with The Pope.       Now personally, I feel that if Obama wants to ban hate speech in the form of what West Boro Baptist Church deems acceptable, then so be it. It repulses me that they are allowed to stand and say how long Matthew Shepard has been in hell, declare Princess Diana as a 'whore' and denounce Obama to the extent that they do. Everyone should have their opinions...but surely theirs just incite homophobic hatred?       So back to my point. Do you feel as though Obama should ban hate speech? Please don't base this on your personal opinions of Obama, just how you feel about hate speech being banned.

20090220043353AAiraDr	News & Events;Current Events	Why isn`t there a forum for suggestions on current events or news. Like spankings in MO. classrooms?	To me that is absurd. The teachers and the parents should get together and set a punishment and stick by it. It is NOT a teacher`s place to hit a child!!! EVER!!! Parents should let the teachers know what they use to punish their child at home. Whether it is 2 days of no TV, no bike, No visiting or visitor, no mall, no x-box- no downtown, no basketball, or favorite thing. They should follow up at home with these instructions and put some rules down. Not spankings!! You all should work together to punish for wrong-doing.. but NOT to touch a child in that way.. If anyone spanks it should be a parent!! If a teacher touched my child I think I would touch that teacher.. Sorry! Keep your hands or paddles off the kids! It is their kids not yours!!!  My humble opinion. You work as a team you`ll get further ahead. Parents need to be notified there is a problem and address it with the school. Those that refuse to help the school, maybe aren`t concerned parents at all. If you care you work together as a community as a teacher as a parent. Team work!

20090220071710AA3we13	News & Events;Current Events	How long a sentence do you think this man deserves for driving under influence?	As sad & tragic it is that this man was desperate enough to attempt suicide, isn't it terribly sad that Stryker had to die saving him?      Los Angeles, Feb 20 (DPA) A man who sent a police dog to its death as it was trying to prevent him from committing suicide has been sentenced to 44 months in jail, the San Diego Tribune has reported.    Cory Byron, 27, was attempting to jump off the Coronado Bridge in San Diego Dec 31, 2007, after driving drunkenly through traffic. A police office trying to apprehend him saw Byron's suicide bid and released police dog Stryker to intercept.    As Byron got ready to jump off the bridge, Stryker locked his teeth onto his arm and both plunged some 70 meters into the waters below.    Byron survived the fall and was rescued, but the dog died.    He pleaded guilty last September to one count each of felony evading and driving under the influence. He also entered a no-contest plea to a misdemeanour charge of harming a service animal. He told the court that he did not realise the dog had fallen with him.    California highway patrol officers say Byron's blood-alcohol level was more than twice the legal limit. He has been in jail since the incident and could be released later this year.
