The people are warm and kind, the beaches are beautiful,and Cristo Redentor in Rio- AMAZING!|`|6CAsx3jaaa	i think brazil is awesome. i live in the atlanta area and i had never met brazilians before this. the women ive met are beautiful and the guys seem cool. id love to visit the beaches there. i think the people there seem to be more open thna here. your language is kind of hard to learn . im learning spanish now but portugeese looks hard|`|23acba1cc80dfd3fa75981cc4908eba9aa	well i have not been there yet but my husband is brazilian and i love him. we are going to go visit his family within the next year.
pcHp7Dgkaa	There isn't any direct equivalent but it seems to be between an advanced diploma and a 3 year degree.The equivalence would depend very much upon the field of study and is more likely to be equivalent to a TAFE (vocational) qualification than a university qualification.  It isn't mentioned in the entrance requirements for any of the Australian universities I investigated as it is a work based qualification. A-Levels  are the direct equivalent to our high school university entrance qualification and you probably know how it compares to them.
ZRG7wEf9aa	In January we ordered a birthday cake for a family that was traveling with us.  It cost $15, was just a single layer, and served the 8 at the table with a bit left over.  I agree with you, paying for cake on a ship is like flushig money down the toilet.  I've been on Holland several times, but never bought a cake.  Unless you bought a wedding package that included a special wedding cake, I wouldn't do it.    I can't imagine it being a multi-tier beautiful cake.  You'd probably do better ordering it from a land based bakery, or just skipping in altogether.|`|94b8KImYaa	I thought you ordered your cake from a baker in St. Thomas ? <br>  <br>  Best is you call the cruise line and ask. The first question to you will be, how big the cake should be/how many people you have at the reception, and what kind of cake you want.|`|AA11850523	contact the  cruise  line and ask them for a price<br>  <br>  I ordered a birthday cake from Celebrity- it was $30 <br>  quite large ( enough for 8 people) and very tasty
DbTJruA2aa	Yes Tasmania can be dry and much of it is in drought right now and we have bush fires like the rest of the county, in 1967 massive bush fires killed 62 around Hobart and there are bush fires each year. We do however have more water resources per person than possibly the rest of Australia combined due to the average wetter winters the large number of natural and man made lakes in the central highlands which are also used to provide most of our energy needs by Hyrdo electricity, we do not have water restrictions or even water meters on our houses in Hobart<br>  <br>  Cairns and Nth Queensland can experience a level of droughwhichch is all too often broken by floods in the wet season<br>  <br>  Forest cover varies from a low 10% in Western Australia to a high of 50% in Tasmania with major areas along the great Dividing Range still well covered, the native forest has evolved to cope with the droughts and fires and is generally more spread out than forests elsewhere|`|4f3GfrN6aa	Tassie is temperate rainforest, a lot like Victoria.  In the summer, it dries out, and because the eucalyptus trees that comprise the forests are full of volatile, flammable oils, the place can potentially burn like hell.  In fact, a few years ago, I think, Tassie had some pretty significant bushfires.<br>  <br>  Rather than 'drought' per se, I think that some tropical areas are experiencing heavy torrential rainfalls that are the tail end of a la nina weather event.  However, as far as I know, I think many tropical areas have been experiencing higher than normal rainfalls.  Technically, Australia has had good rainfall this year, but not in any places where it is needed.<br>  <br>  Most of Australia's forests are very dry forests.  The ecosystems have adapted to dry conditions.  So just because there is forest, doesn't mean that there's moisture.  We are a very dry continent and our ecology has evolved accordingly.  And those trees are full of volatile oils that burn like petrol, so it would have to be pretty wet before they didn't burn.
keGOvavbaa	The answer telling you to allow 30 minutes to an hour is giving you horrible advice -- if you showed up 30 minutes before a flight on most airlines in the US, they wouldn't allow you to check in for your flight (even ignoring the fact that you might have to collect your luggage from the first flight, which in and of itself might take 30 minutes.)<br>  <br>  Further, the answers that are telling you to allow 90 minutes to two hours are potentially giving you bad advice -- you'll probably want to allow yourself at least three hours to do what you are proposing to do (if not more time), if you have to go through Customs and Immigration at DFW.  Assuming that your connecting flight to Lubbock is on American or Continental, you'll also have to leave security, transfer to the proper terminal, check in for that flight, and re-enter security, which could take a considerable amount of time, given the size of DFW.<br>  <br>  If your connecting flight to Lubbock is on Southwest, you'll probably want to allow at least four hours, because Southwest flies out of Love Field, which is about 15 miles from DFW airport.  (The answer that stated that Southwest flies out of DFW is incorrect -- all of their flights are out of Love Field.)  That portion of the connection would be up to you -- it's your responsibility to get from DFW to Love Field via taxi or other means, not the airline's.  This takes time, of course, but it will also cost you money -- eating into that 100 euro savings.<br>  <br>  Another consideration when you buy separate tickets like this is that, if the first flight from Brussels is delayed and you miss the second flight, it's not the second airline's responsiblity, meaning you might be stuck paying change fees and fare differences to get that second ticket changed.  This is why I suggest allowing extra time if you insist on buying the tickets separately -- in case the first flight is delayed for some reason, you have some cushion to work with so that you don't miss your second flight.<br>  <br>  Were it me, though, I might buy the ticket together in this situation -- especially if the flight to Lubbock is on Southwest -- because the extra 100 euros would be worth saving the hassle of transferring airports, plus you'd be protected on a later flight to Lubbock if the flight into Dallas is delayed.|`|mldo1vxYaa	Its completely possible for you to do this. Just look at it as two completely seperate flights. Therefore you will want a couple of hours between flights to allow for baggage collection from the first flight and then in to departures and check in for the second flight plus any delays that might occur on the first flight so I would allow a couple of hours. Good for you refusing to pay the higher price by the way.|`|DEGClROKaa	Give yourself at least 30 mins-an hour or more to be safe. As for the luggage you should call the airlines and just ask.. which is what I did.|`|N7G26k4Iaa	Allow two hours.  This is because when you arrive in the US on an international flight, you have to go through customs and immigration.  After customs, you will need to re-check your bags.  Otherwise, what you propose is completely doable.|`|ItLN7fCBaa	Here is the real story. DFW airport is very large. It is not extremely confusing. But it is a place that I suggest bringing a map if you intend to change airlines. But truthfully, it is not worth it to try. The problem is these carriers serving small cities have a tendency to cancel flights when they do not fill up--any day, any time. So then you end up in DFW paying for a hotel or on the flip side, worse, you miss the return flight completely and pay rebooking fees plus the hotel. Don't do it. That's my advice. Because if you stay with the same carrier and one flight cancels, they are responsible and will re-accomodate you. If you miss an American Airlines flight because Southwest cancels, no mercy is shown.<br>  <br>  Three major carriers server DFW to LBB, American, Continental and Southwest. Southwest is out as they do not reserve seats. Yep, they do not reserve seats. They line em up like a 200 rats fighting for 170 pieces of cheese. So rule number one is do not take Southwest Airlines. That leaves American or Continental. Pay the extra euros. It will save you, not cost you.<br>  <br>  You can get a great deal of information at www.flightstats.com. This will tell you routes and a ton more information. Also you can check into www.yapta.com. This will tell you if the price goes down before or after you purchase your tickets.<br>  <br>  So yes, I travel extensively. Whomever said 30 minutes above should have their head examined. I just hate to see a tourist stranded because some know-it-all misinformed you. Normally flights arrive late in USA. Normally carriers will try and exchange your bags (but they blame each other when it falters). <br>  <br>  Have fun in Texas. The people are wonderful there.

1FPTD5I5aa	There are hundreds and hundreds of pretty good cheap hotels and guest houses.   Thailand is pretty big, if you mention the places where you want to stay you can get some specific accommodations.  What price range do you want to be in?<br>  <br>  Most travelers DO NOT stay in chain hotels in Thailand anyway.  There are hostels that have private rooms, guest houses and cheap hotel rooms that can be found in the 300 baht to 1000 baht range that are not too bad.  The cheaper the price the fewer extras you get (like A/C, private toilet, hot water, etc.)  Many places have safes in rooms or safety boxes for security storage.   <br>  <br>  So, what towns or cities do you need a room at?   Don't avoid Bangkok!   Spend a few nights there, choose a hotel (or guest house) near the Skytrain so you can use that overhead service to get around town.

L7Q1vlQkaa	I like both, but personally I like bigger cities, even though both of these cities exceed 1 million people LA is A lot, A lot Bigger than Phoenix. Also Both cities have pretty high crime rates, but that doesn't bother me, because you can always move to nice areas nearby. Also since I live in Oakland California, I know the life of crime and I don't live in the hood, but I have friends who do and I live close by the hood. Phoenix can also get boring since your just in the valley and that is basically the only big city close by. If you like weather exceeding 100 degrees May-August and 70-90 the rest of the year move to Phoenix. LA is a coastal city. I think LA is better.|`|Hhf4pLBJaa	Phoenix has less traffic congestion than LA too. It's still a busy city, just less traffic problems, smog and lower standard of living compared to LA.

The closest subway stop is just 100 yards from the Aquarium. <br>  <br>  If you prefer to walk, you can take the State Station stop on the Orange Line (8-minute walk), the Government Center stop on the Green Line (10-minute walk) or the South Station stop on the Red Line (10-15-minute walk).|`|URO3gDXcaa	check the yellow pages.  there are several buses that go to boston.  the bus station is at the back of the raddison on elm st and i think there is a schedule there.|`|e138b4efa4524e74d6719f0ebf966a81aa	you can take grey hound right on in  an then take a sub , bus or taxie to the aquarium|`|Df7k9bgVaa	You can take the city bus to the Manchester bus station and then take a greyhound bus (or another company) to either North Station or South Station in Boston.  There are also trains that go into North and South Station.  If you go into North Station you can get on the green line T and go in two stops to government center and then get on the blue line T for one stop.  From South Station you can get on the red line T and go 2 stops to park street and then get on the green line and go one stop to government center.  From there you can either get on the blue line or walk to the aquarium.|`|fFnsJ7maaa	Good advice from other posters. I just want to add that you should check your local public library to see if they have free passes for the NE Aquarium. Most of the Massachusetts libraries do.|`|K1GYtYryaa	If you can get into the city using amtrak or the commuter rail you can take the orange line to either aquarium or state street stop and walk from there|`|VIHw7kRkaa	I live in Boston.  I know that there are trains or Amtrack trains that go from Maine to Boston, so there should be one that goes to N.H.  there is a train station that brings you literally right infront of the Aquarium.

You can take food on the plane but throw it out before you go through customs.|`|pcHp7Dgkaa	All you need is your passport and ETA and a return air ticket. The ETA replaces a visa when you're from an 'ETA eligible' country and you'll be able to enter the country without any problems.<br>  <br>  Because you are not allowed to work while on an ETA, make sure that you have evidence of sufficient funds for all of your holiday expenses in your bank account and credit card as that may be checked upon arrival.|`|crrK58F4aa	check out this website<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.immi.gov.au/" rel="nofollow">http://www.immi.gov.au/</a><br>  <br>  It is for the department of immigration.

On my first trip, I wish I had brought a couple of air mattresses for the pool or ocean.  And sand buckets and shovels for my little girl.

The Blue Ridge Mountains, and waterfalls are suck wind beautiful.
4b127bdc65641a05881903d7090f19c2aa	You should drive around the north side, absolutely.  The best sights are there.  The south side is pretty desolate and last time I was there the road was closed.  Most people go north through Kahului and follow the road along the north coast to Hana and a little beyond it to see O'heo Gulch (a.k.a. Seven Sacred Pools) then come back the same way.<br>  <br>  I recommend getting a guide book ("Maui Revealed" is my favorite) so you can find the points of interest along the way.  You'll want to see the bamboo forest, Ke'anae Arboretum, the lava cave, and O'heo Gulch. but there are many other beautiful sights to see along the way, including waterfalls and scenic overlooks.  If the book still lists the Blue Pool as an attraction, ignore it because it's no longer open to the public.|`|jn9iYEkAaa	I agree with the answer above whole-heartedly. Definitely head north. I spent 2 months for three summers on Maui, so I've been all over it. The southern road is often closed and as stated is dusty and desolate-not much to see. After driving the road to Hana, my personal opinion is that the curvy crazy road tracing the western coast of the island is just as beautiful. BUT you should still venture to Hana. Everyone has to at least once - if only to say you've done it! :) Just don't miss the rest of the island.|`|sZm5oisdaa	Around the top. It is a long drive and worth every moment of it. the 1 st. time we drove it we just repeated the same words over & over  "WOW" -" AHHH"--and mostly used "OH ****"  a DRIVE YOU WELL NEVER  FORGET.    Aloha and have a great time.|`|TtcylLTLaa	I've been both ways.  The most enjoyable way is east or what these others are calling north.  Head to Kahului, then out past Haiku and beyond.  It is an all day road trip, so bring lunch and drinks, and camera, and swim suit, and hiking shoes, and smile a lot.
COSvrQUcaa	These are actually the top colleges in order according to my guidance book!<br>  <br>  1  University College Dublin Dublin <br>  2  University of Dublin, Trinity College Dublin <br>  3  Dublin City University Dublin <br>  4  University College Cork Cork <br>  5  National University of Ireland, Galway Galway <br>  6  University of Limerick Limerick <br>  7  Dublin Institute of Technology Dublin <br>  8  National University of Ireland, Maynooth Maynooth <br>  9  Cork Institute of Technology Bishopstown <br>  10  Limerick Institute of Technology Limerick <br>  <br>  But it really all depends on the course your doing, e.g. i'm in 4th year now and am deciding on my future college course, I've narrowed it down to primary teaching, some kind of business course like accounting or some kind of physics/chemistry course.<br>  If i'm doing teaching i'll be going to Mary Isle in Limerick,<br>  If i'm doing Business i'll go to UCC because i think its got great facilities<br>  If i'm doing Science i'll be going tio Trinity because their science facilities are unreal! The amount of money they put into science is phenomenal.<br>  Sorry about droning oon but just wanted to make a point!|`|q9PVawNyaa	Irish universities are excellent. A little surprised that nobody has mentioned NUI Maynooth which is university of the year at the moment. It all depends on what you want to study.

You can't buy essays or term papers, and if Daddy is rich it doesn't do you any good. <br>  <br>  In other words, they are real universities.|`|egqveuPjaa	It all depends on what you want to study. I think NUIG is the best- perfect size, great people, good range of courses, but unfortunately they don't do Bachelors in Education so I can't go.<br>  Colleges in Ireland are quite similar to American as far as I know when it comes to social life, accomodation, but I think the courses are very different.|`|f3LrMhqWaa	why is cork university fifth on the list?griffith college is a private school  and it costs a fortune to go there, yet alone including books, etc. well, i'm biased, but cork university is a great college, huge range of courses, really helpful lecturers and administration staff, massive library, great night life and everyone is really relaxed down here.also, it's cheaper to live in cork than in dublin!and there is a lot of American students who come over to cork university, so clearly american colleges have a high opinion of our little university!|`|QUkXsPNIaa	I've been to Uni in Galway (NUIG) studying An Art's Degree. I loved living in Galway, it is just the best City. You cannot beat Galway for having the craic. I have so many fond memories.<br>  <br>  I left NUIG as I didn't like my course and found the classes to big, I'm now studting Veterinary Nursing in Letterkenny I.T in Donegal (LYIT) and I couldn't have found a better course.<br>  <br>  So in short, NUI Galway = A great city and Uni, if you can handle the huge amount of people.<br>  <br>  LYIT = Not a good city, but a nice small and good quality I.T|`|rxfKjMTnaa	I agree that Trinity is over rated! Also, I did not see the university of Limerick on the above list, which is defiently as good as trinity. UCD is huge, hard to keep friends and not very personal. Also, accomodation in Dublin is very expensive.<br>  I would recomend the university of Limerick!|`|62RKtkOhaa	Trinity, Dublin<br>  Maynooth<br>  Galway<br>  Limerick<br>  Queens, Belfast<br>  University of Ulster<br>  <br>  etc all good places to study.|`|XzZq535jaa	UCD and Trinity in Dublin are both world class in pretty much all fields and Queen's University in Belfast is part of the Russel Group.

LMo8HaA2aa	There are plenty of scholars, researchers and scientists in USA and other countries (Europe).   From time to time there is something to hear, but as you will probably know, Greece isn't the most privileged place in the world right now.     If you imply that we aren't good enough as our ancestors, well it's a correct conclusion to make.  BUT. I am very satisfied that eventually Greece is a very decent place to live and we didn't have the historical decline of Phoenicians, Arabs for example.   I'm happy and proud, because those ancestors made choices that affect modern Greeks' lives in a positive way.     This is what we are. We are proud of them. We respect the important cultural heritage they gave us (and all the world).    I have to add  -Vaso Apospolopoulou, a Greek doctor in Australia. Invented a very important vaccine, which has even 100% success.    - Stamatis Krimitzis, ekathimerini.com | A Greek eye on Voyager's journey  Stamatis Krimizis, director of Space Programs at Johns Hopkins University, talks ...

Evgenios Michael Antoniadis was an early 20th century astronomer who mapped the lunar landscape and Mars.  Two craters (one on each of them) have his name.

He is considered the top authority in his field.|`|AA11589437	Things are not so simple. Yes, they have, and you got many answers above from people who know more than I do in this area. But you must have a perception of historical conditions. Did anyone invent anything until the Renaissance and the Industrial Revolution? No, not in the Middle Ages.  So Greece wouldn't either. However, when the Renaisance started for the rest of the world, based on the ancient Greek civilisation, which is what helped sciences and arts advance  in Europe, Greece was conquered by the Ottoman Empire, that did not take part in this Renaissance or the industrial revolution. It is impossible for a people with no independence to start making progress in technology, because there is no financial support for this. After the Independence, gradually Greece advanced together with other European countries, but of course the major inventions had already been done. So basically it is in the 20th century that the new science had field for progress, and in this field Greek scientists had indeed a great contribution.|`|24eKqnyqaa	Constantin Carathodory (or Constantine Karatheodori) (Greek: ?? ?) (September 13, 1873  February 2, 1950) was a Greek mathematician. He made significant contributions to the theory of functions of a real variable, the calculus of variations, and measure theory. His work also includes important results in conformal representations and in the theory of boundary correspondence. In 1909, Carathodory pioneered the Axiomatic Formulation of Thermodynamics along a purely geometrical approach.    Legacy    The Greek authorities intend to create a museum honoring Karatheodoris in Komotini, a major town of the northeastern Greek region where his family came from.    On December 19, 2005, Israeli officials along with Israel's ambassador to Athens, Ram Aviram, presented the Greek foreign ministry with copies of 10 letters between Albert Einstein and Constantin Carathodory [Karatheodoris] that suggest that the work of Carathodory helped shape some of Albert Einstein's theories.|`|64liG2Caaa	Genocide over Pseudomacedonian minority!

23vKOyBraa	You have good answers above for YOUR specific case, however I'd like to point out that Chanuk A's answer wouldn't apply to many places in the world, including some American routes.    A stopover (layover, whatever you wanna call it) in itself doesn't necessarily have meaning. Case in point: Melbourne and Perth are two cities within Australia - 99% of people flying between the two are technically on domestic flights.    However, there are SOME routes that fly, eg Melbourne - Perth - South Africa (another country), and while the Perth layover is still within Australia, the passengers who got on in Melbourne are TECHNICALLY on an international flight - they will have cleared customs and immigration in Melbourne, and CANNOT LEAVE THE AIRPORT in Perth as they are destined for South Africa.    Bottom line, to answer your question fully you'd have to consider your ticket, routes, and how your airline treats that trip. But, sure, in most cases, the part of the flight that actually takes you over the border is the international part (but not always).|`|PA0bGBtCaa	In your case, the flight from Denver to Mexico will be the international flight.

lcj1AKt1aa	It says that you will need a passport OR secure travel document if you are travelling by air and need to reenter the US. On the other hand, if you are entering by land or sea you will have to show some proof of identity and proof of US citizenship.  Nevertheless you will need a passport as of June 1, 2009 to enter by land, sea or air.  While on the cruise you will need the passport as you will be using the ship's.  This will allow you to reenter the port in Bahamas to board the ship.    Check here for the relevant information.  http://travel.state.gov/travel/cbpmc/cbp...    Lawful Permanent Residents  Air Travel    All travelers including children must present a passport or secure travel document when entering the United States by air.  Land/Sea Travel    Lawful permanent residents may continue to present their Form I-551, Permanent Resident Card.

It costs about $80 and can take as long as 3 months to receive.  But, in reality, you'll generally get it in about a month to six weeks.

See 2nd site for all passport application info.  HOWEVER,  Passports are not needed for Caribbean cruises which begin and end in the same U.S. port.  Cruise lines like all passengers to have passports, but they are not required.  You may want to go ahead and get a passport, as it makes traveling easier...but they are not required for cruise travel.   The cost of a passport is exactly $100.00 plus photos.

9epL6qjBaa	There is probably a shuttle or bus that can take you to the Port of NY -that should be easy to find and book.  Book a round trip for the day you get back and you may even get a small discount.<br>  <br>  The other thing I highly recommend is booking "transfers" for your luggage.  This way, all you have to do is get them to the Port and the Cruise line will handle the rest.  Meaning, they will take them to your cabin and then get them to you at the Port when you get back home.<br>  <br>  As for Bermuda - what ISN'T there to do?!?  HA!  Fun, sun, sand, beach, restaurants, shopping (some duty free) and tons to do while you're there.<br>  <br>  One more word of advice - if you ever do a day trip off the Cruise Ship, MAKE SURE you are back at the time they are departing to go back to sea.  Or, they WILL leave you behind and it will be up to you to try to catch up to them on your own and at your own expense.  I had friends go shopping and then proceed to get drunk when our Ship stopped in Key West on the Monday of our Cruise.  Well, we didn't see them again until Wednesday, when they had to fly to Grand Cayman and catch up with our ship.  Cost them around $1200 for their mistake and they had no change of clothes, etc...|`|iN27E3WCaa	You can take a train from Connecticut to NY and then take a taxi from either Grand Central or Penn Station (depending on whether you take the Metro North or Amtrak).  Parking in Manhattan is a nightmare and if you're leaving your car there for a few days it can become very pricey.
Wy9TEjMRaa	White and red were admitted to be national colors first at 03.11.1792. At this event's first anniversary maidens were wearing white robes with red ribbon and men had white-red sashes tied round their waists. <br>  First legal regulation of Polish flag was accepted at 07.02.1831<br>  After regaining independence the colors and shape of flag was enacted by Parliament in 1919 (1st of August). Two years later the red color was specified to crimson but in 1927 it was changed to vermilion, which was also used in an act in 1955.<br>  Colors were changed again in 1980.<br>  <br>  Here you've got what colors were enacted.<br>    <br>  #DC143C  #E34234  #D4213D  #FF0000<br>  1921-30  1928-80  od 1980  nieoficjalny<br>  <br>  <br>  About a flag with an eagle, it's still up-to-date and it's called State Flag with Emblem ;)<br>  <br>  Hope I've helped ;)|`|Gcwbw5q8aa	A few words to add on 'the flag with an eagle': it used to be a flag displayed on Polish naval vessels simply because the red-and-white banner is "H" in the International Maritime Signal Flags code. Now, the flag with an eagle is displayed at Polish missions abroad, at Polish civilian airports and sea ports, on board Polish sea vessels and aircraft.|`|4lm0oj2caa	It is white and red and it reflects colours on the Polish national emblem, that is a white eagle in the red background.<br>  On the other hand, white stands for innocence and being religious while red represents blood, combat and sacrifice. Red was also considered a colour of nobility and wealth and it used to be worn only by the rich.<br>  The flag with the Polish emblem in the middle is used in diplomatic institutions, at civilian airports and harbours.

fdI8OtNeaa	You could do Magic kingdom and animal kingdom in a day - keep a full day for Hollywood studios!!<br>  <br>  I'd recommend going to Animal Kingdom early in the morning as the animals will be out then - we made the mistake of going in the afternoon one year and they were all asleep!!<br>  <br>  Are you planning on going to Epcot?? Theres a few good rides there aswell - it would only take half a day aswell.<br>  <br>  Universal Studios is the best - go early aswell though and be prepared to queue - its well worth it!!<br>  <br>  Enjoy =) <br>  (I'm going back in November - Can't Wait!!!)|`|21eb1fee7277ed0dfc6c417c0a528dddaa	I had four days to explore all four parks, and we still didn't see as much as I was planning on. The movie studio park doesn't offer as much as Magic Kingdom that can be done in half a day. But if there are shows you want to see, then you would need more hours. <br>  <br>  I only got to see two parts of Animal Kingdom and I think we were there for 2 hours. My advice make a plan now on what you really want to see, and what you don't mind skipping.<br>  <br>  ETA : Re-reading your question. August is when I plan to go back also. But its for my birthday. Most recent time there was for the youngling's birthday so now its mom's turn. :D|`|LcT0hqzZaa	I would go to Magic Kingdom one day and a half and the rest of the day i would go to Animal Kingdom (there is only like 2-3 rides that are worth to be queueing for) ad one full day for Hollywood Studios.<br>  To be honest i don't think it will be a good plan to waste a whole day on Discovery Cove, its just another water park where you can swim with dolphins. In that case, if you haven't had enough of Disney I suggest you to go to Disney Downtown, where you can find the best Disney shops and other varieties where you can eat and chill and you and your future husband would enjoy a lot.|`|lgXSmCQRaa	What makes you think you'll even get out of the hotel bedroom?|`|xSHRJw46aa	No, but so what.  You do the things you have time to do.  You have fun.  That is the idea.  Get Birnbaums Official Guide to Walt Disney World.  Then you can have an idea what you really want to do.  Have fun and do what you can.  When it is over, you will have a few new things to do the next time you go.  Or when you bring that first kid down.  <br>  <br>  Actually, my first trip there was about a year after we were married.  We went to the Magic Kingdom one day and Epcot the next.  I got hooked and have been back every 2 or 3 years since.  Now I love that my kids lose a couple years of age and become kids again when we walk in the gate.  <br>  <br>  Happy wedding.

It will take at least a day for MK. Animal Kingdom and the studios are small so depending on wait times you might be able to do both of those in one day. You MUST go to Epcot... drinking around the world cant be beat! (or eating if you dont drink). that can take a day in itself.<br>  also dont forget to ask at guest services for pins that say "just married" then disney cast members try to make your honeymoon better.<br>  <br>  --- I suggest getting a book called The Unofficial Guide To Walt Disney World....there is info on all the parks (even Universal) and everything in the Orlando area. This will help you plan and see all that Orlando has to offer. <br>  <br>  Have a great time!!!|`|42179704f68b09bf27cb0b25a718c620aa	Assuming you'll be the usual Honeymooning couple...no, I doubt the two of you will leave the bed for the first day or so.<br>  <br>  That being said. The Magic Kingdom itself will require two days to fully explore...and that's assuming you don't spend most of those days waiting in 2+ hour lines for the rides!<br>  Epcot will likely require at least a day to itself!<br>  Then there are all the other attractions that are not part of Disney (Seaworld for one) that are within a fairly short drive!<br>  <br>  No offence, Disney is generally more of an Anniversary than a Honeymoon destination. (Too many distractions while on the latter.)<br>  <br>  Good Luck!|`|eD7qRBKHaa	No, I really don't think that's enough.  You need at least one full day for Magic Kingdom.  If you pick out just say 5 rides and that's it, you'll be ok.  But that time of year, you probably need 2 days just at Magic Kingdom.  And while Animal Kindom and Hollywood Studios both can be half-day parks, in the middle of the summer, it will be impossible.

The lowest price for gas in Duluth today is $1.87 for regular at 1230 W MICHIGAN ST,  DULUTH, MN 55806.  If your tank holds 18.8 gal, fill it up for $35.16.  If not, fill it anyway.<br>  <br>  I would refuel around Madison, WI.  It's 330 miles from Duluth.  Typical fuel prices there are $1.92 per gal.

A social networking site is definitely not the same as a real social setting, and that's going to effect many people who only rely on websites to communicate.|`|x79VCZsNaa	? do agree with the article, we are getting isolated of the society if we stink on the computer for long time during the day, but it is as everithing related to electronics and i almost sure it began with the introduction of TV, in other time we used to call people who were watching TV for long periods of time "fulltime tv spectators" so what is the difference now? that while you are in face book you are comunicating with reall people but in the other case you were or are just sit on TV..that doctor shows it as something new but i think there are a lot of studies not just related to face book but an early tools.<br>  Plus not all is as bad as it seems to be, there are alot of people (including me) who are far away of their loved ones or who are in a environment where is difficult to socialize as in another times so they have found internet social sites as a way to do so, in my case believe me since i have alot of things to do and i decided to give myself a time to come to Y/A of Facebook during the time i am alone at home i think i got recover of some periods of stress and depresion tha i use to go through, i have few friend here but it has been really dificult to me interact with people in this city so to me instead of cause a problem it has given me some nice time. All things are bad if are used in excess.|`|FDjn05cNaa	Adults should be able to manage the time spent on these sites in a reasonable way.....I use facebook mainly to share pics with friends.<br>  <br>  I am more concerned that children are getting into the habit from an early age to interact via the computer rather than by playing together as we did....the effects are a lack of social skills as well as on their physical wellbeing...|`|m1JxtSVSaa	i agree with arpsy..same situation
Z8DGKDHBaa	It has been tradition for a newly elected presidents first international trip to be to Canada. (except for Bush who visited Mexico first. hahaha) Considering the US and Canada are completely intertwined in regards to economy, trade, energy production and security. It SHOULD be very very obvious to why Obama would be visiting Canada first. The two countries have one of the most important and all encompassing alliances on the planet. Canada is fairing the economy meltdown better than most countries and is a vital ally in helping the US and the world as a whole in developing policies to help fix the situation. Canada has been a leading force in Afghanistan since day one. Obama and Harper have many things to discuss and it has been a long eight years in which the relations between the two countries have been completely disintegrated. (due to a lack of knowledge, understanding and intelligence in the previous administration.)|`|rGEZup0Zaa	He's talking trade and security.|`|2wyDALHgaa	He wasn't trying to do anything other then touching base with his neighbor and your country's closest trading partner.  The visit was symbolic and was an attempt to undo some of the damage done by George W during his time in office.  I'm not an Obama fan but by visiting he's also opened the door to talks by the various minions on both sides of the border so that they can address issues of interest to both countries.<br>  <br>  In recent years your President has traditionally made this his first stop outside the US and by doing it now, even though it was short, it got that formality out of the way, strengthened some ties that needed it and still left himself plenty of time to get back and deal with the mess back home.  He's also now free to travel to other places outside the US now that he has made this symbolic gesture.|`|3QsPl1uLaa	It is a tradition going way back in time. The new President always visits Canada before other countries. ( Only Bush Jr did not do this).<br>  Canada is the biggest trading partner of the USA. Canada exports more oil to the USA than any other country. It is to be expected that Obama would want talk to the leaders in Canada.|`|uiX853hPaa	Trade was the main reason. He realizes Canada is the United States' biggest trade partner, and so protectionism isn't good for either economy.|`|Twzg9s0caa	He wanted to see how we do things up here so he could copy us.<br>  Oh, and he wanted to get some Tim Horton's coffee.|`|tBn75TOGaa	he wanted to show them what a black man looks like|`|N53y9qohaa	Hi Sara,<br>  <br>  Canada is your biggest trading partner with 1.5 billion dollars a day going back and forth across the border. Much of your energy like gas and electricity come from there. Canada and US are in the same mess and need to fix everything from the big clog ups at the border through to environmental issues and Afghanistan.<br>  <br>  His visit was was a low key power lunch scenario as he felt the expense of pomp and circumstance was not a good image to project right now. Also, unlike Bush Obama is very popular in Canada, so much so he would win an election hands down there if he ran against Harper or Ignatieff.<br>  <br>  Cheers,<br>  <br>  Michael Kelly|`|A2BCezFVaa	he needed maple cookies and a key chain...and to suck up cuz canada provides most of america's energy.|`|SJPfjaS0aa	He was in Canada for 6 hours. I think the crisis didnt change in the hours that he was there.|`|l7VVNBrIaa	Traditionally the US president makes his first overseas visit to Canada; Bush did it too
ywEIQEPkaa	It has nothing to do with race. Indiana is just plain America, and when tourists come from abroad, they are more interested in famous cities than real America. Just like if you went to France... would you go to Paris, or the countryside?|`|z28QboW7aa	nyc,miami, la and others have more things to do than in Indy and South bend.

New York City is the biggest city in the US, it has basically everything. California includes the #1 spot for all celebrities, and Florida has Disney and beachers, etc. Indiana isn't as exciting, it's all about famous tourist spots and things to do there. When's the last time you ever heard anyone talk about Indiana?|`|6pIsnI0Saa	New york City = one of the worlds biggest cities !<br>  Florida = Sun Shine, Tropical and the gate way to the America's <br>  and California  has LA (Hollywood), San Francisco  and the 8th largest economy !<br>  also all three of those places are Port Cities Major shipping ports<br>  and the population are pretty large in all three places<br>  a long with many other reasons why these places get many tourist.<br>  really too much to type why all 3 places get more !|`|JiIwxzxlaa	Because they are huge cities (NYC, LA, Tokyo, Paris) with big, pricey hotels, fashion designers, celebrities, expensive stores, all that kind of stuff. <br>  <br>  Places like Florida and California are warm with beaches and oceans and Disney World/Land and all that good stuff I never got to go to.

The police who are the protecters to people are hitting the people sometimes and spectators sometimes and totally unable to understand them.  The politicians are taking opportunities to earn name in the minds of public.  The rulers are ruling the state with an eye on votes and not bringing discipline and also not strictly enforcing the law.  Totally, all are taking the law in their own hands.|`|AWwdfUfoaa	What is happening in Tamilnadu is unfortunate. Petty partisan politics is taking precedence over national and strategic foreign policy agenda. What is happening in Sri Lanka is indeed, to me, an internal affair of Sri Lanka. It is essentially a fight against discrimination that the Tamil population started and got hijacked by the violent LTTE. Every nation has problems where the minority felt discriminated. But there are ways to resolve these issues. Even the problem of Aparthied did not cause this much bloodshed despite the blacks there being the majority. <br>  <br>  I think having sympathy for the plight of Sri Lankan Tamilians is not ill-placed. But recognizing them as Sri Lankans first and Tamilians next is also to be accepted in all fairness. Instead of pouring out their anger on the streets, they should pour in humatarian help, which atleast is not visible. A party asking the Foreign Minister to intervene in the affairs of another country to meet its political agenda, was to me the saddest thing that could have happened. I only hope sanity prevails. Now, there are agitations in Malaysia and some SE Asian countries spearheded by Tamilians... will the people of Tamilnadu go ahead and agitate for them too???? Provide moral and humatarian support. Do not politicise it for everybody's sake.
BAlntsndaa	Plan for backup with a contact who will expect you to call on a reasonable schedule, don't keep all of your money in one place, avoid making it obvious you are alone or lost, make sure someone knows where you are whether it be a park employee or friend, don't keep the inside of your car littered with maps and other signs of travel far from home, keep a whistle and light handy, use your head and avoid keeping yourself too isolated. Leave spare keys and emergency fund with someone you trust and can easily contact. Plan for worse, then expect the best and enjoy. Be happy and confident - nothing says target more than someone who is too anxious or isolated. Go nowhere with anyone, especially if a couple just wants to 'show you' something. As you may meet and make some new friends, keep it public and don't give out extra personal information.|`|1e39e4ff5ad6a9ea20311bd72097c1aeaa	You'll need good camping equipment.  Cheap stuff breaks, wears out, or doesn't work.  You will depend on your equipment...don't skrimp.  If you have equipment, fine.  You know what you have.  If not I would recommend shopping at an outfitter supply house.  If there are none around you try the following sites:<br>  <br>   <a href="http://www.cabelas.com/camping.shtml" rel="nofollow">http://www.cabelas.com/camping.shtml</a><br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.rei.com/category/4500001" rel="nofollow">http://www.rei.com/category/4500001</a><br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.llbean.com/webapp/wcs/stores/servlet/CategoryDisplay?categoryId=117&catalogId=1&storeId=1&langId=-1&nav=gnro" rel="nofollow">http://www.llbean.com/webapp/wcs/stores/...</a><br>  <br>  <br>  I would plan my trip at home.  Go to the state park website to find out about the camping areas.  Don't forget county parks.  Some are better than the nearby state facilities.  Make your itinerary on a state map with a highlighter.<br>  <br>  Tell your itinerary to a friend.  Call regularly with your stories and any plans that have changed.  Most campgrounds have a ranger.  He will know your campsite and may check in to see if all is well.<br>  <br>  Take along any medications you will need plus a substantual first aid kit.  You will be alone.  Don't forget the critters. Snake bite and mosquitoes are things you can prepare for.<br>  <br>  Take along some fishing supplies to connect with nature, keep busy in the daylight, and have a cheap meal. <br>  <br>  Most camping areas have camground stores nearby for ice, bait, canned goods etc.<br>  <br>  Don't forget a lantern for night.  It will get completely dark.  A flashlight won't give off enough light in camp. <br>  <br>  Prepare for the weather and terrain.  Hiking boots, socks, rain gear including a hat that keeps you dry and a fleece jacket or vest will be appreciated to keep you warm at night.<br>  <br>  You won't need a credit card in camp.  Store them and cash in a safe place.  A good idea is to split them up and hide in different places in the car.  <br>  <br>  Don't leave any edible things in the open, especially at night.  Animals love free food and they will help themselves.  Store in tamperproof containers...lockable cooler, car trunk.<br>  <br>  Don't forget a camera.
1a12b70a1ae2e90d55e3b1643b48f58baa	There are dozens of political parties in Israel. many of which have representatives Israel has five major political parties: Kadima, Labor, Likud, Shas and Yisrael Beytenu. These five and smaller political parties comprise the Israeli parliamentary system of government. Knesset, a 120-member unicameral parliament, is elected every four years through a proportional representation system. The head of the political party that wins the most seats is responsible for forming the government and thereby becomes the prime minister. Since the formation of Israel in 1948, no single political party has won the majority of the seats, sixty-one, in Knesset. As a result, governments are formed through coalitions.<br>  <br>  Kadima, a right-wing political party, was created in 2005 by former Prime Minister Ariel Sharon. Kadima's primary aim is to create a strong Israeli and Palestinian State. It focuses on continuing Sharon's unilateral disengagement plan--to move Israeli settlements out of Gaza and strengthen security in Palestinian areas. This political party also hopes to reform the Knesset with more elections at different levels of government.<br>  <br>  The Labor Party, formed in the 1930s, is probably the oldest of the five main Israeli political parties. Originally a left-wing socialist political party, it can now be classified as a left-of-center party. The Labor party advocates for less government and a stable monetary and fiscal policy. In terms of the Arab-Israeli conflict, this political party strongly supports territorial concessions and is opposed to military aggression against Palestinians. It is this stance that makes the political party sometimes unappealing to Israelis especially in times of frequent terrorist attacks.<br>  <br>  The Likud Party, formed in 1973, advocates a free market for the Israeli economy and has established free trade agreements with the European Union (EU) and the United States (US). It is largely based on the idea of a "Greater Israel" which emphasizes the nation’s entitlement to the West Bank--the region within Israel that is west of the Jordan River. Still, it was the Likud Party that was the first political party to concede territory to Egypt. The Likud's lack of interest in the Disengagement Plan was what led Sharon to break off and form the Kadima party. Likud currently supports Israeli settlements in Palestinian areas and while it supports a Palestinian state, it supports a smaller Palestinian state than what most Arabs advocate.<br>  <br>  In 1984, the Shas political party was formed by Rabbi Ovadia Yosef, who continues to serve as its spiritual leader today. It was formed as a reaction to the government’s refusal to extend Rabbi Yosef’s term as Chief Rabbi of Israel. After the 2006 elections, its political leader, Eli Yishal, formed a coalition with Kadima since Shas had won a total of 12 seats in Knesset. Its practice of forming coalition has a large effect upon its policies toward Arab-Israeli relations, often being the same as the ruling political party with which it has aligned. Furthermore, it advocates social payments and restricting state authority.<br>  <br>  Yisrael Beiteinu has two basic policies. One is the advocating a hard-line approach towards Palestine and the rest of the world. Since its foreign policies are largely based on realism, Yisrael Beiteinu believes other nations would prefer that Israel not gain control of the Gaza Strip. The second policy concerns creating friendlier socio-economic conditions for new immigrants. In the 2006 elections, Yisrael Beiteinu won 11 votes within Knesset and became a part of the Kadima-led coalition government. <br>  <br>  here is more good reading<br>  <a href="http://www.science.co.il/Parties.asp" rel="nofollow">http://www.science.co.il/Parties.asp</a><br>  <a href="http://www.myjewishlearning.com/history_community/Israel/Israeli_Politics/IsraeliElectoralSystem/IsraeliPoliticalParties.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.myjewishlearning.com/history_...</a><br>  <a href="http://www.alertnet.org/thenews/newsdesk/L5342627.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.alertnet.org/thenews/newsdesk...</a><br>  <a href="http://judaism.about.com/od/politics/a/potparties.htm" rel="nofollow">http://judaism.about.com/od/politics/a/p...</a><br>  www.jewishvirtuallibrary.org/jsource/P... -

It really depends on what you like to do the most.<br>  <br>  I also would recommend the Caribbean if you live in the eastern half of the U.S. The time change, travel time and jet lag aren't worth the bother in order to see Hawaii.<br>  <br>  Aruba has the best beaches of your three Caribbean choices. The island is small, quiet and somewhat arid. Marriott Renaissance has a beautiful and quite private island that we absolutely loved.<br>  <br>  Cancun has poor beaches (hurricane damage) but great shopping, nightlife and restaurants. Everything is packed together on one long strip. Inexpensive buses go back and forth all day long, so transportation also is a plus. A day trip to the huge Mayan ruins at Chichén-Itzá is a great excursion if you have any interest in that sort of thing.<br>  <br>  Barbados is fairly pretty, probably more like Hawaii than the other two. It tends to emphasize nature attractions. We went snorkeling with sea turtles, which was an absolute blast.<br>  <br>  I would lean in favor of Aruba or Cancun slightly more than Barbados, but again it depends on your preferences. Aruba will be quiet, peaceful and relaxing with great beaches, while Cancun will be much more active with poor beaches.|`|N9s2YQhlaa	Hawaii is amazing - there's a reason they call it paradise. But it is such a long trip (I don't know your location but even from California it's about 7 hours). So unless you are planning a good solid week of vacation, I would stick to the Caribbean. As for that, I've only ever been to Jamaica and am going to the Grand Caymans in a few months, so I'm not much help. I have heard that Aruba is really nice though.<br>  <br>  Have fun and stay safe!|`|YMbvN3GQaa	Aruba is nice.. but i think its pretty expensive there.. the casinos are nice also.. <br>  IN THE CARIBBEAN:<br>  if you are looking for a country with a great night life and if you wish to party alot.. you can go to trinidad it is a bit americanize clubbing and partying. the music is great and the food varies. there are places for shopping and loads of sightseeing you can do the beaches there are ok but you can take a ferry to Tobago at a cheap cost and enjoy nicer beaches there.<br>  <br>  barbados is a great place for a vacation also and there is a night life there but not so much like trinidad. there are nicer beaches in barbados, duty free shopping yet shopping is pretty expensive there. and a more laid back atmosphere. there are places you can go sightseeing but when i was there i thought it was a bit limited and despite the beautiful scenery i think it was exploitation since the cost of going on tours are pretty high.<br>  <br>  you can go to st vincent if you are the adventurous type and there are the grenadine islands to explore. Bequia is awesome quiet and sensual not much to see but a great place if you wish to just lay back and relax... there are the other islands that are just a ferry trip away.. <br>  <br>  thas my info on the caribbean which i think makes a better getaway spot..|`|lcj1AKt1aa	Come to Barbados but it is in the Caribbean. Here is some information that you can look at.<br>  <br>  Information on Barbados<br>  <br>  Barbados is a coral island, pushed out of sea by volcanic activity in a far away time. On the West Coast of Barbados, coral shore beaches of fine white sand stretch along a blue-green sea. Coral reefs fringe the Barbados shoreline to provide excellent snorkeling and Scuba Diving. Along the East Coast a lively surf is blown briskly by the strong and constant trade winds and the waves pound against a rocky shore. The constant breeze of the trade winds gives Barbados a mild and pleasant tropical climate.<br>  <br>  When you visit Barbados, you will see it is mostly a flat coral island with excellent beaches, but there are rolling hills and many deep ridges and gullies, with an interesting distribution of flora and fauna. Within the Barbados coral core there is a vast array of caves and underground lakes which provide an excellent supply of drinking water that is amongst the purest in the world. Geologically Barbados is unique, being actually two land masses that merged together over the years. This and other anomalies make this Caribbean Island quite phenomenal, and there are geological structures that you will find only in Barbados.<br>  <br>  Barbados Expectation<br>  Barbados is a very beautiful island, with lots of art, activities, night life, music, history and some of the best restaurants to be found anywhere. But what makes Barbados even more special, and the reason why so many visitors keep returning to the island year after year, is the people. Barbadians, called Bajans, are warm and friendly souls, always ready to greet you with a sincere smile. Barbadians make you feel welcome and special, in this lovely Caribbean Island. You will feel its your home and will want to come back again and again to Barbados: A unique Caribbean paradise, surprisingly sophisticated, friendly, fun and always Naturally Charming!<br>  <br>  <a href="http://barbados.org/" rel="nofollow">http://barbados.org/</a><br>  Some all-inclusive resorts here including Almond Casuarina which is very near to the night life (St. Lawrence Gap). Included in this is the adult-hotel which is the Club and Spa.<br>  <a href="http://www.almondresorts.com/" rel="nofollow">http://www.almondresorts.com/</a><br>  <br>  Alternatively there is the Crane Hotel which has one of the top 10 best beaches in the world.

They have year round flee markets, and mud drags from march through october.  I am from Chicago area, so to me SA is very clean, and very not ghetto.

A unique adventure is to hire a camper van from Darwin and travel to the Kimberlies down to Broome This is an amazing part of the world. If you want to see an amazing harbour plus much more the beautiful City of Sydney is the place to go. If you want island hoping and resorts go to The WhitSundays If you prefer snorkeling and diving then there is The Great barrier reef from Cairns you have rain forests and lots of interest from there. Or Western Australia so huge so diverse such beauty There is the Ningaloo reef there. Then Queenslands Gold Coast for night life ,beaches, surfing shopping, Theme parks  and much much more. Now New Zealand has something quite different again There are wonderful lakes great fishing super mountains for skiing. green green pastures. very coastal . Wellington I always love except when the weather is bad i love the boutique shops and its just got character compact below the hills. I love the ferry trip to picton on a good day i love Nelson and the Able tasman National park I love the trip down the West Coast to Queenstown passing through Franz Joseph,  Fox Glacier, Wanaka .|`|lYkvps54aa	the gold coast. its a beautiful part of the world.|`|4cbDjci4aa	sydney,new south wales australia  is good to go because it is nice
ji7gqCWxaa	I can relate, especially about the part of "nothing is working"; that is one big fat symptom of depression, helplessness and hopelessness.<br>  <br>  Here are some helpful tips you could try:<br>  <br>  <br>  Get a good understanding of what depression is. Self help for depression is much more effective once you know what you are dealing with.  <br>  Regulate your sleep patterns. Get up no later than 8am and go to bed no later than 11.30pm, even if you can't sleep. If you have problems getting up in the morning, get someone else to rouse you, or have a friend call. <br>  Eat 3 meals a day, whether you are hungry or not, at the right times. <br>  Ensure you get outside early to make sure you get enough bright light to help regulate your sleep patterns. <br>  Do things to occupy your mind. If you have nothing to do all day, you will tend to ruminate over your problems. <br>  If you are facing a big problem, make the decision to put off thinking about it for, say, 2 weeks, or whatever is appropriate in your case. If you cannot put it off, speak to someone else who you know to be a good practical problem solver. <br>  Begin a 'depression diary'. In this rate each day from 1 to 10, where 1 is the worst kind of day, and 10 the best. This will help break down the 'all or nothing' thinking that depression can cause. <br>  Get as much exercise as you can. Make yourself walk briskly every day, at least. If you have any concerns about your health, see your doctor before beginning this. Research shows that exercise can lift depression. <br>  Get some kind of relaxation during the day. If you know how to do meditation, self hypnosis, tai chi or some other mind-calming technique, do it. It will help reduce the physical effects of the depression greatly. <br>  Start challenging your own thinking about things. If you find yourself thinking about things in a depressive way, as outlined in Thinking Styles that Cause Depression, deliberately think in a new way. A good way to do this is to write down the original thought, then generate some alternatives. <br>  Understand that depression is not part of you, it is due to a set of symptoms. These symptoms cause you to feel, think and act differently to normal. Once depression goes, things will be different. And when you have the skills to beat it, it is more likely to stay away.<br>  <br>  Self help for depression can be difficult. Don't be afraid to ask for help if you need it. Once you have beaten it, you can help others.|`|FDjn05cNaa	Give her something to do....get her mind off herself & involved with others .<br>  Depression is a serious form of self absorption & if she can refocus that attention on to someone else she may snap out of it.<br>  Other than that  , if it is a chemical imbalance in the brain she will need to be medicated|`|ie5AKYToaa	-Ride your bike<br>  -Pick some flowers<br>  -Tell someone you love them<br>  -Try to remember the first time and the most recent time someone told you they loved you<br>  -Buy yourself something new<br>  -Read a Harry Potter book<br>  -Remember how Hallambra and Webby always call Aussie an OLD man and how they always pick on him ;)<br>  -Go dance, or better yet, do the dabke!<br>  -Try to imagine your crazy aunt (or uncle) belly dancing at your cousin's wedding<br>  -Think of all the people who love you<br>  -Think of a funny ending for this joke: A Lebanese, an Egyptian, and a Saudi all walk into a bar...<br>  -Play a prank on your friends<br>  -Play SOCCER!!!! <br>  <br>  And most importantly, tell yourself that depression is only a PART of your life. it will not be your ENTIRE life. Take a breath, take things one at a time, and tell yourself that time will soon pass everything. Change does not happen immiediately, it takes time. And if you're still feeling bad after a while, go to a doctor since you may be chemically inbalanced and they can easily fix that and get you smiling again.|`|x79VCZsNaa	?n your age is very common to be in this status so do not worry just try to enjoy your life: do diferent things, attend some active clubs or young comunities like those who are dedicate to do social help or social activities may be in your school there is a sports club or art clubs that you can join.

Ask to see a bottle of Damiani !!!!  Have fun..........<br>  Personally, I sold my Time Share in Cabo after ten years. Costs were getting too high for me...a drink at the resort was $13.00 !!!  I'd rather stay at Hotel Mar de Cortez within easy walking distance of everything Cabo has to offer than go to another fancy resort....<br>  Be sure they set the dials on the pump back to ZERO before they pump gas.

AA10523012	I have no clue why you are asking a question like this in the UAE section. <br>  For shipping your equipment  from the USA into Dubai you have to order (especially in your case) a shipping company located in the USA which provides overseas shipping for oversized cargo such as cranes, machinery and construction equipment.<br>  <br>  Not knowing where in the USA you are located, you have to get in contact with some shipping companies having the following profile:<br>  <a href="http://www.carexshipping.com/" rel="nofollow">http://www.carexshipping.com/</a><br>  get estimations and compare shipping prices. Companies will send over their agent to look at the items to be shipped and calculate the size of the containers on what the shipping price will depend. These shipping companies will also be familiar with the rules regarding the Import Rules of the UAE and custom rules. <br>  Whenever the goods will arrive the UAE, a local agency which the American company is working with will take over.<br>  <br>  Please surf the net or look at the yellow pages to find shipping companies for your purpose where ever you are located in the USA. <br>  <br>  Just being curious:<br>  1. don't you know that 80% of cranes worldwide are in Dubai already?<br>  2. do you really think it's a good time right now (economic crisis) to invest in construction ?<br>  3.

urHPuzMsaa	Far from it. It really was old and rickety. There were not that many rooms in the round tower. I don't think back then they had those kinds of ratings. It had character is about all I can say about it. The auditorium was not very large. I was there for one of the last shows there when Frankie Valli and the Four Seasons played. John Denver and his wife sat at our table. The place has memories but it was one of the original ones and small.|`|pTLcvsVfaa	LOL..no.<br>  <br>  In the old days hotels were nothing like they are now in Vegas. Most of them were  simple, rustic, and earthy. They were not designed around pampering crybabies from California, they were for hardcore gamblems who wanted fun away from their familes for the most part.<br>  <br>  Look at the Tropicana. Back in the day that was one of the best hotels in town. Look at it now compared to the others, its a joke.|`|UzGGflRfaa	Maybe it was not considered 5 star by todays standards,,,,,but YES it was one of the hottest hotels in its day.........you always here stories of the famous poeple who stayed there and what not...........

Monday through Friday.<br>  There are several communities in Vegas which have man made lakes such as The Lakes.Being from Minnesota originally they appear to be little more than a pond to me but are referred to as lakes here.<br>  Lake Mead Recreation Center is our largest lake and only about 20 minutes from the strip.<br>  As far as terrain besides being mostly desert we have a lot of Caleche which is very hard surface..Red Rock Canyon again just 20 minutes from the strip would also be a Reference for you and you can get that info. on line.Good luck in your research.

Jm3vMKx3aa	Since you ask the question in the US section of Y!A I assume you are a U.S. citizen.<br>  To be able to work in Spain you will need a residence visa which authorizes to work.<br>  In order to get that visa you must find an employer in Spain who is willing to take the burden to apply for an Official Work Authorization from the Spanish labor office. He would have to justify that he is not able to fill his vacancy by the workforce of Spain (14% unemployed) and of the entire European Union.<br>  To tell you the truth, as a student who just has finished college the chances to find an employer willing to take all those administrative burdens to instate a non-European without work experience will be below 0.1%.<br>  <br>  <br>  Source(s):<br>  <a href="http://www.consulate-spain-chicago.com/" rel="nofollow">http://www.consulate-spain-chicago.com/</a>|`|d2lvgxJhaa	You need a job.<br>  <br>  Highest unemployment rate in the EU.<br>  <br>  Good luck.|`|hJZWo2a8aa	Where are you from?, if you are from another EU country it should be pretty simple.|`|D2QrPvrEaa	u need a passport :]<br>  we are waiting u!!

We have puh-lenty of caregivers, live in or otherwise, who are also looking for jobs.<br>  <br>  Bear in mind, too, that we're struggling with an economy that is tanking quickly and so any jobs that are still out there will not go to foreigners but to qualified Canadians. It isn't bigotry on our part - that's just the way it is everywhere in the world. We're having a tough enough time keeping our citizens employed as it is.

143bm6cnaa	Try the Hutch to I-684.  Then I-84 to the Mass Pike.  But going thru the Bronx on Friday afternoon is no peice of cake either.|`|MmTe8W8uaa	Other routes include:<br>  a. Merritt Parkway (becomes the Wilbur Cross Parkway in Milford, CT) to I-91 to I-84, etc.  Shorter mileage and you avoid New Haven.<br>  b. Take I-95 the whole way. However, this may take longer on a summer Friday evening because of Cape Cod traffic.<br>  c. Long Island Expressway or North State Parkway to Long Island, then a ferry to CT or Rhode Island.  This route takes more time, but at least you are on a ferry and can relax, instead of sitting in traffic.  Also, this is the shortest route that does not require going through the Bronx and Westchester County (the others involve driving west to New Jersey, north on the west side of the Hudson, and then crossing back to the east side of the Hudson somewhere upstate; these take a long time because of traffic at the NY to NJ crossings). Taconic Parkway to I-90 east (becomes the Mass Pike).  More mileage, but the Taconic has nicer scenery than I-95 and I-91 do.  Not sure how the time compares.
PA0bGBtCaa	No, you'll be fine. If you look at www.airliners.net, you'll see TONs of airplane pictures taken from inside the plane during flight, and around the airport. There is nothing wrong with it. <br>  <br>  Also, if you do capture airline crews in your photographs, just don't publish them on a website because you could have legal ramifications from it. It's a long shot, but a possibility to consider. Have a good trip!|`|AvjEgmKfaa	I don't think that you'll be asked to stop taking pictures at the gate, but don't take pictures on the airplane if theres a airplane worker nearby.

Your name sais Porn star SINCE 1980. My though was that you were a porn star in 1980, thus making you at least 50 by now. Which sadly is a little too old to start that type of career, in Vegas.  Most people are not porn stars at birth. It was a joke and not meant to be taken seriously.  I am 30, so no, 29 is not too old and there is nothing wrong with being a stripper. Good luck and no hard feelings. People get way to sensitive on these boards.<br>  <br>  Thats cool, no problem. The thing is, ussualy women that work in strip clubs are also strippers. At the least, you would have to wear clothing, or lack of clothing, similar  to what the rest of the girls are wearing. They would probably only hire you if you were willing to strip, or at least give lap dances. You might want to check into being a cocktail waitresses in a casino, or even one of those sexy blackjack dealer girls at a place like pussycat lounge.

keGOvavbaa	Stand by allows you to take a different flight if there is an available seat for you on the flight you wish to take.  The only guarantee that you'll be able to get on the new flight you want is to pay the $150 change fee now.  If you don't pay that fee now and want to take your chances, you can wait until the day of departure and try standby then.  That's when the two options come into play -- pay $50 to guarantee a seat, if it's available, or show up at the airport, pay nothing, and get onto the standby list.
fc61095727fe8a17ac058f0c1b8e3bf2aa	The parking is pretty limited and the security is just OK. I'd suggest taking the metrolink down to there or getting someone to drop you off. <br>  I'd hate to leave my car for an extended time on their lot.|`|BD7yd8D4aa	I would give them a call. If they do I would ask if they have security. This is not in the greatest of areas.<br>  <br>  An alternative might be the Union Station lot. Although not free it is a secure lot and probably wouldn't cost very much for two days parking.

42SipZEPaa	good luck fining a job that will pay your bills in nyc.

LA you have to drive EVERYWHERE its easier to get around in NYC everything is at your fingertips and public transportation is GREAT. IN LA you have to worry about who is going to be the designated driver, gas...NYC is the way to go so MUCH EASIER to get around. just letting you know..<br>  although NYC is SO expensive, i am sure you can find a place to live, just stick to it. you can even move to Brooklyn (best borough besides Manhattan in my opinion) or the Bronx, Queens, etc...Brooklyn is WONDERFUL!! i am from there and i have lived in California for most of my life. going to the city is SUPER easy. i hope i helped!! goodluck! if you need more help just e mail me. actually i didnt really answer your question...i have no idea about the job assistance thing. but its not like you can get all the info. from your work. you can obtain that thru other resources. GOOD LUCK!|`|js2TUHFdaa	Yeah right, if that were the case, we'd all be living in either city! While it may seem spontaneous and fun to just pick up and move to a big city, it's rather idiotic. Have you saved any money? Have you found a job? I'd save up a lot before even considering moving, and then either sign up with a temp agency to help you find a job, or do some serious searching online. NYC is a cut throat city...you'll find yourself homeless if you aren't prepared.|`|AA10609634	Sure, but not many, and that's if you can land them.  What is your area of expertise?

Airlines are very strict on their fare rules, if its non refundable then you can do nothing. Only in a situation of death the ticket is refunded. And yes, the name can not be changed, only she can use the ticket. The professor is the one to blame, he and the college seem very immature putting Your children in such expenses without being sure. Is this the reason that they had to make their own reservations? So the college wont be held responsible?|`|8onnSGXXaa	This may seem a bit of a 'way out' answer....why doesn't she just use the ticket????<br>  <br>  It's valid for a year so she has time to make plans and maybe there are others who have tickets also, they could all still come couldn't they??<br>  <br>  Just because the project is cancelled doesn't mean they cannot use the tickets!!!<br>  <br>  By the way is 'cheap Trip' a travel agent?? If she really doesn't want to use the tickets has she tried getting  a refund direct from the airline??

I got my visa to live and work here and I got in trouble as an adult for fighting and that went to court.

Looking at the rate for large envelope and small packet, the cost is the same regardless if you're sending to UK or Europe, and it's dependent on weight.

HVXtd2Ryaa	The style in Belgium is generally 'smart casual' as in, a plain (generally dark) shirts and a pair of dress pants or nice jeans, elegant but simple skirts etc. <br>  <br>  Have fun on your trip, it's a beautiful place!|`|7jM9Ghchaa	dress code is the same as everywhere jeans and a jumper not forgetting the rain jacket?and at night very well dressed in the night clubs?|`|7DuVshl5aa	Probably the best bet is not to wear tennis shoes.  That's a dead giveaway for an American tourist.  Generally speaking, they like to wear darker colors than we Americans do, as well.  And again, generally speaking (since that's all we can do), European women (that includes in Brussels, of course) dress more formally (and fancier) when they're "out" than do American women.  The ethos is more about appearance, and less about comfort.  <br>  <br>  But don't be ashamed of who you are.  Just be tactful and discrete, and respectful of the fact that people in other countries sometimes do things differently than we do.  Don't walk around Brussels all day in uncomfortable shoes and get blisters and ruin your trip just because you want to "fit in."  Maybe don't wear your Nikes, but just get a comfortable pair of Rockport walking shoes or something.|`|28f3beb29b657d3d0b6851852a284a79aa	Americans dress so funny, the sandals with the white sock (ewwwwwwww), the jeans pulled up nearly to the chest lol,xtra large tshirts, here in Greece there are so many american tourists we all laugh at them... just wear some french clothing like chanel or hermes, you will look fine|`|AA10260836	easy - if you are an american, dont dress like an american, for anyone else from europe, dress normal.

Jm3vMKx3aa	Whether you will need a visa depends on your present status in the United States. <br>  If you have applied for an extension in November 2008 I assume you have done that from India since student visa extensions cannot be applied for in the United States. When you have re-entered the U.S. territory for how long have you been granted to stay on your form I-20/I-94?<br>  If this should still show a validation you will have been on a legal stay in the U.S. and may return to India via Frankfurt visa waived.<br>  <br>  If your granted time of stay on form I-20/I-94 however should have been expired and you are out of status in the U.S. you better get an Airport Transit visa from the German consulate which covers the state where you are living.<br>  <br>  <br>  Source(s):<br>  <a href="http://www.germany.info/Vertretung/usa/en/04__Legal/02__Directory__Services/01__Visa/__Transit__Country__List__Visa.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.germany.info/Vertretung/usa/e...</a><br>  <a href="http://www.germany.info/Vertretung/usa/en/04__Legal/02__Directory__Services/01__Visa/__Transit__Visa.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.germany.info/Vertretung/usa/e...</a><br>  <a href="http://www.germany.info/Vertretung/usa/en/04__Legal/01__Consulate__Finder/List/__Consular__Districts.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.germany.info/Vertretung/usa/e...</a><br>  <a href="http://travel.state.gov/visa/temp/types/types_1268.html#stay" rel="nofollow">http://travel.state.gov/visa/temp/types/...</a><br>  <br>  <br>  Edit: (based on additional question)<br>  The ATV is required regardless how long you stay and even if you do not leave the international transit area of the airport.<br>  <br>  If you should be out of status you should also consider taking a flight via Belgium, Italy or the Netherlands. Those country do not require an ATV from Indian citizens and you may be better off paying some higher air fare instead of €92.00 ATV fee plus €18.00 for registered mail service.|`|sBCUKi5Yaa	Sorry, you will need to get a transit visa.

HvyE4qpYaa	The CORRECT answer is: Sort of. <br>  <br>  If you are flying into Mexico from the Untied States (i.e. Houston to Mexico City or San Antonio to Monterrey) you DEFINITELY need a passport.  If you are travelling by land, you don't need a passport if you are going to stay in the border region.

i2FRvkEpaa	I'll answer in English then, so that it gets posted, lol!<br>  <br>  Yes, I've been to Brazil onc as a journalist (that is, when I was a journalist and dealt a lot with travels), at the invitation of some Brazilian airlines whose name I can't remember right now and the Government of Ceará. I visited Recife and Fortaleza, plus a lot of surrounding areas. I remember I had peixe-agulha with Fafá de Belém. Anyway, since it was a work trip, I had to endure the company of several other journalists that I didn't find too nice and had to visit thousands of hotels, beaches and a few aquaparks. I went in May, so the weather was so-so, but still hot. I stayed at five star hotels. I took buggy rides. Etc. The thing is, the company and the fact that I had to spend most of time visiting hotels and just going to beaches (or going to a forró in Recife that really was just another disco with live music and the young girl journalists wanted to stay there all night *sigh*), when I'm sure that many other things would have entertained me more, made me, well, I wouldn't say dislike it, but like it less. I'm sure there are lots of amazing things to do and see in Brazil. I was just a bit unlucky. Would I go back? I guess. But it's far and expensive. So, first, I'll have to get back to Greece and Italy and go to Cuba, the Dominican Republic, Mexico, Egypt and a few more. If I could, I'd really get back to the States too, but I'm much poorer than what I once was, so... Anither problem, is my girlfriend seems to have something against Brazil. But I'll get back in time. And see things I couldn't see when I went there. In the meantime, saravá procê!|`|CMm8eQwtaa	Oi! Sou Americano, mas morei no Bazil por 16 meses.

0fc71d93282bf1baaa4cd5f250fd7a07aa	In recent years relations between Greece and Turkey have improved, mainly due to Greece's supportive attitude towards Turkey's efforts to join the EU, although various issues have never been fully resolved and remain constant sources of potential conflict. An attempt at rapprochement, dubbed the Davos process, was made in 1988. The retirement of the staunch socialist Greek Prime Minister Andreas Papandreou contributed to this improvement. His son, foreign minister George Papandreou, made considerable progress in improving relations. He found a willing partner in Ismail Cem and later in the Turkish Prime Minister Recep T Erdo?an.<br>  <br>  Relations between Greece and neighboring Turkey improved after successive earthquakes hit both countries in the summer of 1999. The so called "earthquake diplomacy" generated an outpouring of sympathy and generous assistance provided by ordinary Greeks and Turks in both cases. These acts were encouraged from the top and took many foreigners by surprise, preparing the public for a breakthrough in bilateral relations, which had been marred by decades of hostility over anti-Greek pograms, territorial disputes and the situation in the divided island of Cyprus. Ten years later, Greece has become one of the key supporters of Turkey's struggle to enter the European Union. Yet, despite the confidence Greece and Cyprus have shown, voting YES for Turkey in order to begin its entry negotiations with the European Union in October 2005.<br>  <br>  Greek Ambassador in Ankara George Yennimatas said that the trade volume between Turkey and Greece reached 2.2 billion Euro after 1999, adding that the target is to rise this figure to 5 billion Euro as soon as possible.Speaking in a meeting on Turkish-Greek relations in Istanbul, Yennimatas said that very important economic developments were recorded between the two countries in recent period which were inauguration of Turkey-Greece natural gas pipeline and mutual investments in banking sector.Yennimatas called on participants of the meeting to further develop the business relations between Turkey and Greece.|`|7vD4dBK4aa	apart from the first answer the two people who answered you are greek Trolls with the mind of a 5 year old racists wich get 5000$ a year so work it out in any case Turkey passes greece out at a lot of things and greece passes turkey (non racist neutral Answer)|`|c815f0954f0cc607a22f3e49bfd31b48aa	Check the EU website, I believe they both trade based on the European Union Trade Agreements.|`|wVJ1jAyJaa	Turkey and Greece have free trade agreements.<br>  Furthermore a Turkish Greek Business Council was founded 2 years ago.<br>  <a href="http://www.greekembassy.org/embassy/Content/en/Article.aspx?office=1&folder=924&article=22323" rel="nofollow">http://www.greekembassy.org/embassy/Cont...</a><br>  Here it is said that the trade volume between the two countries substantially increased during the last years:<br>  <a href="http://www.mfa.gov.tr/turkey_s-commercial-and-economic-relations-with-greece.en.mfa" rel="nofollow">http://www.mfa.gov.tr/turkey_s-commercia...</a>

9oMXpS05aa	i used to live in topeka and found much to do in manhattan! since manhattan is a college town, you'll find plenty of college kids to party with. i remember bar hopping up there and there were some very fun places that we went to. but mostly, it was fun to go to house parties.. manhattan is a very friendly place and most parties are open house. <br>  now, topeka is about 45 minutes away and there are several bars and clubs there. the electric cowboy is one that comes to mind, however i didn't care too much for it.

If the father listed on the birth certificate is not traveling with you, you need a notarized letter from the father giving you permission to take the child.

But I would still have it just in case.|`|siHN027laa	Previous answer was right on.<br>  Went through that myself.|`|WSpWoKw5aa	I went when I was a minor, and I only went with my mother, so I had to have a notarized letter from my father saying it was ok for me to cross the country border and my birth certificate I also had to take.

There are a lot of D.I.Y shops that have a craft/hobby section.  i'm sure in a big city like Milan you will be able to find everything you need.

And very reasonably priced.<br>  There is nothing in the middle of Napa/Sonona.  Santa Rosa is about 45 mins away from Sonona.

Some nice hotels in Napa valley that are reasonable are: John Muir inn, Napa, Best Western in Napa and Calistoga, Chablis Inn, Napa. The Lodge at Calistoga, Napa Valley travel lodge, and Chardonnay lodge, Napa. Those are all the most affordable hotels in Napa that are all nice, not real fancy, but good for the price. You will notice that these are all in either Napa or Calistoga. Everything in Yountville or St Helena are pricey. BTW, the wine train is really fun. Also consider going to Castello di Amerosa winery for the most increadable castle in the valley.

Use this bridge to enter Mexico, and once you leave the border area, you shouldn't encounter any problems.  <br>  <br>  Also, remember to buy insurance for your car at the border and buy a permit... once you go 50km inland there's a checkpoint and your car needs to have a temporary impor sticker on it.|`|t3Zuec0taa	Nowadays, then entire border is in the middle of a turf war between the governments and drug cartels...perhaps you should postpone your trip.

There has been no malaria in Puerto Plata or anywhere on the north coast ever. In general, the closer you are to the border with Haiti, the greater a risk, however according to Canada's Health Department, there are some risks in the Punta Cana/Bavaro area too:<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.phac-aspc.gc.ca//tmp-pmv/2008/mal-081204-eng.php" rel="nofollow">http://www.phac-aspc.gc.ca//tmp-pmv/2008...</a><br>  <br>  I went to the DR several times and never took any anti-malaria pills (whoever mentioned injection before obviously didn't know that anti malaria vaccination is not injected - there is no vaccine available against malaria, however you can take pills to minimize chances of infection).<br>  <br>  The best advice is to consult with your general practitioner. Another option is to take Chloriquine as a precaution - for sheer sake of peace of mind. Chloriquine is cheap, without the coverage, the cost of the pills is only about $13. So considering cost involved buying pills vs. risks involved contracting malaria, one should play it safe and go for the $13. Not sure about the side effects though.

2HETgiwgaa	I live in Dunedin, and I love it - did try living in Canterbury - but took less than a year to decide to come back.<br>  <br>  There are usually job opportunities at the local public hospital - which has links to the Otago Medical School - just across the road.  There is also a private hospital and other health sector jobs.  There are professional firefighters here, but I don't know how often they have vacancies (Dunedin has an airport, and it has its own firefighters).<br>  <br>  There are a lot of very good childcare facilities - though spare places can be limited in times.  I'm very happy with my son's primary school - and there are lots of other good ones that we could have chosen. Likewise at secondary level, there are several very good schools.  If you would like your children to have a tertiary education here, we also have a great university - the University of Otago - and polytechnic.<br>  <br>  The weather is cooler than more northern parts, but coming from the UK I don't think you would find it too bad.  It has beaches, parks and gardens, walking tracks, a very good art gallery and muesum, and lots of other things to offer - and most things are within walking distance. Because it is a university city, Dunedin has a pretty vibrant nightlife - and lots of other cultural and sporting opportunities as well.<br>  <br>  Without going outside the city boundary, you can see seals, penguins, and the only mainland colony of Royal Albatross.  It has a great harbour that is popular with salmon fishers, windsurfers and sailers. Russell Coutts (America's Cup skipper) grew up and got his start in sailing here.  The local beaches are very popular for surfing - when there's good surf on you'll usually see surfers, even in the middle of winter (nice thick wet suits help :-))<br>  <br>  It's also handily located for getting to some of the best scenery in New Zealand - Fiordland and central Otago (including Queenstown) for a start. <br>  <br>  A recent survey rated Dunedin the best city community in New Zealand - so you don't have to take my word for it :-) But, I'm sure you'll love it in NZ wherever you choose to settle.|`|f610fce787e6299e681ff222a3173ed5aa	Your best bet for jobs & opportunities are all the cities, Auckland, Wellington, Dunedin, Christchurch.  And I guess Hamilton too.<br>  <br>  Dunedin has some super cheap housing but it can get very cold there & unsure about fire fighting jobs, he might have to switch to something else.  If you're a nurse or doctor then that should be fine anywhere.<br>  <br>  If you want to be reminded of the UK, then Christchurch looks like an English city.  For warmer weather, in Summer Chch can be surprisingly hot, considering it snows in Winter (temperatures can get to 35 degrees at times like they did this Summer) & Auckland is warmer & closer to beaches in Northland & the Coromandel.  Auckland itself has 100 beaches within & around it.  So it kind of depends what you're looking for.<br>  <br>  Wellington is very friendly & easy for newcomers for that reason (they are used to newcomers as so many people move there for Government jobs from overseas & other parts of NZ) & great on a sunny day, but it's downfall is the awful wind & Winters can get depressing as it's cold but also with that non stop wind.<br>  <br>  Hamilton is in the Waikato, which has very cold, damp Winters.  Housing would be cheap though & they have a hospital for work.<br>  <br>  Auckland has the most expensive housing, but is the best place for job opportunities.  If you are white you might find it a bit brown though - it's 50% non white people - South East Asian, Chinese, Indian, Pacific Island & Maori.  No one in Auckland notices really as it's always been multicultural here & racism isn't common, but people from overseas might not like it.  Places like London & Sydney are more like 30% non white & you here them complaining about that.....<br>  <br>  Personally  I like the multicultural thing & would be bored somewhere like Christhchurch where it's so white.<br>  <br>  I think you really need to holiday here first & make up your own mind which you prefer.|`|rvTcDJ6yaa	This is from a kiwi point of view. I like Christchurch. its the largest city ( pop around 400,000)in the South Island so it has oppourtunities for jobs and good facilitities, its close to a few beaches, not too far from ski fields ( in fact you can go swimming and skiiing in the same day at times!), there are places for walks and mountain biking...and if you wanted to go out there are a few places to go.<br>  <br>  There are good schools in Chch..but it depends on what kind of school you want...it depends on where you live.....MAINLY those in the west and central are considered better ( but are exceptions). THere are several areas that are on the outskirts of chch if you want to be more out of the city eg Rollerston ( the town of the future..or so the name says) maybe  even Rangiora...<br>  Anmyway just throwing it out there. I love Chch and have spent many years living there on and off ( eg to go to university). It has a nice feel ( and it is ironically called a city more english than england!) .
AA10100324	a paper mill in oregon was the only one i remember. amazing this place was. why? im sure the equipment being so loud and the size of it all was key|`|AA11304400	When I was in 11th grade...about 7 years ago.  We took a trip to the Rock N Roll hall of fame.  We were loud and obnoxious.  Mooned people out of the windows of the bus...  threw stuff at the other cars.  Got the driver pulled over, got her a ticket.  He he.<br>  <br>  Ran around like lunitics.  Flirted with other boys there, and workers.  Got some phone numbers, gave out more.  <br>  <br>  To top it all off, on the way back, the bus driver was still so mad at us that she refused to pull over, even when this guy had to pee so bad.  She didn't care and he ended up peeing his pants.  Sad, but morbidly funny.  After that, I'm glad to say she got fired.  Bad bus driver lady.|`|72d9de10a2ab1169978957e193ac7e9eaa	I say Fort Laderdale! Lago Mar! Great service, people from all over the world and awesome food. Also it's right on the ocean, and there are workers that actually care about you and your family. Good Times!!

Es una pintoresca ciudad de la Provincia de Buenos Aires, que está a 300 km. de la capital de la República Argentina. No sé si es la más bella, pero, sí es seguro que tiene todas las cualidades que nombraste y más... Durante toda mi vida he pensado y pienso que de tener la posibilidad de recorrer un país, sería en el mío, ya que considero que tiene una diversidad extraordinaria de paisajes, tradición y gente. ???Lugar muy recomendado para visitar!!! Algunos lugares, entre otros, para no perderse: el Calvario, el Centinela, el Parque, la Piedra Movediza, el Dique, el Cerrito, el Manantial de los Amores... ???Buen viaje!!!

zNlLFA7Waa	mira , acabo de ir a teziutlan en semana santa y recorri el camino por  la ruta de amozoc , pero conozco tambien la siguiente y es mas recomendable y rapida. de la ciudad de mexico toma la autopista a puebla y toma la desviacion hacia tlaxcala ( te recomiendo conocer la ciudad ,es preciosa) continuas hacia apizaco tomando el libramiento hacia huamantla , continuas hasta llegar a tequisquitla de ahi tomas en el punto conocido como 4 caminos hacia la izquierda rumbo a oriental(hay se?alamientos), de ahi a libres y toma la autopista a teziutlan, son 2 casetas y aprox. 50 pesos.|`|4lMYsgjNaa	Hola, qué tal?? Soy Teziuteco, y pues la verdad no es un paraiso, sí tiene alguno que otro lugar cerca para conocer como lo es los 9 manantiales de Chignautla (a 15 mins de Teziu), Zacapoaxtla y Cuetzalan (a 1 hora y a 1 hora y media, en Cuetzalan grabaron su video de NUBES los CAIFANES). Si te gusta ir de excursión, puedes subir el cerro de Texaxaca o ir al cerro de las 3 cruces. En fin, tienes varias opciones, Teziutlán está creciendo poco a poco y es bonito para visitar, pero es una ciudad peque?a y con poco lugar turístico. Si te interesa puedes ir a la casa de la cultura y conocer la vida de Don Manuel ávila Camacho (sí, el ex-presidente de México, también Teziuteco)<br>  <br>   Bueno, para llegar más fácil y sin contratiempos, al llegar a la ciudad de Puebla (que es donde vivo ahora) desde la autopista México, no entres a la ciudad, sólo sigue de largo por la misma autopista hasta la Caseta de Amozoc, en esa caseta tienes que entrar a tu extrema derecha hacía Oriental, llegando a Oriental (a 1 hora de Puebla) puedes irte por carretera libre (no te lo recomiendo a menos que quieras conocer tooooooodos los pueblitos y municipios que te encontraras durante 2 hora y media) o bien tomar la autopista que te lleva de Oriental a Teziutlán en 1 hora.<br>  <br>    Espero te sirva mi ayuda. Un saludo y disfruta de tu viaje!!<br>  <br>    Atte Chip Volta<br>  <br>    Ah! Ya como comercial, si quieres puedes conocerme si ves Azteca 7 en la primera semana de Mayo, ya que vamos de gira por Quintana Roo y estaremos con Jorge Garralda, mi grupo de electro-pop se llama m&c-pation. Gracias!!<br>  <br>  www.myspace.com/mncpation|`|XrZj7Qgoaa	Hola!<br>  <br>  Si vas primero a la Ciudad de Mexico, para llegar a Teziutlan es fácil, toma la carretera a Pueble, de ahí, cruzas la ciudad y busca la carretera que se dirige a la ciudad de Jalapa, en Veracruz, de camino a Jalapa veras una desviación hacia Teziutlan es ya muy cerca del pueblo de "Perote" que es el ultimo de Puebla antes de entrar a Veracruz. Por cierto si, Teziutlan es bonito, pero ya que andes por allá, no pierdas la oportunidad de visitar Jalapa, es una ciudad de muchos estudiantes y una de las mas bellas de Mexico, no te arrepentirás!<br>  <br>  Saludos.|`|81340f533010be5c5cbe492b7757007daa	pues ya gano chip, es la informacion 100% correcta, la primera respuesta tuvo buenas intenciones pero esta incorrecta, pues omite muchisimos detalles, además te manda a dar la vueltota hasta Perote, que no es Puebla sino Veracruz.<br>  Lo bueno de teziutlan  - si a ti te gusta- son los paisajes con neblina y el clima tipo londinenese, jaja a ver si no te sale el hombre lobo.|`|fc3708ed4398a8b3afd57e2cdb827f83aa	Buena respuesta la de Lou<br>  Teziutlan es conocida como la Perla de la Sierra....pero no es paradisiaco, mas bien es folklorico y provinciano<br>  <br>  Las indicaciones son las correctas, bajar a Mexico es otro Boleto<br>  <br>  Suerte en tu viaje
