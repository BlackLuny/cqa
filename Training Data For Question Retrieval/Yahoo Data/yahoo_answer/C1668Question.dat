20090128143133AA2j9cW	Travel;Travel (General);Other - Destinations	Should i fly or drive with my son?	So... I have a HUGE dilema...       In February we are going to see my husband graduate from Basic Training, I live in MN and its in Oklahoma. It would be a 15 hour straight drive there, but it would take much longer considering all the stopping we would have to do for feedings and changings. I would be riding with my mother in law and my hubbys aunt and uncle, so I wouldnt be me actually driving.       I also have the option of flying. But I would have to go alone, because I dont have anyone who would come with me, because they cannot afford it. It would be a 4 hour drive to the Minneapolis airport, someone would bring us there. I would have a 2 hour flight to dallas with a 3 hour layover and then a half hour flight after that. and ten only about a 10 minute taxi ride to the hotel, where i would meet my mother in law and others. as for my luggage i would just send it with my mother in law, so I wouldnt have to worry about it.       So, what would you do in my situation?

20090225131949AA0DK5W	Travel;Caribbean;Jamaica	Has anyone stayed in the Riu Negril resort and went on the Bob Marley Nine Mile excursion?	I know that the Riu Ocho Rios resort offers the excursion to visit Marley's home in Nine Mile and smoke buds with that crazy rasta tourguide, and our travel agent said that Nine Mile is about an hour and forty-five minutes from the Negril resort, which is where my family would like to stay.       Since i'm the only one in my family who listens to reggae at all, i would be the only one going so i wouldn't mind the 1hr 45min bus ride from negril if i had to. I'm asking because my family and I have heard that the Negril resort is much nicer and there is a lot more to do in that area rather than Ocho Rios.
