I think it's healthier and also more humane as they are killed by rifles and not slaughter-houses, and also because it means that something useful can be done with kangaroos apart from culling their over-populated mobs.

20090129061614AAKISyu	Food & Drink;Vegetarian & Vegan	This is strange.  Not eating meat = severe pain in hip?	4 weeks ago I stopped eating meat for health reasons.  It's been going fine.  Last week I suddenly developed a severe pain in my left hip/pelvis that made it very hard to even walk normally.  During that time I had some fish and once pork sausage.  The pain never changed.  Last night I ate a huge serving of pot roast because a relative brought it over for dinner.        A couple hours after dinner the pain started to lessen, but I didn't give it much thought.  Today I woke up and the pain is COMPLETELY GONE without a trace!  Obviously I am not getting a nutrient or something that the meat provided.        What could it be?  I haven't been eating a lot of vegetables, mostly soy products, beans, and potatoes.  I get B12 through supplements but having been a meatatarian for many years I'm sure that's not low.

I've NEVER gone beyond an egg in my life...but I AM pretty liberal so I think that maybe trying meat once and not swallowing it might be, well...forgivable. I got cheated into trying shrimp and I spat it out too..      So is it alright to try it once? I am not a person who doesn't care    if animals are slaughtered..I was vegan for a while too, but had to stop because of advice from family and teachers etc..      It would be nice if I mainly got answers from these people:      vegetarians   Vegans   Hindus   Animals rights enforcers      Forgive me If I sound stupid,   But I WILL get angry and offended If anyone insults me or anyone else for being a veg. and/or Hindu.

20090129082000AAHWQOo	Food & Drink;Vegetarian & Vegan	I have tried the vegan lifestyle for about 2 weeks now,  i'm having difficulty with it.?	I have been a vegetarian for 9 years and recently became a vegan.  I use vegan butter and cheese and drink soy milk now.  I feel like I'm not getting proper nutrients.  I hear alot of vegans say how healthy and great they feel but I don't feel that way.  My boyfriend isn't a vegetarian but doesn't eat alot of meat.  We live together though so it's hard to make meals.  We still have food in our cabinets that are portioned for at least two people, but i cannot eat them anymore.  I feel like it's going to waste and since we already bought the food I should at least eat it, but I don't know if that would be right.  I try to remind myself of what the animals went through and that i don't need certain foods but it's still extremely hard at times.  Even when I think I'm eating vegan, pizza with no cheese on it, i find out that the crust or sauce has eggs/milk in it.  There seems to be alot of research.  I don't want to give up on it but would like some advice.  Are there any websites that let you know what restaurants have vegan items?  Do you think it's hypocritical to eat food that was already bought instead of just throwing it away?  Any help would be appreciated!

I've asked people to dress up as characters from the show and I was wondering if anyone had any friends related ideas i could use to decorate my house, what food to serve etc.     so far i've thought of having cup banners like in the one where phoebe is in charge of cups and ice, buying a magna doodle to put on the back of the door and making a central perk sign to stick above the buffet table!    any help would be appriciated! thanks!     x
