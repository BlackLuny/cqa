20090225025829AA9bWiM	Consumer Electronics;Games & Gear;PlayStation	Known problems with PS3?	I've had different problems with my PS3 by times.  And a few when playing dvd's.         Starting with my gaming problems first:      When playing Assasins Creed it would freeze by times and I would be forced to restart the game or sometimes it would unfreeze itself.      Ghost Recon 2 Advanced Warfighter and Rainbow Six Vegas 2 while playing both would stop by times switch to a black screen on my t.v. and then switch to the PS3 options screen ( user names,memory used,turning off the system with touching the button on the cosole itself ).  That's happend more than once.      My dvd problems ( regular dvd's not blu-ray ) I bought 30 days of night and played it only on my PS3 so I know something is up with my PS3 but I've had some form of burn mark is the best way to describe it the size of half a nickel on the edge of the dvd.  That's more serious problem with my dvds.         The other problem with my PS3 playing dvd's is minor in comparison to the burn mark on my one dvd.  In the beginning when I played my dvd's it remembered where I was last if I stopped watching a movie before it ended.  Now it doesn't do that anymore.      Has anyone else experienced similar problems like this on their PS3's?  What did you do to fix them or did you need to trade them back in?  Mine is still under warranty thank God so if it's something with the system than I will bring it back and get a new one.      The only other info I can give is my PS3 console is in my t.v. stand it has some space all around it and I leave the door open so that it doesn't get too hot.  Also I clean it off of dust like every 2 days.        Thanks for any and all help with my questions.

Price is also an important factor due to our limited budget. If you have any suggestions, these would be really appreciated.

I have recently bought a belkin 54g wireless router, so that my partner can play his ps3 online while im online on my laptop :) The ps3 works perfectly fine with the modem we have from our internet provider but when we use the wireless, he keeps getting signed out of the playstation network after a few mins displaying the error code 8002AD23. Even if he connects to the wireless router with the cable, this still happens??? Its only ok when using the modem from our internet provider, I would be very grateful if anyone can help me please. Many Thanks!! ;)

How interesting it would be to have a digicam that can see with binocular vision ( binocular vision is how humans see. Vision based on two visual input sources that are slightly off center from one another and have one central processing unit i.e. the brain).    I have been thinking about doing a video blog like Mordeth 13  does but I was thinking that have 2 cameras attached to my helmet would give a better view of the world by give a much more real angle of vision and sense of depth to the videos. I have seen dozens of different helmet mounted cameras, and I know that at one time M13 use to use a digicam in his helmet to make his riding vlogs I am not sure how he does it now.    Is it possible to make a binocular vision camera set up? Any info on this would be very useful.    Thanks

20090202093829AAlhd5W	Consumer Electronics;Games & Gear;Nintendo Wii	Selling my Wii.  Do I need to format my Wii for my protection? ?	Ok, I'm selling my Wii because I don't play it anymore. My questions are but more importantly the first one:      1) I have some games downloaded onto my Wii and I saw that if you take away your account you have to get rid of the games that you downloaded. Is there any reason for me to do this for my protection? I would rather keep the games on there to potentially get more money. But if it means that I have to compromise any of my personal information then I'll get rid of them.         2) I know this is just speculation but what would you expect me to get out of my Wii with the following games/items?      Nintendo Wii Console   4 Wii Remotes   4 Wii Nunchuks   2 Wii Classic Controllers   1 Gamecube Memory Card      Wii Games:   Wii Sports   Wii Play   Blazing Angels 1   Super Mario Galaxy   The Legend of Zelda: Twilight Princess   M&Ms Racing   GT Pro Series   Game Party   Rampage Total Destruction      Gamecube Games:   The Legend of Zelda: The Wind Waker   Mario Kart Double Dash   Star Wars Rogue Leader   Metroid Prime    Metroid Prime 2   Soul Calibur         Wii Shop Games:   Mario Kart 64   Super Mario World   The Legend of Zelda: A Link to the Past   Street Fighter 2 Turbo   Contra 3   The Legend of Zelda    The Legend of Zelda 2   Super Mario Brothers   Super Mario Brothers 3   Super Mario 64   Metroid   Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles   Ninja Gaiden   Gradius 3   Excitebike

Barring that, does anyone know of a free DRM converter that doesn't have a time limit on the conversions, isn't a torrent, and works without iTunes. I've been searching for weeks and all the ones I've found require that I have iTunes on my computer, which I don't.      Thanks!

20090202103659AAXkA8l	Consumer Electronics;Music & Music Players	Why are records popular but not cassettes?	As I understand it, records are regaining popularity because:      A) People aren't using sufficient bitrates for digital recordings (resulting in "tinny" sound)   B) Clipping due to record companies recording at high volumes   C) People mistakenly believing that records have a "warm" sound that cannot be replicated with postprocessing.      During the 90s, I remember cassettes being quite popular.  So, why, then, are people reverting all the way back to records?  Surely one can store more of those.

Is there anyway that I can retrieve the thumbnail pictures from the camera instead of the actual picture as the thumbnails are fine???  I hope you understand what I mean ha ha!

20090203144717AAySON3	Consumer Electronics;Cell Phones & Plans	Is it OK to turn on a new cell phone during first charge?	I just got the LG Voyager in the mail today. I take it out, put the battery in, and plug it in. So it's charging. I know already that the first charge is important to determine battery life, and you should let it fully charge. I open up the little books they give you, and see what they say. It says for the first charge: Install battery, plug in to charge. Press the End button until screen light up. So I'm thinking "Whoops, I didn't turn it on." So I go and turn it on. I then look back at the book and to my dismay it says "It is important to not turn on the phone until it is fully charged." So... you know... wtf. I should have seen that before. My question is, is the battery life going to be affected? I don't think so. I never unplugged it while charging, and it was only on for maybe 30 seconds. At least, I hope it should be fine.

20090203143145AAxwamT	Consumer Electronics;Games & Gear;PlayStation	How to play copied PSX games on PS2?	Ok so I know of the one method where you need the old ps2, and the slide card. Been there, and it just broke my ps2. So now I have a new ps2, the slim one.      I am pretty sure I remember reading something about playing a backed up copy of psx(ps1) games on the slim ps2 without needing anything more, because the slim has the flip top tray, instead of the sliding tray.       I have capabilities of copying and burning one of my ps1 discs, I have gameshark 2 version 4.       What I'm hoping I guess is for someone to tell me how to do this easily. I'm hoping all it will involve is having a burnt copy of my game, a ps1 game, and my gameshark. I need someone to confirm this, or tell me how to go about doing this with a slim ps2, before I waste a few blank cds.      Thanks for the time and help

I had a ps3 for almost a year and played gta online extensively, and rarely if ever was I brought back to the same room after leaving.  I'm talking about free mode btw.

Restarting the game doesn't help, waiting a bit doesn't help...       Does this happen to you guys?  Is there some way I can fix it?

20090203144315AAieMoS	Consumer Electronics;Games & Gear;Nintendo Wii	Article on yahoo about wii fit?	i just got done reading the article about wii fit and how its to blame nintendo wii for making something that they knew people wouldn't use! thats ridiculous! even if u did know that they wouldn't use it that is a good way to make some bucks! i mean it probably costs 5 dollars to make a wii balance board and cd together... so why is it nintendo's fault for wanting to make money off of a game? i mean im fit but i still have the game and play it alteast once a week! i think its dumb to simply blame nintendo for wanting to make money! and the game isn't that bad... i love it... it combines exercise with fun so if ur not gonna use a game that u wasted ur precious money on then its ur own fault not nintendo's!!! does anyone agree with me and what do u have to say about the article?

If you have any other camera as a suggestion...PLEASE let me know! Thank you! :)
