2f739e8b2a5530e501bad3e76a9cb2f7aa	Giving a lot of answers with some Best Answers, in one category, gets you the TC label. Rumor is 45-50 answers in one month, with 10% of them being Best Answers. Updates are made on Mondays. <br>  Here is the YA Help link: <a href="http://help.yahoo.com/l/us/yahoo/answers/network/contributor.html">http://help.yahoo.com/l/us/yahoo/answers...</a><br>  <br>  There seems to be a lag time between earning the TC badge and getting the badge posted to your avatar. It seems that the number of answers/Best Answers that are required may vary from category to category. I think this may be due to the actual number of questions in the category. Categories with MORE questions may require MORE answers/Best Answers to get the TC badge.<br>  <br>  I got mine in Yahoo -- Other Products once with 12 answers and 3 Best Answers! But the one in Yahoo -- Yahoo Answers takes a LOT more than that to get.

oOWcGuzoaa	don't you hate it when someone begins his or her reply with this self-serving retort, "that's not the question.  the REAL question is..." and they present an alternative question meant to deflect your question and obscure their own ignorance.  i'm always tempted to say, "No, that IS the question.  i know, because i asked it."<br>  <br>       i think i know where you're coming from and so in keeping with the spirit of the question i would ask them, "why do you insist its true when it hasn't yet been proved"?<br>  <br>       it is, after all science since they meticuously apply theory, hypothesis and testing, etc. models.  Their conclusions are arrived at through scientific method . But if you're not careful they are tempting, sexy, beguiling yet seemingly rational.    slow, deliberate, painstaking deed and thought are poor substitutes for logic.<br>  <br>       so even though they are wrong, or at least not proven right, science still gains even by not proving the hypothesis--in other words not rejecting the null hypothesis. thus it is science so long as proper scientific method is applied.  but you are right if faulty conclusions are reached because of pre-conceived notions, prejudice and yes, hate.<br>  <br>       so they are wrong that evolution is proved theory.  yes tall giraffes reaching the leaves of tall trees crowd out over time the short ones.  Mendel was the pea-d piper.  and british researchers faked their black and white moth observations during the industrial revolution but could've looked elsewhere to prove what they really were discovering.  that's right ---natural selection, not evolution.  you say you want an evolution? welll ya know, we all wanna see the plan.<br>  <br>       there simply is no proof that lower species somehow leapt upward to form another species in a lock step hierarchal ascent, while at the same time contradicting natural seletion law and not being devoured by their successors.  there's always at least one final piece in the puzzle missing to link one species to his superior.<br>  <br>       can anyone say intelligent design?<br>  <br>       but these scientists see themselves as reasoned, rational, above the fray, smarter-than-the rest-of-you guys, unaffected by the whims and folly of the great unwashed, us vulgar people.  anyone who doesn't believe- in them- is a looney who must believe that the world was created in seven 24 hr days complete with (ah-ha caught you) tree rings and time worn shark fangs belying their age.<br>  <br>       moreover you must be a republican     and bush lied.  and anyway God doesn't exist, but if he does, well, ther's a separation between church and state even though the rules we play by triumphantly announce to all who wish to be free "we are endowed by our creator".<br>  <br>      and his name is gepetto               and by the way bush is stupid and he lied.|`|tHpamxotaa	It hasn't been disproved|`|XWrojqwQaa	its not a disproved theory

VQdqogD7aa	It sounds like your taskbar is set to autohide.  Right click an open area on the taskbar and click Properties and uncheck the box for auto hide.  If you want to keep your taskbar in auto hide mode, then you have to reduce the size of the Firefox window.  Click the double box (restore down) between the "-" and "X" in the upper right corner of Firefox.  After that you can drag the bottom edge of the Firefox to where you want it (same for top and sides).  :-)
PHBqB5qhaa	The answer from "I Know Best" is correct.  During the installation of the Yahoo toolbar there are a bunch of boxes to check/uncheck.

Yahoo! installer thinks that the stuff is already installed.  Only way I know to get around the problem is to remove some Registry Keys using Microsoft Regedit.  Not for the weak of heart.

If not, right click Tools and click Customize and add the mail button to the IE Command Bar.  After that, click Tools, click Internet Options and click the Programs Tab.  Then click the down arrow to the right of where it says email.  You should see an entry for Yahoo! Mail.  Sometimes Yahoo! Mail will not show up in the list (re-install the Y! Toolbar/Y! Messenger).

7dd4551dd14a193bbe6c6ad7c8445666aa	On the bar, it should have something that says: "delete toolbar". Maybe you have to right click on it to see it. I used to have the GOOGLE toolbar, and I decided to delete it. I had the program save in my computer, and right there I could delete it. It was like the same thing you tried on your toolbar but it didn't work. Maybe yours has a different way to find settings and stuff like that. BUT the BEST thing to do is e-mail the company about how to delete it. Or e-mail the person who organizes the whole toolbar orginization. They should reply less than a week.

The same goes for children, btw, they are not always comfortable with the (otherwise normal&natural) idea of their parents having sex.<br>  <br>  I'm not saying you shouldn't have the talk, as contraception is something you should discuss with your mother, older sister, relative and your doctor.

cIZS6Wr2aa	A.D. (or AD) (Anno Domini)<br>  <br>  Definition: The initials A.D. (used with or without periods) is an abbreviation for the Latin "Anno Domini", which translates to "the Year of Our Lord," referring to years after the birth of Jesus Christ. This is the modern calendar that most of the west (in fact, most of the world), uses. Because the term is specific to the Christian religion, however, some scholars prefer to use "C.E." instead, which means "the Common Era."<br>  <br>  Amy's baby is a boy and gets adopted.<br>  <br>  And lastly, this answers your question about storing the water.

7u77AiBjaa	People lose 360 spaces when they switch ISP providers sometimes. It often happens because the 360 space was created on the e-mail address the ISP provided, rather than a Yahoo account created & controlled by the user. You say the e-mail address had nothing to do with your ISP, but sometimes teaming up with certain ISPs (like Yahoo's AT&T service) can alter your prior setup with that Yahoo account. The different computer doesn't affect the situation though.<br>  <br>  You will have to contact the ISP(s) about your lost Yahoo! 360 space, to see if it can be reactivated. You can also try contacting Yahoo by using these forms - <a href="http://help.yahoo.com/l/us/yahoo/edit/registration/general.html">http://help.yahoo.com/l/us/yahoo/edit/re...</a> and <a href="http://help.yahoo.com/l/us/yahoo/edit/registration/deletion.html">http://help.yahoo.com/l/us/yahoo/edit/re...</a> . When dealing with customer service, sometimes it's necessary to be persistent and aggressive. You can also call 1-866-562-7219, 1-408-349-1572, 1-408-349-3300 Hours: 8a-5p M-F (Pacific). Ask to speak to supervisors and managers.<br>  <br>  Other than that, start over with the 360 space that you have at <a href="http://360.yahoo.com/profile-dylAbzo8abQoTwgd0RC3ggNT">http://360.yahoo.com/profile-dylAbzo8abQ...</a> .

qzY2tRTeaa	When u dont choose a best answers|`|Ow6lKFXiaa	I'm not sure of the exact meaning of your question so I'll try to cover a few possibilities.<br>  <br>  If you mean why do they leave the main page: It's because they are in voting or have been resolved and have been moved to the respective page.  You can find them there.<br>  <br>  If you mean why do they disappear after 4 days:  1) It's because no answers were received. As there is not enough cyber room to keep all questions open indefinitely, Yahoo has set a 4-day limit for answering. If no answeres are recieved the question is removed completely never to be seen again.<br>  <br>  If you mean why do they not stay open for answering indefinately when you do have some answers:  Again, not enough room so after the 4 days, if you have not chosen a Best Answer, it will be moved into "open voting" where other YA users do the voting for you.<br>  <br>  If none of these were your question, please put in "additional details" to clarify what you need to know.|`|fAMpwF3Aaa	4 days after the questions been asked, and the asker doesn't choose a best answer it will expire and go into voting and the answerer's are left to choose a best answer.<br>  <br>  So choose best answers!!!|`|6rH5pTCqaa	to avoid having someone answer years after the question was asked|`|y6406A92aa	Most of the time questions expire when the asker doesn't choose a Best Answer.|`|752a09253c730785a794709c07fc1192aa	Clear up space in the servers is what I think.
eb4a10b7d0c7b16ef422f23a98ba67beaa	The best way to gain points is to answer and vote to your limit each day, whatever level you are on.<br>  <br>  Visit each day - 1 point<br>  Answer to your limit each day - 2 points each answer - 20 questions - 40 points<br>  Hope for some best answers - 10 points each best answer plus 1 point for every thumbs up (maximum 50 points)<br>  Vote to your limit each day - 1 point each vote - 20 votes - 20 points<br>  If you ask a question, -5 points, pick a best answer, you get 3 points back.<br>  <br>  You can see all the levels and points required using the link.|`|FxAD44Moaa	quitting your job and answering questions all day making it look as if you are an authority on things so you get best answer as often as possible.|`|fAMpwF3Aaa	Answer a lot of questions the best you can and hope to get the best answer, if you do get the best answer that's 10 points plus more points are added for each thumbs up you get.  <br>  <br>    An easier way to get the best answer is to go back to your answers that are in voting and pick yours as the best answer.  If no one else votes for their answer, you got yourself a best answer.<br>  <br>    Or you can go to the home page and vote for questions that have no best answer.  You'lll only get one point per vote but before you know it you'lll be racking up points from all your voting.|`|H6Ps4tbEaa	Be very respectful in your answers you give and answer them with as much detail as possible. That way you'll get 10 points for Best Answer :)<br>  <br>  Sometimes it's smart to go along with the dumb/immature ones instead of nagging at them, so you can get Best Answer haha.<br>  <br>  ALSO: It's pretty smart to answer questions you know other people will not answer. That way the questioner will have no choice haha.
cb1c8e5fcd8492bc3787fd1b614481ecaa	Everything You Ever Wanted To Know About Your Avatar.<br>  <br>  Your avatar can be a cartoon figure or a photo. The cartoon figure is also used in Yahoo Messenger and appears on some customized Yahoo pages. The photo only appears in Yahoo 360 and Yahoo Answers. If you do not have an avatar then a shadow of a male figure appears. It can't be changed to female.<br>  <br>  № 1. If you want a cartoon figure then go to <a href="http://avatars.yahoo.com">http://avatars.yahoo.com</a> and create or modify one and then go to № 3. If you create one of the wrong sex then it can be changed in "preferences".<br>  <br>  № 2. If you would rather have a photo then you must upload it to Yahoo 360 from your computer.  If it is on the web then download it first. Create a Yahoo 360 account if you don't have one. You can get one at <a href="http://360.yahoo.com">http://360.yahoo.com</a> . Click on the "My Page" tab and then "Edit Personal Photos". You are allowed to upload up to four photos there from your computer. Mark the one you want to use as your avatar as primary.<br>  <br>  № 3. Now for either a cartoon or a photo save everything and go back to Yahoo Answers. Click on your old avatar in Yahoo Answers which brings you to your profile. Now go to "Edit My Info". You can pick the cartoon or photo to use.  BE SURE TO PREVIEW AND SAVE (OK) THE PAGE AT THE BOTTOM. Shortcut: <a href="http://answers.yahoo.com/my/my_edit">http://answers.yahoo.com/my/my_edit</a><br>  <br>  NOTE: Many people are having problems with the Yahoo 360 avatar showing up. My only recommendation is to wait or try deleting and recreating it.<br>  <br>  ? ??l???q ?

lWEFIyOxaa	* Is this your homework?<br>  <br>  Here u go<br>  <br>  <br>  Martin Luther King, Jr. (January 15, 1929 – April 4, 1968) was an American clergyman, activist and prominent leader in the African-American civil rights movement. His main legacy was to secure progress on civil rights in the United States and he is frequently referenced as a human rights icon today.<br>  <br>  A Baptist minister,[1] King became a civil rights activist early in his career. He led the 1955 Montgomery Bus Boycott and helped found the Southern Christian Leadership Conference in 1957, serving as its first president.<br>  <br>  King's efforts led to the 1963 March on Washington, where King delivered his “I Have a Dream” speech. There, he raised public consciousness of the civil rights movement and established himself as one of the greatest orators in U.S. history.<br>  <br>  In 1964, King became the youngest person to receive the Nobel Peace Prize for his work to end racial segregation and racial discrimination through civil disobedience and other non-violent means. By the time of his death in 1968, he had refocused his efforts on ending poverty and opposing the Vietnam War, both from a religious perspective.<br>  <br>  King was assassinated on April 4, 1968, in Memphis, Tennessee. He was posthumously awarded the Presidential Medal of Freedom in 1977 and Congressional Gold Medal in 2004; Martin Luther King, Jr. Day was established as a U.S. national holiday in 1986.|`|fAMpwF3Aaa	You might want to try a different section<br>  or you can visit wikipedia

zDQIPFH2aa	When this happens, there are two main reasons:<br>  <br>  1. (least likely) there is a random glitch now and then that just loses the Qs. YA Staff do not care, just delete the old version and reask. If it was a long question with links, ask it in a short version with no links, then finish the question with the links in the added details.<br>  <br>  2. (more likely) you were caught by the prefilter. Exactly how it works is not known, but probably is based on keywords and links you use (to prevent spamming). These questions are held for the YA Staff to review. It is usually for hours during the week, but can be days on weekends and holidays.

If not there, check your activity tab in your profile. If nothing about a violation there, then the Q was removed for one of the other reasons.|`|ZA5QTj3Zaa	Because people have no sense of humour and they report the questions.

Or your answer same thing.|`|KsjUQ2Vuaa	it might be innapropriate so someone reports you|`|klOP21xTaa	because they are douche bags thats why.|`|nrqWwQBXaa	some one might have reported you?|`|suPD7c3gaa	Because other Y!A members report them sometimes.  It happens to a lot of people.  You asked a question about why questions get deleted, but don't tell us what a single one of the questions were.  No one can tell you what the violation might  have been if you don't say what the question(s) was... exact wording, not just what it was about.  A question doesn't have to be offensive, rude or contain profanity to be a violation.  Edit your question to add what one or 2 of the questions were that were deleted (they'd be in the violation notice).  Most likely someone here could tell you why they were reported by other members and then deleted by Yahoo.  It really does help to understand why you some questions were violations.... but we need to know what the questions were.<br>  <br>  I just took a look at your questions, and some of them are violations that luckily didn't get reported.  For example, "For fans of the late, great, Elliott Smith...?", is NOT a question at all... that's a violation.

For example, in Germany they have .DE, which means I believe German.<br>  <br>  The COM ports are interfaced by an integrated circuit such as 16550 UART. This IC has seven internal 8-bit registers which hold information and configuration data about which data is to be sent or was received, the baud rate, interrupt configuration and more. In the case of COM1, these registers can be accessed by writing to or reading from the I/O addresses 0x3F8 to 0x3FF.<br>  <br>  If the CPU, for example, wants to send information out on COM1, it writes to I/O port 0x3F8, as this I/O port is "connected" to the UART IC register which holds the information that is to be sent out.

Most browsers have some form of AutoComplete.  You should look at the browser's options to see what is available.  For IE, click the Tools button, click Internet Options, click the Content tab and on that window you will see a Settings Button for AutoComplete.  If you are looking for a forms filler (Auto Fill), then I suggest the google toolbar (toolbar.google.com) for IE and Firefox.  The Yahoo! toolbar does have a refresh button but that is for the toolbar and not the browser  (click the IE Y! toolbar Settings button and you will see Refresh Toolbar on the drop down list).  You probably want the browser Refresh button.  Since you don't say what browser and version you are using, I suggest you hover the mouse over the icons to the left or right of the URL address bar and look at the tool tip.

Like you get people to rate a picture of a nice looking girl, and then change the question to do you like to eat poop? and then all the people will have answered "my favourite!" and " I love it!"|`|hzQDocWaaa	yeh that does suck
gGZz2EGyaa	No I do not think it is a violation, you often see answers that are giving really good advice and they offer to help even more by email  via Yahoo.    You just have to make sure in your profile that you can accept emails and have not blocked it out.<br>  I would not however put your own personal email address on any answers that you give, I personally do not feel that this is a safe thing to do.|`|SOxdyWQOaa	it depends on people some do some don't I think it is not|`|suPD7c3gaa	Do your best to make sure your answer is clear.  If you think the asker might have questions, there's nothing wring with letting them know they can email you if have they have questions... but ONLY through Yahoo! Answers.  But before you suggest that, you'd have to check to see if they even allow email, and you would have to have chosen the option when editing your profile, to allow email as well.  All email addresses remain anonymous at all times when emailing through Yahoo! Answers.  You should never post your actual email address here or on any open/public forum.|`|JhvqUvlsaa	No not at all. As long as you gave the best answer you could and this offer to email you was simply included in your answer. It would be a violation if you said "Idk; answer mine?" Simply because it doesn't answer the question and is a "no effort answer."|`|zDQIPFH2aa	If you left out the e-mail request and your answer would still stand on its own, then it is probably not a problem.  But if your answer is incomplete, then it could be seen as solicitation or baiting.|`|u7vrul2Faa	It could be seen as solicitation, there are some very picky people on here so be careful.|`|qmRfvTJiaa	no i do not think even i think it is better to clear the confusion in the answer or question

Each user can be a top contributor in a maximum three categories.<br>  You earn it or lose it depending on your recent participation in a certain section.<br>  The more positively you contribute, the more chance there is that you will get a TC badge. Just like featured users or category leaders, it's another way to give credit to community members."<br>  <br>  The TC badge is awarded on the number of questions answered and best answers received by the user in a particular week, in a particular category.<br>  <br>  It is rumoured that you need at least a 10 percent best answers in your chosen category to get a TC badge although the actual percentage and the number of answers is Yahoo's secret. <br>  All you see and read on the subject is speculation, rumour, assumption, imagination, and guesswork.<br>  <br>  A user who is on the leader board may or may not have a TC badge, the criteria is measured on weekly participation in a particular category (number of answers and % of best answers in the category).<br>  <br>  The easiest way to get a TC badge is to concentrate on one category where many questions are asked and hope to get some best answers.<br>  <br>  The Polls and Surveys and Jokes and Riddles categories do not have Top Contributors.<br>  <br>  If you have contributed enough to meet Yahoo's criteria, the orange badge will appear below your avatar on Monday morning.<br>  <br>  It can disappear just as easily on Monday morning, if you don't keep answering questions in your chosen category.|`|QqY8YgGDaa	Why you want to become<br>  -if you can reach your goal without becoming top contributor ,then why you should<br>  -I am not interested to become top contributor|`|5fb39523f75c15b623115ea5cd8f29eeaa	To be a top contributor you need to be knowledgeable in up to three category's. the exact formula is kept secret by yahoo but the common theory is that you need a minimum of 10 percent best answers in each particular  category and is said to be reviewed weekly. <br>  <br>  The top contributor badge is not permanent and can be removed at any time.So choose the category's you feel you can get best answer and research every detail you can find with links to add to the answer and do not answer questions you don't think you can get you best answer (it will lower your percentage of best answers).<br>  For more information read this yahoo blog.<br>  <a href="http://blog.360.yahoo.com/blog-d8pH0dcoRKeB12yOcnUQp.9VCFos?p=19664">http://blog.360.yahoo.com/blog-d8pH0dcoR...</a>|`|5TKEtXERaa	Pick a subject you are knowledgeable about or interested in and try to honestly answer questions in that topic.
