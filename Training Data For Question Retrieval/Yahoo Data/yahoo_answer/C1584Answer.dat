9QBlKlFmaa	The Palestinians already have a state.<br>  <br>  Jordan is indeed Palestine.  This Arab state already was carved out of 76% of mandatory Palestine.  It was first called Transjordan and now is known as Jordan.  It was given as a gift to Emir Abdullah by the British.<br>  <br>  The so-called "occupied" territories of Gaza and Judea and Samaria, known as the West Bank never belonged to the so-called "Palestinians"; Israel won them in a war of self-defense from Egypt and Jordan respectively. Furthermore both countries relinquished their claims to the territories, so whose territory is Israel occupying? The answer is they are not occupied; they are rightfully part of Israel, as is the Golan Heights which Israel also won from Syria in the same war in self-defense. Yet even Israel itself and its supporters have bought into this false narrative of Israel being an occupier. <br>  <br>  <br>  .|`|vHQsz8HHaa	The Jews came to Palestine for a reason, and that reason is certainly not to live peacefully with the Palestinians.<br>  It's to take back the land God took away from them and banish the Palestinian people!|`|i7oHTo9haa	because that just makes matters worse.  It is a trojan horse for a hostile take over from within. They already doing it from Gaza since they were offered land for peace deal.  They don't want peace they want pieces of Israel.  Totally trojan horse. It was a mistake to let them into Gaza. I did not support the disengagement.  Hey don't blame anyone for trying though.  Palestinian? What is Palestinian?<br>  <br>      "The Palestinian people does not exist. The creation of a Palestinian state is only a means for continuing our struggle against the state of Israel." -- PLO Executive Committee member Zuhayr Muhsin, March 31, 1977, interview with the Dutch newspaper Trouw."<br>  <br>      "There is no such country as Palestine. 'Palestine' is a term the Zionists invented. There is no Palestine in the Bible. Our country was for centuries part of Syria. 'Palestine' is alien to us. It is the Zionists who introduced it."- Auni Bey Abdul-Hadi, Syrian Arab leader to British Peel Commission, 1937 -<br>      "There is no such thing as Palestine in history, absolutely not."<br>      - Professor Philip Hitti, Arab historian, 1946 -<br>      "It is common knowledge that Palestine is nothing but Southern Syria."- Rep. of Saudi Arabia at the United Nations, 1956<br>      -Concerning the Holy Land, the chairman of the Syrian Delegation at the Paris Peace Conference in February 1919 stated:<br>      "The only Arab domination since the Conquest in the year 635 hardly lasted, as such, 22 years."<br>  <br>  Palestine and Jordan are one..." said King Abdullah in 1948.<br>  "The truth is that Jordan is Palestine and Palestine is Jordan," said King Hussein of Jordan, in 1981.<br>  "Palestine is Jordan and Jordan is Palestine; there is only one land, with one history and one and the same fate," Prince Hassan of the Jordanian National Assembly was quoted as saying on February 2, 1970.<br>  <br>      "You Arabs admitted that the [Palestinian] cause began after 1967...The Israelis can sue you now, and if they sue you they will win."<br>      Qaddafi to Arab Summit 2008<br>      <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QP2ePHOLSqo" rel="nofollow">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QP2ePHOLS...</a>|`|uyfFGeMsaa	The question reminds me of an old story about a member of whatever ethnic, national, religious, or other group you wish to disparage:<br>  <br>  A man walks into a pizza shop and orders a whole pizza.

There is no infrastructure available for the 1.5 million refugees that will be expelled from Arab lands<br>  <br>  2.

When Israel was established, it welcomed all Arabs within its borders to stay on as full Israeli citizens.  However, many were unwilling to live peacefully with the Jews, and left.<br>  Those who left, and their descendants, remain unwilling to live peacefully with Jews, and continue to say that Israel has no right to exist and that Jews have no right to live there.<br>  This is why most most of the British Mandate of Palestine was used to establish Jordan and a smaller part was used to establish Israel separately.<br>  Although Jordan lives peacefully with Israel, West Bank has broken off from Jordan in its eagerness to do war with Israel; and Gaza has done the same with Egypt.  It seems there is a small population of ungovernable malcontents (anyway they have never managed to govern themselves, and broke off from the countries that were supposed to be governing them.  I hope that in time they can learn to govern themselves.|`|0fW76gB8aa	Israelis and Palestinians do not get along as it is and we do not live in the same areas.

Why should Jews be forced to be subservent & beholden to other again?  <br>  <br>  Israel is big enough for Jews.  If Palestinians don't think what they have is big enough they can be nice enough to Jordan & prove themselves as peaceful enough to convince Jordan to annex them.  Or Eygpt.  Neither country wants them - Jordan because of Arafat's PLO war to take over Jordan.  Eygpt for it's own reasons.<br>  <br>  There are so many Muslim Arab countries.  There are even countries with Palestinians Muslim Arabs such as Syria.  One sliver for Jews -- who have had a presence in the middle east from before there were Arabs there...is not to much to ask.  <br>  <br>  Under one state rule, it would be a Muslim rule eventually.

There is no such thing as an Israeli!What connection do these people have with the land? They are complete strangers. They are european, russian and etheopian jews. They share a common religion not a common ancestry.<br>  <br>  #The chances that the Palestinians are descendants of the ancient Judaic people are much greater than the chances that Israelis are. <br>  <br>  #"Although the myth of an exile from the Jewish homeland (Palestine) does exist in popular Israeli culture, it is negligible in serious Jewish historical discussions. NO historian of the Jewish national movement has ever really believed that the origins of the Jews are ethnically and biologically pure. <br>  <br>  #The story of the Jewish nation -- the transformation of the Jewish people from a group with a shared cultural identity and religious faith into a vanquished "people" -- was a relatively recent invention, hatched in the 19th century by Zionist scholars and advanced by the Israeli academic establishment. ITS ALL FICTION AND A MYTH THAT SERVED AS AN EXCUSE FOR THE ESTABLISHMENT OF THE STATE OF ISRAEL. <br>  <br>  #Palestinian Arabs who have lived for decades under the heel of the modern Israeli state are in fact descended from the very same "children of Israel" described in the Old Testament<br>  <br>  #most modern Israelis aren't descended from the ancient Israelites at all, but are actually a mix of Europeans, North Africans and others who didn't "return" to the scrap of land we now call Israel and establish a new state following the attempt to exterminate them during World War II, but came in and forcefully displaced people whose ancestors had lived there for millennia.<br>  <br>  #the entire tale of the Jewish Diaspora -- the story recounted at Passover tables by Jews around the world every year detailing the ancient Jews' exile from Judea, the years spent wandering through the desert, their escape from the Pharaoh's clutches is all wrong<br>  <br>  <br>  #Romans didn't expel whole nations from their territories. Its estimated that perhaps 10,000 ancient Judeans were vanquished during the Roman wars, and the remaining inhabitants of ancient Judea remained, converting to Islam and assimilating with their conquerors when Arabs subjugated the area. They became the progenitors of today's Palestinian Arabs, many of whom now live as refugees who were exiled from their homeland during the 20th century.|`|PHQy22VUaa	because the jews want a jew state in which they are the majority---  this means getting rid of palestinans some how.. and its horrible how the jew s are going  about it.     israel is NOT A DEMOCRACY it is a theocracy at best. it priveleges the jews.

Eventually, if you have a big enough fan base you will be invited to play at smaller clubs and make a bit of money.  Only a very small percentage of musicians ever get to give up their day jobs.

OcfUTWataa	Have the dance in a movie theater.  The last time I saw a movie the theater had an ad before the movie itself; the ad said the movie theater is available to rent for big events.  You could rent the theater, have musical entertainment set up just past the place where tickets are sold, and people would dance in the rest of the rotunda or in some of the halls (theater would have to be a multiplex). You could have different entertainment or just group discussions in some of the theaters.

PA0bGBtCaa	Well, let me ask you a question "Captain..."<br>  <br>  Besides programming your FMC from the dispatch with your route that is  given to you, talking to ATC before/during/after flight, and setting up the auto pilot, what makes YOUR job so challenging? Especially in modern airplanes where the glass cockpit and modern GPS makes the art of piloting less challenging. <br>  <br>  Okay, now to answer your question. I was an inflight crewmember for a few years. It offered me the most flexibility for me at the time and it was a good way to stay with the airline. In my own spare time, I'm a certificated pilot with an A&P to go with it.<br>  <br>  The first big challenge of being a flight attendant was dealing with the pilots who had "God" complexes. I can probably assume, based on your question, that you could be one of them. After a flight, the crew usually got together for a nightcap at the hotel bar if we had more than 8 hours of rest. In that time, some of the pilots would speak to us like idiots when it came to talking about flying. I never mentioned that I had and A&P license and pilot's license.<br>  <br>  The second big challenging part, for me anyways, was dealing with the passengers. You're behind a bulletproof cockpit door, and only come out when you need to take a piss during the flight. We have to deal with the angry customers while sitting in a GDP on the tarmac for two hours taxiing to takeoff. <br>  <br>  I'm sure there are the flight attendants who spend most of their time while not serving and taking orders that gossip. I really can't say for certain what makes or made the job challenging for some inflights, but those are the main two for me.<br>  <br>  Finally, I met several flight attendants who came from all walks of life.  Sure, you may think that they are "glorified waiters and waitresses," but here's a list of jobs that some of the people I met used to do: NASA engineer, former fighter pilot in the Marines (medically discharged, but could do inflight..), lawyers, doctors looking for career changes, and one guy had 3 MASTERS DEGREES AND A PhD.<br>  <br>  So don't assume that is all they do. Me, like some of those people, just did it because it was something different. Anyways, that's my take on your question. Safe flying up there!<br>  <br>  Cheers<br>  ______________________________________...<br>  <br>  What fear is that?? That the flight attendants will run out of coffee for you guys up front? Because from where I stand, if the plane goes down, you're taking the in-flight with you! It's the same fear all the way around.|`|fEkKuGlEaa	They work with what's euphemistically called "the public." Do you know what it's like for someone to treat you like the mud on the bottom of their shoes and you have to smile the whole time? <br>  <br>  God bless flight attendants!|`|r8rykCkGaa	Warm ginger ale sounds terrible, but the flight attendants I had from the west coast to the east coast (first from north CA to southern CA) and from the east coast to the west coast were very good.  They were very attentive.  They kept giving us little bags of peanuts and stuff.  Went on the red eye flight one way and the day time the other way.  I have read about times when the flight attendants laid down their lives for the passengers too.|`|32dffe7e0eba9eb2c4e6c9418ec99ba5aa	The primary job of a flight attendant is to maximize the survival of passengers in the event of an accident. Since air travel is very safe, they are rarely called upon to carry out their primary responsibility. In this sense, they are much like firefighters.<br>  <br>  Providing cabin service to passengers is a secondary activity that they undertake in order to reassure and please passengers, and to improve public relations for the airline.|`|s2IOyj8iaa	I'm no flight attendant but have travelled a lot and I see their job as very challenging and demanding with a lot of responsibility. They deal with rude and unruly passengers and need to stay calm and polite with it. . they have safety procedures they must follow.I was recently sick on a long haul flight and they where wonderful yes they bought me ginger ale to help settle my stomach they helped me off the plane and arranged for a wheel chair . They are continually looking after passengers. with food drinks and other demands .I've never seen any gossip but have seen them speak to people as part of public relations friendliness.

I am sure they deal with rude travelers, people requesting so much favor that they don't need, and don't forget they are on schedule all the time a way from their families. <br>  <br>  I work as a customer service, in a car rental company. Everyday, I meet about 5-10 customers that simply accuse me of all the problems the company does as If I am in a senior level position to make big changes, such as cheap gas, and giving coupons. I can only do what I can only do, and nothing more. I am sure everyone else who works in customer service goes through this as well. You earned my respect.
65fef61f322f25075280c35b20f9c4f8aa	Not all landlords require a co-signer on a lease. However, they often expect you to pay one or sometimes two months rent in advance. That is to prevent you from skipping out on a lease and to cover damages you may cause to the apartment.<br>  <br>  Being from out of town, you may find it a tough time to rent an apartment, since you won't have a chance to inspect it or see the general area before getting here. Some areas of town are cleaner and safer than other areas, so you may want to do some research on the various burroughs here in Montreal to try and choose something that you won't be unhappy with within days of moving in.<br>  <br>  Look for apartments near public transit (metro/train/bus) if you will not have a car when you get here. Look for one that has available parking if you will be bringing your car - they usually charge extra for that.<br>  <br>  Most leases in Montreal are up on the traditional "moving day" of July 1st (Canada Day). Depending on when you are coming into town, you may simply want to do a long-term rental with a local hotel. That way you have furniture and perhaps a kitchenette to make food, while you go job hunting and apartment hunting here in Montreal. It may seem expensive at $80-120 per night, but when you consider locking yourself into a lease at $8000 or more for a year, without even looking at the apartment or neighbourhood, it may be worth the initial costs of hotel rental.<br>  <br>  I have attached a few links that may be useful for you. The first is the Regie de Logement (Quebec Housing Board) showing your rights as a tenant. Next is a map of the city and its public transportation system. Last is a link to the Hotel Tour Belvedere which has equipped studio apartments they rent for long term.

9f7c8164ca2d49e24413295051f36abaaa	- Visit Louisville, KY. It has the Louisville slugger factory (your husband might like it, I didn't even mind it) you can take a tour of. Also, Churchill Downs. They give tours and there is a museum. Nice little downtown area along the river. Eat at Lynn's Paradise Cafe. (My husband still talks about the hot brown he ate there).<br>  <br>  - Lexington, KY. Visit just north in Georgetown to get some authentic chocolate bourbon balls. Take a free tour of the Toyota plant (really interesting). Then go to Lexington and see the Kentucky Horse Park.<br>  <br>  - Kentucky general: Mammoth Caves National Park and lots of bourbon distilleries<br>  <br>  - Cleveland, OH: Check out the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame. Visit the West Side Market.<br>  <br>  - Indianapolis, IN: Wonderful, free art museum. Has a lot of very known artist's work there and amazing since it is free. There is a state park there (Fort Harrison) used to have prison of war camp. Nice nature center and trails.<br>  <br>  - Northwest Indiana: Indiana Dunes State Park. I hear you can see the Chicago skyline from there which would be nice. Some casinos in the area.<br>  <br>  - Columbus, Ohio: The Wilds Tiger sanctuary, nice (I hear) museum of science and industry

In addition to that, Mission Bay is basically one big tourist trap. <br>  If you want cheap and good food, you need to go inland and get away from Mission Bay.<br>  <br>  Us locals would say - do not eat or shop in Mission Bay or Mission Beach. Use mapquest to find the intersection of Balboa Ave and Genessee Dr. There's tons of stores and restaurants in this area. It's about 10 minutes from Mission Bay and half the price.<br>  <br>  Something to keep in mind- both Clairemont Mesa Blvd and Balboa Ave are huge commerial streets. You can find anything you want on these two streets. Go here to do your eating and shopping instead of Mission.
5b81d6b881aa08e55896386627160825aa	Looks like there's one at 1250 22nd Street NW and one near the Convention Center at 900 10th Street NW.  Both are pretty close to downtown and the tourist sites, but if you want to walk around in the evenings, you'd be much better off at the one near 22nd St.  You can walk to Georgetown and Dupont Circle, both of which are nice neighborhoods for dinner and evening strolls.  The area near the Convention Center isn't that great, especially for kids.|`|Ib5XecOiaa	I never stay in the city but opt to stay at the Embassy Suites in Vienna, VA.  Just blocks from the Tyson's Corner mall.  The hotel offers a convenient shuttle to and from the metro every 20 minutes.  They also offer a shuttle to the mall and back on the same schedule.  I buy the all day metro pass which is $8 each and we travel around wherever we want.  The ride into the city is only about 30 minutes, if that!  Your are able to take the red line right into the Smithsonian Mall.  We visit the sights during the day then come back and get freshened up and head to the mall for dinner at one of the many restaurants or we grab a bite at the food court.  They also have a great movie theatre at Tyson's  if you wish to catch a movie.  Have fun and enjoy.  P.S. the hotel also has a great pool!
gm9QYLjIaa	Like in most countries of the world, the age of consent is 18, meaning it is technically illegal for someone older than 18 to have sex with a minor. But no one needs to know what's going on in your bedroom, so this is only taking into account if the girl (or boy) or her (his) family presses charges against the adult, then it counts as rape (even if it was consentual). Like I said, this is the case in almost all countries of the world, the age of consent though may wary, being as low as 13 in some countries (Burkino Faso I think). <br>  <br>  It depends on your meaning of "the old ways". The South-East of Turkey is known for being "overly traditional" and "fundamentalists" (islamists). And yes arranged marriages are quite common, unfortunately, so are honor killings due to the close-mindedness of the families. Sunni Kurdish and Turkish families in the South-East are religious and, honestly, scary. I wouldn't want to judge anyone's lifestyle but when innocent young girls are killed for allegedly destroying the families' honor and married off to older men, or boys they have never seen in their lives without being able to say anything are more than enough reasons to get me angry. The average age to marry off girls is estimated to be around 15 (from the book "Honor Killings" by Ayse Onal) and the boy usually a few years older than her, it depends though, the age isn't that important since it's also very common to marry girls off to younger boys. The thing is that the law prohibits anyone younger than 18 to wed, but they are authorized to get married at 17 with permission from the family, but it's completely illegal if one of party is younger than that. The law used to be 15 years old for girls and 17 for boys but it was changed in the early nineties to keep families from easily marrying off their teenage daughters. Most families' solution is to have a religious marriage ceremony (imam nikahi) performed by an imam at a mosque and wait until they turn 17 to legalize it. Of course the state does not recognize such ceremonies so they have no saying in it. The situation in South-Eastern Turkey (and neighborhoods in Istanbul with immigrants from that region) is not only miserable economically or politically (the war between Turkish army and the PKK notably) but socially.<br>  <br>  Sometimes the world is such an ugly place.|`|x79VCZsNaa	Well ? am living in East Turkey and i can asure you that this part of Turkey is not living like in old days, there are some regions like hakkari or Mu? or another in south east that have old traditions because people there (majority kurdish) are under PKK ideologies and this party in order to keep power what try to do is stop the progress that goverments have tried to do in that areas.. Actually Diarbak?r is as modern as Istambul, not all cities in East are under this conditions, unafortunatly alot of people living in Istambull think that Turkey finish where the road to Ankara begin in fact there are alot of people in Istambul that under that believe never try to come to East and see this regions.. sad but true...If someday you have opportunity to come to Turkey i recommend you to give a tour all around the country do not go just to the turistic places you will be amazing of how rich and nice is this county and that go foward than istambul and all mediterranean areas...|`|wVJ1jAyJaa	Yes, it is illegal in Turkey. It is a crime.<br>  If some of the girls or her relatives file a complaint, he will probably be convicted.<br>  Underage marriage is also illegal in Turkey, like in many countries.<br>  The young marriages in East of Turkey he's talking about are not real, official marriages.

I live in the Chicago suburbs and frequently fly out of Midway.  It's easy to get to and from the airport, as well as easy to navigate once inside.

AA10988215	I travelled to New Orleans from Scotland last summer and I loved it.  Yes there is still a lot of damage from Katrina (something that us Scots just dont appreciate the magnitude of) but it's still a fantastic place with so much to do.<br>  <br>  We stayed for just under a week which was no way long enough!  Here are the things we did plus some things I would like to do when I next go back:<br>  Mardi Gras World on Algiers (a free ferry takes you across the Mississippi)<br>  The Insectarium (think it just opened last year)<br>  The Aquarium and IMAX theatre<br>  A French Quarter tour on a mule and carriage<br>  An airboat ride on the swamps-it was FANTASTIC!!!!<br>  A visit to plantation houses-we went to Laura and Oak Alley, a little bit outside New Orleans but still worth it<br>  A city tour, we went to The Superdome, City Park, an overgorund cemetery plus the lower ninth ward which was devastated by the levee breaks (yes, the tour guides are making money off the tragedy but we wanted to see it just to understand how awful it was, and to see the rebuild efforts)<br>  Party on Bourbon Street!!! <br>  Harrah's Casino (you'll need ID-both me and my boyfriend were ID'd, I'm 23 and he was 29!)<br>  Also, just riding the Street car can be a tour on it's own.  I think the St Charles line goes up to the Garden District by Loyola and Tulane Universities, it's really nice, and cheap! :-)<br>  <br>  There are also many museums such as the WWII museum, the pharmacy museum and the voodoo museum.  There is also the New Orleans Museum of Art within City Park, Natchez Steamboat cruises and the Audubon Zoo-we didn't get a chance to visit them but would love to next time.<br>  <br>  There really is so much to do-it's a very eclectic place and I really hope you have a good time there.  I certainly did and I really look forward to going back some time.<br>  <br>  Hope this is useful and don't be put off by those who say the city is desolate and ugly after Katrina-New Orleans is on the way back!|`|ILUYVQ0naa	Well if your into the whole tourist thing the Quarter has a lot of tours and the surrounding area has swamp tours. Magazine street has fun shopping.  The French Market, Cafe du Mond, Audubon Zoo, Bourbon street. Try some of the local places to eat, like Mothers. Go to Pat O'Brien for a fun night, sit in the room with the pianos, that's the most fun. Walk on the Riverwalk by the aquarium. If you like to gamble, Harrahs Casino is fun. Sure Katrina messed some stuff up but there is still a lot to do.|`|68d5b7f672196c4474ae9e60bdf04328aa	For starters don't listen to people who don't know anything about the city.  I would first go to a travel agent look through all of those pamphlets they give you and you decide what you are interested.  You can do anything from the Zoo to a Swamp tour.  There are all sorts of tours of the city, but I say do your homework before you leave.  The French Quarters should be a focal point, but I would also suggest the  River Boat cruise packages which are full of history.|`|jBdJ8L0saa	Hmmm Katrina did put a damper on things but there are still other sites to see.

vmfuPxv4aa	Dimmeys store is in Richmond.  What I suggest is you go from the airport to Essendon Airport, where they have several DFO stores, then to the city, where there are more DFO's at Southern Cross station, then catch a train to Richmond station, and you will see the Dimmy's clock from there, or ask the station staff, if you can find any, it's only a short walk from the station.  There are also several clothing stores in the same shopping area as Dimmys. You could also get to Southern Cross by the Airport bus.  Can't really help with the playboy stuff though.

But, lets say, if you are flying from LA to Mexico City, and then have a connection from Mexico City to Tegucigalpa.  Then, you would have to re-check bags, re do security, and clear customs both times since it was an international flight.|`|D8KgIX8naa	Depends on where you are leaving from and where your connection is.|`|AA12218857	You don't have to recheck your bags however when I got a connecting flight with American Airlines at JFK in New York, they made me go through security again.|`|4gve3I6Xaa	No, you won't have to go through security again...especially if it's the same airline since it will probably be in the same terminal.  Sometimes if you fly though Miami, you have to go out and come back in, but I think that's just because they've been adding on to the airport.  But in most airports, all the terminals are connected.

AA10249078	Is it a true desert island, meaning no fresh water and no trees? In that case you need to bring food, water and shelter...or hope you get rescued real quick.<br>  <br>  The thing with being "stranded" it implies that this is an unexpected situation and totally unplanned. Therefore, chances are you won't have what you need.<br>  <br>  However, if you know you are heading into an area where it is possible that you could be stranded, you would want to bring:<br>  <br>  Water or some way of collecting water, such as a tarp, plastic sheeting. <br>  Water filter/water purification tablets<br>  Fire starting equipment (flint/steel or waterproof matches)<br>  A couple of tarps<br>  Toilet paper<br>  First aid kit<br>  Fishing equipment<br>  Knife<br>  Machete<br>  Extra clothing<br>  Freeze dried food<br>  Multi-function knife<br>  Signal mirror<br>  A cooking kettle<br>  A full-color guide to the local flora<br>  <br>  If there is no source of fresh water you can use the tarp or plastic to collect rain, dew or even distill water from the sun.  Dig a pit in the sand by the beach. Place the kettle in the center in the bottom of the pit. Place the tarp over the hole and anchor on the edges. Then place a small rock or shell in the center of the tarp so that the tarp sags in the middle (over the kettle). Then wait.  In 8 - 24 hours you should collect enough water from evaporation in the kettle that it will keep you from dying of dehydration.<br>  <br>  Look for fruit and nut trees, edible grasses, etc.<br>  <br>  Build a shelter out of the wind.|`|3AlFMrA5aa	hey, i answered ur "Kill myself" question and i was reported. i just like to say im sorry if i affended u n anyway. i was just trying to help.

Ry8oAQ7Laa	having a ticket is like having a contract, you booked your ticket round trip, so you can't just cancel the one portion just because you feel like it.  Two things can happen, if you don't take the outbound flight, the reservation cancels your return automatically because they're assuming you're not flying at all.  If you only want to do the return, they actually have to reprice your ticket for a one way only, and it can be either less or more depending on the rules of your ticket.<br>  <br>  You can call and ask them to reprice it to see how much it'll be, but you will most likely end up paying.|`|u4LLFhORaa	you have to cancel the whole ticket and start over|`|Mxr6AIkiaa	They'll cancel the whole thing.|`|PA0bGBtCaa	They will cancel the whole thing. The only way to do this is to pay a cancel fee for the first part and have the travel credit. If you decide not to call them and just not show up, then your reservation will automatically be deleted by Sabre, the reservation system US Airways uses. Unfortunately that is your only option at this point.
4gve3I6Xaa	Well, it is expensive, but wherever you're looking should tell you if the price is in US dollars.  The ticket along in coach can cost you up to around $2000 p/p...so, it's not a cheap place to go.|`|D9x1QSgiaa	I have travelled there four times now. Every time I go there I have a great time. The people always treated me nice. I am pretty sure if you shop around you can still find a roundtrip flight for around $1,500. US dollars. I always flew there on Korean Airlines (KAL) or Northwest. There are some bargains to be had, now that gas prices are down.<br>  <br>  The Philippine Peso rate has fallen slightly. You'll get about 46 or 47 PHP (Philippine Peso) per US dollar. Many places are happy to accept US dollars as well. I suggest you buy a LOT of Travellers Checks before going. They are accepted everywhere. I always get American Express. <br>  Last time I was there was 10 years ago. I had no difficulty finding cheap hotels for about $25-30 per night. (you get A.C., great TV and use of the pool). I see NO NEED what so ever to "book" a hotel. You probably won't have any difficulty finding vacancies anywhere. You can find cheaper ones if you don't mind not having Air Conditioning or TV. The food there was always great. I never got sick...but I don't suggest you drink the water. Always buy bottled water or soda instead. I suggest that you NOT stay in Manila, but travel to some out-lying regions...such as Baguio, Borocay Island, Cebu or Iloilo City for example. Manila is a terrible place to have to stay for any extended length of time. I also suggest you plan to stay longer than 1 week.|`|yh2hr3Vfaa	The exchange rate is 47 Philippine Pesos to one $ today.<br>  The most expensive and time consuming part is getting here.<br>  The Philippines is a great place to vacation/retire. <br>  I would spend more than a week after traveling 24 hours to get here and spending $1,200 for a ticket.<br>  Things are unbelieveably cheap evan in Boracay.<br>  I would not book a hotel on the internet. The hotels charge a higher rate and there are plenty to choose from.|`|tcmaLqWFaa	The current exchange rate of USD to PHP (Philippine Piso) is about 47 to $1.  I have also noticed that airlines are gouging customers much like the gasoline stations do.  That, in spite of the decline in fuel costs worldwide.  There must be a thousand other places you could go for a one week vacation.  Considering that travel from USA takes about 24 hours each way, depending on your connecting flights. The cost of travel alone will also eat up more money than you could spend in the remaining 5 days of your vacation.  FYI, what you see on the internet is nothing like the real Philippines and travel arrangements, especially hotels, is the biggest rip off scam known to mankind.  For what those "internet" hotels charge, you can stay at my house.  But, I really don't recommend you come here for just a week.|`|rVUvopaLaa	it means the hotel is charging extra fees or their commission for the currency conversion.  you will notice this when you get to the Phils the hotel buying rates for foreign currency is quite low as compared to the malls.  as a result it doesn't much up the publish room rates when you pay it. you can tell the actual bill is rather deceiving.  <br>  <br>  publish rates may not include taxes also.<br>  <br>  my advise is if you have friends in the Phils who can make booking for you it's probably the best way to get better deals in your hotel.  <br>  <br>  in the Phils they have different rates as follows<br>  local tourist<br>  corporate rates <br>  government corporation accounts<br>  and in your case foreign tourist<br>  <br>  among those categories they charge more for foreign tourist <br>  <br>  good luck!|`|46708506191773125e3949d745db17b7aa	one dollar ends up about 47 pesos. so the price you are looking at can probably be divided by 47 to get actual dollars. you will find most things to be pretty cheap. have you been there before? are you just going by yourself, or do you have people who know their way around? i was in manila and davao with my wife who is from there, for two weeks. i would not advise you going there by yourself. you really need someone who knows their way around. some areas are not all that safe, and it is easy to be taken advantage of. but if you know the area, then it can be fun. you said u.s. dollars, if you are going from the u.s., you will see some things that will be quite surprising to you. a flight from the u.s. should be around $1200-$1500.|`|ArQDDop4aa	if you're a dollar earner, think of dollars only when planning your trip. book your flight and pay with credit card. same with hotel accommodations. start thinking about converting to pesos when you're already in the philippines. but trust me, for a dollar earner everything is cheap in the philippines.  your dollar is worth almost 50 pesos there so even if price tag is 2000 pesos that's only 40 bucks!!|`|0VHlnNpiaa	Flights,higher end hotels and things associated with that cost abit but once your there food,entertainment,shopping and all that junk are considerably cheaper and the quality and range is just amazing.

What would YOU do if  ANY nation fired rockets into YOUR country---and would not stop--despite warnings that you would not tolerate it any longer.<br>  <br>  Israel made two serious mistakes.  They tolerated for far too long the murdering terrorist thugs in Gaza who thought nothing of killing innocent Jews and who repeatedly fired rockets into Israel.  They should have blown them off the face of the map.  Secondly, they quit before bringing these pieces of trash to their knees.  Israel should have stopped at nothing to put an end to attacks on its people, even if that meant reducing Gaza to a parking lot.<br>  <br>  I'm terribly sorry for the innocent civilians who were caught in the fray, and I absolutely deplore the scum among the Palestinians who caused this by provoking Israel like they did.  THEY should be tried for war crimes--not Israel for simply defending itself.|`|iCMrsV9daa	I think its a joke what Israel is getting away with.

In any event world opinion has already reached that conclusion. That these massive air-strikes could occur with impunity does highlight the urgency of developing the Palestinian Territories into a de jure state so that they may be legally provided with an adequate air defense system; we don't wish to see them return out of desperation to suicide bombings as a retaliatory measure. But nor do we wish to see them left vulnerable to hostile military action,and  they desperately need an anti-aircraft system to secure their airspace and that involves legal premises that only apply to recognized states. The same would apply to lifting the naval blockade; until the State of Palestine is formed,they cannot declare the right to maintain the inviolability of their territorial waters; in fact,they have no claim to territorial waters until they achieve statehood. So this must become a priority for the new U.S. administration and I think it is. Only the U.S. can force the zionists out of  the Palestinian Territories.|`|uyfFGeMsaa	Initial reports on the shelling of the al-Fakhura UNRWA school said that Israel fired into the school, killing 42, mostly civilians.

jn9iYEkAaa	The Holiday Inn Express in Christiansburg?, VA is your average hotel. Decent sized rooms, clean, and it's right off I-81.|`|lo3T01BOaa	For your first night, I would suggest Wytheville, VA. It's right on I-81. I stayed there a few years ago and it's fine for a one night stop. We stayed at the Quality Inn & Suites. It was ok for one night, but the staff were rude and the rooms were really in need of a renovation. Trip Advisor ranks Comfort Suites Wytheville as the best hotel there, and you can get deals for under $100, so you might want to try that place.<br>  <a href="http://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotels-g58337-Wytheville_Virginia-Hotels.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotels-g58337...</a><br>  <br>  For your second night, I would recommend a hotel just outside of Memphis, TN. It takes just over 8 hours to get from Wytheville to Memphis. Just outside of Memphis in the suburbs , take I-40 exit 18 or I-40 exit 16 B. There's lot's of hotels off those exits and it's in a nice area, lot's of restaurants and stores in the area. Make sure you book the hotel before you go so you know where it as, as it's very suburban (no tall signs for the hotels) so you need to know where you're going.. Memphis to Dallas is just over 6 hours. If you would rather go further than that, there's places in Little Rock, AR.
QxIhMHwAaa	If you've not printed out your ticket online, then you go to the front desk of your airline provider. Tell them your name and your flight, and give them your ID. They'll ask you a few questions and give you your ticket which have your gate number printed on it. (If you can print your ticket online, you go right to the security line.) You then go through security. Afterwards, I generally check the departure flight board to check that the gate number for my flight is the same one printed on my ticket. I then go to my gate and wait for my flight. Very simple. Good luck!|`|qdsVS1dDaa	Are you REALLY going to a foreign country with only carry-on luggage? Maybe you are the girl of my dreams. Too late, I am already married, and happily, too.<br>  <br>  But, when you get to the airport, you will need to get checked in and see where your aircraft is. Proceed to security and clear through there, and go to the correct terminal or concourse to where your flight's gate is, and settle down to wait there for boarding. When your area or row is called for boarding, go through the access, showing your boarding pass to the agent there, and go down the jetbridge onto the aircraft. When on the aircraft find your seat. Numbered from front to back, seats in alpha order from your right to left. <br>  <br>  I take a book along to read. Preferably an old friend that I enjoy, as it is easier to follow through distractions, and I get distracted a lot.<br>  <br>  Have a pleasant flight.<br>  <br>  Regards,<br>  Dan|`|AA12218857	Ok<br>  First thing - check what zone you have to check in at - this will be displayed on screens near the front entrance. There will be a lot of people looking at them, so be prepared for a crowd. Also, ensure that you have your flight number so that you can see exactly where your flight's check-in is: you don't want to end up at the wrong desk!<br>  <br>  So, once you know where to go, go there. Have your passport and booking confirmation with you at the desk. The person at the desk will ask you if you're carrying drugs/weapons etc (for god's sake don't carry them!) and they will then give you your boarding card. Now you can progress to security.<br>  <br>  At security, they will want to see your boarding card and passport, so have them at hand. You will most likely have to put your hand luggage, shoes, jacket, and anything metallic (money, phone etc) through the X-ray machine. Don't bother carrying any liquids with you (drinks, cosmetics etc) because it causes a lot of hassle - buy the cosmetics at the airport and buy some water at the airport too.<br>  <br>  Before I forget, yes, hand luggage does cut out hassle, but you can only carry certain amounts of make-up and liquids with you. This is a real pain, so I would either:<br>  *buy them when you get to the duty free<br>  *not bother<br>  *or check in the bag<br>  <br>  Anyway. You're now through security. This means that you're in the duty free. Here there will be book shops, restaurants, whatever. Seeing as you're alone, don't get carried away in the shops. Buy a packet of sweets (candy) if you want and a magazine - don't be tempted to go and look at bags because if you do something like that, time will disappear and you'll be running to the gate like a mad woman before you know where you are!<br>  <br>  In the waiting area, there will be screens - take a look at them to see where your flight is. If it's quite low down the screen, that most likely means that you won't board for a little while, so take a seat near the screens and check them every 5 minutes or so.<br>  <br>  When the screen changes, your flight will say 'Go to Gate __' first off - follow the signs to your gate number/letter. If you fail to see this, it will then say 'Boarding Gate __' - this means 'run if you want a good seat'. You may then hear over a tannoy system that your flight is boarding. If you fail to miss all of this, the 'Boarding Gate __' will turn red, or maybe flash. This will then change to 'Final Call' - this means RUN, but you hopefully will be on the plane by the time this is appearing. Gates can be up to a 30 minute walk from the duty free area, so I suggest that you leave as soon as it tells you the gate to go to, just so you have a lot of time to spare - running in an airport is the worst!<br>  <br>  When you get to the gate, have your passport and boarding pass available for the people to see. You may take a seat (if told to by the staff) or you may be able to board straight away.<br>  <br>  Have fun in Sweden! And remember about the liquids - have a think about what to bring and what to leave. Deoderants and basic cosmetics are usually available at the airports anyway!<br>  <br>  Edit: I'm in the UK by the way, just in case you're in America - some of what I've written may be different for you, but it's pretty much all the same world wide really.

Yb6dvevIaa	Sure. Before you go, you should learn some words that you should be able to say in Korea. Your cousin could probably teach you or you can learn by yourself. It may take a while but it would be fun to experience other schools in other countries. I'm sure this wouldn't be a waste of time, unless you like to give up easily. Its your decision.|`|wJ1eoeALaa	fun. and you only go to school on saturday's twice a month. <br>  <br>  But, since you can't even speak korean..... don't go. It's a waste of time and you probably won't even be accpeted <br>  MOst of you guys don't even know that much about Korean schools and stuff i do becasue I go to school in Korea. <br>  You won't be accepted since it is summer as well, and another reason they won't accept you, you are only going 3 weeks and it is vacation.|`|2b97e016ad66437b36147f9acd28a75baa	I'm guessing you're Indonesian.<br>  <br>  Expect some discrimination/racism, it's a homogeneous nation.<br>  I'm Korean myself and I don't like the situation, either.<br>  <br>  Korean schools aren't.. fun.<br>  <br>  - bullies<br>  <br>  - the concept of upper-classmen being superior to lower-classmen is there... (to a point where lower-classmen oftentimes have to use honorifics when speaking to upper-classmen.. wtf?)<br>  <br>  - s*itload of work (assignments, exams, exams, cramming, etc.)<br>  <br>  - uniform required in most schools<br>  <br>  - you can't have your hair too long. it has to be neat and to a certain length<br>  <br>  - teachers sometimes grade unfairly. they buy into better-off parents' bribes<br>  <br>  - schools are often segregated by gender - most middle & high schools are like this. you won't like this and most ppl don't like it, either.. unless you're gay/lesbian who's into korean guys/girls, of course. (NOT saying gays/lesbians are bad.)<br>  <br>  - food.. sucks! unless you're already used to korean food or like korean food.<br>  <br>  - korean culture is so much more.. group-oriented than individualistic Western cultures... there's a strong sense of togetherness in the culture in general and this goes same with schools<br>  <br>  - sometimes you have to stay at school until 9 PM or later to.. study.<br>  <br>  - btw, you have schools on Saturdays, which I personally think it's effing ridiculous.|`|u1oDCaRBaa	I think you should be able to go if you just talk to the administrators and stuff, since my friend went to a school in Japan for only about a month or so, and I think your case would be similar. You'll probably have to study a lot though, since my parents said that they went to school from 8a.m-10p.m. Even if you don't know a lot of Korean, try to have your cousin help you out, and you'll probably learn a lot of Korean, since the high schoolers' vocabulary is sorta...advanced I guess.|`|XoxWrE2uaa	One of my best friends is currently staying over here for her high school years because the schools in Korea were terrible. She was S. Korea, and told us how school was monday-saturday and the hours were super long.<br>  And on top of that if you do not even know the language I would not even bother. Again with my friend, she was saying how someone was trying to learn the language and was having difficulties because the alphabet is nothing like ours.<br>  So I would not go.|`|Vlpm2JKWaa	you're call ahmad?<br>  then you're probably malay/indonesian..<br>  i dont think should go if you cant speak native cos you cant even survive alone peaking basic stuff..|`|AA12267979	i believe you have to go to school on Saturday so enjoy :D<br>  if you like korean food... it taste better in the motherland >.>

ac7e0f50f58632b431b5cf5de0564ffbaa	There are literally hundreds of things to do here in LA. Here is my list of “must sees”. Visit as many as you have time for.:<br>  <br>  Disneyland: The Happiest Place on Earth. Half a billion visitors can’t be wrong. #1 Destination in SoCal.<br>  Universal Studios: A theme park that grew out of a studio tour. #2 Destination<br>  Even if you don’t visit Disneyland or Universal Studios Tour, Downtown Disney District and Universal City Walk are very fun places to visit for shopping and eating. And they’re free to visit. <br>  <br>  Hollywood: Enjoy the Walk of Fame, Entertainment Museum, Chinese Theater and more. You can see a lot for free. The Hollywood & Highland complex is AMAZING. It has lots of shops and restaurants, and the Kodak Theater (home of the Academy Awards). I also like the El Capitan theater, right across the street. And the Hollywood Bowl is a GREAT place to listen to concerts outdoors. <br>  <br>  Rodeo Drive, 90210: Packed with exclusive shops, full of gawkers. They all came to enjoy the excess. Free, unless you intend to buy something.<br>  <br>  Venice Beach: Los Angeles kitsch and over-the-top culture at its best. Here you'll find Muscle Beach, street performers and tacky shops galore. Fun, VERY interesting, but I avoid it after dark, when it gets a little TOO interesting for my taste. <br>  <br>  Santa Monica Beach and Pier: Great beach scene and a classic seaside amusement park, complete with antique carousel that has been in a lot of TV and movies. <br>  <br>  Santa Monica Third Street Promenade - Downtown Santa Monica's shopping promenade is often the scene of movie star-sightings. <br>  <br>  Sunset Boulevard: Perhaps one of the world's most famous streets, it began as a route between the stars' posh neighborhoods and the Hollywood studios. It runs from downtown to the ocean, passing through the "Sunset Strip" on its way. It makes for a fun drive. When you get to the ocean, stop at Gladstone's for Fish.<br>  <br>  Queen Mary: Once the largest ship afloat, she's been docked in Long Beach for longer than she sailed, and her elegance never fails to impress. Free to visit. You can actually stay on board, for a price.<br>  <br>  Farmers Market and The Grove - A new shopping complex right next to a Los Angeles landmark, The Grove and Farmers Market coexist. Enjoy a movie or shopping, and then take the trolley to the Farmers Market for lunch or dinner. It is right next to CBS, so walk across the lot to see if they are taping "The Price is Right". You might even get in.<br>  <br>  TAAB: The Americana at Brand- The newly opened TAAB, developed by the same group that gave us The Grove, breathes new life into Glendale, and gives all those hip people in Eagle Rock and the eastern half of LA a great place to go. <br>  <br>  Griffith Park - Home of the Los Angeles Zoo, Griffith Park Observatory, Travel Town, the Greek Theatre, and Gene Autry Museum of Western Heritage.<br>  <br>  Getty Museum - The Getty's architecture is so beautiful that it keeps me fascinated. No matter whether you like their art or architecture better (or maybe you'll just enjoy the view), the Getty is sure to please. Free.<br>  <br>  Attend a TV taping - You can get free tickets at audiencesunlimited.com, tvtix.com, or see the booth at Universal City walk. It's very interesting to see a show being taped. The most popular, by far, is the Tonight show with Jay Leno. Check the NBC web site for all the details there.<br>  <br>  Places to eat:<br>  In-N-Out Burger: Multiple locations, best burger in LA, ask anyone.<br>  Pink’s Hot Dogs: 709 N. La Brea, just north of Melrose. You might even see a celebrity. Maybe.<br>  Tommy’s Chili Burgers: Look for the shack, an LA tradition. The original location is at Beverly & Rampart, a couple miles west of downtown.<br>  Canter’s Deli: 419 N. Fairfax, between Beverly & Melrose. Near CBS, you might spot a celebrity.<br>  Phillippe’s: 1001 N. Alameda. Great roast beef sandwiches. Near Union Station and Olvera Street. Watch the mustard, it’s hot.<br>  The Pantry: Corner of Figueroa and 9th, downtown. Huge portions, they never close, GREAT steak and eggs.<br>  <br>  Places to Stay:<br>  Since LA is so spread out, there is no single place that is close to EVERYTHING. Most people who come here tend to stay in Hollywood, Santa Monica, or Anaheim.<br>  In Hollywood, I recommend the Renaissance Hotel at Hollywood and Highland, the Best Western Sunset Plaza, or the Holiday Inn Walk of Fame. <br>  In Santa Monica, the Holiday Inn Santa Monica is close to the pier and reasonably priced.<br>  In Anaheim, I recommend the Howard Johnson (HoJo) Anaheim, and the Candy Cane Inn.<br>  <br>  Places to Shop:<br>  Third Street Promenade, Santa Monica<br>  The Grove, Los Angeles<br>  Americana @ Brand, Glendale<br>  Beverly Center, Los Angeles<br>  Citadel Outlets, Commerce<br>  Brea Mall, Brea<br>  The Block at Orange, Orange<br>  South Coast Plaza, Costa Mesa<br>  Fashion Island, Newport Beach<br>  Santee Alley, Los Angeles|`|dhdz5uNSaa	UNIVERSAL STUDIOS!!!|`|6W2imvnaaa	yeah i live in hollywood, what is your point?|`|tQM0ufHoaa	Ditto, whats up?|`|5d95ebb15bb0cd41de0cb8b36d7eb955aa	Not originally, but I lived there for many years.|`|H9fYGosUaa	yeah i live in the hills of beverly hills by the p.b mansion|`|m8wMKhOoaa	nope, im farrr away from hollywood|`|BGeULTx0aa	ive been to hollywood ?|`|zWwJR3rFaa	yeah i live here in hollywood, why?|`|7on0Xys7aa	Yeah what do you want...|`|17236f2a8f333b3a2a3252e2a5c82aabaa	Please don't say you "wanna be" an actress. We see about a hundred of those questions a day.  For starters Hollywood is NOTHING like what you see portrayed on the silly "reality" programs. It was once a glamorous city centered on the motion picture industry. <br>  <br>  It still has a few touristy attractions like the "Walk of Fame", the (who ever the current owner is)Chinese Theater, and the Kodak Theater, but since most movie making has moved to other cities, states, and countries Hollywood has declined into just a dirty district of the City of Los Angeles. You won't see celebrities there, but you will see lots of prostitutes, homeless, and panhandlers.|`|3K1QW7Oeaa	Why? What do you want to know?
9VsVJ7djaa	The invention of dicing is attributed to India by some accounts.Some of the earliest archaeological evidence of oblong gambling dice have been found in Harrapan sites such as Kalibangan, Lothal, Ropar and surrounding areas dating back to the third millennium BCE, which were used for gambling.<br>  <br>  The oblong or cubical dice (ak?a) is the precursor of the more primitive vibhī?aka—small, hard nuts drawn randomly to obtain factors of a certain integer.Early references to the dicing can be found in the ?g Veda (c. early 2nd millennium BCE) as well as the newer Atharva Veda (c. late 2nd millennium ~ early 1st millennium BCE). It is also mentioned in the great Hindu epic, the Mahabharata, where Yudhisthira plays a game of dice against the Kauravas for the northern kingdom of Hastinapura.<br>  <br>  The use of dice is believed to have later spread to Persia from India, influencing Persian board games. Excavations at the Shahr-i Sokhta (Persian ??? ????? , literally "The Burnt City'") archaeological site in south-eastern Iran yielded one of the oldest known dice which were excavated as part of a 5000-year-old backgammon set, which was probably imported from India.

ZA5QTj3Zaa	We have a lot of similar products and services but every time I cross the border (from Canada), it feels erie.  I feel much better once I am back in Canada, safer.<br>  <br>  Home sweet home.  Canada is not the same as the US.  No way no how.|`|AA12095483	Canada is part of America. So is the USA. If you mean, does Canada feel like the USA the answer is NO. Cultures are very different.|`|Twzg9s0caa	It's similar but better.<br>  We get all there tv shows and music and movies plus our own.<br>  And Canada is cleaner and less violent.<br>  We are lucky people.|`|4gve3I6Xaa	Sorry, but Canada is part of America.  <br>  Canada, Mexico, Panama, Brazil, Chile, Argentina...etc...all part of America...<br>  I suppose you mean, is Canada like the United States of America??<br>  Yeah, it's pretty similar...but it's like when you travel between states of the USA, they all are a little different...different customs, cultures, but nothing really so different.|`|b7jq1tfRaa	I live close to the border and go shopping and ski-ing in America.  The areas that we go to are much like our own city and people in this area cross back and forth regularly.  The best way to describe it is that it is kind of like a distorted mirror your reflection is the same but just a little bit different.  I've found in my travels in both countries the differences become more pronounced the further away from the border.|`|aKqWOEoPaa	As a Canadian living near the U.S. border, I find that we share a lot of similarities but there are some differences. In the U.S. restaurants have larger portions, and there are more buffets etc. I also notice that malls tend to be more of a "destination." Both of our countries are heavy on the consumerism, but there is a different feel to the malls and the people at them.|`|KkVDwPIMaa	Depends on which part of America, and which part of Canada. For the most part, Canada is cleaner, colder, more friendly, and certain places only speak french. Most people here play or at least watch hockey (the NHL was founded by CANADIANS, and over fifty percent of the players now are Canadian, despite what MasterPython said above.) BUt lots of the TV shows are american, and lots of the products. However, I love Canada, and would never move.|`|2WxxStXIaa	According to a Recent popular US article on the L.A. Times.<br>  <br>  A little question of history. Mordecai Richler (a Canadian satirical novelist and satirical children's novelist) once suggested that what defines Canadians is the fact that we're all, quite literally, LOSERS!--and we've never gotten over the fact. Nobody actually actively chose to live here because they really liked the idea. The natives, who were always here, didn't choose to have the European-dominated country of Canada imposed on top of them--but they lost battles, and so became Canadians. Losers. The French in Quebec are Canadians because the British defeated them back in the eighteenth century (and they sure don't like that fact these days). Losers, right? The British-based population of Canada consists of two major groups: United Empire Loyalists, the people in the American colonies who sided with Britain in the war of independence and lost, and so had to flee to Ontario and the Maritimes; and immigrants from England, most obviously people who were doing poorly there, losers at the game of life who decided to set out and try again somewhere else. Losers all again. Throughout this century, people who have immigrated to Canada have tended to be people who have lost elsewhere--lost wars, lost land, etc. Losers yet again. My own ancestors came here because of pogroms in Eastern Europe that destroyed their homes--and would have preferred to go to the US but they couldn't get in, so they settled for Canada, poor losers. We Canadians aren't patriotic because we really only settle for being here, all of us, rather than being delighted by it--and we love to whine about it. Losers for sure, eh?|`|YMTGEz4vaa	Hell no.<br>  <br>  Our cultures are very different, and I know this because my entire extended family lives in Florida and I also travel across the border frequently (I have many friends that are yanks)!<br>  <br>  Imo, we (Canadians) are much friendlier, tolerant, and polite. Plus, you will begin to see the differences in small things, like for example; how many fast food joints there are, also the portions of the meals (they are ridiculously huge in the U.S) and so on! <br>  <br>  It's hard to explain, but our cultures are very different and if you ever travel to both countries, you will notice it!|`|l7VVNBrIaa	As a person of color, and one who's lived in both countries, I can say that the USA is more tolerant than CDN.  Canadians shut out non-whites out of the job market by asking for 'Canadian experience', I could on and on, let's Just say that if you're white, there's not much difference, if you're non-white the differences are startling<br>  <br>  BTW: the cable TV sucks here in CDN
aiKLvwGTaa	Each college has its own union bar. Most of the time, the different colleges don't mix. People of all years mix, including the tutors.<br>  <br>  Oxford is a city, and so has its own night clubs and bars etc. There is also Oxford Brookes university, which has a union.<br>  <br>  Cambridge is a far smaller place, although it's not far from London.<br>  <br>  <br>  And if you are truly interested in attending Oxbridge, you really need to work on your grammar. There's no apostrophe in 'unis', and there should be one is 'there's'. Also, the plural of party is parties.

Check your local phone book to find one near you.|`|AA12095483	She can if you are driving (depending on when you go - border regulations are due to be tightened very soon and everyone will require a passport).

If it's a local chain of stores though, you might not be able to use it so stick to Wal-Mart, Quik Trip, Circle K, etc. If you find, say, a Hen House it might not be accepted although Osco's is ok, because its owned by Albertson's.

WpqwaqcQaa	The system was put in place in 1975 by a Democrat, then Gov. Edwin Edwards. In the 1970s, the South was still largely a Democratic stronghold, and incumbents like Edwards often faced their stiffest challenges in Democratic primaries. So Edwards pushed to do away with the traditional party-primary system. The strategy paid off. In 1975, facing weak opposition, he cruised to re-election.<br>  <br>  The open primary has been criticized for forcing voters go to the polls twice in the space of a month, which tends to depress turnout. Some academics contend that it favors incumbents (who can afford to campaign twice) while others say it aids fringe candidates (who can get just enough votes to force a runoff). In 1991 David Duke used the open primary system to force a runoff with Edwards. Thus originated the famous bumper sticker: "Vote for the Crook: It's Important."<br>  <br>  copied from article written by By Chris Mooney<br>  <br>  Some people voted for Duke when, the national media and other states started saying they wouldn't visit the State or due business with LA if he got elected. People here don't like to be told who to vote for or threatened.<br>  <br>  both Duke & Edwards have been arrested and jailed, something I thought I would never see. La is improving if ever so slowly.<br>  <br>  they had rumors that Bush was going to pardon Edie but it didn't happen.|`|b637df4c5d99edf4bd75147b1fdb49d3aa	David who?

My daughter was immigrating to Canada (an adoption case) and we were going to be living near Toronto however her records show that she "landed" in Vancouver.  We had a 7 hour lay over there, had the time to go through the process and did it.  If we didn't do the process there we would have had to wait in the secure area of the airport till our flight to Toronto and then do the landing there.  <br>  <br>  If you have any questions or concerns talk to the immigration office that issues your visa and they can explain it to you.  They are there to help, not screw you over.

Avoid dressing in clothing that is too revealing or is too tight.  Looser, more modest clothing will be more comfortable and will help you avoid being classified as a "loose woman".   Remember that Thailand is known for prostitution.  You don't want to find yourself in a situation where you are forced into that world.   Be careful about drinking alcohol or accepting drinks from someone you don't know (they may be doctored with a "date rape" drug).  <br>  <br>  Avoid getting yourselves into situations where you are isolated.  Do NOT hitchhike.  A childhood friend of my sisters was traveling overseas and was picked up by someone who ended up killing her.  Have a plan on where you are going and when and stick to it.  Let your parents know your plan and check in with them frequently.  You may also want to travel in a larger group - safety in numbers.<br>  <br>  Do not agree to transport any packages for anyone.  The risk of there being something illegal (drugs) and being imprisoned after getting caught are too great.     <br>  <br>  Good luck and be safe!|`|EVHr4VpCaa	My experience is in Thailand (lived there for 6 years).  The danger is real.  But as suggested by a previous writer, it can be managed.  <br>  <br>  To his list I would add 1) never accept food or drink from anyone.  2) never agree to go anywhere with anyone.  Some people appear so nice, and you probably are turning down some good hospitality, but once you've been tricked, it's hard to escape. <br>  <br>  Consider going with a larger group.  If you insist on traveling as a pair, never get separated.  Trains seem quite safe as they are run by government officials and in some places actually have police on board.  I would probably avoid traveling at night.<br>  <br>  Be aware that there is civil unrest in the four southernmost provinces of Thailand.<br>  <br>  I cannot speak very much about Malaysia.  When I was new in Thailand, I would take an overnight train from Bangkok to Penang to renew my visa.

In addition you have to fill U.S. Customs and Border Protection Declaration Form 6059B.

wbJXqkVGaa	I doubt Americans would like to see elections in Saudi Arabia. The reason is simple: the government that would possibly replace it might not be so friendly to the US and fail to serve US interests.This was the case in Iran when the CIA overthrew the democratically elected government of Mossadegh in Iran (operation Ajax) and brought back the Shah of Iran who at the time was "the policeman of the Gulf." Any change in Saudi would also affect all the other Persian Gulf sheikdoms. You know how much instability that is? And there is nothing worse than instability for the US. At least now you will find all the American fast food chains operating in Saudi & they make money for US businesses. Apart from oil...you are messing with the hegemonic plans of the US;-P<br>  <br>  Edit: Still I assume that works for many-at least for the time being. You know, Iranians are through that. Iran can never really have a king ever again. There is a vibrant democratic movement in Iran. Even now, there are many elements of democracy in Iran. Sometimes change can be peaceful and sometimes bloody. In case of Iran it was bloody. And why do you think the US tries to isolate Iran? It is because they are rebeling aginst the status quo. <br>  <br>  Yet I know there are many educatetd Saudis who might want to see change- but maybe their way. Also if you look at the events after 9/11, American citizens have been stripped off many of their rights. Governments control their nationals- regardless of which country your are talking about. You may not be as free as you think you are- even if you are sitting in Baltimore;-P|`|dp2Rocjraa	jeeeees don't know maybe cuz its a KINGDOM and the people who rule it is the royal family , kinda like the UK ,, dude stop asking stupid questions that you already know there answers .|`|cypZ0ykXaa	K.S.A stands for Kingdom of Saudi Arabia brother. kingdom is alwayz ruled by a king. got??|`|UhnvXXxjaa	i guess you really love Saudi Arabia and the radicals, this is the only thing that can describe your regular participation in this section. go to bed....

Jm3vMKx3aa	1. There is no way to extend a general visitors visa beyond six months. You my only apply for an extension if you have been granted leave to stay for 90 days and want to extend that to 180 days (fee￡395 or ￡595 if applied in person).<br>  <br>  2. Whether you may apply for another visa depends on your personal situation. If you should be at an age which usually requires to work and cannot provide proof of financial means that shows that you are not required to work you may get another visa. If that proof however cannot be provided it will be assumed that your stay in the country will be for another purpose than tourist travel and your second visa application will be most likely rejected.<br>  <br>  <br>  Source(s):<br>  <a href="http://bia.homeoffice.gov.uk/visitingtheuk/visitors/extendingyourstay/" rel="nofollow">http://bia.homeoffice.gov.uk/visitingthe...</a>|`|doizXjdDaa	I believe so, though it might take more than a month for the paperwork to go through to renew the visa. It's possible to renew the visa while you are still there / before the first one expires, so that you don't have to leave and come back again.

We have approximately 20 acres of sunny and shaded areas for our camp situated amid 98 acres of farm land. The camp facilities are approved by the State of Illinois each year."<br>  <br>  There is another called Sun Aura Resort, which appears to be a swingers club, no one under 21 admitted type thing which is in Lake Village, IN  <br>  <br>  Since I'm a pure nudist and a member of the American Association for Nude Recreation (aanr) I can not recommend any club or resort which may include sexual behavior, but in the interest of giving a full answer, I've included their web address. Yuck.<br>  <br>  However, I always recommend aanr approved facilities as they are safe, secure and family oriented.  Go to aanr.com for all information regarding true nude recreation as they are the voice of crediblity for nude recreation.<br>  <br>  Finally, there is a nonlanded club (that means they don't have a physical location and instead meet at other clubs or rent facilities) that is AANR sanctioned and has chapters in several areas of Chicagoland.  It is The Chicago Sun Club and they have nude swims, nude bowling and that type of thing.<br>  <br>  Someone on answers gave me a best answer on a similar query, but said I sounded a little like an annoying commercial for AANR ... sorry if I come across that way, but I truely want people to have a rewarding and safe experiance when they try nude or clothing optional recreation especially if it is a first time event for them.

2wyDALHgaa	Besides having posted this question in the wrong section I would suggest that you suck back and reload a bit.  Educate yourself about what is really going on in Afghanistan and why Canadians are there before you ask questions and conclude that we are "involving ourselves in a war that is not even a direct threat to Canadian national security."  What was going on in Afghanistan WAS and still is a threat to Canadian security.  As was said recently, if it's a threat to the US it's a threat to Canada. <br>  <br>  I've seen the camps there where terrorists were trained and these are the same people who attacked the US and who have threatened Canadians.  In fact, we still have one of our diplomats being held by a faction of these terrorists.  <br>  <br>  Plenty of outstanding work is being done every day in Afghanistan by Canadian troops.  This work is NOT being done for the US it is being done for the people of Afghanistan and for the international community as a whole.  The war in Afghanistan is a whole lot more legitimate then the war in Iraq and to compare the two does a real disservice to those Canadian men and women fighting and working in Afghanistan right now.|`|X2ZsYRNWaa	If Afghanistan was invaded after Iraq there would be a lot fewer non US troops there.

Canada was heavily allied with Britain (I remember pledging allegiance to Queen Elizabeth in elementary school).  So it only follows as natural that Canada help out Britain during WW2.  The USA was still heavily isolationist in 1939 and didn't have any treaties with Britain to obligate it to go to war against Germany in 1939.  As for the US not doing anything, they did lease money, aide and material to Britain without which it might not have survived.

There are one or two old bits to it, like Stony Stratford, but mostly the housing is new.<br>  <br>  Because it was planned, the planners made huge road systems to take you round and through the place - big wide roads, no traffic lights, roundabouts to keep the traffic moving. From the main roads, you can't really see all the housing because of the way it was planned.<br>  <br>  Each of the areas of housing is like a little village (but planned not organic) and there is a dobbing great shopping centre in the middle of it all.<br>  <br>  One reason that Milton Keynes is actually joked about is because it has, to an extent, succeeded as a new town, unlike, for example, Cumbernauld, which is a derelict waste of 1960's housing, pound stores,  and burnt out cars - and is shameful in its poverty. <br>  <br>  This success is probably due to Milton Keynes' proximity to London, its direct and fast train link to London and its location in the more affluent south east...<br>  <br>  Halcon|`|QUTI4UIzaa	its just cos sooooo many people who have came from their have made an icon of themselves and made a fool of themselves but it will all fade away soon as something new will come up...bad luck if it happens there again HA|`|dj1vhT8jaa	there is indoor snowboarding there<br>  a cinema<br>  a huge shopping centre<br>  a huge market<br>  lots of roundabouts<br>  a football team called: mk dons|`|SDz1hjAnaa	because there are thousands roundabout in Milton Keynes.<br>  <a href="http://www.mkcitycabs.co.uk" rel="nofollow">http://www.mkcitycabs.co.uk</a>|`|tYO2Ir1oaa	there's nothing there, it's just roundabouts|`|OqBkdIfFaa	the apartments there are to die for . . .|`|z0TPAhOsaa	-CONCRETE COWS ?<br>  -Theft of Wimbledon F.C. achievements in football by buying a league place ?<br>  -The name sounds crap

They have those everywhere though:)  the only places I really ate while I was done there was there(TR), and then hard rock cafe which was amazing.  I also know they have a rainforest cafe dowtown, and those are always good.  The riverwalk is amazing.  (I didnt believe everyone until I saw it for myself, its like a giant party most nights outside, and its beautiful).  Then hill country on the north side of SA is gorgeous (out past N. 1604), if you just drive around its very sceneic.  There are underground caves under the hill country area.  They have Six Flags fiesta.  There are concerts, mud drags, and fleet markets all the time.  I cant wait to move there.  I am just scared of not being able to meet any1, it will just be me and my boyfriend (both 20 yrs. old)<br>  <br>  Good Luck and God Bless! :)<br>  <br>  Im going to add you since your moving there too :)

But Dublin is the most expensive part of ireland for food, eating out, drinking, and rent (athough rents are dropping still a lot higher than other places) Cos of that the wages are usually slightly higher than other places - but if you were doing a min wage job, it might be a struggle.<br>  Cork is nice, people are friendly, good nightlife and close to some nice scenic places. Galway is by the coast, has an irish feel to it,more so than dublin and lots of areas of interest nearby like the aran islands. Id prob pick Galway if it were me...esp if you liked Killarney. Cork second after that.<br>  But im not sure about office jobs..have a look at jobs.ie or irishjobs.ie. Maybe get in touch with some agencies you find on there and see what the job situation is like, cos as i said the economy has been hit hard with the recession.<br>  You could always try find work in pubs, restaurants, or hotels too...pay might not be great tho, cos we Irish arent good at tipping :)<br>  anyway have fun whatever you decide:)

HQKuzxulaa	You read the verses I'll just answer the question, I' m no interested in the Torah. Only a nazi state would do what Israel has done to the Palestinian people in general and to Gaza in particular.|`|nHuMeLtyaa	No, these verses relate to historical wars and conflicts and can't be used to rationalize todays current events.  They could be used though as a motivational tool if Israel has to ever fight a real army again.|`|Fb519XJgaa	It is God land he gave it and he took back.|`|uyfFGeMsaa	These verses are God's commands to the Jews regarding the conquest of Israel when that is said to have occurred in Biblical times.  The indigenous Canaanites were said to be evil, even sacrificing their own children by fire to their Gods, and on this stated basis the Hebrew God commanded their destruction.<br>  <br>  Of course a critical part of the story is that God revealed himself directly and issued the commandment.  So if you believe the story, then hey, cruel as it sounds, that's what God directly ordered.  If you think the Bible was written by humans with human motives, then it's just a made up story with triumphalist elements that were common in the literature of that era.<br>  <br>  Not even devout believers today claim that God has spoken directly to them, much less given them orders to kill people.  They'd be horrified by the suggestion that these Biblical verses condone anything like that today.  It would be totally forbidden.<br>  <br>  To non-believers, the verses are of course irrelevant.<br>  <br>  In any case, the verses do not inform Israeli policy, and they certainly don't show that Israel has committed any crimes in today's Gaza.<br>  <br>  On a philosophical level, the bit about sacrificing their own children by fire to their Gods strikes an uncomfortably familiar resonance with the modern practice of teaching one's children to strap on suicide vests and then, literally, die by fire.  For the sake of Allah.<br>  <br>  Eerie.|`|Go7M3r8Naa	We didn't commit any crimes. When we arrived in Israel after WWII in buses out people were shot at from the buses. We faced war after war. First the one in 1948 then the six day war. Now this **** in the middle east. <br>  <br>  SO please explain to me how wanting a little place of our own is a crime? Tell me. <br>  <br>  Before we showed up the area that is now Israel didn't exist, parts of it belonged to Syria, Lebanon, Jordan and Egypt. We turned it into a country. Our only crime was not kicking them out when we had the chance.|`|2DHnQZ4xaa	Israel has a right to defend herself.

The rest of us call it defending ourselves after years of cowards throwing bombs and bottles.  They reaped what they sowed, no symapthy here.<br>  <br>  Don't dump on my Torah and I won't dump on your politics.|`|UIJorsD7aa	Every time Israel seeks to defend its civilians against terrorist attacks, it is accused of war crimes by various United Nations agencies, hard left academics and some in the media. It is a totally phony charge concocted as part of Hamas' strategy -- supported by many on the hard left -- to delegitimate and demonize the Jewish state. Israel is the only democracy in the world ever accused of war crimes when it fights a defensive war to protect its civilians. <br>  <br>  This is remarkable, especially in light of the fact that Israel has killed far fewer civilians than any other country in the world that has faced comparable threats. In the most recent war in Gaza fewer than a thousand civilians -- even by Hamas' skewed count -- have been killed. This, despite the fact that no one can now deny that Hamas had employed a deliberate policy of using children, schools, mosques, apartment buildings and other civilian areas as shields from behind which to launch its deadly anti-personnel rockets. The Israeli Air Force has produced unchallengeable video evidence of this Hamas war crime. <br>  <br>  The accusation of war crimes is nothing more than a tactic selectively invoked by Israel's enemies. Those who cry "war crime" against Israel don't generally care about war crimes, as such, indeed they often support them when engaged in by countries they like. What these people care about, and all they seem to care about, is Israel. Whatever Israel does is wrong regardless of the fact that so many other countries do worse. <br>  <br>  If Israel, and Israel alone among democracies fighting defensive wars, were ever to be charged with "war crimes," that would mark the end of international human rights law as a neutral arbitrator of conduct. Any international tribunal that were to charge Israel, having not charged the many nations that have done far worse, will lose any remaining legitimacy among fair-minded people of good will, <br>  <br>  If the laws of war in particular, and international human rights in general, are to endure, they must be applied to nations in order of the seriousness of the violations, not in order of the political unpopularity of the nations. If the law of war were applied in this manner, Israel would be among the last, and certainly not the first, charged.

There is high unemployment in Mexico...even among university educated, English speaking, computer-skilled people.  Jobs pay 1/20th to 1/10th what the same job pays in the U.S.  Foreigners cannot work in Mexico without an FM3 visa with a work permit and the only way to get one is find an employer to hire you and write a letter to Immigration stating he cannot find a citizen for that job.  Then you are tied to that specific job and the employer sponsors your work permit.  They are super-highly unlikely to do this...as there are plenty of qualified Mexicans for every open job.
9QBlKlFmaa	The Palestinians already have a state.<br>  <br>  Jordan is indeed Palestine.  This Arab state already was carved out of 76% of mandatory Palestine.  It was first called Transjordan and now is known as Jordan.  It was given as a gift to Emir Abdullah by the British.<br>  <br>  The so-called "occupied" territories of Gaza and Judea and Samaria, known as the West Bank never belonged to the so-called "Palestinians"; Israel won them in a war of self-defense from Egypt and Jordan respectively. Furthermore both countries relinquished their claims to the territories, so whose territory is Israel occupying? The answer is they are not occupied; they are rightfully part of Israel, as is the Golan Heights which Israel also won from Syria in the same war in self-defense. Yet even Israel itself and its supporters have bought into this false narrative of Israel being an occupier. <br>  <br>  <br>  .|`|i7oHTo9haa	Well he made room remember?  Israel is already like 20% Muslim Arab and like 5% Christian Arab.  There were sooooo many more Christians though the Muslims keep taking territory and cleansing Jewish and Christian people out so they can wage war on Jewish Israel.  <br>  <br>  What's up with this "West Bank" thing like it is going to be a separate state?  That is artificial English name just means west bank of Jordan River.  It was always Judea and Samaria. Judah is our largest tribe! and we have alot of Holy Sites there.  Why there so many Muslims there now nobody said "making room was going to give them their own separate state!" to kick out Christians and Jewish people and wage war on the rest of Israel!!!<br>  <br>  They already got their own state in Jordan now they want more more more?!!! No thank you to Muslims taking over the Holy Land. <br>  <br>  "Palestine and Jordan are one..." said King Abdullah in 1948.<br>  <br>  "The truth is that Jordan is Palestine and Palestine is Jordan," said King Hussein of Jordan, in 1981.<br>  <br>  "Palestine is Jordan and Jordan is Palestine; there is only one land, with one history and one and the same fate," Prince Hassan of the Jordanian National Assembly was quoted as saying on February 2, 1970.<br>  <br>  Accordingly, Abdul Hamid Sharif, Prime Minister of Jordan declared, in 1980, "The Palestinians and Jordanians do not belong to different nationalities. They hold the same Jordanian passports, are Arabs and have the same Jordanian culture."|`|i00SbscLaa	Ben Gurion meant the only solution is one state for both people.

He was a sincere humanitarian and knew that the Arab's life would have been better if they would have stayed and been a part of the new State.<br>  <br>  2.  That he knew that the new State of Israel would be in need of a cheap labor force and that the Arabs could provide such a service.<br>  <br>  3.  That if the Arabs would serve in the IDF (like many of the Bedouins do today), the other Arab nations would not attack Israel so as not to kill their brethren.<br>  <br>  Personally, I think that #2 is the most viable reason.|`|Fb519XJgaa	Palestine is never Jordan or any other country but Palestine.|`|fc7ee39a39d002e8d416468f94168f1faa	His name means son of a lion cub    I speak Hebrew|`|wdyf1sueaa	He actually said<br>  "We do not wish and do not need to expel Arabs and take their place.

I think that in Christian countries, the horror of the Holocaust has greatly dampened the anti-Jewish feeling that admittedly has existed.  But it seems that in some parts of the world, this history has been suppressed.|`|7aoHmM4baa	stupidity indeed|`|8I9uduIiaa	Is it a 'rise' - or just a more open expression of the feeling that was already there...?<br>  <br>  I'm not sure.<br>  <br>  In the UK, there is an unholy alliance between the Left, and many radical Islamic groups. Thus we have witnessed screaming mobs of Brits, marching through several cities, demanding 'death to Israel' and 'death to the Jewish state'. And worse.<br>  <br>  It's also not a coincidence that in countries where there is an increased Muslim population - think France, UK, USA - there is more anti Jewish sentiment being voiced.<br>  <br>  And as for the people that will inevitably now argue that 'I am only anti Israel, not anti Jewish', I would ask you to honestly consider this, from a piece in the Boston Globe:<br>  <br>  Imagine someone vehemently asserting that Ireland has no right to exist, that Irish nationalism is racism, and that those who murder Irishmen are actually victims deserving the world’s sympathy. Who would take his fulminations for anything but anti-Irish bigotry? Or believe him if he said that he harbors no prejudice against the Irish?<br>  <br>  By the same token, those who demonize and delegitimize Israel, who say the world would be better off without it, who hold it to standards of perfection no other country is held to, who extol or commiserate with its mortal enemies, who liken it to Nazi Germany and apartheid South Africa, who make it the scapegoat not only for crimes it hasn’t committed, but for those of which it is a victim - yes, such people are anti-Semitic, whether they acknowledge it or not.<br>  <br>  Criticize Israel? Certainly. But those who so loudly denounce Israel in its war against Hamas are siding with some of the most virulent Jew-haters on earth. They may tell themselves that that doesn’t make them anti-Semites. But it does. “When people criticize Zionists,” Martin Luther King said in 1968, “they mean Jews. You are talking anti-Semitism.”<br>  <br>  - this excellent bit of writing is from a piece by Jeff Jacoby, in the Boston Globe.|`|DTog0VZWaa	Well these answers certainly show a rise.  Even Jews mistakenly blame Jews.<br>  <br>  Manoff helped raise anti-semitism?  NO!!!  Anti-semitism allowed Jews to be blamed for a single persons behavior.<br>  <br>  Israel's actions raised anti-semitism?  NO!!!  Compare her actions to any other countries & it's evident anti-semitism is WHY they're criticised.<br>  <br>  And saying she watonly killed children is ignoring all evidence to the contrary - the she watonly warned Arabs of every action when possible, that Hamas used young children as runner in war zone & older kids in their military, & in general anti-semitism had an inflated totally outside of truth set of numbers for civilian victim counts.<br>  <br>  The business about Jews not allowing criticism & calling everything anti-semitism IS anti-semitism.  It's the form of it where Jews are accused falsely of being wrong for defending themselves.  It's most a common form along with the other called turnspeak.<br>  <br>  ===<br>  My impression is that the reduction in anti-semitism in the last 20-30 years was an illusion.  Because we (including Jews as activitiest) made a REAL dent into anti-black bigotry, we assumed the reduction in anti-semitism that road it's coat tails was as real.  <br>  <br>  Anti-black bigotry had several different elements, making that reduction lasting:<br>  <br>  - It had visible laws that when changed, forced the cultural change.  Jim Crow, Apartheid.<br>  <br>  - It was US based in society.  (In Europe it's based in treatment of colonies like Africa, less than within their own cities.)   Anti-Semitism was always Europe based & then moved into the Middle East.  So the reduction of A-Semitism in the US that road the coat tails of anti-color bigotry, had much less impact in the -world- than we anticipated.  This can't be underestimated.<br>  <br>  - A lot more work has gone into the follow up of anti-black bigotry (often by Jews) than to anti-semitism bigotry.  Studies were done to counter & public efforts were done to argue against common anti-black stereotypes...that blacks are more violent was shown to be a bigoted image & even their excess representation in prision was shown as the result of bigotry, rather than reinforcing of the bigoted image.<br>  <br>  So there has been a real shift in anti-black bigotry even though there is SO much more work to be done.  There was much less of a real shift in anti-semitism in the places where it mattered.<br>  <br>  =====<br>  <br>  Why less work on anti-jews bigotry?  Maybe in part Jews can blame themselves.  Maybe we aren't doing enough to recognize how easy it is to absorb the hateful images (such as about Israeli politics) ourselves.  Or maybe it's been that hard to face the hate.  For 20-30 years we did more resting on our lorals & fooled ourselves.  We should have been working harder, but it was easier to hopefully believe all was better.<br>  <br>  The very scary thing is how rapidly anti-semitism raises to a peek & becomes incredibly dangerous.  We've got a very hard battle ahead of us.  I hope others, non-Jews, join us & champion us.  Blacks couldn't & still can't make the shifts without the support of others.  We need others too.  <br>  <br>  Our doing "well" for ourselves tends to fool everyone into thinking we don't need outside support.  I do believe, this isn't going to change, until outside support helps us champion for ourselves.  It's too hard to do it from the inside by ourselves.  While individuals help, there needs to be a massive movement to shift anti-semitism the same way, there was with anti-color hate.  There was some from the Christian community reaching out to Jews in the last 20-30 years to understand each other.  Now we need something different.  We need to beast looked in the eye.  I think the best group we can depend on outside ourselves is the friends we've made in the Christian world.  However, it can no longer be about "understanding each other's religions."  It now has to be about changing the hate images world wide.  It's a different type of battle & topic & needs to be about anti-semitism itself.|`|iCMrsV9daa	NOT EVERYONE WHO DOSNT AGREE WITH THE ZIONISTS VIEW IS ANTISEMITIC.|`|lCW3Worpaa	'Anti-semitism' isn't some mysterious paranormal phenomenon.

mVUpt8waaa	Nike shoes.  Easy.  Nike factory outlet, Smith Street Collingwood.  <br>  If you dont have time to travel out there, then Rebel Sports on Bourke street.  There is also Priceline next to it (see below).<br>  <br>  MAC.  Myer, David Jones or Priceline.  There are also specialty MAC stores but they might be expensive.<br>  <br>  The other stuff,  I would recommend going to DFO on Spencer Street.  It is at Southern Cross train station.<br>  <br>  Dimmeys.  Closest one is in richmond.  About 15 minutes on the tram from the city.|`|JDRpNw20aa	if you're looking for all this cheap guess and nike stuff, its unlikely you'll find them at the price you're expectng. melbourne is not a place for cheap shopping. you can buy MAC at david jones or myer department stores, and there's also a MAC store on Chapel Street, Prahran (which is a busy shopping strip and also has a Playboy store). The MAC prices will be the same anywhere, and not any cheaper. It may be worth going to Chadstone Shopping Centre too, but if you're from interstate, which im guessing you are, they're mostly chain stores there like just jeans, supre etc.<br>  <br>  have fun, melbourne totally rocks!|`|NuUMDTrTaa	If you don't have your own transport. you will probably just have to stay in the CBD. There are plenty of shops, from the DFO at Spencer street station to the new Queen Vic. corner of Swanston and Lonsdale, and all the shops in Collins, Bourke, Lonsdale and Elizabeth streets.<br>  Also the Queen Vic market at the top end of Elizabeth street, if they don't have what you want, probably no-one does. (Unless it's a Tuesday when the market is closed.)|`|SZZkfVzbaa	You can get good Nike shoes for around $140 at a regular shoe shop, but if you go to a Nike shop you might get them for less. It completely depends on how new the style is.<br>  <br>  PLayboy items can be bought from a small shop called What's New? There's definitely one in Knox and Eastland shopping centres. I think there's one in Forest Hill. This shop doesn't specialise in PLayboy stuff, but there's things like Clocks, Pillows, Lamps, that kind of stuff. For a big wall clock with a neon light, it costs $60. They're really cool though!<br>  <br>  Myer has MAC Makeup.<br>  <br>  Big City Chic is good. Millers is good too, but the stlye of clothing is mainly for Women 35+ cause it's a Womens store. They come in all sizes pretty much, not just for large Women.<br>  <br>  Kids clothing:<br>  Pumpkin Patch<br>  Cotton On Kids<br>  Supre' has OK clothes for girls, but the shop is designed for Teenagers. There are both 'grown up' and 'kid-appropriate' clothes there, all items coming in sizes from XXS - XL.<br>  <br>  Myer has Guess bags.<br>  <br>  ?M.

Unfortunately there is a problem: the quality of the data on urbanization in Brazil. José Eli da Veiga has stressed how unreliable and insane are the 1938 official criteria on definition of urban areas in Brazil. Official data on urban population in Brazil is hugely overestimated and weirdly related to the number of municipalities created. Therefore, historical trends on urbanization in Brazil are unreliable and international comparisons should be avoided.<br>  Recently, Embrapa used satellite images to identify urban areas and this is the best data that you can get. (The main limitation, obviously, is that there is no historical data)Australia`s rugby team arrived in France on Wednesday ahead of the Rugby World Cup which kicks off on September 7. The Wallabies immediately headed to the Quai Branly museum in Paris, which holds collections from Oceania, Asia, Africa and the Americas.

Bounded by the Atlantic Ocean on the east, Brazil has a coastline of over 7,367 kilometres.[1] It borders Venezuela, Suriname, Guyana and the department of French Guiana to the north, Uruguay to the south, Argentina and Paraguay to the southwest, Bolivia and Peru to the west, and Colombia to the northwest.[1] Numerous archipelagos are part of the Brazilian territory, such as Penedos de S?o Pedro e S?o Paulo, Fernando de Noronha, Trindade e Martim Vaz and Atol das Rocas.[1][2] Brazil was colonized by Portugal from 1500 until its independence in 1822. The republican system has been adopted since 1889, although its parliament dates back to 1824, when the first constitution was ratified. Its current Constitution defines Brazil as a Federative Republic.[3] The Federation is formed by the indissoluble association of the States, the Federal District, and the Municipalities.[3] There are currently 26 States and 5,564 Municipalities.[4] Brazil is the world's 9th largest economy in terms of purchasing power and the 10th largest economy at market exchange rates. Brazil has a diversified middle-income economy with wide variations in development levels, with mature manufacturing, mining and agriculture sectors. Technology and services also play an important role in the economy, and are growing rapidly. Brazil is a net exporter, having gone through free trade and privatization reforms in the 1990s. Brazil's economy outweighs that of any other Latin American country.[5][6] A pluralistic and multi-ethnic society, Brazil is also home to a diversity of wildlife in a variety of protected habitats. <br>   <br>   <br>  The first Brazilian Super Star was Leonidas called the Black Diamond by the Italians.<br>  <br>  --------------------------------------...<br>  <br>  Some other Brazilian legends of the past:<br>  <br>  Vava<br>  Gerson<br>  Nilton Santos<br>  Djalma Santos<br>  SO MANY PLAYERS TO LIST.

AA10523012	Well, your problem are not the ferrets, your problem is your status. If your bf is taking employment in KSA, you as a gf are not able to join him. In other words, you stay with the ferrets but without your bf. That much about Saudi Arabia.<br>  <br>  In the UAE things are a bit more relaxed. Also when it is considered being illegal to live together without being married, as long as nobody complains about you'll be fine. You just have to go on a visa run on a regular base (different story)<br>  <br>  Anyway, before you think about your ferrets you should think how possible it is for you to live together with your bf in an Islamic country (big NO NO in Saudi Arabia). <br>  <br>  To bring ferrets over to the UAE is not a problem at all. To relocate in an Islamic country you may think about getting married first. Ferrets then are included as family members:)) Whenever you want to move to the UAE with your ferrets, I will provide with the right contact how to do it.<br>  <br>  Take care.<br>  <br>  Take care.|`|lBRud4y5aa	You are wise to investigate.

Follow the guide in the building or ask anyone for the route. <br>  <br>  You can reach the destination on the day if you arrive in Japan until early afternoon. <br>  <br>  In fact, any route is somewhat hard to a stranger, because the terminals in Japan are so broad and crowded that you may be puzzled.

Maybe stick to email for now.<br>  <br>  Palestine is still not recognized as a country as it is still under the occupation of Israel.  Though Israel is negotiating with the Palestinians for 2-state solution, Israel has never changed its official standing about these two territories that they are part of Israel.  However, Israel did not go to the extent of annexing these territories, and granting their population Israeli citizenship as that will destroy the Jewish majority of Israel.  So in summary, Israel is not keeping them, or letting them go.  By international definition, they are lands under illegal military occupation.|`|Ic8FLXm5aa	They are undeclared territories, once occupied by Egypt and Jordan and now controlled by Israel.

But land and sea travel between the countries requires only a driver's license (or other approved government-issued photo ID) as well as a birth certificate or proof of citizenship.

However, usually E-4s and below are in the barracks unless they are married/have children. <br>  <br>  Anyways, the FCC is a government program and if you do not have a 4 year degree, you pretty much cannot hold a position a Japanese person would hold that is a professional. <br>  Also, do you speak fluent Japanese?  These Japanese children will be speaking Japanese, Okinawan dialect which is a lot different than the dialect in Tokyo.  If you cannot understand when a child says, "I have to pee" or "I feel sick" then you won't be a good provider and the answer is no. <br>  <br>  Also, depending on which branch of the military, you have a lot more strict rules on what you can and cannot do.  I can't speak for anything but the Army, but I know the Marines have really strict rules because they cannot seem to stop raping young Japanese girls or getting drunk and starting fights.|`|FF17zHUaaa	If your spouse is in the military..you'll be needing your spouse's commands approval first..i'm working off-base & no approval from my husband's chain of commands the reason i can do that is because i'm a resident here in Japan.But you being a SOFA Status you'll be needing those approvals.|`|jArRMPvKaa	this is not much of an answer but what r u tlkin bout

Typically they eat beans and rice as those are staples through out Central and So America.  In addition since they're not land locked they eat seafood-fish.  Finally, beef is popular in Costa Rica.  I don't know any names for specific dishes.  Google Costa Rican Food and see what some may/might be.|`|5mS41lBXaa	The attorney above mentioned some VERY yummy examples, we personally eat those often. <br>  <br>  They also use cilantro in alot of their dishes and fried plantains are common as well. Coffee is a staple in most households and is available all during the day, even at night! Horchata is a milkshake type drink that is very popular but my favorite of all is Tres Leche. It is a light fluffy type cake base with a mixture of 3 milks (crema media, evaporated milk and sweetened condensed milk) poured over and refrigerated. <br>  <br>  Another of my personal favorite dishes is the Ceviche! This dish consists of fish, cilantro, onions and lots of lime juice. <br>  <br>  Hope this helps!!|`|CYrT2c3Oaa	how... how...<br>  how do we eat?<br>  on a table with spoons, forks and knifes|`|mDYsr62maa	One dish left out is Fried Chicken!

kgBPU4xxaa	If you really want to do both on the same day, take an early train to Pisa and see the tower, the duomo and baptistry. Then take the train to Poggibonsi (on the train line to Siena). When you get to Poggibonsi, go to the bar at the end of the station and buy a ticket for the bus to San Gimignano. The bus stop is on the main road on the same side of the street as the station - just up the small hill from the station. This isn't too difficult to do, but not as easy as getting to Lucca from Pisa.|`|rvTcDJ6yaa	i don't know where san gimignano is but pisa is only about an hour from florence by train..its easy...Lucca is another lovely town to visit.

One for Pisa and another one for San Giminiano. Pisa and its famous Leaning Tower are just a train trip away from Florence. Travel time is just over an hour. <br>  To get to San Gimignano from Florence, take a SITA bus or train to Poggibonsi (In Poggibonsi, get off in the piazza above the railway station) then change to another bus for the short journey onwards to San Gimignano. Note that buses to and from San Gimignano aren't that frequent - the timetable is on the bus stop, so check return times in advance.

5VD9fVa1aa	By "East Montreal" do you mean the city of "Montreal-Est" or just the east end of Montreal?  <br>  <br>  "Montreal-Est" is a suburb of Montreal, quite far from downtown, with lots of oil refineries.  It's almost 90% French-speaking, working class, not much to do, not well served by public transport.<br>  <br>  If you mean the east end of Montreal, it's a pretty big place.  It's mostly French-speaking, but it depends on the district.  While a lot of it is suburban, residential, and not that well-off, some parts are slowly getting gentrified.  I lived near Frontenac metro for a few years.  It wasn't what I'd call a beautiful or rich neighbourhood, but the rent was dirt cheap and it was only a 15-minute subway ride to downtown.  And if you looked hard enough, you'd find all sorts of wierd and wonderful little shops, museums, and old buildings.|`|NB2NA2WSaa	They speak for French mostly, although some of them will speak for English.

There are many universities and colleges, including Washington State University, the University of Washington, Evergreen, etc. .|`|XifazAc5aa	YES TOTALLY! seattle is actually the prettiest city in the united states, with moderate temp, beautiful scenery with its mountains, trees, and puget sound. in summer the temp is about in the 70's and winter is usually low 40's. also the rain is ALWAYS AND I MEAN ALWAYS just a drizzle and 85% of the time it rains at night. there are also so many activities and sports like hiking and skiing in the mountains and going to fun sports games. there are many great colleges and the top three are uw in seattle, western washington in bellingham, and whitman in walla walla. But, i just moved from california over a year ago and there is definitely no place as beautiful as seattle!|`|4WEBY6Qkaa	i like seattle and san diego. i currently live in providence, ri, and i love it, but the cold dries my skin too much, so i'm deciding between san diego and seattle. seattle is beautiful but there is too many snooty people, so i'm leaning toward san diego, wich is more friendly.|`|AA10252373	I visited Washington State last year and wished I could move there.

Lot's of small ones too that give more individual classes.  Depending upon how what you want to get from your college experience would determine which one you would want to attend.<br>  <br>  Here are several:<br>  <br>  The University of Washington: <a href="http://www.washington.edu" rel="nofollow">http://www.washington.edu</a><br>  Class size about 35,000 students.  <br>  <br>  Seattle University:  Private Catholic College  www.seattleu.edu<br>  <br>  Seattle Pacific University:  Christian University small campus:<a href="http://www.spu.edu/" rel="nofollow">http://www.spu.edu/</a><br>  <br>  Bastyr University: College of Natural Healing: <a href="http://www.bastyr.edu" rel="nofollow">http://www.bastyr.edu</a><br>  <br>  Seattle is different than Florida.  It would be a great change for you.  I work in the hospitality industry and come into contact with  a great number of people here visiting from your state and everyone loves it here.  Of course it is during the spring and summer rarely in the fall and winter.  I am sure it would be too cold for most of them visiting.<br>  <br>  And they are usually retired.  For somebody young and fresh what a great experience it would be for you to live for a while in Seattle.  <br>  <br>  Up to date warnings about the University of Washington:<br>  <br>  Recently there have been lots of crime in the area.  A girl was raped attending a party, there have been several robberies close to campus. (they caught them and they were actually soldiers in the Army).  And a robbery at night on a busy avenue.  <br>  <br>  There is also a giant house next to the campus where the land lady rents it to sexual predators.  The college is trying to pressure her from renting to them but so far has been unsuccessful.<br>  <br>  Other than that it is fine.  That is where I went.<br>  <br>  And in the spring time the Cherry trees are beautiful.<br>  <br>  If money was no problem, I would attend Seattle University.  Nice area, good campus, small classes about 30 students.  And they now have a basketball team!|`|WXCa8zQoaa	sure i have lived here all my life and it is very nice and we got some good collages

I guess flying would be the best way to go though if you are only wanting to visit Venice, the flight shouldn't be that long. London and Venice aren't that far apart.

lo3T01BOaa	In my opinion, California is better. The weather is obviously the biggest difference. No snow in California and no bitter cold weather in winter (unless you're up in the mountains). New York City has better night life than LA or San Francisco, but it's expensive to live in NYC. It's expensive to live in most parts of California as well, but nothing compared to living anywhere near Manhattan. The rest of NY state, especially upstate, is an economically depressed area in the rust belt and the areas I've been there aren't very appealing. People will be people anywhere, so you'll find good and bad people in any city, state, country. California has more major league sports teams than New York state and because of the better weather, you can do outdoor sports a lot longer in CA than you can in NY. But if you like hockey, then you might want to stay in NY as the average Californian knows nothing about hockey.<br>  <br>  I personally prefer California because of the diverse landscape (ocean, mountain, desert) and easy access to so many major cities such as San Francisco, Los Angeles, San Diego, Las Vegas, etc.|`|3K1QW7Oeaa	Where I live.|`|P9wE9XZlaa	california|`|zjxr6fRsaa	California|`|qdsVS1dDaa	This would have to be ranked on the basis of personal preference.<br>  <br>  Regards,<br>  Dan

You can have your cell phone with you.|`|CpJnhy1saa	Any gel, lotion, paste or cream must be in a 3.4 ounce container or smaller. (If is is measured in metric, it is 100ml or less). You can not have a larger container with less than 3.4 ounce in it. That will get tossed. Remember this includes toothpaste, sunscreens, gel deoderant, lipstick and gloss and mascara. You are allowed as many of these small containers as will fit into a 1 quart ziploc bag and it has to zip all the way closed. Any powdered or solid toiletries do not have to be in a quart sized bag.

Just remember that it has no relation to the physical location of each station.  To navigate Paris, look at your regular map, find the stations nearest your current location and your destination, then find these station names on the Metro map.  If the stations are on different lines, you have to find the nearest point where the lines cross (an interchange, in other words).  The station names are called out as your approach them, but you often cannot understand the lousy tannoy, so the thing to do is count stops and occasionally peek out the window to check the station name when the train stops.|`|fkHBVn7taa	I found it easy to navigate  on paper.

No British Company will be able to help, only one that is presently in Jamaica.  You may have to fax over details of your driving licence.

2c7869fbf2bfda8e590501ddb5545f2caa	You should got to the Montmartre area.  Where all the artists are out and where Sacre Coeur Basilica is.  The view you get from there is outstanding and there are also lots of nice restaurants and bars nearby.  Its a great area.  You can get the metro and get off at Abbessess Metro Stop to go there.  When you come out of the Metro just take first right hill and at the top is Sacre Coeur and Montmartre.    Arc de Triomphe and Champs Eleysees are not far from the Eiffel Tower so you can do all of them in a short space of time.  Charles De Gaulle Etoile is the Metro Stop for Champs Eleysees.  The Bottom of the Champs Eleysees has Notre Dame and Pompidou Centre to the left and the Louvre to the right but you need a long time for the louvre and so perhaps it wont be for you this trip.      You will love Paris.  Have a great time    P.S. Possibly a day ticket on bus top tour would be good for you as you will get to see all the main sights and dont need to walk much if you dont want to.  Its around 20Euros.  They leave from the Champs Eleysees (at the top facing the Arc de Triomphe - Right hand side)    For shopping you need to go to the Galleries Lafayette - huge shopping area and you can shop till you drop.|`|056cd57fe1506567da3828f5884632ecaa	I would totally recommend you do a New Paris free tour (Well, it's technically free, but the guides expect a tip. But they usually deserve it!!)     It gets in all the big sites. . . and you'd still have time for shopping!    http://www.newparistours.com/index.php?o...|`|162da01a5ff17359a07ed6c8b2fcec55aa	Eiffel Tower of course, but also Notre Dame, Champs-lyses/Arc du Triomphe, Montmartre/Sacre Coeur Basilica, the Louvre...  these are some of the big sights.   You could spend 4 hours in the Louvre and barely see anything, but it's worth it to at least see the big 3: Venus de Milo, Winged Victory, and of course Mona Lisa. They also have tons of really cool Egyptian, Persian, Mediterranean antiquities and paintings from just about every era starting with Renaissance. The architecture of the building itself is really amazing. If you are under 26 you can get a discount to the Louvre (6euro instead of 9) and on Friday evenings after 6pm it's free for under-26s.   There are so many things to see in Paris, why are you only going for a day? If you are going for a quick trip, I would recommend a weekend instead of only a day.|`|iCzMOXOWaa	the louvre and notre dame?
23c9fc7bde15c121fd9aadacf01a0339aa	From Schonefeld airport you can catch a Regional Express train (RE, they're the red double deck trains) directly to the Hauptbahhof. The railway station is 5 minutes walk from the airport terminal and there is a partly covered footpath. The ride into the city is about 15 minutes and the trains are quite frequent.  You can also catch an S-Bahn train but that will take about 40 minutes.  Listen carefully to the station Tannoy though, they sometimes have platform changes!    The Hauptbahnhof is about 10 minutes walk from your apartments. Just leave the station in the direction of the Brandenburg Tor (gate) and start walking. You pass the new government buildings on the way (very smart and modern). Walk past the Reichstag and through the Gate into the road Unter Den Linden.   Turn first right into Wilhelmstrasse. This road has security bollards to protect the British Embassy (you see it on the right) against car bombs; walk past the Embassy and straight across the crossroads of Behren Strasse and your flat is just a bit along on from there.   If you have heavy luggage take a taxi. It's a few minutes ride.    I have no idea what the Apartments am Brandenburg Tor are like because I usually stay in the Hotel Tiergarten (Alt Moabit, near UBhf Turmstrasse).     One of the best ways to get familiar with Berlin is to buy a BVG Welcome Card as soon as you arrive. You will find a BVG desk at the airport, or the newsagent will sell them. This is a city Travelcard which is valid on S+U Bahn, Trams, Busses and Regional Express (RE) trains. It comes with a book of discount vouchers. Use them, they're good; and this will also provide you with a great introductory "tour" of things worth seeing and doing. It will supplement an ordinary guide book very well indeed.|`|2c7869fbf2bfda8e590501ddb5545f2caa	Get the airport bus from Schonfeld and it will take you to the centre of Berlin.  Your hotel is near the Gates so you are pretty central.  A taxi is not expensive though (Around 20euros) either so consider and you will get right to your hotel no problem.    Not stayed in your hotel but was in Berlin last October.  The tours all leave from where you are so you can pick and choose.  Most of the tours are wa related as you can imagine but there are bus top tours and walking tours.  All of which are great.   Have a good time.|`|c0b3df9e6b5632ff0bda2a96cf938465aa	The really best thing you can do in Berlin is buy a "BVG Atlas" (a comprehensive map of Berlin's public transport system) and buy a weekly or a "tourist welcome" ticket, and then just ride all the subways, trams, busses, and even local trains. In my personal opinion, Berlin's public transport system is the best in the world. And if you really got stuck in the woods, take your mobile and call a taxi. They're there 24/7.
