20090308091557AAgdbiU	Pets;Dogs	Why does my puppy keep biting my feet?	He keep biting my shoes, and sometimes bites my skin around my ankles. I say NO, take his teeth off me, but it just seems to get him more worked up and he bites harder!   He has a habit of biting my hands too. I realise it's just play biting, but sometimes he leaves me with cuts, and it really does hurt!      He only has a few chew toys at the moment, but I'll be getting him more tomorrow. Could the lack of toys be the reason he keeps biting me?      Any advice?

I am considering buying this mare, and was wondering how her conformation is.   I know she could use more muscle tone here and there, but how s her actual bone structure?   Do you think she is capable of holing a more level top line under saddle?    I would be riding her in Western Pleasure, Horsemanship, maybe a little showmanship, lots of trail riding, and eventually some English ridding, on the flat. If I did decide to jump is would not ever be over 2 feet. Is she capable of doing this?   I know I asked this yesterday, but I did not get many good answers.   Thanks a lot!

20090308093410AAE0hNz	Pets;Cats	Do you think it'd be a mistake to get a kitten so soon?	My cat, Snowball was hit by a car while I was on vacation.  She got outside and someone hit her and just left her there.  My mom didn't tell me at first (she was watching my pets) and I spent hours and hours making calls, searching for her, and so forth.  She finally admitted that she got hit but she was afraid I'd blame her.  I don't blame her, accidents happen.  She was a beautiful all white cat that was only a year old!  I want to get a new kitten but I'm going to wait a while.  I'd adopt an older cat but I have 2 older cats that wouldn't tolerate a new older cat but will put up with a kitten.  What's really sad is how much my dogs liked Snowball and they would all play together!  I'm so sad.

My dog is very healthy and needing to go to the vet is rare for him so forgive me if I sound a little ignorant.       Basically, my dog is going to have to have a bad claw torn off tomorrow. I'm just glad he has no idea. They say they will try and get it off without putting him under an anaesthetic first, but if it comes to it, they will have to give him one. Will he get a local or general one and how much will it cost? He is a fully grown male Staffordshire Bull Terrier.      And before anyone asks, yes I can pay for it, but there is no harm in enquiring is there?
20090308100409AAxs4iU	Pets;Dogs	Joint pain or hip problems?	For the last 2 weeks my 13 yr old german shephard has been showing a lot of signs of discomfort. He has now refused to walk down the 3stairs on the porch, he uses the bathroom on the porch. He fell down them a couple times recently. He is having a hard time getting up and down, sometimes I have to help him pick up his back end or he just gives up and lays back down. When he does get up his back end is a little wobbly at first. I live in the country, and my vet does not have an x-ray machine. I have scheduled an appointment with another vet in the city for this week.       my question is... is there anything I can do for him in the meantime? It kills me to watch him like this? Also, do you think he is dying? Everyone I talk to and tell his age, they just act like he is dying and I should put him out of his misery. I dont want him to suffer just because I refuse to let him go BUT I also dont wanna let him go if I dont have to. Thanks       ps..he has used the bathroom in the house a few times which is unlike him. He whines. He still eats

20090308101348AATRsVD	Pets;Fish	Snail eggs stuck in a net and dried for nearly 8 years managed to hatch when dipped back into water?	I was just thinking back to when I was young.  I had a 5 gallon tank with 3 neon tetras and a 6 year old albino cory (he lived for 7 and a half years before dying!).  The tank was running great for nearly half a year until I had to take out a dead neon.  I used my dads old net that had been hanging up in the basement unused for 8 years.  This net had been used 8 years ago in my dads old 55 gal tank which had a really bad snail infestation.  I remember how my dads Oscar use to crush the snails up against the glass as a form of entertainment.  :)      Anyway I used this old net to scoop out a dead neon in my 5gal tank.  A few weeks later my tank got a snail infestation!  I put 2 and 2 together and figured the only way this could have happened is the dried snail eggs stuck in the net got into my tank and hatched.  I never added any new fish before the infestation, so getting the eggs from the store carried home on a fish is out of the question.      I'm not BS ing,  this actually happened.   Can snail eggs really hatch after been out of water and dried for 8 years?

20090308104332AAlXwcs	Pets;Dogs	6 month old german shepherd, seems nervous scared?	Hello, I have worked with several GSD's. I have always worked with full grown overly aggressive dogs. Dogs that have been abused, and or neglected. i have never worked with the abused dogs that have gone "shy". Always the dogs who's fear triggers extreme aggression.       I have a pup now who's comes from a long line of accomplished police, search and rescue, and various other service dogs. He is 6 months old. The breeder i got him from is about 75 years old and lives on a farm. The pup is just now coming indoors for the first time and is adjusting. I understand all the new sights and sounds and enviornment take some getting used to. I took him to my farm and he was extremely confident. He did not mess with the cows or horses and needed almost no behavioral corrections.      What concerns me is the dog is very intimidated by people. it has warmed up to me and listens like no other dog i have worked with. However, if i am at the fence and the neighbor comes to talk the dog scampers back to about 20 yards, and will not come when called.    I am not sure the proper procedure here. I hear that they go through a fear stage at about 6 months. is there any validity to that? I have only experience in correcting the exact opposite behavior. This is a magnificent working dog and i do not want to get it right. i have spent years fixing dogs who's owners have "ruined".      My one other concern is the dogs behavior toward other dogs when in my presence. I KNOW HOW to correct this behavior, but i am not certain whether the dogs motivation is jealousy or natural protective behavior. He will go after much larger dogs that, he is clearly afraid of, if they approach me too fast. I can correct that behavior i was just wondering if anyone has experienced that.      Thanks,   Matt

20090308105647AAhPmnT	Pets;Rodents	Feeling a Pregnant Guinea Pig's Abdomen?	I am fairly knowledgeable when it comes to Guinea Pigs but was wondering if anyone experienced in their breeding could help me. I believe one of my Sows, Imogen is just over 4 weeks pregnant. She is drinking alot more as well as eating and sleeping more and tolerating petting less than usual. As well as her tummy swelling slightly, I am thinking the chances are likely.       By this stage, by gently palpitating her stomach should I be able to feel the foetuses? Other than a Vet check and the obvious signs I can see, what else would confirm it more? How SHOULD the abdomen feel? Like small sacs?      Thanks.

They're great for just about everything: riding, stable work, shows (if i clean them), but a lot of times, especially in cold weather, the rubber doesn't really make keeping my heels down very easy, and when the material creases, it cuts into the top of my foot and is really uncomfortable! I've considered field boots, because they're more flexible, but they're kind of expensive for every day riding especially since I'm probably still growing and will need new ones in a year or two. i've also thought about paddock boots with half chaps? what should i get that's a good quality, affordable price, and most comfortable? I ride english, classic or hunt seat (but i haven't started jumping yet, this is just riding on the flat in my lessons and when i lease a horse this summer).

20090306231119AABQmSQ	Pets;Fish	Can Bettas accept tank change easily, and have vacation food?	I rescued this sweet Betta "Swishy" from his 1" of water at Walmart, about a year ago. He has been living in a approximately 10" round bowl since then, with rock and plastic plant. He gets lots of attention and is very responsive. Because of his small environment, I monitor his water conditions daily, etc. We are going on vacation for 10 days, and I am afraid to leave him in the hands of the pet sitter, who may not take enough care of him.  I am wondering if I should get him a tank with heater and filter, or will this big a change, freak him out? Also, is there such a thing as vacation food for a Betta? We went away for 4 nights a few months ago and it took me a month to get him eating properly again. The pet sitter, like so many people - "he is just a fish" mentality, I guess - didn't put any thought into how she fed him, in spite of all the instructions that I left. Betta owners, any experience with this? Thanks!

The past couple of days he has had his eyes closed a lot and hasn't been eating very much. He has also seemed extremely docile, way more than usual. I think I'm doing everything right, this isn't my first lizard. I have been feeding him small crickets, dusting them with calcium powder every other day and also giving him fresh veggies. He has a water bowl plus I have been misting him twice a day just incase. I actually saw him drink the other day so, I know thats not the problem. He also has UBV lighting and his temps seem to be ok. Under his basking light it seems to stay around 100 degrees and his cooler side sticks around 85. He has plenty of hide spots and everything of that nature. Does anybody have any suggestions. Thank!

Today before my dad left for work (I am sick so I've been home and not going to school)  I guess my dad locked one of the kittens in his room. I came upstairs about 10pm (I woke up about 9 and went downstairs to watch some TV) I heard meowing. I let her out. I just went into his room to use the restroom and found that she must have been bored enough that she broke the other side of the bath tub. There are two openings that were glued down that leads to underneath the bathtub. They have already broken the other one that my dad duck-taped back on and today she broke the other side. They LOVE playing in the back where all the tubes and stuff are for the bath. Dad hates it because he knows how expensive it'll be to fix it if they chew or break on it because his bath has power jets.      What has your pets destroyed recently?

He is almost 4, has had 6 months of profetional training, 2 months of amatuar training ( wich realy didnt do anything all she did was give him bad habbits, wich are now fixed) and is now we are putting on 2 or 3 months of profetional training with a paint trainer. He probably about 16 hands tall now, sorrel paint (not solid) he is very gorgous. His ground manners are good but could be better with some work.      He has points in halter and something else i cant remember atleast thats what the old owner says. He has been to one show since we had him and did realy good. He is kinda hard to canter though as he is lazy. We payed $5,000 for him before the market went down alot. But do you think we could atleast get $5,000 out of him if not more. or what price do you think we could get out of him?

20090227103519AABrKk7	Pets;Dogs	CAN MY BOSTON TERRIER BE HELPED?	I have a female boston terrier, and she has had equalibrium problems since she had puppies on November 15, 2009.  She has been under the care of two vets, who are at a loss, for ear infections.  She began with a baterial and yeast infection in both ears.  She developed a head tilt early on, and still has the head tilt.  She loses her balance, and falls.  Sometimes she seems to be paralyzed, but is able to get up and move.  She is having bi-lateral problems (both ear drums have ruptured).  Our local vet has flushed out her ears with warm water, and light suction, but there seems to still be some debris in her ear.  I have an appointment next week with a specialist who is planning on putting her to sleep and doing a deep flush of her ears.  This procedure is very expensive, and not sure it will solve my dogs problems.  Has anyone else experienced something like this?
20090227104522AA4PAr3	Pets;Horses	Winergy Equilibrium Growth?	I've got a young thoroughbred gelding he'll be 2 at the end of April. At the moment I have him on Stud & Youngstock mix, Sugar beet, Dengie Hi Fi and supplements.       When he turns 2 Stud & Youngstock mix is no longer required because you can feed them up to 2 years.      My friend still has her youngster on stud and youngstock mix and he's 3 in April. Does the feed do anything for them after they are 2?      Now I've heard you can give Winergy Equilibrium Growth until they are 4? I was wondering if you could tell me a little bit more about it and your experience with it. Would you recommend it? Or not? And why?      If you wouldn't recommend Winergy Equilibrium Growth what other alternatives are there? And what is best?      Thanks!

I was just going to take him to the shelter, but after a few days we all fell in love with him!   We took him to the vet, got his shots, got him fixed and everything. But he wont leave my older cats alone! He attacks them constantly, (especially the fatter one who really cant defend herself that well)   anyway, is there anything I can do to stop him from attacking them?

I adopted my cat just over 2 weeks ago from the shelted because his owner gave him up because he was too boistrous. He is 10 months old. At first, he was find and loved to play and cuddle. He was completely settled in within 3 days, and is acting like he lived here all his life. Now whenever i try to stroke him he attacks my hand! I have never done anything bad to him at all. He bites alot, and scratches too. He eats all the plants in my house and thinks my headphones are toys. He keeps lifting up my rug at night, and going under it and scratching it up which makes A LOT of noise, and it wakes me up. I have tried the spray bottle but it doesnt work. I cant keep him out of my room because he meows all night long. I have realised his canine teeth are slightly sticking out, and i checked his mouth, but they are pretty long. What do i do with him! I dont know what to do. My parents are telling me to give him back, but i really dont want to. Today I was just playing with him with a toy on a piece of string on a stick and he attacked me and made me bleed. and he hissed too. What do i do?!? I dont want to give him up

This does not make any sense to me. If one fancy goldfish needs 20 gallons, then if you get another fancy goldfish, shouldn't you be adding 20 more gallons instead of 10? If you only add 10 more gallons with each additional fish, then that would mean that you don't really need 20 gallons for one goldfish, 15 would be just fine.    Or am I just reading this wrong?   Someone please explain this too me.

She seems to really understand, but will have an accident on the floor every once in a while.  We got her from a pet store, which makes things very hard.  She does defecate and urinate in her kennel, which most dogs don't do.      We have a bell on our door, which she rings when she needs to go outside.  Half of the time, we go out there for 5-10 minutes, and she doesn't do anything, and then goes on the floor as soon as we get inside.  She goes out after every nap and every time she rings the bell.      We have another dog as well, he's 6 months old and also goes potty on the floor.  Would this have any effect on her?

I have seen on websites that it is improper to discipline your dog when they mess on the floor.  Most websites and books I have read say to just clean it up and not address it, because by the time we notice it, they've already forgotten about.  another book said if we smack them and rub their noses in it, they will find spots where we'll never find it so they won't get hit.  I've never seen a website that told me to do it this way.      However, when talking to other dog owners, they all tell me to do this.  what is the proper way?

My wife and I decided to foster a pregnant AmStaff, and keep fostering her and the puppies until good homes were found. Well soon we fell in love with our sweet girl and decided there was no way we could let her go. We also adopted the two puppies she had as well. I realize we did a good thing by trying to foster, but I feel so guilty that we couldn't stick to the plan. There are so many other dogs we could helped, and now we can't.      We love pit bulls dearly and think they're amazing dogs. Which is why we wanted to do what we could to help, and we can't even do that. Obviously it will be many, many years till we're able to try again, but how do you form that bond, and friendship, and then just let them go to another home?

This obviously stirs up a lot of yukky stuff in the water. I noticed last week when i did the water change that the fish were very active afterwards and the same this week, but they don't look happily active, they look a bit distressed. One of them seems a little "drunk"      Last night my filter stopped working and when i investigated it, the propeller bit was stuck with slime, i used a jug of tank water to rinse it off and it's working again fine.      I was just wondering if the stir up of gunk with the siphon is making the guys act peculiar after the weekly clean, my aquatic's centre said it shouldn't matter if it gets stirred up but when the water is clearer before cleaning than afterwards, i have to wonder!      There's so much conflicting advice on the net it's hard to tell the good from the bad.

No symptoms yet - which leads us to think it's bone cancer.    2 lots of blood tests taken 2 months apart with no change in results so probability is very small that it is anything other than cancer.      He's under the very best vet care, but given his age, the vet and I are reticent to do invasive procedures.       I've been trying to find references for expected length of life and quality of life if he is not treated by chemo drugs, but can only find web pages specific to radiation/chemo treatment.      Can you help me find references?      At this stage he seems 100% healthy and normal, so the blood test results were a huge shock.

It knows when and where the food is and uses it's head to feel for the food. it will then jump around trying to get food unsuccessfully majority of the time untill it gives up. If i hold the food in my fingers it is quite capable of eating it.    Note i have tried varies types of food and feeding times.

20070830225936AABQPGV	Pets;Dogs	I must go to work for 8 hours.  What to do about 13 week old puppy? 8 hrs in a crate doesn't sound pleasant.	So earlier I asked a question about my puppy.  Now I think I've pinpointed the real issue.  I really do not think that 8 hours in a crate is the way to go.  Bedtime I can see being in a crate, but all day in a crate seems psychologically damaging for a puppy.  It is not likely that some one can come home and let her out every day.  will the kitchen suffice for now until she is old enough?  She will get plenty of exercise in the evening and morning after she gets the rest of her vaccinations in approx. two weeks if I am not mistaken.

20090227111542AA8jwdp	Pets;Fish	Ugh, ich help please : (?	So my mom bought from an infected store, and since we use the same equipment for all the tanks (ie. nets, clips, siphon ect.) All three tanks are now affected.   I'm primarily worried about my 20 gallon guppy tank, as they have been hit hard.  I've read that guppy are particularly susceptible to ich, and that seems to be true considering the war path it's burning through my tank.   So I've upped the temp to 30 Celsius, as I've read this is high enough to kill the free swimming parasite.   Added salt.   And am dosing with QuickCure.   My question is, is there anything else I can do?   I'm not isolating as pretty much every guppy has at least one dot, although no one has more than five dots.  But I also have ghost shrimp and otto cats in there.   Any other home remedies or suggestions peeps have on handling this? I read that the parasites life, when the temp is roughly this high, can be about 8-10 days. True?    I've also read that pretty much nothing affects the "dot" stage of their life cycle.  I did some salt baths on the worst guppies though.   Any help is appreciated!     I've never had an outbreak this bad...then again I've never done guppy before : P

Been riding for 18 months and can walk, trot, canter and do small jumps.      Willing to work in any weather and anywhere. And I am reliable and a hard worker. And willing to learn more.      I am about 5 ft 3 maybe 5 ft 4 ish.      Have had some past experiences on working with horses as i used to help at a rescue centre where there was some horses. so i would help muck out stable and fields and groom them.      I live in the aberdeenshire area in hatton (near ellon & peterhead.)      So if you need help with your horse/s please get intouch.

Then he thinks this thing is biting him, and he jumps his butt away from whatever this thing is.      It's amusing to watch and all, but is he seeing things?

20070207001443AAe3rPr	Pets;Cats	Drastic change in cats personality...?	I have a 12 year old male cat, who's always been extremely sweet and affectionate. He'd wrap his arms around your neck and purr and kiss your ears. Our friends and neighbors know him and love  him. He's also a great climber and loves to hang from doorways.   About 5 nights ago, we noticed he seemed to be alittle deppressed, like he was feeling under the weather. But he was eating normally, drinking and since he is an outdoor-potty cat we assume he's going to the bathroom as normal since he leaves a few times during the day to go outside.   Within about 24 hours we noticed he was being less responsive to affection and seemed almost freaked out.   You pick him up and he shrinks up, all stiff and tense, and won't make eye contact. He tends to sit on the corner of the bed with his face in the wall, or huddled on a pillow. Normally you can get him to relax to the point of jello by a good belly rub, but now he just stays stiffly in your arms...

I am so sad!?	* First of all, to let you know, my kitten IS fixed*   My kitten used to be the most cuddly and loveable kitty you ever would meet. He would stay in my arms for half an hour happily while i walked around doing chores. He would crawl under my covers and sleep right by my pillow at night. He would constantly go in my lap, and loved it when i carried him around.       Now that hes 5 months old, his personality has changed. He doesnt like it when i pick him up and always tries to crawl out of my arms. He doesnt follow me around anymore, and doesnt sleep on my bed. He doesnt crawl in my lap as much, and when i gently pick him up and put him in my lap and pet him, he usually walks away. He isnt totally unsociable, and still loves to be pet and purrs, but he just isnt the same. He has regular vet visits, so i dont think its anything medical.      Why is my kitty doing this? Is there anything i can do to get his old personality back?
