fR2Geezcaa	Please try to ignore all the answers that are fall under the area of "spam"!<br>  <br>  Since you do not have any prior experience try to address this in a cover letter. Simply explain that over the last couple years you were in school full time seeking your degree. If there were any extra bits of information you could add such as volunteer work, deans list, etc it would fill in the blanks. <br>  <br>  For the resume try to address these main points, make them your headers even.<br>  <br>  - Objective (I am seeking a position as .... )<br>  <br>  - Work History,try to mention the "office/management" type work that you did for the liquor store,like you helped or did end of day cash reports, deposits, inventory, etc. Don't just say cashier and leave it as that. Everyone knows the basics of being a cashier. <br>  <br>  - Specialized Skills and Training, other than your degree. Maybe list what computer software your knowledgeable in and if you ever received training on something like how to identify fraudulent checks/credit cards, things like that. <br>  <br>  - Schooling, When listing your High School Diploma never put the year you graduated. People will form decsions and judgements about your age before you ever walk in their door. It is better to be given a chance to impress them before they have already formed an opion.<br>  <br>  - References, Ask your manager at the liquor store if he would give a reference or a teacher from school would be great. Never use a family member.<br>  <br>  Stay away from personal things, like listing your hobbies. Nobody cares if you bowl, jog or spend your free time with family. It's just not professional to include items like that now a days.<br>  <br>  The fact that you have only had one job and one not in your chosen career actually will not be as much as a hindrance as you may think. Company's like a "newbies" for lack of a better term. It shows your not set in your ways and will be open to doing things their way.<br>  <br>  Kudoe's on the degree and Good Luck!|`|WoRaXE73aa	You might still want to note the liquor store job, you never know. And you might use this section to list your skills. <br>  <br>  This website has resume examples, which might help you in making your own resume:
ePkiOzPSaa	Yep, it means that the previous homeowners thought that there may have been ghosts haunting it.  I don't have much else to say about that... good luck.
AA10472839	It's not short selling. <br>  <br>  "Do they charge large commission fee on this"?<br>  On what?    If you buy a stock you pay commission.  If you sell a stock you pay commission.<br>  <br>  Why are you trading stocks if you don't know the basics?  You can really hurt your financial health.|`|k2Jbp9e6aa	That's not short selling -  which is selling borrowed stock  and paying off the loan from the hoped-for profit. You didn't say how much stock you re-bought; but if it was less than the original holding you'd have saved commission and locked in some profit by selling just a portion of your shares. That way you'd have had one commission charge going in and another charge for getting some out. What you did entailed an additional charge for buying back in again.<br>   The commission per trade will depend largely upon the price per share and the volume.  No charge will  depend upon the activity that preceded it.

AA11315360	Ask to see the contract again and reread it. Usually a period of time before you leave after announcing that you quit is a curtisoy NOT a legal requirement.<br>  But I suggest you reread the contract, which you have every right to do. If it says they "ask" for a 30 day notice then it means you can leave whenever, but you are burning bridges with that hospital.<br>  I suggest reading the contract and lie and tell them you are moving and cant give a 30 day notice. Say it was sudden and you are sorry.|`|N9UaUMBkaa	I hate people that send b.s. answers like the one above. ok well it all depends on whatever the paper really said i would go tell them that i would like a copy of all my paperwork, then go for a free consult with a lawyer and show them the copies to see if it is binding.<br>  Jay Allison|`|AA11966821	Absolutely.  You signed a legally binding agreement and must give 30 days notice.  It does not have to be a term contract.  If you had, for example, signed a one-year contract, you would have to stay for a year.  And it has nothing to do with getting a sign-on bonus.  That is irrelevant.  No excuses.  You have to give a 30-day notice.  <br>  <br>  If you fail to meet your obligation, your name is mud with the new employer anyway -- you are unreliable.  You will have to call the new employer, tell them you are required to give 30 days notice, and can you start after 30 days' notice to current employer.

suWnr83laa	The part about her being told in Sept that they could not do anything about restructuring until she was late is probably true. The part about the whole foreclosure happening without her notice is a load of bull. They have to serve her papers. Also, a realtor is not going to just ask her when she is going to be out of the house if it has been foreclosed on. Try doing a search for "clerk of court" or "county clerk" or similar for your county and see what they have available online. Then try to pull up foreclosure, real estate, or chancery cases. You are not getting the whole story from your friend.|`|4UBxVIYFaa	Your friend not only took classes in how to scam the system, but she's also a brazen liar.  She was NOT foreclosed upon without any notice.  Every state has statutes which require that she be served with legal papers prior to the foreclosure action, as well as having the attempted action published in a local newspaper.  There is more to this story than you are hearing.<br>  <br>  Meanwhile, if the foreclosure action is not yet completed, she can retain the house by paying herself up to date, according to her mortgage contract, and that will include ALL legal costs the lender has incurred thus far for the foreclosure.|`|23SkYEw5aa	if she had actually worked as hard to pay her bills as she did trying to scam the system, she would have had a problem.<br>  <br>  With that said.  Pay the mortgage up to date.  Unless she spent the money that she didn't pay on the mortgage.

f0a32e61345899913bee88cf33014f9daa	As for as medical coding goes, it definitely isn't easy that's for sure, but it's not exactly "hard" either. There are so many rules, and some exceptions to the rules when it comes to coding. You really have to know what you're doing, and it is a constant learning process. That is why it is difficult to get a job doing coding fresh out of school, because employers know that school only teaches you the basics, and the real learning is on the job.... a lot of employers want to hire people with experience, rather than someone who will initially have a lot of learning to do.   it took me 2.5  years to finally find a coding job ,  i started  out as a medical receptionist to get my foot in the door.      this will give you some info on what the process is <a href="http://www.wisegeek.com/what-does-a-medical-coder-do.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.wisegeek.com/what-does-a-medi...</a>|`|CI6WZs3jaa	You need to learn basic medical terminology.

eKtEWrcmaa	If you want your group to be legal you must at least incorporate with your state as a non profit. If you don't want to file for your 501c3 status you don't have to. <br>  <br>  Go to your secretary of states website and read up on incorporating as a non profit. It should have a search for you to check if the name you want is available. Ours was just a 3 page easy application and $60. We were approved within the week for it.<br>  <br>  Incorporating will help protect you from any legal issues that may arise and will protect your groups name from anyone else using it. You won't deal with the IRS but with your states department of revenue.<br>  <br>  Also you can do any of this without an expensive lawyer.

gtTg0XOOaa	Well, firstly right now all over the nation companies are laying off employees right and left. So your story isn't all that uncommon. However if this has been the case for your whole life, it may be your working style. If you don't really stand out among your coworkers as being especially valuable to the company, they would select you to go first. Also, some jobs are just very temporary. It's unusual to find someone who's been working for the same construction company for twenty years. That type of work is highly transitional. The same goes for bar tending, entertainment, etc.|`|2PDBxlYDaa	Forget the past. It happened and its over. Everyone makes mistakes, hopefully most of us learn from ours. Now ask yourself what you want out of a job. Do you want meaning, recognition or a paycheck? Some people want all of this, others just want a paycheck and others just want meaning.<br>  <br>  You can't always get all of those things from a job. Sometimes there are good jobs that don't pay as well but people take them because they like the field and enjoy it. You just have to ask yourself what you want out of a job, and be realistic. I believe in being a realistic optimist.<br>  <br>  I don't care how old you are either. Its never too late. Don't beat yourself up about the past. What matters is today and tomorrow. I wouldn't feel bad about being let go from the last job because its the economy. Its affecting everyone.<br>  <br>  Its not just you. You say you're smart, okay, do you listen to other people? Don't be a know it all. Sometimes there are smart people who have a need to show off and they're annoying. Talk but let other people talk as well. Its good to want recognition and to express something that you did well but don't take it to extremes and brag too much.<br>  <br>  If you're doing everything you can to improve yourself, perhaps you could benefit from short-term counseling. A professional counselor would try to help you and try to give you constructive criticism.|`|CLQxDI6waa	well, maybe you picked the wrong job, try doing something you enjoy.

Couple things I noticed (which isn't much because I obviously don't know you)<br>    <br>  1. If you look anything like your avatar you don't seem to care about your appearance or maybe you don't like to put on airs.  Get a haircut, look professional,act professional get some confidence (not arrogance) there is a difference.<br>  2. It doesn't matter if you are smart or not, going the extra mile is what matters. <br>  3. Some people don't realize there is something about them that turns people off (everybody has their blind spot)  For example, there was this guy who was a hard worker and respectful of everyone but his breath could kill a buzzard 3 yards away (and he had no clue!)   He also was such a big brown noser that people felt uncomfortable because he seemed to act so fake acting like he respected you.<br>  I have a friend who is rude and long winded and a lot of people get turned off but he refuses to notice the connection between that and why some people avoid him. It could be anything!  Ask someone who is not your friend who is willing to tell you straight.<br>  4. One more point.  Being negative at work generally does not generate pity it makes you not wanted.  People want to keep people and hire people who like themselves (not arrogant) and are optimistic.   You are depressed right now, but you can't be like this all the time or you create a self-fulfilling prophecy.<br>  <br>  Good luck, God bless.
eACZ1Rhjaa	Your friend having parties there all the time might be what makes the landlord not want to deal with youth.|`|RZzMse3Haa	Age is not a legally protected class.

Your other friend having all those parties did not help this matter any.|`|AA11513482	no|`|VjgqZetcaa	Yes, of course it's discrimination, but there is absolutely no law that protects young people, so it's not illegal discrimination.  In fact, the landlord was under no obligation to give any reason for the denial. Now, if a person over 40 were to apply for a job, or be dismissed from a job, because of "being old", that would be the basis for a claim under the ADEA.|`|suWnr83laa	Yes, it is age discrimination, and it is illegal.<br>  Edit: After getting a thumbs down from someone I checked and it seems this is state specific. I am in Illinois and it is illegal based on state law, not federal. I advise checking the laws for the state that you are in.|`|qmIdZeSCaa	*If* I Had to guess I would say there is more to this than your friend is telling you.<br>  My math says that if your friend is only 18.5 years old she has only been able to sign a contract for six months. In this six months she has already had an apartment and living with a friend and looking for another apartment. Thats not exactly a stellar rental record and most landlords make you sign a year contract. If she broke that contract I wouldnt rent to her either. Even if she didnt break the contract would you care to rent out a place just to have someone move in for a few months and party and destroy it and then move out leaving you with 2000 bucks worth of repairs and cleanup all for a few months rent? Not to count the aggravation of renting it out again which means spending time on applicants and money on advertising. Short term renters just arent a good deal.<br>  I could be wrong on this but unless you got this "youre too young" thing in writing or recorded you are out of luck. Even then you are gonna need a lawyer who will probably not operate pro se on a case of this nature so its gonna take some bucks.<br>  On a brighter note if your friend really has her heart set on this place I bet they would change their mind if she walked in with 6 months rent up front... if she doesnt have 6 months up front maybe she could take a personal loan or something to get it... sure she would pay a bit of interest but it will get her where she wants to be and set her off on the right foot for future rentals if she treats it right.

EI premiums and union dues are not.|`|nYnZr8AMaa	You have not provided enough information to answer that question.  However, working backwards from the EI premiums that were deducted (and assuming that your employer withheld the correct amount) then you must have earned approximately $6,383 from employment.  If this is your only source of income for the year then you should get the full $99.08 income tax refunded back to you.  The EI is not refundable.
r9nxFkGtaa	A savings bond is like a savings account - but not held at a bank.  You buy the bond certificate from the issuer (could be a government, a company, or a bank) and it has an interest rate on it.  Generally there is also a time period attached to the bond, such as 5 years.  This means that you can't cash it in until it "matures" at the end of the period.  So if you buy a $100 savings bond that has a 5 year compounded interest rate of 5%, after a year that bond will be worth $105, after 2 years $110.25, $115.76, after 3 years $121.55, after 4 years $127.63, and at maturity $134.01, when you can cash it in.|`|RuQ1MOsQaa	Say your grandparents purchased you a 100 savings bond, depending on the terms it may have only cost say 50 dollars but takes 20 years to mature.

You will likely find work there if you are presentable. If not, try other retail locations including the fast food industry.<br>  <br>  If you have an area of interest, for example, if you like fixing up cars, you might try looking for a cashier job at a gas station where they do auto repair. If you find the law fascinating, you might find a filing job at a law office. Be creative, and don't wait until the potential employer runs an ad in the newspaper. Better to get to them first.

The time on the film will match the time of the withdrawal.  And using your card right afterward will just make it easier for them to nail you.<br>  The right thing to do would be to bring the money back to the bank.

Next time you find a card in there take it and come back later with a mask and take the money out you wont get caught ^_^ stay strong man hope it works out for ya don't listin to these other assholes|`|RVgQddmfaa	Do the right thing.  I know it's tempting to take the money but now you need to correct the wrong b/c it is the right thing to do.  Call the bank and tell them your story.  They can tell whose card it was and give it back to the right person.|`|CECOoaRXaa	sorry, but that's bogus. if it was "only" 400 dollars than why don't you have that kind of money. they will catch you and you will get charged and prosecuted. <br>  <br>  You may have overdrawn their account. think about that? probably not.|`|VsaEOX9vaa	Doesn't ring true. <br>  <br>  You can't access someone's account without knowing the PIN, even in Australia.<br>  <br>  Sounds like a madeup story!|`|8i46CxZ0aa	You are a criminal now.

They really only want the money back.  In the future, remove the card and return it to the bank.  Remember, maybe someone really needs that money.|`|eS7iQCziaa	First, I am sure you know now, next time, leave it alone. There is nothing that you could do at this point unless you still had the card. You might want to just hold on to the money for a couple of days, maybe weeks and if nobody contacts you. Might as well spend it.|`|t3vFy9R8aa	Go to the bank and return the money along with the card! Tell them you weren't thinking straight when you did the crime and that you are very sorry. And the next time, please think before you act!

I heard they need a super computer to do them.|`|u93oneUXaa	Actually, there is no apostrophe in Gates.<br>  <br>  And no - you don't take his income and subtract 35% for federal taxes. There is a threshold for everyone's income on how much taxes they pay. For example if you are MFJ  and your income is $208,850 - $372,950 you pay $46,742 + 33%over the $208,850. It's not as simple as to just take 35% off of income.|`|RuQ1MOsQaa	well seeing as if you make more then 250,000 you are in the 35% tax bracket and their trying to raise it to 39 something % my answer would be that.

That's valuable feedback information-your agent can find out if the home showed well, any positive ideas, any negatives that could be corrected, and what the reaction to the pricing was. The agent also can follow up with the buyers to close the sale. It's also a good litmus test of the market-if you are getting many showings and no offers, your agent needs to know that-adjustments need to be made.
MbzyriZ4aa	Yes... the merchant fee on a debit transaction is by far less than a Credit Transaction.<br>  Which is why banks want you to use the Credit feature of your ATM card... because it doesn't matter whether it was real credit or the credit feature of your ATM check card the fee is the same.<br>  <br>  The merchant fees vary from carrier to carrier. You can be charged as much as 2% of the purchase price as a separate fee billed to you by VISA, etc. Some are even higher... ever wondered why so many merchants stopped accepting American Express? Because their fees got so outrageous that we just plain refused to take it anymore.
Uc7GM2Rnaa	I think you have a VERY valid point.  But it is probably less about polution than about the food we eat.

Locally grown, and baked goods, fruit and veggies that were "in season" and not genetically improved to be available all year long.<br>  <br>  Drug companies produce drugs that mask or alleviate symptons, rarely ever curing the problem.  There is no money in cures.  Only in continued use of symptom mitigating pills.   The side effects are always worse than anything the pills can cure.  Cholesterol is the biggest lie of them all.<br>  <br>  The other day I heard an ad for a pill that will "cure" a rash, one of the side effects...  possible stroke...    HELLO?

Pjm9pg7iaa	That "sale" was the foreclosure auction. That was the minimum bid to buy the house for the bank. A buyer at that auction had to pay cash; no loans, so it sold for a lower price. <br>  The seller will now let you get a loan and take 30 days to pay..|`|UXQ22qeVaa	the same bank bought it back on an auction and dropped the price to sale it for less to minimize loss|`|MbzyriZ4aa	Probably just wishful thinking... they anticipate that you will give them a lower offer and to counteract they add $20K to the price so that when you offer them $20K less they actually get what they need.<br>  <br>  <br>  The other possibility is that whoever bought the house last actually made some reasonable improvements and these repairs and/or upgrades actually did raise the value by 20K.<br>  They could have bought the house with a ripped out kitchen, repaired the damage and put the kitchen back together and are now ready to sell it.

h8l1H4N4aa	The only houses you can look at for yourself are the ones where the owner is selling it himself. (and those are usually overpriced.)  And even then, you need to call the phone number given in order to make an appointment.  You can't just knock on their door.  Same goes for a house being sold thru a realtor.  The owners have a realtor to help screen potential buyers and make the appointments and supervise while the buyers look around.  If the house is unoccupied, and locked with a lockbox, the only people allowed in (because they have the lockbox key) are the owner's agent or the buyer's agent with their clients.<br>  <br>  Trying to look at houses yourself could actually be more time consuming.  Your agent knows your requirements and price range, so they narrow your choices down to the ones you'd like and can afford.  If you do see a nice house when your driving around, but it's being sold thru a different realtor than your realtor, you have every right to ask your agent to make arrangements for you to see it.  Some agents don't tell you this;  they'll only show you houses that they have listed.  (They'd rather keep the whole commission, rather than split it with another agent.)  Most agencies inform you of this, so if yours didn't......    <br>  <br>  Weekends are the busiest time for realtors.  If you want to be shown more houses in one day, you need to take a weekday off from work.  You'll get a lot more done.  Give your agent a certain weekday that you'll be available.  For instance, tell them on Friday, that you'll take off next Thursday.  This will give him/her enough time to make all the necessary phone calls and appointments.|`|suWnr83laa	Get an agent to represent you. Get references. Get someone who does it full time, not part time.  Add an addedum to your buyers agent representation agreement spelling out the terms you expect.  For example that you have the right to terminate the contract and that will nullify the contingency period of the contract if you have placed a call to both the agent and her managing broker and no call is returned within 24 hours. In this market there is no excuse for lazy agents. There are a lot of bad ones out there but there are a lot of good ones too. I loved my buyer's agent when I bought my house. She would have slept on the floor with me overnight in a house I was considering if I asked her to!|`|qmIdZeSCaa	You CAN, you wont have anyone on your side though.

Do you call the landlord?  You can't.. YOU'RE the landlord.   <br>  <br>  Seriously.. you still need money to move into a house... you have none.<br>  <br>  Foreclosure court dockets are full of people who had poor credit and no money.  Save yourself the hassle and learn to save, bring up your credit.  All you have to do is save 5% and you might be able to buy and afford something..<br>  <br>  yeah yeah yeah... you're going to hear from 100's of mtg brokers who say FHA FHA FHA.. gift of down payments, seller to carry closing costs, yadda yadda yadda.<br>  <br>  I'm a mtg brker and I've seen this before... it doesn't end well.|`|uRqlSq6caa	You are out of luck guess how we got into this financial crisis we are currently in...you guessed it people with no money buying homes they couldn't afford.  You need to start saving money for a downpayment.  Renting is cheaper than owning a home, there is more to a cost of a home than just the mortgage ie insurance, property taxes, maintence, upkeep, etc.

fFnsJ7maaa	If the Director isn't a major shareholder, he/she is an Independent Director. A major shareholder is one who owns 5% or more of the stock (SEC rule). Directors don't have to own stock. They are often required to own stock or are compensated with stock or stock options so that they are also owners. <br>  <br>  The number of shares varies by company, so it is expressed as a percentage. Shares of bank stocks also vary (particulary this month, they've taken big hits.) <br>  <br>  Example: Bank of America is $5.32 today. Its 52 week high was $43.46. There are 6.39 Billion shares. A major stockholder needs to own 319.5 Million shares, or $1.7 Billion worth. <br>  <br>  People's United (People's Bank in CT) is $17.20 today. Its 52 week high was 21.76. There are 347.9 Million shares. A major stockholder needs to own 17.4 Million shares, or $299.2 Million worth. <br>  <br>  Which would you rather own?|`|yaq7oaH6aa	This information must be disclosed in any offering statement, <br>  and can be found on any financial site for a listed security.<br>  They must disclose all shares owned and options held.<br>  'Major Shareholder' will be a percentage based on how widely <br>  the stock is held. it might be as little as 10%.
4UBxVIYFaa	There will be problems.  First off, the lender will not agree to a short sale to a close relative.  They have been screwed over by folks attempting this sort of thing before.<br>  <br>  Second, you won't qualify for the $8000 first time home buyer credit either.  The SAME restrictions are in that bill.  If you buy from a close relative, you will not qualify for the credit.|`|Pjm9pg7iaa	It is slightly possible. The law says that the  sale must be "arms length" which would eliminate you.  FHA feels like you could help your parents today by giving them some help with the mortgage payments..
Ikd9cppcaa	The inventor would have to have the product copyrighted and service marked. Otherwise, if it isn't someone else will do so and the product will no longer be his idea. Make sure all of this has been done and then the inventor should market his product to a major manufacturer especially a dryer company or even a Home Depot. This is not something you would sell to friends or door to door.
2N6oTOLQaa	I think its a good viable business if you know what you are doing. <br>  <br>  I suggest you form an LLC and carry a liability insurance policy to protect yourself against lawsuits. Unfortunately this world is full of dishonest people who might sue you even if you have done nothing wrong. I know of someone who used to fix computers for other people as a side job. He didn't charge much, it was mostly as a favor to friends, family, coworkers etc, but he asked for a few bucks for his time. He ran into one dishonest person who had him fix a computer, then the guy claimed that he had lost everything on the hard drive and damaged the computer beyond repair. The guy threatened to sue and tried to bully him into giving him a cash settlement.<br>  <br>  If you form an LLC it protects your personal assets against any lawsuits that might occur. Customers can only sue the company, but they can't come take money out of your personal bank account for a lawsuit, so the worst thing they could do is shut down your company. You can always form another company with a new business license if that happens. Plus, a blanket liability insurance policy would offer tons of protection and cost only a few hundred dollars per year at the most.|`|Ikd9cppcaa	There is much more involved than knowing how to build computers and making a small profit. Get a job working for another small company doing this same thing. You would have to pay all kinds of taxes quarterly as well as put together the LLC papers and get insurance. It would be difficult getting customers when you are 16. A better idea would be for you to be Dr. Computer. People have all kinds of problems with viruses or have screwed up something or just don't know how to use their computers. You could make a housecall providing you know the area or have a parent come with you.|`|D6qa0yC3aa	Get some education on runnig a Business.  There is alot more Business stuff than you think.

LpVwWJVsaa	It depends on your city, how long it will take to move the items and how many people you hire to do the moving.  I manage an apartment community and I used a moving company when I moved from one city to another (60 miles or so) I was really happy with their service so I started referring my residents to them based on personal experience.  Since I have referred people and had the management company's other communities use them, I have gotten residents who drop my name a discounted rate on their services($80/hr vs. $120 for two guys, the truck and no additional mileage).  It's kind of handy and I would definitely use them again when I move.<br>  <br>  The previous posters are correct though, it's always going to be cheaper to get friends, pizza and beer when you're moving.  The only downfall is that if your stuff gets dropped by them, you're outta luck, with movers some carry insurance against stuff like that.|`|AA11206283	Probably going to run close to a grand.<br>  <br>  U-Haul, friends, beer, pizza.<br>  <br>  200 bucks|`|AA11173563	depends on what they have to move.

NcFWcO3Laa	If you are 50/50 partners there is not much you can do.  If things have gotten that bad between you and your brother it might be time to sell the property.  If your brother is not agreeable to sell the property you might consider filing a "partition" lawsuit where a judge forces the sale and the money is split between you.|`|yaq7oaH6aa	It's not legal for him to do so over your objection, <br>  but do really you want to take a brother to court?<br>  The outcome would be to force a sale, (in the current <br>  depressed market), and divide the proceeds.<br>  (Plus there would be a p*ssed *ff gang to deal with.)<br>  If you can't talk him out of it, can you suggest that the <br>  gang pay a fair rent?<br>  After all, you're 'family' and being damaged.<br>  They should feel the obligation if its put right.|`|UXQ22qeVaa	he should pay you half of the rent.
Rrpb5aLMaa	Ok if you are shopping around for a mortgage run your credit first (freeannualcreditreport.com), fix any problems you find, and maybe buy the credit repair bible worked wonders for me. Now every company will run your credit separately but they can give you a ball park quote if you know your credit score from the first place. It wont hurt your credit though as long as you get all of the inquiry's within a 14day period some say, 30day period others say. But at any rate if it is done within the correct time line then it will only count as one. <br>  Hope this helps|`|o4eLrioNaa	If you are new to the world of loans, then all the jargon and terminology can seem very confusing. There are so many different terms to understand, and unless you know some of them you will not find the best loan deal to suit your needs.

Credit scoring is a method that lenders use to determine your eligibility for a loan. They ask a series of questions about your earnings and financial situation. Each answer you give is scored, and the better your score then the more likely you are to be accepted for a loan.
MmTe8W8uaa	If they have a facility in California, whether it is their office, a warehouse, or anything else, then they MUST charge California sales tax on anything bought in California from them.  It would be illegal for them to refund it.  The only way to avoid paying the sales tax is to buy it in Texas and ship it to California yourself.  However, even if you did that, you would owe "use" tax to California, so you would not save any money.|`|9a881112567263b20d6262238853cc86aa	If they have any sort of office in California (Sales, Administration, Warehouse) they are required to collect California sales tax regardless of where the item is shipping from.
nYnZr8AMaa	Lets clear something up here, all employment income is taxable.  However, you may not end up owing any tax if your income is below a certain threshold known as the basic personal exemption which is currently between $9,000 and $10,000 depending on which province you live in.  <br>  <br>  You should report all of your income on your tax return.  Failure to do so can result in penalties and possibly criminal charges.|`|y7Mwptsraa	You report all of your income, even if there was no tax withheld. If the total of the two T4's is greater than $9,600, it is possible that you may owe income tax. <br>  <br>  Whenever you get a T4, your employer is required to submit a copy to the Canada Revenue Agency. If you leave income off your return, they will pick up on the amount and adjust your return. If this happens, they can charge a penalty of 20% of the unreported amount, in addition to any income tax owing.|`|ykZtnI88aa	forex-<br>  <a href="http://tradingsolution.org/" rel="nofollow">http://tradingsolution.org/</a><br>  forex-<br>  <a href="http://tradingsolution.org/" rel="nofollow">http://tradingsolution.org/</a><br>  forex-<br>  <a href="http://tradingsolution.org/" rel="nofollow">http://tradingsolution.org/</a>

You can usually open a 529 account in any state you want, although if it is not your state of residence you won't get any extra state tax benefits if you invest in the 529 plan of another state.  As your child is 15 months, and as the markets have been so crushed, and as you're just starting, this is a great time to begin.  Find one you like, set up regular monthly contributions, and be happy that you're starting with the markets down 50% from their highs.  And go with something relatively aggressive.

Most of the time the lender includes your taxes in your mortgage payment because they are actually responsible for the taxes.|`|NY2fpmvPaa	If you are planning to try to keep your house and get it out of foreclosure, definitely try to pay your taxes at the very least if you can. That's just paying down the debt you owe a little more. Usually lender's include that cost into your loan, but sometimes they do not. If it's not included, continue to make those payments so that you are not further in debt!|`|fSlZQzS4aa	The house owes the tax not the owner.

Ikd9cppcaa	When I was a kid my parent's were contacted by Pixie Portraits at J.C. Penneys who wanted to put my picture in 20 ft. posters in every Pixie photo store in the country. My parents were thrilled and excited about how much money may be involved. Here's how it works. They will send you a check for $1 and a release form. That's it. There are lots of cute kids out there and if you don't want to do it, another person will. You don't ask for anything. They will tell you what they will pay and if you aren't happy with it, they will go on to the next cute kid. My other friend in high school was asked to be in a Burger King TV commercial. Same thing. She got a $1 check and a release form. That is just how it works. Sorry to be the one to give you the bad news.
J7MTowtkaa	It’s important not to sound canned and say that you “work too hard.”  Rather, share one example of a weakness and how you’ve learned from it and are working on overcoming the challenge.  An interviewer wants to hear that you are introspective and that you have a handle of what you are good at and what you are doing to work on those things that you don't think are that good.  It's not as much of a weakness if you have a gameplan on how you are addressing it.  This article below highlights a number of these types of typical interviewing questions and how you can best answer them to impress.|`|IB2V5t1Oaa	If you don't want to say "a line", tell him/her that you don't have any..|`|897e7a393eaaa2e07450e638d086ce46aa	The best way to answer that question is to do it honestly, but without going into too much detail. For example, if I were to say that my biggest weakness was that I get distracted easily I would say that "I like to jump from project to project and that sometimes means that some projects get more attention than others".|`|H6bLAvyuaa	The best way to answer "what is your greatest weakness" question is to use the sandwich technique.

I give examples of minor problems I have had in the past with listening to subordinates, and the communication problems that arise.  I let them know that I am well aware of this tendency of mine.  I tie it all together by telling them how important communication is to me.  Without good communication at work, every operation will be doomed to failure.  With great communication and teamwork, anything is possible.|`|nI2Cj5mpaa	I usually say I have a tough time delegating work. The last thing you want is to dwell on a weakness.

The relative who passed away left it to him, not to you. Let him take it and do what he wants with it. If he does something you consider foolish, maybe he'll learn from his mistake.<br>  <br>  What do your parents think about this situation? If anyone is going to withhold his money from him, it should be a parent, not a sibling.|`|YbwDFvEaaa	If you ARE his legal guardian, then all you have to do is endorse the check with your own signature. Under your signature, you print your brother's name and write "minor" next to it. Since he is underage, he can not endorse his own checks, and so the signature of his legal guardian must be used. And yes, the money can be deposited into your own account, but since the funds are meant for him I recommend putting it elsewhere.<br>  <br>  If you want to open an account for him separately with the money, you can open up a basic transfer to minor savings account at your local bank. This means that the account is technically in your name, but with the intention of transferring the funds to your brother when he is of age.<br>  <br>  If you don't want the money to be used at all for a few months or years, then you may want to consider a certificate of deposit or another product that will have higher interest than a basic savings account. This way your younger brother will earn as much as he can with the money while it is secured away in the account.<br>  <br>  All this being said, if you're not his legal guardian, then there's nothing you can do with the money. His legal guardian should be taking the above actions.<br>  <br>  Good luck!|`|kQA7SbY9aa	Only his legal guardian has the right to hold his check. Don't attempt to deposit in your personal account.

(I still have a savings account at a credit union that I opened when I was 13, and it still has my dad listed as a joint tenant.  I'm 40 now.)|`|QaEeITduaa	Are you your brother's guardian? If not, who is? You don't have a right to cash your brother's check or to not tell him about the money he inherited.

2uGEhpWhaa	I would think that unless you found someone to take your place for the month of March, you could be responsible for that month of rent, since she is losing out on that income   But i think that is only enforceable if you have a written agreement.  If you were out by the end of Feb. that would be one thing, but technically,  that's not giving her 30 days notice, and since you are staying through the first week, I think it's fair to prorate the rent.  Being your friend, it's suprising that she's asking you to pay for the entire month.  I could see your friend acting this way if she was expecting you to stay through March and if by leaving early you were putting her in some sort of a financial situation and she really needed the money, but she should have made that clear.  She should have let you know if she was expecting March rent as soon as you told her you would be out by the end of Feb..  Seems a little underhanded that she pulled that on you at the last minute.  Bottom line,  I think you owe her for at least part of March.|`|RZzMse3Haa	Irregardless of who gave the notice you are required to pay full rent thru the end of that notice.

Although since she asked you to move out I would say that you shouldnt have to give anything past the date that you are there if she is any kind of friend or wants to continue that friendship.|`|yIDvd8nFaa	Just pay it and stay till the end of March, then everyone will be happy.|`|0b4c93bbeb71c27f7f5c6e0c009bc154aa	I assume there is no written agreement between you and your friend.<br>  The problem I have with the other answers that say you automatically owe to March 31st, are not taking into account the fact that SHE gave you notice to vacate.  You did not initiate the termination of occupancy.<br>  <br>  Most states require a 60 day notice, but sounds like she was trying to round it to an end of month date. <br>  If you stuck to your statement of being out by Feb. 1st, I would say you are not obligated to pay any of March rent.  However, when you postponed your vacancy into March, then she by rights can say that it was impossible for her to bring another tenant in, until you moved out - therefore making you responsible for March's rent.<br>  <br>  Of course the ethical remedy would be to prorate the days you stayed there, but it really depends on if you had a written agreement.|`|35hviVqFaa	I think that you shouldn't have to pay, it's just not right. You are only staying an extra week, not a month. She just has to deal with no rent from you for a month because that is just ridicules.
57jBwPrZaa	You need to be a Forensics Pathologist which is an M.D. You need to go to medical school and become a doctor and specialize in forensics.|`|Sozc3MyFaa	IF it is a small county, the ELECTED (or could be appointed) Coroner can be someone with good experience in medicine & criminal law, criminalistics etc.  The medical cases are subcontracted out to a pathologist.  The Coroner rules on the manner of say death in a coroners inquest (natural v at another's hands etc).  In larger counties, the coroner is also a MEDICAL EXAMINER (and is appointed) which is a MD (medical doctor) with a residency in pathology, fellowship in forensics & extensive supplementary education in criminalistics, law, etc.  So you would have to go to med school to start.<br>  <br>  Once you find a job in the criminal justice system, you will be exposed to other career possibilities.  You might consider criminalistics (crime lab/scene investigator) if you decide that appeals.

Report him to ebay, you can get your money back from paypal. If you don't have paypal then report the seller to ebay and tell him you want your money back....<br>  4. Don't mail his item until the item has been cleared. Don't mail it if the transaction is still pending.|`|735a1fad9c8148cb945ff4708a253a00aa	If you use Pay Pal, he has to pay if you send the item. Pay Pal and Ebay have features that help you mail so that it the package is tracked. You are paid and the buyer is assured of getting what he paid for.  As to Feedback, that depends on your description and how the purchaser feels about the item.|`|g2R7e2eVaa	Dont send the item until you cashed the check or money order. Dont give up anything until you have the green in your hand.

I sell baby clothes and I would never send material to someone unless they paid first or used Paypal to pay for it. I have been a member with Ebay way before they had to have a valid credit card on file. I love ebay. I used to have feelings like U but you have too just get online sell it and send your emails to the sellers like I do and just wait until they pay. I usually give ebay buyers 15 days to pay me for the merchandise and if they dont I usually leave bad feedback.

I would suggest you visiting their website and or calling their customer service line.|`|UJAKJx3xaa	i` have MADE TRANSACTIONS with e-bay +pay pal  for 4 years never had a problem  p/s.  be careful of the seller.|`|9kuCwhiWaa	First, list your items with Auctivia dot com which would lower your listing fees.  Please select ebay checkout and not auctivia, it's NOT bad but some ebay users feel uneasy using a non ebay checkout.  <br>  <br>  When an item sells you would have to pay the paypal fee as well.  You diposit that money as a withdraw to your bank account.  I'm assuming your checking account and everything is set up with paypal?<br>  <br>  You DO NOT sent items until you are paid first.  and you put that money straight in to your account.  for money orders and checks, you wait until it clears, contact your bank for wait time.<br>  <br>  When you send it ONLY send it to the vertified address with paypal not a 3rd party address.  Use delivery confermation as proof of send.  If not use the other tracking methods.  <br>  <br>  As a buyer.  do not pay by money order cause nobody is gonna help you.  Checks are the same.  Best to use paypal, VIA CREDIT CARD.  You have 3 months (on average) to initiate a chargeback if item does not arrive.|`|f36cf4a02d36fc7032a8d44aa4288f35aa	1. state in your description that item will be shipped after payment has been received. <br>  2. He cannot take his money back through paypal   has never happened to me in 6 year of ebaying<br>  3. Never happened to me either.  You can dispute it.  Check their feedback before you bid and you will be fine.<br>  4. He cannot cancel the pay. He would have to prove that you did something wrong.  I always buy delivery confirmation.  It is around 60 cents.  You can track you package online www.usps.com   Other shipping methods also have ways of tracking.  <br>  <br>  Paypal is very secure.  If something does happen, you can dispute it through ebay.  They will take a look at all of the communication between you and the buyer/seller.  You will be able to write a complaint of a response to the buyer/seller complaint. Ebay will make the final decision.  Keep your reciepts.  Delivery confirmation is good for this.  You can e-mail them the delivery confirmation # so they are able to track their item as well. <br>  <br>  I love ebay.  It is so easy.  Never been screwed.  If their feed back is good and over 100 chances are you will be fine working with them <br>  <br>  Good luck|`|l23ttRePaa	Well, I sell on ebay and you never ship an item until payment is received and be sure to require delivery confirmation on all wins. A lot of the people will not pay for insurance so therefore you have to have something to protect yourself with a proof of shipment. <br>  <br>  I always add an additional $0.75 to all of my descriptions and to the total invoice before sending and let all know that delivery confirmation is a requirement and protection for them and me as well. It has a number than you can track on the online USPS (UNITED STATES POSTAL SERVICE) site to see when it was shipped. It will give you the date and actual time that it was delivered and the address to where it went as well.<br>  <br>  Number 2 he cannot take his money back. For one thing you have to have a Pay pal account for payments to come into as ebay now only allows electronic funds and checks or money orders as payments are no longer allowed. So you have to have Pay pal and of course ebay owns it and takes a percentage of all that comes into it so you have to abide by their rules to be able to sell. I protect myself there again and state in my listings that I do not offer refunds and please address all issues and or questions before bidding.<br>  <br>  It you buy something you can almost be 100% sure that it will be mailed. I have purchased tons of items from ebay sellers and have never had one default in shipping one yet. They are all conscientious and are striving to keep an excellent reputation as you are left feedback by the buyers and they do not want to be rated negative. Plus always look at the feedback of the person you're buying from. It really speaks for itself.<br>  <br>  Again, you do not mail or ship out anything to anyone until your payment for the item that they won comes into your paypal acct. and paypal will notify you VIA email as soon as that happens.<br>  <br>  If a person should happen to not pay, they have a claim that you fill out and it's a non payer complaint. They will most likely finish the transaction in a friendly manner in most cases.<br>  <br>  Paypal has refund features if a person says they purchased something and it was not as described in the auction listing. Then paypal reviews it and will refund their or your money whichever the case may be.<br>  <br>  As for describing your items be sure to do it thoroughly and correctly. Check into Auctiva.com which is a free site for backgrounds descriptions and so forth. You can type it into any seach engine. I believe ebay owns that but not certain. There is no charge for it. <br>  <br>  Well, you'll find out more and more as you get started and feedback is very important whether you care about it or not. You need to keep it very good. I have 100% and most sellers try to keep theirs at that percentage. There's always one that may give you a nasty feedback for no reason or they have buyers remorse and really didn't want the item they won in the first place.<br>  <br>  So, good luck and hope this helps somewhat...<br>  <br>  Have a great evening...
Pjm9pg7iaa	You lose the credit check money. You get all the rest back. You are not obligated until you sign the lease. The reason is that you don't know what you have agreed to until you sign the lease. At the last minute the landlord could add "you have to let the landlord's mom live with you" and you would have the right to refuse. Get your money..|`|RZzMse3Haa	depends - when you fail to take a place you agreed on, you typically lose your deposit.  That is pretty standard.<br>  <br>  Now the deciding factor here is if they called it rent or deposit.  If they called it rent then you should get that back. If they called it a deposit equal to 1 month rent (also standard) then you don't.<br>  <br>  EDIT: The other answer made a good point. I think you are just confused on the terminology, and actually only signed the rental application.  But if you did sign a rental agreement, then that IS a lease and it is legally binding the second you sign it even if you never move in.<br>  <br>  EDIT:  Again - that depends on what they called it.   You have to check with them.|`|vCePK8gMaa	You state, "On 2/21/09 my boyfriend and i signed a rental agreement in chicago and paid for 1st month's rent and credit checks for the two of us."<br>  <br>  <br>  A rental agreement is a lease. Your roommate is not liable for anything since he never signed anything.<br>  <br>  You and your boyfriend are bound to the rental agreement that was signed.<br>  <br>  You have little to no chance of getting any money back. In fact, if the rental agreement you signed was for a fixed term, expect to have to keep paying.

3m6XHotKaa	@Rusty: People not being able to read Chinese cannot use the local Hong Kong Yahoo... Therefor alot of people ask their related questions here (in English). <br>  <br>  To try to shed some light on this question:<br>  <br>  First of all I think it depends alot on the live style and there is the problem because Hong Kong is a place of a HUGE varieties of life styles.<br>  Also it depends on the weather - when its warm u spend ALOT of electricity on air condition. The bigger your apartment the more you spend naturally. So it is not possible to really answer that question without knowing the purpose of your question.<br>  <br>  I can however tell you that I (western) am living in a mid sized apartment with my wife. We are usually only home at night (as are many people in HK) because we work at day time (duh :) ) and during weekends we would be out. <br>  <br>  In Spring/Winter when we do not need air condition bills average around HK$150 a month. During the hot season though it can be as high as HK$1000 a month. Air conditioning really eats up alot of energy :)|`|y4SUDnpaaa	To get an accurate answer why don't you ask this question in the section of Y/A especially for Hong Kong?

LpVwWJVsaa	Ouch!  I don't blame you at all for moving out.  It sounds as though they took advantage of your friendship.<br>  <br>  I would google your landlord/tenant rights and responsibilities for your state.  In my experience, most states have some kind of landlord/tenant handbook that is available to both LL and residents.  IT will spell out exactly what rights and responsibilities that you both have and how to go about getting this issue resolved.  I do believe, and I could be wrong, but it is required that there is a move in inspection form given to residents at the time of move in.  I haven't seen a state yet where it's not required.<br>  <br>  Good luck to you|`|vCePK8gMaa	Unless your state's landlord tenant laws require a move in inspection form, then it os not required. <br>  <br>  The fact is, the landlord can withhold your deposit for damages or unpaid rent.<br>  <br>  If you disagree with the deductions, you must send a dispute and demand letter. If the landlord does not return the disputed amount per your demand, you then file in Small Claims court and sue the landlord.<br>  <br>  Each of you bring your evidence and the judge will decide the matter.

Maybe the position contributes to your career goals because you wish your career will focus on a detail orientated and research based environment; or because you wish to succeed in an organisational or PA role. Perhaps you were thinking of training as a career and this particular university has certain attributes such as a strong specialty in the courses or skills you are interested in, eg. management etc etc. <br>  <br>  Your sentences are good for your professional goals.

Depending on the bank, you can sometimes see your deposits at 10 PM the nite before payday, or sometimes not til 2 or 3 am.  Also, if your bank's online banking system doesn't talk to the core processor's software, your online banking can be a day or 2 behind.  Basically I wouldn't worry about it unless it's not there when you wake up tomorrow.  If that happens, check with your bank to verify the routing and account number are correct.  Some banks have different routing number for different purposes.  Once you make sure your info is correct, have your employer make sure they entered it correctly and used the right account type.  If they chose 'checking' and it's a 'savings' it won't post to your account and your bank will reject it.  Then it takes several days to get your deposit back.

ytGaDM7Haa	The best advice I can give is to try to rent only to someone who you feel you can communicate to easily and openly (I know that's hard to tell at first). There is nothing worse than two (or more) people who have issues with each other but can't bring them up. It's always hard, but being passive aggressive just isn't good enough. It might seem like a good idea to rent to someone who is quiet and independent and keeps to themselves, but if you're like that too, it could be problematic.
suWnr83laa	First, make sure you can even get a loan. At 18 you may not have enough credit history to get one without a cosigner.  Also call around to a couple of insurance agencies and get insurance quotes. They vary greatly depending on what area of the country you are in and how far you drive to work and stuff. I think it is great that you are considering everything before purchasing - very responsible of you.
Ikd9cppcaa	You need to talk with a lawyer. If your home is in an association and dues are owed on it, you have already agreed to the dues by paying the past due invoice. Show the lawyer the paperwork and find out your rights. You don't want to get some huge invoice with penalties or have some lien put on the property. Most times those homeowners associations do much more with the money than the dumpster. Sometimes they work to keep major roads from the area, or a strip club, or make sure no one in the neighborhood paints their home purple and ruins the value of surrounding homes. Go talk to a lawyer.|`|3Ze4nR9Caa	I'm sorry, but something about this story is not adding up...<br>  <br>  Did you receive the CC&R's with the other reports given to you by the seller when you bought your home?  Why weren't the past due HOA fees paid by the seller when they sold the house?  Why didn't your agent tell you about the dues (they should have known even if they other agent didn't tell them)?  Why would your HOA let you get away with not paying dues for 7 years?!  Have you contacted the agent that represented you to see what they have to say about all of this?<br>  <br>  If you were truly not made aware of any of this information while you were purchasing the house, you certainly have a strong case against your agent, the other agent and the seller.  They are the ones you really have the problem with - not the HOA (your HOA is acutally not at fault at all here).  You seem to be laughing at this situation, but it can be a pretty serious matter.  You don't mention where you live, but in California (where I live), an HOA can put a lein on your property for unpaid dues - you could lose your house to them over this.<br>  <br>  The first thing you need to do is contact your HOA and let them know why you haven't been paying.  They probably don't have a clue about any of this, expecially since you were paying them at first without any questions or complaints.  The next thing you need to do is contact a lawyer.  They can probably get the other parties involved to compensate you for part of the past dues, especially because they were negligent (if they did not disclosue any of the HOA information to you as you say).  <br>  <br>  Btw, perhaps if your HOA had been receiving your dues for the past 7 years, they would have been able to afford more for the community than just the annual dumpster.|`|r9nxFkGtaa	The rules are a little different in every jurisdiction.  Where I live, in this situation, you would be responsible for the dues as it is a charge to the home-owner (you).  However, you could sue the previous home-owner for non-disclosure regarding the dues and they could be forced to re-imburse you for them.  So, yes you have to pay.|`|AjPbtm7oaa	It doesn't matter what they're used for. If dues are in the restrictive covenants which govern your property you are obligated to pay them. If you don't the association can put a lien on your property.
gkqmrIAGaa	God forgives, he listened to you and heard you. If you are sorry God forgives you. There is something that I like to read in times of trouble.(Romans 12:2)  Do not change yourselves to be like the people of this world but be changed withing by a new way of thinking. Then you will be able to decide what God wants for you: you will know what is good and pleasing to him and what is perfect.<br>  <br>  If you had to make a choice between God's time and your time, which would you choose?  I thought so. So rest in the Lord.  Don't think you can handle everything on your own.  Don't let the tension and tumult of present day living distract you from waiting on God's perfect timing.<br>  <br>  God will see to it that all you really need, you can have.  But it has been said that the mills of the gods grind slowly.  Picture a great wheel dipping into the stream of history, a great wheel that keeps rolling with a slow and certain motion.  Think of this slow and certain motion.  Think of this slow and certain wheel as God's wheel.  It never makes mistakes; it is unerring. It's slow, sure movement will grind out justice.  God doesn't always win in  a hurry, but he always wins.<br>  <br>  Never talk defeat, for if  you do you can talk yourself into into accepting it.  Do not hug the shore; do not fear high places. Think high and wide and deep and far. Mohammed said, God is with those who persevere," and Shakespheare observed that "much rain wears the marble. " you can think you can if you think you can.  What power lies within those words and in you and truly believe them.  Let your faith rise up as an eagle in the sky; believe in your dreams, believe God wants you to have it. Think high and wide and deep and far, and God will lead you to your dream.<br>  <br>  This dream your job maybe what isn't what was meant for you but it will be there, just believe and have faith. God is not concerned about our wanting a home that is comfortable you were not being materialistic. You were just surviving in the way you knew how.  Please take these words and forgive yourself as you have already been forgiven.  You must just move on to whatever good is waiting for you. I am not writing for points I want only for you to believe this in your heart and know that it will be alright. You are a good and decent person and God knows.|`|2LAKDPc7aa	You should have posted this in Religion and Spirituality for you may have recieved more answers. <br>  <br>  Why are you depressed? You have GOD on your side, He is walking with you every day of your life! He has overcome the world, He is more powerful than anything on this earth, He is for YOU! Therefore, you have no reason to be depressed, my friend.<br>  <br>  You wrote: "Has anyone ever made mistakes"? <br>  <br>  Brother, Read: Judges 11:29-40<br>  <br>  [Jephthah] promised the Lord, "If you will let me defeat the Ammonites and come home safely, I will sacrifice to you whoever comes out to meet me first." (vv. 30-31, cev) <br>  <br>  I make so many mistakes that I actually find it rather embarassing...But God has shown me that you cannot GROW if you do not learn from your mistakes. Being human and living in a fallen world of sin, it is inevitable to go about life without making mistakes. We cannot grow if we do not make mistakes, for we need to acknowledge them and learn from them. I think that you are expiriencing a spiritual growth spurt. (did I spell "expirience" right?)<br>  Well, everyone makes mistakes, including people mentioned in the "Faith Hall of Fame." Jephthah made a foolish promise that if the Lord would help him defeat the Ammonites, he would sacrifice whoever came out of his house first to meet him upon his return. After the victory, his daughter came out and greeted him. Jephthah's heart sank and he realized that his vow was a huge mistake. What happened to his only child? Some commentators feel that he actually sacrificed her, while others believe that he merely forced her to remain unmarried and childless.<br>  <br>  Regardless of this poor girl's fate, Jephthah's story points out that even if we make mistakes, God can still call us people of faith. When we are lost in our sins, Jesus comes to forgive and give us a new start.<br>  <br>  Prayer: Lord, thank you for forgiving our sins and renewing our faith.<br>  <br>  God Bless You.|`|ujIinLzGaa	Of course I have made mistakes, and so has everyone else.  That is one of the ways we learn better ways of doing things.  All any of us can do is keep trying to be a little bit better person today than we were yesterday.  You'll get through this, with God's help.

Go to a community college, get the boring courses over with and believe me they are so boring. But its what is necessary for most good jobs. <br>  <br>  I'm 26 and back in college. I think its unfair to ask 18 and 19 year olds what major to choose for the rest of their life. You're just young and the world is fresh and it feels too overwhelming and stressful to pick something for the rest of your life. That's a lot of pressure and a lot of people end up failing.<br>  <br>  But a lot of people end up going back once they do figure it out. If you do go back to community college, transfer to a state university, its cheaper and if you want submit an one letter page of why you did so badly at first and what made you turn your life around. Once they see that you did better the 2nd time around and that you're serious they will admit you.<br>  <br>  Universities are  used to seeing a lot of students drop out their freshman and sophomore years and go back later on when they're more serious. You are not the only one. As for paying for college, you can apply for financial aid, your college should tell you how to go about doing that. But you can get grants that don't need to be paid back and do work-study.<br>  <br>  Btw, try graphic design.

That was very much the point, by the way.<br>  <br>  Houses in the burbs are larger, because the land used to be cheaper.  No other reason.

Adjusted for inflation, the real cost of things, especially homes, has skyrocketed.  It is very much the reason why almost all families have to be two income families instead of one.

54ee904ce0957cabc081644147eab797aa	For my initial interview with Geico, I had to complete a fairly simple computer test first. This was easy for me as I spend way too much time on my laptop.  After that I had a conversation with a manager, which only lasted a few minutes.  The questions themselves were pretty standard (ie.why do you want to work here, what do you expect to get out of the job, where do you see yourself in x amount of years).  The company culture at Geico revolves around the team, so emphasize the fact that you're a team player, work well in groups, etc.<br>  <br>  The next phase of the interview is what most applicants find difficult.  You are placed in a room with a piece of paper (listing "types" of clients you could face, as well as products) and a telephone, and the manager goes into an adjoining room, calls you on the phone, and poses to be the people on the paper.  Additionally, you have to sell the listed products, and resolve any problems/issues the customer may have.  It may difficult to take this part of the interview seriously, and many applicants may feel an enormous amount of pressure if they don't have much sales/customer service experience, and/or if the interviewing manager is acting like a client that is really hard to please.<br>  <br>  Aside from the interview, Geico itself is not a great company to work for.  I know with the state of the economy, any job is a good job, but you should take a serious look at Geico's turnover rates.  When I was there, the sales department had turnover rates as high as 50%.  Sure, Geico treats their customers like gold, but they treat their employees like the exact opposite.  The training at Geico was good, but after I acquired my insurance license, I was treated like garbage.  I'm not the only one who experienced this - let the turnover rate speak for itself.|`|d305138b3a4d89bb9a20a75933040915aa	Insurance companies are all basically the same. They herd them in, and herd them out. They interview countless classes of potentials weekly, and watch as 98-99% of them do not make it. Selling insurance is not an easy task, and not for everyone. You need to be highly motivated constantly, not take no for an answer, be able to small talk clients, make the client interview positive, and tell how your product is far superior than others.<br>  You will need to show the interviewer why you are a great seller of either goods or services, look professional, act professional, learn products quickly, able to difuse a possible negative situation and turn it positive, know why you wish to work for them and not a competitor, know what you bring to the table.<br>  If you are not a go-getter don't waste your time with insurance companies.

It's one of alot of little extras you can do to be really methodical and comprehensive in your job searching isn't it, to get that bit of an edge over the rest. And if attention to detail is needed in the job it might be an advantage to make contact.
tGgADx4Raa	I've been a server for 7 years and when I am out hunting I believe it is extremly imprortant to look proffessional. Even tho you are only trying to get a job in the food industry wear slacks and a nice shirt, fix your hair how you would if your where going out to the club and where make-up. This shows that you care about you apperance and will show up for work looking nice. It's also important to convay a happy personality, always start by shakeing their hand, it's considered good people skills which is important in the serves field.<br>  <br>  If your hair looks best down, then do it that way. The interveiwer will be well aware of the fact you are able to pull it back for the job. I always have mine down it just looks nicer, they hardly ever say anything about if they do it will be somthing like "and of course you will have to have you hair back" in which case you just nod and aggree.<br>  <br>  Good luck :)|`|Ktp0U3Suaa	I suggest you to try project payday, simply because you don't need any money up front and you can start making money within minutes.

56NrBGtTaa	The IRS has sophisticated software to flag your return, for anything out of the norm and doesn't jive very well with past. If it gets flagged, an agent will look at it and decide if you need audited. Some audits are done informal, Done through the mail and requesting you to call. The ones that can get ugly is when you have to take all your information to the IRS building.<br>  You can keep your State refund, if you qualify for a refund regardless of the federal audit. But the feds and state do share information, Making more than other people is not a flag, Your W-2 from a fast food restaurant , and an income of $100,000 unsubstantiated will bring a flag, But most people don't over report income, because that causes more taxes. They would be looking for under reporting. A flag would  jump out if you had expensive home(s), property and  large donations, with a minimum wage pay.The IRS is fairly quiet about what flags your return, other than the obvious.<br>  <br>  Carl|`|Pjm9pg7iaa	No one really knows the formula the IRS uses to choose you for an audit. If people learned the formula, they would be able to avoid an audit. Less than 1% of all returns are audited.<br>  Your federal and state are separate. it would be possible to get your state money back and then get an IRS audit. They would not necessarily be linked.<br>  For a long time the IRS audited more low-income earners than high-income. No one thought that was smart..|`|4d5247fbc8be95ded60ba90440fe55ecaa	Sure! State taxes and Federal taxes are completely separate from one another. The Feds audit some people, but it is done randomly and/or when something is suspicious. Odds are it won't happen to you, but if so, just make sure you have all the available documentation you used to file. <br>  <br>  Good luck!

nuuwAq6eaa	it's obvious that you can't speak English properly.. I'm betting you're from a non English speaking country. It's OK.. we're on the same boat.  Anyway, don't worry.. it's normal. What matters is your skill.<br>  <br>  Anyway after some analyzing i understood your question.. or at least i hope i did.. I think what you're trying to say is that..<br>  <br>  you have a degree and three years of experience with work that is related to exporting goods. And now you're worried that you will loose your job in exports due to the economic crisis. Am I right?<br>  <br>  anyway, if I am correct than the best advice I can give you would be to find a "side job" that is related to business like sales and marketing. Don't quit your job just because you're afraid of loosing it. The side job is only there in case something goes wrong.<br>  <br>  Of course you can get jobs from other fields but you should take into consideration the experience that you have. You are already knowledgeable in business because of your experience in exports so if I were you I'd try finding a job that is near it like in local businesses.|`|SZAGOYMYaa	Silly lady. You need to take English classes if you want a good job. I can't understand what you wrote.|`|oDhSxINLaa	A lot of those things you said are not words.  The ones that were actually words were so badly out of place they were nonsense.  It's as if you were smashing the keyboard and in some improbable chain of events you typed the words "upset" "career" and "exports" then hit the submit button.<br>  <br>  I hope that helps.<br>  Cheers
suWnr83laa	You would have a much better response if you are asking this seriously. Which means "please" instead of "plz" and "should" instead of "shud". We are not your text messenger friends.|`|M9iO7Q0Eaa	$13,000 a month? Well then...in a year, you should be able to pay a house off with that. Uh...what are you worried about, again?<br>  <br>  Because there are people out here trying to make it on $1,300 a month. Do try to be a little bit more thankful, huh? Sounds like a good idea to me. I doubt anyone will feel that 'sorrowful'. There are plenty of jobs out there - you have to fight like the rest of us.
2PDBxlYDaa	"Ugly" people get hired all the time in part time and full time jobs...in blue collar and white collar jobs. Ugly and Beauty are relative terms because they are different for everyone. Guys have told me that they have found Britney Spears to be ugly, while other guys have told me that she to them is hot. Its all relative.<br>  <br>  Now what both "ugly" and "beautiful" people do is they try to pick clothes that flatter them. Are you a girl? Go to a makeup counter, even walgreens and ask them to help you out on what makeup would enhance your looks. Trust me, makeup worn the right way can do a lot for you.<br>  <br>  If you're a guy then just wear good cologne, none of that cheap stuff, spend some money on just one bottle and spray a bit, you don't need a lot but spray it and you're good to go. Shave, if you have a beard or mustache make sure that its groomed.<br>  <br>  Just make sure that you have really good hygiene. When you meet people, shake their hand, ask them questions. Dress professionally. When you do those applications, they don't want to hear the truth, they just want to hear what they want to hear. I've taken those types of questions online because so many applications are online now.<br>  <br>  So just tell them what they want to hear. Employees want someone who will be a team player and do what they're told to do at work. Don't sound arrogant. I've been looking for a job for 4 months and I can't find one either, its not you, its the economy.<br>  <br>  Also prepare a resume, google resume samples and write one then take it with you even if you submitted your application online. Just take it with you. It will make you stand out and make you serious. But just be clean and pressed. I used to have an "ugly" friend but he changed his hair, and bought nice clothes and that really helped him out a lot.<br>  <br>  You have to play the game. That's just how it is. The right clothes, shoes, hygiene, the right haircut can really change things for you for the better. Also it takes time to learn how to interview and land the job. Try to learn something new from each interview even if you think it went well.|`|AA11548618	When I saw your question, I couldn't resist, so I typed in a search for d*** jobs and found the following website.<br>  <br>  At least it has an interesting article, and maybe there are some ideas in there you haven't tried.<br>  <br>  Hang in there!|`|CwH9HUiPaa	I suggest you to try project payday, simply because you don't need any money up front and you can start making money within minutes.

S1O84P7caa	Unfortunatally using a friend sometimes makes it harder than normal but if they stink then they stink.<br>  Realtors are just people like a waitor in a resturant some are good ,helpful and go the extra mile and some are just waiting for the shift to end and go home with what ever tips they get.<br>  Your buyers agent is exactly that a buyers agent and is supposed to be looking after you advising you and finding homes for you to look at. <br>  <br>  GET A NEW ONE OR DO IT YOUR SELF. And get an inspection before you close. That is all it sounds like they are going to do for you anyway. <br>  <br>  I think that the califonia market is near the bottom of where it is going to be but if you want to be sure you can always go out on your own find a house for sale by owner and ask them to owner finance or lease to own. But make sure that you get the payment statements in your mail or copys every month. the last thing you want is for the house that you are buying to go into foreclosure while you are paying the payment or think you are and the owner is just pocketing it. <br>  <br>  This way if things get worse you can always walk and get a better priced house, because the loan is not in your name, you just lose the deposit, no credit issues so put as little down as possible and tell them you are going to get a loan within a year. <br>  <br>  Bank owned properties are great now and short sales, try going to a few of you local REIA (real estate investment assosiations) meetings for ideas they should have meetings every month, google it for your area. <br>  You will find deals and realtors willing to help aswell as investors to sell you homes with no money down or repair allowanses. <br>  Please feel free to reply with any questions.  Best to you.|`|scOP8NDvaa	Well, it is always good to have an expert opinion from another party.<br>  Get another professional to access the situation and do the job.<br>  Buyer always has the advantage edge.|`|23SkYEw5aa	based on what you have said, she sucks.<br>  <br>  A realtor need to do more then open a door.<br>  <br>  <br>  business is business and friends are friends.  do mix them.<br>  <br>  since she is a "friend", I'm betting she feels that she can get by with what she is doing.<br>  <br>  Find another agent.|`|RuQ1MOsQaa	In my opinion I would say no not at all. When it comes time to paying for the house she will be making a commission of you. Usually a realtor is suppose to sell you on the house, as in make a crappy house seem appealing to the buyer. You should probably call him/her and request updates on your housing bids.
0OHdULR0aa	if you have an S.B account and if you are dealing with the bank, most of the banks do accept the cheques in USD; while doing so, money will be deposited by converting into INR, which will be done by bank; to name a few banks, ICICI, HDFC, SBI and many such banks do this.

K45ZTwryaa	If your former employer lies about you when someone calls them for a reference and it is a lie that casts you in a negative light and makes you appear undesirable for employment then it would constitute defamation and you would have a civil case against the employer for slander, the oral form of defamation.  They key obstacle to overcome would be to prove that your employer made the statement to a third party, i.e. the person who called for the reference.  <br>  <br>  This could be established by securing that person's testimony by sworn affidavit and if necessary by testimony in court if the action should proceed to trial.  In some states you can also trap the former employer in the lie by using another third party and recording the conversation for evidence (the legality of single party consent to recording phone conversations varies from state to state).<br>  <br>  You can probably contact your state bar association for recommendations for lawyers that have experience in labor law and defamation, and there may be some among them that would be willing to offer you a free consultation to assess the merits of your case.<br>  <br>  Good luck.|`|d331dd95c4a1ebbb6ed4bd0996d3a0b6aa	it is illegal to give false information, but is not illegal to give a bad reference if is true
UeLigNB0aa	Here is what you need to do. Your girlfriend will have to be on the loan, killing 2 birds with 1 stone. You get her income to offset your debt to income ratio. Next, in order to appease your parents, have your girlfriend sign a quick claim deed after closing which takes her off title because you can't have her on the loan but not title at closing.<br>  The other option is you provide bank statements as proof that she is paying the car note and you try and qualify on your own. Like the other poster stated, the first time buyers credit is set to expire at the end of the year so there is no way to know if it will be around in a couple of years. Your first step is to get in touch with a mortgage banker/broker to get pre-approved then find a realtor. You do not need to limit yourself to just a local bank either.|`|RqQDKEVHaa	Great answer from kevc21.<br>  <br>  There are huge perils in buying a property with a girlfriend. Either marry her, or get a lawyer to structure the transaction.<br>  <br>  If you cosigned for your girlfriend's car, that'll be on your credit report. And that's counted against you. It doesn't matter who's making the payments. You're legally obligated to if she doesn't. And that's what the lender cares about.<br>  <br>  It's highly unlikely that lenders will allow her income and not put her on the deed. It sometimes is possible, but rarely.<br>  <br>  Check with an accountant, too. And don't assume there will be any first time home buyer credit in the future. The current ones are all set to expire. Realistically, they'll probably be extended as long as the real estate mess continues. But a couple of years? Questionable.<br>  <br>  Regarding your timeshare: Yes, you've got to "claim" it. You bought it; you're paying for it. It's on your credit report. <br>  <br>  Check with a mortgage broker now. You've really got a messed-up situation. You bought a time-share. You bought a new car just a year ago. You co-signed for your girlfriend's car. You want to include your girlfriend's income. And I suspect there's more going on. You really need to know where you stand financially. You may or may not be able to qualify, even with your parents' assistance.<br>  <br>  Get pre-approved. You don't go into a real estate office for that. You go to a lender. Use a real bricks-and-mortar one, not an online one. Call a Realtor or two and ask who they recommend. You want someone with experience who can get loans through, and will be honest with you about your situation. The lender will tell you what to bring. (W-2s, past tax returns, etc.)<br>  <br>  Hope that helps.|`|fbb9fc7e22a979652a0e870b1fd145e1aa	Seriously...<br>  1. Get married and buy with your WIFE, or<br>  2.

RkfIPD7Iaa	Most people do not get all their tax back.  In fact, roughly half of all taxpayers owe tax at the end of the year.  The other half get back some or (in rare cases) all their tax.<br>  <br>  The system is set up to estimate your yearly tax bill.  If you work less than a full year, the deductions will be wrong and you will have overpaid.  If you have other deductions, such as RRSP or others, you will have overpaid.<br>  <br>  If you work two jobs, or have other income, or get a large raise during the year, you will have underpaid, and will owe at year end.<br>  <br>  Smart taxpayers make sure they claim all deductions possible on their TD1 (the form your company uses to determine your tax liability), but some people underestimate their deductions so they intentionally get a bigger refund.

Just because you have a "higher education" does not mean that you are better or above anyone else. Just because you may have learned things they have not, does not mean they are not intelligent people! You're right, you do sound like a jerk. One would assume, since your education apparently places you at a cognitive level higher than those around you, that you would have at least bothered to store some tact in with your immense knowledge. People like you are the reason I decided to work with animals. They don't act like jerk-offs and treat other people badly for no reason. How about you get to know them first, then decide who you get along with on a personal level and just avoid the ones you don't get along with? Hmmmm? Though, judging by your attitude, I doubt I would want to be your friend or bother to converse with you at all.<br>  <br>  Calling them uneducated is the same as deciding a parrot is smarter than a lizard because it can talk.

They have probably had a terrible life, perhaps where they're parents had no control or concern for their life, and they're just trying to make a living. <br>  <br>  And why should you measure them by their education. Perhaps like me, it has nothing to do with education, but they were just given a different qualities to you - and the fact they are 'slower' learners or 'dumb' isn't something they could particularly choose or control. If i had one wish it would be to be more naturally intelligent, in all honesty...but it's jerks like you which remind me why i should happy the way i am...<br>  <br>  Since when has work been about the friendships anyway, you seem more inclined for work rather than relationships. So it shouldn't be a problem. <br>  <br>  And trust me, you'll be working more than talking, so get over it and deal with conversations about the weather and grouchy customers. Your not there to have an intimate relationship, and trust me - you'll make it tolerable This isn't your career, it's a job just to get by, so stop acting like your going to be their for the rest of your life.<br>  <br>  If you take the job try to see the positive, and you should be thankful to have any job at this point of time in the world.  <br>  <br>  I'm sorry, but I'm sure you meant this in a nicer way, but i honestly can't see that and i'm very offended when people generalize, especially as something as pathetic as this.

AA11752525	Dear Arkansas,<br>  <br>                 Your loan is legitimate and final. The absence of finding a Federal Truth in Lending Disclosure Statement does not negate the fact you applied for a loan and received loan proceeds. It does not negate the possibility that such document has not been signed, cannot be found or was never signed.<br>  <br>                   If this document was never signed and no photocopy can be foundm you have a valid argument to the effect that no interest can be collected against your loan AND MORE IMPORTANTLY your lender may be liable for your legal fees in enforcing your claim. Easy for legal fees to reach several times the amount of overpaid interest BUT you are gambling (Most Truth in Lending Attorneys are not about to take contingency cases) that no signed Disclosure Statement eventually turns up in the files of the lender or escrow.<br>  <br>              You have an interesting argument to utilize in your renegotiation weapons. It is unclear if you can prevail but likely too costly to fully defend from the lender's perspective. You should have an attorney or accountant assist you in negotiations to maximize your case credibility.<br>  <br>               It is also critical to know whether or not your foreclosure is a judicial or non-judicial foreclosure. This will determine the steps you must take to preserve your legal rights. If you do not file timely, you might lose your rights to present your defense and preserve your remedies.<br>  <br>               This is not an area to do-it-yourself. You may or may not have valid claims. You may need to take immediate actions to preserve and protect yourself. You have a potential large leg to stand upon, if you negotiate carefully and with someone to back you up.<br>  <br>                 Your loan was closed. To the extent you paid payments with interest, you MAY have been overcharged<br>  by the amount of interest for each payment, if you can prevail on the Truth-in-Lending Violation. You will be awarded damages upto three times the amount of interest you have paid under the Statute. Your Deed of Trust will still be payable over the original loan term be it  5 years, 30 years, 40 years or other.   <br>  <br>                    You must talk to someone with Federal litigation Truth-In-Lending knowledge but your case can be brought into State Court as well.<br>  <br>                     Daniel.... Good Luck and fight.

fFnsJ7maaa	A mutual fund is a basket of investments. You put money in, and the fund takes your money and puts it into investments. When you take money out, the fund has to sell some investments in order to send you your cash. In addition, the mangers buy and sell investments depending on market conditions.<br>  <br>  Some of those investments might have been bought long ago at a much lower price, long before you bought in. Selling them now generates a capital gain to the fund. Even though the fund lost money on paper. <br>  <br>  Think of it like your entire portfolio. You might have 2 bank accounts, some mutual funds, some stock, and a comic collection. Your stocks and funds go down, you sell some comic books for much more than the 25c you paid for them. You have a capital gain even though overall you're down.|`|y7Mwptsraa	You might be referring to a capital gain reported on a T3 slip (box 21). It is conceivable that you would have to pay a capital gain even when the value of the mutual fund has gone down, and you've not sold the units.<br>  <br>  The purpose of a mutual fund is to pool money together from a number of investors in order to purchase other investments. The mutual fund may earn interest, dividends, or capital gains as the investments are sold. The income is then distributed to the investors (like you), and the amounts are reported to you on a T3 so that you can properly report them on your tax return. <br>  <br>  This will happen regardless of whether the value of the mutual fund itself goes up or down. So even if the value of the mutual fund went down, it still might have distributed a capital gain to you.
3Ze4nR9Caa	While they may not decide to sue you, they are definitely going to keep your security deposit.<br>  <br>  You should have notified the landlord about the leak as soon as you noticed it, not only to prevent damage to the property, but to protect yourself.  Since you didn't bother to report the leak, legally they can hold you responsible for any damage that was caused, especially since you said there is mold, which means it had been leaking for quite some time.  By not telling the landlord about it, you didn't live up to the obligations of your lease and will definitely be held accountable.|`|Ikd9cppcaa	Since you are in the socialist state of California, who knows if you would have liability on the garage leak?

Apparently, the toilet was caving in through the floor.<br>  <br>  The kitchen was underneath and the half the kitchen celing had a water circle from TOILET water, which meant of course, raw sewage.<br>  <br>  The place absolutely reaked.<br>  <br>  Repairs were over $3k...I successfully sued them and won.<br>  <br>  Had they told me about the leak, I could have fixed it for $2.00.|`|4Mb1mFORaa	Absolutely not are you obligated.

AA11752525	Dear MC,<br>  <br>                   in California lenders have a selection to conduct judicial or nonjudicial foreclosures. The non-judicial method is faster but the lender sacrifices and waives rights to a deficiency judgment, a judgment in excess of the amount of the loan. Additionally, lenders traditionally bid up to the amount of the total indebtedness at foreclosure sale and NO DEFICIT exists that can be brought against any other property, real or personal. <br>  <br>                    A judicial foreclosure takes two or three times longer and may result in a deficiency judgment but are most infrequently sought. You have state and federal bankruptcy exemptions operating to to protect any equity in the second property.<br>  <br>                      Most likely nothing happens to your current home if you get foreclosed upon. Your legal notice will inform you and likely confirm you will be foreclosed upon in a sales event, not Court supervised after which you can sleep peacefully. You can even improve your odds by offering your lender a Deed-in-Lieu of foreclosure.<br>  <br>                         Good Luck|`|Ns6I7MmBaa	The lender may have a right to offset or cross collateralization that might allow them to apply any deficiency from the rental against the home you still own through the same lender.  I know they can seize cash from bank accounts at the same bank to settle debt (other than credit card debt).  That is something that tripped up a lot of people with bank mergers.<br>  <br>  In any case, you will likely still owe if the foreclosure auction price of the rental is less than the balance of any loans on it, and may not be able to sell your current home without settling that.|`|wzwUcjvhaa	In Calif they can get a judgment against the unpaid balance it is good for 10 years and they can renew it<br>  Sorry to tell you this Do you have any equity in you present home ?

If I order in, it's usually chinese meals.|`|4Pk6VNftaa	Why would anyone order hotdogs or popcorn for delivery?  They can easily be made in the microwave.

What does your proposed business offer that's different from all of these?|`|PRmoYaTpaa	This has been tried with pizza before and worked for a little while but finally bit the dust.<br>  <br>  The problem is you would have to have access to when netflix was being sent so the concession order could go and arrive at the same time. That would be difficult. Sometimes I get it the next day and sometimes its three days. If you had to have the client order it when received they may want to watch their movie now and not wait for the concession food as well.<br>  <br>  It might be better to offer a coupon with the netflix movie for them to use at anytime. Also have them refer a friend to get more discounts and build your database.

Mastering the art of starting IV's is essential and only can help in the long run.  <br>  <br>  Unit coordinator is also a good one, as long as you plan to work at the same hospital after you graduate.  Learning the computer system and how the overall institution works can only be helpful.  <br>  <br>  Patient transfer coordinator - these people transfer patients to and from x-ray.  It's essential to know how to transfer patients from bed to bed for obvious reasons ...  <br>  <br>  EKG tech.  The earlier you learn how to read EKG's the better.  The doctor may even teach you how to read them.  <br>  <br>  Honestly, I think any job at a hospital can be helpful, even housekeeping.  You learn how the hospital works and still interact with patients at times.  <br>  <br>  I worked at a hospital as a tech, and my job was transferring patients, retrieving items from the storeroom, performing EKG's, etc.  It really was a great experience and I learned so much.  <br>  <br>  Best of luck in nursing school!

Be careful though - if you are getting an EIC, it can reduce that enough to make it not worth claiming the deductions. Turbo tax is handy for plugging in the numbers and seeing the different possibilities in numbers.<br>  <br>  There's a great book on all the many things you can actually claim as deductions when you have your own business.

eACZ1Rhjaa	I think almost everyone is in Chexsystems now. I just opened a couple of new accounts and I am in there. It doesn't matter unless you have messed up a bank account so nobody wants your business. That is why they set it up so they can tell who is the kind who that will write checks when they don't have money or not balance their account.<br>  <br>  Talk to your current bank and ask what they reported about you.|`|OathnQfXaa	Don't have specific stats, but as a personal banker, I would estimate that maybe 1 in 50 people had a chexsystems record.  That could be skewed by where I worked, though.  The bank should give you the contact information for the banks you have records with and/or the contact info for chexsystems to dispute the info if you want.  You need to make sure that they update your records once you pay any amounts owed, too.  I noticed that 99.9% of banks DON'T do that, which is really frustrating for the customer.

5586ad15a09ab2f36457c1e8042071f2aa	Uh, and what exactly do you expect someone HERE to DO for you to help you? We do not get your bill. We do not know when it is due. We do not know how much you owe and what your minimum payment is. So, I ask, WHAT do you expect HERE from asking this question? The way to get out of debt is to PAY THE BILL with as much as you can every month BEFORE the due date! Making MORE than the minimum payment specified on the bill reduces the amount of interest you are charged since you are charged on the remaining balance and the lower that balance before the next billing period, the less interest you are charged. Paying BEFORE the due date means NO late fees. Your problem is you are NOT paying attention to detail. You say, "Please help!" but I fail to see how anyone  here can actually DO anything to help you. USE a calendar and pay MORE than the minimum, well BEFORE the due date on the bill! Look at the interest rate. I'll bet they have jacked it up to the "default" rate because you have made LATE payments and it is probably in the area of 25% instead of the 12%-15% it used to be when you got the credit card. Call the bank and negotiate the interest rate to get it back down to something reasonable. Your only chip is to cancel the card. If they do not lower the rate, then cancel the card. You will still have to pay it off, but you will no longer have a card with a huge default interest rate. Apply for another with another bank. If you have more than one card, then you should apply the most money to the card with the highest outstanding balance. An alternative if you can do it is pay the minimum on cards you can not pay off in full with the next bill and if you have enough to pay one card in full, do that to get rid of that bill entirely and then retire the card and do NOT use it. Otherwise, apply as much as you can to the card with the largest balance. Above all, PAY ON TIME to avoid late fees and avoid having the interest rate being raised as a penalty for making late payments, and if the interest rates HAVE been raised to the default rate, call to negotiate a lower rate and if you do not get a lower rate, cancel the cards of the banks that refuse to cooperate with you. Again, I can TELL YOU all of this, but unless you start paying attention to detail and making more than the minimum payments and you make all payments ON TIME, you will never get out of the hole you have dug for yourself. When you dig yourself into a hole, YOU SHOULD STOP DIGGING, which means STOP USING CREDIT CARDS to pay for things, sacrifice and tighten the belt and economize, give up going out to dinner, skip seeing the most recent released action movie, stop buying video games, shop sales, use coupons, buy generic brands instead of high priced named brands. Skip the caviar and vintage champagne on your anniversary or birthday. USE CASH or don't buy. Ask yourself, do I NEED this, or do I WANT this? NEEDS you BUY with CASH. WANTS you skip and do without. THIS is all common sense, which I guess in your case, is NOT so common, IS it?  ... YMMV ...<br>  <br>  According to your profile, "WILBUR Z", you asked a question 8 months ago and said, "I'm a girl of 18 yrs. I'm in need of fashionable teen clothes. I tried local shops, but did not find the dresses of my taste. I would be happy if anybody suggests me good stores where I can get nice teen dresses." Wilbur is not exactly a feminine name, is it? So, what is the truth here?<br>  <br>  According to your profile, 3 months ago, you asked a question about regulations regarding a company and stated, "I am a large publicly traded retailer." OK, I'll bite, what is the name of your publicly traded company? I would like to look into your stock history and I'd like to know how a 18 year old female with a name of Wilbur Z CEO/owner of a company large enough to be publicly traded on a stock exchange.

(It's in Dallas, but you can email them a message asking if they have a branch in your area.) They will work with your creditors, get the interest rates lowered and stop the late fees.  You pay them once or twice a month, and they will distribute the money to your creditors.  The one I use charges $25 a month for the service, which is included in the amount I send them every payday.  My interest rates before I went with them ranged from 19-32%, and now are 9-15%.  You will get your debt paid off a lot sooner that way, at a much lower cost.|`|OathnQfXaa	I totally understand how that goes.  What worked for me was setting up automatic payments for minimum payments on credit cards and for set payment bills like cell phone, car payment, auto insurance, etc.  I figure I can always make extra payments whenever I wanted but I knew at least my minimums were taken care of and I wouldn't mess up my credit or get charges.  I also set up stuff to be able to see it online.  If your bank has billpay thru online banking, you can use that to pay all your bills from one spot instead of logging into a bunch of different websites.  You can set up alerts, too, to remind you when bills are due.|`|YNFuWGpwaa	I don’t have the perfect solution, but here’s what I do.

Gun3UGzaaa	I think you need to talk with your HR department. Normally it means that you are covered by insurance for 60%, and if you use 3 hours of PTO a day, that is another 37.5% of a day, which combined together would give you almost 100% of pay.  Alternately, you could not use any PTO bank and just get 60% from the insurance company.<br>  <br>  One thing that is important with short term disability is that once you are approved, you need to make sure you are fully healed before returning to work.  Sometimes the policies have a waiting period that says you have to be back at work for at least a month before any more benefits will be paid.  So, if you come back next monday, and realize on Wednesday that you are still too hurt, you might not get benefits.<br>  <br>  When you talk with the insurance company, make sure you cleary understand what the return to work rules are before you return.<br>  <br>  Hope you feel better soon.|`|WGebRhqyaa	no disability insurance is only allowed to pay you up to a certain percentage of your pay so 60% is all you'll get from them. i'm not sure though if you'll employer will be paying the difference.

Most states require a court hearing first.  Then if the eviction ins granted you would be served a notice to vacate within a specified time, usually 24 to 48 hours.  Yes, if you don't vacate after being served a writ of possession, you can be physically removed and the landlord can remove your property and place it on the street.<br>  <br>  realtor.sailor|`|2N6oTOLQaa	Yep. Like the first answer says the cops probably won't show up at midnight but they will be there the next morning if the landlord calls them.<br>  <br>  The eviction process legally ends a tenants rights to occupy private property that does not belong to them. At the point when that eviction notice expires, it becomes trespassing for the tenants to remain on the property. Typically the tenants won't be charged with anything, but they will be physically removed from the premises by the police, with force if necessary. At that point its too late to pack up your stuff. The eviction notice is intended to give tenants adequate time to pack their belongings and move them out, so the police aren't going to wait around while the tenant packs their things. Anything that is still in the apartment after the police remove the tenant is considered abandoned property. Local laws vary regarding what a landlord must do in terms of storing abandoned property but typically the landlord can dispose of it after a certain amount of time.|`|8b0564e4f294954027d36b00630751e6aa	If this is a court Order than maybe - have him go to your local legal aid office - they are free they have housing rights attorneys there that specialize in evictions if the date is Friday 2/27/09 than yes.<br>  <br>  The other thing that the tenant can do is take a lot of pictures of their personal possession, gather receipts, make sure that the unit is in good condition; because the owner will want to hold onto any deposits to recover lost rent. <br>  <br>  This is not something that happened overnight, the tenant was given a 3 day notice to quit - 30 or 60 day notice to vacate - appearance in court - and an order to vacate by the judge. <br>  <br>  This is the home owners business, it is not his responsibility to let a tenant live for free. The tenant has created financial hardship on the owner and it is the tenant's responsibility to stop any accrued debt not only to the owner but to the tenant himself. <br>  <br>  Most police departments have higher priorities on Friday but they will be there first thing in the morning on Saturday. <br>  <br>  Remember an eviction notice by an owner is different than an Order from a judge|`|RZzMse3Haa	Your question is not clear on if this 15 days was issued by landlord or by the court.<br>  <br>  if issued by landlord:  YES, they are supposed to be out by midnight on that 15th day, but the sheriff will not be involved yet.<br>  <br>  If they are not out, then the landlord still has to file the formal eviction with the court. The sheriff cannot come and remove them till after the court hearing. That is when they are escorted off the property and are not allowed to take any of their stuff.<br>  <br>  They DO NOT want to let it go that far!!  Yes it would give them more time to move, but it is not in their favor to do that.  IF they wait for the formal eviction they will owe more money for court fees and have a formal eviction on their record which will make it nearly impossible to rent another place.<br>  <br>  If this was a court order:  Then the sheriff will be out the first business day after that 15th day and remove them. They typically don't go out on the weekends.  The landlord must go to the office and request them.  They do not go automatically, and the offices are not typically open on the weekends.|`|AA10045620	Yes, it is true.  What ever is left in the apartment becomes the landlord's and they can do what they want with it, including setting it on the curb for the garbage collector.|`|GJKWgx0Paa	in most states, day of the week does not matter.<br>  <br>  what might matter is time of day -- your neighbors need to consult your states' tenant laws.  Suppose the law says "noon" of the designated day instead of the midnight you and they have assumed??<br>  <br>  It might say noon or even 9am specifically because the state legislature thought of evictions at midnight and decided to not permit them.<br>  <br>  ***<br>  now, in some states, perhaps most, a notice to quit issued by a landlord is not the same as an eviction notice, which is issued by a court.  If your neighbors got a notice to quit, they probably can appeal to the local court, or wait for an eviction notice.  However, if they got an eviction notice issued by a court, their only courses of action are to file a timely appeal with a higher court or be out, because the sheriff or bailiff will certainly show up with the "putter outers" [the government crew who put belongings out on the street].|`|AA10832514	It depends on the state you live in.  Laws vary from state to state.  Usually, an eviction notice is their final warning and then the constables or other policing agency will come and forcefully remove them.

They need to go peacefully and let the person who owns the property get someone else in there to pay the taxes and mortgage.|`|zHmZkMStaa	They have to be out by midnight.

Gi6cpZmuaa	I'd speak to a qualified Financial Advisor to give me a few pointers. I'm qualifying to be one myself after 5 years of experience as a Mortgage Consultant. One thing I've learned is the safest way to invest is through diversifying your portfolio.<br>  <br>  See, there are basically two kinds of risk - systemic risk and non-systemic risk. Systemic risk you cannot do a lot about, as they are the factors which affect everything (inflation, national and world economic conditions, etc). Non-systemic risks are particular to an individual type of investment, which is why it is never a good idea to "put your eggs in one basket", so to speak. <br>  <br>  Needless to say, if you put all your eggs in one basket, the potential returns could be high, but you are exposing yourself pretty badly should there be a good chance of your investment going awry. This is not an advisable investment strategy. Hence, this is why it's advisable to speak to an Advisor, who will be able to help you construct a portfolio with a minimal level of non-systemic risk.<br>  <br>  There are many factors at play in such a scenario, so if you really do have ￡100k to invest (lucky you if you do!), I would very much recommend you speak to a Financial Advisor to work out what to do.<br>  <br>  |`|B1GjfOUdaa	Invest is nowhere I would keep it under the matress.

I mean, I took some time off after high school, traveled, and will graduate with my RN-BSN when I am 28! (27 now).

fdbabb3af185907dab03ecc5e07fab4baa	If you want to consolidate debt. if you want one bill. and if you want pay everything off you want a fixed rate home equity loan.<br>  <br>  most big banks offer this loan with no closing cost to you. If the lender you check with wants to charge you closing cost take your business someplace else. Check with your first mortgage lender they will probably give you the best rates. <br>  <br>  if you are looking to borrow a relatively small amount of money you are better off with a fixed rate home equity loan. if your looking for over 100K then it may be worth it to refi you first if the closing cost are low and you get a good rate. If your rate on your first is less than 6% don't touch it because you will never get that rate again. <br>  <br>  if you are borrowing over 100k and your 1st mortgage rate is in 6.5% or higher then you may save money by refi your 1st as long as you don't go over 80% loan to value and pay PMI.|`|01fddc2bac23e08cd2ae464562fac028aa	Unless you have an incredible interest rate on your first mortgage, I would suggest refinancing the house rather than a HELOC. Interest rates at the moment are considerably low, and getting yourself into an adjustable Home Equity Loan will end up costing you more in the long run. <br>  <br>  I run into these types of situations frequently, people wanting to improve their life by using the equity in their property, and it's usually the people that don't get sold the idea of a HELOC that succeed. <br>  <br>  If you have more questions, or want some more info, email me or check out our website.<br>  <br>  Baconshmals@yahoo.com<br>  <br>  <a href="http://aapexfund.com" rel="nofollow">http://aapexfund.com</a>|`|fc9eeab90a6037a409ce4f6722ff7403aa	Right off hand, if you don't currently have the funds to cover these bills, I think that a home equity line of credit would be the smartest thing.  Why?<br>  1)  Unlike other bills, you can write off the interest on it.<br>  2)  It's credit that you already have (depending on the amount of equity you have on your home<br>  3)  As the bank knows you're already good for the money and they're guaranteed payback, it's flexible- i.e. you don't have to pay a specific amount every month.  You can "pay as you go".<br>  #3 listed above is also the problem.  When some people (and I emphasize, 'some' people) are given that kind of latitude, they consider it sort of 'free' money and go on a spree with it.  The fact is, it still has to be paid back, whether it's in the near future or when they sell their house, at which time the bank gets their money from the sale first, and the people selling the house get theirs last.  You want to be careful and use self-discipline with type of credit!  According to the MSN money website I've listed below, they say: The only way this maneuver really helps you, however, is if you stop using your credit cards to run up debt. Otherwise, you're just digging yourself a deeper hole.<br>  <br>  Now- you say that you have fair credit, but not the best.  Having a good credit rating these days is worth a lot, since so many people are in debt.  If you choose to use your home equity line of credit to pay off your bills, I would call any of the billing companies who you have overdue bills with and let them know you 're considering two options right now: One, you could go to a debt-consolidation company.  They will call the people who you owe money to and get the interest reduced and you'll get a lower payoff amount.  I'm neither laywer nor counselor, but from what I've read (see websites at bottom of page) using a debt consolidator does indeed hurt your credit.  This being the case, you could try to work out a deal with them, whereby if you pay off your full debt now, will they agree not to report (or to correct any previous reports) you to one or all of the credit bureaus out there.  You having the ability to off your bills, regardless of how you do it, gives you some leverage, and what better reward can you recieve than by having your credit rating improve?  I would go to freecreditreport.com and get a copy first to see what your score really is, as well as what you can do to improve it.  Sometimes it's a matter of having too many open credit cards and reducing them reduces your chance of racking up too much debt.  If you have open cards that you don't need (why have more than one or two, really?), find out who they are with, take the time to make the phone calls and have them cancelled.  Sometimes when you pay a bill late (even if it's by a few days), the company you owed it to will report it to the three credit bureaus (they all share information) and it's considered a strike on your record and your score goes down.  If any of the strikes currently on your record is from the people you owe the money to, ask them to work with you, agreeing that if you'll pay the bill in full today, they agree to have the old mark erased and promise not to report anything else about your current debt to the credit bureaus if they get their money within the allotted timeframe.  When undertaking these negotiations, remember the old line that honey attracts more flies than vinegar, i.e. be nice to them- they don't owe you a thing. Whatever you agree upon, try to get it in writing!<br>  I don't really know if it will work, but it's worth a try.  If a debt-consolidator can make one phone call and have a person's credit greatly lowered or erased. why wouldn't they do this?  Your goal of course, is to have less or no bills, along with a great credit rating, and this would be a great way to go about it.<br>  Helpful websites:<br>  <a href="http://www.faqfarm.com/wiki.phtml?title=Special:FAQ&tid=2107" rel="nofollow">http://www.faqfarm.com/wiki.phtml?title=...</a><br>  <br>  <a href="http://moneycentral.msn.com/content/savinganddebt/managedebt/p84151.asp?printer" rel="nofollow">http://moneycentral.msn.com/content/savi...</a><br>  <br>  Best of luck to you.

This is no tax cut but are just paying forward your 2009 tax refund in $13 a week installments. In other words they are just taking less out right now but your tax liability at the end of the year is the same. There is no change in the tax tables other than raising the limits in the qualifying brackets. So given your income remains the same your 2009 tax return will be $507 less than your 2008 return. 39 weeks from April to December x $13 withholding reduction = $507. So anyone getting a tax return in 2008 under $500 may what to consult with there tax representative to head off having to pay on their 2009 tax return.

While I don’t think there is any problem with having a beer garden,heating the open air in an attempt to keep punters happy is wrong. If people have to go outside to smoke then they should take a jacket with them, or at least wear clothes that keep you warm! In todays environment of global warming, Crazy weather patterns; we should be doing our best to reduce our carbon footprint. Just one pub in Kilkenny has 18 x 2 KW/h bar heaters,which comes out at 36 KW/h Calculating the average CO2 emitted by power stations in Ireland, Approx 650 gram (I used an average of coal 900grams and Natural Gas 400grams). So these heaters would output 21KG/h and this is just for the heaters. If I did the calculation correct  Depending on the tarrifs obtained from the ESB, ranging from 0.12cent for the first 1500KW/h. It does not take into account the carbon footprint yet!.<br>  <br>  I can imagine that as prices for electricity increase, as per the cost of generating electricity pubs will have to look hard at the use of patio heaters, or put up the price of Beer, spirits. which at €4.40 for the average pint in Kilkenny is is getting very costly to have a night out! I think this will be a good thing in the long run as with the cost of heating a smoking area will keep getting more and more expensive, and in times of “recession” we generally watch our wallets.<br>  <br>  These are two pubs that have a major use in patio heaters in kilkenny:<br>  <br>  Langtons (Gas)<br>  <br>  Kytlers Inn (Electric)<br>  <br>  The left bank (Electric)<br>  <br>  I singled out these two Pubs in Kilkenny because of the amount of heaters that they use to heat their beer gardens. I will add to the list as i find them<br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  22  Sep Bio Fuel <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  It seems that with the High price of oil people are beginning to turn to Biofuel as a way to beat the pump price of oil. This also has its share of problems. The more people use, say Rapeseed oil instead of diesel the harder it is to buy it. It seems that the market for Rapeseed has gone through the Roof, where as even a few months ago farmers were still wondering what to do with all the Oil they produced.<br>  <br>  A friend of mine as been running his van on rapeseed for the last 2 years. He is now finding it harder and harder to get rapeseed as a lot of local farmers have run out. It seems that supply cannot keep up with demand and its going to get to a stage that it might only be a few cents cheaper than Diesel….<br>  <br>  According to an article in the Irish Times we use “183,000 barrels of oil per day”<br>  <br>  I wonder how much land it would take to generate 183,000 barrels of oil a day, so that our economy can keep on ticking.<br>  <br>  Considering that “One acre of rapeseed yields 115 gallons of biodiesel” That equivalent to 1591 acres, roughly 6 square kilometers. It take between 6-7 months to grow, (plant in march and harvest in September/ September to march). It is a very bad idea to have a mono crop so the land would have to grow other crops for the rest of the year. So we use on average 66,795,000 Barrels of oil a year. (70% for transport).<br>  <br>  So to supply all the Biodiesel for Ireland for one year, if we could! it would take 2350 Km/2. But because we can only grow the crop in rotation and some time the land would have to be left idle(good farming practice, IANAF). so 3 to 4 times this amount of land would have to be set aside. So taking maybe 3×2350km/2 = 7051km/2 which isn’t a small patch of land by a long shot, Cork County is 7457km/2 in size. So providing Irelands need in Oil for one Year using Biofuel is huge undertaking and I don’t think that it is even possible to do.<br>  <br>  What’s left for Ireland to do? Reduction would be a start! Increase the use of public transport, that is alot easier to say than to implement. I think for the foreseeable future Ireland will depend on Oil. Unless there is a radical shift in Goverment policy|`|YH7fVXtLaa	The whole world is, except communist china lol, its doing ok, america, the uk, france...all the E.U pretty much are on the same boat, the whole world is in some way financially connected to the u.s so when they go wrong, so does everyone else.<br>  <br>  For ireland its a case of hold on and wait it out.<br>  The nobel prize winner for economics said this recession would last atleast 4 years|`|fzV0R8HSaa	The whole world is in a recession because we are all interconnected in some way.

The most common situations when cancellation of debt income is not taxable involve:<br>  <br>  Bankruptcy: Debts discharged through bankruptcy are not considered taxable income. <br>  Insolvency: If you are insolvent when the debt is cancelled, some or all of the cancelled debt may not be taxable to you.You are insolvent when your total debts are more than the fair market value of your total assets.Insolvency can be fairly complex to determine and the assistance of a tax professional is recommended if you believe you qualify for this exception. <br>  Certain farm debts:If you incurred the debt directly in operation of a farm, more than half your income from the prior three years was from farming, and the loan was owed to a person or agency regularly engaged in lending, your cancelled debt is generally not considered taxable income.The rules applicable to farmers are complex and the assistance of a tax professional is recommended if you believe you qualify for this exception. <br>  Non-recourse loans:A non-recourse loan is a loan for which the lender’s only remedy in case of default is to repossess the property being financed or used as collateral.That is, the lender cannot pursue you personally in case of default.Forgiveness of a non-recourse loan resulting from a foreclosure does not result in cancellation of debt income.<br>   <br>  <br>  Go to the link below it has a worksheet to figure if you will have to include the cancellation in your income.

HOWEVER, if the only thing that you did with the money from that debt was buy, build or remodel your primary home, then a new mortgage debt forgiveness law will kick in and you don't have to include it.  Instead, you complete Form 982 and attach it to your Form 1040.  <br>  <br>  If the debt was used for something other than your house (say, to buy a car or pay off other debts), then the amount on the 1099-C is taxable.

L5tWiYOFaa	Yes, first of all they promised to set up a meeting with Arnold Schwarzenegger to discuss product lines, but lo and behold, they send Steven Seagal instead. Now I respect Steven Seagal for his contributions to the war on terror in such classics as 'Under Siege', but I was really looking for a Major 'Dutch' Schaefer to handle my bowling requirements. This would've all been acceptable, but Steven Seagal abruptly left to shoot some orphans in the face about 15 minutes into the consultation, which was really inconsiderate, and Jean-Claude Van Damme took his place. Jean-Claude was polite and most courteous, but what I really wanted was the original meeting with Arnold Schwarzenegger. So I called Dolph Lundgren and asked him to ask Chuck Norris if anybody had seen Mr. Schwarzenegger, but he was far too busy kicking old age pensioners to fully concentrate on Dolph's reasonable request. Jean-Claude Van Damme, angered at his seemingly inferior status as Chad/Alex Wagner to Schwarzenegger's Major 'Dutch' Schaefer completely flipped out and immediately stripped my wallet of ￡5.83, precisely 1/10th of the cost of a shiny new bowling ball.

AA10464818	No-  eBay does not allow selling of pirated stuff including bootleg DVDs. <br>  <br>  But many are selling them. Once caught, ebay kicks them out and they became NARU'd (not a registered user). There's no second chance when caught selling pirated and bootleg stuff on ebay -- once caught, you're kicked out.<br>  <br>  Remember though that there is also what is called the VERO Program - Verified Rights Owner Program <a href="http://pages.ebay.com/help/tp/programs-vero-ov.html" rel="nofollow">http://pages.ebay.com/help/tp/programs-v...</a> composed of the biggest brands as well as small trademark and copyright owners patrolling eBay looking for pirated versions of their stuff. Some brands are very active, such as Kate Spade bags. Since they know their stuff and what is pirated, a Vero member can simply alert eBay of auctions infringing on their copyrights and eBay removes the listing immediately.<br>  <br>  If you're thinking of selling pirated stuff, you may be able to get away from doing it with a few listings. But sooner or later (and most often sooner), you'd be caught selling pirated stuff and you'd be banned from eBay. I suggest don't do it|`|56b3f496cf9b2949ab252875236ed660aa	Technically no.

The way that legit websites make money is by paying you a smaller amount than they charge their clients. Normally it is in the best interest of a survey company to find honest people that are willing to take surveys and not to scare them off with some kind of required payment. If they do ask you for something like this, don’t spend another second on that website, not matter how hard they are trying to explain why a payment from your part would be needed and no matter how reasonable that explanation would seem to you at that time.<br>  Finally, before joining, do a search on the net to see if you can find people that share their experience with that survey company. Even if the level of fraud in this area is nowhere near the pay per click programs, there still are so called companies that disappear after a few moths and forget to pay. You may also want to do a whois search just to know to whom are you giving your personal details.<br>  Now to more specific advices:<br>  Be sure to complete your profile up to every single detail. This way not only you will get a better chance to be invited to take more surveys, but also you have a better chance to receive higher payed ones. The explanation for this is quite simple: surveys ultimately serve as instruments for statistics studies which take a lot of factor into consideration (besides demographic, geographic location, level of education, etc., factors that don’t seem very important at a first glance, like tastes, hobbies, etc., could make a big difference when the company is considering you to take a specific survey).<br>  If after completing your profile, that company sends you a starter survey, complete is as soon as possible even though that one is not payed. Usually the purpose that survey is to complement the info from your profile and shows your level of determination.<br>  After having checked the points above, keep an eye on your email and try not miss any survey invitation.

This could mean: offroad vehicle, high theft percentage car or fast, muscle car (even 2 seaters as a rule are more than four seaters, thats why cars like camaro's, mustangs, etc have a little backseat, cuz now it's not a "sportscar' as a 2 seater Porsche or something).  Did you increase coverage?  Most dealers or banks that provide a loan want to ensure that the car has plenty of coverage in case it's totaled, stolen, tampered with or whatever.  They will mandate full coverage as opposed to the State's minimums if you bought a car outright.  So, if you own it and have title, you could go with less coverage.  If you had a 1990 honda civic  for example and ou bought a new Jeep, your premium will be higher no matter where you go.  My personal example:  I have had "Cost-U-Less" brokerage that found the "cheapest insurance from their list of carriers" for me for YEARS (prob about 6 years).  I just paid the bill and didn't bother to shop around.  I was paying $161.00 per month.  i recently was doing some online gimmiky ads and filled out this thing to get free poins for a game i was into.  The ad was for State Farm, and guess what, I',m now paying $150.00 per month.  I have a sh%$^tload of more coverage AND roadside assistance AND renter's insurance AND my agent is down the street AND I have his cell #.  So, just because your rates went up dosen't mean you don't have a good deal. Some things to look out for are... Do they cover you on any car?  Do they use original replacement parts if you have an accident?  Just make sure you are comparing apples to apples.   The best price isn't always the best thing when shopping for car insurance.  Trust me.  I have been in 2 accidents and if you have low coverage they'll only pay a certain amount (mine was $5,00.00 and the accident for the other car was $8,200.00).  So, you could try esurance, I think they look for the cheapest online, or progressive is good too.  Again, progressive is good because they come to you for estimates and such.  Each company has pros and cons.  You need to find out if "cheapest" is what you really want.  I'd go cheap on something else in life and keep your State Farm if it was me =)

It sounds like they're playing games - and we're not talking Chutes & Ladders.<br>  <br>  To prevent foreclosure, have your attorney file a request to "produce the note," i.e., the loan document you signed for the mortgage. Nine times out of ten, the mortgage won't have the paperwork, as your mortgage, along with many others, was bundled, sold off, chopped up and resold to investors as CDOs - collateralized debt obligations. Now your mortgage holder ("mortgagor") is insisting you pay up, etc., while odds are good they no longer have the paperwork in their possession. Generally good for the mortgagee, bad for the mortgagor.<br>  <br>  Be aware, however, that this request is merely a stalling tactic; it will buy you a few months' time, hopefully during which you'll be able to get things squared away.<br>  <br>  There also exists the possibility something funny is going on at the mortgage company's end, too, whether it's someone embezzling funds or bookkeeping errors, or whatever. I'm not saying there is, just that there may be another reason why you're suddenly behind, all else being equal.<br>  <br>  It's my experience that a letter from an attorney to the mortgage company will cause them to sit up and notice really fast, and will hopefully prod a supervisor to look into the matter.

But in response to your point, I would have thought that a bigger problem is public servants, who are not only useless and incompetent, but command high salaries and even now that we are in a recession still think that they are entitled to massive pay rises and bonuses.    The fact is that a certain amount of middle management and administrative staff are necessary.  It isn't possible to have everyone in the company employed to deliver a service or make a product.  You still need people like finance and HR for the company to run, even though those people are not directly contributing to the revenue that is being generated.  If you can't understand that, well, it's just as well that no-one's asking you to run a business.    And who is "overpaid"?  Many people in the UK don't earn enough money to live on.  Last year I earned 30,000 which most people would consider to be a good wage, but when you take into account that I am a single person living in London, it actually doesn't even pay for rent, food and transport.|`|cdf9bde60acfd0a622e4bbdccdc9e515aa	Obviously companies think they have some sort of worth or the positions wouldn't exist in the first place.

CW7Sej2uaa	Grandma should be eligible for medicare.  You and your Mom should not be responsible for her bills anyway, unless she is listed as a dependant on your insurance.  <br>  <br>  Sorry about you father, some hospital will write off debts as charitable contributions.  Contact the hospital and ask for a social worker to help you figure out if they have any programs like that.  Other than that it looks like bankruptcy is probable.  I think that you can have a notation put on your credit report that it was a medical bankruptcy so lenders will be a little more lenient.|`|hYDCgs9Xaa	Sorry to hear.  I agree that you should look into Medicaid depending on your grandmother's age.  Also consider talking to a lawyer - it is not always the case that a spouse should have to pay for all medical bills if their spouse passes away.  Personally I would always put a mortgage payment before paying a medical bill but you may want to talk to someone at the ambulance company and/or hospital to see if they can lower the bills too.|`|Gun3UGzaaa	I am sorry for your loss.<br>  <br>  If your dad was at work, his medical expenses should have been covered by workers compensation - a form of insurance his employer had to have for him to work.  Also, even if he didn't have health insurance, his employer probably had liability or accidental death and disability insurance on him.  <br>  <br>  You mention that there are two houses involved (mom's and dad's).  If your parents are divorced, your mom is not responsible for her former husband's bills.<br>  <br>  Your grandmother's ambulance ride should be covered by her health insurance or by medicare if she is over 65.<br>  <br>  See a lawyer for advice with your dad.  You mom, if she is responsible for the hospital bills, may want to look into filing bankruptcy.  It will give her a clean start.<br>  <br>  As far as grandma, go to see the social worker's office at the hospital and ask about reduced price free or charity care.  All hospitals are required to offer reduced price care, especially to someone as low income as your grandmother.  Your mom is not responsible for grandmom's bills.<br>  <br>  Good luck.|`|2N6oTOLQaa	Sorry to hear about your rough situation.<br>  <br>  If your father was at work when the accident occurred, then every dime of his medical expenses should have been paid by labor and industries insurance. Neither you nor your mother should owe anything. You need to pursue the details of that. <br>  <br>  As far as your grandmother's bills, there are about 4 options I can think of. <br>  1. Medical insurance if she has it<br>  2. Medicare if she is old enough<br>  3. Medicaid if she is income eligible<br>  4. Private assistance from the hospital and ambulance company if they offer some sort of income contingent programs.|`|dPLkNRNuaa	Grandma probably qualifies for Medicare or has health insurance.  Her bills need to be filed with that.<br>  <br>  As far as your dad's situation, his estate is responsible for those bills. If he and your mother were divorced, then she is not responsible for the bills. If he was injured while working...then workers compensation should apply.  Again, if he has health insurance his bills should be filed with that. <br>  <br>  In the end....there is no free health care in the US and this issue is much more complicated than you realize.|`|75a51a8a2488a3df797e37d0a25b999caa	How old is your grandmother? Maybe she can get Medicare (if she's old enough) or MediCal (depends on her income). Ask the hospital if they can give you info on who to call to see if she qualifies.|`|yQdA5rHnaa	only way i know how to not pay for one is not to ride one, but since that isn't an option I think you may be stuck with a big bill.|`|AA10604086	How about grandma?

hYDCgs9Xaa	Do you have the agreement that you signed which basically renewed your lease? Whatever you signed should explain very specifically and in detail the terms of how long you are signing for and what early termination entails.  If what you signed does NOT detail this then I would say you can definitely involve a lawyer.  If it says what your landlord told you in the agreement (and you signed it) then I doubt you can do anything to get out of it except what it says.  Good luck!|`|bVROvLNSaa	Check the landlord tenants act that is in effect in your jurisdiction- then you will know what your rights are.  You might also go to see a lawyer with your current agreement, and ask the lawyer to give you independent legal advice.<br>  <br>  There is NEVER an excuse for rudeness.|`|RZzMse3Haa	This is why you should always read thru any agreement BEFORE signing it!  It was your responsibility to find out what you were signing. Yes they should have made sure you understood, but they clearly thought they were renting to adults and probably did not realize that they had to hold your hand thru the entire process.  People expect other people to read what they are signing and don't always think to explain everything.  There is nothing you can do but pay the penalties to break it.  This may not be fair, but they have the law on their side in this situation.|`|869328b32e030e92c8be316b6b2b83ebaa	In law you are legally bound by the terms of the agreement that you have signed.  You cannot turn round and say that you did not know what you were signing because you are deemed to have full knowledge when signing a document.<br>  Take your tenancy agreement to the citizen advice bureau or a lawyer for advice.|`|2627cac9473c3926f2a6376b47a7cb53aa	If you signed a lease then to get out of it you have to pay the penalty fee. You should have realized that you were signing a lease binding you to the rental for a certain amount of time.<br>  If you feel cheated i'd speak with a lawyer. maybe you were mislead. you have rights as a renter.|`|Hae8acnpaa	Didn't you read what you were signing?|`|b9e9c92194bfc25f5e3efd7384d43e45aa	Go to the Citizens Advise Borough (CAB)  and explain everything to the person there.  The answer could be in the agreement you signed.  Always be careful what you sign.  Your landlord seems to be a bit of a bully.<br>  Good luck.
e9c3e42d64ceb58add3e61412e049096aa	OK, workers comp is a type of policy.  Minimum premium, for contractors, for workers comp, depending on what exactly they are doing, is going to be anywhere from $500 to $2,000 a year.  MINIMUM.      Then, there's liability.  Again, depending on what they are doing, it's going to be AT LEAST $500 to $2500 a year, OR MORE.  Even with $15000 in payroll.      You will find the workers comp and liability policies, through a LOCAL, independent agent.  Most standard companies will NOT write a contractor who hasn't had at least three years of prior insurance - you'd prove it, by providing documentation in the form of loss runs.|`|RNqRnG86aa	Find an independent agent in your are by using this link -    http://www.iiaba.net/agentlocator/findag...

Obama and congress are asking employers to compensate by withholding less money from everyones paychecks. If they don't decrease your withholding, it means you'd get a $400 or $800 bigger refund at the end of 2009. <br>  <br>  There are various numbers floating around regarding how much per paycheck this comes out to. Most people are saying its $13 per paycheck but it really depends on how often you get paid because the $400 or $800 savings is going to be spread across all your paychecks for the rest of the year. The $13 per paycheck figure is based roughly on someone who gets paid every 2 weeks.|`|OA3Mgsuaaa	You get $8-13 a paycheck.<br>  Unless you are a congressman. Then you get $65.

If you can work, you can use the job centre.<br>  Also, since you seem to know about computing, you can try temp agencies to help you start with temp work, this can lead to a permanent job once your CV becomes more interesting being filled with the temp positions you made.<br>  <br>  2- Look in the local news paper or at the news agents for room for rent, that would be the cheapest option for you as a start.<br>  <br>  3- As for getting a Macbook,  I would think even a normal Laptop can help you for a start, have you tried FreeCycle ?<br>  <br>  Freecycle is a yahoo groups that people advertise fro free what they want to give away, from furnitures, to PCs or laptops. all you have to do is search for the word FreeCycle and your City or Town name, register and start getting emails of Offered and Wanted into your inbox.<br>  <br>  On the Freecycle of my area, there is always some computers going around <br>  <br>  Hope this helps,|`|jcElGnNwaa	you can get work help from your local job center, for help with looking for a job.  also go and see your local housing officer and register for housing they will have flats furnished for young people,you should be able to get some housing benefit as well,so for now dont worry to much about having no money,they will help you sort it all out.  also you could go to your local libary to use there computers its all free ,  good luck hopes this helps,|`|haliiw1Baa	Yes, you can use a job centre - Head to your nearest one, and don't worry about not having been there before, just ask one of the assistants to show you how to work the job search machine, its really easy. <br>  <br>  As for where you go after you leave your grandad's, i'm not sure anyone can help you with that apart from your family and friends.<br>  <br>  you could also book an appointment with a Connexions advisor, <a href="http://www.connexions-direct.com/" rel="nofollow">http://www.connexions-direct.com/</a> - they will be able to give you proffessional advice and assistance.

How much that is varies by location, from 2-10k though.|`|2N6oTOLQaa	I would have a lawyer who specializes in landlord tenant disputes review your lease and your situation. In many cases lawyers will do a free review of your situation. If they think there is a good chance of winning a lawsuit they will usually take the case on contingency, meaning you don't pay the lawyer until you receive your settlement. <br>  <br>  Keep in mind that with a lease the only thing you might accomplish is gaining the right to break your lease. You probably won't get any type of payment from the landlord, but you might get the court to order them to let you out of your lease early without penalty.|`|RT8LZy7gaa	First, do not stop paying your rent.

You'll receive an eviction notice, blah, blah blah.  They legally have to kick you out in a court of law.  So when they do take you to court, bring all of your documentation (with dates properly noted), and state your case to the judge or presiding judge's assistant.  They will decide on how it should be carried out - which will probably be in your way.<br>  <br>  Just remember, landlords do not have to renew your lease.  Landlords extend leases to you based upon their own free will - they don't have to renew.  So if you do meet them in court, don't expect to get a lease renewal.<br>  <br>  If you want to stay in your place - I suggest calling a meeting with them now to get this worked out before it comes to be much more out of hand.  You need to state your terms and reasons and they need to as well and then you meet.  Have someone come with you as a witness or bring a digital recorder to record the conversation.<br>  <br>  Always back-up your back-up.

HFlytHlRaa	The difference between 4-year CIS and a typical (I assume a 2-year?) Tech degree is someone in CIS typically does coding of some sort, albeit in software or web application and they're usually in high demand.  Someone with  a tech degree typically fixes computers, diagnosis errors in computer, might work at tech report for a computer company, etc. It's more hardware based.    Somebody who can code (CIS or CS degree, preferably with a Bachelor's or a higher degree) will be in higher demand and will usually make a much greater income than someone who does tech support. While they're both in technology, they're very different.    I think the best example is:  A person with a CIS degree might design software that Microsoft uses, work on internet security for a bank, or develop online games for Nickelodeon.com.    A person with a Tech support degree might work for Dell and help people who are having  trouble with their computer over the phone, might work with Best Buy to come fix computer's at someone's home, might start a business to refurbish old computers, etc,    It depends on what your personal interests are - software (CIS) or hardware (tech).  There's also Computer Engineering which focuses on actually creating and designing computers: i.e. you might work with Apple to develop a new iPod.    Decide what your interests are and go from there.

I can tell you that in CA Allstate's auto rates are generally more competetive than Farmers..|`|1NEbsemjaa	It actually all depends on the type, age, and condition of the car you are trying to insure and your personal driving record, age, sex... you should get a quote from both companies before you decide. also, I have AAA and they are a really good company and my rates are pretty low. you should try them|`|yrTHiuF5aa	Farmers<br>  financially stable company|`|guLbTHeDaa	if you want to save money you shop around for price and allstate  is one insurer out of about 200.<br>  <br>  Some people charge you for this information!|`|WQlDxHFxaa	farmers|`|stEFmt1qaa	Yes Allstate is better than Farmers.

These results r based on capital cities.
MmTe8W8uaa	All health insurance premiums that you pay (except by payroll deduction) can be deducted as medical expenses on Schedule A if you itemize, are not reimbursed, and do not deduct them elsewhere.<br>  <br>  If you are asking about the self-employed health insurance deduction, although often (and incorrectly) claimed by independent contractors, that deduction actually applies only to a health insurance plan that is part of your business (independent contracting), not an individual plan or the university health plan.

qWytoOMmaa	Your best bet is to go to www.mass.gov/dua and search "unemployment benefits".  Once you search that search out "full time student".  Mass unemployment laws are somewhat complex, and being a full time student is not the only issue that will affect eligibility.<br>  <br>  Regarding being caught, there are criminal penalties that can land you in jail, cause you to pay substantial fines and disqualify you from any further benefits.  I believe you can get a preview right on the DUA website of recent offenders.  It would be my guess that in this economy there is a team of people that are aggressively looking for this type of activity.  You roll the dice!

49740c9daeea677fc86801fb2b3f41deaa	The city records are the legal records on the house size.   You need to get that fixed.   The appraiser (any appraiser) can not legally appraise on a different square footage then what the city knows about.   It sort of makes it look like you did an illegal addition, which means that it would have to be torn down anyway.<br>  <br>  Fix the county records and ask them to reappraise when you have completed that.<br>  <br>  The bank does not have to take any appraisal other then theirs, but it is obvious why theirs is low, you have a problem with the public records.|`|AA11173563	make sure the square feet are correct first as he may have used public records and not the actual home size|`|44209bed877d82f066bd0e61b8c60fa0aa	well, maybe you can benefit from the affordability & stability plan, if you have less than 20% equity there is supposed to be a plan to help.|`|d9f5eef57376876109b9a113a7c9af2eaa	Get a second appraisal.|`|IO1JRcl0aa	First thing,  what someone offers you for your house has nothing to do with the appraisal, that's just pie in the sky. 2nd thing a 2nd full bath is only worth around 4K on an appraisal. 3rd appraiser must measure the home and do not use county records for square footage unless it was a drive by appraisal and no lenders are ordering drive by appraisals. 4th appraiser must use arms length sales and not shot sales or foreclosures, unless they are doing a REO foreclosure appraisals. 5th lenders are requesting the appraiser not to use any sales for comparables older than 90 days. 6th every homeowner thinks his home is worth more than it really is. 7th no lender underwriter will accept any research you provide and you do not have access to MLS. Be careful about what you stir up, if county records do not show the additional sf, bathroom and 2nd story, then who ever did the remodel did not get permits and if the county finds out they may raise your taxes and make get permits and inspection for everything that has been updated. <br>  <br>  The only thing you can do is get another appraisal. As you stated I think my house is worth much more, every homeowner thinks this.<br>  Every appraisal is based on facts and must stand up in a court of law and not based on I think. Sorry buts its a decling market, 3 out of every 5 appraisals come in below what the homeowner thinks its worth.|`|Uc7GM2Rnaa	did you get a copy of the appraisal?   are the sq footage figures right?  what are the comps?  Did the appraiser come to your house and do measurements or was it a "pencil" search?  Unfortunately, years ago the appraisers would disregard "distress" sales when looking at comps.  Foreclosures are considered "distress" sales.  Today they count and distress sales play a major factor in determining home values.<br>  <br>  You can pay for a second appraisal, but before you do that, have the appraisal you have in hand analyzed.|`|9b9f75545eba3c982f4a21bb3a585952aa	You can dispute it by getting another appraisal.  If the other one comes back at roughly the same amount as the first, then you are just in denial about the value of your house.  If it comes in higher, then you are right about getting low-balled on the first one!
kifwyOgKaa	That is something to two of you should have discussed before moving in together. <br>  <br>  The lease does not state who pays how much, and the landlord will only care that the entire rent is paid on time.  <br>  <br>  Unless you signed the lease, you do not have a right to read it, if you are unhappy with your situation, and your name is NOT on the lease, simply move as the contract you signed for your roommate probably isn't legal anyways.|`|RZzMse3Haa	There is no law stating that roommates must pay the same amount.  This is not regulated.  If the original lease is just with him, then that is his personal business and you have no legal right to it.  Also it sounds like you are subletting.  Be very careful, because that is typically illegal.|`|pOHVhVqgaa	Morally he should feel like crap for doing that to you but legally I dont think he HAS to, plus you already signed that other contract with him, sad to say looks like he took advantage of you. I would try and move ASAP!!!|`|cxaUYijFaa	no you signed the contract! sorry!|`|Uc7GM2Rnaa	You have a right to abide by the contract you signed.  You might have a right to move out.  As your name is not on the lease, the lease is non of your business.  <br>  <br>  In the same way, your roommate has no right to look at the mortgage and payment terms the building owner has and to calculate his "fair and just" rent from those terms.  He rented the apartment because he felt he was getting good value and a fair deal.   Just as you entered into your agreement.<br>  <br>  If you were paying $1000 for rent and then found out your roommate was paying $4000 in rent.. would you demand to increase your rent to $2500 to make it "fair".... I think not.

f6ZFjatlaa	I spoke with a Nurse Manager just yesterday and she said to start applying about 2-3 months before graduating. She's already in fact hired 3 students that don't graduate until May of this year and it's only Feb. She said that the students who wait until after they graduate have a harder time finding a job because so many other graudates are looking at the same time.|`|897e7a393eaaa2e07450e638d086ce46aa	I would say sometime in eairly Fall. Lots of hospitals will hire you and pay for some fees as long as you promise to work for them for a period of time. Right now, nurses are in huge demand as the baby boomers age and need more healthcare. Many hospitals are even offering sign on bonuses from $2,000 up to 20,000 depending on training, skills, experience, and education.
vG0tsqJtaa	I would ask the site for permission.  Just because it doesn't say there is a copyright doesn't mean there isn't.|`|jrEsCWwxaa	Under US copyright law original work is automatically copyrighted.  The copyright mark is no longer required.<br>  <br>  Contact the wholesaler and find out who owns the copyright.  If they are using a copyrighted image with the permission of the artist or photographer who created the image that does not grant them the right to authorize anyone else to use the image.<br>  <br>  So you must then contact the copyright owner to determine how much you will be charged to use the image and what the limitations on your usage will be.<br>  <br>  By the way, just because you can copy an image from a web site doesn't mean you have the legal right to use it.  There was a case reported on www.photo.net that was decided last year where a business copied a photograph without permission and the courts awarded the photographer several thousand dollars.<br>  <br>  Hope this helps<br>  Jerry-the-bookkeeper|`|6mA2rgzEaa	As long as you can right click and save the image, i think it will be ok. If they didn't want the pictures used, they would block right clicking or put a watermark on the image.

mCxhX9tMaa	You don't say a lot about what you or the company actually do, so it is hard to be to precise, but a couple of ideas...    Director of...  for example 'Director of Technical Services'    Manager...    for example 'Sales Manager'    Owner/Operator...  this is signal that you are small business, but not necessarily a bad thing.    Just a few suggestions to get you going.  Good luck.

Then you should go online to find their local offices or a link to submit applications for employment.    Additionally, you can search your local newspaper or the pennysaver.  Also try yahoo jobs (hotjobs.com), careerbuilder or monster - to at least get a feel for who might be hiring and at what starting pay rate.    Hope this helps

pAy88Vk0aa	If you put great content on your website it will increase your traffic due to relevance for what you have and what people may be searching for. A player with no videos is just a browser....so it really matters how you TAG your videos and how you embed this player in your page in a way that the crawlers can identify what the content of this page is so that they know how to categorize it into their search results.    So having a customized video player is nice for site appearance, given the content is relevant to  your site and people might link to it based on quality, then yes it can't hurt and could help improve the site's overall traffic. I wouldn't spend tons getting someone to do this who is trying to sell you on something.|`|W8Uf5LsAaa	Having customized video player does help in link building and also in generating traffic to the site.  If the video is embedded properly and satisfies the search engine principles , then there is also chance of having good positions in the search engine results pages.
Gun3UGzaaa	This is from an article on high performance teams from Harvard Business School.  Make sure you give a citation so they don't accuse you of plaigirism.    Susan Heathfield stresses the ultimate goal of team building is "striving to improve results for customers" (Heathfield, 2007, p. 1-3) and suggests 12 Cs for building a team:     Clear Expectations - Are expectations communicated effectively?   Context - Team members must know why they are on the team.   Commitment - Team members have to be motivated to be on the team.   Competence - Do all team members feel the team is comprised of competent people?   Charter - A team needs a charter and assigned responsibilities.   Control - A team needs to be empowered to bring about the results described in the charter.   Collaboration - Team members need to understand team development, roles, and responsibilities.   Communication - Team members need to communicate with each other and the organization effectively.   Creative Innovation - The organization must truly want change to be affected from this team collaboration.   Consequences - Both rewards and risk must be clear and the team members must feel accountable.   Coordination - Teams must understand the leadership hierarchy and ultimate customer.   Cultural Change - The organization must recognize the differences between the traditional business hierarchy and the team building model.|`|Pjm9pg7iaa	The "team" must have something they agree upon. Or some goal. To reach the goal they must all work together.  It can not be reached if only a few do all the work..
