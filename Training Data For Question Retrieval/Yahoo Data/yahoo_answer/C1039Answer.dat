n3R9Ywrtaa	one dot low bounce. great lob wedges. unless very low handicap , not advisable on 56 degree wedge. 2 medium bounce. for gap wedge best choice . great tight fairway. as well as rough . 3 dots 14 degrees on sand wedge. fluffy sand . deep green side rough . softer fairways. one dots skilled players. two dots okay. three dots . private courses . not for muni courses|`|l5fjVSkBaa	one dots skilled players. two dots okay. three dots . private courses . not for muni courses|`|8Nlcxf3Waa	The red dots simply tell you what type of bounce the wedges have.  The bounce that I am referring to is the way the wedge gets under the ball and through the hitting area depending on the turf you are playing on.  If you are playing on dry turf with very little resistance to the club then playing something with low bounce will be better.  On the contrary if you are playing in a swamp then a wedge with high bounce in theory will work better.  As for the dots on the Cleveland Wedges, the fewer the dots the lower the bounce.  I suggest playing with two dots (medium bounce) to save a few dollars.

Most professionals work behind the desk at local courses and clubs making a modest (to meager) salary.  <br>  <br>  In otherwords, if you don't play college golf competitively, you won't be teeing it up for big money.

Just play with some other people, adults, and see how you match up. <br>  <br>  But the big thing is to test yourself. Keep track of each round you play, your putts, Fairways, and green in regulations, and then try to do better every time. Play against yourself.. Work hard and get better and better.<br>  <br>  And be honest to yourself..  If you miss the putt you work on it until you make it. But don't just say oh I'll just count it.. It can only hurt yourself.<br>  <br>  <br>  Good luck kid.. Golf is one of the biggest loves in live.

5xu0KnkGaa	3 months ... that is a great score !!!<br>  think about it this way ... out of 18 holes ... if you putt a little better or get lucky, it's easy to take 6 strokes less., if you practice your short game, that's another 6 strokes and before you know it, you're below 100.<br>  short game is where you can knock off strokes.|`|hNfOgNNBaa	I would say less than 20% of all golfers can break 100 on a regulation 18 holes (6000 yds +).  And some golfers spend their entire lives golfing, never breaking 100.<br>  <br>  I think I heard that only 10% can break 90.  <br>  Keep it up, you're doing great for as new you are to the sport!<br>  Golf is the greatest game ever|`|qivUrJ3Naa	If you've only been playing for three months, that is not bad.  Your goal should be to break 100 in your 1st year.  Good luck.|`|JSGLKnA4aa	yes.|`|U6BMxOYYaa	wow!!!<br>  you doing good my friend..<br>  just like what have i told to all of my golf students before:<br>  focus,swing,and alot of practice!<br>  good luck to you..|`|PWIcfCbxaa	I tried it once with my bf and got 130 so id say its good.Hes been playing about a year and got 90 something but after 3 months not sure what he shot,.|`|7PRPZeBwaa	That's pretty bad.<br>  <br>  Its ok. There is still bowling.|`|YwM8Z14oaa	That's not bad at all.. Just keep working and it will slowly drop down.<br>  <br>  <br>  Good Luck!|`|VM2b7gq8aa	o god no u sux|`|OYYYNCyCaa	was that for 9 or 18 holes<br>  <br>  does not matter<br>  <br>  one easy tip when start playing remove your driver and tee off with a 3 wood yes you lose a bit of distance but you will get it in play more <br>  <br>  dont get down on yourself take your time and your score will drop slowly but you need to keep working on the small things all the time|`|sBrummATaa	yea dude thats really good. thats what i shot about 6 months into playing golf, but i did start in the winter so take off a month or two from that, but yea thats good

AA12400459	I used to wear RGP lenses. I never swam with them in competition (when in high school / college) because I never wanted to risk having my goggles fall off and losing them. Once I was out of college, I wore them all the time in competition, because (I told myself) if my goggles fell off, I'd simply stop the race. So you need to ask yourself what you would do in the event that your goggles came off in the dive. (Rare, but possible, right?)<br>  <br>  On the other hand, the only time I lost a lens was at a swim meet -- through the process of taking them out / putting them in. (At the time, I didn't have a pair of glasses. Crazy, I know.)<br>  <br>  Now that I wear soft lenses, I don't worry. The replacement cost is no big deal.<br>  <br>  Good luck with your decision!|`|t4xtqjjfaa	Wearing contacts while swimming is ok, i always leave mine at meets and at practice you should be fine if you are wearing goggles|`|sCehoTIsaa	Should be fine with goggles on over the lenses.|`|AA11337952	I've swam with contacts before competitively. Unless chlorine is an extreme irritant to your eyes when you swim normally, it's not that bad. If you're going to wear them, put them in and leave them in. Popping them in and out all the time would not be very helpful at all. I also fail at doing any backstroke competition, because unless I have my contacts in, my sense of position is way off, and I start drifting side to side, but that's just me.|`|elLgFNkiaa	I've been wearing contacts for 10 years now and am legally blind, I also rely on my contacts alot.  I would ask, do you wear them often as it is?  If you're wearing goggles and you can deal with water in your eyes, I would say you could wear them the whole time honestly.  It isn't good for your eyes necessarily but I understand the situation and one day wouldnt kill you.  I have swam in my contacts every single time for at least 7 years and have never had a problem, they have never once fallen out.<br>  <br>  If you choose to take them in and out (or if not actually), bring rewetting drops for your eyes, I dont understand why you would take them out inbetween <br>  <br>  Good Luck with your race and i really hope this helps!|`|dba6798daedd01dcb233c8a115096ed5aa	Yeah, it's okay to wear your contacts because you'll be wearing your goggles while under water. <br>  <br>  I wouldn't recommend taking them out and putting them back between races. That'd just get annoying and you have a higher chance of getting an infection. Hope this helps.

Don't forget that this current series is being played on 'featherbed' pitches and there are a few of the West Indies batsmen who are pretty good.<br>  <br>  Perhaps Mahmood would be a boost, Panesar definately isn't. He just isn't a test player. He can't bat or field and is only a very average bowler. He is, to be honest, an embarrassment. I always used to think Ashley Giles was lame but at least he could bat and field close in if needed.<br>  <br>  When selecting a bowler for a test match you have got to imagine how many wickets he might possibly take and this number must be ideally in double figures - Monty wouldn't take this many in a season bowling this kak he currently sends down.|`|Leoc8rlGaa	In an ideal world?<br>  <br>  Harold Larwood<br>  Fred Trueman<br>  Sid Barnes<br>  Hedley Verity<br>  Derek Underwood<br>  <br>   From today's cannon fodder (sorry, bowler's at England disposal):<br>  <br>  James Anderson<br>  Stuart Broad<br>  Mark Davies<br>  Andrew Flintoff<br>  Graeme Swann|`|bN6S0FJEaa	From current players:<br>  Harmison<br>  Anderson<br>  Flintoff<br>  Sidebottom/Broad<br>  Panesar/Swann|`|dG45JMYaaa	If possible as of '09 England would consist off  -<br>  <br>  *Matthew Hoggard*<br>  <br>  *Monty Panesar*<br>  <br>  *Andrew Flintoff*<br>  <br>  *Simon Jones*<br>  <br>  *Steve Harmison*

tjJOSW16aa	Great frickin question, although most people are going to say Andre the Giant and with good reason, until Wrestlemani III the only "loses" he ever suffered were from count out or submission, he hadn't ever been pinned in the WWF in the 15 years prior to that match.  He is the reason wrestling is what it is today, in a time of local territories fighting over all wrestlers here in the states and around the world he became the first real international superstar, everyone knew who Andre the Giant was.  The only negative thing about Andre's career in the WWF is they never took advantage of his all around skills and unfortunately most people remember him as a heel, when in actuality he has a face for most of his career and really only became a heel to put Hogan over, and pass the proverbial torch.  <br>  <br>  There is another wrestler that comes to mind as well and that's the Paul Wight a.k.a The Big Show.  He shows a lot of similar qualities to Andre and both suffer from being to big, I mean really Andre only had one WWF title and that was vacated the night he won it, and The Big Show has had 2 WCW titles, 2 WWE titles and 1 ECW title but the overall title reigns of all these less then a year and it's less then 6 months if you throw out the ECW title which he held for 5 months.|`|Lv89kHKpaa	Vader, Bam Bam Bigelow, Big Show, Kane, Undertaker...There's so many.|`|Ys3je8ueaa	yokozuna numa 1 by far mark henry is 2 cuz who cant he pick up|`|XewbBwvKaa	Andra the Giants....he was just plain old entertaining to watch!!!|`|1z7M3Tntaa	Kenta Kobashi a legend and has had plenty of memorable macthes in Pro wrestling NOAH his macth againt misawa is one example.

He was one of the best, he had one of the longest undefeated streaks in history and he put on one of the most legendary matches with hulk hogan at wrestlemania 3. it's a shame he only held the world title for about 3 seconds.|`|Z5bH2LOZaa	For me there are two.

tjJOSW16aa	I'd go with Giambi, Konerko's coming off of an injury to his lower back and  there's no telling what playing the field is going to do to inhibit his play to begin the season, Giambi is back in a familiar setting and will put up very similar numbers this year that he did last year, and probably with a better average.  Giambi is also probably going to bat clean up in the A's lineup and will have better protection with Cust, Holiday, Cabrera and Chavez, where as Konerko has an aging Dye and Thome but will get good protection from Quentin providing he can come back from the wrist fracture.|`|4uSRVZNNaa	both good choices but I would go with giambi here.  he will revert back to his gap power and hitting to all fields now that he's back in oakland.  I think he will be the more reliable bench guy.|`|04bc2c48d79f30c010ba500a390cb62daa	I would go w/ Paul. Oakland is not a hitters park. Jason's numbers should drop some.

YbOGOnroaa	It depends really. If you are playing against good players, I highly doubt they'd deliberately shoot the ball at you as they can be sacked and it'd be an extremely stupid thing to do. I've been hit in the face by a handball by a state handballer and trust me, it's not as bad as you think it is. I personally would say safety first but in some cases, all you have to do is be brave.<br>  <br>  Also, train your reflexes so if the ball is going towards your body, you can block it. Trust me.
Xd2MYQEsaa	What we tell the kids we teach varies on the age, but, there's a couple ways to do it.

If I'm strapped into a board (wakeboarding and snowboarding) I keep my right foot forward, but when I'm open on a board (surfing, skimming, skateboarding) I'm left foot forward.|`|7sqpiGgoaa	well your a trans-footer offcourse (how cool am i, i just made up that word)|`|AA10058369	This page here may help you decide goofy vs regular.<br>  <a href="http://www.frostyrider.com/boards/index.php/topic,234.0.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.frostyrider.com/boards/index....</a>|`|CL040gRjaa	If you feel more comfortable riding "Regular" on a snowboard, then you should stick with that stance.|`|E638ukebaa	You skateboard goofy.<br>  I surf goofy.

ea1fe0ad90bfbd91db5c9fac7052e639aa	Any completed scorecard from an official game will affect your handicap. Not just competitions.|`|hNfOgNNBaa	It will go down because I think the system drops the worst and best scores (out of the 10).  Therefore, one of your 82's will hold up and therefore factor is to your current 19, to produce a lower index.  Competition cards are inputed into the system by tournament officials (secretaries) and therefore require no posting from yourself.  ANY scorecard you post will factor-in as long as it is not the best or worst of your recent games.|`|W2R8TRDmaa	I'm not sure I understand the question.  You have to post all scores, competition or not.  You actually are supposed to post a score everytime you play 7 holes or more.  For example, if you played 7 holes and quit, you would estimate your score on holes 8 and 9 and post a nine hole score.  If you're a 19 and you post two 10 over rounds, your index will come down, unless the course rating is super low.

Your body is quite resilient and will adapt to aerobic running if you give it a chance even at any age or if you have never exercised.<br>  <br>  To improve you general fitness you should be aiming at jogging for over an hour.  Since you can't do this now keep this as one of your goals. Walk and jog and also add skipping and bounding drills for warm up exercises.  Do dynamic stretching for warmup.  Add resistance training especially for your legs, arm, back and stomach.  <br>  <br>  Try to cross train for instance swimming, biking, XC skiing, hiking, dancing, etc to keep your routine fun.  Add more challenging courses such as XC trails and hills to your workout as you progress.  Speed play drills at least once or twice a week would also help in your fitness.  You can walk the majority of the way and sprint 50 meters periodically for example every 8 minutes.  <br>  <br>  Other general fitness tips is eating a balanced meal.

6099a6cf10dd1a0b4a82921e69638406aa	dude the best way to make yourself fast is by muscle training ,it may sound all complicated but its actually very simple<br>  i guess u might have a good stamina, now to develop ur leg speed u gotta improve ur calf muscles<br>  It's very important to remember that when you do any exercise for your calf muscles you need to do them correctly. If you don't you will just be wasting your time. <br>  <br>  #1.Standing calf raise: This calf weight lifting exercise is a basic calf exercise that works your gastrocnemius muscles. <br>  <br>  Anytime you are performing standing calf weight lifting exercises you need to ensure that your legs stay locked at the knees.<br>  <br>  If you can, try and use a standing calf raise machine for this type of calf weight lifting exercise. If you can't, then you can do the calf weight lifting exercise while holding a dumbbell in one hand and balancing yourself with the other.<br>  <br>  Stand with your toes on the block of a standing calf raise machine and your heels hanging off the end of the platform. Hook your shoulders under the pads place your head between the shoulder pads and straighten your legs, lift the weight clear of the support. <br>  <br>  Do not hunch but rather keep your body straight. Keeping your legs straight, lower your heels and the weight as far as possible toward the floor. Then rise up on your toes as far as possible until your calves are fully flexed.<br>  <br>  Hold the contraction briefly, then slowly lower the weight back to the starting position.<br>  <br>  #2.Seated calf raise: Any exercise for your calf muscles that you perform in a seated position with your legs bent will target the soleus muscles. Calf weight lifting exercises such as this are by far the best way to develop your soleus muscle.<br>  <br>  Sit on a seated calf raise machine and place your toes on the bottom cross piece, locking your knees under the pads so that the pads rest on the lower part of your quads. And place your feet about shoulder width apart with your toes pointing forward.<br>  <br>  Slowly lower your heels as far as possible towards the ground. Then press up on your toes until your calves are fully contracted. Flex hard at the top then slowly lower the weight back to the starting position. And repeat<br>  <br>  Try not to rock back and forth, but instead keep your calves working with a steady controlled motion.<br>  <br>  #3.Donkey calf raises: Calf weight lifting exercises such as the donkey calf exercise is excellent for working your gastrocnemius muscles with some work being done by your soleus muscles. <br>  <br>  With any exercise for your calf muscles like this, you will to use a donkey calf machine or you will need a partner to help you or a weight belt to attach extra resistance.<br>  <br>  If you are using the machine begin by placing your middle back on the pad and the balls of your feet on the plate.<br>  <br>  Now allow your heels to drop as far below your toes as possible, getting a full stretch in your calf muscles. Next slowly rise up as high as you can on to your toes until your calf muscles are fully flexed.<br>  <br>  Hold this position for a second then slowly reverse the procedure to the start. Then repeat.<br>  <br>  If you are performing this exercise with a partner stand with the balls of your feet on a block, with your feet shoulder width apart. Bend over and rest your hands on an exercise bench or something to keep your upper body parallel to the floor.<br>  <br>  While keeping your legs straight have your training partner sit up on your hips and balance in place. From this point on the rest of the exercise is done the same way as if you were using a donkey calf machine|`|kkQHX0qdaa	well i know one way, don't pull your hands up into fists, make them go straight down , i guess it makes you go a bit quicker

k5AMJNRPaa	Ricky Hatton will win this fight.  There is a lot of hype surrounding Pacquiao following his win over De La Hoya, but much of it is unrealistic.  <br>  <br>  Manny Pacquiao is a great fighter but he is completely out of his element in this match up.  I consider this fight to be the FIRST REAL time that Pacquiao is moving up from 135lbs.  De La Hoya was flat and gained virtually no weight between the weigh in and the fight (145lbs.) when he met Pacquiao in the ring.  Pacquiao was as sharp and showed as much heart as ever, but De La Hoya was acting funny that night.  (Oscar took a dive to avoid the top welterweight contenders but thats another discussion..)<br>  <br>  I think Ricky Hatton might be a bit taken back by Pacquiao's speed and awkward style, but Pacquiao is going to be in a for a HUGE surprise when he feels just how hard Hatton hits.  Believe me Ricky Hatton is a beast at Light Welterweight and naturally much, much bigger than Pacquiao than most people realize (take a look at their shoulder frames).  <br>  <br>  Hatton has some handspeed and boxing ability himself and will simply absorb any punches thrown his way by the smaller Pacquiao.  If Hatton makes it his fight and smothers Pacquiao while banging to the body, then its all over.  Pacquiao has a chance if he continually boxes form the outside darting in and out, but knowing Pac Man he will want to go toe to toe and things will get ugly. <br>  <br>   It is an unfair comparison to compare Floyd Mayweather to Pacquaio in this fight with Hatton.  Mayweather is much bigger, pinpoint accurate, and his ability to adapt to other fighters styles is simply brilliant.  Pacquiao is a gutsy warrior with great handspeed, accuracy, but lacks the defense of a Floyd Mayweather.  Pacquiao can go toe to toe with all these great attributes in the lower weight divisions, but when he's in there with a beast of a light welterweight in Ricky Hatton....Pacman's corner better keep that white towel ready...|`|kqP7GwOcaa	Yes, Pacquiao in fact is in my opinion a heavy favorite against Hatton and it's about an even money bet that Ricky will be the one that gets KOed.  It will boil down to whether Pacquiao can withstand the pressure early that Hatton will bring.  If Ricky can take Manny's early power shots and get inside to make it a brawl, Pacquiao is vulnerable and Hatton can beat him, but is is certainly no easy task.  This one is going to be an epic fight, it's a must see for all boxing fans.|`|4d7b908cfe24bf3f1177a5cca13feb22aa	He sure can, but he's going to have to avoid taking hard shots early, and avoid taking the big shot that will put him in trouble.  Hatton is not going to be lethargic and hesitant as ODLH was.|`|74d926bbb467954124e827daf8495652aa	Yes. That doesn't mean he will but he can possibly win.  I think Ricky is going to surprise everyone and outbox Manny and stop him somewhere around the 8th-9th round.  Manny will drop back down to 135 after this fight and look for the third fight with JMM.|`|AnaI7OBJaa	I think this is a real 50/50 fight. Ricky holds the size and weight advantage, but Manny has the speed, and I believe the better boxing brain.

IWM1khX7aa	In my opinion, Frank Lampard is better than Gerrard without this stat.  <br>  <br>  150 IQ though...that's amazing.  I don't think Gerrard would get 120.  Frank Lampard is more of a leader than Gerrard and Lampard creates more chances.  <br>  <br>  Without Lampard, Chelsea would not be that good as they are now,  because Lampard is the heart and soul of Chelsea.  Sure Chelsea has Essien and Ballack but they don't create chancs often and they don't have great leadership skills.  Gerrard...it would be a big loss at Liverpool but I think Xabi Alonso when he's healthy fills the job real well, so Gerrard is not as more needed at Liverpool than Lampard is to Chelsea.<br>  <br>  He's great at creating chances and leading teams because he has a 150 IQ.  It makes sense.  IQ isn't everything, especially when you're actually playing, but when it's 150, you're going to play smarter and that's what Frank Lampard does.|`|aGXankr2aa	I'm no Wayne Rooney fan or Paul Gascoigne fan, but surely these two players alone disprove that I.Q. has any influence on ability.  Easy way to decide, if Lampard had been in a Liverpool shirt would Liverpool have won any more trophies, highly doubt it, whereas the other way around, Gerrard in a Chelsea shirt and I think you get my drift, he would've undoubtedly improved Chelsea.|`|vHpoGpQYaa	Thank you for the article but even without reading it, have always believed Frank Lampard is a much better player than Gerrard in all depts - now we know why Lamps is so intelligent in his play and why Gerrard still continue to blast balls high up into spectator stands; perhaps he is making it up with brawn than brains.|`|n2HDjZtraa	Even if he had an lower IQ, Lampard would still be better than Gerrard by providing 20 goals a season from midfield, along with an incredible tally of assists as well!!! Last year Joe Cole was voted as Chelsea 07/08 player of the year. This year, it looks like to be none other than Frank Lampard!!!|`|C7lQScROaa	I think that Steven is a genius with the ball...the IQ isn't important in football, otherwise the player in my yahoo! avatar there wasn't considered one of the better in the world!|`|WZGYjD9Qaa	I have always thought that Frankie had something special compared to the others players!!! :)|`|K0hUnyfUaa	They both suck, bt Gerrard is better that Lampard.|`|8QxVjXUxaa	it certainly is|`|F3faAmsSaa	i Like Lampard And Chelsea but does iq  matters or your skill|`|CrWcnQx7aa	not really....... until, we know gerrard IQ scores.... he could probably have higher IQ than lampard..|`|Lr75hENEaa	i think lampard is better anyway|`|duJgBxUoaa	But at the end of the day..Gerrard is still better.|`|0dTXkBopaa	He was better since the day he was born.<br>  <br>  He reads the game, pops up in crucial moments, <br>  he is just smarter in different ways<br>  <br>  lampard scores more, sets more up and is just 100% better.|`|RSJbqioUaa	I've posted this already ;)<br>  <a href="http://www.personality-and-aptitude-career-tests.com/iq-rating-scale.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.personality-and-aptitude-care...</a> look at the bit that says 140 or over.<br>  Our Frankie's a genius! Scientifically anyway :)|`|cjNtjOZtaa	He is still ******** though, as is Terry|`|tIBZ9Gi3aa	Damn,and I thought I had a high IQ.

VSAVy0M7aa	They are the minor leagues of the Asian teams.  If you notice they have not fared well in the Little League World Series either.
WKJhQL2baa	My observation: team Chinese Taipei consists of a bunch of young and inexperienced players who got plenty of WRONG baseball attitude. <br>  <br>  If you have watched the two games (vs China or S.Korea), you would know they didn't play baseball with the kind of passion and energy that team Japan or Korea has.  <br>  <br>  Look at Team Japan and how much the country values the WBC. There are 5 major leaguers on the team.  There is no way such an unprepared team like Chinese Taipei can beat great baseball teams like Japan. USA, or  Dominican Republic, not even by luck.<br>  <br>  Baseball is all about talents, practice, and right attitude.  I cannot see any of those on the young and inexperienced Chinese Taipei team.  <br>  They have serious issues to deal with after these shameful losses.|`|M0eyMvqlaa	Develop some better players, because they're not good enough to keep up with the competition.
3yqCKPzVaa	Judging by their performance today, I'd say no...

Along with the main problem Barca has been experiencing for the last decade -- Defence!|`|TxVAXBpTaa	Yeah.. It could be and now Puyol is out with an injury.. so Barca defend is now getting weaker..
cd8fb1a8552a48786a6354cd99f5f249aa	i would prefer seeing him in Spain, i wouldn't mind if he moved to Barca but only if he is guaranteed a 1st XI spot.<br>  no place for him in Real Madrid since they have Raul, Huntelaar, and van Nistelrooy when he's back.<br>  Manchester City have enough players, they're only waisting money, who spends 20m on De Jong? i wouldn't spend more than 10m on him. this will have a long-term effect on them, spending all this money now will make them regret it in the future when they don't have any money, plus they're a mid-table team, if they make the top 4 big players would think about it.<br>  Chelsea have enough options, Drogba, Anelka, Di Santo, and Kalou too.<br>  United have Rooney and Berbatov.<br>  i wouldn't want him in Liverpool anymore since Benitez is spoiling himself with all the flop signings, plus the bad performances.|`|WSZVJRIwaa	It's probably going to happen. Completely due to Valencia being in as much debt as they are and not being able to pay player wages. Even the construction on their new stadium has been suspended. The better question is how many players other than David Villa will they have to sell off to reduce this debt. It's an unfortunate situation that other clubs will exploit.|`|UTFceSi0aa	if i were him ... maybe i will go for the money ... but manchester city... it wont be a big club in the future. so whats the point. their manager are not very good either..so whats the point. i rather stay at valencia with my friends..|`|TxVAXBpTaa	Well. Valencia virtually have no money left.. so they have to sell David Villa to survive financially..|`|pSOmwwlIaa	No. I would like to see him play for a more bigger team like Barca or Man U or Bayern Munich.|`|F3faAmsSaa	No Way!<br>  Such talent should not be wasted in a ( No Offense) puny team like Man City!<br>  He is [ahell lot] better off in valencia<br>  -though he shoulda been in BArca Or Real Madrid atleast|`|M0B1uMzXaa	I'd rather see him in Valencia, then Barca.

b30195e932765839f31a572f8d05c0f8aa	Bonds will be 45 years old in July, he is overweight, and his knees are gone.  He is Barry Bonds in name only with his skills, no doubt, greatly diminished.  Why would any team want to associate themselves with Bonds and all his baggage?  Even a skilled younger Bonds wouldn't be enough to get the Orioles to the playoffs, so why should they take that risk?  I don't believe the Orioles would ever take a chance on Bonds.|`|iPWKzzQtaa	And why don't you become the GM.<br>  <br>  Bonds at 44 would be a risk....the DH position actually demands 30 plus HR's and 100 RBI's...Bonds might not play everyday.

That's almost an insult, the guy owns 2 minor league franchises and has numerous charitable and business activities.....no I can't see that.<br>  <br>  As a manager? If Ripken wanted it he could get it...probably by serving 1-2 years at AAA or less. But would he want that? The man has a family...I doubt if he would want to go on the road again.

The Orioles have a specific quality in a person that they generally look for and Barry might not fit that mold.|`|WaaFCtuOaa	I go to the Oriole games even though I am a Yankees fan but I live close enough to take a drive up 95 to watch them & other teams play but I say the O's have some decent talent but for them to win the AL East, they need for Angelos to sell the team to a new owner cause the O's were at one time a real competive team & it seems as he took over the team went down hill & haven't had a winning season since I think 1997.  I like the O's but not when they play the Yankees(sorry)|`|04bc2c48d79f30c010ba500a390cb62daa	Its going to be a long time before the O's win the divsion. So I say yes to sighing Bonds to get butts in the seats. Get some money, as long as they don't overpay to sign him.<br>  <br>    I dont Ripkin Jr wants to manage. He knows what his dad went through and i think Cal Jr. is finished w/ baseball. he is enjoying his time w/ the love ones.

tjJOSW16aa	Well what you're starting to see is a new evolution in the sports entertainment industry,  a few years ago it was taboo to mention that Triple H was even a member of the McMahon family it just wasn't something that was done in the business, the incidents you are referring to with DX were part of the storyline, DX against the McMahon's, when the WWE was trying to relive the '90's.  Now all of sudden it's o.k. to mention the inter family tie ins which I think brings a more personal level to the show.  And remember he's not doing it because of Vince, he's doing it because Orton put his hands on the Games wife.|`|tl1HTJRwaa	I hate the fact that they do stuff like that pretend that it never happened and a year down the trackthe people are friends again|`|5FypDafWaa	i know the wwe does not recognize stuff like that though.|`|ukBULJtmaa	Well, its his gimmick.

r5AMG8g7aa	If you don't care what color your belt is, why are you asking this question?  I think you are not being totally honest here. It does not matter what belt you are or how long it takes to get to black belt. The only thing that matters is what you know, understand and can do. Any time your goals are on belts instead of skills you are in the wrong mindset. Belts can do nothing for you. Only your knowledge and skills can help you. Besides belts are relative. A black belt in one school might be equal to a green belt in another. Belts are good only to compare someone to another person in the same school.  Besides black belt means that you have only been taught the basic moves. The real training starts at that point.<br>  <br>  ****************************<br>  <br>  EDIT: <br>  <br>   I received an email from the asker. It seems that I jumped to a conclusion here that was wrong. For that I'm sorry. The asker does  understand the situation better than I thought. Their concern was totally directed to one area. They want to know if others would look down on them if they were to attain black belt in a relatively short time.   As I said in my reply, I never look down on anyone because of how long it took them to obtain their belt. I tend to judge each person based on what they know, and what I see them do. After all some people progress faster than others.  I apologize to the asker and wish them the best!<br>  ******************************|`|6sTsDvKmaa	McDojo is if your school charges extra money to allow you to train every day, and if your instructor has no clue what they're doing but do a great job of pretending that they do.  <br>  <br>  If you have an instructor that truly understands the art that they're teaching, and has a good way of passing that knowledge on to his students, then yes, a smaller dojo would make for more one-on-one time.  You would progress much faster than a class with 30 students.  <br>  <br>  Training every day will absolutely show your dedication, and will allow you to get your belt faster than someone who only comes once or twice a week.  However, be wary of overdoing it and running out of steam.  Training every day is a lot of work, both physically and mentally.  Not to mention it increases your chance of injury.  But hey, if you can keep it up, why not?|`|FPuFDrZDaa	If u don't care what color belt u have- why are u asking how to get a blk. belt faster? And for that matter- why attempt to be a martial artist?<br>  <br>  I guess it would depend on the school u train at and their own testing policies. John mentioned that u can't legally be a black belt before age 16, cuz ur hands and feet become registered weapons. This is completely untrue. U don't have to go down to the courthouse and show them your black belt to get a permit to practice martial arts or anything silly like that. It is true, however- that if u get in a streetfight, and u injure your opponent using martial arts, u'll prob. be punished more severely (kinda stupid, but it's true- why it's ur fault that some idiot challenged u to a fight and didn't know how to defend himself... I dunno- but that's the law, I guess). But again- it all depends on the school. I have an 8 and 9 yr. old nephew and niece that are both considered blk. belts by their school, which is built around and caters to kids. Truthfully- though they know their forms and/or knowledge, and can break a board- they don't have blk. belt technique. But they're still recognized as blk. belts, and it means alot to them. I personally trained with (and was somewhat trained by) a 10 & 12 yr. old brother and sister who were both recognized as blk. belts by the Grand Master (who flew from Hawaii to fla to test them) of my school. Their technique was perfect, they practically spoke korean, they were far more mature than any other 10-12yr. olds I've ever met, and they passed the same power tests (proportionally speaking, of course- they didn't have to break through 6 boards or anything like an adult- I think it was 3) as the adults. Their dad was even a 2nd deg. who taught at the school; so maybe it's just the way they're raised... I dunno. But those kids were def. blk. belts. The important thing is not to be too concerned with WHEN u get your blk. belt- but HOW u get your blk. belt. Would u rather GET a blk. belt from a school that will give it to u just cuz u showed up to enough classes? Or would u rather EARN a blk. belt from a school that only gives it to students who DESERVE it? Aside from that- most schools (just from my experience) don't mind if u show up for class everyday, as long as you're paying your membership fee... the more practice u get can only make u better.|`|13360f8150c9715c66a1ecb9c2002c6aaa	Training everyday ?Unless you are an absolute klutz I would think you would be graded faster than someone who shows up once or twice a week .I consider people who train once or twice a week spectators unless their results show they are doing a lot of "home work".|`|4d13f34c6f100ed6121b3208fd700099aa	well it was once the way that a master would train students 1 on one or in smaller groups.|`|ehGZwdAtaa	It all depend how old you are, you have to be 16 in order to get your black belt. If you dont have to be 16 then your Karate style isnt very good. You have to be 16 because legally your hands are now registered as weapons.if you arent over 16 then you could work your way up to the last belt, most likely brown|`|lmLle24Iaa	You should certainly learn more (faster)...you can always go to a martial arts supply store and buy a black belt if you want one really fast.There is probably some journey versus destination lesson in here also.|`|YDpT2ClBaa	i agree with pugpaws2, he has some good advice.<br>  <br>  whats the hurry to get to black belt.<br>  what matters is how hard you train, having 5 people in the dojo and training poorly will do you little good, in accomplishing your goal. you need to be diligent in your training, practices consistently and train hard.
M0B1uMzXaa	I think English football depends on violence and huge bodies, and has a lot of scoring opportunity due to small fields... I don't like easy soccer like that. Italian soccer is violence too but they are more defensive and a lot of defense kills the excitement. So, I'd go with the moderate league that has some good amount of everything that is appreciated in soccer.<br>  <br>  1. La Liga (Spanish Soccer)<br>  2. Calcio (Italian Soccer) -- I support their national team more though!<br>  3. Premier (English Soccer)|`|3hulUBOkaa	1: English because they have more foreign players but if u are talking about English players then they wouldn't top my list.<br>  <br>  2:Spanish because their league build many talented young lads.<br>  <br>  3:Italian ,it's ok but there's less foreign players|`|IhX8Hujuaa	Definetly the english football at the moment iv always thought that...and by the way im a liverpool F.C supporter ! ! !|`|blMdI0bCaa	english football|`|H7AcXAyaaa	All 3 are fantastic but I think England is just a little bit ahead of Italy and Spain at the moment.|`|exARv7Bmaa	The EPL has the best marketing (meaning BS) and is better presented but for excitement, goals and technical performance on a consistent basis, La Liga is far superior. Serie A and the English League are about equal except for presentation.|`|lwXEK969aa	Excluding foreign players, the Italians are technically superior to both the english and the Spanish.|`|0ytjj1EGaa	Serie A|`|YeXcm7Sqaa	None.... all football is crap|`|50UbJp14aa	English football gets my vote|`|9PaNK21haa	Well my answer is that each league is different in many ways. Firstly english football is very fast and very competitive, and also very physical, and also very technical at the same time. But for italian football they plan out everything and it goes very slow but they have nice passing and skills, spanish football is like italian football but at a faster pace and spanish football is mostly about skills of the individual|`|cz1nh74yaa	Define English, Spanish and Italian<br>  <br>  If you mean the Leagues then they aren't really seperated by country due to the amount of foreign players <br>  <br>  I mean what is the "English" league?  The Prem is far from English isn't it.<br>  <br>  Therefore I'll assume you mean which country as a nation plays the best football.<br>  <br>  Well, Italy are reigning World Champions so that makes them best, followed by Spain who are current reining European Champions and then England who are...er...just **** really.<br>  <br>  BTW all the English people on here saying the EPL is just slightly better aren't giving any justification in their answers.|`|lz7SGG7Paa	italian football is too tactical for me, it takes a long time to score. english is too physical, there's no flair. i prefer la liga and its passing game. i like to see style and technique. honestly, the other leagues bore me.|`|4glmxCa7aa	Best Players: England/Spain<br>  Best Fans: Germany by a mile<br>  Best Style: England/Spain<br>  Best Stadiums: England|`|8Nov6Xaoaa	English Football!|`|yhPLditYaa	Deutsch Fu?ball!!!!!!!!!!!<br>  german football! !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!<br>  absolutely with no doubt!!!!!!!|`|ijU6Qd3naa	english|`|guAFsmNjaa	man u is easily the worlds best team so i would say england

42uw2Xauaa	netball is really easy for me <br>  <br>  Netball is a non-contact team sport originating from the United States similar to, and derived from, basketball. Invented in 1895 by Clara Gregory Baer,a pioneer in women's sport, netball is now pre-eminently played as a women's team sport in Australia and New Zealand and is popular in the West Indies, Sri Lanka, and the United Kingdom. Over 20 million people play netball in more than 70 countries.<br>  <br>  Objective<br>  The objective of a game of netball is for players to pass the ball to a teammate within the opposition's goal circle and score goals. The team with the most goals at the end of a game is the winner.<br>  <br>  <br>  Court and its dimensions<br>   <br>  A netball court is divided into thirds.Like basketball, netball is played on either a hard or soft court with scoring hoops or "rings" at both ends. The court is slightly larger than a basketball court, being 30.5 m long and 15.25 m wide. The longer sides are called "side lines" and the shorter lines called "goal lines"or "base lines". Court markings are no more than 50 mm wide. The court is divided into thirds which regulate where individuals of each position are allowed to move. A 90cm-diameter "centre circle" is located in the centre of the court. At each end of the court there is a 4.9 m-radius semi-circular "shooting circle" or "goal circle" from within which all scoring shots must be taken. The goal posts are 3.05 m high from the top of the ring to the ground and have no backboards. The rings have an internal diameter of 380 mm and are located 150 mm forward from the post and are made of 15 mm diameter steel. Both the height and diameter of the rings are smaller than basketball hoops. It is possible to play netball using a basketball hoop but if there is any contact between the ball and the backboard, the ball is considered out of play. If a goal is scored off the backboard it does not count. Some versions of the rules allow a goal to be scored from a backboard rebound if a player who can catch the ball throws the ball in without touching the ground.<br>  <br>  Positions<br>  There are seven players on each team, who are given nominated, named positions (some junior/training variants have only five players per team). Each player must wear a "bib" showing one of the abbreviations below, indicating that player's position. Each player is only allowed in certain areas of the court: a player in a section of court that is not part of their playing area is deemed "offside". The positions are described below:<br>  <br>  Scoring goals<br>  By the combination of the above, only the Goal Attack and Goal Shooter are able to score goals directly. The job of the Goal Defense and Goal Keeper is to block the Goal Attack and Goal Shooter from shooting. A ball that passes through the hoop, but has been thrown either from outside the circle or by a player not the GA or GS, is deemed a "no goal". Furthermore, a shooter (GA or GS) may not shoot for a goal if a "free pass" has been awarded for an infringement such as stepping, offside, or using the post.<br>  <br>  <br>  [edit] Starting and restarting play<br>   <br>  A netball game in Australia.At the beginning of every quarter or after a goal is scored, play starts from the centre of the court with a "centre pass". These passes alternate between the teams, regardless of which team scored the last goal. A centre pass is made by a player in the "centre" position who must have one foot grounded within the centre circle. As the game restarts, only the player in the 'Centre' position from each team are allowed in the centre third of the court. When the umpire blows the whistle to restart play, players in the positions "Goal Attack", "Goal Defence", "Wing Attack" and "Wing Defence" can move into the centre third, where the centre pass must be caught.<br>  <br>  If the ball touches the ground outside the court boundaries, then a member of the team was not the last to touch the ball before it went out is able to throw the ball back into the court to restart play.<br>  <br>  <br>  [edit] Stepping, footwork, and passing<br>  Netball rules do not permit players to let their landing foot touch the ground again if it is lifted at all while in possession of the ball, so players can take 1.5 steps while holding the ball. Players are entitled to balance on the other foot if the landing foot is lifted. Consequently, the only way to move the ball towards the goal is to throw the ball to a team-mate. The ball cannot be held by a player for more than three seconds at any time, and players may not tap the ball to themselves more than twice ("replay"). The player cannot catch the ball, drop it and pick it up again; this is called a replayed ball. The duration before it is called a drop is determined by the umpire. These rules, combined with the restrictions on where one player of a particular position can move, ensure that everyone on the team is regularly involved in play.<br>  <br>  <br>  [edit] Contact and obstruction<br>  Contact is only permitted provided it does not impede with an opponent or the ge|`|urL4MGSvaa	Theres a NZ team called the tactics who play in the ANZ netball haha<br>  <br>  Or are you referring to the skills?

e14214cd011bc42845300008bc246d89aa	Dude above is wrong. A gun with a hop up has a little dial that you can turn which will give your BB's more or less of a spin when being shot out of the barrel. <br>  <br>  By spinning the BB as it leaves the gun you can get a bit more length out of the shot. But be careful you dont do to much spin as when you shoot the BB will travel a certain distance straight but then flick up.|`|Y4mz8BShaa	Younganuk is correct in what it does.

Take your time, look around most cities now a day's have at least two or three. Watch a couple of classes, pay attention to the routine, is it a good mix, do they cover how to take a guy down ( it has been my experience most only cover this a little)  then go into a ground game. Do they start already on the ground ? What type of strikes are they teaching ? Then once that part is over look at what you really want to focus on. Striking with some ground work to back that up or vice verse.

9f7c3a6b1c85a2b25fdaadcc6f4cc32aaa	#1, Webb is a dominating starter who scores well in every category and has no history of injuries. Pettitte is already hurt and Nomar is always at risk of being on the DL plus both are older players and that brings health issues even more into play. Chances are Nomar is nothing more than a bench player on most fantasy rosters so it basically is a Pettitte for Webb deal. Plus the guy with Webb would have to cut another player....that means maybe someone along the lines of Nomar in production.|`|sFNajygGaa	webb definatly<br>  he has more ks, and wins and a better era<br>  and nomar sucks so....|`|052d26a1fd638c07e65bdcdb7b5555e6aa	Webb is better than Pettite and should have a better year stats wise although Pettite back with the Yanks should get some wins.  <br>  The question is does Nomar as a first baseman up in years, a constant injury threat and not great numbers for a first baseman push up the value enough for Pettite to be equal to Webb.<br>  <br>  I would say no.  I think you can probably find a good FA first baseman that can equal Nomar's numbers.

It takes physios, doctors, coaches the lot to tell Federer not to play before he decides not to play. He doesnt just get this annoying little say bug or niggling little muscle tinge and say "Oh, i cant play". It takes more serious things to stop Federer in his tracks. Take for example lastyear or something he just came off a stomach bug and was out playing, so he really doesnt stop things at the drop of a hat.  <br>  The Author, you and everyone else who has their wide spread theories about Federer need to grow up. He is a professional athlete. His not like you or i who just play a weekend sport, train once - twice a week and have the rest off to recover. He is out there day in and day out doing what his doing. Their small injuries would be our larger injuries.<br>  "Why would you dare insult it?" Well why wouldnt you, he has an obligation to tell the press and media why he will not be playing. He doesnt have to sit there and say 'Im sick because i have a bug blah blah blah'. Federer is a decent enough sportsperson to come forward to the media and let his fans know why he will not be playing. <br>  <br>  You can rant and rave about how much of an unpleasant character Federer may be, but at the end of the day, people need to back off and realise that this guy is one of the Greatest Tennis Players to be walking in earth, so you need to back off and give the guy a break. He does everything he can to make his fans happy and he sure as hell wouldnt be sitting back smiling at himself for missing a tournament due to back injuries, illnesses whatever. He be sitting there spewing on the fact he can't be out there playing.|`|AA11218682	the roy emerson quote is a nice idea in theory but the fact is, federer has ranking points to defend and had too much to lose to take months off to get 100% physically right. so he maintained his schedule. he did not go on and on about the mono, but every press conference he went into had questions about it. so he talked about it. when djokovic beat him in the aussie open semis, federer said he just played a better match and played the big points better than him.<br>  <br>  lets see if roger somehow beats nadal at the french, will you resist going on about rafa's knees?|`|LALDdLkNaa	If Federer played emerson at his best it wouldnt have been a contest the modern day players are faster round the courts more stamina and much more powerful also emerson only managed 12 slams when the game was amateur and their where less good players around and Federer has managed 13 in the open era when the quality in depth in the game is much higher and Quality of tennis is higher then it was when Emerson was winning so to call him the great emerson when he is definitly not as good as Fed is ridicolous.<br>  <br>  Federer is very sporting very respectful and does so much for the game of tennis and has dedicated himself to helping out charities and is down to earth and modest about his achievements.<br>  Please give me one good reason to hate him he is respectful to his opponents and when asked about his matches he says what he thinks.<br>  <br>  Federer is not a unpleasant character but you certainly are.There are few people on yahoo who ill say that about but you are a bitter nasty hating piece of slime who is not a true tennis fan.<br>  Nadal and Federer are mates so why do the Nadal fans continue to attack Federer.|`|gCGbbIMcaa	I agree with you. During the Aussie Open not once did Federer complain about a back problem and he moved well on court, all of a sudden after he loses the Aussie Open, he needs to withdraw from tournaments as a precaution for his back. I was quite shocked, because he seemed perfectly fine and during his press conferences at the AO he said he felt fit and healthy. <br>  <br>  Theres no doubt he does have a back injury but to miss the davis cup aswell as dubai is a bit much, i think. I think maybe he wants to lay low after his defeat at the Aussie Open i think fed thought he had that grandslam title in his hand because Rafa for one was more tired (not matter what anyone says he definitely wasnt at his freshest after that epic battle with fernando) Roger said it wouldnt be a factor for Nadal but c`mon that semi final match had to have some effect on Rafa (as great as he is) Federer just didnt want to admit it. #2 i also think federer thought he had a slight advantage in that final because its hard court and its not exactly Nadal`s best surface so yeah thats what i reckon. <br>  <br>  Again im not saying fed hasnt got a back injury but for some reason i feel he could have played for his country in the davis cup i mean he`s not played in agess!! His back must be better now..... <br>  <br>  i`ll answer more later, im watching nadal in davis cup!! :)|`|i0e9DY9uaa	Federer never talked a lot about his illness,he even tried insisting that he played well but lost the match,but he never complained  about the mono.I had seen stupid questions on this section so many times but this one just broke the record. Even when he does play great but loses media and people like u write him off and insist that he should retire.he was interviewed and was expected to explain to his fans why he was not like before...he simply informed people of a news which was probably already out. and if u read such sites read the comments too. people had mentioned that :"how could Nadal use those bandages the entire year and still play,does that mean if I lose it was because I am not completely ok?"  I am not saying that it means so but if Nadal starts losing the same nonesnone comes about him.   <br>  Final comment is that : In psychiatry it is said that the mind collects the data it likes,and I guess your mind is collecting the data about "people are realizing fed is unpleasant"<br>  <br>  the guy is nice just leave him alone,if he had  won the AO no one would say these things !!!|`|PWIcfCbxaa	he didnt use excues he doesnt need to use excuses for being number 2 in the world.<br>  edit - wow you really are one sad person ive just seen youre questions and it seems you have alot against federer and always ask nasty questions about him throughout the year.<br>  Do you spend all youre time sitting at home making nasty comments about Federer and posting lame questions or is threr a point to you.|`|A1ohtlWsaa	nice rant but you hating Federer because his season was plagued by illness last year would be like me hating Nadal for his knee problems.If the press ask Federer why he hasn't ben playing as much and why hes missing tournamenyts Federer can't just lie and say cos I dont want to play tennis anymore hes gonna have to give the media the real reasons as the fans of his deserve to know whats going on with him and why he misses parts of the calender.<br>   he doesnt go on about it the press just keep asking him.<br>  like with Rafa Nadal we always hear about his knees so does that make him nasty and unplesant.<br>  Answer no it doesnt as its he press who keep going on about it. not nadal.<br>  Its a fact that federer had mono last year and a fact that Nadal has a knee problem but neither player uses this as an excuse for defeats but negative press people feed on this info to give them a bad image and then we have morons like you filled with an irrational hatred for a great player who believe it and come on here asking stupid questions.

9f7c3a6b1c85a2b25fdaadcc6f4cc32aaa	The same as the last 40 years. Millen was possibly the worst GM in the history of professional sports but his record pales in comparision to the Ford family legacy. They hate winning, if they didnt why would they keep Millen around for 7+ years? They have no desire or concept of what it takes to win and frankly wont allow it because winning is expensive and the Lions are a finacial tool for William Clay Ford (the car business isnt really helping him at the moment). It is easy (and correct) to blame Millen for the latest failure but we cant blame him for the 1960's, 1970's, 1980's or the 1990's (they won their only playoff game ever in 1991, I guess that is the highlight besides Barry Sanders). We can however see that the Ford family is the one constant link to complete and total failure and there is no reason to believe they desire to be good all the sudden. The only reason (and trust me, Ford is sick about letting Millen go) he got fired is because ticket sales have suffered and Ford realized that with the horrendous start the only way to win some fans back was to fire Millen. Now some foolish souls will run to the ticket window and pad Fords pockets....what motivation does he have to suddenly want to win? |`|5LEo6EpCaa	First get rid of Kitna.  Maybe try to get Cassel or draft a young quarterback.  Secondly, they need a speed back and a power back.  Maybe try to get a lot more draft picks and trade away everybody and start a new team.  Keep their role players such as Johnson and Williams but they need to rebuild.  I say if they do this give them 4-6 years and they might make the playoffs.  But I mean, they really do suck.<br>  <br>  BRONCOS ALL THE WAY|`|5c3d44702d97332ecbba6dd75bc1a532aa	Let's see..the same Lion team ownership that hired Millen in the first place?...The same ownership that has won one playoff game since 1991? Nothing changes with the Lions and nothing will change unless and until the Ford family is no longer tied to the Lions.|`|768016bc44c71089995675cddeaf10c7aa	Slightly better, but they still wont be able to overcome the fact that they're the Detroit Lions.|`|UfWx65PTaa	this year him getting fired is worth a couple of wins- it will be much of the same for the next few years|`|SycxOGN7aa	Well I am a Dolphins fan so I really don't have much room to talk but if they bring in some douche like Randy Mueller who doesn't know how to run a team or draft people they will continue to suck. Just really depends who they get to fill his shoes. |`|sgwVDBXWaa	About the same as they did before Millen came along, they have many more problems than just him|`|AA10500250	They can't do any worse !
AA10456571	10|`|3Bpkrfucaa	In my opinion, I think the Raiders will lose.

A perfect QB rating for the game to boot? It is great and all that you love your team but seriously they will need a matchup against a little "better" team to have a legit shot at winning. They have no offense and the defense pays the price (I actually think they have some talented D players but the QB and WR are terrible at the moment, that leaves the D on the field all day long). |`|0d52aa68c8e99256b8164858da82b92faa	42-0
9f7c3a6b1c85a2b25fdaadcc6f4cc32aaa	Gonzalez and Williams. Both are being actively shopped by their teams and both teams have so much as admitted they would move those guys. Plus there are some very good teams that need those type players so surely they will come up with a match. The Chiefs are willing to move Tony out of respect for what he has meant to them and the Lions are willing to move Williams because he is quickly becoming a locker room problem and wil leave via freaa agency at the end of the season anyways (they need to salvage something from yet another 1st rounder that is loaded with "potential"). Garcia will likely start for the Bucs today and with their QB issues they need to play out the year with him for better or worse. Merriman cant be traded, it is against the colloctive bargaining agreement to deal a player on injured reserve. Anderson has a monster contract so nobody is willing to gamble that last year wasnt a fluke. The Bungals cant find a taker for a malcontent who has produced way more with his mouth than his hands and legs (Johnson) plus he has a big contract as well and it would make little sense to move T.J. because not only has he proven to be their best receiver he also is a solid citizen, something hard to say about very many Bungals (on the other hand, that might be the reason they would trade him, who wants productive players that stay out of trouble?). |`|0d52aa68c8e99256b8164858da82b92faa	Gonzalez|`|e49064124148a09ea71e47cc14257a0aaa	No one, it is really rare to see a trade in the NFL during the season.|`|eZsBPaRSaa	Gonzalez cuz hes on the trading block and maybe chad ocho cinco cuz he might not wanna play there anymore cuz the team is crappy

wRe6CGbDaa	Tiech has nothing to prove in the game of 7s.He has archived everything, he properly feel stail at the top and need a new challenge,BUT a new blood is due and no one better than Rushy.<br>  <br>  I disagree with getting players from so called super rugby to play for NZ 7s, why? other guys who cant get into so called super rugby deserve thier luxury trips away too and a chance for them to see the world.You cant have them all,so play super rugby or play 7 rugby.<br>  <br>  7 rugby is a lot more entertainment than super crap.<br>  <br>  we hear about injuries & players unavailability, other countries also have the same problem its not just NZ.|`|VaeNOdckaa	Tich needs the best players there, injury is taking its toll on our best players, but its Super 14 is now first priority for NZ Rugby, and thats why 7s will always get the leftovers of NZ Rugby players. Wouldnt matter who is coaching the 7s, they dont have the cream of NZ players.|`|DQQULvT7aa	Is it the coaches fault that a player drops the ball with the line open??<br>  <br>  Me thinks not!!<br>  <br>  Wales were more passionate and committed! End of story!|`|Vvj6zitMaa	I think anyone who has been in the same management/leadership job will, just as a natural part of the job, wain in their ability to see out side the box to adapt to new vision and ideas.  It would look like to me that the rest of the world has caught up. The fact that the team is not winning consistantly as it was may be revealing that it is time for a change. Tiech seems to be a professional and as such will be going through self evaluation and will probably make the hard call if necessary. Also it would seem that he not getting the talent he used to get available to him. Some of those past team even I could have probably trained them to beat a majority of those teams that played several years ago. Other teams seem to be taking sevens more serious as well so its now alot hard to shine as a coach.|`|fPyRsRcXaa	What Bollocks. Tiech is a great coach. The fact is everyone else in sevens has caught up to us and if you understand the game you will notice that almost every team has the same pattern of play now, with some subtle differences. That is why Fiji are no longer the great side of the past because 7's is no longer an individual sport but has become a true 7 man team game. <br>  <br>  That Wales team is very good how can you say they are average. Some of those players are excellent individuals and they even had Rhodri Mcatee on the bench, he would be in our NZ team without a doubt.|`|zfTX7XkHaa	statistically speaking .. its the worst performance in 7's world cup from nz ... injuries and off forms would contribute to that fact ... super 14 players not takin the call up as well as it clashes w other commitments ...every other  quarter final team excluding argentina had beefed up the squad w 15's or ex 7's players ... unless they were restrictions on squad selections for the entire tournament .. <br>  he is the current most consistent coach in the entire nz rugby  roster ... in the last 10 years easy ....... numbers dont lie.. they do from time to time fluctuate ....|`|ASbdsqFSaa	I disagree. Like the Australian cricket team our sevens team is going through a rot. Doesn't mean we need a change of coach at all. We can't win everything all the time.|`|0xfVyxxIaa	Rugby 7's makes my rectum prolapse.|`|MoWvfTrnaa	no, Tiech is the most successful 7s coach in the world. The kiwi team is just goin through a rough patch no different to any other sports team every now and then. Give tiech time to improve the team and see what happens, maybe not this season but hey theres always next year!|`|5963777c1326f25763b8e30c1e4286ffaa	Yep my initial thoughts are wales beat you..and whether you want to stick the boot into your coach or whether you think they are average or not congratulations are in order.<br>  <br>  Thems the rules.|`|HWmjIOaBaa	Tiech is a legend!!  In NZ, Sevens is like the "poor mans" rugby game compared to the 15 aside one.  They continually get their players yanked out of their team to booster NZ sides (Super 14 & NPC) with no regard to the disruption is has on them.  The player turnover for the NZ sevens team is atrocious.  Every other country rates and values their team, NZ treats theirs like a donor squad.  And yet, against the odds, they do very well.  They loose, they go down, and then they slowly work their way back up again.  And its all thanks to Tiechjens!!  <br>  Any other country would be thrilled to have him as a coach!  Hes the most successful coach in Sevens history.  We dont give him enough recognition!!<br>  <br>  I can't wait for the sport to become an Olympic event, then they and especially Tiechjens will get the backing,support and recognition they deserve... gulp!  I just hope hes not too old by then!!!<br>  <br>  One more thing, they never moan about loosing their players to the 15 man game, they have always been generous and grateful to the NZRFU, a shame its never been reciprocated!|`|PXP85IPfaa	No, he shouldn't. I think that the NZ rugby public has been spoilt by the success of the last ten years. No other rugby team at 15 or 7-a-side, in any competition, can come close to the consistency of the NZ sevens regime under Tiech. We have won the IRB World Series 8 out of 9 times.<br>  <br>  Anyway, I can think of another NZ rugby coach that was upset at the QF stage of a World Cup and kept his job.

If you look through his history of HS, College, and NFL (although his career has not ended) he has never won a BIG GAME. He never won a championship in HS, College, and has yet to do it in the NFL. So I say that it will never be HIS year to win it.|`|54829a0d90aea63a9069ce53404f3084aa	not a colts fan here either. if i had money on the game against baltimore, i dont know if i could root for the colts. i think that the field of teams this year is so random that anyone could win it. i think the colts have about as good a shot as any team out there. i think the ravens might take the superbowl (ps-im no ravens fan either!)|`|5cf958774d9053fb2f7a6cc82b39d667aa	Sorry but not me...........Manning is a choker........Maybe they'll have someone on the sidelines for him who knows the Heimlich Manuever...........He's not a team man and if they lose this weekend he'll waste no time throwing his teammates under a moving bus...........CAT<br>  <br>  webmaster@bobblesandmore.com|`|d878c17b9c764fac45264992ea0853ceaa	Not me I think Peyton is going to end up like Dan Marino,all the skill in the world but no superbowl ring.|`|e654abb783996b9fe82d4e6802814fe0aa	Peyton is like Michigan State:  he always finds a way to lose it.|`|9f7c3a6b1c85a2b25fdaadcc6f4cc32aaa	I cant agree with you. It has nothing to do with Manning, it would be great if he could win the big game and get the rid of the unfair scrutiny but very good playoff teams are very good at exploiting other teams weakness and right now the Colt defense isnt capable of keeping them in a game. Right now the Ravens are playing at an incredible level and I cant see how the Colts will win some of the key matchups. I do think if a team can score on the Ravens it will be Peyton Manning but I also think the Ravens have the type of offense (while not great) that will present enough matchup problems that the Colts wont overcome them.|`|AA11899537	NOT  HE'S A WHINER

9f7c3a6b1c85a2b25fdaadcc6f4cc32aaa	Keep Freel....it has only been what....5 days since the start of the season. Seriously Freel is a much better option, for one thing he is eligible at several positions and that alone can make the difference. Also and most importantly is Castillo has a very long history of leg injuries so it is a matter of time before the wheels arent healthy again. Last Sept. he sat out almost the entire month (during the playoff strecth....very bad timing) with not only a knee problem but an ankle problems as well. Just relax and give Freel time to heat up....it isnt surprising that he has struggled a bit in this cold weather, players that rely on their legs generally dont get off to great starts.|`|9svou8znaa	Keep Freel. He's much younger and better. Castillo is getting old and wearing down.|`|48c8c5c2886375b731522d38fe5716d0aa	FREEL.

If he isn't avaiable then keep Freel. Yes, Castillo has done more but, in the long run Freel will top him. And Freel can play more positions which, makes him more vaulable.|`|lXewgk31aa	Freel will have the better stats........|`|Be5nM1T2aa	Hard to say, but if I had to pick I would go with louis castillo.

9f7c3a6b1c85a2b25fdaadcc6f4cc32aaa	The player with the 1 has first option followed down the line to 12. If 1 uses his waiver option he becomes number 12 and everyone moves up 1 slot. So if you have 1 use it very wisely, make sure you are getting an upper tier player or down the road you will see someone get frustrated with a really good player and you will have no shot at getting him. If you are number 12 then make claims every time you think a guy can help and is a better option than what you have, you wont get a lot of them but you might as well try.|`|AA10785898	The 1 gets it.<br>  <br>  12 is the lowest waiver position.|`|1cf2805acf6eb32ad1493b60bce469dcaa	Number 1has priority, then 2, 3, 4, etc.......|`|61d5d86fb6258ff3dc64f852fc6b993aaa	#1|`|db31437d04de02c61463c1fd0d6601f2aa	The waiver designation was initially determined based on who drafted first in your league.  This would give them the 12 ranking while the one who drafted last gets the first waiver opportunity.<br>  <br>  To answer your question, when a player is put on waivers (which means he was dropped from his previous team's lineup), anyone can try to add him to their teams.  So lets say all the team managers would try to add him to their teams, this would bring about a "waiver request" that would be pending till the day that the player who was put on waiver's "clears waivers" and becomes a free agent.<br>  <br>  The team with the highest waiver priority would get the said player (waiver 1) even if all the team managers put up a request.  When this happens, the player's whose waiver designation was one, becomes 12.  12 becomes 11, and so on.<br>  <br>  Hope this helps.
9f7c3a6b1c85a2b25fdaadcc6f4cc32aaa	He has the tools to be a very good starter and so far in the minors this season here is how he has done:<br>  <br>  4-0,  0.29 era (yes that is correct, stupid good!) 46 Ks in 31 innings and only allowed 12 hits in those 31 innings .<br>  <br>  Realize that he isnt facing minor leaguers now but he was pretty dominant in a couple of spring starts where he faced lineups with plenty of regulars hitting against him. He is likely to be this years version of Cole Hamels his rookie year, lots of great starts with a couple games where he will get rocked but he will strike out a ton of hitters. As for the college thing...a lot of very good major league pitchers have average college numbers mostly because of the aluminum bats, they tend to make stars out of guys that cant hit with wood.|`|my3QEgBaaa	idk but hes on my fantasy team|`|7dYTMKO0aa	I hope so cause I'm starting him in both my Yahoo! fantasy teams tomorrow.
9f7c3a6b1c85a2b25fdaadcc6f4cc32aaa	False.   Because of the intense media and better talent it is getting far more unlikely that we will see 2 unbeatens in the Championship game so not that every game doesnt matter but more so the timing of when you win (and more importantly when you lose). An early loss is easier to overcome, voters have a chance to see you later on in big games and they tend to overlook the early loss, lose late in the season and it seems to have a huge effect of where you end up playing you bowl game. Unless they find some sort of playoff format there will always be big debates on who deserves the shot at the BCS championship game, that is what makes college football so fun to watch (passion among fans is pretty intense....how many "overrated" questions do we see posted every day here?). We need to remember these ar still basically kids (18 to 23 year olds) and they have a lot going on, they cant possibly bring it every game.|`|fUKWTjjiaa	true, and it would be stupid not to think that, ohio state, they lose to usc, who at that time was in the top ten, and they drop from like 2 to 13, of course every game matters (thats probably a bad example because of usc's upset, but you get the point). <br>  <br>  False because, if your not trying to win a national championship, then yes you can lose 2 games and still make it to a bcs game|`|XJUwu98Laa	False. If Michigan runs the table their gonna be in the ROse Bowl despite losing to Utah and Notre Dame. Non- confrence games are just exhibitions.|`|8iJAVJfaaa	As long as everyone else loses one game, you can afford to have an upset.|`|cfhrzd2Taa	true because they do not use playoffs|`|vVVHygCqaa	True, because its not just about the Championship. Its shwoing the world that your teams the best and getting respect.|`|ABoo1doVaa	They do matter, but you can get away with a loss some seasons. In 2004 an undefeated Auburn didn't get in because of a game they lost in 2003. Think of it more like a double or even triple elimination playoff.
4UilmYwKaa	pick up brad lidge if u can. hes about to come back!!!!!!!!!!!!|`|AA10034577	Torres still has the Pit Job.  SD and LA both have aging closers.  Wtih Gagne being Gagne, Otsuka might not be a bad pick up.|`|3a757eae7e9a6739cd6bb2bc0fb0c85caa	I just heard that the Phillies are going to put there opening day starter Myers in the closers role because of Gordon going on the DL.  He's been in the bullpen for a while so now he's going to be the closer.|`|9f7c3a6b1c85a2b25fdaadcc6f4cc32aaa	Wickman is out so picking up either Soriano or Gonzalez might be a good idea. Maybe see if Henry Owens is available, he is getting it done at the moment (4 saves). Have to agree with an earlier answer, Otsuka if he is available...cant envision Gagne staying healthy for any stretch of time. Some leagues actually have Myers available, a great pick up if he is available in your league. Capps might be among the better options, the Pirates will do better than the Royals (a couple of the guys you mention). Also keep an eye on the Toronto situation, Frasor may lose the job to Accardo very soon (maybe today).|`|eVJdTlIIaa	i have capps and he will get saves because torre's job  is in question..also try and get rafael soriano hes the new closer for the braves
83657de676e1f6d8d606554bef6db0e9aa	1. McGahee - Has the most potential for a big game, especially after last weeks performance<br>  2. De Williams - With Foster's injury, he will play big as well following up on a solid game last week<br>  3. Cadillac - Really not a lot of production these past couple weeks, with the Bucs struggling, probably not a good start<br>  4. Thomas Jones - You gotta admit, the Bears running game really has not accomplished a whole lot this year. Its been either the passing or defense that has scored the points|`|36fd55751e2f21d04d543a8319629926aa	just as u listed then from first to worst|`|4a115160e2b8720d8909be9425ecdf88aa	mcgahee vs mia- played strong last week, and as he gets healthier should post better numbers against a decent miami rushing defense<br>  d williams vs phi- averaged a great ypc ratio last week, and phi has been playing terribly against the run, (addai 179 4 td's  rhodes 6ypc)<br>  tj vs min- min has strong rush defense and it should be a class nfc north low scoring battle <br>  cadillac vs pit- hes been shaky all year but has played better of late, but pitt has a good defense so hes not a good start.|`|9becc505b49fd9ac4f97f5a314ff2f2aaa	McGahee. (if he isnt starting, then do Jones.)|`|2bf7f125d731a10ee2971fa95c9e26e7aa	go McGahee dude. its the best choice|`|9f7c3a6b1c85a2b25fdaadcc6f4cc32aaa	Philly is in deep trouble and cant stop the run lately. Go with DeAngelo, Foster is hurt and carolina wants to get their running game going early. All the others have somewhat tough matchups, especially McGahee as Miami has been real tough to run on and benson got a lot of carries last sunday for the Bears...likely to see more of the same this week. Cadillac- forget about him...he has struggled all year and runs behind a weak O-line.|`|294e18a06fed2d27b96603245d1086cdaa	I would go with Williams, he will tear up Phili's D like Addia did.
9f7c3a6b1c85a2b25fdaadcc6f4cc32aaa	No....Bell gets an opportunity to show what he can do this year (and has eligibility at PG, SG and SF) and Watson continues to anger the coach and find himself in the doghouse. If Watson gets trade it may be worth revisiting but as of right now dont do it.|`|AA11307592	no.|`|AA10751929	Not yet.  See what Charlie Bell does for Mil in the next few weeks.  Watson seems to share time with Ridnour and when Lewis gets back Watson will be back to limited time.  Bell for now unless he sucks it up for a couple weeks.
AA11801495	i really don't think he will be doing much from a fantasy stand point in real life he will be a good bench player but fantasy wise he wont be doing to much he is currently the starter but he will lose the job to millage or Chavez very some plus he always gets injured now adays if i were you i would drop him or try to deal him away to someone that think better of him<br>  i would go with Barrett he has numbers that don't fluctuate he is a solid player Aj is a weird player in the beginning of his career he had little power and good average but now has a bad average and good power it is tricky but Barrett is the safe player to have/'/|`|9f7c3a6b1c85a2b25fdaadcc6f4cc32aaa	As a bench player he is okay but if you needed to rely on him for any stretch it wouldnt be good. He is still semi productive but the bat has slowed which usually means he wont last as a starter. Explore your options and see what else is available ,check on guys like Teahen...he is currently 3rd base eligible but will become outfield eligible shortly after the season starts and will be a productive fantasy player or Craig Monroe who is smack dab in the middle of a potent Tiger lineup and has 100 RBI potential to go with 25-30 HR. <br>   As for catcher....Barrett is clearly the better offensive player (the only thing that matters in fantasy). AJ really should only be considered if your starter gets injured, then maybe pick him up as a free agent.

E4S6IpRKaa	It's hard to say, but as a charger fan I would like him to stay because he ran for 1200 yards banged up behind a crappy line. He's got alot left in my opinion but idk. I do think if he stays it won't be for long so the chargers may draft a guy to back him up this year to learn to replace him when he leaves. What happens, happens but it will be hard to see him go if he does. He needs to retire a charger that's the only way I would accept him leaving the team he means alot<br>  To the San diego community|`|15wwA3jjaa	I really think LT's time in San Diego has come to an end, they obviously don't want him and don't feel they need him anymore.  As much as LT says he wants to finish his career in San Diego, just like anybody else in the NFL, he wants the most money he can get.|`|cdQryr7paa	If they wanted him they wouldn't be messing with him like this and he knows it.<br>  He once was the heartbeat of the team, but now he is expendable with the coming out of Sproles. <br>  They Chargers are willing to keep him for less money, but it is obvious they would just rather he decline their offer and move on somewhere else. <br>  Even if he concedes and stays in San Diego, he will have a reduced role as Sproles takes over more and more of the carries.<br>  He will want to go somewhere he will be THE starter.<br>  But, the last 2 years in a row, when the Chargers hit the playoffs, LT was sitting on the bench with injuries when his team needed him most.<br>  Although he did have 1,110 yards last season, he only had 2 games over 100 yards rushing. He had 11 touchdowns, but had 9 games out of 16 he did not score.<br>  8 out of 16 games he did not even get 20 carries.<br>  I would say the LT era in San Diego is over, but I don't necessarily think it is a bad thing. <br>  Sproles is an outstanding RB and will produce both in the regular season as well as the playoffs.|`|c03a1e29209b69a15065f8edab5c54daaa	I've got the feeling he'll be staying.  If the sticking point is him making less than Sproles, I don't see that as being a big problem because most likely Sproles will not be making that kind of money next year.  LT is a great RB, but there isn't a huge market for backs his age that command the type of money he does.  I think his best bet is to stay with the Chargers - especially if he wants a ring - because most teams that could afford him and have a place for him won't be contending for a couple years.|`|3a0c551af182343c97509a84971a0d28aa	OMG!!  The Chargers are really starting to work my nerves!  They seem to always do some stupid poop like this. They are send LT packing and then he'll come back and kick out butts and laugh all the way to the bank.  I say so be it.  If the Chargers organization are that stupid....I guess I have to accept that.  BUT it will be a sad day on the opening day of football season to see #21 in someone else's colors!!!  They're fools in that front office.  ARHHHHGGGGGGGGGG!!!!!!<br>  <br>  GO CHARGERS 2009??????????????????|`|AA11760438	How can the Chargers beat the Raiders now, without L.T. he was always the MVP in the rival games.. they never had an answer for L.T.<br>  <br>  This is bad. I see McFadden taking over the rest of the AFC West teams..|`|1tZtbozKaa	He will leave because I feel he is offended by the team. He put the Chargers back on the map and they really have disrespected him. Look for the Bolts to draft Beenie Wells and let him leave next year to go play for the Skins, Saints, Jags, 49ers, or the Bangles. I believe those to be the teams who will need help at RB in the 2010 off season the most.|`|qIFF3FtDaa	That report is scary, but thank you for the link. I REALLY hope LT stays. He does have a LOT left to play as an elite player. The Chargers would be making a HUGE mistake if they let him go. Not only would the team suffer, but also financially as I won't go to anymore games if he isn't on the team the next few years.<br>  <br>  He means a great deal to the community, and on top of that he can help our Chargers WIN THE SUPER BOWL!!!!! KEEP LT and DON'T UNDERCUT HIM!!! Don't offer him LESS than Sproles!!!! That's an insult!!!!! GO CHARGERS!!!
DKmN1JcZaa	I think skiing, because you have more control with poles and everything, but i don't know because a lot of people break there legs skiing because they are separated. I snowboard and I totally eat it sometimes, maybe snowboarding is more dangerous because you can totally hurt yourself.|`|5BGKQM7naa	Well, I've done both, and snowboarding is safer if you are a guy, no massive splits here! But sking is easier as if you dig into the ground you don't face plant etc.|`|rslrxUoWaa	Having done both, skiing is much safer. It's easier to brake and slow down with skies whereas it is much more difficult to control a snowboard in general. Just my opinion. :D|`|RblLjauMaa	That doesn't really matter it depends on how you ride. Both can be safe or dangerous.|`|GWoW1o5oaa	Skiing is safer.

EzHsh0TOaa	I think the gap in points between Barcelona and Real Madrid will be widened to 6 points. Real Madrid will have more difficulty because the opposite team is Atletico Madrid which need more point to join the UEFA Champion's League group. And Barcelona versus Athletic Bilbao the team will be almost lonally and joined the UEFA Cup 2009-10 (Due to Athletic Bilbao is the finalist of Copa del Rey). Thus Barcelona will win Athletic Bilbao easily and RM will be able to draw Atletico Madrid in the Madrid' s Derby match.|`|6F8cFMhwaa	A mining ship, investigating a suspected SOS, lands on a distant planet.

9f7c3a6b1c85a2b25fdaadcc6f4cc32aaa	Upton...you already know what the historical numbers of the other 2 are and both are in decline (dont be fooled by a 2 week hot stretch). Upton has a tremendous upside and is 2nd and 3rd base eligible (adds value over outfielders on your bench anyways).

Besides, .177 caliber pellets are less expensive, and you can hunt small game out to around 50 yards with this combination.<br>  <br>  The .177 gives you somewhere between 900fps & 925fps with pellets ranging from 7.9gr to 8.3gr<br>  Crosman Premier Domed Lights(7.9gr)<br>  RWS Superdome(8.3gr)<br>  Two very good pellets at a reasonable cost. <br>  <br>  **850fps - 950fps is a good range. >Too slow and trajectory suffers, too fast and pellets tend to become unstable and inaccurate. <br>  <br>  Example - trajectory<br>  RWS 34 using RWS Superdome(8.3gr) pellets - I'm using a VZR(Vital Zone Radius) of 1/2in<br>  If you sight-in at 42 yards, you will be 1/2in low at 8 yards, dead on at 14, 1/2in high at 28, then 1/2in low again at 48 yards....This means you would have very little hold over/under to worry about when hunting...<br>  <br>  Yes, the .22 caliber RWS 34 does extend your hunting range slightly, but since your MV will be between 675-700fps with 14.0 - 14.5gr pellets. You would have to do a lot of shooting to learn the hold over/under with this combination.<br>  <br>  Just to let you know, I prefer the post globe front sight over the fiber optic ones. >There are at least 10 different versions or combination packages for the 34<br>  <br>  If you can't find a better price<br>  <a href="http://www.mac1airgun.com" rel="nofollow">http://www.mac1airgun.com</a><br>  These guys had the 34 for $190 the last time I checked.

AA11442722	I think your going to throw your back out doing pushups with somebody sitting on you. You are young and think your back is invincible. I and most other dudes thought the same thing at your age. It hurts to breath when your back is out. Hurts to move, hurts to sit still, it just plain hurts. <br>  <br>  Best way to measure your strength is doing curls, bench press, things like that. Push ups w/o anybody or anything stressing your back is good exercise. Pull ups another good one that doesn't require weights. Your best bet is to invest in some weights and not only bulk up but also refine that bulk muscle. Especially if you plan to use it. Raw strength doesn't translate directly into ability. You have to alternate bulk workouts with agility exercises.

Katie looked her best before she met her brainwasher of a husband.|`|7d67c021e7c1ad8d0218c8ce76145c6caa	--i think jeff gordon should watch his back. i heard both marriages are crumbling faster than the martinsville track on a hot day. both <br>  couples are definitely mismatched--[both jg's wife and tom are very <br>  bossy @nd opinionated--but i'm sure jg's wife would cut tom's ego down to size]. on the other hand, jeff and katie would be a cute hook-up, <br>  and katie would have the sibling for suri--[sophie]--that katie <br>  refuses to give tom right now. i see flames on the horizon, and it's not <br>  just the paint on the 24 car. <br>  --stay tuned to this one. it ought to get interesting.|`|yN9gre9Xaa	Not really a fan of Tom, but still got to appreciate moments like this<br>  <br>  <a href="http://sports.yahoo6.akadns.net/nascar/gallery/im:urn:newsml:sports.yahoo,getty:20050301:nascar,photo,0b492bf09434e9729121569e1644e006-getty-84609196jb108_daytona_500:1" rel="nofollow">http://sports.yahoo6.akadns.net/nascar/g...</a><br>  <br>  and<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.daylife.com/photo/0b9j1ki12D07D" rel="nofollow">http://www.daylife.com/photo/0b9j1ki12D0...</a>|`|YN8Rbjogaa	maybe Burton can hit him, like those birds he blasted at the Brickyard last year.|`|7B3TwoaSaa	Because, Tom sold his sole to the devil, and now has to sit in Jeff's pit during the race. ITs part of the agreement he worked out with Rick Hendrick... lol (just sling some mud)<br>  TRUTH: When Tom Cruse was filming Days of Thunder, he worked with Hendrick to learn how to drive a race car. As a result, he started to learn the ins and outs of NASCAR. <br>  <br>  RUMOR: I heard a rumor, that Cruse was making another movie involving racing, not sure if that's true. But Cruse does do research on parts he is doing ion movies to make the character more real.|`|c16PCaCmaa	I'm sure he's just sharing stories from his driving career.  Like the time in the Daytona 500, when he lost his transmission, so he drove around the track in reverse, then his crew changed the transmission right in his pit stall, then he went back out, and won the race.  Man that was a classic.  Gordon only wishes he could drive like Cole Trickle.|`|toi5jz98aa	One word: Goldigger. Who has the most loot? Remember Jeff's been cleaned out before and hasn't won a race in a hundred years. Either <br>  way, Jeff's wife is SFL.|`|0MuRCU5paa	Maybe Cruise is trying to convert Gordon and his wife into Scientologists.|`|9vcZjFl6aa	no sure but both of them have pretty wives  mabe some swappin going on or he's teachin him how to jump on oprah's couch|`|9f0d54c35894f05249bcafb57c720e4baa	......have heard through the grape vine there could be another racing movie on the table.<br>   But hey there is no couches to jump on at a track.|`|XNdDrXAzaa	Jeff Gordon is one of the baddest race car drivers on this planet. He's for real, he aint acting. A real woman would wanna be with Jeff Gordon over Tom Cruise. Tom already burned through one marriage. The only way he could handle this one is getting a little girl. Jeff Gordon has a real ego, Tom Cruise is all about never knowing what the real deal is. All he can do is make a movie about it. Jeff Gordon lives it. <br>  Note: Sorry Tom. It is the NASCAR section.

9f7c3a6b1c85a2b25fdaadcc6f4cc32aaa	The FANS!  Without us fans filling stadiums and watching TV (or the internet) it wouldnt matter who did what in any sport. Proof of that is in all the failed "made for TV" sports that have come and gone. I think the single most important moment was when the first allowed forward pass became a rule in 1933. Before then it was illegal in both professional and college football although the first attempt was by U of North Carolina in 1895. Because the shape and weight of the ball it was thought that tossing a ball forward was too difficult. So the forward pass and the fans might be the biggest influence in the sport, much more so than any individual.|`|11e8350ec258efaccc286e4e5758b9bfaa	You left out Paul Brown, Al Davis, OJ Simpson, Howard Cossell and Jim Brown.<br>  <br>  However, I give my vote to Pete Rozelle, former commissioner of the NFL, who brought football to our homes.<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.time.com/time/time100/builder/profile/rozelle.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.time.com/time/time100/builder...</a>|`|9658d7060b703339bbfe4a795b46b04daa	Football was popular way before the Mannings, Brady, and Montana|`|PMSSoTqNaa	D|`|U7oDXHglaa	all of the above|`|AA10225723	I'd have to go with A.

MXDjKRPOaa	it depends but you should be able to drive the ball anything from 180-240 yds............i don't know what the average score is but i'm 13 years old and usuallly shoot about 5-7 over for 9 holes and 9-15 over for 18 holes.......i also drive the ball 200 yards.......hope that answers you question...... <br>  <br>  i have been playing twice a week for 2 years now........|`|tB2NTG0aaa	i just turned 14 and i shoot anywhere from even to 3 under on nine holes right now. i also hit the ball 300 yards but im pretty big for my age and i play a lot. i have really been playing (i guess people would call it seriously) for about 2- 2 1/2 years. and i also play from the championship tee's|`|ry3f5dxHaa	how far you drive it doesnt matter at all....at all. i dont hit it far (trust me) and i'm 17 and i can only drive it 240ish, what really counts is your short game. everyone who doesnt play golf only asks how far people can drive but that doesnt matter at all.|`|CBVlu3Gvaa	Your question asks for an average of data which has not been compiled.

9f7c3a6b1c85a2b25fdaadcc6f4cc32aaa	Colston was listed last year as a tight end because the saints drafted him as a tight end and gave no indication he would be used as a WR before Yahoo made their draft board. It is a matter of using team info...Matt Jones was a QB but the jags made it clear he was picked to be a WR and Yahoo used Jags info to qualify him as such. This happens every year...just so happened that Colston was a breakout player, all the other ones because of lack of production go unnoticed.|`|7qerLR1oaa	Actually you need to call out brandon funston because he takes care of position eligibilites. However I still feel yahoo is the best place to play ff colston was a 7th round tweener so he was given both position eligibility, the reason it wasnt changed is because those ppl who picked him up to be a TE would have been screwed over had he lost TE eligibility. So really they made a mistake on what position a 7th rounder was going to play give them some slack.
9f7c3a6b1c85a2b25fdaadcc6f4cc32aaa	Knuble is out for the year (confirmed by philly today) so cut ties with him now. Pick up Bill Guerin as he will soon be traded to a contender and will go straight to one of their first or second lines. He is a goal scorer and will likely be asked to pick up some penalty minutes (protecting smallish centers) and will improve his +/-. Better catch him quickly as soon as a trade is done someone in your league will jump on him.|`|4pQbrO1maa	people actually play fantasy hockey?? sweet! - todd shriber|`|359981bb6e435de61a31099381350ba7aa	Get rid of Knuble!

TXe7XqUlaa	Yes, statistically he is. I am sorry Bill P/Haneef, your answer's are a bit short sighted. Bill P you are inferring Sehwag does not win matches, well of course he does!! In terms of strike rates of the other players you and Haneef mention. Note Sehwag's ODI strike rate is 100.92.<br>  <br>  Viv Richards 90.2 (and also the opposition bowling was crappy in his era)<br>  Clive Lloyd 81.22 (slow city)<br>  Graeme Pollock (Played like 3 teams, and never played on ODI).<br>  Ian Botham 79.1 (no where near Sehwag)<br>  Symonds 92.78 <br>  Inzy 74.24 (that is a grandpa SR)<br>  Yuvy 88ish (at least he hit the 6x6)<br>  <br>  So in conclusion Xenon you are right. These counter-arguments from the posters above fail it (as you can see from the SRs above)|`|AA11088802	yes ! agree with u but jayasuriya isnt far behind|`|e7f9613d5b480e9758d037bfe66ac6b9aa	no|`|f9hiPMDxaa	No, far from it. Sehwag is good, definitely but others have been better in the modern era. Viv Richards, Clive Lloyd, Graeme Pollock (an unfortunately brief international career), Ian Botham. Sehwag could destroy an attack, these blokes could win games.|`|QD6BSJn1aa	what about Viv Richards , Andrew Symonds , Inzamam Ul Haq , Yuvraj Singh etc|`|RGxMkT0zaa	He is good. A player to reckon with.|`|qXkywBogaa	indeed swhwag is the best|`|3MmeOtPkaa	Yes he is a great player with no fear what so ever. Afridi was believed to destructive player, but he never performed consistently. All he did was slogging, but Shewag has played proper cricket shots thorough out his career and still manage to keep up his strike over 100. He is one player that every team wants as an opener.|`|bN6S0FJEaa	Like every cricketer, Sehwag has also gone through the bad patch.. he was left out of the team for a while for his poor form.<br>  <br>  Now its good to see him playing his natural game with consistent, which is good for Team India.|`|dVjUhE7Vaa	Yes he is a great player with no fear what so ever.

9f7c3a6b1c85a2b25fdaadcc6f4cc32aaa	If Stoneman were offered a deal like that he would have drove to NY himself to pick up A-Rod. The Yankees can get far more than that for him. Stoneman is trying to make a deal, so far they wont move any of the talented kids (Wood or Aybar) in the minors or maybe a deal would be done already. Some possibilities include getting Glaus ,Teixeira ,Sexson, Ensberg, Griffey,Chad Tracy, Crede, Atkins or Helton. These are the names that could be moved because of impending free agency or to dump salary. Stoneman needs to lose his reputation for not being willing to deal away talent or it will be another year of lots of talk and no deals. If they want to make a serious run at a World Series appearance they need to pay the price, so far they have failed to see it that way.|`|w3Y8Ecn0aa	That is a stupid trade for two reasons....<br>  <br>  1. A-Rod is worth more than that....<br>  2. Arte Moreno has already expressed his disinterest in the A-Rod sweepstakes, that leaves the Dodgers and both Chicago teams, being that Arod wants to go to a large market team...<br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  I hear the Angels are looking at Garret Atkins as their most likely option, however, Vlad the Impaler needs no protection.....|`|d0Z3jo1uaa	no<br>  the trade is stupid because it hurts the angels pitching, and gives away a good young pitcher for a super player, but figgins puts up good numbers anyway<br>  <br>  no way man
9f7c3a6b1c85a2b25fdaadcc6f4cc32aaa	I think Lovie spends too much time reading the hype about the defense. They are an exceptional group but seriously they need some help out there. Until he plays to win instead of playing not to lose they will continue to struggle with wins. Scoring a TD with 11 seconds left there is no good excuse for not locking up the W. Kich the ball into the endzone and force the guy to come back the full 100 yards or take the touchback and good luck getting into fieldgoal position from your own 20. Head coaches today (not just Lovie) dont put enough faith in the guys on the field, let them go out and make plays, if they do then they win....if not they lose. That is how I would want it if I were a player, not try to be cute and take your chances.|`|3dccf4de99914db7d849d65ad924d3b3aa	lovie smith, throughout his tenure in chicago, has repeadetly shown an inability to adjust or to learn from what happens. he will keep doing the same things, over and over again. i won't be surprised to see something like this happen again, because he is incredibly stubborn and will not make changes, because he seems completely sure that what he's doing it always right, all the time|`|49L76VMjaa	BIG GOOFY LACK OF DEEP BALL ARM STRENGTH AND MOBILITY ORTON(WHO MISSES MANY BIG PLAYS DOWN FIELD DUE TO HIS WEAK  ARM AND HIP AND LACK OF DEEP BALL CONFIDENCE) WILL GET HURT DUE TO THE FACT HE'S VERY SLOW WHEN ITS TIME TO MOVE AROUND THE POCKET AND ESCAPE PRESSURE,THEN REX WILL COME IN DO HE'S REGULAR CLOWN ACT THEN GET PULLED FOR THE EMERGENCE AND RISE OF CALEB HANIE WHO WILL LEAD THE BEARS TO A SUPER BOWL WIN!!!!!

9f7c3a6b1c85a2b25fdaadcc6f4cc32aaa	Goalies have to learn how each defenseman positions themselves and needs to learn the positional calls the team uses and it will require some time to get used to one another. Plus it is a preseason game and I am guessing the - players tonight are mostly the minor league guys and maybe a Junior player on the blueline (havent checked the box score but that seems to happen in blowout preseason games. He will be fine, the Hawks made some solid moves and have a couple young budding superstars so Huet has enough in front of him to get to the playoffs. Too early to predict, he might struggle at first with the expectation (lets face it, life is tougher for a goaler in Chicago than Wash., he struggled with expection with the Habs). Give him time and relax, I've seen better goalies than him get lit up just as bad (Roy against my Wings....ended his days in Montreal after being humiliated).|`|G33E41IBaa	I agree with you that it's pretty sad that he let in 7 goals in 22 shots against Columbus, but I think you gotta give him some time to get used to the rest of the team.  Give him a couple more preseason games till you judge him.|`|jbTNER3caa	He's very off and on.  If he's on though, he can be really helpful to any team he's on.  If he's off then you better have a good back up goalie.  Tends to play a bit based on emotions, gets down and doesn't get back up.  And he's starting to get a little older.<br>  <br>  Also, I would just like to point out, he got ousted from the Habs by a 21 year old.  AND a 23 year old!  I think the Canadiens definitely made the right move getting rid of him and keeping Carey Price and Jaroslav Halak.    Price is big and young.  Two things that Huet is not.|`|GPjsNqp9aa	First of all it is preseason, which means nothing<br>  Second of all it will take a Huet a while to get used to his new defense.<br>  Huet can help lead Chicago to the playoffs this year.

Shoot, he even played good in a Washington jersey. Caps are still holding their own without him. 4-0 but I agree preseason doesn't mean much, just a waste of energy.|`|2EfuZg3Taa	when goalies get traded to different teams some take a while to get used to a new defense...  so he might suck balls for the first few games|`|sbMd8V3Daa	they shouldve kept him in washington

It could be dangerous. Anything can happen and if you run down the street often, it can be bad since someone will know your route. Run with a friend which can be fun and you have some company so you can talk to them. Plus, if you get injured like a sprain ankle, you have someone to help you get back home and such. So definitely running with someone is a big plus.|`|uxUHF7Mjaa	If you really don't want to run down your street, you could run afterschool in your school.

The damage done can be irreversible... <br>  <br>  If you have a dog (preferably a larger one - no chihuahua's =P) try running with it.  The exercise would be good for you both and you'r dog will intimidate and protect you from potential attacks... or run with you'r dad, older brother, or someone such as that...

But this is not a decision to make as lightly as others may think. =) Hope I helped you over all!<br>  <br>  <br>  Read what everyone else said and had a point to add... <br>  <br>  Carrying pepper spray is a useful tool, but I have heard numerous stories on the news about some of the pepper spray spraying back residue into the user's eyes... and your attacker could take it from you and use it on you!  So don't be reliant on that...|`|pmXENVDGaa	i understand where your coming from but you cant always live life worrying about those things but your best bet is to run with a friend...but if no-ones available to run with you have your parents get you a membership to a local gym to run the treadmill...i no running the treadmill is not the same as outside but if you don't feel safe running by yourself then dont put yourself in that position ...dont let this stop you from something you love
zJC18FtAaa	Orvlosky wasn't traded he was signed as a free agent <br>  No even if they do get Stafford he's not going to make an impact like Matt Ryan or Joe Flacco did|`|TImzyFnYaa	put down the *eed and the bottle of jim bean!!! lol dud the only thing the lions are a threat to do is to go 0-16 twice ina  row. their organization is clueless, they dont have the right mix of players, and they keep on drafting wrs w/ the 1st pick in the draft every year. its pretty sad that actually in the 1990's the lions actually used to be alittle decent. remember herman moore, brett perriman, johnnie morton, and last but not least barry sanders. yea the good ol days.  sad that the lions have now turned into a punch line. jon kitna thinking he was a prophet, matt millen pretending to be a gm, and the owner out of touch w/ the fan base.  O HOW I LOVE BEING A NINERS FAN!!!!!!|`|jKdVtDx7aa	The only threat is the bad season they will give their fans.|`|gbuNvjyXaa	Draft an offensive line and they could be great for a long time|`|H7AcXAyaaa	They will bounce back like Miami Dolphins and make the playoffs.|`|DujXZCd9aa	I think they'll go something like 7-9 at least to 9-7 at most. I think they need to wait for Tim Tebow.
9f7c3a6b1c85a2b25fdaadcc6f4cc32aaa	Maybe the Gods dont appreciate the use of the word Saint (to imply they are above those whom they serve?). Seriously though, injuries are a part of football and all teams have their injuries, some have better depth and can overcome them easier. As for the suspensions...blame the suspended guys and not the Saints (although they likely know who they invest in and the possibilities that come with those choices). It could be worse....try being a Lions fan (although for me today was a very good day...bye, bye Millen, need help packing?, the only way it could possibly get better is if Ford announced he sold the team!).|`|4oMCPDwTaa	dont you remember Odysseus, from the old write Homer - well odysseus played around and taunted the gods and they were pissed<br>  <br>  well...

kHLWDgmIaa	i don't hate him he is my one of favorite superstars<br>  and why people hate him is because he is heel|`|2EB80Ez3aa	well, in the wwe he always cheats. he has vickie guerror get him most of the stuff he wants so its kinda like a free ride for him. even just recently he went into the raw elimination chamber when he was on smackdown and he beat up kofi kingston and won cena's title. everyone hates him because he always cheats and he then gets what he wants. and then him and vivkie guerror came to raw when everyone thought that cena was gonna be champ with the world title for a year like he was with the wwe belt.|`|oSA9Wsv1aa	Edge is the top heel now and the past few years minus his break. If you hate him then he is doing his job. But that's what makes this so great. I love to hate him.|`|JvSCCiKfaa	I dont hate Edge, Currently his bit with Vicki is very annoying.   <br>  <br>  Hes one that you love to hate.<br>  <br>  He just plays a very good heel, same as Jericho.|`|o4jIdbMFaa	evry one hates him because he is a bad guy <br>  <br>  but i don't care about bad or good people <br>  <br>  i love edge  because he is awesome and he is a goooood wrestler|`|hVqGuOOPaa	Everyone hates him because he looks like monkey and most of all he is married to the most hated general manager in the WWE: Vickie Guerrero!|`|5FypDafWaa	i don't hate him he is my favorite wrestler but he is a coward hiding behind his wife.|`|b4s0iroSaa	he's good but dependent on vickie|`|gXHxf2G9aa	I'm not sure if "hate" is the right term to use but i certainly don't like or respect him for that matter.  I know he's only working a storyline but his gimmick of the "ultimate opportunist" has been pushed to the point that some fans have begun to lose alot of respect for him.<br>  <br>  He's a fantastic superstar there's not doubt about that but his means of winning matches and titles are questionable.  He either cheats or his wife Vickie modifies the result so he gets a greater opportunity next time.<br>  <br>  It's just down to his gimmick being overused and now it's getting annoying and ruining his reputation as a superstar.|`|ZUTfMc8vaa	because he is a great big jerk and a big dumb dumb|`|cDJ9Ntskaa	Well I Dont Hate Edge He Is My Fav Superstar!!

JfGVUh9aaa	A Top Fuel Dragster is the quickest accelerating land vehicle on earth. <br>  The Bugatti is a passenger car by Dragster standards.<br>  <br>  A Top Fuel Dragster will beat a Jet Fighter to the end of an aircraft carrier. It accelerates quicker in a quarter mile than the Space Shuttle does the first quarter mile of take-off!<br>  <br>  So yes, the Dragster would win. It's faster than everything.|`|gvfFLFS0aa	Yes, the Veyron is a street-legal car that has characteristics other than straight-line speed.  Top fuel dragsters are made for one purpose.<br>  <br>  About the Top Gear thing, it's also 1700 lbs. heavier than any car that beat it.<br>  <br>  Veyron 1/4 mile: 10.2 s<br>  Top Fuel:             4.5 s<br>  <br>  Veyron Horsepower: roughly 1000<br>  Top Fuel Horsepower: 7000-8500<br>  <br>  By the way, if the race lasts longer than 10 seconds, the Bugatti would catch up, because the dragster's engine would overheat.  Then again, it could coast a while, seeing as it gets to over 325 miles per hour, so it might win over some longer distances, too.|`|QOqvZybJaa	The Veyron could be going 200mph past a stopped TF dragster and the dragster could start and pass the Veyron in 4 seconds and less than a 1/4 mile going over 300mph.   <br>  <br>  There is no comparison in acceleration, if they left the line at the same time the dragster would be finished while the veyron was still in second gear. I'm sure a Veyron would have a better sound system though.|`|xmEQAt4daa	A 12 grand Caterham can beat the Veyron so I imagine so.|`|YupMCYHlaa	Did you see the Veyron on Top Gear this week?  It wasn't even the fastest car they'd ever tested on their track.  A dragster would shoot way out in front of it in the quarter mile.  But a dragster is made to go only a  quarter mile, so in a little further than that, the dragster would either run out of gas or explode from the stress, and the Veyron would just be reaching its stride.|`|Z03zgM0maa	yes, the dragster is lighter and meant for short distance racing. over 1/2 mile the bugatti would win because it would catch up to it and the dragster will begin to slow down...just a guess. i'm not entirely sure. would be fun as heck to watch though
rnUr1JJ7aa	the bugei, a strong blade made to cut,that`s all i need to say. but the paper crane is a goooood center piece but also good to.<br>  <br>  bugei get it|`|3KQRw8sPaa	the paul chen paper crane katana!!! easy|`|r5AMG8g7aa	My experiences with Paul Chen katana are that tey are heavy. I prefer a lighter sword. I've not used a Bugei katana although I do know that they are very good katana. I have used katana by Cheness and found them to be well made. I have the  "Kaze" Ko-Katana. It is well made, with two pegs and a shorter blade that makes drawing easier for the style of Iaido I do.  If you are going to practice Iaido be sure that the blade is not to long. I find that many people have trouble properly drawing the average sword with blades of 28 -29 inches in length. I can do it but must do a body twist which is not proper for the style I do.<br>  <br>  Hope this helps!

OOeoFvB6aa	Not all instructors are PSIA certified.  It's not required, at least not in NY.  Finding certified instructors would be good, though, because it means they have passed certain on-snow tests and teaching tests.<br>  <br>  Most ski areas have a general ski school and a separate children's learning center.  Ski Zoo, Ski Wee, are both children's programs.  Many ski areas have their own unaffiliated children's program.  Look for one of these because it means, 1) they have instructors who are used to talking to, teaching and being with younger children, and 2) they have real beginner terrain.<br>  <br>  You'll want to make sure that their rental shop has equipment small enough for your kids, you can call and ask.  <br>  <br>  You'll want to know if they have a day-care nearby or attached to the children's learning center so that if your children get tired they have a safe place to go.  This would also allow them to take a lesson for an hour and then go to the day-care for another hour or two which gives YOU a real afternoon of free skiing.<br>  <br>  You'll also want to make sure that they have real beginner terrain.  That means asking if they have a surface lift, magic carpet or rope tow (easier for kids than the big ski lift), and actually eyeballing the "hill" that your children will be skiing on.   You're looking to make sure that it is short and not at all steep, and there are no other trails that merge with the children's area where an out-of-control skier/snowboarder can come crashing through your children's class.<br>  <br>  Lastly, are they helpful and friendly with you?  If they're not nice to you, they may not be nice to your children. Your ultimate goal is for your children to LOVE being on skis and on the snow and at the ski area.  Good luck!|`|Ir7JA6IUaa	All ski instructors have to be certified, and they all follow the same teaching methodology as outlined by the PSIA (at least in the US).  So, what you really need to check out is the instructor(s). If possible, meet them ahead of time, talk with them about the program, etc., and find an instructor you really like.  It's also worth seeing if they have a dedicated area for kids to learn separate from the adults, and to make sure they will allow the parents to at least watch, as you are supposed to leave the kids at the school so they can concentrate on learning and not be distracted by their parents.
gMjHph9Eaa	Clearly from the ALL CAPS and illiterate speech, we can already tell you aren't that smart. Kimbo is a guy who's proved that any guy on the street cannot touch him. He beat a former Heavyweight boxing champion in MMA, as well as 3 other LIFE PRACTICIONERS of MMA. He had a fluke loss from an illegal blow to the back of the head, big deal. He would never fight Forrest, GENIUS, he's a heavyweight, and forrest is light heavyweight. Kimbo would knock out Griffin in 30 seconds.|`|QMveJrziaa	oh yeah.......?|`|QbY18bjkaa	Forrest <br>  <br>  Kimbo need help
cdQryr7paa	He sucks in the locker room where he causes all the problems and destroys teams.<br>  He is a talented player on the field and in superior physical condition, but his attitude is that HE is the team, and whether they win or lose depends on how many times he gets the ball.<br>  As far as never playing football again, I would agree with you, but unfortunately, there is going to be at least one NFL team out there that will decide to give him a chance.<br>  He will destroy their team just like he took down the Eagles and Cowboys.|`|c03a1e29209b69a15065f8edab5c54daaa	He doesn't suck, he's certainly a locker room cancer and whichever team signs him - and there will be a team that will sign him - will disintegrate form the inside out, but he doesn't suck.|`|fzzkDo3saa	I don't think he sucks, but he is definitely past his prime..I definitely wish that his mouth had an on/off switch.<br>  <br>  Not a team oriented player, but when he plays you can't say that he does not give 100%.|`|JTSNljLhaa	you just hate him,he doesnt suck without him the eagles wouldnt have made it to the superbowl a few years back....he even made McNabb numbers look so"UnMcNabb Like" (turned to great numbers)|`|JMVkZJzUaa	T.O. is an incredible talent, but he is very disruptive to team unity.  I would't sign him for $10.00|`|8LzF0ye8aa	I've heard that Oakland might be interested.  Sounds like a perfect fit because they can't get much worse anyway.|`|u4iqLZZBaa	As much as I understand why people don't like T.O. because he can be heavy duty locker room poison, the fact remains that he has caught more TD passes than any other WR in the NFL in the last three seasons. He must be doing something right.|`|Bh0UjCBMaa	I hate him and can't wait for him to retire.....the worst part is kids at home see that jackass on tv and say "Yeah I wanna be just like him"|`|yzKrwvxSaa	he doesnt suck<br>  he just needs to figure out he isnt the only wide reciever on the team|`|LLXfaOK9aa	I think he should go play for the Eagles. lol How pissed would McNabb be?|`|YM6KMpusaa	i disagree|`|gRXy66dOaa	I disagree with you
dpSr0icwaa	It won't fit.<br>  <br>  you need to modify the cylinder chamber itself.  Once you do that, the cylinder chamber will not be safe to use wiht 38 special/357 magnum<br>  <br>  There is one exception to this<br>  <br>  The medusa<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.kitsune.addr.com/Firearms/Revolvers/Medusa_Model_47.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.kitsune.addr.com/Firearms/Rev...</a><br>  <br>  The gun has a specially hardened cylinder to handle high pressures, and each cylinder chamber is acually multip-part backed up with high tension springs.  This allows it to handle pretty much any straight-walled 38/9mm handgun cartridge.|`|ca6144d7933bfd99d11441a498f7e603aa	The newer Smith and Wesson cylinders that do not enclose the case head may have room for for the clip. However, I would not recommend it. There is enough difference in pressure and case size to split all the cases. Also, the .002-.003 difference in bullet size would not make an accurate round. If, however, you would like to become a firearms tester, go for it.<br>  As an alternative, go with the convertible, or other revolver like the Ruger. The Smith and Wesson Model 547, if you could find one, was a 9mm that had a unique extractor system that used no clips. They were made back in the '80s for about 4 years.|`|a268bbf5f7d7d4bbb6f43d11ccd29916aa	.38 special---17,000 psi<br>  9mm luger---34,084 psi<br>  <br>  So, no, you can't use a .38 special to fire a 9mm luger.  Kaboom.<br>  <br>  9 mm base diameter---.391"<br>  .357 base diameter---.379"<br>  <br>  Looks a little tight in that cylinder, amigo.<br>    (ie:  no)<br>  <br>  Edit:  I will warrant that if I fired a 9mm luger from my S&W Airweight Chief's Special it would not survive.  The frame is not made to handle that kind of pressure.  Period.<br>  <br>  The difference in OAL between .38 Special and .357 mag is 1mm, ya?  That may not seem like much, but it was done with the specific goal of preventing the .357 cartridge from being chambered in the .38 revolvers because of the high pressure generated by the .357--which just happens to be very very close to that generated by the 9mm luger.  So it may not be much, but it's enough within the context of the question.|`|Y4RS35M7aa	You won't be able to close the cylinder.<br>  <br>  That being said, there are revolvers like the Ruger SP-101 that do fire 9mm with mon clips, but .38s and .357s are not able to do so.  Why would you want to?|`|Ucbnl7VJaa	No.|`|AA11270626	Only if you want to be hurt REALLY bad!|`|ZsujbEjJaa	nope.|`|XNpnK4vpaa	A normal revolver cylinder is meant to use rimmed cartridges (like the .38 Special and .357 Magnum).<br>  <br>  A revolver cylinder must be made differently to accomodate moon clips and non-rimmed cartridges.<br>  <br>  So, the answer is "No!" for two reasons:<br>    1) the 9mm cartridges & moon clips won't fit into a normal ..357 Magnum cylinder<br>    2) a revolver cylinder made to handle .38 Special pressures may not handle the higher pressures of the 9mmLuger cartridge.|`|oYf3jSq6aa	The answer is no as Chris said<br>  But not for the reasons other's state<br>  <br>  There is no "kaboom" risk<br>  If there were they would not make revolvers capable of shooting all three rounds with a simple cylinder change<br>  <br>  The problem is dimensions<br>  <br>  38 and 357 are essentially the same size round in every way except a very very small difference in overall length<br>  The 9mm is different enough to need it's own cylinder<br>  <br>  Check here for dimension differences<br>  <a href="http://members.shaw.ca/cstein0/revolver.htm" rel="nofollow">http://members.shaw.ca/cstein0/revolver....</a>

XZTwrn2Qaa	they were on crystal meth|`|iPWKzzQtaa	They couldn't even hold onto the boat...what are you talking about?|`|98bupiDFaa	It was a 21' boat...it's not like flipping a rowboat back over...and it would be especially hard in stormy seas.  They were probably busy just trying to keep their heads above water.|`|cdQryr7paa	They could have done that if they were in shallow enough water their feet would touch the bottom, but in deep water where you don't have anywhere to plant your feet if you try to lift the boat it will just push you down under the water.<br>  Besides that, it was anchored. <br>  I suppose you would wonder why they didn't all grab ahold of the anchor rope and pull the anchor up as well, huh?<br>  If you spend a few hours in deep 65 degree water you will understand why they couldn't even hold on to the boat anymore.<br>  Hypothermia is a situation where all your blood retracts from your extremities and moves into the core of your body as a natural result of your body trying to keep its self warm. <br>  If you wake up at night and your hand is asleep, it takes a few minutes to get the blood to flow to it again.<br>  Imagine your hands asleep for hours in cold water and trying to hold on to a rocking boat.|`|c4b596d15eac948f611f72b6a99f85a0aa	4 guys, in frigid waters, with 8-10 foot waves flipping a boat right side up, while it was at anchor?<br>  <br>  LOL. That's a good one.<br>  <br>  Even if it was possible, which it wouldn't be, I don't think it would be possible for four people to work together effectively in that situation without training.|`|c03a1e29209b69a15065f8edab5c54daaa	Flipping a 21 foot boat over in rough seas like that would be near impossible.  I don't think the four of them could do it in perfectly calm water, let alone in the situation they were in.|`|AA11674745	Did you see the size of that boat?!<br>  <br>  You try flipping a canoe by yourself and you'll see why that didn't happen.|`|1lmn5Mk5aa	I flipped my kayak once in 68 degree waters and I could barley get it back over and my kayak is only 8 feet and about 40 lbs. Now granted I am not a NFL football player but you have no idea what you body goes through in waters so cold. I am lucky I didn't die when that happened considering I was by myself.<br>  <br>  Flipping the boat over isn't as easy as it sounds, especially considering the waves were 15 feet at one point. The 63 degree water would have drained their energy fast, as you body tries to keep you warm. It probably only took a few hours for their body temp to drop below 95, at this point confusion sets in, and you loose ability to control muscles. I doubt the four men could have flipped the boat in warm calm waters.|`|0P71zlECaa	Flipping the boat would have been difficult as others have said. <br>  <br>  My guess is they panicked and no one took charge of the situation. The survivor did say they all managed to put on life jackets. So, even if they couldn't right the boat, they should have found a way to tie their jackets together and stay in contact with the boat. <br>  <br>  Maybe they tried and failed. Maybe they were injured and couldn't physically stay together. Making good decisions in that circumstance would be extremely difficult.<br>  <br>  We will probably never know all the details about what happened even if the lone survivor remembers more.|`|LvLtAOBFaa	you try to flip a 21 foot anchored boat with out being able to use your legs and to top it off in a storm with waves slamming it into you repeatedly|`|90baecbe3029033e6f4b3cb1f967a617aa	i was thinking the same damn thing. and even when it flipped over why didnt they try to get on top of the boat like that other one did. its such an unfortunate situation|`|E4S6IpRKaa	Hmm yea your right why didn't the four men wading in freezing water flip over the anchored boat. Dumbass|`|AA10225723	I highly believe they would've if they could. My question is why they took off their vests. Tragic story that's for sure.|`|WfEol5xkaa	You would think.
r5AMG8g7aa	It does not matter. At that point you have only learned the basic techniques and are only a beginner with no real understanding of the art or how to use it. The real training/learning begins there. In the orient, they begin to notice you at that point. Skills not belts are where your goals should be. When you have sufficient skills belts will follow. Any place that talks about becoming a black belt or sells black belt contracts is only interested in making money not teaching the real art. No reputable instructor will never say how long it takes to reach a belt. In fact it should never even be discussed.|`|BovpXrk1aa	10 years for ave|`|51e7baee76cfe5758f817c35c038f4c7aa	About two weeks, shorter if you get overnight shipping.<br>  <br>  Now, to earn a black belt takes as long as it takes.  Some people go fast, some go slow.  Some schools are more lax than others.  I've heard anywhere from 2 to 10 years as a minimum, depending on the school and style.<br>  <br>  The black belt is just the beginning of martial arts.  It signifies that you have mastered the basics of your art.  Then you start to learn a lot of other great stuff that takes years just to begin to understand.  That takes a lifetime.  So don't look at it as a destination, just look at it like getting on the on-ramp of a highway going on a long journey.|`|dmX3zwbHaa	1 year = orange<br>  2 year = bleu<br>  3 year = yellow<br>  4 year = green<br>  5 year = brown<br>  6 year = black<br>  <br>  <br>  This is how it is done in my karate (kyokushin)<br>  schools that give it in 3 years is for the money.|`|4d13f34c6f100ed6121b3208fd700099aa	how long is a ball of string?<br>  <br>  20 minutes in the shop.<br>  <br>  as long as it takes for a sensei to grade you in a dojo.|`|e86f624ac7abafd2725c361b122b48f9aa	Real karate- 6-8 years.<br>  <br>  Mcdojo karate 3 years or shorter|`|fh2taCkvaa	yes 1st degree black belt 2-5 years and second degree an Additional 4 years !|`|XtsKvvFQaa	i take brazilian jiujitsu and muay thai kickboxing. i got my blackbelt in 3 years and 6 months

Development efforts are focused on African and Asian nations; and on the United States. In 2004, the ICC Intercontinental Cup brought first-class cricket to 12 nations, mostly for the first time.|`|XVYRUzkEaa	If you are talking about "International Teams" then there are 12.<br>  <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ICC_ODI_Championship" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ICC_ODI_Cha...</a><br>  They are:<br>  South Africa<br>  Australia<br>  India<br>  New Zealand<br>  Pakistan<br>  England<br>  Sri Lanka<br>  West Indies<br>  Bangladesh<br>  Zimbabwe<br>  Ireland<br>  Kenya|`|VbWhiBAHaa	20 teams nearly.|`|KIjnl6X8aa	check out cricinfo you will get ur answer i n detail

NZ can win the match. <br>  <br>  People are underestimating NZ again. They are a good team. What happened with the two T20 games. What happened to we will win every game.

tW8fh4IGaa	To each, his own.<br>  <br>  It really is up to whats more comfortable for each player. But the greater the curve will result in the more "wicked" of a wrist shot.|`|qTQ0l1vBaa	tps response|`|t15smGMjaa	depends on where your curve is, and yes how wicked it is...a very flat blade will give you a more accurate slapshot and an excellent backhand, but no wrist shot...a deep toe curve or heel curve will give you a more accurate wrist shot, high or low depending on toe or heel, but will take away from your slapshot and give you almost no backhand...if you're looking for just a good all around blade go with a sakic from easton, it's a mid curve, so you get some of the benefits of both, but it's not specialized either way
37ca795533a30bf45438c32816894276aa	Si, es cierto.<br>  La carnitina es una sustancia que tenemos en el cuerpo, pero podemos adicionar en forma oral (Pastillas x boca) y no requiere receta, pertenece al grupo de los "Lipotropicos" es decir "Disuelve-Grasas".<br>  <br>  Sin embargo, no hay "Drogas Magicas", por cada cosa que uno "Mete" en el cuerpo enciende una cadena de sucesos que hay que tener bien en claro, en este caso la ingestion de carnitina beneficia la disolucion de grasas excedentes en el cuerpo, Sin embargo - Aunque es de venta libre - te conviene consultar a tu medico antes de empezar a usarlas, probablemente te mande - Como a mi - a hacerte un analisis de sangre para ver si tu organismo esta listo para utilizarlo y tambien hablar con tu entrenador para calcular cuanta Carnitina<br>  tenes que tomar en forma diaria, en funcion de tu peso corporal, tu exceso de peso -Si lo hay - tu consumo total de calorias y algunas otras variables.<br>  Conmigo funciono perfectamente, pero tambien me obligo a modificar un poco mis habitos alimenticios ya que  - Si bien es bueno quemar grasas - Hay que recordar que las grasas tienen una funcion en el cuerpo (Por algo Dios las habra puesto ahi, no?)<br>  <br>  Entrena, cuidate y habla con tu entrenador y tu medico, ellos te van a decir cuanto, cuando y como debes tomar las pastillas, y que alimentacion debes balancear para obtener un rendimiento optimo.<br>  <br>  IMPORTANTE: La carnitina trabaja especialmente con el trabajo aerobico, mas que anaerobico y despues de superada las barrera de las calorias, tu medico y tu trainner te van a explicar, de todos modos, cualquier duda:<br>  <br>  bolk294@gmail.com<br>  <br>                                    A tu disposicion, Sergio.|`|9928b3f7cd43d57838263e6ae5d6670eaa	Si es cierto. Yo estaba bien gorda y llegué un punto en mi dieta en que estaba estancada y con eso  vaya que me desestanqué.<br>  También tienes más energía al entrenar.<br>  Muy recomendable.<br>  No le he visto ningún contra y eso que mi cuerpo es muy sensible. No te alocas ni nada. Lo único malo es que a veces hay unas que están caras pero aún así vale la pena. No trates la versión en cápsulas, es mejor en jarabe estás mas concentrado|`|5617233ff5b4dd029cf5436084c02ce8aa	Eso que es?|`|44032df4712a6c0ff949251c2585969baa	Hola querido amigo, yo he leído un montón sobre esto y he hablado con dietistas... la l-carnitina, tiene más marketing que nada, porque no existen pruebas serias que lo corroboren, vale que ayuda a quemar más rápido las grasas, está muy extendido, pero en realidad no hay tal garantia.<br>   Yo te aconsejo algo natural, que te va ayudar, si es que lo que deseas es bajar de peso o ser mejor deportista. Tengo unos conocidos que son deportistas de elite y lo único que pueden tomar para ser mejores, es SPIRULINA, un alga azul que crece en el fondo marino, sin luz, por ende, si has de comprarla, procura que venga en su frasco de vidrio obscuro antirayos solares, porque es la única forma de que no pierda sus propiedades, que son la de dar energia... o sea que comes menos, si quieres adelgazar, pero no te cansas porque tienes energia, que no se acumula como grasa... y si quieres mejorar en el deporte, tus musculos la asimilan de mejor manera... y es natural, nada de farmacos. <br>  Un consejo no te automediques, que al final siempre trae consecuencias... mejor lo natural.|`|62ce738cc7a04d07204a2c77cec063b4aa	es cierto pero tienes que tomarla con control. La L-carnitina es una sustancia quema-grasas que tiene nuestro cuerpo, si tomas pastillas de l-carnitina estas aumentando esta sustancia en el cuerpo artificialmente, por eso no hay que tomarla por temporadas largas, se toma unos meses y luego se descansa, y siempre que la tomes debes hacer ejercicio a diario, ademas de beber mas agua de lo habitual.|`|993e8f2be42c6c14df03c3ee196e8f5baa	Es un suplemento para quemar grasas, pero actua de forma correcta si haces mucho deporte, por ejemplo una hora de cualquier actividad como bicicleta, correr, nadar, etc y normalmente lo que hace la carnitina es transportar las grasas hasta las mitocondrias donde son quemadas como energia.|`|93bff34f54fcb4206dc1b19c239a03f4aa	la L-Carnitina la utiliza el cuerpo para quemar grasas, Tomarla produce que aceleremos el proceso y quememos mas grasas, pero es necesario hacer algún ejercicio aeróbico después de tomarla. Normalmente el cuerpo empieza a quemar grasa unos 45 minutos después de iniciar cualquier esfuerzo aeróbico.<br>  Para menos tiempo no tiene ninguna utilidad.<br>  Atención, la sobre dosis no es nada buena.|`|e6f9b0dd1a4e1941bcba8494db583242aa	hola,es un buen quemador de grasas,convirtiendolas en energia si es bebible la tomas media hora antes de tu ejercicio fisico a ser posible aerobico,lo notaras pk sudaras mucho y con una buena dieta bajarias de grasa...|`|f3b48a399ddde808e6331175eb705c1baa	La carnitina se sintetiza en tu propio organismo si tienes una dieta equilibrada, por tanto todos esos suplementos comerciales no son necesarios. Si no existe déficit de lisina, metionina, hierro y vitaminas C, B3 y B6, no tiene por qué ser necesario tomar ningún suplemento. De hecho el déficit de carnitina es muy raro. La carne roja es la mejor fuente de carnitina. Se ha demostrado que fuentes adicionales a la de la alimentación (salvo que haya déficit), no producen beneficio alguno. La expresión "quema grasas" es puramente comercial porque la carnitina por sí misma no quema grasas sino simplemente las transporta. Por hacer un símil, la carnitina ayuda a pasar el combustible (grasa) al motor, pero si tú no haces trabajar ese motor de forma adecuada la grasa no se quema.

CZvrFqZ1aa	Innocent untill proven guilty is the old cliche.<br>  I believe he is innocent anyway. Some chick realising, ''oh, that's Brett Stewart" and then when he says no, go to the cops.<br>  How many League Players have been "accused" of this before? Tons, and they are never guilty.<br>  Just some desperate chick looking for attention.<br>  Jay S, you're an idiot. Why are there so many idiots like you on the Internet?<br>  Simon T, no I don't have to have rights for her. It's my opinion, not yours and I honestly believe it's another girl crying foul... to be proven false once again.|`|Uyz6iZwKaa	I don't like manly at all.<br>  <br>  However, in the past the media have done the same story on other clubs blah blah blah and never has anyone been charged...not because they are nrl players but because nothing happened and it was a load of crap to get attention and money. <br>  <br>  I think it is the same case here.<br>  <br>  If the media are wrong (and they are) - dont hold your breath for an apology!|`|28667a2fab4e406f52bfe94a34c859cbaa	Probably not|`|mBlcD6sRaa	yes<br>  <br>  he is going to Guantanamo Bay|`|250f92c71f87d8b92c484cedce92e86eaa	Manly for life.<br>  <br>  It's a bit of double standard from you saying he is Innocent until proven guilty but then condemning her and saying she is the guilty one who is lying.<br>  <br>  I am not saying i think he did it but you have to give her as much rights as you do him.<br>  <br>  We will just have to wait and see the outcome to find out who is lying.|`|JAg8cIOsaa	It doesn't really matter what anyone thinks.  Only 2 people really know what happened.  The NRL (make that Manly) is a law unto itself. We all know what will or more to the point, wont happen if Stewart is found to have committed the assault. It is just another season of NRL.|`|4NBAfnqbaa	i agree with manly 4 lyf<br>  so many footy players have been accussed of this before<br>  its just another girl who has recognised him and wants attention<br>  brett stewart really doesnt seem like the type of person who would do something like this.<br>  his smart enough to know this would ruin his career|`|C8XEeBSDaa	Dave at least spell his name right its Stewart and isn't innocent until proven guilty the way the law works these days.I sure hope he is innocent.Its not a good way to start the season.|`|uKoAMJQvaa	has to be innocent till proven otherwise.Shame because of a player's position it gets plastered all over the place.

And what is this attitude of refusing to speak with the police????  Surely if you were innocent you would be honest and upfront.   Oh well, probably will be swept under the carpet along with all the others before him.|`|qhanS0bwaa	Listen to you all she is seventeen. I am a Manly supporter which makes this even more disappointing. Innocent till proven guilty, YES! However when are these boys going to learn the consequences of drinking to excess. Why put yourself in a situation where you could be taken advantage of by these girls (if this is what happened). Then there are those of you saying he doesn't seem the "type" what is the "type" I wonder??? I'm sure there are plenty of women out there that now say he just didn't seem the type!!! I am just so sick of the NRL don't kid yourselves people, ego's, booze and 17 year old girls. Girls stop being so stupid if they are drunk stay away from them they just play football and boys grow up have some pride in what you do you have the world at your feet do you really need to get that messed up you open yourself up to all sorts avenues of attack by outsiders or yourself. Then there is the NRL clubs when are you going to get real and realise it is time to say no to drinking when the season begins or perhaps get them minders to make sure they don't misbehave surely this can be factored into there ridiculous salaries|`|il1CjqWNaa	not sure.. but when readers defend players with, the girl was thinking..."oh brett stewart, here's an easy target. if he rejects me, i'll just cry rape etc" or we have sex but now its rape, or the girl is telling stories, then i think its pretty unfair. I think alot of these players play that card to the police and the public.. "oh we had sex but now she's crying rape!!" we just need to let the police do their thing... the girl may be telling the truth this time!!|`|fc0IloYYaa	Apes raised by apes.<br>  <br>  I played league for 13 years, some of which at representative level, and the s*it that goes on in the team environment is disgusting. Its only now that I look back on it and I think about the stuff we used to get up to and I'm suprised some of us weren't arrested. Most of it was either encouraged or laughed off by the coaching staff.<br>  <br>  I often wish I wasn't so passionate about the game and I could turn my back on it, as the d*ckhead gorillas keep f**king it up for everyone. I don't blame fans from AFL and ARU bagging us supporters. We pay money out of our hard earned salaries each week to go watch these boofheads run around a park.<br>  <br>  I'll stop b*tching. Now, do I think Stewart did it. She was a 17 year old girl who just moved into the area. When I was 17, the girls I hung around with wouldn't be able to name a Leaue player if you paid them. I think something must've happened and I think it is wrong for Manly to play him while the matter is unresolved.

The Rim is 10 feet tall. 1 feet = 12 inches. <br>  10 feet = 120 inches  <br>  <br>  Now, raise your hand, and measure it from bottom to top of your hand. Lets say you're 6 feet tall and the measurement from bottom to top of your (raised) hand (finger tip)  is  89 inches, which is = 7'5. <br>  <br>  If you're measurement is 89 inches from bottom to top, you will need 31 inches vertical jump to touch the rim at 120 inches.|`|83f801efe05013446fe672c6f7223508aa	Go to a large wall and with pen in hand make a mark on the wall as far up the wall as you can reach.

9f7c3a6b1c85a2b25fdaadcc6f4cc32aaa	Okay, I'm not a Bronco fan but I'll offer my two cents worth anyways. They NEED to make the switch, the team doesnt believe in Jake and he has been a miserable failure in the playoffs. To all those who say it is throwing away the season...is it? Havent you seen how poorly Jake performs on the big stage (i.e. the playoffs)? And dont worry about the old crap that they cant win with a rookie. Does the name Big Ben ring a bell? They dont need a QB to win the games they need one who wont LOSE it for them, kinda like Ben did with the Steelers. Remember all the naysayers when the Patriots went to Brady, I guess that worked out okay! Bring on Cutler!|`|2c3c751dbb655f1000ed1481b8ea38e4aa	NO, They still have a chance to make the playoffs and it would be a bad move. If you look at plummers record at with Denver it's pretty good. They need to stick with one starting RB and let him get a rhythm. They have gone away from that.|`|6672458c2b599d095cd9356a86dd8521aa	YES DEFINITLY. Plummer is all washed up. Cutler has a better arm.Cutler is ready for action in the NFL.|`|ab0d1f28ca48b41b5d569ca18e064876aa	Just read on ESPN the Shanahan has done just that.

He is without a doubt an incredible talent (when he wants to be) but he does more damage to every team he plays for than what justifies having him. Perfect example: Does anyone think the Saints are that much better than the 'Boys? Dont get me wrong, the Saints have played extremely well and earned their victory but how distracted do you think the Cowboys as a team were when the T.O. circus became the focal point of the team this week. I have been a long suffering Lions fan and Matt Millen is the most pathetic excuse for a GM in the history of football but even he probably knows better than to sign T.O.. Hard to imagine the Lions being any worse as a team but somehow this clown would find a way to make the team worse. The Cowboys (who should be in the Super Bowl) will lose in the 1st or 2nd round after yet another T.O. moment, maybe then every team will see the cancer he is and nobody will sign him.|`|4e480b74ca0fc042cdbe321c54b8f41baa	we need T.O. until we get better recievers
9f7c3a6b1c85a2b25fdaadcc6f4cc32aaa	In no particular order they likely will be:<br>  <br>   Brady Quinn (the one sure pick, he will go first)<br>  <br>  JaMarcus Russell (provided he declares for the draft...seems likely)<br>  <br>  Adrian Peterson  (powerful and good size back...complete package)<br>  <br>  Joe Thomas (agree with the previous...he is a beast)<br>  <br>  Calvin Johnson  (4.4 forty..48 vertical..6'6" and tough)<br>  <br>  Troy Smith is not a top 5 pick. No NFL team has him on their board as a top 10 let alone a top 5, he is regarded as the 3rd best behind Quinn and Brohm and if Russell declares he slides to 4th on most boards and there are some teams that dont have his slotted that high. Look for him to go at the top of the 2nd round.|`|13b0de74433c83d4cf642bc0dd6882e1aa	Troy Smith (Another Michael Vick, talented, but a coach killer)<br>  <br>  Brady Quinn (Though i think he's overrated)<br>  <br>  Adrian Paterson (Underrated)<br>  <br>  JaMarcus Russell (Best Overral Draft pick i think)<br>  <br>  Joe Thomas (This guy will be a star someday)<br>  <br>  These are my guess, not in any particular order.
AA10751929	You seem pretty set.  You might want to see what categories you are losing consistently in and trade to get those categories up.  I would drop Hughes and pick up Q. Richardson.  Actually how did you draft that team and how are you the 6th team?  I guess only 10 teams but still.  Also a big reason you probably dropped recently is because Ellis, McGrady, and Wade have missed games and now you have Williams out for a bit.  Just make the top 6 and kill in the playoffs.|`|470bb264366db1f96a56b2723fcb7574aa	i like you should sign chris webber if knicks get him but if not get emeka okeafor|`|e3a4075c6850002f169185ad414d1a75aa	package williams mcgrady and hughes,  Williams is hurt, mcgrady healthy now, but'll hurt soon enough. get 2 solid healthy dependable players somethin like a rip hamilton and josh howard, and some bench warmer spot starter, look into mike miller too.

J. Rich broke his wrist and is out at least 2 months,Peja- back surgery and West is still out with back surgery. Q is someone you want to avoid, not at all consistant and with that team who knows what will happen next. If Webber signs with the Pistons or Lakers (2 logical destinations and places he claims to like) it may be worth a flyer to pick him up. He wont give a lot but either of those teams will look for offense from him and as long as he shoots close to the basket he will give points, and FG% along with 5-6 boards. Jack is a decent option but you are deep at PG so I wouldnt pick him up. Smith will be the 3rd option behind Melo and A.I. so he may get less numbers the rest of the way. Package any combination of TMac, Cassell, Stoudamire or Hughes and try to make a deal for a good forward or center. Your guards are good enough to compete but forward depth needs improving. Try to make a deal and in the mean time pick up Danny Granger. Good Luck!|`|159bcae5a808af6318c8d759a43b4073aa	Def. pick up Danny Granger for Damon Stoudimire.<br>  <br>  Also i would look to trade Andrea Kir. b/c he s just plain sucking (i traded him for Rashard Lewis in the beginning of the season and the guy thru in JR Smith in the trade so hopefully you will find an idiot like i did and get some good players for him)
092b70cb0b1d3fe108edfca028ce5ce7aa	you need to be getting low when you tackle and bending your knees and wraping your arms around him to make the momentum to make that tackle you just need to do that and have power in your legs to make the person with the ball go backwords.|`|9f7c3a6b1c85a2b25fdaadcc6f4cc32aaa	There are very seldom chances in a game to "build up momentum". Tackles usually take place by proper positional play and you should be in the right spot to make the tackle. Getting out of position to make a lights out hit will pay off occasionally but more often you will get burned and earn the wrath of your coach. Most good slobberknockers occur when the offensive player doesnt see you so the times will come and you will get a good shot in on occasion but let them happen,dont try to create a situation for it to happen.
pFyr5Jwfaa	it is a great trade if your getting Bosh, butler is good but hes only a little bit better then   Howard who gives around 22 and 10 a night and between camby and bosh, bosh anyday hes on a team who has won 8 of their last 11 and hes only getting better (hes shooting much more) camby's points total is going down due to iverson and melo getting most of the points and every other week camby is getting injured so if it were me i would do it anyday|`|bNlYFkB3aa	I'd rather have Bosh & Howard, all day long.|`|9f7c3a6b1c85a2b25fdaadcc6f4cc32aaa	Forget Funston...make the deal!!!! Camby will get another hangnail and miss a month so on that alone it is a good deal.|`|51HFQTeTaa	Yes Chris Bosh i a beast and Josh Howard is also a good young player.|`|85d9d8f3f4982a69f95c3d6509121e39aa	did you know camby is the #1 blocker this season?  well, if you trade him away, you'll lose the block and rebounds catagories.  josh howard is nothing special to me; bulter is better than him.  butler gets better freethrow and fieldgoal percentages.  chris bosh is good but doesnt compare to both your player combined.  well hope this help.  good luck with your desicion.|`|AA10613925	I would definitely do it. Butler, despite being the best overall SF this year, is just a little better than Howard, who has had a career year. Then, Bosh is WAY better than Camby, and much less injury prone. IT is definitely a great trade for you.
9f7c3a6b1c85a2b25fdaadcc6f4cc32aaa	Talk to the principal of your school and see if they would approve of having a player visit. If the answer is yes then you need to contact your local team and ask if they make players available for school visits. Every NFL team makes players available for these type events but they have guidelines of what they will and wont do and most have restrictions on when they will allow player visits. A lot will depend on how far away your school is from the teams hometown and exactly what the purpose of the visit is. They also partner with United Way and if you have a good program that fits the mold of the United Ways goals they might assist you in getting a player to visit as well. If you are just hoping to see an NFL player and just want an autograph then it wont work so be creative and do something that is productive for your school or community and you will have a shot at getting someone. All teams get thousands of requests so anything that is beneficial to education or enhances community life are your best bets....and a little persistance, if they say no at first dont give up and ask again year after year. And solicit the help of adults. Good luck!|`|87c0f600aa9fe5df24d0f7c80159f730aa	With your gammer skills it looks as if they are there and teaching the English class.....

9f7c3a6b1c85a2b25fdaadcc6f4cc32aaa	Rios is a rising star with incredible potential and hits in the middle of a potent lineup. Drew is a great hitter when healthy....there is the problem. His history suggests he will not play more than 120 games and since he inked a new deal there is no urgency to produce or concerns about staying healthy. When he is playing everyone wonders why they didnt pick him, then the injury bug bites him and that is when you are grateful you didnt own him. So Rios is the safer pick with a higher upside and is also a 20 SB guy with healthy wheels on top of the .300 ave and 20-15 HR potential.|`|dsYQARfmaa	Rios.  He had a staph infection last year, but that has been his only major health problem.  He has nothing but upside.  Drew is always dinged up and plays for money; he has his contract, so expect pedestrian numbers.
5d7f439011a6cbed3f40abae190694d3aa	Dont worry about Kendrick  (think about a Young Vlad)  Swings at everything but doesnt strike out.  Keep Kendrick he will be a very very very good 2ber.  Secondly Drop Biggio and pick up Gonzalez if you dont have a 1b.  He will help you out there and get you a bunch of hits and a good average.  (will be hard to get good rbi numbers in that park.) <br>  So Gonzo as your 1b and Kendrick as your 2b.  Trust me I have Kendrick on almost every team (on purpose)|`|9baf2ff7a2f2b7c7d19d37f78e25df8baa	Keep Biggio. He's usually good for OBS, average, and walks. Aurilla will be spliiting time at SS with Omar Visquel, but he will also be playing 1B, he's listed as a 1B on yahoo. Keep your lineup the way it is.|`|9f7c3a6b1c85a2b25fdaadcc6f4cc32aaa	Kendrick is a star in the making. Kid can flat out play and will easily outproduce Biggio in fantasy this year. Adrian Gonzalez has a very impressive bat and will hit in the middle of the Padres lineup (a testament to his hitting abilities) so cut Biggio and add Gonzalez, this would be easily your best lineup option of the players mentioned. Kendrick has hit for the following aves in his last 4 minor league stopovers .368, .367, .384, and .369. Obviously the kid can hit and he has very good power (could hit 20 bombs this season) and has good speed (could nab 15-20 sacks). Gonzalez hit 24 HR last year...so much for the theory that Petco kills the power numbers, oh yea, he also hit .304.
5d5f37f5c62e8fc8705b22eb86a38727aa	Does Garett Anderson even have a full time job right now?<br>  <br>  Coco Crisp should bounch back this year as last year he was thrusted into the spotlight as one of the big aquisitions. I would go with Coco.|`|9f7c3a6b1c85a2b25fdaadcc6f4cc32aaa	Crisp by a long shot. Anderson has faded the last 3 years and Coco did well until he had the nasty thumb injury last year. he played through a lot of pain and still put up solid numbers....if you have any doubts then compare Johnny Damons numbers from the 3 previous years to Crisps. Everyone agrees that Damon is a very good fantasy option, Crisps numbers during the last 3 years (not counting last season with the injury) are scary close to the same numbers Damon put up. Numbers dont lie and if you account for the injury you have to believe he will rebound and continue along a close path with the numbers of someone like Damon. In my drafts Damon has gone around the 5th round and Crisp around the 15th or later (sometimes not even picked)....now who wouldnt want Damon type numbers that late? Plus Crisp gets to hit in front of Ortiz and Ramirez, who do you think pitchers are going to give better pitches to.....translation: Crisp has a career year if he stays healthy!|`|goth8bY5aa	garrett anderson|`|DD5rxvtMaa	well, being that im a SOXFAN!!!!!!!.....i'll have to go with the breakfast cereal...lol<br>  <br>  GO SOOOOOOXXXXX!!!!!!|`|cd2e168d232fac9ce6bbab8fc1cd7eccaa	anderson is better by far.... he played with a foot injury all of last year and he still hit 280(a career low!) with 17 hr's with 85 rbi with no protection behind him. this year he's the healthiest he has been in 3 years. and believe he's got a big chip on his shoulder. put it this way:anderson had better numbers hurt than crisp had and he was healthy. anderson had zero errors last year too.|`|fbdb0efb498bf2702af5c1cb152d9574aa	Coco!
9f7c3a6b1c85a2b25fdaadcc6f4cc32aaa	My guess is he is healthier than the Wings are letting on. Last year he wore down as the playoffs got started so I think they are just keeping him healthy (plus a couple teams seemed to take a lot of runs at him before he got slightly injured). Really it makes no sense to risk him during this stretch and the Wings have been resting a few other guys a bit more, that is why some 3rd and 4th liners have piled up more minutes lately. Smart move on their part...now they need to take care of Hasek the last 2 games....healthy Dom= healthy run at a Cup....no Dom= no chance to win a Cup. They are actually getting healthier (including Zetterberg) than last season just in time for the playoffs (gonna miss Kronwall though).|`|4b630af2206ab6496f2ef1fcfee51cf2aa	Zettey will not be back until the playoffs Detroit has an easy schedule the rest of the way they will NOT risk it.|`|AA10564996	Yes Zetterberg is back and getting ready for the playoffs. He was suppose to come back last weekend but it didn't work out and he came back on tuesday.|`|AA11174280	He's been skating and in one of the pregame shows Babcock said Henric looked like he was ready to play, he was the best, fastest skater in practice but he didn't have the final say so on if he played, which he did not.<br>  <br>  I think they are saving him for the playoffs.<br>  <br>  He will probably play Thursday and/or Saturday to get warmed up for next Wednesday.<br>  <br>  Just like Lidstrom did not play Sunday, they cited lower back strain. <br>  <br>  If you go back every season to about this time Lidstrom takes a day off to rest up.|`|KZax85nfaa	Yes he could play but not at full strength and that would be a total mistake to make him play now ... He will be ready for game number 1|`|UiwXlUWZaa	i watched the game tuesday night and mickey redmond said that he wasn't quite ready to come back but he did travel with the team.they don't want to rush him and aggravate the injury again.
9f7c3a6b1c85a2b25fdaadcc6f4cc32aaa	It is a good trade for you. First of all Schilling is as injury prone as Sheets lately , dont let the good start fool you. If both stay healthy Sheets is clearly the better starter right now so well worth the gamble. Crawford is a top 10 player period! Damon is very good and likely outscores Crawford but after that is where you make up the difference. Power will not be as big a factor as some think, Crawford is continuing to uptrend his power numbers as he gains strength every year and this year he becomes a 20-25 HR hitter (keeps him pretty even with Damon). Crawford will hit for 10 or 15 points higher BA and will steal 30 more sacks than Damon (remember the yankees know if they green light Damon they likely take away better pitches from the hitter behind him). It is a fairly close overall trade but you get the best potential, Damon and Schilling have peaked professionally, Crawford and Sheets have not! So the potential for even better numbers exists (also take note of the TB lineup, they have a better group of hitters than people give them credit for...i.e., more opportunity for Crawford)|`|SRi6WZxuaa	Yes, I do not even know why you are hesitating.  Crawford is the best player in the deal and the only one close to a first round pick (which in fact he is).  Crawford will better Damon in SB by a huge margin, and this season will probably get more power, too, according to projections.  BA is similar.  Schilling is good, but not great anymore, but Sheets is top-five when he is healthy.  Even considering the health, I would take the deal if I were you.  It is arguable that Crawford alone is worth Damon and Schilling.|`|07c2327d319ba7562444fda22b315142aa	I am going to have to disagree with the others and say hold on to Schilling and Damon.  Sheets is not going to be as good as his start to the year has been.  I would prefer Damon to Crawford, although it depends on your team needs.  The guy that said Crawford will score more might not be right come the end of the year because Crawford does not have Jeter, Abreu and A-Rod batting behind him.  Damon has more power and is above average as far as Stolen bases.  If you are really hurting for steals and are set in the other categories, go for it.  Otherwise, try to hold on to Damon.  Good luck.|`|KtGUkEj3aa	Yes, absolutely, Curt Schilling hasn't been dominant for a few years. Neither pitched is very dependable for health however. On the other side, Crawford is an abolutely amazing fantasy pick, a top ten - fifteen player. he hits, steals bases and scores. the only thing damon might outscore him in is runs, becasue he plays in that Yankees lineup. If you can, I would definitely make the trade. Just look at Crawfords stats from last year.|`|UZFrK2Agaa	yes u shouldnt even think about this one. Crawford is way better than damon and sheets is a much younger schilling.|`|WetffGdcaa	If you receiving Crawford, yes! He is top 5 pick potential and is A SB machine. Sheets is injury prone but if he isnt hurt he is A Cy Young candidate and just look at his K/BB ratio last year, it was unbelieveable! Damon is alright but he is'nt on the level of Crawford in any categorie and Schill is aging but will still be good for atleast 170 K's and 12-14 wins but Crawford and Sheets is deffinately the better end of that deal.
9f7c3a6b1c85a2b25fdaadcc6f4cc32aaa	It would be a tremendous deal for you. You get Lee who is equal to Zito if not a bit better and Webb who is an elite fantasy option (wins are the only tough part for him...all the other numbers are top 10 or better) and Wright who has yet to hit his stride. Zito has so far struggled to live up to the "contract" and usually players that get these type deals never get it right the first year (too much pressure to live up to the deal). Bonds I would agree puts up monster numbers but you have to wonder what happens as soon as the record is set. We know what is motavating him right now....Barry being Barry you have to question whether or not he will care once he sets the record (he certainly doesnt conjure up thoughts of sacrificing for the team). Upton has gotten in some time in the outfield and might become outfield eligible in your league soon and should also be 2nd base eligible so you can move him around Chipper is great when he is healthy...that is the problem though, he cant manage to play more than 130 games a year tops so having Wright is a nice option. Plus it gives you more bargaining chips if you need to make a deal down the road. I would take the deal...it clearly improves you by a nice margain.|`|yrSPaV3laa	If you can get this deal, TAKE IT<br>  <br>  Bonds and Zito will fade almost for sure.  You get two quality SPs and a bopper with staying power.<br>  <br>  Take the deal.|`|0fbDoYVFaa	Of course you accept this trade because Bonds isn't going to put him these numbers for the whole year, once he passes Hank Aaron he probably won't even care about his stats anymore, he justs wants to break the record and Barry Zito is stuggling and he won't have a good year but I thing Wright is going to fantastic this year even though his hasn't been on his best so far and he'll hit about 30 HR and 120 RBI and 25 SB and Brandon Webb will give you 15 to 17 wins 170 to 180 SO and a 3.50 ERA and Cliff Lee would be a nice solid pitcher to have on your team.|`|4eac92e4d4c2f35101eff6da4c797f23aa	trade Bonds now.  Bonds is a great player but he is old and will not do any better then he is right now.  As the season progresses he is more likely to lose energy or get hurt, so get wright and webb now.  Zito is not even owned in my league nor should he be with so many strong young pitchers in the league right now|`|I5Suo7XOaa	do the trade. Bonds has been reported as having tightness in his hamstring and his left knee is feeling too good. Its only a matterof time before he gets hurt. get rid of him and do the trade. You get two solid pitchers and wright is a solid hitter. Bonds will get hurt and zito isnt having a great year. 7 earned runs last night
aKk2yyu0aa	I would take Brady Quinn.  With the pre-season he put up I would think he would by playing at some point this year. With Russel still waiting to get into camp you can just about write this year off so you would have him at most for only 2 of the 3 years.|`|9f7c3a6b1c85a2b25fdaadcc6f4cc32aaa	Go with Quinn. He has already shown flashes of what he can do and it appears the Browns are building an offensive line around him. Russell still isnt in camp so already he faces the likelyhood of sitting on the bench all year so that is one year down the tubes already. I think Quinn will be the better pro anyways....he has a far better grasp on the pro style offense and wont have to deal with the insanity of RaiderNation either. Quinn will be starting by week 4 so there is a possibility he can help later this year...Russell will not be able to offer that to you, not worth losing a full season in a keeper.|`|e8dc17534a482889f4d9235ad8b70102aa	Brady Quinn no doubt.<br>  <br>  Russell is overrated and raiders suck.
9f7c3a6b1c85a2b25fdaadcc6f4cc32aaa	Palmer...has anyone bothered to check his stats the last 2 years against the ravens? If people did then it is a no-brainer...he has lit them up both games. Palmer is an elite QB and should NEVER be on your bench when available. Obviously you took him in the 2nd round, if you have that much faith in him then you have to always start hime regardless of matchup. But the bottom line here is to check the stats Palmer has against the Ravens and it will become very clear to you why you should start him. They couldnt shut him down last year or the year before...what have they done to get that much better this year? START PALMER!!!!|`|PsLhc3yVaa	go with romo|`|6f56fbe220868b5399167e96e285a6d4aa	Romo -- Will have a lesser defense to pass through.

Drew and Pierre might be two to think about getting rid of. Word is that Pierre won't start.<br>  <br>  Really dont know how the pitching works in these leagues but the Angles have a solid pitching team with one of the best closers.<br>  <br>  I'll give you an 8|`|9f7c3a6b1c85a2b25fdaadcc6f4cc32aaa	Offensively very solid overall, you could easily upgrade from Pierre (lost his starting job) and Drew (bad back already and sure to visit the DL 3 or 4 times). Pitching could be a huge problem, Escobar and Lackey are both injured (along with Shields) so you are out their top 2 starters and a key bullpen guy. Might see what other possibilities are out there pitching wise, that staff could be a big question mark al season if either Lackey or Escobar are out long term (and it looks like Escobar could be done for the year, who knows with Lackey he might miss a big chunk of time also). Find a better pitching staff and better sticks than Pierre and Drew, otherwise you look real solid.|`|LHXCIHYGaa	U will prbly dominate in RBI HR and RUNS and reyes solidifies the SB department so i think ur offensively balanced.<br>  <br>  U have trble with angels pitching though.......|`|Vfdfp2TYaa	i think ellsbury is a bit overrated. look for him to have a mediocre year this year.<br>  <br>  still, an 8.
9f7c3a6b1c85a2b25fdaadcc6f4cc32aaa	Good?...how about great deal for you. You get the better of the 2 pitchers (in my mind only Santana ranks ahead of Peavy).I like Zambrano but really no contest in that matchup. At worse assuming Wells is healthy and returns to previous form you still end up with an outfielder that is without a doubt his equal. Markakis will hit for a higher ave. and hit more HR, RBI should be close but Wells (again if healthy) will steal more bags. Kent is a nice throw in, obviously he was a bench guy for you so nothing lost there. I say you did very nicely for yourself.|`|9HaamdOnaa	not sure
9f7c3a6b1c85a2b25fdaadcc6f4cc32aaa	Damon. The guy has lost his starting gig and his numbers have been in steep decline for almost 3 years now. He shouldnt be a part of your fantasy roster, take the potential with Fukudome. Also you should not be dropping the likes of Weekes, Beltre or Delmon Young. All are still young and all have produced solid numbers before and have tremendous upside. I gaurantee you if you drop one of those guys they will be claimed very quickly and will likely come back to haunt you, deal 1 or 2 of them if you want but cutting them would be foolish. Good luck!|`|owcxennJaa	Drop Damon or Teahen.|`|3zeBMzVSaa	definetly Damon. He's not even starting. Also you have too many OFers on your bench.

9f7c3a6b1c85a2b25fdaadcc6f4cc32aaa	No, once he becomes the property of any other team they can not prevent any type of deal. If Tampa and GB enter into a no trade deal they would be in violation of anti-trust laws (collusion) and Favre would be declared a free agent by law. THe NFL would face federal sanctions also so no way that kind of arrangement can be leagally made.Contract law prevails over any agreement by teams, MLB learned this the hard way when they were forced several years ago to pay millions when they were found guilty of collusion. Of course they can expect Tampa to honor the gentlemens agreement amoung teams to respect certain etiquette so Tampa wont make a move once they acquire him (assuming they do). I understand where you are going with this but no way TB risks credibility, they only would trade for him would be to help themselves. <br>  <br>  |`|ALJ3K9UDaa	Nope i dont think so. They would have to agree with the trade but i honestly think that Brett deserves to go to the Vikings. The Packers need to realize that without Brett they would be just a loser team who hasnt been to the playoffs in....who knows how long....the packers are a great team because Brett was there. He had a lot to do with the trades for other great players and he was the reason the Pack became so close as a team. They owe it to him.|`|GIVarsPnaa	Based on the current events on Favre, I say no. Packers want Rodgers to be the QB and obviously Favre wont accept being a backup. He has rejected to stay in retirement and the Packers wont take a chance to release him because they dont want the Bears/Vikings to claim him. The only possible option is trading him to the Bucs or something. We'll have to wait and see. Things are already bizarre as they seem.|`|AA10064730	I think the Packers can put a clause in the trade that he cannot be traded.|`|Z0ZzHeMSaa	if im correct, tampa can do whatever they want with favre after the packers trade him. But he may just end up staying in green bay. from what ive heard hes on the roster and it'll be a battle between him and rodgers for starter spot. but u cant really put favre on the bench, so if rodger wins bretts traded im sure.|`|SMdjS3bDaa	I'm not sure but with the Vikings putting in the "poison pill" a couple of years back, I wonder if the Pack can put in a stipulation preventing another trade after he gets traded to whoever....|`|6a0dd7563167279d8fff996ef06631f5aa	Sure they can.  It's called a conditional trade.  If the team they traded him to turned around and re-traded him they could face league punishments such as loss of draft picks, fines, etc.<br>  |`|RB9Y8p8Yaa	no 
9f7c3a6b1c85a2b25fdaadcc6f4cc32aaa	Hockey will never gain mainstream success like baseball, football and basketball simply because it is a regoinal sport and is too expensive to take hold in most cities. And that is okay, the one thing that being a fan (and player) has taught me is that the typical hockey fan is far more passionate about their teams than in every other sport. This isnt a critisizm of fans of other sports but until you have actually attended a game it is hard to understand how crazy passion at games can be. As fans the one thing we can do is take a freind to a game and let them experience it firsthand, everyone I ever did this for has found their way back to a game and gotten hooked. So strickly from a fans standpoint what we need to do is introduce the game to freinds (take them to a local rink and let them watch the Pee-Wee kids, they see the game at a slow pace and see the effort, they "get it"). I can make a list the NHL could do but those are mostly obvious. |`|FEIXGtQyaa	I think right now hockey is as popular as it ever will be... Cities really only get into a specific sport, other than football, if the team is doing well. I know that's what happened here in Pittsburgh when the Penguins did well....<br>  <br>  I say, be happy with the fans we have now, and if others want to get into the sport - let them get into in their own terms.|`|MiWKmKgvaa	For starters- VS. needs to start broadcasting more games, and they should have smoething like Saturday night Hockey, as well as 4 other games that week, NBC should still take the Saturday afternoon spot, and maybe get a small contract with ESPN for a thursday night hockey as well as 1 more game that week.  Also, i think a great idea would be if teams, esp. in warmer climates, helped the expense of hockey by building outdoor rinks for pick up roller hockey.  There is this one outdoor rink that i went to from the start, and now getting on the ice is even rare there are so many people, we have 3-4 teams of around 10, whereas at the beginning we might be able to feild 2 teams of 6, but the place is a great place to go and everyone loves to talk about hockey there, some of whom are now hooked when they were dissing hockey without even watching a game.  And the best part about the place is that all you need is a cheap pair of maybe 20-30 blades, and a 20 dollar stick, and youre ready to go, and the uncompetetiveness(definitely not a word) is almost nice because you can just fool around, try and imitate youre favorite players, and youre free to do what you want, and everyone ther enjoys it a lot, and surprisingly there is no vandilism or anything, mostly because people respect the place so much|`|AA10370968	Never shutting down the season would be a good start.<br>  <br>  In the short term, ditch the pointless commercial breaks during the period.  It seems every time there's an offsides call or the puck leaves the ice, they break 60 seconds as the players skate around in circles.  Lose that and brag about how intense and uninterrupted the action during the periods is.  (That's a big contrast to the NBA and NFL.)<br>  <br>  In the long term, get the NHL back on ESPN.  I don't care how much more VS. is paying; it's not worth the lack of publicity.|`|y29GSws0aa	Hi<br>  <br>  As I read your question, it says what can "we" do. Well we can invite any of our none hockey watching friends to a game. Rather it is NHL or ECHL, get them to a live game. A friend of mine hates sports, made her go to a game and now loves hockey. We, as fans, are the best advertisements. We spread the word and promote the sport. Someone said something about Saturday night games. If you have Center Ice why not invite 10 coworker/ casual friends over for a game and beer. May get some new friends and fan out of it. create conversation about it. Make it the water cooler talk. Creating that small buzz may lead to people spending more time following it. embrace the bandwagon fans and turn them into real fans of the game. <br>  <br>  Now I could go through and comment on half the answers here, but it not worth my time. Reality is most do not understand and are just spouting off because they think it is cool. ESPN rating for hockey never touched VS's, pay role is higher now then it ever was with out the cap. Bettman is making the owners money, who have to share that with the players due to the cap. There is much much more I could go into. Just get your friends to watch games with you and we will see the popularity of the fastest game on earth grow.<br>  <br>  Thank You.|`|bWEpq51oaa	the league needs more sean avery's, ever team should have one

They've done a great job of scouting and drafting good players from Sweden. I think we should call Detroit, Michigan a western suburb of Stockholm, Sweden.|`|UADHt07Zaa	Only if they can magically start playing solid defense in front of Luongo.|`|DvBPLP4saa	No, no I don't.|`|9f7c3a6b1c85a2b25fdaadcc6f4cc32aaa	They have the one ingredient that makes them a threat...a top goalie. As we all know a hot goalie has been known to steal a series or 2 but they also lack the other key ingredient...scoring ability. Goals are hard enough to come by in the playoffs even for offensively talented teams, I just dont see where they will be consistent enough to win more than 1 series. Based on the liability they face offensively and the fact they need Luongo to be a regular season workhorse just to get a 6 or 7 seed that they have no chance to do much come playoff time. Faced with the likelyhood of facing one of the top 4 teams (Wings, Ducks, Sharks & Stars) all of whom have solid goaltending, very good defenses and at least 2 solid scoring lines I honestly dont see where they can even get out of the 1st round. There is some good talent there, just not enough in a very deep western conference.|`|tMEosT3Waa	Not a chance.  Everyone is downing them for losing Naslund, Linden and Morrison.  Really that's not much of a loss.<br>  <br>  True Linden brought great leadership, but they've got lots of character already on that team(Willie Mitchell anyone?)<br>  <br>  Naslund super underachieved and has easily been happily replaced by Demitra, who if healthy will put up more points than Naslund.<br>  <br>  Morrison?  I'm not even going to comment...<br>  <br>  Bottom line, the team isn't really any better or any worse than last year, and well...they didn't even make the playoffs, the west is way too tight.|`|Uxq3l0kcaa	ahhahahahahhahahahhahahahahahhahahahhaah...|`|oj9IyuW2aa	lol, no. they traded brenden morrision to the ducks, and naslund to the rangers. and linden retired. |`|DNlEVqBsaa	no redwings again|`|6ShbEBYGaa	no jeff gordon is going to win it or chuck norris|`|1653f4ba4264154cda51126bd5ac4bb1aa	The Vancouver Canucks?<br>  <br>  No, I don't see it...|`|gNqqBl0Zaa	no way <br>  |`|DCNL73ZJaa	No but i hope they do|`|WnQ3fhVhaa	No I really don't see them hoisting the cup this year

He was a complete back. He could catch, throw, run and block. Barry was a great back, but he was not as complete as Walter. Imagine what Walter could have done with a great line like Emmitt Smith had. If he had a quality line to run behind, he would have untouchable records that Smith would not have come close to. If Barry had the kind of line Smith had he would have put up some incredible numbers also and Smith would only rank as #3 on the career yardage list. |`|9f7c3a6b1c85a2b25fdaadcc6f4cc32aaa	Tough call as they are both among the very best ever but my vote has to go to Barry Sanders slightly. Sweetness had the luxury of playing behind some pretty good offensive lines and ran under a solid system that was based on the running game and great defense. Barry usually had terrible lines with bad QBs so there generally speaking was no system, it was simply hand off the Sanders and hope he can make some magic with those feet. Barry had the most amazing vision and start/stop abilities I have ever (and likely will ever) seen and he did it under mostly very bad situations. This isnt to say Sweetness couldnt, I am just pointing out that he didnt have to and Barry did....and did it better than anyone I've ever seen.|`|Xps2hHWQaa	 WELL, CONSIDERING WALTER IS DEAD, AND BARRY NO LONGER PLAYS, WHO KNOWS?|`|RFILQS4daa	Sweetness|`|1i9mrq5Yaa	walter for sure|`|qX4Y79Psaa	Good question.  I think Payton is better.  It would have been nice to see Sanders as long as he could have.  In that case, he probably would still own all the records today.  But, he didnt and he didnt win a super bowl.  Both great hall of famers, but the nod goes to Payton in my book.|`|0P71zlECaa	Walter Payton |`|BQG15WsHaa	Sweetness.|`|F1MzoGkKaa	tough question<br>  but i believe barry sanders
9f7c3a6b1c85a2b25fdaadcc6f4cc32aaa	Drop Royal ,he is hurt anyways and you have a better chance of picking him back up than any of the other guys. Release any of the others and I am certain they get waiver claimed. Royal may not play today and Boldin might. If you arent sure and your matchup is very close without the TE numbers you might just bite the bullet and ride out a week without a TE. Sometimes it is a better risk longterm to ride out a potential loss over an unsure thing where you risk losing someone who can contribute the rest of the way. It really depends on where you rank in your league now and whether or not a free agent TE can really help in the first place (most are good for 3 or 4 points...is the risk greater than the potential reward?)|`|Cy37htUlaa	Ok what you can do is drop Winslow about 5 minutes before game time at noon so nobody will notice and then pick him up after your other TE has played. Or I would drop Eddie Royal. If you have 2 defense's to choose from drop 1 and you can still keep Winslow on the roster |`|5IFxapz8aa	Royal is the drop here. No one else should be dropped. Think the TE you pickup will get 3 points maybe. Another option is eat the points and start Winslow. Do not drop anyone but Royal.

Seriously, it'll put you off to a good start.  People come in all sizes, shapes, and swings so I'd recommend going to a pro shop to get fitted.  For example, if you have big hands, a thin grip on the club will land you somewhere in between not being able to swing optimally to completely screwing you up.<br>  <br>  Don't worry about brand names so much, most of them use really advanced technology so the difference is really hard to tell.|`|MXDjKRPOaa	it depends......they vary from person to person.....eg. the best clubs for a player who does not often hit the ball in the centre of the clubface would be ultra-forgiving cavitys of some sort OR a player who strikes the ball well and wants a bit more spin, feel and control should play with blades of some sort, but blades would not work for a player whoes striking is not as good as blades are extremely difficult to hit..........hope that answered your question|`|U6BMxOYYaa	first what is the best you mean?<br>  if you mean the look,.then you can find all the golf club style on my blog below.,<br>  now, more golfer using hybrid one :-)<br>  find yours here
CL040gRjaa	I saw some boards online that said "second" too. They were a bit cheaper than the new boards. Second means "blemished" and refers to small scratches or imperfections on things like the graphics that make it so they can't sell the board as new. They're still good, usable boards.
K5AeQuSNaa	Bullet weight isn't really an issue.  Any factory loaded ammunition will take the bullet weight into account, and have an appropriate charge that keeps it in SAAMI specs.  It will be safe to shoot in any modern handgun.  P+ just means that the round is at the upper end of the SAAMI guidelines.  It still falls in the allowable pressure limits, but it is hotter than standard rounds.  This is also safe in any modern firearm.  It will, however increase the amount of wear and tear on the gun.  Much more so than standard ammunition.  A steady diet of this stuff will shave thousands of rounds off of your firearm's effective service life.  But since most modern firearms have a service life of 100,000 rounds or more, it isn't that big of a deal.  +P+, on the other hand, or any of the other variations that people come up with to describe rounds loaded like it, are over SAAMI specs.  They should not be used in anything other than custom guns designed to use them.  A few probably won't hurt your gun, but why risk it?  Leave those to the race gun crowd, and those with feelings of personal inadequacy.<br>  <br>  For personal protection, I would recommend a name brand jacketed hollow point.  Regular or P+.  The 115 and 124 grain bullet weights seem to have the best record for stopping power.  I would get at least 3 boxes of whatever you plan on using, from the same production lot.  That way you can use a box or two of it in your pistol to see how accurate it is in your particular firearm.  And make sure that it cycles reliably.  These are important factors with a personal protection firearm.  Then save the rest of it for actual use.  In 9mm, I still have a box of Black Talons from the early 1990s that I know function flawlessly in one of my glocks.  I still have enough for a full magazine, should I need it for personal protection.  When I got a compact, I went and experimented with some of the more modern (and available) ammunition.  I found that the 115 grain Wincherster P+ silvertips worked well in it.  So I bought a half dozen boxes of it, and practice with it every so often.  The rest of the time I shoot regular winchester target and range 9mm through it, as it has a similar point of impact out to 25 yards.  And it is WAY cheaper to shoot.  Good luck, and have fun finding out what shoots best in your gun.  Hopefully that means lots of range time for you.<br>  <br>  (edit)<br>  Wow, it looks like we were all visited by the thumbs down farie.  Hey chimp boy, this is a hunting and firearms related forum.  If you don't like guns or gun related threads, stay the hell out.  Don't go through and give everybody a thumbs down to try to impress your screwball friends down at Starbucks.|`|6KaMW1Vzaa	The +P isn't the same thing as bullet weight. The P stands for "pressure," and denotes a round that's above the standard pressure for the cartridge. Keeping the propellant charge down to keep pressures normal will allow you to shoot many bullets of heavier weight in your pistol, even if it isn't rated for +P loads. What you may have problems with is that autoloaders are by nature finicky about the shape of the bullet they'll feed reliably, but the weight shouldn't be that big an obstacle to you.|`|fXTcFuUjaa	From what I have seen, is the 1911 barrels on the newer 9mm are match grade barrels and can take the beating but are not recommended because they wear down your gun prematurely if you use them a lot. Just buy a bunch of ammo and shoot it and figure out what you and your gun both like, if you need more power get a different gun.|`|ca6144d7933bfd99d11441a498f7e603aa	Due to liability issues, if you were forbidden to fire any 9mm round in your weapon, it would be clearly stated in the manual. The hotter rounds and heavier bullets may kick so hard you won't want to shoot them. Try some of each to see what is best for you and your gun.|`|oZj6DfpKaa	You have two different subjects here.  Bullet weight and cartridge charge.  The issue with bullet weight is that as you get into heavier projectiles on standard charges, it takes more power to get the projectile moving, hence the slower speeds.  The effect of this can be not enough recoil action to effectively cycle the weapon and you will get jams.<br>  <br>  As a counter to this, the +P cartridge comes into play.  +P on a heavier projectile is not sooo much an issue but +P loads on standard projectiles is more of an issue.  <br>  <br>  Call Springfield and talk to a Cust Svc Rep.  They will say not to as a safety issue.|`|AA12290851	If your gun does not have +P stamped on it some where in plain sight, don't shoot +P rounds in it, please. Only newer guns stamped with +P are made to stand up to the extra pressure. You can get 124's and such in standard loads. Just make sure that if your gun does not have +P stamped on it, don't shoot rounds with +P on the box. If you will give us your make and model some one on here will know for sure if it's made to take +P rounds. Guess what I am saying is it is safer to take on the world with standard rounds in a +P firearm than to try to shoot +P out of a standard gun.<br>  <br>  Be safe. <br>  <br>  Dave|`|xo4WObMiaa	If it states that +p ammo can be used, then you can use it with no harm done.<br>  Loading +p ammo in a gun that doesnt handle it can be very dangerous.<br>  To be on the safe side you should just stick with the standard loads, you can get some very potent 9mm hollow-points with standard loads that would do the job.|`|dpSr0icwaa	any 9x19mm handgun is going to be able to handle ALL 9x19mm ammunition in any bullet weight, from 148 grains all the way down to 95 grains.<br>  <br>  What you want to look at is if your handgun is rated for +P ammunition.  Heck, even if it is not, you can safely shoot small amounts of the stuff, it just won't stand up to a steady diet +P|`|OAEuYZkZaa	I was under the impression that the 134 grain and 115 grain weights WERE the standard weights for the 9mm P and that the 147 grain bullets were the heavyweights.<br>  <br>  I don't think that any 9mm P cartridge will give you any problems with your pistol.  The only thing is that one bullet weight will probably provide better accuracy than others.  <br>  <br>  FWIW, I've heard nothing but bad things about the performance of the 147 grain 9mm bullets.  Especially the sub-sonic loads.  The only advantage the 9 mm has over a .38 Special is velocity, and the 147 grain sub-sonic loads sacrifice that advantage and leaves only ammo capacity of the pistol as an advantage over a .38 SPL revolver.<br>  <br>  Back in the day when I carried a 9mm P pistol, I used Federal Premium 115 gr. JHP's, the 9BP load.  In those days it was the top rated 9mm P loading on the market.  I've no idea what takes the honors these days.<br>  <br>  Do a little research to compare performance of various loads.  Select several to test and take them to the range.  Fire two five shot groups with each load and see which one gives you the best accuracy.  That load is the one you should use.<br>  <br>  Doc|`|Z8UV6S3baa	So I am not necessarily an expert, but I know a bit about this. First off there is something called SAAMI (Sporting Arms and Ammunition Manufacturer's Institute) which publishes the maximum and nominal pressures allowable for different calibers. This represents how much gas pressure can be generated by a given caliber. Modern factory loaded defense loads all stay within these SAAMI specifications. In fact, generally they will say this on the box somewhere.<br>  <br>  So, your Springfield will handle any factory loaded 9mm ammunition regardless of the bullet weight, because these are all loaded within the SAAMI perameters and the gun will survive any of those.<br>  <br>  Now, that doesn't mean heavier bullets will shoot well in it. For some reason my Glock 19 doesn't particularly like 147 grain subsonics, I don't know why, they don't group well out of that gun, but the group perfectly out of my guns with longer barrels.<br>  <br>  So, go ahead and shoot whatever you like. However, if you start reloading yourself you will have to pay closer attention to these things.<br>  <br>  Thinkingblade

1jmXT4Vvaa	I've never heard of barrel damage, but they do pose a serious fire hazard.  There was a company a few years ago that was making a 'cool' tracer.  I wish I could remember more, but it seems like it was some special load that addressed the fire issue.  They didn't burn like a normal tracer, but were almost as visible.  My advice is if you are going to mess around with tracers, do so on a very wet or snowy day.  I wouldn't touch one off in the woods in August, but I'm sure you already knew this.  They can be amazing tools to teach ballistics.  You can easily see how range, wind, etc can affect your shot.  Not to mention they can just be plain fun.|`|mOTCr8Pxaa	Tracers do run hotter than regular rounds. Out here in AZ you can buy them but they pose a serious fire hazard.

qVDY1hm5aa	I feel the same way as you do 'Clown'. I think this is the match that will be remembered for decades and decades to come. 'Taker and HBK have entertained us for over 10+ years and I can't believe it's finally (soon) coming to an end. Undertaker and Michaels will NEVER be forgotten and will be remembered as two of the best superstars to ever step foot inside a squared circle. I'm sure they'll both be given big ceremonies like Ric Flair and hopefully be inducted into the HOF, some time soon. It's time to let go of the phenom, the deadman, The Undertaker. It's time to let go of the showstopper, the icon, the heartbreak kid Shawn Michaels. But before we do, they're going to give us one last kick-butt match at the 25th anniversary of WrestleMania!|`|b4s0iroSaa	i think there are 3 weird things going on WWE right now.<br>  1) HBK vs. undertaker (legend vs. legend)<br>  2) Randy Orton vs. Triple H (Legend killer vs. king of kings)<br>  3) Matt hardy vs. Jeff Hardy (brother vs. brother)<br>  <br>  i support HBK, Triple H and Jeff.|`|nJEhamgeaa	it's going to hurt me  in any situation|`|6LQNK51uaa	How much of weight have u lost after the confession....lol<br>  <br>  But yes this year is something which can make u feel sad,we all know since 2007 that these Legends r near their retirement..they r not in good shape and their body can say "Enough" anytime soon...so lets just hope for more from these two Legends.
UxooffHZaa	Brett Favre's consecutive games streak. Injuries are just too prevailent.<br>  <br>  But then again, coming into the Salary Cap era, I thought for sure the Steelers 4 Superbowls in one decade was untouchable, but rather than what I thought the cap would create, we had one team with 3 super bowl wins (the Patriots), and another with 2! (the Steelers) If you rally up how often these two teams are in playoff games, and AFC championships, the 2000s were dominated. Just like the 70s were by the Steelers, and the 80s were by the 49ers.

LdKrWpkVaa	yes and no. if x amount of pressure is applied to a regular piece of line, not attached to a rod, it will break, however when you include factors like the drag on a fishing reel, this will allow a fish to put x amount of pressure on the line, and instead of breaking, more line will pull out of the reel, reducing stress on the line. fishing knots also make the line easier to break, so be sure to use one that retains the highest percentage of line strength|`|5bf66864f5e85f953cdb3ff01887ae4daa	Yes!<br>  However often the more expensive co-polymer and fluorocarbon lines will break above that stated breaking strain.<br>  <br>   BUT this does not take into account the amount of stretch each line has, it also doesn't take into account the sharp pulls of a fish when hooked.|`|KJWxqQHiaa	Yes, at least it supposed to. But, when tying a knot, you lose most of the line strength. It's a fact that the Palomar Knot let's you KEEP 95% of your strength of line. It's a cool fact, found it out on a TV Show called "The Knot Wars".<br>  <br>  Hope i helped ya out.|`|q8dX0MsNaa	theoretically, yes. strength will be lost when you tie a knot so it is important that you tie good knots that will retain the highest percentage of the rated test.<br>  a palomar is about the strongest one to use when tying on a hook. <br>  l like the trilene knot or the improved clinch for tying on lures.|`|1b98dcf55f3a990e7013ba04e6691faaaa	As a general rule; yes.  But not necessarily.  Some fishing lines will break above their rated poundage.  If you are trying to set a line class fishing record, make sure that you use a class test fishing line that is guaranteed to break at or before the stated poundage.

eHcXI4jFaa	NZ is underated by some teams, but not usually by teams that they play regularly (like Aus).  Overconfidence is not the right word.  The fans may have been arrogant and overconfident, but if Dhoni and co had half a brain they would take NZ in NZ seriously (at least in the shorter versions of the game).  I think it is showing at the moment that India and their captain Dhoni are not bating intelligently.  If India are even half as agressive on certain NZ pitches in the ODIs they could be in trouble.  Indian batsmen tend to play square of the wicket, which is fine on Indian pitches but can get you into trouble in NZ.  Khan and Singh are bowling well, Pathan incosistently *but great at the end last night, well, almoslt).  So more shots down the ground, cover, point, will serve them well (that is why the aussies always play well in NZ).  For how to play I recommend watching Ross when he is not trying to slog over midwicket.  very good down the ground and on the offside, when he is not slogging.  Don't forget that things will not be as easy in ODI with Mills (rranked 5th at the moment) comes back so that will be another excellent bowler to contend with.  <br>  <br>  Plus, India's strategy must be brought into question, leg slip and stump limne to McCullum, not bowling Sharma because they thought the others would swing more, when he swings the most.  The only reasn why it was so close was because of half an over of good bowling and poor NZ batting in the middle overs, needing to be better at working the ball.|`|rjWRMDYUaa	india is paying from their bad luck in first two 20-20..<br>  NZ is not underrated,don't get worried remember that india has not played a single practice match,so this is always a possibility whenever team india goes aboard they were always loose their opening games.<br>  i think we have not played that much bad so than anybody says we are not the best side of the world......<br>  we are champions........<br>  just wait and see...|`|J7oFxMI9aa	Any team that can give Australia a run for their money cannot be all that bad. <br>  <br>  And they did it in Australia if I am not mistaken.

It also depends on who else you can get. I personally like having one bench player for my hitters, and the rest for pitching. You can usually find an ample substitute for an injured hitter, but pitching, especially relief pitching, is hard to get once there is an injury so three is how I like to play it safe.|`|jhW213iKaa	I usually go for three closers. With closers going on the DL and others losing their job during the season, it never hurts to have an extra. And they don't usually hurt your ERA that much, as they only pitch an inning at a time.<br>  <br>  However, that's for closers. Just for relievers in general that aren't closers, very rarely do I have one. Despite great K/IP numbers and ERA numbers, they pitch so few innings in a week that it doesn't really help me. It's more useful to have another starter. The only time I'll pick up a regular reliever is if I have a vacant RP spot and there are no closers available. Then I'll usually resort to picking up the best reliever available.<br>  <br>  Good luck.|`|7JEWBeEjaa	I usually start with 2 but i increase it to 3, during the season.

YsVZPN5taa	okay, so contrary to common belief, form on the ergs does NOT necessarily translate to crappy times.  of course, this is not saying that you shouldn't focus on technique, I'm just saying there are other things you could do that would more significantly improve your 2k score.  For example, you should come up with a specific race plan.  Depending on your desired time, you should write down an outline in which you set specific times for you to hit in every 500.  your first option would be to start out fast at the first 500, and go a beat higher in each subsequent 500.  however, I prefer to use the negative split method.  of course, a split is a reference to the time it takes you to row 500 meters...it's the big number usually in the center of the monitor.  In order to do the negative split technique, you need to have extreme willpower and desire to succeed.  First, in the first 500 you start out 3 beats above your desired split.  In each subsequent 500, you bring your split down a beat until in the last 500 m you go all out, as hard as you can go.  <br>  <br>  This always works for me, however, it is not a fool proof plan.  If you relaly are convinced that your technique is the culprit, then just remember to sit up tall on the erg.  Towards the end of your piece, it will be extrememly hard.  nothing is better for you then if you keep your back straight.  If you do this, it will allow your lungs to fully expand and therefore you will be better able to take in a distribute oxygen.

That or trying to hide the bloodshot eyes.<br>  <br>  2) No deal, 42 dollars would be 41.99 too much<br>  <br>  3) No dog, I have to prove myself with plants first.<br>  <br>  4) People like things that are different, I see a lot of fans wearing the retro jerseys here ( there are 4 or 5 of them) Although most are wearing the one that looks like the current one except darker red and CA instead of the CH<br>  <br>  5) She might like hockey and not make me watch American idols dance with the stars in hell's kitchen<br>  <br>  6) <br>  a)It's winter up here<br>  B) if I am in Tampa a Drunken homes in heels may step on my feet.|`|WnQ3fhVhaa	1) Maybe he wears the tint to protect his eyes from the red light of all the goal lights he lights . <br>  2) For a fan of Sittler that would be a deal. But for the rest of us , not so much. Unless you are going to start a bad fashion idea museum <br>  3) My doggies would not wear jerseys . They tend to pull each others collars off. I really wouldn't want to spend that money and then find shreds of jersey everywhere .<br>  4)I still think most fans would want a "real" jersey as opposed to just one for signatures. I am sure the material would be very much different and cheap. Some may try to wear it and then it would rip and fall apart . Not cool . <br>  5) I used to have a pair of the Panther ones. I would wear them to every game. But I lost one. They have some great sterling silver ones, that I would love to buy. Not tacky at all.<br>  6)Hard to run around the arena in flip flops. Too many people step on my toes as it is. With sneakers I have at least a little protection.|`|XQoH9ZI5aa	1.) Next question<br>  <br>   2.) Rip Off. I can probably go to my old house and dig through the attic and find a pair......they wouldn't be Darryl Sittler's but I could probably find some that belonged to my brother Darryl.<br>  <br>   3.) Are you stuck in the 80's? They DO have jerseys for dogs.......however, jerseys are fashion faux pas........yes, even on dogs. My dog does have a Flyers collar however (an Eagles one too).<br>  <br>   4.) People will buy whatever.........crazy kids.<br>  <br>   5.) TACKY IMO.........VERY tacky.<br>  <br>   6.) Can't name two.......this is MY fashion faux pas...........hockey isn't in the summer (NHL anyways) so I guess I can name one reason why.........frostbitten toes. (quit laughing.........better than crocs)|`|1ApbWVhsaa	1)Funny<br>  <br>  2)I'm trying to forget one of the best moments in hockey history-Gretz scoring 50 in 39- and seeing Billy Barber lunging to stop him in those Cooperalls.Rip Off and mad at you for reminding me aboot em :)<br>  <br>  3)NO NO NO NO NO..clothes on dogs???ugggggghhhh..Unless you're a hollywood star and had your own porno...nope not even then...<br>  <br>  4)That's a brutal idea there.Might as well sign my new Daryl Sittler cooperalls that I just bought on EBay.<br>  <br>  5)Not tacky because my girl wears em.Only to games though.LOL ..Now if I wore them then a different story<br>  <br>  6)Most people have ugly feet and people might puke on your toes if they drank too much..I remembered:)<br>  <br>  Ok I was going to pat you on the back but you did bring up Avery and Cherry now I must pat you on the......Never mind....<br>  <br>  Have a good weekend H.|`|G33E41IBaa	1) Haha, yes.<br>  <br>  2) Rip off!  He may be super famous, but I don't want a man's used pants.<br>  <br>  3) They actually do make jerseys for dogs!  I know the Prudential Center sells them.  I wouldn't get one for my dog because he doesn't like to have clothes put on him (but don't worry we don't dress him up in ridiculous foo-foo clothes!  He just has a sweater when he goes outside because it gets cold up here).<br>  <br>  4) It depends what the fourth jersey looked like, but for the most part I think people would stick to regular home/away jerseys because I can't possibly imagine what an autographable jersey would look like...<br>  <br>  5) I personally find it very tacky.  I don't know what it is, but there's something about the earrings that I find pretty weird...Especially those Zamboni earrings (gag).<br>  <br>  6) 1 - It's COLD<br>  2 - You could get your feet stepped on in the mad dash to beat the traffic.|`|Pc0QjrQ4aa	1) Maybe so...maybe that's his weakness!  <br>  2) $4200?  Total ripoff.  That's 1/3 of my annual tithe to MLSE.  I fear what the winner of these will do with them.<br>  3) They already do make jerseys for dogs.  My male hound (I have two greyhounds and volunteer in a greyhound adoption group in the GTA; thus proving I do, in fact, have a sliver of humanity) is currently at home, sleeping on his back (it's what he does) and farting in his Maple Leafs jersey, while my female is sleeping and farting in her Team Canada jersey.  One is on my tv chair, the other on my chesterfield (that's a sofa for our Americans).  Because apparently a dog bed that's been doubled up...clearly not good enough.  <br>  4) Thanks...you have a phone call from Gary Bettman on line 2.  He wants to thank you for this brilliant idea.  <br>  5) Maybe the NHL can put this together as part of the Official Puck Bunny Uniform.  Giant dangly earrings, makeup from the Tammy Faye method, overly done-up hair, cherry-red lipstick, a cardboard sign professing love to one's favourite player using said lipstick for writing, said favourite player's jersey with a boatload of autographs and unexplainable stains, one size-too-small jeans, and either sneakers or boots.<br>  6) Temperature, and potential food/drink spillage.  I'd also add (for guys) the untold horrors of the washrooms (especially if you have troughs instead of urinals, or your neighbour has accuracy issues.|`|xIfvXy4waa	1. No, it's because he thinks he's a total stud. Agreed, yuck yuck<br>  2. 4,200 for a pair of pants? Lol...<br>  3.

I have them for the Steelers. I hope its not tacky!<br>  6. When I get cold I start violently shaking and two I don't want my little feet stepped on.<br>  <br>  BTW- just wondering, what team are you a fan of?|`|AA11674745	1) Ovechkin put on sunglasses and a stupid hat during the All Star game. Was this because he can’t shoot a puck when he is not wearing overly tinted glass in front of his eyes? Yuck….yuck. <br>  <br>  A) Uhh, actually he was going incognito trying to evade the Crosby Mafia for being too.....what's the word.....too.....ROUGH with him.<br>  <br>  2) I am sure you guys remember Cooperalls came in a long plants version and a long shorts (or since we are talking 80’s….jams) version? I saw a pair of Toronto Maple Leafs Darryl Sittler Game Worn (preseason) Cooperalls on E-bay selling for $4,200. Ummmm, “Total rip-off” OR “What a Deal”? <br>  <br>  A) Ripoff. Call me a cranky old curmudgeon, but you will NEVER see me spend a penny for game-worn anything. Ahem, unless Jessica Simpson joins a mud-wrestling league.....<br>  <br>  3) If they started making jerseys for dogs, would you buy one for your pooch? If you do not have a dog…..why not….do you not like dogs? Don’t want the responsibility? <br>  <br>  A) I like dogs (let's go Eagles) but I cannot - for the life of me - figure out why people dress their pets in anything other than what they are naturally adorned with. I actually think it is kind of sick that people do that.<br>  <br>  4) If they sold something called a “4th jersey” for autograph signings, public appearances, and whatnot……and they sold for half the price of regular jerseys……would more people buy them……OR do people like to stick to the standard home or away jersey, no matter the cost? <br>  <br>  A) Everybody loves a bargain.<br>  <br>  5) Most NHL teams have dangle earrings that girls can purchase. Really think about it: If you see a chick wearing NHL earrings is that tacky? Why or why not? <br>  <br>  A) The Puckbunny Meter buries the needle at ten. Even bends the dang thing.<br>  <br>  6) Name 2 reasons why you should NEVER wear flip-flops to a hockey game?<br>  <br>  A) Too cold outside (above the 35th parallel) and Joe has a toe fetish.|`|UoUaO52taa	1. LOL, Showmanship. Shoudla gone all Dwight Howard an put on a cape<br>  <br>  2. RIP OFF. A game used jersey isn't worth that much<br>  <br>  3. Don't have a dog. Don't want the mess and being slobbered on though I did  have a dog<br>  <br>  4 I'd stick to my Vanek 3rd<br>  <br>  5) No b/c it just isn't<br>  <br>  6.

No offense to the dog lovers out there..... but I have my reasons.  <br>  <br>  4. I think people would stick to the normal home and away jerseys!<br>  <br>  5. Umm.... I say tacky!

A pair of Bobby Clarke worn Cooperalls sold privately about 5 years ago for $9000.  Clarkie is convinced he could have gotten $10K<br>  <br>  3) NO dog.  No time for dogs.  Would you want me bringing the pooch to the cabin?  I'm sure your husband to be would love watching the pooch while we drink Widmer.<br>  <br>  4) Jerseys are hugely popular.  I cannot figure out why.<br>  <br>  5)  Too much pop I see.  Or else you are trying to cover up the fact that you are the newest owner of a pair of bolt earrings<br>  <br>  6)  Beer and athlete's foot don't mix.  I can't think of reason to wear flip-flops...now when I need to, I can only think of one reason not to....and it involves beer!|`|oJsrGmmPaa	1) Lame...total miss by Hales!<br>  <br>  2) Rip off.<br>  <br>  3) I guess if I was going to a rival city or something, yeah. I don't have a dog, not because I don't like dogs, but because of the responbisibility. I have two cats who think they're dogs though!<br>  <br>  4) I still see Leafs fans with the Toronto St. Pats jerseys here and there so yes, I think people will buy them, but it depends on the fanbase. Somehow, I don't think the Coyotes would do well in that department....<br>  <br>  5) Yes, that is very tacky.<br>  <br>  6) Appear to be retarded, and it's freaking cold (at least north of the 47th parallel).|`|yHvh7tFlaa	Gotta stay away from that Jolt Cola,lol.

People really get hurt doing that stuff. I use to have this really hot teacher in highschool and she knew I BMXed and MTBed and all so she was constantly telling me stories about her brother's friends that all raced and one was paralyzed, others had concushions and all kinds of punctured and ruptured organs and stuff. It's a really dangerous sport and it's a whole different seperate sport from MTB or MX all together. Ur saying that if BMX racers ripped MTBs on their tracks then that would be reason in itse;f to wear full-face helmets and armour... why would the kind of bike they're riding have anything 2 do w/ their helmet and pads? <br>  <br>  You are a very grumpy person to be irritated by a certain sport and the gear the people wear when they do the sport lol. u need to chill out buddy. ur going to be miserable ur whole life if u let stuff like that bother you all the time<br>  <br>  Oh, and to say these people aren't going to get anywhere in life... like wtf??? They already ARE somewhere in life! They're doing what they love! They arent sitting around on computers complaining about other people's sports and passions. u r a grumpy person<br>  <br>  and i dont race any kind of bikes, but I never had any desire to do anything at all on a dirtbike. I like pedaling my bikes and hucking them off of things rather than launching a heavy dirtbike off of piles of dirt and relying on a hyraulic suspension to save my a$$. try that on a BMX or a hardtail MTB and see what happens.

PIu1ZcYEaa	Wow, Great matchup. Who would'nt wanna see this one? In fact i've give your left arm and Blog's right leg to see this one. (of course I'd pitch in with hotdogs and beer.) Two Middle legends. The old term 'Bloodbath' would be very fitting here.<br>  Both these guys beat in their weight class and even beyond into the heavy's.<br>  Ketch was probably one of the hardest hitting middles ever, with the exception of maybe Bob Fitzsimmons at middle. Yet Walker is considered one of the P4P greats. Stan's ferocious destroy whats in front of him attitude (ala Dempsey.) vs. Mickeys do-or-die at all cost attitude. I give the edge in power to ketch, but boxing ability to Mickey. I slightly favor Stanely in this bout because of his ability to Ko about anyone with either hand from odd angles. Mickey would probably go in, feel Stan's power and try to bulldog him back with his own power and his never give up or back down attitude. And this is were Stanely prevails. No doubt Ketch would have some rough moments in there though. Stanely by ko in late rounds.<br>  However, if they fought more than once, I feel they could both have wins and losses over each other. I could Walker taking the second fight. Because Mickey is the better boxer. Walker did fight very hard hitters and won. And slick fighters and won. I think Walker will realize in the first fight he met a fighter who hit harder and was a bit rougher. So in Mickey's second bout with Stanely he not only uses his power and toughness but combines it with his better skills.Mickey was clever enough to know toe-to-toe want get him there. He fights smart in this second bout.<br>  Someone like Ketchel with brutal Ko power and extreme roughness can get very far. Yet they can tend to rely on that alone too much. So Stanely takes the first match on these qualities.  In the second match stanely goes in thinking it worked the first time, it will work again. But Mickey, along with being very strong and tough himself, also had very good boxing skills and cleverness. He dosent make the same mistake in the second match. Walker with a points win in second bout.<br>  And their 3rd. match anyone?|`|8Sw8rJgtaa	I love this matchup,both fighters are kind of similar.They are roughly the same height,weight,and have the same demeanor,both even fought up to heavyweight.They are underrated in their boxing ability also,both were extremely good at rough power fighting but could also be good technically,which is seen in their records against slick boxers.This meeting would be fought doing what they liked to do best and that is fight rough.Both of these guys would keep going strait ahead trying to impose their will on each other.Lots of good body work and inside fighting.This would be in every sense of the word a fight.Bloody,battered and beaten they would go into the late rounds looking for an opening to end it as quick as possible.Considering Ketchel had 49 k.o. in 52 wins says a lot,in that era of boxing it was hard to knock guys out and was not common due to great defense and being able to tie up more but that also counts as defense.That leads me to believe Ketchel had a crazy amount of punching power and in the 15th would finally catch Walker flush and end it.|`|Fx2lB9LYaa	this fight would be a war i think ketchel might win late in the fight by ko remember he knocked down the 220lb jack johnson|`|thcr8Y5vaa	Mickey Walker...|`|kqP7GwOcaa	Damn good fight, this one would have been something to see.  I think Micky Walker would have brought enough to get past Ketchel, but man it would have been a hell of a fight.<br>  <br>  Walker by decision.
Yg1QR4mmaa	Jose Napoles would dispose of Palamino in the later rounds, he was good and he went the distance with Duran, but I believe and this is just my opinion that Napoles had more one punch power at welterweight then Duran. Palamino was a good workman-like fighter but he would of been methodically taken apart by Napoles. The early rounds would see Palamino come out in a busy throwing style but it would also see him run into right hands consistently. By the middle rounds it is becoming increasingly apparent in the gap of classes between the two and Palamino would be starting to feel the effect of the powerful punches of Napoles. Going into the start of the late rounds Napoles starts to slow down and Palamino starts to turn it up. This turns out to be his undoing because he ends up hitting Napoles with something that gets his attention and he starts fighting like a puncher. Palamino can't stand up to the power and is eventually TKO'd.<br>  <br>  My pick is Jose Napoles by late round TKO.|`|dh48AkbCaa	mantequilla on points.|`|thcr8Y5vaa	Jose Napoles...|`|kqP7GwOcaa	Got to agree with Mark W, Palomino was good, but not that good.<br>  <br>  Napoles by decision if Palomino could last the distance.
Yg1QR4mmaa	I do not think that Firpo was as good as his record suggests. Yes he was impressive against Jack Dempsey, but all it really showed me is that Dempsey was susceptible to a bigger guy with a good punch and aggression. I think that Bonavena had more substance and the deficiencies in Firpo's game would shown against a guy like Oscar and he would of been stopped in eight rounds.|`|dh48AkbCaa	bonavena by late stoppage.|`|thcr8Y5vaa	Oscar Bonavena...|`|kqP7GwOcaa	I like Firpo in his one, Bonavena was tough, durable and a very solid fighter, but he fury and aggression that Luis Firpo could bring would be a bit too much for Bonavena to contend with.

M8XmhqIhaa	Probably not. Even if it is pre knocked in, we need to assume its not.<br>  <br>  Knock it in for a maximum of 8 hours just to be on the safe side. You don't want a crack the first time you use it.<br>  <br>  Edit: Oh, didn't read the question properly. Get the one that suits you. I would reccomend something like a 6 or Harrow size. It depends on whatever you feel comfortable on.<br>  <br>  Edit: I'm not sure if those bats are knocked in. You should ask the seller if they are or not. Some shops will knock the bats in while others may not. It all depends on the owner.|`|KyU7thGRaa	no|`|oRIWyTZxaa	you can search in yahoo.com
M8XmhqIhaa	When I knocked my bat in, I found the following website really helpful. My bat is still in good shape.<br>  <br>  You must follow the instructions on the following website.<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.middlepeg.com/cricketbatcare.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.middlepeg.com/cricketbatcare....</a>|`|im8xN545aa	You get a professional to do it. Sports shops usually offer the service, depending on where you purchased the bat of course (and some will even do it if you didn't buy the bat from them but you may have to pay).<br>  <br>  If you can't get someone to do it for you then just go to the websites that have already been mentioned and follow one of the guides on there.|`|R0NfdgzLaa	stuff that, don't trust the knocking-in machines.<br>  <br>  get a knocking-in mallet and do it yourself, it's the only way.  even the ones that are pre-knocked-in should be done by hand.<br>  <br>  it'll take ages but you just have to keep hammering away at the bat, make sure you don't neglect the edges, just keep hitting it everywhere.  your neighbours will hate you but who cares, at least your bat won't be breaking into splinters when you edge a fast ball.

But with the expection of Gasol the starters only played a bit over 20 minutes last night. Kobe is still ready to strike. Don't expect them to drag or be tired. They'll be ready to play. I see another blow out... with a final score of 121-108.|`|9UhoUcM2aa	Lakers WIIINNNNN<br>  <br>  109-102|`|56Mb4BXIaa	Lakers 105- 99 Nuggets|`|BntHQeWMaa	Lakers 119 - Nuggets 111
utTFiz3gaa	passionate :)<br>  <br>  i like the WBC because it kind of reminds you how we are all similar. We all love baseball and cheer as hard as we can for our teams. Same with Venezuela fans, the Canada fans etc etc|`|XuGFt3boaa	Well, they absolutely love baseball a lot because some of baseball's superstars like Ichrio Suzuki and Daisuke Matsuzaka began their baseball careers in Japan, and baseball's been in Japan since 1872.|`|TCehI17kaa	I think they are good fans. I also think they & the players play for the love & passion of the game not like most(not all) MLB Players these days who only care about playing for greed & money.|`|Rz9vY53Aaa	they are one word...DEVOTED|`|VSAVy0M7aa	They are the best fans around.  They enjoy the game from the 1st to the 9th inning.  They are insane!|`|tW8fh4IGaa	I think they are Japanese.|`|zsvDuHfEaa	yeah i watched the japan vs korea game and i was amazed<br>  not sure what the doctor mask over the mouth things were for|`|V430UrvFaa	They have a lot of passion for baseball, and they set an example for how a baseball fan should be.|`|yk4S7uuraa	They're extremely devoted fans. I saw them in Williamsport at a Little League series a number of years ago. They cheered for every pitch from the 1st to the 7th inning.
NWP72txEaa	Hmmm, I'm a bit of a traditionalist here, & I agree that proper intruction is needed.<br>  For myself I was not taught any Tai Chi application until after I'd learned the 24, 37, then the 108 form. Remember that the 24 form is primarily taught first to get your body & mind used to the movements. The 37 is considered as the "martial" form, so its not a good idea to start applying self defense until afterwards.<br>  A hate to say this, but from my understanding, Tai Chi isn't really an effective self defense technique until you've had at least 20 years of regular practice; there are just too many nuances involved. Remember; for anything to work as a self defense, it needs to become an automatic reaction under a high stress situation. To be used effectively, the Tai Chi practitioner must remain calm even under this pressure.<br>  If you want some good quick self defense techniques in your system in the meantime, I'd check out some self defense courses.|`|mTxLvmRkaa	this instructor is the most knowledgable in the west and has plenty a **** online. I learnt from him and I do Karate so you should be able to pick up his stuff very easily.<br>  <a href="http://taijiworld.com/" rel="nofollow">http://taijiworld.com/</a>|`|hlqj0pvxaa	The truth is, you can't introduce it to your art because the applications are already there.<br>  <br>  You need someone to teach you how to discover them.<br>  <br>  It will cost you but it will be well worth it. <br>  <br>  Find someone who can, contact them and explain what you want. <br>  <br>  What city are you in? I'd like to help you find someone.|`|Qpx6gCwFaa	He can't. <br>  Proper instruction from a master is required in every stage of Taijiquan instruction.
rjuqrHK7aa	My answer is going to be bias because I am a Kentucky fan. Meeks body is better to handle a full season because he is bigger. He is very accurate from the three point line. He is physical and fast enough to drive to get to the basket. His defense is very underrated. He scores alot of points off his defense. He has the best free throw percentage in the SEC. He has also played against higher competition than Curry has. <br>  Hopefully Meeks is not drafted in 2009. I want him back for his senior year next season.|`|0ytjj1EGaa	I dont watch NCAA or search its news<br>  <br>  but I Know Curry  He is A Great Guy<br>  <br>  Never Heard of Meeks though|`|ZSAVHC84aa	Well, Stephen is so tiny and petite, plus he isn't good at PG so the small size would really hurt at SG. Also, Curry almost needs the role as the main guy on the team to do what he does. To be a role player at the beginning, I gotta go Meeks.|`|xRPjgGs1aa	Curry|`|6yoQhXsOaa	I think I would rather take Meeks over Curry.|`|5FypDafWaa	curry|`|jpVbJEAyaa	Stephen Curry|`|5uRCSk9saa	curry|`|LhhsdxLmaa	curry|`|vJ20fTZWaa	stephen|`|nfNuphJQaa	curry by now, but meeks can be a decent player in the near future.|`|82Vo9DXCaa	Kevin Durant looks as fragile as Curry, but look how good he's doing...I'd go with Meeks though.

9hC7bbf7aa	He is fit as a fiddle to play in Indian Wells and ready to fly out there on next Tuesday. His knees are fine. Yes,people love to talk about Rafa's knees, for a lack of interesting stories....His tendinitis tends to flare up after grinding hard court matches back to back, but he is cautious. Most of pro athletes have this kind of issues.<br>  <br>  What about Federer's back, Murray's virus and his ankle ?? The list is endless...<br>  <br>  Rafa will be playing on ATP tour for many many more years and will stay # 1, who knows how long ? He has a fine group of professionals looking after his health and his game.   Vamos !!|`|18e2151919f80101e6b1310524ec221caa	As of now I think he is healthy. The reason why there are many who think that of what you just mentioned is because his style of tennis is very physical. His body is bound to break sometimes and that is why he has been injured due to his very physical style.|`|aTBs7pJ4aa	well if its any comfort... he won his mat 6 - 1, 6- 0.... so that should tell you something right...<br>  <br>  his tennis is not affected.. but he was complaining of something.. but he is probably just moody....<br>  <br>  i am sure he is in great condition|`|fzlHDkXbaa	I'm curious to know.<br>  I always notice he has bands on his knees, thanks for asking.

A9NBtUy6aa	ok first of all- Great choice of where to go. It can be a little busy, so make sure you find a beginners slope, that hasn't got too many busy runs nearby.<br>  <br>  Secondly- My best advice would be to get real lessons from a ski instructor. There isn't much benefit having private lessons- groups are far more fun, you meet people, and even if you aren't having trouble with one particular aspect, you learn a lot from watching them.<br>  <br>  Anyway, here we go:<br>  <br>  Stopping- make sure you can stop before you start. It's really easy to do but some people seem to have trouble doing it, and once you're going you'll need to remember how. Make a V shape with the tips of your skis together and push down on your inside edges.<br>  <br>  Starting: If you are teaching yourself, don't go and be brave and take on a blue or even a chairlift- just take time on the tiniest little slope (perhaps at the bottom of a run, where everyone else is putting on their skis and getting on a lift) and spend as long as you like standing on your skis, travelling a little, and stopping. <br>  Don't be afraid to sit down/fall over- everyone does it and it doesn't hurt much unless you are at high speeds.<br>  <br>  Reading the map: <br>  Green is easy, often a little path, suitable for beginners. <br>  Blue- a little harder, but you should be doing an easy blue within the first day or two. <br>  Red- Short steep sections or thin slopes- ask someone official looking what the slope is like before you get the lift there, and for your first red, choose one with a blue off the top of the same route, so you can take a look at it and chicken out if you need to. <br>  Black- i wouldn't try this your first time unless you are with an instructor. Often very steep with "moguls" (hills created by the motion of the skis) that make it hard to ski down. These are generally for experts.<br>  You can do any run if you take it slowly enough, and if you learn to side-slip, this can help with the steeper bits. Just take your time, sideslip if you are scared, and take long slow routes across the piste.<br>  <br>  Lifts- the lifts are shown as black straight lines with a symbol halfway up them showing what sort of lift it is. <br>  Drag lifts aren't often steep, and suitable for beginners (mostly) They are a "pan" that goes between your legs and drags you up from behind. Lean on it; don't sit on it- it will chuck you off! Just keep your skis parallel and concentrate on any bumps in the track you might want to avoid. To get off at the top, remove it from between your legs when you see the sign and let go. (It helps if you hold on a few seconds more to give you enough momentum to get out of the way of the next person)<br>  Chair lifts are the most common type, and are easy to use. Just sit on the chair, put the safety bar down, and get off the chair at the top. The hardest bit is skiing away when you get off- use your hands to push yourself away from the chair as it carries on around.<br>  Gondolas are even easier. Take off your skis, walk on, sit down, walk off again at the top. Just do what everybody else does.<br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  The best thing to do is not to worry- it is still a holiday after all, and if you can master the skiing enough, there's some lovely restaurants halfway down mountains. I recommend La Loy in St Martin De Belleville- you will need a full 3valley ski pass, and you can bus there or ski there (it's mostly blues but involves some map reading). It's halfway down the first blue of St Martin (the lift to get to the top is St Martin 1, and the run itself is called "biolley"<br>  Enjoy the apres-ski, especially if they still do the night sledging- it sounds simple but it took me the whole hour and a half to get down the slope, and the mulled wine afterwards was much appreciated!!<br>  <br>  Hope you have a good time! If there's anything else you need, don't hesitate to ask, but I should imagine this is far more than you needed anyway! Enjoy your holiday- I'm incredibly jealous!<br>  <br>  P.S: If you get good, i recommend taking Cime Caron to the top of Cime Caron- absolutely stunning views, but its only reds or blacks from the top.|`|oo1bOj9caa	Try to fall as much as you can, it is the safest way to ski!<br>  Sounds funny but it is what instructors should get across asap. The less tense you are about falling down, the more relaxed you are and you can keep your balance better.<br>  Try to only ski for 1-2 hours in the morning and 1-2 hours in the afternoon. You are not used to skiing so it is extremely tiring because you are tense right from the start. The vast majority of Ski-injuries are from people too tired to get down the last run home and having accidents since they can not control their skis anymore. <br>  Have been skiing for 40 years and a lot of experience, so please try to keep those two things in mind and you will have an enjoyable holiday.<br>  P.S.: Never go off-piste, that is only for pro's and even they get it wrong too many times.|`|cQ7mKIP5aa	Take a lesson and go slowly.  The first time is the hardest, but it gets better after that.  Learn the snow plow and go slowly doing the snow plow moving from side to side down the beginner slopes.  Concentrate on getting your form right.  The snow plow is when the front tips are almost touching like pigeon toes, and the back tips are spread apart.  Plant one pole, snow plow across the slope, swivel you hips, plant the other pole, snow plow across to the other side.  In the beginning, it's a cris crossing action across the mountain instead of down the mountain.<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.imdb.com" rel="nofollow">http://www.imdb.com</a><br>  Enter Marneen Fields<br>  in the Search Box,<br>  and Click GO!|`|WaI693jHaa	1) Get good gloves. Cheap ones leak and it is agony<br>  2) Get boots that fit. It takes a while to find ones that are not going to kill your feet so make sure you try different ones.<br>  3) Plenty of sun blocker, not just sun cream, and good sunnies.<br>  4) Try to get a bit fit before you go (unless you already are). It is exhausting learning to ski and you won't be able to walk after the first day. You'll find muscles you never knew you had.<br>  5) Be patient and you'll love it.|`|NqCLbQB9aa	Make sure you wear comfortable clothing with layers. You can have the best time - only if you're comfortable. Try on all your clothing a few days before you go so that you can make any adjustment or purchase different items<br>  <br>  Bring tissues and make sure you have a quality eyeglass/goggle cleaner. If you can't see, you become frustrated much more quickly.<br>  <br>  As everyone else suggested - take the lesson and be patient.<br>  <br>  Take some pics and have a blast!|`|kklh2A8baa	get a good insurance Ha|`|ZdpaUoteaa	do not give up....its hard when you try it first,,,,concentrate on balance...try and be confident....if you try it the second day you are hooked.....it is well worth the effort.....brill!!!|`|OrG2fBbKaa	Get a good pair of boots that fit tight around your foot and ankle, dress in several thin layers, skiing is exercise and you will generate body heat. Overdressing in too heavy clothes will let you overheat and tire out too quickly.  Take a series of lessons from a qualified professional instructor. Make some new friends and enjoy yourself.  Skiing is a social sport as much as a snow sport.

F32uPjAraa	Fighting with fists comes naturally to people, evidence of fist-fighting contests first appear on ancient Sumerian, Egyptian and Minoan reliefs. The ancient Greeks provide us our first historical records of boxing as a formal sport; they codified a set of rules and staged tournaments with professionals. The birth hour of boxing as a sport may be its acceptance as an Olympic game as early as 688 BC. Modern boxing evolved in Europe, particularly Great Britain.<br>  <br>  In some countries with their own fighting sports, the sport is referred to as "English Boxing" (e.g. in France to contrast with French boxing, or in Burma with Burmese boxing and in Thailand with Thai boxing). There are numerous different styles of boxing practised around the world.<br>  <br>  Records of Classical boxing activity disappeared after the fall of the Roman Empire. However, there are detailed records of various fist-fighting sports that were maintained in different cities and provinces of Italy between the 12th and 17th centuries. There was also a sport in ancient Rus called Fistfight. The sport would later resurface in England during the early 18th century in the form of bare-knuckle boxing sometimes referred to as prizefighting. <br>  <br>  The first documented account of a bare-knuckle fight in England appeared in 1681 in the London Protestant Mercury, and the first English bare-knuckle champion was James Figg in 1719. This is also the time when the word "boxing" first came to be used.|`|tMJhvpeEaa	America made boxing thats way it's so popular over here|`|4a4c6f67f834620fbf409b518828d5d4aa	The original origin dates back to the Romans, they started boxing as a way to entertain the rich people. It started out with two men fighting bare fisted then evolved into fighting with Cestus [sorry about the spelling], the fist were covered with leather and had studs sticking out of them, the site of blood and a man being maimed was very exciting to them.  Legal and fair boxing started somewhere in the 1800's and was then still bare knuckled which eventually became gloved action years later.|`|8dREUd2xaa	It just started one day in 1979 when two guys had road rage.

1a17e73a07a2c5ebb65e5750cb7c97faaa	Hypothetically speaking, yes I think he would but I don't think he will be out of the top 35 by the time they leave Bristol.  It will be very interesting to see if Scott Riggs, AJ, Jeremy Mayfield and a bunch others will be locked in and at whose expense.  I did say way back when that Joe and JD were stupid for treating Aric Almirola the way they did.  He would be doing good in that car right now.<br>  <br>  edit:  You all have been pretty hard on the kid.  Remember what Jeff Gordon did his first year in the cup series and how has he turned out?  Let's see how he's doing in the 2nd half of the season before we write him off.<br>  4's FINE N 09!!!!|`|6qPTQDdZaa	Joey Lagano will be like Michelle Wie in golf.  He won't have to do anything for a few years, the media push will keep him in the spotlight and will keep his ride for a while.  People will eventually get sick of him 3 years down the road when he hasn't done crap and that's when he'll start to look at the possibility of getting fired.|`|NC2BfEvLaa	I think that Joe is going to stick with him for a while. He will give him time to get used to every thing .|`|AA11971891	I think they will keep him for at least a year or two, if he can't improve in that time, then I think they will let him go.|`|muc8sq9naa	I would bet on it.  Gibbs is gonna let "sliced bread" prove himself, it will just take time.  He's not going away any time soon.<br>  <br>  *SHOQ*|`|W2R8TRDmaa	I think they will stick with him regardless. If he is that equipment and can't hang in the top 35, well, that's just sad.|`|yN9gre9Xaa	I'm sure he'll keep his ride. Sponsor on the other hand? If I recall, their contract ends after the season I think.|`|op9iJRvBaa	Darn good question. Hmmmmm.|`|ML4QUEOgaa	I say Joey drops back down to Nationwide series and Allmendinger gets into the 20. Sometime between half-way and 2/3 of the way through the season. HD wants the car running and Logano might be the future of the team, but Allmendinger has proven he's (currently) more capable of driving in the Sprint Cup Series.|`|c16PCaCmaa	I was just thinking about this the other day.  I figured if Joey is out of the top 35 and isn't making races each weekend, I can see Gibbs turning to a veteran to get the car back in the top 35. Then put the kid back in the drivers seat.  We saw this last season on the Red Bull team, when AJ couldn't get the car in the field, they called on Skinner to get the job done, but that didn't mean AJ was out of the ride.<br>  <br>  I guarantee that Home Depot puts way too much money into that car for it to not make the field every weekend.  If he misses a few races, I bet the sponsor will have more of a say in the matter than JD Gibbs.|`|YHYT8qMKaa	I'm sure Gibbs will keep him in the car for a while. Joey has a lot of hype to become a great driver in the future, so I don't think Gibbs would want to get rid of him. But  if Joey indeed drops out of the top 35, I think he should go to the Nationwide series full-time and Gibbs should hire a veteran like Mike Wallace to drive the #20 car.|`|0MuRCU5paa	He is the future at Joe Gibbs Racing and unless he seriously sucks in the next two years after this one, his ride and sponsor are safe.|`|MXbn8DWeaa	Yea, he will just become a go or go homer then.<br>  <br>  Simple as that until he stays in the top 35, he will continue to drive as hard as he can.|`|AbDAdrXkaa	Yes, he will this year hes just learning in the car JGR is going to keep him for a long time to come because hes only 18 and has lots of talent :D|`|MYC6Xv1Xaa	I have been wondering the same thing.|`|xnCizA7Daa	depends on if he wrecks at las vegas|`|Qz80EA45aa	He is safe for this year and at least part of next, no matter what he does in that car. But if he continues on this pace, and hasn't shown any tangible improvement by the summer races in 2010, he might be in trouble.|`|U3ZBUOWaaa	There was so much hype surrounding this guy Giobb will have to keep him regardless.  I don't think he will drop out of top 35 though. he will be pretty decent as a rookie. It just takes time.|`|iO12Vjnvaa	Abso Prez. They will give him at least a full season before cutting him.<br>  But I think we'll see him get his act together. Although he has rubbed me the wrong way...the kid is talented and can probably get the job done. Never count out Zippy. I could probably win in the #20 with Zippy's help! So it'll take time....Joe's pretty patient....not like Childress or Hendrick.<br>  <br>  Just an opinion as always.|`|63e6fbd5b85357a27d660c7d5c0b9ee9aa	yes he will hang there for a while but as the season goes on he should be in the top 35|`|n55igpCUaa	Yes. Joe has already spent so much money on this guy. Plus, NASCAR won't allow it.|`|5d77c66b171b12a5932576b2dc7b7dd3aa	Yep, Gibbs is locked in on this kid.........
fEgK96Rhaa	lots of running, you need endurance. sit ups to tighten ur gut, you're gonna get hit. push ups to strengthen ur upper torso, you gotta fend off tacklers. and lastly, you gotta be quick. run at something, then quickly change directions, don't slow down.|`|82Vo9DXCaa	Pull a sled where you can add and subtract weights on.

FhHIAbmLaa	Let me share a story.<br>  <br>  My hunting partner cleans his 700 308 bolt(inside), by spraying break free in it. Last year we hunted in 20 degree weather, and he took a shot at an 8 point, 4 times. NOT ONE SHOT WENT OFF.Break free does freeze. <br>  <br>  Pull apart the bolt. It is not hard. Follow the company specs.<br>  <br>  Blast all the crud out with Gun Scrubber, which costs about 10 bucks a can. Or use brake cleaner which is about 4 bucks for a much bigger can. They are the same thing.<br>  <br>  Use Mili-Tech sparingly on the spring, and inside the bolt, then reassemble.<br>  <br>  Now here come the crazy part. Pre heat your oven to 250 degrees, or a "keep warm" setting. Put the bolt in the oven for about 20 to 30 min, then remove and let cool slowly at room temp.<br>  <br>  Mili Tech is a military grade lube that penetrates metal and bonds at the molecular level. It will penetrate with heat; I use it to condition, and break in my rifle barrels. <br>  <br>  You will go years with no trouble. I would clean the bolt every couple of years max, unless you get caught in a horrible rain storm, or drop the whole gun in water.<br>  <br>  This is how I care for my bolt guns. I own a custom precision 308, built on a 700 platform, a Kimber 30-06, and a Winchester Model 70 in .270.  <br>  <br>  Any lube should be dry lube like lock graphite to insure the spring does not freeze up. It can get so gummy that the pin won't dent the primer enough.<br>  <br>  Good Luck|`|gVZ6k6L6aa	Yes, I agree. I always remove the bolt and use a small 'toothbrush' to scrub out the grooves, nooks and crannies, then give it a nice light coating of oil before replacing it. As far as pistols go, anywhere I can't get with my fingers I use a variety of small brushes. You can pick them up at hobby shops, industrial supply houses, or by mail order. There's no such thing as "too clean".|`|gAzVnt1Qaa	Myself, I would take the bolt out every time . Just to be sure .|`|XNpnK4vpaa	It depends upon the bolt.  Some are easier to take apart and clean.  Others require a gunsmith and special tools for complete dissasembly, cleaning and reassembly.<br>  <br>  If you plan to hunt in extreme cold weather, then a complete cleaning and re-lubrication with a cold weather lubricant makes sense.<br>  <br>  If you shoot corrosive ammunition, a complete cleaning & flushing-out of the corrosive salts makes sense.<br>  <br>  If you only shoot a handful of non-corrosive cartridges, then cleaning the exterior of the bolt and re-applying a light coat of lubricant is often sufficient.<br>  <br>  Is the rifle new or used?  Is it really dirty?<br>  A used rifle and/or a dirty rifle merits a complete cleaning, inspection and re-lubrication session.|`|K5AeQuSNaa	Unless I am using corrosive ammunition, I don't really worry about it.  And if you are spraying break free into it, don't forget to also spray something else in there to protect the metal when you are done.  Rem Oil, or something else that will act as a preservative.

CttL3LmBaa	Do not use chemical paint strippers on your bike.  It is simply a mess.  You wind up with 2 times the volume of stripper in hazardous waste.  You legally can't dispose of the waste (stripper + paint) in a landfill, and chances are your trash winds up in the landfill somewhere.<br>  <br>  Tear down your bike to just the frame and fork.  Mask off all bearing surfaces you can not remove with duct tape.  Wad newspaper and stuff it inside the seat tube leaving a tapered cone of newspaper sticking out so you can remove it later.  Do the same with the crank hanger and the head tube.  This will prevent 90% of the blasting media from entering your frame.<br>  <br>  Take the frame to a professional media blaster.  Chances are they will not use sand (if they do it will be highly specialized "soft sand") or beads.  They use mostly other media like sodium or crushed walnut shells.  Expect this to cost between $50 and $100 depending on where you live.<br>  <br>  When you get the bike back use compressed air to clean out the inside of the frame as part of the prep for painting.|`|JSGLKnA4aa	sandblasting.|`|AA10837912	A product called Nitromore paint stripper.<br>  If you live near a Wickes DIY store, use their brand, its cheaper, and just as effective|`|fdf78d43fe1121f9be25f88e4fef9e3baa	If aluminum, walnut shell blasting.

It is less damaging than sand blasting and more effective than stripping.  See if you can find a local body shop to do it.  Completely disassemble your bike and fill the holes where the headset and bottom bracket go with rags so nothing get in them and the threads don't get messed up.  Then have it blasted.

It may be odd like wushu and BJJ... or similar of what UFC fighters train in--BJJ and Muay Thai. All of which are effective depending on the individual's adaptability. The idea of being realistic does not refer to person A as much as it does to person B. <br>  <br>  I can give you a couple of examples that has worked for one fighter I have met. The strangest thing is that it wasn't all martial arts. He took karate as a child to gain discipline, street gung fu nearing his teens, lyrical dancing (which made him one hell of a flexible guy), hip-hop, and then break-dancing. When you think about it, the dance made him more aware of the rhythm people give off during a fight. The foundation he built up molded him to be quick as possible. His role model was humility-the idea of being humble so that confrontations aren't pushed upon him. He's not exactly a fighter since he doesn't like to fight at all, but when worse comes to worse and he has to use it in a situation, I can actually see all of those combination form into one solid movement. <br>  <br>  So in general, martial arts is not the only thing that helps the person, and that's what I learn from experience. You take art and passionately love art, so you get a paint-brush and apply that in your mentality, you may be patient and fluid in your strikes--who knows? <br>  <br>  The art or the style doesn't exist until you move. Until you do a muay thai roundhouse or a taekwondo side kick or a jujitsu submisssion--the art doesn't exist. Move! When the individual realizes it, that combination of mentality, spirit, and experience molds into something completely different.|`|9b5QUw2eaa	Sambo, Judo, and MMA

All that thing will do is ruin your accuracy, not to mention it's a pain to clean, and may break more balls.  Sounds like you're set up perfect to me, or maybe you need an e grip.
Mgb3ISrMaa	Im really sad. Losing one Bull was hard and losing another was even harder. I have been a bulls fan for a long time. Born and 1993 and began to become a fan ever since that day. I met Red Kerr at the United Center after the game and a really nice guy. I love Norm and red kerr on how they analyze the game and they made it so much understandable then any other commentators. I thought my friend was lieing when he told me Red Kerr died this morning and that even made me more sad. <br>  <br>  May they R.I.P.|`|WT8CbURxaa	In a way, I kind of hope they don't retire his number.

0tpLq6meaa	In a very long career of bow hunting and gun hunting for deer, 90% of the deer I have killed and seen in the woods have been after 8 o'clock. But I will say deer movement in different areas of the state I live in vary greatly. But it also depends on the method you use to hunt. When hunting a food source in early bow season, most deer seen and killed come into the feeding area about the last 15 minutes before dark, with most movement occurring right at last light. Toward the end of October, they will stop and feed under the acorn trees before bedding up for the day, and this will occur around 8 though 10 A.M. for the most part. I hunt in Louisiana. The movement of deer may be entirely different in your state. But the deer movement you see on these T.V. shows are coming from deer that do not live on public hunting areas, and are not pressured. For the most part, you could call them almost tame.I recall seeing one bow hunting show where there was several does feeding under a tree the bow hunter was in. An 8 point buck walked in bow range and the hunter made a killing shot on him. But the does feeding under his tree merely looked at the buck running off and continued feeding.Does your deer act like that?|`|1jmXT4Vvaa	Like the other poster said, most of these videoed hunts occur on either high fenced property or on super exclusive private property.  Deer in these kind of environments do not act like normal deer.  I have seen, and even shot deer at those rare times of the day when they aren't supposed to be there.  I guess someone forgot to send them the memo saying when to show up.  You can never fully predict the movements of a wild animal, that's what makes hunting so fun.  You match your wits against theirs.  They will surprise you a lot of the time.  The thing that kills me is how dishonest some of these video producers are with their videos.  For example, Primos videoed an elk hunt just minutes away from my house.  In the video they are talking about how great the hunting was, and "anyone can come up here and enjoy a hunt like this."  They even brag about the hunt being on public land.  All of us locals laugh it off, but they were hunting on the CA ranch just outside of Townsend MT.  They even list them as the outfitter.  They were not hunting public land, and the access to hunt the CA starts at $10,000.  No wonder they all harvested monster bull elk.  My 12 year old nephew could get one off of there.  I really wish that the makers of these videos would be more honest about their endeavors, but I guess that wouldn't sell their products.|`|f3f63c87e27f64c3e9f1679c165409b8aa	Couple of things you have to remember.  <br>  1)  They are probably hunting a high fenced ranch.<br>  2)  If it's not high fenced it's large enough that they can properly manage it without it being high fenced.<br>  3)  Being properly managed will entail having a proper ratio of buck/does (1:1)<br>  4) Having a good ratio (1:1) will force the bucks to really move around looking for does in heat/estrus.<br>  5)  Bucks in a properly managed area will keep the does stirred up and moving around which will in return keep the bucks on the move hunting the does thus allowing hunters to see more deer all throughout the day. <br>  6) When there is a larger number of does than bucks the bucks will be content to bed down with the does and not look for more out of fear of loosing what they already have.|`|UrNVuFx6aa	I hunt mostly on public-access land and every location I have hunted there has been deer activity between 10:00 and 3:00. In most areas, unless there is an extreme amount of hunting pressure, deer will get up and feed during the day. Just as you and I eat lunch around mid day so do a lot of the creatures in the woods. If you aren't staying in your stand during these times of the day you are severely limiting your potential for success.<br>  <br>  Shoot straight and stay safe.|`|DV4xyeChaa	i shot 2 deer in last few years...one 11 am the other 3pm... 11 am one i was walking to camp for lunch and heard a shot 1/2 away...heard him coming so i sat on a stump...he stopped and looked back 20 feet away...4 points 130 pounds.....and cameras use giant light catching lenses   even in light that you cant see and would not shoot in it can look light... [i saw a golf match [tiger] where it was too dark to see but on TV it looked like dusk|`|V3deprUCaa	1 thing you gotta remember, is that they are on high fenced propertys. That probably has a lot to do with it.<br>  <br>  However, I have killed deer at 2:00 in the afternoon before, I killed one at 3:14 this year, nice buck too. The woods is where they live. Remember that.|`|WaVHnPOyaa	Don't ever go by anything on  those hunting shows. Those guys are hunting on pay to "hunt" ranches that are flooded with deer. In most areas they move in the am and start to move again a little before dark. In those ranches the damn things run in packs. No real hunt involved.<br>  <br>  Start your hunt a half hour before daylight and make sure your stand is in a well used (by deer) area. If you see fresh tracks there on a daily basis, set up shop and you'll be almost guaranteed dinner.

Starting to run,  you need to understand what your body can handle, and what pace you can handle for a miles length.

Ucbnl7VJaa	Buy a good .22 Long Rifle bolt action to learn and hone your skills on. CZ, Browning, Marlin, Savage and Remington(model 504,541,581) all make great rifles. Cost can be from under $200 to 700+ for these. There are even more expensive ones out there like Anschutz, Cooper Arms and Dakota. All very nice but also expensive for a starter.<br>  <br>  Great to start with open sights but if you decide to get a scope start with one of the better rimfire types such as Weaver or Nikon's ProStaff.  Or you can upgrade all the way to something like the Leupold rimfire 3-9x33mmAO.|`|a7758985bc328f86aea63a86e0cd5cfdaa	Might sound a little odd & if you can get your head around lever actiion but  the Marlin M39  is as accurate as many "target" rifles.<br>  A good 4X scope does not limit you when it comes to hunting & is great for targets at the usual range for.22s.<br>  Have heavy  bolt action target & sporter .22s but the Marlin is the most fun to shoot.<br>  You can spend  a lot more more & get a lot less.<br>  There are some nice mid weight bolt action .22s  around as mentioned but you have to settle on scope or iron sights.<br>  Micrometer sights are better for targets but are limiting if you intend to hunt.<br>  Best regards|`|AA11289359	796, RIFLE, Remington Targetmaster, .22 cal., Mod 510-P. Receiver peep-sight, ramp front. 95% finish. FFL. Estimate........................... $75-$125 <br>  <br>  I have one of these with the peep sight and boy will it shot.|`|FQbzsAHBaa	I would go with a Winchester 30-30. I have one my self and it works great. It is an all around gun, and it is also very accurate. It is a great short rang bush gun for hunting only good for up to 150 yards, but don't get me wrong it will still stop a 200 pound hog at 150 yards.|`|It2jlZXmaa	G'day mate go for a cz in a .22magnum or a .22 lr,magnum has more power i have one of those in a .22mag and it is fantastic rifle and very accurate gun.The 4 52 lux is the gun i have.cheers mate<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.cz-usa.com/product_detail.php?id=3" rel="nofollow">http://www.cz-usa.com/product_detail.php...</a>|`|35aUnX8Xaa	Anschutz rifles have won more medals than you can shake a sh*tty stick at.<br>  <br>  Ruger - pmsl.|`|2GiL7QNJaa	the best .22 for the money is the Ruger 10-22 .it is durable accurate & there are many add ons to buy they go for about 120 dollars|`|dpSr0icwaa	Ruger 10/22, it is the standard by which all the others are judged.|`|PnS3wHQiaa	Everyone is gonna tell you the same thing : Ruger 10/22|`|5mxy4WaMaa	Marlin Model 60.|`|AA11620807	i'd go for a ruger, remington, or winchester. in that order of preference. if  you can find aand afford it get one with a heavy varmint barrel. if not, you can buy and have a varmint barrel  installed by a gunsmith later.    <br>  <br>      varmin barrel is a  very thick very heavy barrel, and very very .effective at improving accuracy|`|Y4RS35M7aa	In Pennsylvania, and other locals, semi-auto rifles are banned for hunting, so I'd get a bolt-action from Mossberg or Marlin.  They make guns that last lifetimes, and don't cost an arm and a leg...well, maybe a hand, or an ankle!  <br>  <br>  Several companies also make lever guns and pump guns in .22.  Those can be fun, too.|`|DV4xyeChaa	Marlin sells more 22s than anyone...that said ruger 10/22 is the best fun for dollar deal out there...some say get a bolt action for safety...i say bs...if you gona screw around and point a gun at people and things you shouldn't it doesn't matter which gun you have.|`|5VELZt7Saa	i`ve had a Ruger 10/22 for over 20 years now,shoots just like the day i bought it.
vK7pKFvvaa	Lot's of practice and knowing your equipment will shrink your groups . Shoot the rifle off a bench to see what the rifle/ammo is capable of .  Find a affordable ammo that is giving you the smallest group for the money at 50 meters . Then find an experienced shooter or search on line for articles on how to build a good shooting position . Try to keep your head at the same place on the stock each time , squeeze ( don't jerk ) the trigger each shot and follow through . Do this thousands of time and you will be amazed !!!!!

7ImGw976aa	Would love to see them back together because they were one of my favourite tag teams ever.<br>  Possibly not, Christian is still quite up to standard for wrestling but Edge doesn't fight like how he used to be. Christian's kind of gone up throughout the years but Edge has kind of slipped in that sense.<br>  Depends what they'd do with the characters, whether they have them quite close to what they were. Christian's character has grown up more, no more tantrums, but still got that attitude. Edge's character has gotten more heel and selfish since but still got some of the essence left, possibly if he got a bit more jokey and playing pranks and things with Christian again might make it back. They were both quite heel as a tag team so possibly could go back..........<br>  Depends how they are used I'd say.|`|dbc3503ab379d3f8b3803c2488ab5e36aa	I doubt that was so long ago, and Edge doesn't really wrestle his matches anymore so it wouldn't work|`|TzCu3igraa	yes, definately|`|V4LECaohaa	of course they will have even more charisma|`|52JcqKJmaa	Sort of. It would be a lot like the DX reunion that happened recently. It would start off great but would sour after a month or two.

tjJOSW16aa	Well if the season ended today, they would be the 7 seed going up against San Antonio, a team they really match up well against and providing they could win game 1 or 2 in San Antonio they could upset the Spurs in the first round.  With only a 2 1/2 game difference between the 4 and 7 seeds the last part of the schedule is really going matter this year in the NBA, Portland has a chance to build up some good momentum going into the playoffs with their last 10 games, it's an even split of home and away games and only 2 back to back sets, they do have to play 5 playoff bound teams right now, but they get 4 games against Memphis and Oklahoma City so they should roll into the playoffs with at least a 6-4 record from their last 10.  Looking at the remaining schedule of other teams, I think Portland will finish with the 6 seed in the West and draw , either San Antonio, Houston, Denver or New Orleans, I think they match up well and can beat either San Antonio or Houston, I'm not sure they can beat Denver, and New Orleans as really clicked since the All-Star break|`|jjkikyZFaa	they are a good team.  they just need to get a good center, point guard, shooting guard, small forward, and a power forward.  Then they will be competitive|`|OKyVQoruaa	They have a slim chance.|`|aaKYVMk2aa	"is the Hornets and possibly the rockets.".<br>  <br>  Dream.|`|CEKZsoFRaa	No, sorry, good luck in the draft!|`|GfOR2H0kaa	I only see them finishing 7th or 8th meaning they will play probably lakers or spurs and they dont have the experience to win in a 7 game series against these two teams|`|4DcvpQXfaa	True that<br>  <br>  They will win at least 3 games in 1st round,I hope they can win 1st round<br>  <br>  EDIT: I agree,LaMarcus is underrated|`|0ytjj1EGaa	I am sure that they will reach play offs<br>  <br>  but not Sure if they can pass 1st round|`|5FypDafWaa	their chances are good depending on who they play.

5rP0zBudaa	European sports leagues should avoid the American style. I have only watched sport on American TV twice. But it seems that you get advertisements and a break for a rest every 10 minutes. I would struggle to describe anything i saw as sport. Its more of a series of advertisements with clips of somebody kicking a ball shown occasionally.  <br>  <br>  Compare that to watching sport in Europe in a 90 minute match you get one 15 minute break in the middle, most if not all of which is spent by people talking about the match.

3eDsHCTVaa	airalert.com has a free 1-800 number u can call for more details.<br>  im 5'11-6'0, 165lbs<br>  i am on week 3 of air alert 4. i have gained 3 inches after 2 weeks. i also do weight training. i recommend u buy it from the website because u get everything and the DVD. i dont work for them but i like their package and it works for me. after 2 weeks of air alert and weights i can now do single leg squats. dont listen to negative people or doubts. just do it, like nike. trust your self and be focused, cancel out all doubt.<br>  the only reason people say it hurts your knees is 2 things. <br>  1. they arent doing it right<br>  2. they quit before the knee area muscles can adapt to the shock. in other words, if i want muscle growth in my arm bicep i need to lift weights and eat protein. while lifting weights, my muscles in the bicep will tear and grow bigger and stronger after because they have been shocked and dont want to go thru that again, so they adapt. the same thing for the legs. jumping is a movement that the legs have to learn, so air alert teaches them and i guess shocks the muscles and tendons into adapting to be stronger and make u jump higher. peole quit because they get scared or they cant bear the soreness. but, if u follow the instructions like stretching before workouts and also resting 3-4 minutes between sets u will be fine.<br>  REASONABLE PEOPLE SELDOM GET AHEAD IN LIFE, U HAVE TO BE UNREASONABLE TO GET WHAT U WANT.

If you really want to improve your Vertical jump, first you need to figure out what type of Jumper you are, a power jumper or a leaper, as using optimal biomechanics is just as important as having explosive muscle power. Next you need to figure out what type of power or strength you are lacking. The three basic types of strength are: Base strength, transitional power, and explosiveness or "Reactive" power, they are all different and must be trained in different ways. Now I know a lot of you are wondering what's the difference between the three. Well in short Base Strength is how much weight you can move, Transitional Power is how fast you can move said weight and explosiveness is the maximum speed and distance you can move said weight with each single movement. A good Vertical Jump training routine will include the following exercises:<br>  <br>  Base Strength <br>  1: Traditional Squats and Pistol Squats <br>  2: Deadlifts/base building olympic lifts <br>  3: Lunges <br>  4: Core Work (Functional Performance Core Strength= The ability to make your pelvis and spine "lock" and work as a single stable unit, not simply having a 6 pack or being able to do 100 crunches) <br>  5: Stretching<br>  <br>  Transitional Power: <br>  1: Box Squats/Tempo Squats <br>  2: Power Cleans <br>  3: Push Press <br>  4: Core Work <br>  5: Stretching<br>  <br>  Explosiveness: <br>  1: Ballistic and jump squats <br>  2: Traditional and Compound/Hybrid Plyometrics <br>  3: Sprinting <br>  4: Core Work <br>  5: Stretching<br>  <br>  You'll also want to figure out which individual muscles/muscle groups are working inefficiently. You can figure this out by completing a full vertical jump test progression and a baseline fitness test to diagnose any muscle imbalances that you may have. Remember no matter what type of training program you do you must make sure that opposing muscles are strengthened and balanced (e.g. Quads and hamstrings, abs and lower back) so don't skip the quad extensions and hamstring curls. If opposing muscles are not strengthened they will lead to weak links, energy leaks and imbalances will result in poor or slow improvement and raise the risk of injury significantly. Do a routine that combines plyomertic/bodyweight, free weight and or acceleration routines. Make sure you are consuming lots of protein to aid in muscle repair after tough workouts You'll also want to replenish your bodies ATP and glycogen stores as they are the fuel for those type IIa and type IIb muscle fibers you will be (AKA FG and FOG) shredding during your workout. In order to gain inches you'll need to tax your central nervous system and force your body to create new motor pathways. If you train correctly you should gain at least an inch a week. <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7PxcPllTyRA" rel="nofollow">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7PxcPllTy...</a><br>  <br>  Jump 20 inches higher in 10 weeks:<br>  <a href="http://www.program51.com" rel="nofollow">http://www.program51.com</a>|`|mhYf1pgsaa	<a href="http://youranswers.andrewbolam.co.uk" rel="nofollow">http://youranswers.andrewbolam.co.uk</a><br>  A very informative website, kindly stay a minute in website and enter you email address for getting your answer.|`|nfNuphJQaa	good for you

Z8UV6S3baa	So, the answer is a blend. Every company that makes a combat style firearm is focusing manufacturing on those and moving to "build to order" type production for everything else. Ruger is churning out SR9's at a ferocious rate to be in the mix of high capacity carry 9's which is part of the rage right now. It is probably pulling some resources away from .22 pistols right now.<br>  <br>  Savvy shooters, that have most of the gear that they want in centerfire are realizing that .22 are great practice platforms and are picking them up to fill out collections and use them as tools for teaching the family. This is particularly the case with rifleman that historically were not that concerned about pistol shooting but are thinking about it more with the political environment.<br>  <br>  Cost of ammo. In the last year, 9mm has just about doubled in retail price, and increased about 50 - 60% in bulk. About every other kind of ammo has ... except .22. You can still get a Walmart Federal 525 round bulk pack for about 15$ in .22LR. Even for reloaders, getting trigger time is getting spendy, and .22 is a great alternative to that. Many of the aformentioned rifle shooters had a lack of good quality .22 pistols in their collection for doing this kind of stuff, even if they have plenty of good quality .22 rifles.<br>  <br>  Finally, people really are buying guns at an almost absurd rate. The rising tide floats all boats as they say about markets. Many people picking up a Springfield XDM 9 are realizing that the Ruger 22/45 has the same grip angle. Or people picking up their SIG226 are seeing that a SIG Mosquito is a perfect trainer for it. Particularly with the assortment of really good quality mid priced tactical pistols - the XD, the Glock, the S&W M&P, the FNP, Taurus range models, the Ruger SR9, the CZ75 models, and then if we include the used market, the Beretta 92, are just examples of well proven, good quality pistols that can be had for $600 or less. For people pulling together a $1000 budget for their pistol gear, one of those and a nice .22 are a great combo and many people are buying them.<br>  <br>  Still, there is stock out there, you just have to look for it. Most manufacturers are on allocation, so the dealers that had their orders in first are getting their guns first. It may be the the gun shops in your area just didn't get their orders in early. I've talked to owners of shops around here (Western Washingon) that realized what would happen (based on living through the build up for the first Brady Bill) and started putting in blanket orders as early as July/August of last year. If your shop was late in that pipeline they could be slow to get new stock.<br>  <br>  Thinkingblade|`|8MUj24s6aa	Go to:<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.budsgunshop.com/catalog/index.php" rel="nofollow">http://www.budsgunshop.com/catalog/index...</a><br>  <br>  <a href="http://gunbroker.com/Auction/Browse.asp?Cat=3026" rel="nofollow">http://gunbroker.com/Auction/Browse.asp?...</a><br>  <br>  I got my Buck Mark and Mosquito from gunbroker.|`|oYf3jSq6aa	I have found no problem finding 22 pistols but gun sales are up in every aspect<br>  <br>  Guns are enjoying the same artificial inflation that houses saw four years ago and the same crash is coming as soon as people realize that Obie is only going to reinstate the old AWB and  most of the guns being bought at over inflated prices today will deflate hard, just like houses did|`|0R46pYb3aa	Sounds like BS to me.  I was in Gander Mountain today in New York and was looking at three different Ruger .22's, two different Walthers, a Beretta Neos, A Browning Buckmark and a Smith & Wesson.|`|AA11570394	People have been buying up lots of semi-auto rifles and pistols in fear of them being banned.<br>  Manufactures just could not keep up with the demand. You can still get them but as you know it’s getting difficult to say the least.|`|QNX9NET3aa	Gun sales are up a lot since the election. It isn't just .22 pistols but just about every category. It may take some time for manufacturers to replenish the supplies.|`|KDOIKIq2aa	Two fold.  First is the Obama Buying Craze.  Many believe if you ever want it buy it now or you'll never be a ble to get it.<br>  <br>  Second and most likely more truth.  Back when metal cost were up and ammunition cost were climbing many looked to a .22LR pistol to augment there centerfire pistol shooting.  After all I can buy 550 rounds of .22LR for what I can buy 50 rounds of .45 ACP.  This took up a lot of stock before the post election buying craze.|`|DV4xyeChaa	my 2 local gun shops have rugers up the ying yang....look on gunsamerica.com...they can ship one to your local gunshop for 25/35 dollars|`|qxBxy7e1aa	u can get them at Cabelas or Gander Mountain

They are out there performing, putting on a show.  <br>  The last few seconds (or sometimes minutes) are scripted.  Prior to the match, they tell them how long they have to be in the ring.  They can improvise the match up until it's time to perform the scripted part.<br>  For example.  They tell them the match will last 8 minutes, and the last 2 minutes will go a certain way.  The first 6 minutes, they do whatever they want to.  The 2 wrestlers will get together ahead of time and discuss some things they want to do together in the ring.

yHvh7tFlaa	atdhe.com, among many others, were sent "Cease and Desist" letters from the NHL. The NHL is alienating tens of thousands of hockey fans by cracking down on websites that were illegally broadcasting their games for free.<br>  <br>  If you find a site, keep it to yourself, as  Bettman probably has someone lurking around here trying to get info on any other sites they may have missed.<br>  <br>  Sometimes Yahoo Sports shows a game, it is extremely limited to one or two games, and only what the NHL allows them to show.<br>  <br>  **Leafsfan. Not quite the same as Napster, as there is no file sharing or permanent downloading, but I do see your point.  You are just clicking on a link in this case.  I still feel with the economy the way it is, this could cost the NHL in the long run.<br>  <br>  **Didn't realize people above me were so desperate for the 10 points.

Now I can't follow the Capitals as well!  They are my favorite team, and I live in the D.C. suburbs.  This means even if I pay for gamecenter live, the games are blacked out because they are broadcast in my area.  The problem:  They are not actually broadcast!  They are transmitted through cable and satellite services.  So unless I am in the arena, the only legal way to see games is to go somewhere that gets the game or watch the games that happen to be on NBC (I think it is a grand total of 2 this year).  The NHL isn't losing money by me watching for free!  Buying cable or satellite service isn't going to give them money, and I don't have a tv ratings meter, so the ratings aren't affected.  If they are going to crack down on free streams, they should allow all games, including local games, to be available on gamecenter live.  {sarcasm starts}They should also start cracking down on people watching games in restaurants and other people's houses. {sarcasm ends}  I'm so angry.

Then, if last time winner is coming back @ the same distance( very herd to repeat). Then, you want to look @ speed, follow by jockey and morning line odds. Finally, watch the tote board and see what the public is betting vs the crooks. Example, a 5/2 morning line is bet down to 4/5 or 3/5 this is what the public is betting( no decent payout, just having fun), and a 12 -1 morning line gets bet down to 5-1 or 6-1( pays really good),this is what the crooks( owners and trainers) are betting, in some cases jockey's too, when they hop off a horse so they can pay their mortgage, car note etc.. Hope this helps..<br>  <br>  P.S= Don't listen to Les Onaka, he just wants you to buy his $4 form and guesses likes the rest of them.|`|BovpXrk1aa	be more specific<br>  not sure what you are interested in doing|`|20618e07b9952cd27d180dc5a08a5803aa	One profitable way of betting is to start by claiming the free bet offers from bookmakers, e.g. Boylesports are currently offering ￡200 in free bets, it's a good starting point to go through all bookies with free bets.<br>  <br>  You can find a full list of free bets at <a href="http://www.freebetguide.com" rel="nofollow">http://www.freebetguide.com</a>

l7iZhjoSaa	Running on pavement will kill your cleats, and the shock absorption isn't that much, because grass usually absorbs most of the shock, so not only will you find yourself with some knee and shin problems, but you will also ruin your brand new cleats. I would definitely invest in a good pair of running shoes, try to go to a running store, because they look at your feet and fit you with the shoe that goes with your feet the best. Also don't wear those everyday if you want them to last.|`|YbOGOnroaa	Well... You could use it to jog on grass. You could just bring your ball around and have a kickabout with yourself. I'm sure there's a place where people play soccer! Try looking for an indoor sports centre or something.

dmX3zwbHaa	The perfect punch starts from your feet(twist feet) then twist hip then extente schoulder and arm .

But work on your technic 1st because that is the most important and your to young to lift heavy weights, your body is still growing.|`|yPkZX6x7aa	When you punch, you're extending your arm, so that's triceps|`|UDak8Zm1aa	Its all in the hips, its all in the hips you wanna rotate and punch through your opponents chin or jaw or temple or how ever you spell it, you can also get a knock out from hitting them in the liver.|`|E563RzW2aa	You need a strong overall body for some heavy punches, NOT just the arm.  Most of the force actually comes from your legs.  You need strong legs and butt (esp. for the hooks and uppercuts) as well as a strong core.  While good arms help too, most of the power comes from the legs.  That's something most people don't understand.  You're throwing your entire body into the punch.  Winding up for a punch with just your arm isn't as good as a quick, stiff jab-cross, using your entire body.|`|CdAE4nXcaa	building a strong core will give you a harder punch and overall strength, abs, shoulders, chest, legs. the power in your punches comes through proper hip movement, if you punch with just your arms you have no power in your punch. you have to put your hip into it. as for grappling you need a strong core as well.|`|QxtdyNvgaa	i use my fist?|`|7Vnd0Pibaa	it is not just about muscle it is also how you use it if you just move your arm then there is no power to the punch and no amount of muscle will do however if you follow through with your body ie move with the punch then you increase the power of the punch and even a weakling can hurt someone|`|nfJeZ27Haa	ok well first learn some boxing technique and prefect it and remember punching starts from the ground up so ur lower body and core are more important then ur arms...<br>  <br>  heres somthing i posted before<br>  <br>  "if ur looking for power then lift heavy in all the power lifts (dead lifting, squating/legpress and benching) a few times a week and concentrate on lifting heavier weight for overall strength 6 reps or less and it WILL NOT mess up ur speed but make sure u stretch and everyday run/sprint and work on basic bodyweight exercises (pushups, pullups, dips and cruches/situps) and make sure u do clap pushups for explosiveness and plus knuckle pushups on hard surfaces to harden and toughen up ur knuckles and Shadow box as fast as u can without sacrificing technique but make sure u dont be lazy on your legs they should always be stronger then ur upper body and u will have better balance with strong legs. if u do all these things and get good and strong with them u should be stronger faster and more powerful."<br>  <br>  EDIT: and like the guy above me said the hips generate alot of power and deadlifting is great for hip n core strength|`|e9Mb1hyjaa	m8 u need to work on ur biceps and ur triceps obviously<br>  <br>  but then u need to work on ur shoulders to deliver the punch.<br>  <br>  So do deltoid workouts<br>  <br>  look on internet m8|`|AA10698309	Do you want an "effective" punch?

GKWs518Iaa	Ha! Sore bum! Got that right.  Wherever you're going should have everything you need, including a safety riding helmet, and will tell you everything you need to know.  My only advice is make sure you wear some kind of boots that go high up the ankle, otherwise they are gonna be pretty bruised from the stirrups, and make sure the shoes have at least a one inch heal, to keep your feet from sliding out of the stirrups.  I just use those boots that construction workers and hikers wear and they work fine for me.  Oh, and make sure you wear long pants.|`|i5CwVa5baa	Well it depends.

Cl6KbcAGaa	This is a terrible fix! I would run very far away from this bike frame and take any other offer! I am certain others will agree...|`|l5cxmTb9aa	Many people have already said that's not a great welding job but looking at what there was to work with and not knowing what type of welder was used I can't say I would have expected much more.  I've seen much better welds from an experienced welder. Chances are that this repair would not hold up and the heat from the welding may have put the frame out of alignment. You can also see where the frame is rusting above the bottom bracket lug. If you want to use the bike you could file the welds down a bit, wire brush the rust off, prime and paint the area and put it all back together. It might last a year or it might last one ride.<br>  If they've offered to credit you the entire purchase price  back as credit on another bike I'd say that's a pretty generous offer. So you basically rode this bike around for free for a year.<br>  I assume the new bike has a warranty too.|`|xxq5JAM6aa	The fellow knows that "fix" is a total mess. Have to give him credit for trying, and more for offering you the credit after a year. Take it.|`|fdf78d43fe1121f9be25f88e4fef9e3baa	He actually sold you a bike that was rusted away like that?! He is not someone I would do business with at all. The UK is a horrible place for bicycles because of the weather and a shop that would sell something like that doesn't deserve your business.<br>  <br>  Take your money elsewhere. Forget that bike and never go to that shop again. You should be able to find another used bike in the ￡100 range locally, perhaps at a boot sale or in the newspaper.|`|OCMrQVRxaa	that is some bad welding do not get on that bike u will problly snap it aggen|`|DOVbF4Piaa	Wow, that is one terrible repair job, it wont last.  I would get a new bike.|`|YE87HP26aa	That isn't very well done; I would just take the credit buy a new bike.<br>  Important: Make sure to keep the new bike away from moisture (I ruined a frame the same way) so it will NOT rust, as that is what happen to the frame in the pictures, it rusted and failed (broke).|`|x5FdpRkDaa	Steel bike frames are brazed, not welded. This does not look like a good fix to me, but unless you got a new bottom bracket shell to braze in properly, his options were limited. Do not trust the welds. Maybe he has a cheaper bike and will still give some credit for the old bike?
oHIlRKl2aa	I highly recommend using shoes designed for the high jump.  Unlike sprinting shoes, high jump shoes have spikes in the heel that prevent you from slipping when you run and takeoff.  Also, sprint shoes are designed to have you run on your toes.  High jump shoes have a flat sole that is designed so you can takeoff correctly.<br>  <br>  High jumping in sprinting shoes would definitely increase your chances of injury.<br>  <br>  If high jump shoes are too expensive, you can find an alternative and add what is called a J- heel.  This is a velcro strap that straps around the shoe and places spikes on the heel.  You can remove it easily if you are going to use those spikes for a different event.<br>  <br>  Hope this helps.<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.track-and-field-jumpers.com/high-jump.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.track-and-field-jumpers.com/h...</a>

2SSD6BP9aa	The Bike Athletic company actually claims they invented the term jockstrap, when they designed their first athletic supporter for "bicycle jockeys" who rode hard-wheeled bikes over bumpy cobblestone streets back in the late 1800s.  These were bone-jarring rides that would leave men sore if they didn't have adequate support for their testicles.<br>  <br>  But while they may have been the first to coin the term "jockstrap", the "jock" part of the word probably did not really come from "jockey".  Or at least that wasn't what most people assumed it was from.<br>  <br>  According to the Online Etymology Dictionary, the term "jock" was used as "a slang term for the penis from c.1650-c.1850, probably from Jock, the nickname for John, which was used generically for 'common man' from 1508. Meaning 'an athletic man' is from 1963, Amer.Eng. slang."<br>  <br>  I'm sure that was related to other uses of "John" or "Jack" as generic terms for males - including John Doe, John Bull, "Jacks and Jills" (for "boys and girls"), and even jockeys (who were always male back then).  John has also been used as a slang term for toilets and urinals, as well as for the customers of prostitutes.  "John Thomas" was (maybe still is?) a British slang term for the penis.<br>  <br>  So really "jockstrap" was just a slang way of saying "penis strap".  And it was probably considered a vulgar locker-room term for athletic supporters at first.  The Bike company's claim that it came from "bicycle jockey" was probably an attempt to whitewash the origin of the word.  But as "jock" faded from use as a term for the penis, jockstrap became more acceptable and mainstream.  Male athletes started being called "jocks" because they wore jockstraps for sports.<br>  <br>  And for the other person who mentioned it, a "gridiron" is a metal rack with parallel bars used for grilling meats.  Obviously an American football field with it's parallel lines, resembles a gridiron.  That's why they started calling it that.|`|FfxmE9Toaa	I don't think it has to do with the Scots slang (my grandparents were from there.) All athletes here are called "jocks". It begins in school. The word did come from jock-strap which may have come from horse jockeys. It began as an insult because the dumb jock was given a pass through school instead of learning. All because they could play a sport well while the rest of the students had to earn their grades.<br>  <br>  As an American, I can better understand the reason for "pitch" than I can calling our football fields "the gridiron." "Pitch" makes perfect sense for a playing surface, but "gridiron"? <br>  <br>  Many blame us Yanks for the word "soccer" but it's actually from England. The fans called the FA the "asocc" then slanged it into "soccer". As soon as Yanks picked up on it during WW2, the Brits stopped using it.|`|9f7c3a6b1c85a2b25fdaadcc6f4cc32aaa	The term originatedback in the late 1800's and was originally referred to as a "jockey" strap. It was invented as a modesty peice for bicycle racers, back in that day the concern was the moral aspect of ones moving genitalia while racing a bike. Over time it was like many things shortened to be a "jock" strap and today is largely just called a jock. Of course over time the benefit it offered in the form of protection in other sports kept it viable as when the modesty of a nation dwindled there was less need until it was discovered that they offered genital protection for football players and later for athletes such as baseball and soccer players.

QEHxGyKKaa	It depends if your starting you should probably start with the light gloves like 12 oz  and then work your way up to heavier gloves so id recommend the protex  2 training gloves|`|tMJhvpeEaa	It doesn't really matter which boxing gloves you wear as long as you box and work hard.But I think it will be good if you start with everlast.|`|abTZX46faa	They all have the same purpose really, those gloves you listed, so probably just go for the cheap ones if you're just starting out.

A wise man said that he hopes that Chelsea can stop SAF from winning all four, but that we shouldnt get ahead of ourselves . That wise man was Guus Hiddink. :)|`|tIBZ9Gi3aa	Didn't you get the memo?United's supposed to win EVERYTHING.|`|cjNtjOZtaa	Get to the final? yes.Win it? no.|`|SuqQJJMLaa	its tough to say coz the other big clubs are still in it.<br>  and this is the FA cup so you never know until one team lifts it.<br>  i hope its united|`|rVHPjLfAaa	nooooo..

Good luck to both teams anyway.|`|wurimjbnaa	I think you typed that wrong, and in the semi-finals I hope we play Chelsea. How are you going to react when we win against you?|`|BA1TOMr9aa	WTF are u on woman, LMFAO, UNITED WON 4-0 hahahahaha.|`|cjNtjOZtaa	Probably in to much shock to say anything. That would be my guess.|`|q71osfkiaa	They want to get their money back from all the support and hard work they had put on the team!<br>  <br>  AHAHAHAHAH!|`|MUERDKyzaa	Act like they didn't even care about the fa cup lol.|`|xLyNsywiaa	Probably feel stupid, like you...|`|0t8XYZKRaa	Cry and say that the quin-triple dream is over. :(<br>  That's what I'm gonna do.

7x4VtGtFaa	Breaking news:<br>  <br>  Man CITEH were delighted to bail out record signing Robinho after he was arrested over allegations of sexual assault. A speaking person said “we’re just relieved to have finally spent some money on a decent player.” Meanwhile, Robinho has pleaded his innocence, claiming that he misunderstood the woman after she asked him to show her that little trick he does between the legs.|`|RNr2xeDHaa	Its becoming a daily occurance just lately some football player being arrested for one thing or another .... it puts a bad light on the whole team unfortunately, as you said, you read the headlines and immediately one or two particular names spring to mind ... shame.|`|wurimjbnaa	Brazilians...|`|N7fNwIQSaa	....well it doesnt suprise you really does it...<br>  I wanna see what Wrighty has to say about this on Bowtime on Monday...his own son arrested...|`|ToxDHYsaaa	ha ha, B.W.P used to be at city maybe thats where he learnt his trade. 2nd time he's been arrested.

AGk5gGOtaa	celtics. by the time the playoffs come, KG will be healthy, and marbury will be used to NBA games again.|`|sOae9LUzaa	Whoever has homecourt advantage. Last 15 games have been decided by who's home court it was. If the Celtics beat the Cavs April 12, then Celtics have the Eastern Conference in the bag (Marbury needs to be more decisive with shooting/passing and Mikki Moore needs to be more agressive)|`|WK3Kx4Mkaa	Celtics for sure thye have powe off the bench and marbury and all the other bench players they at gonna win for sure with their bench play and contri utions from the big three when KG gets back and is healthy so I'm going with the. Celtics|`|A71U6gNtaa	Celtics will win it,they just did not show their best yet.|`|1b1e96c4e15d62fb35f5036b2b08dc6caa	Last night the Cavs didn't play good defense and took bad shot selections. I think the Cavs have the potential to win. The Celtics always seem to win at Home though.<br>  <br>  Overall: I would say the Cavs|`|PjFLDSmdaa	Cavs. They'll split the tie breaker when April 12th comes along, and the Cavs will end up with the better record. Therefore assuring homecourt in the East|`|NKN7HwkYaa	I'm not sure. Yesterday I would have said Cavs hands down. But then they lost to the Celtics without KG. So now I'm thinking...I don't know.|`|gRXy66dOaa	as much as i hate to say it<br>  the Celtics*|`|6yoQhXsOaa	Cavs will.|`|E1qOtwZ3aa	Cavs.|`|vJ20fTZWaa	the cavs you cant stop lebron|`|dbgf2Vuhaa	Who said there going to be these 2 teams???? it could be Orlando!!|`|VDGdyHskaa	i dont know but i am thinking the cavs because they have lebron|`|2kgTdNRQaa	CAVs, my bet.<br>  Go Lakers!!!!!|`|jjzK1pOaaa	clearly the team with homecourt advantage which is why i will say the cavs...
Q2sZhNmJaa	My favorite driver Robby Gordon who came in 15th last week, Joe Nemechek, Jeremy Mayfield.|`|Tt2pFEqFaa	Jamie McMurray<br>  <br>  My fave underdog is Ken-neh Wallace though...|`|u4liwDhAaa	I would have to say there are two underdogs Mark Martin and Mikey Waltrip!

Robby Gordon 2nd|`|TifUsG4Maa	Reed Sorenson 43.|`|XRPtuwoTaa	Joe Nemechek|`|W2R8TRDmaa	Jamie McMurray?|`|vIcOdePzaa	I would have to say Robby Gordon|`|TvTg82wyaa	Right now, David Reutimann. Did you know that he has finished 20th or better in 5 of his last 6 Sprint Cup Series races?<br>  <br>  Another nominee is the startup team, The Racer's Group (#71) with David Gilliland. Good Rolex Sports Car Series team with a bright future in NASCAR. Remember, this team won at Mansfield in the Truck Series last year with rookie Donnie Lia.|`|xkGfxn70aa	I agree with everything that you stated above, but.... It would not be right if you did not include Mark Martin, he's had pole positions.  He's had the equipment, backing the money and yet how many races has it been since he has won.Came close once or twice, but has not won.  He's been around a long time, and a championship he has never gotten.|`|50e3b0849b4360114052f91433a42927aa	robby...........i think given the right team,money,sponsor,and team he could be a ligit race contender............just go to his website and check out all his racing stats,i mean the guy can drive,maybe he is beter in the dirt than on asphalt or concrete..........but make no mistake,the dude can drive a racecar|`|c481cd3d34cf6e00f63f4831c44fe613aa	Michael Waltrip, he almost never qualifies up front. And gets wrecked or in a wreck almost every race.  I think he is an excellent driver to advertise for a motor parts company. He is probably their best customer.|`|BD78ZzYkaa	Robby Gordon|`|bTZGob8qaa	Brett Bodine|`|e5B5ITbhaa	Martin Truex Jr|`|9vcZjFl6aa	has 2 be robby gordon|`|BovpXrk1aa	M TRUEX JR<br>  just might win this weekend<br>  last week he had a chance and broke a axle with 77 laps too go when he was closing running 5th!|`|9f0d54c35894f05249bcafb57c720e4baa	.....Reed Sorenson.....|`|aRy2ZvT9aa	Gotta be David Reutimann, has anyone else noticed how great he is finishing so far this yr compared to previous yrs, he is definitely a huge underdog.<br>  <br>  Go Dale Jr & Hms|`|iO12Vjnvaa	Dave Marcis.

ZdNSSm0waa	I think they can.<br>  <br>  BQ: I doubt it......it'll be hard<br>  BQ2: cool|`|VJ1Gsr0Xaa	if bynum is healthy, the lakers will roll to a championship. if he is not, i dont see them beating boston in a 7 game series. im not sure kobe will get to six rings, but he might get 5. <br>  <br>  <br>  Kobe > Wade + Lebrick|`|A71U6gNtaa	Lakers can't still win the CHAMPIONSHIP but they can win the Western Conference.<br>  <br>  Kobe Can't tie MJ's rings because he is now (30).<br>  but we still hope they will win it this year.|`|0ytjj1EGaa	Yes i think we can<br>  <br>  BQ Yes BUT Hard<br>  <br>  BQ2 It Will be same on reality but 4-2|`|7m1h5Z5paa	I think the Lakers have a great chance of winning the NBA Title this year, however, I think they have to get through the defending champs (Boston), Cleveland, San Antonio, and Orlando. <br>  <br>  Kobe is playing a great year! He's getting everybody involved, including Gasol, Odom, Walton, Farmar, and others as well. I think he will get the MVP this year too!|`|NKN7HwkYaa	If the Laker's win the Chamionship, Which you have to think is possible. It won't be because Kobe did it himself. He's got a superstar C - Gasol and an all star F - Odom. Not to mention some other pretty good players. No one does it alone.<br>  <br>  BQ- lets see Kobe has 3 rings, and if he sticks around as long as most players do, then that gives him about 4 to 5 seasons left. Getting 3 rings in 4-5 seasons would be a tall task for anyone.<br>  <br>  BQ2 -Was there a question there? You said you weren't a Kobe fan at the top of your post, but the rest of it sure sounds like you are|`|L66IcsuUaa	YES! It's time for payback and idc if our Finals matchup ain't celtics.<br>  <br>  BQ: If the lakers can 3-peat, then YES!<br>  <br>  BQ2: Nice 4-1! When I made the Finals, Celtics won 3 in a row and I made a series comeback. In game 7 I won the game-winning 3! (Thank you fisher!)|`|w8AFCj5xaa	nope Spurs 09 title lock <br>  <br>  <br>  BQ even if kobe some how finally wins a ring this year as the undisputed team leader he still has long way to go to catch up to MJ <br>  <br>  <br>  BQ2 simulated video games = irrelevant|`|C4mzZwiWaa	100% sure.<br>  <br>  <br>  BQ1- nah<br>  <br>  BQ2- thats ***** awsome, and for that im goin to get 2k9 today.|`|6yoQhXsOaa	NO, the Jazz will beat the Lakers in the Western Conference Finals!|`|vJ20fTZWaa	no kobe and pau can't do it on their own|`|uxregJ0faa	No one wins the championship by himself. Kobe and help have a good chance at winning this year.<br>  <br>  Kobe MIGHT catch up but it looks slim.|`|1Z0Lmrk1aa	Yes the Lakers have as good a shot as any of the top contenders. But I think they will need a healthy Bynum to do it.
aUyopOWiaa	I cannot stand the Metrodome. It's the worst, without a doubt,  Especially on those beautiful Minnesota summer days and nights when I'm on the way to go to a Twins game. It's awful to know you are going to go sit inside under a Teflon roof! <br>  Sure, it has its advantages on the field for the Twins, but it's really not fun for us fans to go catch a game. 2010 can't come fast enough!|`|tvuhGTD9aa	I went to one game at the Metrodome back in 2003 or thereabouts. To their credit, the Twins had really tried to make it feel like a ballpark -- lots of banners commemorating past great players and titles -- but there was only so much that could be done with the place. I thought it felt like a gigantic lecture hall with a particularly large demonstration stage, carpeted green. It wasn't bad, just... utilitarian.<br>  <br>  Not the worst I ever visited, though. That distinction easily goes to Stade Olympique in Montreal. Ugh, just a dungeon.|`|u4liwDhAaa	I hate to watch basketball in person anywhere!  Basketball is my least favorite sport! <br>  <br>  Have never been to the Metrodome...<br>  <br>  This is the best answer I can come up with :+)<br>  <br>  Eich|`|CK45Qeulaa	Na hate it|`|6BiiraLpaa	Hey I like the dome its comfortable. But when we get this new stadium its gonna suck in April, May, and September we are going to be playing in below 30 degrees weather it is going to suck, put in a retractable roof i mean come on use a brian. <br>  <br>  Least Favorite place to watch sports: Any Soccer Stadium<br>  <br>  Which Arena: ALL OF THEM|`|T3tRfZpqaa	metrodome bathrooms are the worst ever<br>  <br>  their food is horrible<br>  and they haven't been so hot in recent years<br>  including last years choke<br>  <br>  worst though is the Superdome (just kiddin)|`|lyrn67VBaa	the Metrodome is awful. I mean cmon, they hit into a giant garbage bag on the right field wall!|`|ofC4JQIhaa	i dont know if that is a horrible place to watch games cause ive never been there but one park that is so hard to watch games in is Wrigley Field i mean theres too much poles in the way you cant even see the action so yea thats what id say|`|V430UrvFaa	I'm glad they are moving out of that stadium, it was rundown and the field is disgusting looking. The Twins are moving into an open (non retractable stadium) and that means possible freezing temperatures in April, maybe snow. Whether I like or hate the Metro dome, I despise it, like many other people. The new stadium will be so beautiful.
RNr2xeDHaa	LMAO @ Ibzy's answer!<br>  <br>  Well see what ones the pigeons s**t on, that's the only way i think! lol!|`|44813878d7833360079cff79c6842b5faa	Actually that happened earlier on in the season, in one game ferguson took berbatov off at half time for an old pile of slate he found out the back of ot. No-one seemed to notice in fact I came on here afterwards and there were questions  congratulating him on his work rate.|`|5OghICp4aa	hahaha if that did happen i would bet anything that he scores a hat-trick and wins the lotto at the same time and utd then win everything .... <br>  <br>  utd are the luckyist, flookiest club on the planet.|`|UMJpjAjBaa	To be honest I wouldnt say so ! Although he is a great player when he actually moves , he might aswell be a statue most of the time .!!!<br>  <br>  <br>  Oh and for the person who wrote that comment about utd been lucky ..<br>  <br>  They aint lucky there just good !!|`|7x4VtGtFaa	Perhaps not because the statue will score from a tap in for a United win.|`|8QxVjXUxaa	hu cares about berbatov or man utd??|`|DB4RRjXTaa	They already have, haven't they?|`|JCRdicqXaa	Yeah, Alonso when he tries to get him red carded.|`|LdJFFvSVaa	Yeah the sculpturer will probably do him with a smile|`|bNykcEVXaa	Ha ha ha ha .. excellent.. I REALLY almost fell of my armchair laughing at that...?<br>  <br>  that's more like it.... <br>  <br>  <br>  dR bad<br>  I think we should just put one in the opp's 6 yard box... and give Berba a rest ...he's earned it!!?<br>  <br>  Edit: gotta say though.... LMAO at Option & Lycan's replies..|`|cjNtjOZtaa	Not really, he pops  up at the right moments, no denying that he is a very good player but he is bone idle, I'm sure he is more pissed of after scoring a goal than before the goal.Because he has to walk some more|`|tfotPdeZaa	Yes, because not even the most talented sculptor would be able to make a statue so creepy, and give off a "I'm going to suck your blood or rape your kid" vibe :)|`|gpNIG15eaa	The statue of Berbatov has reserved a couple against you guys next week.|`|0dTXkBopaa	hahaha<br>  rooney wont, he wont know the difference, if u no what i meen

But Remeber this. YOU COULD NOT BEAT AMERICA. THE GAME WAS PRETTY CLOSE.|`|qbPbvLuLaa	Probably. The Mexican league is very unpredictable where the worst team can defeat the best team.|`|qfFcY2mGaa	yes but pachuca still has more points|`|g4ukAIecaa	yea they will keep it i mean necaxa isn't the greatest team right now but they can surprise at any moment|`|Cpm25Pekaa	They started to play better against Santos. I think they will beat or tie with Toluca.|`|eWadjRfpaa	Watch<br>  <br>  Necaxa-3<br>  Toluca-2

MjPd9vyYaa	Yeah I know I'm worrying sick. On and off the pitch I'm worrying. Numancia are rock bottom right now but when its comes to Valencia facing smaller clubs we have a hard time scoring. Our defence is really weak...it never gets better no matter how many times Emery says " We're working on it" And today Villareal won their game so that means if we win tomorrow it will make us 5th with only a 1 point difference.<br>  <br>  We have NO strikers which worries me but maybe this will show that Valencia isn't so dependt on Villa and the others.<br>  <br>  About the economic problems I don't know because we are in a tight situation. If we make the top 4 thats gets us a place in CL.

9f7c3a6b1c85a2b25fdaadcc6f4cc32aaa	I am partial to the old barns. They had none of the luxury of the new style arena's, no luxury boxes, small bathroom (my only dislike) and were generally cramped. The best part as odd as it sounds were the smells and sounds you got in those barns. Being a Wings fan my first experiences with the NHL were at Olympia Stadium which was a musty old barn with lots of character but very poor anemities. But as much as I love the Wings I have to admit there was nothing like a trip to the old Chicago Stadium. The place had incredible energy every night and I have very vivid memories of the massive pipe organ and the amazings sounds that filled the building. Plus they had one of the all time great National Anthem singers in Wayne Messmer and just the anthem sent chills down your spine. And the banter in the arena, Hawks and Wings fans going at it tooth and nail yet somehow I managed to meet some incredible fans and they got me great room rates and we would sit down at the local watering hole and have a glass or two of our favorite drink while enjoying a shared hockey story or two. I have visited a few arena's and love the energy at the Joe (Joe Louis Arena) and the United Center(was a deadzone for awhile but recently the energy is back) but nothing beats the memories of those 2 old barns.|`|CsSizOhpaa	Current: XCel Energy Center  <br>  <a href="http://hockey.ballparks.com/NHL/MinnesotaWild/interior.jpg" rel="nofollow">http://hockey.ballparks.com/NHL/Minnesot...</a><br>  Past: Metropolitan Sports Center (Bloomington, MN)<br>  <a href="http://hockey.ballparks.com/NHL/MinnesotaNorthStars/interior.gif" rel="nofollow">http://hockey.ballparks.com/NHL/Minnesot...</a><br>  <br>  I remember going to a North Stars game where the old joke came true, "I went to a boxing match and a perfectly good hockey game broke out"<br>  <br>  In a perfect world, the North Stars would still be here in Minnesota and we would still have the Xcel Energy Center.<br>  <br>  My favorite Hockey Arena (non-NHL) is Mariucci Arena in Minneapolis, MN, it has a cool atmosphere, plus there is no bad seat and the Student section and band are freaking awesome, especially when the Gophers are playing a WCHA team...<br>  <br>  Old Mariucci: <a href="http://www.gopherhockeyhistory.com/history/artwork/images/fogartyMariucci.jpg" rel="nofollow">http://www.gopherhockeyhistory.com/histo...</a><br>  <br>  New Mariucci:<br>  <a href="http://www.vintageminnesotahockey.com/files/Images/Gophers-Sioux.JPG" rel="nofollow">http://www.vintageminnesotahockey.com/fi...</a>|`|YN8Rbjogaa	the Excel Energy Center in St. Paul is far and away the best arena in the NHL.

I like venues that have names with character.  Joe Louis is a good example of Detroit pride and a good name for an arena given the number of notorious bouts that have gone down on the ice in the JLA.  Most players in the league say they believe the JLA has the best ice conditions as well.<br>  <br>  I have also had the privilege of seeing games in Chicago and Hartford, before they moved to Carolina.  I go to Purdue so the United Center is the closest NHL arena for me, and given that they are division rivals of Detroit, it makes for a convenient venue.  Recently, the atmosphere in the United Center has improved.  I went to a Whalers game with my grandpa when I was young and I admired the spirit of the fans, as they appeared somewhat downtrodden by the Whalers' perennial mediocrity, but still they sold out games and proved that they were a legitimate hockey town with their support.  Unfortunately, a state with only 3 million people that lies less than 4 hours away from 5 different franchises in NJ, NY, BOS, and PHI was doomed to lose their franchise eventually, but I'd like to see the Whalers return someday.  I haven't been to any games elsewhere so my perspective is limited.|`|l8aYLLDQaa	the Prudential Center. its the newest arena, the nicest looking and i think that its cool going into the arena and seeing all the highschool and travel team's jerseys up on the wall. i always look for mine and my rivals. other then that THERE IS NO BAD SEAT literally. the 10-35 dollar seats are awesome.|`|wq78mBeWaa	I've only been to one but I don't think there's a better one.

kqP7GwOcaa	It is no uncommon for judges to score a round 10-8 without either fighter having scored a knockdown if one fighter overwhelmingly dominates another, so in that regard the 10 point must system does in fact do almost what you are suggesting.  The problem isn't the scoring system, it's the individual judges and their opinion on what is actually taking place directly in front of them.  You could fill a book just with complaints about questionable scoring of fights.<br>  <br>  I don't think it is necessary to change the scoring system, but you could improve on it if you could somehow remove the human factor.|`|5fabd1dde8996146708da2f18d2feea8aa	It's the fighters, not the judges, who make the fights.  <br>  <br>  If a fight goes 12 rounds and the guy who comes on late gets a disproportionate number of points for that, why fight 12 rounds?  Make the fight four rounds.<br>  <br>  Some fighters start early and fade late.  Others start slowly and come on late.  Giving extra points to a guy who finishes strong would change the nature of boxing.  The guy who wins the whole fight should win the decision.  The first round is just as important as the 12th round.|`|XrViVeqPaa	No, I don't believe it would. The judges are the bottom line here. There have been and will be more incredulous round scoring by boxing match judges. Even when a fighter clearly wins a round, occasionally there's a ringside judge who gives the round to the guy who just got hammered for 3 minutes. There are so many examples of "who the heck were you watching" when it comes to round scoring. The Juan Diaz - Michael Katsidis September 2008 bout immediately comes to mind. <br>  <br>  I realize that it's easier said than done but when a fighter clearly dominates and controls a fight, he deserves the decision. There's only one way to take bad judges out of the equation. Knock the guy out.|`|zzvDybEiaa	The problem with scoring in boxing, As I See It, is the "Weighted Scoring"<br>  <br>  Where a fighter is given the round, to affect a predetermined outcome.<br>  <br>  Unfortunately, for the Fighters, It's as rampant today as ever.<br>  and can be obtained by the Gambling forces, coercing, Judges / Referees / Corner men / Cut men / Trainers etc.<br>  <br>  As long as there is gambling, and So much money involved, the fate of the sport will not change.|`|PbEs5z1Kaa	i agree with your "why should somebody who barely won a round get the same result as someone who clearly won a round" point, that is pretty lame. i don't get why winning a later round should mean more than winning an earlier round. in fact, i don't like stamina fighters, i prefer a fighter who puts it all on the line.|`|8Sw8rJgtaa	I don't think the scoring system should change,but i do think judges need to be trained.It seems like some don't even know anything about boxing sometimes.Some of those what the hell were they watching score cards are due to ignorance of the sport or possible corruption.A national commission should be in place to make sure the right judges are working fights and to clean up other aspects of the sport.Another thing that could put an end to some bad decisions is to bring back 15 rounders,that would help put the outcome of a fight back in a fighters hands.

rxRFQlLXaa	Now to begin, it's totally wrong to generalize into saying that Indian Muslims support Pakistan,cause not all Muslims are the same, there might be a few, but can't blame all for the action of a few!!,, Now Indian muslims are very much Indian like any of us ( we all  know that!!), despite what those Pakistani's think,  my best friend's  an Indian muslims,he's a die hard fan of the Indian team  he is like my brother and i will save him with my life,if he weren't be in any sort of trouble, let me share with u a small incident that happened, once a foreigner asked him, if he was Pakistani and OMG, trust me, i had never seen his face change, as such , if he would have stayed there for more than a couple of minutes, i tell you he would have done something horrible, beyond one's imagination, anyway coming back to the topic, if you are Indian, i would ask you not to judge, all by the action of a few, and your questioning as such, will hurt the feelings of many true Indian muslims who are ready to sacrifice even there life for India, especially those soldiers that protect us, every day from our enemies saving us with there lives!!,,, Let's not  create this division or barrier between us!, cause i believe we Indians are One, no matter what religion we are!!!<br>  <br>  Posted wrong section!!|`|bHheiqY6aa	Yes, a minimum number of Radicals do support pakistan, while india playing against pakistan.<br>  I do not know what is their point of view? The same time do you think any pakistanis support India? I think may be very minimum. <br>  cheers|`|ms0eYsD5aa	I know a few muslims who don't but some do support pakistan|`|BJNWnzDIaa	Yes, uneducated Muslims support Pakistan not just in cricket matches but every where. My school friends who were Muslims were vehement supporters of Pakistan. One year back I used to visit a Fast food center regularly and all the people who used to work there were  Muslims and on one day there was a match between India and Pakistan, which was running in favor of India but in the end Pakistan pulled a victory after which they celebrated felicitously and never before and after I've seen them in such a joyous mood.<br>  <br>  However middle class educated Muslims doesn't support Pakistan and in fact they despise Pakistan more than us. And I've never been with any rich or upper class Muslim so I can't say anything about them.<br>  <br>     I drew this conclusion only because I've seen them doing but the no. of Muslims I've been through in my life is hardly 15. So maybe someone has to do a research on this. lol.|`|QtdO1RlQaa	I think your friend is prejudiced against Muslims and doesnt realise how nice they can actually be. Those who wanted to be Pakistanis left the country in 1947 and those who want to be are still welcome and free to leave, but when a person is India, well u cant say it, feel it. We are one......|`|GdJTQX6raa	no it is not true.may be a section of fundamentalists could do this.a very negligible percentage would not make the entire Muslims in India unpatriotic, we are living among many Muslim friends. it is not true as stated.|`|KyU7thGRaa	dont know|`|TXe7XqUlaa	If that is true then they are not Indians. They are scum. You should support your own country, otherwise where is the pride? If you are Pakistani support Pakistan. If you are Indian support India. Anything else is foolish.|`|xPaXWSLLaa	Meh eh heh heh?
FFE9Qztzaa	The club chose ME.<br>  <br>  Liverpool grabbed more of my attention from the rest, and deeply fell in love with them. Thus, devoting myself to one club, and one club only... and that's pretty much how it all began...<br>  <br>  oq: Not really, but do look at scores and stuff.|`|HxET88bDaa	It was chosen for me by my dad who supported them since young too, i basically started supporting them since birth although obviously i was only properly conscious of it since a certain age. He got me in a Utd shirt as soon as he could. One of my earliest memories was the Cup Winners Cup in 1991.<br>  <br>  OQ: A bit, yes.|`|Oj9ITMSFaa	My family have been supporting Arsenal since the 1920s. So i had no choice, its the best inheritance i could ever have.|`|tIBZ9Gi3aa	I chose my team.My whole family supports Liverpool.I had Liverpool shoved down my throat when I was young,and when my mind became lucid,I just switched.I think even if you were born into a family that supports a certain team,and you didn't like that team,you wouldn't support them.<br>  <br>  I chose United when I was 11 or so,maybe a little younger.That was when I first started watching football regularly.When I was a kid all I knew about football were FIFA on Playstation and those Liverpool memorabilia my uncle has in his office.It took up like 3/4 of the walls.<br>  <br>  OQ - Don't follow it regularly.The only time I watch the Championship is during the play-offs.There's not much Championship coverage in my country.|`|wQpdot1Raa	My team (Hull City) was chosen for me! It doesn't make you a lesser fan just because you didn't choose your own team, in some ways it can make you more of a fan, for example if you, your dad and your dad's dad were all brought up to support Arsenal then you've had a longer association with them than someone who decided to support them when they were 10 yrs old.<br>  OQ: I loved championship football ever since we got promoted into that league and still look out for who's playing who even though we're premiership now.|`|S0XArokKaa	I was born in North London, my Nan used to sell after shave to David Seaman (I have his autograph on the back of a picture of me when I was a little boy) and I loved watching Ian Wright play. So I have always been an Arsenal fan. And will be till I die. Also my godmother is an Arsenal fan, who lives near the old Highbury.|`|9DLsBJJQaa	my dad is a HUGE football fan but didnt go for any team and one day i saw a manchester united and city game in the 05-06 season and then i started liking them and now i have like 8 jerseys and a whole bunch of other crap|`|AA12370193	I chose it. I watch football from many corners of this planet and Arsenal attracted me the most 11 years ago, still doing the same or similar under Wenger.|`|uWUyrRFxaa	It was chosen for me, my Dad would kill me if I supported any other team!<br>  <br>  OQ: No, I don't.|`|LdJFFvSVaa	My dad and brother were Everton fans while the rest of my immediate family weren't really fussed, my uncles were a mixture of Wolves fans, Liverpool fans and my mums brother was an ardent Swansea fan... I think it's all the same the only dividing line is if you have/haven't supported your personal club all your life and how local it is to you. <br>  For example TD me as much as you want but it's hard to take seriously a Manchester United fan who was born and lives in London family ties or not.<br>  <br>  OQ Yeah follow Wolves|`|duJgBxUoaa	I chose Liverpool..Ever since i was small i loved watching football..But i didn't always watch the matches..but when i did Liverpool always seemed to playing, always(this is not a lie). After while i started watching them more regularly and then i came to really like them..And to this day i still do :)<br>  <br>  OQ..Not really :)

zBwyfE92aa	Try using a loofa... you can get them from Big Lots for $1.50.  Get the kind that is oval shaped. Should take them away in about 1 week, but you must use it in the shower everyday. You can also use some acne medicine for your back, as you would on your face.  <br>  <br>  Also, you can just get a suit that sorta covers your back. That can be hard though.
92e74b5c9571c9dcdd15573e4a3ba0b4aa	1) Albert Pujols- you know what you're getting out of him: .335 AVG/115 RBI/35 HR's/100 runs/5 SB. You want consistency out of the #1 overall player. That's something Hanley doesn't guarantee. Yes 1B is a very deep position, but the difference between Pujols and the #2 1B (probably Cabrera) is HUGE.<br>  2) Hanley Ramirez- while I am not 100% sold yet, call me crazy, he is talented and a 35/35 threat nonetheless. Rare power-speed combo at a very thin position. I rank him 2nd because I am perfectly happy with a Drew, Jeter, Peralta or Aviles late in the draft. No one can deny his potential though. I probably will like him #1 in 2010<br>  3) David Wright- helps in every category and after ARod's injury, he is the best player at a very thin 3B position this year. He is a solid bet for 30-35 HR's, 100 RBI's, 100 runs, 15 SB's, and a .300 AVG. What's not to like?<br>  4) Grady Sizemore- similar to David Wright but he is ranked lower because he plays at a deeper position and won't put up the same RBI's or .AVG. However, he will steal more bases than Wright and his free-swinging mentality should get him about 5 more HR's. So besides the mediocre average, Sizemore is a guaranteed help in every stat.<br>  5) Ryan Braun- the Hebrew Hammer. I'm not sure if there's a nickname that better describes a player. Of this top 5, he may hit the most HR's, record the 2nd most RBI's behind Pujols, and just like everyone else in this top 5, he steals bases! 15-20 SB's is certainly possible. I'll take the 95-100 runs as well<br>  6) Jose Reyes- I really don't see the attraction for him in the top 5 other than the fact SS is a paper thin position depth-wise. You basically are paying a first round pick to acquire a 2-category player. It does not make much sense in my mind. 120+runs and 60+ SB's is nice, but that is essentially all you are getting out of him. If you take him with a #1 pick, then your strategy for the next 3-4 rounds is to acquire power guys, which in turn decreases your likeliness to get top notch pitching. I want more than 15 HR's and 65 RBI's from my #1 pick. The huge SB and R though is enough for him to be a top 10 because it's a guarantee to finish in the top 3 for those stats (if it's a roto league).<br>  7) Miguel Cabrera- I like the HR's, I like the RBI's, I like the position versatility, and he is a good bet to get his .AVG back to .300. Again this is the production you want out of a Round 1 pick.<br>  8) Josh Hamilton- huge power source for HR's and RBI's and should give you a good amount of runs. Doesn't hurt to play in Arlington either.<br>  9) Ian Kinsler- see Hamilton. Plus you have to like he is the the best at 2B, which isn't as weak of a position as it has in recent years, but still doesn't have too much depth. I have him at #9 however, because Hamilton has the advantage in HR's and RBI's while Kinsler has the advantage in R's and SB's, stats that can be found later in the draft.<br>  10) Ryan Howard- will put up a HUGE amount of HR's and RBI's. You have to account for his batting average late in the draft however, certainly knocking down his value. He wouldn't be on this list if not for ARod's injury.|`|e0M5lpc2aa	1. Hanley Ramirez - good at all 5 hitting categories and at a position with shallow depth. Legit number 1<br>  2. Grady Sizemore - 30 HR, almost 100 RBI abd 35 SB. If his avg comes up at all, he's a good pick. Legit top 5, number 2 is probably too high.<br>  3. Josh Hamilton - 32 HR and 130 RBI in his sophomore year. He's matured into a natural player, look for a stat increase this year.<br>  4. Ryan Braun - Almost equal to Hamilton, but he had a little sophomore slump with .avg. Expect a big year.<br>  5. David Wright - Solid all around. Can't see a reason to be out of top 5<br>  6. Albert Pujols - Consistent at 30HR, 120 RBI. Safe number 6 pick.<br>  7. Ryan Howard - Came into camp 20lbs down, and is hitting well this spring. Look for him to bat .280+ with 50HR and 140 RBI.<br>  8. Chase Utley - 32 HR and 120 RBI after playing half a year with a hip injury. Feels good, and will be playing spring games this next week. Look for 35 HR and 130 RBI, at another shallow position.<br>  9. Roy Halladay - 20 Wins, 200K and a sub 3 ERA. Enough said.<br>  10. Cole Hamels - Undefeated in postseason, solid start this spring. He's the best Yahoo! rank #45 you'll ever see.<br>  <br>  There's my top 10.|`|Ff7lRKHiaa	Hanley<br>  Reyes<br>  Pujols<br>  Utley<br>  Wright<br>  Arod<br>  Holliday<br>  Miggy<br>  Grady<br>  Hamilton<br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  NOTE: i only answerd for points i really don't care<br>  <br>  <br>  Hope i Helped|`|XzhjWTA2aa	hanley, reyes, wright, pujols, pedroia, sizemore, cabrera, utley, braun, howard|`|YjoNncI7aa	Hanley<br>  Reyes<br>  Pujols<br>  Utley<br>  Wright<br>  Arod<br>  Holliday<br>  Miggy<br>  Grady<br>  Hamilton<br>  <br>  Come to RootZoo for the best fantasy answers online.

Q4fOTUNNaa	It is of no meaning blaming parore, he has expressed his feelings frankly and there is nothing worng in it. But i dont agree with him. Terrorism is now became a globle problem. Every sports persons and the officials are deeply concerned about what happened with the srilankan cricket team in pakistan. But you can not compare the sub-continent specially india with pakistan. I am living in mumbai, india and i dont think that there will be any problem for cricket world cup 2011 to be played in india. I am not sure about bangladesh and srilanka because of their internal problems. In addition to this a lot of money can be earned if the tournament takes place in india. You want find better place other than india for making money from the game of cricket and if the  government of india guarantees the security of the players then i dont find any reasons why it should not be played in india. Now it is  up to ICC to decide.|`|GvgqUV13aa	i agree with you hands down ,that guy parore(i used to call him padora) is a jerk,,i still remember him playing against india, he was always sledging behind the stumps, i think he hates india,,,,and wat is with these guys,,it's pakistan security failure why the fish they are dragging indians into it or whole subcontinent for that matter,,,they must be thinking about their grounds ,,no one can snatch it from indians ,,they better don't,,,other wise ICC will go bankrupt LOL,,,they can't mess with BCCI .no one should forget that india is the best place for cricket its not pak dude this is a democratic country so there's no  question of low security.|`|vlzq1JRmaa	If Parore has his way the terrorists will have achieved their goal.

I think it's a fair assessment that none of the players would want to travel to the subcontinent after the Pakistan terrorist attack. It isn't safe. People get blown up all the time there and now cricketers have started being the targets.<br>  <br>  If the only thing you have against NZ is the climate, I laugh at/and mock you. Also, referring to an incident that happened in 1985 is sort of lame. Living in the past much? When was the last major terrorist attack in the subcontinent? Oh, that's right. About three days ago.<br>  <br>  You're absolutely entitled to your opinion. It's going to be completely biased though. Of course you will say the the subcontinent is a safe place. The unfortunately reality is that it isn't. I would love for the WC to be played in India/Pakistan/Bangladesh.<br>  <br>  A tournament such as the WC is exactly what the terrorists would be waiting for. It attracts a large audience, involves a lot of people, and performing an act of terror on such a tournament would have a massive effect. Sure, no country is immune to terrorism. But the chances of such an event occuring is much greater on the subcontinent than anywhere else in the world.<br>  <br>  My issue isn't with India specifically. It's the entire subcontinent. The w@nkers next door to India have the resources to do real damage if they want to regardless of the security implimented to protect the players.|`|fsLMFIpgaa	I agree with Parore. Does not the Mumbai bombing prove that India is also underprepared for such things? I would like to see the WC go to England or SA, even Australia, but the sub continent is too available to terrorists to travel through. No offence Evan, but I think people on the sub-continent are so used to this kind of thing you have become too complacent.|`|xU7AaQOdaa	Like Miandad and Butt, Parore is over reacting here- does he think that there will be less of a chance of "trouble" in the UK, given the high Asian populations in Bradford (10 miles from Headingley) or Leicester (30 miles from Trent Bridge)? If so, let the ICC ban matches at those 2 venues, or indeed, any City in the World that has an airport or Maritime "Port of Entry".<br>  <br>  His argument has no basis, and at this moment in time I would happily travel to India or Sri Lanka- Bangladesh...perhaps.|`|30c23719ae8384dcfe8ecff1164d60cbaa	Mumbai episode cannot prove India unsafe for cricket. It should not be forgotten that the places attacked in Mumbai were not having the type of security needed to protect against such attacks. In Pakistan, though cricketers were supposed to have been provided highest level of security, it is now clear that even ordinary security was lacking. There was no gunman inside the bus in which they were travelling. This has been admitted even by Pakistani authorities. And despite that cricketers havn't suffered in any major way. In India, security is so strict that I remember an incident in which the famour actor Shahrukh Khan who had sponsored Bengal Team in IPO had difficulty meeting cricketers in the dressing room. Recently, even Zaheer Khan had difficulty getting his guests meet him. Security personnel take no risk even at the cost of little hardship to the people to whom such security is provided. English team would not have continued their tour even after the Mumbai incident if they were not convinced about proper security in India. I hope now Pakistan would have learnt a lesson and would no longer remain lax in providing security to international teams.|`|GdJTQX6raa	the entire sub-continent is very safe but Pakistan.2011 WC should be held as scheduled and the matches scheduled to be held in Pakistan can be re-scheduled and shifted out of Pakistan.

It is unfortunate that what happened to sports fraternity, we have got to be more practical and UNITED WE CAN REMOVE THIS TERRORISM FROM THE WORLD>|`|QtdO1RlQaa	It is wrong on his part to have so publicly said that.

We have some of the best defence systems in the world, each police officer or commando ready to lay down his life to save that of the others.

LPO8RlVdaa	This is a rounded question that can never be answered. Each martial art has its own strengths, weaknesses and specialities. Tae Kwon Do for example is excellent at explosive aerial attacks and kicks, Muay Thai is simialar but concentrates on hard striking with the legs, elbows and fists, boxing is excellent for a stand up punching match whilst Judo is excellent at close quarter grappling... etc etc. <br>  <br>  Where effectiveness comes in depends on two things, wether the art is suitable for the practitioner (would a stocky, muscular guy be better at Judo or Gung Fu etc?) and the individual skill of that practitioner. <br>  <br>  My advice would be find the art that suits you personally and train your hardest in it till you are the best you can be.|`|GpzvrlHdaa	The most accurate answer here is the martial artist who had a teacher that understood his art the best.  TKD isn't better or worse than karate, or jjujitsu. they are different methids of acomplishing the same thing, which is to protect you and make you a better person.  The best one is the one you know the most about.  J|`|9977764272d89791dbe653655d661597aa	Every martial art has it's own specialties. Tae Kwon Do, I believe, is more of a burst power basis, using punches, kicks, and throws to neutralize the opponent.<br>  <br>  Judo, is a type of martial art where only grappling and throwing is used. It's quite close combat, and once on the floor most people can be choked to death.<br>  <br>  Tai Chi is a martial art that uses the flow of energy to protect oneself. By twisting and manipulating it, you can turn an opponent's power against them. Taichi is a series of blocks and quick pushes to throw the opponent away using the force they used.<br>  <br>  Shaolin martial arts are based off animals, and each of those animals has their own specialty. E.g., Tiger=power, Snake=dodging and hitting pressure points, etc.<br>  <br>  There are countless more, you just have to learn your martial arts well, learn to apply it to most situations, stay calm, and execute. When two people have different swords, it is the person's skill with that sword that will win, not who has the bigger sword.|`|gBO908P6aa	Any martial art?  How can you know?  The question is too vague and unspecific.<br>  This is like the big fish eating the medium sized fish that was eating the small fish.  Someone says so-and-so art is better than TKD but that's just an opinion because who's to say another art is better than the one that's better than TKD.  It never ends.  You are also forgetting the human factor.  The art is only as good as the human using it.|`|i0EKsGayaa	Sigh........ <br>  <br>  As always it is not a style that makes a fighter but the fighter itself. It depends on the skill level and how it is taught. Any style would work as long as th fighter can make it work. That being said since lots of TKD is sport centered I'd say muay thai and boxing would give you advantages since tkd doesn't allow punches or elbows to the head. Also since TKD has no ground game it would be safe to assume a ground art like judo and bjj would work well. But always remember it is the fighter and not the art.|`|da32ffbb5a919c5e4a8dfe33b9030065aa	Jeet Kun-do.|`|eIaqyOwraa	The effectiveness of any martial art is solely based on the user. If a person is to just 'learn' a style then pit themselves against someone else who has 'learned' a style whomsoever has the most understanding of their style is more likely to win. If you want to become the best then you must understand fully not only your style but equally understand your opponents.<br>  <br>  Following is a quote you may find interesting.<br>  <br>  Tsutomu Oshima <br>  "In order to achieve victory you must place yourself in your opponent's skin. If you don't understand yourself, you will lose one hundred percent of the time. If you understand yourself, you will win fifty percent of the time. If you understand yourself and your opponent you will win one hundred percent of the time.<br>  - Tsutomu Oshima" <br>  <br>  I know i have not answered you question directly but hopefully you can siphon some understanding from what ive submitted.|`|NWP72txEaa	Hard question to answer. Ultimately it depends on the skill level & experience of the martial artist. I've heard lots of claims about how good or "better" a certain martial art is only to see it blown out of the water in actual practice. It also depends on the situation. What might work well in the ring, may not work so well on the street. I've even seen an untrained drunkard beat up a highly trained martial artist before (maybe a mixture of beginners luck & being underestimated).<br>  For my own two cents worth, Tae Kwon-Do is one of the most underestimated martial arts in existence. A fully trained Tae Kwon-Do master is a formidable opponent indeed. Being a hard form art, with its myriad combination of kicks (which is its specialty, not to say that grapples, take downs, holds/locks & arm striking techniques are not used), & other techniques, its practitioners can be very confusing to fight against. I once saw an arrogant Karate Instructor who wanted to prove that Karate was better than Tae Kwon-Do, because the latter supposedly relied on kicks too much. Upon getting in close to exploit this weakness, the Karate Teacher got swiftly knocked out with nasty straight right to the face.<br>  As for what is "more" effective, it really depends on the student. Every student has a style that suits them the most. Tae Kwon-Do may be the style for you, or maybe you are a talented boxer, or Wushu might suit you, or Karate, Aikido, Tai Chi, Wrestling, Muay Tai, etc. Shop around until you find the style that suits you. It may be that your style may sing out to you straight away, or it may prove itself over time. For me, I started with Kung Fu, then Kickboxing, then finally found that Tai Chi (Yang Style) was for me. It took me six years to discover what suited me. Also of note is; what do you want out of the style you are seeking.<br>  For myself, I wanted a style that could teach some sword as well as unarmed. But I mainly wanted an art that teaches Chi techniques, & focuses on spiritual improvement, while giving longevity; not necessarily self defense. It also took a while for me to "give in" to a Soft Form technique.<br>  Good luck on your quest :-)|`|FPuFDrZDaa	Sorry- but this is an unanswerable question. There is no one martial art that is better than another; this is one huge reason mma has become so popular. The UFC was actually started as a tournament to determine who was the all around best martial artist in the world As the sport grew, and other promotions all over the world started up- it was deemed mixed martial arts. But as the sport has grown in popularity and practice- the answer has become clear that no one style is better than another. Wrestlers tend to be successful in mma, cuz of their ability to control the fight on the mat. But when a wrestler with no submission knowledge is matched up with a jiu-jitsu practitioner who works submissions from the mat, the wrestler will be in big trouble if all he can do is take down his opponent... make sense? It's like Rock/Paper/Scissors- one beats the other, which beats the other, but the other beats the first... no one is better than the other. Each "major" martial art (t.k.d., karate, kung fu, jiu-jitsu, etc.) originated from a diff. country, as a means of military combat; then as a particular country's art form became a physical and philosophical way of life for it's citizens, those art forms would branch off into other arts (t.k.d. branched off into diff. forms, also spawned Hapkido, Jiu-Jitsu eventually evolved into brazilian jiu-jitsu, the great Bruce Lee evolved kung-fu into Jeet Kun-Do, etc.). So there is truly not one martial art that is better than another; it's all about finding the one that is right for u. Sorry for the history lesson- but felt it was important to my answer.|`|ZEAqJM4iaa	Effective for what?  I would suggest that each martial art has its specialisms and tae kwon do is famed for its atheletic kicks - so boxing or wing chun could be said to be more effective than tae kwon do in terms of their hand techniques but both could be seen as inferior in terms of the variety of kicks that tae kwon do employs.  It all depends on what you are looking for from your martial art.  Personally there are martial arts I would and have chosen over tae kwon do as my interest is more in self defence than taking part in competition.|`|47i1KYEsaa	Aikido. Aikido is often translated as "the Way of unifying (with) life energy".<br>  <br>  Aikido is performed by blending with the motion of the attacker and redirecting the force of the attack rather than opposing it head-on. This requires very little physical energy.<br>  <br>  The techniques are completed with various throws or joint locks. Aikido can be categorized under the general umbrella of grappling arts.|`|df412c3bb405234c8f6a8353600d0b23aa	I did taekwondo for 2 years, was one  away from my recommended black belt, quit at redbelt, did tournaments, the whole thing and I can tell you that taekwondo the way it is practiced in america sucks.  Its become so commercialized you put in a couple years, break some boards and you get a black belt.  Its ridiculous.  If I had to do it over again, I'd do muay thai and jiu jitsu|`|6sIjbHc3aa	it depends on how u want to fight. u can fight like a man or use something like pencak silat. far as martial arts go, i think the best of it is kickboxing and judo.|`|TnH7OcOKaa	Kung Fu, probably.

p6GGoFDsaa	I'd say Christy is definitely the most improved Knockout, as the others were either already very good when they came to TNA (awesome kong, sojo bolt, etc.) or weren't great when they came and still aren't very good now (i.e. The Beautiful People.) I actually think those two have become worse since they turned heel.<br>  <br>  TNA definitely has the superior women's division. On Smackdown, Maryse and McCool are decent, Gail Kim is good but the others are all crap.<br>  TNA on the other hand has Rayne, Bolt, Khan, Wilde, Roxxi, Saeed and Kong who are all great wrestlers. Christy Hemme is greatly improving, whereas just the three I mentioned before aren't really any good.<br>  <br>  I don't think it's fair to compare TNA and Smackdown because Smackdown is an individual brand in WWE but TNA is just TNA.<br>  If you were to compare the entire WWE womens division to the TNA knockout's it'd be a lot harder to decide who had the better wrestlers.|`|qwdh7N6saa	yeah. the TNA knockout wrestle better.|`|gi0haHtdaa	YOU ARE A HYPOCRITE|`|DvNZr4TAaa	idk<br>  <br>  wat does all that have to do hemme being most improved?|`|lT7vMxmuaa	smackdown rules, i had no idea gail kim joined it... it is going to be soooo much better now!! gail kim is my fave girl wrestler, now tna will stink without her!! trust me|`|QF8rrDIcaa	Y2J u r only a Hypocryte and will be forever and u ****|`|BAurzDXtaa	Christy was really stepping her game up before she got sidelined by that neck injury. She wasn't good but she was improving and there's nothing wrong with a little hard work so I'll say yes that she was improving pretty good until her injury now let's see how she does when she returns.|`|q4v9lO6Laa	Yes, Christy Hemme has improved a lot since the last time i've seen her and every other tna knockout hasn't had a more dramatic improvement (dramatic in a good way). <br>  I have to say TNA <br>  All of the knockouts are better then maria and i bet maybe only gail kim would be willing to get into an extreme match
BAurzDXtaa	TNA, their women's division is top of the line. Losing Gail Kim to the WWE hurt the division somewhat but what doesn't kill you only makes you stronger right.|`|RUMzIzzdaa	Tna Has got some good divas, but most of them are dress up girls.<br>  Out Of The Tna Bunch, Awesome Kong By A Long Shot<br>  <br>  WWE however has also got a handfull of talent.<br>  Mickey James, Natalya. Beth Pheonix, Gail Kim?, Melina and Jillian.<br>  All The Rest Are Dress Ups From Hooters.<br>  <br>  Awesome Kong vs Beth Pheonix would Be Great.<br>  <br>  But WWE Has Probably Better Divas|`|fXqJGnPraa	i have to say tna beacause their in ring performances just be a lot more exciting than wwe i think and their divas acually be in there fightin instead of modeling (not to say that theres anything wrong with a lil modeling)

The SJS - DET series is tied at 2 apiece, but the wings outscore the sharks in their victories 10-1, while the sharks only manage to top the wings by a goal in their wins.

Are you aware that Detroit has crushed the Blackhawks in their series this season?<br>  <br>  Back when the Red Wings shared a division with the Leafs I enjoyed that rivarly, but I'd say the best battle as of late has been with SJS.  In our division, the threats of being overtaken by a rival in the playoffs has really subsided, so its hard to get too into a rivalry with central division teams although they are proving to be more competent and are also beginning to piss me off.  I really would like Dan Hamhuis to die, and there are a number of guys in St. Louis and Columbus (at least Manny Malhotra) that I want to be obliterated by the stone shoulder of Nicklas Kronwall.  A lot of chippy games that get very intense.<br>  <br>  For the sake of nostalgia, I'll say Colorado and Detroit.<br>  <br>  I also enjoy watching a good stomping of the Ducks.|`|AXwJsjQ2aa	I don't see how you can really pit one team against another like this considering everything is so close.

Well there were a lot of them I guess if I think about it more.|`|OFFjKX72aa	The finish to the 2003 Carolina Dodge Dealers 400 in which Ricky Craven and Kurt Busch went door to door going down the front stretch at Darlington with Ricky getting the win by mere inches!|`|iO12Vjnvaa	2003 Darlington.....the #32 and the #97 beating and banging to the finish line.

Jimmie Johnson led the majority of it but towards the end of the race Jeff Gordon caught him with 20 to 30 laps to go.  Gordon had the better car and was all over the back of the 48 beating and banging on him lap after lap.  Coming out of the final turn he got inside of Jimmie and they were door to door all the way to the checkered flag.  Jimmie won by less than half a car length and Jeff was not very happy about it.  I respect the heck out of Jeff for not spinning Jimmie but they were just learning their way around the COT in only it's 2nd race.  In the old car Jimmie would have had his back tires off the ground and Jeff could have easily passed him.  I like how the way the bumpers line up has made for better racing and the days of jacking somebody up to get by them are a thing of the past.  Now you have to get your car handling better or find a different line to be able to pass cars.<br>  4's FINE N 09!!!!|`|GCOrku95aa	2007 Daytona 500-Kevin Harvick beat Mark Martin<br>  2005 Homestead Finale-Greg Biffle beat Mark Martin<br>  2004?

sJrnFCrgaa	Every system is diffenerent. but for the most part, promotion to the next rank should be based off of your knowlege and performance. Time should never come before quality. there is no set time. when the master thinks you are ready he (she) will test you. <br>  <br>  but if its belts you want just buy a belt online.<br>  <br>  train for perfection or train for a belt?|`|dc6f042f0a1f241b0647713f95aefc3aaa	I always tell me students that learning karate is actually one of the easiest yet hardest things to do. All you have to do is study, train very hard, sweat for many hours in the dojo, get your bumps and bruises, perfect your kata and develop the mind body and spirit into one cohesive unit.<br>  <br>  In any real Karate dojo you will get belts along this great journey but if you seek out the belt then they over take your karate training and it will lose its meaning and purpose  being replaced by belt seeking. Do not care about the belts. Perfection of the self and your Karate is more important than the color of the belt around the waist. True Karate Ka (people whom study Karate) resepct dedication, discipline and knowledge above all else. The belts come along with that...but they are as important as those three things at any time.<br>  <br>  Or you can run out and join some crap school, pay for a test every three months and be a certain level of belt. But I would never chose the easy path as then you are a disgrace to all Karate.|`|6sTsDvKmaa	Each school handles testing differently.  Most have a testing period, say every 3-6 months, where everyone gets a testing sheet and must complete all of the tasks and techniques on the sheet to the level that is considered satisfactory.  They often have to show basic physical ability, kata, basic techniques, answer questions, and maybe spar a bit.  Instructors usually look for precision, effort, focus, and power.  <br>  <br>  Some schools may be EXTREMELY lenient about this procedure (which is crap), while others are very strict.  (Talking 10 years to get a black belt).<br>  <br>  Some schools have age restrictions, (ex. no black belts under 15).  This is because many schools believe that it isn't just about physical maturity or ability, but because mental ability is important as well.<br>  <br>  Unfortunately, there are a lot of 'pay for your belt' schools that could care less about who you are and more about whether or not you're keeping the fancy dojo alive.  Parents can be hard to argue with, and there's also the idea that it's more important for the student to gain confidence.  Unfortunately this often leads to the 'feeding the fat kid' sort of school that produces a lot of unhealthy karate students with high ranks.|`|MnMkgAscaa	Rofl<br>  <br>  Yes, you have to have en epic battle with the few remaining living Spartans... and whoever is standing in the end gets their next belt.

And it is my first season and my BEST friend, Hannah has been playing for 5 years.  She is our coaches highest scoring player 2 seasons running!! But yesterday was our first game and we lost 7-0 but today we have another game that we will hopefully win . But soccer is one of those sports that is actually kind of easy to start when your a little older around 9-11 cause it is a very easy sport to get to know, and play well. But someone could be a great soccer player but not make it to the big time soccer. I play left side offense and i got the hang of it very quickly so the thing i would have to say is try your hardest in everything soccer do  a bunch of research and tests and then you'll do great at it. And never never never never ever ever ever never never ever ever give up like for example f you lose a soccer game it's okay unless you didn't even try so a loser that tries there hardest is still a winner!!!

obPSaYf3aa	You probably have a bowling ball fitting that was not done properly at the time.  If you're building up a callouse frequently that opens up or bleeds and you're not really bowling as much as a frequent league bowler or professional, then you need to have it readjusted.  Possible causes could be that the span is too wide, hole pitches (sideways, forward and backward) need to be changed, you're holding on to the ball too tightly because the holes are too big, you have too much friction because the holes are too tight or you don't have enough of a smooth bevel in each of the finger holes or thumb hole. <br>  <br>  Just bring it back to the pro shop you had it drilled at and let he or she know what it's doing to your thumb and how your release is.<br>  <br>  I have the Black Widow Venom as well, but have adequate bevel in all three holes, ring finger is at conventional grip, middle finger is at full fingertip grip and have a thumb slug.  (My unusual finger grip is called the "Noreaster Grip" widely used by PBA professionals and advanced amateurs to prevent tendonitis and hand problems).  Good luck!|`|jiKbIJZBaa	Try a thumb slug, it helped me. Or have the thumb hole drilled out a little and use electrician's tape to snug it up, one of my balls is set up that way.
9fce2f8fbf83c1f76989451a9742b3bcaa	Well i was a really good hitter in slow pitch if thats what your trying out for.<br>  Here are some tips...<br>  -Make sure your knuckles are lined up so you could count across in a straight line.<br>  -Dont always be at the front of the plate. if your a fast swinger, step back a step so when you swing it gives you more time.<br>  -Follow through with your swing all the way so that your bat is all the way back.<br>  -Use your hips, when you hit, turn with your bat so in the end of the swing your facing the pitcher.<br>  -Put all your weight on your back leg.(but dont lock your knee's, if the ball hits one your knee's are broken) <br>  -Twist your body very far, to the farthest point that you can barley see because this will give you the momentum to follow through.<br>  -Bend your legs a little, not too much thoughh.|`|RsTm8uUlaa	1. Always throw your hands at the ball. It'll get you through the zone quicker and you swing right at the ball. Don't use your arms or shoulders, you'll swing late and there's a possibility of injury.<br>  2. Make sure the bat is the right size and has a good drop weight. You don't want to swing a bat that's too heavy, or you'll swing late.<br>  3. Leave your head down, don't bring it up. Watch the ball hit the bat.<br>  4. Wait for your pitch, if it's a ball or not where you want it, don't swing.<br>  5. Be aware of what types of pitches the pitcher has. Sit back on change-ups, don't swing to early.<br>  6. Don't grip the bat too tight, it'll sting your hands and give you blisters.<br>  7. Don't get down/lose confidence because of a previous hit.<br>  8. Know your strike zone.<br>  9. When you're using a pitching machine, chances are you're getting used to the speed and not actually watching the ball. WATCH THE BALL!<br>  10. Hit off a tee. If the tee moves you're not hitting the ball right. Hit the middle of the ball. The only way to do this right is by watching the ball.<br>  11. Soft toss. If you don't know what this is, it's when someone kneels next to you and tosses a ball in front of you, and you hit it (usually into a fence).<br>  12. Always catch the ball out front. If the balls over the plate, it's too late. You should make contact before it crosses the plate.<br>  13. If you're right handed, and you hit the ball and it goes foul to the left you're too early and if it goes to the right you're late. If you're left it's the opposite.<br>  14. Don't be afraid of a walk. I don't know about you, but a lot of people want to go up there and hit. If you're going to want to hit (like most do) wait for your pitch. Take a ball (or 4).<br>  15. Think single or double not fences. A single or double can be a lot more helpful than flying out trying to hit the game winning homerun.<br>  <br>  Bunting:<br>  1. Hold the bat out with both feet toward the pitcher. Hold the bat at a 45 degree angle upwards like / but at 45 degrees. You know what I'm saying?<br>  2. Don't chop/poke at the ball. Use your legs to go up and down and let the ball hit the bat and die off.<br>  3. Pull the bat handle towards third to bunt to first and vice versa. Never back to the pitcher or into the air. Try to get it down the third base line.<br>  4. If it's a sacrifice, it doesn't matter where the ball is, you have to get the bunt down.<br>  <br>  I can't tell you much about second base because I don't play there. Make sure to communicate with the SS though.|`|eac78f41a64d286478c23785cf30be23aa	For 2nd Base...make sure you're stretched out like I mentioned in my last answer.  Also, when you take the field take a moment to "groom" the dirt around you.  If there are a bunch of cleat marks and lumps, flatten them out with your glove or feet.  This will reduce the chances of balls taking bad hops at you.<br>  <br>  As you're fielding the ball, imagine there's a tight cable running from Home Plate to your belt buckle that prevents you from turning your shoulders too far towards the foul lines.  This will remind you to stay "squared up" to the ball and balanced while fielding it.<br>  <br>  Field the ball out in front of you.  Many players make the mistake of placing the glove between their feet, or just in front.  This causes three common problems - <br>  <br>  1) The ball rolls out of your field of vision as it goes under your chin, so unless you're bending your head way down to see (which will throw off your balance and throw-timing) you're basically just "feeling" for the ball.<br>  <br>  2) In the case of a bad hop or really "hot" line drive, you have no chance to make a last second adjustment.  If it gets by your glove, the ball is already through your feet.  If your glove is out in front of you and you don't field it cleanly, chances are it'll bounce off your glove and stay in front of you...this gives you a better shot of still picking up the ball to make the play.  Worst case, you can still drop to a knee to attempt to "body block" a hard-hit ball.<br>  <br>  3) The closer the ball gets to the body the greater the "discomfort" level. If your brain thinks the ball is going to bounce up and hit your gut, you tense up and are more likely to make an error.<br>  <br>  To imagine the proper glove position, get in your fielding stance (feet about 1-1/2 times your shoulder width, knees bent), then cup your hands straight out in front of you (think of the "Allstate" good-hands commercials).  Then bend your knees to get your body lower and drop your arms to a  45 degree angle, and then bend at your waist until your fingertips are about an inch above the ground.  From this position, you should be able to watch the ball all the way to your hands without dropping your chin.<br>  <br>  As for Hitting...there's not much I can think of that will help in a few hours.  Just stay relaxed and focus on contact.  If you have to, choke up on the bat about one hand's width and "chop" at the ball rather than taking a full stride and swing.  In softball, the "chop-hit" is a legitimate way to get on base.  So at a tryout, it's all about making contact.
e0M5lpc2aa	My only suggestion would be to pick up another reliever, especially a closer if you can. Guillen, Konerko and Drew could be ample trade bait for a good closer, but you really only need a decent one. I'd see who is available and then drop Konerko for someone. Also, I'm not a fan of Pelfrey, so you could trade him for a reliever as well.<br>  <br>  Aside from that, your team is VERY solid. Mauer, Pujols, Alexi-Ram, Cano, Ichiro, Lee and Damon are solid players. Ibanez is probably your steal. He hit 30/100 last year and is now playing in Citizens Bank Ball park. I see him hitting 35/125 this year. Nice pick.<br>  Your pitching staff is solid too, like I said, just another closer will round you out perfectly. I also think that mid season you'll be putting Guillen at 3B over Cantu, though I could be wrong.<br>  <br>  Overall, on a scale of 1-10, I rate this an 8.

CvnYpAXSaa	That is one of my friends A. Markovic brother in law no sh*t. He has been in a great run of form with quite a few assists and in the games leading up to the cl game he had a goal  in i believe 4 of the last 6 with 5 assist in that span. A great siberian asset! I think he'll continue to progress!|`|IWM1khX7aa	He's okay.  Not great but decent.  For Inter, I think they are the same as last season almost.

And I have questions about Jardine's chin/|`|Y26eOD9Caa	Jardine wins.  His strength's are Jackson's weaknesses.  He can end fights with leg kicks.  His ground game is underrated.  He has K.O. power, and he isn't going to give up.  His training camp is the most talented in the Business right now.  The only way he's going to lose is if he gets baited into a toe-to-toe brawl.  He will probably go in to this fight with the same strategy he used against Liddell.  Stick and move, don't let Rampage get set, stay away from his power, use plenty of kicks.  Either a K.O. is going to open up for him, or he'll win by decision; I personally think he's going to finish Jackson.|`|gspjg6Jbaa	Watch UFC 96 HD live  only at <a href="http://omgstreams.info/forums/index.php" rel="nofollow">http://omgstreams.info/forums/index.php</a>|`|sLVGdCOTaa	As with most of Rampages opponents, Blocking his fists with their faces never works that good, I don't see this going past the first round, Jackson KO.|`|BNqbOfBsaa	Jardine. I am a huge Rampage fan but I like going for the underdogs most of the time.<br>  <br>    I do think CM77 does make some very valid points though. Most guys that have gotten knocked out by Rampage where guys who where not "light" on their feet. Jardine is a guy who is like that though.<br>  <br>     Jardine was knocked out cold yes... but it was against guys who come at you like bulls and are either going to knock you out or get knocked out themselves. Rampage is not that type of risk taker so I can see this fight being a very technical fight like rampage vs forrest, and Jardine vs liddle. I think Jardine will pull off the upset.<br>  <br>     If Rampage wins I think that would be great too.|`|0918eb31ce1520001d965c6085d6abc5aa	As much as I like Jardine, Id have to say Jackson. Jackson knows Jardine's chin, so he'll run in, guns blazing and go for a quick KO.<br>  <br>  I'm more looking forward to Carwin wiping the floor with Gonzaga!

Last year my batting well, lets just go with i wasn't the greatest batter around. So I took lessons at the batting cage and it really improved my swing! I even found out that I was using too light of a bat. Before it was amazing if I could even hit it out of the infield and I was one of the biggest girls on the team. When you hit don't step as you hit the ball. Take a small step, only about an inch and move your hands back an inch also. Make sure this is even so if you take a 3 inch stride, move your hands three inches. When you turn to hit it, you want to make sure that you right hand is in like a punching position. This will keep the bat straight and will also give you more power. As you turn out want to bend your back leg and keep the front leg straight. Sit on the back leg almost and keep your body straight up. As for the grounders that is one of the easiest things to learn. I was good with grounders but stunk at pop-ups. When you go for the grounder you want to position yourself so you are square to the ball, bend at the knees and stick you butt out then bend over. Put your glove out in front of you slightly and make sure it is in the dirt. Don't be afraid to dive if you think you need to either.

UlOnB7uUaa	Well..what I say, is to just let it go. Don't worry about it, and plus, if you're captain for like three different things, I think you wouldn't want to be captain for Basketball. You will get your chance to be captain, eventually, but not now. Coaches shouldn't have favourites, but I think yours does, but I don't think there's anything you can do about it. I'm writing this right before I leave to the regional championship game for my Basketball team, and today, is the first time ever I get to be team captain. My situation was also sort of like yours, except that the team captain was a Grade 9 on a Grade 8 team. But it's going to be okay. Being captain of a team isn't everything, plus the only perks [now that I've been made captain] is that you get to argue with the ref, and probably scream at your team mates to do stuff on the court [okay, I was doing that before, since I'm also point guard of the team]. So don't sweat it, there's always next year if you don't get your chance this year. If not, then I would consider talking to your coach. Good luck!|`|rLbkG3Qjaa	Ok you will need to become a better basketball player. You should stop thinking that the starter girl isn't as good as you but what you can do to become even better. You should set goals! This girl won't go away...you could make her go away :D but that would be bad-no problem if you don't care. Another thing you can do is try to become friends with your coach. Like get a lil info about him-what he does in his spare time, what music he listens to and try to use it to become the person he'll choose. And if you are the best on your team there won't be any place to hesitate and your coach won't have any other choice than to let you become starter! If I were you I'd put aperient<br>   in her food or drink and let her Sh*t it out while you are playing on your best performance!|`|7c776aqAaa	listen up..... I can relate to you because i play basketball too but you're gonna be dealing with type of stuff all your life, especially being an athlete. So what you need to do is just brush it off. I know it's going to be hard because it's your senior year and you want to shine but if you're the athlete you say you are then you will have plenty of other opportunities to shine! While you're busy mad she's probably going off with the satisfaction of making you mad. So just brush it off and keep playing ball!!

wum4X78maa	Well John Morrison & The Miz are World Tag Team Champions.<br>  Carlito & Primo Colon are WWE Tag Team Champions.<br>  CM Punk is Intercontinental Champion.<br>  Shelton Benjamin is United States Champion.<br>  Melina is Womens Champion.<br>  Maryse is WWE Divas Champion.<br>  Jack Swagger is ECW Champion. <br>  Triple H is WWE Champion.<br>  And Edge is World Heavyweight Champion.<br>                      Rivalries<br>  Well Undertaker and Shawn Michaels is shaping up to be a good rivalry although it could end at WrestleMania 25.<br>  Randy Orton has punted Vince McMahon, and Shane McMahon.<br>  and has RKOd Stephenie McMahon. Which led to Triple H coming in and chasing Randy Orton and his faction Legacy (Cody Rhodes and Ted Dibiase) with a sledgehammer and nearly taking Randy's head off. Randy announced this past week on Raw that he was gonna take on the World Heavyweight Champion at WrestleMania 25 for his choice since he won the Royal Rumble. Then Triple H came out while Randy Orton was protected with about 10 security guards. And Triple H told him that he needed to face him at WrestleMania 25 because of what he did to him 5 years ago after he won the World Heavyweight Championship and kicked him out of Evoulution. Randy said he would take him on under one condition if he dosen't touch him until WrestleMania 25 unless physically provoked. So Triple H agreed and when Triple H was leaving Randy Orton started saying how good it felt to punt Vince & Shane McMahon in the face. And how good it felt when he slammed Stephanie McMahon down to the mat with an RKO. Then Triple H came back to the ring and got in Randy's face and told him the last time they fought he broke his colarbone this time he's going to break his neck.So on Smackdown when Triple H was in a match with Umaga.Randy Orton and Legacy struck and attacked Triple H well Triple H was physically provoked so every chance he got he went full force at Randy Orton he didn't care about the other two. But eventually Triple H got to worn down to fight anymore and Randy Orton just kept kicking Triple H in the face until he passed out in the ring.Edge is kinda in a three way rivalry with Big Show and John Cena. On Raw this past week Edge gave John Cena a rematch for the World Heavyweight Championship which Edge won at No Way Out when he snuck into the Raw Elimination Chamber by taking Kofi Kingston out. Well on Raw Edge got himself disqualified on Raw by hitting John Cena with the World Heavyweight title. And Vickie came out and announced that Big Show is the #1 contender for the World Heavyweight Championship at WrestleMania 25. So they had the contract signing for that match on Smackdown last night. Where Edge accused Vickie of having an affair with Big Show but Vickie & Show both announced that their relationship was strictly professional although Big Show said Vickie maybe we should tell him and Big Show said Edge you're not a very good champion you take shortcuts and get by by the skin of your teeth. Then John Cena came out and kicked Big Show in the nudz and hit him with the World Heavyweight Championship. Then Edge tried to Spear Cena but Cena moved out of the way and Edge hit the steel post then Cena hit Edge with a table that was in the ring and knocked him out of the ring. Then Cena went over to Edge's "wife" Vickie Guerrero the GM of Smackdown and interem GM of Raw and whispered something in her ear. And when Edge and Vickie got back to the dressing room and Edge said give me the contract to face Cena and I'll sign it then Vickie said they'll have it on Raw and she broke out in tears and started crying and told Edge to leave her alone for a minute. So it looks like Edge vs. John Cena vs. Big Show at WrestleMania 25 for the World Heavyweight Championship. Then there's a great rivalry brewing between Matt Hardy & Jeff Hardy. Jeff won the WWE championship at Armageddon in December in a Triple Threat match. It was Triple H vs. Edge vs. Jeff Hardy and Jeff won with a Swanton Bomb on Edge. And at Royal Rumble after Matt lost his ECW Championship match Jeff had his match after that later in the night. And it looked like Jeff would win the match it was Jeff Hardy vs. Edge and Jeff had Swanton Bombed Edge and the referee counted to 2 and Vickie Guerrero came down and pulled the ref out of the ring when he was gonna count to 3 then Matt came in the ring and scared the heck out of Vickie then Jeff got 2 chairs and they were gonna con chairto Edge while Jeff was settin Edge's face on a chair Matt had a chair and when Jeff came up Matt knocked him out. Then Matt requested his release from ECW and wanted to move to Smackdown. And on Smackdown Matt said he was tired of taking the blame for Jeff's actions and said he no longer had a brother. Then 1week after that Matt came down to the ring while Jeff was having a match with Edge and gave him a Twist of Fate. Jeff won by DQ then Edge Speared a defensless Jeff Hardy. Matt said he wanted a match with Jeff the following week. Well Matt came out ready to go but Jeff c|`|bexN2lbvaa	wwe tag team champs-primo(carlito's brother) and carltio<br>  world tag team-miz and morrison<br>  divas champion(new title)-maryse<br>  womens-melina<br>  wwe champion-triple hhh<br>  world heviyweight- edge<br>  ecw-jack swagger(a new homo)<br>  us-shelton benjamin<br>  interconital-cm punk<br>  <br>  batista is injured untill june<br>  evan bourne(new high flyer)- coming back soon<br>  <br>  new rivals-<br>  jeff hardy and matt hardy(matts an @ssh0le)<br>  edge and big show<br>  undertaker and hbk<br>  mike knox and rey mysterio<br>  randy orton and hhh<br>  mvp(turned heels) and shelton<br>  beth and melina<br>  michelle and maria<br>  primo/carlito and miz/morrison<br>  john cena and edge<br>  mcmahons and randy orton

Statistically speaking, Collins may not be much better, but he is the better of the two. And Fayetteville coach Tom Stewart has played hockey before - 10 years in Canadian major junior and various minor league teams and coached for 7 years more at the SPHL/AHL2 level.

5EuOTAjJaa	1. The Glory of Their Times.<br>  2. The Last Nine Innings. <br>  3. Eight Men Out.<br>  4. Bill James 1986 Historical Baseball Abstract.<br>  5. Bill James 2009 Goldmine. ( Has things in it about baseball that you won't find anywhere else.<br>  6. Palmer's: The Hidden Game.<br>  You read these and you will have a grasp on baseball that will amaze your friends.<br>  Enjoy!!|`|tvuhGTD9aa	I don't know about "best of all time", because there have been many, many good to great baseball books, and I have read only a small fraction of them. However, here's a list of five that I would recommend... and I will state that the #1 book probably would fit a "best of all time" category.<br>  <br>  <br>  1. The Glory Of Their Times, Lawrence Ritter -- absolutely great book, oral histories by men, mostly lesser names, who played the game in the early part of the last century. Any serious baseball fan has this one on the shelf.<br>  <br>  2. Pretty much anything by Bill James, but for more texture and less stats or analysis, go with either edition of his Historical Baseball Abstract (they are very different books).<br>  <br>  3. Moneyball, Michael Lewis -- pay attention to the title; it is NOT a book about OBP or anything so simplistic. It is about how one team, Oakland, and its GM, used market analysis to find players who were underappreciated playing assets, and acquired them for cheap. It's a lesson in how to run a team cost-effectively, while also being a lot about baseball.<br>  <br>  4. The Curse Of The Bambino, Dan Shaugnessy -- the curse is broken and buried, long may it lie, but if you want to know more about the Red Sox, their history, and how there was more than enough evidence to point in the direction that Selling Ruth Was The Stupidest Deal In History (and therefore deserving of being put under an evil spell), this one spells it out.<br>  <br>  5. The Dickson Baseball Dictionary, Paul Dickson -- even noticed how much specialized lingo baseball has? (Granted, this is true of almost any profession.) Wondered where some of them came from? This one has all the definitions, etymology, and background you could ever want -- except for "bullpen". Even Dickson couldn't definitively trace that one.|`|DxiltRSEaa	Im a big fan of books written by players/coaches about their careers or a certain point in their career. For example: I enjoyed josh hamiltons book because it talked about where he came from and what he went through to get back into baseball. Jose canseco's book because he gave out so much info on steroids when it first became known in baseball and also some private points in his life like madonna and clubs. Finally i am currently reading Jor Torres book and it is really interesting because there is a lot of behind the scenes stuff about the Yanks that I never knew. Talks a lot about the players.|`|i0Exuxi2aa	Well I can't think of 5, but Longball was pretty good. I am planning to read The Yankee Years. My friends told me the book is pretty good. So if you're a Yankee fan, maybe you can read the book.|`|14hGf7Glaa	i dont read books but when i have to, i choose baseball books. a great book to read is called "the heart of a champion". great book you really should read if you like baseball|`|zsvDuHfEaa	well i just got finished reading longball<br>  its pretty good

KzlyHEgraa	They are going to have to give up scholarships and may have to forfeit up to 14 wins. I'm not shure but i think it might also make them not bowl eligable.

Familiarizing yourself and working out the kinks and little nuances.  The remaining part of the days before the fight involve some sparring, but more focus and meditation before the fight.

phJC77pWaa	It's a mental thing. You have to prepare yourself to play and be a part of the game mentally so when you do come in off the bench, you'll be ready.  It doesn't matter who you play with or one player being better than another.|`|u2QhQAxzaa	True, True...|`|sOae9LUzaa	Look at this this way:<br>  <br>  Marbury has more to lose. If he ticks of Boston, he gets released and no job. Not to mention, he comes back from not even playing, so any chance he'd get he will cherish. Not to mention, a ring is usually the best cure for an ego the size of his head.<br>  <br>  AI has been playing as an All-Star ever since he played basketball. And now h'es getting "downgraded" to a bench player? Even though it's better having him come off the bench, he loses his All-Star status and becomes more of a role player or secondary contributer to the team, which is something his ego can't stand.|`|408da6bb55ad956c4a3f27375faa6ee5aa	Well I  think it's b/c ai has to let go of his ego. But if he comes of the bench then the pistons will be deadly cuz the bench Is more defensive nd ai is offensive nd wants things to created over him. So thts the perfect matchup.|`|ieKpuccPaa	Well Allen Iverson already told the press that he doesn't have a problem coming off the bench. All he wants is a championship ring.|`|16846f69e9f2c7715f01b43ed1707e57aa	I don't understand, didn't Iverson already say that he doesn't mind coming off of the bench and all he wants is a championship.|`|AGk5gGOtaa	rondo is way better than stuckey|`|YjoNncI7aa	Yeah, I agree with you.

63c199397a307505e128e69aead4d08daa	Call your friend's mobil #, and when he/she answers you ask where he/she is. This works pretty good for me. Sometimes when I use "reverse look up" for a phone number it will say the # belongs to a cell phone, and it will list the community where the phone is located. That's all I know.

iUd7LmM6aa	Serving- to find out who serves first you say p or d (located on the bottom of your racket) or m or w depends on your racket. then you spin your racket and which ever letter it is and who said that letter serves first.<br>  <br>  You switch off serving every game.<br>  <br>  Playing- Every odd game you switch sides on the court with who you are playing.  For example, after your first game you will switch sides because 1 (your first game) is an odd number.<br>  <br>  Scoring- No add is if it is 40 40 between you and who you are playing you dont do advantages.<br>  For example- Your score is 40 to 40 instead of scoring how you usually do, you just play one point to determine who wins that game.<br>  <br>  I hope this helps!!!|`|NUqJVWFJaa	1.  You can flip a coin or use your tennis racquet to determine who serves, they will serve until someone wins 1 game.<br>  <br>  2.  You switch sides at every odd game.<br>  <br>  3.  Adds are at deuces, you will have to win the deuce and then the next point.<br>  <br>  4.  Lets say you just won a game, so the score is 3-2 you switch when someone has an odd number.<br>  <br>  5.When your opponents are serving someones at the back, when someone wins a point you will have to move up and your partner moves back.<br>  <br>  Tips:  You will have to win 2 sets to win, you win a set by winning 6 games.|`|n87q9plgaa	u always start the 1 serve of every game on the right side and u switch sides on every odd game also if u r playing dobbles and the oppent is serving then if u r on the right side u go back if on the left u go on the service line then after point u go back and partner comes u then if u or partner r serving u start on right and partner is at net then just go to the left side then ur partner goes to the net on right side
NSKimt1Qaa	Give it time.  You'll be up to where you were last year, maybe even better.  Running on a treadmill is different than running outside.<br>  On a treadmill, the ground is being pulled underneath your feet and there's no wind resistance. Running outdoor is harder because you're propelling your body forward stride for stride. Many treadmills are padded and decrease the impact. Did you have your treadmill set at least a 1% incline to better simulate outdoor running?  Don't feel defeated.  You'll soon be conditioned to outdoor running again.|`|BB6HGbnPaa	This one is easy. Because your running on a treadmill. Treadmill is fine for runners of they need to keep in shape during a week vacation or something. Treadmill is just you running in pace for how ever long you run. Outside running requires you to use force to push off your leg and move forward. While treadmill is you running in pace and basically jumping up and down. If its winter and you cant go outside, try finding like a indoor basketball gym or a indoor track and run there.

(I'm a bengals fan).|`|AA12103453	If that gets you through the day man that's cool. I'm a Steelers fan and actually some of the other "fans" annoy me too, so I can't say TOO much against your comment.|`|X8NGHSP8aa	Matt, reread you additional details sentence. Do you really believe that? So using this assumption the refs got away with cheating for the Steelers 15 times last year (the number of games the Steelers won) and no one questioned it? Excuse me, but I find that a little hard to accept. I get you don't like the Steelers and us fans, I have no problem with that you have the right to your opinion. Making statements like the one you made is a poor reflection on you not the Steeler faithful.|`|qo0kKtvpaa	I guess you are a Pats fan, considering you hate the Jets.<br>  <br>  I honestly don't see why people hate the Steeler nation. I have been a fan of Pittsburgh for over 30 years, and I always will be. I guess you hate the Steelers because they won more superbowls that the patriots? Or...because they had one of the greatest defenses all time, back in the 70's? Or because you think they are "PAYING THE REFS SO THEY CAN WIN THE SUPER BOWL"?<br>  <br>  Just give up, dude.<br>  <br>  <br>  Six Burgh: Dude, you are just giving us Steelers fans a bad rap. Calm down. Patriots will win their division next year. Easily.|`|PVe6jK78aa	Steelers fans and Eagles fans are the New Jersey Devils fans of the NFL. Im not jealous of **** im a pats fan. Steelers can only win a superbowl if they don't have to play the patriots.|`|J1kJb98Maa	jealous much
gig3gjOmaa	haha i noticed that too, an yeah i like you name its kind of like a... funny wrestling name isnt it?|`|q0WOUFoRaa	Thats true. Their wrestling also goes crapper and their voices become boring. (Chris Jericho: Because of you...... Because of you.....)|`|R4dXxh6paa	what????|`|5lLLDK4Laa	I never really noticed it.<br>  <br>  BQ: Yeah.. it's hilarious... (wow, what a poor choice of words)|`|9x1w6Tg0aa	LOL true and they also blame it on the crowd and talk about selves EX y2j and matt hardy|`|95uXmC94aa	:O ZOMGGGGG AND THEN THERE IS MARYSE. ;) haha yeah it's sort of how you determine which ones which ;) I like it.
im8xN545aa	It would certainly make it more interesting and less batsman friendly. Also I suppose it would really sort the good players from the average (and poor) ones.<br>  <br>  I'm not sure it would work though, play is difficult on uncovered pitches, and as someone said, it might mean a return to low scoring games. Though the other side of that argument would be that low scoring games don't matter as long as they're competitive (and with the improvement in pitch preparation low scoring might not be a problem).<br>  <br>  Something does need to be done about the competitive nature of the game though. There are too many draws and high scoring games that go nowhere (as evidenced by the England/West Indies and the first Test between Pakistan and Sri Lanka) so perhaps uncovered pitches would make the game more exciting to watch.<br>  <br>  There is one major problem (ignoring the aforementioned issue about the low scoring, as that can be worked around) I can see with reverting back to uncovered pitches though. English weather conditions are not conducive to it. If there was a heavy downfall during the night then, potentially, it would be like playing on a soggy beach.<br>  <br>  Because of that there would be an unfair balance between the pitches here and the pitches in other places in the world that don't get as much adverse weather conditions as we do (as Joey pointed out, there would be far too much variability).<br>  <br>  With that in mind perhaps uncovered pitched aren't the way to go after all but it might be an interesting experiment nonetheless.|`|SWxnbKyyaa	Actually I wouldnt mind it as long as the pitch doesnt get damaged because of being left uncovered.I love to see bowlers dominate|`|mber3JoAaa	Too much variability on that I think. Personally I'd prefer to see a rule that pitches must have a certain amount of time with the sprinklers on after stumps each day.|`|ms0eYsD5aa	no one will come to watch the game|`|n13rCdZtaa	Uncovered in certain counties would be OK i.e Caribbean. But it would make games unplayable in others, for example England.|`|e2725e139f2ef6cf9a64c700251f9601aa	This should be tried  at  a  lower level first.|`|xPaXWSLLaa	Meh heh eh heh heh ...why not play in the rain at night? That would make it really interesting.|`|f9hiPMDxaa	Bowlers would love it, maybe not batsmen though. It may be worth a thought when you consider the scores from the recent WI v England games andthe Pakistan Sri Lanka games and the high scoring there.|`|NR4hbYPiaa	You really want to go back to the days when Test teams struggled to make 200 in a days play?<br>  If you're having trouble sleeping perhaps a doctor may be able to help.
im8xN545aa	As the first answerer said, Wikipedia should not really be used to gather primary information for anything. As a secondary source perhaps it's a little better, especially if you can find something else to back it up. <br>  <br>  But, overall, it just can't be trusted as it's so unreliable. Here's why:<br>  <br>  * Anyone can edit it including people who have no knowledge of the subject.<br>  * It's often edited by cranks and people who are severely biased towards the topic, place, person or whatever.<br>  * The sources quoted are often themselves unreliable, out of date or suspect.<br>  * You often have to check the facts some place else to make sure they're correct.<br>  <br>  Now can it be a trusted source for information about cricket? Well yes and (mostly) no. Again here's why:<br>  <br>  Yes:<br>  * There's a group called Wikipedia:WikiProject Cricket and they endevour to make the cricket articles as accurate as possible. It has some extremely good members who know what they're talking about. It's here if you're interested: <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:WikiProject_Cricket" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:W...</a><br>  * A lot of the information and stats are sourced from more reliable places.<br>  * The sources are mostly good.<br>  * Articles are backed up with information from proper news sources, agencies and more reliable cricket sites.<br>  <br>  No:<br>  * Because of the reasons I first stated about Wikipedia as a whole.<br>  * Wikipedia:WikiProject Cricket has some morons as members who know naff all about cricket. Some think just because they're a fan of a player it gives them carte blanche to write whatever the hell they want to boost their favourite players standing. Some of them are extremely biased (and it's often difficult trying to make your mind up which users can be trusted).<br>  * Because of that you'll often find a page that is very poorly written and put together.<br>  * The stats are sometimes slow to be updated so you have to go to Cricinfo (or whoever) to get more up to the date ones.<br>  * Sometimes the stats are wrong and you have to check Cricinfo or Statsguru to make sure Wikipedia is right. Ok mostly the wrong stats on Wikipedia are usually only out by a tiny amount but for someone who loves stats it's annoying.<br>  * As that article states Wikipedia is prone to mindless vandalism. Just watch the Australian cricketers pages (for example) over the course of a week and see what comes up. Before Matthew Hayden retired his was probably the number one target, now it's probably Ricky Ponting's page.<br>  <br>  As you can see the negatives far outweigh the positives and the material found on Wikipedia is always highly subjective and should not really be taken as a reliable source for anything, never mind cricket.|`|8T0Z0Y17aa	I'm sure there are discrepances. If I need statistics on a player, I will use cricinfo to be sure. But for finding out about a players actual life events, I find Wikipedia is a decent source. After all, that's where I got the answer to your trivia question the other day about the 19th Century cricketer's grave (I forget his name!). The example you give is obviously an act of vandalism. As with anything, you need to think about what you read and determine whether it is true for yourself.|`|SWxnbKyyaa	I have been told by many wiki need not always be correct,since like many said anyone can edit it<br>  <br>  A lot of facts that are mentioned sometimes need proof which may not be given.Those are the ones where you see "citation needed".<br>  <br>  Regarding cricket, its been okay, atleast pertaining to some non-controversial issues|`|jUjkvis8aa	Wikipedia isn't a trusted source to gather information about ANYTHING|`|r5Lqi2cMaa	Wikipedia can be used as a starting reference when gathering information. The problem is that anyone can write the articles published on the website, regardless of their level of expertise. Therefore it should never be used as a 100% reliable source of information. <br>  <br>  For a topic such as cricket it's probably alright though.|`|kLK2peV1aa	i believe wikipedia is a trusted site, love it, use it, and i think it should be accepted on college term papers as a reliable source.|`|yab6j7vaaa	Wikipedia is useful but you cannot trust it because anybody can post on it. There are loads of so called 'facts'that are just not true!  If it's essential for you to get accurate info, you're best to look somewhere else!|`|tf2rU7xCaa	Wikipedia can be edited by anyone, and that fact makes it an unreliable source. If you find some info on wiki, check the citations.|`|7hmjTUubaa	It is usually but regarding controversial or debated topics it can be altered by biased people. All in all i'd say its fairly reliable|`|fsLMFIpgaa	I used to take it as I found it, but since hearing several people's opinion on the matter I no longer entirely trust it.|`|5GUjFJjkaa	BA to 1st answer.
H3nbC71eaa	It's a sad situation, as Verne has alzheimer's...he didn't realize what he was doing when that happened. This is nothing to blame Verne for, it's just a tragic situation that occured by a man with a mental disorder.|`|BlgZmV6uaa	It is a sad story.If you know anybody who has this disease it is hard to see.The short term memory is just gone.Neither of the two remembered what happened.The nursing home some will say is to blame but they can not watch everybody 24/7.It would be cost prohibited.Just a sad way for both men to spend their final days.Anybody for that matter.|`|J9GWbyAvaa	Verne is an elderly man suffering from Alzheimer's.<br>  Its a sad situation all away around.|`|NLJ33Nkeaa	Final Battle|`|USF8xNfhaa	Well as he has mentally ill with alt it has to considered as such a tragedy|`|smcDn76jaa	This is terribly tragic. Hopefully both families can handle this and find a peaceful way to settle this. I don't think Gagne should be held account for this.

oqQjnpfGaa	Eric Gordon could be back as soon as today (Saturday). <br>  <br>  His shoulder injury might affect his game, so it is not a safe bet that he'll produce for you (especially with his shooting).  <br>  <br>  On the other hand, Robinson (Nate) has a good chance to play today as well, but his game could be tentative because of his injury (sprained ankle).  Hopefully, they both take it easy and won't aggravate their injuries.<br>  <br>  Good Luck!|`|wNSWVsYoaa	idk put in the b,ball section & you'll get more answers

OfNTLq3Qaa	I missed Smackdown last night but if it happened like you said then I agree. Not that I am doubting what you say, like i said I have not seen it yet.|`|R4dXxh6paa	I think if anything he way OVERsold it.... I think he way overdid the drama|`|ULSUqmeZaa	First of all, he had to get beatdown for 10 minutes because the segment ended up being that long. Legacy was supposed to attack after the match but Umaga got hurt and the beatdown became longer. He had to do something to drag the segment till the end of the show or he would have gotten beat up even more.<br>  Secondly, we all know he can take Rhodes and Dibiasi by himself. He was after Orton the whole time. He isn't a bad actor, he needed to do something to get the show to end on time and end the way it was planned to end.<br>  Orton didn't punt him because if he did, then he doesn't get a title shot at WM. This match is going to happen at WM.|`|jXAbTovcaa	Not really a wrestling fan but HHH is a jerk
qVDY1hm5aa	You just answered my question about the Punk/JBL 'feud'. I'm a little upset since Kennedy has been really unlucky with injuries. I was hoping he'd make it to MiTB but since he's hasn't been medically cleared I hope MVP or John Morrison will win it. It's a shame, I'm a big fan of Kennedy. Hopefully, he comes back bigger, better, stronger and hungrier for some gold.|`|qo0kKtvpaa	How do you know it is confirmed? Nothing is ever confirmed for WM. Plans always change.<br>  <br>  I say he will make a surprise return in the MITB.|`|OHBvEYKHaa	poopie|`|LVrH8W57aa	spoilers sites can kiss my backside.<br>  seriously , wait and see and get shocked.<br>  and even if it wont be JBL vs Kennedy, can it be Kennedy vs someone else, like idk, maybe Kennedy vs Rey Misterio|`|9NRyeif9aa	This is actually Dissapointing because i was expecting for Kennedy to return at WM25 too.but i guess we hoped too much.well all i can say is ''MVP should win the MITB'' because my money's on him now. Go MVP!|`|BlgZmV6uaa	I was hopeing for his return as well.|`|R4dXxh6paa	OH DARN!!!!|`|db7e40dd5354decef471fb1fb7b3d134aa	Here are there plans for Wrestlemania:<br>  <br>  Undertaker vs. Shawn Michaels, with Taker going 17-0 at WM<br>  <br>  Triple H vs. Randy Orton for the WWE Title<br>  <br>  Edge vs. The Big Show vs. John Cena for the World Heavyweight Title<br>  <br>  Some surprises in the MITB ladder match, as Kane, Mark Henry are rumored to be in the match. Kennedy, CM Punk, MVP, Shelton Benjamin, Miz, Morrison are all good possibilities too.<br>  <br>  The Hardyz are expected to have a match<br>  <br>  a 25 Diva Battle Royal is scheduled, and have contacted many former Divas to take part such as Jackie Gayda, Sunny, Mae Young, Lita, Trish Stratus, among others,.<br>  <br>  Jack Swagger vs. Tommy Dreamer for the ECW Title has also been talked about, but Christian may be used instead of Dreamer<br>  <br>  I was notified late last night that there has been some informal dialogue between Hulk Hogan and WWE about the possibility of him working a match at WrestleMania. However, no creative plans have been made. Hogan reportedly pitched the idea of working a match against John Cena. <br>  <br>  Stone Cold has also been rumored working a match against Hulk Hogan, but Hogan has had back issued recently and may be unable to work. Austin is prominently featured in WrestleMania 25 advertisements so I think he will at least appear on the show, the night after he is inducted into the WWE Hall of Fame. <br>  <br>  <br>  Plans for Chris Jericho are still up in the air but i was told it will involve the angle with the legends. Mickey Rourke vs. Jericho was obviously the plan a couple of weeks ago but there has been concern from both Rourke and WWE about how it would go over. WWE officials are said to be concerned that it would be too big of a risk.<br>  <br>  Melina vs. Beth Pheonix looks likely for the Women's championship, but they may not have that on the card. Something involving Maryse/McCool may happen too. <br>  <br>  JBL was also scheduled win the IC title from CM Punk in the coming weeks, but due to the script being leaked, that may now have changed, but JBL was planned to make history by having the IC defended at WM<br>  <br>  These are the plans as of now, but Vince has been described as being "obsessed" with keeping things from leaking (see No Way out - using a curtain over the chamber pre=show to prevent knowledge of Edge being in both chambers) Plus plans change all the time, but these are what are known now.<br>  <br>  Hope this helps

Just be careful who you get friendly with over the Internet. It's a shame that it has to be this way but it is. I hope you can find a buddy from your neighbor or school that would love to go fishing.

pSOmwwlIaa	Don't know. I think maybe GOL TV since they passed the SUB 20 of Sudamerica. Or just browse through the all the sports channels or check out justin.tv.<br>  <br>  Mexico 3-0 Costa Rica<br>  <br>  I honestly think this is gonna happen. Mexico has the best forward and a very good defense, but their midfield is kind of wack. But Mexico wins this match like walking in a park.|`|qbPbvLuLaa	No idea|`|Cpm25Pekaa	Not sure|`|eWadjRfpaa	If you have Direct tv.<br>  Just browse through all the sport channels.<br>  Or they might pass it by Justin.tv|`|3Qh73CjZaa	No one really cares !|`|KUDM3Q4Uaa	I doubt they'll televise it<br>  Cause its a sub game
xRQfCdKOaa	He should go to the Patriots and play opposite of Moss. Bellicheck can handle Moss he can handle T.O. Could you imagine defenses trying to stop them,|`|KzlyHEgraa	Not the Raiders or the 49ers they wont win a super bowl before he retires and that's what he wants. One that no one expects him to end up with. The Ravens or Titans. Super bowl contenders with money to spend.|`|Bl7jzSSwaa	wherever he goes he wont last long. after a couple of years the team will release or trade him.|`|1b1e96c4e15d62fb35f5036b2b08dc6caa	No doubt either<br>  <br>  1. Raiders<br>  2. 49ers<br>  <br>  ..He will go to a West Coast team.|`|8x8FIm9zaa	Hopefully nowhere.  He is a major distraction to the NFL and makes the product and everyone he is associated with look bad.  I hate the Cowboys but I think it is the best decision they have made in a while.  I am also happy for Romo, he doesn't have that pressure of having to get the ball to ONE  guy and can spread the ball around now.  Owens didn't help the Cowboys do anything, they didn't win ONE playoff game, haven't since '96.  And yes I know he wasn't the one that bobbled the hold on an extra point in a playoff game (Romo), but I can honestly say now I believe the Cowboys are a legitimant playoff team and Super Bowl contender.|`|tWMF1PuSaa	teams that need better reicevers are the jets titans chiefs but terell owens should go to the bears or just be a free agent other possible teams are the lions broncos or browns he might join jets theres a lot of choices for t.o hes a good wide reicever  98 percent chance he will play on a team he has about 7 teams he could join but the cowboys made a stupid choice relasing him hey cowboys fans they suck! theyll be 0-16 next year what ever team t.o goes to theyll be 11-5 12-4 maybe even 13-3 no super bowl ofcourse steelers will win that t.o has 7 teams to choose he will choose the right one|`|a39133ce04b0c6ccf1f9835291dcbd58aa	who cares?  he's an ****** and a cancer.  he's proven MY opinion THREE times already with the 49ers, Eagles and finally the Cowboys.  NOBODY wants that cancer.|`|J3LHdhQeaa	He is in deep talks with the Redskins and Raiders.|`|M2UoFbZ5aa	Jaguars|`|a8d41yH1aa	Oakland, or San Francisco.|`|8EEJJpK9aa	skins|`|qo0kKtvpaa	My first pick was the Raiders...but as someone said, they won't win a super bowl. I will go with Minnesota. I don't think they can win the SB, but atleast they should get to the playoffs.|`|NWOKZKzOaa	Pats
cGOBkGwwaa	i don't think i know...the steelers, it already happened.<br>  haha sorry bad wording on this question this years superbowl is passed. NEXT YEAR however, i'm gonna go out on a limb and pick denver.|`|PVe6jK78aa	gotta love the collective maturity of the steelers fans. Patriots win the super bowl sealing the discussion of the team of the decade for good.|`|Ti0q1Btiaa	You missed it this year. Steelers.<br>  <br>  Wait till next year.|`|bwibB9Cnaa	The Patriots are roaring back this season. With Brady at the helm again, they have reclaimed Dominance. On D the pats are run by Mayo who is one hell of a player, he really impressed me. And Meriweather is only gettin better.<br>  <br>  Pats go 13-3 Win Super Bowl. Brady SB MVP #3<br>  Brady:Comeback Player of the Year BTW|`|3oUSroiZaa	New England Patriots!<br>  <br>  <br>  Edit:Yeah the Pats are going to win another superbowl.<br>  <br>  The only way the steelers can win is if the refs cheat for them.|`|qo0kKtvpaa	It will be either the Patriots or the Steelers.|`|8x8FIm9zaa	New England Patriots<br>  <br>  Six Burgh, how can you say the Pats will never win another Super Bowl?  You obviously know nothing about football do you?  Patriots won 11 games last year.  Oh by the way, that was with Brady, and 7 starters, 3 All Pros on the IR.  Pittsburgh is damn lucky the Pats didn't make the playoffs rather than those 8 win teams that did.  And just so you know, your all mighty man Bill Cowher said the same thing in the playoffs, that NO ONE wanted to play the Patriots and it was a relief.|`|J3LHdhQeaa	the Vikings.<br>  <br>  i think if they can pick up or draft a WR. we will have a sharp offence.<br>  are defence is gonna be young in the secondary so look for lots of big plays.<br>  <br>  if they keep it study they can pull it off|`|Bl7jzSSwaa	u really cant answer that until after the free agent signing period is over and after the draft. that way u know who is going where|`|xRQfCdKOaa	Vikings vs. Colts. Vikings winning.|`|tVqS4jxsaa	Chargers or Steelers|`|KzlyHEgraa	Falcons. They have all the talent to do it.
JLz6Qz4Paa	I would go with an American Gas Eagle, Airsoft Spring Sniper Rifles, and an airsoft UZI.|`|AA10056762	There is no best.
a8d41yH1aa	Steelers, the Steelers have had their number the last 3 years, and the Ravens are getting older, so I think the Steelers should win. Shutting out the Ravens 24-0 in their first meeting, and depending on what happens I would say they beat them 28-0 the second time.|`|7RziqsDcaa	Ravens won 0 of their 3 games against the Steelers this year.|`|3oUSroiZaa	Ravens win.|`|qo0kKtvpaa	Game 1:<br>  <br>  Steelers: 24<br>  Ravens: 23<br>  <br>  Steelers win with a FG as time expires<br>  <br>  Game 2:<br>  <br>  Steelers: 14<br>  Ravens: 10|`|Bl7jzSSwaa	they will split the 2 games. with each winning on the road. and they will meet again in the playoffs. with the steelers winning easily. that way everybody can say the refs helped them cheat.|`|YBX6C8GVaa	Steelers- 20<br>  Ravens- 17|`|mUSs0lyaaa	how about when the fans go at it. RAVENS FANS WILL KILL!
LHgPMwtLaa	Recently, they've began to turn it around with Alvin Gentry behind the bench. With Terry Porter, they attempted to play a more defensive game, but it didn't work because all of their personnel were suited to run and gun, especially after Steve Kerr traded their two best defenders(Boris Diaw and Raja Bell) for a fast break guy(Jason Richardson).|`|022f1c3b90d1d4ff6e3967675d1ff3b1aa	Well, they've been trading their good players for Mediocre players, and they've mixed big slow players with run and gun players, and they no longer have Mike D'Antoni as their coach. The team has some major issues.|`|G0pCxzgpaa	Ever since they got rid of D'antony (coach) and got shaq they can't run the ball like they used to. They have slowed down the tempo a little and it gives teams time to get back on D|`|VDGdyHskaa	because they dont have good basketball players other then amarie shaq is ok and the other guy they need better drafts
eff556e68b639b40e89cc7516013482faa	Yes, I have a pool, but I live alone. And, so far, I'm the only one who's ever been in my pool. I don't have enough noodles to rack. I store mine in the loft of my gazebo. That is a cute idea, though.|`|AA11136470	nope--don't have a pool. always wanted one but then we would have to buy & install a fence. too much $ & work.|`|E76or3sYaa	Nope I don't have a swimming pool.<br>  <br>  x
6sTsDvKmaa	Easiest: Sideflip<br>  Middle: Backflip<br>  Hardest: Frontflip|`|9w6ObK2waa	LIES the hardest is EASILY the backflip since you have to overcome that huge natural barrier OF JUMPING BACKWARDS INTO THE AIR WITHOUT SEEING WHATS HAPPENING AND RISK BREAKING YOUR NECK.<br>  <br>  Scary right? Thats what your brain thinks too. I couldn't do it, though i dind't try very hard and i learnt how to frontflip no sweat. Never tried side flips but this doesn't seem as hard as backflips or as easy as the front ones so this is how it really  goes:<br>  <br>  Hardest: B-flip<br>  Easiest: F-flip<br>  Probably middle: Sideflip
LIKkt8djaa	Wax it and don't scrape off the excess wax, That'll help prevent the base from drying out. Another tip is to keep it somewhere flat and not standing up.|`|GWoW1o5oaa	wax the board before storage.  You don;t need to scrape it off, just apply the wax as a protector.  Store the board in a board bag.  beginning of next season, finish the wax job.|`|CidxR8ONaa	Try waxing it, then storage.  When winter rolls around, you can wax it again, try it out, and it should be fine.|`|Z42d3oW9aa	ride it
XDgU1cVFaa	They are somewhat valuable.  They could be considered collector's item.  But there are still many of them circulating today, they can't be sold for a lot of money.  Ebay still have many listing of wooden rackets -> <a href="http://shop.ebay.com/?_from=R40&_trksid=m38.l1313&_nkw=wood+tennis+racket&_sacat=See-All-Categories" rel="nofollow">http://shop.ebay.com/?_from=R40&_trksid=...</a>  :)|`|Kzhu4bkMaa	Maybe they are, or will be a few years down the line, but don't try playing with them, or else their value will drop.
AA10056762	The UTG is actually halfway decent and upgradable if you choose. Well cant make a bolt action. Their quality control is terrible. So you have a chance that you might get one that works well but you never know.
gVJJi2Adaa	Red wings|`|V8yR8BU1aa	Calgary Flames|`|XuGFt3boaa	I think San Jose will get the job done and win it all.|`|9f7c3a6b1c85a2b25fdaadcc6f4cc32aaa	I am sure I will get spanked by the regulars but the Red Wings have to be the favorites. I am not taking the "homer" stance, I am being practical based on what I see. They are as deep as ever and have an offense that creates incredible pressure all game long. They have shown an uncanny ability to shut down other the other teams top line during the playoffs and Babcock seems to find a way to attack any form of defense. The Sharks are the flavor of the year and I really like the makeup of that team but much like Turco, Nabbie struggles pretty badly against the Wings (7-15 with just shy of a 4.00 GAA). And the Wings have destroyed him at the Joe and right now the Wings are sitting perfectly with home ice advantage. Now that being said I dont think that is a lock, we all know anything can happen and I also love the coaching change made in San Jose. I do think those 2 teams stand heads above the rest of the west right now.<br>    As for the east that is a tougher call but with the successful return of Brodeur the Devils have to be the favorites to emerge from the east. Of the other teams in the east I like the Flyers second best. They have depth like the Wings and can pressure a team for 60 minutes too. How ironic would it be if the Wings and Flyers end up playing for the Cup, both have been criticized for poor goaltending yet it would be hard to argue that they arent capable of winning Lord Stanleys Cup (talk about smacking the face of tradition....great goaltending and defense arent always the way to Cup glory). At the moment I honestly believe that only those 4 teams have a legitimate shot at the Cup and would not be surprised if any of them won it all. But one key injury or one other hot goalie could change everything.<br>  <br>  Wings over the Devils in 7 (but ask me again in a month and who knows)|`|YN8Rbjogaa	Sorry, San Jose and Boston fans, but until someone knocks off Detroit, they're still better than any team in the league. Everyone was so sure Pittsburgh was gonna beat the Wings last year, but I'll take the experience of a veteran team any time! The Wings will repeat, if their goaltending can hold up.|`|RJ5Bevmpaa	The Devils have the most well rounded team, with no holes and lots of leadership. They combine it all better than anyone does right now.|`|85a698321682f836c53e47e71b0045d6aa	Red Wings|`|gI44aIddaa	I am also sure to upset some people, but homerism aside, who can challenge what's already on paper?  The Red Wings have the entire championship roster intact save the addition of Hossa and Conklin, both of whom have impressed me beyond words.  I, like everybody else, think SJS has a good chance but does anybody ever watch them in the playoffs?  They fold, and usually, its against the Wings.<br>  <br>  I see Boston and NJD in the ECF with Boston taking the series 4-2.  They just have too many weapons and their goaltending is as hot as Marty Brodeur has been able to be this season what with plaguing injuries and all.  I think Boston is stronger offensively and defensively as well.|`|Gv0zjQKraa	tough tough tough but like the majority are saying, how can you go against those annoying redwings? You can hate on em, just as I do, but the proof is there and until someone beats em how aren't they the favorites? At the same time i wouldn't be suprised by other match ups. I'd love to see a Boston/Chicago Cup Finals and there is no reason it couldn't happen. Some say San Jose are choke artists but there is something different about this time, no reason they can't get it done. <br>  <br>  The East is more wide open than the West. Detroit, San Jose, and Chicago are above everyone else in the West. So who knows?<br>  <br>  But put me down for Detroit|`|LHgPMwtLaa	Washington<br>  <br>  Great young team, didn't add new pieces, so they've been together all year long, and have guys who can take over a game.<br>  (OVIE, SEMIN, GREEN, BACKTROM, even FEDOROV)|`|IhvRyyxtaa	I like the Red Wings too but am not sure they can get past the Flames.|`|x7NtYD8Aaa	Wings baby!

PoVvFeodaa	Not necessarily. The 70 degree weather may make the run harder and in that respect you will probably burn more calories. However, the amount that you sweat won't make much of a difference. Sweat is mostly just water weight. So if you only sweat a little or if you sweat a lot, most of it will be replaced the next time you drink something.|`|RBQrgByeaa	I tend to think the harder the workout, the more you're burning. The body has to hit calorie reserves when stressed. Heat makes the body stress more, so you burn more calories. In colder weather, you can just wear extra clothes.|`|fPbjSNEHaa	It won't make much difference.<br>  <br>  At 70 degrees your body will sweat more so the body will need to hydrate itself from its stores<br>  <br>  At 30 degrees your body burns energy to heat up the body<br>  <br>  I don't know how to scientically prove which uses up more energy, the difference is probably negligible.|`|mbwKFacIaa	in 70 degree weather . cuz its warmer and makes you sweat more . so you would be burning more
oX2KsnOQaa	if you have to leave to go shoot just buy a ruger 10/22|`|VgUAIvEUaa	your house, garden, any where that you have permission off the land owner|`|5qzndqYQaa	It is only a BB gun you don't have to go to range. If you live with neighbors that are 20 yards away go to your back yard and shoot with a backstop. If you live in the country(out of town) like me you don't really need a back stop unless your in a subdivision.|`|B5RrVk7Taa	In your own house! Seriously. You just have to make certain you have a good backstop. (Actually, that's true outdoors as well). For BB guns, get a large cardboard box, (big enough that you **can't** miss it), lay a rod across the top and hang a heavy cloth from the rod. Since the cloth is hanging loosely the BB doesn't go through it but instead gets wrapped up in the cloth and falls to the bottom of the box. You can reuse the BBs.<br>  I did this with a moderately powerful 22 pellet pistol and a BB gun when I was young. Check the condition of the cloth occasionally, like when you replace the box because there's no cardboard left to tape a target to.<br>  You don't want anything hard because steel BBs ricochet like crazy!|`|9fDRLrzFaa	When ever possible use your .bb gun outside. Make a nice large backstop out of wood and make it large enough. Wear safety glasses so if the .bb Ricochets it won't do any harm to your eyes.<br>  <br>  Have fun, and be safe.

Thank goodness for the over 45 league at the local rink, at least everyone else is encountering the same love/hate with body and mind so we generally play accordingly...though not always (passion can overcome common sense on occasion).|`|Jb5itwHtaa	I hate it.
