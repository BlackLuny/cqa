H5eZ1aZAaa	Well let me start off by saying you sound great, like the type of guy id go for. Women often dont't seperate real ambition from someone just giving you a handout. So im going to say no they don't mean it literally they mean it in a way that fits them. Not the way it really is.|`|mCAWxobNaa	It just means wealthy, nothing more, regrettably.<br>  <br>  The Yahoo! Answers filtration system is weak and doesn't permit completely non-profane things to be written such as the Latin for "with honours."  To make up for this, the brilliant minds of Yahoo! Answers recommend using "c.u.m. laude" as a surrogate for the proper designation.  It's a poor system designed to moderate content with minimal expenditure and virtually no employees to regulate the content going through; instead they use lousy software that cannot discriminate between profanity and appropriate terms.|`|uXqDYPNVaa	I mean it literally, although I prefer a guy who is ambitious about completing a worthwhile body of work, not about money or titles.|`|f6f40965eb7d5df6aa94440ec71e32dcaa	"It doesn't take a lot of ambition to have your daddy put you through school and then inherit the family business"<br>  <br>  Then he wouldn't be ambitious, now would he?  Did it ever occur to you that maybe the women that bang any guy with money aren't the same women that want a man with genuine ambition?  Common sense isn't so common, obviously.<br>  <br>  And yes, it sucks that Yahoo thinks that *** laude is profanity.|`|NV3eIjLcaa	Do parasites care whether their host's good health was attained through arduous personal effort rather then through genetics? -- The answer is no.|`|iRKOJhYeaa	I will have you, come on over!|`|AA11550519	*** Laude-LOL! What ever happened to yahoo's wild west spirit????<br>  <br>  Dude, professing an attraction to ambition is partly true, but mostly a face-saving manouvre. No woman's gonna publicly say they are attracted to men exclusively for money! Unless she IS a ho, golddigger, or mistress, she doesn;t want to be thought of as one.<br>  <br>  Hold the thumbs down-the frat boys with the sexy arm candy are just as shallow! It's just that they don't have to save face. Making excuses for your sexuality is a shamefully wimpish thing to do. Now i'm off to wrestle alligators with the boys......|`|HPqCRBq8aa	Those days are over. Women don't believe in men anymore. So they want the man that already has it all. No matter how he got it. Just as long as they know he has something (tangible). The guy who is honest, bright, hardworking, etc. doesn't have a chance with the majority of women, if it produces little. In short, they are not falling for "The Dream" anymore.|`|8uvLG8Lbaa	Seriously don't be offended. They aren't worth your time, or too drunk to be worth your time. You should make more female friends and learn things about them.|`|c48xLEolaa	Well, you're not "entitled" to a woman, just because you're "ambitious", you have to try and find one. And most of those frat boys will have STDs by now, if it's any consolation...|`|1xDtS8wwaa	This is probably why you can't get a girl.|`|kxcDDMw9aa	Ambitious = $$$|`|pe7ZSlWWaa	You probably never hear much from those guys though because their dads' money can't buy them a cure for AIDS.|`|8ldA7Z3Baa	Because a lot of girls equate a guys ambition and success with what materials they have which to them, physically proves how successful the guy is. Even though the guy may be a dim wit who's only successful because of his families success, but has no ambition and would be nothing without it.<br>  <br>  A lot of girls/women pass up guys who don't have all those things everyday, not realizing that the guy who's 20, working at a shoe store could be very extrememly ambitious. Some guys spend their free time working on ambitious projects that will one day equal a guys success. Only, many girls don't see that.. they only see a random dude in a shoe store.<br>  <br>  It's the same as men who only date the girls who spend 3 hours a day in the mirror getting pretty who have crappy personalities. But they pass up the girls who may appear frumpy at first, but actually are more physically AND mentally beautiful than the barbie dolls, they just never prettied themselves up before.|`|mqTEGbCYaa	You sound like my type of guy. I prefer i guy who works hard for the stuff he wants because that the kind of guy my father is (minus the education) I grew up knowing the value of hard work and education (i  worked full time and i am  going to college. Its my 1st year so i don't want to get loans and my parents don't have money to help me. ) I don't think you should pay much attention to those bimbos. You will find a nice girl one day whose not a bimbo. I also have the same problem in a way. It seems most guys want to date a girl with no brains. Ohh. Those girls probably don't have no brains. HA. So they are perfect with those guys . A idiot deserves and idiot and you are not an idiot.|`|p7MM283Taa	Maybe their disgust with your arrogance overpowers their attraction to your ambition.<br>  <br>  Women are not animals that you can train to be attracted to certain things, answer to certain calls.|`|l77grfgVaa	You sound like a sweetheart LOL not kidding u made me smile =/ Don't get pissed off , nice girls are out there too. U'll find one.
gnDLov31aa	I read somewhere that people didn't actually remember things word for word. They sort of condensed them, only remembering essential details, and then created their own version of the poem/story etc. by 'filling in the blanks'.

el8yX5q3aa	you have a low tolerance level...work on it and realize that people have a right to be there too.|`|9vOBtO1Oaa	I'd say it is not really normal behaviour. But behaviour which I've experienced myself at times, when either frustrated, or wanting to hide from the rest of humanity.<br>  However, I see it in most cases, my lack of giving more room to other people's world as they share e with us, and their habits, rights and lifestyles. So on such frustration laden times, I make a point to stay home and meditate about it.|`|lGNnyaIEaa	I get the same way sometimes.  It is usually not reasonable.  Like someone else stated, you have a very low tolerance level and probably a low need to fit in/be liked.  When you don't care how others perceive you, it's easy to be rude to others.  <br>  <br>  Take a peek at my question!  <a href="http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index;_ylt=ArkvKJcwtd8VSC.vJl1W3ikazKIX;_ylv=3?qid=20090309091858AARvX3z">http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index;...</a>|`|EzcQOTPtaa	You probably need some alone time. A crowded place will not fulfill this need. Find a remote place to relax and recharge your batteries. Then you will be more pleasant. It is also Ok if you are a loner by nature, as long as your have a few friends.
el8yX5q3aa	no....you might have to testify.|`|3dKy0Zxjaa	confidentional<br>  is wrong<br>  <br>  confidential is correct|`|13696281d4bfaa532acde67008e9d4d7aa	I'm not sure I follow, surely the person is going to know who they were violent against, how could it be confidential?|`|DuOl2cFXaa	No, the person or persons who you are accusing will be told.|`|xCDOBFgdaa	Yes, it is - you will be anonymouse and also, yahoo answers has a built in spell checker :)|`|4KNZ0xefaa	you spelled confidential and here wrong.|`|IFL3GcM9aa	It can't be.  For one thing, if you press charges against some one, it goes to a court of law, and the accused has a right to defense.  And if the accused knows who he committed violence against, it's not a secret who is pressing charges anyway.<br>  <br>  However, there are a lot of protections built into the law for witnesses and victims.  You could call the police (anonymously if you are worried) and ask them what protections you would have. If you aren't a victim, but just a witness, it might be possible to keep you out of it.|`|58fb6275b2690c997be88cb08cd6948daa	No. If it goes to court then they have the right to face their accuser (you) also some people think that if they press charges on someone and then drop them that it's over and that's not always the case. Sometimes the state is the one that presses the charges. With all that being said, if you had to ask a question like this, it sounds to me like you need to talk to someone before something worse happens.|`|lNfxxZ71aa	grammar is quite important too lol<br>  that would be confidential<br>  in england of course it isn't!<br>  everyone has the right to defend an accusation so<br>  the accused will have the right to know who he is being accused by!!|`|e00fc1c299d34a3d8c47805b7ceab0a4aa	Confidential to whom? The person will be arrested, they will have to know where the charges come from for the court case. And it will be a public trial.|`|665e3V3Taa	Yes it is! If you say the the police you wish your accusations to be confidential than i assure you they will be.|`|bEWyl3Jiaa	yeeahhhh, if you ask for them to keep it confidential. i would have thought?
pYm11JqYaa	I think that in most cases, natural consequences are the best enforcements.  I think that if a child is doing something dangerous that you can't just allow for a natural consequence, then a suitable consequence should follow. i.e. The child runs into the street...you can't just let a car hit them and say "I told you to be careful"  so you would have to set a clear consequence...child runs in the street, child has to stay in his room for "x" amount of time.<br>  <br>  I like my children to behave correctly because it's the right thing to do.  But, if they don't get their chores done, they don't get to play video games or watch tv.  I don't think that's punishment, it's just expectations.  (My kids think it's punishment though...so it all depends on the POV)|`|50UbJp14aa	No, thats like physical abuse. Just teach them hat is right and they might follow|`|e8f304081fca5eabe282a819a91143f3aa	I believe that Yes, some form of punishment is a teaching tool, and depending on the age of the child/teen would depend on the type of punishment.  The situation I found it most effective was where it was of the utmost importance - that of safety of the child.  (i.e., NOT going into the street, NOT talking to strangers without a supervising grownup being with them, NOT playing with matches, etc)  And depending on the age, and the personality of the child, I even approve of a bit of corporal punishment.  As the child grows, corporal punishment is no longer of ANY use - but the grounding, or taking privileges away seem to help, along with a LOT of supervision up close and from a far.  It's more difficult now than when my children were young.<br>  <br>  God Bless those who are now charged with the duties of parent!|`|5UQJENn3aa	It depends on how you punish. My mom has made many mistakes in raising me punishing me in the wrong ways by doing it constantly, punishing for no reason, and it have no effect on me. When children are younger they need to be told whats right and whats wrong and if its taking about their xbox or playstation to make them understand then so be it. However once they get older into their teens it is no Longer effective. Once they know what is right from wrong they have to be able to want to do the right thing from inside themselves.|`|EzcQOTPtaa	It is not the best tactic. Children grow a conscience when you explain why their behavior bothers you. It might take longer to get your point across, but it will work out in the long run.

81964a37361b370ed11fa4575a2b7db9aa	Hmm....I would like to seriously comment on the "question" that you asked, but I cannot pick through all of your grammatical errors that would inorder me to do so. I'll give it a shot.<br>  <br>  Capitalism is, in a word, freedom. I don't have a dictator breathing down my neck, nor do you. Socialism is control. That's it-control. Socialists want to take my hard-earned money (once more-I earned it) and give it away to bums who won't get off the couch and get a job! That doesn't sound fair to me at all. Now, disabled people or citizens who were layed-off two weeks ago: That is another story. We should have a plan that allows and helps the unemployed find an occupation. I don't care if it is scraping gum off the bottom of a table-support your family, don't make me do it. This may sound uncompassionate-but that is just it. Compassion drives society to work hard, earn money for their families, and live life to the fullest! That is what drives capitalism, and what drives freedom---work. Working for your family and for yourself allows everyone to be better off. When, and only when, we realize this, we will be so much better off and can give to charities. Now, the "Charity's" that you spoke of (I think you mean charities): compassion comes with responsibility as well as survival.<br>  <br>  So, there was my litte rant on capitalism and the greatness of the United States. Take it to heart and to mind, and don't even think of socialism...that is for leaders who want to spread the wealth.<br>  Have a lovely day, friend!|`|892YhtPCaa	socialism is probably right, said Einstein, i just want a Ferrari...!!!!!!!|`|K2d51gwOaa	People should always be able to live a descent lifestyle and be encouraged to work or study.<br>  <br>  Capitalism encourages trade, efficiency and greater standard of living for all.|`|lAqV1OmRaa	Having perfectly equal rights, when it comes to money, sounds nice, but when you think about it, it wouldn't work out either.

We might introduce wolves into an ecosystem to see if they help balance the population of other animals better, but this will lead to other effects that we can't predict.  <br>  <br>  When you first asked this, my mind instead went to humans, though.  The natural order of humans is to be wild, yet we try to change that natural order by introducing new concepts, like marriage.  Though I am happily married, I believe it is 'unnatural' in a way - requiring humans to adopt attitudes that might not reflect their gut instincts.

AA10835554	The same way a hunter can kill a deer, they don't see the actual being, but they see their very limited "idea" of what the being is. Once you label something, you think you know what it is, and then it becomes very hard to see the being over the label. <br>  <br>  Take a bird for example. When you first saw a bird, you didn't know it was called "bird", and you didn't know anything about it. You actually saw it without labeling it. But then you may have said, what is that, and someone said, that is a bird. Now you create a mental image of what a bird is, and the next time you see the creature, you only see your idea of the bird, and miss the unthinkable brilliance of it. <br>  <br>  A killer doesn't see the person, but they see their demented idea of the person. They can't place themselves in the other being's shoes, so they can kill without remorse. Cattle farmers do this everyday.<br>  <br>  So there is a block in the killers mind that allows them to see beings as useless things instead of life that is capable of pain, and so must be punished in order to hopefully free them from this delusion.|`|Wy3wddFlaa	maby they kill because they hate the person... duno.|`|eeP9Xp8Laa	Well. <br>  People get so fed up with some people.

Who want their friends and anyone really, to do well. For their friends who do drugs or who don't care about school to stop doing bad things.<br>  No one listens to them. Eventually they get tired of trying. They feel like no one cares about them. They are the only one who cares.<br>  After feeling like this, their compassion is still there but is sortof overtaken.

QQQ36jMOaa	Forcing them?  NO.  Encouraging them?  Yes.  My man is an inner city middle school teacher and he talks about how all the time how a lot of the boys never had any positive male role models in their life.  Sometimes, by the time they get to him in middle school, there's little he can do (although I imagine he helps a lot more than he can admit).  One of the things him and the teachers discuss is that more males in primary education would be more positive influences on those boys who don't have fathers or male role models.  Of course this is far more common in inner city schools--I don't think its as much of an issue to rural or middle class and upper class schools.  <br>  <br>  I think more incentive should be given to men to join primary school because, at this point in time, there is such a negative outlook on male elementary school teachers.  The truth is that in inner cities it takes a strong, disciplined character to teach these kids.  Many women are doing it but that doesn't necessarily help the boys relate.  <br>  <br>  On a side note, just to get an idea of how hard inner city schools are, the school actually LOOK and are PLEASED with former military members.  They say we make the best teacher.  :)  My man is a former Marine and he does very well in his school.|`|61AjTvw7aa	You mean should feminists be telling men that they have to be primary school teachers?

9EVcTnUWaa	I don't think that limiting abortion is the right way to go until people are more willing to adopt some of those children that they tell other people to have.  I think that teaching adolecents about birth control is the way to go.  You're not going to get them to stop having sex at least make sure that they have options so that they don't get pregnant.  I have three daughters two of whom are 30 and older and neither of them has had a child they didn't want because I taught them about sex and birth control and made sure that they knew they could come to me for condoms.  I'm teaching my youngest the same way and she's almost 17 an honor student in high school and not ready for sex and she knows that's ok also.  I think that in every thing else knowledge is the most important.  IF all of the people who esposue anti-abortion laws and ways of doing things would adopt more of the kids who have no homes and who would really be pro- life as in anti- capital punishement I would have alot more respect for them.  But there are two many people who are anti- abortion who aren't forster parents or adoptive parents and who are pro-capital punishment to me that's being a hyprocrite.  Either you are pro life all the way or else it's only when it suits you.  You can't have it both ways the way that I'm thinking.

vwLt9eOKaa	Wow...some people should learn how to spell certain terms before they answer on here.  It really takes away from one's credibility.  Social learning may have some support in terms of a placebo effect.  If a patient sees another patient getting better from medicine, pills, etc then that person may begin to "feel" even if only given a sugar, water pill.  I do agree with the person saying it is really a matter of opinion as well.|`|bjqjkDMHaa	I don't know that many people know what those terms mean...maybe add details as to what each approach entails, might get more and better answers|`|UU4AWKD6aa	In terms of counselling, the behaviourist/cognitive has more credibility as it it is more objective and measurable. It can also be used on a short term basis, therefore cost effective <br>  <br>  I think probably the humanistic approach is the most popular. Although it is rather unkindly known as the 'nodding dog' approach many clients have been helped by this approach. It is probably the mainstay of most counsellors tools for helping people.|`|3rq39Pgmaa	That is always gonna be personal opinion, I'll give you a little back ground with each so you can make your decision, but of these approaches I prefer psychodynamic- a perspective from Freud which is where we get psychoanaylsis. Now while I disagree with most of Freud's theories cause he was seriously whack, his one contribution was the psychodynamic approach which deals with the unconscious motivation. The goal is to make the unconscious know. (ex. why I date guys that are bad for me, I must 1st understand why I do it before I can change it.) Behaviorist in clinical setting focus on changing ones actions through reinforcement. From the research perspective to understand people the studies must be measurable and observable-thus they look at ones behavior. That great and all but it doesn't account for cognition- why they are doing that behavior etc. Humanistic- (I could role with a little more) they believe each of us have a natural potential that we can actualize and find meaning. Common criticisms they focus on the person and sometimes fail to address the problem... Social learning-Bandura combined classical and operant conditioning with observational learning. Basically brought cognition into the equation. We learn to do or not do something by watching others.|`|oE1eCjRtaa	I would say the social learning approach, if you are around someone long enough who is suffering from an abnormality or something then their is a high chance that you will begin to act like it as well.

Your mom isn't helping much either, even if you had told her when you found out she'd still be mad or upset. But it is not your fault. You just have to remember that. She'll get over it and herself and mellow out eventually.  Your brother's going to collage, but it's not like you can't still talk to him or call him, right?  It's not the best but it's still somethign. <br>  Do NOT, I repeat, DO NOT kiss your friend, especially do not have sex with her.  It's not right. You'd just be using her, too, and you'd create problems, not just with the girlfriend, but also your friend.  She might see it as something other than just sex, and think that you want to have a relationship with her.  <br>  Stick with your girlfriend. Have her come over later on tonight or tomorrow and explain to her that you do love her, you're just having a hard time expressing it and saying it right now because of your parents.  And if you're so horny then just have sex with her, but make it meaningfull so it's not like you're just using her.  Take her out to dinner, or make her dinner, go to a movie or rent a movie and watch it together at your *or her* house, snuggle under a blanket together and hold her in your arms.  Kiss her on the top of her head gently.  She'll realize that you still love her. Then after if you want to have sex then tell her or ask if she wants to.<br>  <br>  Just remember that not everything is your fault. Other people make mistakes, decisions, and do hurtful things.<br>  <br>  <br>  I honestly hope things get better for you.|`|nhFiEQNAaa	Take a deep breath.<br>  Sounds like both your mom and dad need an escape goat or someone to blame, and it sucks they chose you. Try to take a step back to realize your dad cheating had nothing to do with you. He got greedy and cheated. Your mom kicking him out had nothing to do with you- she might have preferred you to tell her sooner than you did, but she would have been pissed at him whenever you told her, right?<br>  <br>  Keep your girlfriend close. If she has been with you for 3 years, that means she has been thru a lot of changes. You told the internet you love her- go tell your girl that. She needs to hear it. Also, if things aren't good at home, you should do everything you can to strengthen the things that are going good. If you sabotage your relationship with her, you'll blame yourself and continue into a downward spiral. Your gf is your way out of the hole your parents dug you, ok?<br>  Stop having your friend crash at your place. The more temptation you welcome, the harder it will be to fight. <br>  The nightmares will go away with time, I promise. It's just nature. <br>  But if you cheat like your dad did, that sh*t will haunt you for a lot longer than your dreams. And sounds like she doesn't deserve it.<br>  <br>  From one dude to another- I'd tell you to give yourself a "low-high-five" (pleasure yourself) to curb your need. That is WAAAAAAY better than cheating. It'll give you a release too. <br>  Stay in there and go be with your girl. Keep us posted bro.

The widespread use of computers and the advent of the Internet has made it easier to plagiarize the work of others. Most cases of plagiarism are found in academia, where documents are typically essays or reports. However, plagiarism can be found in virtually any field, including scientific papers, art designs, and source code.<br>  <br>  Detection can be either manual or computer-assisted. Manual detection requires substantial effort and excellent memory, and is impractical in cases where too many documents must be compared, or original documents are not available for comparison. Computer-assisted detection allows vast collections of documents to be compared to each other, making successful detection much more likely.

2inq4zHZaa	I am sick of this saying.  I am a very thin person.  5'4'', 105 pounds soaking wet, and 21 years old.  I have always been tiny, it's just how I am made.  I still have the shape of a female, but I guess I am not large enough to have "curves".  Therefore, by today's standards, I am not a real woman.  But jeez, my waist is still smaller than my bust and hips.  So technically I have some curves right? Why doesn't anyone notice that? I am so tired of being ridiculed for being small.  I am NOT anorexic, and I don't have any other type of eating disorder.  Nor do I starve myself to be thin.  I just can't put on weight.  Period.  And I don't even want to.  I like being small.  Although it can be really tough to find clothes that are small enough to fit me.  I usually have to alter clothing myself, or just make it.  I taught myself to sew at age 9 for that very reason.  I think it's funny how, if I were to go up to a large woman, and say "Wow, look how fat you are!  How do you carry all that weight around?" I would be a B***h.  But large women (strangers mind you) come up to me all the time and say "Oh my god you're so skinny!  You need a pizza, how can you starve yourself like that?!"  Apparently it is acceptable when they are talking about my weight.  It is assumed that everyone wants to be thin, yet media claims that it's right to be "curvy".  It's very confusing and ridiculous.  I just don't understand why we can't be accepted for who we are, not how much we weigh.  It's refreshing to hear someone else with the same issues.|`|AXNowGPyaa	All men love curvy women. The problem is that the overweight women have stolen that word, like they did full-figured a generation ago.

I suppose I'm not a real woman because fat women need to make themselves feel better? Come on!|`|Y7YC2FzZaa	the emaciated look is disgusting. I am far more forgiving of extra weight vs. too little.

MrtQuBBJaa	sociologists study society. Just get an operational definition of sociology for an intro book. Perhaps you may define it as,  The study of human social behavior, especially the study of the origins, organization, institutions, and development of human society.  <br>  <br>  Then the next issue should be what aspect of society do these people study more specifically. there is sociology of work and medical sociology for example. Medical sociology explores the subjective experience of health and illness on the one hand and the political, economic, and environmental circumstances that threaten health, etc. Whereas sociology of work according to wiki is study of the interaction of people within industry (e.g. boss-subordinate, inter-departmental, and management-union relations) and, on a macrosociological scale, the study of the impact of industrialization on whole societies. it is a cool field of study. The Sociology of Work: Introduction  by Keith Grint is great.

m16gf9mzaa	For me, participating in a few close-knit online communities plus having a few close friends in real life, plus having a job I love with many social aspects is enough.  For someone else who needs to get out  more and meet new people I would recommend volunteering at library or Habitat for Humanity or some other project that appeals, or taking a class on something that is interesting -like art or photography or a language, or joining a sports league like bowling or softball or whatever, or getting involved at the local religious organization that is appropriate - synagogue, church, mosque, temple, coven, etc.  Or start by inviting an acquaintance from work or school to meet for coffee.<br>  <br>  Sometimes just going to the same park or restaurant or bar (you can drink soda if you don't care for alcohol) or coffee house or something similar at the same time, same day, each week will be a good way to meet new people.

956663a3028055c8e593046e569fa61daa	Ah, you're asking about western standards of beauty.  Yeah, they are f#cked up, although I would argue that it's not about trying to make us look male so much.  From what I can see, women are supposed to look like, basically, Maxim models, who do have, er, exaggerated secondary sexual characteristics and gender differences (boobs for the former, eyelashes and head hair for the latter).  Runway models are a different ideal, I think, because the designers tend to prefer a lack of curves out of laziness.  It's just easier to design clothes that look good that way, especially since women's bodies display a lot of differences in hip-waist-breast proportion.  Someone who's a 36-24-36 won't look the same in a dress as a 33-28-38, or, heavens forfend, a 48-40-48.  Easier to hire Kate Moss and her peers rather than deal with all that.<br>  <br>  Why are we all supposed to look like Maxim models, then, even though Maxim models don't even look like Maxim models?  They're all airbrushed to hell; no one looks like that.  That's the subject for a dissertation, there, and I don't think there are any easy answers.  Don't believe anyone who claims it's about evolution; they clearly haven't read any old novels.  For millenia, fat was sexy.  Those old novels speak lovingly of women's dimpled arms and soft bellies.  Greek statues of goddesses are all solid, and Rubens had loads of fun with rounder forms.  And then, of course, there are the Venuses.  Cavepeople clearly knew what fat looked like, and they liked it.<br>  <br>  Why do I think the beauty standards are as stringent as they are today, and as unrealistic?  Short answer is backlash to feminism.  Read Naomi Woolf's _Beauty Myth_.  If women are desperately trying to keep up with the Brook Burkes of the world, we won't have the time or energy to riot.  I think there's also more than a touch of classism.  Poor people tend to be fatter as well as have less time and money for makeup and hairdos and fashion and expensive beauty treatments.  Our society has a very strict economic and social hierarchy in which upward mobility is almost impossible (yes, I'm in the States; we have less economic upward mobility than England, much less than we think), plus we've seen a hell of a lot of societal changes in the last couple hundred years, particularly in the last hundred.  It's not a surprise that, even as beauty standards have opened to view women who aren't blonde and pale-skinned as pretty (when Shakespeare talks about how dark and ugly someone is, he's talking about English brunettes), they get a lot more strict and impossible for other traits.|`|159af8323864a89fbd6da78461d571f4aa	It is not even close.

Lippert, Russel 500, Forbes 500, it goes on and on.<br>  <br>  If you buy stock on the presumption that it's going to go down in value, that's called "selling short". You better know what you're doing for this one (even in today's economy).<br>  <br>  You'll get lots of answers on what led to this recession, but it was basically  CDS (Credit Default Swaps), housing bubble, credit bubble, and Government blowing $25B a month in Iraq for six years.<br>  <br>  Wish I could explain more - email me if you want to know about selling short or CDS's - but you can prolly google them.<br>  <br>  Gotta run,
1a8da3900278db87f090619373273087aa	that im flying or floating and am being chased by something or someone on the ground. i keep trying to float or fly higher so they cant reach my feet, but something is pulling me down. yet, luckily they never quite catch me. they miss catching hold of my feet by less than a centimetre.  and the feeling of the flying/floating is extremely vivid. <br>  <br>  i think i just answered another question of yours... i bet you think im a right weirdo now lol!!|`|mjhPteRYaa	I find that most of my mine are violently realistic and often involve lots of people dying in front of me. They also usually involve war of some kind. For instance, Ive had one about a nuclear bomb going off, I saw the cloud in the distance, knew we only had a matter of seconds, and as my head was being forced back, i would see my mothers face disintegrating in front of my eyes (knowing this was happening to me as well.) However, those are just the nightmares XP <br>    The rest of my dreams usually involve both friends and people I never hang out with and it usually always involves something school related, like field trips and such. And since Ive graduated from school and have moved quite far away, its nice to have dreams of people I dont get to see ^-^|`|Gnd5Sd5jaa	I always seem to be fighting hordes of ninjas (and winning), and I seem to fly a lot too.|`|O9KcfH0Aaa	In my dreams it's usually quite dark outside, like maybe at night or in the evening, but if I'm inside a building it's really light. They're also usually very realistic; like just over a year ago I had a dream where my grandad (who died 9 years ago) was standing right in front of me, facing me, the room was really bright and I could see every detail of his face, it was just so real, in the dream I was trying to talk to him, but there was no sound, which was upsetting me, I was crying in my dream and I was still crying when I woke up.  I had the dream only a couple of days after the 8th anniversary of his death, and at the time I was so mad at myself because over the past couple of years I've not really been able to picture his face (clearly) in my head anymore, so to see him in my dream in so much detail was weird, but made me happy.<br>  Also I dream about sharks very often, I have no idea what that means, in the dreams there is always just one shark chasing me, but they never catch me, I always manage to swim away just in time, when in reality I can't actually swim. <br>  x

ucoiQPQPaa	>> How did they hunt big animals? <br>  <br>  The very oldest Neanderthals were likely scavengers, who recovered food from other hunting animals. However, by the late Middle Paleolithic, Neanderthals are thought to have become proficient with using a spear in close-quarters hunting strategies. They were particularly knowledgeable about the seasonal habits of large-prey and were thus adept at exploiting them. Neanderthals favored an ambush or intercept approach rather than relying on encounter hunting. For more info see: <a href="http://www.eva.mpg.de/evolution/staff/hublin/pdf/Hublin_Steele_2006_CurrAnth.pdf" rel="nofollow">http://www.eva.mpg.de/evolution/staff/hu...</a><br>  <br>  >> What where their weapons made up of? <br>  <br>  Neanderthals are thought to have used tools of the Mousterian class, which were often produced using soft hammer percussion, with hammers made of materials like bones, antlers, and wood, rather than hard hammer percussion, using stone hammers. A result of this is that their bone industry was relatively simple. However, there is good evidence that they routinely constructed a variety of stone implements. <br>  <br>  Neanderthal (Mousterian) tools most often consisted of sophisticated stone-flakes, task-specific hand axes, and spears. Many of these tools were very sharp. There is also good evidence that they used a lot of wood, objects which are unlikely to have been preserved until today. Other tool cultures developed by the Neandethal include Chatelperronian, Aurignacian, and Gravettian industies with the latter extending to 22,000 years ago.

UAMtRFruaa	Pretty much the same from any rural area.
iOv9tbULaa	Hate to break it to you, but dreams don't have any special meanings. You may have had some more than friendly thoughts of him the past that are still in your memory/subconscious. It may have been just based off something that you thought in the past. Hmmm... I dont really think a dream book would help you with that one either. I think you should just forget about it. But maybe if you guys are still cool you should give him a call to say hi.|`|ZqHqKDqEaa	Maybe subconsciously you desire to have more than a friendship with this guy. Since you may not want to say anything to your friend, your feelings came out in your dreams.
