They're all faking it. Then apply to real life. Some giveaways: crazy convulsions, obnoxious screaming. You have to consider what would be done for effect and what would be done in real-life. Place yourself in their shoes and think of what would be feasible. If it's a one-nighter or you just started a relationship, I'd be leery. I'm no expert, but women tend to let go more as they become more comfortable with you. Being relaxed and comfortable is key (as well as foreplay). So if you're getting ear-popping screams on the first night, either you're a sex-god or someone isn't having as good a time as they'd like to.|`|wvJxtmJTaa	you cant really tell but a lot of people fake it to make it better. sometimes you can just ask, some people are honest.|`|YFMaRxaWaa	that will be hard to tell.especially if they is a good faker.|`|LEkeqGrlaa	most people do it makes the experience better.

AA10270701	I took Spanish four years in high school, three years of French in high school and I have a Spanish and French degree.  I would say you should pursue what culture you most want to connect with.  I have always been fascinated by the Latin American culture and music, cinema, etc so Spanish was a natural choice for me.  Whatever you pursue, just know you will be connecting on a deep level with another culture and it will open doors for you.  Learning in a school situation will take you a long time before you are totally comfortable walking up to a native speaker and chatting, but basic conversation will happen within the first year, at least in Spanish it did for me.  Some languages, like French, are learned in most American schools by reading, whereas Spanish is learned by speaking, so the methods are different depending on the language.  You can get Hebrew classes on your ipod for free from iTunes from a seminary.  The classes are really good.  I took German in college also and it was a blast!  I only took one year but I was able to read paragraphs for understanding and do basic conversations.|`|k9RNH7Weaa	I strongly suggest first learning English.

YFXdszmMaa	They found the perfect fig leaves to cover there genitalia.. They then prayed to god, so that god could embue the leafs with magical powers to stick to them..|`|XCrkjoQQaa	the answer to your question is in Genesis 3:7 "Then the eyes of both of them were opened, and they knew that they were naked; and they sewed fig leaves together and made themselves loin coverings." let me refresh you that they were not born from the womb of a mother because there was none. so they did not start as a fetus but they were formed by God as adult already from the dust of the ground: Genesis 2:7 "Then the LORD God formed man of the dust from the ground, and breathed into his nostrils the breath of life; and man became a living being." so both the first man and the woman were a complete grown up being already the woman was also of the same age as the man because she was created from the rib of the man. in our present day terminology this could be termed cloning although the Holy Bible did not used this term. just like we are at that point in time. therefore they can find ways and means to sew for themselves. they can use the middle stem of the leaves as thread to sew the fig leaves together or alternatively they can look for plants with sticky substance so they can stick or paste the leaves together. but the Bible mentioned "sewed together" so most likely they used some substance from the plants in the garden to sew. God has given them sufficient knowledge which was appropriate to use at that point in time and under that particular situation. remember that God was talking to the first man already giving him instructions what he should do here on earth under such specific condition and situation. the proof is when God brought every beast of the field and every bird of the sky to the man to see what he would call them; and whatever the man called a living creature, that was its name (Genesis 2:19). i hope you are enlightened by the answer from the Holy Bible.|`|P1Sl55Coaa	It didn't work very well.

FGcwxZz0aa	Edge,<br>  <br>  I was taken aback by that answer also. There is a great amount of supportable evidence as to the blessed mothers contribution to salvation but the way she/he worded the answer is incorrect. We can reach Jesus through the blessed mother but that is certainly not the only way or even the preferred way. We are called to love each other through prayer which is what the blessed mother does for us but we are also able to pray to God. The prayers of the saints are just supplements to our own prayers directly to God. Asking saints to pray for us is an optional practice to Catholics. Honoring saints is not. God bless!<br>  <br>  In Christ<br>  Fr. Joseph|`|AA12167923	What one Catholic says does not represent the Catholic religion or its' teachings.

Of course it's not in Scripture.  Right at this particular moment, I'm thinking that it's a well-intentioned but clumsy articulation of either a broader teaching of the Church (one that certainly doesn't put such words in the Savior's mouth) or the gist of a private revelation; but for even one of those to be found "worthy of belief" by the Church, it cannot contradict revealed truth.<br>  <br>  My feeling is that this person didn't really understand something he/she heard or was taught, and that was how it came out.  I can't help but think that this occurred to you, as well.<br>  <br>  Edit: Hmm, I don't think troll (based on a quick look through former answers), but quite possibly immaturity.  Hopefully Fr. Joseph has had a word.|`|N6cCc9dOaa	We get this from Jesus.I don`t where in the bible but that does not matter.Part of being Catholic means to stop asking where does it say that? and just start taking the Saviors words for it.That is believing in Jesus.Something only a true Catholic can do.|`|lgNh3EuAaa	John 14:6 "I am the way and the truth and the life. No one comes to the father except through me."  don't get it confuse|`|OC8NWQkyaa	I don't think I would put it that way.  But some saints point out that Mary as with the "Wedding at Cana" says to everyone to "do whatever he tells you".  And also through her Yes to accepting Jesus in her womb, she reversed the "No" of Eve.  So Jesus is the New Adam and Mary the New Eve.  Therefore, Luke talks about how we recieved Jesus through Mary.  The most famous teacher of the theology and devotion is "St. Louis De Montfort".  You could also look at John Paul II's encyclycal "Mother of the Redeemer" to get more information as to why a Catholic might say what you heard.  By this, Mary is not considered the only way to get to Jesus and you can pray directly to him.  It does not mean this.  Devotion to Mary in this fashion is not required by a Catholic.<br>  <br>  By the way, a Catholic doesn't believe everything is in the bible.|`|E71jweytaa	no where in the bible, sadley I think they were mistaken<br>  <br>  oddly enough though <br>  Jesus annoints Mary the mother of John (the beloved one) and John the son of mary<br>  <br>  <br>  "honor thy father and mother"|`|CmHLKKODaa	Strange !|`|e8a42257dd2b34817d2020222ee63839aa	It isn't in the Bible.  Whoever said may have been talking about the Holy Tradition that Catholics see as equal in revelatory power as Holy Scripture.<br>  <br>  At the foot of the cross in the Gospel of John, Jesus told Mary "this [John] is your son."  And He told John "this [Mary] is your mother." <br>  <br>  The Church interprets that to mean that Jesus made Mary the spiritual mother of all Christians.  Maybe that's what the poster was talking about.|`|YVJQ7Y4jaa	I don′t know if this is a biblical statement or not. I would say that it makes sense. If I were single, my mother and father would be central to my life. Being God incarnate, his love for his mother would surpass anything we could imagine. In honor of her, he could say that the way to me is through my mother. It is understandable to me.|`|a7fd823ff38cea82d01dbcb747972460aa	It was alluded to in the Wedding Feast at Cana story when Mary interceded for the young couple without enough wine.

This was done through the prophet Joseph Smith.  Because of this the Priesthood, or the authority of God, is again on the earth.  This allows worthy men to perform baptisms, blessings, healings, the passing and blessing of the sacrament etc.  and have it recognized by God.<br>  <br>  We believe in revelation and a modern day prophet.  That God is the same today as he was yesterday and that he still has things to say to mankind.  This he does through a prophet and also through scriptures.  Because God reveals things to mankind, it makes sense to believe that he may have spoken to more than one group of people.  The ancient Israelites wrote the accounts of early prophets, and the Apostles and other religious men wrote about the life of Jesus Christ.  Some of these writings were saved and came forth as the Bible.  We believe in the Bible but also we have additional scripture.  These writings were of ancient prophets and people who lived on the American Continent.  The book is known as the Book of Mormon.  <br>  <br>  I am giving you a link here to the 13 Articles of Faith which were written by Joseph Smith to give those interested in the church an overview of what we believe in. <a href="http://scriptures.lds.org/en/a_of_f/1" rel="nofollow">http://scriptures.lds.org/en/a_of_f/1</a><br>  <br>  As for what it is like to be a Mormon, it is a very fulfilling and happy life.<br>  The gospel of Jesus Christ brings happiness into my soul and I feel light all the time.  I know that I can pray to God anytime and that he cares about me and answers my prayers.  I love to study the scriptures and because of the restoration of Christ's church I understand them and they are fun to read.  I especially love the Book of Mormon.  It is easy to understand and clarifies things such as prayer, the attonement, the mission of Jesus Christ, what we need to do to return to him.<br>  <br>  I have a community of friends in the church who care about me and are there to help me if I need help.  I have opportunities to serve, not for pay but out of love, and this brings me happiness and joy too.  Everyone in the church serves without pay.<br>  <br>  My children have direction in life.  They know what is right and wrong.  Their are wonderful programs in the church for youth that help them to have fun and still keep the commandments.<br>  <br>  The difference between not belonging to the church and being a member is like being in a dark room and then turning on the light.  <br>  <br>  Some say that we have strange practices such as plural marriage.  This is not true.  I have been married to one man for 26 years, and never has Polygomy been taught, or practiced in the church.<br>  Some say that we do strange things in the temple but this is not true either.  The temple is a very holy place.  Everyone wears white, and talks in quiet tones so that the Spirit of the Lord can reside there.  Everything there is uplifting and enriching.<br>  <br>  We are a church that does not put down other churches.  Not once in 54 years have I ever heard a derogotory statement been made about another church in any of our meetings. We do profess though to be the one true church of Christ, and this makes people upset.  If it IS true though, why would we deny it to please them?  <br>  <br>  I hope you choose to check our the Mormon church.  I promise that it will bring you happiness and joy into your life too as it has so many other people.<br>  <br>  P.S.  You are welcome to come to our Sunday services and worship with us.

Jesus Christ is the Son of God; His teachings are the way to peace in life and joy for eternity. <br>  As part of His plan, God has followed a simple pattern from the beginning of the world. He chooses a prophet (like Noah or Moses) to teach the gospel and lead the people. Sadly, most of God’s children have disregarded, disobeyed, and rejected His prophets. <br>  As promised, Heavenly Father sent His Son, Jesus Christ, to earth. Jesus Christ lived a perfect, sinless life. He established His Church, taught His gospel, and performed many miracles. Incredibly, even Jesus Christ was rejected. Following His death, many people began to drift away from or distort Christ’s true teachings. As a result, God withdrew His authority to direct the Church that Christ had established. <br>  Our loving Father in Heaven is the “same yesterday, and to day, and for ever" (see Hebrews 13:8).  As in ancient times, He has followed <br>  God is your Father in Heaven. He knows you personally. Jesus Christ is the Son of God and your Savior. His life and teachings are the way to peace and happiness.<br>  <br>  His simple pattern in our day. He has again established the gospel of Jesus Christ on the earth through a prophet. This prophet whom the Lord called to restore God’s truth is named Joseph Smith. The evidence of this Restoration is found in the Book of Mormon, which you can read, ponder, and pray about. <br>  God continues to speak His words and reveal His truth in our day through a living prophet. If you ask your Heavenly Father in prayer, He can confirm the truth of this to you. <br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.mormon.org/mormonorg/eng/basic-beliefs/the-restoration-of-truth/the-restoration-of-truth" rel="nofollow">http://www.mormon.org/mormonorg/eng/basi...</a>|`|62s7J8sHaa	Go to www.mormon.org for answers which are directed to people like you.<br>  <br>  There is always an opportunity to chat online with someone, but no one will contact you if you just browse the site.<br>  <br>  There will be lots of responses telling to you go to various anti-Mormon sites, but this is the official LDS-produced site.

3c3d24af1e6b481dc90443b14d2975d1aa	Of course not!! It is only portrayed that lawyers have posh accents on TV! You can have a cockney accent, geordie accent, scottish accent, scoser accent - IT DOESN'T MATTER! <br>  <br>  If you were to be a lawyer you would learn to speak clearly, any accent is clear if the person tries hard! I suppose a 'oxford' accent might sound impressive but many people are put off by it being so 'perfect'!|`|AA10270701	I can only speak for Americans because that's where I am, but if you are in the south and have some sort of snooty preppy fake accent, no one is going to believe you as a credible person.  The same goes for someone who works in New York but is southern; however, sometimes southern accents are perceived differently than a New York accent.  I think the most important thing is be authentic and true to yourself and if you are an intelligent person it will come through in all you do.  You may have to prove yourself if you have a different accent or method of doing things from the people you service, but proving yourself is part of the fun of honing your professional skills and growing in your profession.|`|Eq3PNh3baa	Uh, if a lawyer has a good education and practices law fairly and justly, why the heck would it matter if he has an accent and why in the world would he NEED one? Strange question!!!|`|sXwBN5sSaa	No. As one who deals frequently with lawyers (in a professional capacity!) I sometimes think they don't even have to be able to speak English!|`|gZ0NPuleaa	By the time a person gets through all the school needed to become a lawyer their accent will be more polished than it was originally. The important thing is to pronounce the words clearly enough that the majority of the the listeners understand, and there is no doubt as to what is being said.
d9tCS7BPaa	I think compared to a lot of other states the job situation is good. Honestly as long as you live near a large city, Texas is AWESOME. Cost of living isn't high. People are diverse and friendly. There's lots to do. The only crappy thing is it gets hot during the summer. If you are moving near Dallas/Fort Worth or Austin your'e super lucky. If not Houston can be fun too, and so can San Antonio. Really, Texas gets a bad rep from people who haven't lived here. There's really no place like it. Texas is a great place to grow up. I live in Austin, and it is one of the coolest cities in the world. Great music scene and nightlife here. The culture is similar to parts of California's only without the snobbishness and high cost of living. It has more of a hippie/artist mentality here. Austin FTW!<br>  <br>  But when it comes to smaller towns in Texas. It sucks. Hopefully you won't have to live in like...Amarillo, El Paso, or Corpus Christi.<br>  <br>  EDIT: Obviously Caesar has never been to Texas and seems to be educated through B-Movies and 70's sitcoms.|`|s34GP3Ioaa	The biggest problem in Texas is dodging all that tumbleweed on a windy day.  Financially, fertilizer is very cheap there since there is a lot of bull sh!t going around.|`|8rbQBaIeaa	Where are you going in Texas? Some of Texas is beautiful, some is boring looking. I love Texas and would never leave this state. I can say this because I have had to...due to hubby's work...live in Florida, Arizona, Las Vegas etc...Nope not for me...If your going to move close to the Dallas area...give me an email. I can guide you a little. I know some about San Antonio, Houston, Galvaston, Corpus Christie West Texas, and those surrounding areas....Good Luck...<br>  <br>  Why I put the other states in there first is beyond me....LOL
Ybk0wwQZaa	Because nothing they do makes sense. It's all an abomination and all for self-gratification.|`|Uv6A5eNHaa	im a lesbian and the woman im in love with is more than a bit less feminine than most women. i know im a lesbian, and to me she usually looks more like a girl, and sometimes she looks more like a guy, but sometimes she is so amazing that it seems ludicrous and disrespectful to even try to categorize her in that way, as basic as it may be, it really doesn't seem good enough for her..for a woman to be attractive to me, she doesn't need to look "necessarily "Feminine". im attracted to feminine women as well, but also the ones who just look interesting or cute, not necessarily feminine...|`|FR5ttYfFaa	The answer is that there are different types of men (gay and straight) and different types of women (lesbian and straight). A gay man likes men by definition, but the question then becomes what KIND of men does he like? It varies. A femenine man is still a man, and a masculine woman is still a woman. They are just different types of men and women.<br>  <br>  The human heart is a strange creature, simply put. Have you ever heard of straight men who date MTF (male to female) transgenders, for example? I have. I know a MTF transgender who is the partner of a straight man. He knows about the sex change, but he doesn't care. He just looks at his partner as a woman. Most straight men would freak if they ever found out that their girlfriend was a man at one point.<br>  <br>  EDIT: For the people that constantly keep saying that homosexuality is useless, is unnatural, etc;<br>  <br>  Yes, I understand homosexuals cannot procreate and thus might SEEM "useless" in that way but you also have to understand that single people do not reproduce, yet, no one seems to have a problem with them. ALSO, the platypus seems to have no use either. What purpose does it serve? Couldn't the world have done without the Platypus? Yet no one seems to have a problem with it existing, now do they?<br>  <br>  Homosexuality MAY be a harmless "quirk" of nature so to speak, but it is NOT a mental illness, it is NOT abnormal, and people who are truthfully gay cannot change to heterosexual. Every mental and medical health organization in the United States has come forward to say this: <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AtypELv2jzY&eurl=http://www.truthwinsout.org/what-the-experts-say/" rel="nofollow">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AtypELv2j...</a>|`|hbQOT2amaa	I'm femme and my partner is butch, see i like to think of it this way.<br>  Im really selfish, i like the best of both worlds. She does all the hard stuff and opens all the doors BUT she still has a vagina(my fave). <br>  <br>  No im kidding, my partner is very much the 'woman' in the relationship, shes the sensitive one that likes sweet notes and flowers but shes butch, where as im femme but i hate mushy stuff like that, and love football. So just because someone looks a certain way, doesn't mean that's how they are. I could never date a man because i don't like i could have an emotional connection with one, plus they don't have a pus.lol|`|sXnoIFRsaa	Right back at you, these are all preferences such as dominant people and passive people, redheads and brunettes.  These are what folks feel compatible with and comfortable with.  Why are you questioning it in the first place.  There is so much more to worry and wonder about then what others prefer.|`|qbb9YiRsaa	I"m a gay man, I am not overtly feminine and I LOVE more masculine men.  My partner is very masculine and i love him very much.  I am not attracted to feminine men...so your assumption does not hold up for everyone.  <br>  <br>  People are different...its like liking blondes vs. brunettes...or loud people vs. shy people...there is everyone for everyone else!|`|B7UIP9QYaa	Why is someone attracted by something? It is different for each of us. Do we need to find an explanation for everything. Can't we just admit that the human sexuality <br>  is something far more complex than fixed stereotypes?|`|yFo1GR3gaa	I don't have to make a choice, I like girls and I like boys, butch, femme. Big and strong or lean and fit. Just not too big, or fat :/ sorry|`|8PA58u3kaa	lol, I'm a gay male and I'm not attracted to feminine guys often saying, "if I wanted someone feminine, I would just date a girl". That said, your question implies that dating a feminine man is just like dating a woman, so ask yourself this question, would YOU date a feminine guy? Why not if they are just like dating a woman? The answer is simply because they are NOT the same, a man is a man, and a woman is a woman no matter how feminine or masculine they may be. Hope that helps :)|`|eGtZXgRHaa	I love butch :) You know, a girl, butch or not, is still a girl... The way she acts, the way she thinks... a girl can be feminine in many different ways !

I'm not particularly attracted to femininity myself, whether it's exhibited by a girl or a guy. I like masculine guys. However, it doesn't bother me that other gay guys feel different from me. If it makes them happy, then I really can't see any reason that it should be denied to them.|`|gLVbSrx6aa	I wish I could ask Lindsay Lohan this question. <br>  <br>  There is a difference though, between having a few feminine characteristics but being predominantly masculine, and acting/looking like an actual woman. I can deal with a guy who has a few feminine characteristics but is mostly masculine, but I'd never want to be with a guy who acted like a spoiled princess.|`|VCz1CtiLaa	I don't know. My girlfriend dresses like a boy but she's still a girl.|`|30b5fac62378b9be69757aa6b696edf4aa	Strip a butch woman and a femme woman down to nothing...and they will look the SAME.   It comes down to this, no penis, no penis, no penis. At the end of the day a WOMAN is still a WOMAN and still has breasts, a vagina and all of the soft curves that a woman has (along with many of the feminine personality traits that a woman carries)...REGARDLESS of how she dresses or wears her hair.  I don't understand why that is so hard for some people to see. Don't you have a preference in the type of women you like to date...well so do I : )

7496e539f19e9910f1a77d970d346ce8aa	1. There is NO COMMAND to "worship" on the Sabbath. On the contrary, there was a command to REST.<br>  <br>  The Sabbath "synagogue service" was a creation of Rabbinic Judaism rather than a command of God. Jesus himself complained about what the rabbis had turned Sabbath into. It is NEVER spoken of in scripture as part of "keeping the Sabbath." In Acts, it was the CUSTOM of the apostles, not their WORSHIP.<br>  <br>  <br>  2. The Hebrews writer relates God's "laws" to a will. Part of that is that only ONE "will" can be in effect at any given time. Each new one COMPLETELY SUPERSEDES all previous "wills." Sabbath is NOT a part of the "will" under which we live.<br>  <br>  <br>  3. How does scripture DEFINE "worship?"<br>  <br>  Romans 12:1 And so, dear brothers and sisters, I plead with you to give your bodies to God because of all he has done for you. Let them be a living and holy sacrifice—the kind he will find acceptable. THIS IS TRULY THE WAY TO WORSHIP HIM. <br>  <br>  ... I have heard some complain that the word here isn't "worship." This word was used to technically describe the work of priests in temple worship. Paul is saying that "self sacrifice" is the "mechanics" of proper worship.  Any attempt to reduce"worship" to a one day a week proposition goes against the statement here.|`|IKyITYICaa	In the pilgrim days, you would've been stoned to death for not showing up to church on the sabbath or for doing ANYTHING on the sabbath.|`|AA10471892	God ceased on the 6th day, and rested on the seventh, and God is still in that rest according to Hebrews chapter 4.<br>  <br>  Jesus made it plain to the Samaritan woman that to worship in spirit and in truth was to do so without the restrain of location; Jerusalem. If the location is no longer relevant, neither is the time or day.  Christians are party to the law of "Liberty" as worded by James, and this liberty is the freedom to worship whenever and wherever one so desires.<br>  <br>  Christians are not a party to the old covenant, and as such, not subject to the conditions of that covenant.|`|253e6b2bad99caee34d55cd7b6a38ec0aa	At Pentecost, the people met daily.  Jewish Christians were accustomed to meeting on Saturday because this was their Law.  New converts who were not Jewish met on the first day of the week. <br>  <br>  The way we worship God is the way that we live our lives daily for Him and our love for Him and other people.<br>  <br>  These issues cause us to place our importance on rules and regulations instead of on Jesus who fulfilled these laws for us.|`|s7pqFa1eaa	Dude, I suspect that I am going to Hell for this.

There is no sabbath rule to obey for believers.<br>  <br>  Romans, Colossians, and Hebrews all say that we're not to keep any sabbath.  <br>  <br>  Salvation is only by grace alone through faith alone in Jesus alone.  Our works are not to be added.  <br>  <br>  The only way to get into heaven and to avoid being sent to hell, is by believing that Jesus, who is God, died for our sins on the cross as FULL PAYMENT for all our sins, and then Jesus rose from the dead. Believe this and you will be in heaven and not hell, no matter what! :)|`|5rIsBUKSaa	Certainly.|`|N6cCc9dOaa	God said to honor Him on the Sabbath.So no it it not okay to forget about God on that day.In fact you should honor God every day not just on Sunday.

8a2ebc183110448f4c3847d3aa539174aa	I think that in most aspects Canadian culture is similar to both the USA and the UK, however, there are many parts that are truly unique and distinctive. So ultimately I would say its independent from both.<br>  <br>  Canadian children are taught english and french in school however it is not - Canadian French that they are taught - it France french. So that does open the doors for lots of teasing when they travel to Quebec and other french speaking areas and try to communicate. (this I know from experience)<br>  <br>  That being said, once one reaches adulthood the teasing usually stops and two people can communicate effectively with each other.<br>  Most adults in that age bracket i know, start to forget the french if they are not speaking it regularly, so their communication level drops, but most are still able to communicate key messages even if their grammar isn't perfect anymore.|`|T8ksKCWCaa	Our culture is a blending of the cultures of all the people who live here.<br>  I'd like to think we are independent, but that would be false.<br>  <br>  Most Canadians are not English and French speaking.

"Hey Joe, I was seeing if you wanna watch the game Sunday.

xMF4CUbLaa	The people taking greatest offense to being called Pakis are the Indians, really. Pakistanis use the term to refer to themselves quite freely.<br>  When used as a racist slur, the term is used derogatorily towards people of (south east) asia. It is meant to be a generalised disrespectful term. But it goes deeper than that.<br>  <br>  India and Pakistan have a long standing history of unfriendliness towards each other and so calling an Indian Paki is like calling an Israeli Palestinian !!! It evokes strong reaction.<br>  <br>  As for the British being called Brits and the Australians being called Aussies, I'm sure its perfectly acceptable so long as you use the term for the right people, and don't add an abusive word before. On the other hand, if you were to call all people of oriental origin (Japanese, Vietnamese, Philipinos, Koreans...) Chinese, it would definitely be objectionable. Generalising is part of stereotyping and hence racist.<br>  <br>  Besides, simply put, if a person doesn't like to be referred to in a particular manner, just respect that.|`|ef3e8a055f877ac48bf7cb67749b1830aa	Well British people are actually called Brits, for Britons.  That's like American people are called Americans.<br>  <br>  Australians call themselves Aussies.  <br>  <br>  Pakistani is what they call themselves.  <br>  <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_ethnic_slurs" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_eth...</a><br>  <br>  The abbreviation Paki acquired offensive connotations in the 1960s when used by British tabloids to refer to subjects of former colony states in a derogatory and racist manner. In modern British usage "Paki" is typically used in a derogatory way as a label for all South Asians, including Indians, Afghans and Bangladeshis. To a lesser extent, the term has been applied as a racial slur towards Arabs and other Middle Eastern-looking groups who may resemble South Asians. During the 60's many emigrants were also dubbed as "black" to further segregate them from the white community. Some would say such a division still exists in parts of England.<br>  <br>  However I've also heard several Pakistani say that it was not a racist word and that instead it is the same as Aussie and nowhere near racist and degrading but merely a shortening of a word much in how you call Kimberly "Kim".<br>  <br>  BTW your additional details do not make sense.  Your family being "coulerd" (though I have no idea what that word means) has nothing to do with being racist.  Racist means    1.   The belief that race accounts for differences in human character or ability and that a particular race is superior to others.<br>     2. Discrimination or prejudice based on race.<br>  <br>  There isn't a monopoly on racism--like you have to be from China to be racist or you can only be racist if you are German decent.  In fact, the continent with the highest homicide rate due to racism is Africa.  While coulerd is a type of mirrors and I think a brand of jeans, I have no idea how you tie a purchased product in with being racist.|`|lkNJNnlSaa	Pakistan*<br>  <br>  <br>  Because the term Paki was usually used by skinheads in the 60's as they were stamping on the heads of people from South East Asia.<br>  Paki is used as a derogatory term.<br>  <br>  <br>  Brit, Aussie or whatever isn't.|`|DZCFD0p2aa	I don't know. It's ok to call a French guy a French Man but not ok to call a Chinese guy a China Man.<br>  <br>  I guess if someone doesn't want to be called something then that's their right.<br>  <br>  Also, to answer your second question, you can be racist even if most of your family is coloured. You can be racist against white people or a brown person can be racist to a black person or a black person can be racist to a yellow person. It works in all directions.|`|18f4aeb76a3e8aee506482a962921d26aa	I call myself a Brit. Most people from Australia wouldn't object to being called Aussies and people from New Zeeland seem to like being called Kiwis.<br>  It has to do with changing usage. 'Paki' now tends to mean anyone who originated east of the Bosporus (the dividing line between European and Asian Turkey) and west of Bangladesh as a Paki. It implies that they are potentially Muslim Terrorists.<br>  I knew a family from Nigeria who referred to the eldest son as the n*****, because he was the darkest in the family. OK for them to do it, but I couldn't and wouldn't.|`|AA11296044	People from Pakistan are Pakistani.<br>  <br>  It is the same reason Americans are not Yanks<br>  Canadians are not Canucks<br>  Japanese are not Japs<br>  Chinese are not Chinks.<br>  <br>  The work paki is a pejorative and often used in a derogatory context.|`|rThIVk2maa	It doesn't matter that certain versions of it cause offense while the people of other groups aren't bothered by it, what matters is that it DOES cause offense. <br>  <br>  It doesn't matter why or even if you don't agree or understand, only that polite people avoid hurting feelings when they know certain names to be offensive.|`|28TJbbNHaa	The P word and the N word have a history. They carry negative, racist connotations. Thats why its seen as racist to use them.<br>  <br>  [Edit] dellisoncolette007: "why would i be a racist if most of my family are coulerd" - <br>  <br>  Well you don't have to be white to be racist.|`|Y5IUse1vaa	Jed the fisherman has it spot on. It's the way that such terms are used. Paki and Nig*er are commonly used with a profanity in front of them- EG, You fu***n Paki, whereas Brit or Aussie are just a sort of nickname. I don't mind being called a Scot. Jings, this is really difficult to explain properly.....|`|ZK23yWZqaa	If you are not white then you are highly sensitive and look for racist remarks so you can sue.

When it all boils down to it were all the same, no matter what colour or where we come from, were all human, the only difference is that we all have a different mind and a different view on things.|`|qyHSDsgVaa	Because someone from Pakistan is a pakistani NOT a paki

KUJZnI3Vaa	hello dear, this problem many students or others are suffering from.<br>  <br>  It is normal to be worried from something, but this can affects your way in life too. We are in life because we should be participated in our communities. Public speaking is everywhere in your life, if you let your self to be shy or to be afraid from people, so your life will be unreal.<br>  <br>  Lets me give you some tips which may help you:-<br>  <br>  1- Read books everyday, it will improve your way of thinking and knowledge.<br>  <br>  2- If you have a presentation, try to do it all alone and imagine that your classmates are siting next to you.<br>  <br>  3-  Learn yourself that no one are better than you, all of us can make mistakes, and mistakes are our way to win.<br>  <br>  4- Try to give your ideas in every discussion  group and in your real life.<br>  <br>  5- Learn your self that you are a person who has good a knowledge and character.<br>  <br>  Life is our chance to show people who we are, not to stay away from each other.|`|qGS4oR11aa	practice public speaking in front of your family and practice, practice, practice.|`|RD7A4NAtaa	Practice your presentation on your own... to get comfortable with what you have to say.<br>  Then practice in front of family or friends... to get comfortable speaking in front of others.<br>  THEN, when you have to stand in front of the class, look around the walls... NOT at your audience! Look just above their heads, that way they will think you're looking at them, but you won't even realise who's there.<br>  <br>  You'll find things a lot easier if you can convince yourself that it's just another practice.<br>  <br>  And remember... everyone sitting in that room watching you is probably feeling the same way you are!<br>  <br>  Good luck!!!|`|CdGHyYDfaa	to stay calm and practice before you actually have to speak for real. good luck|`|2NvRZv7Uaa	ok i hate to lol ... trust me . Ok this is what you should do , it should help you so much more. Gather your family or friends around and practice a speech but do this recording your self. Then take a look at it.., if you see something that you didn't like than change it until you are comfortable with your self. Its not as bad as it seems trust me.|`|8PhcD17Vaa	Some of the things that I have done which helped me a lot:<br>  <br>  1. First, knowledge is confidence. Make sure you "do" know the subject well enough that you are talking about. You will see how quickly the nervousness goes away when you start talking about something that you know well. I think this is most important.<br>  <br>  2. When asked a question, don't be in  rush to answers it. Pause (deliberately)  for few seconds and gather your thoughts and then start answering it. <br>  <br>  3. You can begin answering by making eye contact with the person who asked the question ( just as if you would answer that person somewhere outside). This may help. Other times (when not answering), you should make sure that you are not just looking at one person or one corner. Try making eye contact with number of people in front of you. <br>  <br>  4. Avoid any any fillers while speaking, e.g. hmm, aaa, etc. This is something that you will need to practice and it is hard to get rid of this habit.<br>  <br>  5. Think positive. It is your moment when you stand in front of everyone and speak. You have everyone's attention. You don't need to rush, you can pause (and everyone will wait for you) and gather your thoughts if needed.<br>  <br>  6. Another mental exercise is to think of what is the worst that can happen when you speak. Is it really that bad to get you all terrified? Chances are that you will realize that it is not.|`|AA10270701	I would joing a local Toastmasters group.  They help you get over all your speaking fears by first getting you to talk about things you are familiar with with small groups of people and then moving on to other subjects and audiences.  I think it would help you a lot.  I used to be afraid of public speaking because I practiced all the time, so then when I got in front of a crowd and missed a word, I would freak out and be lost.  I found going more casual and speaking clearly but talking about something I am excited about gives me confidence and now I brief higher members of management and am always chosen to do the speaking because I am good at it.  Practice makes perfect...also if you have the choice go first on your speech, frequently the build up to the speech is way worse than the experience of actually doing it and this allows you to get it out of the way and relax while the teacher is more critical of the ones who go later.  Good luck! :)|`|wkqsf5pLaa	pretend the audience is nekkid, duh!!!

AA10270701	The origin of the Thanksgiving holiday (Thanksgiving Day) dates back to the Pilgrim Fathers who, after a year of residence in the New World, celebrated this holiday.  According to tradition, the Native Americans ate turkey together with the Americans who they had helped to survive and adapt. In fact, the European's first winter was particularly difficult.  The only way the Europeans were able to survive the winter was through the assistance of the Native Americans.  They shared their traditions, legends and historical records, and appear to have shared with the new visitors most of their stored food.  They helped  the Europeans shelter themselves from the cold and pass the winter. Only with the help and cooperation of the Native Americans, then, the Pilgrim Fathers, who fled from England to live in another state and full religious freedom, found that people of India who saved their lives. <br>  <br>  The last statement doesn't make sense.  The Indians weren't from India.  They were Native Americans.<br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  The exact date of when Thanksgiving was celebrated by the Pilgrim Fathers and the Native American is unknown.  In 1940 President Roosevelt fixed the date for this national celebration as the third Thursday of November. Americans will not ever forget to celebrate this holiday, wherever they are. It is an opportunity to gather family and friends, to smooth controversy, to put aside grudges and to spend a day together in joy.  Roast turkey is one of the most traditional dish served in this celebration, along with other dishes from the kitchen. <br>  <br>  Thanksgiving is for all meet and try to reconcile.  Predominantly this holiday is for families to get together, but there also some meetings and lunches with groups of friends, who may not be seen for a long time. An invitation to eat turkey on Thanksgiving is an excellent action for someone to reciprocate is owed or to thank someone who has done us a favor ...<br>  <br>  This last sentence isn't really needed.  It really isn't common for someone to invite someone else to Thanksgiving for doing a favor.  It's really for family and friends to celebrate all they are thankful for.

It was narrated that ‘Aa’ishah (may Allaah be pleased with her) said:<br>  <br>  The Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) went out one morning wearing a striped cloak of black camel hair. Al-Hasan ibn ‘Ali came and he enfolded him in the cloak, then al-Husayn came and he enfolded him in it, then Faatimah came and he enfolded her in it, then ‘Ali came and he enfolded him in it, then he said: “Allaah wishes only to remove Ar?Rijs (evil deeds and sins) from you, O members of the family (of the Prophet ??? ???? ???? ????), and to purify you with a thorough purification” [al-Ahzaab 33:33].<br>  <br>  [Narrated by Muslim (2424).]<br>  ____________________<br>  <br>  2.

It was narrated that Waathilah ibn al-Asqa’ said: I heard the Messenger of Allaah (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) say:<br>  <br>  “Allaah, may He be glorified and exalted, chose Kinaanah from among the children of Ismaa’eel (peace be upon him), and He chose Quraysh from among Kinaanah, and He chose Banu Haashim from among Quraysh, and He chose me from among Banu Haashim.”<br>  <br>  [Narrated by Muslim (2276).]<br>  ___________________<br>  <br>  The companions of the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) paid attention to this commandment; foremost among them were Abu Bakr al-Siddeeq and ‘Umar ibn al-Khattaab (may Allaah be pleased with them).<br>  <br>  Al-Bukhaari (3508) and Muslim (1759) narrated that Abu Bakr (may Allaah be pleased with him) said to ‘Ali (may Allaah be pleased with him): “By the One in Whose hand is my soul, kinship with the Messenger of Allaah (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) is dearer to me than kinship with my own people.”<br>  <br>  Al-Bukhaari also narrated in his Saheeh (3509) that Abu Bakr (may Allaah be pleased with him) said: “Pay attention to the rights of the household of Muhammad (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him).”<br>  <br>  Al-Haafiz Ibn Hajar (may Allaah have mercy on him) said:<br>  <br>  The words “Pay attention to the rights of the household of Muhammad (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him)” are addressed to the people, enjoining them to fulfil the rights of Ahl al-Bayt.<br>  <br>  Fath al-Baari (7/79).<br>  <br>  With regard to the respect of ‘Umar ibn al-Khattaab for the relatives of the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him), that is apparent from many things, such as his preferring to put the ahead of himself or any other people with regard to allocating shares from bayt al-maal.<br>  <br>  Shaykh al-Islam Ibn Taymiyah (may Allaah have mercy on him) said:<br>  <br>  Moreover, when ‘Umar ibn al-Khattaab (may Allaah be pleased with him) set up the registry of stipends, he wrote down people’s names according to their lineage, so he started with those who were closest in lineage to the Messenger of Allaah (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him), When he had finished listing the Arabs, he listed the non-Arabs. This is how the registry was at the time of the Rightly-Guided Caliphs, and all the caliphs of the Umayyad and ‘Abbaasid dynasties, until things changed after that.<br>  <br>  [Iqtida’ al-Siraat al-Mustaqeem, p. 159, 160]<br>  ___________________<br>  <br>  The Importance, status and rights of the Sahabah are as high as the Ahl al-Bayt .<br>  <br>  "Allaah is pleased with the first to lead the way from the Muhaajireen, the Ansar, and those who followed them with sincerity and they are please with Him.

OLnmXeWDaa	Polygamy is wrong on so many levels it is hard to know where to start with your question.<br>  <br>  In the US and most free democratic countries, you can choose your own religion, but that doesn't give you the right to break any  laws. Otherwise we'd all join the church of the bankrobbers.<br>  <br>  Society has the right to make laws against stuff that might not hurt you personally, but hurts the society itself on a bigger level. We do that all the time.<br>  <br>  Polygamy, for example, might not hurt you, but it is bad for the economy. Look at the countries in Africa that allow it. They are all poor. When one man takes too many wives, other men can't find one. It's just math. Those other men suffer personally, but they also become a danger to everyone else.<br>  <br>  Polygamy is a way for rich powerful men to get more of everything. It is bad for everyone else involved, especially the women and children.|`|UUyWaMDGaa	Some religion do practice Polygamy but then they will start to take advantage of the situation that's when it has to be stop. <br>   <br>  There are people who are just Polygamist and are not following a religion. <br>  <br>  I do not agree with Polygamy in any way are form.

I believe in sharing your life with one person and giving your all to that one partner but its not so much the multiple partners that Im against(I dont agree but I believe in their right to live like that) but more so Im against the force behind it.|`|EYqTV2EYaa	Polygamy is none of my business, so therefore, it isn't wrong to me. If it doesn't harm anyone, why should it be a problem? I can careless of whom people want to marry. It shouldn't even be a 'religious' thing. I mean, by nature, I have consideration. Simply because I don't want anything (that's harmless) like pizza for example, doesn't mean someone else shouldn't have it and it's wrong to eat it. To all the people that want to polygamy, by all means, do it. Who you marry is none of my business.|`|h6cYQaxYaa	I think that they try to shut it down for the same reason that cults are tried to broken up. They force people to do things by brainwashing them.

That way you don't have to pay for the use of a kitchen/ or gym.<br>  <br>  What about a "walk or run" for the single mother.  That won't cost you anything other than coming up with donation forms.

They may be depicted that way in European art, but then Bible scenes on church windows and in paintings show people in contemporary dress, so i've never thought that was to be taken literally.  I would imagine that it would be possible, depending on the genetics, for a very dark-skinned and a very fair-skinned person to have children of various intermediate skin tone who would then interbreed to produce more and so on.  I have near-complete confidence that evolution is a fact, but i think that's a complete red herring.  Sorry.|`|Hjwp1yGWaa	Please study a Bible!  Adam in Hebrew means "ruddy" which in layman's terms is brown/copper in color like clay.  White people came after the tower of Babel, when Abijah God dispersed their languages so they could not organize against themselves, and scattered them to the wind.  Some of those scattered ended up in northern regions where the Sun tends to not shine for month's at a time, and over generations the pigment in their skin without adequate sunlight and Vitamin D ended up pale hence the Nordic complexion, which was spread by the Viking Invasions, and hence Europeans(but not limited to Europe) became fairer skinned, Blue eyes, and Blond/Red Hair, so now wherever you see Red/Blond Hair, Blue eyes, anyone over 5'2", and pale skin you have the Vikings to thank.  Hope this adequately answers your question, this statement doesn't conflict in there being a benevolent God(Abijah Luke 1:5), just a forgetful and disobedient people.|`|KgCUpE5naa	Microevolution does not completely phase out existing traits within a species.

Movie Stars, Athletes, Real Estate Tycoons,  are all examples of an extreme, not balance.  The Athlete trains all day, every day, often times at the expense of spending time with family.  The Movie star, must keep up appearances,  must travel alot, must often times act out sex scenes, etc. -- all examples of focussing on 1 behavior or lifestyle, at the expense of others. <br>  That's probably ONE of the "unfair" things you are finding out.  <br>  <br>  HEY, what can I say,  this world is not for Christians, we are focussed on the "after life" the life AFTER this one. NOT this one. So let those who ONLY want this life to be sucessful and have it easy.  In MY mind, you can only have it 1 of 2 ways.  1) Easy in this life,  OR 2) Easy in the next life.  Since #2 is for  eternity,  Personally I'm shooting for #2, and screw #1, the other people can have it.<br>  <br>  Anyways.....<br>  <br>  I'd urge you to go BACK to God.  Like the prodigal son in the bible, who squandered his father's inheritance and then came back to his father.  -- The father didn't rebuke him,  he rejoiced that his son had returned. <br>  <br>  God WILL always accept you back.  The problem is, we don't want to DIE in a state of sin, so we shouldn't wait 'til the last moment to ask for his forgiveness.<br>  The Catholic church,  models itself after Christ,  so it TOO will always accept you back, with open arms.<br>  Like the song, Amazing Grace says.. "I ONCE, was Lost,....but NOW I am found"<br>  <br>  OK,  enough of the cliche's <br>  <br>  <br>  Seriously though,  What you are feeling is NOT uncommon.  TONS of people have been the in the same boat as you.  Pursuing Worldly things, but never feeling like it is enough,  still feeling like there is something missing. <br>  <br>  In Jr. High, at the Private School I wen to, they use to refer to that as "a God sized hole in your heart"  -- that was just a catch-phrase for WHY people seem so unhappy without religion in their life. <br>  It is ALMOST like, dare I say it,  God maybe PROGRAMMED us that way.. to never QUITE be 100% happy without him,  we can be close,  but there will always be part of us that wants MORE, something ELSE,  'til we are at peace with our sense of the supernatural.  It makes sense to ME.<br>  <br>  My wife and I have had MANY struggles in life. She has MAJOR medical issues since she was about 12 years old. Female reproductive issues.  Her body has been scarred both externally and internally from the illness and the surgeries she has had to correct it.  She has been in nearly constant pain for the past 10 years of her life. Often times bed ridden. <br>  She had a hysterectomy 18 months ago and will need a 2nd.  YES,  a 2nd hysterectomy, because the 1st one was unsuccessful due to severe internal scarring which prevented them from removing her uterus and ovaries completely. <br>  <br>  I'd LIKE to say this hasn't shaken our faith in God, but sadly it did.  We are just NOW,  7 years later, coming BACK to him. <br>  I'm Catholic and she is Baptist. We go to BOTH churches as a compromise. <br>  We are still rebuilding our faith, but we are happier NOW then we were when we tried to do everything on our own and were Angry at him.<br>  <br>  I could go on and on....but I won't.

Depression affects people physically, emotionally, and neurologically, and is often treated with prescription drugs, which sometimes are not easily obtained if the sufferer does not possess medical coverage. There is not only a racial , but a socio-economic profile present here in determining that breakdown. <br>  People get depressed through life situations, beside having chemical imbalances in their brains, too. Poverty, stress, violence can all affect a person and I think it is hard to assess what race or culture suffers the most from those oppressions. I am going to say, in my opinion, and this is only my opinion, that the black population suffer more because of their past history, economic levels, and lack of medical care and knowledge of this mental disorder.|`|srIv25b9aa	in america...<br>  <br>  cacausians lead the depression statistics.|`|Yi7AR18qaa	You can borrow books about depression from your local library.

The word violent creates the image of an aggressor where as I am speaking about a defender.      This standing up for our selves is something we are going to have to relearn as the current legal system trains us to be submissive even when faced with possible death we are programed to no respond.

I've seen biblical scholars and historians estimate that Jesus was actually born anywhere between April and mid-summer.  Interestingly, though, the god Horus was believed by the Egyptians to have been born on December 25th.  Try doing a google search if you want to know more about the conveniently coincidental similarities between Jesus and Horus.|`|bb06GQ5Paa	Coincidence is not the word for it.

This is the one day in the year when day and night are roughly equal!<br>  <br>  It varies by more than a month over the years and so it simply cannot represent the date of anyone's death!!!<br>  <br>  It is in fact a combination of several pagan festivals most notably the spring festival.<br>  <br>  The name Easter comes from “Eastre” an Anglo-Saxon pagan goddess. Also the Norse goddess,Ostara who took her name from the Teutonic lunar goddess Eostre<br>  <br>  Even the Chinese have the festival of Ching Ming where flowers and sweets are put on their ancestors graves!!<br>  <br>  The egg and the rabbit are symbols of springtime and rebirth along with the custom of giving flowers etc!!<br>  <br>  It is nothing to do with either Christianity or Islam but it does have it's origins in the midwinter festival and many other basically pagan rites but since much of it is a celebration of nature rather than religion everyone should be able to enjoy it and be happy together despite religion!!<br>  <br>  The ancient European pagans celebrated the midwinter festival and a number of other festivals long before Christianity ever existed!<br>  <br>  Babylonians celebrated the feast of the Son of Isis with gluttonous eating and drinking, and gift giving and the goddess of fertility, love, and war. <br>  <br>  The Romans held a festival on 25 December called “Dies Natalis Solis Invicti, celebrating their own god Sol Invictas - PAGAN.<br>  <br>  The Persian god Mithras, the Syrian sun god Elah Gabal, the German Sol, the Greek Helios and the Mesopotamian Shamash.  But also Saturnalia, honouring Saturn, the God of Agriculture. The law courts and schools were closed. No public business could be transacted an this is where the holidays originated - ALL PAGAN!!!<br>  <br>  Wax tapers were given by the more humble to their superiors. The origin of the Christmas candle - PAGAN!!<br>  <br>  In Rome groups of costumed went from house to house entertaining their people. And this was where the carolling Christmas tradition originated PAGAN!!<br>  <br>  Statues of the Mother and lover or Mother and son were paraded through the streets not only in Italy but also in Africa, Spain, Portugal, France, Germany and Bulgaria. Thus, the symbolism of the Heavenly Virgin and the infant child paraded on a yearly basis are not of Christian origin. They stem from the Mother-goddess religion, which is very ancient ENTIRELY PAGAN!!.<br>  <br>  Scandinavian countries celebrated Yule honouring Thor - PAGAN.  <br>  <br>  In Germania (not Germany) they celebrated midwinter night followed by 12 wild nights of eating and drinking.  The 12 days of Christmas PAGAN!!<br>  <br>  The church under Pope Julius I declared that Christ’s birth would be celebrated on December 25 in 350 AD in order to try to hijack the PAGAN festivals but it was largely ignored.  Christians did not really celebrate Christmas until 378 but it was then dropped in 381 and not resurrected until 400.<br>  <br>  The Christmas tree stems from pagan tradition and ritual surrounding the Winter Solstice, which included the use of holly boughs ivy  and other foliage as an adaptation of pagan tree worship.  Holly and ivy represented male and female.  Mistletoe was considered a sacred plant, and the custom of kissing under the mistletoe began as a fertility ritual - all PAGAN!!<br>  <br>  Santa Claus came from the Dutch “Sinterklaas” and was a tall figure riding a white horse through the air and usually accompanied by Black Peter, an elf who punished disobedient children.  Also the origin of the reindeer, sleigh and the elves ALL PAGAN!!<br>  <br>  The modern red coated Santa was brought about by coca cola!!<br>  <br>  America actually banned Christmas several times and is the originator of the expression  “Happy Holidays” which came about because of the pagan origins of Christmas to include all religions and traditions!!<br>  <br>  The Venerable Bede, an early Christian writer pointed out that the Christian church absorbed Pagan practices when it found the population unwilling to give up the festivals. Thus a lot of what Christians now see as Christians practices are in fact pagan!!!<br>  <br>  Scratch the Christian and you find the pagan – spoiled.  -  Israel Zangwill|`|FmazIF6Maa	He wasn't actually. <br>  <br>  He may have never existed, but taking cues from the Bible about what was going on around the time of his birth and death have been estimated and argued. <br>  <br>  The Winter Solstice (circa Dec. 21) has always been a time for divine births in mythology.<br>  <br>  And Easter was plainly set by the Catholic church based on the Spring Equinox.<br>  <br>  When it comes down to it, there is just no reliable evidence that shows Jesus existed, certainly nothing to imply a birth date or death date.|`|um9W8Dy8aa	LOL<br>  The Pagans, who were around long before we were, took all the good dates so we Jews, Christians, Muslims, etc have to take "pagan dates".<br>  <br>  We do not know when Jesus was born and the time of the "rebirth" of light seems like a good choise.<br>  <br>  Jesus was killed at Passover which is tied to the Spring Equinox<br>  <br>  We all look at the same sun,moon and stars.|`|FI916ISFaa	Almost as much of a coincidence that I was born on my birthday.|`|UV6osJh8aa	He wasn't and he wasn't.<br>  <br>  He also was not born in a cave or stable, and he was not visited by 3 kings.<br>  <br>  He quite clearly died as Passover eved, and rose the third day of passover.<br>  The only saviour figure who did NOT die on a Friday afternoon/evening and did NOT rise on a Sunday morning.  (It was in fact a Wednesday that he died, and the closing of the Sabbath that he rose.)<br>  <br>  He was not visited by kings, he was visited by Magi.  There were not 3 of them.  "Magi" are priests.  Of the religions that called their priests Magi, only one group was expecting a Jewish Messiah, the Samaritans (the descendants of the exiled tribes of Israel that had been taken to Babylon and Persia)<br>  Thus it is most likely that they were Samaritan priests.<br>  <br>  Jesus was not born in a stable or cave, but rather a camping ground, and when the Magi visited him, Mary and Joseph had already found a place to stay.<br>  <br>  The church was just so determined to make Jesus as pagan as they possibly could, that they compromised almost every aspect of the gospel to do so.<br>  <br>  And according to them, I am in bondage for saying so.|`|VzCygD6taa	Easter and Christmas were the pagan feasts chosen by the Roman Church to celebrate to commemorate the death and resurrection of Jesus and his birth.  <br>  <br>  History indicates that both events took place at another period of time in the yearly cycle.|`|AA12346187	he was not born at  christmas  but  its not coincidence  he was killed at passover  which is a jewish feast where they sacrificed a lamb  to God  for their sin  Jesus became that final lamb of God  the only one  who could  pay  that price  for us.|`|n55igpCUaa	Okay...

This was a deliberate attempt to convert pagans over to Christianity in western Europe.  Good Friday is always the day after the Passover (a Jewish holiday), the fact that it is close to a pagan holiday is coincidence (though I'm sure the early Church used this coincidence to convert people over).|`|62s7J8sHaa	Christ was born in the spring, not at Christmas time. The changing of the celebration of Christmas to the pagan solstice holiday was done hundreds of years ago. People have long since forgotten what the date really was.<br>  <br>  Our family celebrates two Christmases: Christmas Eve, which is dedicated to the worship of Christ, and Christmas Day, which is not.|`|SrdIsAkTaa	Yes, those holidays were put there because of the particular time of year, as is the symbolism and name of Easter.  Easter falls when it does as the Bible indicates Jesus went into Jerusalem to celebrate Passover and Passover falls around the same time (sort of) as Easter.  The name and symbols, however, were directly ripped from Germanic Paganism.  Easter is a mild corruption of the name Oester, the German Goddess of Spring and two of her major symbols were eggs and rabbits being symbols of fertility.<br>  <br>  Christmas is a much more blatant case.  It clearly states in Luke that Jesus was born in the springtime (we know this from the shepherds bringing in their flocks and lambs and lambs are born in late February/Early March usually along with that time being the first time of year you can get good grazing) so the reason he is in winter is because of a major Roman holiday dedicated to the God Sol Invictus whose story is that of a solar god who dies then is reborn every year at Winter Solstice and this festival was celebrated on December 25th.  Since Jesus' story is somewhat similar (I'm personally of the theory someone played with correction fluid and the stories of Mithras, Dionysis, Osiris, and Sol Invictus in writing the New Testament but I digress) it wasn't hard to move the day to get more Pagans to come and worship with the Christians by saying, "Hey our God is the same as yours" (kind of sort of not really).|`|4kuWOZowaa	He wasnt born on christmas...but it was winter when he was born..and rose from the dead on easter...but its not the exact date they are going by the seasons but they set aside a day for it. so christmas is not about santa clause and easter isnt about the bunny but thats what man wanted it to be about and everything lost its whole meaning.|`|PS6Pjtndaa	Yes, yes, you're seeking the truth alright.

She may not, but that's what it looks like to me.|`|hth11Uilaa	If I am interested and have the slightest idea that he could possibly be interested, I will often initiate that I am interested.<br>  I don't think I really just go up to someone and blatantly hit on them though..<br>  <br>  ...although I did do it once lol.<br>  I presumed he would be flattered I was attracted to him, which is pretty awful of me...<br>  but it was true? :/|`|EBle5hZEaa	Why?

Well, I did the approaching. I'm happily married now. :D|`|5ywrFCoUaa	Generally, I prefer to be approached.

hdQvbs0naa	Hm, a strength. A lot of people see compassion as weakness, but I consider those people weak themselves. Sometimes, though, having too much can be a weakness. I've often felt so overwhelmed by compassion for someone that it makes me incapable of logical action to help them. Strong emotions get in the way of clear thinking sometimes. <br>  <br>  But in general, I think it's a strength. It's important that there are people who care about others out there. It also gives a person character to feel strong emotions for someone other than themselves.
9dd2ac44728dd565acf459d4a4e730d0aa	This poem is really a painting in words. What marvellous imagery! Look for the alliteration (the poet's own name is alliterative, but this may have no connection!), which is used to wonderful effect. You have sharpness (scarred slope, bristling fire), heaviness (Flounders in mud), loud noise (barrage roars and lifts) contrasting with muttering, and a general lack of colour, with even the faces of the men grey and the sun not its usual cheery brightness but  wild purple and glowering. It's reminiscent of Stanley Spencer's paintings of the same epoch. http://www.art-ww1.com/gb/texte/077text....

N53y9qohaa	Hello,    Because he tried very hard in his private and public life to keep the Roman virtues, many of which are enshrined in Christianity today.  Also he is not the only one well spoken about. The Church also had some admiration for the pagan Emperor Marcus Aurelius as they loved his Stoic way of life and much of his ideas on how to live and conduct yourself were implemented into various clerical orders. His persecution of some Christians who failed to support Rome and serve in her military was also greatly downplayed.    In other words, many Christians are not foolish enough to ignore the great works and ideas of non - Christians. Who can say a Pagan is always wrong just because they are Pagan?    Cheers,    Michael Kelly|`|D9lMg7A2aa	Chrsitians admired many many many pagans.  They said of Virgil that he had the soul of the natural Christian|`|wuPTBIIuaa	there is a bible verse which declares Pagans as being more righteous in their worship of God than the Israelites    its a good reason, reference, source for the topic of apostacy.|`|GEfUTyi8aa	LOL... well, catholics stole many pagans beliefs and rituals.. marriage for example... pagan.. not in the bible anywhere... and incense burning.. pagan.. lighting candles .. pagan... drinking wine from a goblet and saying a prayer... pagan.....  so.. it doesnt surprise me they had their favorite pagans... then eventually they had to get rid of them to have supreme control... oh and angels are pagan too.....|`|sjMIFH9Faa	Ok, First, the ideal that Catholics STOLE pagan rituals is highly exaggerated. The Roman pagans were pretty clear in saying that Christian ritual was different from Roman custom and therefor barbaric. Obviously, all the religions of the Mediterranean had influence on Christianity and Christians, but it would be historically inaccurate to state that Christians gleefully accepted pagan ideals.    With that said, early Christians did admire pagan thinkers and scholars, much like we do today. Popular culture has created this image that early Christianity was violent in rooting out paganism, but that isn't every accurate. Stoicism, for example, was a moral philosophy that had quite a few similarities to Christian moral teaching, it like contributed to aspect of Christian moral teaching.    Bottom line is this, in Catholicism in order for an act to be sin full, it must be done willingly and with knowledge that it is wrong. Thes "morally acceptable" pagans just didn't have knowledge of Christ, so they weren't sin full so it was unclear if they go to Hell. Dante, for example, says that they do go to hell, but that first circle of hell isn't really harsh.|`|1D1b6pjOaa	To say that Catholicism "Stole" anything would be a misnomer.  In the early days of the Church, much time was spent trying to convert pagans (look at St Patrick who "Drove the Snakes from Ireland"... there were no snakes).  Therefore a more accurate statement would be that they "Incorporated" Pagan aspects (such as angels, male and female deities, several of the holidays and their associated rituals, etc) into Catholicism.  Mostly to make it more palatable to the converted.  BUT, if all Pagans are bad, what about the essentially good ones?  Just call them "Righteous Pagans"... problem solved!

And when a worldly-minded person grasp a little of it, it always opens before him vistas of false hopes, ambitions, temptations and greed, so that he is never satisfied with what he has grabbed and will always covet for more. The result often is that he loses what he has already amassed and his plans do not work out. If you take a lesson from the past then you can guard your future very well. <br>  <br>  A letter to Mu'awiya<br>  <br>  You have misguided the whole generation of men around you. Having no faith in the truth of Islam you have led others astray. You have thrown them in the depths of ignorance. You have enticed them towards the abyss for unenlightenment and illiteracy. They were out to reach truth but they cannot reach it now, because of you. They have lost the true path of religion. They are becoming sceptics and most of them are returning to infidelity of pre-Islamic days.<br>  <br>  Theirs is an unfortunate plight. A few wise men from amongst them who have seen your ways and who realized the intensity of your viciousness and your cunningness in turning them away from the ways of Islam, have given you up and have turned towards Allah. They are fortunate and may be blessed.<br>  <br>  O Mu'awiya! Fear Allah, do not let the Devil lead you to Hell, throw away its yoke which is tied round your neck, remember that this life will after all come to an end and soon you will have to face the next world. <br>  EDIT:<br>  <br>  I ditto  pva answer<br>  <br>  A letter to Mu'awiya<br>  <br>  Have you ever seriously considered what would happen to you if all your wealth and property is taken away from you. The possessions, the riches and the luxuries that you have surrounded yourself with, belong to this world, a world which has profusely decorated itself and which is bent upon alluring you with its enjoyments. It has enticed you away and you have fallen an easy prey to its allurements. It has dragged you and you have followed it like a tame animal on the other end of the rope. It has ordered you and you have obeyed its orders submissively.<br>  <br>  You have forgotten that shortly you will be called to bear the consequences of such a life; consequences from which no one can shield, liberate or absolve you. Abstain from such a life, keep yourself ready for the Day of Judgement; be ready for death which is inevitable, bound to come and sure to end every life, rich or poor. Do not listen to the exciting whispers of those who want to tempt you and do not make them believe that they and their heinous whisperings have any importance in your mind.<br>  <br>  If you do not faithfully and sincerely follow the dictates of religion and do not act as I have advised you, then I want to warn you of something that you have entirely forgotten. It is that you are unthankful to Allah for all which He has granted to you and you are ungrateful to Him for the Favours bestowed upon you. Satan has taken possession of your soul. Its desire to secure you as his obedient slave, is fully fulfilled. It has a firm hold on your mind.<br>  <br>  O Mu'awiya! Were you ever entrusted with the noble status of dispensing peace and justice to mankind? Have you the necessary knowledge for the work? Do you really know the canons of equity and justice as laid down by Islam? You and your ways of government! May Allah protect me from and may withhold me from behaving towards mankind the way you have behaved and from tyranny, exploitations and murders that you commit. Take care! You are being madly driven by the lust of wealth, power and vicious indulgence, you are behaving hypocritically against man and Allah. You shall be damned forever.<br>  <br>  You have challenged me to a battle. I accept your challenge. But I have a proposal to make. Why have a war involving murder and bloodshed of thousands of ignorant people? Why be a scourge to mankind? Let us have mercy on them, whether they are sincere and Allah-fearing Muslims, or ignorant, unenlightened and greedy mercenaries misguided and fooled by you. Let there be peace and tranquillity for all the creatures of Allah.<br>  <br>  Let us, you and I, have a single combat. Let it be a combat unto death. Let the soldiers of both armies stand aside and let two of us alone combat with each other. Let the world see and realize who is the sinner and who has forgotten Allah and the Day of Judgement. Will you accept this invitation of mine? Have you the courage for it? Are you a man to face death boldly and bravely or are you merely a vampire sucking the blood of others surreptitiously?<br>  <br>  Remember Mu'awiya! Though now old I am still Abu al-Hasan, the man who killed your maternal grandfather, your uncle and your brother in single combats in the Battle of Badr. The same sword is still in my hand, the same blood is still flowing in my veins, the same heart is still throbbing in my chest and with the same courage I still face my enemy. Will you come and face me alone?<br>  <br>  Remember that I have not introduced any innovation in religion, nor have I insinuated schism. Verily, I sincerely believe in the religion which you pretended to embrace hypocritically with mental reservations and pretensions, a religion which you in your heart of hearts actually hated and which you gave up quickly and cheerfully.<br>  <br>  You pretend that you want to avenge the murder of Caliph Uthman. Do you know who actually killed him and who caused his murder? If really you do so, then seek vengeance on them.<br>  <br>  I see before me the day when you will be tired of this war, when you will face defeat, when you will find death or disgrace facing you, when I shall scatter your armies, killing your famous but misguided marshals, when I shall thin your ranks and files; then in despondency and despair you will turn towards the Book of Allah, though you will have no faith in it and no belief in the truth preached by it because you and your followers being hypocrites have no faith in Allah, in the Holy Prophet (s) and the Day of Judgement and who have gone back on their promises.|`|e3PWZYsAaa	sure, here are a few hadiths from your book, so you could get to the dog better.......<br>  <br>  Imam Hassan (as) entered into a peace treaty with Mu'awiya (Cursed) in the same way that Rasulullah MUHAMMAD (s) made one with the Kufffr of MECCA......<br>  <br>  <br>  >>>>>>>>By making peace Imam Hasan (as) was able to show the Ummah that Mu'awiya was a hypocrite<br>  <br>  This will be evidenced from the following esteemed Sunni works.<br>  <br>  Fathul Bari Sharh Bukhari, Volume 13 page 65 Kitab al Fitan<br>  <br>  Mirqaat Sharh Mishkaat, Volume 11 page 38 Bab Manaqib Ahl'l bayt<br>  <br>  al Bidayah wa al Nihaya, Volume 8 page 80 Dhikr 57 Hijri<br>  <br>  al Istiab, Volume 1 page 37 Dhikr Hasan<br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  Imam Ibn Hajar Asqalaini records in Fathul Bari:<br>  <br>  <br>  ??? ?????? ??? ?????? ????? ??????? ????<br>  <br>  "Hasan said:'I placed a condition on Mu'awiya that I will become leader after Mu'awiya"<br>  <br>  al Bidaya:<br>  <br>  <br>  ??? ??? ?????? ??? ???? ????? ??? ????? ?????? ?? ????<br>  <br>  "When Mu'awiya made peace with Hasan, he made a promise that leadership would go to Hasan after him"<br>  <br>  Sahih al Bukhari makes it clear that a hypocrite is one who makes a promise and then breaks it. The peace treaty exposed the hypocrisy of Mu'awiya, and his enmity to the family of Maula'Ali (as). The treaty was set up to show to the Ummah that he was a hypocrite and his breaking of this promise through the poisoning of Imam Hasan (as) made this absolutely clear. Allah [swt] says in Holy Quran (13:25)<br>  <br>  But those who break the Covenant of Allah, after having plighted their word thereto, and cut asunder those things which Allah has commanded to be joined, and work mischief in the land;- on them is the curse; for them is the terrible home! <br>  <br>  Mu'awiya's renaging on his promise proves that he was a accursed one and a hypocrite (munafiq). The peace treaty rather than prove the faith of Mu'awiya exposes him as a hypocrite.<br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  Sahih Muslim<br>  <br>  Book 032, Number 6298: <br>  Ibn Abbas reported: I was playing with children that Allah's Messenger (may peace be upon him) happened to pass by (us). I hid myself behind the door. He (the Holy Prophet) came and he patted upon my shoulders and said: Go and call Mu'awiya. I returned and said: He is busy in taking food. He again asked me to go and call Mu'swiya to him. I went (and came back) and said that he was busy in taking food, whereupon he said: May Allah not fill his belly! Ibn Muthanna, said: I asked Umm Umayya what he meant by the word Hatani. He said: It means" he patted my shoulders".<br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  One of the ugliest innovations that started during the reign of Muawiyah was that Muawiyah himself, and through his order to his Governors, they used to insult Imam Ali (a) during the Sermons in the Mosques.

AA12193600	It is my belief that the world would be a more stable and philosophically advanced place were it not for the deletarious effects of religions.  At the basic level human beings have developed codes of conduct because the codes of conduct are what enables society in general to flourish.  (A culture for example that has societal prohibitions against murder, theft, rape etc will prosper relative to those that do not--hard to leave home and family to go out into the fields when you have to stay home to protect your possessions and family).  Unfortunately as these social mores evolved in times long past--so did the concept of explaining that which couldn't be explain with the vehicle of gods and dietys--the two became entertwined.  Religions are at their heart power structures--as man went from the hunter gatherer to agriculture with the emergence of towns and cities (centralization being necessary to an agricultural lifestyle) --possessions and property were significant acquisitions and redefined the power structures from the best hunter/strongest warrior--to those who held the most and best lands.  The emergence of kingdoms etc.  Religion had to evolve along with man--from the great spirit of the hunter gatherer--to the temple dwelling deitys. The power inherent in these religions depended on having "believers".  Over the last 5000 years or so religion evolved into the optimum vehicle.  If you don't do what your told you will die--and also lose your ticket to the afterlife.  Parents clearly do not want their children punished so children are raised in religion from an early age.  Relgion has had 5 millenia or so to perfect what amounts to brainwashing techniques in a doctrine designed to keep the faithful faithful.  This has in great part had a retarding effect on the development of the sciences, as many religions once retarded or halted the development of science in it's methodogies in some areas.  Wars--how many wars have been fought that has been related to the concept of religion.  War is antiethical to human advancement--it takes a strong motivating force to recruit the numbers necessary.  For example--the holocaust was sold to the germans as look at what bad things this group of religious people do---but in reality it was about gaining the property and wealth that they held.  The population bought into it though in a religious sense.  Moselms vs christians in the crusades were about control of trade routes by two great religions--but sold to the common soldier as service to jesus or allah.  All in all, think the superstitions of humanities childhood that explained the unexplainable to him clearly had retarding effects on both human philosophy and war.|`|E9chZY74aa	With no order (religion) you would get chaos.  The Bible directs all three institutions given by God as it is for man.  1) the family - responsible to provide, nurture and teach the children.  2) the government - responsible for protecting the innocent, punishing the wicked and rewarding the good.  3) the church - responsible for the poor, hungry, sick, widows and orphans, the lost and encouraging the saints.  They are also to aid in teaching the children.      Because government has tried to get into all the other areas, chaos comes.  Today, the government teaches kids, runs old folks homes, foster care, provides in place of the father, nurtures in place of the mother, does not protect the innocent (abortion) and does not punish the wicked.  We live in a sad country that was once great and we are living off the consequences of their efforts.|`|urIm4YaBaa	Neither.     People will still love their families, care for their friends, and want a life where they can take care of their needs. Chaos will not prevail against those who want to keep their civilized life.    As for peace, people fight for non-religious reasons all the time (though religion is often used for popular support). There's no reason to assume that religion is the only obstacle to world peace.|`|IBOuhyWoaa	sort of like chaotic peace    people need religion..to feel safe..secure..not all people but people....without it who the hell knows what would happen!|`|WxaCK4C7aa	Religion will only create chaos, never peace. people will always agree, even if they agreed in the existence of a Deity they will argue over what kind...|`|3EudCWEuaa	Life with no religion would eventually create chaos.    People who genuinely believe in their religion, will not do things that the religion deems as a "sin." For example, a person may have the opportunity to steal and not get caught, however, because they believe there is a God watching over them and knows all things, they won't steal.    If there was simply a "law" that prevented stealing, yet the person could hide it from the "law" they would most likely steal (as many do today).    So a true belief in a higher power, and believing that higher power will judge you according to a set of standards is far more effective compared to no religion at all (or no religion, but trying to enforce laws/rules).    Granted, some religions are twisted and people try to use them as a way to blow up buildings, commit suicide bombings, etc. This is a bad use of religion, and this is not good at all.    But if you have a "good" religion that makes people obey a set of standards, forgive one another, love one another, etc. it can be wonderfully effective.|`|1fB2UdRHaa	Neither, there would still be differences in opinion and beliefs, the world would remain largely unchanged.|`|RTaimrg7aa	It all depends on how oppressive the ones who will enforce those laws would be.      If you mean that everyone would have a miraculous vision that there is no God (first, I would question how you can call it a miraculous vision), and that the freedoms are unaffected it would lead to chaos|`|tW86bOMNaa	Neither.    It is true that some chaos has had (either at the time or subsequently added) a religious dimension. But mostly chaos - certainly in the form of warfare - arises primarily for secular reasons: resources, in particular. In some cases, a rallying cry for that warfare might be religious (for example, the Crusades) but the reasons for the conflict are political in nature.    Moreover, ideological conflicts can and do arise for reasons other than religion. For example, America's experience in Vietnam and in Korea was an ideological one rather than religious: the need to stand against the incursions of communism; a conflict which had no religious dimension at all.    Finally, in most cases, religious leaders *have* spoken out for peace in many otherwise chaotic situations. In communist China, for example, the religious continued to mount opposition to the more egregious activities; a situation which has had (recently and over history) many parallels.    Certainly, there are situations in which the religious dimension of a particular conflict is more apparent: Catholics versus Protestants in Ireland; Jews versus Muslims in the Gaza strip. But these are, all things considered, relatively rare - and can probably be equally drawn back to resource-driven conflicts: for land, for wealth, etc.    So, all in all, I would say that there would be little change with or without religion in most of these situations; possibly shading towards, in some of them, a worse situation without religion.

Jesus' death on the Cross was God's plan for Jesus. Jesus knew what He was put on this earth to do. He was born to take away our sins (those of us who believe in Him) and to lead the lost back to God. Some of the lost came back to God and some didn't because they did not believe Jesus was who He said he was. Today the same thing goes on, some believe in Jesus and some do not. The world is indeed falling apart and will continue to fall apart until Jesus comes back.|`|xNaN3VkJaa	forsook is the word,    but Jesus wasn't forsaken God was with Him, and God was Him|`|CFQbdDRNaa	Jesus was not forsaken while on the cross.Remember He said earlier:"for the the Father is always with me." But when He cried " Eli Eli, llama sabokthuni!" what christ was doing was calling attention to the 22nd psalm! That He is indeed the christ!|`|8rbQBaIeaa	Jesus dying on the cross was the fulfillment of the prophesy of the Old Testament,.Jesus tasted the death that we were deserving and the trasaction was done. This is why we did not fall apart. Jesus made sure that he was sacrificed so that we all may live. To live and have again a chance to be with our beloved Heavenly Father|`|dd1bce7bddbe2e3eb6a98a7a76a80171aa	Don't limit God. Jesus said He had the power to lay down His life and take it up again.

Job not only felt forsaken (yet kept true to God) , he was forsaken for the most part.  God still would not let the devil take his life.    Jesus Christ came here to earth knowing what he had to do.  He did it willingly and submissively.  He was human flesh while he was here and being human flesh and thus temptable every bit as much as you and I are.  In his flesh, still knowing what he had to do and go through, he still cried out that if there were any otherway, for God to please make that way known to him so he wouldnt have to go through what he knew was coming.  (every single minute and belt lash was known ahead of time and he still willingly submitted to this for all of us (even non believers)    God LOOKED AWAY, he did not abandon.|`|sGojEWOxaa	Christ isn't the second person in the trinity, because there is no such thing.  The word trinity is not in the bible.  All through out the bible it states that there is only ONE God.  Jesus said I and my father are one.

kSSlzrufaa	- To be non-politically correct with you MLK's dream is well kind of just that: a dream; color will always be an issue for the world; black people should spend less time trying to be "nonracist" to the world and should stop "dreaming" of the day when all the races hold hands and sing "Kumbabya" --it's not going to happen; the sooner you realize and understand this, the better    - I myself don't care for Black History Month; it's something we ourselves should be happening all year around|`|6MdwF1rTaa	I don't get why you are upset about it. I hear things all the time about the first woman to accomplish this or that and I'm not have a coronary from it.    Besides the only two black I remember learning about in school were MLK and Rosa Parks. Now I think it's important that the history of your race is recognized and learned. Your race played a huge role in the development of this nation and I think ya'll deserve credit for that. And if part of that credit is ingraining how the good that your race has done throughout history then what is the problem with that?    I don't think racism is as big of an issue as it used to be and I think teaching children the importance of all races at school will ensure that we eradicate racism once and for all. Plus you have to think of the kids that are raised with racism in their home. What they learn in school is countering the bad that their parents are teaching.    I think it is great. You don't hear the Jews complaining about the Holocaust being taught in school!|`|KF8CHY2faa	How old are you if you don't mind me asking?|`|REC4YgOuaa	Why are you so offended by Black History month and not Hispanic Heritage Month, Native American History Month, Asian/Pacific Islander Heritage Month? You shouldn't be offended by it. We honor all these months by taking time out to look back and see how far we have come. .Blacks, Hispanics, Asians, and Native Americans have come a long way and it's nice to be able to look back and see that things are starting to change form the way they use to be. I don't know about you, but I love learning about my heritage and looking back at the African- Americans who had to fight, and die for me to be going to a top college, and to have a chance to graduate with honors. Skin color doesn't matter to me and never will but that should never stop you from learning or teaching your children about famous african americans who paved the way for you to be standing where you are today.|`|Gojbv3Nraa	I am not offended. I'd celebrate it all year if celebrating or learning the other races in our family. Black lit rocks! I don't wait till February to crack out my Zora Neale Hurston or Toni Morrison.... There are no buts in my paragraph for once!     Black History Month has NOTHING to do with being "politically correct."  It's not just about the older people commiserating. It's a way to teach the young. It's a way to remind people of what they ought not and ought to do. It's not about skin color; it's about HISTORY.    As for your complaint that it is 28 days long: what about "the holidays"? Christmas Day is only one day, the day we remember Jesus' birth, though it's not his birthday, but we celebrate about a month for it. Yeah, I know. He's an angel, God's son, and that's awesome, yet I bet a lot of those black people who died years ago are angels too.  Are you going to complain about the commercialism of Jesus' birth?    28 days is a drop in the bucket.|`|StRaKUf6aa	No you're not the only one.  Younger black people don't see the point for obvious reasons, but older black people (as well as older people of other groups) still see it as a big deal because...it simply is.    "Kid"...?  Hmm...  :-\|`|da4zS4AOaa	I'm black african. I'm not offended by it. But in the next 3-4 years it should go away since all the toruting is over everyone has civil rights. It should be studied in school|`|rrfioqlbaa	i agree with you on that|`|0rDDPTi5aa	Why would it offend you?  The purpose is to show that blacks have a history and made contributions to this country as well.  If that history had been incorporated into general teaching, it would not have been needed.  But since it was left out, there is a need for it.  Proof of how much we still need it is the fact that most people can only name Martin Luther King or Rosa Parks as someone black and famous in history.  Did you know that the filament in the light bulb was designed by someone black, Lewis Latimer?  Most have only heard of Thomas Edison.  That is just one small example of why it is still needed.  Maybe one day in the future it will no longer be needed, but that day has not yet arrived.|`|1O1ZyEhpaa	Yes|`|ElwwR0HTaa	i used to be offended by it... especially in high school (I'm african and have no slavery in my ancestry)  I found it very annoying when my treacher had some reasearch soem figures and then would go through it in class and everyone would turn an look at me!  like wtf!  (I was the only black person in most of my classes btw)    but after coming to this forum and seeing how many people ***** about it.... guess what?  i actually LOVE IT NOW!  LOL.|`|cPQ7TBcuaa	If it makes some people feel good, then it's worth it. I enjoy black literature...and we do it all month in February, so I like it.

And have multi cultural fairs and celebrations like we use to have in high school. Any history month in this day an age that is race specific or culture specific will only anger others who strive for multi culturalism.|`|UOvzMYpWaa	How many people would remember Martin Luther King Jr. without Black History Month?    In any case most of the time the month is used to recall the forgotten history of successful black Americans who's stories are downplayed if not completely ignored. Are you offended by Women's History Month as well? Why should gender matter? You're obviously young, but you need to think it through.|`|iad9mqaXaa	Without black history month, kids would only learn about the altered versions of American history. Look at all the ignorant questions on here about black people. Clearly, they are not learning anything at those non-predominately black schools.|`|jgpYS0oEaa	They have to teach this because it's important history.

I thought it was African-American now.  I prefer "black" or "white" myself.  There should not be any hyphenated Americans.|`|7Ca2ns47aa	I think you're just looking at it the wrong way. We HONOR these days and this history because it was wrong of us to exclude them from the whites and classify them as being "less" then we are. It's as if we're making up for the bad... taking Obama for example... the FIRST black President of the United States... You honestly can't see that as an amazing accomplishment... especially considering all the people out there that are STILL racist towards blacks?... I mean come on... if anything... it just shows that the blacks are gaining more and more respect and power than ever before... it's awesome.|`|jbDTsZyBaa	Now that we have it we can't stop having it. That would be 'racist'. Yes, we have to be racist to not be racist. Insane.    Thumbs down away. But I know that you all know what I mean. The goal is supposed to be having race not matter. But if we don't honor specific races alone then that would be 'racist'. So how will we ever get there? I wonder what MLK would think about black history month.|`|8lNWNxmQaa	My ancestors were treated worse than dogs for 400 hundred years.

1ce0748c0ab23dcbbd0d889d57183122aa	Haha my ENGLISH teacher called it American when I was in 7th grade. THAT was hilarious. We were reading a worksheet about pronouns (which we learned in kindergarten -_-) and one of the examples was "Names of languages, like French, German and American". I stared at it and raised my hand and I said "Um, it's "english" and she's like "Well technically we're in America and we speak American English so it's American" And EVERYONE SIDED WITH *HER* O_O They were just yelling at me and saying things like "You're just mad because we don't speak Japanese instead (yes, literally they said that cause I was learning Japanese -_-). Yes, 7th graders are immature but they English TEACHER? ..... Wow.    Yes, American English is the proper term- "American" is not. People who call it American are really ignorant and kinda....dumb >.|`|03e31964ea48bacd64475706a14630b1aa	I've never heard it referred to as American.

Every country that speaks some form of English has its own dialects. They are ALL English (no matter the local pronunciations). Just ignorance I guess.|`|3890f326e072192e79ea3f718551dfb8aa	It's ignorance. But, I do think American English is a bit different from British English, so it's not completely invalid for someone to say they speak American. Just the same as saying someone speaks Mexican rather than Spanish would not be a completely invalid statement.|`|1JY3GY41aa	Many Americans do call our language American. Though our language has its basis in English and even English draws upon many other languages, the language we speak in our country, America, truly is American. Think of it this way: we have many slang terms that develop due to the current events in America. Were it a different time or place certain may not develop. Therefore, our "American" language has become what it is only because it is in America.|`|8d019f874338228cbb13815ff881635baa	those who say that are hella stupid !  i was wondering the same 2 , coz some of them be lik : i dont speak this language bla bla bla i speak American , and i  be lik , wtf? "American" is english so why not say ENGLISH?  but its stupid still|`|b3835ed6ecba00bbca3e1188d38ea41caa	I do it on American on occasion. I do this to distinguish the AmE (American English) dialect from BrE (British English), or any of the other international varieties of the English language. When I use the term, it is not a patriotic "thing", but an acknowledgement that the languages that I am referring to have distinct grammatical, lexical, and phonological differences. The difference is not simply one of pronunciation and regional vocabulary.    As an example, the language spoken in Mantua is not Italian (that is to say, the official Italian found in textbooks), but a different language (or, arguably, dialect), known as Mantovan. Although it still can be called Italian, using a more specific term is by no means incorrect.|`|QIv9jeJ1aa	It is more Patriotic. English ppl are from england and they dont talk like americans|`|KSq8DXlfaa	I think it's because English is spoken all over the place. If you call the American version of English, English, then you could be referring to what people speak in England, Australia, or different parts of the globe. That leads to confusion because there are some different words/meanings in English spoken in different areas. People speaking English English also have a different accent than those who speak American English.  So it's easier and less confusing if you call it American. It's like calling an Austrian or Swiss dialect German; it could be confused with standard German spoken in Germany. It's better to call that Austrian or whatever, and most accurate to call it Austrian German or whatever dialect it is. Does that sort of make sense? =P|`|YATv97Paaa	Because of IGNORANCE (nothing personal)  Its like they refer to United States as AMERICA  United States is not America if they wer a little bit more intelligent they would know that the whole CONTINENT is AMERICA   Like North America, Cenrtal America And South America  THE WHOLE CONTINENT IS AMERICA NOT JUST  THE U.S!|`|wcDy86xuaa	Because someone decided, yet again, that America is the best, brightest, and most perfect civilization in the history of man.  I'm sorry, I'm American and I think my above statement is the reason we have such a negative reputation around the world right now.  I think this is our country's biggest flaw right now, American arrogance.  I hope that we can move past this now that we've had a politcol shift.  If you think you're the best ever, then you don't spend the time to improve yourselves, which in return makes you look not so great...|`|TWfuO1xoaa	english is just the same as "american" only americans spell things different|`|5E9vu8z2aa	im american and i speak english, but i do know ingnorant americans that aint speaking english because they speak american|`|4AgjfQTnaa	I've never heard the english language be referred to as American by Americans.|`|zqRzChK9aa	I suppose its not proper for Americans to call the English language American.

It has always been called English, just with different spellings than those in other English speaking countries.    Come to think of it though, I have heard some very ignorant Americans refer to Spanish as Mexican a couple times.|`|hDR0fOCdaa	I've only heard referred to as American English, not just American.  It's more that it's a different dialect than a different language.  American English has its own accent, slang, idioms, etc.  It's like Mandarin and Cantonese...they are both Chinese, but are inherently different.|`|bb06GQ5Paa	How can laziness or ignorance cause someone to call English American?  Are you just reaching for an insult today?      It's because it is different enough from the queen's English to be called American.  The language may have been taken from England but I believe we've cultivated it enough for it to be another animal.    How can it be ignorance when we take English classes all through school?  We know we speak English but it's different enough to be called something else.  Just like ebonics is English but it's different enough to be called something else.|`|zMvGnlMraa	Maybe it's short for the American English.  As far as I know British English is slightly different and uses the same words sometimes with different meanings.  Most people in the US dont use phrases like "that's bloody interesting" or "Ill have a spot of tea".  This is British English.  We speak American English.  People in Jamaica speak a form of English that everyone refers to as Jamaican.  I don't see why we can't refer to our form of English as American.|`|68dae82437ede9e0c39dc1f85e7252a5aa	I just don't think they know any better, I always feel embarrassed for people when they do that.|`|IhZSaDXDaa	I never heard it said that way.

I have actually heard foreigners say American as a language for the ppl in the us who speak english though.I think the brits would rather our language be called american though since they think we speak dysfunctional english anyways|`|axxQzOCHaa	Yeah eh .. My name is not Joe but I SPEAK ENGLISH AND FRENCH =) (spanish too !!)

The American language is really a mish mash of bits and pieces of several languages: French, Spanish, Italian, Arabic, German, Chinese, Hindu...etc etc etc.  If ANYONE is ignorant, it's you trying to be a smart azz.    Before you try to bad mouth us, learn spelling, sentence structure, punctuation and grammar.  That way you won't make yourself look like such a jackass next time.

BQ6WmoHiaa	I think the idea that someone could raise a child and not influence them at all is naive.  This concept that not telling them what to believe is the same thing as not influencing them is completely naive.    Bottom line, we believe what we will, and we will pass that to our children.  Whether our children ultimately take that up or not is based on their own choices and experiences, but the influence is there.    God bless you.|`|4sUek7ugaa	I encouraged exploration.  I took my kids to church if they wanted to go.  They all eventually decided that there was nothing they wanted from a church.    I answered questions truthfully,  but not one of the four kids ever asked me, "Is there a god?"    Do  you really think it's right for churches to teach young children that their parents are going to be tortured forever?  That's abusive, in my opinion, and puts an extraordinary amount of stress on kids whose parents or grandparents don't happen to be church members.    What about Mormon children who have relatives or friends who are not Mormon?   Are their relatives obligated to convert to save those children from possible stress?  What if one sibling in a family converts to Islam?  What about the effect on their children, believing that their Christian relatives are going to hell?  Shouldn't the entire family convert just to make the kids feel better?    Or, you know, maybe the churches could refrain from putting that kind of pressure on children.  Just a thought.|`|283tO9j9aa	I can't say I wouldn't influence my kids at all if/when I have them- you can't help it, the way you act and talk has an impression whether you like it or not. However, if they had questions about faith I would try to answer them with "some people believe that (belief) and others believe (belief 2). I believe that (my belief) but remember, all of us believe different things and that's okay"    I like libraries and learning, I hope that any children I have do too so I can look at books with them and they find out more that way. I would like to tell my kids some of the Bible stories but I would tell them as just that- stories- and I would tell them alongside stories about Greek and Norse gods.    Once the kids are old enough to make up their own minds I would have no problem letting them go off with religious friends to go to church or wherever. I have a Catholic friend, if they wanted to go to church with her I would let them- I know she is capable of teaching them about her faith without indoctrinating them, as are most people. If they end up religious, that's fine- as long as they grow up to be tolerant, kind, loving people their faith is irrelevant. They would still be my kids after all.    I think if you bring your kids up to know that people have all kinds of beliefs and all (well, most) of them are valid, you probably won't have the issue of a Christian child worrying that their atheist parent is going to hell.    Having said all this, I would still teach my kids the value of good science. That's more because I'm a complete geek than anything else- I would just encourage them to question things rather than to think they're less valid just because they're different. Unless it's intelligent design in science class.|`|Z92LPUqaaa	Nah,  I don't teach my kids from the doctrine of "unbelief"  I don't even talk about the thousands of gods let alone the Christian one..  I let them think for themselves.|`|9e71236ddd91a1ac14a12c704616491caa	My children aren't old enough yet to ask that question, but when they do, I'll tell them that some people believe in a god, and some people don't, and it's up to them to decide for themselves if they think there is one.  If they ask me what my opinion is, I'll be honest and tell them that I don't believe there is one.|`|aiDV9FgGaa	I encourage Connor to follow whatever he wants to believe when he gets to that point. I will not discourage him from faith in any way.     What I believe has gradually come to me over the years. I don't expect him to follow my same path.    I love him enough to allow him to believe what he wants, and not impose anything onto him, Christianity or otherwise.|`|AA11187638	Yes, but I would influence my children by giving them a good education and teaching them to think rationally. It is not necessary to say "There is no God."    It seems clear to me that most theists do not know much about science. Even the so-called creation scientist, Ken Ham, is mistaken about a great many things.     If a child should receive an education about religion, then he will be exposed to several religions, not just Christianity. A lot of Christian parents are eager to buy their kids a children's Bible. I don't think they would be as accepting if someone gave their kids a children's Tao Te Ching or a children's Koran or a children's Bhagavad Gita. An atheist would have no problem with that kind of broad exposure.|`|f79a4e31211ec881cdd7df7de85a9262aa	"So my question is this-I understand why you don't love God but don't you love your kids enough to do it for them? "    its just another version of pascals wager.    tell me, which god should they be versed in and why?  what makes your god more valid than any others?  your book?  many religions have texts.  miracles?  your not the only religion to claim such.  prophecies?  your not the only religion to claim 100% accuracy.  the Oracle at Delphi was never wrong.|`|bbb941465ccc4a1ec3a57d5ff0a4b17baa	Not at all, even the most rabid theist should be able to recognize the difference between indoctrination and providing information.  I'm not teaching my child that there is no god and all religions are categorically false no matter what anyone else says in the same way that a christian parent might teach their child to worship jehovah and that all other religions are untrue.  I want to give my child a choice, I'll teach him as much as I can about every religion I know about, but not teach him that any of them are true, and then he can make his own mind up when he's ready.  How many people get that chance?|`|mQ2gLxj1aa	Nope. My boys are raised to explore ALL religions regardless of what I do or do not believe in. They are allowed to CHOOSE what they believe in. Isn't that just amazing? That kids can actually choose their own beliefs and have their own thoughts?|`|AA10873763	Not very well, apparently.  Of my two children, one is Christian and the other doesn't have much to say about it, but I don't think she's a believer.  It really doesn't come up in conversation all that often.|`|37LKDbtsaa	I say, they must wait to they get older. Children are very impressionable, especially in front of their parents.|`|ViZH5twNaa	I don't have kids, but what could an atheist possibly indoctrinate their children with? How does one force a lack of belief on another?      "If you claim you don't then how do you react or answer when your child ask if there is a God?"    I don't have kids, but if I did where would they hear about God? If they asked regardless then I would explain what God means like maybe "Some people think there is a really powerful person that controls everything" or some such.      "Does atheists like anyone other then themselves?"    I like everyone until I have reason not to. I'm not liking you right now for suggesting all atheists are self centered.      "But the kids- Surely all kids who believe in God would have asked their father/mother why they are not going to church or don't believe as they know the consequences, right. So naturally, this child would be in fear of what the outcome is for their father/mother. So my question is this-I understand why you don't love God but don't you love your kids enough to do it for them?"    Why would a child believe in God if not told to do so? If the child is old enough to find out about the concept of God and come to his or her own conclusion on the matter then they will understand why their parents don't go to church. Your question doesn't make sense.    *edit*  WOA WOA WOA WOA WOA! There is a HUGE difference between a child being influenced by his or her parents and indoctrination. Do you see me complaining about a son of an accountant becoming an accountant? Indoctrination is the forcing of such beliefs on another. Indoctrination is punishing a child based on their beliefs.    How many times do you thin a child has been all but disowned by a religious parent because his or her child isn't part of the same faith as them?    Telling a kid he is worthless unless he believes in God to the point he or she breaks down in tears is indoctrination. Having children chant what you want them to believe is indoctrination.     Watch this stuff.  http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1LaAvZp7E...  http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MORGPoNuZ...|`|gbBJ2q1Qaa	If I had kids, I would educate them on the major world religions - their beliefs, gods/goddesses, ideals, tenets, etc - and encourage study and discussion and questions.    Then I would let my child decide what spiritual/religious path (if any) s/he would like to follow.|`|FmazIF6Maa	I'm no Atheist, I'm a Wiccan, my husband is Pagan, and we raise our kids Pagan/Wiccan honoring God and Goddess in our home and holidays.    Now think about this-- do your kids worry about Goddess? Do you know  a lot of Christian kids who do?    No, right? Because it doesn't come up. Bingo-- same for atheist homes and God.     It's something they might hear about from some outside source, like a kid down the block or a tv show, and ask, "what the heck is that?"     And the parents say, "that's something some people believe in."    And there is usually little interest or concern beyond that.|`|IBOuhyWoaa	didn't read the last part...too long but...    i don't have kids but if i did religion would not play a part in their up-bringing i know a lot about many religions and any questions they have would be happy to answer    if they choose to be christan i won't care as long as they are happy and content...however they will know both sides to it.|`|BABcrdMKaa	You REALLY don't get it.    You assume atheism is a belief or position that has to be taught like any other religion, when in reality if I never said anything about spirituality to my kids they never would just think up the idea of God one day. They would be atheists by default, assuming they werent indoctrinated by this religious motivated western society.    Atheism is a default position, a 0. Any religion is an added number.|`|WZ6YXDODaa	I dont know. GO STEELERS!!!! YAY!|`|oBmLIDHtaa	My wife is christian, and I am an agnostic - we have been happily married for over 13 years.    We both teach our daughter to learn everything she can, and to ask questions - she is very smart.    I don't think she'll have any problems working it out for herself as she gets older.  I support whatever choices she makes - and I will always love her.|`|3GAiVmEAaa	I am agnostic and my fiance is atheist. We both feel that religion is a wonderful thing when it is used right and we will be willing to expose our future kids to different views if they show an interest. I would think that I would answer most spiritual questions with "Well, I think ___ but some people think ____. What do you think?"    I will not go out of my way to show them different things if they have no interest, since truly being open would mean covering ALL religions, which would take a long long time to really do it justice.
wuPTBIIuaa	do you mean animal guides or familiar spirits?   some witches have cats as their animal guides? familiar spirit    personally its better to look for a guardian angel.   when i meditate or fall into a trance i can often see the image of a man   there is definitely a level of spirit outside the mind    and i dont seek out visulation. visions come to me, not of my will.   nor of imgagination. but sometimes i can control my imagination.

Really there lot people with silver-tongued out there trying to make you not going out with White men or Hispanic men but look at those White women who always go with black men , why can't you?  YOU CAN!  This is your life not theirs!|`|Q1MI6L96aa	People who have problems with Love have no love in their lives because of their hate.|`|StRaKUf6aa	If you have to ask, then you're not.      The only people in this situation that I consider "self-haters" is if they say "I only date white people" because then they're saying they find white people superior to black people.  That's obviously self-hatred.  But if you're in love with the person, and not that person's race, then I wouldn't classify you as a self-hater.|`|PvPPivLJaa	For some insecure people (many times who don't have relationships of their own), yes you would be a sellout.  And the other person would be accused for "taking" you away from the other black men.  Feel like a piece of meat, yet?    What these people will not divulge, or may not even readily realize is they are the same as the racists they come here and rant about all day.  How can you in one breath talk about a white guy who gave you the evil eye because you were black, but then in the same breath denounce people for dating outside their race.    These people are extremely jaded and angry at the other race, whatever it may be.  They do not feel adequate compared to them, or somehow feel slighted by them, so when they see one of their own, it's just another slap in the face to them..I personally hold my head high around any race, regardless. I wish you could sell it in a bottle, but oh well.    Their problem. Now, if they want to throw some money on these college loans, then maybe i'll hear 'em out...until then STAY OUT OF OUR LIVES!|`|fia9gMHpaa	Go out with whomever you want.

If you're worried about what a troll's opinion is on interracial dating, I think you're the one who needs to relax.|`|hL5Kjdk8aa	You are only a sell out if you put down your own race. You are only a sell out if you date those white or hispanic men and tell them how much you "hate" Black men. You are only a sell out if you do not like your own race. Thats pretty much it. Sadly, alot of people DO fall in this category. I cant count how many times a white girl has told me how the Black men she dates talk major mess about Black women. And its true, why should anyone care anyways? Only time we should care is if you were a Black radical like say, the Black Panthers, and dated and married tons of White women in the 60's and 70's. ok let me stop.|`|AA11059890	my dear that depends entirely on who ya talk to, some (like my good buddy seaworld) would most certainly see that in you others not so much, what people have to figure out is that none of it matters, all it comes down to is what you can live with and what ya can't, you figure that bein' with a white fella is a good idea than that's for you to say, if ya want to stay within your own race again same deal, you can make any number of choices but in the end you're the one that has to live with the results|`|s3pkflYdaa	Its not being a sell out at all, you like you like.  so don't let ignorant people tell you otherwise.|`|oOR511mFaa	NO!!!!! I LOVE black people, I am 25 and all my life  i have only dated white men. Why? Because in my experience they were the only ones that liked me. Black men have deemed me "too skinny" when actually im just slender. White men love me, so i love them back. Im also from the suburbs and a lot of black people don't like the fact that i "talk proper" *rolling eyes*. If they were wise they would see that i am just a product of my environment. I'm still black and i still love black people. Black Brits talk with British accents. Does that make them any less black? NO.Don't worry about it girl, people who see you for anything less than what you are, are ignorant fools and they deserve no attention WHATSOEVER.    Eazy- LOOOOL you cant be serious? Hahaaa youre crazy.|`|AA10698792	I look at it this way...it's hard enough to find someone you want to spend more than an hour with much less the rest of your life, so why limit your options by sticking with only one race or one hair colour or one body type or whatever?    Small minded people are always going to have something negative to say...I've been the target of these kinds of comments more than once myself...but they are just that, small minded people who don't know you or know anything about you and are to be ignored.  I'm sure they will find someone just as small minded as they are and raise tons of small minded children.|`|ncdTxID9aa	People can only speak for their damn selves on why they date who they date.  They don't worry about Inneracial couples, like they are perfect.  SO why worry about interracial couples?  Just because you date within your race doesn't mean they isn't a motive behind you being with that person.  I've seen people date inneracially and inter racially for superficial reasons.  I feel culture, religion, and moral value is important for relationships, race is just the an equation.|`|3cLA6wCWaa	You will always get "looks". But we can't control that, so no real need to concern ourselves with it.    I've had to deal with this from my extended family but I just turn their ignorance back on them because I'm never one to keep my mouth shut.    So ya, in a perfect world people wouldn't trip. But this world is far from perfect so I keep it moving.|`|9MRSjkkxaa	People are messed up. I have never dated inside my race. Right now i am with a Dominican and i am white. I dont hate my race at all, i dont hate any race but im not attracted to girls in ym race.

IR is contemptuous.    edit: YOU BLACK SELL OUTS ARE THE ABOMINATION OF OUR RACE. GET SOME SELF ESTEEM AND PRIDE. GET SOME HELP.|`|6MdwF1rTaa	I'll give a perfect example of the sell out theory, although I could care less what the reason, you love who love, right?    My god parents are IR, my god father black my god mother white. Now both of them dated people of their own race but the relationships were awful, abuse, drugs, lies, cheating...you name it, it happened. And it isn't that they hate their race, they just met through some friends and hit it off. But they had bad experiences with people of their own race and some of the haters say that those are the reasons why. They have been together since before I was born and I'm 25, they are very happy, in-love and very successful.     The only reason you need is love though and if people don't like it or understand it who cares, they don't live your life you do so enjoy it.    Good Luck!|`|CvSKPHiqaa	yeh man, its 2009 which means we should take our clothes off and skateboard everywhere.....woohoo!!....oh yeh and IR date....yeah|`|DNxsqJUFaa	yes you are|`|YAVuWAg9aa	Why would you care about an ignorant's person opinion?

ewWUFWyWaa	Good question... but do you know the answer?    You probably heard the name of "SLAUGHTER HOUSE RELIGION" given to Christianity. ALL Christians need to snack God the Son Jesus Christ in some way as part of the salvation package. Jesus talked about eating his meat and drinking his blood to have eternal life     John 6:53 (Infallible King James Version) Then Jesus said unto them, Verily, verily, I say unto you, Except ye eat the flesh of the Son of man* (*Jesus Christ), and drink his blood, ye have no life in you.    It takes years of Christian Bible schooling to learn how to do it just right or Christians can get real sick and die! Protestants have relaxed this warning, but Catholics still believe that the host and wine is magically transformed into the ACTUAL meat and blood of Jesus so extraordinary measures are taken after Mass to monitor that no trace of the body of Jesus Christ is found in any spent chewing gum stuck under the church pews!      1 Corinthians 1:29-30 (infallible King James Version of the Bible) For he that eateth and drinketh unworthily, eateth and drinketh damnation to himself, not discerning the Lord's body. For this cause many are weak and sickly among you, and many sleep* (*have died).    The Bible story says that most of the Jewish followers of Jesus wouldnt stomach so much grossness and quit following him. The Bible writers still had the idea of having Jesus meat beaten to a pulp thoroughly tenderized and heavily marinated in Roman soldiers spit as the dignified spotless Lamb of God taking away the sins of the world while grotesquely hanging nailed to a Holy Cross! Today ALL Christians and Catholics snack on Jesus spit flavored meat and drink his Holy Blood in the Sacrament of the Holy Communion to go to Heaven when they die!     There is more brutal violence in the Bible than in any TV show. The Bible writers have this God character rewarding people committing the most heinous crimes as long as they do it to further his cause! Islam copied the same idea from the Bible! All the Bible writers picked heroes based on their past bloody criminal performance like Moses, Samson, King David, Saint Paul, just to mention a few. Even the King James Version of the Bible promotes the killing of infants in its fullest CONTEXT! Most Fundie Preachers on the low end of the IQ scale will tell you that the Bible is full of parables and that it cant be taken literally... short of seriously! It takes many years of schooling and practice to become a professional preacher! They ALL learn how to cover up, give thumbs down and explain away anything objectionable in the Bible! The Bible is obviously of human origin.  Making a statement that it was dictated by a God who claims to be full of wrath all the time is an insult to people with a respectable IQ!    Psalm 137:8-9 - O Daughter of Babylon, doomed to destruction, happy is he who repays you for what you have done to us- he who seizes your infants and dashes them against the rocks.    The Bible teaches that the enemies of God ought to be killed in their infancy when it is easier to get rid of them (Amen?)! The old Bible strategy of birth control is not abortion, but the killing of infants AFTER THEY ARE BORN and before they grow up and become a menace to Gods chosen people developing WMD or what have you that not even God can defeat!  (Judges 1:19)    Revelation 2:23 (NIV) (Jesus Christ says in his apocalyptic REVELATION for the last days) I WILL STRIKE HER CHILDREN DEAD* (*Just for the heck of it! No abortionist can beat Jesus at killing babies! (Amen?!) This time it is Sweet Jesus killing the innocent children to announce his 2nd coming and at the same time to teach everybody in the Churches a lesson on WHO IS THE BOSS! In our society today Jesus would be in jail for promoting the KILLING OF CHILDREN to favor a particular religion. Thats why the Preachers are so selective in what they teach from the Bible! They came up with the PRO-LIFE bit on their own to dissociate themselves from this REVELATION, and from the routine slaying of children in the Bible, and whats even grosser yet about cooking and eating them for dinner! All this forced on Gods chosen people for his pleasure! Christianity is a slaughter house religion. No question about it! The Bible writers were very creative about how to call religious peoples attention!) Then ALL THE CHURCHES WILL KNOW that I am he who searches hearts and minds, and I will repay each of you according to your deeds.* (*Not even the Mafia bosses measure up to this Jesus Christ in the Bible! Christians may expose the Mafia, but they surely LOVE JESUS! And they cover up for him!)     The story of Jesus was written long after he died. He is said to be the greatest religious teacher ever known in the world. Jesus suggested the slaughter by drowning in the middle of the sea of anybody causing a Christian who is a moron in the Faith to stumble (Mat 18:6). He also suggested the voluntary shedding of offending body parts like an eye, arm, leg or what have you to follow him (Mat 18:8), including male castration (Mat 19:12). Anything to make it into the Kingdom of Heaven! Today no teacher cares to be as great as Jesus was or he/she may end up in jail! Most Christians today dont pay attention to Jesus Christs gory suggestions, but throughout the Christian dominated Dark Ages some prominent clergy persons castrated themselves for the Kingdoms sake! Many witches and slaves were abused and killed here in this ONE NATION UNDER GOD, too! (Google Salem witches and castrati in Wikipedia!) So good luck in your quest for the truth and intellectual satisfaction or are you after the peace of mind that only religion can offer? Even Jesus says, thou shalt know the truth and the truth shalt set thee free!|`|bc6MlMyoaa	No to all.|`|A01w1dHqaa	I'm already there. It's within me.|`|DRSv6SOLaa	Absolutely!!

For better or for worse ill stick to my guns.    Religion is a man made creation to cope with things that humans can not possibly understand. Lets travel back thousands of years when man worshiped the sun and rain gods. It was because they didnt understand the origin of these phenomenon.    In current days man worships a more complicated god to cope with the more complicated questions of what is the meaning of life and the origin of life.    dont get me wrong i have no disdain for the religious, its just not my cup of tea.|`|EkLJDcc7aa	I believe Jesus will forgive me for my sins, and accept me in heaven.

8KxurcApaa	Using Apple's misguided stat that just under 80% of America is white that gives the US (303 million pop.) over 240 million white citizens.  Assuming our main competition for white citizens would be Canada & European countries, Russia would come second with 142 million citizens (assuming they are all white). [Edit: I started the math before you posted your updated - didn't mean to be redundant]<br>  <br>  I don't think that our racial problems are a result of the sheer number of white citizens ... South Africa has very comparable problems and their white citizenship is very limited.  Instead I think that because we are so diverse and because of our history we have alot more problems along race lines than other countries. <br>  <br>  Also, there is conflict in other countries but the lines may not be as simplistic as race.  In the South Ossetia area the Georgians citizens & those considering themselves to be Russian citizens bomb & invade each other but they are all white so far as I can see.|`|Yi7AR18qaa	According to the CIA World Fact-book, America has a 79.96% of white people.|`|qvuQSQvpaa	probably russia. and  yea. it is becuz we one of the more diverse nations in the world that makes it that way.|`|IhCfOMzTaa	maybe i don't know.|`|2z24zmsmaa	i think so.............|`|JXMVNEQoaa	the answer is yes, next in line is russia or brazil if you count them as white|`|rsg0zBT6aa	I think so, but I can't be sure...

JCGtfNeTaa	You could show the professor how the archeological evidence supports the book you used for your report. You could point out that even though lots of people said that your book was not true, because it mentioned people that we found no record of (such as the Hittites), a later dig revealed evidence of such people. You could point out that people claimed that your book was not true because it mentioned kings that were not known to exist, or that it was thought a different king ruled at that time, but later archeological excavations shown that your book was true. You could point out that not one single archeological dig disproves your book, but that thousands and thousands of digs supports your book.    You could point out to your professor that having 30 or 40 manuscript evidence would be just amazing because usually you would have only maybe a half-dozen or if you're really lucky, a dozen manuscripts. But, that for YOUR book, you have THOUSANDS of manuscripts that show the authenticity of your book.    You could point out to your professor the fact that secular historians describe people and events that your book talks about.    You could point out to your professor the fact that your book told of things that would happen before it would happen, to great detail, and that every one happened exactly as prophesied.    You could present OVERWHELMING EVIDENCE to your professor about your book.    But your professor would refuse to consider the evidence, and would rather believe in the superstition of Spontaneous Generation, that everything just *poofed* came from nothing; because science has demonstrated that the universe had a beginning.|`|bb06GQ5Paa	No.|`|KWwW7N49aa	Your professor doubts and has not faith in you.  We don't doubt but believe by faith that the Scriptures are of God.|`|FDsopi1Taa	Well, you would if it was a math book.|`|k03dYskYaa	I could use historians, proven science, and archaeology to prove the book was correct. And if the professor did not accept that I would question my enrollment in the class.  The Bible is proven true by the positive influence it's had on people's lives. Also by fulfilled prophecy, history, science, and archaeology.|`|dL4x119gaa	it doesn't matter what we think about the correctness of the book.    some guy with a piece of paper that says he knows what he's talking about tells them every sunday that the book is right...|`|c981080a505c06221f237c3acf97f037aa	Thank God THE professor that wrote the Bible created science and all else.He also created mercy and most of all LOVE.That's why I feel so sorry for all of those that reject the One true God Jesus the great I AM.But you have to say they won't have an excuse when they stand before the Great White Throne of Judgment because they read it here.|`|9mLOH7bpaa	Well said.|`|MrLdBraoaa	Yes you could.

If it were the book than hopefully a loving, all powerful, moral God would literally give it to the ENTIRE world.  Not just Paul and friends. Come on only 1/3 of the world loves the Good book, because the world is big and book, it's not that good.|`|YdjX5fOWaa	Well any book that says that doesn't sound like a very valid book.  I think what your professor is looking for is another book or source that backs up the original source that you are using.  So if you are siting the bible for something, let's say a letter by Paul, find a book that was maybe written about Paul's letters or that part of the bible that backs up what you are trying to prove.|`|PNwr3JgBaa	That is one thing I always found funny about Christians. They use a ancient book full of contradictions written by early man, that didn't know how the world works around them as fact.

I read your profile and saw that you said you have leukemia. Im 15. Last december (2007) I was tookin to my local hospital and then rushed to a hospital in missouri (i live in illinois) because they said my white blood cell count was waayyy to high. So they told me that I had the possibility of having leukemia. Well i stayed at the hospital for a week cause i was waiting for my blood sample came in. I left the hospital with them telling me that i have leukemia. That month was living hell for me. They were making me take some medicine (cant remember what), and some how that medicine screwed me up and i had to go to the hospital.. Again. Well to make a long story long, they told me that i didn't have Leukemia, and they don't know why my white blood cell count was extremely high. I now take life and live it to its full potential knowing it can be tookin away from me in a blink of a eye.  You Inspire me. Live life to its full potential because you are a Beautiful girl. And good luck.  :-)
fc4U6217aa	It says in the bible that the wager of sin is death. If you commit sin you will die. But Jesus came and died for you so that you may have eternal life. In heaven....

And before I tell you why let me tell you this:  I am not a Catholic, I was raised Catholic and my Dad went to a Catholic School, but we have both seen some major issues with that branch of religion.  Anyways, I think it is true that if its our time it's our time.  We CHOOSE tto come to Earth before we are born and choose to live in this difficult world.  We come to do something to help someone or effect something or learn something for ourselves, or all of those things.  When we are done, why would our spirits want to live in the Heck???  especially when we can watch over and help our family, be in no pain/suffering, or expirience negitivity on the other side?|`|AA12203324	So all those car and plane crashes are just God murdering people because they're "done"?|`|7xHfvMIZaa	Yes, in a way.

I would like to think that before I die I have served some purpose in this world, in life, in my life (or in others).  Have you ever read the book, "Five People You Meet in Heaven"?  It's a really great book.  It has a wonderful idea that when you die you meet five people in heaven that has had some impact on your life/or you have had some impact on theirs.  You should check it out.|`|rwbUF975aa	Everyone die at different times because they have come to the end of their life span or in an accident situation, they have been selected by chance to die (just like the numbers being selected by chance during the lottery). This is the answer to believe in a world where almost everything happens by chance. - A theory    Another theory is that people die at different times because they didn't belong in the environment they lived in. They were waiting in this life to go to a bigger cause, or worse. When good young people die, these people are reborn in a better place on this earth for better parents and family. When the intended woman is just about to coenceive, the person dies to be born again to a mother.|`|oBmLIDHtaa	No - I would say that is highly improbable.|`|VqWHQL2Waa	people die cuz they just aint strong enough to live...just see the sick people who are in hospitals and are on machines that are keeping them alive, without those machines their dead cuz they aint strong enough...like if an accident happens to someone and they were able to recover from surgery, means that they are strong enough to survive. but there are some cases where some people get some sort of illness like cancer or something that their life has already has a time table on it, there are ways to cure that nowadays but you can only get so many ways, when the body is not strong enough itll die..and some people also die cuz they are old which also means that getting old and getting weaker, no more regenaration of cells and tissues and again not strong enough to regenerate so itll die eventually...

W0rcm3awaa	Actually statistically speaking the majority of women who have 'unwanted pregnancies' and go in to have an abortion used absolutely no form of birth control/condoms/what have you.    Also i don't think in our society that condoms are a 'stigma', most things in our society are acceptable now a days, there are still some hurdles we need to cross but condoms is not one of them, we talk about them all the time on popular tv shows and in movies.    Also yea, just don't have sex - its that simple. I mean the 3% of rape victims who actually get pregnant they can have abortions (rape is about power not sex so most men don't actually ejaculate during it) and if the womans life is in danger yea, but cosmetic abortion is ridiculous. It's very dangerous for the woman, i mean thats my main reason for being against it. You can say its her choice but some people choose to cut themselves or do drugs, choice doesn't make it right.   Here's a list of complications: http://www.abortionfacts.com/literature/...    It's more natural and safer to just give birth to the baby. Some women have died in legal abortions or lost their uterus and 2/3 can never give a live birth ever again. Women need to be protected from this.    ---edit---  The thing is that i very well know that in other countries birth control isn't available but abortion is - however what is the excuse in america where you can buy condoms and birth control in every corner drug store? Most people still just don't use any form of protection! It's not that 'oh its not available' its 'oh we didn't use any'.     Also clearly i'm not christian, i'm not using religion, i'm using logic.|`|YkseyT7zaa	By being Catholic|`|WO1jgqWqaa	I'm not anti-condom; I'm anti-stupid people who think that condoms are fool proof.

Face it, nutters, teenagers are going to have sex.|`|AA11177214	If you are Catholic, then either of these is against official Catholic dogma.  The reason the Catholic Church is against condoms is because they believe every sperm is sacred, and if God meant for you to get pregnant, or get someone pregnant, then you will.|`|3GAiVmEAaa	Easy, some pro-lifers just think that everyone should be a good Christian and if they are naughty and have sex it is their own fault for being dirty.    Some people just have ridiculous ideas about sex. THere are benefits other than babies. Sorry if you can't enjoy that but don't attempt to make me feel dirty or bad just because you don't agree.    Give people the knowledge to make smart decisions. Give them support and options if they mess up or have bad luck.    ADD: Married couples use brith control and have abortions too. Not everyone wants to start a family the second they get married, and not everyone should!!|`|lYQDCJgeaa	The anti-condom thing is not far removed from the anti-masturbation thing.    It all comes down to the injunction to be fruitflies and multiply. (Ok, I know it's "fruitful," but I could not resist.)    Sex is intended to increase the tribe. That made sense when babies died almost as often as they lived, mothers frequently died in childbirth, and children were needed not only to perpetuate the tribe but also as unpaid labor to herd the sheep, gather the crops, etc.    The bible never took into account that one day the world would increase in population, that resources are not infinite and that we could increase life expectancy and reduce infant and perinatal mortality rates through medical science.    Teenagers got married at 14, and immediately began reproducing, until they died, sooner or later. Birth control seemed counterproductive then (biblical times) and it was.    TIMES HAVE CHANGED!    Teens no longer marry when the hormones kick in. They will have sex. They always have, "allowed" or not.  Married people will have sex, and not always WANT a baby.    Birth control is also imperative to gender equality. Biology becomes destiny if a woman cannot control her pregnancies.    Those who would enslave women to their wombs, turn them into unwilling incubators or else prohibit them from sex (men have always had sex freely, without fear of impregnation) would oppose all forms of birth control.    This is true of fundie Catholics and Jews, alike.    Abortion is never going to end until safe and reliable birth control is available to every fertile person.    EDIT: Had to reply to Buddhist:  WHERE do you get your info?  2/3 women who have abortions can't have more babies? NOT TRUE. I've known a number of women who have, and ALL of them had babies later, when they were in a position to welcome them. (One I know had FOUR more! BY CHOICE!)    ALSO, it is NOT safer to go to full term with a pregnancy. If that was the case, always, then there would be no need for therapeutic abortion. Some women should not go to term at all. No one can tell me that 9 months of physical stress is less dangerous than 2 months, or that shoving a baby throguh your vagina or having a caeserean delivery is less dangerous than a properly, legally performed vacuum aspiration.    and finally, HOW did you ever get the idea that men who commit rape do not ejaculate? Motives do not make the body less responsive. If a man gets off on power, he GETS OFF on it! And yes, I've known women who were raped and got pregnant.    What world do you live in? Get real.|`|AA11796124	>    Being anti-abortion does not mandate being pro-condem.  Truth be told, both abortion and artificial contraception are absolutely immoral.    It makes sense because the proper Christian, being anti-abortion/anti-condem is also pro-abstinence/chastity.      >    The failure of people to properly use artificial birth control, and the tendancy for artificial birth control to fail on it's own leads to pregnancies that end up being aborted.    Abstinence is 100% guaranteed not to lead to unintended pregnancies, and it makes the use of artificial birth control irrelevant.    That is how an anti-abortionist can also be anti-artificial birth control.|`|GEfUTyi8aa	bingo... another bible buster... star for you!|`|1286cbbdaec7b88444188ebc8781d6d6aa	Abstinence.

When you use condums you are saying, "I trust you, but not enough to have kids with ... I don't have faith, hope, or love at this level".  So, then the act of sex then gets reduced to an "Itch" and in the vows of "Totally, Freely, Faithfully, and Fruitfully ... well, your saying with your actions that you don't give yourself totally ... everything but your seed ... freely; you don't see life as free ... faithfully; you don't have faith in yourself (to raise kids), faith in your sexual partner, nor faith in God (to lead you what sex produces; life) ... fruitfully; you don't think your sperm or your partners eggs should create life.    Certainly, if sex is just an "Itch" then the condom may truly reflect what the meaning of life is for you.|`|JjoBtLjbaa	People are stupid  People are dumb  People are idiots aren't they all    People are stupid  People are dumb  People are idiots we all know some.|`|b8e3dd68b7fdbbbac6132e0c73015651aa	anti-sex.

Which would mean...you don't need a condom. My husband and I use the calendar..I've only been pregnant twice...they were planned, and we quit using the calendar...he's got some strong little swimmers..I'll give him that.    and just some FYI...the bible does not in anyway state that sex is just for procreation...the bible makes it very very clear, sex is to be enjoyed, it is to be a way of showing your husband and wife your love, and commitment and selflessness to them. it is fully meant to be enjoyed, and there are to be no questions with it, no worries with it...."oh no! did the condom break?" "Oh no did I take my pill?" "Oh no! does he/she have a disease?" etc etc etc. its suppose to be the most meaningful act between a man and a woman, and the most meaningful act cannot be with someone who is here today, gone tomorrow.    and yes this does mean I fully disagree with divorce. And yes..I know there is abusive marriages, etc...however, God did not intend for a perfect marriage to be that way...when a marriage is done the way God planned it "Husbands love your wives as Christ loved the church" "Wives respect your husbands and Christ respected the church" then marriages would work the way they should. and lets face it..I've been in an abusive relationship, I speak from experience...they show signs of it well before they propose..so...don't marry them!|`|QmMbRnc0aa	I'm not anti-condom. I believe sex isn't just for pro-creation either - its something meant to be fun as well! God specifically made us - look at animals - to them its just procreation.

uuUd5Zidaa	Salam brother,    Us as human beings are not able to determine who is most qualified among us, for we do not know everything. Therefore it can only be Allah that knows who best fits the role of a leader, and therefore, only Prophet knew who is best.     The prophet, to Shia belief, appointed Imam Ali (AS) as successor because he knew he is most qualified. It is for this reason that shia follow Imam Ali (not because he is his cousin and son-in-law).    The time when Abu Baker and Umar and a few others decided who will lead the Islamic Ummah, Ali was not around, and even Abu Baker apologized to him for not including him in the decision process.     So even if, lets say, the holy prophet did not appoint Ali as his successor, then why was he not considered to be a potential leader, or was even given a chance to contribute in the decision, for all the sahaba of the holy prophet knew the value of Ali because the prophet made it clear about his importance, even in Sunni references:    Prophet says:  " He wants to see Noah in his detemination, Adam in his knowledge, Abraham in his clemincy, Moses in his intelligence, and Jesus in his religious devotion, should look at Ali Ibin Abi Talib" (Sahih Al-Bayhaqi)    "There is amongst you a person who will fight for the interpetation of the Quran just as i fought for revelation, Abu Baker and Umar were there, both asked the prophet if it was them, and the Prophet said no, it is the one who is repairing my shoes, Ali" (Al Mustadrahk by Al Hakim)    [these are sunni sources]    This and many more things the holy prophet says about Ali, everyone knew how important he was, so why was he not given a chance.|`|vwFf2ftcaa	Ghasibs????wow my vocabulary is growing.|`|bZo5Z53Uaa	Subhan'Allah, bro as a Muslim we believe so that everything is Decreed right?

"Allah, the Most Holy, the Most High, has said, "O Muhammad I have created you and Ali a light, a spirit, without body before I created My heavens, My earth, My Throne, and My ocean. You continued acknowledge Me as youre the Lord and speak of My glory. I then collected the spirits of both of you and made it one spirit. This spirit continued to speak of My Glory, My Holiness and acknowledge Me as the Lord. I then divided it into two and two which became four: one Muhammad one Ali, al-Hassan and al-Husayn the two of them.

Mnm35sjNaa	Although Pope Pius XII was personally against the Nazi persecution of the Jews, he acted to protect them only when he felt it safe to.  In a politically calculated stance, he enforced Vatican neutrality on WWII in order to enhance the churchs position in case the Nazis prevailed.  His fear of Nazi reprisals muzzled his public voice and led him to abdicate moral leadership in favor of Vatican security.  I say "Vatican security" instead of "Catholic security" because Catholics were in fact persecuted by the millions (in Europe) and routinely imprisoned and killed without much public complaint from the Vatican.  Pius protected the churchs power instead of its adherents.  His was, essentially, a cowardly administration during the worlds darkest hour.  The times called for strength and courage but Pius delivered politics and tacit acquiescence to Hitlers regime and atrocities.    The Vatican (Pope Pius XII) was complicit by its silence.  The refusal to act IS an action.  The following pattern shows tacit acquiescence to Hitler's regime:    ????From 1940 to his 1942 Christmas eve message, although informed of Nazi atrocities in: Austria, Lithuania, Poland, Spain and the Ukraine (including deportations to death camps), Pope Pius XII made no public comments about the atrocities.    ????In November, 1938, Pope Pius XII issued no public criticism of the well-publicized Nazi attacks of Kristallnacht synagogues and Jewish businesses.    ????Pope Pius XII refused to join a resolution of the Allies condemning the Nazi crimes.    ????Pope Pius XII never condemned the Catholics who participated in the slaughter of Jews.    ????Pope Pius XII never excommunicated any Nazi, although he did excommunicate some German Catholics who supported cremation as an alternative to burial.    ????Pope Pius XII never explicitly spoke out against Hitler until one month after the war ended (in a speech to the College of Cardinals).    Although Pius did much "behind the scenes" to fight the persecution of Jews (and even his own Catholic adherents), it wasn't nearly enough.  He could have done a lot more to stem the tide of suffering.|`|D9lMg7A2aa	It is certain now that the Church not only was not complicit but that it acted heroically in the matter.     I will give you 3 Jewish testimonies.     1) The chief Rabbi of Rome at the time Eugenio Zolli    His 1954 memoir Before the Dawn describes the details of his conversion and explains his deep admiration for Pope Pius XII. It was reissued by Ignatius Press in 2008.     2) Rabbi David G. Dalin, a professor of History and Political Science at Floridas Ave Maria University and author of the new book, The Myth of Hitler's Pope: How Pope Pius XII Rescued Jews from the Nazis says that  Pope Pius protected and defended the Jews during World War II .    "It is an abominable slander he said, to spread blame that belongs to Hitler and the Nazis to a pope who was a friend of the Jews."     He also points out that there is ample evidence that the Pope personally sheltered nearly 5,000 Jews in the Vatican and nearby monasteries and convents during the Nazi occupation of Rome.     3) The Jewish group Pave the Way   http://www.ptwf.org/index.htm|`|OI7eeIreaa	The pope lifted the excommunication of a couple right-wing popes in hopes of bringing them back into the fold and avoiding further embarrassing schism.  The point was that the pope wanted them to change their kookie views and come back to the Catholic church.  He was hoping the carrot would work since the stick (of excommunication) hasn't been effective.  Also, don't confuse Catholic and all Christians.|`|g4AAZRuxaa	Probably.|`|6t76bgS3aa	the vatican's not scared to admit the holocaust happened.  the pope just spoke out against the holocaust a few days ago.|`|WUjlEuTtaa	They admit it happened, they just don't like discussing any part in it they may have had..|`|93galWG1aa	You do know 3 million catholics died in the Camps? thousands of nuns and priests also?

It happened. Period. I don't think they are denying it happened, and certainly want to distance themselves from it, because they probably were somewhat complicit in the whole thing.    But more importantly, it's in the past. While we should never forget that it happened, so it isn't allowed to happen again, but genocides ARE happening right now, so gee, fat lot of good that had done, we need to stop dwelling on the past, and worry about the here and now.    Why isn't anyone gripping that the Vatican hasn't come out in condemnation of what's happening in Darfur? Why hasn't anyone REALLY gone there to stop that genocide?|`|zZxX5PXBaa	As I read it, the Vatican's position on the holocaust was clear, until this recent failure to explicitly condemn the bishop who denies that 6 million died. I agree that the Vatican's response to the bishop's recent statement is pretty lame, and that it cuts against other clear denunciations of the Holocaust. For sure there is a lot of dirty linen in the Vatican's closet, and in Cardinal Ratzinger's too. Given that Holocaust denial is a crime, and that Ratzinger is German, it's understandable that Merkel has asked her question.    But that's current political controversy, and I don't get any sense that anyone is impressed by this idiot bishop's statement other than, presumably, the people he was aiming to please. For what reason he wants to please Holocaust deniers ... let his own conscience answer, but we can guess it may be antisemitism, or he feels it will get publicity for some book or speaking tour, or whatever. Perhaps he will have the courage to repeat it on German soil and we'll see what it does for his career then, but you kind of guess, don't you, that that won't happen.    The broader issue you raise is not easy. There were plenty of protestants who supported Hitler too. There were both German protestants and German catholics who died for their opposition to Nazism. As you say, antisemitic violence went on for centuries beforehand, and didn't stop in 1945 either. Kielce was in 1946. And yes, the Christians who demonised Jews were not limited to Germany by a long shot, and it remains an international problem for the church, with outspoken redneck fascists in small minority, but a greater number still who mostly don't speak, but who sympathise with antisemitism, and only very carefully let those views be heard.|`|AA11440601	"Pius XII? This is the only human being who has always contradicted me and who has never obeyed me." Adolf Hitler --- from Hans Jansen's The Silent Pope? (2000)     In October 1958 in front of the United Nations General Assembly, Golda Meir, the Prime Minister of Israel, said of Pope Pius XII at his death :     ''During the 10 years of Nazi terror, when our people went through the horrors of martyrdom, the Pope raised his voice to condemn the persecutors and commiserate with their victims.''     Some of the Jewish organizations that praised Pope Pius XII at the time of his death for saving Jewish lives during the horror of the Nazi Holocaust were:   + The World Jewish Congress  + The American Jewish Committee  + The American Jewish Congress  + The Anti-Defamation League  + The Central Conference of American Rabbis  + The National Conference of Christians and Jews  + The National Council of Jewish Women.  + The New York Board of Rabbis  + The Rabbinical Council of America  + The Synagogue Council of America    No serious scholar contests the evidence that Pius XII took direct and indirect measures to save Jews from the Nazi death machine.    At the start of World War II, Pope Pius XIIs first encyclical was so anti-Hitler that the Royal Air Force and the French air force dropped 88,000 copies of it over Germany. Here is a link to the Summi Pontificatus: Encyclical of Pope Pius XII on the Unity of Human Society, October 20, 1939: http://www.vatican.va/holy_father/pius_x...

"Only the Church stood squarely across the path of Hitler's campaign for suppressing truth. I never had any special interest in the Church before, but now I feel a great affection and admiration because the Church alone has had the courage and persistence to stand for intellectual truth and moral freedom.

I'm sure some were, or thought they were. Hitler was apparently raised Catholic but he did not follow the Catholic faith.  A little known fact is that 3 million Catholics were killed in concentration camps too. Many Catholics especially priests, were targeted by the Nazis. Pope Pius XII was actually one of the only high level person to speak out against the Nazis and yet he is being villified by haters of Catholicism. http://www.fisheaters.com/hitler.html...    That Pope Pius XII saved 800,000 Jewish lives, hiding Jews in monasteries, convents, and inside the Vatican itself; that he got to the Jews money for travel; that he issued fake baptismal certificates so they could pass as Christian; that he was praised by Jews at the end of the war (by everyone from Golda Meir to the Communist Albert Einstein) as a "righteous gentile"; that his was called by the New York Times the only voice among the silence on the topic of the Jewish persecutions; that the Chief Rabbi of Rome was so impressed by this Pope's holiness and heroism toward his fellow Hebrews that he took his name when he converted to Catholicism.     Tell that to the RAF as well they risked their lives droping pamplets written by the Pope aginst Hitler and the Nazi party.        When Luther turned his attention to the Jews, after he completed his translation of the Bible, he left behind "on the Jews and their Lies" for posterity.     Many people confess their amazement that Hitler preaches ideas which they have always held.... From the Middle Ages we can look to the same example in Martin Luther. What stirred in the soul and spirit of the German people of that time, finally found expression in his person, in his words and deeds.   -"Geist und Kampf" (speech), Bundesarchiv Berlin-Zehlendorf, [cited from Richard Steigmann-Gall's  The Holy Reich]       Hans Hinkel, a Nazi who worked in Goebbels' Reich Chamber of Culture said  Through his acts and his spiritual attitude he began the fight which we still wage today; with Luther the revolution of German blood and feeling against alien elements of the Volk was begun.     Erich Koch, the Reich Commissioner for Ukraine and President of the East Prussian Protestant Church Synod wrote:  Only we can enter into Luther's spirit.... Human cults do not set us free from all sin, but faith alone. With us the church shall become a serving member of the state.... There is a deep sense that our celebration is not attended by superficiality, but rather by thanks to a man who saved German cultural values.   -Konigsberg-Hartungsche Zeitung, 20 Nov. 1933,     Bernhard Rust served as Minister of Education in Nazi Germany. He wrote:  Since Martin Luther closed his eyes, no such son of our people has appeared again. It has been decided that we shall be the first to witness his reappearance.... I think the time is past when one may not say the names of Hitler and Luther in the same breath. They belong together; they are of the same old stamp [Schrot und Korn].   -Volkischer Beobachter, 25 Aug. 1933,     Hans Schemm became Bavarian Minister of Education and Culture. Throughout the Reich, Germans particularly knew Schemm for his slogan, "Our religion is Christ, our politics Fatherland!" He writes:   His engagement against the decomposing Jewish spirit is clearly evident not only from his writing against the Jews; his life too was idealistically, philosophically antisemitic. Now we Germans of today have the duty to recognize and acknowledge this.   -"Luther und das Deutschtum," Bundesarchiv Berlin-Zehlendorf (19 Nov. 1933: Berlin),     Our confession to God is a confession of a doctrine of totality.... To give ultimate significance to the totalities of race, resistance and personality there is added the supreme totalitarian slogan of our Volk: "Religion and God." God is the greatest totality and extends over all else.   -(Gertrud Kahl-Furthmann (ed.), Hans Schemm spricht: Seine Reden und sein Werk (Bayreuth, 1935),     Julius Streicher (one of Hitler's top henchmen and publisher of the anti-Semitic Der Sturmer) was asked during the Nuremberg trials if there were any other publications in Germany which treated the Jewish question in an anti-Semitic way., Streicher put it well  Dr. Martin Luther would very probably sit in my place in the defendants' dock today, if this book had been taken into consideration by the Prosecution. In the book 'The Jews and Their Lies,' Dr. Martin Luther writes that the Jews are a serpent's brood and one should burn down their synagogues and destroy them..."      Indeed, no historian has yet to put Martin Luther on trial for his incitement of crimes against humanity.  Today, white-supremacists and Neo-Nazis continue to spread Luther's Jewish hatred and use quotes from this book as "proof" of their convictions. I trust that readers will see the horror and danger of Luther's book and will realize the potential threat that might come from belief in its words.       Well lets see  some of the things that were born from the bible alone. We must start with the origin Martin Luther and where His own understanding and interpittaion of the bible have brought us. We will start from the beginning and see the ramifications. Simply stated millions dead because of his beliefs. Divisions upon divisions untruth upon untruth. Well some say he was a hero especially The german people. He was made a national Hero. He ushered in the fine Protestants A word coined by the Germans you know the likes of Bishop,  Ludwig Mueller country's Reich Bishop of the Protestant Church Appointed By Hitler.  .Many German Christians at first openly welcomed Hitlers Nazi party to power as a historic moment of Christs work on earth through and for the

eb4e977a0cb9ce50b08bf74f0f3a0c61aa	Here is truth - read and understand.   1. Vampires, defined as a humanoid being that MUST consume blood or energy to survive do not exist. Cut and paste time, as it is too much work to type this out over and over and I "recycle" my own answers instead of retyping them so here goes. A brief discussion of the human digestive system and then the probable vampire population given an exponential growth rate should explain why vampires are not possible.     2. The human body is not designed to process large amounts of blood for nutrition. There is not enough protein, carbohydrates, and fats present in blood to maintain a complex creature such as Homo Sapiens or any theorized offshoot mutations. When a human ingests food it is first broken up by chewing, then churned up in the stomach with digestive juices to form a bolus called chyme. It then passes into the small intestine where it mixes with bile salts which continue breaking it down on a molecular basis, mostly affecting fats at this point. The broken down nutrients pass through the wall of the intestines and into the bloodstream where they are carried to each cell or stored for later use. Indigestible bulk continues through the intestines, turning a dark brown from the bile. Water is absorbed from this mass in the large intestine depending on the needs of the body - a well-hydrated person will usually have a softer stool than a dehydrated person will. Water also enters the bloodstream, and this is what helps to maintain blood pressure. The pressure tends to balance itself in a healthy person because the bloodstream goes through a formation in the kidney called the Loop of Henle, where the narrowing blood vessel forces excess water and cellular waste such as urea out through the cellular wall into the kidneys, where it is excreted through the ureters into the bladder, and then out of the body via the urethral passageway.    3. IMPORTANT - A person physically unable to process his own food for nutrition therefore also could not process blood - it's the same process. Ingested blood does not transmit directly to the veins anyway - it would be chemically broken down by the digestive system.    4. Theoretical ingestion of blood to supply these nutrients would therefore have to occur at least once a day, and would require the ingestion of the entire blood supply which could not happen as the stomach is far too small to hold that much liquid volume. Furthermore, such a mass would be difficult to pass thru the intestines as it has no fibrous bulk, would create an intestinal impaction, causing massive vomiting from the large concentration of iron present, and any "real" vampire would have to eventually expel the waste, which would come out as a black, tarry, smelly goo.     5. These humans that affect the whole "vampiric lifestyle" are NOT vampires. They are simply humans playing their own little game, in their own little fantasy world, usually pandering to their own little sexual fetish, which may or may not actually be sexual. I too, play my own little game, in the SCA, but mine is a game where the deeds that I do are determined by the strength of my arm and sword - I am a warrior, with just as much skill and ability as any warrior of ancient times. The difference is that I am claiming to be something physically possible: a warrior, and I prove it everytime I strap on my armor and walk onto a SCA battlefield. The so-called "vampires" are claiming to be something physically impossible: a walking corpse, and all they prove is that black Victorian clothing, a pair of false fangs, and a little makeup make for a good Halloween costume - it does not make you a vampire.    6. Even if a vampire feeds once a week, and his victim also becomes a vampire, that is exponential growth, with four iterations a month. First iteration: One makes one, total two. Second iteration: Two make two, total four. Third iteration: Four make four, total eight. Fourth iteration: Eight make eight, total sixteen. 16 vampires at the end of one month, 256 at the end of the second month, 4096 by the end of the third month, 65,536 by the end of the fourth month, 1,048,476 at the end of the fifth, and 33,572,832 vampires at the end of half a year! By way of comparison, there are currently approximately 33 million people who have HIV/AIDS in the U.S. alone, and the disease is a world-wide epidemic. I see people every day in the hospital with AIDS, but never has there been one documented case of a vampire attack. Do the math - vampires are a mathematical impossibility. As for the idea that vampires existed "a long time ago" consider the estimated global population 5,000 years ago - using the above mathematical rationale, a single vampire could have taken over and converted every human on the globe in less than ten years. This falls therefore, under the logic of Occam's Razor - which states that when you have removed every impossible answer, whatever remains, no matter how improbable, must be the truth. Since there is no "vampiric plague" swarming the earth, the logical deduction is that they don't exist.    7. Point of clarification about "vampire" bats: vampire is simply the name we have given them because they do drink blood, same as a flea, mosquito, or spider. Are these creatures vampires? No. They are living creatures, not legendary monsters. Drinking blood does not make you a vampire anymore than eating raw meat makes you a werewolf, although it might make you a mosquito.    8.The humans who profess to be vampires are victims of an all-encompassing self induced delusion. They are as human as you or I, regardless of their claims, and if they ingest HIV tainted blood they can most certainly contract the disease, esp. if they have any cuts, sores, or lesions in and or around their mouth. It is a very dangerous delusion to be laboring under. Note that there is absolutely no scientific or medical proof that these people derive|`|1wNsBNmxaa	serious only in make believe land nobody can turn you in to a vampire they do not exist just be a human in be happy with your self twilight on the brain is not a good thing     D?mon~~?|`|qEdhPD8Laa	Bearclaw is right about studying a subject from all angles.     When I was a teenager (I'm 44 now), I was interested in vampires and wondered if they might be real, but I had no internet with easy answers. I read what little I could find about serious vampire research in books (Montague Summers, Stephen Kaplan, Norine Dresser).     When I was in college and taking biochemistry, I figured out that blood did not have enough calories to sustain a living person. When I was taking virology, I looked at different families of virus to try to figure out if an unknown virus could cause the changes associated with legendary vampirism. Viruses can hide inside cells and cause nasty reactions such as Herpes sores or shingles outbreaks, so I wondered if they could also cause sensitivity to sunlight. I took a course on the Biology of Aging, and found some evidence that DNA might be able to be altered to slow aging. Still, there is NO evidence to suggest the existence of a vampire virus.    What do you think a real vampire might be like?    Are your assumptions based on fiction, or do you have evidence they could actually exist?     Would you really want to be one?    These are questions you have to ask yourself before you go looking for "real vampires".    The most reliable evidence I've come across for any kind of real vampire is the existence of a large vampire subculture that reaches all over the world. Many people would not call these people "real vampires" because they don't fit the common stereotype for what a vampire would be. They aren't powerful supernatural beings. They're just people with a weird metaphysical energy dependency.    These kinds of "vampires" generally say it is impossible for a non-vampire to be turned into one. They say one has to be born as a "vampire", and it's not worth wishing for anyway.     Sanguinarius.org is one of the oldest, largest, and most respected websites on the vampire subculture. Suscitatio.com has the most extensive data to date on self-professed vampires. Check 'em out for yourself.    - P.|`|m1V5ws73aa	There is no such thing as a real vampire.

Because if you are, don't expect vampires to be gorgeous sparkling superhumans. According to old folklore, vampires are human-like creatures who drink blood. After feasting on blood, their skin becomes bloated and tinged with purple from the vast amounts of blood they drink (Now isn't that just as sexy as Edward Cullen? *sarcasm*) To become a vampire, you get bitten by one. Then you live the rest of your life as a normal person before dying. Once you die, you are buried, and resurrected as a vampire. Vampires can be killed too, with a stake through the heart, or by exposing themselves to sunlight.     That being said, do you really want to be a vampire? Now I don't believe in them, but assuming that they exist, would "some study" really be enough to make such a life changing decision? Are vampires still quite so beautiful and lovable in your eyes? Your "i think" shows that being a vampire is not for you. But like I said, I don't believe in them.         http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vampire|`|jard50Yiaa	This article may be of some interest to you...    http://www.christiananswersforthenewage....|`|GuBF5xhDaa	turning is not remotely possible. they are just normal people with an extra handicap. had you really done research, you would know that.|`|vUFICF6oaa	Just ignore the people who are saying mean stuff.

There are legends that say if you are bitten once by a vampire then you become one. There are also some that say once you are bitten by the same vampire three times, then you become one.     However, in today's society, the closest you will probably get is to buy some prosthetic teeth caps for "fangs," dress in black, stay pale, get some freaky colored contacts, and hit the underground blood bars in places like London or probably big cities like New York or something.

Some are based on a true story but have become so twisted in the telling that there isn't much of the original event left, other's are mostly factual, but most are completely fictional other except for the place in which they are set.    The same goes for how they are started.

WMrNa3Doaa	Assuming that it doesn't have any tags or identifying information with it... I say you should keep it if you like it.    A responsible pet owner would not let their cat run around outside where anything could happen to it. And they certainly wouldn't let it run around without any kind of microchip or tag.    And as far as taking it to the shelter, I wouldn't.  Even if the owner came looking for it, who is to say that they wouldn't just let it get lost again?    My neighbor's cat kept getting stuck in my back yard (fenced in), and after I contacted her and returned it many times, I finally told her if it happened again, I would find the cat another home. It didn't happen again. I didn't want something to happen to the poor little cat just because she had a bad  owner.    EDIT: Well, maybe 3rd time is the charm!! :)|`|AA10948829	It's not your cat. Take it to a shelter so they can take care of him and give the owners the best chance at finding him. Just ask the shelter to contact you if, after X weeks, no one has come by to claim him. If you keep him and just make Craigslist ads / post some fliers, he'll probably never be found.|`|WAoNhHB1aa	Give it to me!  (Not really, lol.  I do want another cat though)    Take it to the vet and see if it has a micro chip.  Did it look well cared for or did it look like a stray?  Then put up posters that say lost cat, but don't put a picture or too much information, because any old freak could call you and say the cat's theirs, but if it's really theirs or they know who it belongs to, then they'd know things you didn't put on the poster.  When they call, ask questions about things not on the poster.  Like my cat Elvis has a funny hiss.  If he got lost, I wouldn't put what his hiss sounded like on the poster.  If somebody called saying they had him, I'd ask what his hiss sounded like and if they correctly described it, then I'd let them bring him to me.  If you do all that and you still have the kitty, keep him-slash-her.

But I also think what we do to rats is immoral.|`|g4AAZRuxaa	Yes it would be immoral.|`|wuPTBIIuaa	according to some clones dont have spirits and therefore they dont have life!    and if cloning (farming) for body parts becomes legal, i think it would be because science can do it and people will want it, to pay for it, and that they have "enough" money to do it.     i wonder how Jesus created a NEW EYE for the blind, out of dirt and spit. was it only symbolic act? or was there a cloned member already prepared and just simply replaced dirt and spit. or was the dirt and spit changed to conform to the dna and genetis of the blind man.   its obvious that God Cloned Eves'  body, to me, from adams rib   but i think the spirit still had to be added afterwards   All of us have a preexistence. so if a person can learn to clone and learn to add a spirit, is it by the will of God or permission or is in complete disobedience to God. ???|`|AA11992885	good question....ya know, nazis experimented on humans for the sake of medical advancements.................immoral is immoral, if you wouldn't do it to yourself or your own son, then why do it to a clone?    morality isn't determined by what we are doing something to..........it isn't as simple as, "if done to a human it is immoral, but to a monkey it's okay"|`|FVLgdXoUaa	Clones would be human, just like people conceived naturally.  It's very immoral to use a human being as a lab rat, especially if there is a chance that the person could be severely injured as a result.|`|Gf5nMPJXaa	wouldn't really need to - could just clone the relevant organs or body parts rather than functional human clones.  No higher brain function = no experience or sensation = no immorality.|`|GeoiGjbCaa	This is essentially a slippery slope question come strawman.    Yes, it would be immoral.    Yet this is the concept that fundies think scientists have in mind when the fundies try to ban stem cell research.    POINT MADE: read "witnessofjesus" remark below about "farming" to see how screwed up these morons have it.|`|c5VABL0oaa	I agree with David M. It would be much more efficient to clone and sustain single body parts (livers, kidneys, etc.) to do testing on or to use as replacements for people needing transplants rather than creating a complete, functioning human being. Not only would something like this be immoral, but it would be extremely inefficient. I'm not even sure why anyone would do this, unless they were a sadist.|`|fc4U6217aa	well....i think messing with creation is messed up...|`|AaKZekyRaa	Yes, it would be immoral. A cloned human is the same as a twin.|`|3GAiVmEAaa	If they managed to stop the development of a functioning brain I would not have an issue with it. If the body is just a hunk of meat and organs without any though or pain then I would not consider it human.    This is a grey area though and I think it would be very difficult to ever rea ch that point without hurting someone.    I have no issue with animal testing for medical purposes. If we achieved human clones then that may not be necessary and we may get better results but I have no clue what people against animal research expect us to do. Do you wan to be the first living thing a drug is tried on or shall we use a rat first?|`|1f373b1b8e8cf826cc8854c24e102f8eaa	Yes, it would be immoral.    Why would you need to "classify" a human clone as human?  Why would you even need to legislate who is human and who is not?  THAT is what would be immoral.    Leaving morality aside for the moment,  what would even be the purpose for cloning an entire human being?  I can see only two reasons that you would EVER need to clone an entire human being:    First, if there was a plague that threaten to wipe out the entire human race, you could save uninfected cells to automatically regenerate the human race in the far future after the plague had run its course and died out.    Second, it would be the only practical way to send the human race to other planets circling other stars since the journey would be thousands or tens of thousands of years long.    But, getting away from science fiction, what would be the problem with being able to clone individual organs from your own body to use in transplants?  Organs like a new kidney, or a new liver, or a new heart?  Organs that could be transplanted WITHOUT the worry of rejection?  Would that be an immoral use of cloning?  .|`|DZNdxcnhaa	Yes, I also think it is immoral to use rats as lab rats.|`|Z92LPUqaaa	No, so long as there is not a functional brain.

Strangely enough, it stuck...even though we have explanations for most of the unexplainable.    In short, war upon war has been fought in the name of God.

k03dYskYaa	Did God have a beginning?    Ps. 90:2: Before the mountains themselves were born, or you proceeded to bring forth as with labor pains the earth and the productive land, even from time indefinite to time indefinite you are God.    Is that reasonable? Our minds cannot fully comprehend it. But that is not a sound reason for rejecting it. Consider examples: (1)?Time. No one can point to a certain moment as the beginning of time. And it is a fact that, even though our lives end, time does not. We do not reject the idea of time because there are aspects of it that we do not fully comprehend. Rather, we regulate our lives by it. (2)?Space. Astronomers find no beginning or end to space. The farther they probe into the universe, the more there is. They do not reject what the evidence shows; many refer to space as being infinite. The same principle applies to the existence of God.    Other examples: (1)?Astronomers tell us that the heat of the sun at its core is 27,000,000 degrees Fahrenheit (15,000,000?C.). Do we reject that idea because we cannot fully comprehend such intense heat? (2)?They tell us that the size of our Milky Way is so great that a beam of light traveling at over 186,000 miles per second (300,000 km/sec) would require 100,000 years to cross it. Do our minds really comprehend such a distance? Yet we accept it because scientific evidence supports it.    Which is more reasonablethat the universe is the product of a living, intelligent Creator? or that it must have arisen simply by chance from a nonliving source without intelligent direction? Some persons adopt the latter viewpoint because to believe otherwise would mean that they would have to acknowledge the existence of a Creator whose qualities they cannot fully comprehend. But it is well known that scientists do not fully comprehend the functioning of the genes that are within living cells and that determine how these cells will grow. Nor do they fully understand the functioning of the human brain. Yet, who would deny that these exist? Should we really expect to understand everything about a Person who is so great that he could bring into existence the universe, with all its intricate design and stupendous size?|`|bb06GQ5Paa	LOL, I'm sure we have absolutely no idea!|`|e640e5fc04f1c4da3326c5429e707bdcaa	I think that is an excellent question. I think you should ask him. I feel God is all the energy of the universe and he created everything in the Big Bang...we are all part of God, here to experience life for our spiritual evolution. Just one philosophy.|`|gGmMw2vDaa	In the beginning was the imagination, and it imagined fearful things. Then, it imagined a magical fairy to make the imaginer feel better, and it named the imagined god.|`|AA11849917	Your question is, in itself, a logical contradiction.    You see, for God to even qualify as God, He must have created this MEST universe (MEST = Matter, Energy, Space and Time), and as such, does not consist of MEST, nor is constrained to MEST.    God does not consist of matter or energy.  Jesus said "God is Spirit".    God transcends space and time.  That means He is infinite in scope, and eternal in duration.    One can not use MEST tools to discover or analyze that which is outside the realm of MEST.    If you ask "Who created God?"  then you must also ask, "Who created His creator?" and "Who created THAT one's creator?" ad infinitum, ad nausaum.    One of God's names that He disclosed in the Bible indicates that God has within Himself sufficient cause for His own existence without any prior cause.  God told Moses, "I AM", period.  He is the "Self-sufficient One".  He needs no prior cause.    God is the original uncaused Cause, the uncreated Creator.    We see everything in this MEST universe as having a cause-effect relationship, but remember, God exists outside this MEST universe.      A finite - an infinitesmally small - temporal created being has a really hard time understanding the infinite and eternal God, but He said that if we seek Him with a humble and honest heart, He would reveal Himself to us.    This may not be the kind of answer you're looking for, but it is the best answer I can give you, and remain truthful to the subject at hand.  And if I misspelled anything I do apologize.    Additional comment:  This is not the first time this question has been asked.  I've answered this question so many times, it's not funny.  I've quit counting the number of times I've answered this question, so to the person who said "It's about time", I would like some one ELSE to say "It's about time we QUIT asking this question, once and for all" - okay?|`|aJLXBhoAaa	God is eternal.

Many christians and creationists claim that everything needs to have a creator - meaning that the fact that the universe exists means that it had to have been created.    However, their 'god' does not need to have a creator - because they say so.    Maybe the universe is the same way - it doesn't need a creator.|`|FVLgdXoUaa	Most Christians, me included, generally agree that God has always existed, or exists in some way outside of time as we know it.  Before you call that line of thinking nonsensical, it's important to ask yourself how existence (not the Universe, but reality itself) came into being if you are an atheist.  I'm sure that your answer would be that it has just always been there; same idea.|`|Fp0NSdnVaa	a great big explosion did it and ran away leaving evidence that can only be considered evidence after it has been accepted as proof and is therefore not even worthy of the name evidence... oh no, wait a sec, thats the other theory.

God is a futuristic human sent back in time who then set into motion the chain of evets that would lead to their own creation and destruction.|`|0s93q8Ocaa	The Christian religion is a mystery.

He is outside of time as it is humans who put a time to everything, therefore he is eternity, he has no time. That may sound strange, but then consider science..or rather the science of the big bang..the big bang states that all matter all that we see has always been here...the big bang theory states that atoms were here, and slammed together ultimately creating everything we see...and yet it gives no explaination of where those atoms came from.., except that they have always been here, and that apparently nothing created them. Whats odder still? consider it....Adam/Atom???? kind of an odd coincidence to me.|`|jHyzIHmCaa	I believe that we are not equipped to understand that kind of answer even if it was given to us.  Everything is believed by faith. No matter if you are Christian, Catholic, Muslim, Evolutionist, Aetheist.  The same questions could be asked about the big bang theory if you think about it.  My stance I am a christian, and i believe in creationism because I just cannot picture a perfect rotating universe where life ended up starting on the only planet that could sustain it and that male and female came from a single cell, and that even life originated from rocky gaseus matter without some kind of divine help. There are many other reasons too.  Look around, search your heart, I hope you come up with the right answer.   But to answer your question again it is faith no matter what end.. .|`|t6XI6W09aa	God Almighty was there, He was not created. He created every thing. Had He not created angels, jinns and humans, we would have not known that He existed. Because He created us, made us aware of His presence. He does not have a mother or father. He is One and only.    This is a 4 line definition of Almighty God/Allah in the Quran.  1.Say: He is Allah, the one!  2.Allah, the eternally implored by all!  3.He begets not nor was He begotten.  4.And there is none comparable to Him.    Same can be found in the Bible.   The First Commandment is that God is One    The Bible does not support the Christian belief in trinity at all. One of the scribes once asked Jesus (pbuh) as to which was the first commandment of all, to which Jesus (pbuh) merely repeated what Moses (pbuh) had said earlier:  "Shama Israelu Adonai Ila Hayno Adonai Ikhad."   This is a Hebrew quotation, which means:  "Hear, O Israel; The Lord our God is one Lord."   [The Bible, Mark 12:29]  It is striking that the basic teachings of the Church such as Trinity and vicarious atonement find no mention in the Bible. In fact, various verses of the Bible point to Jesus (pbuh) actual mission, which was to fulfill the law revealed to Prophet Moses (pbuh). Indeed Jesus (pbuh) rejected any suggestions that attributed divinity to him, and explained his miracles as the power of the One True God.   Jesus (pbuh) thus reiterated the message of monotheism that was given by all earlier prophets of Almighty God.    The Ten Commandments  1.You shall have no other Gods but me.  2.You shall not make for yourself any idol, nor bow down to it or worship it.    People who say God is part of "TRINITY" or 3, they are blasphemying, Show me where is the word "TRINITY" in the Bible. Have you read your Bible yet? Please do not misguide anyone if you do not know the answer!!  I hope this explains your question.|`|gYx1FgqLaa	God never came to be.. he was always there... in a world of nothing     God eventually decided that he would create a man in his own image... after all it might be kind of boring being all by your self... so he created heaven and earth.... knowing one day that satan one of his fallen angels would deceive the world and cause sin, and then send his son to save the world...|`|bI3areCsaa	He wasn't created.He has no beginning and He has no ending.
VpTxqL2Aaa	If you are looking for someone to love than you just have to get out there and be yourself. if you find someone you like be yourself and let them get to know you for who you are. Let them fall in love with your charm. In the end you will just have to trust that the love will prevail. In the end you have to take a chance and tell them you are a trans... and just accept if they dont like it.  It makes it easier if you are sure the person is bi because then they wouldnt care if you were a guy or a girl. if you find the right person it wont matter to them if you are a trans because they will love you for you.    If you are just looking for sex they have sites for that such as adult friend finder and you could always just not tell who ever it is so you dont have to worry.

What good is a woman's body with no curves?|`|feUMAvgLaa	I don't like thick girls, I like slim girls that are a little curvy|`|1O1ZyEhpaa	Just because a women is thicker than you doesnt mean she isnt healthy and just because a women is thin doesnt mean she is healthy either.|`|CGxQ9vSuaa	A woman with curves is not fat.

Thick doesn't mean you don't exercise and eat bad. Look at Beyonce...well, she's getting slimmer now, but look at the Bootilicious or Survivor video - that is what thick is.

Not ALL men like thick women, not ALL men like slim women...|`|jgpYS0oEaa	Not all men like thick bodies.

eb4e977a0cb9ce50b08bf74f0f3a0c61aa	Here is truth - read and understand. <br>  1. Vampires, defined as a humanoid being that MUST consume blood or energy to survive do not exist. Cut and paste time, as it is too much work to type this out over and over and I "recycle" my own answers instead of retyping them so here goes. A brief discussion of the human digestive system and then the probable vampire population given an exponential growth rate should explain why vampires are not possible. <br>  <br>  2. The human body is not designed to process large amounts of blood for nutrition. There is not enough protein, carbohydrates, and fats present in blood to maintain a complex creature such as Homo Sapiens or any theorized offshoot mutations. When a human ingests food it is first broken up into a bolus by chewing, then churned up in the stomach with digestive juices to form a mass called chyme. It then passes through the pylorus into the duodenum, part of the small intestine where it mixes with bile salts and secretions from the pancreas and liver which continue breaking it down on a molecular basis, mostly affecting fats at this point. The broken down nutrients pass through the wall of the intestines and into the bloodstream where they are carried to each cell or stored for later use. Indigestible bulk continues through the intestines, turning a dark brown from the bile. Water is absorbed from this mass in the large intestine depending on the needs of the body - a well-hydrated person will usually have a softer stool than a dehydrated person will. Water also enters the bloodstream, and this is what helps to maintain blood pressure. The pressure tends to balance itself in a healthy person because the bloodstream goes through a formation in the kidney called the Loop of Henle, where the narrowing blood vessel forces excess water and cellular waste such as urea out through the cellular wall into the kidneys, where it is excreted through the ureters into the bladder, and then out of the body via the urethral passageway.<br>  <br>  3. IMPORTANT - A person physically unable to process his own food for nutrition therefore also could not process blood - it's the same process. Ingested blood does not transmit directly to the veins anyway - it would be chemically broken down by the digestive system.<br>  <br>  4. Theoretical ingestion of blood to supply these nutrients would therefore have to occur at least once a day, and would require the ingestion of the entire blood supply which could not happen as the stomach is far too small to hold that much liquid volume. Hold up your clenched fist - under normal conditions your stomach is about that size. Furthermore, such a mass would be difficult to pass thru the intestines as it has no fibrous bulk, would create an intestinal impaction, causing massive vomiting from the large concentration of iron present, and any "real" vampire would have to eventually expel the waste, which would come out as a black, tarry, smelly goo, just as stool does when blood is present from a upper GI bleed. <br>  <br>  5. These humans that affect the whole "vampiric lifestyle" are NOT vampires. They are simply humans playing their own little game, in their own little fantasy world, usually pandering to their own little sexual fetish, which may or may not actually be sexual. I too, play my own little game, in the SCA, but mine is a game where the deeds that I do are determined by the strength of my arm and sword - I am a warrior, with just as much skill and ability as any warrior of ancient times. The difference is that I am claiming to be something physically possible: a warrior, and I prove it everytime I strap on my armor and walk onto a SCA battlefield. The so-called "vampires" are claiming to be something physically impossible: a walking corpse, and all they prove is that black Victorian clothing, a pair of false fangs, and a little makeup make for a good Halloween costume - it does not make you a vampire.<br>  <br>  6. Even if a vampire feeds once a week, and his victim also becomes a vampire, that is exponential growth, with four iterations a month. First iteration: One makes one, total two. Second iteration: Two make two, total four. Third iteration: Four make four, total eight. Fourth iteration: Eight make eight, total sixteen. 16 vampires at the end of one month, 256 at the end of the second month, 4096 by the end of the third month, 65,536 by the end of the fourth month, 1,048,476 at the end of the fifth, and 33,572,832 vampires at the end of half a year! By way of comparison, there are currently approximately 33 million people who have HIV/AIDS in the U.S. alone, and the disease is a world-wide epidemic. I see people every day in the hospital with AIDS, but never has there been one documented case of a vampire attack. Do the math - vampires are a mathematical impossibility. As for the idea that vampires existed "a long time ago" consider the estimated global population 5,000 years ago - using the above mathematical rationale, a single vampire could have taken over and converted every human on the globe in less than two years. This falls therefore, under the logic of Occam's Razor - which states that when you have removed every impossible answer, whatever remains, no matter how improbable, must be the truth. Since there is no "vampiric plague" swarming the earth, the logical deduction is that they don't exist.<br>  <br>  7. Point of clarification about "vampire" bats: vampire is simply the name we have given them because they do drink blood, same as a flea, mosquito, leech, or spider. Are these creatures vampires? No. They are living creatures, not legendary monsters. They can subsist on blood because of their smaller size and proportionately larger stomach volume. Drinking blood does not make you a vampire anymore than eating raw meat makes you a werewolf, although it might make you a mosquito.<br>  <br>  8.The humans who profess to be vampires are victims of an all-encompassing self induced delusion. They are as human as you or I, regardless of their claims, and if they ingest HIV tainted blood they can most certainly contract the disease, esp. if they have any cuts, sores, or lesions in and or around their mouth. It is a very dangerous delusion to be laboring under. Note that there is absolutely no scientific or medical proof that these people derive any benefit at all from the ingestion of blood, and even worse are the so-called "psychic" vampires, because their delusion is one that they cannot substantiate with any concrete evidence at all.<br>  <br>  9. There is no "vampire" gene. People are not "born" as vampires. When a woman goes to the hospital for prenatal care there are many tests done on mother and child, even while still in the womb, to check for many things, including genetic anomalies that result in deformities and birth defects. If such a gene existed, in today's world with today's technology it would have been found - we have already completely sequenced the human genome. It would also have to follow Mendel's law of dominant/recessive gene theory. Again, the odds on that many "vampires" all escaping the notice of the medical/scientific community are so low as to be almost nonexistent. The idea that there is a global "vampire community" engaging in controlled breeding to keep the "bloodline pure" is delusional in the extreme.<br>  <br>  10. There is no "vampire virus" - as I have already pointed out, HIV is a virus, and look at how fast it has spread - virtually everyone knows someone with the affliction. According to the "vampire websites" there are "thousands" of vampires running around. If that was so then at least one of them has ended up in a hospital for bloodwork when they became pregnant, had a bloodborne infection, was injured in a car wreck, etc, etc, ad nauseum. The anomaly would have been detected and medical science would have isolated it, studied it, applied for research grants on it, published papers on it, and turned it into the talk of the medical and scientific community, as well as making its "discoverers" celebrities and rich beyond their dreams. A virus cannot alter your DNA in such a radical fashion without killing you.|`|PkXJRfaBaa	Vampires do exist, but as Sanguine and Psychic Vampires. These vampires are born, not made. The Vampires you hear about in fiction aren't real, they won't explode in sunlight (though some real vampires may prefer night), they don't always hate garlic... You get my point.<br>  <br>  Sanguine Vampires are blood drinkers. They can drink human or animal blood, though they will have to drink alot of animal blood to fulfill their cravings.<br>  <br>  Psychic Vampires (or Energy Vampires) are vampires which take emotional energy from others. Their main prey are those who are hyperactive or incredibly happy, someone who is depressed does not give off the correct energy for a Psychic Vampire to feed from.<br>  <br>  Vampires act like everyday human beings, they go to work, go home, sleep, wake up, have breakfast, etc. You may even know one without actually realising it!<br>  <br>  The general age for vampiric awakening is between the ages of 14 and 20, although someone can awaken at any age.<br>  <br>  Hope I helped you!<br>  <br>  Edit: I forgot to mention Hybrid Vampires which are a combination of the above.|`|y3jD0DDpaa	LORD BEARCLAW WE NEED YOU!|`|4UIR1YuQaa	Vampires don't exists.

My point is, Black racism isn't as extreme as White, for racist Whites tend to add violence and saying crap like 'send them back to Africa.' Have you ever heard of the 'Black KKK?'

(The Lord of the Marches was presumably a Danish prince.) For his companion on this embassy, Bishop Don Diego chose Saint Dominic. Passing on their mission through Toulouse, the bishop and Dominic witnessed with amazement and sorrow the work of spiritual ruin wrought by the Albigensian heresy. Contemplating this scene, Dominic conceived for the first time the idea of founding an Order that would combat heresy and spread the light of the Gospel by preaching to the ends of the then known world.|`|3E6lf2cJaa	does anyone know what she's on about? cuz i certainly got no clue

It's creepy.<br>  <br>  I remember when I was little my sister told me I had to hold my breath while we went passed it, or else the ghosts would be jealous that I could breath and they couldn't, and they'd haunt me. Lol.|`|h6cYQaxYaa	Doesn't every town have cemeteries? If not what do you do with people when they die? I have been to several unfortunately at a wake.
wTqid2ONaa	When you're close like that to somebody, you really know how to push their buttons.  Sometimes you women take it too far, i had fights with girlfriends that really try to push me to the limit. <br>  <br>  This one girl went too far with the yo momma stuff.  I know she didn't mean it but there's certain boundaries you just don't cross, so i helped her pack her stuff and sent her on her way and never spoke to her again.<br>  <br>  I don't have it in me to hit a woman, i just can't do it.  I understand the need to vent frustrations but i would rather do it in the bedroom, it's more fun lol.  I'm not saying i'm proud of Chris Brown or that he should've done what he did, but i understand lol.|`|ncdTxID9aa	They are ego boosters, and show why many men today hit women, because more guys encourage it claiming it's self defense.  But normally when guys fight each other, they at some point restrain each other from getting hurt badly or from losing the fight completely, but they can't restrain a woman?  Oh please, but this is why I date men who have respect for people genetically weaker(doesn't matter how strong a woman is) plus I'm not  violent person anyway, so you won't catch me swinging at anyone.|`|LDVBKMiSaa	I think he is a retard.

Many of them grow up around it, listening to rap music that promotes it (Lay it Down by Eightball and MJG is just one example of promoting physical violence against women).  This music desensitizes men to violence against women. Bottom line. It's usually subconscious. <br>  <br>  Their cousins, older brothers, dads, uncles probably have popped a chick or two upside the head so they think its ok.<br>  <br>  And then many of them just don't respect women, in general, and see us merely as objects, not real people with feelings.|`|WBwlKbLeaa	The poster J1 is your typical pig man. No man has a right to think any woman is asking for it. When they do I guess the man is asking for it when she blows his brains out. Any man that hits a woman is a coward pure and simple.|`|Vz5vjAWRaa	I dont support that crap at all but Rihanna being a woman and the stuff women love like a rough-neck guy that treats them like s hit, she will probably end up going back to him because she loves him and he's sorry..|`|fia9gMHpaa	You told you that?
QIgrBrFdaa	There should be a section for all religions... Ramdan is the only section which most Muslims will be at so we're always here. R&S is just full of annoying questions of athiests arguing with Christians mostly.|`|dt4BIWSMaa	Going into the Religion and Spirituality is not for the faint of heart if you are a Muslim.  You can say and express your yourself and your beliefs in the most gentle of ways there only to be bashed. I have never seen a category so intolerant as R and S it should be called Christianity. But it is not so one could say Ramadan is the Islamic category. However many do come with non Ramadan or non Islamic Q's and I have always felt that that is fine since there is no Islam category and I think that it is great that people improvised and got creative with it. But sadly you will ask or see a Q that is not related to <br>  Islam but merely sharing personal things between Muslims to Muslims and non here and there is sometimes always someone that posts back "What is this Q doing in Ramadan?"  I think it is ok that people can go off  traditional topic here since there is no Islam category and sometimes ppl like to share opinions and spend some free time in a safe place for them to do it. For a category called R and S it is anything but what it is presented as. It is filled with vile and hate so I can relate why anyone in their right mind would choose to avoid it.|`|NlQhkgFCaa	We stuck here like Sardines yes <br>  <br>  I agree with you|`|IEaedB5Eaa	I know huh, why is that?<br>  I guess they don't like us! :-(|`|AORcLwTNaa	yeahhh ur right|`|zBqt99avaa	For the same reason there is no Christianity section or Atheist section or Hindu section.<br>  <br>  I think you haven't been here long if you've never seen a question on Ramadan, lol.  People have already started asking when the next one is.<br>  <br>  Some Muslims do frequent R&S.  Just not all, or all the time.  It's not a conspiracy :)|`|H8WqMK1eaa	There are no sub-sections of Religion & Spirituality...it is the section where people of all faiths can ask and answer questions.<br>  <br>  However, it appears that many of the younger Muslims do not like R & S...there are a lot of sharp-tongued atheists, pagans, and agnostics...along with a large amount of equally sharp-tongued Christians and Jews.<br>  <br>  So...most of them have adapted the Ramadan section to be where any and all Islamic topics are discussed.|`|WmU7jhObaa	R&S is filled with Ignorant Atheistic Monkey.<br>  <br>  if you speak to intelligently you will just get thumbed down and ignored. so you have to dumb down for them|`|8FbJjRpwaa	I agree with you, why isnt there?|`|WyjRm10jaa	My knowledge is to little..<br>  i am here just for other reason..

I no longer believe that a REAL lesbian can only be one who has never willingly slept with a man, and I'm actually quite ashamed of the attitude I used to have.<br>  This category in particular has also introduced me to some wonderful people whom I never would have "met" if Y!A didn't exist, so I'm grateful for that too.<br>  <br>  Here's a ((((((HUG)))))) especially for you.|`|ZzYy2szvaa	Yes, so much!<br>  <br>  It helped me feel better about being gay.  I used to feel so isolated (you know, the whole "I'm the only one" story), but now I realise the variety of people and how we can still be ourselves, and be unique, while still being united under the LGBT flag.  It's so great to have a group of people to talk to who all know what everyone else here has gone through.  Also, all of us here help other confused people on a daily basis!  That is the most amazing part to me.<br>  <br>  As LSBN said, I also love the age, sex, and experience spectrum that always gives me alternatives to my situation and allows me to see outside the box.|`|nisfxpXHaa	I've had a few questions that I have asked seeking advice from other gay parents, especially now that my oldest daughter has started kindergarten.<br>  <br>  Not only have the gay parents answered and helped me out, but so have plenty that are not parents.

WYk0zYdhaa	Great question *opens bible*<br>  <br>  Looking at this in context we must look at the verses above and below:<br>  <br>   36Simon Peter said to Him, "Lord, where are You going?" Jesus answered, "(A)Where I go, you cannot follow Me now; but (B)you will follow later."<br>  <br>   37Peter said to Him, "Lord, why can I not follow You right now? (C)I will lay down my life for You."<br>  <br>   38Jesus answered, "Will you lay down your life for Me? Truly, truly, I say to you, (D)a rooster will not crow until you deny Me three times.<br>  John 14<br>  Jesus Comforts His Disciples<br>   1"(E)Do not let your heart be troubled; [a]believe in God, believe also in Me.<br>  <br>   2"In My Father's house are many dwelling places; if it were not so, I would have told you; for (F)I go to prepare a place for you.<br>  <br>   3"If I go and prepare a place for you, (G)I will come again and receive you to Myself, that (H)where I am, there you may be also.<br>  <br>   4"And you know the way where I am going."<br>  <br>   5(I)Thomas said to Him, "Lord, we do not know where You are going, how do we know the way?" <br>  <br>  <br>  Jesus was talking to His disciples and telling them that He was leaving , again trying to prepare them for what was going to happen.  They were confused and so He was trying to comfort them.  Reminding them who He is even though they themselves said HE was God many times they seemed to forget (must have been a bit frustrating) and didn't understand the Lord's plan for redemption.

Then they will live on their own soil."<br>  <br>  <br>  > It will be during the Passover that YHVH will again deliver His people.

I would never think hitting a woman is funny. I love both Rihanna and Chris Brown's music but it seems like both of them were in the wrong. Regardless Chris should have did her like that. Domestic violence does happen everyday but it usually never gets publicized like this, which is sad. Either way it's nothing to laugh about.|`|GPznIhzMaa	Even if you weren't a fan of Rihanna, that doesn't make it amusing.

I don't know the WHOLE story so I really feel indifferent.|`|jdKTs3aHaa	Well that's your opinion. I don't find it amusing for someone to get beaten to the point where their face is unrecognizable. Even if Rhianna was abusive that doesn't give him the right to do that. Men are capable of restraining other men without throwing punches so they should be able to do the same w/ women. I don't think ANY body deserves that even if they're evil I would still cringe if their faced was beaten to look that way.|`|CEChcfKwaa	No, I do not find it amusing. I don't find any woman getting beaten up by the man who is supposed to love her amusing. I especially don't find it amusing when someone of Chris Brown's stature does something like this for the whole world to see. With one act he went from being somebody for us to look up to, to being somebody for us to live down. That does not amuse me. I'm surprised it amuses you.<br>  <br>  Rihanna might not care if I got beat up by my man but I'm pretty sure she wouldn't find it funny.|`|DfDss68haa	Wow there are so many things wrong with this question.

J4Wf5wo0aa	There are some Bible that doesn't have these verses.  This Bible came from the Old Manuscript before the Dead Sea Scroll.  After this Dead Sea Scroll and the Bible Scholars added these verses in the Bible.  Like the gospel according to Mark the the Old Manuscript doesn't have chapter 10-16 and after the Dead Sea Scroll these were added.  You may ask this question, In revelation said no one can add or subtract in this prophecy.  That is true and there is no contradiction in that Word.  The Bible means that Taking out or added something that can destroy the meaning of salvation and the plan of God for us.|`|IqqaA2wIaa	yes NRSV...|`|AA12346187	Jehoiakim Burns Jeremiah's Scroll<br>   1 In the fourth year of Jehoiakim son of Josiah king of Judah, this word came to Jeremiah from the LORD : 2 "Take a scroll and write on it all the words I have spoken to you concerning Israel, Judah and all the other nations from the time I began speaking to you in the reign of Josiah till now. 3 Perhaps when the people of Judah hear about every disaster I plan to inflict on them, each of them will turn from his wicked way; then I will forgive their wickedness and their sin."<br>  <br>  <br>  yes.|`|TX5uV9bIaa	Yes.

XyIOD5Olaa	I'm not sure that there is an exact answer to your question sincet seems only a matter of stylistic preference and not a really a matter of scientific correctness (though the individual is, as you say, still alive after the jump.)  "Body" can, and does, indicate a live individual as well as a dead one.  To explain it from my perspective, however, I would say you are correct-- I think it is a journalistic effort to distance the person from their act of suicide.  The person's being is committed to death from the second they jump.  I think it is just a matter of perspective and style.  I don't know if writers in other languages do it, I'd be curious to find out.|`|ISAuCHNDaa	Body as a word does not merely refer to a dead person it refers to the physical being of a human i.e. the human body, she has a nice body, he really pushes his body etc.  The word we have for the body of a dead person is corpse.  As for it being strange, it is only strange that writers seem to assume that although the body falls the rest of the person does not.  I am assuming that your first language is not English, maybe wrongly.  I cannot see an English speaker thinking about this too greatly.|`|sXwBN5sSaa	Because it is exactly the correct word!<br>  Your body is still your body, even before it becomes your corpse!!|`|AA10270701	OK..so I can only give my opinion here, but I think that in English we separate ourselves from our body, like we say "my arm" or "my heart" rather than in other languages saying "the heart of me" in that it is such an ingrained part of you you are not separated from it or you don't objectify it through a possessive adjective.  Just like we don't like thinking about the animal meat came from, we separate ourselves from the "ickier" parts of life.  By using his "body" fell, it separates the shocking effect of someone ending their life.|`|gZ0NPuleaa	If the story was about someone who fell and survived it would usually have been written as "He fell into the garden" . It could still say " He fell into the garden.." if  he was dead.It would be up to the writer. By saying "His body fell .." the writer is implying that he is dead. It is not automatic that he be dead. The writer could use the phrase "His body ..." to create some mystery in the story that would be ended by the announcement of the actual death.|`|m25lpepOaa	I think that in a way using "body" separates spirit from physical being. The writer may want to keep the physical being away from all of the other aspects of the person. In your example saying "his body" fell states that simply the physical parts of said person fell. Saying that "Lufbery fell" would mean that all aspects of him (physical, spiritual, mental) fell, which may not be how the writer wants it portrayed. <br>  <br>  I think that using the word "body" separates the being from the person "inside" the being.

u4HO7fLOaa	You poor thing. Get the antibacterial stuff and use it every time you touch your bathroom pal. Just remember, after shaking Mr. Butty's hand, not to touch anything or anyone until you've used your antibacterial. It's especially important not to touch your face -- that is the quickest way to spread infection (b/c of all of the orifices). If you don't like the liquid/gel, there are antibacterial wipes available, kind of like the little wipes they give you at the chicken joints. BJ's Warehouse and Sam's Club sell big boxes of them in individually wrapped packets. It's around $10 for 150 of them. Places like Bed Bath & Beyond sell smaller boxes with fewer wipes for about $2.50. I think our culture should move toward bowing, personally.

We believe in God, the Eternal Father, and in His Son, Jesus Christ, and in the Holy Ghost.<br>  <br>  2. We believe that men will be punished for their own sins, and not for Adam's transgression.<br>  <br>  3. We believe that through the atonement of Christ, all mankind may be saved, by obedience to the laws and ordinances of the Gospel.<br>  <br>  4. We believe that the first principles and ordinances of the Gospel are: first, Faith in the Lord Jesus Christ; second, Repentance; third, Baptism by immersion for the remission of sins; fourth, Laying on of hands for the gift of the Holy Ghost.<br>  <br>  5. We believe that a man must be called of God, by prophecy, and by the laying on of hands by those who are in authority, to preach the Gospel and administer in the ordinances thereof.<br>  <br>  6. We believe in the same organization that existed in the Primitive Church, namely, apostles, prophets, pastors, teachers, evangelists, and so forth.<br>  <br>  7. We believe in the gift of tongues, prophecy, revelation, visions, healing, interpretation of tongues, and so forth.<br>  <br>  8. We believe the Bible to be the word of God as far as it is translated correctly; we also believe the Book of Mormon to be the word of God.<br>  <br>  9. We believe all that God has revealed, all that He does now reveal, and we believe that He will yet reveal many great and important things pertaining to the Kingdom of God.<br>  <br>  10. We believe in the literal gathering of Israel and in the restoration of the Ten Tribes; that Zion (the New Jerusalem) will be built upon the American continent; that Christ will reign personally upon the earth; and, that the earth will be renewed and receive its paradisiacal glory.<br>  <br>  11. We claim the privilege of worshiping Almighty God according to the dictates of our own conscience, and allow all men the same privilege, let them worship how, where, or what they may.<br>  <br>  12. We believe in being subject to kings, presidents, rulers, and magistrates, in obeying, honoring, and sustaining the law.<br>  <br>  13. We believe in being honest, true, chaste, benevolent, virtuous, and in doing good to all men; indeed, we may say that we follow the admonition of Paul--We believe all things, we hope all things, we have endured many things, and hope to be able to endure all things.

Remember, in fairness, all religions are actually "cults" based on an accurate definition of the word. We've got the Mormon Cult, the Baptist Cult, the Lutheran Cult, and the Chicago Cubs Cult, so calling someone a "cult," while trendy, doesn't always help intellectually astute people to fear and despise your target. To do that with good Christian folk, you're better off labeling your target as "non-Christian." But if you want to do that with Mormons, you need to do you're homework. Or rather, you need to find an insider like me who can do your homework for you. Remember, this site is produced by an actual Mormon who isn't afraid to take on these issues and expose the truth about Mormonism. I'm your inside guide, and I'll show you how to avoid the biggest pitfalls that would-be cult-fighters face when taking on the Mormon cult. If you want your attack to have any credibility, take the advice I give below. <br>  <br>  So why do most anti-Mormon attacks fall short when trying to allege that Mormons aren't Christian? First of all, they fail to realize that Mormons are absolutely convinced that they are Christian. They are taught to worship Christ, the Christ of the Bible. They look to Him as their Savior, they end every prayer in His name, they make covenants to follow Him, and on and on it goes. Sneak into a Mormon home and you'll find pictures of Jesus on the walls, kids learning songs about Jesus (in between rounds of destruction on the XBox), and regular teachings from parents about following Jesus as their Savior. So you can't just go up to a Mormon and say, "Excuse me, did you know you don't believe in Jesus Christ?" Sorry, that's just stupid and ineffective. <br>  <br>  Remember, the trick here is to use the right definition of Christian. "You aren't Christian because you don't believe in Jesus Christ" uses the old-fashioned dictionary definition of Christian: someone who believes in and worships Jesus Christ. That will get you nowhere with my Mormon friends, trust me, or with anyone who actually knows anything about the Mormons. You need a more informed, subtle approach. <br>  <br>  Now a lot of you folks have come close by making clever lists of Mormon beliefs versus Christian beliefs (i.e., your particular beliefs), implicitly bringing in your beliefs and interpretations of the Bible as the gold standard definition for Christian. And that's the right approach - but you usually goof everything up in the execution. It's all about execution, baby. And I'll show you how to execute. <br>  <br>  The problem is that traditional anti-Mormons don't do their homework. When they compare "Mormon beliefs" to their particular "Christian beliefs," they usually get the Mormon beliefs all wrong or distort them in ways that instantly lose credibility by those who know. It's easy to find crazy Mormon quotes from people's journals or random speeches or obscure publications. Yeah, someone once said that Joseph Smith taught that there were nine-foot tall Quakers living on the moon. Whoa, that sounds pretty bizarre and probably non-Christian, right? But Mormons don't really believe he said that. It comes from someone's journal many decades after Joseph Smith died. It's an outlier. Ditto for a lot of the whacked-out doctrines that are easy pickins' for critics. Adam = God? Boring. We don't believe that. Sorry. If they aren't official doctrines, Mormons aren't going to be swayed by attacking them. And if they sense you are twisting their doctrines to make them sound bad, they aren't going to buy your attack. Look, if you were, say, Muslim, you could mock Mormons and others for "having a weekly cannibalistic ritual in which they pretend to eat their God's body and drink His blood," but they will immediately sense that your caricature of their weekly "sacrament" or communion is a bit on the biased and nasty side. To them, it's an uplifting and positive experience that helps them remember Jesus, and you won't engage them effectively by putting that kind of spin on their teachings. <br>  <br>  The ONLY WAY to create a spin-free, objective appearance in evaluating Mormon doctrines is to use THE PRIMARY SOURCE for official Mormon teachings, and that is the Mormon scriptures. Anit-Mormons usually miss this important and critical point. Forget the spin: just quote Mormon scripture, and then compare that to "true Christian" beliefs, and you'll be much more effective. <br>  <br>  So we've got our strategy: look to the Mormon scriptures, take verbatim quotes to show doctrines that differ from your views, state that your views are the "normative Christian view," and then, since the two are different, out goes Mormonism! Not that I approve of that, because I am Mormon myself, but I can sympathize with your approach and say if you'|`|gj18ySAWaa	Mormon is another name for LDS or Latter Day Saints.<br>  It was started in 1830 by Joseph Smith under Gods direction.<br>  You can get all the accurate information through <br>  www.mormon.org<br>  & no they are not a cult. they are chrisitans.|`|F7y1BZ4Maa	A Mormon is a member of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-Day Saints.

Today "mormon" is a nickname given to members of "The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter Day Saints" aka, LDS.  From it's original usage it was intended to be a slanderous thing to call us a Mormon - I tend to like to be considered LDS instead, but being a "mormon" is a proud thing to be and if people want to refer to us by such a nickname they can do so without offense.  Although most people know so little actual TRUTH about Mormons so they shoot a bunch of half truths, misconceptions & lies out their proverbial blow holes that it's hard to know what to believe.  BUT if you go to lds.org you can find out the true doctrine about what LDS/Mormons believe.|`|WyICbuPqaa	A Mormon is someone who follows the teachings of Joseph Smith.  Joseph Smith was a 19th century prophet who was chosen by God to restore the ancient church of Christ to the earth.  Visions, angelic visitation, miracles, revelations and all of the gifts of the spirit accompanied this restoration.  The church was setup with 12 apostles, like the original church. It is known today as The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-Day Saints.  New scriptures were added to the Biblical canon, starting with the Book of Mormon.  Special witnesses were called to testify that the Book of Mormon was authentic, and translated correctly by the power of God.  They saw the angel Moroni, and the Book of Mormon, and heard the voice of God declare the translation to be correct.  Their testimonies can be found in the preface of the Book of Mormon.<br>  <br>  Severe persecution caused the members of the new church to flee the nation and settle in the Utah territory of Mexico.  Utah eventually became a state after the US/Mexican war.  The headquarters of the church can be found in Salt Lake City, Utah.<br>  <br>  Despite persecution, the church has continued to be one of the fastest growing Christian denominations, and is now the third or fourth largest Christian denomination in the United States.  They have in excess of 13 million members worldwide, and can be found in most countries.  <br>  <br>  They have the busiest website of any church, and one of the best designed:<br>  <a href="http://www.lds.org" rel="nofollow">http://www.lds.org</a>

I also remember when we had a nose bleed, she would take a pair of metal scissors sit us next to her and she would hold the unopened scissors against our back between our shoulder blades. It has something to do with the metal stopping the blood flow, It worked too. I've seen a doctor take some kind of metal and work it against the cut wound prior to doing stitches/bandaging.

Are you trying to loop every American into one group and generally state they we all believe we are the greatest country?! I have got to say, you are absolutely wrong. There are so many Americans that do appreciate the "tranquil scenery of south italy or spain, the education of england...". And I bet there are a ton of people all around the world that don't appreciate America's goodness as well. I know we have a lot of problems- but every country is messed up and it's extremely unfair to say that all Americans are brainwashed because it is absolutely not the case. <br>  <br>  Shame on you. And you are going to offend pretty much any American that reads your question.|`|jdKTs3aHaa	I have had some foreign pen pals who say things like "ohh you live in the US?

The whole world is laughing at us! Y'know, until some natural disaster hits or other calamity for which they need money and/or protection and the countries of the EU are too cowardly to get involved. Then they call on the "laughable" US, which, in that case, is right because we should just let you deal with it yourselves instead of bailing you out every time you need us when you never appreciate it. Except in those instances, I could care less whether you laugh or not. Unlike many in my country, I couldn't care less what the rest of the world thinks of the US so long as we are looking out for our own best interests.<br>  <br>  So, when was the last time you lives in a state in the US and then moved to another? Exactly, you never have yet you seem to know so much about how easy or difficult it is. Is THAT the education of the UK or should I just say England, since, apparently, Scotland, Northern Ireland and Wales don't have very good educational programs. Is it also that great education of England that tells you that Singapore is a member of the EUROPEAN Union? I guess Singapore must be the Asian European countries. LOL Now who's laughing at who? <br>  <br>  Further, since you've never been to the US, allow me to point out, since that great English education left this out, that the US ISN'T just New York City, exciting and magical as that is. The US is blessed with tranquil scenes in mountains or along the coasts or on the farmlands of the Midwest. There is nightlife in NYC, or Miami, or Los Angeles, or Los Vegas or Chicago or even Phladelphia. We have deserts and even a rain forest in Puerto Rico. You need to go to many different countries in the EU to find what we have all in our own country and contrary to what you think, it is incredibly easy to move from one state to the next. You don't even have to change your license plates, if you don't want to. <br>  <br>  Now, as for "Top Gear," is it; a US television show? Never heard of it. Perhaps you should move back to England and get that education you are so proud of and then travel to the US. I've been to the UK, 3 times, as well as Spain, France, and Italy. I haven't been to that part of the European Union, though, where Singapore.<br>  <br>  And, as you can see, there are some poor, confused Americans who actually think that things are better in the EU. I, for one, would like to wave "good-bye" to them at the airport.|`|7CwFZ9v6aa	I, as a far-from-stereotypical American, do agree that many Americans are brainwashed and ignorant and lazy and egocentric, but that doesn't mean all Americans should be looked at in this way until you experience them individually, first hand. Maybe your view should be "innocent until proven guilty" instead of "guilty until proven innocent". Yes it's true that I see many of the American stereotypes on an *annoyingly* frequent and daily basis, but it doesn't mean that we are all like that, so you should learn to have some tolerance!|`|h1bTiQvIaa	"we can move to other eu countries without any hassle.

We have beautiful places in this country too, so get over yourself.|`|dSOfuO3Laa	Okay.|`|FNk35vR6aa	I don't think America is the best country. I enjoy living in it but I'm well aware there are advantages and disadvantages. Parts of our education system are corrupt and forgotten about, we are in a national debt and divided by political parties. I'm not going to abandon my country, it was where I was born and raised. There is also tranquility within the states, and fun nights out as well. Maybe not comparable to other countries but to each his own.<br>  <br>  Not trying to be argumentative, but why are you so fixated on America regardless? The educated citizens understand the country has downfalls, we aren't all brainwashed. I'm not even sure what you are trying to ask, it seems as if you are just making a biased incoherent statement.|`|aIhhDqOWaa	"Which is more that could be said about moving into other states into usa."<br>  -Um, I am not sure what you mean, I have lived in several states, it was pretty easy moving between them. If you mean moving to the states from another country I could maybe see your point, getting a student or work visa is really not that difficult.  I had to do this when i moved to Italy.  In most countries if you are going to be there longer than 90 days and you aren't a citizen, you need a visa.<br>  -I love both Italy and Spain, I lived in Florence for two years, and they were a great two years.  <br>  -We understand that the people laughing at the "dumb americans"  are their foreign counterparts.  Ignorance has nothing to do with geography.

0lTNy27saa	When I went to the LDS church I had the same problem.  I felt like I was being forced to pay my tithing.|`|cx8SnAnVaa	You obviously did not understand the doctrine of tithing. Tithing is the only way towards financial security, especially in these days. God promises that he will "open the windows of heaven, and pour out a blessing that there will not be room enough to receive it" It just takes a little faith.<br>  I am a full tithe payer and have always had enough money for my needs. If you can't pay for your food, the church has welfare programs and will help you out, find you a job, and pay your hospital bills... ONLY if you pay your tithing though. It takes that step of faith.|`|FyLfEPv0aa	Should you be balancing this with a topic about fast offerings and assistance to the needy?<br>  <br>  Sure, we tithe.  Many religions do.  It's biblical.<br>  <br>  BUT<br>  <br>  We also help others to a great extent.  I personally know several familes on hard times who received more assiatnce from the church than they pay in tithing - that's not uncommon!<br>  <br>  Also, you get perhaps one talk a year about tithing, other churches speak about donations and offerings nearly every meeting (not all, but some seem to speak about it constantly).  Perhaps you should view the alternatives before going off about the LDS church.<br>  <br>  Eitherway, tithing isn't "buying" your way into heaven, it's a commandment found in the bible, and those how intend to serve God and devote themselves to His word and follow it would therefore heed a scripture which says that you will be burned for robbing God if you don't pay tithing (which isn't an LDS scripture but is found in Malachi held by all Judeo-Christians).<br>  <br>  If it's been commanded of God then it's not buying a place in heaven but following God.  The Bishop didn't care about your little portion, he cared about your faith.<br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  By the way, soemthing about your claim of having so little to eat because of paying your tithing that you wound up hospitalized doesn't add up - whether you paid your tithing or not if your needs had been known to the Bishop there isn't an LDS bishop in this world who would not have made sure that you were taken care of in terms of food.<br>  <br>  I've purchased food many times for members of the church in need, I've done so with my bishop using church funds, and I've done so with him using his money, and I've done so paying for them myself - but never has our offer to help been predicated on their tithing status and it's never been withheld either!|`|77b2610047fd4e5f740d75e96c9a88a2aa	First of all, it's not required.  Second of all, if you were that bad off, the bishop would have offered you food assistance.<br>  <br>  You don't "get in trouble" for not paying.  How, precisely, were you "in trouble"?  Just because he asked why you weren't paying it?|`|MlQ0GIpoaa	It seems that either you're not being honest, or you're not telling everything. There have been times when I could not afford to tithe as well. While the church says that it's required, I was still able to receive help from the church in the way of food and transportation.<br>  <br>  The church would never allow its members to starve or become homeless.|`|2ZO7vFC1aa	I'm sorry you had a bad experience.  My brother was barely getting by and wasn't paying his tithing.  Even without paying his tithing, he didn't have enough and needed a second job, but couldn't find one.  He was challenged to take that leap of faith and pay his tithing.  He did, and the week he started paying tithing again, he found a great second job and has been fine financially ever since.  Coincidence?  Perhaps, perhaps not.<br>  <br>  My brother wasn't encouraged to pay his tithing because the CHURCH needed his money.|`|AA10637643	I think the first thing you aren't realizing is the tithing IS a commandment, it is part of the gospel.  We have the fullness of the gospel, so that may be why we are one of the only churches that "requires" you to pay tithing (which actually you aren't "required" to do anything... everyone has their choices,  BUT, with choices come consequences, good or bad).  <br>  It's not that the church "needs" your money, it's that the gospel is a lifestyle.  I guarantee you, IF you would put tithing very first on your list AND pay it with the RIGHT attitude, you would have enough for everything else.  The church would even help with your rent and food if you needed.  It's much more important to be obidient.  Really.  The Lord WILL bless those who obey His commandments faithfully.  <br>  Paying your tithing faithfully would show you are being obedient.  And yes, it would be OK to get help from the church.  You might be surprised.  It's not a control thing.  It's not a "I want your money" thing.  The church has plenty of money.  <br>  I pay my tithing because I want to be obedient and I want the blessings that come from it.  IF you aren't paying with the right attitude and the right reason, why should the Lord bless you?  You may as well not pay it, as pay it grudgingly.<br>  Look at your buget.  See what you could do without.  What food could you be buying that would help spending less?  Could you survive for a while on Ramen noodles and Mac & Cheese?  There are things you CAN do.  You say you can't afford to pay tithing... the Lord says you can't afford NOT to pay tithing.  Seriously, He WILL help you.  Pray for help, for guidance.  He's there.  <br>  I challenge you to pay your tithing very first, before anything else.  Do it for 6 months instead of just 1.  Go to the church if you need help, that's actually part of what tithing goes for!  If you need food, it will be like you are just buying your food from the church!  Seriously, they can help and you will be blessed for doing what is right.<br>  Doing what is right is NEVER wrong.<br>  <br>  I have to tell you, in my experience, it's the times I get late on paying my tithing, that we have trouble.  If I am paying my tithing regularly, I don't ever even miss it.  You won't either.|`|F7y1BZ4Maa	One of the blessings of membership in The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints is the privilege of paying tithing. This privilege is a double blessing. By paying tithing, Church members show their gratitude to God for their blessings and their resolve to trust in the Lord rather than in material things. They also help further the work of the Lord in the earth, blessing others of God’s children with the opportunity to learn of Him and to grow in the gospel.

aSjdL4heaa	Hopefully you want a real answer and aren't just trolling or trying to make a point.<br>  <br>  It is not so much that religious authorities switch doctrine up ... it is that it is more noticeable.  When a church modifies its doctrine it is very obvious, it effects lots of people, and it gets publicity.  When a 'bible based' person changes their mind on a point of theology it doesn't make a ripple.  I'm sure there were lots of 'bible based' people who didn't think black people should even be allowed in their church, much less hold office in it.<br>  <br>  A church also exists longer than an individual, so doctrines which were laid down a couple of hundred years ago can clearly get out of date or be proven wrong.  An individual who bases their beliefs on the Bible only lives for a short time.  <br>  <br>  However, over the years the way the Bible is interpreted has changed.  We (at least most of us) no longer have a prohibition against eating pork or shellfish, we no longer sell our daughters into slavery, we no longer sacrifice animals, etc.|`|qOGh6ODLaa	First explain to me what faith you are?

For believers, theocracy is a form of government in which divine power governs an earthly human state, either in a personal incarnation or, more often, via religious institutional representatives (i.e., a church), replacing or dominating civil government. Theocratic governments enact theonomic laws.<br>  <br>  Theocracy should be distinguished from other secular forms of government that have a state religion, or are merely influenced by theological or moral concepts, and monarchies held "By the Grace of God".<br>  <br>  A theocracy may be monist in form, where the administrative hierarchy of the government is identical with the administrative hierarchy of the religion, or it may have two 'arms,' but with the state administrative hierarchy subordinate to the religious hierarchy.|`|a7fd823ff38cea82d01dbcb747972460aa	oh like your keys to the kIngdom were given to Paul instead of Peter which is nowhere in Scripture?<br>  <br>  if you were talking about me then all I have to say is go back on all the questions on the board for the day and you will see everyone's--not just yours---kind of full of yourself aren't you?|`|OQ9SXUAMaa	Many prophets said, "its not the time yet" so they obviously knew that eventually the rules would change.

NO ONE, today, still believes the myth that some guy named "Moses" was the author of the Penteteuch.  Too many references to 'Moses' in the third person, allusions to places that the 'alleged' Moses never saw, and the proof in the final verses that the Penteteuch was written LONG after the 'alleged' death of the 'alleged' Moses!!<br>  <br>  As to the Gospels...every scholar of repute knows that the names of the 'disciples' were appended to the anonymously written gospels ONLY in the Fourth century...after Constantine made Christianity the 'Official" religion of the Empire, and the christians began to burn all of the other 200 GOSPELS that had been circulating in the churches for three centuries!|`|lVAe2SLXaa	Neither.

Never again can that be allowed to happen. The world gave the Jewish people a homeland in 1948 and I defend their right to keep it.<br>  <br>  I support Israel because the Islamic nations around her seek to destroy her. They are opposed to her very existence and that is wrong.<br>  <br>  I support Israel because she is a democracy in the midst of tyranny in the Middle East. She is a nation where women are equals in the midst of a world where women are oppressed.<br>  <br>  I support Israel because they are the people of the covenant and El Shaddai gave them their land.<br>  <br>  As for your statement that the US support of Israel is only bringing trouble, I presume you prefer Islamic terrorists to destroy Israel. Then I suppose you would be correct. Israel will no longer be a problem. I pray that America will never allow that to happen.<br>  <br>  Pastor John<br>  <br>  Edit: Of course the Palestinians have a right to be angry. However, as you have said there are two sides to every story. At the time of Israel's formation most Jews and Palestinians were willing to live together in peace as they had been doing. Both sides were willing to make it work.<br>  <br>  However, the radical element of Palestine in 1948 went to war against both the Jews and the moderate Palestinians. In the war that followed, the Palestinians were displaced.<br>  <br>  They also deserve a homeland. I and most Americans have no problem with that. More importantly, Israel has no problem with that. The negotiations to make this happen always stop short by the militant Islamics who simply don't want that to happen. They want to destroy Israel. This is not acceptable any more than the Palestinians having no homeland is acceptable.<br>  <br>  As more Islamic nations accept Israel's existence, as have Egypt, Jordan, etc., I believe they will silence the Islamic radicals and bring peace to the area.

Half of the city will go into exile, but the rest of the people will not be taken from the city.<br>  <br>   3 Then the LORD will go out and fight against those nations, as he fights in the day of battle. 4 On that day his feet will stand on the Mount of Olives, east of Jerusalem, and the Mount of Olives will be split in two from east to west, forming a great valley, with half of the mountain moving north and half moving south. 5 You will flee by my mountain valley, for it will extend to Azel. You will flee as you fled from the earthquake [a] in the days of Uzziah king of Judah. Then the LORD my God will come, and all the holy ones with him.<br>  <br>   6 On that day there will be no light, no cold or frost. 7 It will be a unique day, without daytime or nighttime—a day known to the LORD. When evening comes, there will be light.<br>  <br>   8 On that day living water will flow out from Jerusalem, half to the eastern sea [b] and half to the western sea, [c] in summer and in winter.<br>  <br>   9 The LORD will be king over the whole earth.

But Jerusalem will be raised up and remain in its place, from the Benjamin Gate to the site of the First Gate, to the Corner Gate, and from the Tower of Hananel to the royal winepresses. 11 It will be inhabited; never again will it be destroyed. Jerusalem will be secure.<br>  <br>   12 This is the plague with which the LORD will strike all the nations that fought against Jerusalem: Their flesh will rot while they are still standing on their feet, their eyes will rot in their sockets, and their tongues will rot in their mouths. 13 On that day men will be stricken by the LORD with great panic. Each man will seize the hand of another, and they will attack each other. 14 Judah too will fight at Jerusalem. The wealth of all the surrounding nations will be collected—great quantities of gold and silver and clothing. 15 A similar plague will strike the horses and mules, the camels and donkeys, and all the animals in those camps.

12VQ4ETcaa	It depends on what you mean by affectionate.  If it's casual enough, nobody will give it much thought.  It sounds like you're "touchy feely" enough that you might come across as flirty, though.<br>  <br>  It definitely eliminates a lot of misunderstanding if you keep a greater distance from guys who are taken.  Just think, if the guy is a lech he might blame you for something that was his fault, and his girlfriend would most likely believe him, not you.

Where did you get that from?<br>  <br>  As far as your question is concerned, when Jesus died on the cross, He paid the price for all sins (past present and future) for all mankind.  Any sin you have ever committed, or ever will, was paid for on the cross. God can not, and will not hold them against you for any reason.  The only sin you will ever be judged for is the sin of rejecting Jesus Christ as your Saviour....trusting God, turning from your sins, and accepting Jesus Christ as your Saviour.<br>  <br>  If you give yourself to Him, and turn from your sins, God will accept you.  Remember, if you were truly saved before, you never lost your salvation, just your fellowship.  Simply ask God to forgive you and come back to Him....He never left you.<br>  <br>  If you were not saved before, then, from your heart, turn from you sins, and purpose in your heart that from this day forward, Jesus is going to be your Lord and Saviour.  Get back into church where you can hear the preaching of God's Word, and be around other Christians.  Get back to praying to God and reading His Word.  As you do, God will give you the wisdom and strenght you need to live for HIm.  God bless|`|s7pqFa1eaa	God will not or cannot make you "happy again" you will have to do that for yourself.

As you know, we at the Arab American Community Center have an AmeriCorps National Service Day coming up on May **** 16th, 2009. After much consideration, my co-workers and I have reached aN agreement on a **** worthy cause TO SUPPORT. We would like to serve the DePelchin Children’s Center on that day. WE WILL HOLD a drive (the sooner the better) for VARIOUS items - i.e. deodorant, **** new clothes and toys, CANNED goods, and so on. We **** plan on having this charity drive at a number of places INCLUDING the ARAB COMMUNITY CENTER, VARIOUS churches AND mosques, and **** local SCHOOLS. THIS DRIVE WILL REMAIN OPEN UNTIL the day of the event. On **** National Service Day, we will have a variety of fun and educational activities planNed *** for children OF ALL AGES, ****such as basketball, karaoke, finger panting and so much more. If you have any concerns or would like to give me any advice in regards to our National Service Day, please do not hesitate to give me a call at 832-222-5555. Thank you so much for everything you do and I look forward TO working with you on this worthy cause.|`|SAgCy83Oaa	Actually, the letter is very well written.  I hope the following suggestions don't seem too petty:<br>  Avoid the word "ecstatic."  I would suggest something like "quite pleased" or "very happy."  <br>  Instead of "serve" the DePelchin ... I would suggest "help"<br>  Instead of "varies" the word is "various"<br>  It's "canned goods" not "can goods"<br>  Suggest the following re-write: "We plan to keep the drive's collection points open until the actual National Service Day.  On that day, we will have a variety ..."<br>  It's "planned" not "planed"<br>  In the last sentence, replace the word "everything" with "anything" and insert the phrase "are able to" between 'you' and 'do'<br>  <br>  As I said, it is a better-than-average solicitation letter.

355JLlcLaa	The Mesopotamian creation epic, Enuma Elish, has parallels with the Genesis creation story, and may have been the story from which it was derived, perhaps via another Canaanite story. It starts:<br>  <br>  When on high the heaven had not been named,<br>  Firm ground below had not been called by name,<br>  When primordial Apsu, their begetter,<br>  And Mummu-Tiamat, she who bore them all,<br>  Their waters mingled as a single body,<br>  No reed hut had sprung forth, no marshland had appeared,<br>  None of the gods had been brought into being,<br>  And none bore a name, and no destinies determined--<br>  Then it was that the gods were formed in the midst of heaven.<br>  <br>  This doesn't expressly talk about the creation of time, but it does talk about before heaven or earth had names, when the waters of heaven and earth were intermingled. We can almost go from this straight into Genesis 1:6, And God said, Let there be a firmament (heaven) in the midst of the waters, and let it divide the waters from the waters. <br>  <br>  So it doesn't so much talk about the beginning of time, but when order was created out of chaos.|`|tx4bRDrXaa	no|`|IqqaA2wIaa	IN THE BEGINNING....|`|UH1ipgJmaa	Yes----> Gen 1: 1<br>  <br>  In the beginning (Time), the Lord created Heaven (Space) & the Earth (Earth & all elements inside it)|`|AA10067344	The Bible starts: "In the beginning" I think you could assume that means the beginning of time.|`|zBkaqIWcaa	In the beggining...|`|db7df25ea31227e5641d5c32d43c3bcdaa	earth time yes<br>  <br>  the first day of creation|`|YBRQsmLMaa	Who knows what the Bible really mentions and means?Translation are unrelieable.

C7CaNLGlaa	I'll bet you hate when everyone else, race, color, or creed is stereotyped.  But it's okay to lie about Christians.  <br>  <br>  What would it take to convince me I'm wrong.  If everything suddenly didn't exist.  <br>  <br>  People saw Jesus perform miracles right in front of them.  Many of them still didn't believe He was the Son of God.  All they wanted was to be entertained.   And really, that's all people want out of life now, to be entertained.  Even answers or opinions have to tickle our ears, or they're somehow either invalid or "hateful, racist, and bigoted."|`|ad6559518ee7ea2663bbb774b8106390aa	What is real has to be identified as real by our minds.  Changing opinion will not change reality.  If God is real, the theist is rational in proving that God exists.  If God is unreal, the atheist is rational in saying that there is no evidence for its existence.  The existence or non-existence of something does not DEPEND on our thinking.  It's the other way round.  Our thinking (rational thinking) depends on identifying the real.  <br>  <br>  You cannot have a theist and an a-theist be both right by merely switching opinions.  One is ABSOLUTELY right, while the other is ABSOLUTELY wrong.  One identifies the real, while the other does not.<br>  <br>  <br>  It's pretty much like the argument that says, "How do you know that you exist?  Could you be just a dream in someone else's imagination?" <br>  <br>  If I say that I know I exist and one says he doesn't know if he exists is there a possibility of both being right and rational simply by switching sides?|`|fBvhkalFaa	Very good question to which there are really no answers.  Believers are just that.  We believe because we have a feeling inside that non-believers do not.  In my case, even if God does not exist and it is all a fairy tale, I am a better person for believing that he does.  I really don't know what would convince me I am wrong but I do know this, there are more people that become believers than believers that become non-believers.  Believers are still at the 80% level in this country, that has to tell us something.  If nothing else it says even non Christians believe there is a God.|`|UZ8wsmuFaa	A refutation of Godel's Proof might make me less inclined to believe in a God.<br>  <br>  Such limitations of logic and aspects of quantum mechanics suggest that the universe can not exist as a complete system and therefore cannot be real. If the world is not real it is a dream. Whoever is doing the dreaming may be God. If it is us then we are God or a parts thereof.|`|Ne9rXERpaa	A single amputee spontaneously regenerating his lost limb after offering prayers to the deity of his choice.<br>  <br>  Either that, or Jesus could appear bodily before me and autograph my copy of this book he supposedly wrote, and then take the time to explain the contradictory or absurd parts in a way that only an infinitely intelligent being could...|`|WbaN6osZaa	Some evidence.

OK, that is not completely true. I am not an atheist. I am not a believer. I am not an agnostic. I am none of these because the answer to g-d's existence is unimportant.<br>  <br>  I am what I am and what I am needs no excuses!<br>  <br>  People ask what would convince me that g-d truly exists. While I am not sure, I am certainly open to any tangible evidence. What evidence would convince you that g-d does not exist? Do you see the conundrum?<br>  <br>  Bible passages are not evidence of g-d's existence to me. This is my standard of proof, not yours. However, if proof were proffered that convinced me g-d exists, I would change absolutely nothing in my life or my behavior. Existence or not of g-d does not matter.<br>  <br>  What if evidence were produced that convinced you g-d does not exist with certainty (evidence according to your standards of proof)? What would you change in your life?<br>  <br>  - Would you stop evangelizing?<br>  - Would you start sinning more?<br>  - Would you stop helping those less fortunate than you?<br>  - Would you feel that life is meaningless?<br>  - Would you lose your Raison d'être?<br>  <br>  Atheists such as myself have real moral values perform mitzvahs not for the sake of salvation, but because moral codes and performing good deeds and helping those in need is the right thing to do.|`|1LRNleZOaa	Objective, testable, and verifiable evidence.|`|b0b9cb96feb8ae081bdfc76f84eeb290aa	I'm a fundamentalist, nothing will change me.|`|OeAfpIZAaa	Objective evidence.<br>  <br>  It would also be nice, if the Christians were a little more Christ-like once in a while.|`|leCcd0rfaa	I'm pretty sure it would take a deity punching me repeatedly in the chest to get me to believe that they're real.|`|u6MJPdT9aa	The great and powerful Meebleplex can straighten you out|`|AA11297267	Objective, testable, provable evidence.<br>  That's all...pretty simple.<br>  <br>  Peace.|`|FmazIF6Maa	My religion doesn't rest on being right or wrong, but on learning, and I've changed my position on things over the years. And other positions have been reinforced. <br>  <br>  There is no single fact that would convince me-- it doesn't have to be anything dramatic. I am open to consider any arguments or evidence. I'll think about it, and if I agree with it I will take it  into consideration and probably change my views. <br>  <br>  Changing my views doesn't necessarily mean I'd change my religion. If Atheists convinced me tomorrow that there is nothing supernatural or Divine, I'd still keep my holidays and traditions because they have more meaning to me than if they come from a Divine source. They have a great deal of meaning on the mundane level, on my psychology, and how I live my life. <br>  <br>  Likewise, if someone proved to me that Christians, or Muslims or Jews or Hindus are right, it doesn't necessarily mean I would take up and worship those Gods just because they have proven them to exist.|`|YyEEAJBkaa	A personal visit from god, with full compliment of angels, willing to perfom outstanding miracles on my request.<br>  <br>  Also a full apology|`|LnoyylQ7aa	well seeing a god would do, preferable one which has a know form so it isn't a trick, how bout odin on his stead (don't see 8 legged horses everyday) or poseidon, but one very unique|`|283tO9j9aa	Fossil rabbits in the Precambrian.

However after all this time it would seem to me they have been paid in full.|`|AAgX0SDcaa	Casinos are one of the leading industries in Oklahoma. Everything else in Oklahoma is going downhill. The tribes  put people to work who pay state and federal taxes and the tribe pay taxes to the state on their revenues and also fund tribal scholarships, medical clinics, food programs, etc. The BIA "lost the paperwork" on oil royalties, billions of dollars,  that were owed to Natives living on their own land, and those people have been fighting legally for a decade to get their money back. The Choctaw Nation built a medical clinic with 100% of their own money and nothing from the government so they can run it without red tape.

Time is up & the govt is taking back the land as per their agreement with the Tribal Council many moons ago.  Those beautiful mountain cabins won't look so great after the current owners strip them down to the foundations or leave them as it. I do believe the original leases stated that the land must be returned to the federal govt as it was given...free of all structures.  That's gonna be a mess to deal with.  Especially with the housing shortage out here in California!|`|8Y5nF6ksaa	Because thats a way of saying sorry to them for taking away their land.

They have almost no self esteem, no sense of their abilities or capabilities and because they are brain washed into believing they are only "safe" and "accepted" on the reserve they give in to peer pressure and fall into the drug and alcohol trap.<br>  <br>  Sadly so many die so young, and die violently<br>  <br>  Reserves who have stepped outside that model are closer to major cities, and are able to develop businesses and co-exist successfully with non-native communities. They become self supporting, but there are far too many that dont.<br>  <br>  The reserve system is in todays world, for the most part, a bad idea and the whole concept should be revisited.  It is IMO a complete waste of tax dollars simply because it does no good for most reserves, and in most cases the grants dont even reach the people.|`|UBxKqdPwaa	Have you ever heard of treaties?
y7HD8unTaa	I think we should bailout those who have bad loans with crappy provisions written into them.  Those baloon payments are going to pop up for many people soon & if they don't have a job....how in the heck are they gonna pay out those massive new dollar amounts? If we put all loans on a 30 year fixed rate....these things won't have to happen again.  We also need to keep a better eye on the people who spprove these loans...apparently, many were attained by FRAUD & now these people have taken the money & run away with it.<br>  My kid just purchased a house that was once owned by an agent who maxed it out on loans & if I could find these people....I'd give them an earfull.  What they did to the property was unethical & almost crimimal.  The shoddy repairs & cosmetic crap they was hidden is astounding.  They can & are being fixed....but at the cost to the buyers & Not the banks & that's a huge problem with all of these foreclosures.  SO MANY ARE CRAP & must be torndown or rehabed at a high cost...Most people (including my kid) get stuck with a house that was used to attain cash from the S&L's that are now defunct.  We watchen them close their doors & run into hiding when the investigations started up 2 years ago in Central California.  <br>  <br>  If American doesn't strive to keep WORKING people in their current homes by allowing them to refinance....we all we be paying the price because it's going to be a bigger financial burden to give these people public assistence & house them in shelter or jails & then their children end up in Foster care or Juvenile hall.<br>  <br>  These people won't make it in the streets & their children will become prey for the sexual predetors who look for the people with little or no street smarts in the shelters & helping hand agency food lines.

They are subsidized low-income homes and apartments that were the programs or projects instituted by the government to provide places for people to live who would not and/or could not provide the same for themselves. When our liberal leadership decided that they could garner more votes and support from the low income spectrum by providing much more expensive single family dwellings they instituted the idea of forcing mortgage companies to extend mortgage loans to the same spectrum regardless of peoples ability to make payments on mortgages. Now, our liberal leadership is going to lower the amounts of the mortgage to what ever level it takes for those people to be able to pay. If Attila The Hun runs for public office in the United States and promises the same liberal treatment for the masses Attila is going to win the election and be inaugurated to serve the people. If you don't believe this is going to happen you will soon.|`|fe8RxYsfaa	There are rules on who gets bailout and who doesn't.  Perhaps you should do some research.

X9RoKfWPaa	Hera is the queen of the gods married to zeus. She is the goddess of marriage and fertility. Her animals and symbols are the cow and peacock also with zeus being the playboy in olympus we know him to be she was revered as a jealous queen who would punish any goddess or mortal woman who was not her who she found in bed with zeus. Her clothes were usually toga form with her midsection showing. This site has alot of info on hera on it.

She was the protector of marriage and married women were particular to her.  but when  any account of her gets down to details it shows her chiefly engaged in punishing the many women Zeus fell in love with even when they yielded only because he tricked them.  Hera didn't care, she treated them all the same. The cow and peacock was sacred to her, and Argos was her favorite city. She is always jealous because of the many women who fall in love with zeus. Her animal is the peacock because she can keep watch of zeus with the many 'eyes' on the peacocks tail. <br>  <br>  If you need more info, I would google it.

Caucasians males are particularly attractive to you because their genetic stock is what would be best combined with yours to form healthy, strong and intelligent embryos.<br>  <br>  To reiterate in layman's terms, you like white guys because they have the right kind of genes to mix with yours to make good babies.<br>  <br>  Edit: Very mature answers, guys.|`|Ra9A6tcZaa	LOL you have the slavery complex lol j/k I like white guys to and I am biracial I don't have an obsession but I do prefer them over anyone else|`|HMFR1I01aa	Well, the majority at my school is black and in the past, i had a lot of black guys chased me...They are cute and i did think about giving them a chance; however, i just didn't see myself going out with them!

11a867519828ee7f2df6eda7cb34fb8faa	This is a good question. And I think many times we use the two words as synonyms of one another. I'm not sure but.... I think we think of morals as values or the truth.  It is against our morals to kill another human being.  However, ethics studies different situations and says "ethically speaking how do we make this think come out morally correct?".  For example, ethically speaking, it is okay to take another human life if we are defending our country during a war.  It is morally wrong to kill an unborn infant.  Ethically speaking, if the mother was raped, it is morally sanctioned if she wants an abortion.|`|CM0C65dtaa	My thoughts are that morals pertain more to personal beliefs, and ethics pertain more to what is publicly accepted.  Morally wrong but ethically correct would be doing something for your job that is against your feelings, but accepted in your company, like scooping a client or something.  Ethically wrong but morally correct would be if you thought something was okay, but your company or the public frowned upon it, such as piercings.  These are perhaps not very good examples, but you can hopefully understand what I mean|`|EmV1Kojyaa	Moral:<br>  Of or relating to principles of right and wrong in behaviour: expressing or teaching a conception of right behaviour: conforming to a standard of right behaviour: sanctioned by or operative on one's conscience: capable of right and wrong action.<br>  <br>  Ethical:<br>  The discipline dealing with what is good and bad and with duty and obligation; a theory or system of values and principles of conduct governing a  a group or population.<br>  <br>  Going by the actual definitions, morals are what a person would believe about themself, as in their own character, essence, and inner spirit. Ethics are what 'society' teaches others or leads the way in being an example of or to.<br>  <br>  Personally, I do not conform to the 'ethics' of this world. I have my own set of rules and disciplines and I follow them faithfully. Therefore, in your question, I would not ever be "ethically correct" or "ethically wrong". If you do not participate in the race at all, you do not win or lose.
nT0w6VIKaa	I hope you're documenting!  Record all incidents, time, place, date, what was said/done, who was present...AND KEEP COPIES at home or somewhere else safe.  Since your 'line manager' doesn't seem to know and/or understand what 'hostile work environment' means why not have the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (EEOC) send him some 'specific' information covering such terminology...but do it anonymously.  Once you've documented everything you possibly can and made 'verbal' AND 'written' reports to your 'line manager', supervisor, etc...make sure Human Resources gets a copy...as well as EEOC AND YOUR ATTORNEY...  By the time you're done you should either own the business or be wealthy enough to 'retire' to Spain...  You obviously work with some really 'ignorant' people who don't realize how much trouble they're in...and just how POOR they can be...  Don't give up...see it through and you'll be doing yourself a favour as well as teaching them a lesson they NEED to learn the HARD WAY...|`|DWwv3v9Raa	It is illegal to discriminate, don't let them drive away from your job.

Don't talk to anyone in the company. Just get a lawyer.|`|QdwMhvpCaa	I say just quit, but before you do, make sure you've got another job somewhere else lined up. If they're mean to you, just be nice to them. They want to get a rise out of you, and if they can't do it, then they'll just leave you alone. If this doesn't work, they keep on bullying you, and your manager decides to keep siding with them, then the only thing you can do is find another job and then quit. My mother went through stuff like this, and in the end, she had to quit. Come to find out, all the people in these cliques were doing things like stealing from the company.|`|zavZn6Szaa	As i said earlier after making a formal complaint they have to take you seriously<br>  <br>  i would recommend waiting until you can get some form of evidence though... if the bullying is verbal then a hidden recorder/dictaphone would work... if it is physical then evidence would be present on any form of CCTV<br>  <br>  just so you know it could get to a stage where legal action can be taken against the company if they refuse to reprimand these people so... i would suggest seeing a doctor and saying something along the lines of you feel very stressed working around these people (not feeling well etc) and essentially claiming some form of stress induced illness/depression... this could later be used to reference the effects of the bullying in a legal case<br>  <br>  i hope you manage to find a resolution but you should not feel as though you must quit any these individuals should not prevent you from acheiving what you want to do|`|rJJhMQ37aa	I am sorry you're having such a bad time there.  Hopefully you can make it till you hit your target.<br>  <br>  I sure hope you are documenting all of this.  Writing down every single incident.  Date, time, who said exactly what, who did exactly what.  It may be possible for you to go over the line managers head, if you have some documentation.<br>  <br>  There was a time when I had some problems in my job.  As well as documenting things, I pretended that I was an international super spy working under cover.  A silly little thing to do, I know.

Despite the advancements of science there is still much more we don't know about the world than we do.  As such the mysteries of the world are open to all types of speculation.|`|PkXJRfaBaa	I guess there is a balance. Many people don't believe in the supernatural as there is a lack of evidence for it, whilst many people believe in the supernatural because there is a lack of evidence against it.<br>  <br>  I'm one of those people who'll believe in something until I'm proven wrong, so until I'm proven wrong by science, I'll continue to believe in the supernatural (nicer name than paranormal!) lol.<br>  <br>  Hope my opinion helped you.|`|SDDgbtQ4aa	Ah, but there is evidence of ghosts.<br>  <br>  Though ghosts are considered to be earthbound spirits - the soul of a person who has died and choose not to "cross over", so I don't believe they are intermediaries between the gods and the living.|`|dFBccLExaa	Because science doesn't have proof for everything.

People who had the plague used to dress in hooded robes and harvest crops until they died, this is where the idea of the Grim Reaper comes from as he holds the pick axey thing (can't remember what it's called) and he wears the heavy, black robe. And as people were underfed at that time, particularly slaves who were more likely to catch the disease than the richer folk, that's where the idea of the Grim Reaper being a skeleton comes from.<br>  <br>  In affect, I guess you could be a Grim Reaper for a day, as long as you went to a doctor ASAP to get rid of the plague.<br>  <br>  Hope I helped!

Everybody's cirucumstances are different, so there is no age limit if a person needs to live at home (as long as he pays rent).<br>  <br>  As far as his part-time job goes, I'm assuming he had another job and was laid off like millions of other people in this country have been and this part-time job is all he can get right now?  If that's the case, you shouldn't look down on what type of work he's doing.<br>  <br>  Maybe he's not sure of your relationship and that's the real reason he won't move in together.|`|Ao3Fl3iSaa	no - in this current economic downturn<br>  I used to think so, but nowadays what a person does is their business<br>  as long as he is not leeching or causing any type of problems at home<br>  who cares? after all it's his life and not anyone elses<br>  <br>  <br>  has he given you a reason for not wanting to move in with you?<br>  maybe that's a big step for him and he's not sure<br>  it may be a case of insecurity<br>  change could be a scary thing for him<br>  or<br>  Dating for 3 years is not the same as living with someone<br>  at that point you will really get to know the other person<br>  their habits and maybe there are things he may be embarrassed <br>  to show you or have you find out<br>  <br>  Edit<br>  Whoops, didn't see that part time work<br>  <br>  In that case, ask him what he wants for the future<br>  If he's not going to college and only working 1 part time job<br>  it's a signal|`|cSqx1DxKaa	I think the main question here ought to be, why is a 27 year old only working at a minimum wage part time job?  At that age, shouldn't he be doing a little more with his life?<br>  <br>  And I wouldn't critisize Jennifer for being "too stupid to pay so much for an apartment".  Perhaps Jennifer has no need for taxpayer-funded public assistance like you do, and/or works harder than you do to stay off it.  $300 a month with no utilities is surreal in any geographic location.|`|rThIVk2maa	it depends upon the situation. If the person has clung on this long because their overindulgent parents don't want them to leave the nest, then that's not quite healthy. Judging by your tone, this the case, is it not?<br>  <br>  Do you really want to have to take over for his mommy if he moves in with you? Think twice before you pursue this.|`|CfjxKLHDaa	In general, all men and women should have completed their post-secondary education (college or vocational) by 23 years of age.  After that, they should get a job and move out of their parents’ home.  Then they should live by themselves for at least a year (no girlfriend or boyfriend).<br>  <br>  Why do they need this?  Because they need to grow up and start acting like mature and responsible adults.  They should learn to hold a job, pay their bills and student loans on time, stay out of debt, cook and clean for themselves, iron their clothes, etc.  This will cut the emotional “umbilical cord” from their parents and enable them to start living on their own.  They should also experience loneliness and how do deal with it.  This is not easy but it is a practical right of passage for both young men and young women.<br>  <br>  Unfortunately, the economic situation is not in favor for most young people so they end up living with their parents.  However, the next best thing is to live with you because you are not his parents but his female companion (girlfriend, wife, etc.) and he has to be a responsible adult if he is going to live with you.  If he does not then you will eventually kick him out.  This means if he is going to live with you, he has to get a better and full-time job.  This also means that you and he have to live like a married couple that is responsible.  Sorry, it goes with adulthood.  <br>  <br>  You are just going to have a good talk and ask him how his future will fit in with yours.  Remember, his parents will not live forever.  <br>  <br>  What I am trying to say is that it is time for him to grow up.  Show this to him and have him email me if he wants more details.  I am 50 years old and have 32 years of life experiences since high school.<br>  <br>  The answer is yes, he is too old to be living with his parents.<br>  <br>  Additional Comment: You should not critize Jennifer for stating a realistic renting scenerio.  Even in low cost areas, a studio apartment without utilites is about $600 per month.  Plus, no one wants to live in low cost housing or poor neighborhoods unless they have to.<br>  <br>  Additional Comment:  Just remember you people who gave me thumbs down, I know about the economic situation and how people lost their jobs.  But at 27 you should at least be honest with you mate on why the way you are.  The real world does not care how you think or feel.  When it tells you to grow up then you grow up or else it will pass you by.  This man will be 30 years old in less than three years and he does not have any reaslistic outlook on his life, at least that is what I am interperting from his girl friend.  And real adult couples comminicate whether it is for better or worse.  I can take that "to the bank".|`|O4jGlC2caa	He works part-time at Wal-Mart.  That's why he has to live with his parents.  Not sure how you pulled off a $300 per month with no utilities apartment, but it sounds like you live in a government-assisted roach motel.  I mean, that's the only way you could pull that off.  Most apartments I see are $500 without utilities.  Go to New York or some place like that, and you pay $1000-$2000 for some lame studio apartment.<br>  <br>  Does he have a college degree?  These are tough times, and if Wal-Mart means a paycheck, so be it.  I'd rather live with my parents in a nice home and give money towards their bills than live in a questionable apartment.<br>  <br>  Finally, this could mean that he isn't thinking about the relationship the way you are.  You want to take that next step.  He is happy just being a boyfriend.  He won't cut the umbilical cord.  In that case, you may want to consider moving on.|`|Gem96NQyaa	I lived at home until I was 27... at which point I'd saved enough to buy a house instead of renting an apartment.<br>  <br>  But in your case, I would question why he doesn't want to move in with you.  It may be that he's simply afraid of commitment.  Moving in with someone (especially when you're not self-sufficient, which working part time at Walmart, he most certainly isn't) is a big step.  If things end badly, where does he go from there?|`|0003a5b50268aea93401640c3a727d6faa	He is being very wise about his decision.  He is not in a position to pay a lot of rent, bills, etc., and obviously not ready to live with/commit to living with a woman.<br>  <br>  There is nothing wrong with him living with his parents, it they are okay with that, then it has nothing to do with you - it is his choice.|`|24cfb9540386b800bb43a544c412b806aa	My concern would be that all he has done with his life so far is obtain a part-time job at WalMart. If he were living there to save up money to buy his own home, or while he finished college, it would be OK. But this sounds like someone with no ambition and no direction. He's just existing and doesn't want a real life. Why are you wasting your time with him? And why would you want him to move in with you where you have to support him?|`|LGidAYDwaa	The guy's a loser.

Remember, though, that in those ancient feudal times the pope's call was effective *because* of the feudal system.  Your king is Roman Catholic?  He sees opportunity in the Holy Land for his second (and third and fourth and fifth) sons?  Let's send a bunch of people off to seize booty from the Muslims!  It's not only "for the faith" - it's also "for our pockets..."<br>  <br>  SO, certainly.  Remember, even during the time of the crusades, the pope did not use his authority over nobility - which consisted primarily of excommunication and interdict - in order to gain support for the Crusades.  The nobility saw advantage in such campaigns - both religious AND practical.  The pope's "authority" really didn't matter:  his primary contribution being the ability (not authority) to convince all of these warring nations to combine their forces for such an effort at particular moments in time.<br>  <br>  Jim, <a href="http://www.bible-reviews.com" rel="nofollow">http://www.bible-reviews.com</a>|`|2f6d591b87634e2c1909160eb45e94a1aa	The Pope has just as much authority to declare a Crusade today as he ever did.<br>  <br>  It's just that today people wouldn't listen to him, and back then he did.<br>  <br>  Very few people ever get any good instruction on the Crusades. They tend to think that the Crusaders were a single organized Army. This is VERY far from the truth. The Crusaders were individuals who volunteered to go, and their feudal retainers, if any. There was never any overall organization and there was almost as much fighting between the Crusaders as there was with the Arabs and the Turks.<br>  <br>  The first Crusade worked because even though it was a disorganized mess, the Arabs were even MORE disorganized, and they didn't know how to fight European knights.  By the time of the 3rd Crusade Saladin had put together a more or less serious Arab command structure, and they were able to organize their forces better...but the Crusaders hadn't...that's why the last Crusades kept failing. The 4th Crusade didn't even get to Jerusalem, Venice managed to divert it and use it to attack Constantinople instead!<br>  <br>  The Pope wasn't in command, the Emperor in Constantinople wasn't in Command, no one European noble wasn't in Command. <br>  <br>  So bottom line, the Pope's authority then was purely symbolic, same as today.|`|9ed79b2c402a7fe054faaa860538c607aa	No, he is just a spiritual guide for us, not a political leader.<br>  <br>  Back during the Crusades, the Pope had much more power than the king, so he could declare a war, and that is where corruption began.

Crusades were fought mainly against Muslims, though campaigns were also directed against pagan Slavs, Jews, Russian and Greek Orthodox Christians, Mongols, Cathars, Hussites, Waldensians, Old Prussians, and political enemies of the popes. Crusaders took vows and were granted an indulgence for past sins.<br>  <br>  The Crusades originally had the goal of recapturing Jerusalem and the Holy Land from Muslim rule and were launched in response to a call from the Eastern Orthodox Byzantine Empire for help against the expansion of the Muslim Seljuk Turks into Anatolia. The term is also used to describe contemporaneous and subsequent campaigns conducted through to the 16th century in territories outside the Levant, usually against pagans, heretics, and peoples under the ban of excommunication, for a mixture of religious, economic, and political reasons. Rivalries among both Christian and Muslim powers led also to alliances between religious factions against their opponents, such as the Christian alliance with the Sultanate of Rum during the Fifth Crusade.<br>  <br>  The Crusades had far-reaching political, economic, and social impacts, some of which have lasted into contemporary times. Because of internal conflicts among Christian kingdoms and political powers, some of the crusade expeditions were diverted from their original aim, such as the Fourth Crusade, which resulted in the sack of Christian Constantinople and the partition of the Byzantine Empire between Venice and the Crusaders. The Sixth Crusade was the first crusade to set sail without the official blessing of the Pope. The Seventh, Eighth and Ninth Crusades resulted in Mamluk and Hafsid victories, as the Ninth Crusade marked the end of the Crusades in the Middle East.|`|GMmmbLGRaa	Catholic Church, vatican se and Pope are the anti-christ<br>  Read this; <br>  <br>  on March 11, 2008 this what the vatican did; Vatican Adds Seven New Deadly Sins Including Damaging Environment and Drug Dealing.<br>  <br>  The new deadly sins include polluting, genetic engineering, being obscenely rich, drug dealing, abortion, pedophilia and causing social injustice.<br>  <br>  This is what the Bible says about this;<br>  <br>  Revelation 22 :18For I testify unto every man that heareth the words of the prophecy of this book, If any man shall add unto these things, God shall add unto him the plagues that are written in this book: <br>  <br>  19And if any man shall take away from the words of the book of this prophecy, God shall take away his part out of the book of life, and out of the holy city, and from the things which are written in this book.<br>  <br>  The Vatican Se also calls itself holy;<br>  <br>  The Vatican City State, sovereign and independent, is the survivor of the papal states that in 1859 comprised an area of some 17,000 sq mi (44,030 sq km). During the struggle for Italian unification, from 1860 to 1870, most of this area became part of Italy. By an Italian law of May 13, 1871, the temporal power of the pope was abrogated, and the territory of the papacy was confined to the Vatican and Lateran palaces and the villa of Castel Gandolfo. The popes consistently refused to recognize this arrangement. The Lateran Treaty of Feb. 11, 1929, between the Vatican and the kingdom of Italy, established the autonomy of the Holy See.<br>  <br>  What does the Bible say about this? Only God is Holy.<br>  <br>  “Holy, holy, holy, is the LORD of hosts: the whole earth is full of his glory.” Isaiah 6:3<br>  <br>  The basic meaning of the word “holy” is “to cut” or “to separate.” This means God is completely separate from anyone, anything, any idea, any measurement, any imagination, any intellect, any power, etc. Some limit His holiness as meaning He is separate from evil. While that is true, I believe that definition is too limited in application of its meaning. HE IS SEPARATE FROM ALL. I prefer to say it this way: God is completely “OTHER”. What ever you can name, GOD IS OTHER. “For my thoughts are not your thoughts, neither are your ways my ways, saith the LORD. For as the heavens are higher than the earth, so are my ways higher than your ways, and my thoughts than your thoughts.” He is saying that He is completely beyond and completely OTHER than whatever we are or whatever we can think. GOD IS HOLY!!! “Who shall not fear thee, O Lord, and glorify thy name? For thou only art holy.” (Revelation 15:4) Everything everywhere is connected to something else, but God is completely separate, “God is HOLY.”|`|h5q89E3Haa	The Pope will listen to the Holy Spirit. <br>  <br>  Maybe you should read Revelations and understand what is yet to come?<br>  <br>  All Christians are in an on going Crusade until the end of times.<br>  <br>  It was declared by Jesus Christ himself, anyone that denies that denies God.

d20feb0d03f94b65cc82fb1a12566011aa	I consider Zeitgeist to be an intellectually dishonest documentary, not because of the filmmakers personal bias, but because of its disregard for the truth. There is so much questionable statements that can easily be refuted, or controversial points that have legitimate opposing views that should have been presented.<br>  <br>  - Regarding part 1: Jesus<br>  <br>  The "Mythology of Jesus" theory was an obscure and generally dismissed theory. <br>  It has gained exposure due to author "Acharya S" and her collaboration with the Zeitgeist filmmaker. (She is also author of the films companion guide). But even the casual but astute viewer will find considerable silliness in the some of the conjectures where practically any numerical or astrological connection 'proves' mytholical derision. Son=sun? Three stars in Orions belt = three kings? Virgo = Mary because the astrological sign sort of looks like an M? Who buys this stuff?<br>  <br>  Some other views:<br>  <br>  " The idea of Jesus as a myth is rejected by the majority of biblical scholars and historians. In 2004, Richard Burridge and Graham Gould stated that they did not know of any "respectable" scholars that held the view today. Robert E.

Jesus is a fraud.|`|klZK6UhNaa	Well, yeah.<br>  EDIT.<br>  The idea that the film is against any group is a fallacy. The only thing the film addresses is ideology and beliefs. Sadly, many don't realize that one's ideology is not them. We are emergent beings and everything we believe is taught to us one way or another. Therefore to say the film is attacking "Christians" is about as absurd as saying the film attacks people with baseball caps. This is a serious problem in our society, for identity is erroneously associated with belief. Once again, propagandists against the project use this idea that the film "attacks" a group in order to try and manipulate their surroundings into not thinking critically about the information. The same kind of propaganda has materialized where the project has been called "new world order", "satanic" "marxist" and other irrational, thoughtless distinctions not worth bringing up.|`|ux7Wgh6Gaa	Do you mean zeitgeist in the historical sense?

zdu3gh8jaa	Hi there,<br>  Well as you say the only way to deal with this is to begin to tell people. Could you not try a letter to your mum or some thing like that first to see what reaction you will get from everyone else? At the end of the day, if 'friends' walk away when they find out your secret, and as long as it's not bad or downright illegal then they are not worth your friendship. Try finding a 'stranger' and letting them know and judge their reaction and advice. Or leave little clues around your home if you can do that and when anyone asks just say whatever it is that you are keeping quiet. <br>  Without know what your problem is, I am unable to offer support or suggestions on how to deal withit, but I wish you well for the future and hope that you feel you can explain to someone soon. Good Luck.|`|h6cYQaxYaa	Yeah. If you are going to have big build up like that you need to put you "secret" on it. This is a good place to do it. No one know who you really are. My name is not even Jen.|`|qMkwvT6Paa	I lived a life full of secrets and then one day I told someone EVERYTHING...my deepest darkest secret and you know what she said-<br>  <br>  "SO, thats really not a big deal"<br>  <br>  My point being that no matter what your feeling... someone has felt it, no matter what you've done... someone else has done it. It's my experience that it is MUCH more painful to keep the secret then tell and have the person do whatever it is that they want to do. <br>  <br>  We can't control how people react to our feelings, but I do know is that WE ALL usually are wrong and blow things up in our heads. *** Besides if your friends are going to judge, I would strongle suggest gettting new friends that won't :) We're only human...we make mistakes....we have crazy thoughts...we do crazy things...and sometimes we do it more than once. So it's good to have friends that stick with you no matter what since there will probably be a time you need to expose another secret.
3q3QXQp4aa	Depends on how good a friend it is. Might think your just trying to get naked. Does she know you are on her computer anyway???|`|pl96lkzIaa	She might be a bit freaked out, but you know her so you should hopefully be able to predict her reaction.  I would probably advise against it.  If you have light-colored boxers on, definitely don't do it.|`|rThIVk2maa	For heaven's sake just ask her if you can borrow a pair from her dad or if boxers are okay, you don't need our permission.|`|216d90e6aa749da6fe51585ee054ef87aa	I would not if I were you unless I swam alone.<br>  <br>  nfd?|`|YJVmL9Ubaa	It wouldn't bother me,as long as you haven't just met her,if you don't know her well than she might think you're a perv.Boxers are better than those stupid satin underwear neon things some guys wear,they look so stupid in them,what are they called??|`|KNYkexELaa	She will be once you get out of the pool.|`|Ao3Fl3iSaa	you asked this 13hours ago.<br>  Like i said before, just swim in your jeans and get a good workout at the same time.|`|AA10451488	Please don't do that. Boxers have an "access area", and what will you do if "willy" wants to be free!!??<br>  <br>  Please wear trunks. Appropriate attire is appropriate for a reason. Swimming in boxers is like swimming in denim cut-off's... low class and inappropriate.

Whenever I talk alot, it's only about things that I actually know about. Or I talk about things that no one else notices. I used to talk more when I was younger, but I don't talk as much now because I just don't have much to talk about anymore with anyone, except my husband.<br>  I do find people that talk more than me highly annoying, though. I knew this girl in high school that would never shut up. I truly mean never. During a test, she'd talk to herself because she couldn't talk to anyone else...she'd whisper and stuff. She was always so full of it. I couldn't be mean to her, though, because she was always so nice to me and she always looked up to me. She was a really nice girl, she was just overly talkative and very full of it.|`|8MzVCzi0aa	stop being loquacious|`|uo4Ky2sfaa	nothing much...<br>  I just try to listen<br>  They are just very curious people<br>  trying to know everything.

If the Caucausians and Hispanics want to have their own pageant, the same applies. It's just how it is.|`|3di4X6VPaa	Yeah.<br>  I'm probably going to get a lot of thumbs-down for saying this, but I don't really care:<br>  White people were racist to blacks, now it looks like black people are gonna do the same thing to whites pretty soon.|`|mmeVN3zKaa	This concept could be applied to so many things. People are to afraid to be offensive in any way to the point where they aren't even telling the truth. Actually don't ask me, it's totally crazy.

SDDgbtQ4aa	It can, because it is pure energy - earthbound spirits need to draw on energy from their surroundings in order to manifest to the living if they are attempting to communicate.<br>  <br>  Earthbound spirits do not belong here, which is why their energy can wreak havoc in our lives.  It is not usually their intention though, to cause us any negativity or harm - it's just what happens if they are present for too long.  They need to "cross over".<br>  <br>  You may want to check out medium Mary Ann Winkowski's book "When Ghosts Speak" - it explains a lot about how a spirit's energy can affect us.|`|Hr2tnZtqaa	I believe it can I don't know about being cold or lack of energy though. It can make you depressed which can give you lack of energy. Think about how it is to be around  someone who is always draining your energy by all their problems.

There are so many energy draining illness out there and lack of iron can make you feel cold..|`|QTgm2ZTvaa	well maybe, LOL nver experience one, but something entering your own body is tiresome XD<br>  <br>  and you do extraordinary things too, some sort of a adrenaline rush without your sanity LOL|`|snWybep8aa	Possibly.

CM0C65dtaa	I am a quiet person, and also get miffed at people thinking everyone should be a raging extrovert, like there is something wrong with being quiet.

People who make such accusations probably don't understand why people are so quiet...<br>  and i completely agree on the 'better listeners thing. very true...|`|8rbQBaIeaa	I think because quiet people are more complex or so people think. They don't know what you are thinking, and so they have to put a name tag to you. I go both ways. I can be a quiet as a church mouse or as loud as an elephant. Depends on who I am around. Here's an for instance. My  son and I went out to eat...They were teasing us because they said...your mom is weird...when your here she is so much fun, and when she is by herself we don't know if she is mad or what...she don't talk. I have never noticed that about myself because I thought I was always outgoing. But looking back, I am very reserved when I don't have someone with me.|`|jNuS3LWtaa	I agree, quiet people are probably more intelligent or at least less arrogant than a loudmouth with an inferiority complex.

AA11120822	Followers of any religion would seem to be just as robotic if they adhered to all the requirements of their respective dogmas.

Some of which are baptism and a temple marriage.  We also have to keep those covenants, not just enter into them.<br>  <br>  All those things you mentioned, they are part of the gospel.  I'm not sure how keeping the commandments is robotic, but whatever.<br>  <br>  You may think it's all made up, that's your own opinion.  It is our belief that it is true.  And you're right, we can't "earn" salvation.  That comes only through the grace of Christ, we know that and believe if whole-heartedly.  BUT, we will all be judged upon our works and deeds.  And in order to receive Exalation, there are certain "works" that must be done...<br>  Works are important - otherwise, why would Christ Himself do good works His whole life, and then admonish us to follow Him??|`|b7Lo5IAZaa	Ya, Christ's example of getting baptized and setting the standard was just something he did for himself. <br>  <br>  Why do you care anyway what we live?

You should get out more.<br>  <br>  Whether we have the truth or not is a question for another time. But we DO the will of God as we understand it. A misreading of some of Paul's teachings can allow for someone to believe that they must only say a few words, then salvation is assured. However, to believe so requires ignoring what God himself said.<br>  <br>  Jesus said, "Not every one that saith unto me, Lord, Lord, shall enter into the kingdom of heaven; but he that doeth the will of my Father which is in heaven." Matt. 7: 21<br>  <br>  He also said, "But he that shall endure unto the end, the same shall be saved." Matt. 24: 13<br>  <br>  Also, James testified that faith alone cannot save us, but faith with our works. (Several verses in the book of James)<br>  <br>  In Revelation, the books are opened and the dead are judged according to their works. Rev. 20: 12 "And I saw the dead, small and great, stand before God; and the books were opened: and another book was opened, which is the book of life: and the dead were judged out of those things which were written in the books, according to their works." (King James Version)<br>  <br>  If we are living a false religion, but serving God to the best of our ability, God will know that and correct us on the other side. However, doing nothing but saying a few words, then spending our time trying to destroy others' faith doesn't seem to be the best way to serve God, in my opinion.|`|XKzUsb7zaa	The Bible does say that you need to be baptized, it is our proclamation to God and people that we believe.|`|ByyfoeAUaa	Actually the Bible DOES say that you ought to be baptized to enter the Kingdom of God read John 3:5|`|8747ad5946dec06c50e2f01268404c87aa	They<br>  a<br>  r<br>  e<br>  not<br>  ROBOTIC.<br>  They <br>  -n-n-n-n-n-never<br>  ddddddddddddddddd<br>  >>>>>THWOCK!!!!<<<<<<<<<br>  do <br>  anything <br>  wrong.

aRaMjnQ1aa	Each muslim who is capable must pay 2.5% of his/her annual income.|`|y7UmWr4raa	Charity ?<br>  <br>  Meaning in Islamic terms:<br>  <br>  <br>  The payment of Zakat becomes obligatory on every sane and mature Muslim and Muslimah whenever there is an economic activity resulting in the net increase in their wealth.<br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  More info:<br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  The following are the categories of production. Profit, investments and savings are subject to Zakat.<br>  <br>  1. They produce of land.The rate is one tenth of the produce of the unirrigated and undeveloped land and one twentieth of the produce of the irrigated and developed land.<br>  <br>  2. Pure economic profit business.<br>  <br>  3. Inheritance, once for all.<br>  <br>  4. Cash, investments, food, merchandise, jewelry, gold and silver kept in the inventory for full one year and above the certain value defined as Nisab.<br>  <br>  <br>  The rate of Zakat on each of the above categories is different.<br>  <br>  The rate of Zakat and the amount of Nisab can be decided by the Islamic State taking into consideration the prevailing standard of living and the risks and uncertainties of different modes of productions.<br>  <br>  For the articles in category four the rate of Zakat is two and half percent on the amount which is more than the Nisab.<br>  <br>  The Nisab for certain articles is as follows: Silver; 200 dirhams or 21 ozs., Gold; 3 ozs.,<br>  <br>  Merchandise, jewelry etc. equal to 21 ozs. of Silver.<br>  <br>  If the individual items in category 4 do not come up to the Nisab but the combined value of all the items is more than Nisab, Zakat is obligatory.<br>  <br>  It should be kept in mind that these rates of Zakat are the minimum rates and the Muslims have been urged by Allah and the Prophet time and again to pay as much as they can after providing for their legitimate needs.<br>  <br>  Thus the rate of Zakat and the amount of Nisab is dynamic with a given minimum, but the maximum amount is left to the Ijma of Ummah.<br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  Who is deserving of Zakat<br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  The Holy Quran describes the following eight categories who are entitled<br>  <br>  to receive Zakat.<br>  <br>  1. Fuqara: the people who have some money but not enough to meet their<br>  <br>  needs. They live in a precarious circumstances but do not ask for help.<br>  <br>  2. Miskins: these are a very miserable people who do not have anything for<br>  <br>  food, clothing and shelter. The Khalifa Umar ibn al-Khattab also included in them those<br>  <br>  who are fit to earn but do not have means to earning.<br>  <br>  3. Aamileen (Collectors of Zakat): the officials engaged in the collection and distribution of Zakat are paid from the Zakat fund.<br>  <br>  4. Muallafat-ul-Qulub (Those whose hearts are to be reconciled): this includes the new Muslims, to strengthen them in Islam, as well as those for whom it may be necessary to give Zakat to win their heart.<br>  <br>  5. Fir-riqab.(Emancipation of slaves): this means the person who wants to free himself from the shackles of slavery should be given Zakat so that he can pay to this category (those persons who are imprisoned for nonpayment of fines).<br>  <br>  6.Al-Gharimeen: this means the people who are in debt, which is more than the assets so that after paying the debt, their wealth that is left is less than the Nisab.?                                <br>  <br>  7.Fi Sabeelillah (in the cause of Allah ): this is a common word used for all good deeds, but in the case of Zakat it means rendering help to an endeavor to serve Islam such as the propagation of Islam, Jihad, etc.<br>  <br>  8.Ibn-us-Sabil (the wayfarer): a traveler, if he is in need of money while traveling , is entitled to Zakat .<br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  Some essential Points about Zakat<br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  1.A person who qualifies to pay Zakat is not eligible to receive.<br>  <br>  2. It is not permissible to pay Zakat to your husband , wife, parents , grandparents, and the children and grandchildren.<br>  <br>  3 Expenditure to Zakat fund is not permissible on the construction of mosque.<br>  <br>  4. It is preferable to pay Zakat to deserving relatives.<br>  <br>  5. The Zakat of every locality should be spent on the poor inhabitants of the same community except if there is a calamity in other parts of the country or the world.<br>  <br>  6. Any one who qualifies to receive Zakat, can be given it as assistance or a gift, without telling him that it is Zakat.<br>  <br>  7. All articles of household use and properties given on rent are exempted from paying Zakat.<br>  <br>  8, Zakat money of a particular year could be spent during the same year in advance, could be given all at once or in installments.<br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  The collection of Zakat<br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  In the Islamic state, it is the responsibility of the state to collect and distribute Zakat. The Quran says, "Take alms of their wealth and make them pure and clean "<br>  <br>  The Prophet says: I have been commanded to collect zakat from the rich among you and distribute it to the poor among you.<br>  <br>  In case an Islamic society does not exist or in a non-Islamic society, the local organization of the Muslims should make arrangements for the collection and distribution of Zakat.<br>  <br>  Wherever such arrangements exist, every Muslim is required to pay Zakat to this organization and conform to the rates and the amount of Nisab decided by the organization.<br>  <br>  Allah has made Zakat one of the pillars of Islam and has often mentioned it in the Quran immediately after the Prayer, saying, "And perform Prayer and give Alms ".<br>  <br>  The Prophet said, "Islam has been built on five [pillars]: testifying that there is no god but Allah and that Muhammad is the Messenger of Allah, performing the prayers, paying the Zakat, making the pilgrimage to the House (Hajj), and fasting in Ramadan" (Bukhari, Muslim).<br>  <br>  Allah has warned those who do not give Zakat that they will face dire consequence. He says, "O you who believe! Verily, there are many of the rabbis and the monks who devour the wealth of mankind in falsehood, and hinder (them) from the way of Allah. And those who hoard up gold and silver, and spend it not in the Way of Allah-announce unto them a painful torment (Quran 9:34).<br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  For more:<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.soundvision.com/Info/zakat/" rel="nofollow">http://www.soundvision.com/Info/zakat/</a>|`|NlQhkgFCaa	<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zakat" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zakat</a>|`|sE94HgDBaa	Zakat? It is obligatory charity in Islam.  It is one of the five pillars of Islam, mandatory for each Muslim who is not indigent.|`|mOWyzwubaa	Our Islamic scholars interpret both Zakat and Sadaqaa as charity. And whatever instruction Allah has given in the Quran in the following verse for Sadaqaat they attribute it to Zakat. <br>  <br>  Alms [Sadaqaat] are for the poor and the needy, and those employed to administer the (funds); for those whose hearts have been (recently) reconciled (to Truth); for those in bondage and in debt; in the cause of God; and for the wayfarer: (thus is it) ordained by God, and God is full of knowledge and wisdom. [Yusuf Ali (9:60)] <br>  <br>  But, first of all, why would Allah use two different terms if they mean exactly the same thing? It does not make sense. Secondly, the Arabic language also does not support it. While the root meaning of Zakat comes from Z-K-W , meaning growth and development, the root meaning of Sadaqaa comes from the root S-D-Q , meaning truth and power. Therefore, all the words that are derived from this root will have these two meanings (truth and power) embedded in them. Siddeeq is one who proves his trust and belief by his actions. As-Sadaqatu is anything that is given in the way of Allah voluntarily to prove one’s promise and belief in Him as opposed to Zakat, which is compulsory [Tajul ‘Uroos]. Therefore, Sadaqqa has a different purpose in Islam than Zakat and both cannot be equated with each other. How can income tax (a compulsory thing) be equated with charity (a voluntary thing)? <br>  <br>  The Function of Sadaqaat <br>  <br>  Initially, Allah asks us for Sadaqaa (charity – voluntary giving), which is used to gradually change a wrong, unbalanced economic system (based on capitalist politics of greed) to a balanced one that guarantees equal economic opportunities and protection to all. The rich are asked to give their surplus wealth back to the nascent Islamic state for the benefit of the poor and suffering—the ones who really worked hard for creating that wealth in the first place. The instruction about Sadaqaat in verse (9:60) above would gradually change an unjust economic system to one that would ultimately be based on the economics of Zakat. <br>  <br>  Thus charity is an emergency measure whereas Zakat is a permanent feature of Islam. Also, by making charity a short-term solution, the Quran recognizes that long-term or indefinite dependence of individuals and nations upon others invariably leads to degradation of the human self, to loss of human dignity, and to lack of human freedom and thought – all of which constitute human growth and development.

They like both sexes but they still have one partner at a time, either a boy or a girl. Only few sluts or so want both at the same time. That's because of their slvttiness not because they're bisexual. You can't bring down all bisexual. Because for me, if i go out with a girl I would be super faithful to her and if it's a serious relationship then i would be a lesbian til she hurt me or we dont make it then im bi and if i guy go for me, I would be straight if me and him are serious too. Bisexual just means that you like both. Just like u, u can like more than one girl, or attracted to one but there are many girls out there. For bisexual they like both and more options for them.

I don't think your argument 'Guys she's never gonna stop liking girls...' is any good, why should that be a problem, my bf likes blondes and I dont, he's never gonna stop but I'm not gonna stop dating him because of that, and he likes that I'm bisexual. We don't need to make up our minds, we already have. This is my opinion which you wont like: Everyone is Bisexual to some extent|`|FsCQuTsvaa	Omg people have posted that her over 10 time's nobody cares about your dirty views.

It's what racists do (not saying this is racism, I'm not stupid. It is prejudice though).<br>  ---<br>  Sammie has every right to be upset. Your judging and entire (huge) group of people based on the actions of a few, and on something that they have NO control over. How does that make you any different then Fred Phelps? Or the KKK?<br>  <br>   Why should I be hated for something I tried not to be? That I never chose? That I have no control over?<br>  <br>   Her anger is justified. Your hate isn't.<br>  <br>   If you are going to hate me, hate me for my actions, for things I have done. Don't hate me for something I have no choice over, don't hate me for things OTHER people have done.
3RQkgTSOaa	Many of us find "other family," people who are like us and support us despite our real families. Don't disown your real family but bear in mind that they may not be capable of shifting their mindset enough to allow you to be YOU. They want you to be who THEY THINK you should be but that is not their choice.<br>  <br>  Much of this is also impacted by the "what will the neighbors think?" mentality. Getting people to shift AWAY from social pressure and conformity is difficult. But it will help if you are forthright, self-assured and proud of who and what you are. Many times your family may not WANT you to be the way you are because they fear for your safety and well-being. As well-intentioned as that may be, it's wrong to insist that someone be something they are not. By demonstrating you are able to handle your life and roll with the punches, perhaps your family will see that being a lesbian ISN'T such a hindrance to your happiness and success.<br>  <br>  Good luck and just be U.|`|SaQ5d420aa	The road to sexual reassignment is long and will test your resolve to go through the many procedures.  You will need some support from friends, at least.<br>  If your family is not with you on this journey, I suggest you wait, and wait.  Live your life as female as necessary and male when possible.  After a few years, when you are on your own, and have the resources and mental backing of a loving group of people, then you can seek professional help to decide if sex-reassignment is really for you.<br>  As for the forced training to be straight: maybe it is best that you don't push this issue with your family.  Live your life: be happy.  As your life-style becomes something they see as a positive factor in your daily life, they can come around to your point of view.  You will have to be strong, but not combative during this phase of your life.  <br>  Live life lovingly.  Look for people who can support you: school gay alliances, volunteer where gay people are likely to be found.  Stuff like that.  It can be lonely if all you focus on is fighting your family.<br>  Good luck.|`|EOaFZoNtaa	The straight thing is a waste of money. no one can turn you straight and for someone you love to think that well that's not right and that's not supporting you. <br>  <br>  if you want to become a man then you should first consult a doctor if your serious about it. then the doctor will give you a therapist number because you have to see if your doing it for the right reasons. And if you are you can go along with the procedures. if your family doesn't support you, you are at the age of legal consent to move out and have medical things done without parental permission. so you do not have to get them to approve. Maybe you should also talk to them about all of this, but be prepared for some back lash. <br>  i have had a friend who went threw the change. so if you need any support e-mail me and i will be happy to talk to you!<br>  Hope this helps<br>  Cheers :)|`|gLVbSrx6aa	Nothing can turn you straight if you're not. Trust me, my parents have threatened to do the same thing, and they've both introduced me to their friends' daughters, some of which were really pretty, hoping I'd be attracted to them... but I wasn't. <br>  <br>  If your family truly cares about you, they would support your decisions. I think if they have a good heart, they would anyway, even if it takes a lot of time for them to get there.|`|LT8blW3Oaa	honey being LGBT is one of the hardest roads to travel in life,  sometimes we feel like the whole world is against us but if we follow our heart everything will fall into  place the way it should sometimes that works out for us sometimes it doesn't unfortunately that's life i hope that whatever you choose to do, you do well and are happy in life, i wish you luck|`|ZTY8aotTaa	Just ignore your parents.

KJ8Snqlhaa	to everyone in my opinion, it's her own choice and depends on social environment.  For example, Turkey is a muslim country (%95) and secular one as well. In Turkey, my mother has not covered her head in her entire lifetime like majority of women who live in cities and especially educated. Also Quran (sacred book of muslims) Does Not have certain expressions like women should cover their heads. Male dominated Arabian society caused misunderstandings throughout the centuries. Maybe covering their heads could protect women in barbarian ancient societies (especially in Arabian society before Mohammed -who gave women lots of rights and dignity -  and first, fragile years of Islam) centuries ago but now has no function in modern society that's all.|`|DIj072Sqaa	Their family/relatives, other girls and their husband.|`|FsCQuTsvaa	Depends on what type of Muslim <br>  <br>  Muslim women who follow something like hawwabisim w/e idk how to spell it cant show there face.<br>  <br>  Sunni Muslims just wear a head wrap|`|4NyZDzjqaa	they can show their hair to their husbands
Leda2ha0aa	I think it's usually the thugs that are out walking around after curfew.  They are up to no good.  There was just recently a gang of 50 kids (yes 50) who jumped a poor man on a bike in a "ghetto" neighboring city where I live.  What is the point of doing something like that?  You know it's bad when people who live in the neighborhood are afraid to leave the house unless they see a police car patrolling the area.  Kids with no goals or supervision in their lives.  It's a shame.|`|EmOnt7FIaa	Well, usually Lower Income communities are more densely populated and have a lot of poverty, so this may lead to more crime.|`|EYqTV2EYaa	Because of the pressure and harsh realities of the inner city, many inhabitants give in and feel crime, gangs, and dangerous lifestyles are a necessity. Therefore, again using examples, consider such as Compton, California. There, Bloods, Crips, MS-13s, etc, rule the gang world, and many confused inner city inhabitants feel the need to get involved, believing it’s the ‘right-thing.’ Also, believe it or not, most inner-cities aren't dangerous.|`|qvuQSQvpaa	first. hoods usually in city/urban areas. and white flight took money away from cities. so the struggle of minorities, wen alot migrated to these cities, kept goin since they had no money to begin with. and the cycle goes on since parents n grandparents went thru the same thing and was raised in same condtions. and the school system and its funding is a BIG part of the blame too. and of course all of that leads to poverty and crimes bein committed etc etc|`|d9tCS7BPaa	hahahahaha
94faf4d1d380dfc7f0731bbb8873018eaa	Jesus identified himself as a Jew. The start of Christianity as a religion separate from Judaism really started under St Paul. However Paul was markedly unsuccessful in gaining converts, unlike the Jerusalem church, who by that time was fleeing Jerusalem due to Roman suppression. However St Paul's missionary work began in Antioch with the local gentile community. This can be encapsulated in what is called the Antioch incident, where Peter refused to eat with a Gentile Christian:<br>   Writing later of the incident, Paul recounts: "I opposed [Peter] to his face, because he was clearly in the wrong". Paul reports that he told Peter: "You are a Jew, yet you live like a Gentile and not like a Jew. How is it, then, that you force Gentiles to follow Jewish customs?"[|`|tl2pMkOcaa	Suckers.|`|ojHFFpcBaa	The apostles and disciples.|`|6173ede5e3ea0a8b44522ccd89de7fe0aa	It was the Jews of 2,000 years ago with whom Christ came into contact.|`|jsM8F4bLaa	I believe paperback is incorrect.|`|NCRfZRopaa	Jews.|`|3yNh5jO8aa	Adam & Eve|`|8I9uduIiaa	Jesus himself, and his first small sect of followers, were Jewish.<br>  <br>  But after Jesus died, Mary and the others who accepted the idea that he'd also been 'resurrected' etc, effectively began leaving Judaism.<br>  <br>  Enter Paul. Paul tried to get all the other Jews to also worship Jesus - but naturally they would not, as Judaism forbids the worship of anyone but G-d.<br>  <br>  So Paul then went to preach to the Pagans and Gentiles; the non Jews. And here you find most of the first converts to Christianity.|`|tW86bOMNaa	The Greeks I would have said, to whom Paul went...<br>  <br>  Prior to that, Christianity was merely a particular sect of Judaism. Paul turned that into a fully-fledged religion of its own, distinct from Judaism, and took it to the gentiles - the overwhelming majority of them Greek.|`|PWankIUpaa	Andrew I believe went to Peter (Simon) and I told him as reported in John however in Matthew the two are together when He first met them.I believe they were the first however It could have been James and John.

Yup, God has a Voice and is real. People who debate and are always trying to "solve" the mystery, simply show their ignorance that they never took the time to KNOW God. You believe more in men's knowledge, but little in the fact that you never dared to see for yourself if God is real. Talk. Open your mouth and ask Him yourself what is true or not.

AA11678263	I'm guessing "I creeped your pictures" is a typing error on their part, or else a different word than they meant, or slang (a colloquialism).  "Creeped" is not a word in the English language anyway - it's "crept".<br>  <br>  More likely flicking through channels, or flitting between jobs.  People will know what you mean if you say flip, but it's not really the right word for the context.|`|RXI8ImdIaa	I have never heard "creep" used in that way, I would be confused too.<br>  <br>  You can 'flip' through TV channels, yes. Imagine flipping the pages of a book, that's probably where the phrase came from. (Edit: In the old days, we used to get up and turn the dial to change TV channels - so yes we actually did flip something)<br>  <br>  You could say you are 'flipping' to another job, people would understand you but it wouldn't sound quite right. "Flipping" should be done with something that's concrete, that you can actually turn or rearrange, and a job is sort of an abstract. Sorry that's the closest I can come to rationalizing it, lol.|`|IP2suWFTaa	I flipped threw your pictures and liked them. I am jumping from one job to another, since I don't have a steady one.

Pakistan had always been an impoverished nation, it has survived  only because of generous hand outs from the US since its creation because it was a key ally against the soviet union and later against the taliban. Otherwise pakistan has nothing to be proud of.|`|lh2H5oSOaa	Pakistan is a living miracle. It came into being despite stiff resistance from Hindu majority of India, which was far more numerous and affluent. Indian leader Gandhi had said: "Over my dead body".  The  British also wanted  to keep India intact, in order to use her as an adversery to China. But Pakistan came into being despite heavy odds. Then India tried to cripple Pakistan, by making Muslim minority flee to Pakistan, by massacring them. The largest exodus known to human history came into being. But Pakistan was able to accommodate and feed more than 2 Million refugees and did not face financial crunch.<br>  <br>  India then devalued her rupee and asked Pakistan to follow suit. But Pakistan refused and India stopped supplying essential goods. All industries were located in India and Pakistan was devoid of any manufacturing facilities. But Pakistan accepted the challenge and started making her own goods. Today Pakistan makes electronic devices to cars. He defence industry is self sufficient in producing Tanks, armourded cars and latest missiles. Our missiles can reach Assam at one side and Israel on the other. The atomic technology achieved by Pakistan, despite obstacles from USA and Europe and united Indo-Israeli attempts to destroy it.<br>  <br>  Pakistan is a nation of young and talented people. Recently Pakistani students of  A level beat rest of the world at Cambridge University in  writing, speaking competition. A Pakistani student secured A+ in 23 papers of A level and earned a mention in Guinneas Book. Pakistan is a resourceful country with all sorts of minerals and water resources. We have the largest canal irrigated system in the world and we produced best of rice, wheat, almonds, pistachios, oranges, mangoes and fish, prawns in the world. <br>  <br>  Indeed Pakistan is having a temporary problem, because of mindlessly  taking the dictates of USA. Pakistan should not have involved herself in the so called war of terror in Afghanistan which created problems in her own Tribal belt and NWFP province. Their only fault is that they cannot derive out those brothers who came from Africa and Asia to fight side by side with them against Soviet invasion.  America has an eye on Balochstan to safeguard her interests in afghanistan and hrass Iran and encircle China. It is not in the national interests of Pakistan to  ignore the interest of Iran and China, our next door neighbors. <br>  <br>  American propaganda ploys like failed state, and deomcractic rule and rights of females etc have no impact on Pakistan. 97% of our population is firm believer in Islam and are confident that Pakistan has Divine Blessings. No power on earth can harm Pakistan. Earlier her opponents understand this fact, the better.<br>  <br>                                                        Muhammad Javed Iqbal|`|aPuUuWlLaa	Pakistan doesn't look too blessed to me lately.

Yet his life is filled with lustfulness (12 marriages and sex with a child, slaves and concubines), rapes, warfare, conquests, and unmerciful butcheries.  The infinitely good, just and all holy God simply cannot tolerate anything in the least unjust or sinful.  What Muhammad produced in the Qur'an is simply a book of gibberish consisting of later evil verses abrogating (superseding) earlier peaceful verses. These verses in Arabic poetically "tickle" the ears of Arab listeners.   Islam is a caustic blend of paganism and twisted Bible stories. Muhammad, its lone "prophet", who made no prophecies, conceived his religion to satiate his lust for power, sex, and money. He was a terrorist. And if you think these conclusions are shocking, wait until you see the evidence mostly from Islamic historians .  <br>  If anyone truly reads the badly written Qur'an, while comparing it side-by-side with what Islamic historians back to 750 A.D. have written about Muhammad they will have to conclude that Muhammad was a conman and, "Allah" was Muhammad's alter ego.  Inventing "Allah" allowed Muhammad to wield control over everyone's life by telling him or her he is a representative of God, and what he says is what God has ordained. The Qur'an is filled with so many errors -  making it extremely hard to believe that this creator of our awesome universe could be so stupid as to author such a thing. It could have only come from a sick, demented mind.  One "hell bent" on dominating all those people around him.
PvPPivLJaa	Everybody's emo at some point or another.

The word emo doesn't exist anymore. Emo used to stand for emotional and was aimed toward kids who felt like outcast so they dressed differently and separated themselves from the "popular kids". Not being accepted in high school can lead to depression, so many emotional kids would cut themselves. You are not emo unless you have emotional problems or depression. Wearing skinny jeans or black cloths makes you a scenester or a follower because you were not the one who decided that skinny jeans are cool. A scenester is someone who just follows the trend, whatever style is popular, thats what they wear. You are a scenester because you like the style that emo people created.|`|QdwMhvpCaa	You are who you are. You don't have to be emo to dress like one.|`|9VkET9jNaa	so what are you asking?
rv2Iy1Y7aa	Following is my response to your same question of four days ago.  As difficult as this passage is, my response is offered because no one else seems to want to try to help you.  ... <br>  <br>  I will attempt to assist ... notice I say "attempt". <br>  <br>  "Life as a string, at the mouth of the cave, <br>  She will measure the width and height when the cave spits<br>  Death comes with filthy shears and plans" could be rendered in Latin as:<br>  <br>  "Vita sicut filum, in porta speluncae,<br>  *** spelunca spuit, latitudinem et altitudinem metietur.<br>  Mors c um forfice foeda et consiliis sordidis pervenit.".<br>  <br>  This is structurally sound and accurate; but it also is difficult to understand your real meaning because the first line seems very incomplete. This makes it more difficult for me as the translator and as such may not be exactly what you want. <br>  <br>  Though you are attempting poetry in English and you want it to be as it would have been in Latin, this Latin translation (even to me as the translator) seems rather inadequate. I would genuinely need to know what "poetic meaning" is actually intended. As I have translated your request into accurate Latin, I cannot be certain it serves your intention.<br>  <br>  Note 1:The asterisks represent "c um" without the space. It means "when" in this context.<br>  <br>  Note 2: "c um" is a complete word (omit the space) and it means "with" in this context.<br>  <br>  Note 3: If you are wondering how or why the first two notes represent two different things even though they refer to words spelled exactly the same, you are very perceptive; but it is too complicated to explain here. You would have to study Latin for some time to really understand. <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  Vale et Prospera

216d90e6aa749da6fe51585ee054ef87aa	Listen when a crewmember is giving instructions, especially during the muster drill. If you listen you don't have to ask questions later. <br>  <br>  The unexpected may occur on your cruise, such as rainy weather, a storm or ship mechanical failure. The crew can't control the weather, so there's not much use complaining to them about it. If you're in the Caribbean, which is normally calm, you should be aware that hurricane season is six months a year, June through November, and it's possible you may be affected. Gale-force winds may cause the captain to change course and head to a different port than the one on your itinerary. Relax, and go with the flow. <br>  <br>  If you experience rough water just hope you have a strong stomach. Mechanical problems aren't common, but they may occur. They could cause the captain to reduce speed or to find a closer port. <br>  <br>  You may be cruising a part of the world experiencing civil unrest. If there is a sudden uprising at a particular port it makes sense for the captain to avoid it and pick a safer spot for you to go ashore. <br>  <br>  Whatever happens on your cruise, keep smiling and maintain your sense of humor. Remember to be considerate to others and to exhibit common courtesy at all times. You're on vacation! Enjoy it!

9dd2ac44728dd565acf459d4a4e730d0aa	There is always a demand for good medical translators. I think that you've hit the nail on the head by mentioning the possibility of becoming a doctor, as it is necessary to obtain some familiarity with the area in which you propose to specialise. Some people do this by taking a postgraduate qualification in which they make a special study of medical terminology. After that, it's a chicken and egg situation and you have to persuade people that you are competent and experienced in this field. Once you get going, of course, you can point to your experience to date and you might even put up your fees.<br>  <br>  Perhaps you would like to look at this for some hints as to how people got started. <a href="http://www.translationdirectory.com/jobs.htm#01" rel="nofollow">http://www.translationdirectory.com/jobs...</a>|`|RXI8ImdIaa	This is a guess:<br>  <br>  I would guess that it's only a high demand position in areas where there are many people speaking 2 or more different languages. So maybe like Miami, southern California, and Texas in the U.S.<br>  <br>  In Europe there might be more opportunity, there are more languages in a smaller space. In Europe the patients are more likely to have a functional grasp of those languages themselves though.<br>  <br>  In the northwest Ohio hospitals, they use a phone service for translation. The doctor and the patient get on a three-way call with the translator. This service has translators for just about any language you could imagine.<br>  <br>  I bet it's a LOT more cost-effective to subscribe to that phone service than it is to have people on-staff at the hospital to cover any language that it likely to come up. Perhaps you should widen your focus to translation in general, not just medical translation.<br>  <br>  Just a thought.|`|V5akMpDAaa	i'm with what she said ^<br>  but they do pay a lot for translators in high schools in Alabama, if that interests you at all.

All they did was substitute Jesus instead of the Sun as the messiah, ie as per the Celtic Cross. And that is provable. Celtic traditions pre date Christianity by some considerable time. ie tens of thousands of years. <br>  <br>  The early Christians could not convert the Celts so they plagiarized the Celtic festivals and took them as their own. That is why we have Christmas on the 25th dec. Because the sun having died in the winter after dropping below the horizon, is by the 25th dec now just above the horizon again, signifying the birth of the new sun.<br>  <br>  The same with Easter, the sun is in the middle of the Cross constellation, signifying the Resurrection of life, as it tends to do in the spring. ie the Celtic Cross. :)<br>  <br>  Practicing Shaman... quantum physics rocks.|`|tl2pMkOcaa	Christians claim over and over that the Christ Myth is an old argument that has been disproven.<br>  <br>  ...and THAT'S THEIR ARGUMENT!<br>  <br>  When in reality, the Christ Myth is being accepted by more and more scholars as authentic.<br>  <br>  What would you think if there were uncanny similarities between your religion and more ancient ones?

Accordingly his days shall amount to a hundred and twenty years.” 4?The Neph′i?lim proved to be in the earth in those days, and also after that, when the sons of the [true] God continued to have relations with the daughters of men and they bore sons to them, they were the mighty ones who were of old, the men of fame.<br>  <br>  These Nephilim or giants were hybrids half human half demon.

And so it goes.<br>  <br>  edit:<br>  Gina: <br>  Sorry, but none of the 'myths' were taken from the Bible...they existed long before the bible books were ever written.  The Eden Myth and the Noah's ark Myth were both taken from the Babylonian creation epics...and the creation of man from dirt, mud, clay, dust....existed in every religion that preceeded Judaism or Christianity...with the Summerian first humans being created out of mud by a Goddess, Ashera...and the first Egyptian humans being created, from clay,  by the god Khnum on a Potters wheel.

The labels that we put on sexuality can be very useful to people to help them identify with a group or put a name on what they are feeling. For me though it took a long time to reach a position where i realised that attraction and love can occur in different places and are often so different that the few boxes they are put in can't cover them all. No one can tell you what you feel, but becoming comfortable with yourself no matter how you identify is the most important first step. Experimenting may help, but stay safe.|`|PmJdmMduaa	it's normal for girls to feel like experimenting on different things when it comes to sexuality. i think that you just need to take the time to really think if you really are lesbian or not. it's not a wrong thing to be. be proud of who you are and i guess if it comes down to it, there are girls just like you around your age thinking the same thing you are. just keep your options open (;|`|AA10662866	Wouldnt say for definite you were lesbian. as you said just curious, same with males.

V5akMpDAaa	彼女が持つ / がある|`|10bb153a928c9693ebec1b2660853526aa	私の (watashi no) is "my," actually. 私 (watashi) means "I" or "me," and the の (no) particle serves as a connector particle to whatever you're talking about, making "I" or "me" into "my." You can say "your" by doing the same thing. あなた (anata) means "you," but あなたの (anata no) means "your."<br>  <br>  持つ (motsu) is "to have." So if you want to say "I have a book," then you say: 私は本を持ちます (watashi wa hon o mochimasu), or sometimes they even shorten it to 本を持ちます (hon o mochimasu). The ます (masu) ending is added to make it present tense and polite, but it doesn't have anything to do with the subject ("I," "you," "she," "they," etc). Japanese verbs are not conjugated according to subject, so even if you wrote them all out, you get:<br>  <br>  I have: 持ちます (mochimasu)<br>  You have: 持ちます (mochimasu)<br>  She has: 持ちます (mochimasu)<br>  He has: 持ちます (mochimasu)<br>  We have: 持ちます (mochimasu)<br>  They have: 持ちます (mochimasu)<br>  <br>  Verbs are only changed to reflect how polite you'd like to be, as well as the time ("had," "having," "will have," etc). Subject is indicated by putting the particle は (wa) or が (ga) right after it, to mark it as the subject. So in the sentence 私は本を持ちます (watashi wa hon o mochimasu):<br>  <br>  私 (watashi) = I, me<br>  は (wa) = subject particle<br>  本 (hon) = book<br>  を (o) = object particle<br>  持ちます (mochimasu) = polite, present tense of "have"<br>  <br>  I'm only a beginner with my Japanese, so anyone's welcome to correct me if I've explained things incorrectly.|`|9IrdMFX7aa	"he/she has" means "～san ni wa nanika ga aru. / ～san ni wa dareka ga iru."<br>  (Please insert the name of the person instead of ～. There is no word for he or she in Japanese like there is in English. You have to use the name and add -san or -kun or -chan, etc. <br>  <br>  "He/She has X brothers" means  "～san niwa kyoudai ga X nin imasu." <br>  <br>  P.S: "Watashi wa hon wo mochimasu" means "I will hold a book." It is a typical beginner's mistake.<br>  <br>  (I did not give you a thumb-down by the way, Kelly).|`|WPratgUYaa	Ok. Watashi no / わたしの / 私の does not mean "I have" - it is the possessive of "I", yes, that's correct but that makes it "my". So "watashi no hon" / わたしのほん / 私の本 is "my book".<br>  If you want to say, I have a book, there are two ways to say this:<br>  1) "Watashi wa, hon o motte imasu" / わたしは、ほんをもっています / 私は、本を持っています literally meaning "I am holding a book" but it does mean "to have".<br>  2) "Hon ga arimasu" / ほんがあります / 本があります literally "There is a book".<br>  It depends on which situation you wish to use this.<br>  <br>  As for he/she, in Japanese, one normally uses the name of the person they are talking about. So if you are talking abou Mari, you would say:<br>  Marisan wa hon o motte imasu. / まりさんはほんをもっています / まりさんは本を持っています<br>  <br>  If you want to know the possessive of he/she, you add no to the words:<br>  Kare no / かれの / 彼の - his eg. Kare no terebi... / かれのテレビ / 彼のテレビ(his TV)<br>  Kanojo no / かのじょの / 彼女の - her eg. Kanojo no kami ... / かのじょのかみ / 彼女の髪 (her hair)<br>  But again, you would most probably use their name - Marisan no... / マリさんの Takahirosan no... / たかひろさんの<br>  <br>  To say "He/she has", it would be:<br>  Kare wa ... o motte imasu. / かれは...をもっています / 彼は...を持っています<br>  Kanojo wa ... o motte imasu. / かのじょは...をもっています / 彼女は...を持っています|`|hUhxjEWaaa	何かを持っています (nani ka o motte imasu)　is a way to say I have something, like a physical object, but a better way is 誰かには何かがある/居る (dare ka ni wa nani ka ga aru/iru)　、this is the only way you can say something like 自分には兄弟が居る (jibun ni wa kyoudai ga iru)-I have siblings.

XN0cYCATaa	For what reason or reasons should God have not created the devil even if he was going to fall? Just because God knows what will happen doesn't mean that the person (angel) isn't free to make choices.  Satan freely chose to rebel against God.  God knew this would happen.  Nevertheless, let me offer some possible reasons why God would create Satan even though He knew he would fall and rebel.<br>  <br>  It was necessary to have the fall so that God could then have a reason to die for our sins thereby demonstrating that God can and does provide the greatest act of love which is to lay ones life down for his friend (John 15:13). <br>  The fall of Satan provides yet another method for God to be glorified in that God can use sin to prove that sin is "bad" and that God's word about righteousness is true. <br>  If God is to have creatures with free will, then the risk of rebellion is part of that freedom.  Satan had that freedom and used it to rebel. <br>  If God had not created Satan and instead another angel fell, then we'd be asking why God made that angel knowing he would fall. <br>  God has reasons that we simply do not know about. <br>  I know my children will act badly at times, but knowing that does not mean mean that I shouldn't have kids.  Part of the risk of freedom is that rebellion will be a reality.|`|Xg1ZR4ptaa	you want to follow in Satan's footsteps go ahead, but let me warn you of the things that will come that will happen after your death.

Everyone would be saved, all would be compelled to do what he said.<br>  Compelled. The catch was that he would rule completely, even above God.  It ended up that in the spirit world 1/3 of Fathers children thought that that was a better plan than Gods and rebelled from him.  A war commenced in which the Son on the Morning was banned from moving to the second estate (Earth).  Meaning they would not progress, receive no bodies as you have and they found themselves to be indeed sore losers, hate filled and miserable.  They decided that they would make this experience as bad for us here as it is for them.  Now they provide the opposition to Gods plan.  Good evil; virtue vice, light dark; pleasure  pain.  They temp us relentlessly.  They want to have a body, hence in Christ time particularly, possession.<br>  <br>  So they did use their free will and now suffer the consequences.<br>  <br>  So yes, if you want what God has to offer, you do it his way, but if you do not, you have choice not to.

An angel created from fire. In my belief, gave man fire for the first time. Supplied us with warmth, light and a way to cook our food. "He" has been known as the "morning star"... and when in comprehension...The morning star rises in the morning and sets in the evening... Our Sun is a star, and is a huge fireball. I cannot prove this, it is merely a thought. The universe is called "uni-verse" for a reason... One body, many parts. <br>  <br>  I do not consider "Him" the same as Satan. They are different entities.<br>  <br>  In my thought, Lucifer came to earth to supply mankind with fire as a choice, not because of "naughtiness". <br>  <br>  If you consider flame, for me it has many analogies of a greater God Force Energy. <br>  <br>  When used carefully, is a source of warmth, romance (candlelit is very romantic), light and a way to cook our food. Some types of seeds need the heat of fire in order to germinate... and spontaeous fires clear overpacked underbrush, allowing room for more plants to grow. <br>  <br>  When in careless hands, can become destructive.<br>  <br>  The way such energy is utilized determines it's course. <br>  <br>  The colors displayed in fire: blue, orange, yellow : <br>  <br>  Blue - truth and creativity<br>  Orange - inner child<br>  yellow - survival<br>  <br>  My theory unproven: Flame may bring forth angelic essences that would coincide with the reason you might be utilizing fire, as in a candle.. <br>  <br>  For celebration - birthday candles - might bring happy spirits. <br>  <br>  If you light a candle for a loved one, may bring spirits that bring forth prayer carriers. <br>  <br>  If you light a candle for healing, may bring forth healing spirits.<br>  <br>  A candlelit dinner may bring forth spirits of romance. <br>  <br>  I do believe the intentions in your heart matter. <br>  <br>  This is not "magiK" to me, I believe "He" is an angel that chose to supply us with caring ...

They either lacked faith in our Heavenly Father, in the Savior, or in the gospel plan, or they lacked faith in their own ability or willingness to keep the law that would be given to them. Thus, they actively opposed the plan of our Heavenly Father. Their leader was called Lucifer, “the son of the morning”; he is also known as the devil or Satan.<br>  <br>  Lucifer not only opposed the plan of our Heavenly Father, but he sought to amend and change the terms of salvation by denying men their free agency and by preempting our Heavenly Father. The exact words of Lucifer’s boast are contained in the book of Moses: “I will redeem all mankind, that one soul shall not be lost, and surely I will do it; wherefore give me thine honor.” (Moses 4:1.)<br>  <br>  We do not know all of the details of Lucifer’s amended proposal, but we do know from revelation that he “sought to destroy the agency of man.” (Moses 4:3.) This could be accomplished in many ways, including denying us either the opportunity of choice or the freedom of choice. In either case, not “one soul” would have been lost. It is sin that causes a soul to be lost, but how can a person sin if he does not have the opportunity to sin? That is, how can a person disobey a law if he does not have a law?<br>  <br>  Lucifer’s proposed amendment appealed to some, but it did not appeal to any of us in this audience. We saw that under his plan we would lose the challenge of growth and progression. We did not want to live in a world where we would be on the same plane forever. We had enough faith in our Heavenly Father and in his plan, in Jesus Christ, and in ourselves that we wanted to live in a world where there would be opportunities for further development. At the same time I am sure we realized that if we were not faithful to these laws and opportunities we might even be worse off than we had been before.<br>  <br>  Thus there was a great war in heaven, and a key issue in that war was whether or not man was to be a morally free agent while upon the earth. A vote was taken. (By the way, that in itself indicates that we had our free agency there; in a sense Lucifer exercised his free agency in an attempt to deny us the right to exercise our free agency.) Two-thirds of those present voted for the plan of our Heavenly Father; one-third voted against the plan and did not participate in it.<br>  <br>  From an article entitled:<br>  Moral Free Agency<br>  by:<br>  Daniel H.

AA10451488	Receipt printers often have only one format for restaurants. They will almost certainly have a "tip" line. Even my local Subway has this on their debit receipts. <br>  <br>  For small shops like this I usually look to see if there is a tip jar on the counter. This indicates to me that the owner/manager allows employees to receive gratuity. If the service is very good, then I will leave a dollar or two, but the 15% rule does not apply in this situation.

If they don't, the employer is required to make up the difference himself.  Every employee makes at least minimum wage that way.<br>  <br>  People have their grubby hands out all over the place asking for gratuities just for doing their job, and tip jars on every counter make me want to vomit.  Sandwich shop employees are paid at least the standard minimum wage or more.

Those employees do not depend up on tips to complete their wages (thankfully) and you may tip only if you wish. <br>  <br>  But please do tip at restaurants and salons. If you have a problem with the service, don't take it out of the tip, take it up with the manager as a complaint.

But tipping a cashier is not compulsory.<br>  <br>  A server makes less than minimum wage because tips are supposed to make up the difference.  A server (by that I mean a waiter or a waitress) depends on tips and they should be tipped if they do their job well.  Since a server depends on tips to live they should give you extra special attention to make sure your dining experience is as good as it possibly can be.<br>  <br>  The fact that there was tip space in the receipt should not concern you.  It was probably put there by the processor because it is food establishment.  Cashiers make minimum wage and should not be depending on tips to get by as a server does.
zt3xu4a8aa	Interesting question. I think your question begs another one: <br>  CAN men determine what is divinely inspired? Being mere humans, one has to wonder. Is the Catholic bible more divinely inspired than a Protestant one? (The Catholic bible contains the Apocrypha, which to my knowledge is not included in bibles used by most Protestant religions). And, are we only talking about the Bible? What about the teachings of the Buddha, or the Koran? Some religions go so far as to claim the Declaration of Independence was divinely inspired. <br>  <br>  It is my OPINION that writings become accepted if they are agreed on by significantly large groups of people over a long enough time. In the cases of the books of the New Testament and the Koran, there were no formal written documents gathered until centuries after the authors' deaths. VERY FEW people in those times were literate, and many verses were memorized and passed down in verbal form from one generation to another. Existing written documents were subject to many changes, either from the writer's personal editing, or because of mistakes. Scribes during those times were not necessarily literate, and simply copied characters rather than understanding their meaning.<br>  <br>  Even now, people disagree on the meaning and the literal translation of biblical scripture. How many versions of bibles exist in the present day? I once witnessed a heated argument at work between a Catholic doctor and a Jehovah's Witness receptionist. Each of them whipped out their scriptures to show the other proof of what they were saying. The compared translations were not even closely related! It was like they were speaking different languages!<br>  <br>  I think each person has to decide what words ring true for them.

Two of which the best known councils are the councils of Hippo and Council of Carthage.  Though these councils,  Bishops of the Early Christian communities debated and decided what was "divinely inspired" and what which was not. <br>  <br>  I simply adhere to what they decided on.  Figuring that they were CLOSER to the source back in the early first centuries AD,  then I am NOW.  They knew Greek and Hebrew,  and I don't. They had more documents, which have not survived to modern times, which would have been written by the very 1st century Christians, many of which would have PERSONALLY known the Apostles which, themselves, lived to around 60-70AD. <br>  <br>  I know that one of their MAIN criteria was the time of when the scripture was written and how WELL they could verify it was written by who claimed to have written it. <br>  <br>  For example,  not all the books were directly written by the apostles, but instead, by "close" followers of them...people who followed them, learned from them, recorded what THEY said. <br>  However,  SOME books which some people trusted to be based on the apostles,  couldn't be realiably VERIFIED, therefore they were suspicious. <br>  <br>  Other books were rejected because they were written too late to be considered accurate teachings of the Apostles.  One example is the ProtoEvangeluism of James,  I believe it is suppose to be a gospel by James,  BUT was written around 200AD,  too late to be considered authenticate,... so it was rejected. <br>  <br>  Since the Catholic church OFFICIALLY closed off the canon of the bible in 397AD, I don't think there can be any other Authenticate Divinely Inspired scriptures which come AFTER that. <br>  <br>  The bible is the GREATEST gift that the Catholic church gave to the WORLD. and Why I believe the church alone has the authority to settle matters of faith and settle interpretational differences.  Because it is the Catholic church which has the historical link back to the original 1st Century Christians, what they were taught by the apostles AND was the one to decide what went into the bible.  IF they decided what went into it,  then they MUST have at least SOME authority to settle conflicts on what it means. -- That's the ONLY way I can see it. <br>  <br>  And that is why nothing in the bible can contradict Catholic teaching, when the bbible is PROPERLY interpreted. <br>  <br>  Without a central authority,  as you stated, there CAN be no right or wrong answer,  ONLY matters of opinion.  At most, without someone or something to settle things,  at MOST all we can have is a TIE.  Your personal and fallible opinion against mine. - No WAY of knowing if your right or if I am.  That is why Christianity after the Reformation has splinted into 38,000 different denominations, while the Catholic church has stayed largely 1 body.<br>  ______________________________

Torture is not.<br>  <br>  2:  You believe this only because your book says this is so...despite multiple cases of poor judgment by your pet deity in your own book.<br>  <br>  3:  So "might makes right", and "who are you to question my god"? <br>  <br>  So yes...I do know better than your god does.

Even if their mother or sister started the fight with another man, hitting them, and they guy hit them back claiming it's self defense, they would be upset.  Women get prosecuted for domestic violence, aggravated assault as well, but some men just have big egos, because if they report a woman hitting them, their friends or colleagues call him a wuss, no it's restraining from hurting some one weaker than you no matter how strong she is. Many cases where a woman fights a man, she gives up because she's not strong enough to fight.<br>  <br>  <br>  David - So you can hit some one elses daughter, or mother and not care that their families would be upset, or it's self defense in your case, but if it's women of your family, you don't condone men hitting them in "self defense".

That's all|`|i0J7K5Txaa	Would the question be for a survey, curious, or personal?<br>  <br>  I've seen my step father hit my mother when I was younger, it made me never want to be a person like that.<br>  <br>  I can see how it could affect some one at a young age to the point that they think it's okay to do it, don't realize they're doing it, or have the urge to want to do it.  That being said, it is not always they're fault if they do it when they're older... But they should not have sympathy for what happened as a child, they should seek help and strive to better they're selves.  We wouldn't get any where if people were just pat on the head, blamed they're parents, and went on back to doing it.<br>  <br>  A lot probably has to do with the mothers affection towards the child, if the mother cares and loves the boy then it's possible he won't hit a woman in his life after seeing it.  If the mother is just as spiteful to the child as the father is to the mother then chances are he won't be right.<br>  <br>  Some people suggest "Well if the mother didn't leave the father it's her fault he is this way." To that I have to say: If a man is willing to hit a woman what makes you think he wouldn't take it to another level of abuse or violence if she tried to leave him.<br>  <br>  This is a tough subject, everyone will have a different veiw of it, and I will probably get hate mail for it...<br>  <br>  I hope it helps though, it's not to often I share my point of veiw on a topic like this.|`|npTZTzWRaa	i condone self defense<br>  <br>  @ Faith- I think the guys who say it's fine to hit a woman in self defense would see otherwise if their mothers or sisters were the ones in the situation.

How wil we know these false Christs. Do they teach what Jesus and the Apostles taught. We are given scripture as a measuring stick to know truth. Paul said in passage if he or an angel from heaven preached any gospel other than the one he had taught let them be accursed. So evidently he took the message he preached to be very serious. Jesus also said if you continue in my word then you will be my disciples (disciplined ones) and you will know the truth and the truth will set you free.

I personally react more with emotion first and then logic. In the heat and pressure of being attacked it is on occasion very terribly hard for me to rise above that. However I am responsible for my actions,words, and deeds.  It is better to set an example of goodness than react to bad with bad I agree. This brother makes a valid point on how and why to do it.  But then most of us are given the sense to know when we react and why and how. This is always up to the individual to follow through with it. It sometimes much easier to tell someone how one should or should not behave. In all cases I would love to live up to those ideals and at best can try.

EmV1Kojyaa	My real dad. I never knew him for most of my life. When I was young, he and I watched hockey every Saturday night and he taught me to play poker and blackjack. He left for good when I was only 7 yrs old. I was devastated. 20 yrs later, my sister and I were reunited with him (way too long of a story) and I was so happy because I was positive I'd never see him again all those years ago. Only one year after we were reunited, at the age of 56, my dad died mysteriously. To this day, my sister and I don't know exactly what caused his death, because the hospital either didn't know or wouldn't tell us. It was the most heartbreaking event of my life. I was asked to give the eulogy at his funeral, and it took everything ounce of courage I had not to have a mental breakdown. I cried for days afterwards.<br>  <br>  If I had a chance to, I'd pick up my dad at his place, take him out to his favourite restaurant for "fish and chips", take him to the casino (he liked cards) then drive him home, cook his favourite Hungarian dishes for him, and stay real late - watch hockey or make jokes or watch hockey AND make jokes (we had an identical sense of humour). Man, what a day that would be.... I sure miss my dad. Can't wait to see him again.|`|FsCQuTsvaa	I very famous guy i love his music and his rap songs he dont rap about drugs money or cars.

WMJwIRGxaa	This does not, however, lead to the belief that Catholic popes speak Ex Cathedra.<br>  <br>  The Bible is the God-breathed Word.  It is, by its nature, infallible.  Paul spoke no more, or less, infallibly than any author used by God to record Scripture.|`|WalnRzfGaa	Paul was a liar.|`|3yNh5jO8aa	no. Ex Cathedra is catholic. that has nothing to do with the Bible.|`|jard50Yiaa	In Catholic theology, the Latin phrase ex cathedra, literally meaning "from the chair", refers to a teaching by the pope that is considered to be made with the intention of invoking infallibility.<br>  <br>  The "chair" referred to is not a literal chair, but refers metaphorically to the pope's position, or office, as the official teacher of Catholic doctrine: the chair was the symbol of the teacher in the ancient world, and bishops to this day have a cathedra, a seat or throne, as a symbol of their teaching and governing authority. The pope is said to occupy the "chair of Peter", as Catholics hold that among the apostles Peter had a special role as the preserver of unity, so the pope as successor of Peter holds the role of spokesman for the whole church among the bishops, the successors as a group of the apostles.|`|z74a7wvlaa	Judah,<br>  Peter and Paul are the founders of the Roman Church. It is very clear in the bible and as willed by his Father, Jesus appointed Peter His CEO. Paul was an apostle of the gentile and that's what he is: he preached thru out middle east and neighboring places, as exactly what the bible said. Could you imagine if both of them are 2 CEO; that must be a riot.|`|db7df25ea31227e5641d5c32d43c3bcdaa	no<br>  <br>  we are speaking with what the holy spirit tells us<br>  <br>  we are just agreeing with what paul says.<br>  <br>  <br>  Yes Paul spoke what the holy spirit was telling him to say.<br>  except where Paul says this is his own wisdom.|`|hvNqywbBaa	Ex Cathedra, literally "from the chair", a theological term which signifies authoritative teaching and is more particularly applied to the definitions given by the Roman pontiff. Originally the name of the seat occupied by a professor or a bishop, cathedra was used later on to denote the magisterium, or teaching authority. The phrase ex cathedra occurs in the writings of the medieval theologians, and more frequently in the discussions which arose after the Reformation in regard to the papal prerogatives.<br>  <br>  "We teach and define that it is a dogma Divinely revealed that the Roman pontiff when he speaks ex cathedra, that is when in discharge of the office of pastor and doctor of all Christians, by virtue of his supreme Apostolic authority, he defines a doctrine regarding faith or morals to be held by the universal Church, by the Divine assistance promised to him in Blessed Peter, is possessed of that infallibility with which the Divine Redeemer willed that his Church should be endowed in defining doctrine regarding faith or morals, and that therefore such definitions of the Roman pontiff are of themselves and not from the consent of the Church irreformable."|`|IH5wlEtzaa	oh my gosh u are impossible; Only God is perfect.|`|OeAfpIZAaa	Ex Cathedra is only for the Pope as far as I understand it.<br>  <br>  Edit: What is your source?
zPfgFXU5aa	When Jesus said "I will give you the keys of the kingdom of heaven, and whatever you bind on earth shall be bound in heaven, and whatever you loose on earth shall be loosed in heaven." (Matthew 16:19) Who was the "you"  who got the keys?<br>  <br>  Was Jesus talking to Peter alone, or was He answering a question, that Peter asked, and giving the keys to Peter and to all of the others who were standing there with Peter? <br>  <br>  The answer is found in the very next verse:<br>  <br>  <br>  "Then He strictly charged the disciples to tell no one that He was the Christ". It seems that the "you" was all of them, the entire group, they all received the keys. The power to "bind & loose" in Matt 18:18 is the same thing as the Keys in Matt 16, and thus the Keys are shared equally by all the Apostles.<br>  <br>  <br>  If it was just Peter do we see anywhere any indication the other Apostles acknowledge the supremacy of Peter?<br>  <br>   Did they think of Peter as "infallible concerning church doctrine"?<br>  <br>   In Acts 15, Barnabas, Peter and Paul gave reports at the council in Jerusalem but it was James who rendered the decision - NOT PETER! <br>  <br>  If Peter were the leader, he most definitely have rendered the final decision!<br>  <br>  In Acts 8:14 Peter was sent by others to Samaria. Why didn't Peter do the sending if he was the pope? <br>  <br>  In Gal.2:8-10 Paul says "And when they had known the grace that was given to me, James and Cephas [Peter] and John, who SEEMED TO BE PILLARS...."     shouldn’t have Paul named Peter first since he is the supposed pope?<br>  <br>  In Galatians 2:11-16 Paul rebukes Peter. If Peter was the Pope shouldn't he be infallible? And who would dare rebuke him apart from someone who was either an equal in rank or superior in rank?|`|xrtraIMGaa	No, he gave the keys to Peter, he forgave him(John21:15-17)he questioned him three times cause he denied him three times.  : )|`|0k8ZPfx2aa	When did Jesus publicly say those things? If you are going to follow Paul, at least don't call yourself a Christian. Paul's doctrines were the opposite of Jesus' public sermons like the Beatitudes et al.|`|z74a7wvlaa	Absolutely NOT. Otherwise you are accussing Jesus of lying or double talk.|`|SSave0Rvaa	You are absolutely right! He did all that!|`|a7fd823ff38cea82d01dbcb747972460aa	No---like you guys say ad nauseam, "it's not in Scripture"|`|37LKDbtsaa	What is it with your Paul-worship?<br>  <br>  Edit: 99% of your questions are about Paul. If that's not worship, then it's an obsession.|`|f7fcb6877caa0ad4f41dd9af2258ee0aaa	Nope. Simon Peter alone was the only man ever given the keys to the kingdom, the universal symbol of supreme authority. He and his direct successors have exercised that authority over Christ's Churchy ever since, resulting in 2,000 years of unity in belief, unity in teaching and unity in worship throughout the world.  You cannot have truth without unity and you cannot have unity without genuine authority.|`|3PuKXEwZaa	No, that did not happen. It sounds more that you would have liked that to have happened.  It really sounds like you are making stuff up to be honest.  You can't even support this idea with sola scriptura.  If Peter did something wrong the most you could say about him was that he sinned, which all men do.  Nobody could have expected Peter to be perfect.  This in no way would have negated Jesus giving Peter authority of the other apostles.|`|URO3gDXcaa	there are no keys.  there is no heaven.|`|3yNh5jO8aa	no
AA10958010	It does seem odd that a kindly God would invent Purgatory and Hell. In my opinion no amount of free-will arguments can justify throwing a person in eternal torment for not devoting himself to God. That's bullying on a cosmc scale, plain and simple.|`|59cc8fb800dd782a47ca30d7177bf849aa	Intresting view. Never heard that one before. Umm..ok|`|5d68f40b8859bffc70967002fb5393feaa	It's an allegory. God also likens Himself to a shepard, a potter, a silversmith, a judge, and even a thief in the night etc. Why does God use so many? Could it big that He is far too big to be perfectly summed up in just one of them. He is also likened to a Father, I feel that one describes Him best, but that's just my opinion. <br>  <br>  However, if I were you I wouldn't get caught up in the little things. There are far greater issues the Bible addresses that you should be worrying about. I like the way Mark Twain put it, "Most people are bothered by those passages of Scripture they do not understand, but the passages that bother me are those I do understand."|`|AA11989557	There is no such thing as limbo..

Jesus annoints the feet (ruled by Pisces), walks on water (Piscean element), is martyred; is the ruler of fish (Pisceans) and, maybe most interestingly, has symbolized the religion that ruled over the 2000+year "Piscean age" -- finally coming to an end, around this decade, at the age of Aquarius. I'm not certain, but it may also be that his actual birthday fell within the sign of Pisces, when a star much like the morning star shone over that region.|`|b004db63c6a020bbe8c0e5da9b05ddfcaa	The first part of your name sounds accurate, the second extremely doubtful|`|b8ef75612414ea7d5a7c0212749b56a1aa	No God  is  a man that died  on the  cross for our sins and  gave us life  eternally if we  ask for  God in our hearts.He is a man that made  miracles,He  is  te  man that made the world  and  everything in it he  made  U me  and  everyone  In the world  he  Is Alpha and The  OMega.

xieiM0FRaa	I don't know anything about that, but I don't stereotype Islam as 'violent'. Some people just do not understand the beliefs of others. I know nothing of that religion, so I'm not going to say it's violent and that all Muslims are terrorists.<br>  <br>  Many people assume so because of stereotyping. Unfortunately, there are people who stereotype everything. Like all Muslims must be terrorists, all gays must have AIDs, all blondes must be stupid. It's hurtful and judgmental and it should stop, but yet it thrives...|`|FmbwIbtzaa	I doubt your claims and I conclude that when given the locations of the spread of Islam, the third world, the undeveloped countries, I would conclude that Islams gaines are only temporary and as the populations of the world increase their standard of living they will see the weakness of Islam the association of military force with its promulgation, together with its degradation of woman, then turn to the more advanced religion of Jesus which is the Brotherhood of man founded on the Fatherhood of God lived by the Golden Rule..|`|8I9uduIiaa	The number of Muslims would be far lower - if everyone who TRIED to leave didn't get beheaded/stabbed/blown up.<br>  <br>  There is no 'if' about any of this.

Spellings often make little sense, and the spelling of one word does not match the spelling of a homophone, or similar spellings make for different sounds.

01010a65911f5a28feda86409199de49aa	Don't forget how the book of Acts commands that all members of the church give everything they own to the church so that it could be distributed to all as they had need.  It's kind of the definition of Communism.  It's interesting to me that Bush said he developed his economic policies after the book of Acts.  Did he even read it?<br>  <br>  You make a good point.  It's just another example how the religious right takes the Bible and makes it say what they want it to say in order to meet their own ends.  Everyone does it of course, but it is insideous when a particular group presents their interpretation as the only teneble use of Scripture.<br>  <br>  Then look at the churches and how they dismiss these passages.  Churches, in general, tend to be more focused on building new buildings, instituting new programs, and spending a lot of money on itself while many of its members and those in the surrounding community continue to be in need.  It is hypocracy at its highest level, but that of course is just my own opinion.|`|b2baecc05b4e40e9adb309bb648efbc6aa	he will love bush family.|`|bbbff6de064bdd6271b4a68599b2a31baa	Everybody I know agrees with you.

Just read the history.  Socialism was not applied wrong.  It is wrong.  <br>  <br>  How about the parable of the talents where Jesus complimented the capitalistic wealth growers, gave them more, and threw the unprofitable servant in hell, with great disgust?  <br>  <br>  Why has Chistianisty been so strong in one of the most anti-socialistic countries?  Why is religion the first thing to kill in socialistic and communistic countries?  <br>  <br>  You have been misled.

Socialism is a step on the way to communism, but socialism is supposed to be a violent period of time when the workers kill off the remaining bourgoisie that escaped the first round of killings in the original worker revolution.<br>  <br>  Communism is the last event in which everone left over (including prostitutes and "dirty guys" as you put it) has felt what it was like to be greedy and selfish and to have to work for nothing, so they have learned to share everything and to work to the best of their ability.  That is what Jesus would have been if you absolutely need to put a political label on him.

AA11827681	God is one, Read about God, I experienced God's love this way, so its true for me, U have an intellect so u decide for ur self, whether this is true or not. If u believe this is true, then u won't ask why others are false. When u know about true God, Where does religion come from in between U and God..<br>  Who is God?<br>  Who has been remembered as the Ocean of Love, the Intellect of the Wise, the Almighty Authority, the Comforter of Hearts, the Truth, The Living Being and the Blissful One?<br>  God Says:<br>  I am the Ocean of Love; <br>  I show you the path of love. <br>  My love remains unbroken and constant. <br>  I cannot forget even one of you. <br>  I have so much love for you,  <br>  and My love is unconditional and unlimited. <br>  I am the Beloved.You have been calling out to Me for a long time. <br>  Who Is God?<br>  We are used to knowing things by seeing them, hearing them, tasting them, touching or smelling them. Most of us have grown up in a ‘seeing–is–believing’ and ‘hands on’ culture and we are used to perceiving things in that way. Because we can’t see, hear, taste, touch or smell God, the question arises – is God for real?<br>  One can reach out to God with pure thoughts and be connected to Him. The soul experiences the response of pure feelings and spiritual strength. God is truth itself and thus can be recognized with the eye of truth.<br>  God: The Supreme Soul<br>  Like us, God is also a soul. Unlike us, He is referred to as the Supreme Soul – the only soul who never takes a body (gross or subtle, human or angelic) of His own. He is beyond the effects of actions and is never subject to the dualities of birth and death, pleasure and pain, success and failure. Being beyond the limits of time of this physical world, He retains absolute knowledge of the universe and all its dimensions.<br>  Where is God?<br>  God lives, not everywhere but somewhere. A thought of God almost always takes the eyes upwards, as though one is perhaps expecting a face to miraculously appear from behind the clouds or to beam down from the moon. Thoughts are powerful. They link one soul to another. If they are properly channelled, thoughts can even go where only the soul can travel – beyond the moon and stars to a dimension of golden red light, the original home of all souls. Immersed in the experience of the warmth of this light, the soul feels as though it is truly at home at last, and with God.<br>  God – The Spiritual Sun <br>  Like the physical sun, which gives light and life indiscriminately to all beings, God is the Spiritual Sun, giving light to all, whomever and wherever they may be. He serves altruistically, without any selfish motives, reminding each one of their innate qualities of love, peace and happiness. This is why He has been remembered in some countries and cultures by the name Shiva, The Benevolent One.<br>  God’s Wisdom, Love and Power<br>  People may wonder why, if God exists, He doesn’t wave a magic wand and fix things, making or at least influencing everyone so that they do exactly what they ‘should’ do. But God never takes away anyone’s freedom of choice. God’s wisdom is to recognize and respect each soul’s individual identity, freedom and inherent goodness. God shares knowledge – a profound understanding of the dualities and dilemmas of love and hatred, happiness and sorrow, victory and defeat, etc. – but He does not make our choices for us. The soul is free to choose ‘to be or not to be’, ‘to love or not to love’. God’s love strengthens the soul’s will to free itself from the distresses caused by vices such as selfish desire, anger, fear, ego and attachment. God’s power helps the soul to recognize its highest potential and to aim for perfection by practising the art of simple living and high thinking. Such practice by a significant number of souls eventually brings about positive change in the whole of humanity.<br>  When you learn to tune your mind in meditation to the mind of God, then whatever the situation, you always have a source of help and strength to draw upon – an infinite reservoir of power and virtues that is only a thought away|`|AA12287587	God is the one referred to in the Bible.

The site's interpretation that some of these objects are being worked by "beings attired in spacesuits" is ludicrous and is only their OPINION, not proof. What they are really doing is trying to second guess  cultural symbols and stories to fit their interpretation of them. We could just as easily guess that the flying discs are the plates upon which the Flying Spaghetti Monster travels the heavens and that the "spacesuit" guys are the waiters that handle those plates. Don't be too quick to swallow every conspiracy theory that comes along.|`|stAeoUeSaa	Azazel was one of the 200 watchers (or Igigi) sent to Mount Hermon (also called Sion), that fell madly in lust for fair human women in the days of Jared. This is told of in Genesis 6:2-9; the books of Enoch; the book of Jasher; and the book of Jubilees. Enoch says they appeared almost like 'white men' of various size. Their offspring were the Nephilim (Titans or giants). Azazel mainly but also with his friends taught their new wives and enormous offspring sorcery, astrology, weather, and lots of very highly classified information from Heaven (like merkabahs, mind control spells,etc). Think of it a minute. A pure antediluvian race from Adam living up to 300-900 years old each(Genesis 5) just learning how their world around them worked, but on top of that the watchers gave their Titanic children enough technology and power to control the entire original supercontinent called Pangaea. In fact, they did. This combination had in almost no time created a Golden Age (for the Aristocrats and a nightmare for the lower class) - a mixture of technology and spirituality this planet hasn't seen again to this day. They built the crystal skulls, Stonehenge, and all the pyramids from South America through Bosnia to China. The watchers were punished immediately as told of in 2 Peter 2:4, Jude 6, and the books of Enoch. The devouring Nephilims and others were destroyed later in the Great Flood where they tried to climb mountains and hover over the water until the merkabahs (actually a bit less glorious version called a Vimana) eventually crashed into the sea. <br>  <br>  But it was said some found safe refuge in a secret place of the Earth. This is how some of the giant line still survived down to men like the sons of Anak (Annunaki), the Rephaim, Zuzummim, Goliath from Gath, and King Og of Bashan not to mention some of the technology that wasn't lost for good (supposely) until tyrant King Nimrod (Sargon or Enmerkar) rebelled with his Tower of Babel in Eridu. It was going to be so high he boasted no flood would ever reach him and their heavenly wonder-toys again. Needless to say, God destroyed the Tower, confused all speech, divided Pangea, and scattered all the people in the time of Peleg whose name meant "divided". So bye! bye! Atlantis, Lemuria, Mu, and Ultima Thule (Hyperborea). <br>  <br>  Now a few millennia later come the Nazis with their "knowledge"of their white Aryan ancestry. Using the occult black arts to conjure demons, their father satan, and using the gorgeous but evil withces of the Vril Society as mediums to contact the imprisoned watchers to find out where the antediluvian technology was hidden... Tibet? Tunnels in the Andes?? Bolivia??? Even a strange void in Anarctica?!?! So the Nazis built Base 211 down there. America had Admiral Byrd fly to the North Pole and sure enough he found Job's 'empty place' in the North (Job 26:7) and their own stash of antediluvian goods. <br>  <br>  The Germans engineered the Nazi Bell prototype, then a real vimana- the Haunebu model, followed by another- the Vril model. They were seen during WW2 and were called foo fighters or wonderweapons. At the end of the war, America formed Operation Paperclip and tried to get as many of the German scientists and occultists before the Soviets could. They then sent Phil Schnieder and the boys behind the 'green door' to dig up the watchers from gloomy Tartarus just like the prophet foresaw (Amos 9:2) followed by digging DUMBs (deep underground military bases) to carry on experiments with the rediscovered hightech artifacts with watcher help of course. After being toasted, they now appear as tall grays, short grays, and orangish grays that all wreak of sulfur! They have retroengineered all kinds of unimaginable weapons using the antediluvian HAARP technology, Tesla rays, zero point energy, and the latest vimana called the TR-3B that uses mercury plasma magnetic vortex propusion just like the vimanas used in the great massacre of the ******* Harappan and Mohjen-Daro people (of the sons of Joktan and Raamah or Lord Rama) of the early Indus river civilization by the Aryans told of in the Rig Veda. The same Vedas that J.Oppenheimer quoted Shiva as saying, "I am become death." More specific details of vimana schematics can be found in the Vaimanika Shastra. <br>  <br>  America built Thule Air Base right on top of the ruins of Thule and Ultima Thule. The Illuminati are waiting anytime between now and July(ever wonder why Bill Clinton's favorite movie was Independence Day?) to do a pretend fallen 'alien' invasion with holographic augmentation to bring in the New World Order and the so called 'Noahdic' one world religion as told of in 2 Thessalonians 2:9-12. Only Jesus can save you off this prison planet now, and only He can if you are saved, repented, and never taken the implant(Verichip/Xmark), electronic tattoo(Somark), nor any 'Mark' told of in Revelation 13:16-18.|`|tuULGJS6aa	There's no real proof that spaceships from other planets have ever been here. There are many websites with nonsense. Ancient paintings are subject to interpretation, and UFO believers try to say that UFOs are in them, but that's not true.

If UFOs are aliens from another planet, I really can't think of a reason they would even want to visit Earth.  If the universe is approximately 14 billion years old, think of how many civilizations could have risen, fallen, and become extinct in that time.  Humans as we are today have only been on the earth for about 300,000 years or so of its 4.5 billion year history and we didn't launch our first artificial satellite until 1957.  We won't have the ability for interplanetary travel for many more generations, assuming our society lasts that long and can overcome the technological hurdles associated with it.<br>  <br>  So what are the chances that another civilization exists somewhere at the same time as ours with significantly advanced technology and the ability to detect our tiny planet and the life on it from trillions of miles away?  Not to mention traveling all the way here to do whatever it is that they do?  I would say that chance is more minuscule than is easily comprehensible.<br>  <br>  So I won't rule it out, but I don't believe it is likely.  <br>  <br>  Maybe UFOs are humans from the future traveling into the past to see what they were like thousands of years ago?  That even seems more likely to me than interplanetary travel.|`|7Sslop1Baa	I think that aliens are different.

Sn0CViR7aa	Freedom is our design as humans, including the freedom to sin.  <br>  <br>  However, sexual morality comes from God and it is also part of our design.  We are designed for sexual reproduction and to bear offspring that require two decades to mature--much longer than any other species.  The complex learning needed for adulthood requires both sexual parents working in loving partnership for life.  Accordingly, God expects those participating in his beautiful invention of sex to marry as a prerequisite for enjoying this pleasure because it carries extraordinarily heavy responsibility.<br>  <br>  In a free society, there are a few hard limits on sexuality:  It must be consenting and it must not involve a child.  Otherwise, people have a legal right to many kinds of sexual immorality.  Those who foolishly involve themselves in sexual immorality risk unmarried pregnancy, disease, degradation, and incapacity for marriage (which requires an inviolable commitment to chastity except with the spouse).<br>  <br>  This means that sexual freedoms are a legal right, but no sexual union outside marriage is morally right.  Sexuality is a choice that can mean delight or degradation--marriage or destructive sexual immorality.<br>  <br>  Cheers,<br>  Bruce|`|AA10637643	Both... because of agency, it's their "right" to choose what they do.

Now that Christianity's proven to be a myth, folks are switching to something that hasn't been.|`|AA11923447	I'm a Christian, and am currently examining other religious belief options, including Paganism. Most Pagans I know do not promote homophobia and sexism as part of their religious beliefs, whereas I run into far too many Christians who feel that discrimination is somehow okay. Also, Pagans do not generally insist that their way is the only way, and that all other beliefs are automatically wrong. There are a wide variety of paths within Paganism, including non-theistic Paganism, as opposed to many (but certainly not all) Christian groups that offer one narrow way of looking at the world, with no opposing viewpoints permitted. I have been told by many Christians that I'm going to Hell for belonging to the "wrong" denomination; I have never had a Pagan tell me that I'm going to Hell.|`|FmazIF6Maa	Religions are the same in one way-- they are largely a cultural movement, the evolve out of one another and merge and branch off. But they also have some very significant differences.<br>  <br>  The world is changing a lot. <br>  <br>  For one thing, for a very long time, the average person in the Western world didn't really have access to info about Pagan religions, and to be interested in Paganism wasn't just stigmatized, but life-threatening. <br>  <br>  Now, info is exchanged readily and freely, and there is more diversity and more tolerance for different views. You no longer have to worry about being arrested for praying to Pan.<br>  <br>  I think in our culture there are a lot of people who want to explore and embrace spirituality and religion, however they cannot as easily accept dogmatic, authoritarian religions that essentially tell them that natural impulses and inclinations are evil. Also it is getting harder and harder to stay with any religion that disputes the mounting scientific findings on the Earth, the universe and it's origins.|`|7ylYxklsaa	Generally Paganism follows simple beliefs - be kind to the world, be kind to others, try to do the right thing, and love knowledge and wisdom.<br>  <br>  There is no hell. There is no need for anyone to suffer eternally because they chose the wrong god or whathaveyou.<br>  <br>  I don't know what would cause a person to convert, but maybe they just saw more truth in one religion than another. Maybe you should ask those you know why they converted.|`|tl2pMkOcaa	It's a predictable stepping-stone to atheism.|`|f4uYkNwkaa	finally people are seeing the real light.|`|21808938a2c954ea0389683f10267c69aa	The majority of Wiccans and Neopagans are converts, because the faiths in their present form are pretty new, generally less than 100 years old (although they may be recreating something from much longer ago).  The vast majority are also in the Western world, which I'm guessing is also where you'er from.  The majority of Westerners are Christian.  Thus, simple statistics say that most Neopagan converts will be former Christians.  They're simply the largest population pool from which to draw.<br>  <br>  As a convert myself, I see it as two completely separate processes.  First I stopped being a Christian because I could find no reason to believe in it.  I did a lot of soul searching over several years and finally found Wicca, which did make sense and taught things in line with my experiences with how the world actually works.|`|ZmdIlkpQaa	With all due respect to some of your other answerers, I would suggest that the reason for the growing popularity of the many Pagan faiths and of Wicca in particular among those who have left Christianity or who are doubting their Christian faith is simple:<br>  <br>  Wica is a more balanced, tolerant faith and is tied to directly observable aspects of the divine.  There is a strong emphasis in the here and now and upon personal repsonsibility which contrasts rather sharply with the run-of-the-mill Christian denominations.  Many Christians, I've found, feel no real, tactile, daily connection with what is often seen as a distant, and somewhat stern and frowning Father/God.  By way of contrast, many Wiccans see evidence of a more tolerant Father/God and Mother/Goddess is the changing of the seasons, the cycles of the moon and even simply the cycles on sunrise and sunset.  This more tangible tie to the divine and the greater tolerance, generally, of the Wiccan Gods is almost certainly a selling point, as it were.  Additionally, many Christians feel uncomfortable with the idea of asking forgiveness for a "sin" from a distant God and / or his long dead incarnation / son.  Doesn't it make more sense to ask forgiveness from the one you harmed, rather than from a patently disinterested third party?<br>  <br>  At any rate, I've seen a similar trend to the one you mention, and the short version of my answer is that in the free marketplace of ideas, Wicca and many other Pagan faiths are simply more attractive and potentially superior to the rather threadbare ideas (or at least practices) of much of what is called Christianity today.  <br>  <br>  Please note, I am not trying to criticize Christianity as a whole, merely giving the answer from my perspective.  I know many Christians that are tolerant, intellectual, and open minded while still being very firm in their faith.  I have a standing lunch date, as a matter of fact with a Jesuit Priest, and we debate these same points and laugh and tease each other a fair amount.  I count him a very good friend indeed.|`|bgA9wLD0aa	satanlovesus didn't answer your question.  tho christianity has adopted many pagan beliefs, their core principles are nothing alike.<br>  <br>  most pagans reject the idea of one omnipotent god, the need for forgiveness, vicarious sacrifice, and the need for a savior.  we prioritize individual thought over dogma, and believe that it's our duty to question our beliefs rather than blindly accept scripture.<br>  <br>  so many christians are converting because until recently, people didn't have access to accurate information about paganism, and they're seeing that their beliefs are more accurately reflected in it.|`|UxooffHZaa	For me, Paganism made sense. And not so much Wicca or Neodruidism, or any other specific existant tradition, but my own Paganism, off the ideas I've come to understand from Christianity, Wicca, Thelema, Buddhism, Existentialist writings and other traditions I've come across. We're effected by what we come across, and in this post-modern age, where information is at our finger tips, we come across ideas that make sense, and we can put them together in our minds in a way that may not work for anyone else.|`|8rbQBaIeaa	At the time I looked at this..there were only three answers.

The journey towards the areas of Paganism is a personal journey and it is not forced. The people leaving Christianity/monotheism to Paganism might possibly be because of the attitudes and beliefs of their previous faith. I left Christianity because it didn't make sense and because I didn't like the hypocrisy, intolerance and their ideas that anything not in the bible was 'evil'; of the Christians that I knew and grew up with.|`|1498434f366a56b1b0b7643757ab51b3aa	True, there may be a lot of people that are Wiccan that used to be Christian, however, there are a lot of Christians that have converted to other religions as well; Judaism, Buddhism, etc...  I've met all kinds.  And to say they're the same thing is a very ignorant statement indeed.  You would need to know nothing about either to say they're the same.  Christianity and Paganism are not the same at all.  <br>  <br>  I was raised a Christian but it never felt right to me so I started reading about other religions until I found one that made sense: Wicca.  Christianity is a bunch of stories and hypocrisy and people acting "christian" instead of "christ-like".  <br>  <br>  I think the reason so many ex-christians are attracted to Wicca is that you leave christianity because you're too open minded for the religion.  Typically these folks are of like-mind and don't want a religion that is related to christianity but still works with faith and Gods.  Wicca is nature based and peaceful and doesn't have some certain stigma that comes with eastern religions.  You can practice magic with Wicca or you can simply read and have faith in the God and Goddess.  There is a balance in Wicca that isn't with Christianity.  <br>  <br>  I hope this helps.  Blessed Be  )0(|`|8a22338e0b623b9b154094a155112426aa	Christianity has too many hypocritical and illogical strictures that it must be very hard to deal with. As a life long Pagan I grew up along side Christian friends and I read the Bible to see if it would help me understand them better and that book is "different". "Thou shalt not kill," which doesn't seem to give a list of who should or should not be killed. "Not bearing false witness," but the stories told about Witches and Pagans being devil worshipers. Genesis tells of Adam and Eve being the first people, but then their son Cain married a woman from the land of Nod. Then there is the whole concept that God would curse his children for what Adam and Eve. If you are born in sin, then why try to be better. As a spiritual father the Christian God is very dysfunctional. If a parent did all the things that God did to his children those children would be taken away by social services.<br>  <br>  Paganism is the third fastest growing religious cross-section at this time. Our neo-Pagans want to be loved without prices, have a life that is personally fulfilling and not live a life that doesn't have rewards in the here and now. Too many Christians aren't worried about the here and now and they abuse the planet that their grand children will inherit.<br>  <br>  All I can say is thanks for the new people!|`|AA11637099	A lot of people were 'forced' into Christianity they could say because their family traditions made sure they were versed in their own ways before any other.<br>  <br>  I haven't met many wicca or pagans though.
IU2Znlv3aa	I am english and we have the NHS, which is the National Health Service.<br>  It provides free health care for everyone, for example if you need to go to A&E it would be free, your Dr's appointments are free etc etc.<br>  It's not without its problems, there can be extremely long waits for surgeries or appointments with specialist, that kind of thing, but i really do think it is a good system to have. It means that poor families can get healthcare because they don't have to worry about affording health insurance.<br>  There is private health care, which you pay for yourself if you want it. This has benefits like less waiting time, nicer hospitals, that kind of thing.<br>  Many people will probably slag off the NHS, and it is by no means perfect, but it means that everyone is entitled to healthcare, rich or poor, and that's a better system than many countries have.|`|pw4Cb45Kaa	America's health care system needs some improvement, NO DOUBT ABOUT THAT.<br>  I have medicare and a private insurance and I still can't afford my medications on a fix income.<br>  <br>  GOD BLESS!

51fe01ef6db0c1bd743afcb3e7a2e1ffaa	Yes.<br>  <br>  A woman is a man’s mother either if she carried him in her womb or if she was the woman contributing half of his genetic matter or both. Mary was the mother of Jesus in both of these senses; because she not only carried Jesus in her womb but also supplied all of the genetic matter for his human body, since it was through her—not Joseph—that Jesus "was descended from David according to the flesh" (Rom. 1:3). <br>  <br>  Since Mary is Jesus’ mother, it must be concluded that she is also the Mother of God: If Mary is the mother of Jesus, and if Jesus is God, then Mary is the Mother of God. There is no way out of this logical syllogism, the valid form of which has been recognized by classical logicians since before the time of Christ. <br>  <br>  Although Mary is the Mother of God, she is not his mother in the sense that she is older than God or the source of her Son’s divinity, for she is neither. Rather, we say that she is the Mother of God in the sense that she carried in her womb a divine person—Jesus Christ, God "in the flesh" (2 John 7, cf. John 1:14)—and in the sense that she contributed the genetic matter to the human form God took in Jesus Christ. <br>  <br>  To avoid this conclusion, Fundamentalists often assert that Mary did not carry God in her womb, but only carried Christ’s human nature. This assertion reinvents a heresy from the fifth century known as Nestorianism, which runs aground on the fact that a mother does not merely carry the human nature of her child in her womb. Rather, she carries the person of her child. Women do not give birth to human natures; they give birth to persons. Mary thus carried and gave birth to the person of Jesus Christ, and the person she gave birth to was God. <br>  <br>  The Nestorian claim that Mary did not give birth to the unified person of Jesus Christ attempts to separate Christ’s human nature from his divine nature, creating two separate and distinct persons—one divine and one human—united in a loose affiliation. It is therefore a Christological heresy, which even the Protestant Reformers recognized. Both Martin Luther and John Calvin insisted on Mary’s divine maternity. In fact, it even appears that Nestorius himself may not have believed the heresy named after him. Further, the "Nestorian" church has now signed a joint declaration on Christology with the Catholic Church and recognizes Mary’s divine maternity, just as other Christians do. <br>  <br>  Since denying that Mary is God’s mother implies doubt about Jesus’ divinity, it is clear why Christians (until recent times) have been unanimous in proclaiming Mary as Mother of God.|`|XoNuUrYoaa	Mary is not is the real mother of Jesus nor is she the mother of God.(God created Mary, not the other way round).She was an earthly surrogate mother for Jesus, nothing more.All glory is only for God, nobody else.|`|dbw210qqaa	Mary was the mother of Jesus|`|jsM8F4bLaa	just like James is God's Brother. :)|`|OC8NWQkyaa	Yes.<br>  <br>    Jesus is divine and that nature is not derived but uncreated.  His human nature is created, however.<br>  <br>    So the question is not 1) is His Divinity derived from Mary, nor is it 2) is His Humanity derived from Mary.  It is a question of WHO not what.  No mother is a mother of a nature.  Therefore who is Mary the Mother of?  Jesus.  Jesus is God.  Therefore Mary is both the Mother of Jesus and Mother of God.  It is a mystery that is difficult to fathom.  But that is one reason we say it: Theotokos. <br>  <br>  If you aren't clear on this, you may wind up questioning the divinity or the humanity of Christ.|`|1c76cd87771103aee19c4f7d36a36a65aa	Many people mess this up.<br>  jesus is the son of God, he isnt God.<br>  Jesus is the pathway to God.

The first, neos, refers to something that has just been made, but there are already many others in existence just like it. The word translated “new” in this verse is the word kainos, which means something just made which is unlike anything else in existence. In Christ, we are made an entirely new creation, just as God created the heavens and the earth originally—He made them out of nothing, and so He does with us. He does not merely clean up our old selves; He makes an entirely new self, and this new self is actually part of Christ Himself. When we are in Christ, we are “partakers of the divine nature” (2 Peter 1:4 KJV). God Himself, in the person of His Holy Spirit, takes up residence in our hearts. We are in Christ, and He is in us.<br>  <br>  When we are in Christ and He in us, we are regenerated, renewed, and born again, and this new creation is spiritually minded, whereas the old nature is carnally minded. The new nature is in fellowship with God, obedient to His will and devoted to His service. These are things the old nature is incapable of doing or even desiring to do. The old nature is dead to the things of the spirit and cannot revive itself. It is “dead in trespasses and sins” (Ephesians 2:1) and can only be made alive by a supernatural quickening which happens when we come to Christ and are indwelt by Him. He gives us a completely new and holy nature and an incorruptible life. Our old life, previously dead to God because of sin, is buried, and we are raised “to walk in newness of life” with Him (Romans 6:4).<br>  <br>  In Christ, we are united to Him and no longer slaves to sin (Romans 6:5-6); made alive with Christ (Ephesians 2:5); conformed to His image (Romans 8:29); free from condemnation and walking not according to the flesh, but according to the Spirit (Romans 8:1); and part of the body of Christ with other believers (Romans 12:5). The believer now possesses a new heart (Ezekiel 11:19) and has been blessed “with every spiritual blessing in the heavenly places in Christ Jesus” (Ephesians 1:3).<br>  <br>  We might wonder why we so often don’t live in the manner described, even though we have given our lives to Christ and are sure of our salvation. This is because our new natures are residing in our old fleshly bodies, and these two are at war with one another. The old nature is dead, but the new nature still has to battle the old “tent” in which it dwells. Evil and sin are still present, but the believer now sees them in a new perspective, and they no longer control him as they once did. In Christ, we can now choose to resist sin, whereas the old nature could not. Now we have the choice whether to feed the new nature through the Word, prayer and obedience, or to feed the flesh by neglecting those things and engaging in sin.<br>  <br>  When we are in Christ, “we are more than conquerors through Him that loved us” (Romans 8:37) and can rejoice in our Savior, who makes all things possible! In Christ we are loved, forgiven, and promised salvation. In Christ we are adopted, justified, redeemed, reconciled, and chosen. In Christ we are victorious, filled with joy and peace, granted true meaning in life.

That is, the Bible has been protected and transmitted down through the centuries without loss of meaning and doctrine (2Tim.3:16,17).<br>  <br>  Witnesses do not believe that there are later books or inspired records which update the Bible.<br>  <br>  Mormons will say they believe and teach the Bible, yet when the Bible contradicts the Book of Mormon their final statement of belief is that they "believe the Bible in so far as it's translated correctly." And of course where there is disagreement with their beliefs the Bible must have been corrupted.<br>  <br>  On the other hand, Witnesses promote complete trust in the Bible and always base their beliefs on it. They openly point out where TRANSLATORS have made errors, not based on a disagreement with their beliefs but based on standard Greek and Hebrew texts, lexicons and context of Scripture itself.<br>  <br>  Also, Witnesses readily present solid evidence for the Bible's historical accuracy from history and archaeology while Mormon's cannot point to any historical records or conclusive archaeological finds that corroborates the Book of Mormon's "history." Nor can they demonstrate that it was "translated correctly" since there are no original language manuscripts of the BOM, nor actually even any record  that the said language even existed.<br>  <br>  Another major difference is that, just like 99 percent of Christendom, Mormons will go to war and even kill members of their own Church from other countries.<br>  <br>  Since Christ said that love even of our enemies would be an absolute identification of True Christians (Mat. 5:44; 7:15-20; Jn.13:34,35), Jehovah's Witnesses have proven that they are Christian while these others have proven the opposite.<br>  <br>  Hope this helps,<br>  <br>  Ron Rhoades|`|5OucqEzFaa	Jehovah's Witnesses are not alone in believing Jesus was the Son of God yet not actually God. They consider the Trinity to be pagan and deny the deity of Jesus and say he was not God incarnate. I do not know what the LDS position is on the person of Jesus in relationship to God the Father and God the Holy Spirit. I will only say that the LDS say Elohim and his wife brought forth Jehovah (the Yahweh of the Old Testament) who then became the man, Jesus. This is so out of alignment with orthodox Christianity I cannot even begin to explain how un-biblical it is.<br>  <br>  Just let me say that Jehovah's Witnesses abhor Catholicism - and they don't have anything good to say about Protestants either. According to Jehovah's Witnesses, they and only they have the truth and they, and only they, will be saved when Armageddon turns up. <br>  <br>  You've asked what the differences are between J.W's and LDS. The differences are too vast to even begin to do it justice. I suspect LDS teach Jesus was only one of many Gods, but not Elohim, or God Almighty himself. However, they're very shy about sharing this theology with anyone outside of their belief system.|`|9Dq2176oaa	I can not speak for LDS but all the info you need on JW can be found at www.watchtower.org|`|DBg0yFSYaa	Jehovah's Witnesses dont' believe in heaven except for the chosen 144000. The goal for Jehovah's Witnesses is to be good enough to be resurrected and live forever on earth after all the evil has been removed. <br>  <br>  LDS believe there are different levels of heaven you can acheive. They also believe that God was once a man on another planet who acheived the highest level and became the God to our world. He also had a wife. I went to their service on Mother's Day a few years ago and they talked about the fact that we have a heavenly mother who is rarely spoken of. I saw the missionaries I had been studying with snap their heads around to check my reaction.|`|p0BVk8lhaa	First its "Latter Day Saints" & "Son" of God.<br>  <br>  JW's believe that Jesus is the Son of God, Almighty God Jehovah, because that is what it says in the Bible!<br>  <br>  Please look up Psalms 83:18 in YOUR Bible to proves that is God's name (English translation of the Hebrew name YHWH).|`|AA11282654	Jehovah Witness's are tied more closely to Catholics.

26DoxkOBaa	Yes, it was. The Sanhedrin were the evil-doers in collusion with the Romans. They robbed the people by exchanging currencies and had people who challenged their authority murdered. Killing people like Jesus was a common practice of theirs, and Jesus was looked at as a traitor to the Sanhedrin, since Jesus was at one time a Rabbi who had come to know the evilness of the Jewish religion.

eb4e977a0cb9ce50b08bf74f0f3a0c61aa	Here is truth - read and understand. <br>  1. Vampires, defined as a humanoid being that MUST consume blood or energy to survive do not exist. Werewolves do not exist. Cut and paste time, as it is too much work to type this out over and over and I "recycle" my own answers instead of retyping them so here goes. A brief discussion of the human digestive system and then the probable vampire population given an exponential growth rate should explain why vampires are not possible. <br>  <br>  2. The human body is not designed to process large amounts of blood for nutrition. There is not enough protein, carbohydrates, and fats present in blood to maintain a complex creature such as Homo Sapiens or any theorized offshoot mutations. When a human ingests food it is first broken up into a bolus by chewing, then churned up in the stomach with digestive juices to form a mass called chyme. It then passes through the pylorus into the duodenum, part of the small intestine where it mixes with bile salts and secretions from the pancreas and liver which continue breaking it down on a molecular basis, mostly affecting fats at this point. The broken down nutrients pass through the wall of the intestines and into the bloodstream where they are carried to each cell or stored for later use. Indigestible bulk continues through the intestines, turning a dark brown from the bile. Water is absorbed from this mass in the large intestine depending on the needs of the body - a well-hydrated person will usually have a softer stool than a dehydrated person will. Water also enters the bloodstream, and this is what helps to maintain blood pressure. The pressure tends to balance itself in a healthy person because the bloodstream goes through a formation in the kidney called the Loop of Henle, where the narrowing blood vessel forces excess water and cellular waste such as urea out through the cellular wall into the kidneys, where it is excreted through the ureters into the bladder, and then out of the body via the urethral passageway.<br>  <br>  3. IMPORTANT - A person physically unable to process his own food for nutrition therefore also could not process blood - it's the same process. Ingested blood does not transmit directly to the veins anyway - it would be chemically broken down by the digestive system.<br>  <br>  4. Theoretical ingestion of blood to supply these nutrients would therefore have to occur at least once a day, and would require the ingestion of the entire blood supply which could not happen as the stomach is far too small to hold that much liquid volume. Hold up your clenched fist - under normal conditions your stomach is about that size. Furthermore, such a mass would be difficult to pass thru the intestines as it has no fibrous bulk, would create an intestinal impaction, causing massive vomiting from the large concentration of iron present, and any "real" vampire would have to eventually expel the waste, which would come out as a black, tarry, smelly goo, just as stool does when blood is present from a upper GI bleed. <br>  <br>  5. These humans that affect the whole "vampiric lifestyle" are NOT vampires. They are simply humans playing their own little game, in their own little fantasy world, usually pandering to their own little sexual fetish, which may or may not actually be sexual. I too, play my own little game, in the SCA, but mine is a game where the deeds that I do are determined by the strength of my arm and sword - I am a warrior, with just as much skill and ability as any warrior of ancient times. The difference is that I am claiming to be something physically possible: a warrior, and I prove it everytime I strap on my armor and walk onto a SCA battlefield. The so-called "vampires" are claiming to be something physically impossible: a walking corpse, and all they prove is that black Victorian clothing, a pair of false fangs, and a little makeup make for a good Halloween costume - it does not make you a vampire.<br>  <br>  6. Even if a vampire feeds once a week, and his victim also becomes a vampire, that is exponential growth, with four iterations a month. First iteration: One makes one, total two. Second iteration: Two make two, total four. Third iteration: Four make four, total eight. Fourth iteration: Eight make eight, total sixteen. 16 vampires at the end of one month, 256 at the end of the second month, 4096 by the end of the third month, 65,536 by the end of the fourth month, 1,048,476 at the end of the fifth, and 33,572,832 vampires at the end of half a year! By way of comparison, there are currently approximately 33 million people who have HIV/AIDS in the U.S. alone, and the disease is a world-wide epidemic. I see people every day in the hospital with AIDS, but never has there been one documented case of a vampire attack. Do the math - vampires are a mathematical impossibility. As for the idea that vampires existed "a long time ago" consider the estimated global population 5,000 years ago - using the above mathematical rationale, a single vampire converted every human on the globe in less than two years. This falls therefore, under the logic of Occam's Razor - which states that when you have removed every impossible answer, whatever remains, no matter how improbable, must be the truth. Since there is no "vampiric plague" swarming the earth, the logical deduction is that they don't exist.<br>  <br>  7. Point of clarification about "vampire" bats: vampire is simply the name we have given them because they do drink blood, same as a flea, mosquito, leech, or spider. Are these creatures vampires? No. They are living creatures, not legendary monsters. They can subsist on blood because of their smaller size and proportionately larger stomach volume. Drinking blood does not make you a vampire anymore than eating raw meat makes you a werewolf, although it might make you a mosquito.<br>  <br>  8.The humans who profess to be vampires are victims of an all-encompassing self induced delusion. They are as human as you or I, regardless of their claims, and if they ingest HIV tainted blood they can most certainly contract the disease, esp. if they have any cuts, sores, or lesions in and or around their mouth. It is a very dangerous delusion to be laboring under. Note that there is absolutely no scientific or medical proof that these people derive any benefit at all from the ingestion of blood, and even worse are the so-called "psychic" vampires, because their delusion is one that they cannot substantiate with any concrete evidence at all.<br>  <br>  9. There is no "vampire" gene. People are not "born" as vampires. When a woman goes to the hospital for prenatal care there are many tests done on mother and child, even while still in the womb, to check for many things, including genetic anomalies that result in deformities and birth defects. If such a gene existed, in today's world with today's technology it would have been found - we have already completely sequenced the human genome. It would also have to follow Mendel's law of dominant/recessive gene theory. Again, the odds on that many "vampires" all escaping the notice of the medical/scientific community are so low as to be almost nonexistent. The idea that there is a global "vampire community" engaging in controlled breeding to keep the "bloodline pure" is delusional in the extreme.<br>  <br>  10. There is no "vampire virus" - as I have already pointed out, HIV is a virus, and look at how fast it has spread - virtually everyone knows someone with the affliction. According to the "vampire websites" there are "thousands" of vampires running around. If that was so then at least one of them has ended up in a hospital for bloodwork when they became pregnant, had a bloodborne infection, was injured in a car wreck, etc, etc, ad nauseum. The anomaly would have been detected and medical science would have isolated it, studied it, applied for research grants on it, published papers on it, and turned it into the talk of the medical and scientific community, as well as making its "discoverers" celebrities and rich beyond their dreams. A virus cannot alter your DNA in such a radical fashion without killing you.<br>  <br>  11. The idea that a human can shapeshift into a wolf or hybrid form is a myth only. There are no real werewolves. In order for a human to do this, it would require gross physiological changes, starting with a complete rewriting of every DNA strand in his body. Next, the skeletal structure would change, with rapid loss of bone in some areas and rapid growth of bone in others, with the attendent restructuring of muscle connections, tendons, and ligaments, a complete reorganization of every major organ in the torso, as well as a rerouting of the circulatory system. The dermis would have to suddenly, spontaneously grow thicker, and every hair follicle would have to be repatterned to grow fur. There would have to be a reallocation of body fat, and probably some loss or gain of body mass. Lastly, the shape, size, and function of the brain would change. This is most important - when you lose brain tissue you cannot regrow it, and even if you could, you would not regain the memories or functions associated with that tissue, such as what happens to brain tissue irrevocably lost in a stroke. If a man could change into a wolf, and then somehow change back (ignoring the fact that the excruciating pain from such changes would overload his system and he'd likely go into cardiac arrest and die), once he changed back he would still only have the mental capacity of a wolf, and be a drooling idiot at best, or a mindless homicidal maniac at worst.|`|wdnbwViFaa	I believe in vampires, they seem so real<br>  werewolves not so much|`|aZXnW6AUaa	warewolves|`|3wAkbWqSaa	vampires, in my opinion, are the only mythical creature that may actually exist. They may be like the blood-sucking terrors in an Anne Rice novel or they could be sparkly like Stefanie Meyer saw them. I think vampires might be real. Werewolves on the other hand, don't exist.|`|WhUV9k6Jaa	I don't.  While I'm open to the idea that anything is possible, I think we've expanded as a civilization to the point were if these beings existed they couldn't stay hidden.  Also, advancements in our understanding of biology make the stories of how they sustain themselves and transform very dubious.|`|PkXJRfaBaa	Vampires, Yes<br>  Werewolves, sort of...<br>  <br>  Vampires are real, but they're not the one's you read about in literature. Google Sanguine Vampires for proof.|`|sqR0iyuWaa	I've come across people who claim to drink blood for enjoyment. There are a number of ways to get it. They generally have other vampire-esque attributes.|`|snWybep8aa	Werewolves, yea. Vampires, not the stereotype of them.|`|6UKichdAaa	not werewolves couldnt they just be really hairy ppl? vampires yes<br>  <br>  i mean this may seem doble standard but I believe Allah did create vampires. Not like what you see in movies though.|`|UOIcXs7Haa	Neither, but there are some very hairy people about. I suppose you could consider them werewolves.|`|GPmBB0Mvaa	Yes and Yes. I am friends to them and with a vamp.|`|HEDSOHq1aa	google therianthropy or otherkin|`|v20S8oSJaa	im.............. a bit of both!<br>  XXX Naomi XXX|`|gq9W69rcaa	yes google the term otherkin|`|NgRiFZ7Baa	Not vampires, but certainly werewolves. I for one am a half-werewolf.<br>  BTW:<br>  1. Werewolves transform every night, not just the full moon. However, the transformation becomes more intense and more wolfish as the full moon approaches.<br>  2. Werewolves can take medicine to help subdue the transformation - on every night except the full moon when the transformation is complete. This is why they only appear on the full moon.<br>  3. The werewolf can turn others into werewolves not only by biting, but also in the ways that HIV/AIDS can be spread - contact with body fluids. Also if one or both parents are werewolves, the child ALWAYS will be.<br>  4. Half-werewolves are formed by being turned by a half-werewolf or if your mother is bitten while pregnant and gives birth before the next full moon. (If the full moon comes and the mother transforms, the baby will be fully werewolf.)<br>  5. Half-werewolves can use the medicine every day because the transformation is never complete. So they can't be tracked.<br>  6. Werewolves were attempted to be eradicated before it was decided that they were human enough to obtain protection from the human rights. So now they can't be killed, just "displaced" to "secure locations". Of course, that doesn't stop some folk.<br>  <br>  So: no to vampires, but an absolute yes to werewolves. Take it from the experts.|`|7Sslop1Baa	No. Full stop. They don't exist. At least the usual stereotypes don't.<br>  <br>  However, total psychos like Transylvanian-born Vlad III Dracula did <br>  exist and still mad as*holes exist, only today they're called maniacs.<br>  <br>  They drink blood and are usually satanists, since Christianity doesn't<br>  forgive bloodsuckers and killers. But they don't have superpowers or<br>  anything. They're just sick humans. They're possessed.|`|JwDhOMRqaa	no,
PvPPivLJaa	I hate people who are rude. It literally boils my blood instantly and it's something I have to consciously control. Like yesterday in class, we were pairing up because we had a big research project in this huge law library and the teacher says, "OK the two Sylvia's are together." One of them says, "No! I'll be working alone." She could have said it to me because I was that pissed.<br>  <br>  And like someone else, anyone who hurts children is dead in my book.|`|2sLv6uXtaa	People who dont show yhoo respect...people who step on u like their not seeing yhoo....people who just try and make your day worser then it is....or trying to put yhoo ina bad mood....i dont hate becuz ur focusing energy on the person/people i just tend to dislike and have a sour taste in my mouth if i have to speak or see the ppl...etc|`|HMFR1I01aa	People who don't give me respect|`|eqaUMrYZaa	I only truly hate those that cause physical and mental pain and agony to those I love.Other than that who gives a f**ck !!|`|ncdTxID9aa	I don't hate, but I dislike people who are normally ignorant.|`|WSIZKAQcaa	I hate people who lie and manipulate to get what they want.|`|3zj8Kd0xaa	We hate people because their opinions oppose our own opinions, otherwise we have psychological illnesses. When you hate someone it's because the differences in ideology. You may hate your parents and call them "geeks" (although this is very bad), but it is still your job to respect them. You may hate your friends and you both may break down, but you still have to respect them in other cases. <br>  So, hating people for certain reasons, but you still have to respect them as they are.<br>  For example you may hate your friend when he calls you a "jerk", although he is kidding, but still you hate him when he does so. We may hate many people, but it's our job to respect the people we hate, unless war will happen and there will be no PEACE in the world.|`|d9tCS7BPaa	child molesters and rapists<br>  <br>  i hate rude overbearing homeless people who bang on your car window, or get angry at you if you refuse to give them change. at least be polite about begging.<br>  <br>  i hate racism.|`|j4VqprfCaa	People who start rumors on my family like my Ex- friend was telling lies to this girl about my sis after my sis was sent to anther school she started telling lies about my sis right in front of me ever seince i hated her.|`|ReSgCXaJaa	Yeah i'd have to say when the ones i care about are threatend or hurt. Either that or when some one physically trys to bully me, but that doesn't happen much any more...|`|UMb1wrdBaa	When they steal my boyfriend and/or when they talk behind my back|`|qwvijKexaa	when people hurt my friends
d9tCS7BPaa	more internet usage = less getting laid.|`|pw4Cb45Kaa	People thing they can do everything on their own, but to a true Christian it is God's will and not ours.  If one gives God all their worries and troubles, one wouldn't have to carry the world.  God gives peace and love to anyone that believes.<br>  <br>  GOD BLESS!   AMEN!    SHALOM!|`|0iOqIbfNaa	society is just that way...cant be explained|`|QNAI0jeYaa	Its a fast moving country and a struggle to keep up. The USA anyways.

4fIexR5Daa	El verano pasado, fui a Missouri (Misuri in Spanish) con dos de mis amigos cercanos. Fuimos a esquiar en el agua, a nadar, pasar por el metro y a hacer compras. Mientras hacíamos las compras, nos quedamos atascadas en una enorme tormenta. Casi todas las vías estaban inundadas pero logramos regresar a casa.

Fuimos esquí acuático, natación, tubería y las compras. Mientras que hacíamos compras conseguimos pegados en un enorme asaltamos. La mayor parte de los caminos habían sido inundados encima, pero finalmente lo hicimos casero. La parte pasada del viaje que terminamos encima de toneladas de observación de películas y comiendo porciones de alimento y subiendo con bromas interiores locas, eso podemos todavía reír alrededor hoy.<br>  <br>  <br>  joannaaaa below me translated your paragraph this way....<br>  <br>  I was the summer last to Missouri with two of my near friendly. We were water skiing, swimming, pipe and the purchases. Whereas we did purchases we secured patches in an enormous one we assaulted. Most of the ways had been flooded above, but finally we made caretaker. The part passed of the trip that we finished upon tons of observation of films and eating inner portions of food and raising with crazy jokes, that we can still laugh around today.<br>  <br>  I translated it the correct way.|`|X605sT7oaa	El verano pasado yo fui a Missouri con dos de mis amigos íntimos.

Or "Mientras hacíamos las compras".<br>  3. Or "Casi todas las calles".|`|RB8OGBMUaa	what exactly do you need help with? what would you struggle with if you tried it yourself?<br>  <br>  or do you mean: "translate this paragraph for me"
mYe6TDmzaa	Well I would stay with him if I were straight.  I would not want to supress who he is just because I don't like what he does.  That is just selfish.|`|wvJxtmJTaa	Lol i'd laugh so hard if a saw a male doing that, but then id accept them|`|5wej1TKDaa	I think I'd die of laughter, my husband would NOT make a pretty woman.  Still, I don't think I'd be alive to accept him, after literally dying of laughter.|`|qGVBxZZOaa	At first I would laugh really hard...<br>  But, yeah.<br>  I'd accept him.<br>  What ever floats his boat!|`|LpMGGmFuaa	My GF never wears femmy things... she just collects them|`|02gR3jZoaa	First I am a lesbian so this might be different from a straight girls answer but it interested me:<br>  I would probably laugh and say that he can have all my next years Christmas presents, (my family has a tenancy of buying me 'girly' things that I would never wear) I might be a bit sad that he felt like he couldn't be himself around me, but then again as you mentioned there are several people who might seem to be accepting and then turn out not to be. So overall, I would be fine with it and try to support him no matter what he liked to wear.<br>  It's what's on the inside that counts.|`|7uNASlURaa	I would be supportive.  If anything I would take pride in him.  Maybe take him out and help him pick out outfits.  Maybe he could even help me.|`|T588vfJDaa	I would laugh for ages. Then hug him. Then make love to him with us both crossdressing. That could only improve our relationship|`|AuVlR4cYaa	Uhh, my typical guy type if more feminine (:<br>  Girls pants, tight shirts, etc.<br>  So I guess I'd be pretty accepting?|`|4EVlYLvuaa	Well I would probably wished he had trusted me enough to tell me up front. But being bisexual myself I know the kind of controversy and fear people go through with opening up about this. My boyfriend is bisexual and I am so happy he told me early in our relationship. He hasn't "came out" to many people yet. I don't mind having relationships with "odd" people. Lol, that seems to be the only kind I ever get in actually. Anyways, back to the question, I don't think it should be too early in the relationship but definitely sometime in the beginning stages. If the girl doesn't accept who you are then she's not good enough for you! Same towards guys!|`|f9c243c2af97a6e10cb12588a507efcaaa	For me its simple. I would consider this a very little problem. My issues would be about honesty,your values  as a person, integrity, morales,and whether or not you work for a living ; and not live off the govt.! I also do not think people should be so sue happy!

They don't have the courage to just report the news and teach history. <br>  <br>  People of my generation just roll our eyes at the lies put out by the media and the educational system. Unfortunately, our children believe these liars and, as a generation, have swallowed their agenda whole. <br>  <br>  If people really understood what was going on there, we would be applauding the gargantuan and brave Israeli efforts at peace.

Absolutely nothing wrong with them. I mean Jesus himself was a Jew! I'm not Jewish, but its very disturbing how we are seeing this growing hatred of the nation of Israel. Even in our own country! We have these "American Nazis" and I wouldn't be suprised if there are a few radical Muslims. I cannot understand why people want to speak in the defense of Hamas, or any radical terrorist organization. Hamas are made up of a bunch of cowards who attach bombs to themselves and fire rockets at innocent men, women, and children. Then they make it look like its the Israelis who are the source of the problem. Thats a lie. Hamas is the problem. Just like Bin Laden is our problem.

6Vik1aPcaa	You need to use articles ALMOST everytime. Why? I really don't know :D<br>  <br>  But is a Spanish basic hard rule. Articles (mainly The - El, la, los, las, lo) are used before every noun and substantive. If you don't include them, the sentence is incomplete and cannot be clear.<br>  <br>  I'm not a professor or teacher, but jusr a native spanish speaker.<br>  <br>  Also other thing: in case of adectives, in Spanish those usually are said /after/ the noun: "El béisbol es mi /deporte favorito/." If you invert them each other, the sentence is still right, but that way is not common in the daily talking. It is intended more for "poetic" porpouses.|`|4r6d8Aieaa	You need to put el before béisbol in this case.<br>  There are a lot of rules about this. Here is a page that will tell you about when you can omit them.<br>  <a href="http://spanish.about.com/cs/grammar/a/use_def_art.htm" rel="nofollow">http://spanish.about.com/cs/grammar/a/us...</a>|`|4fIexR5Daa	You have to include articles in almost every singe noun. Don't ask me why, that's just it. 'La, el' are like 'the' in English but, unlike 'the', they must be used in almost every occasion. They are important because they define the gender of the object. 'Béisbol' is a boy (masculine) so it's 'El'. 'Natación' (which is the sport of swimming, or however you call it' is a girl (feminine), so you say 'La natación.' Gender in Spanish is super important, just like in French. I guess gender is one of the biggest differences between Spanish and English <br>  <br>  About your sentence, you also have to inverse the adjective and the noun. In Spanish, you usually put the adjective after the noun. There are some exceptions but in general, it is after the noun. For example, in english you'd say 'What a PRETTY rose'. But in Spanish, it'd be 'Que rosa tan BONITA'. In your case it would be 'El Béisbol es mi deporte favorito'.<br>  <br>  Hope that helps!

It once WAS Christianity, since the word of Christ spread to Rome very quickly.  But just as you see in the Bible talk of good churches and bad, churches that adhere to the word of God and those that stray, Catholicism strayed.  ALL churches run that risk!!!  By the 1500's, Catholicism had strayed BIG TIME!  Martin Luther, a devout Catholic was troubled by the stark contrasts that he saw between Catholic teaching and BIBLE teaching.  In other words, the WORD OF GOD was not what Catholicism was teaching in certain very specific areas of their teaching.<br>  <br>  Every Christian must adhere to the idea that what we believe, what we teach, and what we follow is sola scriptura (scripture alone).  If we don't abide by that then your opinion matters just as much as mine and the church can teach anything it wants to teach.  <br>  <br>  I always say, "Don't tell me what you think, SHOW ME THE SCRIPTURE!"  Martin Luther said that to the Catholic church.  And they told him to shut up.  And 400 years later, they ignore him!<br>  <br>  The entire Protestant (literally "to protest") movement came about because of Luther's stand against the lies of the Catholic church.  In the 400 years since then, LOTS and LOTS of Protestant denominations have "broken off" and/or "broken away" from the teachings of the Bible as well.<br>  <br>  The mainstream Protestant denominations who themselves are fighting to stay true to God's word will point out the many--and I mean MANY ways that the Catholic church has strayed and stretched Biblical teaching.  They consider its teachings on how you get saved to be so wrong that it makes them a cult (i.e., the Catholics believe that they play a role in their own salvation, which is completely counter to Biblical teaching).  <br>  <br>  For Catholic apologists, I ask simply that you show me the scripture that explains your teachings on the following:<br>  <br>  1. We see the scripture that says ALL have sinned and fallen short of the glory of God.  But the protestant faiths have missed the scripture that explains how one man, the Pope, can be called "the HOLY Father."  To us, the only Holy Father is God Himself!  Show us the scripture!!!<br>  <br>  2. Where's the scripture that explains annulments?  I mean, we KNOW that God hates divorce.  It's in the Bible.  We also know that God allows for divorce under certain circumstances.  That too is in the Bible.  But ... where's the scripture on annulments, an uniquely Catholic teaching?<br>  <br>  3. Explain purgatory using ONLY scripture.<br>  <br>  There are others ...<br>  <br>  Praying to Mary.  The Rosary.  The idoltry within their faith.  Priests having to stay unmarried.  Etc, etc.<br>  <br>  So, the bottom line is that the Catholic church IS a Christian religion.  I just believe that it has strayed from the teachings of the Bible.  WHEN does a church stray soooooooooo much that it's no longer Christian?  Only God knows where that line is!|`|QHf2Ov6yaa	a catholic is a christian.

Catholics do not worship Mary. the revere her as the mother of their savior, and as a woman who was free from sin. they do not worship idols. they do drink actual wine during communion, but that's because actual wine was used in the last supper. They also believe that the bread and wine is the actual body and blood of Jesus Christ, and not just a symbol. They believe that during Confession the Priest is opening a direct channel to God. as for Baptised and Christened, Christening is the name you are given at Baptism. hope this has cleared up any confusion caused by people who don't know what they're talking about.|`|Jj8JlApvaa	Catholicism has more proved documented miracles then any other religion in the world, [and still on going]<br>  I respect most other Christian domination's, but there are those who profess to be christian breed animosity.<br>  <br>  Catholicism have made mistakes in its 2000yrs of history,<br>   but what great church is without sin,<br>  We don't jump up and down, but quietly immense  and participate with the beautiful act of the mass.|`|1fB2UdRHaa	Catholics are Christians...|`|7PbJWEo1aa	condoms, marriage and confession.

I would not advise stopping therapy all together, but maybe he would fill more comfortable if you offer to try another therapist or another type of therapy.  Unacceptably they therapy is getting to his emotions a bit much. Have you guys ever considered speaking with an online specialist in this field? I have provided a link below that will help for extra therapy. Sometimes telling all face to face can get to some one in ways. I have found that a lot of people say that they enjoy therapy more when it is not pressed upon them in open sessions. <br>  Here is another important note also, Try not to push the fact that therapy is necessary for a better relation ship. Therapy can only help so much, and the rest is up to you guys. Communication is the key in all relationships. If problems arise you can not expect all problems in your relationship to be fixed by someone else in a few therapy sessions. You guys have to practice some of these things on your own. <br>  <br>   I would be glad to speak with you more openly and more helpfully if you need to chat about what all is going on and help you in these areas of your relationship. To get in touch with me follow link below.
NwXnzARwaa	In August 2002 Gallup asked Americans, in an open-ended format, to estimate the percentage of American men and the percentage of American women who are homosexual. The average estimates were that 21% of men are gay and 22% of women are lesbians. In fact, roughly a quarter of the public thinks more than 25% of men and 25% of women are homosexual. It should be pointed out, too, that many Americans (at least one in six) could not give an estimate.<br>  <br>  Male respondents tend to give lower estimates of both the male and female homosexual population than female respondents do. The average estimates among male respondents are that 16% of men and 21% of women are homosexual. Among female respondents, the average estimates are that 26% of men and 23% of women are homosexual.

SDDgbtQ4aa	All humans have some inherent extrasensory perception, what we often call psychic abilities.  We tend to trust in and utilize these senses when we are younger - before we become jaded by society which often fears what it does not understand and insists that using these senses is wrong or bad - so many of us end up tuning them out and ignoring them.  If you stopped using a particular muscle in your body for an extended length of time, it would cease to function properly.

He is the boss after all.<br>  <br>  <br>  nfd?|`|RoqxGbgRaa	start sending out resumes!!|`|HOQp0gA7aa	My solution is to keep my nose to the grindstone at work, and look for opportunities to work under someone who isn't a jerk.  Sometimes it takes a while, but it is a better long run decision than getting into a power struggle with your boss at work.   <br>  <br>  If your boss won't let you go or leave you alone, then take them aside in private and let them know exactly and unemotionally what you think about their managerial qualities.  After letting them have it with your analytical critique, mention that if they will not let you work under a different manager you will bring your issues up to their superior.  This only works in relatively large organizations, and if you work for a small business, you might as well put in your resignation that same day if you use this approach.<br>  <br>  I hope this helps.|`|OXljAxooaa	Maybe try talking to your boss's boss about it (best done in confidence, as your boss would not appreciate that you took an issue over his/her head to their boss).  Or if there's just no hope that he/she will straighten out, like others have suggested, look for a new job.  Almost no money/job is worth having to answer to an unreasonable boss.|`|IB2V5t1Oaa	You just nod your head and bite your tongue. Remember that he's the guy that signs your check and in this economy, you don't want to lose your job because you said what was really on your mind, right? :)|`|rThIVk2maa	Well, my first and most obvious answer would be to start looking for other employment... but it depends on the situation I guess.|`|u4HO7fLOaa	Alby, does he treat everyone like that or only you? If it's everyone, then don't take it to heart -- just view him like you would anyone with an emotional problem they can't help (because it's likely he/she does have some sort of problem). If you're being singled out for special torment, then perhaps do take it to heart -- but still treat him/her like someone with an uncontrollable emotional problem. Then ask yourself an important question: Is dealing with the person so unbearable that it would be worth giving up your job over? And would you be able to find a new job with relative ease? If the answer to both questions is "Yes," quickly and quietly start applying for jobs. <br>  <br>  If you are in a top-level position or a very unique position and really couldn't find another, similar job elsewhere, it might be worth it to stand up and fight -- blow the whistle on the bad boss to higher level management. Even if you do try, however, realize that chances are good that change will either be very slow or non-existent. <br>  <br>  If you do decide to take action against the unreasonable boss, don't go to him/her; go to his/her boss first. And before you say a word, ask the person with whom you are talking to keep your conversation confidential. Do not put anything in writing at this point. And see what that person has to say before you proceed with anything else. <br>  <br>  A final tip -- keep a detailed log of everything the lousy boss does wrong. Log the time, the date, and the incident. These logs are golden in terms of establishing your credibility and can be very useful in the event that the whistleblowing escalates into a legal issue.|`|9506a1db9a1342b92861588bda077053aa	I will find tissue paper to clean it.............
6Vik1aPcaa	Ok... I don't know what the hell does "etolo" mean!! Hahaha...<br>  <br>  The second sentence is "?No que no?", and it is said when, for example, someone eventually does an action, which he/she usually didn't want to do.<br>  <br>  For example: Let's supose that I'm jumping the bungie but you don't want to do it. Then I challenge you. You still don't want to jump, but you finally decides doing so. I say a hilarious "?No que no?" indicating that you ended up jumping at last.<br>  <br>  It is like to say: "Ooh.. and who was saying you didn't dare?"|`|9Zjk9dRqaa	No que no is saying that's what i thought. etolo don't know what that is it's not even a word in spanish try to pay more attention to the word next time.|`|OpLpq3rIaa	Maybe he said 'y todo' which means 'and everything.'<br>  <br>  ?No que no?  means (more or less) - 'I thought you weren't going to do that?'  For example, when someone says that they don't want something to eat or they don't want to do something (going to the movies, etc.) and at that moment they are determined with their answer, then they turn around and do it anyway.|`|6UKichdAaa	i think u mean ta loca on george lopez<br>  <br>  you know when hesays something like " Me getting emotional, ta loca!"

If you were a pretty accomplished swimmer I would say that I doubt you would have any problems picking it back up again.  Practice in the shallow end where you can touch bottom while getting used to swimming again. If you enjoyed swimming when you were 10, I think that would be a good motivational factor in helping you swim again.  If at 10 you had trouble putting your face underwater, or fighting feelings of panic, it will of course be a much harder go of things.  Most of us have happy summer memories of swimming and this, I think makes us want to overcome" whateve" r to experience that pleasure again.  And swimming, I think can be one of the most enjoyable forms of sports or exercise there is.  Don't overdo it, just concentrate on enjoying being in the water again.  I once went swimming when I hadn't been in a pool in many years, and I felt I had to really work out and practice racing turns and swim underwater the length of the pool over and over like it was old swim team practice.  I couldn't figure out why the next day my arms and shoulders ached so much and why my eyes had a burning sensation!  So doin't over do it.

Needless to say it is actively and intentionally repressed by the evil establishments doctrine.

"...If they say "it [an identity] deviates" I ask "Deviates from what?"

Religion may say one thing about sexes and bodies and genders etc, but whatever force shaped the universe included intersexes, a natural, biological occurance, even in humans, to show that indeed the world is not only made of males and females, but of an entire spectrum of natural human body shapes and sizes. Where humans have clouded the world, their own hearts, and each other's with ideas about how they would prefer things to be, I'm sure the Master Maker(s) of the universe knew what they were doing when they gave us living, walking, breathing proof thathuman life doesn't rest upon a dicotomy, but rather an intelligent design of intricate and complex, beautiful human beings of all sizes, shapes, multiple colors per person, what glorious, beautiful creations are humans! In their very own bodies they hold truths more powerful than socially constructed "truths." I mean, are we calling the Creator(s) liars? Surely intelligent design left us clues to help us weed out fallible logic.<br>  <br>  So, if there are more than two sexes, wouldn't that mean that there are more than two genders? Hrm... what if gender were as made up as the days of the week? Only their because they are convenient for some people... And if we were all just human beings, before all other labels a person, a fallible person could ever stick onto another fallible person, then, all this tresspassing nature, if it is that, has already been done by the very people trumpeting this nonsense about how much they know about "nature" and "natural" and what others should be doing with their bodies." <br>  <br>  links:<br>  1) The Natural Human Theory (a theory in which trans-anything is no less deviant than man-gender and woman-gender etc.) <br>  <br>  2) Gender Schmender (gender education community)<br>  <br>  3) Intersexes (intersex education community)|`|6bd524b158cd908d4fd528f37faf335faa	Only if you don't want to be one.|`|AA12289447	It can be difficult, but in and of itself, it is not a bad thing, merely a challenge.|`|ad9da40d9ed43bdf634afeb109c36c3aaa	no its not bad at all . are you thinking you might be wired wrong. and do you have femint ways  and desires that burn like a fire in your head and cannot make it stop filling traped and helpless for guildance. and acceptance  from others|`|c4218724de920af3a3bd1676d525556faa	Well, YEA!|`|e858ff353551e0ed7af3c7a3d524f306aa	I don't think so, but I'm a bit biased...<br>  <br>  It's definately challenging, though.  There's a lot of stuff I have to go through that non-transexuals don't have to, and not all of it is coming from haters.

Me ha instado a investigar, saber, razonar, evitar el fanatismo y el dogma, respetar, comprender, intuir, dudar hasta las últimas consecuencias, cuestionar lo cuestionable y lo aparentemente incuestionable. Comprender que hay afortunadamente, millones de seres que, sin saber nada de religión hacen el bien y eso los acerca a Dios. Saber que Dios no es patrimonio de ninguna religión, que todas las religiones tienen errores y aciertos. En los aciertos coincidimos todas, en los errores diferimos. Saber por último que es imposible intentar un acercamiento a una espiritualidad sana, con vanidades, discriminaciones, cerebros lavados, fanatismos, imposiciones, pensando que nuestra creencia es la única que posee la verdad absoluta.

AA11887043	Well, since you can't really "force" people to learn something, I'm saying no you can't make them learn english.  The funny thing is, the US has been the most powerful country in the world for quite some time but that doesn't mean it will be that way forever.  I think it is good for Americans to be learning other languages, as well as the foreigners who come here.|`|231296b9ebdeed24570b8ca6978948c0aa	Yes.  English is the defacto language of this country.  The government should not have to pay the expense of providing documents in numerous languages to accommodate people who do not learn it.  Several people where I work said they would quit their jobs before they would learn Spanish.|`|59aec956b2b714ca63847011aebddb0daa	One has to learn English so that the person can go freely any where in the world. It is the International language spoken almost everywhere in the world. It acts as an umbrella to safeguard one's interests. A decade ago to learn English, you had to attend costly English classes or purchase course material like tapes and books. Now you can learn English for free from the comfort of your home using the Internet. The BBC and the British Council offer a number of on line courses, which teach written and spoken English.  You can also improve your English by watching television programs and reading English newspapers.

So, no, I don't think they should be forced to learn English. I don't think any countries have this sort of requirement and our country, a democracy, wouldn't enforce such a thing. <br>  <br>  I think that people should learn to speak the native language of the country in which they live, however, so eventually, non-speakers should make some effort to learn English. Not learning it is ridiculous but forcing someone to learn is undemocratic.|`|8fae007a92a6579fd2bf351c3b372be2aa	no . but they should not complain that stuff or we talk in English|`|AA11148655	Yes! they need to learn english and we shouldn't have to learn spanish just to get a job!|`|b25809f90c15077093aa440652a575a7aa	Yes!!!!!!!!!!!

Por cierto no la eh leido toda por que si haces algo en eso se llama Fanatismo , por cierto oye la cacion de Ricardo Arjona JESUS ES VERBO NO SUSTANTIVO. no vayas a ser de esos que las leen y son peor que un viejo gru?on y todo lo contrario a lo que dice la Biblia|`|757HsvYjaa	No especificaste si leerla completa. Si la he leido, mas no completa. Una de mis metas en la vida es leerla completa. La primera vez que la lei no recuerdo pues estuve en escuela de religiosas y llevabamos clase de religion. Pero mas bien te puedo responder que cuando la lei en mi adolescencia por gusto, me lleno leerla. Ay muchas cosas que no comprendia o yo me las creia letra por letra y no sabia que eran leguaje figurativo (como el apocalypsis), pero dentro de ella encuntro mucha paz y alimento espiritual. En especial cuando los senitmientos estan que explotan los SALMOS me tranquilizan mucho y animan. Pero si en verdad quieres saberlo, prueba tu y que no te cuenten. Puedes encontrar milagros, respuestas, direccion, paz, o igual puede ser un libro mas muy bien escrito. Si en verdad estas buscando algo en ella, lo encontraras, sigue mirando con Fe y alli esta enfrente de ti lo que buscas...saludos, y animo!!!|`|FGXJbqnXaa	para mi no es una obra literaria como te lo dicen en las universidades <br>      como lector de la biblia me conmociona cuando alguien comenta cituaciones alardeando como si todo lo que ahi dice es una locura <br>  a mi me parece locura que piensen que todo eso solo es ficcion<br>  un catedratico comento que ahi hasta pornografia se encontraba<br>  (por los cantares) creo que basandote en la biblia es la mejor manera de vivir por que bendices a los demas  y te fortaleces a ti mismo|`|da4a8d07309ed10c0e5eea78d9f9f1b7aa	pues la verda a mi me gusto por que toda esta conuna corcondancia barbara, pero aveces dices no manches estan mejores las historietas de hi-man pero aki te tiran una pedradotas, me gustò y no me gusto, prefiero a jaime bayly<br>  pe la verdad mi cap es Genesis y el apocalipsis,.<br>  lo primero que pense fue... cuantos baratos! pero los tengo que respertar...<br>  pero te pone a pensar cosas distintas conforme vas avanzando, hay de todo, relatos buenos y malos, pero al final es lo mismo<br>  "que haces hermano leyendo la biblia todo el dia lo que hay esta escrito se resume en amor vamos ve y practicalo, jesus hermanos mios es vervo no suntantivo"<br>  pin.che arjona pegajoso jajaja|`|cb6ce1ce57a8ace2aba5672ff365084faa	pues que como la palabra de dios deja mucho que desear ya que esta llena de contradicciones, como libro histórico sirve un poco ya que si te cuenta historias de como se vivía en esos tiempos .<br>  pero a ratos es un libro muy aburrido y a ratos muy sanguinario y violento pero en general es interesante descubrir el punto de vista de la gente de hace 5000 anos|`|c1d289372ebf322d58c2d1441bec5ce8aa	Me abstengo,pues no la lei ni la leere,no me interesa.|`|06748c11a6f77617d1f3d90400ea506caa	?Qué mal dicta el personaje ese! o ?Por qué no eligió como transmisores de su mensaje a gente con los oídos limpios?|`|468a0afb7575a848b24cacdf0e931ab3aa	la lei tan peque?o como de 8 a?os, y a esa edad ya las historias entraban en conflicto con las cosas aprendidas, leo desde los 5 a?os y ya habia leido otras cosas que la desmentian. me parecia bonita y todo eso, luego tenia muchas ilustrasiones. todavia la tengop esa biblia mi mama me la regalo, sera por que fui el unico que alguna vez la leyo en mi casa, y el unico ateo, que paradoja, aun la leo , pero nunca ni a mis 8 a?os me la tome como verdad absoluta. siempre me parecio disparatado, es mas eso fue por la epoca de superman 1, jajaj hace un buen tiempo ya, y me era igual de fantasioso.|`|5ea8936bf2e3056f5b1bbb8a5f53b3c8aa	Pues pensé que estaba interesante y quería leerla toda, aunque a ratos me parecía dificil de entender... tenía como 10 a?os.<br>  Desde entonces si llegué a leerla toda, al igual que otros libros considerados sagrados para diferentes culturas, como el Corán, el Baghavad Gita, los Vedas, el Shrimad Vaghavatam, etc.|`|727038d4d32295f04cb465f1cf5ef85faa	wow nunca me lo habian preguntado...<br>  <br>  cuando la termine de leer... nada q m gusto el apocalipsis jaja por ke pos en eso andaba jajaja pero mientras la leia jajaja descubri q se contradice muchas veces y q la iglesia y dios mismo al parecer no estan tan unidos como nos intentan hacer ver...<br>  <br>  ademas q tiene relatos muy bonitos... para ser tomados como cuentos y otros como historia... pero ninguna como realidad absoluta...<br>  <br>  la e leido y es lo ke pienso... espero respetes mi opinion como yo respeto tu iglesia Dios y credo...<br>  <br>  SUERTE Y ALEGRIA!|`|1244eedd96cf5c5d6ac443daf1e18789aa	Honestamente, cuando la leí por primera vez, los primeros libros, en verdad llegué a pensar que era la palabra de un dios.<br>  <br>  Pero eso fué cuando tenía 10 a?os.<br>  <br>  Luego, conforme fuí avanzando en su lectura, me empecé a dar cuenta que ese dios no era tan amoroso como me lo habían contado. De hecho, era algo cruel.<br>  <br>  Después crecí, y tuve contacto con otros libros y otros autores, y me empecé a cuestionar abiertamente si lo que me habían contado sería verdad.<br>  <br>  Y, una vez hube perdido el miedo a castigos impropios de un creador todo amor y misericordia, empecé a abrir los ojos y darme cuenta que ése libro no tenía nada de divino y sí mucho de humano.

No dijo es un bosquejo, improvisen, diganlo como quieran, dijo "digan asi".  El rosario es meditar cada paso o estacion de la vida y pasion de Jesus Cristo, en el se encierra la vida de jesus.  En lucas esta la primera parte del Ave Maria cuando ella visita a su prima Isabel. Y no todo esta escrito en la biblia.  Y en un parte del Magnifical que ella alaba a Dios por haberla escogido como madre de su hijo, hace una profecia:  "Todas las generaciones me llamaran bienaventurada".  Eso significa que en todos los tiempos le iban a tener reconocimiento y veneracion.  Cuando se refiere a vanas repeticiones es cuando uno reza sin pensar, ni meditar en lo que se dice, por eso es vano.|`|ddd8a7b6ef5b8115930b9d184dce1698aa	El rosario fue inventado por la iglesia, para que nuestra abuelitas pudieran reunirse y echarse una cafecito despues del rosario, así no se aburren en sus casas.|`|4ac692cfca3dd1f5ef62ef9f5eeec19aaa	El Rosario nace de la tradición Católica, rescatando las dos oraciones "Biblicas", el Padre Nuestro y el Ave María.<br>  El padre Nuestro repite palabras del mismo Cristo (Mt 6 : 9 - 13) y el Ave María parte con el saludo del Angel Gabriel a María (LC 1:28)<br>  <br>  El sentido del rito es ofrecer un ramo de rosas a la Santísima Virgen, donde cada cuenta es una flor. y a la vez parte de una reflexión sobre los mas importantes momentos de la fe.|`|9a07e4f74cf41aa9a37e836bc79cc92eaa	nop, lo que esse?o esla "forma" de orar a traves del padre nuestro, pero jamas se menciona que tengas que hacer una plegaria de memoria y repetitiva como lo es el rosario, creo que deberiamos platicar mas con Dios que estar repitiendo tantas veces esas frases, con todo respeto por los que lo hacen claro.|`|Fuixk7Etaa	Debemos entender que el Rosario es un método que consiste no sólo en "repitir" sino en asimilar las dos más bellas oraciones que poseemos, Padre Nuestro, que nos recuerda que somos hijos de Dios y el Ave María, que nos recuerda que tenemos una Madre que nos hecha la mano con Jesús, recordemos las bodas de Caná donde Jesús hace su primer milagro porque su madre intercedió por los novios... Además cada bloque o "Misterio" contiene parte de la vida de Jesús que nos ayuda a repasar nuestro caminar como el de Jesús para ser mejor cada día.<br>  "No temas" decía el Papa Juan Pablo II, no te dejes confundir por aquellos que tratan de destruir lo que no comprenden.<br>  Parafraseando lo que decía San Agustín, "habla para que conozcan, conociendo amen y amando sigan" no se trata de repetir como "pericos" aunque algunos así lo hagan, tiene la finalidad de preparar la mente y el espíritu para imitar la vida de Jesús.|`|Zv0MSRRpaa	Te cuento que JESúS ense?o el padre nuestro, por requerimiento de sus apóstoles, nunca ense?o reusarle a la virgen MARíA , en una aparición ( en 1938 POLONIA ) JESúS, ense?o entre otros el reos a la DIVINA MISERICORDIA el cual quedo instaurado por la iglesia católica,en el rosario de la divina MISERICORDIA se instaura la repetición, la misma cumple la función de retrotraer el alma concentrándose en el reos , solamente se obtiene en la repetición de la oración,nada mas; en las religiones antiguas de oriente vemos que pasa lo mismo por ejemplo la andinismo o en el budismo.|`|a9708c7a5630a2fba41486696a626ad1aa	Jesucristo nos puso el ejemplo de rezar así.<br>  <br>  Es falso que la Biblia prohiba repetir palabras en la oración. Cuando en el Evangelio de San Mateo Jesús dice que no se hable tanto en la oración, en ese mismo versículo aclara que se refiere a los paganos que creen que por hacer tanta palabrería van a ser escuchados.<br>  <br>   <br>  <br>  El rechazo no es a "repetir palabras" sino al hacerlo sin sentido interior y profundo como lo haría un pagano.<br>  <br>   <br>  <br>  Si alguien te dijo eso, sería muy bueno que le dijeras que el mismo Se?or Jesucristo nos puso el ejemplo al rezar ‘repitiendo palabras’.<br>  <br>  Esto fue lo que sucedió. Era uno de los momentos más importantes en la vida de Nuestro Se?or Jesucristo, pues él sabía que había llegado la hora de entregarse para salvación del hombre. Es la oración del Huerto de Getsemaní. ?Cómo fue su oración? Veamos lo que la Biblia nos dice:<br>  <br>   <br>  <br>  "Se alejó de nuevo a orar, repitiendo las mismas palabras"<br>  <br>  Mc 14,39<br>  <br>   <br>  <br>  Si Jesucristo oró "repitiendo las mismas palabras" entonces también nosotros lo podemos hacer. A menos que el protestante diga que también Jesucristo hizo mal al hacerlo así. Aunque usted no lo crea, algunos serán capaces de decir eso con tal de no reconocer su error.<br>  <br>   <br>  <br>  2.- Los Salmos tienen oraciones repetitivas.<br>  <br>  Al parecer muchos hermanos protestantes no han leído atentamente la palabra de Dios, pues en ella encontramos que varios salmos de la Biblia son oraciones que tienen partes que se van repitiendo cada dos o tres versículos. Eso era algo muy común en la Biblia. Por ejemplo:<br>  <br>   <br>  <br>  El salmo 29 Repite: "Voz de Yahvé".<br>  <br>  El salmo 46 Repite: "Con nosotros Yahvé rey de los ejércitos".<br>  <br>  El salmo 80 Repite: "Oh Dios haznos volver".<br>  <br>  El salmo 107 Repite: "Den gracias a Yahvé".<br>  <br>   <br>  <br>  3.- Por supuesto que el Rosario es una oración bíblica.<br>  <br>  *En el Rosario "repetimos palabras" así como Jesús lo hizo. Mc 14,39<br>  <br>  *El Padre Nuestro está en la Biblia. Mt 6,9-13<br>  <br>  * Gran parte del Ave María está en la Biblia. Lc 1,28-55: Jn 2,1-11<br>  <br>  *El Gloria (Alabanza trinitaria) está en la Biblia 2 Cor 13,13-14<br>  <br>   <br>  <br>  *Los 'misterios' del Rosario en su mayoría son pasajes bíblicos:<br>  <br>   <br>  <br>  Misterios gozosos:<br>  <br>  Primer misterio: La Encarnación del Hijo de Dios Lc 1,26-38<br>  <br>  Segundo misterio: La Visita de María a Isabel Lc 1,39-45<br>  <br>  Tercer misterio: El nacimiento de Jesús Lc 2,1-7<br>  <br>  Cuarto misterio: La Presentación del ni?o Jesús Lc 2,22-34<br>  <br>  Quinto misterio: Perdido y hallado en el templo Lc 2,41ss<br>  <br>   <br>  <br>  Misterios Dolorosos:<br>  <br>  Primer misterio:La oración de Jesús en el Huerto Mc 14,32-38<br>  <br>  Segundo misterio: La Flagelación de Jesús Mc 15,15<br>  <br>  Tercer misterio: La Coronación de espinas Mc 15,16-19<br>  <br>  Cuarto misterio: Jesús con la Cruz a cuestas Mc 15,21-22<br>  <br>  Quinto misterio:Crucifixión y muerte de Jesús Jn 19,18-30<br>  <br>   <br>  <br>  Misterios gloriosos:<br>  <br>  Primer misterio: La resurrección de Jesucristo Mt 28,1-6<br>  <br>  Segundo misterio: La Ascención de Jesús Mc 16,19-20<br>  <br>  Tercer misterio: La Venida del Espíritu Santo Hech 2,1-4<br>  <br>  Cuarto misterio:La Asunción de María Cant 6,10<br>  <br>  Quinto misterio:La coronación de María Ap 12,1ss<br>  <br>   <br>  <br>   Misterios de la Luz <br>  <br>  Primer Misterio: Su Bautismo en el Jordán Mc 1,9-10 <br>  <br>  Segundo Misterio: La autorrevelación en las bodas de Caná  Jn 2,1-11 <br>  <br>  Tercer Misterio: El anuncio del Reino de Dios invitando a la conversión Mc 1,15 <br>  <br>  Cuarto Misterio: La Transfiguración  Mc 9,2-8 <br>  <br>  Quinto Misterio: La Institución de la Eucaristía.

In the same passage, it says that women are unclean seven days before and after menstruation, and that during menstruation, they cannot be seen by men. (Something they don't tell you in the tampon ads)<br>  <br>  It also says that for your sins to be forgiven, you have to sacrifice some of your meat and grain. It also tells you what type of birds to sacrifice for different sins, ranging from hawks to pidgeons.<br>  <br>  It also says it is a sin to wear garments made of more than tow manmade materials, and that it is a sin to eat shell fish....<br>  <br>  Basically, that means you can never ever take your girlfriend out to a seafood restaraunt in a lambswool suit with silk lining while she's menstruating, wihout savrificing one of your calves and wheat, and possibly an eagle.<br>  <br>  The above example sounds silly, but it's all in the book of leviticus!<br>  <br>  I'm not gay, but i think it is extremely hypocritical of some christians to condemn their fellow man, and treat them with such disregard when Jesus told them all to love eachother.

Dios lo es todo y lo llena todo. Llamamos diablo a aquello que consideramos "opuesto" a Dios, cuando entendemos que Dios sólo es bondad y amor. Pero el mal o demonio o diablo, permite descubrir y distinguir lo que es bueno, en ese sentido es complementario y no opuesto. Es como el espejo que permite reflejar lo verdadero, lo auténtico. Cuando haces el bien estás expresando la existencia de Dios en tí y a través de tí a los demás y  cuando haces el "mal" reflejas igualmente el "no Dios" en tí y a través de ti. Podrías descubrir tu bondad sin tu "maldad" para comparar y elegir qué prefieres? en ese movimiento se vive a Dios.

The essence of every soul (atman) being the same as God Almighty... every soul is but a minuscule God in its entity.<br>  <br>  The moment the big bang occurs... all souls (atmans) existing in the Cosmos spread all over the cosmos with unimaginable speeds. The magnitude and the scale of the big bang are beyond the comprehension of the human beings to visualize. Nothing that exists in the cosmos in energy form can be visualized by the help of the senses and the mind.<br>  <br>  This explosion of the big bang results in creation of a new cosmos... a new beginning! After billions of years when some planets become suitable for giving birth to life... the souls start manifesting body after another. And a planet like Mother Earth is born.<br>  <br>  Now... what is this big bang theory! The big bang occurs in what! As has been defined above... the definition of God is, "the sum total of all purified souls atmans in the cosmos at a given point of time is what we know as God Almighty".<br>  <br>  This cluster of pure energy we know as God accumulates in its absolute pure state only when the dissolution of the Cosmos occurs in its entirety. It is as if a huge cauldron of fire... a massive black hole has reduced the whole of the Cosmos to the size of half a thumb. It is this stage when every single soul atman in the Cosmos in whatever stage of life it may be liberates after gaining enlightenment and salvation. There is just no escape for the collapse of the whole of Cosmos has occurred.<br>  <br>  As has been expressed by Mahavira, the 24th Tirthankara of Jainism that souls atmans in whatever stage of life they may be... continue their journey into the next Cosmos exactly from the point where they stood in the earlier manifestation is totally wrong. This is where the teachings of Jainism are flawed.<br>  <br>  Bhagavad Gita... the sacred doctrine of Lord Krishna distinctly clarifies this point. And it is logical that when the collapse of the entire cosmos occurs... the question of souls remaining in their position as such and transitioning into the next Cosmos after the big bang occurs is but a flawed parable that defies all reasoning and logic.<br>  <br>  The point of difference where Mahavira went wrong in understanding the teachings of Bhagavad Gita! The reason why Jainism branched into a new thinking pattern as advocated and doctored by Bhagwan Mahavira (the 24th and last Tirthankara of Jainism) is evidenced here.<br>  <br>  <br>  This cluster of pure energy... the sum total of all purified atmans in the Cosmos equals half the size of a thumb as has been clearly spelt out in the Bhagavad Gita... the most sacred doctrine put forward by Lord Krishna in the battlefield of Mahabharata.<br>  <br>  Unable to contain itself for long... this enormous source of pure energy explodes with a big bang giving birth to a new cosmos... a new journey! God Almighty is the source and the cause of the big bang. This theory of creationism is unpalatable by Scientists all over the world. Why? Science demands proofs and in the kingdom of God... it is absolute faith (in the system of God) that rules.

SOme of the ridiculous answers!<br>  <br>  OK. First of all it depends on what you believe, personally, being a Catholic and also not a total idiot and blind to fact, I know that evolution is real. Now, you can say that evolution is merely a tool of God, that is fine. That is not at odds with religious teaching that God created everything. In fact, some people say that evolution is so amazingly intricate that somthing like God must be behind it.<br>  <br>  There is no "why" as to the evlution of viruses. Basically, about 4 billion years ago, different molecues started randomly forming chains of proteins called amino acids. Over time, applying the Darwinian maxim of survival of the fittest, the best and strongest chains of these amino acids survived. Eventually, through random occurances, these simple molecules discovered how to replicate themselves by combining in different ways to form RNA. (DNA is a further evolved version of RNA)<br>  <br>  Viruses don't have DNA, they have RNA. The reason for this is that Viruses are one of the most ancient lifeforms on Earth. We have a common anscestor with viruses.<br>  <br>  Viruses evolved from these chains of amino acids called RNA. the chemical constituents of RNA caused chemical reactions which created a thin sheath of protein around the virus to protect the RNA inside.<br>  <br>  How viruses used to work, was that they would attack a bacterium, and inject the RNA into the bacterium. The RNA from the virus would reprogramme the Bacterium cell and tell it to produce more bacteria RNA, very like a modern computer virus.<br>  <br>  Viruses aren't always bad, just like bacteria can be quite helpful. Not all viruses affect humans at all, and many only affect harmful species. WIthout viruses the populations of many species would be uncontrollable, and the ecosystem would have crashed a long time ago.<br>  <br>  Whether or not you choose to beleive in evolution however, is a matter for yourself. I think you can believe in evolution and God at the same time... The catholic church does.|`|59a64fe40032f3604405b5ccc5332870aa	God made all..in the beginging|`|PXVU4foTaa	Its the Devil. The Devils Job is to kill steal and destroy. 1/3 of the angels(now known as demons) were kicked out of heaven with satan. sickness is the work of satan and his demons. Check out where in the Bible Jesus cast out a devil and the person was healed. Drugs are not the answer. Jesus is the anser for ALL healing. Why? sickness is a Spiritual problem affecting the Body. So when you name a sickness or disease there is a devil behind it driving it. Drugs? well they are just devils to....one devil goes in and shakes hands with the other devil in agreement to do something that will result in the mutual destroying of the body. So how do you win? By the Blood of Jesus. By Jesus stripes you are healed. There is only one way that healing was ever given as to a set of instructions to get it as in deailing with other people(not going to the hospital). And that was to call the elders of the church and have them pray. Its by trusting Jesus and Him alone that you should be getting healing and being set free from any virus or sickness.

Poor poor you!!!|`|f0356b2da1def71b56dea6c821b518d8aa	cant judge a book by its cover.....i guess you'll  have to learn the hard way!|`|394dcdc220130ee48545cadcb037d2adaa	First of all, I don't like you already and I am nor fat nor from a trailer park. I was the Captain of my cheer-leading squad on Varsity for my last two years of High School and some of our squad was just like you "stuck on you" and I feel that is only because you had low self esteem from the go and you joined the squad to make yourself feel like your better then the rest but the truth and listen to me good, is once you leave school or graduate you are just like that fat girl your talking about, just a regular old person. So get off the Lilly white horse your on and get back to reality. Cheerleaders are suppose to represent the school in a respectful manor NOT like they are better then their student body.  I think you need a reality Check, Honey and then once you wake up from dreamland, then smack some sense into the rest of your cheerleading squad!!!|`|f5116c5ed9692a2428c8dbf5c7306809aa	you sound puuuurty stuck up to me.|`|f81662aa70ae680b7008a9d3215b8b29aa	I don't want to be cruel, but the way you stated your question makes you seem very stuck up. I imagine people do think YOU are stuck up because you put of an air, just over the internet, that you think you are better than others. I imagine if you talked to whatever girls you feel are jealous (I mean talk to them nicely and not rudely or AT them) they might feel differently about you. I was not one of the popular girls in my school. I mostly hung out with the "outcasts" yet one of the two best friends I had in high school was the Varsity Cheerleading Captain. Why? Because she didn't assume anything about me, we talked and found we could both be weird and quirky and funny about the same things. We had a blast because of it. <br>  <br>  You are judging people just like you supposedly don't want them to do and it's a shame because I imagine both sides could find some pretty amazing friendships if they gave it try. Also, what does being fat or being from a trailer park or god forbid (heavy sarcasm) an apartment have to do with being a good person or a good friend? Get your priorities straight. You might need one of those people one day. Remember, they can move or lose weight or get plastic surgery but being a jerky ****** is a personality disorder and that's not easily fixed.|`|fbdad2836b12a55aac5a35bcb551f09caa	Since my daughter is a cheerleader, I feel qualified to answer.<br>  <br>  In her school, when in uniform, they cannot talk to guys and have to be careful of who they talk with. So it can lead to an impression that they are snobs.<br>  <br>  Secondly, this comment by you: "I often notice that fat girls don't seem to like cheerleaders. I think because they look up to us, so they are sort of jealous of us too, and plus those type of people are usually from trailer parks, or apartment buildings so I could understand what type of environment they've been raised in to be hateful towards good citizens" <br>  <br>  That above comment sounds pretty stuck up like you are better than them. So, while you may not mean it that way, please be careful about treating them like they are lesser people than you. If you treat a "fat person" as a friend, instead of as a "poor trailer park, apartment" person, you might get them to feel better about you and realize that they are pretty nice people as well.|`|3cef5c25f07a9f771d369acce0cc37a1aa	Because the majority are. Very few like you are actually nice to people that arent in their little clique.

AA11948275	Imaginémonos la reacción de Jonás cuando se le encomendó la misión especial de salir de su país de origen e ir a Asiria a predicar a los habitantes de Nínive, gentes con una religión y cultura distinta a la suya. Es posible que ni siquiera supiera el idioma de los ninivitas o, al menos, que no lo hablara con fluidez. Sea como fuere, por lo visto le pareció una tarea demasiado difícil y huyó ...<br>  Está claro que Jonás tenía que aprender que Dios no se fija solo en las apariencias, sino que examina el corazón... eso le remoldio y sabia que habia sido un tonto, y no queria derramar sangre inocente por su torpeza, asi que pacatum!!! Tras salvar milagrosamente al profeta de morir ahogado, Dios le mandó por segunda vez que predicara a los habitantes de Nínive. Jonás obedeció y, gracias a ello, los ninivitas se arrepintieron en masa|`|0dec5e1b14d8d3c82bc627b86a294dfeaa	porque se habia tomado una chelas y andaba de party|`|1244eedd96cf5c5d6ac443daf1e18789aa	Porque en el mar la vida es más sabrosa.<br>  <br>  Y, en el mar, te quiero mucho más.<br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  Pero no pensemos...?mejor alabemos al Se?or!|`|462e6d51c98e52db013924ee4ddc013aaa	Ni?a ni?a jonas no se avento lo aventaron pork el barko en k iva estaba por hundirse por kulpa de el k se eskondia de Dios y no keria obedecer asi k ya sabessss|`|80344986eddffa1c55cfb44562db205faa	Le hicieron creer que sabia nadar.......|`|ac26c7373a4494094c7a598e5cbd818faa	Creo que a sacarle una muela a la ballena jejejejeje fue un chiste.|`|d4f56b2185c0ca4282cb18f30281e57faa	El libro da cuenta del profeta Jonás y una historia en la cual Yahveh manda a Jonás predicar al pueblo de Nínive, la capital de Asiria para persuadirlos de arrepentirse de su maldad o si no su ciudad quedara destruida. Jonás se negó a obedecer y al principio trataba huir de la presencia de Yahveh y se embarco rumbo a Tarsis, pero en el camino Dios preparó una tempestad y los tripulantes al saber que huía de Yahveh lo echan al mar en medio de la tempestad. Jonás 1<br>  <br>  Yavhé preparó un gran pez que se tragara a Jonás. Después de tres días en vientre del pez, Jonás oró durante ese periodo de tiempo, luego del cual Yahveh dio la orden de que el pez vomitara a Jonás.|`|f4c5279cd83f29a8222f19a8dcb6342baa	quien es jonas?|`|62b1e16b5ad44b03bdb9f12750e4a49caa	Porque era un suicida.... y ademas quiso imitar a Charly Garcia, pero le salio mal....!|`|70c395efe0ace85e7356df2c20342e03aa	Creo que lo mas seguro es que....

Jonás no quería cumplir esa orden porque sabía que esa ciudad se iba a convertir en enemiga en el futuro, así que decidió huir. Pensó que podía esconderse de su misión y no cumplir la orden. Se fue en un barco y Dios mandó tormentas. El barco se estaba hundiendo y Jonás no rezaba, la tripulación  intentó hacerlo recapacitar pero el no quiso así q lo tiraron al mar y se lo tragó la ballena, o pez grande, depende la traducción.|`|13ff102ff3ec66c3af37068b45fc72a5aa	pasa que se le callo su sortija favorita al mar y la quiso ir a buscar,|`|f692f03c9172f0cde7fa7a13b78df592aa	No se avento, lo aventaron, que es distinto, y no para banyarlo sino para que diosito con su amor entranyable por los hombres, no fuera a hundir el barco en el que iba, y en base a su persuacion tranquila y amorosa hizo que "algo" que llamaron ballena se lo tragara,para que cumpliera las ordenes persuasivas de su amorosisimo dios, de destruir ninive, si no se ponian las pilas.( asi por la buena si)|`|a079decbcef2b3ac5edbe260d4c4af00aa	por wey|`|d1307b6bfb6f71c93003a99d5b224edfaa	Porque le dijeron que Jacques Cousteau en la cama era una fiera|`|f373e320b824dd3630fab62a8a3b809aaa	Jonas lo mandaron a una misión difícil, creo que era tímido, sintió calor y se metió al mar.

f14e7634a2f2cb52ab80310b78f8411caa	From my experience working within the gay community, the 'average age' for a first relationship is in the teens/early twenties, anywhere from 15-20. (this does not reflect the whole of the gay population, some people don't come out and have relationships until much later in life). <br>  <br>   As for virginity, I don't think gay and lesbian people lose their virginity any earlier or later than heterosexuals. It depends on what we're classifying as 'virginity', since the definition involves penetration of a vagina by a penis. That's a pretty inaccurate description when dealing with gay and lesbian people. <br>  <br>      I think there's lots of sexual activity going on between gay and straight couples, it's just a matter of 'degree' (how serious it gets, how far it goes), and that varies from person to person.|`|90adc70d307e2ea672c98adbedad7186aa	probably 10-12 and u'll never know cause they are just cerious about there body|`|63172e4104fe328bbd388b6ab03fc2e5aa	The average age is like 15.

This is a common way for the underlying nature of things to work: (Male, Female, A-sexual/androgynous)<br>  Just as there is good, evil, and pure neutral. <br>  I think an easily observed example of evil is willfully causing imbalance in the world around you.<br>  <br>  For instance, you walk down an alley way and witness a man mugging a defenseless individual.<br>  It's would obviously be an evil deed to join the attacker and claim part of the prize.<br>  And it would be deemed sainlty to come to the rescue and save the indiidual, as the odds are already not in his favor.<br>  And what is (some will debate) the ultimately neutral action, to simply walk by and let things play out as they will.<br>  <br>  Yet circumstance can cause things to become ambiguous.<br>  What if it were instead a small malnourished child attempting to pickpocket a wallet from an obviously wealthy person who wouldnt miss the money?<br>  <br>  In situations such as this, I believe the only sin is betraying your own standards.<br>  Just as the thief may have many reasons for stealing, some good, some bad; a person may also have many reasons for believing one way or another.<br>  It's almost like playing with scales, one may commit an atrocious deed, as long as the reprecussions of the action are positive enough to rationalize the deed.<br>  Killing for the sake of bloodlust is evil, but killling to save thousands of lives is noble and righteous.<br>  <br>  It's a difficult question, and I would say that their is a definite good, evil, and/or neutral in ANY situtation. It's just never exactly the same for each person due to different responsibilities created by each indivduals outlook.<br>  <br>  I myself would ask the question, "Can a person sin with good intent?"|`|93cc9f2a3bf1bdc4ad08585fbad388b8aa	They are written in black and white, and man cannot change His laws.

My bros' wife is Japanese and her culture is that she has to show that she can handle her home without help and my bro and i try to tell her that he can help but she insists so we respect that.

The time it takes to learn depends on how fluent you want to be.<br>  <br>  For me, I just want to be able to communicate on a reasonable level with my Russian friends and family, so I predict it will take about 3 or 4 years for this.<br>  <br>  <br>  You are still young so your brain probably absorbs information more quickly than mine :)<br>  <br>  You can get a feel for the language at my website:<br>  <br>  <a href="http://listen2russian.com/" rel="nofollow">http://listen2russian.com/</a><br>  <br>  Hope that helps!<br>  <br>  Jon.|`|7a6604824a0ed8a2440027c73aa27126aa	Russian is a very difficult language, different people learn at different paces so there is really no way of knowing how long it will take you to learn it.|`|6dad9b5e7221a226fb3e4e9e3674f68aaa	It does depend on your commitment to it. Self teaching is very hard, but possible. You need so submerse yourself in the language, books (even kids books), movies, music, etc. This will help. The grammar is very difficult,but not impossible. Fluency is very high and hard. There's no such thing as passable fluency. Conversational Russian is possible, if you're committed to it in a year or two. If you want to read it and or write well in it, it will take longer. But, then, in our native language, we speak it for a good 3-5 years before we begin to learn to read or write, so don't feel like you have to do it all at once.<br>  <br>  My dad also speaks fluent Russian and one of my life regrets is not letting him teach me to at least speak it.

Then your interest will gradually wane until you just kind of forget about it,  while retaining your interest in Russia in general.<br>  <br>  If that doesn't happen, it would take you 10 years to speak it with any degree of confidence, and it will be 15 years before you can read Dostoyevsky.

Good luck and keep practicing.|`|fe3cdedf7a44a6f360a6578117cd1791aa	Well, since your family speaks it, you will learn faster than others, but depending on your commitment it could take you anywhere form 1 year to 5 years.|`|dbccc4e0e9819d49ed454a33c8c133dfaa	If you put a lot of effort in, and talked to your dad and uncle in Russian, you could probably become passably fluent in 2 years.<br>  <br>  If you stayed in Russia for 3 months, you could perhaps do it within 1 year (become passably fluent, that is, not very good).

e0923b3029ebee27added534d3d954f2aa	There is no clear cut answer to that.  However, it wouldn't have been possible if it weren't for the human ability to reason, to know ourselves.  We are the first animal that has had the ability for the vast understanding of time and space.  Thusly we all know we are going to die someday, it is inevitable.  From this knowledge came anxiety of our impending doom.  From this anxiety rose an explanation for all that is around us and also a reason to believe that we are not ultimately going to die:  religion.  Ever since recorded human history there has been some form of religion.  It helps us cope with our mortality and ultimately, despite some very good efforts, breeds hate and prejudice.<br>  <br>  Like I said, there is no clear cut answer.

The "Star Wars" movie series also explains it all pretty good.  Also the movie "A Field of Dreams" and the movie "Lost Horizon" (either version) explain it all pretty well.  I hear that the Narnia Chronicles movie also explains it very well too.

Que ya está bien de ir molestando todo el día como resentidos porque otros tenga otros creeres.<br>  <br>  Otra cosa "como las bestias brutas se revuelcan". Me ha llamado la anteción la frase. Dios creo a todas las bestias y las hizo bien digo yo, pues no les puso inteligencia, alma, etc.. .como le querais llamar, tal como les concedió a las personas. Por lo tanto, las bestias no tienen el privilegio de elegir que hacer con su vida, han de vivir la vida para la que Dios las creo. Entonces si se revuelcan por algo serán, ?no?.<br>  <br>   Por ejemplo: <br>  El cerdo se revuelca en el fango para obtener una capa de barro sobre su cuerpo que a la vez le proteje del Sol y les refresca la piel, lo hacen por su bien. Pero parace que no esta bien, pues si Dios critica la actitud de unos animales que él creo, sin libertad de elección, porque se quieren protejer del Sol, que Dios creo, y les quema ?qué deben de hacer los pobres cerdos? En mi opinión es muy digno que las bestias se revuelquen, es por su salud. Lo que ocurre que Dios nos salió muy delicado y escrupuloso, "uys, se revuelcan, que asco"... y no le gusta. <br>  <br>  Haber hecho las cosas mejor, so patán. Lo siento, pero es que este Dios me enerva. Más le valdría no existir que ser tan malo (en el sentido de patético), seguro que el carné de dios le tocó en una tombola.<br>  <br>  Bueno, lo dejo, que me están entrando ganas de revolcarme con alguna incredula... Dios, macho, please, no mires, que se que no te gusta. Lo digo por tú bien que luego te pones tontorrón y dices cosas muy fuera de lugar que tus credulos se tragan a pies juntillas.

"La afirmación de que la tumba (de Jesús) ha sido encontrada no está basada en ninguna prueba y es solo una maniobra para vender", Kloner agregó. <br>  <br>  El arqueólogo israelí recordó que 11 a?os atrás, la BBC de Londres ya había producido un documental similar con el mismo argumento; y se?aló que la nueva producción de Discovery era meramente un renovado intento de crear controversia en el mundo cristiano con el fin de obtener mayores ganancias. <br>  <br>  "Refuto todas sus afirmaciones y esfuerzos por llamar la atención sobre los descubrimientos. Con todo respeto, no son arqueólogos", dijo Kloner. <br>  <br>  Kloner explicó que los nombres inscritos en las tumbas eran muy comunes en la era del Segundo templo, y por tanto, son absolutamente insuficientes como argumentos para concluir que esa era la tumba de Jesús y de su familia. Explicó además que la inscripción "Jesús hijo de José" ha sido encontrada en muchas otras tumbas en Jerusalén. <br>  <br>  "Es muy poco probable que Jesús y sus parientes tuvieran una tumba familiar", explicó Kloner. "Ellos eran una familia de Galilea sin vínculos en Jerusalén. La tumba de Talpiot perteneció en cambio a una familia de clase media del primer siglo de nuestra era".|`|57d437afb46d610922028c8f659ffe67aa	Nada. No importa. Siempre ha habido gente que intenta derribar a Dios y su Hijo, pero nunca lo lograrán por la sencilla razón de que Dios es el creador y tiene todo bajo control.

Hay una parte del Corán, en donde se reglamenta la vida de los "servidores de Dios", luego se reglamenta las leyes de la Guerra, esto se debe a que en ese período determinado, Mahoma había sido desterrado ya de la Mecca (Lugar en donde nació) y se encontraba en Medina en donde era reconocido como un gran profeta y tuvo cierto poder, entonces quiso reglamentar las acciones legales y militares de aquella ciudad, justo cuando la Mecca y Medina tuvieron una batalla. <br>  <br>  la parte del Corán que deseas se encuentra en los últimos cantos y dice algo así como defenderse de los no creyentes o cosas así.

En las relaciones humanas, cualidades como la bondad, la virtud, la honestidad y la fraternidad -por citar ejemplos- son muy estimadas: quienes posean esas cualidades serán considerados "mejores" que quienes carezcan de ellas. Pero, hay personas que no tienen religión y sin embargo son buenas. Por otro lado, hay religiosos que por su fanatismo son capaces de cometer atrocidades.  Ninguna religión está libre de hipocresías y falsedades. <br>  <br>  Por ultimo, los religiosos acaso serán "buenos" porque su dios se lo ordena; los no religiosos, si son "buenos"  será unica y exclusivamente porque a traves de un razonamiento directo, claro y coherente han decidido adoptar esa actitud. En este caso, el valor etico y moral es superior al que le pudiera corresponder al "creyente" por solo obedecer a su dios por miedo al castigo.|`|8f17ba161e9c22966a3e4858800fadd9aa	NO LO HACE NI MEJOR NI PEOR,, SINO  UNA PERSONA DE LIBRE PENSAMIENTO|`|1ff1ffc7ceeb477a35f58b5178696d8baa	no!!!<br>  <br>  creo q ser antireligioso no te hace mejor persona...<br>  <br>  solo si te culturizas y aprendes mucho de la vida te haces buena persona...<br>  si aprendes lo basico de la capazidad del ser humano etica, moral, etc<br>  eso de ser anti-religioso o religioso es solo para distraerte.<br>  <br>  xaooooo!|`|a7e71056eaab649e303fe85460a10a38aa	Así es, dos rectas paralelas JAMáS SE TOCAN..., si no, serían convergentes...<br>  <br>  Y ser antirreligioso tal vez no te haga una persona mejor (según el concepto de las "crédulas ovejitas") pero al menos eres más libre y puedes razonar mejor y obtener conocimientos sin prejuicios o sin pasarlos por el estrechísimo tamiz de un conjunto de fábulas arcaicas y retrógradas.|`|f692f03c9172f0cde7fa7a13b78df592aa	No, simplemente nos hace personas libres.|`|1c82dd8009a9b63556d6a8b2b006c2d1aa	Bueno, en parte estoy contigo, pero te voy a explicar por que:<br>  Cuando Dios en forma de hombre (Jesus) vino al mundo, no vino a establecer una religion, el vino a salvar al hombre de su error, de sus malas desiciones de su errada manera de pensar.<br>  Hoy en dia la gente piensa que estar cerca de Dios o vivir para el es ser religioso y esa no es la palabra correcta para ello.<br>  Te explico, <br>  Religioso es todo aquel que sigue un dogma que fue establecido por un hombre o por una cultura (budistas/mahometanos/indues/druidas/etc... todo estos son religiones, pero como te trato de explicar la religion no lleva a Dios sino el creer en el, y no digo creer en el sentido de pensar si no en el sentido de vivir.<br>  Ser cristiano no significa ser marciano o extraterrestre o what ever le quieras llamar.<br>  El que sigue el camino de Dios es una persona comun y corriente a diferencia de que su vida es diferente a la de los demas en el sentido de que Dios te da el poder de saber verdaderamente lo que esta mal y lo que esta bien para asi poder llevar mejor tu vida y te da una mente nueva, tus pensamientos no son iguales a los demas pues el que no conoce a Dios o no tiene a Dios en su vida se cree todo lo que le dicen.

AA11412999	Over 21...check.  Married...check.  Story to share?  Mmm...nah, sorry.  We don't kiss and tell.  And weird experiences...well weird compared with what?  Weird is a very relative term.  Lots of people say we're downright bizarre for even considering sharing our spouses.  From our perspective, the mainstream's version of "normalcy" seems very skewed to us.  Jealousy just makes no sense to us anymore, and we can't understand how/why people still choose to live with it.<br>  <br>  I guess that's really the best thing about swinging: we no longer have to guess at our partner's faithfulness.  We KNOW where their loyalty lies.  Other women may have been given the privelege of enjoying my husband's sexual attentions, and he theirs, but in the end we've realized that sex is not what holds our marriage together.  Until we proved that to ourselves in this way, we would always wonder what would become of us if the "worst" was to happen.  The worst thing imaginable, of course, would have been one of us having sex with someone else.  So...now that that's happened and the sky didn't fall and we weren't struck dead with a bolt of lightning...and our marriage didn't disintegrate the way we've been told would happen...now we don't have to wonder anymore.  Now we see what really DOES hold us together, and it's a lot more permanent and unshakeable than sex.  If we relied on sexual exclusivity to hold us together, there would always be a way for someone OUTSIDE of our relationship to come between us.  But now, because that time bomb has been defused, nothng can come between us anymore.  No one else will ever have the power to hurt our marriage...unless one of us allows them to.  It can only be broken from the inside out.<br>  <br>  Being a logical person who thinks in absolutes, I'm just not sure I could ever really be at peace with a marriage where there was even an iota of doubt.  And not being certain is the same thing as doubt in my mind.  But we've discovered that this works, and the truth has been self-evident.  <br>  <br>  It's not nearly as simple as the nay-sayers would lead you to believe.  There's way more to the story, if you care to find out.  Check out the website below.  If you're fascinated by the swinger's lifestyle, you'll quickly become addicted and can easily spend days with your face glued to the screen.  Everything under the sun has been discussed here at least twice.  AMAZING resource for anyone interested in marriage improvement.  The board has its share of non-swinging "French Vanillas".  Otherwise known as monogamists who have considered swinging but decided that monogamy was a better fit for their marriage.  This is fully supported there.  No monogamy bashing. :)  Just a great little community.|`|90adc70d307e2ea672c98adbedad7186aa	I am swinger when it comes to women|`|c71353775e735c9f208fdf17cb7b796daa	Monica and I are all for it!!!..........signed, Bill C.|`|6c4acae1af4f9fbc02be7ea19029dc7caa	how can we see a picture of Monica???|`|77622be92ab404409f818db551a4987aaa	Yes, we are.

(See 10:37-38) Some modern Western historians have concluded that Muhammad was sincere in his statement of receiving revelation, "for this alone makes credible the development of a great religion." [24] Modern historians generally decline to address the further question of whether the messages Muhammad reported being revealed to him were from "his unconscious, the collective unconscious functioning in him, or from some divine source", but they acknowledge that the material came from "beyond his conscious mind" [24].<br>  <br>  Muhammad is reported to have mysterious seizures at the moments of inspiration. Welch, a scholar of Islamic studies, in Encyclopedia of Islam states that the graphic descriptions of Muhammad's condition at these moments may be regarded as genuine, since they are unlikely to have been invented by later Muslims. According to Welch, these seizures should have been the most convincing evidence for the superhuman origin of Muhammad's inspirations for people around him. Muhammad's enemies however accused him as one possessed, a soothsayer, or a magician since these experiences made an impression similar to those soothsayer figures well known in ancient Arabia. Welch states it remains uncertain whether Muhammad had such experiences before he began to see himself as a prophet and if so how long did he have such experiences. [25]<br>  <br>  Some non-Muslims say that the Qur'ān originated and derived from the Bible. Although the Qur'ān itself confirms the similarity between it and the former books (the Torah and the Gospel)3:3, it tells that:<br>  <br>  "We know indeed that they say, "It is a man that teaches him." The tongue of him they wickedly point to is notably foreign, while this is Arabic, pure and clear. 16:103"<br>  <br>  The Qur'ān attributes this similarity to their unique origin and says all of them have been revealed by the God.2:285 Based on Islamic traditions and legends, it is generally believed that Muhammad could neither read nor write, but would simply recite what was revealed to him for his companions to write down and memorize. According to the Qur'ān<br>  <br>  "And thou wast not (able) to recite a Book before this (Book came), nor art thou (able) to transcribe it with thy right hand: In that case, indeed, would the talkers of vanities have doubted.29:48 " "Say: "If Allah had so willed, I should not have rehearsed it to you, nor would He have made it known to you. A whole life-time before this have I tarried amongst you: will ye not then understand?"10:16 "<br>  <br>  However some scholars - (Christoph Luxenberg, Maxime Rodinson, William Montgomery Watt, etc.) - have argued that the claim that Muhammad was not able to read and write at all is based on weak traditions and that, in regard of many aspects concerning Muhammad's biography and teachings, it is not convincing:<br>  <br>  "The Meccans were in general familiar with reading and writing. A certain amount of writing would be necessary for commercial purposes ... In view of this familiarity with writing among the Meccans particularly, both for records and for religious scriptures, there is a presumption that Muhammad knew at least enough to keep commercial records ... The probability is that Muhammad was able to read and write sufficiently for business purposes, but it seems certain that he had not read any [religious] scriptures." - W. Montgomery Watt in "Muhammad's Mecca"[26]<br>  <br>  "Whatever Arabic tradition may have assumed from a wrong interpretation of a word in the Koran, it seems certain that Muhammad learned to read and write. But except for a few vague and unreliable pointers in his life and work we have no way of knowing the extent of his learning." - M. Rodinson in "Mohammed"[27]<br>  <br>  Adherents to Islam hold that the wording of the Qur'anic text available today corresponds exactly to that revealed to Muhammad himself: words of God said to be delivered to Muhammad through the angel Gabriel. The Qur'ān is not only considered by Muslims to be a guide but also as a sign of the prophethood of Muhammad and the truth of the religion. Muslims argue that it is not possible for a human to produce a book like the Qur'an. According to the Qur'ān<br>  <br>  "And if ye are in doubt as to what We have revealed from time to time to Our servant, then produce a Sura like thereunto; and call your witnesses or helpers (If there are any) besides Allah, if your (doubts) are true. But if ye cannot- and of a surety ye cannot- then fear the Fire whose fuel is men and stones,- which is prepared for those who reject Faith. "2:23&24<br>  <br>  Some non-muslim scholars accept a similar account, but without accepting any supernatural claims: they say that Muhammad put forth verses and laws that he claimed to be of divine origin; that his followers memorized or wrote down his revelations; that numerous versions of these revelations circulated after his death in 632 CE, and that first Abu Bakr ordered its compilation and then Uthman ordered the collection and ordering of this mass of material circa 650-656. These scholars point to many attributes of the Qur'ān as indicative of a human collection process that was extremely respectful of a miscellaneous collection of original texts.<br>  <br>  Other scholars have proposed that some development of the text of the Qur'ān took place after the death of Muhammad and before the currently accepted version of the Qur'ān stabilized. Western academic scholars associated with such theories include John Wansbrough, Patricia Crone, Michael Cook, Christoph Luxenberg, and Gerd R. Puin.<br>  <br>  The Qur'an claims that it has been created in miraculous way as a revelation from Allah (God), as a perfect copy of what was written in heaven and existed there from all eternity.[1] Therefore the verses of the book are referred to as ayat, which also means "a miracle" in the Arabic language.[2] The book also records other miraculous events which happened or are about to happen, most notably the divine judgement of souls of dead people and their heavenly rewards or suffering in hell.[3]<br>  <br>  <br>  Muslims consider the Qur'an as the word of God and a miracle.[4] In the Quran, it is claimed that Muhammed was illiterate and neither read a book nor wrote a book (7:157, 29:48) and that he did not know about past events (3:44, 11:49, 28:44).[5] Some scholars argue that Muhammad was influenced by older Jewish and Christian traditions, and included the wonders known from the Bible into the Quran.

You ask a total of 11 questions - most of which you should, being a beleiver, already know (its a SHAME if you dont know what the letters on top of the cross stand for...).

d8001a84732468043025fd5059b3d02daa	The key point in answering this question is; Jesus wasn't known or influential in his lifetime at all.  In fact nobody who ever actually knew Jesus or any literate person of the time ever wrote a single word about him.  The earliest writings that mention Jesus are the first gospels of the "New Testament" dated approximately 80 years after his reported death and are loosely attributed to the apostle Paul who never knew Jesus either.  <br>  <br>  .|`|1e0f8144745653f3ab0d4b5b9b271281aa	The miracles|`|ec9152f28369f6d8f9cf5b51eb5b1b61aa	He made a huge splash when he voted against Hillary Rodhan Clinton in the New York Senate race.<br>  <br>  She had him nailed to a cross for that.|`|b04fbfe80726bc268d8ec0b353456b51aa	He did not become all that well known in his lifetime because he restricted his ministry to a little known outpost of the empire called Palestine.<br>  He was locally known, crowds followed him, but he refused to capitalize on that. He was not interested in becoming a historic figure, but in accomplishing his real purpose of redemption.<br>  After the resurrection and the day of Pentecost, when the disciples began to preach, that is when he became known throughout the Roman Empire.<br>  He was never "wanted" by the Empire.  Only by the Jewish leaders.  They captured him, condemned him for blasphemy, and since they were not allowed, under Roman rule, to have capital punishment, they took him to the Roman Governor, Pilate, and manipulated him into condemning Jesus to death, contrary to Roman justice.|`|ec02b3b2ac0531db23e2884c415edc09aa	He performed the miracle of the wine at the wedding, I think people started talking then.

N?o acreditas que eu esteja em uni?o com o Pai e que o Pai esteja em uni?o comigo? As coisas que vos digo n?o falo da minha própria iniciativa; mas o Pai, que permanece em uni?o comigo, está fazendo as suas obras. .?.?. Ouvistes que eu vos disse: Vou embora e venho de volta a vós. Se me amásseis, alegrar-vos-íeis de que vou embora para o Pai, porque o Pai é maior do que eu.” (Jo?o 14:6-28) <br>  Jesus era “o?caminho, e a verdade, e a vida” porque estava conduzindo aqueles judeus de volta ao seu Pai, o Deus verdadeiro deles, Jeová. Por conseguinte, com Jesus, o empenho da humanidade na busca de Deus subitamente tomou ímpeto porque Deus, em seu supremo amor, enviara Jesus à terra como farol de luz e de verdade para conduzir os homens ao Pai. veja Jo?o 1:9-14; 6:44; 8:31,?32.<br>  Jesus é o único mediador entre Deus e os homens, assim sendo a menos que ele interceda por nós perante o nosso pai, n?o podemos de nossos próprios méritos faze-lo.|`|28bcd03af5ba8db2586e497fa63ad28caa	Que a sabedoria n?o permite dois Deuses.|`|9b5a7f7731616608cd95f5132bef1f5faa	Que aquele que praticasse aquilo que ele estava ensinando chegaria a harmonia do universo,a felicidade ao equilíbrio ou ao rítmo da cria??o.|`|de23a20bb28332a29d4d9540fea2dd7faa	Ele queria dizer como claramente está exposto:<br>  <br>  EU SOU O CAMINHO, A VERDADE E A VIDA.

Vou relatar a você meu modo de pensar tendo como fundamento as Escrituras Sagradas. <br>  Jesus disse ser o Caminho ( o - artigo definido), n?o há outro caminho.  Ele disse ser o Caminho que leva ao Pai, ent?o existe um único caminho que leva ao Pai. Podemos, através de Jesus, chegar ao Pai. Note que o Senhor Jesus disse "ninguém vem ao Pai, sen?o por mim", ou seja, Ele está em plena comunh?o com o Pai, demonstrado pelo verbo conjugado "vem", Ele e o Pai est?o plenamente juntos, Eles ( o Pai e o Filho) s?o um.<br>  " Respondeu- lhe Jesus: eu sou o caminho, e a verdade, e a vida; ninguém vem ao Pai, sen?o por mim." ( tradu??o de Jo?o Ferreira de Almeida). Veja ainda o que a Palavra de Deus diz:<br>  19 - " Tendo pois, irm?os, ousadia para entrar no santuário, pelo sangue de Jesus, <br>  20 - Pelo novo e vivo caminho que ele nos consagrou, pelo véu, isto é, pela sua carne,<br>  21 - E tendo um grande sacerdote sobre a casa de Deus, <br>  22 - Cheguemo- nos com  verdadeiro cora??o, em inteira certeza de fé; tendo os cora??es purificados da má consciência, e o corpo lavado com água limpa" (Hebreus: 10:19-22).<br>  Percebemos que através do sacrifício de Jesus(véu, carne de Cristo), somos lavados de todo pecado pelo Seu sangue e assim podemos chegar ao santuário, ou seja à Presen?a de Deus. E ainda, de acordo com as Escrituras, para sermos lavados pelo sangue de Jesus, devemos crer Nele e nos achegarmos a Ele com um cora??o sincero( ver versículo 22).<br>  Portanto, qualquer pessoa pode chegar à plenitude da Presen?a de Deus (usufruída por Cristo) pelo sangue de Jesus, se crer em Jesus como seu Senhor e Salvador e tiver um cora??o sincero diante de Deus. <br>  Espero ter ajudado!|`|ypHAryXVaa	Ele e' o nosso unico e verdadeiro advogado ou intercessor.

What I do know, is that laughter is contagious, like yawning. I recall a question here somewhere--about what your answering machine message is. A message of continuous laughter (between two persons) gets the best response. What makes us laugh at the start, is often lost as laughter becomes the singular enjoyment! I've laughed myself silly to tears. So that bottom line, it isn't really whether in retrospect one can define what made us laugh as "funny" or not--laughing is fun, it's good for you, & don't even try to stop. (As if you could.) Sometimes, digging into the "reasons" for something takes away a bit of its spontaneity.

After reading Yahoo! Community Guidelines and Yahoo! Terms of Service – I have modified my response, accordingly (they’re getting better at Yahoo! - all the time).<br>  <br>  I am going to recommend some books to read, however, before I do, I cannot impart this advice without sharing concerns for your psychological safety.<br>  <br>  I wonder if we can deal with certain realities rather than their potentials.<br>  <br>  Let us assume, from a somewhat philosophical beginning, that we can only know the situation around us, in terms of what is tangible or real.  Moving onward from that datum to a point of view, empirical, in nature,  let us become aware of what is real rather than the mystical forces that so many of us imagine, but cannot prove, except, perhaps, through faith upon, or in, what we believe to be true.  Contrary to popular opinion, a belief is not necessarily the same as a fact, proved through QED (quod erat demonstratum - which was to be demonstrated).<br>  <br>  If you can only know the situation around you, but not the forces behind it, does such a position indicate that you are unaware of the entire universe?<br>  <br>  If an individual can submit to the first step upon the path to knowledge, by admitting…‘I do not know, that is why I am on this path,’ then that is the right beginning, according to many Buddhist philosophies.  However, the relationship between student and teacher is a very exacting one, requiring discipline of each individual who engages the process.  Although I may be lambasted for the following statement, I shall take the risk, nevertheless…<br>  <br>  I have never been comfortable with the consumer’s ability to walk into a bookshop, conduct the transaction and read in solitude.  Though many people possess the maturity to read a book responsibly, many do not.  The most extreme examples that I can suggest, having had a devastating effect on human history, are Mein Kampf and Das Kapital.  Despite their intentions, the authors inspired the most heinous individuals among our human populations to acts of terror, theft, rape, murder and blind rage, a vicarious enjoyment of the suffering of peoples from a variety of cultures, genocide and its utter denial by the venal and the apologists.<br>  <br>  What gives you the impression that you are mature enough a person, psychologically and physically, for such a vast and responsible undertaking of knowledge?  <br>  <br>  I’ve asked this question, based upon the introduction to Carl Gustav Jung’s book, Man and His Symbols; you may find the following link useful, in general:<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.mythsdreamssymbols.com/mansymbols.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.mythsdreamssymbols.com/mansym...</a><br>  <br>  <br>  We . . . can become dissociated and lose our identity. We can be possessed . . . by moods, or become unreasonable, so that people ask: "What the devil has got into you?" We talk about . . . "control", but self-control is a rare and remarkable virtue. P. 8<br>  <br>  Within the Introduction to his great and last work, Jung stated that he didn’t believe the layperson would be able to appreciate the profundity of the essays contained within.<br>  <br>  And, upon reflection, throughout my adult life, I tend to agree.  The many books that fill shelves in bookshops on the subject of dream interpretation, for instance, have been influenced by Man and His Symbols (I regret not being in possession of the statistics, however the bibliography of so many books of that ilk are proof enough, perhaps).  My point, however, is expressed by putting other questions to you:<br>  <br>  Do we understand a thing because we agree with it?  Or, that it may be true?  Or, that it may be attractive?  What if it were an unattractive element of human knowledge, would we reject it?<br>  <br>  We are, after all, the most impressionable beings on the planet.  Animals have greater instinct for what is unhealthy.<br>  <br>  Such books that provide even the most comprehensive list of dream symbols, and their meaning, are snake oil.  My symbols are entirely subjective because my life has been, and will remain, an individual path.  Even if I were to describe the Houses of Parliament to you, in detail, whether the interior designed by Pugin or the physical building itself, designed by the eminent Victorian architect, Sir Charles Barry, we would not be discussing the same building, except in abstraction.  If we were to engage such a discussion, under the most equitable of circumstances, then we might enjoy the conversation even more if we were standing together and marvelling its overwhelming symbolism, side by side.  Any knowledge gained from a book doesn’t allow us direct contact with the original author, no matter the relative eloquence of the words blackening the page, but that is part of the nature of a book – distance.<br>  <br>  If you really do wish to comprehend the nature of magic, then ask of yourself the following questions, before proceeding with your inquires into mystery:<br>  <br>  1) What powers do you possess?<br>  2) Where did you get those powers from?<br>  3) In whose interests do you exercise those powers?<br>  4) To whom (or what) are you ultimately responsible?<br>  5) How do we stop you, should you become a danger to humanity?<br>  <br>  If you are unable to answer these questions, with integrity, then perhaps the present is not the right time for you to undertake the learning of such powerful and destructive knowledge.<br>  <br>  The Four Faces of God, Vols. I-IV, Joseph Campbell<br>  <br>  It might be wiser to cautiously weigh all of the difficulties associated with your inquiries before proceeding further.  I have a far more extensive list that I can send you, but it is often better to begin from the position of relying upon primary sources, rather than rowing rudderless in an ocean of knowledge, without direction or compass.<br>  <br>  Yours,<br>  <br>  Mark|`|9669328c4e15ac9e02e85263a3a9aeb1aa	When you invoke spirits there is no ouija board or sword, that is used.  Candles are used, incense, water and earth for the 4 elements, these elements are for your protection ring.  If you are not sure what you are doing you can invoke the wrong spirits that will actually take over your body and possess you.  Most people in their everyday life invoke spirits and are not aware of it.  If you are trying to invoke evil spirits then you need to know some applied magic and the proper way to use it, things can really go wrong and you need to be ready for whatever happens.  <br>  I have never heard of the book you are referring to but I have seen the movie White Noise, if you haven't seen that movie I recommend you watch it before invoking spirits.  I have been invoking spirits for a few years now, but I only invoke them for my personal self and I never include any magic.  I also call upon the angels, and calling upon the angels is how I got my start, you learn all the angels and what they are used for and within just a short time you will come to see in what areas of your life what angels are there to help you, they are always there to help you just need to know how to call upon them since they can not interfere until they are called upon.  What ever you choose to do please be very careful, do some research and get to know the angels.  The one major thing that is a must is you have to believe, truely believe in angels and spirits, when you truely believe someone who is close to you or your family will come to you, when they do pay close attention to what they tell you.  I hope you watch the movie that I recommended White Noise because i will show you how easy something so wonderful can turn out to be the absolue worst.|`|Kc33Pr0waa	be sure to use phsycic protection if you are going to do this sort of thing, be careful of your intentions<br>  you would be better off starting by contacting your spirit guide first..before opening up to just anyone..try reading books by Sanaya Roman or you can get a cd set by John Edward which is also quite good..if you have good intentions & feel that you would like to expand your phsycic awareness you will come across the right material...|`|cNPfvwUJaa	Your on the wrong site for this type of question, Oh and your lucky I'm trying to change my ways or I'd ask one of your myths to come make a believer out of you.<br>    You'll probably continue on your current path until you get scared, I never heeded the warnings and now I'm damned by playing with fire that doesn't burn.

UuNwuFAgaa	The best way to know whether or not someone is Gay, is to ASK them!  Who are you to judge another's sexual orientation?

86bdee7210e024dfe5c8dc94b917c424aa	I don't feel much like answering most of your questions. I only want to address the last one, and to sort of respond to the way that some others have answered that last question.<br>  <br>  Yes, there is a difference between being straight and being gay. The difference is that if you are straight, then you are in the majority who have thus been able to make the laws. If you are gay then you are in the minority and have often been outvoted by the straights in terms of making laws.<br>  <br>  Gays have long been treated as having "less" than "equal rights" as compared to straights. This has been gradually changing over time because more and more straight people have been recognizing that sexuality isn't a choice. We gay people have been gaining more and more allies. And so we have been able to create laws which have started to ensure our equality.<br>  <br>  But far too many people in the gay community have been deluded into thinking that the U.S. Constitution (or any state constitution) can plausibly been interpreted -- particularly by the courts -- to ensure equal rights for gay people. THAT is a mistake! Yes, there have been certain "victories" for us in the courts. But those "victories" were mistakes. The Massachusetts Court should not have done what they did. The U.S. Supreme Court should not have struck down the "sodomy laws" a few years ago.<br>  <br>  We should "have equal rights" when legislatures and voters grant them to us. We need more political allies. But relying on the courts is a very tragic mistake.<br>  <br>  <a href="http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index;_ylt=AmMw9x3DOqdoPlmDb0OnlXXty6IX?qid=20061115175419AAYivhB&show=7#profile-info-aa3f19d0200e780da32c2b197c162883aa">http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index;...</a><br>  .|`|65993d078368792022c842fe7041c44daa	its not wrong if they cant help it since they were born that way, what it is tho is a form of "birth-deffect',or "handi-cap"... even tho they dont look like they are birth-defected, there hormones and mental is birth-defect./handicap.<br>  <br>   no offense...love life...pass it on!|`|66cf39ebc02e76d99009917fc0798c1baa	No.<br>  Because they're small-minded and do not understand what equal means.<br>  No.<br>  You can't change who you are.<br>  I would be happy that they trusted me enough to do that.<br>  The only difference is who you are attracted to.<br>  No. Gay people are people too.

People should not be afraid of who they love and it is one of the main reasons for the ills of this world.|`|XKOe9GYxaa	It is not wron but people do think like that.|`|cf5961a316debfb7203fffd630bd740caa	it's not wrong to be gay. it's not like it's a choice. i have friends who are gay and my sister is a lesbian. there isn't much of a difference, only when you're gay you prefer your own gender. we all bleed, cry, laugh, love, hate, ect. the same.|`|AA11279122	No you can't change from being gay. We're pretty much like everyone else. We certainly are equal. I don't know why people are so homophobic..and I sometimes doubt whether they really do or not.  If a friend came out and told me he was straight...I'd still like him as a friend......|`|AA11376888	There is nothing wrong with being gay. It's how you look at it. Yes, for all the persecution based on one's sexuality, and better quality of life we want equal rights and tolerance. The underlying principle being every living being has the right to live with respect. If my best mate comes out as gay, I'd laud him for his honesty, and encourage him to gather more confidence in life to deal with so many issues we face. And no, if by change you mean changing orientation, that does not happen. Gay people can change in all other aspects of their life, just like any other human being.|`|sMnv2R22aa	Direct that question to God my friend! He's waiting for you|`|yK7umQhoaa	I personally think it's not wrong to be gay. A person can not help who they are attracted to. I am attracted to men, there is no way I could ever be attracted to women. It's not something that can be changed or helped. The reason other people think it's wrong or bad is because they don't understand it. If they were gay they wouldn't have that same thought. People fear what they don't understand. And along with fear comes confusion, anger, and a lot of other negative emotions. Gay people are just that, PEOPLE! Human beings just like you and me. There's no reason on earth why a gay person should be treated differently or in a negative way.

There will be three and a half years of peace after two thirds of the world dies in fire and plagues and famines-nuclear war and radiation poisoning.  Then there will be three and a half years of persecution for all people who won't follow the Anti-Christ.  The spirit of the Anti-Christ enters the leader of the revived Roman Empire.  This is 10 countries, 5 strong and 5 weak.  Sounds like a partial coalition.  I think the president of the United States will be the Anti-Christ.  Because we will protect Israel and what could happen like armageddon where we won't be involved.
