Let her know that her calling your boyfriend all the time is making you uncomfortable.  It's possible that she likes him, but it's also possible that she's just being friendly.  Let her know that even if she's only doing it to be friendly, it still bothers you.  Also, she needs to start calling YOU when she wants to invite the both of you somewhere.

What orientations are you familiar with (e.g. solution focused, motivational interviewing, etc.)?<br>  <br>  - Do you have any experience working with addictions?<br>  <br>  - Are you familiar with Best Practices in addictions counselling?<br>  <br>  - Why do you want to be an addictions counsellor?<br>  <br>  - What is your educational background?<br>  <br>  You might want to phone your local treatment center to ask what they look for when hiring a counsellor.

Choose the growth choice constantly, instead of the fear or defense choice, learn who you are and what you are good at, and develop those skills.  Through your work and skills, find something you are extremely passionate about and work to bettering yourself and others through that avenue.  Always continue to strive toward improving yourself and cultivating various virtues in yourself (Truth, Goodness, Beauty, Wholeness, Transcendence, Aliveness, Uniqueness, Perfection, Necessity, Completion, Justice, Order, Simplicity, Playfulness and Self-Sufficiency, for example); doing so will constantly move you toward self-actualization.|`|XAIiOFkXaa	You only have one chance at this life.

AA10529146	The first two reflect a fear of disease or death. Do you know anybody, someone close who has developed cancer, or died in an accident (fishing accident?) of some kind over water? Usually, these experiences can bring about recurring dreams with the same theme of death with an attempt to avoid it. The third one is like the "odd one out". Do you actually work for that place? It sounds like you might be unsure about your performance, or you have a demanding position and are afraid you might overlook something critical while performing your job, or perhaps you don't really enjoy working there (because it is demanding), but don't want to quit and look for another job because you need the income. If you don't work for Toys R Us, then I don't know unless you work for another place, but your first two dreams seem to indicate you are in high school, so this last one I don't know what to make of it actually, unless it is a desire of yours to find a job there, but are afraid you won't be able to handle the job well. Or perhaps you are graduated from high school and have a job and your first two dreams were merely reminders from when you were in high school.|`|egsBDRrbaa	your luck may be bad for i little bit some one you know may have cancer some one else has a bad day when he or she is fishing and your a little low on money hope that helped and dont get mad if its wrong thats just what it sounds like hope it helped

oZV7ukGqaa	I think that your question is one of the best examples of  why we don't use our talents and capabilities to our fullest potential.<br>  <br>   Many of us have experienced this same thing in life, many many times. Those that become successful in life, though, determine that their opinion of their self is just as important and if not more important that anyone elses. What was your opinion of your singing before this incident occurred? It is also your fear of this happening again that is keeping you from moving forward.<br>  <br>   You are older now, chances are that it won't happen and even if it did you would not let it effect you the way you did when you were younger. Let it go and believe in yourself, if you don't it will not be the nasty girl that stopped you from believing in your dreams, it will ultimately be you.<br>  <br>   So Believe in yourself again, start from the beginning and take some singing lessons, build your confidence and let yourself shine. You are worth it!|`|IPirciPFaa	You need to talk to someone about what has happened to you in the past,so you can let go of the past and look forward to your future.

xUZwbPlSaa	You can avoid laziness especially those things you don't want to do by prioritising. Now I know it is far more interesting chatting with your friends on MSN and playing the piano because those are the things that you enjoy more than your English homework. However, take it from me as someone who has been where you are many years ago that you have to ask yourself: 'what will bring me more benefit in the future?' Is it gossip on MSN or achieving As at English. Believe you me there is alot that you can do if you have a good command of the English language. The better your command and understanding of the English language the more opportunities that will be available for you even if you cannot see them now. I am writer and i didn't care much about English lessons until i left school and went to Unviersity and realised I needed to improve my standard if I wanted to achieve the grades. If only i had focused when I was younger I could have been much further ahead. The other thing is use your homework as means to prove to yourself how good you are. Use your homework as a motivation to achieve A grades continuously. Use it to show that you are the bees knees! I hope I haven't waffled too much.|`|GXxMDOV3aa	Try to find some excitment in wht ever you want to do so when you are doing it you wouldnot be lazy|`|x2yUC47Zaa	Tha'ts exactly what happens to me too, except it's for Earth Science. I think it has to do with the subject and how much you like it and how easy it is for you. For example the 2 worst subjects in the world is math being first, and science 2nd for me. Yet, on the other hand, all my other subjects english, history, religion etc.. I have no problem with. I also think it's laziness because I also lay down the books in front of me, open to the page and everyhing but can't seem to actually do it. I would just try to work harder in each subject and think of it as just getting it over with and you won't need to use it again ( Hopefully!)<br>  <br>           Try setting goals for yourself, and remember, the more work you do during school, the less closer you'll be to roasting your butt off in Summer school.<br>  <br>              Good luck!|`|pPZv2tTQaa	Yeah i have battled with that same problem my whole life.  the only solution is to 'just do it'.  I know that doesn't help.  Some people succeed with a self reward system.  The only thing that helped me was removing the distractions.  I would sit in a coffee shop and fight really hard my urge to go online.  If i didn't need to web-browse i had a separate profile on my laptop that didn't have a web-browser installed.  I would also listen to music.  Heavy metal was good cause the lyrics didn't distract me, also classical.  Classical might cause you problems though because you would want to play the piano.  Another suggestion would be to set aside 1hr everyday or maybe just 2 hours every Saturday (something you can stick to) and always go to the same place, if you don't have homework read a book but if you do have homework DONT BRING A BOOK!!!<br>    Patterns and plans helped me allot.  Also having someone who has the same problem and can commit to the same schedule helps because if you don't show your not just failing yourself (which always helped motivate me).  If your in college try to set up a small study group maybe.<br>  I know these are allot of suggestions but it's all about finding out what works for you.

I also have one a few months ago that was about my aunt who passed away 2 years ago, and I think the dream is a way of remembering the person who you love dearly and who you still miss terribly.<br>  <br>  I don't think it means too much other than that you miss him. Dont worry you aren't the only one.<br>  <br>  I'm sorry for you loss, If you believe somehow that its a way of him telling you something, then its up to you, if the signs are there then possibly, if not its just a reminder.

vLZePBDhaa	In general, women are somewhat better drivers, but not by much. When women do drive badly, the causes are pretty much the same as for men. For example, performing grooming while driving (men--shaving, women--makeup), talking on the cell phone, looking the wrong way, drinking, driving while tired or angry or preoccupied, going too fast, etc for both genders. <br>  <br>  One area where the cause is the same for both men and women, but occurs more with women is when the driver is transporting his or her children and becomes distracted by one of them. Since women take children places a bit more than men do, this cause affects women a bit more. Anyway, those are my ideas. I wonder if anyone knows of a real study that has pulled the statistics together. You got me curious and desirous of some hard data.|`|lqI8QZ9Eaa	Its never wise to generalise because there are always plenty of exceptions. Also I don't think its a big deal whether one sex is better at driving than another, but there is a case for saying that men are better at parking. This could be because testosterone improve some aspects of visuo-spatial ability thus might help e.g. in cognitively mapping the best strategies for reverse parking. <br>  <br>  The other thing could be confidence. Confidence that is too low or high isn't good for driving. Women probably suffer from the former in general, and men from the latter.|`|uWsWynTNaa	Because esp fathers (and then other people) teach their sons how to drive at a VERY young age.

He taught me because I was older and my brother had other things to do, like hang out with his friends.  One of my best friends drives 18 wheelers for a living and has been doing so for 10 years.  She met her husband on the road, now they both drive for the same company.  Sometimes, though, I tend to be too aggressive, but I am confident in my abilities.<br>  <br>  If more parents, or a competent adult, would get out their with their kids at a young age, more people would be able to drive better.|`|WKtakdsOaa	My husband reckons the reason I am so crap at driving is I cant concentrate on 1 thing for long periods of time.

dc49d60c4d19a92e193ce2f41c92cfedaa	My house that I grew up in was haunted I hated being alone. <br>  We had eves that ran along side both ends of the house and it was just a crawl through that only small kids could really fit into. We always heard weird noises in there and it freaked us out so my mother boarded them up so that NOTHING could get in there but still for years after you could still hear things walking through it.<br>  <br>  One night as I was walking down the hallway and my shadow was in front of me I looked up to see my shadow grow really tall and take the form of what looked like a man and it had horns and ran to the left of me. My shadow was gone after that but it should have been there. <br>  <br>  My boyfriend at the time (none believer) was home sick from work and decided to try sleeping at my house cause no one was home. He said he could hear what sounded like a little kid playing with toys in the living room and then a little while later there was a knock on the door so he went to see who it was and no one was there, not thinking anything of it he went back to bed but awoke to someone running up and down the stairs but when he went out to see who it was there was no one there.<br>  <br>  There's plenty more stories but this one is my favorite because my mother NEVER believed us and never believed in ghost or anything like that~ One day after being divorced from her husband and he took all the animals with him (cows, horses etc.) she was walking out in to the pasture when she heard hooves kicking on the floor and the chains rattling around and heard them making noises as if they were still in the barn.|`|cG3yFOdlaa	i have a personal experience when i was young.i heard this short,laughing sound right behind my back while i was watching tv at my grandparent's house one night( i spend days at their house during school break).sound like an old man but there's no one around both my grandparents are in the kitchen at that time.few days before there's an old man died in the village and his house is opposite to my grandparents house.my grandma jokingly said maybe the laughing sound that i heard was him.it's very frightening i remember i got fever the very next day.<br>  in my previous apartment,the shower turned on on its own one night while i in the kitchen.scared the hell out of me because i thought someone breaking into my apartment.i live on 6th floor.it's an old shower head actually so there's explanation.now i'm married and moved with my husband no more strange stuff happen.|`|SOvItNDHaa	Well, i was praying that God would send me a million dollars when Neil Patrick Harris came into my room riding a unicorn and said "If you want to know the secret of being, you will come with us."<br>  <br>  He showed me that ghosts are real
AA11780840	Edited:<br>   Ok, at first I was not sure what you meant. Because I alway thought ruminating had to do with the same thought over and over. For example, I always have a problem with the same song ruminating in my head ALL day long and ALL night.. I HATE IT SO MUCH AND IT'S FRUSTRATING. For me I have to listen to the actual song a few times to break the cycle... and then listen to something else...<br>  <br>  But after, I read a little about the definition of ruminate....here it goes...ruminate - reflect deeply on a subject; "I mulled over the events of the afternoon"; "philosophers have speculated on the question of God for thousands of years"; "The scientist must stop to observe and start to excogitate"<br>  meditate, mull, mull over, muse, ponder, chew over, think over, excogitate, reflect, speculate, contemplate<br>  cerebrate, cogitate, think - use or exercise the mind or one's power of reason in order to make inferences, decisions, or arrive at a solution or judgments; "I've been thinking all day and getting nowhere" <br>  <br>  In other words, verb ponder, think, consider, reflect, contemplate, deliberate, muse, brood, meditate, mull over things, chew over things, cogitate, rack your brains, turn over in your mind<br>  <br>  Ok, according to the website below:<br>  <br>  Step1.Catch yourself red-handed (or would it be red-brained). When you find yourself rolling the same worries over and over, admit it. Say it out loud: “I’m ruminating.” <br>  <br>  Step 2  Tell yourself to stop worrying and point out to yourself that you are capable of handling anything. <br>  <br>  Step 3  Do something else. Take a walk, ride a bicycle or sing the chorus of "Bridge Over Troubled Waters." Do whatever you want to do that makes you feel better than ruminating does. <br>  <br>  Step 4.  Look at something else. When you ruminate, your eyes (and everything else) lose focus on the real world. Bring yourself back with your senses. <br>  <br>  Step 5.   Make a specific time in your life for worries. Tell yourself that you will worry about the kids and school and everything else on Tuesday at 9 o’clock, for example. Give your worries a pre-determined amount of time, say, an hour. After their time is up, the worries don’t have to go home but they can’t stay here. <br>  <br>  Step 6.  After you have given your worries their allotted time, ask yourself what you would rather be doing with that time. Ruminating costs you time out of your life. <br>  <br>  Step 7.  Schedule a time for celebration. Since you scheduled a time for the rumination, why not give yourself an hour to whoop it up and generally feel good about yourself. <br>  <br>  Good luck...|`|45d774f93cd8fa9f498a7d7487bd0caaaa	If Ruminating in your own vocabulary is about compulsively thinking about something or about a disorderly amount of different things, or continuously juggling with prejudices and fears in your own head, and you want some freedom from it,<br>  <br>  you might decide and resolutely try to escape and turn your own attention and your own yearning sight to the outward, to whatever you see in front of you, to the immediate sun-kissed or even gloomy landscape and to the round wide horizon.<br>  <br>  Thus you might ardently abandon yourself in contemplation, in the way of a gaping thoughtless admiration of something out there.<br>  <br>  Thus, while contemplating, "gazing attentively", "intently looking at" the object of your attention, as my good old Webster dictionary hints,<br>  <br>  I think that you perhaps will reach that wished sublime apotheosis of no-rumination. I say "perhaps", because I think that in order for you to try and satisfy this wish of yours, this wish to stop addictive Ruminating, you may have to undergo a more or less extended diligent training, a self-training, or one helped by others, by somebody for free or for some $ ￡ € or other precious currency,<br>  <br>  as you may have to try and acquire a new habit in your own life, the dreamy glowing habit of not ruminating. Or you might even try and reach the good old golden saintly middle way.<br>  <br>  Allow me to wish you brilliant success and great thoughtless gaping laughs.|`|mweckZsMaa	Often I find myself going over and over the same thing, usually something I have done that I am judging myself for or worries I have. <br>  When I find myself doing that, each time I catch myself I ask inside that good energy go to everyone involved. You could think of it as saying a little prayer for everyone involved, that what is for the best happens, if that is the way you think. When it's really a challenging one and keeps coming back; then I end up sending more and more good energy to it. Eventually the ruminating stops and I feel at peace about it, even though I haven't changed anything except the nature of the energy I am putting out toward it. I hope this helps.|`|k2wPknXlaa	You might try writing down what your thinking about in as much detail as possible. This may help you so you don't have to be thinking about it all the time.

Otherwise he might mean that it is like that so that we won't be miserable and depressed, so that we will want to do what we can to help others..

83c15412024c532d9615f4d006e286f0aa	John Nash? Nah, I see myself more as Milton Friedman :P<br>  <br>  "What explains the coexistence of price differentials in comparable products in a super market chain?"<br>  <br>  It could be due to price discrimination for one but most likely the goods are not homogeneous products.  Each supermarket has their own product to cause 'product differentiation' in order to drive sales.<br>  <br>  "Does this imply the market is not necessarily in perfect competition?"<br>  <br>  Yes basically.  In order to be in perfect competition you must have homogeneous products and have the market determine that price.  So if there is differing prices and goods then this is not a perfect competition market. It most likely a monopolistically competitive market.

0EsfRqJ0aa	This can be tough...you want clarification, but don't want to ask a "stupid" question in a room full of peers. The best way for me to get past this is to sit in the front of the classroom (so you're in closer proximity to the professor, and not worrying about what other students are doing), and speak directly to the professor. Don't look around at other students for their reactions. Just simply address the professor and focus on his/her response, that way you won't be so absorbed in worrying about what others around you are thinking. And BTW, most of the time they aren't even paying attention. As for your lip hanging open...try taking a sip of water before asking your question and then mindfully bringing your lips back to lighlty touching when your done speaking.|`|f01jXc8naa	asking Questions in classes is just not something to be shy of<br>  <br>  Actually, (trust me) Teachers love it when someone asks questions...<br>  it makes them feel meaningful and content.  u know<br>  somebody is paying attention to their lectures<br>  <br>  They will start loving you<br>  see, shying is only fear of getting embarrassed and not opening p<br>  but think of it - whats the worst thing that can happen?

Practice while taking a shower... see the situation in your mind and the great outcome.  Practice for a couple of weeks and then look for a chance to ask a question when you know that you are not the only one in class who is lost on a particular topic.<br>  <br>  Many students are secretly happy when someone asks a question because they have the same question or very close to it.  I have found that sitting in the very front row of the class helps me to pay attention and to ask questions as there is no one in front of you to cause concern or distraction.
4f2GaLhpaa	I'm taking an arecheology class now and we're learning about this kind of thing. The Neandertals were shorter than us, but they had very powerful muscles and could do everything we can do now and more (physically). They were basically modern humans only built for extreme weather and conditions. Their brains were actually bigger than ours as well so they could have had the same amount of brain power or even more - no one knows because there is not enough evidence. So yeah you're right all that is true!<br>  <br>  & There is a big debate on how to classify them today, if we should consider them in our species or not, most experts are leaning towards a different species. <br>  <br>  The theory I think you're refuring to is the theory of eveolution by natural selection, Darwin's theory. It's basically saying that living creatures adapt and change based on their environments- I know that's an oversimplification but that's basically the main point. According to this theory, it doesn't mean we are better than any other class of human, it just means that the modern human is more reproductivly successful in this current environment. So no I wouldn't say humans are SUPREME compared to the early humans, we are just better suited for our current environments at this present time.<br>  <br>  Although I think if you had them both cagefight (I don't know HOW this could happen lol) I totally think neandertal would win!!<br>  <br>  Some names of some other early humans for you to compare are homo habilis (&rudolfensis), homo erectus, and archaic homo sapiens. That's all we've talked about so far in class but I know there's more. <br>  <br>  And my class really just started, I'm definately not any type of expert so I can't say if we are getting more intelligent but physically weaker as time goes on- but it sure seems that way doesn't it? <br>  <br>  And the radioactive sheilds seem so science-fiction, but you never know, anything could happen!! <br>  <br>  I hope this helped answer your question!!|`|YjG1TEJoaa	Your question shows that the data your using is decades out of date.

Check online or in the newspaper for local stuff going on and just start going to stuff...and maybe take a course or something if you are done high school and make a point to chat with anyone in the class who will listen. Practice conversation skills everywhere you go...with cashiers, people in lineups...anywhere...because maybe you are just a bit shy or lacking in some confidence. Hey, why don't you make a list of all of your interests and skills and brainstorm some ideas of places to do those activities where there are any other people at all. You don't need to make the closest friends at first, but over time, you may meet some people you really connect with. I have another great idea for you...maybe...volunteer someplace...like if you like animals, volunteer at your local animal shelter to walk some dogs or brush some cats. The idea is to meet other people who are also volunteering there. Anyhow...sometimes when people don't have much of a social life in school, they think that is the way it will always be, but you're entering a new phase in your life...your childhood was temporary, but adulthood is the rest of your life and so you will have lots of new opportunities to find where you feel you belong...try to be a positive, confident and decent person and you will attract the same to you.

You might think that by living the Gospel such as not drinking and smoking to "fit in" would have an even greater negative effect, but in reality i have received so much respect from others who i never thought would do so.  Also, it has helped me to gain trust of many people because thy know who i am and what i stand for.

ACA8i43Gaa	My fiance and I were going to college. He lived with five other guys, but at any given time there would be one or two random guys that would stay there for the week. In order to see each other I would have to come over in the early morning between our two jobs and classes. It was that, or we couldn’t see each other during the week. He started sleeping out on the couch because his roommate that shared a room with him started a graveyard shift and needed his sleep. <br>  <br>  One morning, before the sun came up, I had just let myself in to his apartment, and saw that his alarm clock was by the couch so that he wouldn’t sleep through class. He hadn’t been expecting me so I carefully walked through the pitch black apartment trying not to trip over anything. I wanted to surprise him with a wake up kiss, so I knelt down and started to kiss him. It was turning quite passionate when all of the sudden he went completely rigid. I sat up to see what was wrong and it wasn’t my fiance at all. It was some random guy who had just happened to stay overnight. I thought I was going to die! All I could pathetically say was, “Sorry, I thought you were my fiance.” His reply’ Well, after he stopped laughing and could finally take a breath said “It’s all good.”<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.yourembarrassingmoments.com" rel="nofollow">http://www.yourembarrassingmoments.com</a><br>  <a href="http://www.yourembarrassingmoments.com/story/it-wasnt-my-fiance-at-all.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.yourembarrassingmoments.com/s...</a>|`|tGAt3ZKkaa	I was feeling super sick in school in grade 5.<br>  I ran really fast into the bathroom, which ended up being the boys bathrom!!<br>  I ran into the stall and ended up throwing up all over a boys bare lap!!!<br>  OMG!!!<br>  I felt so embarrassed, I just ran out, without saying sorry, but now I wish I had.<br>  <br>  I was at my cousins house with my parents and my friend.<br>  I badly wanted a puppy and kept bugging my family for it and so they all went into the basment to talk about it.<br>  My friend and I stood at the first step which for some reasonw as outside the door and we were listenign.<br>  We soon heard my mum say they would get me a puppy for x-mas.<br>  M and my friend started jumping around saying "yah yah! woohoo!" and then the step broke and we went flying through the floor.<br>  Everyone was staring at us, all we did was get up and go " . . . bye" and ran upstairs. lol<br>  <br>  We were at the beach, pretty far out, her boyfriend was surfing and we were just floating around on a massive board her dad had made.<br>  And a massive wave came at us all and knocked her BF of his surfboard and us off the board. And while I was under the water my bikini bottoms came off and my friend BF did a face plant on my bare butt!!!<br>  <br>  OMG!!

You can't just toss people aside and expect that it won't hurt them.  Had the situation been different and he had done that to you, how would you feel?  I think you have done enough to hurt this guy.  I'm glad he was able to unload his feelings, it shows just how deep his pain was.  Apologize, then leave him alone.  It should be his choice if he contacts you again.|`|JxlaxOJTaa	I'm sorry to hear that. Sometimes we don't really know what we want. I think he had moved on. The only you can now if you still love him or if you don't want bearing any regret is to ask him to see you in person and apologize. If he don't want to meet up with you then reply to his email and apologize sincerely and explain. Tell him about your position, but don't beg him to come back. I was in the same situation. I didnt talk to my EXBF for 3months then he broke up with me. I don't understand why I did that to him, but he was really mad. I apologized, beg him to forgive me, and give me another chance. He said he will love me forever, but he will never come back anymore. I cried so much, but I can't blame him. I realized how much I love him after his gone. I wanted to fix it and make sure I won't do anything that will hurt his feelings, but it's too late. I thought I don't want to see any sunshine anymore, but this quote made me strong:<br>  <br>  "LIFE is too short to be UNHAPPY,<br>  be CONTENTED of what u got,<br>  don't be SELFISH,<br>  APOLOGIZE when u should,<br>  take CHANCES,<br>  GIVE everything,<br>  LEARN from ur MISTAKES,<br>  but NEVER regret,<br>  let go of what u CAN'T change,<br>  people CHANGE,<br>  thing's go WRONG, <br>  but``LIFE GOES ON"|`|IEiC2Wmkaa	***** MUCH?!<br>  why would he wanna hang out with you after you didnt even tell him you were over , you just pretened it never happened and you went SILENT!

QbzvWJe0aa	Answering first to your main question, no one falls out of love so quickly. Falling out of love is a process, the problem is that while the person falling out of love went through that process, the other person has no clue, so when the lack of love is said in words or actions, the other person is in a shock, it seems to the one still in love that it happened so fast. <br>  <br>  Now about your boyfriend's actions, it seems for me that he needs some distance, his space. The reasons can be many, he can really be stressed, or perhaps still angry, or thinking if he wants to keep the relationship. He is the only one that knows how he feels and thinks, so going in there trying to guess is going to drive you crazy. Therefore I would recommend you give him that space he needs. <br>  <br>  We know that if someone wants to contact you, they will, there is no cell phone excuse, as it is easy to call from another kind of phone or ask a family member or a friend to let him send a text message, and well there are computers everywhere too.  <br>  He wants his space and as much as this hurts you, or is difficult to do, give that space to him and DON'T contact him. This is not with the aim of playing any game, but for your own protection. The more you try to contact him and the more he does not respond the greater the hurt for you. So take this time to do things, go out with friends, discover new things, learn a new language. Use that hurtful energy into doing something new. It will keep you mind busy and it will make this period of you life easier.  Also it will give you perspective into all this. <br>  <br>  IF things don't work out with your love, know that the hurt disappears  with time, you have to help yourself to go through this process and the step number one is to acknowledge that we can't control how others feel, and that it has nothing to do with who we are!<br>  <br>  Best of luck|`|Y7YC2FzZaa	listen, it can be anything. But yes people and especially guys do just lose interest. Attraction is mostly chemical and we men do Develop a resistance to women after a time. The one year mark is about the same amount of time most of my friends lose interest and want to move on. Honestly in my younger days this was the norm. Its not nice or sweet but there it is.|`|inST4SlAaa	hes not playing hard to get he is playing hard to find.  he still loves you but give the guy some space.  let him contact you next time, and maybe the next time after that|`|mZVk3fP4aa	Quit trying to contact him. If he doesn't contact you in a reasonable amount of time, look elsewhere.|`|F3NNKwP9aa	maybe he is stressed out about stuff that isn't related to you or maybe he met someone else.<br>  <br>  I am not sure. Either way: give him space.Don't contact him again until he contacts you first. Find some other focus for your time and attention and then if he calls or texts you, you can be happy about it. Otherwise if he doesn't contact you, you will already be on the way to recovery|`|bGsXsDhBaa	Make it your business to see him face to face and discuss it.<br>  <br>  Be prepared that he may be unable to articulate himself and then on the basis of what you hear from him: leave.<br>  <br>  If he calls you it's on. If not: It's over.|`|9679eed4decfc91fdcea2e17ae362313aa	If you are questioning whether he loves you, time to move on.|`|ZYp1AEspaa	Maybe his phone's not charged yet? It seems too early to panic. He's probably just busy, had to go out & forgot the phone, etc. When you do talk with him it would probably be a good idea not to start right off with "Why didn't you call" as it's not too much fun to feel cornered. <br>  <br>  I don't think men/boys play "hard to get" very much. I think they sometimes just find it all too hard, confusing etc. and shut down rather than risk saying or doing the wrong thing.|`|e87578a8912d84efdea276789acfc11baa	It seems to me like he is trying to put off talking to you. He may not know what he wants right now and this is the best way he can think of not to have to talk about it at this time. Give him some time and space.If he does not call and talk to you in a few days you call him a suggest a time and a place to talk this out as you need to deal with this...either you are getting back together ot moving on.|`|3buQDaRDaa	It is over. Move on with your life. I know it is difficult, but it has to be done. You can't control the situation, but you can control your attitude. Being needy and desperate isn't attractive. It is annoying.|`|5f52c5c3d1d0deab80192fb888e39e9aaa	It's too soon to be sure what's going on. He might be getting tired of the type of fights you're having in your relationship. Guys in general have a very low tolerance for conflict, especially emotional conflict.  When they get annoyed with the stress, they withdraw. <br>  <br>  As hard as this is going to be (nearly impossible for some), you really need to back off and let him make the next move. If you notice, you've been the one who's been contacting him over the past few days.  You don't want to appear desperate if he's really on the verge of reconsidering the relationship. It could make him feel smothered. I would be even more careful of coming across as needing him too much if he's young or immature. That can freak some guys out when they've not reached the point where they can handle having someone rely on them. <br>  <br>  Go out with some friends and distract yourself. Leave your cell phone at home.  He needs to see that you have a life of your own. You'll be surprised how quickly he'll start calling you again (assuming he hasn't decided to break up with you) if it seems like you're not always available to answer his every whim.
EaurpLufaa	A person who wants to "let the truth come out" wouldn't direct a question at "ladies only" and simultaneously assume that all women think/feel the same way about size.<br>  <br>  SIMPLETON VERSION: Me no think you should group all women in one way toward the subject of penis size.  Also, me no think that directing entire questions at women answerers only means you will get truthful answer.  How's that?  Is better?  I tried but brain hurts now...<br>  <br>  EDIT:  Wow.  Alright.  So assume that all women in all the categories you asked this question in are straight women who want to talk "openly" about this little topic.  Go ahead.  So who's TD'ing my answer?|`|oVeGMNsLaa	My feelings on it are this:<br>  <br>  Large/medium penises are more aesthetically attractive than smaller penises.  I don't know if it's because of watching porn or what, but I like the look of something with some length to it.  (Oddly enough, I like the feeling of girth, but I think that the look of a very thick penis to be not as attractive as a pretty, long slender one).  And I'll also tack on there that the beauty of a penis is relevant not only to size, but to proportion with body size, and just the way they look.  I'll take a pretty small penis any day over an ugly big penis.  But yes- when it comes to looking at them, bigger is usually better.<br>  <br>  That said, there is definitely a statute of limitations on size when it comes to actually enjoying it physically instead of visually.  (That old saying of "My eyes are bigger than my stomach." certainly applies here, with a bit of a vocabulary change).  I've always said that I prefer a medium penis- they're easier to deep-throat, easier to take for anal sex, and if you're really strapped for girth or length, you can always throw on a penis extender sleeve.  If you have a guy who's too big, there's no way he can get smaller.<br>  <br>  I definitely don't relate penis size to bedroom skills.  If anything, smaller guys seem to be better sometimes, as if they've learned to cope and compensate, whereas big guys rely on their size only.  When it comes to my list of things I want for sex, penis size ranks pretty low, after things like communication and being open, a sense of sexual adventure and being willing to explore, oral skills, and how long he can last (stamina is a big one for me).  But then again, I'm pansexual, and I like approaching sex with a sort of lesbian mentality- as in, a penis is fantastic, but I don't NEED it to enjoy myself.  I want a guy who is just as confident and willing to use his hands on me as his penis, or, for that matter, any number of toys.  I don't want a guy who's threatened by a dildo or vibrator in bed.<br>  <br>  I just don't judge sexual prowess based on size.  Like I said, when I see a big(ger) penis, I do tend to get a bit hotter- it's like a Pavlovian response.  But I don't assume he can screw any better than a guy with a smaller one.  There's never any sense of disappointment until the sexin' is over.<br>  <br>  I hope that was an adequate answer.  Oh, and I bet you'd be really interested in this documentary, "My Penis and Everyone Else's":<br>  <br>  <a href="http://mypenisandeveryoneelses.com/" rel="nofollow">http://mypenisandeveryoneelses.com/</a>|`|3buQDaRDaa	From one dude to another dude, start eating ***** and focusing on the clit.|`|9679eed4decfc91fdcea2e17ae362313aa	My thoughts?

Which seems about right judging from my self, because I'm in this range.

It is really not that important as long as it works.|`|7EV9fqM3aa	It is only important if it is too big. We have sizes too. We can stretch a bit but only so much. Our cervices aren't anywhere near 9 inches away from the entrance. Just so we're clear, it is quite painful to have anything smash up against the cervix. Fully aroused the average vaginal canal is 5-6 inches, just like the average fully aroused penis. Unlike penises, the girth of the vaginal canal is smaller but can easily stretch to accommodate more. Not, mind you, terribly much more. Our G-spot is, on average, about 2 inches inside our vaginal canal and bulges slightly so it's even tighter at that most, deliciously sensitive point. The clitoris is usually vastly more sensitive and very much on the outside.<br>  <br>  It doesn't take anything massively huge to get us off. Most of us know just how well our fingers work and they're much thinner and can only reach comfortably from an awkward angle not allowing the full length of the finger. <br>  <br>  Penis size is a means by which men judge masculinity. Some women buy into this myth. For their sake, I hope they can fully enjoy the size of that myth. I can't. I'll take smaller any day of the week.<br>  <br>  In my somewhat limited experience most men with larger penises seem to think that size is all that matters. Large can be used well, if very, very, very, very gently and cautiously, but most guys with large penises seem to not even try to learn how to use them effectively. They seem, even, to think we enjoy bruised cervices, or just not have a clue that they exist.|`|tyuxbdrnaa	Listen darlin...<br>  Every woman has their own opinion on this subject...<br>  so don't fret....<br>  <br>  here's a lil poem I wrote for you...<br>  I really don't care,<br>  'bout the size of your c0ck,<br>  just make sure your tongue,<br>  is the best on the block!<br>  <br>  It's all about the hurricane toungue baby,<br>  and the way you stimulate my mind.<br>  Don't get me wrong...<br>  I absolutely adore the male anatomy...<br>  love penis, but to me size doesn't matter!

mVTGl6HGaa	Intelligence (also called intellect) is an umbrella term used to describe a property of the mind that encompasses many related abilities, such as the capacities to reason, to plan, to solve problems, to think abstractly, to comprehend ideas, to use language, and to learn. There are several ways to define intelligence. In some cases, intelligence may include traits such as creativity, personality, character, knowledge, or wisdom. However, most psychologists prefer not to include these traits in the definition of intelligence.[citation needed]<br>  <br>  Theories of intelligence can be divided into those based on a unilinear construct of general intelligence and those based on multiple intelligences. Francis Galton, influenced by his cousin Charles Darwin, was the first to advance a theory of general intelligence. For Galton, intelligence was a real faculty with a biological basis that could be studied by measuring reaction times to certain cognitive tasks. Galton's research on measuring the head size of British scientists and ordinary citizens led to the conclusion that head size had no relationship with the person's intelligence.<br>  <br>  Alfred Binet and the French school of intelligence believed that intelligence was an average of numerous dissimilar abilities, rather than a unitary entity with specific identifiable properties. The Stanford-Binet intelligence test has been used by both theorists of general intelligence and multiple intelligence.<br>  <br>  [edit] Definitions<br>  <br>  Intelligence comes from the Latin verb intellegere, which means "to understand". By this rationale, intelligence (as understanding) is arguably different from being "smart" (able to adapt to one's environment). At least two major "consensus" definitions of intelligence have been proposed. First, from Intelligence: Knowns and Unknowns, a report of a task force convened by the American Psychological Association in 1995:<br>  <br>      Individuals differ from one another in their ability to understand complex ideas, to adapt effectively to the environment, to learn from experience, to engage in various forms of reasoning, to overcome obstacles by taking thought. Although these individual differences can be substantial, they are never entirely consistent: a given person’s intellectual performance will vary on different occasions, in different domains, as judged by different criteria. Concepts of "intelligence" are attempts to clarify and organize this complex set of phenomena. Although considerable clarity has been achieved in some areas, no such conceptualization has yet answered all the important questions and none commands universal assent. Indeed, when two dozen prominent theorists were recently asked to define intelligence, they gave two dozen somewhat different definitions.[1][2]<br>  <br>  A second definition of intelligence comes from "Mainstream Science on Intelligence", which was signed by 52 intelligence researchers in 1994:<br>  <br>      A very general mental capability that, among other things, involves the ability to reason, plan, solve problems, think abstractly, comprehend complex ideas, learn quickly and learn from experience. It is not merely book learning, a narrow academic skill, or test-taking smarts. Rather, it reflects a broader and deeper capability for comprehending our surroundings—"catching on", "making sense" of things, or "figuring out" what to do.[3]<br>  <br>  Another simple and efficient definition is : the ability to apply knowledge in order to perform better in an environment<br>  <br>  Researchers in the fields of psychology and learning have also defined human intelligence:<br>  Researcher  Quotation<br>  Alfred Binet  Judgment, otherwise called good sense, practical sense, initiative, the faculty of adapting one's self to circumstances...auto-critique.[4]<br>  David Wechsler  The aggregate or global capacity of the individual to act purposefully, to think rationally, and to deal effectively with his environment.[5]<br>  Cyril Burt  Innate general cognitive ability[6]<br>  Howard Gardner  To my mind, a human intellectual competence must entail a set of skills of problem solving—enabling the individual to resolve genuine problems or difficulties that he or she encounters and, when appropriate, to create an effective product—and must also entail the potential for finding or creating problems—and thereby laying the groundwork for the acquisition of new knowledge.[7]<br>  Linda Gottfredson  The ability to deal with cognitive complexity[8]<br>  Sternberg & Salter  Goal-directed adaptive behavior[9]<br>  <br>  [edit] Theories of intelligence<br>  <br>  The most widely accepted theory of intelligence is based on psychometrics testing or intelligence quotient (IQ) tests[citation needed]. However, dissatisfaction with traditional IQ tests has led to the development of a number of alternative theories, all of which suggest that intelligence is the result of a number of independent abilities that uniquely contribute to human performance.<br>  <br>  [edit] Psychometric approach<br>  Main articles: Intelligence quotient, Genera

ZHJuK1QNaa	First I would wonder if something was hanging from my teeth or face, next I would check my zipper or buttons.  If everything checked out I would feel bad, because I always want to be in on a good joke. <br>  Or maybe that person may be crazy and you wouldn't want to know what was making them struggle.|`|mLioEPi2aa	first check whether it's smthn abt me if not then check WHY he is laughng then mayb laugh wd hiim at his joke|`|FIymMqm9aa	At first I would think he's laughing at me.

on5NQxhkaa	According to Carl Jung, who invented these terms of "introvert" and "extrovert" you do not change from one to the other, that quality is innate. People will change slightly at different points in their life, but will always be one way or the other.<br>  <br>  He also stated that there is no type that is better than another... so therefore, you have no need to change anyway. There is no advantage to being an introvert or extrovert, it's just that way you are.<br>  <br>  Introverts can still be outgoing and friendly people, contrary to what some people think... introvert just means that you recharge and gain energy internally rather than through others. But you can still be a social person and enjoy the company of others.|`|eaae12c8744194b4051dee1eb83100fdaa	This is a natural gift , do not try to change over other wise you will feel frustration in life.|`|a4cf3390237787a35ca6dc8bdf73f88eaa	it's normal to change.<br>  but if you really think being an extrovert works better for you, then:<br>  <br>  exert effort on your relationships (friends, family, organizations, etc).<br>  surround yourself with people and treat them right.<br>  be open to others, spend time with them.<br>  sincerely accompany them whenever they need.<br>  do fun things with them, or rather,<br>  do things with them, and have fun!<br>  <br>  but hey, don't push yourself too hard on others. okay?<br>  it just won't turn out good. :)
ZHJuK1QNaa	I think you really miss you dad and miss the comfort of him physically being here.  I truly believe those we love really never totally leave us.

You feel you didn't get closure with your dad before he died, so your mind is trying to fabricate it.  It is normal to miss loved ones after they pass away, and you have my condolences.  It is also possible(if you believe in this sort of thing)that your dad was trying to reach you from beyond the grave.  I dunno, those are my best guesses.  If they should stop after the funeral.  Wishing you the best of luck<br>                                -Jyokdar|`|5PAP1hpSaa	Perhaps you had trouble letting go and this is your mind trying to make itself at peace.Or you can look at it in other terms maybe your dad wanted to let you know how he felt about you and could not rest until he did.<br>  <br>  It all come down to how you view these things.<br>  <br>  <a href="http://swagbucks.com/?cmd=sb-register&rb=374732" rel="nofollow">http://swagbucks.com/?cmd=sb-register&rb...</a>|`|qK1iEcVhaa	It just means you miss your dad so cheer up and believe your dad is going to whatever place he wanted to go.

Some people want to leave their old life behind (because of experiences, people or mistakes)  Leaving doesn't have to mean "I give up" or "I quit" or "I can't do this" <br>  <br>  We all have one life, so you best make the best of it.  If you feel you should start a new life, somewhere else, with someone new, doing something else, then it's entirely up to you to do that.<br>  <br>  As to the HOW part, I'd suggest travelling.  Leave old ruts behind.  You may find answers to unknown questions.  Depending on your age, Katimavik is great (Canadian, 17-21 years old, www.katimavik.org) or Canada World Youth (www.cwy-jcm.org) or just start walking/hitchiking/biking (at your own risk)  <br>  <br>  Like I said though, if you want start a new life, I assume you don't like your current one, MOVE.  Even if you find parts of your old life that you do miss, then it will have been worth it.  Things will be a bit clearer.  Hope those suggestions help (again, be careful though)|`|ZHJuK1QNaa	Why would you want too?  If you are running from something or someone it won't work. You have to face your fears and work through them.  Your life is what you make it, decide to be the person you want to be.  Really you can choose to be happy or sad. The trick is choosing and sticking to that choice. I hope you are okay, your question is pretty troubling.  If you are really depressed or afraid please seek professional help.<br>  Good Luck!|`|HqyFyF8haa	Well let's see<br>  <br>  Start acting differently. Be a completely new person.

AA12071178	you should try to find things that he enjoys/likes and do some research on them and then ask him questions or ask him what he thinks about your opinion on those topics.<br>  if he is not a chatter you are probably not going to change that, so mights well accept it or move on...on the other hand, he could be protecting himself from getting hurt and just is not opening up because he is afraid..if that's the case, just a bit patient and show him that he can trust you and you will not hurt his feelings.|`|TZMBn5z7aa	I was one growing up  what always helped people when talking with me was 1 to make it a  one on one conversation so don't try asking him about himself at parties or in groups  2 try talking about things he knows  see if he has any hobbies or sports or interests that you may share   he may not talk much because he feels like he has nothing to add to the conversation <br>  <br>  and I wouldn't loose patients    he is just shy make him feel comfortable with you by being relaxed and let him come out of his shell a little bit at a time|`|a4cf3390237787a35ca6dc8bdf73f88eaa	maybe he needs time to lose the shyness and warm up.<br>  don't insist on making him answer random/casual questions.<br>  know his interests and try talking about it.<br>  <br>  i had a classmate like that, once. i wanted to make friends, but conversations with her goes: 1question --> 1answer --> silence. she's really a soft-spoken person, but i see she now found people with the same interests on anime. they tell me she's not really the quiet type most people see.<br>  <br>  it's a matter of catching what things stimulates your friend on talking!<br>  you're kind enough to reach out and find ways to be his "friend," maybe he really needs one.<br>  good luck! :)

Flying events seem to be divided among those who fly spontaneously in their dreams and those who have a lucid dream and choose to fly. In either case, the dreamers report powerful feelings of freedom and limitless potential in the flight. If you dream of flying it is very often a precursor or lead up to a lucid dream ( a dream state in which we are aware we are dreaming and can manipulate the outcome of the dream).  Even in a dream state, most of us are aware that we can't fly in normal life, thus on some level, to dream of flying usually coincides with dreaming lucidly for the vast majority of the population, though most awaken unaware of the fact that they were engaged in a lucid dream. Most people love flying dreams, since the dreamers feel a sense of liberation as they soar through the sky or float around the bedroom. I've never met anyone who hasn't enjoyed the experience of flying in a dream. However, the experience of a flying-in-an-airplane dream is different. If you have a flying dream, ask yourself what you're flying over. The most common feeling associated with flying is exhilaration, a sense of freedom. You can do whatever you want and aren't scared of falling. It speaks of a desire to liberate yourself from mundane, a day-to-day activities. A lot of people who dream of flying say it signifies a time in their lives when everything is flowing smoothly and they feel in control of their destiny. Other people say it gives them the strength and motivation to take responsibility for something in their lives that they feel is spiraling out of control.

I'd feel my child is more important to me than some genius!<br>  <br>  And why is my opinion or anyone else's important to you, on this matter?<br>  <br>  Most people are average . . . <br>  As for importance, it will depend on who you ask.<br>  The parents will pick their children . . .no matter their intelligence level.<br>  <br>  Your questions cannot be answered.<br>  Each answer will be only that person's preference; and also what each one of us measure as "smarter" or "dumber".<br>  <br>  There are people who are book smart . . . and socially stupid.<br>  There are people who are socially savvy . . . and cannot spell, read or write.<br>  Some of us are much better with and highly intelligent with English . . . yet flunked math!<br>  <br>  Some people are math geniuses and cannot spell worth a damn.<br>  <br>  I'm great with medieval history . . . yet, some people are not.<br>  <br>  So, measuring intelligence is not about "smarter" or "dumber". It depends on the subject, the situation and many, many other factors.<br>  <br>  Would someone be obsessed with being smart? Sure, usually it's for reward, though . . . like getting on the honor roll or to win a Nobel Prize. Although, usually its obsessed with getting the prize, not so much with just "being smart".<br>  <br>  We all do things for a reason.<br>  <br>  And there's nothing wrong with wanting or striving to get good grades or learn more or do better.

But these are generalizations.  <br>  Also, greater intelligence and education broadens one's perspective and understanding of the world, and, in doing so, makes life more enjoyable and rewarding.|`|AA12346593	I personally want to be smart in order to have something else to rely upon besides my looks. I think our society places too much emphasis on beauty and not enough on brains. Yes, it's important. I have no desire to go through life being stupid. As far as importance....I think it's one thing to be ignorant of something, it's quite another to be willfully stupid about it. There is a difference.|`|kAceP1pzaa	The Smarter you are, the more boring you are. Because you can not associate yourself with people.

We are all equal in God's eyes. Even if someone isn't of high intellect, they have a lot to offer!

pWBQzXXuaa	the old one was worse so far, a lot more were homeless and went bankrupt.<br>  <br>  the new one started with something called the subprime mortgage crisis (basically banks lending ppl with bad credits money to buy houses with higher interests) that was kind of stupid cuz if these ppl couldnt pay back loans at lower interest rates wat made banks think that they would with higher rates?!<br>  <br>  till that point the prob. was a credit problem in the US, but becuase banks acted out of greed and fear, what they did was put all their bad credit (loans that ppl didnt pay back) in the middle of good credit and sold it to banks all over the world (banks sell their credit to one another). when bannks around the world realise that that had toxic credit, a shock wave hit the world economy, banks started to get suspecious of one another and they all stopped lending one another. this was phase 2 and was called the credit crunch. with no one lending the other banks struggled to raise finance to susrvive, and the next thing you know huge banks like fannie mai and freddie mac were falling flat on their faces and were facing closure, if it werent for superman government.<br>  <br>  the great depression of 1930's also started due to a credit problem, people were borrowing money and buying things like washing machines and wat not, basically things with no monetary return. and it started with the wall street crash.<br>  <br>  the reason that the current crisis spread so fast was due to globalisation today, the world is one big interconnected economy.<br>  <br>  its not over yet, and no one knows if it will get better or worse, but many are saying that the worse is behind us.<br>  <br>  p.s <br>  check out this video its really good, it exaplins both crises in an interesting and very simple way:<br>  its called 'when the world went bust' <br>  <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z9Orqtn7cJA" rel="nofollow">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z9Orqtn7c...</a> <br>  <br>  hope this helped|`|rc4B8Vdaaa	This crisis is worse and is  the culmination and supersession of all previous major systemic crises from the break up in 1971 of the Bretton Woods framework that attempted to avoid a relapse to the Great Depression pre-war years, to the financial shocks of the '80s and '90s (the 1984 Latin American ‘tequila crisis', the 1987 Crash, the 1997 Crash, centered in Asia and followed by Russia's default in 1998, the burst of the US ‘dot.com economy' in 2000, the recession of 2001-2002, Enron's debacle, Argentina's default etc) throughout the decades of finance globalization.<br>  <br>  Nobody can know when will it be over, it depends not only on the Governments but also on the response of working class all over the World.Right now there are riots on Latvia, and France.Were are just finishing the beginnings of this unstoppable and deepening world crisis.The first stage of these huge crisis is economical , it will be followed by an all out political crisis.

0YQRbq9faa	You need to find a good counselor to work on the anger and bitterness that you are keeping closed in your life.  You are a very sensitive person and feel things very deeply.  It sounds like the problem is you keep the emotions locked up inside so that you do not rock the boat and remain a "good girl" on the outside.  Find a very compassionate counselor to help you with that.  Family counseling might be best.|`|Q8fcepcZaa	i am exactly the same with that bus thing. when people i dont know have their eyes on me it makes me tense and i think of outrageous things that i would never actually do. like things that would get me in fights or in prison. its weird as hell.

b5ad6e44e0086d316700f9b6713407c6aa	Yes, we should stop. The concept of race has no biological basis.|`|DUSM3LUpaa	I think the problem with this idea is that, regardless of whether we have the word "race," our sociocultural history suggests that we will continue to classify people based on their skin color, and continue to disadvantage people in our society based on their skin color. And moreover, the disadvantages that already exist today will continue to exist unless we consciously act as we unconsciously act: understanding that we do make this racial division and that attending to it is the only way to achieve true equality.<br>  <br>  Furthermore, differentiating between peoples by continent (i.e. North American ethnic) erases everyone who isn't majority culture. It's really important that descendants of Africans, for example, have access to a history that is uniquely theirs, so they can contextualize their lives today.|`|0psxM4o4aa	I don't think that one word matters.

This is because the Americas were populated by people who crossed over in waves over (or near) the land bridge from Russia to Alaska (somewhere around 14-10,000 years ago, sometime during or after the last Ice Age, depending on which theory you adhere to), and these people in many of these waves were from the same gene pool as the ancestors of many Asians.

0UHuGfgPaa	before i am going to explain the reason why some gov'ts trying to increase social welfare while others trying to decrease, let me tell you the definition of social welfare.<br>  It is the total well being of the entire society. Social welfare is not measurable because it involves both objective and value judgments. It is not the same as standard of living but is more like quality of life that includes factors such as the quality of the environment (air, soil, water), level of crime, extent of drug abuse, availability of essential social services, as well as religious and spiritual aspects of life.<br>  the reason is that: -<br>  some gov'ts trying to increase the availability of social welfare when there is some character of economic recission i.e., to avoid crisis in economics, gov't is responsible to encourage investors through making essential materials available to them( such as infrastructure i.e. education, health, social overhead capital; tax reduction) which may increase social welfare<br>  in contrary to that some gov'ts trying to decrease social welfare when there is inflation .to minimize the rate of inflation, the gov't is responsible to collect money at the hands of public through different policies which may reduce social welfare.|`|qK1iEcVhaa	Increase : Because they want poor people to have a motivation to climb the ladder of class, it is like being an investor. ( Also balance out market, since they have money to spend)<br>  <br>  decrease: To save tax payer money what else lol, U.S. alone spends billion of dollar on welfare, and because welfare is so huge there a lot of loophole/corruption around which lead to a loss of investment. <br>  <br>  Not sure if it is of any references.

6a221e63714f9d33724ccb40cd162c0aaa	I live in a neighborhood full of rich-*** white people. Every family lives in a house that cost at least 500,000. The father is a businessman, the wife is a gorgeous blonde, all with cute little kiddies. Okay, it's stereotypical, but you know what I mean. Anyways, it's under lots of development, so there are lots of construction work and many Mexican/Hispanic people are around here, and all the people who live here are scared shitless of them.
fwkxK2cCaa	I don't know your age but considering the question that you ask in regards to people in society not doing enough for the needy is an issue that not a lot of people nowadays wants to be bothered with and much rather deal with their own personal issues----But NOT everyone is like that.  There are still good people out there who will volunteer their time freely and go over and beyond to help those who are less fortunate.   People from all walks of life and all different social classes are out there who unselfishly gives their time, donates money to various charities and foundations in their communities and around the world, and actively participate in community volunteer work.  People from very high social status such as Bill Gates and his wife, Brad Pitt and Angelina Jolie, Bono of U2, Celine Dion, Oprah Winfrey, Larry and Frances Jones, and many more that I can't list  are prime examples of people at their best and have done tremendous job of traveling to different parts of the world to reach out and help those in need.   <br>  <br>  Feed The Children is one of the biggest Christain, international, nonprofit relief organization that has been around for a long time (29 + yrs) and its primary focus is to take donated money and other necessities from people and evenly distribute it out to different geographical parts of the world.  For many years, some of your much poorer countries that couldn't afford hospitals, meals, clothes, and schools for children are now equiped with such possibilities and facilities due to the unselfish financial donations from people around the world.   <br>  <br>  I understand completely where you are coming from on your insight of the cruelties of such random act of mankind.   It is true that not everyone can be helped and not everyone can benefit from all the nonprofit organizations from across the country and around the world.  The financial donations from various charities will pretty much help those in need the most and work its way up to those in need the least.  Keep in mind that not everyone who lacks the essential needs will have access to them.  Famine, war, poverty, or natural disaster strucked areas will have precedents over just everyday folks and families who had just recently experienced short-comings in their lives.  <br>  <br>  So, I hope you understand and take into account why everyone, just because they need help, will not actually get help.  I realize it be can heartbreaking to see some homeless man standing at the street corner asking for changes from random strangers or families without powers and children going to bed every night feeling hungry, but that is the reality of life and will always be until there is a better solution to end poverty, war, famine, and natural disasters altogether.  For now, all we can do as individual is try to make a difference in the community by dedicating our free service and time to help those that are less fortunate.  That way we won't feel as bad the next time we see someone in need knowing that we did and tried our best by offering our selfless times and services.<br>  <br>  Btw, when I was younger I have always dreamed of being a volunteer worker for the Peace Corp in another country but some things happened and circumstances changes and I didn't get that opportunity....so presently, I give of myself and my services in another way....refer below.  If it matters to you that much, by all mean, I strongly suggest you find a way to offer your free services to the community and give something back.  The outpours of volunteering services are always appreciated and the good feeling of giving back is undescribable.....you'd have to do it to know.  And I really hope you do.

28b1dKT5aa	Destructive effects of globalisation<br>  <br>  <br>  the war on terrorism and in Iraq has distracted much of the world's attention from the pressing issue of how globalisation should be managed so that it benefits everyone. A new report, issued by the International Labour Organisation's commission on the social dimensions of globalisation, reminds us how far the Bush administration is out of line with the global consensus.<br>  <br>  The ILO is a tripartite organisation with representatives of labour, government and business. The commission, chaired by the presidents of Finland and Tanzania, has 24 members (of whom I was one) drawn from different nationalities, interest groups and intellectual persuasions, including members as diverse as the head of Toshiba and the leader of the American Federation of Labour Congress of Industrial Organisations. Yet this very heterogeneous group was able to crystallise the emerging consensus, that globalisation - despite its positive potential - has not only failed to live up to that potential, but has actually contributed to social distress. <br>  <br>  The fault lies with how globalisation has been managed - partly by countries but, most importantly, by the international community, including institutions such as the World Bank, the World Trade Organisation and the IMF, which are responsible for establishing the "rules of the game". The commission even reached consensus on a number of concrete measures to help put a "human face" on globalisation, or at least mitigate some of its worst effects. <br>  <br>  The gap between the emerging consensus on globalisation, which this report reflects, and the Bush administration's international economic policies, helps explain the widespread hostility towards America's government. <br>  <br>  Consider two issues that have been part of recent bilateral trade agreements pushed aggressively by the Bush administration. The crises in east Asia and the recent recessions in Latin America show that premature capital market liberalisation can result in economic volatility, increasing poverty, and destruction of the middle class. Even the IMF now recognises that capital market liberalisation has delivered neither growth nor stability to many developing countries. Yet, whether driven by narrow ideology or responding to the demands of special interests, the Bush administration is still demanding an extreme form of such liberalisation in its bilateral trade agreements. <br>  <br>  The second issue concerns the unbalanced intellectual property provisions (Trips) of the Uruguay round of trade talks, dictated by America's pharmaceutical and entertainment industries. These provisions restricted countries from making generic imitations of drugs, making many critically important medicines unaffordable in developing countries. <br>  <br>  Spearheaded by worries about Aids, activists demanded that something be done. Just before last year's trade talks in Mexico, the US made some concessions so that it was no longer the only hold-out. In its bilateral trade agreements, however, it is demanding what is becoming known as "Trips-plus", which would strengthen intellectual property rights further, to ensure that countries only have the right to produce inexpensive generic drugs during epidemics and other emergencies. <br>  <br>  The global consensus, reflected in the commission report, calls for more exceptions so that, say, drugs can be made available in any case where to do so could save a life. To those confronting the prospect of death, what matters is access to life-saving drugs, not whether what is killing the person is part of an epidemic. <br>  <br>  Bilateral agreements form the basis of enhanced ties of friendship between countries. But America's intransigence in this area is sparking protests in countries, such as Morocco, which face the threat of such an agreement; it is also forming the basis of long-lasting resentment. <br>  <br>  The commission highlights other issues that have received insufficient global attention - such as tax competition among developing countries, which shifts more of the tax burden from business to workers. In still other areas, the commission'sreport argues for more balanced perspectives. On exchange rates, for example, it is more sympathetic towards mixed systems, in contrast to the traditional belief that countries must choose between the extremes of a flexible system and a fixed exchange rate (of the kind that contributed so importantly to Argentina's woes). <br>  <br>  As this example shows, having different voices at the table in discussions of globalisation brings new perspectives. Until now, the main worry for most experts on globalisation has been excessive government intervention in the economy. The commission fears just the opposite. It argues that the state has a role to play in cushioning individuals and society from the impact of rapid economic change. <br>  <br>  The way that globalisation has been managed, however, has eroded the ability of the state to play its proper role. At the root of this problem is

2GNFQPdmaa	The previous answerer completely ignores the rising standard of living in the parts of the developing world that have embraced globalization most fully.<br>  <br>  That being said, Marx would have been opposed to the KIND of globalization we're having now, in just the same way the previous responder said, because it is an evolving global capitalist market. <br>  <br>  However, his dream was for the proletariat all over the world to unite into a world socialist order, so you could say he was very much in favor of a different kind of globalization.|`|pWBQzXXuaa	karl marx was against the fact that a small group of people controlled all resourses and power, while exploiting the weaker majority.<br>  <br>  if you look at the reality of globalisation, you will find that a small number of powerful countries like the USA, UK, Japan and Germany are the only ones really benefiting from globalisation through finding global markets and finding cheap labour and raw materials, while poor countries are being exploited and are actually getting poorer.<br>  <br>  Therefore yes i believe that karl marx would be against globalisation the way it is today because only a small group of countries have all the power and wealth.<br>  <br>  but if globalisation was different and it created a better life for everyone in the world, buy giving them better products, technology and knowledge then karl marx would have supported this. but unfortunately this is not reality<br>  <br>  hope this helped you

But the answer depends on <br>  1) What are you really interested in? If you're taking a lot of courses that don't really interest you, you're unlikely to do as well or learn as much as you <br>  <br>  2) How strong are the departments? Great econ courses are better than mediocre math courses, and vice versa.<br>  <br>  3) What kind of grad work are you interested in? The advice would be different if you are interested in an applied econ MA, a PhD or an MBA.<br>  <br>  Good luck.

Next time, I would walk right up to them and say "Not as ugly as your Mother!!!"|`|AA11367901	Yes, it would hurt me very bad. I hate to think that I'm ugly. If I heard someone calling me names it would not do me any good at all. Race or no race<br>  I'm very sorry this happened. Sometimes people are so cruel.|`|f2959c3466eb9458fc5521de90e563d3aa	When I was younger, yes it would have. I am older wiser and stronger now though.<br>  <br>  On a bad day it might knock me back a bit. But I would bounce back.|`|GqTSa85daa	F em, opinions are like A Holes, everybody' got one.|`|F5GyrdQfaa	It's not what they say, it's that they derive so much pleasure in insulting you that bothers me. It shows a lack of morality and decency, and those are necessary qualities of a free society. That they feel they can just say whatever they want is an indication of the lack of any guiding values, and they'll most likely shoot themselves in the foot at some point.<br>    I'm not black, and it strikes me as odd that people would want to behave in such a way. Can they truly not empathize with your point of view and understand that their actions have effects? Used to call that sociopathy back in the day.|`|JWNzoksmaa	yes, i familiar how your ppl act.  I lived in an all black neighborhood when i was growing up....black ppl can be very vicious...it would hurt my feelings when they would make fun of the fact you can see my veins in my wrist and behind my knees (i'm very pale white girl) they would say it was gross and stuff like that.  But i suppose i would rather be made fun of to my face than behind my back like white ppl do.  At least, when i the black kids would make fun of me the way i looked...i was able to defend myself and make fun of them to their faces.  Granted i got into some fights with some home girls..but after i kick the *hit out of one girl and really laid into a boy who was making fun of me i sort of gained their respect and they didn't make fun of me anymore. <br>  <br>  So i guess what i'm trying to say is...black ppl respect you if you stand up to them and fight back either with words or fists.  So maybe you should have made fun of them when they making fun of you.  You may have gained their respect...or got the *hit beat out of you.  But at least you stood up for yourself.  Yah know.  <br>  <br>  NEway, the fact that 27 year old males are acting like children is fairly disturbing...yah know.  That sort of behavior you would expect out of a teenage boys or younger.|`|ou0Wy3B0aa	I get the same way dude.  I get insecure about myself when others call me things hurtful.  Since i dont know you, i cant say if i think your ugly or not, but you are most likely not, and the group of ignorants just want to get in a laugh, and will do that by making fun of others.  And about the race thing, many times people say "since im black i can make fun of other black people" (not be prejudiced against black people at all). Dont be mad at those people, pity their ignorance =)<br>  Hope this helps!|`|58YiE4pFaa	strangers, not so much. i would probably yell at them or something, to show them not to say stupid things like that. if it were someone i cared about, i think i would care more, but someone i cared about would not say something like that to me so blatantly. he/she may avoid me, or make an excuse not to talk to me or whatever. <br>  <br>  and as for the issue about the race... im just throwing this out there, could it have anything to do with segregation and everything and like, how the african americans were treated back?|`|1Dv1Hx0yaa	First of all, How rude! I would never ever call someone ugly just for a laugh, obviously these guys had not much else going on and probably all rode the bus home to their crappy apartments somewhere and did beer bongs and watched a porn cuz they cant get any... Dont let anyone every make you feel down. There is beauty in everyone, even us not so gorgous people... Dont focus on it let it roll off, just think how much pain they are in to put others down and how ignorant they are. keep your head up!|`|987475b0db71996a7db0e2e10c1d960eaa	If someone called me ugly I would laugh at them because they have nothing better to do with their lives than call people stupid things.<br>  <br>  My friends do that to me all the time and I reverse the effect and instead of acting appalled I pretend it's a compliment. It's funny to watch their faces with their reaction.|`|LxexGPd6aa	Hi Diamond,<br>  <br>  Yes, It would definitly bother me because like you said you where just sitting down minding your own business and then just started to pick on you. I am sure you are a beautiful girl and that they where probably trying to get your attention and see what ur reaction was.<br>  <br>  good luck and keep smiling:)<br>  <br>  MiMi|`|LRCkSb42aa	I am sorry someone called you ugly. Yes it would hurt my feelings and I bet it did yours. I would just look over and smile at them and then get off at your stop. I am a loud mouth and I would tell them they were ugly to but that might cause a fight or something not worth it.|`|dEfq3UJgaa	I think it would bother me. But we're all God's children , and in His eyes, none of us are ugly. He sees beauty in everything.<br>  <br>  We need to .|`|pNKCKccZaa	im not ugly|`|54fb3ea85549743b677d80a7f77b2b37aa	Yeah that sucks... I never had the problem with any race not even my own but I can imagine. You can do one of two things... turn it back on them by saying something smart like " hehe hell have you looked in the mirror lately" lol... or just ignore them turn positions or walk away. People are bored and since their lives lack sustenance they do something that sounds fun. <br>  <br>  To be honest I best you if any one of them was on the bus by themselves they would not have said one word to you or about you. Its the show-off/out in the group that likes attention and appraisal. If he knows something will get a good laugh he will do it and all the other guys will chime in and then its a big woo-hoo...stupid really. Once again, I;m sorry.
zndg56eVaa	Yea i am smart, but people make fun of me, they think i don't have a life, well i do. Also when i was in elementary school, i had a high squeaky voice so people called me gay X_X and i am still called gay today but i am like **** You because im not gay You Mofo! The friends i made know i am not gay and that is what really matters =).  I don't really care what  other people think about me now. So i advise you to just be yourself, you don't have to be quiet around people, its ok to talk =D. Or just a friend, then their friends will slowly become your friends =). Gl!|`|58YiE4pFaa	the people that i have cared about, sometimes when they take me the wrong way i dont like it. but still, i know that the people that do like me and or are friends with me, know who i am on the surface and underneath, and like all of it, not just the me inside, but they know what i am like and are fine with it.|`|n2y17YsOaa	Show off your personality and those people will do the same. If you act quiet and fragile round them they will do the same to you.
rLP9wjPtaa	Yeah, as if islamic banking is doing any better...|`|rc4B8Vdaaa	No , usury is not responsible,Capitalists are doing the best they can in this phase , the phase of Capitalism`s irreversible decline , the cyclic crisises  of Capitalism are beyond their means.History cant go backwards , those that believe in a "regulated" Capitalism ignore what they are talking about.

It's true. Just look at sports.) "<br>  <br>  Throwing a ball around is something that a trained primate can do.  Speaking well, communicating effectively and getting your point across with assertion, as opposed to aggression, takes skill and intelligence.<br>  <br>  "As it stands right now, how many people give feminism a second thought."<br>  <br>  There are websites, countless books, message boards, and foundations dedicated to feminism.  It may not mean anything to you, but it matters to many, many people.|`|9679eed4decfc91fdcea2e17ae362313aa	Still having sexy thoughts about leading a pack of feminist women?|`|1HfLkTrdaa	Some think there's already too much of a masculine attitude. That's part of the problem because it damages the credibility of feminism. How? Because the women get scared that if they call themselves feminists then they'll be seen as unfeminine or wannabee men which of course is not at all true.<br>  <br>  I'd still say that old saying "never underestimate the power of a woman" is very true.  While in general, many women may not be as openly aggressive as men, some women can be pretty vengeful when enraged and when they're ready to give a payback, they'll find subtle ways to wreak as much havoc as a physically aggressive male.  This goes for feminists as well as so-called "traditional" women.|`|67204bd052a33365d7bd0f82da0dcc95aa	So women are not capable leaders...based on what evidence, there have not been many of us, and those that have lead have usually been reviled for the fact they are women and their politics were not popular?<br>  Or you follow age old sexist beliefs that women are no good at leading because we are too feeble emotionally, or physically, indeed, intellectually?<br>  Well, isn't that strange? Hitler was not a nice man, Stalin could be a  bit cruel, Saddam Hussein was murderous and corrupt, George W Bush was a dumb as a bag of hammers and Robert Mugabe is not very good at sharing and caring, and is obviously unstable...but none of these tell you that men may not be very good at being leaders.<br>  And leaders have to be aggressive, and perhaps  played sport, women not being good at that. So, how long would you last playing tennis against Venus Williams, or playing against UK female rugby team who have been known to train with the Marines, one or two have completed SAS training and that is tough...So, women need a man to take charge because then people may care? don't worry there are enough of us to 'keep getting in your face' without a man helping us defenceless wee things out!<br>  Why do you insist on this idea that when women play contact sports they will do so as if they are taking tea with the vicar...you are so confident that you would 'knock the crap out of them' eh? Bonny lad...I would pay to see it...oh! and also help you pick your teeth and your bollocks up! lol...Anyway thought you recognised women were very capable, but now I see you were fibbing, you think we are all weak and femmer!

DEc1C9hkaa	No.<br>  <br>  A spanking is one thing, this is another.|`|V1MptCMiaa	My parents used to smack my behind with a paddle.  It hurt, but they didn't hit me until I feel to the floor.|`|xCd7m5dkaa	Offcourse it is ok for parents to spank there kids only for discipline purposes.<br>  <br>  I agree with Nataly.<br>  <br>  How come you never see the kids of Indian or Chinese immigrants misbehave or become spoilt like that. Because they get spanked and turn out to be disciplined successful people.<br>  <br>  <br>  There is a fine line between abuse and spanking. Alot of people these days mistake spanking for abuse.|`|T6xd0OxWaa	so the video you're referring to.   He wouldn't even call that a slap more like a tap. <br>  I had pretty much the same done to me when I was a kid and I turned out just fine.   Though I only had it done to slap my hands away from stuff I was reaching for.<br>  <br>  Though for falling off a bed that's just out of line.   Plus I remember a time a near step mom of mine beat me for missing the toilette when I was 7.    My dad told her if she Ever touched me again it'd be her last breath.   (I lived with my mom and dad at different points each year).<br>  <br>  Heck the few times I really deserved to get hit as a kid I never was hit instead my mom would just look at me and walk away making me feel guilty and like she was disappointed.   Trust me that is far worse than a little slap on the hand or a spanking.    Heck that was even worse then when my almost step mom beat me till I was nearly unconscious.<br>  <br>  <br>  At most if I have a kid I might smack their hand away from something, not to hurt them just enough to get them to understand if they keep reaching their hand will keep getting smacked away.|`|f6f40965eb7d5df6aa94440ec71e32dcaa	I'm 100% against hitting anyone, unless in self-defense, so I don't think it's okay.  Beating kids is an abuse of power.  If you are bigger and stronger, why hit them?  You're an adult; use your words.  <br>  <br>  Hitting kids is basically ensuring that you'll spend your 'Golden Years' eating green jello and getting slapped around by nursing attendants.|`|Olz3goEaaa	I used to think spanking was okay, but more and more I think hitting people is just wrong unless its an MMA deal.|`|fDGPbwdsaa	No.<br>  <br>  A spank should be more than enough. Moderation is the key.|`|7aVOCIh4aa	hitting a child is perfectly normal but not till she falls off the bed !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

And to be honest, who makes fun of the Japanese? Or Asian-descents in general.

I wish you well and hope  you stop taking the comments and abuse to heart. it is not in fact aimed  at you personally ( even though they indicate it is!) but is a symptom of these troubled times and there inability to deal  with it.|`|GRECLt2Uaa	this could be that when you were a child the fact that you were asian and different from the hegemony that exist here in America did not matter to you or was even an issue to you, your mind could not grasp it yet.  Now in your adolescence you are becoming aware of who you are and who your surroundings are.  I feel really bad that you have to go through this and that this is a fact in American social life, but unfortunately there are still many people who judge or shun people because they are different. The kids that make their comments and pick on you are more than likely just repeating the things they hear in the home and the places they spend their time.  This is very sad and it will probably not stop ever, only as you become an adult you will not hear comments out loud anymore but you will experience stares and non verbal communication but just remember that this country is made up of immigrants yet there happen to be more of the white immigrants than any other ethnicity so you will be considered different and a minority.  the only thing you can do is remain strong and throughout your life stand up for people who cannot stand up for themselves and do not tolerate any type of intolerance in your own life whether that be religion, sexual preference, ethnicity, gender, income or social status.  Good luck.|`|f2959c3466eb9458fc5521de90e563d3aa	You are a teen - your hormones etc...are at their highest.

Don't worry, this will pass. The age you are at is a rough one. Everyone gets picked on for something at that age and made to feel small. For you, they just decided to pick race. For someone else they might pick on them because of their weight. Even if you weren't Asian it would be something that they would use against you.<br>  <br>  Just hang in there till you get to college. It gets much better then.

We live we get over it, some people have it worse than others, agreed. But if it is bothering you so much talk to someone about it, not a bunch of teenagers and people who are bored like me. <br>  Just talk back to the people who are saying things to you, that is the best defense. because at that point you don't look weak, make sure it is more intelligent than what they said ALWAYS. and you will come out on top,.|`|jZZ6KZVxaa	<a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=If9KopxdA..." rel="nofollow">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=If9KopxdA...</a>

Not other people whether they are male or female.|`|0cfwrcx5aa	when you're flaunting everything you've got, in a barely concealing outfit, and you're at the club, dancing and grinding up against everyone around you,  dont be surprised when you get ambushed on the way to your car and raped.   you brought it on yourself.|`|Pl4jVVGYaa	Just being a women is gonna get you comments both negative and positive, .|`|wSFRpiIXaa	Yes.

I don't have the option of deciding whether a man finds me attractive or not.  They can't read my mind and know if I'm interested or not.<br>  <br>  I can't control what they say or do, only how I let it effect me.

I would perhaps seek legal counseling. GL :)|`|DEc1C9hkaa	Did they actually use the term 'male author' or did you edit this in because you don't want to use his name?<br>  <br>  Maybe they are in the middle of launching the other authors book tour and can't take the time to review your book at the moment.  First come, first serve kind of thing.    That's pretty much what they said.|`|CHlxBbkHaa	Did he tell you it was a male author or did he just say something like "Because we are going towards starting a book tour with John Smith."  That would have nothing to do with you being a woman.  I'd say it more or less has to do with the writing.|`|f6f40965eb7d5df6aa94440ec71e32dcaa	I'm assuming that, by 'male author', you meant that your agent said the author's name, but you left it out.

rgA4jIsyaa	sounds to me like they were just being drunk protective friends, it's really not that big of a deal, why the hell would you dwell on something so trivial. The woman herself didn't protest.

That's gross no offence.<br>  You shouldn't have done it obviously but it's good you are feeling "depressed" because it means you know that you've done wrong. I would say apologize to the lady but i don't think it would be a good idea to get back in contact.<br>  Pray that everything is okay and ask for forgiveness deeply.|`|Po2UqfvWaa	stupid things happen when people drink too much. avoid drinking in the future. i think she'll get over it. it does suck to be violated by a drunk. let it go because you can't change it, just learn from it|`|0cfwrcx5aa	next time, rape the girl, that way you have a legitimate reason for the self-loathing and second guessing.<br>  <br>  this is actually pretty pathetic.  you're worried about violating a woman, because you kissed her while you were drunk, over a year ago.<br>  <br>  grow up.|`|c96a826a1b2655ff81b951010262f941aa	Can you find her... do you know her name ? if you can try to find her, she is the only one that can answer your question.... no one else can for you...<br>  <br>  Honestly yes she could have let you do by shyness by being scared of your reaction, i have let once a guy kissed me and touched me even if i did not feel like it just because i did not know what to do... and i was just way too shy to say anything....<br>  <br>  In another hand, there is a height level of chance that she did not mind at all... she was not 14 like i was... so she could have give excuses to run away, say oh i must go to the bathroom... or something and just disappear.... she could have found any reason to go away.... so i think she was ok with it... but if you could find her it would be best for you, as everyone will give you what they though but you will keep posting that question because deep down inside you know that we don't really know and cannot really answer that question.|`|qjcTW2vJaa	You should NOT feel guilty about this! You were making out after  few drinks and there is nothign to it! You didn't violate anyone, she didn't say anything at the moment (such as "stop" or "dont touch/ kiss me") so that is called consent. If she was at a bar I cannot imagine she is some kind of wall flower who had never been kissed before, so please don't worry about this. It's not worth ruining your life over this, I am sure she is not giving this a second thought!!|`|EvpoKO4Jaa	ugh you're kind of like me obsessing over stupid things...she could have stopped you but she didn't.you would be guilty of violating her if even after she refused, you went ahead and forced yourself on her.
wKN7n2RKaa	I had tried growing some baby trees that I got really cheap to put in my backyard.  Some had died, but there was one that looked really nice, and I knew that was the one I wanted for the best spot.  When I tried to dig it up, I underestimated what it would take to dig it up, and I ruined the root ball.  I found myself crying, and couldn't figure out why.  I have known some people who say there are spirits in trees.  Personally, I don't know.  <br>  <br>  I just feel that we should all realize that we are part of a bigger world than just people "up here" and everything else doesn't matter.  I try to pick up spiders and bring them outside the house.  But there are bugs that I have squashed.  I take it as a responsibility, and often, in my head, tell them that this is it, that if they are still there before I squash them, then their allotted time is up.  I don't say or do this lightly.  Sometimes we are instruments of spirit movers.  We have to eat, so creatures and plants die.  Humanity is the one existence where it can be said that we consider others and things outside of ourselves, when we are our best.  That's what the Buddhists say is mindfulness.<br>  <br>  I'd say that if you don't try to kill anything without some consideration.  Don't kill for fun and certainly don't torture.  Animals kill prey for food and protection.  Be mindful to do your best, and make peace with the universe.|`|F9D7OZejaa	Whether animals feel pain or not is irrelevant what matters is that if someone derives pleasure from the pain of a lesser/equal/greater creature than they. If they feel bad than that means all the chemicals in your head are working, if you don't that means that they are not working.<br>  Everything in the entire existence of the universe is relative. Some people like to think there are laws of morality and other choose to believe that these "laws" were somehow beneficial at one point in our evolutionary stage. Killing for food only made sure that we didn't loose our food supply to fun. Now that we don't do that hunting fulfills this instinct to kill, while trying to compensate for the devastating effects of eliminating natural predators to certain game. For example squirrels and coyotes, squirrels can live in cities, coyotes cant. Giving low level trophy animals large places of sanctuary ***** ups the ecosystem, so don't feel bad about the ant, feel bad about the non-cute coach roaches that no one cares about, its easy to kill things when you're instinct is to dislike the disease carriers. All part of evolution, cute puppy = mutually beneficial relation ship.<br>  <br>  I think its actually really funny that we have humane shelters for animals that are cute, but kill all the small creatures such as insects by the thousands, like intelligence measures the worth of a thing. Can't wait for the day when aliens burn the world using the excuse that we are so dumb compared to them so its OK.<br>  <br>  Somewhere in the clusterf**k was a answer... I believe. Point was that you don't need anyone telling you anything about morality, its what YOU think is right.|`|Q8fcepcZaa	dont feel bad about an ant, it doesnt have feelings, its behaviour is purely chemical. it wont be missed. its different killing something like a dog, but in killing an ant you might as well be killing bacteria.|`|c96a826a1b2655ff81b951010262f941aa	So funny ! yeah i feel the same sometimes.... I killed a small snake once, i did kill it because it bite me... enough to bled, but this small snake was not dangerous at all... just hurt me badly, i was really young like maybe 8 years old... and you know what, i still feel bad about it... I got so hurt so angry that i throw it down, and then step on it a few times... i know its ugly... and then i cried i sat down took it... and tried to shake it but it was dead.... and honestly really i still feel so sad ive done that....<br>  <br>  I don't know if some of us are too sentimental no idea... I think i am not allowed to decide who will live and who will die, so if i kill a creature by mistake or that unique time where even if i did not really want to kill it i did... well i just feel really bad, because i never want to be responsible for the death of any creature or animals or human....

We like to say that this is a sign of our "ballsiness" but, in fact, it may just simply be that men make quick decisions and fail to consider the repercussions of dangerous acts whereas ladies are a bit more timid and think things through before doing something dangerous.  I'm not sure that this is always a great quality for men, but this is why I think men tend to be more likely to engage in dangerous acitivies.<br>  <br>  In answer to the bonsus question, I would rather eat the cold tripe dish as it's common in the old country (I don't care for it though).|`|f6f40965eb7d5df6aa94440ec71e32dcaa	""Only in the west are the woman scummy and nasty.

Naturally any amount of emotions will be involved.  But what is a crisis to one, may not be to another.

F9D7OZejaa	Most likely they would communicate their thoughts to themselves through there other sense like image of a T.V. rather than the word T.V. Or they can use sign  language in their head or w/e. Sound waves are just the most convenient way of communicating ideas, not the only way. Now what would be interesting is if a deaf,blind,mute,paraplegic, with no sense of smell and was born that way. I can't imagine a worse fate on anyone.<br>  <br>  To answer your additional details, I don't know about you but my voice-thoughts are actually not my voice. They are a bunch of processes and concepts immediately translated into an easily communicable form. I hear what I THINK my voice is. If I lose my hearing, or go mute, I would still have the same voice in my head. But beyond guessing you really couldn't ask and explain it to a person who is deaf their whole life sense they don't know what sound is other than its vibrations, sorta like describing colors to a blind person.|`|AA11262313	Hearing your thoughts and hearing sound waves are totally different things.

89d5d13a4687baff0ec7696bbf4973beaa	Creo que podría serlo, ya que te alivia de un peso, tanto a ti como a la persona que perdonas. Está claro que cada uno ha de ser responsable de sus actos, pero si nos centramos en lo que hacemos mal no tendremos resultados tan positivos. Además, creo que perdonar te hace sentir mejor porque te engrandece como persona, ya que así superarás las tensiones acumuladas y conseguirás un sentimiento de serenidad.|`|2ae01423ddcbbb8fd14615986c3238e1aa	Cuando estás enfadado sólo acumulas odio, y eso es malo porque acaba minando tu vida. Es imprescindible perdonar para seguir viviendo, ya que si aguantas este odio te acabarás haciendo da?o, y también a las personas que están a tu alrededor. Es importante perdonar de verdad, porque si no será un gesto vacío que no servirá de nada.|`|95ff7800e452edb0eea34c57109eef9baa	Perdonar limpia el alma… sólo tenéis que consultar la biblia.|`|1b15b8f0f926d81f347ad1d7b57df107aa	Alivia mucho de las tensiones y el estrés. Además, así se acaba con el enfado, que es una de las peores cosas del mundo.|`|adfeb2a7a125271197b5c358da1849fbaa	El único que se beneficia al perdonar es uno mismo, porque normalmente la persona con la que estás enfadada no sabe por qué estás tan enfadado, así que eres el único que no podrá dormir y se estará preocupando. Puede estar bien para relajarse e intentar ver las cosas de manera más tranquila. La vida es muy corta para estar enfadado!!!|`|ebcabe8e114515d64c70eadb12f56900aa	No creo que el rencor sea algo bueno porque acaba con uno mismo. A mí me costó mucho tiempo aprender a perdonar porque la angustia y el odio me bloquearon durante mucho tiempo, pero me parece que todo eso fue una pérdida de tiempo y un desgaste de mis emociones que no mereció nada la pena. Así que creo que aprender a perdonar puede ser muy útil para las personas que se encuentren bloqueadas o estén pasando por una situación difícil.
95ff7800e452edb0eea34c57109eef9baa	Intenta ayudar y observar cómo viven.

1HfLkTrdaa	So now feminism is to blamed for what is in reality boorishness on the part of the man?  Oh, please!!! <br>  <br>  Maybe you need to look at how things really WERE "traditionally" instead of romanticizing it.<br>  <br>  Despite all this talk of "chivalry" most of the men were NOT chivalrous! Even in the so-called 'good old days' men weren't always gentlemen, especially those in the lower classes...and even some of them called "gentlemen" made every excuse in the book for their "ungentlemanly" actions! <br>  <br>  They didn't have to be "chivalrous."  Know why? Because women were considered their PROPERTY as were the children! So they got away with treating them any the hell way they wanted!!! A lot of men in the olden days often drank and gambled away their checks, and they didn't care. Up until the 1950s, men could lay claim to their wives paychecks as their property as well...and they profligately spent those checks, too without consideration of anyone's plans or feelings!<br>  <br>  Instead of getting a divorce, those men frequently abandoned wives, too, and left them destitute!  In fact the reasons the founding fathers instituted divorce as far back as 1640 was because of the tendency of men in the Colonies to just up and leave a wife and set up house with another woman while still legally married to first.  Bigamy was a HUGE problem in the 18th and 19th Centuries.<br>  <br>  Don't act like men are the victims of women because you know darn well that's just so much bull!!  Men can and often DO "whatever the hell they want" and there's nothing to be done about it.  It's a big reason why women MUST be independent...so they don't keep getting taken advantage of by men who make promises and then renegs on them.<br>  <br>  Most women today KNOW they can't count on a man to "rescue" them and only the most foolish of women still believe that.<br>  <br>  Also, if it comes down to if having a man open the door for me means that I have to forever close other "doors" such as equal opportunity, then forget it!  I'll keep opening my own doors, thank you!|`|f6f40965eb7d5df6aa94440ec71e32dcaa	Which women expect men to provide for them?  There are way too many women out there with their own jobs/careers/homes, etc. for this 'theory' of yours to hold true.  Sure, there are women stuck in that mentality of "I need a man to support me financially", but there are several that do things for themselves.<br>  <br>  I can assure you that most of the women that want men to do EVERYTHING for them are not liberated or independent at all.|`|T6xd0OxWaa	Depends on the woman I guess.<br>  <br>  Though where chivalry is concerned I treat men and woman the same way.   I'm just a polite person.   I hold open doors for both genders. <br>  As for paying for meals I was raised in a family where everyone jumped when the bill came and tried to be the one to pay.     I remember my mom stuffing a 20 in my grandmas purse cause she wouldn't let my mom pay the bill.|`|M7lOK6DWaa	Thats not true at all, I have been dating my boyfriend for two years and we have taken turns paying for the meals. Sometimes i pay for the whold date, sometimes he does and sometimes we go half and half. It is really sterotypical of you to say that. I suggest you stick with what you know and get a job. Jeez u sicken me.|`|er2H1gQ1aa	I am no feminist by any means, but I don't know any women, including myself who expect men to provide for them!  I'd rather have a man do the dishes and laundry while I'm at work.  I don't know where you got this idea.|`|AKvLiwB6aa	theres nothing wrong with a woman looking for a gud provider in a husbend...   she wants her children to grow up with the things they need in life...  an she wants a gud home for her an her kids...   so of corse shell want a man that makes gud mony...   thats jus being smart...<br>  <br>  maybe things will change when we finly get real equality an we start geting paid the same as men do...|`|GUTITGDlaa	I think that my husband and I have traditional roles in our marriage (I'm 30 he's 33). I cook, clean, do the laundry. My husband takes out the garbage, walks the dogs and does the outdoor maintenance. We like it that way. It shows that we care for each other by doing these things to take care of the other. He opens doors, brings me flowers - I greet him when he gets home with "how was your day" and a kiss- it's romantic! It shows that we care enough for each other to do those things. <br>  <br>  A lot of women work now and have a lot more on their shoulders then they did in the 50's. I'm not sure what type of person you are talking about by saying they are "liberated and independent" but still can do "whatever the hell they want" - that's freedom, baby. That has nothing to do with being treated with love and respect and doing "traditional" things to show your spouse your love for them...<br>  <br>  A normal relationship has a balance of both, I think. Chivalry and freedom - no one should walk over another. If you don't think your relationship is equal - then you should speak with your spouse (kindly) and come up with a better compromise of your situation.<br>  <br>  Good luck!|`|rKaUdhLUaa	I don't expect a man to provide for me nor do I want a man to provide for me. I hate when I'm dating and a guy tries to always pay for EVERYTHING, at least let me get coffee or drinks. I don't want a man to ever think I'm with him because I need him. I want him to know I'm with him because I want him.<br>  My half sister is quite the opposite, she expects the man to pay for everything. It could be the way we were raised.|`|p3NW0Mstaa	Um.. maybe you had better date a better class of "Independent" women.  I had a job when my man met me, have never gone with out one even when the kids were little, I worked part time around his schedule and did most of the child raising like our mothers did.   Now that they are grown I pay half of the bills and he does help with the house cleaning.    I open the door for him when his hands are full and I thank him when he does it for me.   this my good man is a equal relationship, I do ask him to help when things are to heavy, but he has the upper body strength.. that is only fair.|`|aae04e3689e2835b454c72ee27fc318aaa	Ummm...I believe in being liberated and independent so I don't expect anyone else to provide for me. <br>  <br>  Maybe some women still want men to provide for them but they aren't me. <br>  <br>  Remember that all women are separate humans and capable of thinking differently. It isn't that hard.|`|CHlxBbkHaa	I have a job.  I can provide for myself.  I've even opened doors for guys.

AA10421757	Well Babebear...I can understand your pain...You are hurting right now and you might even hate this guy for what he has done to you. I'm sure you realize that by hating him, that means that you still care for him in some way. The only thing you can do is allow your feelings to work themselves out on their own time...Don't force it. Eventually you will get over it. It make take quite some time...Giving your trust to someone is never easy which is why it hurts so much when that trust is betrayed.<br>  If you think you will feel better, you can talk sh*t to him on his myspace account and just get all your feelings out there, but I wouldn't suggest doing that. Later on, when you are doing so much better than he is, that will be the best revenge.<br>  Another thing you can do is go to dontdatehimgirl.com make up a fake name and put him on there and tell everyone how little his ding-a-ling really is. You can even put a picture up.<br>  That should make you feel better. That way, he never has to know it was you, but other women may see it and know all about him!<br>  Good luck.|`|52774fe87f249e35b82bf07213627189aa	He wronged you no doubt about it.  But now you know he is nowhere worthy of you in any respect so don't wrong yourself more by giving him another thought.  He did you a favor by letting you know that you are not missing a damn thing by losing Mr. 2inch.<br>  <br>  I know that doesn't help how you feel at the moment.  Try to remember he is not only a jerk but really stupid to lose such a good thing.|`|14cf56a31f17f2bbf644d6bcf1165325aa	I can understand your pain and anger that is a fact! Many of us have been there and these types of men THE LIARS AND CHEATS. The anger CAN hang on for many years if we let it however anger just eats us up inside!  That kind of man is not worth all the energy you put in to him as he is a looser for sure! I imagine he thinks he must conquer woman because he knows he is inferior. Men who lack in the weener have about the same size brain!<br>  <br>  I am sorry you are in pain but try to let it go even tho it may take a long time. I have been there and felt the fool and I got even with my ex. Revenge sometimes can help although some say it is not nice or healthy! OH WELL do what you have too and giving us his myspace page is a good start. I am going to go to it now and take a look and if there is a place for a messege believe ME I will send him one he won't forget.|`|d13e3dcc989f81486c1daf3389c49d1baa	im deeply sorry for what youre going thru. its natural to wallow in anger after what has been done to you. I suggest that you keep yourself busy, do some physical activity, go to parties and maybe start dating. and ignore him. good luck =)

AA10323577	my brother is a psychologist....he always says he has to deal with  everyone's stubbed toes....when he feels overwhelmed, he takes a sabbatical and removes himself from the profession for a time...he has done this work now for 30 years and is very good at it...but his last "time-off" was 4 months in length...not the "norm" to take off THAT much time, but he needed it this time around|`|AA10894849	Many psychologists are in therapy themselves.  Psychologists are people too, with people problems.  Sometimes they do get overwhelmed and have to see a therapist.  They also cope just like everyone else... relying on social support, hobbies, problem solving, etc.|`|71fab0c536943fd995f52376e6026a6baa	As part of there training psychologists have to go into therapy to be evaluated and also know what it feels like being a patient.  A very popular therapy nowadays is  <br>  Cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT) <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/cognitive_b..." rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/cognitive_b...</a> worked best for me. I suffered from social anxiety for over 15 years. I've tried meds, individual therapy, and group therapy and studied psychology for 10 years, as a profession, but also with the hope to cure myself.<br>  <br>  Depending on your comfort level, you could go to a psychologist that practices CBT and specializes in anxiety disorders, seek a group therapy, or create one. Usually those that do attend the group therapy are a bit more high functioning because as you know, it can be difficult to speak in a group.<br>  <br>  Another idea is to see if there are any local research studies being conducted that you could participate in.<br>  <br>  The program that finally worked the best for me is this one: <a href="http://www.socialanxiety.us/findinghelp...." rel="nofollow">http://www.socialanxiety.us/findinghelp....</a> and I was lucky enough to have a structured behavioral group to go along with it.

qEp8YX9Kaa	Adrenaline is released.<br>  <br>  Adrenaline is a "fight or flight" hormone which is released from the adrenal glands whenever danger threatens. When secreted it floods out the endocrine gland into the bloodstream to instantly prepare the body for action in emergency situations. The hormone boosts the supply of oxygen and energy-giving glucose to the muscles making the individual more mentally alert and physically strong; only vital bodily processes occur.<br>  <br>  Adrenaline plays a central role in the short-term stress reaction—the physiological response to threatening, exciting, or environmental stressor conditions such as high noise levels or bright light (see Fight-or-flight response). It is secreted by the adrenal medulla. When released into the bloodstream, Adrenaline binds to multiple receptors and has numerous effects throughout the body. It increases heart rate and stroke volume, dilates the pupils, and constricts arterioles in the skin and gut while dilating arterioles in leg muscles. It elevates the blood sugar level by increasing catalysis of glycogen to glucose in the liver, and at the same time begins the breakdown of lipids in fat cells. Like some other stress hormones, Adrenaline has a suppressive effect on the immune system|`|f01deed20102d74c6a7425a5b72d7a80aa	It has a lot to do with the rise in adrenaline and the Fight, or Flight reaction to what your mind perceives as danger. That is what your body thinks is happening when you are nervous.|`|609757080bddab76c6146f3543b126aeaa	when a person gets nervous his fight or flight response takes over and cause addrenaline( word might be misspelled) to inrease which in return causes your body to act and your heart to beat faster so you can be more prepared to fight or fly.
