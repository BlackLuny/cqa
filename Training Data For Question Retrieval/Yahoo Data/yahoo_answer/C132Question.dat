20061114065659AAabmZ7	Pregnancy & Parenting;Pregnancy	Etre grand-mère !?	Bonjour,   Ma fille va avoir 18 ans ce mois-ci, et est enceinte depuis un mois. Elle va quitter le domicile de son père, chez qui elle vivait, pour s'installer avec son petit ami. Je trouve cela génial, toutes mes amies me disent que c'est débile. J'aurais 42 ans quand le bébé va arriver, et je suis ravie ! Ce qui choque tout le monde ! J'aimerais avoir votre avis, en précisant quand même que ma fille Juliette et son ami Charles voulaient ce bébé, ce n'est pas un accident. Merci de bien vouloir me dire si vous trouvez que c'est une bonne nouvelle, tout comme moi, ou que c'est une bêtise et une catastrophe comme la plupart de mes amis...

20080707080538AAM16xy	Pregnancy & Parenting;Parenting	I want to get paid for babysitting. How should I handle this?	A child I've been watching is completely out of control with severe behavior problems. I have been talking to his parents about it for weeks, indicating that if things do not improve soon I will not be able to watch him any longer.      Finally, last week, I was planning to tell the parents that they should start looking for a new daycare. However, they did not pay for me for the week when they picked him up, so I decided NOT to say anything yet. I have a feeling they are the type who won't pay if I tell them not to bring their son back again -- and I want to get paid for the days he was here!      His mother is on vacation this week so she'll be watching him, which means he's not due back until next week. What do you suggest I do???

20090205140314AAZlFtp	Pregnancy & Parenting;Toddler & Preschooler	How soon do I need to switch my 2 year old daughter to a toddler bed?	My daughter just turned 2 in January and still sleeps in her crib. I am 15 weeks pregnant with #2 and know that I will have to switch her probably sooner rather than later, but I feel like she isn't ready yet. I know that if I tried her in her own toddler bed it would be a neverending battle of getting her to stay in bed and not get out and play with toys in her room. She isn't exactly cooperative and she would rather do her own thing than listen to me.  She has shown no interest in climbing out of her crib yet. Do you think I can wait a little while longer before trying to transition her, as the new baby isn't due until the end of July. And even after that, the new baby will be sleeping in a bassinet for atleast the first 2 months and not even need the crib.

20090205135649AAFNsJG	Pregnancy & Parenting;Parenting	Where should the following girl live?	Where should the following girl live?       Germany (what little girl wants and get because she is in Germany, and legal right under German law)   USA (mother wants and has legal right under US law)      She was born in the US and has lived her first 8 years in America. In a divorce her mother was granted custody and father order to pay child support and allowed 4 days a month.       German father took her to his native country Germany shortly afterward, and 13 months later a German Court rules that she can stay with her German father, because the little girl was able to fully interrogate in Germany and it would be inhume to take her away from her father. The little girl told the court in Germany that she wanted to live in Germany with her father, but still wants to see her mother (if she agrees not to take her away from her father in Germany), who she has not seen in 13 months. She was sacred that her mother would take away from her father.       In Germany they believe that the US is a horrible place to live and that since she is a German national (she is duel US/German national) she should live in Germany with her German parent, and if she is send back to America she can’t ever see her father again.  Because her Father took good care of her and raised her properly she still wants to see her American mother on a regular basis, but wants to live with him Germany.        This is why German mother and father take there US born children back to Germany when they divorce in America, and the American parent is treated the same as the non custodial parents in America usually the man. This case about 90 percent of the time. 90 percent of German children taken to America are returned to Germany by the US Federal court. This is how the system works and the US government does this to maintain good diplomatic relations with Germany.  The German parent never faces US Federal criminal charges, and if he/she faces state criminal charges the US State department and FBI will protect German parent and child from the State of Virginia, California example.

He threw food in the cafeteria, and a parent came in today to say my son spit on someone. He's never acted this way,He's in a completely different enviroment so i guess that's why he's showing off to be cool or something. I'm not sure what to do or say that'll make him stop. I feel embarrased because his teacher called me. Please help! I don't want to spank him or anything (i don't believe in that) because that wouldn't resolve anything, and i don't think punishing him is the answer either because he'll just do it again. so what do i do?

He has gotten into trouble three times at school for saying inappropriate things to girls.  I don't have anything bad or inappropriate in the house.  I don't let him watch anything not for his age group on TV.  He doesn't have TV in his room.  I have taken away all computer privileges.  I took all his video games.  He is grounded and has been until he can be good at school and I get a good report.  He is not allowed to hang out with the child he says he learned it from the first time he got in trouble.  I am running out of things to do to punish him.  I have talked to him.  Had discussions about his behavior.  Made him work around the house and do chores.  I made him throw away his own PS2.  I am hurting so bad because I really don't know what to do to get through to him  that the things he is saying is bad.  He just wont stop no matter what I do.  PLEASE HELP.

20090205133350AA4xQuq	Pregnancy & Parenting;Other - Pregnancy & Parenting	I am writing a story it involves something about Paternity. Please help me how to solve it.?	The Story:      This engaged woman (Nessa) accidentally slept with her bestfriend, Nate and got pregnant. Nessa's fiance (Ryan) forgave Nessa because he knew Nessa didn't mean it. Nessa wanted to get an abortion but Ryan insisted to keep it but change the baby's last name to his. Nate has a girlfriend and they love each other so they are okay with the whole thing because it was all a huge mistake.      My question:   Is it possible to change the baby's name (to Ryan's) legally? If so, how?      PS: The baby is due in 7 months and Nessa and Ryan's wedding is in 2 months.      I think this will be easier for them as they are all okay with it but, please do tell me how to solve this.      Many thanks! :)

Every now and then when I use the bathroom theres something in the toilet that looks like small pieces of something in the toilet. Then today I went to the restroom and I was peeing when I looked into the toilet and there was this mass of something hanging outside of me. It was skin colored and I took toilet paper and wiped it off of me and looked at it. It wasnt bloody. It was rather slimy and it also had some black substance inside (i used toilet paper to look at it and pull it open). I went to wipe again and there were little pieces of something falling out of me. And then there was a clump of the substance again hanging out of me. Has anyone ever experienced this after a colposcopy? Is there something I should do? Im scared and confused.       Im also four days late on my period. Im not sure what this is related to.

Housing there is great, I could buy a house for less than $100k, they have fabulous resources for pediatric asthma, including many specialty centers and hospitals, the cost of living is lower, the weather is better, etc.      The downside, I'm single so we'd be moving away from everything we know, to a place where we know no one... I'd be leaving my fabulous support system here. I also have an amazing job here where I can take loads of time off and work from home. I also get a great paycheck and I picked the health benefits....      So has anyone moved away with their child to a new place where they knew no one? How'd it go? Was it terrifying?

20090205144428AAMlRS2	Pregnancy & Parenting;Other - Pregnancy & Parenting	Will he grow up or just not marriage material?	Background Info:   I have a boyfriend of three years, two of which we have been living together. When we first started dating, I was 18 and he was 21. The first year was dicey as we were both in that "party time" of our life and I had some issues with him lying a few times (regarding drugs). We got passed those issues and we both started getting more serious with our relationship. Although I liked to have fun, I have worked consistently since I was 16 years old as a receptionist and admin assisting...making sure to work on my resume to benefit my future. He, on the other hand, had little motivation to have a serious job (he worked at papa murphey's at the time) and found the party scene more appealing.      The problem now:   So, now I am 21 and he is 24 years old. We have grown so close and have been through a lot together. He has a good job and is very dedicated to his job (amazon). The only problem is that since he started off later in life, he doesn't seem to have the ability to work out his finances (he goes out and buys a video game and then asks me for gas money), he doesn't make much (I make a lot more than he), and he seems a little immature for his age (I'll tell you a fun story). Don't get me wrong, I love him dearly and we have a great time (most of the time)...but sometimes he's so immature I get a little embarrassed if we are around people.       To help you further understand what I mean about being immature:   (This is the fun story part) So we were walking the dog and he finds a stick and starts playing with the dog with it. At this point, I was holding the leash. He goes like he is going to throw the stick and I warn him not to throw it or our dog is going to yank my arm when she goes to chase it. So he says, "I want to see if she yanks your arm off" and throws it. Sure enough, she yanks me forward and I almost fall. All the while, he's giggling like a school girl. (15 min later he finally realizes that I'm upset and appologizes)   He doesn't always act like that but just has these immaturity kicks that drive me nuts.      My question is:   I want to marry and have a family with this man. Should I be worried that this 24 year old is going to act irresponsible/immature his whole life or should I not worry about it since he's young and just having fun?

By this, I don't mean "why aren't children treated as their parents equals," what I mean is this.  I remember when I was a teenager my mother always used to tell me that if my room wasn't clean or something, I was grounded.  I never understood that, I thought, when I grow up and get a house, if my house isn't clean, I'll either have to deal with it or clean it.  I never got why, if having a dirty room was as terrible as she insisted, I was grounded, instead of having to just deal with the dirty room...      so, can any parents, or anyone who understands this, explain...

However, I got my period back Jan 15 and is was pretty scary. Heavy bleeding, clotting, cramping- the whole nine. Only thing is the cramping is back 2week before my next expected period. I went to my OBGYN yesterday and he said I was free of infection, no swelling or discharge- he couldn't find reason for discomfort. All he said was for me to schedule my annual exam which will be more in dept. My question is: If I were pregnant again, he would have been able to tell at yesterdays visit, right. I ask because in due back on Feb 12 and i am still TTC. I don't have too many symptoms, just kind of wishful thinking, you know.   Thanks in Advance      FYI- All dr preformed was urine test, vaginal exam. No full pap or blood work.

We get up around 7 and she sits in her swing while I eat breakfast and watch a dvr'd show.  Then she lays on her blanket and coos and gurgles for about 30 min.  She falls asleep again around 10-11 and then we go out to run errands.  She sleeps through most of that.  Around 1 or 2 we rock in the chair for a bit after feeding.  Then we walk around the house and look at things  for a bit.  And we do some tummy time.  Back to sleep from 6-9, then bed at 9-10      These are the days when I don't have school or work.
20090205144643AAanih4	Pregnancy & Parenting;Parenting	Children have too much power?	Why is the gov't giving kids so much power? Kids telling their parents they can't monitor what they do on the internet because they have a right to privacy and crap!!! Parents needing lawyers and legal advisement before disciplining their kids. What the hell is going on???   If I was a parent paying the bills, my child will have NO RIGHTS!!! I can go in their room whenever I want. Flip mattresses, dig in the closet, watch internet activity. Why are parents such punks these days. Letting kids talk back. I would take everything out of their room and make them sleep on the floor. Make them hand wash their clothes, eat broccoli and carrots while everyone else eats pizza for dinner. Make them eat a mint while everyone else has banana split sundaes for dessert. I'm watching  Maury and seeing 12 year old kids drinking and having sex, and parents are scared of them becausee they might run to child protective services. Why has the gov't put children above the parent on the pyramide?

20090205152130AAy0vqH	Pregnancy & Parenting;Parenting	Why do people keep having kids they can not afford?	I mean come on I can see having to suck up welfare for one maybe, because even though birth control is free at the health department or planned parenthood, and even though condoms are cheap at the store and free at the health department or planned parenthood some people still make a mistake.    After your first welfare baby why don't you people learn your lesson or do you just like the free money/food and it makes you feel good to have a baby because even though the dads leave you the baby won't for a very long time.    Is anyone else of paying in taxes every year and watching a single person with 3 kids get back thousands of dollars knowing that the government gave their kids free health care free food and the parent only paid in a few hundred dollars,, while we paid our own health care or own grocery bills and everything else our babies needed.

20090205065138AAp0V56	Pregnancy & Parenting;Baby Names	IYO: What is the difference between an ethnic name and a "ghetto" name?	I have my opinion on the difference...    Many people think that just a name is not in the top 100 names for babies it's unusual and awkward. Many names that are commonly used by african americans are actual names not made up like many people think they are. Here's a few examples in the difference...      Ethnic Names:   Hakeem     http://babynamesworld.parentsconnect.com...    Jamal    http://babynamesworld.parentsconnect.com...    Rashida    http://babynamesworld.parentsconnect.com...

"Ghetto" Names:   Latavia   LaQuorsha   Tashinique   Jevarius         I know that this subject not only applies to African Americans because other races have their differences too. And I hate to loosely throw around the term "ghetto" but I really wanted some insightful opinion of what the differences are. If you examples of the ethnic/weird difference in your race, please feel free to share.      In your opinion, how would you explain the difference? Please, only answer intellectually. If you are not capable of giving a justifed educated opinion, don't answer.

20090205153422AAlBpGH	Pregnancy & Parenting;Toddler & Preschooler	My 4  year old is getting her adenoids taken out...?	My 4 year old daughter Hannah is getting her adenoids taken out, and tubes put in tomorrow. She doesn't really understand, but she knows she is getting a "shot" and she keeps telling people, "I get shot tomorrow, eek!" But they are going to put the IV in after shes asleep, and she really shouldn't go through any pain before, hopefully.    But how should i explain to her what they are going to do? She will probably freak if i tell her how they do what they are doing, so whats a good way to tell her that shes getting tubes in and adenoids out? And i know that she will not be happy with the cuts from where they went in, and will want to know why? How can i explain this? Oh and she keeps asking, "Will they cut me?" How do i say yes without scaring her, i have been saying, "Maybe, i don't know yet."     And any advice on this whole situation? thanks :)

20090205150531AAl0eaF	Pregnancy & Parenting;Parenting	Would the following girl little girl like her daddy/he does not pay child support?	Would the following girl little girl like her daddy. She is living with her mother and she sees her father several times a week or even more. Her mother encourages her to spend a lot of time with her father and his extended family. The mother thinks this is very important. Her father does not pay child support, because the law does not allow court ordered child support. The government believes that parents will fight over child support as in America and cases instability and resentment between the parents, and does not want the mothers to deny father access as in America just to get more court order child support.   Her mother thinks that it is selfish for a mother to ask for child support from the father troughs the courts. Her father sometimes buys her a gift or some clouding or earrings and takes her out.  Her mother gets welfare and free medical insurance from the Government if she can’t afford it. Her father pays for this with the tax he pays on his income, and he thinks it is worth paying those taxes.  It cost only about $200.00 month to care for a child.  The mother gets government benefits for this.  All parents get this. Because there country is a welfare state and has a higher living standard as the USA.

She says now is better because I have freedom and later it will be all about the baby and I won't be able to sleep. But now is when I'm uncomfortable, feel tired, have to pee all the time etc. Is it just me not enjoying this last weeks and wanting to have my baby already or are there other moms who feel this way?      I wish I could understand what she means but at this stage the least I think about is going out and having freedom. I just want to rest. Besides, when I say I can't wait I also mean I want to hold my baby already.

On the 3rd February I started to bleed with the flow of a normal period but now Ive had literally a spot of blood all day.      I expected that I missed the period on the 11th due to stress but I was expecting my next one to arrive by the 15th February, so either this period (if thats what it is) has arrived early or very late.      Me and my partner have had unprotected sex about 7 times whilst my period was missing/uptil the bleeding.      I had a blood test for HCG on the 17th Jan and was negative and all urine tests negative last week.      I dont understand whats going on, do you?      am i pregnant, do i have mixed up hormones? I am not under any stress or on any b/c pills      I have had a history of low HCG with my last pregnancy but I honestly do not feel pregnant.

20090205150116AAz8Hjx	Pregnancy & Parenting;Parenting	Sister continually calling dfacs on parents. How to make it stop?	My parents are raising my sister's children because she is incapable of doing it herself. She wants custody of them, but the judge has already ordered them to stay with my parents. THe last time they were in court someone mysteriously called dfacs and reported that my dad had sexually abused my neice. Nothing came of it, of course.    Well, now she has called again and dfacs is investigating as I write this! All because my niece, who is five, and has a 9 year old brother, pointed to my dad's private area and said, "that's his pee-pee" or something along those lines. These things only happen after the kids have been over at their house and never before. HOw can I make this stop? Or will my parents just keep getting investigated everytime she does this??

So I made out with this guy, and he apparently licked 1 centimeter down from the edge of my bottom lip, so there was an extremely thin layer of his saliva there. Is that normal? It wasn't like a big thing of drool, it was just like as if you were to lick your arm, exactly that thin of a layer of saliva.   (And wow, he loved using his tongue!)  Thanks!  If it's abnormal, I'm going to have to correct him...but how? THANKS AGAIN!

20090205151311AAc6TOo	Pregnancy & Parenting;Adolescent	My 18 yr old son met this 17 yr old girl on myspace 2 yrs ago, and she lives in W. Virginia, and she came down?	the week before Thanksgiving to my sister's house, is where he is living since Aug. 2008, and spent the night, and they had sex, and now she is 10 weeks pregnant. I had told him before she came down that I did not approve, and he was trying to get me to go pick her up at a bus station, but I told him I was not going to , because she is a total stranger, but he went against my rules and did it anyway. There are several things that I do not like, he had never seen her in person before he slept with her, and I wonder if it is his baby, the only way we will know is get a blood test after the baby is born. There are alot of questions I need to discuss with her mother, but they do not know me, but we need to work this out together, and make some decisions, about this situation. My son is getting his GED, and he does not have a job. I feel he should have got to know her better before he slept with her, and waited until he was a little bit older and had a job before he decided to be sexually active. I do not know how they are going to raise this baby living so far apart, and she is just a junior in high school. she will turn 18 on Feb. 13th. I really do need some good advice on how to deal with this.

I love being a SAHM, we all do to some degree.    But lately i can't stand being the one that is around most of the time. My dh works alot, and I'm the one who is responsible for everything.      To answer my own question:   1.) What do you hate doing, dread doing, can't stand, wish it wasn't part of your day?   Cleaning up after everything. The mess the food, the diapers, the poor cat that gets his hair ripped out in chunks. I'm very particular about the way my house looks and if it's not pefect than I can't sit down.       2.)And what annoys you the most about being a SAHM?Never being able to have a "good nights sleep" not that my kids wake up, but for the simple fact that i am responible for being the one to get up if they do wake up. My husband can sleep through the screaming and crying for hours. It doesn't bother him. I just want that solid night of sleep without sleeping lighty to hear a child.         Whats everyone else take?   I know this comes along with the job of being mommy, just wondering if other moms feel this way too.

20090205121745AAdFGw8	Pregnancy & Parenting;Parenting	I'm in a predicament with my step daughter and her table manners.  Think you can help with some good advice?	My husband is in the military and had to move away from his thirteen year old daughter, and so he doesn't get to see her as often as he would like (once every two months).  He feels as though she's 'slipping away' and this saddens him to no end.        She and I get along great until it's meal time.  I was raised to not make smacking and sucking noises during any meal, even spaghetti.  Apparently she wasn't (it wasn't from my husband either because he eats without making a sound!)  In fact, my father hated it so much, that his pet peeve was passed right on down to my brother and I.  Hearing smacking sounds triggers an automatic intense anxiety button inside my brain.  I absolutely cannot stand it and see red for the entire duration of the smacking session!!      I continuously (kindly) ask her to stop no fewer than four times per meal.  She says she doesn't know what I'm talking about, eats quietly for a few moments, and then is right back at it again.  Her father asks her a couple times too for my sake.      She will be here this weekend and I'm tired of being extremely stressed when I think of our next meal with her.  My husband hesitates to continue to hound on her eating habits, one, because according to his daughter, I'm pretty much the new wife (we've been married a little over a year) and, two, because  like I said, he doesn't get to see her very often and she's already shown frustration towards him for "taking my side" when it comes time to eat.      What can I do?  Ignoring it and continuing to be nice is getting to be no longer an option.      Please no rude answers... and thanks in advance!

I have 1 friend who I couldn't have a birthday without.      8 friends that are in my group and can't be separated.      And about 15 across different classes, who are also very close.

He has fell in with a wrong crowd and now thinks he should'nt be punished for ditching classes and failing in some classes. Gets mad and lashes out at father with hands clenched thinking he can take on dad. Dad wont hit him cause thats  his son. So instead of staying in for punishment he chose to leave home and not come back. He's become so mean to us and does'nt care. We just want him to graduate and listen to some SIMPLE rules.

20090205122317AA87zlh	Pregnancy & Parenting;Trying to Conceive	Question about PCOS and Clomid?	I found out in May 2007, that I had PCOS and began taking Metformin, I got pregnant in March 2008 but had a miscarriage. I just got the results from a progesterone blood test, and I have a 1.1 level and youre supposed to have over an 8 to be ovulating.   I guess I am just wondering, about anyone who has got pregnant using Clomid , and if they did anything different. Also how exactly the Clomid works for those with PCOS...   I am really hoping that the Clomid works and that we will get pregnant after the first month of using it..I would love any feedback please!!!! Its been almost a year since the MC and still no luck!

20090205123538AAmDtbG	Pregnancy & Parenting;Toddler & Preschooler	How do I get my three-year-old to stop hitting other kids?	My three-year-old daughter has been having a problem with hitting, kicking, and yelling.  She has been doing it to her younger brother for a few months now, since he has been old enough to take her toys.  She started preschool a few weeks ago and loves it, she is beaming with joy each time I pick her up and runs to get to the class, so it is not an adjustment problem.  The problem is, when faced with another child at school who has a toy she wants or if she feels her toys are threatened, she will hit, kick, or push to get her way.     We have tried just about everything, and have taken a LOT of time with her to calmly get down on her level and talk to her about the fact that it is not ok.  She "gets" the concept-she will apologize after the fact and realizes immediately that she did something wrong, and will state that hitting is not nice behavior.  BUT it's like in that moment where she wants something, she is unable to control her behavior.  We have tried time outs and talking to the point of exhaustion, and unlike other behavior phases that have come and gone, this is sticking and not getting better.   We are at our wits' end, and now at school, I can tell that the teacher is frustrated with her after trying over and over to intervene.  I have placed a call with the teacher to try to talk to her privately about this and get her advice, but in the meantime, I am heartbroken over this each and every time I pick her up from school only to find out that she has hurt another child.   ANY advice would be so greatly appreciated!  We do not hit or scream at home, so I don't know how this has become a part of her routine.  She is very smart and has a feisty personality, but this behavior is unacceptable.  Thank you for listening to a frustrated parent.
20090205124005AA6EDuW	Pregnancy & Parenting;Adolescent	My life is so screwed up not sure what to do next advise?	I'm 16 and i'm pregnant 5 months along.    Okay before you judge me hear my story please!       Its not your regular 17 and pregnant OMG WHAT TO DO?! Story... Its this.      Ive known my boyfriend since i was 13 years old he never told me his story about how he was battling cancer but he was always soooo special and different i figured maybe he was bi-polar or had depression issues..Instead he was going through a cancer battle we became best friends we were never "going out." untill i was 15 then he asked me to be his girlfriend he opened up to me that he was given only a certain amount of time to live that he could die any day any time... When he told me this i had obviously already fallen in love with him completely he took me to his favorite spot they over looked the small town we live in and then in the back of his truck we lost our virginitys he even used protection this was not planned it just happened.  months later he was in the hospital and i told him i was pregnant he smiled the biggest smile i had ever seen on him he grabbed my hand brushed my hair back and told me and tried to comfort me as i was balling my eyes out and he told me to keep the baby to please no matter what keep the baby. He died the next day..I held his hand all night to find him gone. Well my parents want me to give up the baby they dont care if the father is dead or what they want the baby to be given up but i want this baby, i know its gonna be hell i know i'm giving up my teen years I KNOW THAT! No college no nothing im throwing my life away right? I know. But its the only thing of Keith really left me.... What do you think?
